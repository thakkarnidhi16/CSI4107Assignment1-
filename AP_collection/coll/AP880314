<TEXT>
   The ``Sharpeville Six,'' a
group of blacks whose murder convictions have drawn protest at home
and abroad, are scheduled to be hanged Friday, one of their lawyers
said Monday.
   Attorney Prakash Diar said an appeal for clemency was denied and
the five men and one woman were notified they will be executed
Friday morning.
   The six were convicted in connection with the killing of black
township councilor Jacob Dlamini in Sharpeville, about 40 miles
south of Johannesburg, on Sept. 3, 1984.
   Evidence at their trial showed the six were not among those who
actually hacked and burned Dlamini to death.
   They were convicted under the doctrine of ``common purpose,''
which holds they were responsible for the killing by being part of
the mob that gathered outside Dlamini's home with the intent to
kill him.
   Human rights groups and government officials, both in South
Africa and internationally, have called for clemency.
   Theresa Ramashamola, 26, is the only woman on death row in South
Africa for what activists consider a politically motivated offense.
   Britain's Conservative Party government expressed hope Monday
night that South Africa will call off the hangings.
   Lynda Chalker, minister of state at the Foreign Office, told the
House of Commons, ``Even at this late stage we sincerely and
earnestly hope that the South African government will heed the
united call of everyone for clemency in these cases.''
   She said Britain backed a United Nations Security Council call
for the sentences to be commuted.
   About 100 lawmakers of Britain's opposition Labor Party signed a
statement expressing ``total condemnation'' of the planned
executions.
   Amnesty International, the London-based human rights
organization, appealed to South African President P.W. Botha to
spare the lives of the six.
   Dlamini's killing came during riots which began a two-year
outbreak of nationwide anti-apartheid protests that left more than
2,000 blacks dead.
   Black activists frequently targeted black township councilors,
considering them collaborators with the white-led government.
   The Media Workers Association of South Africa appealed to the
government Monday to ``demonstrate good will to the people of South
Africa in particular and mankind at large by sparing the lives of
the Sharpeville Six.''
   The scheduled execution date is three days before the
anniversary of the Sharpeville riots of March 21, 1960.
   Sixty-nine blacks were killed when police fired on peaceful
protesters demonstrating against the pass laws, which required
blacks to carry identification documents while in white areas. The
laws have since been repealed.
   The 1960 shootings raised an international storm of protest.
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated
society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national
affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain
separate districts, schools and health services.

   Bob Dole declared Monday ``it's not over'' for his Republican
presidential campaign despite indications of a big Illinois victory
for George Bush, but Democrat Paul Simon admitted ``I have no plans
beyond tomorrow'' and the home-state primary he needs to win.
   With five presidential candidates racing around the state in a
final day of campaigning, Jesse Jackson was buoyed by a poll
suggesting he may have pulled even with fellow favorite son Simon.
   ``On the eve of a significant breakthrough ... with your help,
we the people can win Illinois,'' Jackson told a cheering crowd of
about 1,800 in Carbondale, Ill. ``I tell you, we the people will
win.''
   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, lying third, sought a good
enough showing to keep up some momentum from Super Tuesday. Over
and over on Monday, Dukakis hammered at Simon's contention that the
Democratic convention will be deadlocked.
   It ``would be a disaster'' for the Democrats to end the primary
process without a nominee-to-be, Dukakis said, with ``negotiating,
dealing, people behind closed doors trying to decide who the
nominee ought to be.''
   Dukakis apparently wasn't the only Democrat wanting to avoid a
brokered convention. Democratic Chairman Paul Kirk suggested Monday
he would try to rally uncommitted delegates behind whichever
candidate is leading the field at the end of the primary season, if
none has a lock on the nomination.
   Kirk said in a telephone interview from New York that he didn't
want to ``leave the impression that Kirk's going to be the broker''
but said he would be ``in the middle'' of efforts to avoid hurting
the nominee with a battle just before or during the convention.
   The problem for Dole was much more immediate than the
conventions, months away in the summer. The Kansas Republican was
looking for a way to keep his campaign alive in the face of a
string of Bush victories.
   ``It's not over for Bob Dole,'' he told the Executives Club of
Chicago.
   Later, at a news conference, Dole repeated his determination to
continue beyond Tuesday: ``I've made a judgment that Illinois,
whatever happens, we're going to keep going.''
   The Kansas senator said he had ``made some inroads'' against
Bush in Illinois, but that there had not been enough time to stop
Bush's surge after a 16-state win last Tuesday.
   ``You want to elect momentum or elect the better candidate?'' he
asked the Executives Club audience. ``Maybe it's going to take a
couple of weeks for everything to sort of slow down.''
   But the Illinois outlook for Dole was not good.
   A Chicago Tribune poll said Bush was the choice of 62 percent of
the likely GOP voters in Illinois, with only 28 percent for Dole.
   Such a strong showing could give Bush a big chunk of the 82
Republican delegates at stake in Illinois. Added to his current
total of 705 delegates, it could give him more than 60 percent of
the 1,139 needed to win the nomination at the GOP National
Convention in New Orleans in August. Dole has 165.
   Despite the numbers, Bush told a reporter that suggestions he
has locked up the nomination are premature.
   ``I feel the speculation has gotten ahead of the story,'' Bush
said as he flew on Air Force Two from Chicago to Springfield, Ill.
However, when asked if he were surprised that Dole was staying in
the race, he replied: ``I'm not sure I understand what he's doing.''
   On the Democratic side, Simon was facing the reality that he has
to win the Illinois primary to keep even his stripped-down campaign
alive until the Democratic National Convention in July.
   ``I have no plans beyond tomorrow,'' he said in Chicago. ``I
have to win and I will win. But obviously Michigan and Wisconsin
come next.''
   And second place isn't good enough.
   ``A strong second isn't very strong,'' Simon told a reporter. If
he does end up in second place in either delegates or the popular
vote in Illinois, he said, ``I'd have to reevaluate.''
   One poll published Monday in the Chicago Tribune suggested Simon
faces the possibility of a second-place finish.
   The survey, conducted Friday and Saturday, said 32 percent of
likely Democratic voters supported Jackson, 29 percent backed Simon
and 20 percent said they would vote for Dukakis. Rep. Richard
Gephardt of Missouri was the choice of 5 percent and Sen. Albert
Gore Jr. of Tennessee had the backing of 4 percent.
   The poll, conducted by Peter Hart Research Associates,
interviewed 500 people and had a potential margin of error of 5
percentage points.
   An ABC News-Washington Post tracking poll published in Tuesday's
editions of the Post gave Simon the lead with 39 percent support to
Jackson's 34 percent among very likely Democratic voters. Dukakis
had 17 percent with Gore and Gephardt far behind. The potential
sampling error in the survey, conducted Saturday and Sunday, was
plus or minus 6 percentage points.
   Going into the Illinois primary, Dukakis held the lead in the
Associated Press delegate count, with 463 to 424 for Jackson. Gore
had 353 and Simon just 36.
   A total of 173 delegates are at stake on the Democratic side in
Illinois.
   One Dukakis goal is to win some of those delegates, a difficult
task given the complicated nature of the state's ballot. Voters not
only cast ballots for presidential candidates, they also vote
directly for delegate candidates. Thus, a vote for Dukakis in the
``beauty contest'' portion does not necessarily mean a vote for him
in the delegate selection process.
   Another goal, Dukakis aides said privately, is to narrow the
Democratic field. Mentioning the polls showing Dukakis drawing his
last-minute support from Simon's voters, the governor's aides said
they would be delighted to see Jackson beat Simon, believing it
would drive the senator from the race.
   Republican Pat Robertson was to be in Washington on primary day,
where he planned to meet with the visiting Israeli prime minister,
Yitzhak Shamir. The Robertson campaign characterized it as a
meeting of ``two old friends.''

   Katharine Hepburn, whose outspoken suppport of
women's reproductive rights is a family tradition, made a rare
public appearance Monday night when Planned Parenthood honored her
and her late mother at a gala affair.
   The 79-year-old Miss Hepburn received a standing ovation from
1,100 guests at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel for the black-tie event,
titled ``Celebrating Two Generations of Individual Courage.
   ``It's a frightfully important subject,'' the actress said of
women's rights to abortion and birth control. ``And I'm damn lucky
to have had a mother who waked me up at an early age'' to the
importance of ``doing things for other people.''
   Attired in a black pantsuit, Miss Hepburn said, ```When a girl
becomes pregnant should she be forced by law to have this baby?
She's 13. She doesn't want it. She can't support it. Her family
doesn't want it. It would seem to me that she should be allowed to
have an abortion.''
   Miss Hepburn was ``enthusiastic'' about the party, said Winston
Forrest, vice president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America.
   ``She felt her mother deserved the honoring,'' he said.
   The black-tie event is to benefit a Planned Parenthood fund to
honor Miss Hepburn's mother, Katharine Houghton Hepburn.
   Proceeds from the dinner, priced at $500 to $1,000 a ticket,
will be dedicated to Miss Hepburn's three priorities: keeping
abortion safe and legal, preventing teen-age pregnancies and
preserving family planning for the poor.
   Her mother, an early supporter of birth control, worked
alongside Planned Parenthood founder Margaret Sanger more than 70
years ago.
   Mrs. Hepburn, a member of the Houghton family that founded
Corning Glass, testified before the U.S. Senate in the 1930s on the
need for birth control, particularly for poor women, Forrest said.
   She maintained that ``a rich woman could get the information and
access to birth control but the poor woman could not,'' he said.
   She died in 1951 at the age of 73.
   Miss Hepburn became involved in Planned Parenthood in 1981. The
group's president, Faye Wattleton, recruited the actress ``to take
on the legacy her mother had established by volunteering to write
letters and be spokesperson for reproductive rights and abortion
rights for women,'' Forrest said.
   He said her involvement has brought the organization an
additonal 200,000 donors and supporters.

   More than 50 handicapped people demonstrated
outside the Department of Transportation on Monday to protest what
they said are federal policies that result in inadequate mass
transit services for disabled people.
   Some protestors chained themselves to the doors of the DOT
headquarters and vowed to stay until officials agree to improve bus
service for handicapped people.
   Members of Americans Disabled For Accessible Transportation
(ADAPT) gathered from around the country to protest the
department's decision to appeal a January ruling that transit
agencies must provide services to the handicapped regardless of
cost.
   In the ruling, U.S. District Judge Marvin Katz in Philadelphia
struck down a Transportation Department regulation requiring the
nation's transit authorities to spend no more than 3 percent of
their budgets on the disabled.
   The demonstrators timed their protest to coincide with a
three-day meeting of the American Public Transit Association, which
represents local agencies that provide bus and subway service.
   Timothy Cook, a Philadelphia attorney who represented ADAPT in
the lawsuit, said the present system of allowing transit agencies
to decide what services to provide to the handicapped ``gives
individual states the option to discriminate.''
   Cook said that in Philadelphia, handicapped residents must phone
five to seven days in advance to get an accessible bus to pick them
up.
   ``They should be able to use the next bus coming along,'' Cook
said. ``Many transit authorities simply don't want funny-looking
people on the bus with normal people.''
   Transportation Secretary Jim Burnley said Monday the department
is ``fully committed to providing mass transportation to people
with disabilities.''

<TEXT>
   The Panama Canal, still one of the
hemisphere's most important pieces of real estate, has allowed
ships to move between the Atlantic and Pacific without interruption
through nine months of political unrest.
   Nearly 13,000 vessels a year avoid the long voyage around Cape
Horn, the southern tip of South America, by traveling 50 miles from
sea to sea through the ``Big Ditch'' that opened in 1914. More than
140 million tons of cargo move through it every year.
   The Panama Canal Treaties signed in 1977 commit the United
States to turn over complete control of the canal and military
installations to Panama by midnight Dec. 31, 1999.
   Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, commander of the Defense Forces and
the man in charge in Panama, claims Washington wants to renege on
the treaties and continue ``occupying'' the canal indefinitely.
   He says the Reagan administration is waging a smear campaign to
try to replace him with an administration it can manipulate.
Noriega was indicted in Florida last month on charges of
involvement in smuggling Colombian cocaine into the United States.
   Although the canal remains an emotional topic of debate, its
strategic importance has declined in the past 30 years.
   Dennis McAuliffe, administrator of the Panama Canal Commission,
says that is because the United States has improved and extended
its military forces.
   ``During and after World War II, through the 1950s, the major
port system was New York and sealift through the canal was about
the only way to reinforce presence in the Pacific, but now there
are major U.S. naval forces in both oceans and major ports on the
West Coast,'' he said.
   ``There is less of a need to transport capital ships through the
canal, and airlift capacity has increased tremendously.''
   Traffic through the canal brings the commission about $320
million a year in tolls.
   Supertankers and the largest bulk carriers are too big for the
three sets of locks that raise and lower vessels 85 feet, but 93
percent of the world's ships can get through, said Richard Wainio,
chief of the commission's Economic and Marketing Division.
   ``The Panamax is still the world's most popular cargo
shipbuilding design,'' he said, referring to the largest vessel the
canal can handle. A Panamax vessel has a beam width of 106 feet.
The locks are 110 feet wide.
   Nor is the canal concept outdated. The United States, Japan and
Panama began a study last year of the feasibility of building
another. Its conclusions are expected in 1992 at the earliest.
   For the United States, the strategic value of what used to be
the Panama Canal Zone is enhanced by the presence of the Southern
Command, involving about 10,000 American soldiers and 20,000
dependents, which is responsible for U.S. military operations in
Latin America.
   It operates half a dozen bases along the canal and has its
headquarters in Quarry Heights, adjacent to Balboa.
   During their long tenure, the Americans built replicas of their
own towns. Communities of white wooden houses on tree-lined streets
named in English still can be found in the 10-mile-wide area that
had been the Canal Zone.
   McAuliffe said this week that day-to-day coordination between
his commission and Panamanian port authorities is ``easy, fluid and
very effective.''
   This month, there had been several bomb threats, which he called
``an irritant,'' and the commision flew in large quantities of cash
because of Panama's banking crisis to cover the paychecks of canal
employees. The latest checks were handed out Monday.
   Under sanctions imposed last week, the Reagan administration is
withholding monthly payments to Panama of about $6.6 million for
canal operations and putting the money in escrow.

<TEXT>
   Fifty years after the Nazis closed the
world's first museum of Jewish art in Vienna, a private exhibit of
Jewish ritual objects has been drawing large crowds of visitors.
   Some 800 items displayed at the ``Judentum in Wien'' (``Jews in
Vienna'') exhibit housed by the Museum of the History of Vienna are
all loans from a private Judaica collection, regarded by art
historians as one the most important private collections of Jewish
life.
   According to Max Berger, owner of the collection, most of the
drawings, paintings, sculptures, medals, coins, manuscripts and
handicraft on show were in danger of being destroyed or lost after
Austria's annexation by Nazi Germany in 1938.
   Berger, a Viennese businessman who survived a Nazi concentration
camp, pieced together his collection over years and this is the
first time it has been shown in public.
   The exhibit displays mementoes of Jewish life from the early
18th century until present, focusing on Vienna as an important
center in the history of European Jewry. Museum officials said it
is the first step toward opening a permanent Jewish museum here in
the next two or three years.
   About 6,000 Jews live in Vienna today, compared with 200,000 who
helped make this city a capital of science, culture and the arts
before World War II. They included Sigmund Freud, Gustav Mahler,
Stefan Zweig, Arnold Schoenberg and hundreds of others.
   Some 65,000 Austrian Jews perished in Nazi concentration and
death camps during the war.
   The exhibit is divided into eight sections, including ritual
objects and Hebrew writings, the Jewish year and life, the history
of the Viennese Jews, Zionism, anti-semitism and persecution and
Jewish contributions to art and culture.
   ``It's the first time that the most important private Judaica
collection in Europe is displayed for the Austrian public after the
war,'' Karl-Albrecht Weinberger, a curator who helped set up the
display, said in an interview.
   By March 3, the exhibit had been visited by some 30,000 people.
   ``On Saturdays and Sundays we have up to 500 visitors a day,''
Weinberger said, adding that recently Austrian school authorities
advised schools to come and see the exhibit as part of their
history classes.
   More young Austrians gradually have been educated about the Nazi
past and the Holocaust in the two years since the first disclosures
that President Kurt Waldheim had covered up his wartime past as a
German army lieutenant in the Balkans.
   Weinberger said the exhibit was planned before Waldheim became
president.
   The most valuable objects displayed are a silver-and-gold torah
crown made in Austria in 1810 and a torah plaque made in 1806 of
gold-covered silver.
   The oldest display is a torah curtain made around 1700 of red
velvet laced with silver threads.
   Weinberger said the first Jewish Museum in the world opened in
Vienna in 1895, with a very big collection of Jewish art.
   The Nazis dismantled it in 1938. While some items were lost or
destroyed, others were taken by the Germans to Prague where they
planned to open a big anti-semitic Jewish museum. The museum never
materialized but some objects have remained in the Prague Jewish
Museum which opened after the war.
   Asked if the Austrians ever asked the Czechs to return the items
held by the Vienna Museum, Weinberger said they never did.
   ``It's difficult to prove what objects belonged to the Jewish
Vienna Museum as all catalog were destroyed during the war,'' he
said.

   A cracked fuel line threw a metric wrench
into a plan by Honda to become the first Japanese automaker to
transport its U.S.-built cars back to Japan for sale.
   The auto carrier Green Bay, built in Japan last year, was
examined by repair crews Monday, a day after it slipped quietly
back into port here with its cargo of 540 U.S.-built Accords and
100 Honda motorcyles.
   The ship's owner, Central Gulf Lines of New Orleans, declined to
comment, but Honda spokesman Shin Tanaka in Detroit said a fuel
line crack forced the ship's return.
   He said Honda Motor Co. Ltd. was postponing from March 22 to
April 8 a gala reception to welcome the vessel at Narashino Port,
east of Tokyo. If necessary, he said, the cargo will be moved to
another ship from the Green Bay, which has made several successful
trips for Honda since it was completed Oct. 29 by Mitsui
Engineering & Shipbuilding Ltd.
   The ship departed March 7 with much fanfare, after Tetsuo Chino,
president of Honda North America Inc., drove the first car on board
and held a news conference with Sen. Bob Packwood, R-Ore.
   Francois L. Elmealeh of the Port of Portland's marine marketing
department said the problems with the ship didn't threaten the
cargo or crew.
   ``I think it's an embarrassment more than anything,'' Elmealeh
said.

   Sen. Paul Simon shrugged off new poll results
suggesting his lead in his home state had diminished to a tie with
Jesse Jackson, but conceded Sunday that his Democratic campaign was
hampered by not having the money to buy television ads in Illinois.
   ``Obviously, not to have paid media hampers me in Illinois,''
Simon said as he campaigned in the city's Chinatown neighborhood.
``But the only way I could have paid media would be to use up the
resources and obligate the matching funds that are coming.''
   That would have left Simon unable to afford television
advertising in Wisconsin, New York and other states with contests
upcoming, he said.
   ``Frankly, I'm not in it just for Illinois _ otherwise I'd go on
paid media. ... I want to win the nomination _ not buy the
nomination,'' he added.
   But the results of a Chicago Tribune poll to be published in
Monday's editions suggested Simon's campaign was faltering in
Illinois, despite his record as a state representative and U.S.
senator.
   The poll of 500 registered Democrats indicated 32 percent
supported Jackson, 29 percent backed Simon and 20 percent favored
Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis. However, the poll, taken for
the Tribune by Peter D. Hart and Associates, has a margin of error
of plus or minus five percentage points, making the race a dead
heat.
   The poll, taken Friday and Saturday, updates one taken earlier
last week that showed Simon leading with 35 percent, followed by
Jackson with 30 percent and Dukakis with 18 percent.
   Simon still insisted he would carry his home state on Tuesday,
saying, ``I think the people of Illinois are going to make a sound
decision.''
   And his optimism appeared to be supported by a poll for The
Washington Post and ABC News which was published in Monday's
editions of the newspaper.
   That poll showed Simon holding a strong lead with 42 percent,
Jackson 33 percent, Dukakis 14 percent, Sen. Gore of Tennessee 4
percent, Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri 3 percent and others and
undecided, 4 percent. The poll was based on telephone interviews
Friday night and Saturday with 287 Illinois Democratic voters who
were likely to cast ballots. The margin of error was 6 percent.
   ``I would add that four years ago there wasn't a single poll
that showed me ahead and I won,'' Simon said, referring to his
upset victory in a U.S. Senate race against Republican incumbent
Charles Percy.
   Meanwhile, Dukakis, who has assaulted Simon's campaign with a
blitz of last-minute television advertising, accused Simon of
``doing a disservice to the Democratic Party'' by talking up the
likelihood of a brokered presidential convention in Atlanta.
   ``I think the notion of a brokered convention would be an
absolute disaster,'' Dukakis said Sunday.
   ``The reality is we're not going to have a first-ballot
nominee,'' Simon countered. ``And those brokered conventions have
produced candidates ... like Franklin Roosevelt, Harry Truman and
John F. Kennedy, and it turned out quite well for the American
people.''

   It's been nearly three years since a
toddler's visit to a doctor sparked what has become the marathon
trial of Margaret Kelly Michaels, a former day-care teacher accused
of sexually abusing her students.
   Ms. Michaels, 26, resigned from the Wee Care Day Nursery in
Maplewood in April 1985 after working for six months. A few days
later, a boy, now 7, told a nurse taking his temperature rectally
that Ms. Michaels did the same to him.
   The school was closed soon afterward, and by December 1985, Ms.
Michaels had been indicted on 235 counts of sexually abusing 31
3-to 5-year-old students.
   The charges have since been reduced to 20 students. Closing
arguments in the trial, which began nine months ago in Superior
Court in Newark, are expected to begin Tuesday.
   The prosecution contends Ms. Michaels performed sexual acts on
the children, forced them to perform sexual acts on her, engaged
them in nude sex play and threatened further harm if they told of
the abuse.
   Ms. Michaels, who once aspired to be an actress, has been free
on $25,000 bail and living with her family in Pittsburgh since
January 1986.
   All but 128 charges of abuse have been dropped because of lack
of evidence and recent higher court rulings that clarified what
testimony is admissible in child sex abuse cases.
   ``We'll all be glad when it's over,'' Ms. Michaels' attorney,
Harvey Meltzer, said last week. ``We are very, very optimistic
she'll be acquitted on all charges.''
   Assistant Prosecutor Glenn D. Goldberg said, ``We feel there is
no reason to disbelieve the children's testimony about what
happened.''
   The boy who went to the doctor three years ago testified via
closed-circuit television last June that Ms. Michaels once took his
temperature and that of two friends using a rectal thermometer.
   The boy's mother testified earlier he told her in April 1985
that Ms. Michaels used a rectal thermometer daily on children.
   The mother and son were among about 120 prosecution witnesses.
In all, 19 children testified via closed-circuit television from
Judge William F. Harth's chambers. Ms. Michaels took the stand
earlier this month, and was one of 22 defense witnesses.
   The defense has argued there was not ``the time, space or
opportunity'' in the bustling environment of the school for Ms.
Michaels to commit the alleged offenses.
   But the prosecution said Ms. Michaels, whose duties included
supervising napping children, created opportunities. They contend
she sometimes took children, without permission, to a remote music
room and played the piano during sex games.
   The defense also says the children were prompted in their
allegations by investigators, psychologists and prosecutors.
Experts for the prosecution testified children cannot be
``brainwashed'' and could not have made up the stories.
   The prosecution also said Ms. Michaels' presented a false image
of herself.
   ``As a four-year drama student, a lot of what she was doing on
the witness stand was an attempt to appear spontaneous when in fact
it was not spontaneous,'' Goldberg said.
   But Metzler said: ``What we have is a very, very large jigsaw
puzzle that the jury must complete. ... We are going to show there
are pieces missing from the puzzle. Then it's up to the jury to
determine if the missing pieces amount to a reasonable doubt.''

   After 15 years of entertaining readers around
the world, humorist Russell Baker says he has written his last
``Sunday Observer'' column.
   ``I did it for 15 years. That's a long time to write a column
with three weeks' lead time,'' Baker said Sunday. ``Columnists tend
to hang on too long. I wanted to call it quits before that.''
   Baker, who announced his decision in a farewell column in The
New York Times Magazine, plans to continue his weekday column for
the Times and work on a book.
   Baker's daily and Sunday columns are distributed to about 400
newspapers across the United States and about 100 foreign papers,
according to Kevin Delaney of The New York Times News Service. The
weekday column appears twice a week.
   ``I'll still be doing the daily column, probably longer than I
should,'' Baker said. ``I'm 62 years old. You begin to run out of
steam.''

   Courtney Gibbs, the newly crowned Miss USA, says
she's tone deaf and can't dance, which is one reason why she
entered the pageant: It has no talent requirement.
   ``The Miss America Pageant has a talent division, and I really
don't have a talent that fits into any category,'' the 21-year-old
Ms. Gibbs was quoted as saying in this week's People magazine.
   Ms. Gibbs, Texas' fourth-consecutive winner of the pageant, said
she hopes her talent is ``speaking, because I want to go into
broadcasting, but you can't do that for three minutes in front of
the judges.
   ``I mean, I was a model for seven years, but I don't think
they'd understand me modeling clothes for three minutes.''

   Officials in this small, south-central
Pennsylvania community are waiting for actor Clint Eastwood to make
their day by paying a 10{-year-old speeding ticket.
   Eastwood, who is also mayor of Carmel, Calif., was driving west
along the Pennsylvania Turnpike in a frend's new black Ferrari on
Oct. 23, 1977, when he was clocked going 69 mph in a 55 mph zone,
police say.
   District Justice Marion L. Morgret of Everett said recently he
stopped sending Eastwood collection letters and warnings eight
years ago. He had the citation placed in his ``dead'' file.
   Eastwood, known for his tough-guy roles in such films as ``Dirty
Harry'' and ``Sudden Impact,'' was fined $53 and ordered to pay $10
in costs.
   The actor's agent, Lenny Hirshan, said Eastwood was on location
in San Francisco shooting a movie and could not be contacted.

   Jimmy Carter has vowed to support
Nigeria's drive to eradicate guinea worm, a debilitating parasite
that permanently disables 12,000 Nigerians annually.
   The former U.S. president, who arrived Sunday on an overnight
visit to this West African nation, pledged the support of Global
2000, a private, non-profit institution founded during his 1977-81
presidency. The Atlanta-based organization funds health and
agriculture projects in the developing world.
   ``Nigeria is the most heavily afflicted country in Africa. If we
can succeed here we can reach our goal to totally eradicate guinea
worm'' by 1995, Carter said during a meeting with the nation's
health minister, Dr. Olikoye Ransome-Kuti.
   It is estimated that 2.5 million Nigerians contract the disease
each year through contaminated drinking water.

   Eunice Kennedy Shriver has been selected
to receive the 1988 Laetare Medal, one of the most prestigious
awards given to American Catholics, the University of Notre Dame
announced.
   The university's president, the Rev. Edward A. Malloy, said
recently Mrs. Shriver will be honored for her work as founder and
chairwoman of Special Olympics International.
   ``Inscribed on each Laetare Medal is the slogan, `Truth is
mighty and will prevail,' '' Malloy said. ``Last summer, while
hosting the International Special Olympics Games, the Notre Dame
community saw anew an ancient Christian truth: Christ comes most
often in the stranger's guise.''
   Mrs. Shriver, a native of Brookline, Mass., is the fifth of the
nine children of Joseph P. and Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy, and the
sister of the late President John F. Kennedy.

   The Directors Guild of America has
honored Bernardo Bertolucci with his second directing award for
``The Last Emperor,'' in what could bode a triple-crown award
season for the Italian movie director.
   Bertolucci, who in January won a Golden Globe for directing
``The Last Emperor,'' picked up the DGA award Saturday night in
ceremonies held jointly at the Beverly Hilton Hotel and in New York.
   An Academy Award next month would make it a Bertolucci sweep.
Only three times in the 40-year history of the DGA award has it
failed to coincide with the Academy Award winner for best director.
   The last time was in 1985, when Steven Spielberg's directorial
colleagues gave him the nod for ``The Color Purple,'' while the
Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences didn't even nominate
him. The Oscar went instead to Sydney Pollack for ``Out of Africa.''
   Other top DGA winners Saturday were Will MacKenzie, who received
the TV comedy directing award for an episode of NBC-TV's ``Family
Ties'' called ```A' My Name is Alex''; and Marshall Herskovitz, who
won the nighttime dramatic series award for his pilot for ABC-TV's
``thirtysomething.''

   Bernard Rudofsky, an architect and social
commentator, has died at age 82.
   Rudofsky died of cancer Saturday at New York University Hospital.
   He wrote on a variety of subjects, ranging from the relationship
between the body and clothes to how streets are used in cities.
   Rudofsky's books and museum exhibitions influenced not only
architecture but fashion, interior design, urban planning and food.
   ``He was our most perceptive and outspoken critic of human
habits and habitations,'' said the chief editor of Interior Design
magazine, Stanley Abercrombie.
   Rudofsky first made waves in 1944 with an exhibition at the
Museum of Modern Art entitled ``Are Clothes Modern?''
   The exhibition, which examined the incompatibility of the human
body and clothing, showed one of his contributions to fashion, the
``Bernardo Sandal,'' a curved piece of leather with straps.
   Twenty years later, Rudofsky had an exhibit at the Museum of
Modern Art called ``Architecture Without Architects'' on vernacular
architecture _ the design of buildings built in societies,
sometimes ancient or primitive, that he believed were without
pretensions.
   Rudofsky, who was born and educated in Vienna, received a
master's degree in architecture and engineering and a doctorate in
technical sciences at the Technical University. He practiced
architecture for several years in Italy.
   He has lived in New York since 1935.
   His books included ``Streets for People,'' in which he examined
how streets are used in cities around the world, and ``The
Unfashionable Human Body,'' which looked at the relationship
between the body and clothing.
   Rudofsky taught at Yale University, the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology, the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Copenhagen and
Waseda University in Tokyo.
   He is survived by his wife, Berta.

   Amid the glitter and glamour of
Elizabeth Taylor and a parade of other celebrities, a gala benefit
Sunday raised $2 million for AIDS, which organizers said made it
the largest private fund-raiser for the disease ever.
   ``That's so much money ... I mean that's so incredibly much
money, and the things that money will do!'' said Ms. Taylor.
``We're talking about living or dying. And it's getting closer and
closer to all of us. ... We want to do something about it.
   ``The government can help to a certain point. Dollars can help
to a certain point,'' she said.
   The evening's total was about $2 million, said James Figetakis,
an associate of Ms. Taylor's publicist, Chen Sam.
   Ms. Taylor chairs the American Foundation for AIDS Research,
which will receive part of the funds. She served as hostess and
chief drawing card at the gala.
   As the finale swung into full force Sunday night, a steady
stream of stars in sparkling jewels and dresses began arriving at
the Fontainebleau Hilton Hotel here. They expressed gratitude they
could contribute in the battle against AIDS.
   ``It's really an honor for me to be here,'' actor Matt Dillon
said. ``It's a real problem everywhere, not just in America, but
all over the world. Anything I can do to help is why I'm here.''
   ``I think it's about time South Florida got involved in the
fight against AIDS,'' said Miami Vice star Saundra Santiago. ``I'm
very happy to be here to support this.''
   Other stars on hand included Lauren Hutton, Cheryl Tiegs, Ben
Vereen, Marlee Matlin, Donna Summers, Grace Jones, Margaux
Hemingway, Eddie Albert, Susan Anton and Van Johnson. Organizers
say they hope the benefit will serve as a model for similar
fund-raising efforts elsewhere.
   ``We've had the most private funds raised (for acquired immune
deficiency syndrome) at this one function than any other place in
the country,'' said event spokesman Charles Cinnamon. ``We want it
to be the prototype for the rest of the country.''
   Despite a lack of corporate sponsorships, which had been
expected to raise some $500,000 of the initial $3 million goal,
tickets to the ``grand finale'' at the hotel here sold out and
private donations were giving the fund drive an added boost,
organizers said.
   Stars and guests were invited Sunday to attend about a dozen
black-tie parties from Miami to Palm Beach, being held at the homes
of local celebrities and prominent community leaders for $2,500 a
plate, before converging in Miami Beach for the finale.
   The AIDS benefit was spearheaded by the Community Alliance
Against AIDS, a fund-raising arm of the University of Miami School
of Medicine. Proceeds from the event were being split between the
university's AIDS programs and the American Foundation for AIDS
Research, a non-profit group chaired by Ms. Taylor, which supports
research and education.
   In Palm Beach, Celia Lipton Farris raised at least $137,000 in
advance ticket sales for a private party being held in her home
with Ms. Taylor and some 300 guests. During the event, Ms. Farris,
a former child star and widow of a wealthy industrialist, announced
she was giving an additional $1.1 million, Figetakis said.
   Funds raised in Palm Beach will go toward the Comprehensive AIDS
Program, an organization in West Palm Beach and Belle Glade that
cares for AIDS victims.
   Other private dinner parties were being held in the homes of
singer Julio Iglesias, theatrical producer Zev Bufman and David
Paul, chief executive officer of Centrust Bank, among others.

<HEAD>Super Tuesday's Over, But `Final Tuesday' Lies Ahead</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   With Super Tuesday behind them, the
presidential candidates are looking toward the next big Tuesday on
the calendar _ June 7, when the California and New Jersey primaries
offer the last big bloc of delegates to be allocated before the
national conventions.
   There are other big primaries in coming months, including
Illinois, Pennsylvania and New York. But none offers a larger
one-day delegate total than Final Tuesday, as it's been dubbed.
   Montana and New Mexico also will hold primaries June 7.
   For Democrats, with Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, Jesse
Jackson and Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore bunched in the lead, the
late primaries on opposite sides of the country now loom as
potentially decisive.
   On the Republican side, where a big Super Tuesday victory last
week made Vice President George Bush his party's likely choice, the
June 7 primaries are expected to be much less crucial.
   A day after Super Tuesday, both Dukakis and Gore announced they
would soon make campaign stops in New Jersey and California.
Jackson, too, is building organizations in both states.
   California Democratic Party Chairman Peter Kelly says the Super
Tuesday result ``almost guarantees that the race will come down to
California, and California will have a say in picking the nominee.''
   In New Jersey, Democratic Sen. Bill Bradley said, ``New Jersey
takes on real importance. We are, with California, the final two
tests.''
   California voters will select 205 Democratic delegates in the
primary, and 109 more will be chosen in post-primary meetings.
Along with 22 pre-selected ``super delegates,'' the state will send
the largest single delegation to the convention with 336 members.
   New Jersey Democrats will select 71 delegates in primary voting.
They'll join with 38 more picked by party leaders, and nine super
delegates for a total of 118.
   To win the nomination, a Democratic candidate will need 2,082
delegates. Dukakis now leads the field with 460, followed by
Jackson with 424 and Gore with 353. Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt
totals 145 delegates, followed by Illinois Sen. Paul Simon with 36.
   Some party leaders say it will be nearly impossible for any of
the three leaders to gather enough wins between now and June to win
the nomination on the convention's first ballot. Dukakis, the
front-runner, would need to win more than 60 percent of the
delegates remaining available.
   But Final Tuesday wins could give any candidate an
unchallengable advantage in the final stretch.
   ``If you can go into the convention just coming off of (a win
in) New Jersey, it's momentum,'' said Rep. James Florio, D-N.J.
   California independent pollster Steve Teichner said results from
the two primaries also have the potential to sway several hundred
uncommitted super delegates from around the nation. Those
delegates, members of Congress and other party leaders, will go to
the national convention legally unpledged.
   In 1984, Walter Mondale and Gary Hart battled for the Democratic
nomination right up until the California and New Jersey primaries.
   Hart won in Calfornia, but Mondale _ who took New Jersey and
several smaller states that day _ emerged the overall victor.

   Red lights don't stop George Bush. The
vice president's limousine glides along under state police escort,
with cars pulling over to make way. Traffic signals are ignored;
the curious crane their necks.
   Bush is hoping Tuesday's Illinois primary will be just as smooth
a ride.
   Although heavily favored to win the state's Republican contest,
with 82 delegates at stake, the vice president nonetheless has been
spending 12-hour days on the campaign trail.
   But on the stump his targets are no longer Republican rivals
like Bob Dole, the Kansas senator he crushed in the primaries of
Super Tuesday. Instead, Bush is aiming his rhetoric at Democrats.
   ``I've never seen such a gloomy bunch,'' Bush said of the
Democrats, as he spoke to 500 people at a Republican Party dinner
here. ``Everything they said about our country is negative _
midnight in America.''
   Bush, by contrast, is upbeat. He ought to be _ he's so far ahead
of Dole that the Chicago Tribune has quit polling on the Republican
side.
   At a stop in a campaign office in Libertyville, Bush and Gov.
James R. Thompson, who has been accompanying him around the state,
made phone calls to try to round up votes.
   ``We're putting the hard sell on,'' Bush said into the
telephone. ``We're at the grass-roots stage now.''
   At stop after stop, Bush delivers his message _ along with a
series of one-liners.
   He said his success on Super Tuesday ``gave new meaning to the
words Southern Comfort.'' He tells crowds he's got the support of
the ``James Gang'' _ Thompson, Illinois Secretary of State Jim
Edgar and Cook County Sheriff James O'Grady.
   His standard speech includes pledges to trim the deficit in four
years through tight spending, and to be tough with the Soviets.
   He says he expects criticism from the Democrats over the
Iran-Contra affair _ he got some Sunday, from Albert Gore Jr., who
said Bush had never fully explained his role in the matter.
   Bush, who says he has answered all questions about the matter
except his private advice to the president on secret arms sales,
said he wasn't worried about Democrats harping on Iran-Contra.
   ``They'll raise it,'' he said. ``Of course they will. So what?''
   The Democrats, he said, lack knowledge of foreign affairs.
   ``I can't wait to debate any one of those Democrats on foreign
policy. None of them have had any experience except when they had
breakfast at the International House of Pancakes,'' he said.
   He touches on the matter indirectly, perhaps, when he warns
voters to expect to find a few warts.
   ``I might make a mistake here and there,'' Bush said, ``but I've
had enough experience I wouldn't do it like Yogi Berra did. They
asked Yogi what went wrong when the Mets lost a few ball games. He
said `We made the wrong mistakes.'''
   ``You've got to think about it,'' Bush said. ``Anybody's going
to make mistakes.''
   In the bleachers at St. Viator High School in Arlington Heights,
Scott Bieda, 30, held his 1{-year-old daughter and nodded in
agreement.
   ``I like what I hear,'' he said. ``Those are the issues that are
important to me: bargaining from strength and tackling the deficit.
But you can say anything now. The proof is in the pudding. We'll
see what happens if he gets in.''

<DATELINE>BETHLEHEM, Occupied West Bank (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A mass resignation of Arab
policemen has displayed the muscle of the PLO and posed a security
dilemma for Israel and Palestinians alike in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip.
   A national police spokesman, Yehoshua Goldapfel, on Sunday said
that 450 of the 850 Arab police in the occupied territories ``have
asked to leave the force.'' He left open the possibility more would
depart.
   The police control crime and direct traffic, but they are not
used to quell Arab rioting in the occupied lands, now in its fourth
month.
   Arab officers in Bethlehem said all 70 Arab policemen would be
off the job today at the city's headquarters office for the
southern half of the West Bank. As a shift ended at noon Sunday,
newly retired officers drifted from the station in jeans and
jackets into the central Manger Square. A dozen Israeli soldiers in
riot gear stood watch beside a phalanx of huge tour buses.
   ``I will be left without a job, without income,'' said traffic
officer Mohammed Abu Ghayada, who spent 12 of his 36 years on the
force. He said he might try driving a taxi.
   ``The people have decided, and we go with the decision of the
Palestinian people,'' said policeman Fadl Najajri, a 15-year
veteran and a father of nine.
   The walkout was triggered by a communique issued March 10 by the
Palestine Liberation Organization and clandestine local leaders of
the violent protests against Israeli rule of the West Bank and Gaza
Strip.
   The message was driven home for some officers by the March 8
stabbing death of a Palestinian policeman in Jericho accused of
cooperating too closely with Israeli authorities.
   ``The killing in Jericho made me decide very quickly,'' said a
33-year-old policeman who gave his name only as Ramis.
   The National Police Commissioner, David Krauss, told Israel
radio on Sunday: ``There's pressure on them from the outside and a
system of threats. But each one of them is organizing his friends,
and we'll deal with them.''
   He did not specify how.
   The resignations threaten to open wider cracks in Israel's
territorial administration, which employs 18,000 Arabs and is an
important buffer between Israelis and the already rebellious
Palestinians.
   ``It is a precedent for many more civil servants to resign,''
said Bethlehem Mayor Elias Freij.
   Forty tax collectors in the Gaza Strip quit last week under
pressure from underground organizers.
   Rioters in the village of Qabatiyeh on Feb. 24 lynched an
alleged Israeli collaborator who opened fire on a crowd nearing his
house and killed a child.
   Authorities punished Qatabiyeh by banning visits of family
members from abroad and forbidding the town's major export of stone
to Jordan.
   Authorities also demolished houses of people accused of
involvement in attacks on alleged collaborators.
   ``Such methods will be used against villages and groups we know
are involved in attacks on people who are considered to be
collaborators or people who are cooperating with authorities,''
said a senior military spokesman.
   But he also admitted on Sunday that Israel ``cannot provide 100
percent security'' to all people who work with authorities.
   Police spokesman Nahum Mendel on Sunday termed the police
resignations ``a big problem,'' and said authorities discussed
offering pay raises to keep veteran officers.
   Several Arab officers said Israeli superiors had offered to
double their pay, now $400 to $500 a month, if they would stay. All
said they refused.
   Arab businessmen also are worried by the disappearance of local
protectors.
   ``The authorities will not bring any Israeli police to this
area. There will be no law here,'' said Rabah Abdeen, owner of a
plastics factory and a gasoline station in Bethlehem.
   An Israeli spokesman in the Bethlehem head office said police in
Ramallah, 10 miles north of Jerusalem, were unable to respond to a
major traffic accident on Sunday.
   ``I feel abandoned when out of 80 people at the station, only
six of us were left,'' the Ramallah district commander, Miko
Bachar, said on Israel Television. He said all six were Israeli
officers.
   Freij also said the resignations ``will vastly affect the
process of the courts in the West Bank,'' which together with those
in the Gaza Strip handle about 200,000 cases a year, mostly
traffic-related.

   The Bechtel Group, Inc., a giant construction
company which for years quietly built billion-dollar projects in
the Middle East, is receiving unwanted attention from a grand jury
investigation of Attorney General Edwin Meese's role in a failed
Mideast pipeline deal.
   The aborted deal, to build a pipeline from Iraqi oilfields to
the Jordanian port of Aqaba, was part of what Bechtel president
Alden P. Yates called a ``project development scheme'' to boost
business in a bad market.
   Falling oil prices were devastating the international
construction business in 1984 when Bechtel began to draw up
engineering and financing plans for the $1 billion pipeline.
   ``It didn't work for geopolitical reasons,'' Yates said in a
telephone interview from Bechtel headquarters in San Francisco.
   Independent counsel James C. McKay is focusing on a possible
bribery conspiracy involving Israeli officials, Bruce Rappaport, a
Swiss businessman involved with Bechtel in the deal, Meese and E.
Robert Wallach, a close friend of Meese hired by Rappaport to
garner administration backing for the project.
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz, who was president of
Bechtel before joining the Reagan administration in 1982, recused
himself from any role in the pipeline negotiations, opening the way
for Meese to become the pivotal Cabinet official in the deal.
Former Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger, who served as Bechtel's
general counsel under Shultz, appears to have played no role in the
deal.
   In addition to the unwelcome publicity over the pipeline deal,
Bechtel continues to have problems of a different nature, the same
ones that drove it into the politically risky Aqaba pipeline deal.
   Lower oil prices, the dearth of nuclear projects and debt in the
developing world have curtailed Bechtel's trademark leviathan deals.
   ``People characterize us as not willing to take on little
projects, but that's not true any more,'' said Yates.
   Bechtel's business jumped from $7.6 billion in 1980 to an
average of $13 billion annually 1981-83, and back down to $8.6
billion in 1984. It has fallen more gradually since then, forcing
the company to seek new markets.
   Bechtel's ``mega projects,'' those costing above $50 million,
have dropped from 96 in 1983 to 73 in 1986.
   Yates declined to discuss the specifics of the pipeline case
because it is under investigation, but he said it fit into a larger
pattern under which Bechtel officials sought to spot potential
jobs, prepare engineering reports and arrange financing for
prospective clients.
   Along these lines, Bechtel since 1985 has been studying the
possibility of building a second Panama Canal, said Yates.
   ``The Iraq-Jordan pipeline was a `project development scheme,'''
said Yates. ``In the old days, an oil company would send out a
request for a project, and we would do it. Now we doing project
development, looking at the stuff way upstream.''
   In the pipeline deal, Bechtel sought out a partner in Rappaport,
who owns oil refineries and tankers, and asked him to secure
promises from Israeli officials that they would not attack the
pipeline, said company spokesman Al Donner.
   Wallach, hired by Rappaport, wrote a memo to Meese on Sept. 25,
1985, saying that Rappaport had confirmed an arrangement with
Israel's then-prime minister Shimon Peres that ``Israel will
receive somewhere between $65-$70 million a year for 10 years out
of the conclusion of the project.
   ``What is also indicated to me, and which would be denied
everywhere, is that a portion of those funds will go directly to
Labor,'' wrote Wallach, in an apparent reference to Peres' Labor
Party.
   Meese and his lawyers deny that the wording referred to a bribe
_ the allegation the special prosecutor is investigating.
   Iraqi officials informed Bechtel in a letter dated Dec. 31,
1985, that they were dissatisfied with security arrangements and
that the deal was off, said Donner.
   Other deals have gone bad for Bechtel. New orders fell from $13
billion in 1980 to $3.5 billion in 1986, the most recent year for
which full statistics are available. And the payroll is down from a
high of 45,000 to fewer than 18,000, according to company
officials. They declined to provide profit figures.
   The company still prefers massive projects, but has expanded
into such new areas as computerized factories, space and weapons
technology and toxic waste cleanup, said Yates.
   ``If you can do a $1 billion job, it is easier than doing ten
$100 million jobs,'' he said in a succinct statement of the Bechtel
credo.
   Bechtel still pulls down its share of big jobs worldwide.
   Its engineers are involved in the $9.6 billion project to build
the Eurotunnel under the English channel. Bechtel also is building
a $3.3 billion tunnel project in Boston and a $2.7 billion project
to develop a new central terminal at New York's Kennedy
International Airport.

   Nine-year-old Celeste has big brown eyes and
long brown hair. She also has no mother, no father, no little
brother and almost no hope.
   ``All in all, she's been one of the lucky ones,'' says Anita
Septimus, head of social services at the Albert Einstein College of
Medicine, which runs the nation's largest pediatric AIDS clinic.
   Celeste is among a growing number of children who are victims of
congenital AIDS. They must pay with their future for a parent's
past _ a problem that becomes more common as the disease enters the
heterosexual population.
   Both of Celeste's parents were intravenous drug users who
contracted AIDS; her mother died in 1983, her father died last
year. Celeste and her brother were infected in the uterus. He died
Christmas Eve.
   Every two weeks, to assist and extend her fragile life, Celeste
is given treatments of gamma globulin, blood serum that contains a
high concentration of antibodies.
   She is the oldest youngster of more than a dozen treated there.
Some, less than a year old, are born to die; others face years of
battling the disease and the cruel ostracism that often surrounds
it. In either case, the prognosis for such children remains
invariably pessimistic, specialists say.
   ``We have never seen anybody who has beaten the disease,''
Einstein's Dr. Larry Bernstein said recently. ``I think you get to
a certain point and hope you can stay there, not deteriorate
further.''
   Recent state Health Department figures indicate the potential
number of AIDS-infected newborns is growing at a startling rate.
One in every 61 babies born in New York City last November carried
antibodies to the AIDS virus, which means they had been exposed to
the virus.
   About 40 percent of these children will develop acquired immune
deficiency syndrome in some form; 25 percent to 30 percent of those
children will be dead before their second birthday. Most of them
were born to mothers who used drugs intravenously.
   Dr. Stephen Joseph, the city health commissioner, put the number
of children born in the city with AIDS antibodies last year at
about 600; for 1988 the projection is 1,000. Between 1980 and 1986,
the total was only about 250 children.
   In fact, AIDS babies were cited as the reason for the first
increase in New York City's infant mortality rate since 1974.
   One reason for the spurt is the large number of addicts in New
York City. Intravenous drug abusers make up almost half the city's
AIDS population while in San Francisco and most other cities with
large AIDS populations, most sufferers are homosexual.
   But even in Massachusetts, a state not known for large outbreaks
of AIDS, one in 476 child-bearing women tested positive for AIDS
antibodies, according to a study reported recently in the New
England Journal of Medicine.
   Nationwide, there were 865 cases of pediatric AIDS reported as
of Feb. 29, with 111 diagnosed in just the first two months of the
year. Altogether, 518 children are known to have died of AIDS.
   The Bronx Municipal Hospital Day Care Center, the nation's first
day care facility for AIDS-infected children, opened in June 1986
to help out; Septimus said another is planned for Einstein.
   Sixty-five percent of the Einstein kids live in foster homes,
she said. But some have spent so much time in hospitals, in broken
homes or at arm's length from a terrified society that social
skills like speaking have not been properly developed.
   In fact, they say the children remain innocent victims to the
end, never realizing they were born without much of a chance.
   ``Some of the older kids have a sense of it, but even the ones
who are older have physical delays _ an 8-year-old with the
intelligence of a 5-year-old,'' said Bernstein.
   ``But we don't have that many older kids, so we don't know.''

   ``Come on everybody _ let's do the conga!'' was the
rallying cry for more than 120,000 people who lined up at Little
Havana's Calle Ocho festival and danced into the record books.
   About 1.5 million people were jammed along 23 blocks of Eighth
Street (Calle Ocho in Spanish) on Sunday when Gloria Estefan and
the Miami Sound Machine set about forming a conga line.
   ``Is everybody ready? Let's conga,'' said Ms. Estefan as her
band began playing their hit ``Conga.'' People began to grab the
shoulders in front of them and sidestep to the Latin beat.
   ``There's no way it could fail. As soon as the music plays, we
just grab on to somebody and hang on,'' said Nuvia Valdez, who
showed up early to take part in the historic strut.
   When it was over, Anna Nicholas of the Guinness Book of World
Records confirmed a record line of 119,986 dancers, shattering the
old mark of a 10,442-person chain formed last August in Canada. The
computer-assisted count was made by volunteers at 30 observation
posts.
   ``It may seem like a conga line is an inane thing, but it
represents a lot more,'' Ms. Estefan said. ``Because this community
is so diverse, getting along and having a street party of this
magnitude really says a lot about our city.''
   The festival began as a block party 11 years ago to showcase
Miami's Cuban culture.

   There are gadget lovers. There are cat lovers.
There are people who love home improvement projects. If enough
people fall into all three categories, the maker of the electronic
cat door is in luck.
   Reilor Inc. of Horsham, Pa. is showing off its product here at
the annual National Home Center Show, which started Sunday.
   The cat door comes with a coded collar key so only the owner's
cat can enter. The door can be programmed to open from only the
inside or only the outside, or from both sides. It's available at
pet stores for $120-$150, said Shelley Daniels, a spokeswoman for
the show.
   An estimated 36,000 retailers are expected to attend the show,
sponsored by Home Center Magazine of Lincolnshire.
   The magazine says it did a recent survey of 1,561 homeowners
across the country that found 93 percent of those households
undertook at least one home improvement project last year.
   ``U.S. homeowners seem willing to tackle almost any type of home
improvement imaginable,'' said John Berry, an official of Vance
Publishing Corp., the company producing the show.

<TEXT>
   The reigning drama of 1980 was not so much the
Carter-Reagan campaign but the interminable hostage crisis in
Tehran. The two became intertwined, and as Jimmy Carter gave up his
presidency, 52 Americans were being returned to freedom.
   ``The pain's gone; the weight's lifted,'' Dorothea Morefield
exulted as her husband ended 444 days of nerve-wracking captivity.
   ``We can all drink to this one,'' Ronald Reagan said.
   Cut to 1988. Another presidential campaign is in high gear and a
new set of Americans is held captive in the Middle East. This time
around, the hostages are bound and blindfolded far from the
political limelight; the hope is that obscurity will diminish their
value.
   For Terry Anderson, Tuesday will mark three full years as
hostage. It has been 1,094 days since Anderson, returning from a
tennis game, was shoved at gunpoint into a waiting car.
   Anderson is an old friend, your basic boy-next-door, off to see
the world in a foreign correspondent's trench coat. He has an
enviable talent for finding the story and telling it straight,
whether in Detroit or Johannesburg or Beirut.
   We spent our salad days together in AP's Detroit bureau; he
filed the state broadcast wire and lived out towards Ann Arbor with
his family and a wonderful collection of Japanese etchings. From
Michigan, he became AP's chief Middle East correspondent by way of
tours in Japan and South Africa.
   In 1984, Anderson and I had lunch in Washington and he caught me
up on the dangers and satisfaction of reporting the complex story
of Lebanon. I told him we called it ``wartornLebanon'' as if it
were one long word. He laughed.
   Now he is a part of the wartornLebanon story, longest held of
some two dozen Westerners missing in the sad city of Beirut.
   I was out pricing washing machines on Saturday, March 16, 1985,
when a radio newscast said an American reporter had been kidnapped
in Beirut. I figured it might be Terry Anderson, and it was.
   I figured he might be free by Monday, and he wasn't.
   Who would have thought a year would go by, or two, let alone
three?
   That his baby would be born and he wouldn't know? She would turn
one, learn to walk, learn to talk, and he wouldn't know. Last
spring she turned two. Is she a terrible two? Is she eating her
vegetables? He wouldn't know.
   The washing machine is three years old and Anderson is still the
property of Shiite kidnappers, currency in a geopolitical ordeal
that has killed two American hostages and threatens the remaining
eight. Terry Waite, who negotiated tirelessly for all the Western
hostages, now shares their fate.
   In March 1986, we marked the first Anderson anniversary in a
church on New York Avenue. It was an optimistic gathering; perhaps
freedom was just around the corner. Rarely had a hostage been held
so long; we hoped he was holding up.
   Jesse Jackson, who knew Anderson celebrity-to-reporter,
delivered a call for peace and brotherhood and deliverance.
   Hostage relatives expressed frustration, and more.
   ``There have been so many times that I was frightened they would
do something to them,'' Anderson's sister, Peggy Say, said of the
six Americans then in captivity. Another hostage relative, Sue
Franceschini, said, ``I'm on automatic pilot most of the time, but
we made it through the holidays.''
   Her brother, Rev. Lawrence Martin Jenco, would be released in
1986, but for others, more holidays would pass and more Americans
would be taken.
   The second Anderson anniversary was marked at a second church,
up 16th St. from the White House. The Iran-Contra story was out and
it was clear that the hostages were key pawns in a multi-level
``arms for hostages'' intrigue. Optimism? Not so you could notice.
   The third Anderson anniversary is upon us and Wednesday we
gather in a third church, this time for a candlelight and olive
branch ceremony in Georgetown. The pain, not gone. The weight, not
lifted.
   No one knows how Anderson will mark the day. He was last heard
from in a videotape on Christmas Eve, day 1,012.

<HEAD>Gore Draws On Disparate Background To Appeal To Different Groups</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Standing before an only mildly interested
crowd at a county fair in Florida last week, Democratic
presidential candidate Albert Gore Jr. introduced himself.
   ``I am the only active farmer in this race for president,'' he
said, stirring as good an applause as he got for the rest of his
speech.
   The 39-year-old Harvard-educated senator from Tennessee,
perpetually clad in a blue suit, could be accused of stretching it
a bit with that statement.
   True, home is a modest farmhouse hard by the Caney Fork River at
rural Carthage, Tenn., set amid the Gore family farm operation.
Gore, though, has hardly made his living working its soil.
   But his statement, often repeated, is emblematic of Gore as a
man of varying backgrounds and worlds who has so far been able to
balance them all.
   Gore made the leap to the top tier of Democratic presidential
candidates last week in the Super Tuesday primaries. He won six
states, five in the South plus Nevada, and accomplished his aim: to
use the biggest ever regional primary to jump-start a presidential
campaign.
   He faces the task now of backing up his claim of being more than
a regional candidate.
   While he is competing in the Illinois primary Tuesday, his hope
is to advance as the primaries move across the North, arguing that
he is the white alternative to Gov. Michael Dukakis, the delegate
leader. He depicts Dukakis as a Massachusetts liberal who, if
nominated, could cause another landslide Democratic loss.
   Now that the campaign has moved out of the South, Gore can be
expected to rely less on his rural background than on his urban
background. He has one of each.
   Gore is the son of a veteran Tennessee politician. Albert Gore
Sr. spent 32 years in Congress, first in the House and later in the
Senate, before losing his seat in 1970.
   Gore Jr. was born and educated in Washington, D.C., and attended
the elite St. Albans prep school in Washington and then Harvard.
His wife, Mary Elizabeth or ``Tipper'' as she is better known, was
a high school sweetheart in Washington.
   He was the all-American boy: bright, honors student, played
basketball and football. He was accustomed to seeing the powerful
of Washington and can tell stories as a youngster of John Kennedy
and then-Vice President Richard Nixon.
   Yet like the congressman he would become, Gore kept up his ties
back home.
   As his father faced his final battle for re-election, and his
opposition to the Vietnam War threatened his seat, Gore Jr. joined
the Army and was sent to Vietnam. He served as an Army journalist.
   He returned to Tennessee and a reporter's job at the Nashville
Tennessean, hired by the publisher himself. He entered both
divinity school and law school, not completing either. He quit law
school after two years when the House seat his father once held
came open.
   Returning to Washington as a House member himself, in 1976, and
as a senator in 1984, Gore's Eastern background served him well.
   He was singled out early on by some monied, establishment
Democrats as a young man on the move, a potential presidential
candidate.
   He was well connected and worked hard. He immersed himself in
the arcane, technical ins-and-outs of issues such as arms control,
medical technology and the space program.
   As a campaigner, Gore draws on his various backgrounds. In the
South he told country-lawyer jokes and talked about hypnotizing
chickens _ one of the rural arts he claims to have mastered.
   But he also won the endorsement of the New Republic magazine,
whose editor was a former teacher of his at Harvard.
   Gore has also moved among Nashville's country music crowd. He
campaigned with country singer Johnny Cash, and rubbed elbows with
hard-living country rebel Hank Williams Jr. Yet his wife Tipper has
led a campaign against raw lyrics in rock music, a campaign that
has stirred opposition from some parts of the entertainment and
music industry.
   The Gores have four children, ages 5 through 14, who live and go
to school in suburban Washington. Gore sometimes brings along one
or more of his children on campaign trips, without their mother,
including 5-year-old Albert.
   Gore will turn 40 on March 31. If elected, he would be the
youngest president ever, following the oldest. He often makes the
comparison to young John Kennedy following the elderly Dwight
Eisenhower in 1960.
   Despite a voting record decidedly more liberal than some of
Tennessee's other representatives, Gore won election to the Senate
overwhelmingly four years ago when Republican Howard Baker declined
to run again.
   Whenever a questioner challenge's Gore's claim to be a moderate,
or his credentials as a son of the South, Gore recalls that 1984
election. Gore won 61 percent of the vote, running ahead of even
Ronald Reagan, who got 58 percent of Tennessee's vote.

<HEAD>Thieves Or Murderers: Salvadorans Slinging Mud In Election
Campaign</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   To judge from the vitriolic
campaign, Salvadorans have a choice between thieves and murderers
when they cast their ballots in legislative and municipal elections
next Sunday.
   Tough campaigning has been common in El Salvador in the years
when civilian politics has prevailed over the exercise of power by
force of arms.
   But this time around the denigration of opposing parties'
candidates and institutions has eclipsed most attempts to inform
the electorate of proposals for resolving this tiny Central
American country's tremendous problems.
   At stake are all 60 seats in the Legislative Assembly and the
mayorships and councils of 262 municipalities nationwide. About 1.9
million of the country's 5 million people are eligible to vote.
   The governing Christian Democrats are expected to lose their
majority in the assembly and such a defeat would turn President
Jose Napoleon Duarte's last year in office into an uphill climb.
   ``The election campaign is poisoning the country, deepening
resentment and hate and putting even farther off the reconciliation
of a divided people,'' said Rafael Moreno Guillen in his column in
La Prensa Grafica, the nation's most widely read paper.
   Monsignor Gregorio Rosa Chavez, auxiliary bishop of San
Salvador, said in his homily Sunday: ``We would like to be able to
say that the politicians offer a clear alternative to the violent
methods that affect innocent people. But the political forum has
likewise been converted into a war of insults.''
   The party expected to make the biggest gains is the Republican
Nationalist Alliance, or Arena, an ultra-rightist group. Prominent
Christian Democrats have conceded they have little chance of
retaining their majority.
   Adolfo Rey Prendes, the front-runner for the Christian
Democratic presidential nomination, predicted at a recent news
conference that his party would lose eight of its current 33 seats
in the assembly. Presidential elections are scheduled for next year.
   Rey Prendes attributed the decline to ``the natural erosion of
support experienced by a party that governs in difficult times.''
   El Salvador is suffering in its eighth year of a civil war that
has killed about 65,000 people, displaced 500,000 and ravaged its
economy.
   The leftist guerrilla alliance battling the U.S.-supported
government has denounced the elections as a farce and declared the
voting will not be allowed to proceed in the northern and eastern
regions under rebel control.
   El Salvador receives more U.S. aid than any country in the
Western hemisphere. Economic and military aid last year was more
than $500 million.
   The military said last week it could guarantee voting in 244 of
the 262 municipalities. Defense Minister Gen. Carlos Vides Casanova
said 40,000 troops will be deployed to guard against any guerrilla
attempts to disrupt the voting.
   Eight parties _ all centrist or rightist _ are presenting
candidates, but only three are competing nationwide. Left-of-center
parties declined to participate, citing lack of security for their
candidates.
   Rightist death squads killed several thousand leftist union and
political activists in El Salvador in the early 1980s. Human rights
groups say the squads remain intact, and the Roman Catholic Church
recently denounced what it said was an increase in the number of
politically motivated murders.
   Arena and its founder, retired army Maj. Roberto d'Aubuisson,
have been linked to the death squads since the party's formation in
1982.
   At a recent Christian Democratic campaign rally in Panchimalco,
six miles south of San Salvador, speakers repeatedly referred to
D'Aubuisson's group as ``torturers'' and ``killers.''
   Arena, for its part, calls the PDC _ the Christian Democratic
Party's initials in Spanish _ the party of the corrupt.
   Arena, which has 13 legislators in the current assembly, is not
expected to win an outright majority. But most observers believe it
will win almost as many seats as the Christian Democratic Party.
   That could leave the National Conciliation Party _ the third
group competing nationwide _ with the balance of power.
   The rightist National Conciliation Party was formed by the
military and governed for nearly 20 years before a 1979 coup. It
formed an alliance with Arena in the 1985 legislative elections.
   But the National Conciliation Party, in an effort to portray
itself as moderate, eschewed the alliance this time around.
``Against the death squads and the thieves, PCN,'' has been its
slogan in this campaign.
   The Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, which groups five
rebel organizations, said in a communique last month:
   ``The country has lost its sovereignty (to the United States)
and democracy does not exist. Rather there is a new kind of
military dictatorship with a civilian facade. Without independence,
no election is legitimate.''

   Stocks closed lower and the dollar fell against the
Japanese yen in Tokyo on Monday as dealers' expectations for U.S.
trade figures due out on Thursday grew more pessimistic.
   The dollar closed at 127.23 yen, down 0.57 yen from Friday's
close of 127.80 yen.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues closed at 25,433.51 points, down 110.22 points, or
0.43 percent, from Friday's close.
   Dealers said the dollar fell due to speculation that figures for
the United States' trade deficit for January would be higher than
previously expected.
   Traders on the stock market were also waiting for the U.S. trade
figures, according to an analyst with a major brokerage who spoke
on condition of anonymity. ``Trading was not so heavy in the first
section, aside from some heavy industrials, steel and
electricals,'' the analyst said.

   The record high subsidies paid out by the
Agriculture Department all went to farmers, right? Not quite, says
the General Accounting Office.
   In the last three fiscal years, according to GAO, net cash
outlays for farm price and income support programs totaled about
$67 billion. Of that amount, farmers got about 80 percent, or $53
billion.
   The GAO, an investigative agency of Congress, provided a
breakdown of recent farm program costs in a report requested by
Rep. Bill Alexander, D-Ark.
   The GAO divided the record fiscal 1987 cash outlay of more than
$25.8 billion into two parts: about $23.5 billion in ``commodity
specific'' expenditures such as deficiency payments, loans and
storage payments, and $2.36 billion in ``non-commodity specific''
items, including export programs, conservation payments and
operating expense.
   Overall, four commodities _ corn, wheat, dairy and cotton _
account for most of the program costs registered by the
department's Commodity Credit Corp. In fiscal 1987, for example,
when the total was $25.8 billion, corn and other feed grains
accounted for $12.2 billion; wheat, $3.44 billion; dairy, $2.34
billion; and cotton, $2.14 billion.
   The GAO report said that of the $25.8 billion total in fiscal
1987, farmers received $20.6 billion.
   ``While farmers received most of the support program's outlays,
it is unknown how much of those outlays went to individual farmers
versus farmers organized under some other business structure,'' the
report said. ``Farmers organize, operate and receive the support
program outlays as any one of various business entities.''
   The report added that those entities can include individual
proprietorship, partnership, association, cooperative, corporation,
trust or estate. Moreover, investigators said they were told that
USDA does not maintain records of farm program outlays by the
various types of farm businesses.
   ``Farmers receive the support program outlays as producers of
the supported agricultural commodities regardless of their business
structure,'' the report said.
   About $3.9 billion went to non-farmers in fiscal 1986. Those
included ``commercial operators engaged in farming-related
activities, or to other recipients who may or may not be farmers''
for a variety of reasons, including direct purchases of
commodities, storage and handling, transportation, and claims under
export guarantee programs.
   Operating expenses and related administrative costs added $2.3
billion to the 1987 total. But the 1987 operation of CCC also
include around $1 million in proceeds from sales of commodities,
with that amount credited against the other outlays.

   The Census Bureau says farmers should remember
to return their survey questionnaires describing 1987 operations.
   Although the form was due on Feb. 1, the bureau said it
recognizes that some may be running late. Besides, the law requires
it.
   ``Use your best estimates if you don't have the information in
your records,'' the Commerce Department agency said. ``Return your
forms to the Census Bureau even if you did not grow any crops, or
have any livestock, poultry or other agricultural products in 1987,
so the bureau can correct its records.''
   Officials said if help is needed, call the Census Bureau's
toll-free number, 1-800-233-6132. Indiana residents should call
1-800-233-6135.
   ``You may also obtain help from local offices of the Cooperative
Extension Service, Soil Conservation Service, Agricultural
Stabilization and Conservation Service, Farmers Home
Administration, and vocational agriculture teachers,'' the agency
said.
   The federal law requiring farmers and ranchers to respond to the
census ``also protects the privacy of their reports,'' the bureau
said.

   Government trade figures show U.S.
agricultural exports in the first three months of the 1988 fiscal
year were on target with Agriculture Department projections.
   The value of shipments in the first quarter of the year that
began Oct. 1 was estimated at $8.46 billion, up 10 percent from the
pace of a year earlier, according to the department's Foreign
Agricultural Service.
   Department officials have forecast 1987-88 exports at $32.5
billion, up from $27.9 billion in 1986-87.
   The actual volume of shipments in the first quarter was reported
at 36.2 million tons, up 11 percent from a year earlier. For the
year, those are expected to total about 142.5 million metric tons,
up from 129.2 million tons in 1986-87.
   ``Strong wheat sales to the Soviet Union and China, strong corn
sales to the Soviet Union, South Korea and Japan, as well as
improved soybean sales to Brazil, strengthened export volume,'' the
agency said in a recent trade report.

<HEAD>Crime Rate Stable Third Straight Year</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETE YOST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some 34.4 million crimes were committed in the
United States in 1987, the third straight year of stable crime
levels, according to a government survey.
   Since 1980, violent crimes have fallen from 33 per 1,000 U.S.
residents to 28, thefts from 83 to 68 per 1,000, and household
crimes from 227 to 168, the Bureau of Justice Statistics said in a
report Sunday.
   Crime levels overall rose a statistically insignificant 0.9
percent last year from 34.1 million in 1986.
   ``Total crime has remained stable during the last three years''
and remains at a 14-year low, according to BJS director Stephen
Schlesinger.
   There were 5.5 million violent crimes in 1987, up 0.4 percent
from the previous year. Thefts totaled 13.45 million last year, up
1.7 percent from 1986. Household crimes of burglary, larceny and
auto theft totaled 15.4 million, up 0.4 percent from the previous
year. Only motor vehicle thefts grew significantly, by 15 percent
to an estimated 1.6 million.
   Some criminologists had been predicting continued declines in
crime levels for a few more years, based on the fact that the most
crime-prone age group continues to shrink in size. Those
researchers predict an increase in crime in the early 1990s as the
children of parents born during the post-World War II baby boom
move into the 14- to 24-year-old age bracket in significant
numbers. The crime-prone 14- to 24-year-old age group totaled 42.5
million in 1986, down nearly 4 million from the 1979 peak.
   One factor that could have caused the decline of crime rate in
the early 1980s to stabilize may be increased use of serious drugs,
said Alfred Blumstein, dean of the school of urban and public
affairs at Carnegie-Mellon University in Pittsburgh.
   Illicit drug use among criminal defendants is high and seems to
be on the increase, Justice Department officials said last month at
a news conference.
   Another possibility, Blumstein said, may be that people now in
their late teen years are disproportionately from a low-income
population, which traditionally has shown more involvement in the
crimes measured by the national survey.

<HEAD>Congressional Aides Hold Secret Meeting with Arafat</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOAN MOWER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some lawmakers say they think a group of
congressional aides used bad judgment in attending a secret meeting
in January with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
   ``It was very foolish,'' Rep. Larry Smith, D-Fla., said last
week after the meeting became public. ``That was the wrong thing to
do.''
   The two-hour meeting with Arafat, arranged by the National
Council on U.S.-Arab Relations, took place in Baghdad, Iraq, a few
weeks after Congress passed legislation closing the Palestine
Liberation Organization offices in the United States on the grounds
the PLO supports terrorism. Arafat heads the PLO.
   Ronald W. Cathell, executive director of the council, said the
meeting was constructive because it gave the congressional aides a
chance to see Arafat in the flesh and conduct a ``candid,
forthright'' discussion with him.
   In response to a question from one Capitol Hill staff member,
Arafat told the group the man he admired most in history was Saint
Peter because the disciple of Jesus ``conquered Rome by winning the
hearts'' of f the staffers. He said
they could be subjected to reprisals.
   People with knowledge of the free trip said those who went to
Iraq worked for Sens. Mark Hatfield, R-Ore.; John Heinz, R-Pa.; J.
Bennett Johnston, D-La., David Karnes, R-Neb; and Reps. Edward F.
Feighan, D-Ohio; Robert Torricelli, D-N.J.; Helen Bentley, R-Md.;
Douglas Bereuter, R-Neb.; William Clay, D-Mo.; James Inhofe,
R-Okla., and Robert Lagomarsino, R-Calif.
   All but one of the aides on the trip attended the Arafat
meeting, a State Department official said, speaking on condition he
remain anonymous.
   Several aides who traveled to Iraq refused to talk about what
happened in the meeting, and would only discuss the trip if their
names were not used. After the Arafat meeting, group members
realized the significance of their action and made a pact to keep
it secret, one said.
   Rep. Robert G. Torricelli, D-N.J., said he was upset when he
learned an aide had seen Arafat without his permission.
   ``She acted independently, and I had no knowledge of this
meeting nor would I have approved it, and I remain very disturbed
about it.'' The staffer no longer works for Torricelli, but left
for personal reasons unrelated to the meeting.
   Feighan, however, was unconcerned. He said his assistant ``was
not on any official trip and he was traveling in a personal
capacity.''
   But several Capitol Hill staffers who deal exclusively with
foreign policy _ the Middle East in particular _ said they never
would have accepted the invitation in view of U.S. policy.
   The meeting was ``extremely unwise when as a matter of law
American officials are not supposed to negotiate with the PLO,''
said Michael Van Dusen, staff director of the House Foreign Affairs
subcommittee on Europe and the Middle East.
   The policy _ imposed by Congress _ prohibits officials in the
executive branch from negotiating with the PLO until the group
recognizes Israel's right to exist.
   But the policy does not apply to Congress, and a few lawmakers
as well as staff members have met openly with Arafat in the past.
Rep. Nick Rahall, D-W.Va., for example, saw Arafat in a bunker in
West Beirut in Lebanon in 1982.
   Torricelli complained that the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad failed to
advise his aide about U.S. policy on the PLO. But a State
Department official, refusing to be identified by name, said the
U.S. ambassador had tried to dissuade the Americans from meeting
with Arafat. No embassy personnel went to the session.
   The original agenda did not list an Arafat meeting. Once the
group arrived in Baghdad, Cathell said he learned the PLO leader
was in town and broached the possibility of a meeting with the
congressional aides.
   The staffers were never pressured to attend the meeting, Cathell
said. Instead they were told, ``It's totally up to you,'' he said.
   One aide, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the group was
given less than an hour's notice that a face-to-face meeting with
Arafat had been set.
   The national council seeks to promote understanding between
Americans and Arabs, and receives its money from grants and private
and corporate contributions.

   The rat pack is back.
   Frank Sinatra, Sammy Davis Jr. and Dean Martin, reunited for a
29-city, 40-show tour Sunday night, brought their unique blend of
fun times and good tunes to the old fans who loved 'em way back
when and young fans who'd never had the chance.
   ``How long have I been on?'' deadpanned Martin after walking
absent-mindedly onto stage holding a cigarette and a glass of
bourbon at the start of the sold-out concert.
   He then sang ``When You're Smiling,'' changing the last word to
drinking. To rousing applause and a few shouts of ``louder,'' he
then sang ``Bourbon From Heaven.''
   Davis, flashing his trademark gold jewelry hanging in chains
down his chest, was given a standing ovation for ``I've Got to Be
Me,'' his signature song.
   Davis drew applause when he mentioned he'd been in show business
59 years and had been sober for three years.
   The crowd applauded enthusiastically when he performed songs
such as ``Candy Man'' and ``What Kind of Fool am I?''
   Sinatra was the real crowd pleaser, drawing huge ovations from
the packed house when he belted out such favorites as ``For Once In
My Life,'' ``Mack the Knife,'' ``You are the Sunshine of My Life,''
and ``New York, New York.''
   Davis and Martin rejoined Sinatra for the closing finale, which
featured a lot of kidding along with medleys of pop favorites from
the last four decades.
   ``As far as we're concerned,'' said Davis to Sinatra, ``and I
can say this for both of us, you're still the chairman of the
board.''
   Martin added, ``Yeah, you're still the chairman, we're still
bored.''
   The tour's opening show at the sold-out Oakland Coliseum also
marked the 48th anniversary of Sinatra's first stage show: a 1940
appearance at New York's Paramount Theatre with big band leader
Tommy Dorsey.
   ``The three of us, we love each other, and we have more fun than
the audience,'' Martin said when the tour was announced in January.
   ``We're going to cities where none of those people have ever,
never, seen anything like us.''
   The 70-year-old joker vowed to get the audience laughing ``and
then they will continue laughing while these guys sing.''
   Davis and Sinatra, age 62 and 72 respectively, first appeared
with Martin at the Sands Hotel in Las Vegas in January 1960. They
made frequent guest appearances in each others' shows and made a
number of films together, including such box office hits as
``Ocean's Eleven,'' ``Sergeants Three,'' and ``Robin and the Seven
Hoods.''
   Alameda County Supervisor Charles Santana and his wife, Doris,
were among the 14,500 fans at the concert, many of whom decked
themselves out in evening and cocktail dresses and sports coats and
suits. They said they have been fans of Sinatra since the late 40s.
   Mrs. Santana said she was so devoted to her idol that ``my
mother always said I was the one who made him famous.''
   ``I've seen Frank Sinatra before, and I grew up listening to his
music,'' said Lydia Cox, 26, of Oakland. Her 35-year-old brother,
Charles, said he came to watch the fun.
   ``This is a once-in-a-lifetime thing,'' he said. ``If I didn't
see them now I'd never get another chance.''
   The trio picked up the ``rat pack'' moniker after actor Humphrey
Bogart used that label for a large group of entertainers that lived
in the same area of Beverly Hills.
   For the last two decades, they've performed mainly in the glitzy
showrooms of Atlantic City and Las Vegas. Sinatra has joked that
the troupers wanted to go on tour so that ``people could see how
bad we are.''
   The idea of touring surfaced when the three longtime friends
gathered at Sinatra's house. It became possible because all three
are under contract to Bally Corp.
   The shows, with top tickets going for $40, will be backed up by
a 35-piece orchestra. Home Box Office plans to broadcast a special
on the show later.
   Davis, Martin and Sinatra are among a growing number of aging
superstars whose careers only seem stronger with age.
   Comics Danny Thomas, Milton Berle and Sid Caeser recently
appeared in a made-for-television movie, ``Side By Side.'' Rodney
Dangerfield, Mort Sahl and Jackie Mason have all found themselves
under contract for one-man shows.
   And then there's George Burns, 92, who has a new movie coming
out in April. He's booked to play the London Paladium when he turns
100.
   In a recent interview for USA Weekend, Burns offered a few kind
words for the rat pack: ``I'm sure those three kids will make it. I
think Sinatra has potential. He just has to build some confidence.
All three will be big stars if they keep working at it.''
   The ``Together Again'' tour continues in Vancouver, B.C., on
Tuesday, Seattle on Wednesday, and Chicago on Friday and Saturday.

   It comes as a small but meaningful reward
to Peggy Say that the people in her hometown are rallying behind
her call to remember the hostages in Lebanon.
   There were many times when it seemed people didn't want to hear
about how her brother, journalist Terry Anderson, was still being
held. There was the stinging criticism that maybe she was somehow
to blame for his prolonged captivity.
   It's different now. Her brother's defiant expression is seen on
posters in the stores and restaurants of this rural upstate town 40
miles east of Buffalo.
   The posters say: ``Remember Terry Anderson on the anniversary of
his captivity, March 16, 1988. Please wear a yellow ribbon and pray
for the hostages in Lebanon.''
   Prayer services, a rally and a candlelight march down main
street are scheduled to mark the beginning of the fourth year of
captivity for the 40-year-old Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press.
   ``This is the first time we've gotten this kind of support,''
said Mrs. Say. ``People just assumed that the government's quiet
diplomacy was the answer. Now, I think they realize it isn't
working.''
   Many of this week's activities in Batavia, where Anderson grew
up, have been organized by the Rev. Thomas Vickers, pastor and
friend of the Say family. Vickers asked florists to donate ribbon
to decorate downtown. While most of the town's seven florists
agreed, one shop provided more than 2 miles of yellow ribbon.
   Inside John Hamel's flower shop are thousands of yellow bows,
hung on garlands, that are being handed out to residents who
request them. Hamel said that it was ``just a small thing'' he
could do to help.
   A nun at Notre Dame High School has made a huge greeting card
that will be on display at the Genesee Country Mall beginning
Saturday so that residents can sign it. It will be sent to Lebanon.
   Mrs. Say's daughter, Melody Brewington, said the turnout for an
observance of the anniversary last year was disappointing. This
time the response has been overwhelming, she said.
   Mrs. Say will not be here, but at the Holy Trinity Church in
Washington, D.C., for a service for hostage family members.
   ``I wish I could be here, too,'' she said. ``There has been such
an outpouring of concern. It would please Terry so much to know
that people really haven't forgotten him.''
   There are 22 foreigners, including nine Americans, missing and
believed held by Moslem fundamentalists in Lebanon. Anderson has
been held the longest.
   From ex-hostages and other sources, Mrs. Say has learned that
her brother is being held alone in a windowless room, fighting the
boredom and loneliness of his solitary existence. He is often
blindfolded and has been beaten and harassed.
   Mrs. Say has been tireless in calling for more to be done for
the hostages.
   ``If they (the hostages) are no longer important to the people
of America or this administration, then (the captors) will think
they have to make a political statement by executing them. That's
what waits for them if all of us don't keep them alive in the
public eye.''

<HEAD>Jackson Campaign Could Move Into Financial Big Leagues</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jesse Jackson likes to say he has the ``poor
campaign with a rich message,'' but he may have to alter that
slogan a bit if his fund-raising trends continue.
   Jackson's mail consultant Mal Warwick said that while Jackson is
not in the league of other multi-million-dollar presidential
contenders, the response to his mail solicitations is so
overwhelming that Warwick has had to increase his 12-person
money-counting staff to 30 over the past two months.
   It is too early to tell how Jackson's strong showing in the
Super Tuesday states will affect his contributions, Warwick said.
But he added, ``Money has been coming in so far ahead of
projections that we are struggling to keep up with it.''
   The mail results have grown steadily since last fall, when about
$150,000 per month was coming in, said campaign treasurer Howard
Renzi. That increased to about $270,000 in January.
   And in February, the month when primaries and caucuses began,
$400,000 of the $750,000 the campaign raised came in through the
mail, Renzi said.
   ``We're starting to approach the time where we'll have the
financial wherewithal to be more competitive,'' he said, adding
that a good part of the money raised by mail is going back into the
mail program to develop a bigger base of contributors.
   Jackson still has a long way to go to catch up with Democratic
money leader Michael Dukakis, who had raised some $15 million by
the end of January, including federal matching funds, to Jackson's
$3.3 million.
   Jackson has made much of the fact that he has done well despite
being outspent by as much as 30 times in states where his opponents
put on heavy media campaigns.
   But his sophisticated mail program is producing results that
were unheard of in Jackson's 1984 campaign, when taking a
collection at revival-style rallies was his most frequent
fund-raising approach.
   Warwick runs a state-of-the-art direct mail and telemarketing
operation, utilizing lists of names purchased from other mail
soliciters to determine which categories of people would be most
likely to give to Jackson.
   ``We're using every technique in the book,'' he said, and
sending mail to a broad spectrum of progressive Democrats. The mail
includes everything from postcards to sophisticated packets and
questionnaires through first-class mail.
   In addition to the mail, Jackson's campaign chairman Willie
Brown, influential speaker of the California state assembly, said
there will be a series of concerts to raise money in the weeks to
come. Brown, one of the most successful fund-raisers in California
politics, also said this week he will try to extract $1 million
from the state's ``bleeding hearts'' whom he said should be giving
money to Jackson.
   Warwick said about one mailing per week goes out, ranging in
size from 5,000 pieces to previous contributors, to 400,000 pieces
in a search for new donors.
   ``The results we are obtaining are as strong as anything I've
ever witnessed in all my time of direct mail fund-raising,''
Warwick said.
   Warwick's Berkeley, Calif., firm, Changing America, Inc.,
handled direct mail for the presidential campaign of Gary Hart last
year before Hart dropped out of the race the first time, and has
several liberal organizations as clients.
   One ``Dear Fellow American Citizen'' letter from Jackson was
sent to white liberal Democratics in affluent West Los Angeles. In
what the industry calls the ``involvement'' approach, it included
an ``issues survey'' asking the reader's opinion on Jackson's key
issues.
   Another mailing that went out after the Feb. 8 Iowa caucuses
highlighted Jackson's 8 percent showing in a state with a 1.4
percent black population as evidence that he has support outside
the black community, contrary to what ``so called political
experts'' had claimed.
   Warwick said that since names on his mailing lists are
``overwhelmingly non-black,'' white people obviously are
contributing to Jackson.
   ``For us to get the results we are getting means he has very
substantial support among white mail donors,'' he said.
   Warwick would not be specific on the rate of return for the
amount of mail sent out, but said it was ``much better'' than the 1
percent to 1.5 percent return that is typical for so-called
prospecting mail, in which new donors are sought out.

   Super Tuesday's muddled Democratic results
could give California and at least one prominent California
politician a bigger share of the political spotlight.
   Since Democratic contenders Jesse Jackson, Michael Dukakis and
Albert Gore Jr. emerged from the round of contests on March 8
tightly clustered in the delegate race, more attention is being
paid to the late contests, such as California's June 7 primary.
   And California Assembly Speaker Willie Brown, the flamboyant
national chairman of Jesse Jackson's presidential campaign, is
waiting in the wings for what could be a key role.
   The importance and influence of Brown, the consummate deal-maker
and power broker of the California Legislature over the past
decade, is growing with the prospect of a brokered Democratic
convention.
   If Jackson ultimately falls short of winning enough delegates
for nomination, every extra delegate he wins increases the chances
of a deadlocked convention _ and the chance that Jackson and top
advisers like Brown will have a say in deciding who is the nominee.
   If it comes to that, Democrats will again be facing the quandary
of trying to make enough concessions to Jackson to keep his
supporters while not conceding enough to alienate other
constituencies _ creating a situation in which Brown's negotiating
skills could be especially important.
   Brown has said repeatedly that he isn't maneuvering for a
brokered convention, but rather for a Jackson victory.
   ``The Jackson campaign wants the nomination,'' Brown told
Sacramento reporters last week. ``We may well determine the
Democratic nomination with the California vote. Probably Jackson is
the favorite at the moment (in California).''
   But Brown's first choice for the nomination was New York Gov.
Mario Cuomo, and he signed on with Jackson only after Cuomo
declined to run.
   Brown has repeatedly and heatedly denied speculation that he
took the Jackson campaign chairmanship to be in a position to
deliver Jackson votes to Cuomo at a deadlocked convention, saying
that he is supporting Jackson because he believes he is the best
candidate and can win.
   Brown isn't the only California politician coming in for
attention where the presidential race is concerned. California Gov.
George Deukmejian is frequently mentioned as a possible running
mate for the GOP nominee.
   But Deukmejian has a Democratic lieutenant governor who would
take over if he stepped aside. That would diminish the Republican
support in California he would otherwise be expected to add to a
national ticket.
   Deukmejian himself has said he would ``absolutely,
unequivocably, not under any circumstances'' accept the nomination.
   ``Even if offered the opportunity, I would not be able to do it,
and I would not,'' he says.
   Deukmejian refuses to speculate publicly on why he keeps being
mentioned as vice presidential material when he's made it known
he's not interested.
   One of his advisers, speaking on condition of anonymity, says:
``It's just window-dressing. They all want a Westerner on their
lists, and he's the biggest name out here. But they all know the
situation, and that he's serious when he says he isn't available.''

<DATELINE>BISMARCK, N.D. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   North Dakota Democrats have begun a
two-week process of picking the delegates who will attend the state
convention and eventually cast ballots for president.
   Rep. Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., and Massachusetts Gov. Michael
Dukakis have maintained the most active campaign offices in the
state, said George Gaukler, chairman of the state Democratic Party.
   Democrats in the state hold 53 district conventions, which began
Sunday and will continue until March 27, to select delegates to the
state convention in Fargo. Convention-goers will cast their ballots
for president on April 16, the third day of their four-day
convention.
   Delegates to the national convention in Atlanta will be chosen
based on their presidential preference. Straw polls of the
presidential race will be taken at each district convention,
according to the party.
   State Sen. Allen Richard, Gephardt's state campaign coordinator,
said, ``We'll be working hard at creating Gephardt preference
caucuses at the district conventions.''
   ``We feel his moderate message on agriculture and trade is more
in line with the thinking of North Dakotans,'' he added.
   Ellen Austin, state coordinator of the Dukakis campaign, said
Dukakis volunteers will also attend district conventions.
   ``Our committee has felt all along that he was leading in this
state, and we still feel he's the leader,'' she said.

<HEAD>Cosby and `Fatal Attraction' Big Winners in 14th People's Choice
Awards</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Comedian Bill Cosby won four People's Choice
Awards and the movie ``Fatal Attraction'' won three from an
admiring public that also bestowed honors on Cybill Shepherd, Dolly
Parton and Whitney Houston.
   ``This is particularly special for me,'' said Miss Shepherd,
named favorite female television performer for her role in ABC's
``Moonlighting'' despite a shortened role last year due to her
pregnancy with twins.
   ``When you're out of the limelight, you're pregnant with twins
and gain 45 pounds and you go through this enormous change, it
always goes through the back of your mind, `Are they going to
forget?'
   ``It's really nice to know they didn't forget.''
   The public chose the winners in the 14th annual People's Choice
Awards, broadcast Sunday night by CBS-TV.
   Winners were determined by a Gallup poll of 5,000 people older
than 12, a statistical representation of nearly 196 million people.
   Cosby was named favorite male TV performer for the
fourth-consecutive year and favorite all-around male entertainer
for the third. He also won a new award _ all-time favorite TV star
_ while his top-rated NBC-TV series, ``The Cosby Show,'' won its
fourth comedy program award.
   NBC's ``L.A. Law'' was the favorite TV dramatic program.
   ``Three Men and A Baby'' won for comedy movie and ``Fatal
Attraction'' for dramatic motion picture. Its leads, Michael
Douglas and Glenn Close, were picked top motion picture performers.
   ``I want to thank you as my favorite father, and a supporter,''
Douglas told his father, Kirk Douglas, who presented the award.
   ``I got so nervous when I got up I didn't thank the people,''
Miss Close said afterward. ``And that's what makes it so special.
It's just a cross section of people who have nothing to do with the
industry.''
   Clint Eastwood was chosen all-time favorite movie star, an award
presented by Jimmy Stewart.
   Miss Parton won favorite all-around female entertainer, and
favorite female performer in a new TV program for ABC's ``Dolly.''
   ``It's always nice to be recognized,'' she said backstage.
``This has been a hard year and I've been working really hard on
this TV show. It's really nice to know the people are on my side.''
   Kenny Rogers won his eighth award as male musical performer,
tying with Cosby, Burt Reynolds and Barbara Mandrell as an
eight-time winner of an individual category.
   In other awards, Oprah Winfrey dethroned Johnny Carson as
favorite television talk show host, Miss Houston was the favorite
female musical performer, the group Bon Jovi was chosen favorite
rock group, and Barbra Streisand was the favorite all-time musical
star.
   John Ritter was the favorite male performer in a new television
program for ABC's ``Hooperman,'' while Kirk Cameron of ABC's
``Growing Pains'' and Keshia Knight-Pulliam of ``The Cosby Show''
tied for favorite young TV performer.
   The top new TV dramatic program was ``thirtysomething'' on ABC,
while NBC's ``A Different World'' and ``My Two Dads'' tied in the
new TV comedy category.
   In a new category, the all-time favorite song was ``Somewhere My
Love (Lara's Theme)'' from the 1965 film, ``Dr. Zhivago.''

<HEAD>Chicago's Chatham Neighborhood Pulling for Jesse Jackson</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM C. HIDLAY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In Chatham, a middle-class black neighborhood of
brick bungalows and neat lawns, people like Clevie Williams are
pulling for Jesse Jackson and proud of his Democratic presidential
bid.
   ``You can't talk to nobody in Chatham unless it's about Jesse,''
said Williams, 66, a retired Army master sergeant. ``They have a
belief they can help him become the Democratic nominee for
president.''
   On the tree-lined streets of Chatham on the predominantly black
South Side, Jackson's strong showing in the Super Tuesday primaries
filled many with hope that maybe, just maybe, a black could be
elected president of the United States of America.
   Most people who paused to talk about Jackson's chances said they
would vote for him and his slated convention delegates in Tuesday's
Illinois primary election.
   ``Every vote counts,'' Williams said. ``All I can say is he's
got a chance. He's got as good a chance as he'll ever have.''
   Like many black neighborhoods across the financial spectrum,
Chatham is Jesse Jackson country. It's a community of about 40,000
people where the median family income was nearly $19,000 in the
1980 census. Most people have jobs and many own their homes, mainly
one- and two-story brick bungalows with an average value of
$39,200, the census found.
   ``I would describe Chatham as a rock-solid black middle-income
community and one that has been that way for probably 20 years,''
said Martin Goldsmith, Chicago's director of community development
planning.
   Jackson's work over the years with Operation PUSH, the
civil-rights group he founded, and his two presidential campaigns
have won the respect of many residents, said housewife Jessie
Blissitt, 50.
   ``He's done a lot for black people,'' she said. ``He's someone
we look up to. He speaks out for what really concerns black people.
We've sort of been shoved aside by all the other candidates.
   ``Because we are a minority, I don't know if he actually could
make it to the presidency,'' Ms. Blissitt said. ``But I'm glad he's
running if for nothing more than to show black kids they can do it,
to give them a goal to strive for.''
   Several people shared her pessimism about whether the nation's
white majority would elect a black president.
   ``People I talk to say he won't make it, due to the fact of his
color,'' said Donald Crawford, 47, an apartment-building janitor.
   Crawford said he planned to vote for Jackson because he likes
his background as a preacher and thinks his bid for the presidency
shows ``guts.''
   ``One thing about him being black, he wasn't born with a silver
spoon in his mouth,'' he added. ``He knows the feeling.''
   Garrett Manuel, also a janitor, paused as he weeded shrubbery in
front of an apartment building and grinned as he thought about
Jackson's Super Tuesday success.
   ``I was surprised, but I really liked that. It made me feel
good,'' said Manuel, 61. ``Most people I've talked to _ they really
think he's going to win. And everybody I've talked to said they
were going to vote for him.''
   But Elizabeth Jones, 66, a retired tax examiner, said she was
torn between Jackson and Sen. Paul Simon, the state's other
favorite son.
   Both candidates seem honest, straightforward and committed to
their principles now, she said, but ``all of them are full of you
know what.''
   ``They promise you one thing and do another when they get in,''
she said.

<TEXT>
   Jesse Jackson made an impressive showing
in Democratic caucuses in his native South Carolina over the
weekend and now takes aim at Tuesday's primary in his adopted
Illinois.
   A record turnout estimated at 45,000 people attended the South
Carolina precinct caucuses Saturday. When the meetings were over,
it appeared the Greenville native would collect 23 of the state's
48 national convention delegates.
   Fifteen of the delegates apparently will be uncommitted while
six will go to Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore. The state also has four
super delegates which were not at stake in Saturday's meetings.
   ``We the people have won South Carolina,'' Jackson told a crowd
of about 400 supporters gathered Saturday night at Greenville
Technical College. ``This is a campaign of hope. Each victory adds
another to win.''
   On Sunday, campaigning in Chicago, Jackson said he expected his
South Carolina victory would give him momentum going into the
Tuesday primary in Illinois.
   The South Carolina delegate estimates were based on reports from
93 percent of the state's 1,788 precincts. Carol Kahre of the state
Democratic Party said it could be a couple of days before all the
numbers are in.
   ``The problem now becomes the county party priorities are
preparing for their county conventions,'' she said. State officials
must ``beg a lot'' to get the numbers in, she said.
   Jackson, Gore and Gephardt all campaigned in the state in the
days before the caucuses.
   ``Clearly Jesse Jackson and the undecided are the big winners in
South Carolina,'' Gephardt said while campaigning in Detroit.
   Gore's state campaign chairman, state Rep. Bob Sheheen,
D-Kershaw, claimed that Gore's finish above Dukakis and Gephardt
``is a significant victory.''
   ``I thought if we ran neck and neck with the uncommitted that
would be a great achievement,'' he said, adding he expects the
Gephardt campaign to fold before the state convention giving Gore a
chance to pick up more uncommitted delegates.
   The state organizer for Dukakis, Belton Zeigler, said the
campaign didn't spend much money in the state and ``whatever we get
is gravy in the caucus campaign.''
   Bill Prince, the state campaign coordinator for Gephardt said
``we're going to make our stand in Michigan.''
   He expressed hope that a strong showing there later this month
would allow the congressman to pick up some uncommitted delegates
at the South Carolina state convention next month.
   Earl Black, a University of South Carolina political scientist,
said the record turnout was due to Jackson's organizing and Gore's
strong showing on Super Tuesday.
   ``With South Carolina Jesse Jackson's home state, there was a
very strong incentive in the black community,'' he said.
   ``Some of it was due to Gore's showing on Super Tuesday,'' Black
added. ``Some Democrats felt there was a candidate out there they
could support.''
   Before Super Tuesday, Gore was way back in polls in the state
and he covered a lot of ground in just a few days, Black said.
   ``But it's hard for him to claim a victory when he comes in
behind the undecided,'' Black added.

   The high road to Dublin for a 130-member high
school band from Michigan led through a Chicago hospital, where a
schoolmate is recovering from bone cancer surgery.
   The Belding High School band members, who raised $1,000 apiece
to march in Dublin's St. Patrick's Day parade and celebrate the
Irish capital's 1,000th anniversary, traveled 200 miles by bus
Sunday to O'Hare International Airport. Before departing, though,
they made a side trip to serenade 17-year-old Eddie Mikek.
   Their instruments were being packed aboard the plane, so the
musicians who gathered in the lobby of the University of Chicago's
Wyler Children's Hospital and sang.
   Because Eddie is fighting cancer, they sang the Belding fight
song, and because he is their friend, they sang the band's theme
song, ``Friends.''
   ``Eddie's not a band member but he is a good friend,'' said band
director Bob Stiles. ``We just want to remind him that he's one of
us and show our love and concern.''
   About 95 Belding parents also were on hand to surprise Eddie as
he emerged from an elevator in his wheelchair.
   ``There wasn't a dry eye in the whole building,'' said Eddie's
mother, Janice. ``He didn't know they were coming, and it took him
a minute or two to figure out what was happening. Then he started
crying like all the rest of us.''
   ``That's the kind of town Belding is,'' she said of the small
apple-growing community 30 miles east of Grand Rapids. ``We know
almost everyone there and we consider them all friends.''
   Eddie was diagnosed as having bone cancer Dec. 10, a day after
his 17th birthday, Mrs. Mikek said. Before his illness, he had been
an active high school junior, too busy helping at his parents'
grocery store and working a part-time job at a hardware store to
have time for extracurricular activities like athletics or the band.
   For a while after his diagnosis, he was able to attend school
several days a week between chemotherapy treatments, Mrs. Mikek
said, but schoolwork had to stop when he came here for surgery.
   The family had to sell their store, ``because we knew we
wouldn't have time to run it with all the trips to Chicago,'' said
Mrs. Mikek in a telephone interview from the Ronald McDonald House,
where she stays when she is visiting Eddie.
   ``Everybody was here for the serenade,'' said Mrs. Mikek. ``My
husband, Edward, our 18-year-old son, our 7-year-old daughter, our
5-month-old baby and even John and Val Rayborn, who run the
hardware store where Eddie worked. Seeing them is what really got
to him.''
   On March 4, doctors at the hospital removed a tumor from Eddie's
left leg and implanted part of a femur. They also installed a
mechanical knee joint. The relatively new surgical technique,
called limb salvage, avoids amputation, and should allow Eddie to
walk normally in the future, Mrs. Mikek said.
   ``He'll be in the hospital about another two weeks, and then
will begin physical therapy,'' she said. ``All he wants right now
is to be able to walk again, and everything's on hold until he
does.''

   Attorney General Edwin Meese III says he still
regards as a friend the man whose memos have made him a target of a
criminal investigation into a $1 billion Iraqi oil pipeline project.
   Meese also denies that he untruthfully played down his
involvement in promoting the project with then-Israeli Prime
Minister Shimon Peres.
   A memo by longtime Meese friend E. Robert Wallach says that on
Oct. 16, 1985, Meese, Peres and Wallach had a ``three-way
discussion'' of the project at the Israeli Embassy in Washington.
   On Sunday, James Rocap, one of Meese's lawyers, said ``Wallach's
account totally exaggerates'' the discussion ``in order to impress
his client,'' Swiss oilman Bruce Rappaport, a partner in the
pipeline project.
   Rocap said it is a ``cheap shot'' and ``stupid'' to suggest that
the memo contradicts Meese's earlier portrayals of his contacts
with Peres as limited.
   In a statement issued Feb. 1, Meese said that his total
involvement with Peres on the pipeline consisted of ``only two
contacts ... Each was brief, limited, and neither was initiated by
me.''
   Meese said that The Washington Post, which first disclosed the
memo in its Sunday editions, is ``taking a small fact that's well
known and trying to blow it up into a new news story.''
   The memo discussing the meeting had not been previously reported
prior to the Post article.
   Wallach was paid $150,000 by Rappaport and when Wallach went to
Meese about the project, the attorney general referred him to the
National Security Council.
   ``He is my friend,'' Meese said of Wallach in remarks Sunday on
ABC-TV's ``This Week with David Brinkley.''
   ``Mr. Wallach has never asked me to do anything that was
wrong,'' Meese said. He said ``a lot of people are taking a very
simple situation'' and ``they're trying to make a big deal out of
it.''
   Independent counsel James Mckay is investigating Meese's role in
the pipeline as a result of a memo written to Meese by Wallach
mentioning planned payments to the Israeli Labor Party in a bid to
protect the project in Iraq from Israeli attack.
   Meese says he doesn't recall the portion of the memo dealing
with the planned payments.
   Wallach directed that the $150,000 he received from Rappaport be
placed in an account under the control of W. Franklyn Chinn, an
investment adviser for both Meese and Wallach. The $150,000 ended
up being pooled with funds from Meese in several stock trades.
   Meese's initial $50,000 investment grew to $95,000 with profits
from the stock deals, but the attorney general denied in his
television appearance that he profited from the $150,000. He said
he was not aware at the time of the payment from Rappaport to
Wallach.
   Meese predicted that he would be exonerated in McKay's probe and
said ``I shouldn't step aside because if honest public officials
can be hounded out of office by partisan political attacks ... then
no one as a public official is safe.''
   Another memo by Wallach, also described in Sunday's Post,
recounts a meeting in New York involving Peres, Wallach, the
Israeli ambassador to the United States and then-National Security
Council aide David Wigg. Wallach said the meeting lasted about 15
minutes and that the four discussed two proposed letters for Peres
to sign, the first committing Israel not to disrupt the Iraqi
pipeline and the second dealing with the possibility of using U.S.
foreign aid to Israel as insurance.
   Peres has said in the past that he recalls having met Wallach
only twice, on social occasions with others present.
   Peres eventually signed a later version of the first letter, but
he said he could not act on the second letter without additional
consultations in Israel. The pipeline project collapsed shortly
thereafter, for want of an insurance package which the Iraqis
demanded in the event Israel destroyed the pipeline.
   The Justice Department saw legal obstacles to using Israeli aid
money as part of an insurance package.

<HEAD>Computer Scientists Set Speed Record For Solving Complex Problems</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in Monday AMs report.</NOTE>

<DATELINE>ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scientists at Sandia National
Laboratories have cast aside a popular theory and developed a new
method to dramatically boost the speed of solving complex problems
with parallel computers, which work on many parts of a problem at
the same time.
   ``We have achieved results that most computer scientists thought
impossible a couple of years ago,'' said John L. Gustafson, a
Sandia computer scientist.
   Sandia announced Sunday that Gustafson and other scientists at
the lab had broken records for speedups, a measure of the increased
speed at which a problem can be solved on a multiprocessor parallel
computer, compared with a single processor from the same system.
   Single data processors, like those in home computers, solve
problems one step at a time, in sequence, like balancing a
checkbook.
   Parallel computers use many processors linked together so they
can share the load, each working on a different piece of a problem
at the same time, like a lot of people each doing one page of a
checkbook.
   The theory applied to parallel processing had predicted speedups
of 50 to 100 times. But the Sandia scientists achieved speedups of
more than 1,000 times.
   Edwin Barsis, director of computer sciences and mathematics at
Sandia, said in an interview that large-scale parallel computing
could be used in such areas as defense work, weather forecasting or
solving large economic problems.
   Barsis said the Sandia scientists basically ignored a popular
belief in computer circles based on a speedup theory dubbed
Amdahl's Law.
   Amdahl's Law says that no matter how many processors might be
linked in parallel, the problem-solving speed could be increased at
most by 50 to 100 times that of a single processor because the
increase would be limited by the small portion of any computer
program that cannot be chopped up and run in parallel.
   Sandia scientists decided to jump ahead and work with 1,000 or
more processors at the same time. ``After you think about it for a
while, you think it's obvious,'' Barsis said.
   ``The idea is that you have to get all the processors to work
together,'' Barsis said. ``You have to make it so they don't get
bogged down in communication (with each other) rather than
computing.''
   Specialists in the field said Sandia's findings appeared very
significant.
   ``All the speedups sound very, very good for me. They sound very
significant,'' Anoop Gupta, professor of computer science at
Stanford University, said in a telephone interview Friday. ``But I
would have to know more details. On the whole, however, they sound
very good.''
   ``We think it's a very exciting result,'' Bill Gear, head of the
department of computer science at the University of Illinois, said
Saturday.
   Gear is president of the Society for Industrial and Applied
Mathematics and managing editor of the SIAM Journal of Scientific
and Statistical Computing.
   He read the Sandia paper on the breakthrough, submitted for
publication in the journal, last week. ``Normally, from the time it
(a paper) comes in until it appears in print, it may be two
years,'' he said. ``We're going to try to publish it in July.''
   The Sandia scientists developed mathematical and computational
methods, or algorithms, tailored to handle large scientific
problems.
   The problems were worked out on a parallel supercomputer called
an NCUBE-ten, made by NCUBE Corp. of Beaverton, Ore.
   Sandia has the only NCUBE-ten, which uses 1,024 processors. It
is less than 3 feet on a side but is the largest computer in the
world in numbers of processors operating in parallel and in the 7.7
billion bytes, or characters, it can move per second, Sandia
officials said.
   Gustafson, along with fellow Sandia scientists Robert Benner,
Gary Montry and David Womble, achieved speedups of 1,020, 1,019 and
1,011 on three full-scale scientific application problems, the
officials said.
   ``We have come almost all the way to the theoretical limit for a
1,024-processor machine,'' Benner said.

<HEAD>Noteholders Balk at First City Buyout Offer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Note holders are balking at accepting less
than 50 cents on the dollar as part of a plan to bail out the
troubled First City Bancorporation of Texas Inc., federal officials
say.
   The $1.5 billion rescue plan _ which would be the second largest
government bank bailout in history _ calls for $970 million in
federal assistance, a $500 million infusion of capital raised
privately by an investor group headed by Chicago banker A. Robert
Abboud, and a spinoff of $1.79 billion in book value of poorly
performing assets.
   But Alan Whitney, director of communications for the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp., said Sunday that holders of First City's
debt securities are reluctant to go along with the plan. He said it
would require the note holders to settle for less than the face
value of the notes.
   The amounts offered to the note holders ranged from 35 cents to
45 cents on the dollar, he said.
   According to Whitney, Abboud told federal regulators during
weekend meetings in Washington that not enough of the note holders
have agreed to sell at those prices.
   ``The agreement provides that we have to have a 90 percent
response to that tender offer, and Mr. Abboud advised us that that
level has not been reached,'' he said.
   Whitney said he didn't know how far the tender offers were from
the 90 percent level and added that the note holders have until
Tuesday afternoon to respond.
   ``The FDIC is working with Mr. Abboud and his investor group to
handle First City on an alternate basis should the tender not be
successful,'' he said.
   Whitney stressed that people with accounts at the bank will be
protected. He said FDIC will use its powers ``to assure stability
in First City banks and in the banking system.''
   However, he would not disclose what alternatives would be
considered to the Abboud plan which First City shareholders
approved March 4.
   ``Whatever alternative way we'll come up with will ensure
stability for First City and for the banking system as a whole,''
he said. ``The FDIC has statutory authority to handle imminent or
potential failed bank situations in various ways. ... We'll deal
with that on Tuesday, not to say that they'll have an announcement
on Tuesday.''
   The FDIC's $970 million pledge to First City is the largest such
government rescue of a bank since the 1984 federal bailout of
Continental Illinois Bank and Trust of Chicago.
   First City grew quickly during the Texas oil boom, but was
hammered by energy and real estate loan losses when oil prices
plummeted. For 1987, the company posted a $1.1 billion loss.
   It has assets of $11 billion and operates 59 banks in Texas and
one in South Dakota.
   Under the Abboud plan, Abboud would become chairman of the board
and chief executive officer upon consummation of the deal. The
proxy statement sent to shareholders before they approved the plan
predicted the new company would become profitable almost
immediately after spinning off the poorly performing assets.

   Reports that Iran may be planning to
install Silkworm anti-ship missiles on a tiny island in the
southern Persian Gulf add a new element to a much-publicized threat
that some U.S. naval officers say has been greatly overrated.
   Military sources in Washington said surveillance had detected
evidence that crude missile launch pads were being built on Abu
Musa, an outcropping long used as a base for armed speedboat
attacks on gulf shipping by Iran's Revolutionary Guards.
   The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said there was
still no sign of the missiles being installed. Nor did they
speculate on what purpose the Chinese-built weapons might serve if
located there.
   But missiles on Abu Musa would extend the so-called ``Silkworm
envelope'' along Iran's coast bordering the Strait of Hormuz by
about 100 miles, ``doubling the arc'' of the present threat, a U.S.
source said.
   It would put the missiles, which have a maximum range of 50 to
60 miles, within easy reach of the main shipping channel leading to
and from the Hormuz passage, as well as a populated stretch of the
Arab coast.
   Five of the seven United Arab Emirates port cities _ Dubai,
Sharjah, Ajman, Umm Al Qaiwain and Ras Al-Khaimah _ are 50 miles or
less from Abu Musa.
   Gulf-area diplomats and shipping executives expressed alarm
early last year when it was disclosed that Tehran was deploying
mobile Silkworm batteries along the Hormuz, the only outlet from
the oil-rich gulf to the open sea.
   Iran was said to have successfully test-fired several of the
missiles at an old ship's hulk. Subsequent reports have said Iran
possessed as many as 100 Silkworms, apparently supplied by China,
although Beijing has publicly denied the sales.
   Senior American officials made it clear from the outset that any
Iranian use of the weapon would be met with swift retaliation.
   Then-Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger said that while
Washington did not contemplate ``pre-emptive strikes,'' even the
activation of a Silkworm's target-tracking radar would be seen as a
hostile act, to which the U.S. Navy would respond.
   Iran's subsequent reluctance to even threaten to use the
missiles in the strategic Hormuz has caused U.S. naval officers to
view the threat with increasing skepticism.
   The convoys of U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti tankers continue to have
protective air cover while passing through the ``envelope,'' but
some warships now sail with crews at less than a full ``battle
stations'' alert status, de rigeur when the operation began last
July.
   ``Of course we can't rule the Silkworms out as a potential
threat, but in my opinion it's been overrated _ right from the
start,'' a U.S. Navy intelligence officer said several months ago.
   Other American officers have said the Silkworms in the Hormuz
are probably the least of their worries in sailing through the gulf.
   More imminent concerns include Iranian speedboats and most of
all, another mistaken Iraqi air strike such as that which wrecked
the missile frigate Stark, killing 37 Americans, last May 17.
   One senior officer said he would not discount the idea of some
``crazies'' firing a Silkworm in defiance of orders, but believed
the danger from a planned attack was virtually nil.
   ``As long as we maintain our retaliatory assets in the Arabian
Sea, that isn't going to occur,'' he said, referring to the U.S.
aircraft carrier _ currently the nuclear-powered Enterprise _
permanently stationed outside the gulf.
   ``The Iranians aren't about to fire one of those things
(Silkworms) at a warship or a ship under navy escort. They know
what would happen if they did. They'd be taken out in minutes,'' he
said.
   Friday's report of Silkworm-related activity on Abu Musa came
just as the only U.S.-flagged ship ever hit by a Silkworm was
sailing past the island.
   The 81,283-ton Sea Isle City, one of the 11 Kuwait-owned tankers
reflagged with the Stars and Stripes for protection from Iranian
attack, was heading out of the gulf in a navy convoy.
   It was the first trip for the ship since it was devastated by a
Silkworm last Oct. 16 while anchored at Kuwait's main offshore oil
terminal. That missile, and a handful of others launched from
Iran-held territory in Iraq's Faw peninsula, are the only ones that
Tehran's forces are known to have fired.
   The Silkworm, officially designated HY-2 by the Chinese, is a
variant of the 30-year-old Soviet Styx missile. The cumbersome,
20-foot-long projectile flies just above the water at subsonic
speed, homing on its target by radar.
   Although the weapon is crude by modern standards, its
1,000-pound warhead can cause severe damage. U.S. naval officials
called the hit on the Sea Isle City a lucky shot, but the tanker
was out of service for nearly five months.

<DATELINE>PANAMA, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If military strongman Gen. Manuel Noriega
steps down from his post as head of the Defense Forces, the United
States, and not Panama's fledgling opposition, will have brought it
about.
   U.S. sanctions freezing Panamanian assets have dealt a serious
blow to the military regime of Noriega, who is indicted in the
United States on drug trafficking and other charges.
   But the opposition has done little to further the process.
   President Eric Arturo Delvalle tried to fire the general late
last month but instead was booted out of office himself and went
underground, still recognized by Washington as Panama's head of
state.
   Delvalle's wife, Mrs. Mariela Diaz de Delvalle, said last week
that her husband was considering asking the United States for
military intervention.
   The opposition grouped under the Civic Crusade, an assortment of
political parties, private groups and businessmen's associations,
has tried to stir up a protest movement against Noriega but failed
to rally enough popular support for large street demonstrations.
   ``Only those with rifles can overthrow Noriega,'' said an
opposition businessman who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``Those
with rifles here (the Defense Forces) or those with rifles over
there (the United States). The opposition has no weapons.''
   Noriega loyalists in the Legislative Assembly forced Delvalle
out on Feb. 26, the day after Delvalle, encouraged by the United
States, tried to dismiss the general.
   The U.S. determination to force Noriega out of office has
brought the country to the brink of economic collapse. Shortly
after Delvalle was dismissed the U.S. Federal Reserve, which
provides the dollars Panama uses as its currency, withheld
shipments of cash to the Panamanian central bank.
   Then the United States froze all other Panamian government
assets in the United States and stopped monthly payments for
operations of the Panama Canal.
   The result was a money crunch that left the Panamanian
government unable to pay its employees in cash and forced banks to
remain closed for the past 11 days.
   The government is working out barter deals with supermarkets in
an attempt to overcome the crisis, but business has come to a
standstill.
   ``Unless something happens soon, people will have to take to the
streets to search for food,'' said Winston Robles, managing editor
of the opposition newspaper La Prensa, which the government closed
down Feb. 25.
   Noriega has been hanging on thanks to the loyalty of his
colleagues in the military's top ranks.
   Many of them, like himself, come from middle-class families.
   In office since 1983, Noriega is ideologically and politically
an heir to Gen. Omar Torrijos, the officer who rode a crest of
Panamanian nationalism and concluded the agreement that set a
timetable for total Panamian control of the Panama Canal by the
year 2000.
   Noriega uses Defense Forces, the only armed authority in Panama,
the way a politican would use the party to whip up support in small
towns where the soldiers build roads or perform other civic jobs.
   ``He has established a very close relationship _ even more than
friendship _ between the Defense Forces and the people,'' said
Boris Moreno, director of the government's National Information
Service. ``The political opposition here cannot overthrow Noriega.''
   The political opposition is made up of badly organized liberal
parties whose leaders spend much time criticizing each other. The
best organized party is the Christian Democrats led by Ricardo
Arias, who is in Miami because he was refused entry into Panama two
weeks ago.
   The Christian Democrats led the opposition alliance in 1984 and
refused to recognize the election results that put in Nicolas
Ardito Barletta as president. They claimed Noriega rigged the vote.
   It was the first election in 16 years in Panama. The last
popularly elected regime lasted 11 days in 1968. Barletta was
forced out, following a disagreement with Noriega, and Delvalle,
who was then vice president, took his place. The next presidential
elections are scheduled for May 1989.

   A star-studded AIDS benefit led by
Elizabeth Taylor raised $2 million for education and research, and
organizers hope the gala will be repeated elsewhere.
   ``We've had the most private funds raised (for AIDS) at this one
function than any other place in the country,'' benefit spokesman
Charles Cinnamon said of Sunday's ``An Extraordinary Evening with
Elizabeth Taylor and Friends.''
   ``We want it to be the prototype for the rest of the country.''
   The series of $2,500-a-plate South Florida dinner parties fell
short of its $3 million goal, although its ``grand finale'' of
champagne and dessert at the Fontainebleau Hilton Hotel was sold
out.
   Ms. Taylor urged the crowd, which included Brooke Shields,
Marlee Matlin, Margaux Hemingway, Zsa Zsa Gabor, Ed Asner and Lynn
Redgrave, to do more.
   ``Go out there and get your next-door neighbor involved,'' she
said. ``Put your money where your mouth is.
   ``We're talking about the living who are dying, and it's getting
closer to all of us,'' Ms. Taylor said, likening fear of the
disease to the tenacles of an octopus. ``How do you cope with those
families who reject their beloveds ... (AIDS victims) need
compassion and understanding. People may say money can't buy
compassion, but money can buy health.''
   The fund-raiser featured a dozen black-tie parties from Palm
Beach to Miami Beach, all given in the homes of celebrities or
community leaders.
   Before the finale swung into full force with a stream of stars
in sparkling jewels and dresses filling the posh beachfront
Fontainebleau, Ms. Taylor received $1.1 million from Celia Lipton
Farris of Palm Beach.
   ``That's so much money ... I mean that's so incredibly much
money and the things that money will do!'' said Ms. Taylor.
   Ms. Taylor, who became involved with AIDS issues in 1984, chairs
the non-profit American Foundation for AIDS Research, a research
and education group that will share the benefit's proceeds.
   ``Work at hospitals! Be volunteers! ... Your lives are not
endangered,'' a teary-eyed Ms. Taylor told her guests. ``I have
talked to, kissed and embraced and held in my arms, children, boys
and girls, who have died in my arms and I'm still here.''
   Besides the gift from Ms. Farris, the total raised was boosted
by a $300,000 donation by the Wohl Family Foundation of Miami.
   The Community Alliance Against AIDS, a fund-raising arm of the
University of Miami School of Medicine, led the benefit and will
share the proceeds with Ms. Taylor's group.
   Celebrities at the parties said they were pleased to join the
fight against acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
   ``It's really an honor for me to be here,'' actor Matt Dillon
said. ``It's a real problem everywhere, not just in America, but
all over the world. Anything I can do to help is why I'm here.''
   ``The truth is AIDS is a problem of all citizens,'' actor Eddie
Albert said. ``I consider it a part of my selfish responsibility to
be here. I'm not immune to this thing any more than anyone else.''

   Snow-clogged roads plagued motorists today from the eastern
Great Lakes region to Nebraska and other Plains states where road
crews were digging out from the region's worst blizzard in decades.
   The storm fizzled as it moved east, but still left 1{ feet of
snow on the ground this morning along the windy Wisconsin shore of
Lake Superior and more than 20 inches in Michigan's Upper Peninsula.
   ``For all practical purposes, it just kind of died as it moved
into Canada out of lower Michigan,'' said Pete Reynolds, a
forecaster with the National Weather Service's Severe Storms
Forecasting Center in Kansas City, Mo.
   ``The only significant snowfall right now is near the lakes due
to the lake effect,'' he said early today.
   Three sisters were killed Sunday evening south of Waunakee,
Wis., when the car they were riding in collided with a pickup truck
on a snow-slick road, authorities said. The accident brought to six
the number of deaths blamed on the storm since it hit the Midwest
on Thursday.
   ``We have been bombarded with accidents,'' said Don Olson, a
state trooper in Detroit, where expressways were glazed with ice
Sunday night. ``It's very treacherous.''
   Marquette County in Upper Michigan had 80 weekend traffic
accidents, and all but major roads remained blocked by snow even
though crews were working 12-hour shifts, state police Sgt. Paul
Numikoski said Sunday.
   Four inches of new snow was measured at Sawyer Air Force Base
near Marquette. South of Lake Erie, a heavy snow warning was posted
through today in northeast Ohio.
   Cold Canadian air pushed south in the wake of the storm. High
temperatures today were expected to be much colder than normal for
the season from the lower Great Lakes to the central Gulf of Mexico
coast, and as much as 30 degrees colder than usual in the Ohio and
Tennessee valleys.
   The storm had closed long sections of major highways in Wyoming,
the Dakotas and Nebraska.
   The last interstate to be reopened was I-90 across western South
Dakota, which was finally fully cleared late Saturday, said Todd
Seaman, a state Transportation Department engineer in Rapid City.
At the worst of the storm about 260 miles of it was shut down.
   Fifteen-foot drifts were reported along I-90 in the Kadoka area,
and Seaman said snow had drifted to the top of overpasses.
   Crews in Dawes County in northwestern Nebraska, where more than
30 inches of snow fell in some areas, were having trouble breaking
through snowdrifts up to 10 feet high, and some ranchers couldn't
reach their cattle, County Commissioner Waymann Wild said.
   ``This is probably the worst we've had since 1949,'' he said.
The county was hard-hit last year, ``but nothing like this.''
   About 700 snowbound travelers who had crowded the small town of
Kimball, Neb., since Thursday were told Sunday that roads were
still not in good shape but they could leave.
   To the north, in South Dakota's Black Hills, hungry, snowbound
skiers had to dig their cars out of 7 feet of snow to leave Terry
Peak Lodge, manager Bob Ekeren said.
   Two busloads of children who had been snowbound in isolated
farmhouses in western Nebraska since Thursday got home safely
Saturday afternoon. The 21 children were being driven home from
school when the blizzard caught their drivers by surprise, forcing
them to seek shelter with farm families.
   Four deaths in Wisconsin and two in South Dakota were blamed on
the storm.

   In anticipation of Israeli Prime Minsister
Yitzhak Shamir's visit today, more than 3,300 people marched to the
White House and rallied near the offices of ABC News for two
opposing causes.
   More than 3,000 people carrying Palestinian flags and chanting
slogans marched to the White House on Sunday to protest Israeli
policies in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   They condemned U.S. policy toward Israel, chanting, ``Reagan,
Shultz, you will see _ Palestine will be free.''
   The demonstrators called on the White House to freeze U.S. aid
to Israel and asked for a moratorium on military aid to Israel
until the Israeli government supports and participates in the peace
process.
   Shamir, who strongly opposes a U.S. peace plan for the Middle
East, is due to arrive in Washington today for talks with President
Reagan and Secretary of State George P. Shultz.
   Meanwhile, about 300 pro-Israel demonstrators rallied near the
offices of ABC News to protest the network's coverage of the
clashes between Israeli soldiers and Arabs in the occupied
territories.
   Speakers urged the crowd to write or call the network to protest
the coverage, while organizers sought signatures on petitions
calling upon the media ``to report the entire story.''

<HEAD>British Producer Lines Up Witnesses Against Waldheim For TV Trial</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A British producer says he has lined up 70
witnesses, including some who served with Kurt Waldheim in World
War II, to give evidence at a televised ``trial'' of allegations
the Austrian president was involved in Nazi atrocities.
   The list includes some of Waldheim's subordinates and superiors
when he was an officer in the German army from 1939 to 1945, says
Jack Saltman, who is producing the show for broadcast on U.S. and
overseas television in June.
   ``It took a lot of persuasion to get some of them to do it,``
Saltman said in a recent interview.
   The production will be the of result nine days, beginning April
13, of filming lawyers as they examine witnesses as if they were in
a court of law, before a panel of retired jurists, including
Shirley Hufstedler, a former U.S. education secretary and federal
Appeals Court judge.
   The program, which will run four hours, will end with the
judges' decision on whether there is probable cause that Waldheim
acted contrary to the international laws of war.

<HEAD>Aspin Blames Air Force For MX Problems, Service Defends Its
Accuracy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rep. Les Aspin plans to deliver a speech on
the floor of the U.S. House today that says the Air Force is ``part
of the problem'' in the guidance system for the MX missile, but the
service maintains the weapon is reliable and accurate.
   The text of the speech by the Wisconsin Democrat, who is
chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, was made available
Sunday.
   Aspins says his panel's investigation of the 10-warhead weapon
shows there are still problems in producing the missile's inertial
measurement unit (IMU), or guidance system.
   Aspin has previously criticized Northrop, which is building the
IMUs at a Hawthorne, Calif., plant.
   ``Documents recently received by the House Armed Services
Committee show that while Northrop is undeniably having its
difficulties, the Air Force is part of the problem,'' according to
the congressman's latest criticism of the MX.
   He says the document, obtained from persons whom he did not
identify, show that the service considered accepting one IMU
without inspecting it, and also protested the use of a process
exempting small componentns from testing.
   An Air Force spokesman, Capt. Jay Defrank, said, ``We stand by
the IMU's reliability and accuracy. We've answered many of the
charges in his statement. There is nothing new there.''

<TEXT>
   Yasser Arafat, chairman of the Palestine
Liberation Organization, says the U.S. closing of the PLO's
observer mission at the United Nations would negatively affect
American credibility and U.S. interests.
   Arafat, in an hour-long Boston Globe interview published today,
also said the first casualty of the decision by the U.S. Congress
and the Reagan administration to close the mission will be
Secretary of State George P. Shultz's Middle East peace plan.
   Arafat, speaking mostly in English, said in the interview Sunday
that ouster of the PLO from the United Nations is against
international law. He also said it will teach every nation that
they ``may face the same treatment if they have a difference of
opinion between their country and the American administration.''
   The PLO leader, wearing a military-style uniform and a winter
hat, is in Algeria for a two-day meeting with President Chadli
Bendjedid, the newspaper said.
   The interview came one day before Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir was arriving in Washington on a four-day visit. Shultz was
hoping Shamir would agree to attend an international conference to
arrange self-rule for Palestinian Arabs on the West Bank and Gaza
and then an overall settlement.
   However, Shamir was quoted last week as saying the U.S. proposal
was ``fraught with danger'' and incapable of bringing peace to the
region.
   ``The only word I agree with in the U.S. plan is the name
Shultz,'' Shamir said, according to an account Friday in the
Israeli daily newspaper Haaretz.
   Arafat said in the interview that Shamir was ``giving this hard
line because he wants a high price from the American
administration'' (and) ``the first item on the list has been
offered already,'' referring to the closing of the PLO mission.
   Arafat predicted that Israel next will demand more weapons, more
financial help and ``who knows, more agreements'' before conceding
to talk about peace.
   Arafat said he and Bendjedid were discussing the Algerian
leader's call for a summit meeting of Arab nations on the Middle
East peace issue. Arafat said he expects the conference to be held
the first week in April.
   Asked about Palestinian resistance to Israel's occupation of the
West Bank and the Gaza Strip, Arafat said, ``This is one of the
most important positive signals in the Palestinian revolution.
Grandfather, father, grandson _ all of them are in a revolution,
and we are proud of them.''

   Frank Sinatra, Sammy Davis Jr. and Dean
Martin opened their 29-city ``rat pack'' reunion tour to a sell-out
crowd of 14,500, proving they can still doo-be-doo-be-do it with
the best.
   ``How long have I been on?'' a staggering Martin asked the
bandleader as the 35-piece orchestra warmed up for the first
number, ``When You're Drinking,'' a parody of the old ``When You're
Smiling.''
   Martin's cocktail lounge manner and slurred one-liners, with
trademark cigarette and drink in hand, set the tone for an evening
that brought young and old fans to their feet.
   Sunday night's Oakland Coliseum show was the first of 40
performances on the tour, which is expected to generate $20 million
and a Home Box Office cable television special.
   Martin, 70, Davis, 62, and Sinatra, 72, first appeared together
at the Sands Hotel in Las Vegas, Nev., in January 1960.
   Martin joked his way through sometimes sentimental versions of
``Everybody Loves Somebody (Sometime),'' ``That's Amore,'' and
``Little Ole Wine Drinker Me.''
   Davis provided a powerful contrast to his seemingly sloshed
co-star, winning applause when he announced that this is his 59th
year in show business and when he told the audience he had been
sober for the last three.
   ``I gotta tell you the truth. Everybody backstage is being very
cool,'' he said. ``I wasn't this scared when I lived at 147th
Street and 8th Avenue in New York.''
   Davis, who recently underwent hip surgery, did not dance but won
ovations for ``Candy Man,'' ``What Kind of Fool Am I?,'' and
``Bojangles.''
   But it was Sinatra who stole the show, opening the second half
with a string of the songs that have kept him in superstar ranks
for almost a half century.
   Sinatra fans, young and old, went wild as ``Old Blue Eyes''
belted out such favorites as ``What Now My Love?'' ``Maybe This
Time,'' ``For Once in My Life,'' ``Mack The Knife'' and ``New York,
New York.''
   Sinatra was then rejoined by Martin and Davis, who told Sinatra,
``As far as we're concerned, and I can say this for the two of us,
you're still the chairman of the board.''
   ``Yeah,'' quipped Martin. ``You're still the chairman and we're
still bored.''
   The fans weren't bored, though.
   ``I saw Frank 15 years ago in Vegas and he's better than he's
ever been,'' said Karen Chaix, 38, of Alameda. Her husband, Dan,
added, ``I'm sorry we didn't buy tickets for our parents.''
   Maureen Pobuta, 33, of San Mateo, said she went through ``heck''
to get her tickets, which sold officially for as much as $40 but
were being scalped for up to $300. ``I've loved Dean Martin and
Sammy Davis Jr. ... I thought they looked great. For me, this is a
once-in-a-lifetime thing.''
   ``I've been buying their albums since I was a teeny-booper _
since the 40s,'' said Tina Mendez, who added ``there was no way''
she would have missed the Rat Pack performance. ``I will not drive
without Sinatra in the tape player.''
   The ``Rat Pack'' moniker, from Humphrey Bogart, was given to
Davis, Sinatra, Martin, the late Peter Lawford and other performers
who lived in the same area of Beverly Hills nearly three decades
ago.
   The tour was born when the three longtime friends were gathered
at Sinatra's house, and became a reality because they are all under
contract to the entertainment and casino company Bally Corp.
   The three are among a growing number of aging superstars to
rekindle their acts. Danny Thomas, Milton Berle and Sid Caeser
recently made a television movie, ``Side by Side.'' Rodney
Dangerfield, Jackie Mason and Mort Sahl have all been contracted
for one-man shows.
   The ``Together Again'' tour continues in Vancouver, B.C., on
Tuesday, Seattle on Wednesday, and Chicago on Friday and Saturday.
   Later stops include Minneapolis, Milwaukee, Detroit, Pittsburgh,
Cleveland, Cincinnati, Washington, D.C., Providence, R.I., Phoenix,
Ariz., Houston, Dallas, New Orleans, Miami, Atlanta, Philadelphia,
Secaucus, N.J., Uniondale, N.Y., Boston, Richmond, Va., Buffalo,
N.Y., St. Louis, Kansas City, Denver, plus cities in Southern
California.

<HEAD>Clarence Darrow Admirers Commemorate 50th Anniversay Of His Death</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELIZABETH SHOGREN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Admirers of Clarence Darrow marked the 50th
anniversary of the death of ``the attorney of the damned'' by
tossing a wreath into the lagoon where his ashes are scattered and
pledging to live by his example.
   About 100 people huddled together against the snow Sunday on a
bridge in a park on Chicago's South Side.
   Darrow, a skeptic on matters of religion and the afterlife, said
if there was anything to the spiritual world, he would return at 10
in the morning on each anniversary of his death, according to Leon
Despres, a former alderman of the 5th Ward, where Darrow lived.
   For years after Darrow's death, magicians and spiritualists
gathered at the bridge to conjure up the lawyer's spirit _ but year
after year they went away disappointed.
   Those gathered at the bridge departed with a renewed sense of
commitment to the ideals Darrow stood for: justice and equality.
   ``For those of you who question life after death ... Clarence is
here in spirit today as we commit ourselves to follow the example
of his life,'' said U.S. District Judge Prentice Marshall.
   About a dozen attorneys, politicians, judges and ministers
addressed the crowd in Jackson Park, a few blocks from Darrow's
home.
   In his 50 years as a lawyer, Darrow defended ``the preconvicted,
the powerless, those damned before they had a chance to have a fair
trial,'' said Herb Kraus, a co-chairman of the Clarence Darrow
Commemorative Committee.
   One of Darrow's most famous clients was Tennessee teacher John
T. Scopes, whom he aided in 1925 in what became known as the
``Monkey Trial.'' Darrow, representing the American Civil Liberties
Union, defended the right for evolution to be taught in Tennessee
schools. Though Scopes was found guilty, his conviction was later
reversed on a technicality.
   Darrow also gained fame during the 1924 Chicago murder case of
Nathan Leopold and Richard Loeb, millionaires' sons accused of the
thrill killing of 14-year-old Bobby Franks. Darrow persuaded them
to plead guilty and saved them from death sentences.
   Darrow, who was born in Kinsman, Ohio, but spent most of his
legal career in Chicago, was one of the first to be called a labor
lawyer.
   He resigned as the attorney for the Chicago and Northwestern
Railroad to represent labor's side of an 1893 railroad strike led
by Eugene Debs.
   For the past 31 years, the commemorative committee has marked
Darrow's death on March 13, 1938, by throwing a wreath into the
lagoon under the Darrow Bridge.
   ``Darrow was and is a folk hero,'' said Arthur Weinberg, who
recently published a biography on the lawyer. ``He was always a
defender of the damned and a defender of the unpopular.''

<HEAD>Disagreement Splits Jackson Campaign Effort In Northern Indiana</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GARY, Ind. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A disagreement among supporters of Jesse
Jackson has split the Democrat's presidential campaign effort in
northern Indiana.
   Jackson now has two campaign headquarters, both located in the
same block of the same downtown street in Gary. And although the
campaign workers in each office are working toward the same goal _
the election of Jackson in the May 3 primary _ they are functioning
under different local campaign directors.
   The dispute boiled over late last week when Jackson's state
coordinator, the Rev. Thomas Robinson of Anderson, appointed the
Rev. F. Brannan Jackson of Gary as campaign coordinator for
northern Indiana.
   Robinson said he made the appointment because the man named by
Jackson's national campaign office to head the northern Indiana
effort, Carlos Tolliver of Gary, had refused to communicate with
Robinson and could not reach out to other elected officials and
voters.
   ``I did not appoint him and I am not going to unappoint him. But
I'm appointing someone to get some things done,'' Robinson said,
adding that Tolliver no longer spoke for the local campaign.
   However, Tolliver insists that Robinson has acted beyond his
authority, and claims that he is the only authorized Jackson
representative in Gary.
   Top officials of the Jackson campaign's national and state
offices confirm that Tolliver is the authorized head of the
campaign in the 1st Congressional District.

<TEXT>
   President Reagan has labeled federal funding
for a planned biotechnology research park in central Massachusetts
that Gov. Michael S. Dukakis often points to while campaigning for
president a prime example of waste.
   Reagan listed the $100,000 for the Worcester, Mass., project
among $1.15 billion in ``pork'' he would have cut out if allowed to
single-out projects from last year's massive congressional spending
package.
   But Dukakis aides defended the center, which is part of the
governor's ``Centers of Excellence'' program designed to develop
technologies of the future like photovoltaics, polymers and
biotechnology.
   ``The Centers of Excellence program is another example of an
innovative experiment hatched at the state level,'' said Dukakis
campaign spokesman Steve Akey. ``For too long Washington has turned
its back on these innovative approaches.''
   In his campaign speeches Dukakis has praised the state-supported
centers as places where ``the best minds of industry, government
and academia are coming together to chart the frontiers of science
and technology and spawn new industries and new opportunities for
good jobs and economic growth.''

   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis has picked up
an endorsement from a top labor figure.
   Douglas Fraser, former president of the United Auto Workers
union, said Sunday in his announcement that Dukakis is the
Democrats' best hope for winning the November election.
   Dukakis, who was taking the day off from campaigning, said the
endorsement will give him momentum heading into the Michigan
Democratic caucuses March 26.
   ``His (Fraser's) endorsement will give a tremendous boost to my
campaign. I think it shows that our campaign is truly a national
campaign,'' Dukakis said.
   On Saturday, Dukakis, the Rev. Jesse Jackson and U.S. Rep.
Richard Gephardt made stops in Michigan, meeting with plant
workers, chatting with the chairman of the party's Platform
Committee, taking a train ride and raising some money.

   The State Department has quietly disbanded the
group it set up more than two years ago to sell the Reagan
administration's widely criticized policy towards South Africa.
   William ``Jake`` Jacobsen, the most recent director of the
Working Group on South And Southern Africa, said the office
effectively closed at the end of 1987.
   The decision not to continue the office resulted in part because
South Africa has waned as an issue attracting daily headlines in
the United States, Jacobsen said.
   ``By 1987 there were other issues,'' he said. ``There was the
(Persian) Gulf, the Middle East in general, the controversy
involving Iran,'' he said.
   The office, which at one point had a staff of about 20, was
created in late 1985 as the administration pursued its policy of
``constructive engagement,'' _ attempting to pressure the white
government in Pretoria into eliminating racial segregation through
diplomacy rather than sanctions.
   But Congress _ against the administration's will _ approved
sanctions in 1986, thereby undercutting ``constructive engagement.''
   House members are preparing to consider a measure later this
month that would impose a full economic embargo on South Africa.
   Jacobsen said the working group did a good job explaining the
department's South Africa policy. ``We got out the message ...
People were much better informed in 1987 than in 1985.''
   When the group was set up, it was never intended to be a
permanent fixture, he said.
   He said the working group's staff traveled to over 45 states and
gave more than 1,000 speeches to civic and business groups and met
with reporters and editors from television stations and newspapers.
   The group was modeled after the department's Office of Public
Diplomacy for Latin American and the Caribbean. That operation was
also shut down.

   Irish eyes were smiling a bit more than
usual as the city's marching Hibernians celebrated St. Patrick's
Day with a inside-joke.
   Dressed in kilts and playing bagpipes, the Irish Pipers started
off the annual parade Sunday with a lively tune: ``Scotland the
Brave.''
   ``We do it to fool the guys who think we're Scottish,'' said
piper John Flynn, who marched in a green jacket and gold kilt at
the front of the parade.
   Some spectators asked why bagpipes appeared at the Irish
celebration. Piper, Patrick O'Shea, explained the Irish war pipes
are an old tradition.
   Unlike the Scots, the Irish were kept from playing the pipes
before most of Ireland was freed from British rule, said O'Shea,
who has played the pipes for 45 years.

Appalachians. Heavier snow was falling along the shores of Lake
Superior and Lake Erie.
   A heavy snow warning was posted through today in northeast Ohio.
Three to 4 inches fell Sunday evening at Thompson, Ohio. An
advisory for 1 to 3 inches of snow was in effect this morning over
northwest Pennsylvania.
   Four inches of new snow fell Sunday night near Marquette, Mich.
   Heavy snow was forecast today over the northern Rockies. Winter
storm watches were posted for this afternoon and tonight over
western and central Montana and northwest Wyoming. Up to a foot of
snow was possible by Tuesday morning in the mountains of Montana
and Wyoming.
   Rain showers fell in southern Florida, where a downpour dumped
more than an inch of rain on West Palm Beach in an hour early today.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 a.m. EST ranged from 4 below
zero at Bismarck, N.D., to 76 at Key West Naval Air Station and
Fort Myers Regional Airport, Fla.
   The nation's high Sunday was 87 degrees at Fort Lauderdale,
North Miami Beach and West Palm Beach, Fla.
   For today, snow showers were forecast from the Great Lakes
region and the Ohio Valley across the northern and central
Appalachians; rain or snow showers over southern New England; and
snowshowers across Montana. Sunny skies were expected over the
nation's southern third, but with scattered showers and
thunderstorms in south Florida.
   Much of the nation was expected to have highs in the 30s-50s.
Below-normal temperatures were forecast from the Rockies to the
Atlantic, with highs only in the upper teens and 20s from the
Dakotas across the upper half of the Mississippi Valley, the Great
Lakes region and the Ohio Valley. Highs should reach the 60s and
70s over western Oregon, California, southwest Nevada, southern
Arizona, southern Texas and the Florida peninsula, with readings
near 80 over parts of the desert Southwest and south Florida.

<HEAD>Church Leaders Defy Government, Hold Protest Service</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID CRARY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Religious leaders who were barred
from holding an anti-apartheid rally led more than 2,000 people in
a defiant church service at a cathedral that was surrounded by
police vehicles.
   ``The government of South Africa has signed its own death
warrant,'' said the Rev. Allan Boesak, president of the World
Alliance of Reformed Churches. ``No government can challenge the
living God and survive.''
   Boesak's speech electrified a multiracial crowd at the Sunday
service and was punctuated by shouts of ``Amandla!'' the Zulu word
for ``power.''
   Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu, winner of the Nobel Peace
Prize in 1984 for his fight against South Africa's system of racial
separation, also spoke to the worshipers who packed the aisles of
St. George's Anglican Cathedral.
   Organizers said many people trying to go to the service were
turned back at police roadblocks on highways leading to central
Cape Town.
   The church service was arranged after police prohibited a rally
that had been planned at the nearby University of the Western Cape.
   Police also banned the 5-day-old committee, whose members
included Tutu and Boesak, that was sponsoring the rally.
   The Cape Town service and others in major cities were called to
protest government restrictions on opposition groups and the
detention of thousands of people without charge during a 21-month
national state of emergency.
   Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok on Sunday warned the
white-led government would ``take the necessary steps'' against
clergymen who took up the cause of 18 black opposition groups
banned in a crackdown last month.
   ``If teaching the gospel of Jesus Christ is going to lead me
into trouble, tough luck,'' responded Tutu.
   Referring to Vlok's warning that clergymen should preach the
``true Christian message rather than revolution,'' Boesak said:
   ``If you had read the Bible you would not have spoken such utter
nonsense. ... The fight for justice is the Christian message.''
   In another development, Tutu wrote an article in today's
editions of The New York Times calling on the United States,
England and West Germany to cut diplomatic ties with South Africa
unless it meets three demands.
   ``First, the state of emergency must be lifted,'' he wrote.
``Second, last month's restrictions against our peoples'
organizations and leaders must be lifted. Third, detainees ... must
be tried in open courts or released.''
   Boesak, who reported receiving two death threats in the past two
weeks, told worshipers Sunday, ``It does not matter whether they
ban us, threaten us, or kill us in jail _ the church of South
Africa has decided we have work to do.
   ``We must tell (President) P.W. Botha, `Your days are over,' ''
he said.
   Tutu told the service, ``If it is revolution to say, `I work for
a South Africa that is truly democratic, where black, white and
yellow and green can walk together hand in hand,' then friends, I
am for that.''

<TEXT>
   The University of Minnesota's president has
resigned, citing controversy over the $1.5 million renovation of
his official residence, Eastcliff, and the $200,000 remodeling of
his campus office suite.
   ``Over the past few weeks, you and I have lived with stories
about Eastcliff renovations and repairs,'' Kenneth Keller,
president for three years, told a news conference Sunday night at
the 55,000-student Big 10 school.
   ``The stories have not been good ones,'' he said. ``I bear a key
responsibility for it. ... I am profoundly embarrassed and
profoundly sorry for it.''
   After repeated assertions recently that he planned to stay in
office, Keller, 53, said he now believes he cannot overcome the
controversy. He said he was informing the university's Board of
Regents he would step aside as soon as they arrange for an interim
replacement.
   The regents never gave formal approval for the mansion
renovation, which was orginally supposed to cost $400,000, a recent
report by the legislative auditor's office said.
   The report said the involvement of Keller and his wife,
university attorney Bonita Sindelir, in the renovation led to some
of the additional costs.
   Among the most embarrassing expenditures were those for a
mahogany desk and credenza for Keller's office that the legislative
auditor said cost $17,445. Keller has offered to pay for the office
furniture.
   ``I have said recently that I thought I could learn from the
mistakes of Eastcliff, improve the management of the university
where it's needed, and get on with the important job of completing
`Commitment to Focus,''' Keller told the news conference Sunday
night.
   ``Commitment to Focus'' is Keller's controversial $35.2 million
plan to improve the quality of the university while reducing
undergraduate enrollment.
   ``I have also said that if I felt my presence would hurt more
than help in accomplishing that task I would step aside,'' he said,
adding, ``As painful as it is for me to say, I now believe that to
be the case.''
   After he read a brief statement, Keller left without responding
to questions.
   Regent Chairman David Lebedoff and Gov. Rudy Perpich were
expected to comment on Keller's announcement today, spokesmen said
Sunday night.
   The St. Paul Pioneer Press Dispatch, quoting sources it did not
name in today's editions, said Perpich and Keller met privately
Sunday for about 90 minutes and that Perpich had indicated before
the meeting that he was prepared to ask Keller to step down.
   Perpich spokeswoman Patrice Vick would confirm only that a
meeting occurred.
   According to the newspaper's sources, Perpich was highly
irritated when he learned last week that the university had amassed
a reserve fund of more than $50 million.
   Keller's critics in the Legislature called it a ``slush fund.''
   Legislative auditors who revealed the existence of the $50
million fund said it was under the control of Keller and other top
university officials and that some of the money was used on the
house renovation without approval of the Board of Regents.
   Spending on the mansion was revealed in news media reports in
early February. Keller then went to Hawaii on a vacation, angering
lawmakers who thought he should have stayed available to answer
questions about the remodeling.
   Keller, a New York City native, came to the university in 1964
as an assistant professor in chemical engineering and materials
science, and became a department head in 1979.

   Iran and Iraq fired long-range missiles
into each other's capitals today as the so-called ``war of the
cities'' flared again after a two-day lull. Iran said at least 20
people were killed in Tehran.
   On the battlefield, Iran said it attacked mountainous northeast
Iraq and downed an Iraqi warplane. Iraq said Iran continued
shelling border towns.
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency said six rockets
exploded in residential areas of Tehran today, killing at least 20
people and injuring 50.
   Iran said it fired two missiles today into ``the dens of
corruption'' in Baghdad. The news agency, monitored in Nicosia,
said the missiles were aimed at ``military and economic centers''
in Baghdad.
   Baghdad Radio, also monitored in Nicosia, said one Iranian
missile crashed into a residential district of the city of 5
million around noon, killing some civilians. It gave no figures and
made no mention of a second Iranian missile.
   The Iranian missile hit as oil and energy ministers from 20 Arab
countries gathered in the capital of Baghdad for the opening of a
four-day meeting on improving cooperation in energy and mineral
resources. It was not known how far from the conference hall the
missile exploded.
   The Iraqis say they have shot seven missiles into Tehran since
Sunday to avenge Iranian shelling of Iraqi towns over the weekend
that killed at least 21 people and wounded 79.
   The official Iraqi News Agency said Iranian shellfire continued
to hit the southern port city of Basra, the nearby city of Qurnah
and the northern city of Halbajah today. It reported ``many
civilians,'' including women and children, killed or wounded in a
barrage that hit schools, houses and stores.
   Iran's Islamic Republic News Agency said Revolutionary Guards
launched a new assault in the northeastern Sulaimaniyeh region of
Iraq early today ``to avenge enemy missile attacks on residential
areas.''
   Quoting a military communique, the agency said the Iranians
stormed Iraqi positions despite bad weather, inflicting ``heavy
casualties'' and capturing several peaks in the Gerdhelkan range.
   IRNA said Iranian anti-aircraft gunners shot down an Iraqi
warplane during the fighting as it attempted to strafe Iranian
positions.
   It was the third Iranian assault in northeast Iraq reported in
24 hours.
   IRNA reported earlier that more than 800 Iraqis were killed or
wounded in attacks in the Darbandikhan and Khormal regions on
Sunday when its forces seized 15 square miles of Iraqi territory
and 12 ``strategic heights'' in the Sulaimaniyeh area, 160 miles
north of Baghdad.
   The Iraqi news agency quoted a military communique as saying
Iraqi warplanes flew 141 combat missions against Iranian troop
concentrations and other military targets Sunday. It said
helicopter gunships flew 85 missions.
   Baghdad Radio reported today that an Iraqi naval force sank a
``large maritime target along with its occupants'' near the Iranian
coast on Sunday night. It gave no other details.
   Sunday's missile attacks ended an unofficial two-day truce in
the war of the cities. Hundreds of civilians were killed in Tehran,
Baghdad and other cities in both countries during a 12-day missile
duel that had ended Friday. Tehran is 290 miles from the border,
while Baghdad is 85 miles away.

   An Air France jumbo jet made an
unscheduled landing at the U.S. air base at Thule in northern
Greenland because of a bomb threat, Greenland's military command
said today.
   The Boeing 747 en route to Tokyo landed at Thule late Sunday
night after the Paris headquarters of the French national carrier
received an anonymous telephone threat saying there was a bomb on
board.
   The 396 passengers were evacuated without incident and given
shelter in the base's movie theater.
   After a four-hour search of the airliner and all the baggage, it
was allowed to resume its flight via Anchorage, Alaska.

   The death toll from a cyclone earlier
this month in Mozambique has risen to 100, the national news agency
AIM reported today.
   Cyclone Filao struck March 1 and damaged large parts of the port
city of Quelimane and surrounding rural areas in Zambezia province.
   The news agency last week reported the cyclone had killed 57
people. It said today the toll rose as more information was
received from remote areas.
   The cyclone destroyed 1,000 homes, leaving an estimated 4,500
people homeless, AIM said.

   A man who embezzled $350,000 from a fertilizer
factory in eastern China was executed, an official daily said today.
   The overseas edition of the People's Daily said Jiang Zhengguo,
chief of the finance section of the Wujin Chemical Fertilizer
Factory in Changzhou City, was executed Sunday after an court
rejected his appeal.
   The report said Jiang embezzled the money from March 1983 to
April 1987 by listing false construction expenditures and forging
receipts. He was sentenced to death by a lower court last November.
   The Chinese government in January announced tough new rules for
punishing economic crimes of corruption and bribery. The rules
stated that those who gain more than $13,500 through corruption
should be given prison terms of not less than 10 years, and serious
offenders should be sentenced to death.
   There have been at least four reported cases this year of
embezzlers being executed, usually by a bullet to the back of the
head.

<TEXT>
   High-level talks began today between the United
States and South Africa on a plan to end fighting in Angola and
Namibia, officials said.
   The talks between U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Chester
Crocker and South African Foreign Minister Roelof ``Pik'' Botha are
open-ended and no details will be released until they end, said
Mari Botha, Botha's press secretary. It is the first meeting
between the leaders in two years.
   State Department spokeswoman Anita Stockman said Saturday in
Washington that the Crocker-Botha meeting will provide an
opportunity ``to reassess South Africa's willingness to proceed
toward a settlement involving total Cuban troop withdrawal from
Angola and Namibian independence.''
   Ms. Stockman also said the meeting would give the United States
a chance to ``register concern'' about recent developments in South
Africa.
   The United States has complained about anti-dissent measures in
South Africa in the past few weeks.
   She said a State Department working group arrived in Angola on
Wednesday to explore the possibility of further talks on getting
the estimated 40,000 Cuban troops out of the country as part of an
overall settlement.
   On Sunday, Angola's foreign ministry said Angola and Cuba
presented proposals to the U.S. officials for a southern Africa
peace accord including a timetable for the withdrawal of Cuban
troops from southern Angola, and an eventual full pullout.
   Since he took office in 1981, Crocker has tried to negotiate a
withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola in return for South African
withdrawal from neighboring South-West Africa, also known as
Namibia.
   The Cuban troops have been battling a powerful guerrilla force,
the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, or UNITA.
The guerrillas are supported by South Africa and the United States.
   On Sunday, UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi said South Africa has told
him it will begin direct talks with the Angolan government in a bid
to end Angola's 13-year-old civil war. He gave no indication when
such talks would begin.

<HEAD>Thousands Of Skiers Trapped By Avalanches</HEAD>
<DATELINE>INNSBRUCK, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tens of thousands of skiers remained
trapped in three Alpine ski resorts today after avalanches killed
10 people and injured at least 20 over the weekend.
   It was the worst winter-sport death toll for a single weekend in
Austria in decades.
   Roads to the famed resorts of Lech, Zuers and Stuben were snowed
in for a third straight day, and high winds prevented helicopters
from reaching the three high-altitude towns.
   Among those stranded in Lech were the former Dutch queen,
Princess Juliana, and her husband Prince Bernhard.
   ``They were supposed to leave on Saturday, but have been stuck
here since then,'' said a receptionist reached by telephone at the
Hotel Post, where the Dutch royalty were staying.
   ``But they are enjoying the winter sports and taking it all with
good humor like everyone else here,'' she said, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   Officials said thousands of the skiers, most of them vacationing
West Germans and Scandanavians, could remain stranded until Tuesday
because of the heavy snows and continued danger of avalanches.
   ``It is possible roads will be opened this afternoon, but it is
too early to tell,'' Eric Brumer, a local official, told Austrian
radio.
   ``But it is too early to tell whether the danger (of avalanches)
will drop enough,'' he added.
   The road to St. Anton was reopened today after seven people were
killed and at least 20 injured in the resort town on Sunday.
   Five vacationing Swedish skiers and two Austrians were killed in
St. Anton early Sunday when two successive avalanches rolled down
the steep mountains that tower above the resort and buried several
chalets, authorities said.
   Three others were killed in separate avalanches on Saturday,
bringing Austria's weekend winter-sport death toll to 10.
   The accidents followed the death last weekend of a close friend
of Britain's Prince Charles, who was killed in the Swiss resort of
Klosters by a snowslide that narrowly missed Charles.
   The avalanches destroyed four houses, damaged several other
buildings and buried the only train tracks leading into the
mountainous resort.
   Innsbruck police said authorities would not release the names of
victims until their next of kin had been notified.
   The exact number of those injured in the incident was not clear,
but several people were taken by helicopter to hospitals in
Innsbruck and nearby Zams, according to a police official, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Police said the single road that connects St. Anton to the
outside world remained closed, but that the train traffic to the
resort had been resumed.
   St. Anton, set at 4,118 feet in the Arlberg region of Western
Austria, is one of this Alpine nation's oldest and best-known ski
resorts.

   Scattered shootouts and a bombing left
four people dead and eight wounded in Beirut, police said today.
   Police identified the slain as two officers from the Lebanese
Forces, the Christians' main militia, an officer of Druse warlord
Walid Jumblatt's Progressive Socialist Party militia and a
Palestinian guerrilla.
   In the latest violence, a Shiite Moslem attorney was critically
wounded today when a time bomb exploded on a window ledge outside
the bathroom of his west Beirut apartment as he was shaving, police
said.
   Nimeh Hamieh, a former chairman of Lebanon's Bar Association,
was rushed to the Barbir Hospital by neighbors, police said. They
declined to speculate on the motive for the assassination attempt.
   The two Lebanese Forces officers were killed Sunday by
bodyguards of President Amin Gemayel's 18-year-old son, Pierre, in
a quarrel in a traffic-jammed street in the Christian port of
Jounieh, 12 miles north of Beirut, police said.
   Police said the shooting sharpened tension between the Lebanese
Forces and Gemayel's rightist Phalange Party militia, which
controls the Metn province in the Christian heartland northeast of
Beirut.
   The two sides have been vying for dominance of the Christian
community, whose control of the government, army and Parliament
triggered the civil war with Lebanon's Moslem majority that began
in 1975.
   The Druse militia officer was killed Sunday evening in an ambush
by militiamen of Justice Minister Nabih Berri's Shiite Amal
movement in the Rashaya district in the foothills of Mount Hermon
in south Lebanon, police said. They said the Druse officer's
escorts fired at the ambushers, wounding two of them before Syrian
troops drove up to stop the shooting.
   Police said a Palestinian guerrilla from a Syrian-backed group
was killed and another wounded in a midnight shootout Sunday with
supporters of Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser
Arafat in the Bourj el-Barajneh refugee camp in south Beirut.
   Three Lebanese Army soldiers and a woman were shot and wounded
by a drunken gunman Sunday as they were lunching at a seaside
restaurant in the Christian town of Halat, 25 miles north of
Beirut, police said.
   The Syrians maintain 25,000 troops in north and east Lebanon
under a 1976 Arab League peacekeeping mandate.
   They also have a 7,500-strong force in Moslem west Beirut
seeking to restore law and order after years of militia anarchy.

   A moderate earthquake shook the Soviet republic of
Kirgizia, the official news agency Tass said. It was the third
temblor in Central Asia in less than a month.
   No injuries were reported in the quake Sunday, but older
buildings near the epicenter in the Kochkork area sustained slight
damage, Tass said.
   The earthquake registered 5 points on the Soviet scale at its
center and 2 points in the republic's capital of Frunze, 200 miles
northeast of the area hit 12 days ago and 450 miles northeast of
the area jolted 24 days ago.
   On the 12-point Soviet scale, a 5-point earthquake is considered
capable of shaking buildings, furniture and cracking windows and
plaster.
   The March 2 quake measured 5.5 near its center in the Namagan
region of Uzbekistan, Kirgizia's neighboring republic to the
southwest. The Feb. 20 quake was centered 100 miles east of
Dushanbe, the capital of Tadzhikistan, which borders Kirgizia to
the south. Neither of the earlier quakes caused damage or injuries,
according to Tass.
   Kirgizia has a population of 3.2 million and is bounded to the
east by China.

<TEXT>
   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev
today began a five-day official visit to Yugoslavia, a Communist
nation suffering from high inflation and unemployment and a $20
billion foreign debt.
   The Soviet Communist Party general secretary, accompanied by his
wife, Raisa, landed in Belgrade in a special Aeroflot Ilyushin jet
that flew directly from Moscow.
   Yugoslavia's top party and government leaders were on hand at
the airport to greet the Gorbachevs.
   Gorbachev is the first Soviet leader to visit Yugoslavia since
the May, 1980 death of Josip Broz Tito, who pulled his nation out
of the Soviet bloc in 1948 to pursue a non-aligned foreign policy
and a once-vaunted system of worker self-management in the economy.
   That system looks increasingly frail as Yugoslavia battles 170
percent inflation and 15 percent unemployment and struggles to
repay its foreign debt.
   Last year, Yugoslavia's Communist leadership faced unprecedented
worker unrest, with more than 1,500 strikes adding to the
traditional problems of keeping this ethnically diverse nation
together.
   The system of self-management by which workers nominally run
Yugoslavia's enterprises will be one topic on Gorbachev's agenda at
meetings today with Belgrade's Communist leaders, Assistant Foreign
Minister Ilija Djukic of Yugoslavia told reporters in Belgrade on
Sunday.
   Asked whether the Yugoslavs would discuss recent ethnic tension
in the Soviet Union with Gorbachev, Djukic said this was Moscow's
internal affair ``and we shall certainly leave that to their own
resources.''
   He added, however, that Gorbachev would have an opportunity to
see for himself how Yugoslavia, a diverse nation of six republics
and two autonomous regions, deals with ethnic, linguistic and
economic differences.
   Gorbachev's drive for more openness on social problems and
economic reform in the Soviet Union has been called into question
recently by mass demonstrations by Armenians in the southern Soviet
Union.
   At least 32 people died when ethnic tension between the largely
Christian Armenians and their Moslem neighbors, the Azeris, boiled
over into fighting in the Azerbaijan city of Sumgait two weeks ago.
   Gorbachev will not be visiting Kosovo, the Yugoslav region most
plagued by ethnic tension between ethnic Albanians, and Serbian and
Montenegrin minorities. But he will get a look at the economic
diversity of Yugoslavia, visiting factories in the relatively
flourishing northernmost republic of Slovenia and the Adriatic port
of Dubrovnik as well as in Belgrade.
   The visit to Slovenia may also give Gorbachev a look at the way
his country could develop if the Kremlin leader's three-year drive
for more democracy under Communism gains further impetus.
   Slovenia has the most liberal newspapers of Yugoslavia's
free-wheeling, state-controlled press, and young people there have
emulated west European counterparts in pushing strongly for greater
ecological concern, a ban on nuclear power and an end to compulsory
military conscription.

   A windshield-washer was in critical condition
today after a motorist who did not want his windshield washed
cracked the man over the head with a baseball bat.
   Police spokesman Sgt. Maurice Howard said 47-year-old Eldred
Leitzse of the Bronx started to wash the windshield on a light
green Mercedes stopped at the light at about 7 p.m. last night.
   The driver of the car, one of three men in the car, apparently
did not ask for the wash and did not want it, Howard said. He
stepped from the car and hit Leitzse over the head with a bat,
Howard says.
   Windshield-washers in New York often are poor people who
approach cars at stoplights and offer to wash their windows for a
small tip. Occasionally the washers refuse to stop unless paid.
   Harlem Hospital administrator Edward Titus said Leitzse was in
critical but stable condition this morning.
   No one has been arrested and no other details were immediately
available.

<HEAD>Report: Dallas Woman Hires Commandos to Retrieve Daughter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Texas woman who was locked in a custody
dispute with her former husband hired a team of retired U.S. Army
commandos to get her daughter back from Jordan, according to a
published report.
   Kathy Mahoon of Dallas was given custody of the girl by a U.S.
court when she and her Jordanian husband divorced, The Philadelphia
Inquirer said Saturday. The husband abducted the girl, Lauren
Mohammed Ali Bayan, and took her to Jordan, the newspaper said.
   Ms. Mahoon, unable to get her daughter back through legal
channnels, hired a firm of former Army commandos to take the girl
away from her father, Mohammed Ali Bayan, the newspaper said. Bayan
claimed legal custody of the child under Jordanian law.
   Corporate Training Unlimited, a firm in Fayetteville, N.C.,
specializing in ``hostage rescue training,'' plotted and carried
out the seizure for expenses and a hefty, undisclosed fee, the
newspaper said.
   Although company president Donald Feeney denied the story, other
well-placed sources described the company's role, the Inquirer said.
   Ms. Mahoon now is in hiding with her 7-year-old daughter, while
the State Department is fielding protests from Jordan about
Americans' role in the dispute, the newspaper said.
   The rescue attempt began at 8:30 a.m. Jan. 28 in Jerash, north
of Amman, sources close to the participants told the newspaper. The
abduction began when J.D. Roberts, a one-time Army Delta Force
hostage rescue specialist, hailed and stopped a school bus by
waving a note in Arabic.
   While Roberts pinned the shocked driver to his seat, Ms. Mahoon
embraced her child and swept her off the bus, smacking a teacher
who tried to block their escape. They fled in a white Datsun and
switched cars before crossing the border into Israeli-controlled
territory, the newspaper said.
   When his daughter first disappeared, Bayan said she had been
abducted by three Americans and published newspaper advertisements
seeking information.
   Sameer Salem, a Jordanian friend of Bayan's, told The Associated
Press that Bayan had returned to Jordan in the fall of 1987 after
selling a Dallas restaurant called The Country Skillet. Bayan had
legal custody of Lauren under Jordanian law, Salem said.
   The raid embarrassed the U.S. Embassy because embassy officials
knew about the operation but did not alert Jordanian authorities,
the Inquirer reported.
   Jordanian authorities reached by the AP said the girl left
Jordan legally because she had an American passport. Jerash police
accused some U.S. embassy officials of taking part in the
operation, but police in Amman denied the abduction incident took
place.
   No State Department press official was available Sunday to
comment on the report. There was no listing for Corporate Training
Unlimited in Fayetteville, and no listing for Mahoon in Dallas.
   According to a brochure obtained by the Inquirer, Corporate
Training Unlimited, consists entirely of ``Delta Force and Special
Operations qualified personnel.''
   Its founders left the military in 1983 amid allegations that
they had claimed expenses from both the State Department and the
Army for guarding VIPs at U.S. embassies in Central America, the
newspaper said.
   State Department investigators now want to know whether
credentials issued to the company's founders while in the military
were used in the Jordanian incident, the newspaper said.

   The Afghanistan peace talks resumed today, one day
before a Soviet-set target date for a settlement. There were
unconfirmed reports Pakistan was about to decide whether to sign an
agreement with the Soviet-backed Kabul government.
   ``We will announce something today,'' Pakistan's chief
representative, acting Foreign Minister Zain Noorani, told
reporters as he arrived for a new meeting with U.N. mediator Diego
Cordovez. He did not elaborate.
   There was no confirmation of published reports quoting Prime
Minister Mohammad Khan Junejo of Pakistan as saying his country
will make a final decision today on whether to sign the proposed
settlement.
   The head of the Afghan delegation, Foreign Minister Abdul Wakil,
was scheduled to meet Cordovez today in keeping with the pattern of
the talks held indirectly because Pakistan does not recognize the
Kabul government.
   Pakistan has been speaking for the guerrillas, which are
excluded from the talks and do not formally recognize the
U.N.-sponsored peace process.
   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev said last month that Moscow
would bring home its estimated 115,000 troops starting in mid-May
if a settlement was signed March 15 _ Tuesday.
   But sources close to the negotiations have said they do not
consider the date a rigid deadline.
   Soviet troops have been in Afghanistan, helping the government
fight Moslem insurgents, since December 1979.
   Noorani seemed to make plain today that he expected the talks to
continue for at least several more days. He said he wanted to ask
Cordovez what the program would be ``for the next few days to
finalize'' the peace package.
   ``They are a few points remaining'' before the settlement is
ready for signature, he added. Details have not been published.
   The latest round began March 2 and is already the longest since
the negotiations began nearly 6 years ago.
   Pakistan's negotiating position is jeopardized by a reported
rift in the alliance of seven guerrilla groups over plans to send
representatives to Geneva if a transitional government will replace
the existing one.
   Pakistan argues that only a broad-based government can oversee
implementation of the agreements and ensure the safe return of more
than 5 million Afghan refugees from Pakistan and Iran.
   The Soviet Union and Kabul have fiercely rejected that demand,
saying the future government was something to be decided by the
Afghans themselves and was not subject for discussion at Geneva.

   Singer Dennis Day remained
hospitalized in critical condition today after injuring his head in
a fall at his home last week, a hospital official said.
   No change was reported in Day's condition during the weekend and
he remained in critical and unstable condition today, said a
nursing supervisor at St. John's Hospital.
   Day, 71, fell at his Bel Air-area home Wednesday and complained
of a severe headache in the emergency room. He underwent surgery
after tests showed bleeding in the brain.
   Day was diagnosed last July as suffering from amyotropic lateral
sclerosis. The progressive nerve disorder, also known as Lou
Gehrig's disease, causes a loss of muscle control.
   Day, who was born Eugene Denis McNulty in New York City, began
his career with comedian Jack Benny in 1939. An accomplished Irish
tenor, Day also was known for playing the innocent foil to Benny's
irascible character on television and radio.

<HEAD>Bodies Of IRA Guerrillas Headed For Belfast</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The bodies of three Irish Republican Army
members killed by British troops in Gibraltar were headed to
Northern Ireland today for funeral services and a possible St.
Patrick's Day burial.
   Families members and a Roman Catholic bishop called for calm at
the funerals of the IRA members, who British authorities linked to
a planned car bombing.
   Police on both sides of the border were expected to mount a huge
security operation to prevent paramilitary displays beside the
coffins during today's 100-mile journey by road to Belfast, and at
the funerals later this week.
   Sinn Fein, the legal political wing of the IRA, said a chartered
plane carrying the bodies of Mairead Farrell, 31, Daniel McCann,
30, and Sean Savage, 24, was to fly today from Gibraltar, the
British fortress colony in southern Spain, to Dublin.
   The cortege was to travel directly from Dublin Airport to
British-ruled Northern Ireland, police said.
   Sinn Fein said the IRA members will be buried in Belfast's
Milltown Cemetery on Wednesday or on Saint Patrick's Day on
Thursday, when the funeral processions likely would be swollen by
hundreds of sympathizers.
   St. Patrick's Day, honoring Ireland's patron saint, is
celebrated by Catholics across the island.
   Cahal Daly, a Roman Catholic whose diocese includes Belfast,
said Sunday he hoped both police and mourners will display ``a
desire to avoid confrontation.''
   In a statement, the families of the three dead men appealed to
the security forces ``to permit us the dignity to bury our loved
ones in peace.''
   The three guerrillas were unarmed when they were shot and killed
March 6 by soldiers believed to be members of the Special Air
Services, an elite British regiment.
   The shootings triggered rioting in Catholic districts of Belfast
for much of last week, and provoked protests that the three should
instead have been arrested. The British government said the
soldiers believed their lives were endangered.
   Two days after the shootings, Spanish police discovered a car
packed with 145 pounds of Czech-made explosives in Marbella, 30
miles from Gibraltar. Britain said the guerrillas intended to blow
up the car during a military ceremony in the colony.
   The IRA, outlawed in Britain and Ireland, is fighting to drive
the British out of Northern Ireland and unite the
Protestant-dominated province with the Catholic Irish Republic.
   Since the political and sectarian violence erupted in Northern
Ireland in 1969, at least 2,628 people have been killed.
   IRA funerals have in recent years brought bloody clashes between
nationalists and massed ranks of police seeking to prevent gunmen
firing shots over the coffins, the IRA's traditional salute to its
dead. The practice is banned.

<TEXT>
   A man who parachuted from a 50-story downtown
building is a member of a group that requires such jumps, police
said.
   The parachutist dropped onto a car a week ago and fled before
police could collar him.
   But since then, he was traced through the license number of a
getaway car and identified as a Canadian, said police Sgt. Gerald
Rogers.
   The man, whose name Rogers would not release, belongs to a group
called Building, Antenna, Span and Earth club, or BASE. Members are
required to parachute from a building, antenna, a bridge and a
cliff or mountain.
   ``They don't live long,'' said Rogers. ``It seems utterly crazy
that someone needs that much excitement in their life.''
   He said it was much safer to parachute from an airplane than
from a fixed object.
   The officer said police traced the license number of the
jumper's getaway car to a South Side Chicago man, who admitted he
helped in the escape. Rogers also refused to identify the
accomplice.
   Rogers said he has not contacted the parachutist, who lives in
Quebec and is a truck driver. But his accomplice told police that
the Canadian wants to reimburse the owner of the BMW, Musiliu
Alagbala of Chicago, for the several hundred dollars worth of
damage to the car, Rogers said.
   Alagbala said Sunday he was amazed and angered by the incident.
   ``I've seen things like that in the movies, but I'd never
thought it would happen to me,'' he said.
   If the parachutist returns to Chicago, he may be charged with
criminal trespass for being on the roof of the Leo Burnett Building
without permission, Rogers said. The suspect also may be charged
with criminal damages for the dents in the car, he said.
   ``We are not going to extradict him. If he doesn't come forward,
ultimately we might put a warrant out on him,'' he said.

<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A young lawyer, who was once kidnapped
because he campaigned against drugs, has been elected mayor of
Bogota in the first mayoral elections in Colombia's history.
   Security at the polls Sunday was tight throughout this country
racked by violence from extremist political factions and from
powerful narcotics traffickers.
   One of the alleged leaders of Colombia's biggest drug
organization even tried to run for city council in the town of
Armenia.
   But Carlos Lehder Rivas failed because Colombian law demands
that candidates sign up in person. Lehder is in jail in
Jacksonville, Fla., facing drug charges there and in Miami.
   Andres Pastrana, 34, the son of former President Misael
Pastrana, became Bogota's mayor and will be one of the youngest men
to take that important political post. Several Bogota mayors have
gone on to become president.
   Pastrana is a rising star in the Conservative Party, and his
election represents a setback for President Virgilio Barco's
governing Liberal Party.
   Pastrana was the only Conservative Party candidate for mayor in
Bogota. The feuding Liberal Party put up three candidates.
   Voters heeded Barco's plea to fight bullets with ballots in the
election, which was called as a concession to leftist guerrillas.
   For the past 169 years, the president, always from either the
Liberal or Conservative parties, had appointed governors who in
turn named mayors.
   There were 1,008 mayors elected Sunday. Colombians also elected
city council, state assemblies and governing bodies for remote
territories without sufficient population to become states.
   In the Bogota race, Juan Caicedo, a former president of the
Colombian Association of Businessmen, came in second place. With
about 50 percent of the vote in Bogota counted, Pastrana had
122,107 votes and Caicedo had 94,322, the National Elections Office
said in a news release Sunday night.
   By late Sunday night the elections office said the Liberal Party
had won 405 of the mayoral races, the Conservative Party 379 and
the leftist Patriotic Union 13. Coalition candidates representing
several parties had won 104 mayoral posts, the elctions office said.
   Barco, in a speech televised nationwide Saturday night, said
voting would be a way to reject the wave of violence that has swept
Colombia.
   More than 1,700 people were killed in the past year in fighting
between leftist guerrillas and government security forces and by
right-wing death squads and drug traffickers.
   On Sunday, soldiers and police guarded voting places and
patrolled cities and towns. The campaign was one of the bloodiest
ever in Colombia, with leftist guerrillas and right-wing death
squads killing five mayoral candidates and 19 city council
candidates. Hundreds of other political activists were slain.
   Leftist guerrillas kidnapped 14 mayors in the two weeks before
the election. The rebels let them go after warning each to do more
for the poor.
   Pastrana, who called for stronger action against the
multibillion-dollar cocaine and marijuana trafficking in Colombia,
was kidnapped by drug traffickers in January. A week later, police
acting on a tip, raided a farmhouse where he was held. Pastrana had
not been harmed.
   Colombian officials sometimes pay with their lives for
challenging drug traffickers, who are among the wealthiest men in
the nation.
   One group, the Medillin Cartel, is said to be responsible for 80
percent of the cocaine smuggled into the United States. Lehder is
charged in Miami with being one of its leaders.
   In 1984, Justice Minister Rodrigo Lara Bonilla was killed, and
in January Attorney General Carlos Mauro Hoyos was gunned down.
Officials suspect drug traffickers in the deaths because both men
fought narcotics.

   Convicted killer Willie Jasper Darden again
faces execution this week after outlasting six death warrants and
becoming a symbol of the national conflict over capital punishment.
   His appeal was pending today at the Florida Supreme Court in
Tallahassee in advance of a scheduled Tuesday morning execution at
the state prison here.
   Gov. Bob Martinez, the only official outside the courts who
could intervene, said last week he saw no reason to back off the
death warrant he signed Tuesday.
   Meanwhile, in Angola, La., Wayne Robert Felde was scheduled to
die shortly after midnight for the murder of a Shreveport police
officer 10 years ago.
   Felde had claimed he was suffering from post-war stress syndrome
as a result of his experiences in Vietnam and asked for the death
penalty at his trial, implying he would kill again. His lawyer,
Millard Farmer, refused to say if an appeal was being pursued.
   Darden maintained his innocence in an interview published Sunday.
   ``If I'm executed Tuesday, it won't change the facts one bit,''
he told The New York Times. ``All that will happen is that I will
be an innocent dead person instead of an innocent live person.''
   Darden said he's convinced his latest execution was scheduled
with only seven days' notice ``to keep me from getting too much
public attention.
   ``Since January, I have received close to 2,000 letters from
around the world,'' he said in the interview.
   Soviet dissident Andrei Sakharov and the London-based human
rights organization Amnesty International are among those who have
spoken out in support of Darden.
   Backers have said he has been on death row for 14 years because
of a racist legal system that denied him a fair trial.
   But police in three Florida counties consider him a suspect in
at least five killings in addition to the 1973 death of James
Turman, for which Darden received the death sentence. Those cases
remain unsolved and Darden has never been charged in them.
   According to a report Sunday in The Tampa Tribune, police in
Hillsborough, Pinellas and Polk counties say Darden began his spree
by beating a woman to death with his hands.
   Authorities say he then strangled a woman with her stocking,
battered a woman to death with a tire iron and finally shoot his
victims in the face with a short-barreled .38-caliber revolver
after they had been forced to perform oral sex on him.
   All the slayings police suspect Darden of occurred in 1973 while
he was on furlough from Avon Park Correctional Institution, where
he was serving a six month to 20 year sentence for breaking into
the home of a 70-year-old St. Petersburg woman in 1968, beating her
and attempting to rape her.
   The 54-year-old Darden has outlasted more death warrants than
any other Florida inmate, and has been on Florida's death row, the
nation's largest, longer than all but one inmate.
   The dispute over his case centers on whether Darden has an alibi
as a result of statements from a minister and a woman placing him
away from the scene of the Turman killing. Law enforcement
authorities say evidence shows the killing occurred an hour too
late for Darden to have an alibi.
   In Louisiana, Felde was scheduled to die shortly after midnight
CST.
   In 1978, after being picked up on a drunkeness charge, Felde
pulled a gun as he sat in the back seat of a police car and fired
it into the back of the driver, police officer Glen Tompkins.
   As part of his defense, he claimed he was suffering from post
war stress and exposure to Agent Orange. In his appeals he also
claimed he had inadequate defense counsel during his trial.
   Gov.-elect Buddy Roemer, who was to take office this afternoon,
said he had no plans to stop the execution.
   Hilton Butler, warden of the state penitentiary at Angola, said
Felde's sisters visited with him Sunday and would be back at the
death house today where the execution will take place.
   Butler said that Felde has asked for pizza, fried shrimp and
ginger ale for his final meal.

<TEXT>
   Pro-Iranian militants marking the third
anniversary of a car bombing that killed more than 80 Shiite
Moslems have threatened to launch new terrorist attacks against the
United States.
   ``We should not forget that America is behind all the massacres
and crimes,'' said Sheik Hassan Nasrallah, a senior official of
Hezbollah, or Party of God, at a mass rally in south Beirut's Bir
el-Abed district on Sunday. Excerpts of his speech were published
by Beirut newspapers today.
   ``We have war and we have terrorism to use against America to
defend the interests of the Moslems and the oppressed,'' Nasrallah
said. ``We are always ready to teach the wild beasts in the world a
lesson.''
   The Iranian-backed Hezbollah has accused the CIA of
masterminding the March 8, 1985, car bombing in Bir el-Abed with
the help of the army's intelligence branch. It charged that the
bombing was aimed at assassinating Hezbollah's spiritual guide,
Sheik Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah.
   Hezbollah is believed to be the umbrella for underground
extremists holding many of the 22 foreign hostages in Lebanon,
including nine Americans. The longest held hostage is Terry A.
Anderson, 38, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated
Press, who was kidnapped on March 16, 1985.
   Fadlallah also spoke at Sunday's rally, charging the device that
went off near his residence was ``made in America.''
   He declared: ``America, which accuses us of terrorism, is the
master of terrorism throughout the universe.''
   He vowed that guerrilla warfare against Israel will be escalated.
   ``We consider our movement a supplement to the Palestinian
uprising in the occupied territories,'' Fadlallah said, referring
to three months of rioting by Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied
West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Hezbollah leads the Islamic Resistence Front, which has claimed
responsibility for numerous attacks against Israeli troops and
their militia allies in Israel's self-designated security zone in
south Lebanon.

   A robbery suspect who claimed he had AIDS and
threatened to bite the first police officer that came near him was
put into a patrol car alone and towed to a police station, a
department spokesman said today.
   Richard Simmons was taken out of the patrol car by Emergency
Medical Service personel wearing protective gear, said Sgt. Maurice
Howard.
   Simmons, 27, was taken to Roosevelt Hospital for psychiatric
evaluation and was classified as emotionally disturbed, he said.
   The incident started Sunday morning when Simmons, dressed in a
wig, makeup, a shirt and jeans, tried to rob a passer-by, the
spokesman said.
   Simmons took a small amount of money from the pocket of
19-year-old David Murphy, Howard said. Murphy fought back and two
police officers intervened, handcuffing Simmons and putting him in
the back of a patrol car.
   After he was in the car, Simmons began ``cursing and kicking,''
Howard said.
   ``He said he had AIDS, that he was going to die and that he
would take them all with him,'' Howard said. ``Then he threatened
to bite the first officer who came near him.''
   Police locked Simmons inside the car and summoned a tow truck,
Howard said.
   Simmons was charged with one count of attempted robbery.

<HEAD>Tourist Brochure That Punctured Robin Hood Legend Is Withdrawn</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NOTTINGHAM, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Robin Hood fans have put an end to a
tourism brochure that says their hero and Maid Marian never met,
good-natured Little John was a grouch, and Robin may have stolen
from the rich just to line to his own pockets.
   ``I would like to see the authors of this brochure locked in the
dungeons of Nottingham Castle,'' said the sheriff of Nottingham,
Royce Young, on Sunday. Legend says Robin Hood, the medieval bandit
who supposedly stole from the rich to give to the poor, repeatedly
outwitted Young's ancient predecessor.
   Howls of protest from Robin Hood fans and deflated tourism
boosters led city officials to withdraw the glossy 45-cent
brochure. It had been compliled by historians and published by the
city council for distribution at a tourist information center.
   Malcolm Barker of the Robin Hood Society, who took up the
cudgels on the outlaw's behalf, charged: ``The city fathers have
done a disservice to their own city.''
   Barker said he didn't claim that the story, as perpetuated by
Hollywood, was true. He said he simply objected to being robbed of
a legend that also brings tourist riches to Nottingham.
   The brochure took a skeptical academic line on the outlaw who,
according to legend, lived in Sherwood Forest with his merry band
of men in the 12th century. City council spokesman Tim Jones said
the brochure put Robin Hood ``in historical context.''
   The brochure said Robin Hood, in the earliest tales, was a
highwayman who robbed travelers in neighboring Yorkshire. He was in
business strictly for himself.
   The brochure also says Robin's true love, Maid Marian, was
introduced into the legend through a 13th-century French poem, and
Robin's rotund lieutenant, Friar Tuck, was probably an amalgam of
two characters from different parts of England.
   Nottingham, a city of 290,000 in northern England, can hardly be
accused of neglecting the legend. Its main beltway is called Maid
Marian Way, and two rival consortiums are planning Robin Hood
exhibition centers for the city.
   In addition, hordes of tourists annually visit the Sherwood
Forest Center, where they see displays of medieval lifestyles and
gaze at the oak tree where the merry men may or may not have
relaxed after a hard day's archery.

<TEXT>
   Speakers were heckled with shouts
of ``Nazi'' and ``traitor'' and shoving matches broke out as rival
factions of American Jews clashed during a rally to support a peace
plan for Israel's occupied territories.
   Actor Richard Dreyfuss was escorted from Sunday's Roxbury Park
rally by police after hecklers shouted him down as he tried to
speak in favor of a peaceful solution to clashes between Israelis
and Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Other speakers included feminist Betty Friedan, Yael Dayan,
daughter of the late Israeli Gen. Moshe Dayan, and several rabbis.
   Despite a number of scuffles, police said there were no injuries
or arrests.
   ``I was raised in the temple and the Jewish community to see the
difference between right and wrong,'' Dreyfuss said as he tried to
address the crowd of about 400, which included many immigrants from
Israel.
   ``If he would spill some of his blood like me and my brothers,
then he would have a right to speak out like this,'' countered
Bobby Frankel, a veteran of the 1956 Sinai campaign. ``We're
against people who don't know what they're talking about.''
   The rally was organized on the eve of today's visit to the
United States by conservative Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir.
   Shamir has expressed opposition to an American plan for an
international conference to arrange self-rule for Palestianian
Arabs on the West Bank and Gaza, then an overall settlement. Israel
conquered the territories during the 1967 six-day war against
Jordan and Egypt.
   Sunday's confrontation began as 200 or so counter-demonstrators,
whose ranks included orthodox Jews and militant Jewish Defense
League leader Irv Rubin, circled the rally's original group, then
crowded around the stage.
   ``A good Jew is a Jew, in my opinion, who sticks to the state of
Israel through thick and thin,'' Rubin said. ``They (the peace
plan's supporters) are tearing the Jewish community apart. They're
using their celebrity status to beg and plead and cajole the prime
minister of Israel to accept this suicide plan.''

   Millions of Chinese peasants have hit the road
in recent weeks to seek their fortunes, creating a transportation
crisis along the country's railways, an official report said.
   Armed police have been called out to maintain order at railway
stations heaving under the mass of travelers while some passenger
trains are carrying more than twice their capacity, China's
domestic China News Service said in an article appearing in Hong
Kong on Monday.
   ``Some are going to the northwest for construction, some are
going to the northeast's Daxinganling forest for lumbering, others
are going Gaungdong province (in the south) to farm and still
others are going to large cities as housekeepers,'' the news
service said.
   At the Beijing station, the report said, ``people can be found
everywhere sleeping in the open.'' In Zhengzhou, the capital of
central Henan province and a railroad hub, more than 10,000 people
were said to be waiting at the station for tickets.
   The news service recounted the woeful tale of one passenger who
stood for more than 30 hours on a train trip from Anhui province to
the far-north city of Harbin. At one point he lifted his swollen
foot only to find the tiny space immediately seized by a traveler
squeezed next to him.
   Nearly 4 million people ride the rails daily, the report said,
without saying how much of an increase that represents.
   Most of the travelers are peasants looking for work, the report
said. The exodus from rural homes began with the arrival of warmer
weather following last month's Lunar New Year holiday.
   Poor peasants always have sought their fortune in big cities,
but the situation has become a problem in recent years because of
recent economic reforms that ease travel restrictions and permit
labor markets.
   The railroad situation hits its most critical on the third,
sixth and ninth days of each month, which are considered propitious
days for travel, the news agency said.
   Although authorities are taking several steps to ease the
situation, such as increasing passenger trains, the transportation
crisis is expected to continue, the report said.
   In an earlier report, Sichuan Radio said March 2 that 100,000
travelers were trying to leave Chengdu, the capital of central
Sichuan province, every day for their hometowns, by rail.
   ``A few passengers, heedless of admonitions, have stormed their
way onto the trains by breaking the windows,'' the report said.
``At the same time, trains leaving Chengdu station for destinations
outside Sichuan are seriously overloaded to the extend that it is
impossible to open the doors or supply drinking water.''

<TEXT>
   A zoo polar bear injured a man with a
history of mental problems who entered its cage, and police shot
the bear to death, authorities say.
   The 28-year-old man, whose identity was not released, was
treated at a hospital for a gash on his head and was put under
emergency detention by police after the Sunday morning incident.
   Police said it was unclear why the man climbed into the bear's
cage, but that the man told doctors he did it to ``give his brother
strength,'' and that people ``need a show of courage.'' The
``brother'' reference was unexplained.
   Vilas Zoo director David Hall said the intruder had to scale a
wall or climb through a moat to reach the the 7-foot-4, 900-pound
bear, named Chief.
   ``I'd say it's a one in a million chance that you get out of a
polar bear's den alive when a polar bear is in it,'' Hall said.
   A jogger who heard shouts flagged down a motorist, who alerted
police.
   The jogger, Robert Nelson, 47, said the ``bear was standing
above the person, licking him, playing around with him. The man
wasn't screaming. He wasn't doing anything. I thought he was dead.''
   Police Officer Michael Puls fatally wounded the bear with a
12-gauge shotgun after yelling at it and firing shots in the air in
an attempt to scare it. Puls said he shot the animal after it began
to drag the man to its cave.
   Hall said Chief, the only polar bear at the municipal zoo, was
considered one of the largest in captivity. It had been with the
zoo for about 13{ years.
   ``He was a good show and everyone liked him,'' Hall said. ``But
you can't compare his to a human life. All of us in the zoo
profession know that a human life takes precedent.''
   Police said the Sunday incident was the third time this year
that emergency detention procedures had to be used to detain the
man. Those procedures are used when a person is considered a danger
to themselves or others.

<HEAD>Columbus Girl's Anti-Drug Poster Wins Praise From First Lady And
Congressman</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COLUMBUS, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 12-year-old girl's anti-drug poster has
brought her praise from first lady Nancy Reagan and Rep. Richard
Ray, D-Ga.
   Tomiko Womack, a sixth-grader at Rigdon Road Elementary School,
got a letter from Mrs. Reagan on Feb. 29, praising her for
encouraging fellow students to ``just say no'' to drugs. She
received a similar letter from Ray on March 4.
   ``I was very surprised when I got the letters,'' Tomiko, a
straight `A' student, said. ``I feel greatly honored and will
treasure them forever.''
   The letters referred to a poster titled, ``How Drugs Affect Our
Nation,'' which Tomiko entered in the Muscogee County Social
Science Fair on March 4-5. Knowing that both Mrs. Reagan and Ray
were active in the fight against drugs, Tomiko wrote letters
inviting them to attend the fair.
   After she received Mrs. Reagan's letter, she added it to her
poster, which won first place in the sociology category.
   ``I came up with the subject because drug abuse is a nationwide
problem, especially for young people, and I want to do something
about it,'' Tomiko said.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A British engineer sentenced to life imprisonment
for alleged espionage left Libya today for a reunion with his
family after his prison term was commuted, the Foreign Office said.
   James Abra, 59, was freed Sunday in Tripoli, the Libyan capital,
after serving almost two years. He was headed for Malta to meet
family members. It was not known when Abra would return to Britain.
   Abra was arrested at Tripoli airport on June 20, 1985, and
accused of passing classified information to his employer, a
British electronics company, Plessey Co. He was convicted of spying
in April 1986 and sentenced to life in prison.
   Abra's Czech-born wife Radislava, 58, died of a heart attack
last July after a fire at their home in Hitchin, 32 miles north of
London.
   JANA, the Libyan news agency, has said Col. Moammar Gadhafi has
declared an amnesty for jailed foreigners. The Foreign Office said
the Italian Embassy, which looks after Britain's interests in
Libya, had submitted Abra's name for consideration.
   Britain broke diplomatic relations with Libya in April 1984
after a London police woman was fatally shot during a Libyan
dissident demonstration. Britain said she was killed by a Libyan
shooting at demonstrators from inside the embassy.

<HEAD>Israel, Hungary Restore Low-Level Diplomatic Ties</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israel and Hungary opened diplomatic offices in
each other's countries today, but a Hungarian official said full
ties await resolution of the Arab-Israeli conflict.
   ``Hungary isn't a superpower and therefore her ability to
negotiate in the dispute is modest,'' visiting Hungarian Foreign
Ministry representative Jeno Jyenis said on Israel radio.
   ``But we support all efforts to promote a solution to the
conflict,'' he said. ``The restoration of full diplomatic ties
between Israel and Hungary depends on a resolution of the conflict
between Israel and the Palestinians.''
   The renewal of diplomatic links between the two countries comes
20 years after all Soviet bloc countries except Romania severed
ties with Israel to protest its occupation of land in the 1967
Middle East War.
   Poland became the first East bloc country to renew low-level
ties with Israel last October. The Soviet Union also re-established
direct diplomatic contacts with Israel and sent a consular
delegation there in July.
   To promote the new ties between Hungary and Israel, an Israeli
interest section office was opened in the Swiss Consulate in
Budapest, and a Hungarian interest section was opened in the
Swedish Consulate in Tel Aviv.
   In 1986, trade between the two countries equaled $22 million,
according to Israeli figures. Hungary sells Israel money, jam and
furniture, while Israel exports light bulbs and phosphate to
Hungary.
   In addition, about 15,000 Israeli tourists visited Hungary last
year, while about 2,000 Hungarians visited Israel, according to
Israeli figures.

<HEAD>Nation's Oldest National Park Ranger Dies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOUNTAINAIR, N.M. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federico Sisneros, the National Park
Service's oldest ranger who spent his life caring for the San
Gregorio de Abo Mission, has died at age 93.
   Sisneros died Saturday of heart failure.
   Sisneros' family owned the land on which the 17th-century
Spanish mission stands and donated the property to the state in the
late 1930s. It was a state monument for many years and became part
of Salinas National Monument in 1981.
   Sisneros was the mission's caretaker while Abo was a state
monument and was named a ranger when it became part of the national
park system.
   ``It'll always be Abo on paper, but to the ones who worked with
him, it'll always be `Fred's Place,''' said Salinas chief ranger
Glenn Fulfer. ``His father had told him to take care of the
mission. It was more or less a legacy given down to Fred to take
care of Abo.''
   Fulfer said Sisneros worked for many years ``for hardly any
wages at all.''
   ``Fred was the type of fellow that the love of the site
outweighed the importance of money,'' he said.
   Sisneros was born in 1894 in a house near the Indian ruins at
the Abo mission. He and his wife, Guadalupe, lived in a house a few
yards from the ruins.
   Sisneros was honored by the National Park Service in 1981 with
the Superior Service Award for making a significant contribution
during most of the 20th century.
   He received an Honor Award in 1986 from the National Trust for
Historic Preservation at the group's 40th annual meeting.
   His story drew national attention over the years. He was
interviewed by Charles Kuralt of CBS News and was featured in major
newspapers.
   Fulfer said Sisneros had asked to be buried at the mission. The
National Park Servce has authorized his grave to be located there.

<HEAD>Senator, Counsel Say No `Bombshell' Likely From McFarlane
Testimony</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One member of the Senate's Iran-Contra
committee and its chief counsel said today they doubt any
``bombshell'' implicating Vice President George Bush will emerge
from the testimony of former national security adviser Robert
McFarlane.
   Nevertheless, Sen. George Mitchell, D-Maine, and counsel Arthur
Liman said they feel the arrangement was correct that led to
McFarlane's plea of guilty on Friday to misdemeanor charges that he
nad misled Congress.
   Mitchell and Liman, interviewed on the ``CBS This Morning''
program, said they expect McFarlane's testimony will be helpful in
the prosecution and indictment of others involved in sales of U.S.
arms to Iran and the diversion of profits to the Contra rebels
fighting the Sandinista government in Nicaragua.
   McFarlane said Sunday that even though he has promised to
cooperate with independent counsel Lawrence Walsh, he is unable to
provide any new information.
   ``In saying I expect to testify, it's neither for nor against
really anyone,'' McFarlane said on ABC-TV's ``This Week With David
Brinkley.'' ``It's to say what I've already said on the record and
there's nothing new that I know of to change what's there. And as
far as I know that's all there is.''
   Asked why Walsh would want him, McFarlane responded:
   ``I suppose that he wants to hold everyone who did something
wrong accountable and he's ceratainly done that with me, but it
isn't a matter of being able to embellish what I've already said.''
But both men say they think Indepedent Counsel Lawrence Walsh made
the right decision to allow McFarlane to plead guilty to lesser
charges than committing perjury to Congress.
   Interviewed today, Liman said, ``I think that the McFarlane plea
was an obstacle to be cleared by the independent counsel and I
would expect him to take other action soon.''
   Mitchell, although saying he agreed that McFarlane's testimony
is not likely to produce new information, said that ``his testimony
will be useful, I believe, according to the special prosecdutor, in
testifying in any future trials that may occur.'
   ``I think Judge Walsh really was not seeking so much his
cooperation as the principle that there was no justification for
lying to or misleading Congress in the Iran-Contra affair,'' added
Liman.
   McFarlane pleaded guilty to the four counts by falsely assuring
lawmakers that members of his staff, specifically Lt. Col. Oliver
L. North, had not been involved in private efforts to arm the
Nicarguan rebels during a statutory ban on direct U.S. aid to the
Contras.
   Each of the four counts carries a maximum penalty of one year in
prison and a $1,000 fine.
   As part of the plea agreement, McFarlane agreed to cooperate
with Walsh's inquiry into the secret sale of U.S. arms to Iran and
the diversion of profits to the Contras.
   McFarlane, who resigned as President Reagan's national security
adviser in December 1985, traveled to Tehran in May 1986 with North
on a mission to deliver spare missile parts and persuade Iranian
officials to help obtain the release of U.S. hostages in Lebanon.
   The grand jury that Walsh impaneled 14 months ago is preparing
to return indictments in the next several weeks.

<HEAD>Botha: S. African Troops to Stay in Angola if Cubans Do</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   South African military forces will not leave
Angola unless Cuban troops also depart, according to a report in
today's Washington Times.
   The South African forces will remain in Angola until the
40,000-member Cuban force departs, South African President P. W.
Botha said in an interview with Arnaud de Borchgrave, Times editor.
   In the past, South Africa has said its forces were operating in
Angola in order to keep guerrillas out of Namibia, a South African
controlled area adjacent to Angola, the article noted.
   Angolan officials, meanwhile, have reportedly given the United
States a timetable for withdrawl of the Cuban troops, but made that
pullout conditional on departure of the South Africans.
   Botha told de Borchgrave that he has reasons to believe that the
Soviet Union is ready to cut its losses in Africa and is pressuring
Cuba to withdraw its forces.
   Soviet Leader Mikhail Gorbachev believes his predecessors
miscalculated the chances for revolution in Africa, Botha said.
Now, he said, the Soviets are anxious to cut down on the high cost
of arming and propping up poor nations.
   Botha said that he doesn't think the Soviet Union wants to
``ditch'' Angola, but rather is ``shopping for a compromise.''
   If he is a wise man, Botha said of Gorbachev, he will take this
opportunity to get out of Southern Africa.
   Of the United States, meanwhile, Botha said the U.S. seems to be
playing domestic politics with the economic sanctions it has
imposed on his country.
   The sanctions have thrown thousands of blacks out of work, while
forcing his country to become more self-reliant, Botha said. He
said the end result is merely for the United States to lose what
influence it has in his country.

<TEXT>
   A 7-year-old Canadian girl who shares a
birthday with Ronald Reagan has learned from the U.S. president
that several other important people in history also were born in
February.
   ``It was wonderful to learn that you and I share a mutual
birthday,'' reads a typewritten letter signed by Reagan to Kaliopi
Triantafyllakis.
   ``February is also the month in which George Washington and
Abraham Lincoln were born. I hope you make it a part of your
birthday to learn more about these two great presidents who played
such important roles in shaping our nation,'' the letter said.
   The letter was in response to a birthday card the elementary
school student sent Reagan, who was 77 on Feb. 6.
   The White House response received Friday also included a glossy
photo of Reagan and wife Nancy, and a 32-page booklet about the
Reagan years in the White House.
   Kaliopi said she first heard a couple of years ago that she and
Reagan, who was born in 1911 in Tampico, Ill., shared the same
birthday.
   ``Actually, I think it was very nice of him to take the time to
write her a letter,'' said Kaliopi's mother, Kathy.
   ``Oh Mom,'' injected the youngster, ``he didn't write it, his
secretary did.''

<HEAD>Seven Arabs Reported Wounded, Soldiers Close Market</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: NEW thruout with army taking economic actions and wounding

   The army said soldiers shot and wounded seven
Arabs in a clash today, and Arab residents said troops closed one
of the West Bank's largest food markets as Israel stepped up
economic sanctions against the occupied territories.
   Arab reports said 150 Arab policemen in Gaza announced their
intention to quit, joining hundreds of officers who have turned in
their badges in the West Bank. Israeli authorities acknowledged
some resignations but gave no number.
   The resignations followed the slaying of a Jericho policeman who
was accused of collaborating with the Israelis. Undergound PLO
leaflets have demanded Arabs stop working for Israeli occupation
authorities.
   Scores of tax collectors resigned earlier.
   An army spokeswoman said a violent demonstration took place in
Yamoun, six miles northwest of Jenin. She said soldiers fired at
the legs of demonstrators because the troops believed their lives
were in danger. Seven Arabs were wounded and the village was placed
under curfew, she said.
   The Palestine Press Service reported 12 Arabs were shot in
clashes with soldiers, 10 in Yamoun and two others in Jenin.
Hospital officials declined comment, citing a newly enforced army
ban on speaking to reporters.
   The United Nations says at least 91 Palestinians have been
killed since anti-Israeli rioting began Dec. 8 in the occupied
territories.
   In apparent response to the resignation campaign, Israel
continued its economic sanctions, including a ban on the shipment
of gasoline and other fuel to service stations in the West Bank.
   Uri Hakak of the Israeli-owned Padesco Co., which supplies fuel
to 50 West Bank gas stations, said drivers were afraid to make
deliveries after two tank trucks had been attacked and burned.
   ``A truck carrying 20,000 liters (5,000 gallons) of oil is like
a napalm bomb. The drivers are afraid to travel,'' he said.
   Soldiers closed the regional fruit and vegetable market in
Jericho, 22 miles northeast of Jerusalem. Arab merchants said 70
trucks carrying tomatoes, peppers, cauliflower, lemons, oranges and
apples were turned away.
   ``We started to sell about 8 a.m. when the soldiers came and
forced us to close,'' said one merchant, who was sitting next to
crates of fruit covered with tarpaulins and carpets.
   The merchant said Arab farmers drove to other areas of town and
tried to set up informal markets. But he said soldiers chased them
away.
   Saeb Erakat, a Najah University political science professor who
lives in Jericho, said Israeli authorities wanted to break the back
of the Palestinian strike with economic pressure.
   ``The military government is trying to tell the people who is
boss. They want to hurt the people economically. Jericho is an
agricultural city. To order the market closed in the morning
amounts to killing it economically,'' said Erakat.
   A senior official in the army-run territorial government said
there had been a ``shift in focus'' from the disturbances in the
streets to civil disobedience.
   ``In this context, maybe we are going to take some steps (in
response) to the economic steps they take,'' added the official,
who spoke on condition of anonymity
   A dozen heads of Arab chambers of commerce from throughout the
occupied territories met in Jerusalem. They called for a halt to
``all methods of collective punishment and the withdrawal of the
Israeli army from the cities and population centers.''
   They also demanded an end to ``attacks on shopowners and their
shops.''
   An Arab Chamber of Commerce official who insisted on anonymity
said the ban on fuels means Palestinianss will have difficulty
restocking their heating tanks, that bakeries will have trouble
baking bread and that farmers will not have fuel for the irrigation
pumps.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, meanwhile, arrived in Washington
for an eight-day visit and said he is ``always open to new and
constructive proposals,'' to bring peace to the Middle East.
   Shamir, who opposes a U.S. peace plan for the region, said he
will give the Reagan administration a qualified reply to the
American proposal to hold peace talks by May 1.

   Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said
today he is ``always open to new and constructive proposals'' to
bring peace to the Middle East, but urged the United States to base
negotiations on the 1978 Camp David agreements.
   Shamir, arriving on an overnight flight from Tel Aviv, indicated
in his statement at Andrews Air Force Base that he will give the
Reagan Administration a qualified reply to the U.S. proposal to
hold peace talks by May 1.
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz escorted Shamir to his hotel
in downtown Washington and talked with him for a half-hour over
coffee. Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci is making a similar
courtesy call later in the day.
   In his arrival statement, Shamir appealed for understanding.
``In our search for peace,'' he said, ``the United States has
always been helpful, open and indispensable.''
   He said ``violence, terrorism and war are endemic'' in the
Middle East and the area ``is littered with broken agreements.''
   Shamir said the Camp David agreement, which led to a peace
treaty between Egypt and Israel in 1979 but failed to resolve the
Palestinian issue, ``should serve as our guide'' in the current
search for a negotiating formula.
   He said if past accords were ignored ``future agreements will be
meaningless.'' The Camp David agreement called for self-rule for
the 1.5 million Palestinian Arabs who live on the Israeli-held West
Bank and in Jordan. Jordan and the Palestinians did not participate
in the talks, which ended in failure in 1981.
   Under that agreement, a temporary arrangement would last five
years, setting the stage for negotiations on an overall
Arab-Israeli settlement in which all options, including statehood,
would be open.
   Shultz has proposed a three-year interim arrangement, with the
final negotiations to begin by the end of this year.
   ``We are always open to new and constructive proposdals, with
our positive reaction to your useful ideas,'' Shamir told his
American hosts.
   The Israeli leader made no mention of the international peace
conference Shultz also proposed. His statement suggested he will
attempt, during four days of talks here, to persuade Shultz to make
some changes in the proposal Shultz also has presented to Jordan.
   The U.S. position is that Israel should relinquish at least some
of the land it captured from Jordan and Egypt in the 1967 Six-Day
War in exchange for Arab recognition.
   Shamir is committed to Palestinian autonomy under the 1978 Camp
David agreement signed by the United States, Egypt and Israel, but
he is reluctant to cede the lands on which 1.5 million Palestinian
Arabs live under Israeli control.
   Before leaving for the United States, Shamir said Sunday that he
would not call for a government vote until after his trip.
   ``After I come back with a summation of my talks with
representatives of the American government, the Cabinet will meet
immediately and I think we'll have a decision on this subject,''
Shamir said on Israeli radio. ``It's a matter of about a week.''
   Shultz urged Shamir last week to consider the ``ticking
demographic time bomb'' of the rapidly growing Palestinian
population. At a congressional hearing, Shultz suggested Israel had
much to gain by territorial compromise.
   He did not say who would take over the land _ the Palestinians
or Jordan, which occupied the West Bank from 1950 to 1967. Egypt
held Gaza during the same period.
   The Palestine Liberation Organization, designated by the Arab
countries as the Palestinians' sole legitimate representative, has
vowed to dismantle Israel as a Jewish state.
   Shultz and Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci planned separate
courtesy calls today on Shamir after his overnight flight from
Israel. The tough bargaining begins Tuesday with Shultz and
continues Wednesday with President Reagan at the White House.
   The trip was planned before Palestinians on the West Bank and in
Gaza began staging protest demonstrations. As of Sunday, 91 had
been killed in three months of bloody clashes with Israeli forces.
   Shamir wrote Shultz in January offering to grant Palestinians
living in the territories self-rule on all matters except security
and foreign affairs. In a letter last week to critical U.S.
senators, Shamir reaffirmed his commitment to the Camp David
formula.
   It provides for negotiations on an overall settlement after five
years of Palestinian autonomy. All options, including statehood,
would be open.
   ``We have sought peace relentlessly, but our Arab neighbors,
except Egypt, still have to prove in deeds that they are willing to
negotiate peace with us,'' Shamir said.
   Shultz proposed his plan for negotiations to Shamir and Israeli
Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, to King Hussein of Jordan, and to
Presidents Hafez Assad of Syria and Hosni Mubarak of Egypt. So far,
none of the governments has responded formally.
   However, Shamir was quoted last week as saying the U.S. proposal
was ``fraught with danger'' and incapable of bring peace to the
region.
   ``The only word I agree with in the U.S. plan is the name
Shultz,'' Shamir said, according to an account Friday in the
Israeli daily newspaper Haaretz.
   Shultz has requested a decision by all sides by about mid-March.
His ``deadline'' coincided with Shamir's visit.
   Israelis supporting and opposing the U.S. plan staged separate
demonstrations over the weekend, with an estimated 40,000 turning
out to back the American proposal and some 200,000 demonstrating
against it.

<DATELINE>SHELBYVILLE, Ind. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Shelby County judge today ruled that
Secretary of State Evan Bayh meets the constitutional five-year
residency requirement to be governor.
   In a 10-page ruling, Shelby Circuit Judge Charles D. O'Connor
concluded the Democratic gubernatorial candidate didn't lose his
Indiana residency when he worked as an attorney in Washington,
D.C., in 1983 and 1984.
   Republicans had argued that Bayh, who leads public opinion polls
in the governor's race, lost his Indiana residency when he moved to
the District of Columbia to work for the law firm of Hogan and
Hartson.
   But O'Connor concluded that Bayh always intended to return to
his home state and never established formal residence elsewhere.
   ``Personal presence (away) from one's place of domicile is
insufficient to change one's domicile,'' O'Connor wrote. ``One must
move to another place with the intent to make it his home and
without the intention of returning to his home as such.''
   The judge's decision came after a one-day trial Friday on Bayh's
lawsuit seeking a declaratory judgment that he meets the
constitutional requirement to be governor.
   Bayh filed the suit in February after Republican Gov. Robert D.
Orr instructed the GOP-controlled State Election Board to
investigate Bayh's eligibility.
   The election board last week delayed its probe to allow the
court to rule. The election board and Orr already have called for
any lower court decision to be appealed to the state Supreme Court.
   O'Connor concluded that Bayh repeatedly expressed his intent to
return to his home state and considered his stint in Washington as
only a brief episode of professional development.
   O'Connor noted that Bayh, the son of former Sen. Birch E. Bayh,
voted regularly in Indiana and kept his ties to the state
Democratic organization.
   Bayh, 32, faces opposition from former Kokomo Mayor Stephen J.
Daily in the May 3 Democratic primary.
   Lt. Gov. John M. Mutz is unopposed for the Republican nomination
to succeed Orr, who is barred by the Constitution from seeking a
third straight term.

   Democratic presidential hopeful Michael Dukakis
said today the days of brokered conventions ``are gone forever'' as
he made his final plea to Illinois voters to abandon favorite son
Paul Simon and vote for him.
   ``The politics of smoke-filled rooms and selected leaders
deciding who our nominee is going to be went out years ago,''
Dukakis said on a final day of campaigning before Tuesday's
Illinois primary.
   The Massachusetts governor did not mention Simon by name, but
his reference was unmistakable. Simon, short on cash and far behind
in the chase for delegates to the Democratic National Convention,
says he is running in his home state to play a role at a brokered
convention in Atlanta.
   Dukakis declined to answer directly when a reporter asked him at
an early-morning news conference whether a vote for Simon was a
vote for a brokered convention. He replied by saying he hoped the
voters would pick the candidate they believed would make the best
Democratic nominee.
   He also said he couldn't think of ``anything worse for our party
than to go through weeks and weeks'' after the end of the primary
season ``with speculation as to who's dealing with whom, who's
negotiating with whom.''
   Dukakis told reporters he believes he has made ``significant
gains'' in recent days in Illinois. Public opinion polls indicate
that Simon's support has begun to slip with another favorite son,
Jesse Jackson, challenging him for the lead and with Dukakis
gaining support as well.
   Dukakis' aides, speaking privately, say they would be pleased if
Jackson edged out Simon for a popular-vote victory, hoping that
would persuade the senator to quit his campaign.
   In the separate election for 187 delegates, Dukakis' aides
concede he is unlikely to win more than a handful in Illinois, if
that.
   Dukakis made his comments at a news conference on a cold and
windy elevated commuter railroad station. The governor, who prides
himself on riding the subway to his statehouse office in Boston,
greeted commuters and chatted with railroad employees during a
20-minute train ride.
   Dukakis made these same arguments on Sunday.
   ``This nomination is not going to be decided by six guys sitting
in a back room in Atlanta,'' he said as he polished off a day of
ethnic campaigning at a fund-raiser in a Greek restaurant.
   His comments were a variation on his made-for-Illinois
television ad which lashes out against a brokered convention.
   The ad doesn't mention Paul Simon by name but the reference is
clear, since the Illinois senator skipped the 21 Super Tuesday
contests last week and says he is remaining in the race so he can
participate in a brokered convention.
   The Massachusetts governor set out on his Illinois stretch run
as polls offered conflicting evidence on the race. An ABC
News-Washington Post poll published today in the newspaper gave
Simon the lead with 39 percent support, Jackson 34 percent, Dukakis
17 percent.
   But a Chicago Tribune poll for publication today gave Jackson 32
percent support compared with 29 percent for Simon and 20 percent
for Dukakis. Those results suggested that Simon's support has begun
to slip and Jackson and Dukakis have begun to edge up.
   Dukakis is the leader in delegates in the Democratic nomination
race. His strategy in Illinois has been to suggest that he has the
best chance to win the nomination and a vote for the favorite sons
would lead to a brokered convention this summer.
   ``Some people would like to turn back the clock, to go back to
the days when the voters didn't really pick their nominee,'' says
the announcer in Dukakis' television commercial. ``They say you
must turn over that power to them at a brokered convention.''

<HEAD>Durango Flight Used Special Approach</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Continental Express plane that crashed near
Durango on Jan. 19, killing nine, was flying a time-saving airport
approach over rough terrain that only can be used with federal
permission, a safety board official said.
   The flight pattern is one of many possible causes being
considered for the crash, said Alan Pollock, a National
Transportation Safety Board spokesman.
   ``We've already looked at the approach,'' Pollock said. ``We've
ruled nothing out. It's one of the many pieces of the jigsaw
puzzle.''
   The special approach procedure took the aircraft toward the
airport from the northeast, rather than from the southwest as other
airlines approach, Pollock said.
   La Plata County Airport Manager Ron Dent said the approach takes
the plane over slightly rougher terrain but saves about 15 to 20
minutes per flight.
   ``In this case, their legs from Denver to Durango would be
reduced 30 to 40 miles, saving them quite a bit of flight time,
fuel, etc.,'' FAA representative David Laschinger said in a
copyright story broadcast Sunday by KMGH-TV.
   Dent said the northeast approach is not published in flight
manuals and it is illegal for pilots to use the pattern without
Federal Aviation Administration approval.
   KMGH-TV reporter Dave Minshall said Trans-Colorado has had
permission to use the special approach at Durango for a couple of
years. He said representatives of Trans-Colorado and Continental
Airlines declined to comment about the report.
   Soon after the crash, Braniff and American West airlines applied
for and received permission to fly the landing approach used by
Continental Express, Dent said.
   Pollock said investigators plan to compare that landing pattern
with the southwest approach. ``We'll be asking how this pattern
differs from the other, if there's anything in this approach that
could be a problem and how long Trans-Colorado has been flying
it,'' he said.
   Trans-Colorado leases planes and crews to Rocky Mountain
Airways, a Continental Airlines subsidiary that operates in
Colorado as Continental Express.
   Continental Express Flight 2286, carrying 17 people, had been
given clearance to land at the Durango-La Plata County Airport when
it crashed 10 miles east of Durango.
   The pilot, co-pilot and seven passengers died. Many of the eight
passengers who survived waded through waist-deep snow to get help.
   The NTSB released a toxicology report Friday showing that pilot
Steven S. Silver had a small amount of cocaine in his bloodstream
and urine when he died in the crash.
   Dr. Merrit Birky, an NTSB chemist at Washington, D.C., said it
would be inappropriate for him to comment on the significance of
the finding.

<HEAD>Iran Forced To Import More Oil Products After Air Raids, Survey
Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iran has been forced to sharply increase
imports of refined petroleum products because Iraqi air raids have
badly damaged some of its refineries, the Middle East Economic
Survey reported today.
   The attacks also have forced Iran to ration gasoline for the
first time.
   The weekly oil industry newsletter said West Germany's Laripax
company chartered the 284,298-ton Liberian supertanker Patria to
carry 1.8 million barrels of gas oil to the Iranian port of Bandar
Abbas from Rotterdam.
   It said two shipments totalling 900,000 barrels of gas oil were
delivered to Iran earlier this month. Gas oil, a refined fuel
heavier than kerosene, is often used as a diesel fuel.
   Iran, a major oil producer, has been importing around 300,000
barrels a day of refined products for 18 months because Iraqi air
strikes have reduced its refining capacity.
   The newsletter said that a big refinery on Tehran's southern
outskirts was badly damaged in an Iraqi air raid Feb. 27 and its
output of 220,000 barrels a day curtailed.
   That attack triggered a renewed ``war of the cities'' between
the two countries, at war for 7{ years, with both sides lobbing
long-range missiles into each other capitals.
   The survey said another refinery in the northwestern city of
Tabriz was only working at around half its normal capacity of
80,000 barrels a day.
   Iran's refining capacity of around 1.3 million barrels a day is
believed to have been slashed by as much as 66 percent since the
war began.
   The Iraqi air force has been concentrating on hitting Iranian
oil industry targets, the mainstay of its economy, since 1984.
   The newsletter estimated that despite these attacks, Iran is
producing around 1.9 million barrels a day and exporting around 1.5
million barrels a day through the Persian Gulf.
   Industry sources said the Iranians are driving to expand their
refining capacity. The Isfahan plant has been upgraded to a
capacity of 280,000 barrels a day.
   The Iranians also are moving ahead with plans to build new
plants at Arak in western Iran and Bandar Abbas on the gulf coast.
They would have a combined capacity of more than 250,000 barrels a
day that would restore Iran's refining self-sufficiency.
   Iran's domestic consumption is estimated at around 700,000
barrels a day.

   Paul Simon, about even with Jesse Jackson in new
Illinois polls, said today ``I have to win and I will win'' in
Tuesday's home-state primary. The Republican contest was looking
like another George Bush runaway.
   One poll out today said Jackson was pulling ahead of Simon in
the battle of Illinois favorite sons, while another showed Simon
maintaining his advantage. But the percentages separating them were
within the polls' potential margins of sampling error.
   Both showed Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis in third place,
trying to cut into the home state support of his two Democratic
rivals and claim some of the state's 187 Democratic delegates.
   A poll published today in the Chicago Tribune said 32 percent of
likely Democratic voters supported Jackson, 29 percent backed Simon
and 20 percent said they would vote for Dukakis. Rep. Richard
Gephardt of Missouri was the choice of 5 percent and Sen. Albert
Gore Jr. of Tennessee had the backing of 4 percent.
   The poll, conducted by Peter Hart Research Associates,
interviewed 500 likely voters on Friday and Saturday and had a
margin of error of 5 percentage points.
   An ABC News-Washington Post poll, conducted Saturday and Sunday
and published today in the newspaper, gave Simon the lead with 39
percent support to Jackson's 34 percent among very likely
Democratic voters. Dukakis had 17 percent with Gore and Gephardt
far behind. The potential sampling error was plus or minus 6
percentage points.
   Simon, who is counting heavily on a victory on Tuesday, said as
he campaigned at a commuter-train stop today that he had to win.
``A strong second isn't very strong,'' he said.
   Dukakis, also campaigning in Chicago, said today that the days
of brokered conventions ``are gone forever.'' He was making his
final plea to Illinois voters to abandon Simon and support his own
presidential bid.
   Gore greeted workers during a shift change at a factory in
Rockford, Ill., and said, ``I think we're going to do better than
people expect here.''
   Barring a major upset, Bush was expected to pick up the lion's
share of the 92 GOP delegates at stake on Tuesday and deliver
another blow to Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole's fading candidacy.
The Tribune poll showed Bush the choice of 62 percent of GOP
voters, compared to just 28 percent for Dole.
   As it became more apparent that the vice president was locking
up his party's presidential nomination, he became the target of
more criticism from Republican and Democratic rivals.
   ``He certainly has a lot of baggage,'' Jackson said of Bush.
   ``I'd like George Bush to tell us whether (Panamanian Gen.
Manuel) Noriega was on his payroll when he was CIA director,'' said
Dole.
   In a speech at Northwestern University Law School, Gore focused
on the Iran-Contra affair and said, ``We still don't know what
George Bush's role was.''
   Presidential politicking was picking up in two other states.
   Gephardt was holding a rally in Flint, Mich., which holds
Democratic caucuses on March 26 to choose 138 convention delegates.
The Missouri congressman, Jackson and Dukakis all were in the state
over the weekend.
   Dukakis was joined in Detroit by Mayor Coleman Young who said:
``I am not endorsing anybody but I intend to vote for Governor
Dukakis.'' Young was one of the few black elected officials not
allied with Jackson.
   In North Dakota, Democrats began a two-week process of selecting
delegates to a state convention in April at which national
convention delegates will be allocated.
   Jackson was the big winner Saturday in South Carolina's
Democratic caucuses. He received 54 percent of the vote and 23
delegates. Gore got 18 percent of the vote and six delegates, while
15 others will be uncommitted.
   Dukakis with 460 and Jackson with 423 are the leaders in the
Democratic delegate race, according to The Associated Press tally.
   Simon said he was being hurt by the lack of money to buy
television time.
   ``Obviously, not to have paid media hampers me in Illinois,''
Simon said as he campaigned in the city's Chinatown neighborhood.
``But the only way I could have paid media would be to use up the
resources and obligate the matching funds that are coming.''
   Simon insists that no Democrat will have the nomination in hand
when the party convention convenes in Atlanta in July and that he
will have as good a chance as anyone to come out a winner at a
brokered convention.
   ``I think the notion of a brokered convention would be an
absolute disaster,'' said Dukakis, during a campaign stop in a
Hispanic neighborhood in Chicago.
   ``I can't imagine anything worse _ the idea of taking the right
of the people to elect their president with their votes and putting
it in some back rooms in Atlanta,'' he said.
   Simon fired back that Dukakis was showing ``a touch of
arrogance.''
   He said, ``Mike has been wrong on other things and he's
certainly wrong on that.''
   Dole was interviewed on the CBS show, ``Face the Nation,'' and
said that regardless of the outcome in Illinois he would continue
his campaign.
   ``Sooner or later, the voters in one of these states are going
to say, wait a minute, we're about to nominate a candidate who
can't win in November,'' he said.

   I. King Jordan said today his appointment as
the first hearing-impaired president of Gallaudet University, the
nation's only liberal arts college for the deaf, is a victory for
students and the deaf community across the country.
   ``What it means to the students, it means to the deaf community
at large and that's _ it opens up new horizons for deaf people,''
Jordan said on ABC-TV's ``Good Morning America.''
   Jordan, dean of the school's college of arts and sciences, was
selected by Gallaudet trustees on Sunday after what began as an
isolated campus protest last week turned into an international
forum on deaf rights.
   Students had sought a deaf leader to serve as the school's
eighth president, but last week the board of trustees selected
Elisabeth Ann Zinser, a hearing woman who did not know sign
language.
   A week of protests shut down the campus as students called for
the appointment of a deaf president and the resignation of board of
trustees Chairwoman Jane Bassett Spilman, who had come under fire
for her handling of the crisis. Sunday night, seven days after
their protest began, the students were victorious on both counts.
   Officials announced the appointment of Jordan, 44, to replace
Zinser, who resigned Friday, and the resignation of Spilman, who
also hears normally and
   had chaired the board for six years.
   She will be replaced by Philip W. Bravin, one of four deaf
members of the board.
   ``I took this step willingly,'' Spilman said. ``In the minds of
some, I've become an obstacle to the future of the university. I am
removing that obstacle.''
   Jordan, who had endorsed Zinser's presidency at mid-week but
later retracted his backing, today praised the students' efforts.
   ``I think that they really honestly believe that they were
motivated in a positive way to do positive things, and the outcome
has been very positive,'' said the new president. ``It's our
responsibility now as administrators, me and Phil Bravin, to make
sure we channel that energy in a positive way.''
   Jordan, who also appeared on ``CBS This Morning,'' said the
students realize ``this was something very special. There's not
going to be an opportunity for this kind of movement again.''
   ``The battle cry was, `deaf president now;' it has become, `deaf
president forever,''' he said.
   Student protest leader Jerry Covell said Sunday that the
demonstrators' actions mark ``the first time we've ever shown the
world what we want, and that we can get it.''
   ``God made the world in seven days and we have changed it in
seven days,'' said Charles A. Giansanti, a deaf chemistry
professor, after the decision was announced.
   Bravin said the board would form a task force to study its own
composition in reponse to student demands that deaf people comprise
a majority of the 20-member panel. There also will be no reprisals
against student protesters, Bravin said.
   Gallaudet, which offers undergraduate and graduate degrees in 30
fields, receives 75 percent of its $76 million budget in federal
funds. A House Education and Labor subcommittee plans to conduct
hearings Tuesday into the school's bylaws governing presidential
selection and composition of the board.
   Zinser resigned two days after Rep. David Bonior., D-Mich. and a
member of the university's board, hinted that the federal aid could
be in jeopardy unless a deaf president were named.
   Deaf groups and schools around the country had supported the
students' demands, as had a majority of the Gallaudet faculty.
   Jordan, 44, was a finalist for the position when Zinser was
selected last Sunday. Before becoming dean in 1986 of Gallaudet's
largest undergraduate department, Jordan served as a psychology
professor at the school.
   After students learned of Jordan's appointment, they attempted
to put into perspective a struggle that had captured worldwide
attention.
   ``This is not the end; this is the beginning,'' said Bridgetta
Bourne, a protest leader.
   ``This is where we start from now. We have gained this, and we
will never have deafness work against us again,'' she said.

<HEAD>Lab Halts Shipment of Polio Vaccine for AIDS Treatment</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ALLENTOWN, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The only U.S. manufacturer of injectable
polio vaccine has stopped shipping the drug to California
physicians after learning it was being used as an experimental AIDS
treatment.
   Connaught Laboratories' Vice President David J. Williams said
the company would like to cooperate in such a treatment but is
prohibited by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration from supplying
physicians with the vaccine for anything other than its intended
use _ to prevent polio.
   ``Some doctors in California have been working with AIDS
patients, using our injectable polio product,'' Williams said. ``As
soon as it came to our attention, we were required to contact the
FDA to determine if they had all the approvals.''
   He said the physicians did not have the required approvals, so
Connaught halted the shipments.
   A spokeswoman for the FDA said an ``investigational new drug
application'' should be submitted to the FDA and studied to be sure
experiments are conducted properly and that dosages would not
adversely affect patients.
   ``The risks have to be weighed versus the benefits,'' she said.
   The old injectable Salk vaccine is no longer the preferred polio
vaccine in the United States, having been replaced by an oral
vaccine. It has shown promise for AIDS patients, relieving some
cancer lesions, herpes infections, swollen lymph nodes and fatigue,
a California researcher reported.
   The old, killed-virus vaccine can only be supplied by Connaught.
   Dr. Allen Allen, a California researcher and co-developer of the
experimental treatment, said physicians wonder what will happen now
to patients who have shown improvement after receiving the
injections for as long as two years.
   ``Patients with cancers are getting better and doctors can no
longer give them treatment. Most are close to running out,'' he
said Friday, adding that the physicians planned to meet to form a
plan of action.
   Allen said studies on more than 50 patients have shown the
vaccine ``produces clinical benefits after six weeks.''
   Allen said that it's up to Connaught, not the doctors, to submit
the necessary applications to the FDA, and alleged that the
Pennsylvania lab has financial reasons for not releasing its
vaccine.
   ``What they want to provide is a new vaccine which they have a
patent for, opposed to the old Salk vaccine which is in the publc
domain,'' he said.
   Williams said the company did receive a patent in November for
an improved injectable polio vaccine for global use, but he
insisted Connaught is not pushing one over the other for
experiments on AIDS patients.
   ``We started working on the new vaccine in 1979-80, probably
before AIDS was a household word,`` he said.

   Sen. Albert Gore Jr. portrayed himself today as a
needed alternative to the three Democratic candidates leading him
in polls one day before the Illinois Democratic primary.
   Gore greeted workers during a shift change at a factory in
Rockford, Ill., and said, ``I'm very encouraged'' about Tuesday's
primary, although he and his aides acknowledged on Sunday that he
was far behind.
   ``I think there are an awful lot of voters here in Illinois who
want an alternative to the kind of approach offered by Michael
Dukakis and Paul Simon and Jesse Jackson. I offer a different kind
of approach,'' Gore said today.
   Gore on Sunday had turned his focus to Republican George Bush
and said the vice president's response to the Iran-Contra affair
amounted to: ``Gee whiz, that's great, let's go ahead.''
   The Tennesseean resumed his Illinois campaign after a weekend
break, returning to a state where polls show him stuck in single
digits far behind favorite sons Simon and Jackson, and also
trailing rival Michael Dukakis.
   Gore's campaign bought what deputy campaign manager Larry
Harrington called ``a decent or modest amount'' of television
airtime in Illinois. It was thought to be in the range of $200,000
to $300,000 over the past week. But Harrington downplayed
expectations, saying Gore's only aim was to be ``in the fray'' in
Illinois.
   ``We never put any serious organizational effort into
Illinois,'' Harrington said. He cited Jackson's and Simon's
strength and the timing a week after last week's Super Tuesday
round of primaries that catapulted Gore to the top tier of
Democratic presidential contenders.
   Gore delivered a forceful attack on the vice president and the
Reagan administration for the Iran-Contra affair in a long
question-and-answer session with students at Northwestern
University law school.
   He pointed to the guilty plea by former White House National
Security Adviser Robert C. McFarlane to misdemeanor charges
relating to Iran-Contra as confirming ``the Reagan-Bush
administration violated the law in a brazen way.''
   ``We still don't know what George Bush's role was,'' Gore said.
   Gore said the administration's sale of arms to Iran in a bid to
free hostages would have been ``hooted'' down as ``nuts'' if
Congress was consulted. ``We didn't have that opportunity, but
George Bush had that opportunity,'' he said.
   ``He evidently said, `yeah, gee whiz, that's great, let's go
ahead,''' Gore said.
   Gore voiced sympathy for Simon, the Illinois senator whose White
House bid is on the ropes in Illinois, for a television ad being
aired by Dukakis. It says a vote for Simon is in effect a vote for
a confused race and perhaps a brokered convention.
   ``Gov. Dukakis's commercial tries to lump him in with back-room
politics of a kind Paul Simon has not been associated with,'' Gore
said at a news conference.
   Gore continued to depict himself as a more electable alternative
to Dukakis and his other rivals but did not dwell on them in a
series of speeches in the Chicago area. But asked about Dukakis by
the law students, Gore said he would respond ``with relish.''
   He repeated his contention that Dukakis lacks necessary foreign
policy experience and said Dukakis has wrongly stated that there is
no ``underclass'' in America _ the Tennessee senator asserting that
children trapped in a cycle of poverty do make up such an
underclass. And he faulted Dukakis for shortcomings as a campaigner.
   ``I think he's not yet found his voice to articulate his message
beyond the `Massachusetts Miracle,''' Gore said, referring to
Dukakis' claim that he helped turn around his state's economy.
   ``I don't think he has succeeded in offering a clear vision of
what he would do as president,'' Gore said.
   Gore said his decision to spend Friday night through Sunday
morning in Washington did not reflect an abandonment of his hopes
for Illinois. He said he spent much of the time raising money by
telephone, and said his fund-raisers have collected as much as
$150,000 a day since last Tuesday.
   But acknowledging the polls in Illinois, Gore said: ``There are
two favorite sons here; I understand that.''

<HEAD>Nurses Across Britain Protest To Demand More NHS Money</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of nurses at hospitals across Britain
held strikes, rallies and marches today in a last-minute attempt to
get the Conservative government to allocate more money to the
National Health Service.
   Bus services were halted or slowed on dozens of routes as crews
at some some London transport centers walked out in sympathy, said
London Regional Transport spokesman Graham White.
   In London, where about 500 nurses mounted picket lines at 15
hospitals, nurses delivered a cake with a message to Chancellor of
the Exchequer Nigel Lawson, who will unveil the budget in
Parliament on Tuesday.
   ``We hope we will get a bigger slice of the budget,'' said
19-year-old student nurse Sue Hogg.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's government, expected to make
substantial tax cuts, has ruled out a big increase in the service's
$41 billion budget.
   Mrs. Thatcher has ordered a review of the service and plans to
encourage more Britons to take out private health insurance.
   Outside the capital, strikes were ``fairly limited,'' according
to the Confederation of Health Service Employees, one of two health
unions sponsoring the protest.
   The third major union, the Royal College of Nurses, has a
no-strike code of principle.
   Overall, 515,000 nurses work in Britain.
   In Northern Ireland, a British province, 10,000 nurses took part
in protest marches. In Wales, nurses presented a 60,000-signature
petition to the Health Department.
   Outside London, strikes were reported at two hospitals in
Manchester and one in Cheshire, in Yorkshire and Wakefield, and at
St. James General Hospital and other hospitals in Leeds.
   Pickets or marches were held in Brighton, Bristol, Nottingham,
Leicester, Coventry, Birmingham, and Coventry.

   Business inventories rose 0.4 percent in

   The Commerce Department said the gain in inventories pushed them
up by $3 billion in January to a seasonally adjusted $705.85
billion.
   The inventory increase came as total business sales were falling
0.7 percent to a seasonally adjusted $462.78 billion in January,
reversing much of the big 1.2 percent December increase in sales.
   The January gain in inventories held on shelves and backlots
followed an even larger 0.9 percent increase in December. The
Janaury rise was held back by a 1 percent decline in inventories
held by retailers.
   This decrease reflected primarily a 3.3 percent drop in the
backlog of unsold cars as dealers offered new incentive programs to
spur lagging sales.
   Analysts had worried that a huge rise in unsold inventories
during the final three months of the year would force production
cutbacks and weak economic growth in the early part of 1988.
   But economists have recently modified their views somewhat,
contending that the slowdown in growth in the early part of this
year will not be as severe as they had feared.
   The 1 percent decline in inventories held at the retail level
was accompanied by an increase of 1.6 percent in inventories at the
wholesale level and a 0.8 percent rise in manufacturing inventories.
   The 0.7 percent overall sales decline was led by a 1.7 percent
drop in sales by manufacturers and a 0.2 percent decline in sales
at the retail level. Sales at the wholesale level rose 0.4 percent
in January.
   In an advance report on Friday, the government said that retail
sales in February had risen by 0.6 percent.
   The combination of falling sales and rising inventories pushed
the inventory-to-sales ratio up from 1.51 in December to 1.53 in
January. That means it would take 1.53 months to exhaust
inventories at the January sales pace, still a ratio that is not
considered abnormally high.

<HEAD>Documents Released In Copper-7 Lawsuit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Company documents reveal that G.D. Searle
& Co. misled doctors and federal officials about safety
characteristics of its Copper-7 contraceptive device, according to
lawyers for the plaintiff in a lawsuit.
   According to documents released last week by a federal court,
Searle apparently hid complaints about the Copper-7 from the Food
and Drug Administration, lawyers said.
   Eventually, an FDA task force recommended that a federal grand
jury investigate whether any laws were broken by Searle's allegedly
misleading reports on animal studies for a number of products,
including the Copper-7. No charges were filed.
   Paul Strain, an attorney for Searle, said testimony and
documents not yet made public will show the company did not mislead
anyone.
   The Copper-7 was a popular intrauterine device from 1974 to
1988, when Searle withdrew it from the market citing the costs of
lawsuits claiming it caused health problems. Many American women
continue to use Copper-7 IUDs and Searle recently resumed
manufacturing the device in order to fill foreign orders.
   The Searle documents, produced for a May 16 trial in St. Paul,
became public last Thursday on order of U.S. District Judge Robert
Renner. The judge rejected Searle's arguments that the internal
company memorandums be kept confidential because of trade secrets
and other reasons.
   ``These documents can be characterized as the tip of the
iceberg,'' said Michael Ciresi, a Minneapolis attorney who
represents Esther Kociemba, a Melrose woman who claims to have been
made infertile by the Copper-7.
   ``Once all the documents are disclosed (to the public), they
will collectively establish without a doubt that the Copper-7
causes (infection) and Searle knew about it, but did not disclose
it to doctors or to women,'' Coresi said.
   Nationally, there have been 17 trials over Searle's Copper-7, 14
of them decided in the company's favor.
   Kociemba's case ``will be the first case tried against Searle
where the jury will be presented with evidence from Searle's files
showing what Searle knew about the hazards of the IUD, when they
knew about them and what they did about them _ which was to conceal
the information,'' Ciresi said.
   Strain said, ``We are confident when a jury hears all the
evidence, reviews all the documents and, most importantly, hears
from the doctors that they will conclude the Copper-7 is a good IUD
that does not cause infection.''
   A major issue will be whether Copper-7's withdrawal ``tail''
string was a single strand of polypropylene incapable of
transporting infection-causing bacteria into the uterus, as Searle
contends, or if it was made up of many tiny strands that could act
as a tunnel for bacteria, as Ciresi contends.
   One of the Searle documents quotes a company official saying for
the first time that, although the Copper-7 string is considered a
single line, it actually is a ``bundle of fused micro-filaments.''

   A federal judge today denied for a second
time Lynette ``Squeaky'' Fromme's request for a no-contest plea to
an escape charge and began calling a jury to hear the case against
the Manson disciple and would-be presidential assassin.
   Fromme, who said she intends to act as her own lawyer, said she
wanted to ``disperse with this case as simply as possible.''
   Fromme, 39, is serving a life sentence for a 1975 assassination
attempt on then-President Gerald Ford. She escaped Dec. 23 from the
Federal Correctional Institution at Alderson and was recaptured
about two miles away on Christmas Day after a massive manhunt.
   ``I admit committing the escape,'' she said. ``I was away for
two days.''
   Fromme told U.S. District Judge Elizabeth Hallanan that the case
``doesn't warrant a jury trial'' and professed herself ``willing to
accept whatever sentence you hand down to me.''
   But Fromme failed today to ask for ``bench trial,'' which would
have left the decision in the judge's hands without calling a jury.
   Court officials said 50 potential jurors had been called to be
questioned by Fromme and assistant U.S. Attorney J. Kirk Brandfess.
   Fromme is a follower of Charles Manson, a mass murderer serving
a life sentence in California.
   Ford was unharmed when a Secret Service agent grabbed a
semi-automatic .45-caliber pistol aimed at him by Fromme on Sept.
5, 1975.
   In San Francisco 17 days later, Ford escaped injury when Sara
Jane Moore fired a revolver at him. She eventually pleaded guilty
and received a life sentence.
   In 1979, Moore also escaped from the Alderson prison, but was
recaptured hours later about 25 miles away. She is now in a federal
prison in Pleasanton, Calif.

Disease</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Scientists at Yale University are
planning to transplant brain cells from aborted fetuses into
patients with Parkinson's disease in an effort to find a treatment
for the crippling disease.
   Doctors in Mexico and Sweden recently performed similar tests
but physicians say it is too early to tell if they succeeded in
reducing or eliminating the effects of the disease. The procedure
has not been attempted in the United States.
   Yale researchers say they are ready to try the procedure on
humans after having tested it on monkeys.
   ``Based upon the technical problems and what we have to do, I
think there is a good chance we will be ready to do a human
sometime within the year,'' said Dr. D. Eugene Redmond Jr.,
professor of psychiatry at Yale and director of the neurobehavior
laboratory at Yale's School of Medicine.
   Redmond said in a recent interview the use of fetal tissue
raises many ethical questions.
   Those questions include how tissue should be obtained from
aborted fetuses without violating the sanctity of human life,
whether the method of abortion should be altered to preserve the
tissue and if the technology could foster a new industry geared to
the production of human cells for transplant.
   Also at issue is how to obtain permission for transplant from a
woman who aborts her fetus, or whether it is needed at all.
   ``Abortion is a tragedy,'' Redmond said. ``But as long as it
occurs, I believe it is immoral to let tissue and materials go to
waste if it can cure people who are suffering and dying.''
   Arthur Caplan, director of the Center for Biomedical Ethics at
the University of Minnesota, said only a few major medical centers
should conduct brain-cell transplants.
   ``Brain transplants is an environment in which charlatans,
quacks and ripoff artists can flourish,'' Caplan said.
   In his experiments, Redmond and his associates have reversed
disease-like symptoms in monkeys through grafting of fetal brain
cells.
   Parkinson's disease victims suffer from a lack dopamine, which
transmits nerve cell messages to the muscles. The disease is often
characterized by tremors, rigidity or loss of balance, and afflicts
at least 350,000 people in the United States.

   The Reagan administration would not say today
whether it would try to extradite Panamanian strongman Manuel
Antonio Noriega on drug trafficking charges if he seeks asylum in
Spain.
   ``Whatever arrangements he makes with another country are his
business,'' said White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater. ``We
intend to follow the legal process.''
   Reagan has the legal authority to move to dismiss drug
indictments against Noriega. Or, the United States could press for
Noriega's extradition and seek to prosecute him. Fitzwater refused
to clear up which legal course would be pursued.
   ``We don't have any comment,'' the spokesman said at a White
House news briefing.
   Officials in Spain have said that government would be willing to
grant asylum to Noriega under certain conditions _ including the
proviso that the United States would promise not to try to
extradite him after he arrived in Spain.
   Reagan on Friday called for Noriega to step down and end his
``illegitimate'' regime. To force Noriega's ouster, the
administration has applied a series of sanctions against Panama,
including the withholding of about $6.6 million in payments
relating to the operation of the Panama Canal.

   A fourth diplomat escaped injury and pursued the gunman, the
government-owned New Nigerian reported. It said the assailant
escaped over a nearby wall.
   The four Saudis were fired upon as they left the Eko Holiday Inn

apparently had been waiting for them.
   Two of the wounded diplomats were in serious condition, while
the third suffered a less severe wound, the newspaper said. Their

   Both police and the Saudi Embassy refused to answer questions
about the incident.
   The New Nigerian quoted police sources who said witnesses
described the gunman as an Arab.
   There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the shootings.
   A Libyan diplomat was shot and killed in Lagos in January.
Police said the diplomat was slain by robbers who were caught.
Government and police sources said they could not rule out the
possibility that the Libyan had been killed by Chadians.

<TEXT>
   Jim Bakker has returned to the pulpit for
the first time in more than a year, preaching from a small wooden
lectern to elderly, suntanned retirees at a trailer park in
California.
   Tammy Faye Bakker introduced her husband to the crowd of 225
campers at a service Sunday in Niland, Calif., according to a
report in today's editions of The Charlotte Observer.
   The campers were seated on folding metal chairs in a bingo hall
that doubles as a chapel, with a folding metal table serving as an
altar, the newspaper said.
   ``This has been a long, hard year for us,'' Mrs. Bakker said.
``It hasn't been easy ... I am very happy to introduce to you my
husband. I would like to welcome him back to the place where he
belongs, in the pulpit, ministering the Gospel of Jesus Christ.
   Jim Bakker, defrocked in May after the sex-and-money scandal
over PTL, chose the remote corner of the California desert to
preach again because his uncle, Charles ``Lonnie'' Irwin, is pastor
of the park's Lutheran congregation during the winter.
   Curious campers began arriving an hour before the 9 a.m.
service. Thirty people who couldn't fit inside the building
listened through window screens.
   One regular member of the congregation whispered to a friend:
``It's not just the ordinary congregation. It's just a big show.
How many people came to worship, really? How many came to just
look.?''
   It has been nearly one year since Bakker gave up his ministry at
PTL, south of Charlotte, admitting he had sex with Jessica Hahn and
that money had been promised to keep her silent.
   Bakker preached about friendship for 30 minutes, then grinned
and hugged members of the congregation.
   ``I've always said over the years if I could give you a gift,
the most important gift would be a good friend,'' Bakker said
during his sermon. ``That's besides Jesus.''
   Bakker quoted again and again from the Bible about the value of
a good friend and God's commandment to love one's enemies.
   After Bakker ended his sermon with a prayer, the congregation
clapped. He and his wife then greeted everyone as they walked out
the door. Jeannie Morgan, 63, of Stanford, Wash., looked ecstatic
after she shook their hands.
   ``Seeing the real thing and having it here is perfect,'' she
said.

   Poland, in an attempt to cash in on the
popularity of Polish-born Pope John Paul II, has struck new gold
coins with the papal image and will sell them in the United States
for $8,800 apiece.
   It is the most precious coin issued by the Polish national mint
since World War II.
   The state-run PAP news agency said Monday the coin is 12.6
ounces of pure gold and has a face value 200,000 zlotys, but will
be worth 12 million zlotys.
   At the black-market exchange rate of 1,360 zlotys to the dollar,
12 million zlotys is about $8,800. PAP said the coins would be sold
for $8,800 in the United States.
   Poland produced silver coins with the pope's image in 1982,
prior to the second visit to his homeland of the former archbishop
of Krakow, Karol Wojtyla.
   The new coins were contracted by a U.S. company, and will be
sold through coin dealers in the United States, said Zbigniew
Marski of the National Bank of Poland. He declined to identify the
U.S. company.
   It will be illegal to buy the coins in Poland, even for dollars,
PAP said.

<HEAD>EPA Decides Against Special Scrutiny Of Cancer-Causing Potential</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After 18 months of review, the Environmental
Protection Agency has decided not to subject a common herbicide to
special scrutiny of its cancer-causing potential.
   Subsequent studies have failed to confirm that 2,4-D causes
cancer, despite a 1986 finding by the National Cancer Institute
that Kansas wheat farmers who mixed their own 2,4-D more than 20
times a year stood an eight-fold greater chance of developing a
cancer of the lymphatic system called non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, an
agency spokesman said.
   The study said home and garden users were not exposed to enough
2,4-D to cause concern.
   Sold under dozens of trade names, 2,4-D _ short for
dichlorophenoxyacetic acid _ is believed the fourth most widely
used pesticide in the nation, with more than 39 million pounds of
active ingredient sold in 1985.
   The great bulk of that is believed to be used for broadleaf weed
control in wheat fields, though 2,4-D also is widely used on
highway rights of way, on lawns and in forests.
   Despite EPA's decision, Chemlawn Inc., a major lawn care
company, will not restore 2,4-D to its products until a special
National Cancer Institute study of its employees _ of whom perhaps
3,000 used 2,4-D on 80 or so occasions per year _ is completed,
said spokesman Steve Hardymon in Columbus, Ohio.
   Hardymon said EPA ``probably is right.''
   But Diane Baxter, staff scientist for the National Coalition
Against the Misuse of Pesticides, said of the decision, ``I think
it's outrageous.''
   EPA, she said, appeared to have given great weight to animal
studies showing no cancer-causing potential by 2,4-D.
   ``We only do animal studies when we don't have human studies,''
but in this case a good study of humans _ the Kansas farmers _ was
disregarded, she said.
   Another chemically related herbicide, 2,4,5-T, ``was banned
mostly because of birth defects (among humans) in the Pacific
Northwest ... and that (study) is not anywhere near as hard to
refute as the study NCI did.''
   EPA spokesman Al Heier, confirming trade press reports of the
agency's decision, said Friday, ``It was a tough call.''
   In addition to the animal studies that failed to show an effect,
``I think there are quite a few (human) epidemiology studies'' that
also fail to confirm the cancer-causing ability of 2,4-D.
   Chemlawn says it knows of at least five human studies that show
no cancer effect from 2,4-D. The company did not detail those, but
a pair of studies of farm and forest workers in New Zealand is
frequently cited.
   The first study found elevated incidence of non-Hodgkins
lymphoma and another cancer called multiple myeloma, but did not
examine exposure to pesticides. The second study, however, found no
excess risk of cancer as a result of exposure to chemicals of the
2,4-D class.
   The herbicide 2,4-D aroused suspicion because it can be
contaminated with small amounts of chemicals related to the
dioxins, though there are no U.S. reports, and only one abroad, of
contamination with the most toxic form of dioxin. That form of
dioxin is the most powerful cancer-causing agent ever tested in the
laboratory.
   The contaminants of 2,4-D generally have only about 1 percent of
the cancer-causing power of the most toxic dioxin.

<HEAD>The British Are Coming, But Not All Falklanders Thrilled</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN LEONARD</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>STANLEY, Falkland Islands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The prospect of British
soldiers staging war games on the Falkland Islands is making some
islanders a bit uneasy about upsetting Argentina, which still
claims sovereignty over the tiny archipelago.
   Less than a thousand troops are expected to be flown in Thursday
for the military exercise, a test of how quickly Britain can
respond to an island invasion.
   Some islanders say they feel reassured by the 24-day drill, but
others fear it unnecessarily provokes the Argentines, who lost the
war with Britain over the islands in 1982.
   ``The situation between us and Argentina is so delicate that
these exercises are bound to be a cause of trouble,'' said islander
Nicola Colbert.
   ``I can understand there are excellent possibilities for
training down here, but I feel the exercise is not a very good
thing from the point of view of our relations with Argentina.''
   But resident Claudette Ceballos supports the war games.
   ``I think the Argentines are being a bit silly,'' she said.
``They are overreacting, as they always do. If they hadn't kicked
up such a fuss, I probably wouldn't have given the whole exercise a
thought.''
   George Betts, a boat captain, said Argentina has no say in the
matter.
   ``This place is British, and what happens to it is the problem
of the British and us,'' he said. ``It has nothing whatsoever to do
with the Argentines.''
   Argentina has led a chorus of Latin American protest against
Operation Fire Focus, as the exercise is named. Britain has denied
it is provoking Argentina.
   But after initially refusing to say how many troops would be
involved, Britain has sought to allay the objections by announcing
that only a force of fewer than 1,000 soldiers would be flown in.
   British authorities want to insulate the troops from the
populace. Maj. Gen. Neil Carlier, commander of British forces on
the islands, says contact will be kept to a minimum.
   The settlers, however, will be asked to report sightings of
soldiers who might be playing the enemy's role during the exercise
on the rocky, windswept islands, he told a news conference last
week.
   Carlier denied reports that farms would be used as targets of
mock attacks, and said wildlife sanctuaries would be avoided.
   Plans reportedly have been made for the half-dozen tourists
presently on the islands to be fishing or bird-watching far from
the action while Operation Fire Focus is under way.
   The exercise technically began March 7, with mock intelligence
reports being sent to London about enemy troop movements against
the islands. It concludes March 31.
   In 1982, when Argentina seized the islands, the absence of a
runway capable of taking long-range aircraft meant Britain had to
respond by sea. It took weeks for a naval task force to make the
8,000-mile voyage.
   During that time the Argentines dug in, and were dislodged only
after a 74-day war that claimed the lives of 712 Argentine and 258
British servicemen.
   Britain has since spent $690 million on an airport in the
islands that can accommodate troop flights in case of another
attack.
   Falklanders have grown used to the luxury of an airport that can
get them directly to Britain, and there have been some grumblings
at the disruptions travelers are likely to suffer during the
exercise.

<TEXT>
   The communist world gets its first
McDonald's next week, and some people here are wondering whether
its American hamburgers will be as popular as the local fast-food
treat, Pljeskavica.
   The long-awaited opening of the restaurant on one of Belgrade's
main downtown squares will take place March 24, the Yugoslav news
agency Tanjug reported, and it will offer Big Macs, fries and the
other specialities familiar to McDonald's customers in the West.
   The Belgrade media have suggested that the success of the
American restaurant depends on its acceptance by Yugoslavians who
are long accustomed to the hamburger-like Pljeskavica.
   Pljeskavica is made of ground pork and onions, and it is served
on bread and eaten with the hands. It is sold at fast-food
restaurants across the country and costs about a dollar.
   ``In fact, this is a clash between the Big Mac and
Pljeskavica,'' said an official of Genex, Yugoslavia's largest
state-run enterprise that will operate the McDonald's.
   John Onoda, a spokesman at McDonald's Oak Brook, Ill.,
headquarters, said it was the first of the chain's outlets in a
communist country.
   The next East European McDonald's is scheduled to be opened in
Budapest, Hungary, by the end of this year, said Vesna Milosevic,
another Genex official.
   Negotiations have been going on for years for expanding the
fast-food chain to the Soviet Union, but no agreement has been
announced.

   Four armed Mexican naval personnel
who said they were pursuing drug smugglers apparently interrogated
a group of American picnickers on a beach more than a half mile
north of the U.S.-Mexican border, authorities said.
   The four Mexicans were arrested Sunday night, said San Diego
County sheriff's Sgt. Bob Ramirez.
   The four men, whose names were being withheld, interrogated a
group of 10 to 15 U.S. citizens who were picnicking on the beach,
said Dale Cozart, chief agent for the U.S. Border Patrol in San
Diego.
   ``It's a very serious situation,'' Cozart said today. ``Our
investigation is not complete at this time, but it's possible the
Americans were being interrogated against their will.''
   Border Patrol agents scanning the area in a helicopter spotted
the four men dressed in Mexican naval infantry uniforms and armed
with fully loaded automatic rifles, Cozart said. The weapons were
standard military issue, he added.
   ``Initial statements taken were that they were pursuing
narcotics smugglers. But that has not been confirmed and there is
no indication that narcotics were being smuggled in the area at the
time,'' Cozart said.
   Local residents frequently picnic on the beach into the night,
but Cozart said authorities had not been able to speak to any of
the picnickers because they scattered when the helicopter hovered
overhead.
   The Mexican men said they had been chasing two suspected drug or
arms smugglers up the beach when they were discovered. The Mexicans
headed south and were intercepted before they could get across the
border.
   In Mexico City, spokesmen for the foreign ministry and the
Mexican navy said they had no information on the incident.
   The men were being held at the Border Patrol's San Ysidro sector
station, solely for investigation of immigration violations, he
said.
   ``There is no doubt that the individuals knew they were in the
United States,'' the agent said.
   He added that any other allegations, including possible weapons
violations, would be considered at a later time.
   Five sheriff's deputies were called to assist in the arrests,
which occurred without incident, Cozart said.
   State Department officials as well as the Mexican consulate in
San Diego and Mexican military officials were notified of the
arrests.

   The PLO ambassador to the United Nations
declared today he will defy a U.S. order to close his mission and
said that if his office is closed, Israel should be excluded from
debates on the Middle East.
   ``We have the right to stay here, we will stay here and we will
stay where we are,'' Zehdi Labib Terzi, the permanent observer of
the Palestine Liberation Organization, told a news conference here.
   The General Assembly may reconvene this week in an emergency
session to consider the confrontation between the United States and
the 159-member world body, U.N. officials said.
   Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar today was drafting a
letter to protest the U.S. decision to close the PLO's U.N.
Observer Mission under a controversial anti-terrorism law.
   ``If somebody tries to kick us out, we will not respond,'' Terzi
said, adding he had no plans to leave the United States where his
mission has operated for the last 13 years.
   ``The only way they will make me leave is to put me behind bars
and take me away.''
   The PLO envoy also said that if the PLO Mission is closed, as
ordered by the Justice Department, then the General Assembly should
deny Israel the right to participate in U.N. debates on the Middle
East.
   ``If the Palestinian people are not allowed to be here,'' he
said, ``then out of a sense of fairness and justice, the other
party to the conflict should not be here _ namely Israel.''
   Terzi was responding to a U.S. Justice Department statement on
Friday that it would enforce the law to close the PLO's U.N.
Observer Mission by March 21.
   The United Nations has strongly protested the U.S. move to
enforce the law. It says the act violates the U.N. Charter and the
1947 treaty by which the United States agreed to allow U.N.
missions to operate.
   The PLO is an invitee of the United Nations.
   The General Assembly convened in an emergency session two weeks
ago and urged the United States to comply with international law
and allow the mission to operate. It said it would convene again if
the United States decided to enforce the act.

   President Reagan demanded today that Congress
keep his ``Star Wars'' missile defense system alive, arguing that
cutting the high-tech program because of domestic budget pressures
would be ``irresponsible in the extreme.''
   Reagan, kicking off an administration campaign keyed to the
program's fifth anniversary, charged that congressional cuts in his
Strategic Defense Initiative have ``set the program back one to two
years.''
   Even though Reagan has reached the point in his presidency where
he has sent his last budget to Congress, he pledged in an address
to the Institute for Foreign Policy Analysis to see the program
continued.
   And he lauded the technological advances that have been made,
asserting that the program has ``progressed more rapidly'' than
first thought possible.
   ``We will continue to research SDI, to develop and test it, and
as it becomes ready, we will deploy it,'' Reagan vowed.
   The president restated his belief that without the space-based
missile defense, the United States will be left defenseless in the
face of an advanced Soviet space-weapons program.
   ``A recent report by the Department of Defense called `The
Soviet space challege' warns that the Soviet space program points
in one disturbing direction. ... the methodical pursuit of a
war-fighting capability in space,'' Reagan charged.
   Because Congress has made cuts for the past four years in
administration SDI requests, ``We would be dangerously
undeprepared,'' Reagan asserted.
   ``There's been a tendency by some in Congress to discuss SDI as
if its funding could be determined purely by domestic
considerations, unconnected to what the Soviets are doing,'' Reagan
said, ``That is, to put it plainly, irresponsible in the extreme.''
   The president argued that ``some in the U.S. Congress'' have
denied additional funds ``because they say SDI won't work. Well, it
won't if we don't develop it and test it.''
   ``Congress should realize that it is no longer a question of
whether there will be a SDI program or not. The only question will
be whether the Soviets are the only ones who have strategic
defenses while the United States remains entirely defenseless,''
Reagan said.
   The pro-SDI campaign comes as Congress has placed constraints on
SDI testing and expenditures, and as Soviet arms control
negotiators in Geneva attempt to crimp the U.S. effort amid
negotiations on a U.S.-Soviet treaty to slash strategic nuclear
weapon arsenals by half.
   The president has rarely missed a chance to plug the U.S.
effort. Even at a light-hearted commemorative ceremony last week to
honor Notre Dame's legendary football coach Knute Rockne, Reagan's
speech contained a passage referring to the ``dark side'' of the
world's technological progress and arguing that his plan would
solve the nuclear dilemma.
   He pointed to the millions of civilians and military killed in
World Wars I and II, and said if a third worldwide conflagration
occurs in the nuclear age, ``it's estimated that 90 percent of the
casualties will be civilian.''
   The president said SDI would ``point the way out'' of this
problem.
   ``It's given us the promise of basing our security in the future
on protection rather than the threat of retaliation. SDI offers a
chance to reverse not only the nuclear arms build-up, but also to
reverse the trend that in effect has put a lower and lower value on
human life,'' Reagan said.
   Opponents of the program argue that it will cost untold billions
and won't work, and that it will only encourage the Soviets to
abandon arms control efforts and increase their offensive weapons
in order to best U.S. defensive systems.
   In the last fiscal year, the administration sought $5.7 billion
for Star Wars, but Congress allowed only $3.6 billion.
   Capitol Hill also banned the use of federal funds for any SDI
tests that would violate a strict interpretation of the 1972
Antiballistic Missile Treaty. Pentagon officials including Defense
Secretary Frank Carlucci have said no such tests are planned for
the near future.
   While the Soviet Union has argued that the ABM Treaty forbids
much research, testing and development of an SDI system, the Reagan
administration has insisted on a so-called ``broad'' interpretation
of the treaty that would permit expanded SDI tests and development.
   Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev, at their December
summit, in essence agreed to disagree for a time on the issue,
saying in a joint communique they would observe the ABM Treaty ``as
signed in 1972, while conducting their research, development and
testing as required.''
   U.S. and Soviet negotiators in Geneva have remained at odds over
how to address the issue.

   The 70-year-old founder of the
1,150-mile Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race lost the lead again today
when two other teams beat him to the Bering Sea coast after
battling biting wind and drifting snow during the night.
   Martin Buser of Big Lake arrived at this Eskimo village at 5:49
a.m. with 13 dogs in harness. Defending champion Susan Butcher
pulled in at 5:57 a.m. with 12 dogs.
   Race founder Joe Redington lost the lead a second time somewhere
between Kaltag and Unalakleet along the frozen Yukon River. He
arrived in Unalakleet at 6:42 a.m. with nine dogs.
   Unalakleet is 889 miles from the race's start in Anchorage, and
269 miles from the finish in Nome. From Unalakleet, the teams run
north along the barren, windswept coast. The next checkpoint is
Shaktoolik, 40 miles farther up the trail.
   Redington had paced the race for more than 400 miles, and then
lost the lead to Buser on Saturday along the Yukon River. But in
the dark outside Kaltag, Redington jumped back out front. Buser had
trailed Redington out of Kaltag by more than two hours.
   Redington started the race with 15 dogs and had dropped six of
them at checkpoints along the trail by Sunday. Race rules require
mushers to arrive in Nome with at least five dogs in harness.
   The race started March 5 in Anchorage. The first musher to Nome
will collect $30,000 of a $150,000 purse; the next 19 finishers
will split the rest. Three of the 52 teams that started the race
have dropped out.
   Following the three leaders out of Kaltag on Sunday were
four-time champion Rick Swenson, Joe Garnie of Teller in fifth
place, and Herbie Nayokpuk of Shishmaref, who for days had held a
close second behind Redington, fell to sixth.
   American mushers from outside Alaska were paced by Robin
Jacobson of Minnetonka, Minn., in 15th place. John Patten of Grand
Marais, Minn., was 22nd; Frank Teasley, Jackson, Wyo., 26th; Terry
Adkins, Mikado, Mich., 34th; Dan McEachen, Snowmass Village, Colo.,
29th; and Stan Ferguson, Philadelphia, 46th.
   Jacques Philip, of Thomery, France, led the foreign mushers in
14th place. Horst Maas, of Lenz, Austria, was in 23rd; Peter
Thomann of Tagish in Canada's Yukon Territory, was 31st; Ian
Mackenzie of Bruce Mines, Ontario, 40th; Brian Carver of Melbourne,
Australia, 44th; and Lesley Anne Monk of Worsthorne, England, 48th.

<DATELINE>HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Farmers who prayed for rain during a
devastating three-year drought have faced nearly four months of
almost daily downpours, which threaten to wash away any chance of
an agricultural rebound.
   The rains that began in November have caused widespread flooding
in rural areas, swelling rivers, turning streets into streams, and
virtually isolating some villages by knocking out phone lines and
bridges.
   It also has severely hampered the recovery of farmers who five
months ago were in the throes of drought, the Agriculture Minstry
said Monday.
   Last week, eight soldiers drowned while fording a flood-swollen
river in the eastern highlands. By the weekend, police said 66
people had been killed by lightning since the first storms broke.
   ``We're working all hours and weekends too,'' said Temba
Munyarara, a handyman who works mainly in poor black suburbs.
``It's sad to see the damage that's being done but it's been good
for me.''
   It is in the countryside, where most of Zimbabwe's 8.2 million
people live, that floods threaten agricultural recovery after the
long drought. About 70 percent of the population depends on
agriculture for income.
   Likewise, the bulk of the land-locked nation's export income
comes from cash crops such as cotton, coffee, corn, sugar, tea and
tobacco.
   Last year, agricultural output fell 18 percent, or $180 million,
as a result of drought.
   Business Trends, the Standard Chartered Bank's monthly economic
analysis, reported that the losses would be recouped with the onset
of the regular rains.
   But the agriculture ministry's most recent crop and livestock
report says that in most areas, further widespread rain will ``do
more harm than good.''
   Cotton, peanuts and tobacco are being severely damaged, the
report said, but it predicted that if the rains ease off, Zimbabwe
still can expect bumper harvests.
   The report also said ample water has been stored underground and
in lakes and dams to carry Zimbabwe through the coming dry season,
which usually lasts from May to October.

<TEXT>
   Placido Domingo and Agnes Baltsa are two opera
stars who know how to put passion and drama into their singing even
when they're not performing in a staged production.
   The tenor and the mezzo-soprano demonstrated their talents in a
gala concert Sunday night at the Metropolitan Opera. The benefit
for the Met pension fund was sponsored by the Metropolitan Opera
Guild and followed by a champagne supper, underwritten by Merrill
Lynch and Co.
   Since most operatic love duets are written for tenors and
sopranos, Domingo and Miss Baltsa sang three duets of a more
confrontational nature. Their voices blended beautifully but made
the sparks fly.
   They sang a dramatic scene from Verdi's ``Aida,'' in which
Amneris makes one last offer to Radames _ take me and save your
life. Even on that basis, he turns her down.
   They sang Santuzza angrily accusing Turiddu of being unfaithful
in Mascagni's ``Cavalleria Rusticana'' and Turiddu being angry
back, lying and denying it.
   And, building to the most familiar but still the most
spine-tingling, they sang Don Jose pleading with Carmen to take him
back in Act 4 of Bizet's ``Carmen.'' When she turns him down, he
stabs her to death. In that number, the chorus, facing the
audience, was too loud. In staged performances, the chorus is
behind the ``bullring'' at the back of the stage.
   Domingo has a glorious voice for everything he sang. In a
``Luisa Miller'' aria, for instance, he was vocally always
masculine and strong but could at the same time sound soft and
tender in the quiet lines. He was completely equal to the Verdi
music but never overpowered it.
   Miss Baltsa's voice sounds dark in its low tones and light,
almost white, in its top. There isn't a break in her register; her
voice seems to shade gradually. In her first aria, from Rossini's
``The Lady of the Lake,'' it was a bit disconcerting. Then one
became used to it. She used that shading and other vocal colors to
strong dramatic effect, especially as Carmen.
   She sang the title role in ``Carmen'' at the Met last season.
This season the concert is her only appearance.
   Domingo, who made his Met debut in ``Cavalleria Rusticana,'' is
singing in ``The Tales of Hoffmann'' and ``Otello'' at the Met this
season.
   Nello Santi conducted. The orchestra played overtures by Rossini
and Verdi and a Mascagni intermezzo and sounded clear and fresh.
The chorus, with the women in gowns of their choice, also sounded
splendid in Verdi's ``Anvil Chorus'' from ``Il Trovatore'' and
``Va, pensiero'' from ``Nabucco.''

   An archaeological team has found pottery from a
vessel that sank about 2,400 years ago in the Mediterranean Sea, a
spokesman for the group said Monday.
   Divers found the wreck site buried in mud and silt in the crater
of a submerged volcano near the island of Isola Panarea off
northern Sicily, said the spokesman for Marine Archaeological
Research for Europe.
   One diver wrote in the team's log that the wreck looks ``as if
the gods had been sitting down to a banquet, and then, for some
reason, they had to dash off, overturning the tables in their haste
and knocking down all the crockery,'' the spokesman said.
   The cups, plates, jugs, bowls and lamps are made of red clay and
painted with a high-quality, black glaze, said the spokeman, who
asked not to be identified.
   ``All that is visible on the seabed is a spread of pottery,'' he
said. ``It is too early to judge with any confidence how much of
the wreck survives.

   Rebels derailed and ransacked a passenger
train, killing at least five people, a government newspaper
reported Monday.
   The Islamic Information Center newspaper Focus, however,
reported that 30 people died in the Uganda People's Army attack
Saturday near Nagongera, about 140 miles east of the capital city
of Kampala.
   Focus said the dead included civilians and eight government
soldiers who were disarmed and shot to death by the rebels.
   The government-owned New Vision newspaper said the attack took
place on a newly reopened route.
   An unidentified passenger said the rebels initially asked
passengers for money and clothes and left people in their underwear.
   The rebels are among more than half a dozen groups fighting
President Yoweri Museveni's government. They say they are loyal to
Peter Otai, defense minister under former President Milton Obote,
who ruled from 1980-85.
   Museveni seized power in 1986 after waging a five-year bush war.

<TEXT>
   Both the United States and the Soviet Union
are developing powerful microwave generators to assess the effects
of such beams on their air, land and naval forces, according to a
university researcher.
   H. Keith Florig, a radiation policy specialist at
Carnegie-Mellon University in Pittsburgh, says the sophisticated
electronics used in U.S. and NATO weapon systems could make them
particularly vulnerable to attack.
   ``The biggest fear is that an enemy might use high-power
microwaves (HPM) to jam or burn out the electronic hardware upon
which many military systems rely. Both strategic and tactical
systems are possible targets _ missiles, re-entry vehicles,
satellites, aircraft, tanks, radars, and communications and
navigation equipment,'' Florig wrote in the March issue of the IEEE
Spectrum, a journal published by the Institute of Electrical and
Electronics Engineers.
   He observed that ``because the forces of the United States and
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization depend more heavily on
sensitive electronics in `smart weapons' and sophisticated radars
than do Soviet and Warsaw Pact forces, the West could be more
vulnerable to microwave weapons.''
   Decisions on whether to deploy microwave weapons are still
several years off, Florig said.
   However, the Pentagon said last year in its annual ``Soviet
Military Power'' report that the Soviet Union has completed enough
research that ``no significant technological obstacles stand in the
way of a prototype short-range tactical RF (radio-frequency)
weapon.''
   Another Defense Department publication, ``The Soviet Space
Challenge,'' issued last November, said ``the Soviets could test a
ground-based radio-frequency weapon capable of damaging satellites
in the 1990s.''
   Florig said there are ``obvious ethical issues'' involved in
further development and deploying of microwave weapons, in view of
their potentially fatal effects on troops.
   ``HPM weapons that merely stun the nervous system temporarily
seem, like short-acting chemical agents, to be more humane than
lethal force,'' he said. ``But HPM weapons that blind, burn or bake
people to death are likely to be viewed as an abhorrent addition to
the arsenal.''
   The difference between a disabling and lethal microwave power
level is largly one of range, Florig said, adding that ``pulsed HPM
weapons might be designed with pulse repetition rates too low to
harm people but with enough peak power to burn out hardware.''
   Military facilities involved in high-power microwave research
include Harry Diamond Laboratories in Adelphi, Md., a unit of the
Army's Electronics Research and Development Command; the Naval
Research Laboratory in Washington; the Naval Surface Weapons
Center, Dahlgren, Va.; and the Air Force Weapons Laboratory at
Kirtland AFB near Albuquerque, N.M.
   Research work also is being carried out at the Lawrence
Livermore National Laboratory, Livermore, Calif., and the Sandia
National Laboratory in Albuquerque.
   John Rosado, acting director of the research and technology
division at Harry Diamond Laboratories, told a symposium of
government and industry officials last August that ``the nature of
warfare will be completely changed by the use of these weapons.''
   Devices capable of generating high-power microwaves include the
magnetron and klystron, along with newer devices such as the
vircator (virtual-cathode oscillator), gyrotron, free-electron
laser and beam-plasma generator. All the devices function by
converting the kinetic energy of an electron beam into the
electromagnetic energy of a microwave beam.
   Florig said in a telephone interview that ``the Soviets have
traditionally been strong in certain sources like the gyrotron.
They may maintain a lead in some of those areas.
   ``But things are rapidly evening up, and the U.S. may currently
be ahead in some areas. For the areas where intense computation is
needed for design, the U.S. definitely has an advantage,'' he said.
   In his IEEE Spectrum article, Florig noted that the microwave
generator itself is only a small part of any high-power weapon
system.
   ``A major challenge of HPM weapon design is to develop power
supplies that are small and light enough to be used on mobile,
airborne or space platforms,'' he wrote.
   At very high power levels, microwave weapons might even detonate
missile warheads, bombs or artillery shells, in addition to burning
out electronic components, Florig said, while at lower intensities
microwaves can trigger ``spurious signals'' that might jam or
disable electronic circuitry.
   ``Several crashes of the Army's Blackhawk helicopter since 1982
are thought to have resulted from radio frequency interference with
their flight control systems when they were flying near ground- or
ship-based radar or communication transmitters,'' he said.

   Five thieves broke into a Brink's warehouse and
stole 25 cash boxes collected from a supermarket chain's automatic
tellers, police said Monday.
   The robbery Sunday was partly filmed by a surveillance camera,
but the fuzzy image failed to show the burglars' features, said
police Sgt. David Rivero. Technical experts were trying to enhance
the film.
   The boxes had been collected Saturday night, and because they
had been used all day it was doubtful there was much cash in each
box, he said.
   Police and Brink's of Florida Inc. officials were going through
teller records to determine how much money was taken. When full,
the boxes would have held an average of about $10,000.
   The camera showed five men breaking in the outside door of the
warehouse early Sunday. They made their way directly to the boxes,
Rivero said.
   The robbery was discovered when Brink's employees showed up for
work Sunday morning, he said.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A rare collection of early 1940s recordings of
native South Seas music which was found gathering dust in a widow's
attic was presented Monday to the Library of Congress.
   The collection, which went to the museum's American Folklife
Center, includes 143 acetate disc recordings of music from the
Marquesas Islands, Tahiti, Fiji, Samoa, New Caledonia, Bali, Java,
Madura and the Kangean Islands north of Java. The recordings were
made by Sheridan and Bruce Fahnestock of Long Island, N.Y., in 1940
and 1941.
   Touring the South Seas aboard a three-masted, 137-foot schooner,
the brothers collected Pacific bird specimens for the American
Museum of Natural History in New York, updated nautical charts for
the U.S. Hydrographic Office and recorded indigenous music for a
family foundation in New York.
   The Fahnestocks also made several shortwave radio broadcasts
from the Pacific that were carried live by the NBC network. A
recording of one such broadcast by Bruce Fahnestock from Fiji in
1940, taken from the library's collection of NBC transcriptions,
was played at Monday's ceremony.
   Their ship, Director II, struck a shoal and sank near Gladstone,
Australia, on Oct. 18, 1940, without loss of life, but the
Fahnestocks returned to the Pacific in February 1941 and chartered
a sailboat to make new recordings and secretly gather intelligence
for President Franklin D. Roosevelt in anticipation of war with
Japan.
   Besides the 16-inch, 78-rpm discs, which the Library of Congress
plans to clean and transcribe on tape, the Fahnestock collection
also includes five reels of color film, a ship's log and numerous
letters and magazine and newspaper articles about the expeditions.
   The collection had been stored in the attic of Sheridan
Fahnestock's widow, Margaret Fahnestock Lewis of Great Mills in
southern Maryland until she decided to donate the materials to the
Library of Congress in December 1986.
   It is the largest collection of Pacific Islands recordings ever
acquired by the library's Archive of Folk Culture, and the last
known attempt to record a documentary of traditional cultures in
that region before the mass disruptions of World War II.
   The library's American Folklife Center, established in 1976,
engages in scholarly research, preservation and presentation of
folk culture traditions.

<DATELINE>DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Hussain Muhammad Ershad has
declared that Islam will be the official religion of Bangladesh,
but critics say the move is merely a ploy to prevent his ouster and
woo the Moslem majority.
   Government officials on Monday were caught off guard by Ershad's
announcement, made the day before to a Moslem congregation in
Sarsina, 100 miles southwest of Dhaka.
   Ershad said the laws of Bangladesh should conform to the Moslem
code of conduct.
   ``The day-to-day life of the nation must be guided by the tenets
of Islam and the ideals of Prophet Mohammed,'' he said.
   An official at the Law Ministry said he had no information on
the change.
   ``We do not know what exactly the president wants to do,'' said
the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Eighty-five percent of Bangladesh's 105 million people are
Moslem, but the country has had a secular constitution since it
gained independence from Pakistan in 1971. Minority religions are
Christian, Hindu and Buddhist.
   Opposition parties, which have been calling since November for
the president's ouster, opposed the change. Parliament, which is
controlled by Ershad's Jatiya Party, is expected to debate the
change in April.
   ``This is an illegal government and illegal Parliament. It has
no right to enact any legislation,'' said Khaleda Zia, leader of
the Bangladesh Nationalist Party. Zia was referring to
parliamentary elections earlier this month that were boycotted by
opposition groups.
   The Moslem fundamentalist party, the Jamaat-e-Islami, also
opposed the move.
   ``A government which came to power illegally and is staying much
against the wishes of the people can never do any good to Islam,
the people or the country,'' said Ali Ahsan Mohammad Mujahid, a
Jamaat leader.
   Surenjit Sengupta of the opposition Awami League, said: ``This
is yet another gimmick by President Ershad to hang onto power.''
   But Wali Ashraf, an independent member of Parliament, said:
``Such a legislation will only reflect the faith of the vast
majority of the people.''
   Others believe the Islamic law, with its stringent punishments,
could curb crime and increase productivity.

<HEAD>Advertising Buys Fall Off in Illinois</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Only three presidential candidates ran
substantial television campaigns for Tuesday's Illinois primary, a
sharp contrast to the frenzied multi-million dollar advertising
buys that led up to Super Tuesday.
   The big spender in Illinois was Republican front-runner George
Bush, who bought about $400,000 worth of time.
   Two Democrats, Michael Du Gore Jr., were hoping
for respectable showings short of victory in a state that is
fielding two popular favorite sons.
   The Dukakis campaign said it was spending about $250,000 while
Gore media expenditures were estikakis and Albertmated at $200,000 to $300,000.
   The sparse media buys and tame ads were in contrast to the
charges and counter-charges that marred the airwaves ahead of last
week's far-flung Super Tuesday contests in 20 states.
   Bush was running two advertisements in Illinois _ one a
biographical spot and the other showing him with world leaders and
President Reagan.
   The latter ad, used since the New Hampshire primary last month,
says there is a difference between presidential and congressional
leadership. The point is to compare Bush favorably to rival Bob
Dole, the Senate Republican leader.
   However, Dole's chances of winning the GOP nomination plummeted
after he lost all 17 GOP contests last week, and he sharply cut
addition to mounting the strong TV campaign, she said.
   On the Democratic side, Illinois Sen. Paul Simon and Jesse
Jackson of Chicago were neck and neck as each sought a home-state
victory. Neither favorite son was running TV ads and Simon conceded
a lack of money for ads was hurting his prospects to beat Jackson.
   Polls showed Massachusetts Gov. Dukakis in third place with
Tennessee Sen. Gore and Rep. Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., lagging
behind.
   ``With the favorite sons in the race, obviously nobody expected
us to win Illinois,'' said Dukakis spokesman Steve Akey. ``The
objective is to be very competitive and to demonstrate that we can
do well all over the country.''
   To that end, Dukakis was running three ads, including two he
used for Super Tuesday _ a spot stressing his experience as a chief
executive and another in which a union official says Dukakis is not
a ``shot-and-beer kinda guy'' but his economic policies put people
to work.
   Dukakis introduced an new ad saying the days of backroom dealing
are over _ a response to Simon's contention that there will be no
first-ballot victor at the Democratic convention and he still could
secure or at least influence the nomination.
   ``Some people would like to turn back the clock, to go back to
the days when the voters didn't really pick their nominee,'' says
the announcer in the Dukakis commercial. ``They say you must turn
over that power to them at a brokered convention. But you don't
have to do this. On Tuesday, you can pick the next president...''
   Gore was running a mix of three advertisements in Illinois, all
of them positive messages. One especially made for Illinois says
Gore won six states on Super Tuesday by taking his case to the
people, and asks Illinois voters for their support.
   The other two ads, used throughout the South for Super Tuesday,
have a populist thrust. One chides American companies for investing
in jobs overseas rather than at home and the other says big
chemical polluters, price fixers, corporate law breakers, greedy
drug manufacturers ``don't want Al Gore to be president'' because
he's fought them in the past.
   Gephardt made a poor Super Tuesday showing and was skipping
Illinois to concentrate on Michigan, which holds caucuses March 26.
Gephardt had used ads critical of Dukakis and Gore in the Super
Tuesday states and both candidates came back with on-air ``attack
ads'' to which Gephardt couldn't afford to respond.

   Riot police used tear gas today to
disperse about 600 teachers demanding their salaries and yelling
``Noriega must go.''
   Strikes and disturbances broke out when some workers demanded
cash instead of the bags of food the government today began
distributing to public employees until it has the money for
salaries.
   For the first time, the disturbances reached into the central
business district.
   Police, armed with rubber truncheons and tear gas grenades,
forcibly removed the teachers, who were blocking traffic in front
of the Ministry of Education. The teachers shouted, `We want out
pay,'' ``Books yes, arms no,'' and ``Justice.''
   The nation's military strongman, Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega,
its new civilian chief executive, Manuel Solis Palma, and other top
government officials ended an emergency meeting at 2 a.m. today.
There was no immediate comment on what action, if any, they took to
overcome U.S. economic sanctions aimed at bringing down the
military regime.
   The government has said it does not have enough money to meet
this week's public payroll of $33 million for its 130,000 public
employees.
   Horacio Rodriguez, director of the Ministry of Farm and Dairy
Products Marketing, said his agency had prepared 12,000 of the bags
of food for distribution this week.
   They contained basic staples of the Panamanian diet such as
rice, beans, flour, potatoes, fresh vegetables and beef.
   The ``dignity bags'' were being sold by the government for
between $15 and $16 each. It was believed that officials were not
demanding cash, and it was not clear how the workers were paying
for the supplies.
   In another development, men in civilian clothes fired guns
outside a church service in Panama City on Sunday and attacked a TV
cameraman after roughing up a woman who was selling an
anti-government newsletter. No one was injured.
   The attack came at the Roman Catholic Church of Christ the King,
long a center of government opposition activity, as its pastor, the
Rev. Xavier Villanueva, was beginning a late-morning Mass.
   Solis Palma, installed by the ruling military last month as
minister in charge of the presidency, has been meeting with his
chief advisors almost constantly since last Thursday. Sunday's
meeting was the first time that Noriega had been known to join them.
   Meanwhile, Noriega was said by a chief aide to be ``in excellent
spirits, working very hard, always on the phone and maintaining his
determination not to surrender.''
   Maj. Edgardo Lopez, the general's press officer, said Noriega
was telephoning other countries in search of financial assistance
and received ``some very positive answers from some friendly
governments.''
   Lopez declined to elaborate, but he added, ``this is a very
complex situation that cannot be solved in 72 hours.''
   Noriega is under indictment in the United States on federal drug
trafficking and money laundering charges.
   Almost one in every five workers in this nation of 2.5 million
people is employed by the government. While Noriega's popularity
has fallen recently, he has so far enjoyed at least the outward
support of government employees.
   In Washington, administration officials acknowledged Sunday that
the economic sanctions imposed by President Reagan on Friday were
intended to make it harder for the Panamanian government to pay the
public employees.
   The timing of the sanctions ``was not a coincidence,'' said one
administration source, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Reagan ordered the withholding of $6.5 million in monthly Panama
Canal fees due Panama this week and eliminated a trade preference
the country has enjoyed under the Caribbean Basin Initiative.
   Earlier, the United States suspended all economic and military
aid to Panama and suppported legal efforts to freeze an estimated
$50 million in official Panamanian funds held in American banks.
   The legal action was taken by attorneys for Eric Arturo
Delvalle, who was deposed as Panama's president on Feb. 26 in a
coup engineered by Noriega. Although Delvalle has been in hiding
ever since, he still is recognized by the United States as Panama's
legitimate president.
   The government ordered Panama's 118 local and foreign banks
closed temporarily on March 3, saying it could not provide them
with enough money to cover withdrawals. There was no word Sunday of
when the banks would reopen.
   Their closure has left the country in economic chaos, with
businessmen and individuals unable to cash checks and hoarding
precious dollars, which Panama uses as its currency.
   In the attack outside the church on Sunday, an Associated Press
reporter and photographer said between 8 and 10 men dressed in
civilian clothes fired handguns in the air and smashed the windows
of automobiles parked outside the Church of Christ the King.
   No one was hurt in the shooting, but two of the gunmen struck an
Italian television cameraman and stole his video camera as he was
filming the incident. The men threw rocks at other reporters on the
scene.

<HEAD>Government Splits As Thatcher Lets The Pound Go Free</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MAUREEN JOHNSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Conservative government has split over how to
handle the surging pound in a dispute that has overshadowed
Tuesday's budget and its expected tax bonanzas for the wealthy.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's willingness to let the pound
soar unchecked has thrown in doubt the future of her top Treasury
official, Nigel Lawson.
   The chancellor of the exchequer is so angry at Mrs. Thatcher
overruling his policy of keeping sterling in line with the West
German mark that he may make Tuesday's annual budget announcement
his last, published reports have said.
   Lawson is ranked among Britain's most able Treasury officials
since World War II.
   ``The stark fact is that the prime minister and the chancellor
are in open conflict over a crucial part of our economic policy,''
said John Smith, finance spokesman for the main opposition Labor
Party.
   Government officials, speaking on condition of anonymity,
acknowledged the split which one described as a ``healthy
argument.''
   The pound, meanwhile, continued a week-long surge, topping $1.86
in trading on Monday, an eight-cent jump from a week ago.
   The government split was revealed in Parliament last week when
Mrs. Thatcher rejected Bank of England intervention such as selling
pounds or reducing interest rates to make sterling less attractive
to foreign investors.
   Mrs. Thatcher believes that lower interest rates will encourage
borrowing and fuel inflation, now at a low 3.3 percent.
   Curbing inflation has been a cornerstone of her tight-fisted
economic policies since she won power in 1979.
   Lawson's strategy has been to keep sterling at around 3 marks.
Sterling traded Monday at 3.08 marks.
   Britain is not a member of the exchange mechanism of the
European Monetary System, which links eight other major European
currencies, including the mark, in a stabilizing arrangement.
   Bill Martin, chief economist at stockbrokers Phillips and Drew,
said that Mrs. Thatcher's stance has aggravated the problems caused
by a high pound, which makes British exports more expensive.
   ``There is virtually no ceiling to the exchange rate at the
present time,'' Martin said in a television interview Sunday. ``All
round, our international trade performance is likely to suffer.''
   Britain's trade deficit, which soared by one-third to a record
$2.8 billion in January, was worsening before the latest upsurge in
sterling.
   ``Lawson Mustn't Go,'' the respected financial weekly, The
Economist, said in a headline over an article which added, ``The
main reason is that Mr. Lawson is good at his job.''
   Mrs. Thatcher, accused by some critics of being increasingly
authoritarian since she won a third term last June, is also at
loggerheads with another senior member of her Cabinet, Education
Secretary Kenneth Baker.
   A leaked government document last week confirmed reports that
she has told Baker to rethink part of a planned overhaul of the
state school and examination system.
   Lawson, 56, an economist and former financial journalist
appointed chancellor in 1983, was expected to unveil Tuesday
Britain's first surplus budget for nearly 20 years.
   Rank-and-file Conservatives grumbled that the argument over the
pound had clouded what many of them predicted would be a budget
marking a high point of an economic strategy of restraining state
spending.
   ``It would be much happier if this particular dispute had been
kept private and, above all, kept private until after the budget
was over and done with,'' said John Biffen, a former Leader of the
Commons who was dropped from the Cabinet last year.
   Higher-than-expected government revenues, boosted by tax
receipts from higher wages and sales of state-owned assets, meant
that Lawson was expected to have a surplus of more than $5.5
billion on the $290 billion budget for the fiscal year ending March
31, 1989.
   Lawson was expected to slash the top income tax rate _ payable
on incomes over $76,200 a year _ from 60 percent to 50 percent or
even lower.
   The basic tax rate _ at 33 percent when Mrs. Thatcher won power
in 1979 _ was expected to drop from the current 27 percent to 25
percent.

   Israel and Hungary restored low-level
diplomatic ties Monday after a 20 year hiatus but a Hungarian
official said full ties await resolution of the Arab-Israeli
conflict.
   An Israeli interest section office was opened in the Swiss
Consulate in Budapest, and a Hungarian interest section was opened
in the Swedish Consulate in Tel Aviv.
   In Budapest, Foreign Minister Peter Varkonyi received Shlomo
Marom, the head of the Israeli office. Swiss Ambassador Paul Wipfli
was also present.
   Twenty years ago all Soviet bloc countries except Romania
severed ties with Israel to protest its occupation of Jordan and
Egyptian land in the 1967 Middle East war.
   In October, Poland became the first East bloc country to renew
low-level ties. The Soviet Union also re-established direct
diplomatic contacts with Israel and sent a consular delegation to
Israel in July.
   Hungarian Foreign Ministry representative Jeno Jyenis told
Israel radio that ``the restoration of full diplomatic ties between
Israel and Hungary depends on a resolution of the conflict between
Israel and the Palestinians.''
   In 1986, trade between the two countries equaled $22 million,
according to Israeli figures.
   Hungary sells Israel jam and furniture, while Israel exports
light bulbs and phosphate to Hungary.
   Israeli figures indicate that about 15,000 Israeli tourists
visited Hungary last year, while about 2,000 Hungarians visited
Israel.

   Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr. and Frank
Sinatra start spreadin' the news in Canada on Tuesday after
dazzling ``rat pack'' fans here at the start of their 29-city
reunion tour.
   The three veteran showmen joked and sang with the same
easy-going, cocktail lounge manner that has kept them in superstar
ranks for decades as they performed the first of 40 shows in the
Oakland Coliseum on Sunday night.
   Sinatra, 72, Davis, 62, and Dean Martin, 70, were as much adored
as applauded by the 14,500 fans from teen-agers to people in their
80s. The show sold out an hour after tickets became available weeks
ago, and scalpers were getting as much as $300 for a $40 seat.
   Martin opened the show, staggering and swaggering onto the stage
with his trademark cigarette and cocktail in hand. After slurring
his way through, ``That's Amore,'' ``Everybody Loves Somebody
(Sometime),'' and a string of one liners, he yielded to Davis.
   The ``Candy Man'' proved he still can, rousing the crowd with
``What Kind of Fool Am I?,'' ``Bojangles,'' and ``I've Got To Be
Me.'' He also was cheered when he announced he gave up drinking
three years ago.
   ``I've got to tell you the truth. Everybody backstage is being
very cool, but I wasn't this scared when I lived at 147th Street
and Eighth Avenue in New York,'' he confessed.
   But it was Sinatra _ Old Blue Eyes, The Man, The Voice, The
Chairman of The Board _ that most fans had come to see, and they
weren't disappointed as he powered his way through hit after hit:
``What Now My Love,'' ``For Once In My Life,'' ``Mack The Knife,''
and the song he called the national anthem, ``New York, New York.''
   The trio then performed a medley of songs together, as women and
at least one man dropped flowers on the stage.
   ``We bought tickets for ourselves because we knew we'll never
see it again,'' said Dan Chaix of Alameda, a 30-year-old fan who
was considering flying his parents to another city so they could
catch the show. ``I saw Frank 15 years ago in Vegas and he's better
than he's ever been,'' said Chaix' wife, Karen.
   ``I thought they looked great. For me, it was a once in a
lifetime thing,'' said Maureen Pobuta, 33, of San Mateo. Said
Bernice Hourcade: ``I'd have died if I hadn't come tonight.''
   After Tuesday night's show in Vancouver, British Columbia, the
``Together Again'' tour moves to Seattle on Wednesday, then to
Chicago for two weekend shows. The tour is scheduled through
October, with performances across the country. Other dates are to
be announced in Southern California.

   Gov. Evan Mecham's lawyer sought a
mistrial today as the governor's Senate impeachment trial entered
its third week, alleging that the state police have been
intimidating witnesses and have made the trial ``fundamentally
unfair.''
   Defense lawyer Fred Craft said that if the mistrial is not
granted, his motion sought dismissal of the charge that Mecham
tried to obstruct an investigation of an alleged death threat.
   ``Overt or subtle intimidation of witnesses who are to be called
to testify in a proceeding is outrageous,'' the motion said. ``The
conduct on the part of the Department of Public Safety is so
egregious that it renders this trial fundamentally unfair.''
   The DPS has denied attempting to intimidate witnesses, including
Terri Fields, who was arrested Friday, a day after she testified on
Mecham's behalf. She was arrested on a warrant that had been
outstanding since January.
   Mecham is accused of ordering DPS Director Ralph Milstead not to
cooperate with an investigation of an alleged death threat by Lee
Watkins, former head of state prison construction, against former
top Mecham aide Donna Carlson.
   At the time of the alleged threat on Nov. 12, she was about to
testify before a grand jury investigating an unreported $350,00
campaign loan to Mecham. Watkins has denied Ms. Carlson's
allegations.
   The trial's presiding officer, Frank X. Gordon Jr., said the
motion would be heard by the Senate Tuesday morning.
   Craft's motion cited Ms. Fields' arrest on a warrant for
allegedly failing to attend an Alcoholic Anonymous meeting
following a driving-while-intoxicated conviction. The motion also
mentioned published reports of a warrant for the arrest of another
prospective witness, Christina Johnston. The Johnston warrant, for
allegedly impersonating a state official while repossessing a
vehicle, was never served.
   And, the motion said another defense witness, security expert
Antonio Corio, changed his planned testimony on possible bugs in
the governor's office after being seen getting out of Milstead's
car.

<TEXT>
   outside the Senate building, chanting slogans about the trial and
Ms. Fields' arrest. The crowd cheered as Craft approached the
Senate building, and he raised his fists into the air.
   Meanwhile, testimony on the alleged threat continued today with
former top gubernatorial aide Max Hawkins on the stand.
   Hawkins testified that he was not attempting to protect Watkins
when he cooperated with Watkins' attorney in planning a
lie-detector test on whether a threat was made.
   Watkins' attorney, Dale Anderson, testified last week that the
conversation was taped so he and the polygrapher could have
Hawkins' exact language to use in preparing polygraph test
questions for Watkins.
   Craft said the governor is expected to be the last defense
witness and will take the stand late this week or early next week.
   On Friday, Hawkins testified that he considered the alleged
threat to be ``a little spat, frivolous matter,'' and that he told
Mecham to forget about it and that the matter would go away.
   Hawkins had talked with Watkins and Peggy Griffith, a state
official who testified that Watkins threatened Ms. Carlson's life
during a conversation with Mrs. Griffith.
   Hawkins testified Friday that Watkins had told him he had said
Ms. Carlson should keep her mouth shut about the $350,000 loan
because ``there are a lot of people out there who are excitable and
she could have harm come to her.''
   Months ago, Hawkins told reporters he thought Watkins' statement
was ``good advice'' for Ms. Carlson.
   Mecham told the House impeachment committee in January that he
may have told Milstead not to cooperate with the investigation, but
insisted he was not adequately informed of the seriousness of the
situation.
   Watkins resigned his prison construction position after a past
assault conviction was disclosed.
   On Friday, the DPS arrested Fields, Ms. Griffith's secretary who
had testified a day earlier that Ms. Griffith tended to exaggerate.
Ms. Fields testified that she thought there had been no death
threat.
   Ms. Fields was apprehended by DPS officers and Mesa police on a
Jan. 18 warrant for alleged failure to attend Alcoholics Anonymous
meetings. She had been arrested on a charge of driving while
intoxicated.
   The DPS said Friday's arrest came after one of its officers
notified his superiors that she was wanted. Craft termed the arrest
an intimidation tactic by Milstead, but DPS spokesman Sgt. Allan
Schmidt said Milstead's only involvement was that he was told by
officers that there was a warrant for her arrest.
   Mecham, a first-term Republican and perennial political outsider
who won the governorship on his fifth try, was impeached by the
House on Feb. 5. In addition to the death threat allegation, he is
accused of concealing the campaign loan and misusing $80,000 from
the governor's protocol fund by loaning it to his auto dealership.
   A two-thirds' vote of the 30-member Senate is required to
convict Mecham. Lawmakers also could decide to bar him from future
office.
   Some senators have said they want to seek a Senate vote on
whether to convict Mecham after completing testimony on the death
threat allegation. Others oppose the idea, saying they believe all
the evidence should be heard before the Senate votes.
   Mecham is the first U.S. governor to be impeached in six decades
and the first ever in Arizona.

<HEAD>Unlikely Coalition Could Kill Mississippi Constitution Reform
Effort</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Critics of Mississippi's 1890 constitution
say it is anti-black and anti-business, but an unlikely coalition
of blacks, business people and farmers may kill legislative efforts
to rewrite the document.
   Gov. Ray Mabus, who took office in January, said rewriting the
constitution ``would show that Mississippi is ready to take a step
into the next century.''
   ``My biggest argument is that the 1890 constitution is a
document that's, in a lot of ways, gotten us into dead solid last
place and that we really can't do any worse,'' said Mabus, who
incorporated the call for a new constitution into his successful
campaign last year.
   The state House and Senate have each passed a bill that would
allow voters to decide in a November referendum whether the
constitution would be rewritten in a convention. A conference
committee is working out differences in the two bills.
   When considering the House bill, the Senate deleted all
convention restrictions, including a requirement that the new
document include the right-to-work provision from the current
constitution.
   ``It's extremely important to industry and workers'' that a new
constitution include right-to-work, which forbids employers and
unions from signing contracts that would require employees to be
union members, said Jerry McBride of the Jackson-based Mississippi
Manufacturers Association.
   A right-to-work statute was enacted in 1956 and added to the
constitution in 1960.
   Farmers have expressed concern that a new constitution would
allow the Legislature too much latitude in raising taxes. Richard
Morgan of the Mississippi Farm Bureau Federation in Jackson said he
believes a current constitutional property classification provision
that allows a lower tax rate for farm land ``would be overlooked.''
   Senators also deleted a provision for the governor to appoint 20
delegates in addition to those who would be elected from each of
the 122 House districts.
   Blacks, who represent better than 30 percent of the state's
voters, have said they would oppose a convention without the
gubernatorial appointments because they fear they would not be
proportionately represented in delegate voting.
   Mabus has said that if he is allowed to appoint delegates, he
will geographically and racially balance the convention.
   Black legislators have said they fear a convention might reduce
the size of the Legislature and make it more difficult for blacks
to get elected, allow the state College Board authority to close
any of the state's eight institutions of higher learning, and cut
the number of locally elected public officials.
   The College Board recommended in 1985 closing Mississippi Valley
State University, one of Mississippi's three predominantly black
universities, but legislators rejected the propsal.
   Mississippi has the highest number of black elected officials in
the nation. The House has 20 black members, and two blacks serve in
the 52-member Senate.
   Black lawmakers said that while the original document may have
been anti-black, they do not fear it now.
   ``The federal courts have removed many of the racist
provisions,'' said state Rep. Hillman Frazier, who is black.
   Leslie McLemore, a political scientist and dean of the graduate
school at predominantly black Jackson State University, said he
believes the current method of changing the constitution by
amendment is a ``piecemeal way of overhauling a document that
really needs to be rewritten.''
   McLemore said if a convention is called, it will be ``extremely
important that black people go out and vote.''
   University of Mississippi history professor David Sansing is
among those who favor rewriting the document. He said the old
charter not only disenfranchised blacks, but poor whites as well
with its poll tax and literacy requirement, although those
provisions have been struck down by federal courts.
   ``That old constitution is inherently evil, so we can't modify
it with amendments,'' said Meridian car dealer and developer Gil
Carmichael, who made rewriting the constitution the hallmark of
unsuccessful campaigns for governor in 1975 and 1979 and for
lieutenant govenor in 1983.

<HEAD>IRS Endorses Review of Tax Penalties Which Critics Say Hurt Poor</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Internal Revenue Service pledged support
Monday to a review of tax penalties that were assessed last year in
some 27 million cases _ penalties that have been criticized as a
special burden on the poor.
   At the opening of a public inquiry into the maze of 154
penalties the IRS can impose, IRS Commissioner Lawrence B. Gibbs
expressed the agency's own concern about the penalties, many of
which were enacted by Congress over the past seven years in an
effort to increase compliance with the tax laws.
   ``A penalty system that operates based on the wrong principles
may provide appropriate sanctions for some types of behavior and
yet have an overall negative impact on taxpayer behavior because it
is not perceived as fair,'' Gibbs said.
   Several witnesses at Monday's hearing accused the government of
using penalties to raise revenues, rather than to assure compliance
with the laws.
   Sen. David Pryor, D-Ark., chairman of a Senate Finance
subcommittee that oversees the IRS, cited the case of one business
that underpaid employment taxes by 2 cents and was hit with a
penalty of $400.29.
   ``We've created some sort of a monster here,'' Pryor said.
``We're going to change that some way.''
   Gibbs and O. Donaldson Chapoton, assistant secretary of the
treasury for tax policy, endorsed a thorough review of tax
penalties. A review also was endorsed by the Chamber of Commerce,
the National Association of Manufacturers and associations
representing lawyers, accountants and other tax professionals.
   ``We certainly hope there's not any reaction ... by IRS agents
in the field ... that penalties should be used as means of raising
revenue,'' Chapoton said.
   The University of Akron Center for Taxation Studies said that
when one penalty is stacked atop another, it indicates a goal of
raising revenue.
   A major problem with penalties, said James W. Childs, director
of the university's tax clinic program, is that Congress has not
given the IRS sufficient guidance on how penalties should be
applied. As a result, he said, penalties often are applied to
taxpayers who have neither the funds to hire a lawyer or accountant
nor knowledge of how the system works.
   ``The low-income taxpayer has about as much knowledge of how to
obtain abatement of a penalty through problems resolution (the IRS'
``consumer advocate'') as he-she does of getting to the moon,''
said Childs. ``Abuses by high-income taxpayers have brought about a
plethora of new penalties. Unfortunately, the low-income taxpayer
has been caught in this net.''
   An even more basic problem, Childs said, is the difficulty in
reading IRS tax forms in general. He cited a finding that
instructions for Form 1040EZ _ the simplest tax form _ require an
8.45 grade reading level, compared to a 7.1 level to read the Wall
Street Journal.
   Penalties in the tax law range from $1 for failing to file a
statement on payment of dividends totaling less than $10 to a
maximum of 25 percent of the tax owed for failing to pay on time to
$10,000 for abetting a corporation in the understatement of its tax
liability. In 1987, the IRS assessed 27 million penalties totaling
$14 billion and excused another 4 million for $4 billion.
   Pryor criticized IRS for the way it applies penalties against
taxpayers who file what the IRS considers frivolous returns.
Congress created the penalty, which can be as much as $500, to
discourage taxpayers from using arguments such as
self-incrimination to avoid a proper tax return.
   Pryor said he has evidence the IRS is imposing the penalty
against those who write critical notes to the agency on their
returns, even though the returns are completed and signed. He cited
the much-publicized case of a Montana woman who was hit with a
penalty for such behavior and whose husband's life insurance policy
was seized before a federal judge intervened.
   ``If that little old lady lived in Arkansas or New Jersey, would
she get the same penalty?'' Pryor asked Gibbs. ``Who makes those
decisions?''
   Gibbs promised to check into the Montana case but Pryor quickly
cautioned against it. ``I don't think she wants you to review her
case and flag her return,'' the senator said.

   Five or six bandits opened fire on the armored truck from behind

   There were no reports of injuries to guards or robbers.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate voted 83-0 Monday to approve a
31-nation treaty curbing emissions of chemicals that destroy the
high-altitude layer of ozone which makes life on Earth possible.
   The treaty calls for a 20 percent reduction from 1986 emissions
of the most active chlorofluorocarbon compounds, called CFCs, to
take effect in 1993. There would be an additional 30 percent cut in
mid-1998.
   Participating countries also pledged to impose trade
restrictions on products containing CFC compounds from countries
not signing the treaty.
   Major producing nations and the European Common Market agreed to
the cuts last September in Montreal under prodding from the United
States, Canada and the Scandinavian nations _ countries that banned
use of CFC compounds in aerosol sprays in 1978. The United States
had sought a 95 percent reduction.
   European countries before that had argued that a ban on new
production capacity would be sufficient to protect ozone. The
Soviet Union, a major producer, won special provisions permitting
that country to use the output of plants under construction and
exceed the emissions limits temporarily. The Soviets signed the
treaty in December.
   The Soviet exemptions, and similar provisions for developing
nations, have led the Environmental Defense Fund to conclude that
the actual emissions reduction in 1998 could be only 35 percent
instead of 50 percent.
   Backers of the treaty hope it will serve as a model for
international agreement to control the ``greenhouse effect,'' the
expected warming of the Earth caused by the growing concentration
of several gases in the atmosphere, notably carbon dioxide from
fossil fuel combustion.
   CFC compounds, first formed in 1929, are widely used in
refrigeration, production of plastic foams and as solvents to clean
computer equipment.
   The compounds may last 100 years in the atmosphere, eventually
rising to the ozone layer, 15 miles to 25 miles above the Earth's
surface.
   The Environmental Protection Agency has estimated that a 1
percent shrinkage of the Earth's ozone layer will increase skin
cancer by 5 percent or 6 percent.
   Whether the ozone layer is shrinking is hard to determine
because ozone normally fluctuates every year, with sunspots and
volcanic eruptions influencing how much is formed. The National
Aeronautics and Space Administration is scheduled to report Tuesday
on whether the ozone layer is getting thinner.
   NASA researchers have said there might have been a decline of
about 0.5 percent per year recently _ but that estimate was
uncertain, and was being debated in a review group of 100
scientists from around the world.
   The treaty will not come into force until at least 11 countries,
representing two-thirds of the world's production capacity for CFC
compounds, have ratified it. The United States will become the
second country, behind Mexico, to ratify.

<HEAD>Rights Group Rips Philippines Military For Civilian Atrocities</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The military is killing and
terrorizing civilians under the pretense of fighting communism, and
the campaign has gone unchecked by the government, a human rights
group charged Monday.
   Task Force-Detainees, a group formed by the Roman Catholic
Church to monitor rights violations under ousted President
Ferdinand Marcos, charged that the military began its spree two
months ago in northeastern Aurora province.
   It called for an investigation and claimed that atrocities
included the Feb. 11 slaying of Roberto Rivares, a leftist
provincial leader who helped organize the group's probe.
   At a news conference, the group introduced a 6-year-old boy who
said he was the only member of his family to survive a Jan. 23
massacre. Five others died.
   ``I saw soldiers shoot my father and mother, after which they
turned to me and shot me in both legs,'' said Ronaldo Guzman, his
legs in casts.
   The rights group also claimed more than 1,000 people had fled
their homes in the town of Dinalungan, about 120 miles northeast of
Manila, to escape military operations.
   It said the violence was being waged under the guise of battling
the 19-year-old communist insurgency in the Philippines.
   ``In the past, during Marcos' time, we had military in the towns
in the north but there was not this kind of strafing, massacre and
burning of houses,'' said Bishop Julio Xavier Labayen. ``We're
sitting on a powder keg.''
   In a statement, the group said: ``Task Force-Detainees hopes
that President (Corazon) Aquino will not simply dismiss this
violation as yet another `total lie' but instead will treat the
matter with grave concern.''
   Mrs. Aquino became president in 1986 after Marcos was toppled
from power.
   Bienvenido Amora, chief investigator for the government's Human
Rights Commission, said he would contact the group about the
charges.
   ``We would have appreciated it very much if the Task
Force-Detainees had brought this matter to the attention of the
Commission on Human Rights so that the (commission) could proceed
to investigate this case accordingly,'' he said.
   Last week, the Task Force said its investigation showed 7,444
Filipino civilians were arrested illegally last year, eclipsing the
5,967 arrests in 1985 under Marcos. Spokesman Noel Salazar said 672
of those detained in 1987 were tortured.
   The same day, Amnesty International claimed similar atrocities
in a report released in London.
   Mrs. Aquino branded the Amnesty report ``one-sided'' and charged
it had relied on Task Force-Detainees for its information. She
challenged both groups to provide evidence.

   A 31-year-old pacifist on Monday entered
the fourth week of a hunger strike to try to win an alternative to
compulsory military service.
   In October, a military court sentenced Michael Marangakis to
four years in prison on insubordination charges. On Feb. 22, an
appeals court reduced his sentence to 26 months.
   The 6-foot 5-inch woodcarver, who weighed 222 pounds, started
his hunger strike the next day. He said he has lost 22 pounds since
then and will take only fruit juice and milk every other day until
the Greek government establishes conscientious objection to
military service.
   ``I won't eat until the government recognizes the right of the
individual to act on the basis of conscience,'' Marangakis said in
an interview at Avlon military prison 29 miles north of Athens.
   Military service is compulsory in Greece, where it averages
about 21 months. Unlike some other European countries, Greece
offers no option to compulsory service, and objectors are routinely
given long prison terms.
   Legal experts say there are about 300 Greeks imprisoned for
refusing to serve in the military. Almost all are Jehovah's
Witnesses.
   Marangakis belongs to one of the ancient Eastern Orthodox
churches but says his pacifism is derived mainly from personal
ideals rather than his religion.
   Stelios Nestos, one of Marangakis' three attorneys, said that 11
other conscientious objectors had recently gone into hiding after
they were called up. But Marangakis presented himself to a military
camp in Drama, in northern Greece, where he was called up in March
1987.
   Marangakis said he was planning to appeal his sentence to
Greece's Supreme Court.
   A new law under debate in the Greek parliament seeks to abolish
prison terms for conscientious objectors but doesn't provide for
alternative service. Instead, conscientious objectors will be
required to serve double time in the armed forces as non-combatants.
   But Marangakis said he would refuse to serve as a non-combatant
because it represents a form of military service.

   A year after he stepped down from his PTL
television ministry because of a sex scandal, Jim Bakker returned
to the pulpit at a trailer park in California.
   Tammy Faye Bakker introduced her husband to 225 suntanned
retirees at a service Sunday in Niland, Calif., according to a
report in Monday's Charlotte Observer.
   ``This has been a long, hard year for us,'' Mrs. Bakker said.
``I am very happy to introduce to you my husband. I would like to
welcome him back to the place where he belongs, in the pulpit,
ministering the Gospel of Jesus Christ.''
   Bakker, who resigned after admitting having a sexual encounter
with church secretary Jessica Hahn, preached about friendship for
30 minutes, then grinned and hugged members of the congregation.
   ``I've always said over the years if I could give you a gift,
the most important gift would be a good friend,'' Bakker said.
   Bakker's uncle Charles ``Lonnie'' Irwin is pastor of the park's
Lutheran congregation during the winter.

   The Tunnel of Love Express Tour stops in Tacoma on May 5 and 6,
Columbia Records announced Sunday.
   During his last appearance here in October 1984, one of his two

from a virus. However, Rolling Stone magazine later reported that
The Boss and other members of the tour became sick because of
Tacoma's legendary stink.
   John Morrison, promoter of the 1984 concert, said Springsteen

   Tony Aliengena's solo adventure in an
ultralight plane was a high for him, but aviation officials aren't
sure whether the 9-year-old boy became the youngest pilot to solo.
   The San Juan Capistrano boy piloted the Quicksilver GT
Ultralight airplane for 3{ minutes Sunday in calm, sunny weather at
Oceanside Municipal Airport.
   ``It was smooth throughout,'' Tony said.
   Don Taylor, who observed the flight as a representative of the
National Aeronautics Association, conceded it was a solo flight but
couldn't say how it might be classified by the NAA, which certifies
aviation records.
   The NAA typically notes ultralight records for speed, distance
and time, Taylor said, but it might create a new category or just
``recognize'' Tony's flight.
   The Guinness Book of World Records lists the youngest solo pilot
as Cody A. Locke, who flew a Cessna 150 near Mexical, Mexico, in
1983 at 9 years, 316 days. On Sunday, Tony was 9 years and 295 days
old.
   On March 30, Tony and an instructor will take off for Boston in
a Cessna 210, in an effort to become the youngest pilot to fly
across the United States.

   For his role as an executive trapped in his
11-year-old son's body in the new release ``Vice Versa,'' boyish
actor Judge Reinhold asked for help from a ``Beverly Hills Cop II''
co-star.
   Reinhold studied the speech of 11-year-old Fred Savage.
   ``I had Fred tape record all my lines, so I could go home and
listen to all his inflections and stuff. The kid that I play is in
such an incredibly new situation,'' the 30-year-old actor said.
   ``Some people say that I just kind of walk through it,
gawking,'' he said of his role in the movie, which was the nation's
No. 2 box-office draw in its debut last weekend. ``But my feeling
was that the kid was in this state of wonder about the situation he
was in, you know?''
   Reinhold said he and Fred ``hung out a lot.''
   ``The neat thing about him is that he's incredibly bright but
he's still a kid,'' Reinhold said.

   Bob Dumas celebrated his 73rd birthday by
playing that many tennis games to prove a point.
   ``Why does Jack LaLane pull a boat through the San Francisco
Channel on his birthday? We want to show people that we're proud of
the fact that we take care of our bodies,'' Dumas said Sunday after
he finished his 73rd game at Pleasant View Orchard Park.
   ``The important thing is that when you get old, you're healthy.
When you read about all these people in the obituaries that say
they lived to 80, 85, they're just living out their heartbeats,
just existing. ... Old age is a privilege that's not granted to
everybody.''
   Dumas, who teaches tennis and is a spokesman for Holiday Health
Clubs, has celebrated his birthday the same way for three years. He
said he plays tennis at least once a week most of the year and
every day in the summer.
   Asked how he keeps going for 73 games, Dumas said, ``I drink
Gatorade and eat granola.''

<HEAD>Botha Says Main Issue in Angola is Timetable for Cuban Withdrawal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRENDA WATSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   South Africa's foreign minister said Monday that
Angola has not presentated a plan for withdrawal of the estimated
40,000 Cuban troops in that country and a timetable remains a
central issue for regional peace.
   Roelof F. Botha was asked at a news conference about an
announcement Sunday by Angola that it and Cuba had given U.S.
officials proposals for a southern Africa peace accord including a
timetable for Cuban troop withdrawal. He replied: ``That is not
correct.''
   In Washington, State Department spokesman Charles Redman said
Monday the Angolan proposal ``appears to break no new ground'' on
the issue of Cuba's military presence in Angola.
   Botha said the withdrawal timetable, along with who would
supervise the pullout, ``is the issue that must be taken up.''
   He spoke to reporters after a day of talks with Chester A.
Crocker, the U.S. assistant secretary of state who specializes in
southern Africa, aimed at advancing plans for peace in the region.
   Botha said they had ``extensive'' discussions of the situation
in southern Africa and ``the question of Cuban withdrawal as a
prerequisite for implementing a settlement in South-West
Africa-Namibia. We discussed extensively the possibilities that
exist in this respect.''
   ``I've received interesting information,'' he added, and
described the talks as ``useful'' but would not give details. Botha
said he and Crocker might meet again Tuesday, but that nothing was
set.
   Since 1981, Crocker has tried to negotiate a withdrawal of Cuban
troops from Angola in return for an end to South African control
over neighboring South-West Africa, also known as Namibia. His last
meeting with Botha was two years ago.
   Cuban troops help Angola's Marxist government fight the National
Union for the Total Independence of Angola, or UNITA, a guerrilla
force backed by South Africa and the United States.
   In January, Cuba declared a willingness in principle to leave
Angola but no deal has been negotiated.
   On Sunday, UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi said South Africa had told
him it would begin direct talks with Angola on the Angolan civil
war, which began with independence from Portugal in 1975.
   Asked about this at the news conference, Botha responded: ``I
have said that I have no problem in talking directly with Luanda
(the Angolan capital) and to a large number of other African
states.''
   He denied reports that preliminary talks for such negotiations
had been held. ``It's not necessary,'' he said. ``I could pick up a
telephone and talk now.''
   Kundi Payama, No. 2 man in Luanda, repeated that Angola was
prepared to negotiate directly with South Africa but also said
previous direct talks on other matters had not produced results.
   ``I think we can negotiate with the South Africans at any time
as long as they deal honestly with us,'' he said, ``but not if (the
talks) turn out to be just a tactic for gaining time.''

<HEAD>Pentagon Chief To Ask About Possible Reduction In Soviet Forces</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci was to ask
his Soviet counterpart at talks beginning Tuesday in Switzerland
whether highly publicized changes in Kremlin military doctrine mean
reductions in Soviet forces.
   Carlucci, meeting Tuesday through Thursday with Soviet Defense
Minister Dmitri Yazov, will also discuss arms control, human
rights, the proposed Soviet withdrawl from Afghanistan, and such
dangerous military situations as a collision between U.S. and
Soviet warships in the Black Sea last month, a senior Pentagon
official told reporters Monday.
   Carlucci has said he doesn't want the meeting to pre-empt talks
on reducing nuclear and conventional forces, but he does want to
ask Yazov about the emerging Soviet doctrine of ``reasonable
sufficiency.''
   ``We would like to get an idea of where they are going,'' said
the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   ``We will be asking them if this (new doctrine) is ... truly a
change in their policy and not just a public recitation,'' said the
official. ``What changes in Soviet equipment will we see? Will
there be a shift in force structure?''
   ``Over the years, we have seen quite a disparity (between) their
nuclear doctrine and what force structure they have actually
acquired,'' said the official.
   As early as 1977, then-Soviet leader Leonid I. Breznev
proclaimed that nuclear war was unwinnable. But the Soviets
continued to bolster their nuclear arsenal, adding mobile
long-range missiles that U.S. officials say could dodge a U.S.
strike. Such a capability, they say, appears contrary to the
doctrine of Mutual Assured Destruction, implied by Soviet
statements that nuclear war is unwinnable and insane.
   As far as the new doctrine of reasonable sufficiency is
concerned, said the Pentagon official, ``we don't see any physical
indication'' of change. ``That's why we want to ask them where to
look.''
   At the top of the American agenda, said the official, will be
so-called ``dangerous incidents,'' such as the bumping incident in
the Black Sea on Feb. 12, as well as the slaying of a U.S. Army
officer in East Germany in 1987 and the wounding of another last
September.
   Soviet spokesman Gennadi Gerasimov blamed the collision on two
U.S. warships which passed within 12 miles of the Soviet coast in
what American officials called an assertion of the right of
innocent passage from one body of international water to another.
   Unlike the United States, which claims a three-mile territorial
limit, the Soviet Union claims that its territory extends 12 miles
beyond its shores. U.S. officials recognize that limit but insist
on the right of ``innocent passage,'' in this case from one side of
the Crimean Peninsula to the other.
   Administration spokesmen said that two Soviet vessels rammed the
American ships.
   Whatever the Soviet objections to the presence of U.S. ships in
their waters, the Pentagon official said Monday, ``ramming ships
... is hardly a proportionate and proper action ... People could
get killed.''
   The Soviets have never apologized for fatally shooting U.S. Army
Maj. Arthur D. Nicholson in East Germany on March 24, 1985,
although they did apologize for wounding Army Master Sgt. Charles
L. Barry, shot in the arm by a Soviet soldier on Sept. 16, 1987.
   Carlucci hopes his meeting with Yazov will lead to guidelines to
prevent such dangerous incidents, including near-collisions between
U.S. and Soviet warplanes near one another's borders.
   ``Obviously, both sides use their aircraft to investigate
intruders and potential intruders,'' the senior Pentagon official
told reporters. ``But there are safe ways to do that.''
   ``Flying right in front of aircraft with erratic maneuvers,
close fly-bys that come within inches, are dangerous practices,''
said the official.
   Administration officials say that sometimes superpower
interceptors fly close enough to an intruder's wing that the
resulting air current forces the opposing aircraft away from the
border.
   A recent near-collision involved a long-range Navy surveillance
airplane, a P-3 Orion, and a Soviet Mig-23 Flogger over the Sea of
Japan on Jan. 11. The Soviet interceptor came within 15 feet of the
Orion, Pentagon officials said.
   Carlucci was scheduled to depart from Andrews Air Force Base
near Washington Monday evening, arrive in the Swiss capital of Bern
on Tuesday, dine with Yazov Tuesday night, meet him twice Wednesday
and once Thursday before returning to Washington later that day.

<HEAD>Sikh Militants Kill 15 In Punjab</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sikh extremists killed 21 people in
Punjab state, including a family of four, it was reported Monday.
   Police shot and killed Balraj Singh, a Sikh radical wanted for
several murders in Patiala on Monday, according to the state police
control center in Chandigarh.
   The deaths late Sunday and early Monday raised to at least 451
the number of killings blamed on Sikh radicals this year.
   Sikh militants have been fighting since 1982 for more autonomy
or an independent homeland for the sect in Punjab. The northern
state, the country's richest agricultural area, is the only one of
Hindu-dominated India where Sikhs have a majority.
   The United News of India reported that Sardul Singh, his wife
and two daughters were shot to death early Monday in Jhander, a
village in Amritsar District. The gunmen burned the family's house
to the ground before fleeing, it said.
   Responsibility was claimed by the Bhindranwale Tiger Force, one
of more than a dozen radical groups in Punjab. Police said a note
left at the scene said Singh, a Sikh, was being ``punished'' for
extortion and looting, but they gave no details.
   Eight other people were slain in Amritsar District, including
four Hindus in Dallin village, UNI said.
   A retired Sikh police constable identified as Gajjan Singh was
shot to death in Ludhiana District and two Hindu men were pulled
from a truck and shot down in Jalandhar District, the news agency
reported. Both districts are in central Punjab.
   A group of Sikh militants riding a jeep sprayed bullets at a bus
terminus in Hoshiarpur killing six people on the spot, police in
Chandigarh said. The identitities of the victims were not
immediately known.
   Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's government has been trying to stem
the violence since last May, when it removed the state
administration and put Punjab under federal rule.
   On March 4, Gandhi ordered five Sikh high priests released from
jail in an apparent effort to get them involved against terrorism.
He dissolved the Punjab Assembly two days later, paving the way for
militants to compete in anticipated elections.
   There have been no signs, however, that priests and other Sikh
leaders will move against the radicals.

   More than 25,000 people were taken into
police custody Monday as authorities moved to block a nationwide
strike to protest corruption and official incompetence, officials
said.
   Nine opposition parties, including the communists, have
scheduled the strike for Tuesday to protest government corruption,
failure to halt secterian violence and to demand better facilities
for farmers and farm laborers.
   Police in the southern state of Madras took 25,000 people into
custody to halt violence during the strike, a police officer in
state capital of Madras said.
   UNI reported that 500 people were arrested in the eastern Orissa
state.
   It said state governments across India deployed additional
security forces Monday to guard important installations and to
maintain law and order.
   Besides the two communist parties, the major sponsor of the
strike is the ``Jan Morcha'' or People's Front, an umbrella group
of disgruntled members of Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's govering
Congress party.
   The parties have accused the government of failure to contain
Sikh separatist violence in Punjab where 450 people were killed by
suspected Sikh radicals this year.
   Radical Sikhs want to seceede from the Indian union and turn the
state of Punjab into an independent Sikh nation.
   Opposition leaders have also accused Gandhi of shielding members
of his party from corruption inquiries involving foreign arms deals.

<TEXT>
   The government banned more than 800,000
cars and taxis from the downtown commercial district Monday to
combat the city's acrid, eye-stinging smog.
   Hundreds of policemen were stationed along three central
arteries that form a triangle around the city's main shopping zone,
blocking 45 streets.
   The ban is part of a campaign started in January to disperse a
thick brown cloud known as the ``Nefos'' that hangs over the city.
Scientists have blamed it on emissions from cars, diesel-powered
taxis and aging buses.
   The cloud forms over the mountain-ringed Athens basin when there
are sudden changes in temperature, and pollutants are trapped in a
still layer of air near the ground.
   Under the new rules, trucks will be allowed in the downtown
commercial district for four hours in the morning and 2{ hours in
the afternoon to resupply shops. The area's 100 permanent residents
were issued special permits for their vehicles.
   Police Lt. Panayiotis Stathatos, in charge of applying the
measures, said there was a total traffic ban on 14 streets and a
partial ban on 31 streets from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m.
   ``So far, we've had about a 60 percent success rate. A lot of
drivers still don't know what streets have been blocked to traffic,
so we are showing a little lenience to violators,'' he said.
   Drivers face an $85 fine for illegally entering the one
square-mile district near Constitution Square.
   Another measure already in force bans half the city's private
cars and half its 15,000 taxis from entering the 5-square-mile
inner city area on alternate days. Vehicles circulate there
according to the last digit on their license plates.
   As part of the pollution-cutting campaign, the government has
also abolished the traditional afternoon siesta in favor of a
continuous workday for stores and ordered strict checks on
industrial emissions.
   At least one group opposed Monday's ban. ``It's created a mess.
It was taken quickly, spasmodically and without sound planning,''
said Panaghis Stavrides, vice-president of the 1,600-member Athens
Trade Association.
   The latest traffic restrictions will last through May, when
their effects will be evaluated.

<HEAD>Reagan Says Star Wars Developing Faster Than Expected</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan contended on Monday that the
Star Wars anti-missile program has progressed more rapidly than
first thought and accused Congress of being ``irresponsible in the
extreme'' for cutting the budget of the futuristic defense plan.
   Marking the fifth anniversary of his announcement that the
United States would develop a space-based shield against nuclear
missiles, Reagan opened an administration drive to assure that Star
Wars, as the Strategic Defense Initiative is known, survives beyond
his presidency.
   Even though Reagan has sent his last budget to Congress, he
pledged in an address to a group of scientists and business
executives that SDI will continue its phased deployment.
   ``We will continue to research SDI, to develop and test it, and
as it becomes ready, we will deploy it,'' Reagan vowed.
   The president renewed charges that without Star Wars, the United
States will be at the mercy of an advanced Soviet space-weapons
program.
   ``A recent report by the Department of Defense called `The
Soviet Space Challege' warns that the Soviet space program points
in one disturbing direction ... the methodical pursuit of a
war-fighting capability in space,'' Reagan said.
   Because Congress has made cuts for the past four years in
administration SDI requests, ``We would be dangerously
unprepared,'' Reagan argued.
   Reagan lauded a recent round of SDI tests in which a Delta
rocket released a satellite, as well as dummy and decoy warheads,
into space. The satellite then tracked the objects, attempting to
tell the mock warheads from the decoys _ an essential task of any
anti-missile system. SDI is envisioned to be a combination of
ground- and space-based weapons using lasers and other exotic
technology.
   ``Some of the difficulties they said were insurmountable have
already been surmounted, much more rapidly and effectively than
anticipated,'' Reagan said, adding that the test ``showed a
technical ability that some scientists ... had said could not be
achieved so quickly.''
   Reagan contended that congressional curbs on administration SDI
budget requests have ``set the program back one to two years.''
   In the last fiscal year, the administration sought $5.7 billion
for Star Wars, but Congress allowed only $3.6 billion.
   Opponents of the program argue that it will cost untold billions
and add to the nation's burgeoning deficits. Others contend it is
technically unfeasible and will encourage the Soviets to abandon
arms control efforts and increase their offensive weapons in order
to defeat U.S. defensive systems.
   ``There's been a tendency by some in Congress to discuss SDI as
if its funding could be determined purely by domestic
considerations, unconnected to what the Soviets are doing,'' Reagan
said, ``That is, to put it plainly, irresponsible in the extreme.''
   The president argued that ``some in the U.S. Congress'' have
denied additional funds ``because they say SDI won't work. Well, it
won't if we don't develop it and test it.''
   ``Congress should realize that it is no longer a question of
whether there will be a SDI program or not. The only question will
be whether the Soviets are the only ones who have strategic
defenses while the United States remains entirely defenseless,''
Reagan said.
   Reagan's campaign comes as Congress has placed constraints on
SDI testing and expenditures, and as Soviet arms control
negotiators in Geneva attempt to crimp the U.S. effort amid
negotiations on a U.S.-Soviet treaty to slash strategic nuclear
weapon arsenals by half.
   Capitol Hill banned the use of federal funds for any SDI tests
that would violate a strict interpretation of the 1972
Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. But Pentagon officials, including
Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci, have said no such tests are
panned for the near future.
   The Soviet Union has argued that the ABM Treaty forbids
research, testing and development of an SDI system. The Reagan
administration has insisted on a ``broad'' interpretation of the
treaty that would permit expanded SDI tests and development.
   The U.S.-Soviet contest over Star Wars sparked the breakdown in
arms control negotiations between Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail
S. Gorbachev at their Iceland summit in 1986.
   At their last meeting in Washington, the two agreed to disagree
for a time on the issue, saying in a joint communique they would
observe the ABM Treaty ``as signed in 1972, while conducting their
research, development and testing as required.''

   Democratic presidential contender
Michael Dukakis made a final bid Monday to drain Illinois primary
support from favorite son Paul Simon, saying that a brokered
convention might bring disaster for their party in the fall.
   Sen. Simon, short on funds and far behind in the delegate chase,
has said he is on the ballot in Illinois because he wants to play a
role at a brokered Democratic National Convention next summer in
Atlanta.
   Citing published polls, Massachusetts Gov. Dukakis claimed
``significant gains'' in recent days in his bid to catch Simon and
a second favorite son in the race, Chicago civil rights activist
Jesse Jackson.
   But his aides sent conflicting signals about his likely finish
in Tuesday's election. Spokesman Mark Gearan said anything better
than third place was unlikely. But Mike Bakalis, Illinois campaign
chairman for Dukakis, said it was ``very possible'' the governor
might slip into second place behind Jackson, with Simon falling
into third.
   From the moment he began his campaign day with an early morning
commuter train ride in Chicago, Dukakis spoke out against a
brokered convention.
   At an airport news conference in Springfield, he suggested it
could damage Democratic prospects of winning the White House.
   He said that to finish the primary season in June and then have
Democrats ``spend seven or eight weeks negotiating, dealing, people
behind closed doors trying to decide who the nominee ought to be,
while Mr. Bush, if he is the Republican nominee, is kind of sitting
there, smiling at all of this, I think would be a disaster.''
   ``The last thing in the world we need is a brokered
convention,'' he said as he hopscotched across the state in his
chartered campaign jet.
   ``The last thing we need is six people in the back room at
Atlanta deciding who the nominee will be.''
   Dukakis never mentioned Simon by name, even avoiding a direct
answer when a reporter asked if a vote for the senator was a vote
for a brokered convention.
   Still, there was no doubt that the governor's criticism was
aimed at Simon.
   Dukakis is in third place in the Illinois polls, but some
surveys show front-runner Simon dropping with Jackson challenging
him for the lead and Dukakis moving up to a closer third-place
position.
   The same surveys indicate that Dukakis is drawing his
last-minute support from Simon's supporters. Dukakis' aides say
privately they would be delighted to see Jackson beat Simon,
believing it would drive the senator from the race.

<TEXT>
   Illinois Sen. Paul Simon said Monday he has no
plans for his Democratic presidential bid beyond his home state
primary, which he said ``I have to win and I will win.''
   ``A strong second isn't very strong,'' Simon said as he greeted
suburban commuters in the bitter cold at a downtown train station.
   Simon said if he finishes second in the popular vote or in the
selection of delegates, ``I'd have to re-evaluate.''
   ``I have no plans beyond tomorrow,'' said Simon, who was joined
by his wife, Jeanne. ``I have to win and I will win.''
   ``Jesse (Jackson) and I will be the No. 1 and No. 2 finishers
tomorrow, but the biggest competition is Mike Dukakis because of
the huge amount of money he is spending,'' Simon said.
   Simon acknowledged that his ``finances are not great,'' but
added, ``We have matching fund money that's coming in ... that will
take care of our bank loans.''
   He would not put a dollar figure on how much is left in campaign
coffers.
   In a speech later in the day before a labor group in Peoria,
Simon declined to explain his plans to re-evaluate in the event of
a home-state defeat.
   ``I'm not going to go down that path,'' he told a crowd of about
100 local labor leaders. ``We're gonna win this thing.''
   Simon insisted he is still a major force, despite having less
than a tenth of the delegates of each of the Democratic
front-runners.
   ``There are a lot of delegates yet to be chosen. At the
convention there should be five of us with blocks of delegates,''
said Simon, who is counting on a brokered convention.
   He said his blueprint for victory at a brokered convention is
winning Illinois, then collecting delegates in Michigan, Wisconsin,
New York and Ohio, and appealing to labor, educators and senior
citizens to put togther a coalition to win the nomination.
   ``It's going to be a wide-open convention,'' Simon told the
labor hall crowd, who interrupted his 15-minute speech several
times with applause.

   Two white students linked to an attack on
two black students have been banned from living on the University
of Massachusetts campus, a spokeswoman said Monday.
   Punishment was handed down late last week for three of the five
white students accused in the Feb. 7 attack of two black men who
accompanied a white woman to a party.
   The beatings kicked off a six-day takeover of a university
building last month by minority students.
   Two of the five students, whose names were withheld by the
university, had withdrawn from the university before disciplinary
hearings. Those two were evicted from their dormitory rooms by
officials Feb. 13 during a preliminary hearing.
   Of the remaining three students, two were found guilty of
violating the university's rules on assault and all three were
found to have violated the university's rules on drinking.
   All three were ordered to undergo an alcohol education program
and two were placed on disciplinary probation for the rest of this
school year and the 1988-89 school year, said school spokeswoman
Jeanne Hopkins.
   Lawyers for the students were out of their offices Monday and
could not be reached for comment. The students have until March 30
to appeal.
   Testimony in a show-cause hearing on whether criminal charges
should be filed against the five and a sixth man, who was not a
student, was to resume Tuesday.

<TEXT>
   Pornographic actor John Holmes, who made
hundreds of sexually explicit films during a career spanning two
decades, has died. He was 43 years old and reportedly had AIDS.
   Holmes, a leading sex film actor of the 1970s and early '80s,
died at 1 a.m. Sunday at the Veterans Administration Medical Center
in Sepulveda, said his manager, adult film producer William Amerson.
   The cause of death was not immediately known, Amerson said
Sunday. The Los Angeles Times, citing anonymous sources, reported
earlier this month that Holmes was gravely ill with acquired immune
deficiency syndrome.
   The hospital refused to immediately confirm the death.
   Holmes' death came weeks after police re-questioned him in the
unsolved 1981 bludgeoning murders of four people in a Laurel Canyon
home. Holmes was acquitted of the murders during a 1982 trial in
which jurors cited a lack of corroborating evidence.
   Holmes remained in jail for 111 days after the trial for
refusing to tell the Los Angeles County Grand Jury what he knew
about the slayings. During his incarceration he said his life had
been threatened by ``bad people with guns, bad breath and no sense
of humor.''
   He was released after testifying to the grand jury, but no one
else was ever charged in the slayings, which remain unsolved.
   At the trial, the prosecutor alleged that Holmes led the
murderers at gunpoint to the house at the orders of a nightclub
owner seeking revenge for a robbery.
   During this year's questioning, Holmes refused to talk about the
case, his attorney, Mitchell Egers, said two weeks ago.
   In his career, Holmes made hundreds of sexually explicit films
and thousands of peep shows. He was most notorious for his
portrayal of the character ``Johnny Wadd,'' a detective.
   He also admitted after his trial that he had a $1,000-a-day
cocaine habit that took the money he made from porn films.
   AIDS is transmitted through sex, shared hypodermic needles,
tainted blood products and from pregnant women to their babies.

   A robbery suspect who claimed he had AIDS was
locked in a patrol car and towed to a police station after he
threatened to bite any officer who approached him, authorities said
Monday.
   Raymond Simmons, 27, was removed from the squad car by police
wearing protective gear and taken to Roosevelt Hospital, where he
was seen by doctors in the emergency room and released 20 minutes
later, officials said.
   A hospital spokeswoman said she could not comment on Simmons'
condition because of confidentiality restrictions. Police said he
was classified as emotionally disturbed.
   AIDS is known to be transmitted through sexual contact, dirty
needles, tainted blood, and from mother to fetus. There are no
documented cases of the fatal disease being transmitted by biting,
said Gayle Lloyd, spokeswoman for the federal Centers for Disease
Control in Atlanta.
   The incident involving Simmons started Sunday morning, said
police spokesman Joseph McConville. Simmons allegedly grabbed money
from a teen-ager's pocket and a fistfight ensued, McConville said.
Police arrived, handcuffed Simmons and put him in the squad car.
   As the officers interviewed the teen-ager, Simmons, wearing a
wig and makeup, ``started cursing and kicking in the rear of the
radio car and told the cops he had AIDS and was going to die and
would take them with him,'' McConville said. ``He said he would
bite first cop that came near him.''
   Police called emergency services officers, who are trained to
deal with distraught people, and summoned a tow truck, McConville
said. The truck towed the squad car to the police station, where
emergency services officers removed Simmons, he said.
   Simmons faced a charge of attempted robbery, police said.

   The first foreign mission under a new law to
promote U.S. agricultural trade will go to Indonesia and the
Philippines this spring, Agriculture Secretary Richard E. Lyng
announced Monday.
   Exact dates will be negotiated with the countries, although Lyng
said the trip will be in mid-spring.
   The mission will include representatives from the departments of
Agriculture and State, and the U.S. Agency for International
Development. Three to six representatives of the private sector
also will be selected for the trip to Indonesia and the Philippines.
   ``During my recent trip to Asia, I discussed possible missions
with the leaders and key agricultural officials of both
countries,'' Lyng said. ``We agreed that these missions would not
only address the food needs of these countries, but would help
develop customers for U.S. agricultural exports as well.''
   The trips are required by the Agricultural Aid and Trade
Missions Act, passed by Congress late last year. It specified that
16 missions be conducted in 1988, with eight to be completed by
June.
   By offering specially designed packages of U.S. trade and food
assistance, the goal of the program is to help the designated
countries develop and to become larger markets for American farmers.

   Miss Williams, 35, who has two children from a previous
marriage, recently won her third Grammy for best female gospel
performance for ``I Believe in You'' on the album ``Water Under the

   Miss Williams began her career as a backup singer for Stevie

Mathis.
   Angelotti said Miss Williams is planning to go into the studio

   Two leftist leaders who were arrested
after returning from exile were charged Monday with trying to lead
a communist revolution in Turkey.
   Nihat Sargin, secretary-general of the Turkish Labor Party, and
Haydar Kutlu, secretary-general of the Turkish Communist Party,
have been held since they returned to their country from West
Germany in November.
   An indictment issued Monday contended the two ``established a
party with the aim of changing the constitutional order in Turkey
and indulged in clandestine activities to serve their purposes.''
   If convicted, the defendants face prison terms totaling 275
years each.
   Kutlu and Sargin returned from exile shortly after their
respective parties agreed to merge into a single Turkish Communist
Party. Turkey's constitution and criminal code forbid the
establishment of a communist party.
   Kutlu, 44, and Sargin, 62, also were charged with smuggling into
the country illegal publications that contained articles allegedly
insulting the president and the Turkish government.
   Kutlu and Sargin have claimed that the indictments were based on
statements they gave while being tortured.
   Sargin wrote to Premier Turgut Ozal on Thursday, reiterating the
torture allegations, newspapers reported Monday.
   The indictment also accused 12 other Turks of being members of
the Turkish Communist Party and demanded up to 12 years of
imprisonment for each.

   Tamil separatists raided a Sinhalese
village Monday, killed 11 Sinhalese civilians and seriously injured
six others, military officials said.
   The raid was the latest in a series of attacks on Sinhalese and
Tamil civilians by extremists in the northeast section of this
island nation.
   On Friday, 22 Tamils were killed in an attack on a bus.
   Government officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
the attack took place Monday afternoon on the Galmetiya village,
about 11 miles south of the northeastern city of Trincomalee.
   ``We blame the Tamil Tigers for this attack and cannot give more
details,'' one official said.
   He refused to speculate why the Tigers may have attacked the
village. During the past week, 67 civilians have been killed in
revenge slayings in the eastern parts of Sri Lanka.
   In an attack on a bus and a village, Tamil tigers killed 45
Sinhalese civilians last week in the north eastern Trincomalee
district.
   On Friday, a group of men wearing masks and black uniforms
attacked a passenger bus near the Horawapatans village, 28 miles
west of Trincomalee.
   Eighteen passengers, all Tamils, were killed and burned in the
attack, and four more died in hospitals.
   Police who arrested 15 Sinhalese men said the bus attack was
carried out by Sinhalese extremists avenging earlier killings of
Sinhalese citizens.
   In Batticaloa on Monday, Sri Lankan police used tear gas to
disperse about 2,000 people trying to march in support of a Tamil
woman on a fast for peace.
   Witnesses said about 2,000 men, women and children tried to walk
from Ariampattai village, five miles south east of Batticaloa, to
the Pillaiyar Hindu temple where a 58-year-old Tamil woman has been
fasting.
   Annamma David, who has not eaten since Feb. 19, demands that the
Indian government call an unconditional cease-fire and begin
negotiations with the Tamil Tiger rebels to end the fighting. The
rebels have put up posters in the northern capital of Jaffna
calling for a week-long strike beginning Tuesday in support Mrs.
David's fast.
   Militant Tamils have been fighting since 1983 for a separate
state in northern and eastern Sri Lanka, where most Tamils live.
   India has an estimated 45,000 soldiers in Sri Lanka to try to
enforce an Indian-sponsored peace accord signed last July to try to
end the war.
   Tamils, most of whom are Hindus, make up 18 percent of Sri
Lanka's 16 million population. They claim they are discriminated
against by the majority Sinhalese Buddhists, who control the
government and the military.
   India has become involved because it has 60 million ethnic
Tamils in its southern states.

   Chinese and Vietnamese ships exchanged fire Monday
near disputed islands in the South China Sea, and each side accused
the other of firing first, news reports said.
   Radio Press, quoting radio broadcasts from the two communist
capitals, said the exchange took place near the Spratly Islands, a
collection of islets and reefs claimed by Vietnam, China and the
Philippines.
   The exchange prompted harsh denunciations from Hanoi and Beijing
and threatened to escalate tensions between the two neighbors.
   China expressed ``great anger and strong protest'' over the
incident in a letter delivered to the Vietnamese Embassy in
Beijing, according to Radio Press, which monitors broadcasts from
communist nations in Tokyo.
   The report, quoting a broadcast by Radio Beijing, said
Vietnamese vessels fired on Chinese warships conducting routine
patrols and research in the area. It said the Chinese ships
returned fire in self-defense.
   Vietnam's Foreign Ministry accused China of distorting the
facts. It condemned Beijing for what it called an armed attack on
two Vietnamese cargo ships conducting ``routine operations.''
   The statement said the ships incurred moderate damage and fired
back in self-defense, according to Radio Press.
   Japan's Kyodo News Service said it was the first armed
confrontation between the two countries since bilateral territorial
disputes have increased in recent months.

   Rebels in northern Ethiopia on Monday
claimed they destroyed two government army brigades, killing and
wounding more than a thousand troops.
   Rebel fighters captured tanks, armoured trucks and heavy
artillery at the battle at Gelebeda in northeastern Tigray province
on March 12, according to Yemeni Kedani, a spokesman for the Tigre
People's Liberation Front.
   However, his reports could not be independently confirmed. The
Ethiopian government rarely comments on rebel reports.
   Kedani did not specify how many Ethiopian army troops were
killed in the Gelebeda battle, nor did he say if there were
casualties among the rebels.
   On March 7, Kedani claimed the guerrillas killed more than 2,500
Ethiopian soldiers and took control of three towns.
   Kedani also charged that the Ethiopian government was bombing
civilian areas in Tigray province. He said the bombing began
immediately after Ethiopian President Mengistu Haile Mariam
secretly visited the area in February.
   Kedani's group is one of several in northern Ethiopia fighting
for independence from the Addis Ababa government.

   Union leaders criticized Monday's walkout, the latest strike in

   The ship that left with much fanfare a
week ago carrying the first shipment of U.S.-built Hondas bound for
Japan has slipped quietly back to port for repairs.
   The return of the auto carrier Green Bay, which was built last
year in Japan, has complicated efforts by Honda to become the first
Japanese automaker to ship its U.S.-manufactured cars to Japan.
   A spokeswoman for the shipping agent said she had no idea when
the vessel would depart again. June Ainge, district manager for
Williams Dimond & Co. of Portland, said repair crews planned to
examine the vessel Monday.
   The Japanese-built ship left Portland last week with 540 Accords
and 100 Honda motorcyles on board. Sen. Bob Packwood, R-Ore., and
Tetsuo Chino, president of Honda North America Inc., participated
in a news conference to mark the occasion. Chino drove the first
car on board.
   On Sunday, the ship slipped in to the Swan Island drydock.
   Ms. Ainge refused to reveal details of the ship's problems or
its return.
   Francois L. Elmealeh of the Port of Portland's marine marketing
department said he didn't know the details of the ship's problems
but that it was of a ``non-life-threatening, non-cargo-threatening
nature.''
   ``I think it's an embarrassment more than anything,'' Elmealeh
said.
   Honda Motor Co. Ltd. had planned a gala reception to welcome the
vessel March 22 at Narashino Port, east of Tokyo.
   ``The party's postponed, and we're not sure now when it will be
held,'' said Bret Anderson, a Honda public relations official in
Tokyo.
   On Friday, the ship's captain decided to return to Portland, and
the vessel's owner, Central Gulf Lines of New Orleans, was notified.

<TEXT>
   The wife of a convicted smuggler
testified Monday that she disliked her husband's job with alleged
smuggler Carlos Lehder Rivas, but wound up as paymaster for his
crew.
   Lehder, 38, is on trial on charges that he and others conspired
to smuggling 3.3 tons of cocaine into Florida and Georgia from
Colombia via Norman's Cay in the Bahamas from 1978 to 1980.
   The witness' husband, Ed Ward, has testified he was the pilot on
most of those flights.
   Emilie Lassie Ward said she met her husband in 1976 and became
aware that he was involved in smuggling marijuana before their
marriage that summer and confronted him with it.
   ``He told me he was smuggling marijuana. I didn't like it. I was
very much in love with him and he rationalized it,'' she said.
   Ward took her into his confidence as his ``what if'er.''
   As he planned his smuggling operations, ``I would say `what if
this happened'?'' she said.
   All the time, she said she was concerned.
   ``I was worried about him getting arrested and worried about him
being killed,'' she testified.,
   In 1978, she and her husband discussed Lehder's offer to
transport cocaine.
   ``I didn't like it. It was the fear of cocaine. I didn't know
anything about it. It didn't seem like what he was doing was
safe,'' she said.
   She said Ward agreed to make 10 cocaine flights for Lehder, but
she said he quickly became disenchanted.
   Ward, who was very organized, had to deal with uncertain time
schedules and that Lehder wasn't following the safety measures that
Ward insisted upon, she said.
   Mrs. Ward described her duties in the smuggling organization as
counting and handing out the money to Ward's crew.
   Lehder, reputed to be one of the leaders in the violent
Colombian Medellin cartel, is charged with conspiracy, possession
of cocaine with intent to distribute, importation of cocaine and
operating a continuing criminal enterprise.
   Co-defendant Jack Carlton Reed, 57, of San Pedro, Calif., is
charged only with being a part of the smuggling conspiracy.

<TEXT>
   Texas lost another round Monday in its
battle to keep Florida citrus out of the state when a federal judge
refused to block those shipments.
   U.S. District Judge Filemon Vela said he needed more time to
study the state's request for a stay of a U.S. Department of
Agriculture decision lifting a ban on Florida citrus to other
producing states.
   Texas sought the stay until its suit against U.S. Secretary of
Agriculture Ricdard E. Lyng could be heard. The state sued Lyng on
Wednesday, accusing the USDA of violating the Adminstrative
Procedures Act when it lifted the 3{-year quarantine on Florida
citrus.
   Texas contends the USDA did not provide an opportunity to
comment on the decision as required by law.
   Monday's hearing was the second time since Texas sued Lyng that
Vela denied the state's request for a stay of the Feb. 11 USDA
ruling.
   Vela gave Texas five days to provide its evidence, from which he
will make a ruling.
   Texas officials say they want to keep Florida citrus out of the
state because they are not convinced an outbreak of bacterial
citrus canker has been controlled in Florida. The USDA quarantined
fruit from Florida after the disease was discovered there in August
1984.
   Canker, which comes in different strains, can cause defoliation
of trees, lesions that make the fruit unmarketable and premature
dropping of fruit from trees.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Jeanette Mercado, representing the USDA,
argued taht Texas has no standing to sue because a quarantine
affecting one industry lacks general importance for the state's
population as a whole.
   Texas Citrus Mutual, a growers' organization, has joined the
state in its lawsuit.
   ``We feel like that if we can get a federal court to address
whether the USDA violated their own administrative procedures, we
think we'll prevail,'' said Ray Prewett, executive vice president
of McAllen-based TCM.
   Bobby McKown of Florida Citrus Mutual said Florida suspended
shipments of fresh citrus to Texas, California, Arizona and
Louisiana on Friday, pending the outcome of Monday's hearing.
   ``We feel much encouraged and we're going to commence shipping
today fruit from Florida to the citrus producing states,'' McKown
said.
   Florida's primary interest in the Texas market is in specialty
fruits, such as tangeloes and honey tangerines, he said.
   Texas officials are seeking to at least keep the fruit out of
the Rio Grande Valley, where the state's $65 million industry is
concentrated in the three southernmost counties.
   Last fall, the USDA published a proposal to lift the Florida
quarantine, but on Jan. 5 withdrew the proposal after new canker
outbreaks were discovered.
   On Feb. 15, four days after USDA lifted the quarantine, Texas
imposed an emergency 30-day quarantine on fresh Florida citrus, and
set up highway roadblocks.
   A federal judge in Austin overturned the Texas quarantine March
1, ruling the federal regulation took precedence.
   A Gulf Coast area of Florida infested with the aggressive
Asiatic strain of canker will remain under quarantine.

   Charleston County schools are segregated
and local school boundaries hamper integration, an expert witness
said Monday as the plaintiff's case in the seven-year-old federal
desegregation suit neared a close.
   ``The schools are racially segregated,'' said William Gordon, a
professor of education at Wright State University in Dayton, Ohio.
   Gordon, armed with a thick black notebook containing results of
a lengthy study of the schools, said the boundaries of eight local
districts within the countywide district hamper both integration
and good education.
   Gordon took the stand as testimony resumed following a two-month
break.
   The suit centers on a 1967 state law which consolidated the
county schools under a countywide.
   The complaint by the U.S. Justice Department alleges that
control of student and faculty assignments were retained by the
local districts for racial reasons.
   Gordon testified on behalf of the Legal Defense Fund which has
intervened on behalf of the families of several Charleston County
school children in the case.
   The Justice Department has completed its case and the Legal
Defense Fund is expected to wrap up its case by midweek. U.S.
District Judge Sol Blatt Jr. is hearing the non-jury trial.
   The complaint asks that Blatt find the local district boundaries
unconstitutional and order steps to promote integration. Blatt has
ruled out busing as a possible remedy.
   Gordon testified that about a third of the schools in the county
can be identified as black, a third white and a third racially
mixed. His guideline for determining a racially identifiable school
is whether the black-white student ratio is more than 15 percent
different from the black-white mix countywide.
   Gordon said that of 35 schools that opened as identifiably white
schools, 17 are still white. Of the 20 that opened as identifiably
black schools, 17 are still black.
   The system of local district lines means ``you take away good
solid educational choices from those who should be making the
decisions,'' Gordon said. ``The boundary becomes the decision.''
   ``Educators should be making the decisions where children go to
school, not boundaries,'' he added.
   He said adherence to the local boundaries has meant overcrowding
in some county schools while others aren't being used to capacity.

   Kansas Sen. Bob Dole, saying he would lose
people's trust ``if I cut and run the first bad news we get,'' said
Monday he has no plans to drop his presidential bid after Tuesday's
Illinois primary even if George Bush scores another big victory.
   ``I've made a judgment that Illinois, whatever happens, we're
going to keep going,'' Dole said at a news conference.
   He acknowledged the possibility that a candidate might not
understand when to get out.
   ``Now if you're out there and you've been twisting in the wind
for six or eight months and you're starting to smell a little,
somebody has to cut the rope,'' he said.
   Still, despite polls showing Bush with a lead among Illinois
Republicans of up to 34 points over Dole, the senator said, ``We
believe the bounce is starting to wear of a bit from Super
Tuesday.''
   He referred to the effects of last Tuesday when Bush won 16
primaries to surge far ahead of the rest of the GOP presidential
field.
   ``I think we've made some inroads,'' said Dole when asked about
his prospects in Illinois. ``I don't think we've had quite enough
time. It's a big state.''
   He said a ``realistic estimate'' of his prospects would be 40
percent of the 82 delegates to be elected in the primary.
   Dole said that when a decision is made about the future of his
candidacy ``it will be made by Bob Dole.''
   To emphasize his determination to fight on, Dole planned to
campaign Tuesday in Wisconsin and Connecticut, two of the next
battlegrounds in the race.
   Hammering away at Bush for refusing to participate in a
one-on-one debate, Dole said, ``Why should somebody who's as far
ahead as he is be afraid to stand up and debate issues with
somebody he indicated doesn't have any leadership ability.
   ``I think it's a mark of weakness that he's unwilling with this
big, big lead he has, to say, sure I'll take on Bob Dole any day of
the week. Why shouldn't he?
   ``I may be a pushover. But I dare him to try it.''
   In a speech to the Chicago Council on Foreign Relations, Dole
referred to ``the point where presidential advisers are peddling
arms to the ayatollah while others hear no evil, see no evil,'' an
obvious reference to Bush.
   When Dole was asked why he didn't attack Bush more on
Iran-Contra, he said, ``If I hit him, I get Ronald Reagan first and
then they say, oh, oh, he's out there attacking Ronald Reagan.
   ``It's pretty hard to reach Bush _ except by telephone.''

   Part of the stage collapsed at the
beginning of an inaugural concert at a theater in southeastern
Brazil, injuring 55 musicians.
   About 100 members of the Sao Paulo Symphony Orchestra and the
Americana Lyric Theater had just begun performing the national
anthem when rear tiers of the stage caved in, dropping some
musicians nine feet to the floor.
   The incident occured March 4 in Americana, a city 360 miles
southwest of Rio with a population of 122,000.
   Many of those injured suffered broken arms and legs and dozens
of instruments were damaged, the local Jornal do Brasil newspaper
reported.
   It said the concert was being performed before an audience of
900 in the municipal theater, which had just been completed.
   Another inaugural ceremony will be held Thursday, the newspaper
said.

<TEXT>
   Presidential candidate Jesse Jackson
told hundreds of supporters Monday that he would win the Illinois
primary, and not once did he mention rival Sen. Paul Simon, whose
hometown is only six miles away.
   ``On the eve of a significant breakthrough in politics in
Illinois ... with your help, we the people can win Illinois,''
Jackson told about 1,800 cheering backers, an equal mixture of
blacks and whites of all ages.
   ``I tell you, we the people will win.''
   According to a Chicago Tribune poll published Monday, Jackson is
in a virtual dead heat with fellow Democrat Simon.
   But Jackson didn't mention Simon in his hour-long speech at
Southern Illinois University at Carbondale.
   Instead, he reiterated that his candidacy represents a ``Rainbow
Coalition,'' people of all races and age groups. ``Our hope is
sweeping the country,'' he said.
   ``We're running a poor campaign with a rich message,'' Jackson
said. ``Stop drugs. Save jobs. Invest in our children. Peace in the
world.''
   Jackson told the crowd, on its feet through most of the speech,
that the flow of drugs and drug use is the No. 1 problem in the
United States.
   And he said that if elected president, he'd use the Armed Forces
to fight drug trafficking.
   ``I don't want communist insurgencies from the left, and drug
war lords from the right,'' said Jackson, eliciting cries of, ``Yes
sir,'' and, ``Amen.'' ``Let's make America better and keep America
strong.''
   Also, the Chicago civil rights leader promoted fair prices for
farmers, fair wages for workers, justice and peace.
   And Jackson hammered away at U.S. companies that do business
overseas, taking advantage of cheap labor while driving up
unemployment in this country.
   Jackson touted his managerial skills, noting that on the Super
Tuesday campaign he spent only $100,000 in advertising, compared
with his challengers who spent millions.
   ``Once again, little David versus the financial giants,'' he
said.
   ``I'm running the most cost-efficient campaign. I'm getting the
most return on my investment,'' said Jackson.
   The poll in Monday's Chicago Tribune found 32 percent of the
state's Democratic voters supported Jackson while 29 percent backed
Simon, and 20 percent favored Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis.
   The poll, taken of 500 Democrats likely to vote in Tuesday's
primary, has an error margin of plus or minus five percentage
points _ making the Jackson-Simon race a dead heat. A Sunday
Tribune poll had Simon ahead.
   Jackson reminded the crowd in Carbondale of the civil rights
struggle in the 1960s, and said a black man could be elected
president if he cared about all people, as he said he did.
   ``I know just because you're born in the slum doesn't mean the
slum is born in you, and you can rise above it,'' he said. ``Pull
your weight. Let your presence be felt tomorrow.''

<HEAD>British Farm Minister Questions U.S. Stand on Ending Subsidies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   British Agriculture Minister John MacGregor on
Monday questioned whether President Reagan's administration means
to end farm subsidies entirely.
   The administration has said it wants them phased out
internationally by the year 2000. It also favors ``decoupling'' of
subsidies from the prices farmers get for crops.
   MacGregor told reporters that while he favored a substantial
reduction in subsidies worldwide, removing them altogether ``is I
think a debatable question because after all decoupling itself does
involve subsidies and decoupling is in the American negotiating
position.''
   Britain is one of the 12 countries in the European Economic
Community, the main U.S. negotiating partner on issues of world
farm trade. The other members are West Germany, France, Italy,
Ireland, Denmark, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Spain,
Portugal and Greece.
   Frans Andriessen of the Netherlands, who is in charge of
agriculture for the European Community's governing body, the
European Commission, told reporters recently the EEC disagrees with
the complete elimnination of subsidies, saying they are needed to
preserve small farms. He suggested that Congress and U.S. farmers
would not stand for complete elimination either.
   Others in the EEC have called the U.S. goal unrealistic.
MacGregor said Andriessen both have pointed to recent efforts by
the EEC to hold down spending on farm supports.
   According to a study published last Friday by Fred H. Sanderson,
formerly in charge of food policy at the State Department, in 1986
supporting farm prices cost consumers and taxpayers about $30
billion in this country and $63 billion in 10 of the Community
countries. Spain and Portugal are not included in those figures.
   MacGregor said he could not estimate the pace at which these
costs could be reduced.

<DATELINE>INDIANAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of State Evan Bayh meets a
constitutional residency requirement to be governor because he
always intended to return to Indiana during his temporary absences,
a judge ruled Monday.
   Circuit Judge Charles D. O'Connor said that Bayh has been a
lifelong resident of Indiana and didn't lose that residency when he
worked for a District of Columbia law firm in 1983 and 1984.
   Bayh, a 32-year-old Democrat who leads public opinion polls in
the governor's race, said he was ``gratified but not surprised'' by
the decision.
   But David F. McNamar, the special counsel for the GOP-controlled
State Election Board, said he plans to appeal the ruling to the
Indiana Supreme Court.
   ``I'm going to go ahead until someone tells me to stop,'' said
McNamar.
   O'Connor accepted the arguments presented during Friday's
one-day trial by Bayh's attorneys, who said Bayh's intention to
return to his home state meant that he met a five-year residency
requirement.
   McNamar said he wants to give the Supreme Court a chance to
consider his argument that the framers of the state constitution
wanted a potential governor to have been physically present for
five uninterrupted years before election.
   Bayh faces active opposition from former Kokomo Mayor Stephen J.
Daily in the May 3 Democratic primary. Senate Minority Leader Frank
L. O'Bannon also has filed for the primary.
   Lt. Gov. John M. Mutz is unopposed for the Republican nomination
to succeed Gov. Robert Orr, who is barred by the Constitution from
seeking a third straight term.

<HEAD>Launch Of Soviet Shuttle Possible This Week, Scientist Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HUNTSVILLE, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Soviet launch of an unmanned
spacecraft similar to the U.S. space shuttle could take place this
week, with a crew of two possibly heading into orbit six months
later, a knowledgeable expert says.
   Nick Johnson, an advisory scientist for Teledyne Brown
Engineering in Colorado Springs, Colo., quoted unidentified
European sources close to the Soviet space effort as saying the
launch could be Thursday or Saturday, The Huntsville Times reported
Sunday.
   ``The Soviets have said it is `imminent,''' said Johnson, who
keeps close tabs on the Soviet space program. ``The frequency of
reports is climbing very rapidly. It could be late next week. Like
any new vehicle, problems can crop up.''
   Johnson has written four books on the Soviet program and
publishes the annual Soviet Year in Space.
   Analysts say the first Soviet reusable shuttle flight will be
unmanned, with a totally computerized orbital flight, re-entry and
touchdown at a landing strip next to the launch site at the
Baikonur Cosmodrome in Central Asia, the newspaper said.
   Charles Vick, an employee of the Space and Rocket Center in
Huntsville and a part-time Soviet space analyst, said the Soviet
shuttle will be attached to the new heavy-lift rocket named
Energia, which underwent its first test flight last October.
   The Soviet shuttle strongly resembles NASA's shuttle, but while
the NASA craft has the main liquid fuel engines in the orbiter, the
Soviet shuttle main engines are attached to the external fuel tank,
Vick said.
   He said it has small maneuvering thrusters in the tail as well
as four jet engines that give it ``go-around'' capability on
landing. The U.S. shuttle glides down without power and must land
on the first try.

<TEXT>
   Vice President George Bush, playing
down suggestions that he is closing in on the Republican
presidential nomination, said Monday ``the speculation has gotten
ahead of the story.''
   Bush's imposing lead in delegates, gained in Super Tuesday
primaries a week ago, left his opponents wondering where to turn to
revive their campaigns. Illinois may not be the place; polls
indicate voters in Tuesday's primary are strongly pro-Bush.
   ``I feel the speculation has gotten ahead of the story,'' he
told reporters aboard Air Force II as he headed for the state
capital.
   Bush said he wouldn't get caught up in ``a lot of premature
speculation about the future'' and whether his rivals would stay in
the race. But asked if he was surprised Dole said he would continue
his candidacy, Bush said, ``I'm not sure I understand what he's
doing.''
   Bush said the aftershock of his Super Tuesday sweep ``seems to
be more persuasive, have a heavier impact than we would have
predicted.''
   At a rally here, Bush said the Illinois primary will be a
``national referendum'' on his candidacy.
   ``I believe if I win it tomorrow, as I think I can, I really
think I will be the next president of the United States of
America,'' Bush told about 400 supporters in a firehouse at the
Capital Airport in Springfield.
   ``If I win convincingly, if I win to exceed expectations, you
can say that in the firehouse, right here, you met with, hopefully
voted for, the next president of the United States.''
   Recent polls show Bush with an overwhelming lead over his two
remaining Republican rivals, Dole and former television evangelist
Pat Robertson. Bush told supporters not to take comfort from his
standing in the polls because such surveys had been proven wrong
before.
   Bush also emphasized his ties to President Reagan.
   ``This is the presidency,'' he said. ``It is different than
anything else. I've stood side by side, through thick and through
thin, with a president for whom I have great respect, Ronald
Reagan.''
   Bush told reporters that he was not concerned about the
re-emergence of the Iran-Contra affair as criminal actions begin.
He said it had ``no relevance to what I'm doing.''

<HEAD>Trash Scavengers Competing With Recycling Program For Trash</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM C. HIDLAY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scavengers are competing with a pilot recycling
program by picking up newspapers and cans put out by residents for
special collection, officials say.
   ``It's easy pickings for these scavengers to come along and
supplement their income,'' says Patrick Barry, a recycling
consultant who designed the new program in Chicago's Beverly
neighborhood.
   ``We've got so many people putting (recyclable) material out
that it's easy to pick up a ton of newspaper in an hour,'' he said.
   He estimated the program was losing about $200 every seven days
because the scavengers were helping themselves to about four tons
of newspaper weekly.
   Barry said the neighborhood program's revenues vary from
week-to-week depending on the number of tons collected, hitting a
peak of about $1,400 per week. So, he estimated that the loss would
represent from 15 percent to 20 percent of weekly revenues.
   ``We've got two different recycling systems converging and it's
not bad from a recycling point of view,'' Barry said. ``But it cuts
into the money for the program.''
   Barry, who also is a spokesman for the Greater Chicago Recycling
Industry Council, an organization of 400 recycling businesses, said
scavengers operate all ovr the country.
   ``They're called alley entrepreneurs,'' he said. ``Some of these
people have developed shrewd operations. They're not always street
people. Some of them are sophisticated business people who are
making enough money for a bare living,'' Barry said.
   Chicago has an estimated 1,500 scavengers, he said. They make
anywhere from $30 to $150 a week sifting aluminimu cans, bottles
and newspaperes from the 9,000 tons of garbage produced daily in
the city, he said.
   The city's 20 privately run recycling centers pay an average of
40 cents a pound for aluminum and about 2 cents a pound for
newspaper or glass, he said.
   ``Some of (the scavengers) drive station wagons or pickup trucks
on routes to bars and restaurants to collect aluminum cans and
bottles,'' Barry said.
   Though scavengers work throughout Chicago, a group of six to
eight alley entrepreneurs is taking advantage of the five-week-old
recycling program in Beverly on the city's Southwest Side, he said.
   The Beverly program, a city pilot project and one of seven
neighborhood recycling programs, has attracted the most
participation from residents _ and the most attention from
scavengers, Barry said.
   The Resource Center, a private, non-profit recycling business
that runs the Beverly program, says about 60 percent of the
neighborhood's residents separate newspapers, aluminum cans and
other recyclable material from their garbage and leave it at the
curb in special blue boxes.
   Resource Center drivers pick up the trash daily, if they get
there before the alley entrepreneurs.
   The scavengers usually raid between 6 a.m. and 8 a.m., said Ken
Dunn, director of the Resource Center.
   ``One gentleman is a minister at a small church that doesn't
support him well,'' Dunn said. ``So he's devised a system to
recycle materials from his congregation and he also, in his free
time, collects out on the streets this way to supplement his
income.''
   Dunn said the Resource Center has hired some of the alley
entrepreneurs to drive recycling trucks, but others say the don't
want such a formal job.
   Barry said he hopes the City Council will adopt a proposed
ordinance that would make it illegal for unauthorized persons to
take waste set out for special recycling collections. The proposal
calls for fining violators from $100 to $500.
   ``Trash scavenging is going to be a problem in areas with large
low-income populations,'' Barry said. ``They're trying to make 10
bucks to make it through to tomorrow. You can't fault them for
that.''

   President Reagan on Monday wished West German
Defense Minister Manfred Woerner success in his future post as NATO
secretary general and thanked him for Bonn's contributions to the
alliance, a German official said.
   Woerner in July will become NATO's first German
secretary-general, succeeding Britain's Lord Carrington. He arrived
Sunday night for two days of meetings with U.S. officials,
lawmakers and the media.
   In addition to White House meetings with Reagan and his national
security adviser, Lt. Gen. Colin L. Powell, Woerner lunched with
Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci and also met with Secretary of
State George P. Shultz.
   Reagan and Woerner agreed that the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization summit at Brussels earlier this month was a success
and had strengthened the alliance, said a German official who
talked to a reporter on condition he not be named.
   The source also quoted Reagan as thanking Woerner for the share
of the common defense borne by West Germany and praising Bonn's
reliability as a defense partner.
   Before departing for Europe late Tuesday, Woerner planned talks
with several members of the Senate and meetings with reporters.

<TEXT>
   The nation's first research center for head
injury patients adjusting to their disability will be established
at the State University of New York at Buffalo, school officials
said Monday.
   While four other U.S. centers treat ``traumatic brain injury''
patients in the hospital, university officials said their center is
unique because it will deal with the psychological, practical and
social problems of returning to normal life.
   ``Patients go back with their families, even if they didn't live
there before. And now what do you do?'' said Barry Willer,
co-director of the center and associate professor of psychiatry.
   The center will be funded primarily by a five-year, $3 million
grant from the U.S. Department of Education, with $2 million more
from funding of ongoing research.
   Recent advances in emergency medical care, stemming from
techniques developed largely during the Vietnam War, have increased
the number of those suffering from severe brain injuries, Willer
said. Years ago people with severe brain injuries would have died.
   The $5 million grant is part of a national push from the federal
government to help traumatic brain-injured patients, school
officials said.
   The injury to White House press secretary James Brady, who was
shot in the 1981 assassination attempt of Preside wouldn't have gone after
them,'' Hill
said of Pickens.
   Homestake Vice President Richard W. Stumbo took the bid
seriously.
   ``You always take him seriously,'' Stumbo said, adding he did
not know if Mesa's withdrawal was the end of its takeover efforts.
   Homestake holds interests in oil and natural gas and mines
uranium, silver and gold, as does Newmont Mining Corp., another
major gold producer targeted in an earlier, unsuccessful hostile
takeover bid by Pickens.
   New York-based Newmont was approached last year by Ivanhoe
Partners, a group led by Pickens, which made a $2 billion hostile
bid for control of the company.
   A Delaware court blocked the move in October when it upheld a
``market sweep'' in which Newmont's biggest shareholder, Britain's
Consolidated Gold Fields PLC, grabbed enough shares in a two-day
buying spree to raise its holdings to nearly 50 percent of Newmont
and thwart the hostile bid.

<HEAD>Temperatures Plunge Across Eastern Two-Thirds Of Nation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Temperatures typical of the middle of winter covered much of the
eastern two-thirds of the nation Monday, with record lows across
the South, and snow flakes fell as far south as Georgia.
   Afternoon temperatures were below freezing as far south as the
southern Appalachians, Kentucky, southern Missouri and northern
Kansas.
   Record lows included 18 at Abilene, Texas; 19 at Albuquerque,
N.M.; 26 at Dallas-Fort Worth; 17 at Midland, Texas; and 20 at San
Angelo, Texas. Shreveport, La., tied its record of 29. Abilene's
former record of 20 had been on the books since 1895.
   More record low temperatures were expected across the Gulf
states Tuesday and Wednesday mornings.
   A freeze warning was posted overnight across all of Georgia,
Alabama and Mississippi, and inland sections of northwestern
Florida.
   Snow flurries fell as far south as Atlanta while sections of the
Tennessee and Ohio valleys received a dusting of snow during the
morning.
   Snow flurries also were reported over the Appalachians, in parts
of Virginia and across southern New England.
   Moisture from the Great Lakes continued to produce lake effect
snow squalls across the southern shores of lakes Erie, Michigan and
Superior. Snow continued to fall over in extreme northern
Wisconsin, where total accumulation since Saturday could reach just
over 2 feet along the southern edge of Lake Superior.
   During the morning, northeastern Ohio reported 4 to 5 inches at
the town of Conneaut, the National Weather Service said. Five
inches of snow fell in sections of western New York.
   Another storm system began gathering strength in Canada, just
north of western Montana. Heavy snow began falling during the
morning in northwestern Montana and a section of northern Idaho and
snow was expected to spread across much of Montana and Wyoming by
Wednesday.
   Elsewhere, showers produced rain over extreme southern sections
of Florida.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 15
degrees at Alpena, Mich., to 77 at Palm Springs, Calif. The low for
the day was 20 degrees below zero at Chadron, Neb.
   For Tuesday, snow showers were forecast from the Great Lakes
across the upper Ohio Valley and the northern and central
Appalachians to New England. Snow also was forecast from northern
and central Rockies to the western borders of South Dakota and
Nebraska.
   Highs in the 20s or 30s were predicted from the northern and
central Atlantic Coast states across the Appalachians, the Ohio and
Tennessee valleys, the Great Lakes, and the northern halves of the
Mississippi Valley, Plains and Rockies; in the 60s in southern
Florida and across most of Texas and New Mexico; in the 60s or 70s
in much of Arizona, southern Nevada and California; a few 80s in
the desert Southwest; and in the 40s or 50s elsewhere.

   President and Mrs. Reagan are hopeful that son
Michael's book describing a troubled childhood and family problems
will help others in similar situations, a White House spokeswoman
said Monday.
   Michael Reagan, 43, has just completed his autobiography, ``On
the Outside Looking In,'' to be published by Zebra Books. In an
interview with People magazine, the adopted son of the president
said he grew up resentful and ``didn't feel I belonged in so
perfect a family.''
   ``I've spent my life trying to figure out how to make Ronald
Reagan my friend,'' the younger Reagan said.
   The president and first lady read Michael's book over the
weekend at Camp David, Md., called him Sunday evening to compliment
him on it, said Mrs. Reagan's press secretary, Elaine Crispen.
   ``They thought it was very good, very interesting,'' Mrs.
Crispen said.
   The couple told Michael they hoped it would ``help other
children who went through the same situation _ molestation _ and
help other children adjust to adoption,'' Mrs. Crispen quoted Mrs.
Reagan as saying.
   The first lady was referring to a section of the book in which
Michael describes how he was molested and photographed in the nude
by a day-camp leader when he was seven years old. He had kept the
incident secret until last year.
   The book also contains reports of arguments between Michael and
his stepmother. Asked if the Reagans had been concerned that the
book might be critical of them, Mrs. Crispen said that was not the
case.
   ``They said the book was good, and that if you read it all, it
comes out balanced,'' the spokeswoman said.
   Michael Reagan was adopted when his father was married to
actress Jane Wyman. The couple also had a daughter, Maureen. After
divorcing Miss Wyman, Reagan married actress Nancy Davis and
fathered two other children, Ron and Patti.
   In his book, Michael relates how he set out last year to find
out who his biological mother was and that the president helped by
calling the governor of California.
   ``When my father helped me with this, it was the biggest gift he
ever gave me. He set me free,'' People magazine quotes Reagan as
saying.
   Reagan learned that he was born out of wedlock to Irene Flaugher
Lange, who gave him up at birth in Los Angeles in 1945 and later
worked as a movie bit player under the name Betty Arnold. She
married an Ohio restaurateur and had a son, Barry Lange, and died
in 1985.
   Reagan's half-brother visited him and brought an album their
mother had kept that was full of pictures and clippings of the
Reagans.
   ``It was the most wonderful feeling in the world when I found
out she knew all along who I was, and that this mother had kept
track of this child,'' Reagan said.
   Reagan and his father had a long talk in January in which
Michael said he told his father of the feelings of abandonment he
suffered as he was growing up.
   He quoted his father as saying, ``My God, I thought just telling
you I loved you was all I had to do.''

<HEAD>Anonymous Tests To Seek AIDS Antibodies in Newborns in 30 Cities</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOSEPH B. FRAZIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Newborn babies in 30 cities will be checked for
AIDS antibodies in anonymous tests the federal Centers for Disease
Control hopes will provide an early and broader look at who is
getting the disease.
   The tests, to be at selected hospitals, are part of a series of
surveys designed to eventually test 1.6 million Americans a year
for acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
   Blood samples from the newborns will be sent without names for
testing, CDC spokeswoman Gayle Lloyd said Monday. The study hopes
to determine the extent to which AIDS has penetrated heterosexual
women of child-bearing age, thought to be a low-risk group.
   Other programs, some of which are already under way, will test
blood samples from sexually transmitted disease clinics, drug
clinics, tuberculosis clinics, military recruits, job corps blood
donors and others, she said.
   Some tests will be routine and anonymous while others will be
voluntary with confidential results, she said.
   Early results are expected next fall, and the findings probably
will determine which programs are continued, she said. The CDC is
helping finance the programs at a cost of an estimated $47 million
for fiscal 1988.
   Some doctors say it violates ethics to test samples from known
people without permission and that getting permission would narrow
the population being tested.
   ``This is the least offensive way of getting a reliable general
population sample,'' Dr. Tim Dondero, chief of surveillance and
evaluation for the CDC's AIDS program.
   Others question whether it is ethical not to tell a patient
something he or she should know.
   ``To simply have the results and not have the ability to do
something with the results isn't a completely reasonable position,
is it?'' asked Dr. Wade Parks, a pediatrics professor at the Miami
School of Medicine.
   Only about half the babies who test positively carry the virus.
The others get a dose of antibody proteins from their infected
mothers. A positive antibodies test on a baby proves only that the
mother carries the virus.
   Similar tests on 30,000 newborns in Massachusetts revealed that
one of every 476 women giving birth there was infected. Not all who
carry the virus eventually develop AIDS.
   The newborns will be tested in 20 cities with a high AIDS
incidence. They are Atlanta, Baltimore, Boston, Chicago, Cleveland,
Dallas, Denver, Detroit, Houston, Jacksonville, Fla., Los Angeles,
Miami, New Orleans, New York, Newark, N.J., Richmond, Va., San
Francisco, San Juan, Puerto Rico, St. Louis, and Washington.
   Tests also will be done in the low-incidence cities of
Albuquerque, N.M., Honolulu, Kansas City, Mo., Memphis, Tennessee,
Minneapolis, New Haven, Conn., Phoenix, Ariz., Rochester, N.Y.,
Salt Lake City and Seattle.
   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome attacks the body's ability
to ward off disease. It is transmitted through sexual contact with
an infected person, shared hypodermic needles and blood
transfusions, and can be passed from mothers to their offspring.
There is no known cure.
   Since June, 1981 there have been 55,167 cases counted in the
United States and 30,932 patients have died.

   University of Minnesota officials said Monday
they hope to quickly name an interim president to replace Kenneth
Keller, who resigned amid controversy about the cost of renovating
his official residence and campus office.
   Meanwhile, Gov. Rudy Perpich withdrew his request for an
appropriation of $23.1 million to fund Keller's program, called
``Commitment to Focus,'' to raise standards at the university while
cutting undergraduate enrollment.
   Perpich said support for the funding had dwindled because of the
controversy over the renovations.
   Keller, president of the university for three years, met
privately with Perpich before calling a news conference late Sunday
night to announce his departure.
   ``At no time did I discuss that he resign, absolutely not,''
Perpich told a news conference.
   However, Perpich said he told Keller he had two options:
``Either leave, or you have a very dramatic plan...to continue with
Focus and get the university back on track.'''
   Perpich said the Board of Regents should consider using a
portion of a $53 million reserve fund to meet the immediate needs
of the quality-improvement program, which the governor said he
continues to support.
   The existence of the reserve fund was revealed last week as a
result of audits ordered after news reports raised questions about
the renovations.
   News reports said that $1.5 million had been spent to renovate
Eastcliff, the university president's mansion, and $200,000 was
spent remodeling Keller's campus office suite.
   The regents never gave formal approval for the mansion
renovation, which was orginally supposed to cost $400,000, the
legislative auditor's office said.
   Among the most embarrassing expenditures were those for a
mahogany desk and credenza for Keller's office that the legislative
auditor said cost $17,445. Keller has offered to pay for the office
furniture.
   The university reportedly met the cost overruns by dipping into
the reserve fund, which included profits from book stores, parking
lots and temporary investments. The audits released last week did
not question the legality of the fund, but criticized accounting
and reporting procedures.
   Earlier Monday, David Lebedoff, chairman of the 12-member Board
of Regents, said he hoped an interim president could be named at a
special meeting Wednesday. Selection of a permanent replacement
could take months.
   Lebedoff, who headed a search committee that recommended Keller
to be president of the 55,000-student school, pledged continued
support for Commitment to Focus.
   ``All of my life I will be proud that we selected a president
who came up with a plan to make this university even better,''
Lebedoff said.
   Some lawmakers had criticizeed the Focus program as smacking of
elitism, and the $23.1 million proposed by Perpich for the program
was $12 million less than the university had requested.
   Legedoff said the regents should have demanded an accounting of
the remodeling projects, but added that under existing guidelines
the spending should have been reported.
   Keller, 53, apologized in his resignation statement Sunday.
   ``Over the past few weeks, you and I have lived with stories
about Eastcliff renovations and repairs,'' Keller said.
   ``The stories have not been good ones,'' he said. ``I bear a key
responsibility for it. ... I am profoundly embarrassed and
profoundly sorry for it.''
   The legislative auditor's report said the involvement of Keller
and his wife, university attorney Bonita Sindelir, in the
renovation led to some of the Spending on the mansion was revealed
in news media reports in early February. Keller annoyed some
legislators by going to Hawaii on a vacation instead of being
available to answer questions about the remodeling.
   Keller, a native of New York City, came to the university in
1964 as an assistant professor in chemical engineering and
materials science, and became a department head in 1979.

<HEAD>Minnesota May Test Students For Understanding Of AIDS</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state Board of Education is studying
a proposal to test students about their understanding of AIDS
prevention, but the Legislature is considering action to kill the
program.
   ``There are states doing innovative things in the area of AIDS
education, but Minnesota is the first I've heard about that is
trying to mandate assessment this way,'' said Katherine Fraser,
co-director of the AIDS Education Project of the National
Association of State Boards of Education.
   ``It's a good idea because it involves an educational program
aimed at changing behavior and that's what is really needed to
fight AIDS,'' she said.
   Fraser commented last week after the state Board of Education
took the first steps toward requiring students in the sixth and
10th grades to be tested on their knowledge of AIDS prevention.
   The proposal also would require school districts to teach
courses on prevention of AIDS and other communicable diseases in
kindergarten through the senior year of high school.
   The proposal still faces public hearings and the scrutiny of an
administrative law judge before taking effect. Department of
Education officials say the process will take about 10 months to a
year and cost $10,000 to $20,000.
   A bill pending in the Legislature which would block board's plan
was passed unanimously by the School Finance Division of the House
Education Committee Friday and will be discussed Wednesday before
the full House Education Committee.
   ``We disagree on mandating. We think school districts in
Minnesota have good progams in place, and we'd like to continue to
help them do that. Taking the time and money to develop a rule
might upset this progress,'' said state Rep. Bob McEachern, sponsor
of the move to block the board's proposal.
   Fraser says the school boards association backs mandatory AIDS
education because it means local school boards do not have to face
as much controversy from people offended by discussion of AIDS.
``They can just say, `It's the requirement. Let's work on how we
can meet it,''' she said.
   According to the Minnesota Department of Education, about 386
Minnesota school districts say they have some kind of AIDS
education, but provide no information on what kind. That means
about 50 districts still don't have any type of AIDS education.
   Board member John Plocker, who prefers a voluntary approach,
said the board still wants local school boards to shape their
programs. ``We're just telling them they have to do it. There's
still a lot of latitude,'' he said.

   Bob Dole declared Monday ``it's not over'' for his Republican
presidential campaign despite indications of a big Illinois victory
for George Bush, but Democrat Paul Simon admitted ``I have no plans
beyond tomorrow'' and the home-state primary he needs to win.
   With five presidential candidates racing around the state in a
final day of campaigning, Jesse Jackson was buoyed by a poll
suggesting he may have pulled even with fellow favorite son Simon.
   ``On the eve of a significant breakthrough ... with your help,
we the people can win Illinois,'' Jackson told a cheering crowd of
about 1,800 in Carbondale, Ill. ``I tell you, we the people will
win.''
   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, lying third, sought a good
enough showing to keep up some momentum from Super Tuesday. Over
and over on Monday, Dukakis hammered at Simon's contention that the
Democratic convention will be deadlocked.
   It ``would be a disaster'' for the Democrats to end the primary
process without a nominee-to-be, Dukakis said, with ``negotiating,
dealing, people behind closed doors trying to decide who the
nominee ought to be.''
   The problem for Dole was much more immediate than the
conventions, months away in the summer. The Kansas Republican was
looking for a way to keep his campaign alive in the face of a
string of Bush victories.
   ``It's not over for Bob Dole,'' he told the Executives Club of
Chicago.
   Later, at a news conference, Dole repeated his determination to
continue beyond Tuesday: ``I've made a judgment that Illinois,
whatever happens, we're going to keep going.''
   The Kansas senator said he had ``made some inroads'' against
Bush in Illinois, but that there had not been enough time to stop
Bush's surge after a 16-state win last Tuesday.
   ``You want to elect momentum or elect the better candidate?'' he
asked the Executives Club audience. ``Maybe it's going to take a
couple of weeks for everything to sort of slow down.''
   But the Illinois outlook for Dole was not good.
   A Chicago Tribune poll said Bush was the choice of 62 percent of
the likely GOP voters in Illinois, with only 28 percent for Dole.
   Such a strong showing could give Bush a big chunk of the 82
Republican delegates at stake in Illinois. Added to his current
total of 705 delegates, it could give him more than 60 percent of
the 1,139 needed to win the nomination at the GOP National
Convention in New Orleans in August. Dole has 165.
   Despite the numbers, Bush told a reporter that suggestions he
has locked up the nomination are premature.
   ``I feel the speculation has gotten ahead of the story,'' Bush
said as he flew on Air Force Two from Chicago to Springfield, Ill.
However, when asked if he were surprised that Dole was staying in
the race, he replied: ``I'm not sure I understand what he's doing.''
   On the Democratic side, Simon was facing the reality that he has
to win the Illinois primary to keep even his stripped-down campaign
alive until the Democratic National Convention in July.
   ``I have no plans beyond tomorrow,'' he said in Chicago. ``I
have to win and I will win. But obviously Michigan and Wisconsin
come next.''
   And second place isn't good enough.
   ``A strong second isn't very strong,'' Simon told a reporter. If
he does end up in second place in either delegates or the popular
vote in Illinois, he said, ``I'd have to reevaluate.''
   One poll published Monday in the Chicago Tribune suggested Simon
faces the possibility of a second-place finish.
   The survey, conducted Friday and Saturday, said 32 percent of
likely Democratic voters supported Jackson, 29 percent backed Simon
and 20 percent said they would vote for Dukakis. Rep. Richard
Gephardt of Missouri was the choice of 5 percent and Sen. Albert
Gore Jr. of Tennessee had the backing of 4 percent.
   The poll, conducted by Peter Hart Research Associates,
interviewed 500 people and had a potential margin of error of 5
percentage points.
   An ABC News-Washington Post poll, conducted Saturday and Sunday
and published Monday in the newspaper, gave Simon the lead with 39
percent support to Jackson's 34 percent among very likely
Democratic voters. Dukakis had 17 percent with Gore and Gephardt
far behind. The potential sampling error was plus or minus 6
percentage points.
   Going into the Illinois primary, Dukakis held the lead in the
Associated Press delegate count, with 463 to 424 for Jackson. Gore
had 353 and Simon just 36.
   A total of 173 delegates are at stake on the Democratic side in
Illinois.
   One Dukakis goal is to win some of those delegates, a difficult
task given the complicated nature of the state's ballot. Voters not
only cast ballots for presidential candidates, they also vote
directly for delegate candidates. Thus, a vote for Dukakis in the
``beauty contest'' portion does not necessarily mean a vote for him
in the delegate selection process.
   Another goal, Dukakis aides said privately, is to narrow the
Democratic field. Mentioning the polls showing Dukakis drawing his
last-minute support from Simon's voters, the governor's aides said
they would be delighted to see Jackson beat Simon, believing it
would drive the senator from the race.

   Jack Roland Murphy was always successful: a
violin player with the Pittsburgh Symphony, a tennis star in
college, onetime national surfing champion.
   Later, he became famous as Murph the Surf: playboy, jewel thief,
murderer. Now, Murphy calls himself a ``frontline Christian
soldier,'' an ex-convict who has ``dedicated the rest of my life to
the Lord.''
   ``I've got what they call chain-gang religion, jailhouse
religion, and it's easy for people to scoff at it,'' Murphy said
during a recent interview at The Bridge, a prison work-release
facility in Orlando.
   Murphy, 50, said he has traveled more than 100,000 miles to
counsel prisoners and has given his Christian testimony at hundreds
of schools and churches.
   He was paroled in November 1986 after 19 years in Florida
prisons. One of the conditions of his release was that he spend his
time helping others by preaching and teaching.
   Many are watching and judging, he knows.
   They remember that it was Murphy who stole the Star of India, a
563-carat sapphire, in a spectacular heist from the Museum of
Natural History in New York in 1964, along with a 100-carat ruby
and 20 other gems.
   They remember too that he was convicted of murder in the 1967
slayings of two women whose bludgeoned bodies were found dumped in
Whiskey Creek, a tidal waterway between Miami and Fort Lauderdale.
Prosecutors said the two women were killed over $488,000 worth of
negotiable securities they stole from their employer.
   ``There will always be critics or skeptics who don't believe in
born-again experiences,'' Murphy said. ``But I guarantee it happens
and has happened to me.''
   Those he works with believe in him and his work.
   ``His goal is to help prisoners come to Christ,'' said the Rev.
George Crossley. ``He wants to help fight crime and wage war on
drugs. I believe churchgoers should support Jack Murphy's
ministry.''
   Vernon Rainwater, head of Central Florida's Youth for Christ,
echoes Crossley's statements.
   ``I've heard nothing but real good reports on Jack Murphy since
he has been paroled,'' Rainwater said. ``He has been a good
representative of the Christian community.''
   Murphy said he is just starting.
   ``I have a number of mentors who have been down the road before.
Good Christians. Prison chaplains. People who care about people.
   ``Jesus told us to represent him in Jerusalem. My Jerusalem is
in the jails. . . The jails are the places I least want to be. But
it's there I believe God wants me to be. It is where he allowed me
to grow up.''
   Murphy married Catherine Collins, who visited him in prison for
12 years, last December. She frequently travels with him on
speaking engagements. He is sometimes paid by groups that ask him
to speak. Other income comes from the sale of paintings he did
while in prison.
   ``I don't have wealth. I don't have material things. I go from
month to month, but God provides,'' he said. ``I never could have
imagined the peace, quality and joy of such a life.''
   To those who doubt or scoff, Murphy said, ``If you don't believe
me, just watch me.''

   Officials of the Soviet Communist Party met Monday
with representatives of the Nicaraguan government and signed an
agreement of cooperation, the Tass news agency reported.
   It did not describe the agreement.
   The report said the Sandinistas stressed their determination to
defend their government against U.S.-backed rebels, known as
Contras, and to seek political settlement of the Central American
conflicts.
   Tass said the Soviets ``declared invariable support for the
struggle of Nicaragua for freedom and independence, its
constructive moves, as well as efforts of the Contadora group and
other Latin American countries aimed at a peaceful settlement of
the conflicts in the region, with strict observance of the right of
any nation to its own social and political choice.''
   The Contadora group was formed in January 1983 by Mexico,
Venezuela, Colombia and Panama at a meeting on Panama's Contadora
Island with the aim of resolving armed conflicts in Central America.
   Tass said the Sandinista delegation met with Anatoly F.
Dobrynin, a secretary of the Communist Party Central Committee and
a former ambassador to the United States, and Karen Brutents,
deputy head of the Central Committee's international department.
   Tass said the Sandinista delegation was led by Bayardo Arce,
deputy coordinator of the ruling Sandinista National Liberation
Front.
   It gave no other details of the meeting.

   Albert Gore Jr., campaigning against long
odds in Illinois' Democratic primary, looked ahead Monday to the
rest of the Northern industrial states and said he would ``compete
everywhere and look for an opportunity to punch through'' with a
victory.
   The Tennessee senator flew around Illinois in a final day of
campaigning before Tuesday's primary, repeatedly describing himself
as the alternative to rivals Michael Dukakis, Paul Simon and Jesse
Jackson. He said he was encouraged about prospects in the state
despite polls showing him stuck in single digits behind the others
in Illinois.
   ``The polls have been wrong quite frequently in this race
because the voters are thinking for themselves,'' Gore said at an
airport news conference in Peoria.
   Gore began his day at a factory gate in Rockford, Ill., where he
stood coatless in a light snowfall and greeted workers during a
shift change before flying to Peoria, Springfield and Champaign.
   Speaking to reporters aboard his chartered airplane, Gore said
that regardless of the Illinois outcome he saw the race for the
Democratic nomination as a battle between himself, Jackson and
Dukakis that would be fought out in industrial states during the
spring.
   ``We've got a whole series of contests between now and June 7,''
Gore said. ``We're going to compete in all of them.''
   Needing a victory to to demonstrate appeal outside his native
South, Gore said he saw ``a number of opportunities for a win,''
naming Connecticut, Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York and Indiana.
   ``We're looking at the primary schedule,'' Gore said. ``We're
going to compete everywhere and look for an opportunity to punch
through.''
   Gore strategist Larry Harrington said the campaign's aim in
Illinois was to be ``in the fray.'' He said the campaign had bought
``a decent or modest amount'' of television airtime in Illinois,
and did not dispute estimates putting the figure in the $200,000 to
$300,000 range over the past week.
   ``I think we're going to do better than people expect here,''
Gore said.
   ``I think there are an awful lot of voters here in Illinois who
want an alternative to the kind of approach offered by Michael
Dukakis and Paul Simon and Jesse Jackson,'' Gore said. ``I offer a
different kind of approach.''
   In Springfield, he said each of those three rivals represents
``the same old formula'' that has led the Democratic Party to lose
four out of the past five presidential elections.
   In Peoria, home of the Caterpillar tractor manufacturing
company, Gore said the Reagan administration ``has not been willing
to use the tools'' available under current trade laws to ensure
fairness by foreign competitors.
   He also said that ``a majority of the problems identified in the
trade deficit are here at home,'' citing massive federal borrowing
and saying there was a need to improve education and economic
policy.
   In Springfield, Gore toured a small homeless shelter and visited
with a mother and her baby who live there, underscoring his call
for more federal assistance to the homeless. He said much of the
increase in homelessness was due to ``slashes'' in housing programs
under the Reagan administration.
   At an American Legion post in Chicago Sunday night and again in
Peoria on Monday, Gore, a Vietnam veteran, faced questions about
men left behind after that war. He drew praise from other Vietnam
veterans when he promised to ``pursue to the ends of this earth''
any remaining leads on such men.
   At the University of Illinois in Champaign, Gore stood before a
Cray super computer and accused the Reagan administration of ``the
starvation of super computing'' through denial of federal support
for civilian computer research.
   He called for more federal money to support development of
computer technology and the linking of super computers _ systems
capable of performing millions of computations in an instant _ into
a nationwide network.
   Pointing to one of the rare super computers, Gore referred to
the confused Democratic presidential race and said: ``If there's a
brokered convention, this is a possibility.''

<HEAD>Dukakis Aims To Pick Up Uncounted Delegates; Jackson Closing In</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jesse Jackson is within striking distance of
leading the Democratic race for national convention delegates, but
Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, the leader in the field, is
planning to pick up delegates from yet uncounted caucuses.
   Jackson, who is favored in some polls to win his home state of
Illinois in Tuesday's primary, could still wind up losing when the
delegate prize is divided.
   Dukakis led the Democratic presidential field with 462.5
delegates, followed by Jackson with 423.55. But Dukakis' campaign
said he stands to gain at least another 100 delegates when caucus
results from Texas, Washington and Minnesota are finally tabulated.
   Meanwhile, Jackson's campaign said that the rules in Illinois do
not favor him in picking up many delegates from his home state.
   ``If we get as high a percentage of delegates as we do the
popular vote that would be a smashing success,'' said Steve Cobble,
who monitors delegate selection for the Jackson campaign.
   Illinois holds a direct-election primary in which slates of
delegates are elected from the ballot. Presidential candidates are
also listed on a ``beauty contest'' section of the ballot, but the
results have no effect on picking the delegates.
   The Jackson campaign does not expect to pick up the nearly 40
delegates needed to overtake Dukakis in the national count, Cobble
said. At stake in Illinois are 173 delegates.
   Two recent polls show favorite sons, Jackson and Illinois Sen.
Paul Simon, neck-and-neck in the contest. In a Chicago Tribune
poll, Jackson edged Simon 32 percent to 29 percent, while Simon
held a slim lead over Jackson _ 39 percent to 34 percent _ in an
ABC News-Washington Post poll.
   But the percentages separating them were within the polls'
potential margins of sampling error.
   Simon, who needs to win in his home state to keep his political
hopes alive, had 35.5 delegates. Sen. Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee
was third behind Dukakis and Jackson with 352.8 delegates, while
Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt was in fourth place with 145
delegates.
   Uncommitted delegates totaled 275.65 delegates.

   Nisrin's mother, two sisters and three
brothers are dead. The 3-year-old and her father, one leg blown
away, are all the family left after 25 missiles fell on this town
in a storm of explosion and fire.
   Nisrin's head was wrapped in blood-stained bandages Monday. Her
father Mohammed Amin, 54, also lay in the Sulaimaniya Hospital in
the northern Kurdistan province, his right leg missing.
   Both were unconscious as neighbors buried the six family members
and nine other people killed by the rain of short-range missiles
Sunday on Darbandikhan. More missiles fell on nearby Halabja.
   The attack marked resumption of the latest round in the ``war of
the cities,'' which took hundreds of lives in the 12 days from its
beginning Feb. 29 until both Iran and Iraq called it off
temporarily last Friday.
   Iraq retaliated for the short-range missiles by launching a
rocket into Tehran like scores of others it had fired into the
Iranian capital since the duel began.
   Reporters were flown to Darbandikhan on a tour organized by the
government to publicize the damage caused by the attacks on
population centers. Thousands of civilians have been killed in the
cities since Iran and Iraq went to war in September 1980.
   Hamad Mustafa, a resident, said the town ``enjoyed two quiet
nights'' before Sunday's barrage. He said the 70,000 people who
live there had no time to run to shelters because the missiles came
suddenly and continued for an hour.
   An army officer pointed to a mountain in the distance and said:
``This is the border.'' He said the Iranians had set up a new
missile position just beyond it.
   Jafer Barazanchi, the regional governor, said a ``mass
evacuation'' of Darbandikhan's population was being considered.
   Mourners demanded revenge, not evacuation. About 10,000 people
marched Monday behind 15 coffins draped in Iraqi flags, chanting
slogans against Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, Iran's revolutionary
patriarch.
   At the cemetery they shouted ``Death to Khomeini!'' and waved a
banner reading: ``Fire more Al Hussein missiles on the criminals in
Iran in revenge for our people.''
   Iraq has given its long-range missiles the name Al Hussein, for
a Shiite Moslem saint, and claims to have developed them itself.
Western military analysts say the missiles are Soviet-made Scud-Bs
with strap-on boosters enabling them to reach Tehran, nearly 300
miles from the border.

<TEXT>
   A study of network evening newscasts from Jan.
1 through Super Tuesday March 8 says Democrat Jesse Jackson got the
best television coverage and Republican Pat Robertson got the most
negative.
   The Center for Media and Public Affairs, a non-partisan study
group, said it studied 532 news items involving the election and
found:
   _Evaluations of every major candidate, based on clearly positive
or negative statements from all sources relating to character, job
performance, campaign performance or issue stands, became more
negative after the New Hampshire primary Feb. 16.
   _Jackson suffered the least. Telecast comments involving him
were favorable 74 percent of the time, compared with 90 percent
this year before New Hampshire. He also nearly tripled his share of
the Democrats' coverage, from 9 percent before New Hampshire to 26
percent in the weeks leading up to Super Tuesday, the big round of
primaries and caucuses.
   _Robertson dropped from 70 percent positive evaluations before
New Hampshire to 33 percent after it. Comments about his prospects
also became more negative.
   _Republican George Bush got his best attention in the week
before the New Hampshire primary _ 66 percent of the comments were
favorable. Since then, his favorable coverage percentage has
dropped to 44 percent.
   The analysts also said there have been four stories on the
campaign horse race for every story on policy issues since the Feb.
8 Iowa caucuses and the issues most frequently mentioned are taxes
and trade.

   The man nominated to head the Economic
Regulatory Administration was asked to leave another government
agency after providing documents to a friend who was seeking a
contract, according to Rep. John Dingell.
   Dingell, D-Mich., chairman of the House Energy and Commerce
Committee, has written Energy Secretary John Herrington asking the
secretary to relieve the nominee in question, Chandler Van Orman,
as acting head of the ERA and that Van Orman ``refrain from
participating in any sensitive matters of any kind.''
   Van Orman was traveling Monday and could not be reached, his
office said. Enegery Department spokesman Doug Elmets said: ``We
support Chandler Van Orman. We feel that he is well qualified and
we plan to stand behind him. We do not feel that there are
unanswered allegations that would prevent him from getting this
job.''
   Dingell earlier asked the Senate Energy Committee to hold up Van
Orman's confirmation until the General Accounting Office could
report on the circumstances of Van Orman's replacement of Marshall
Staunton as head of the Economic Regulatory Administration. The ERA
seeks refunds from overcharges when crude oil was under price
controls.
   Dingell wrote Herrington that the GAO investigation was still
under way, but GAO officials had briefed him that in February 1983,
the head of the Agency for International Development ``asked for
and received Van Orman's resignation.''
   Van Orman, according to Dingell's account, had given documents
to a friend seeking a $450,000 contract to prepare for an
international conference on a new way to cure cholera and related
disorders, oral rehydration therapy.
   The contract was awarded but later terminated ``at some cost to
the government,'' Dingell wrote Herrington.
   A memo on the stationery of the AID general counsel said it did
not appear that Van Orman helped his friend get the contract, and
he had not disclosed any classified information. The memo, which
was obtained by The Associated Press, said the evidence assembled
by the AID inspector general ``does not indicate that any statutory
violation occurred,'' and Van Orman had not disclosed classified
information, but had provided documents on at least one other
occasion.
   AID declined to take further action after Van Orman resigned.
   The AID memo was disclosed in a letter Dingell wrote the GAO
with further questions about Van Orman.
   Van Orman had served as an advance man for trips by Vice
President Bush and President Reagan when he was appointed deputy
ERA administrator in August. He was nominated for the
administrator's job in September, but did not assume the post as
acting administrator until Staunton left in December.

<HEAD>Paraguay Would Extradite Argentine Couple Accused of Child Kidnap</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ASUNCION, Paraguay (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Court of Appeals upheld a lower
court ruling Monday to extradite to Argentina a former major and
his wife accused of kidnapping two children born to mothers held
during the ``dirty war.''
   The couple's lawyer, Fatima de Bustaller, told reporters he will
appeal to the Supreme Court.
   The Roman Catholic radio station Caritas said former Maj. Atilio
Bianco and his wife Nilda Susana Wehrli face charges filed by the
Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo group of abducting a boy and girl
and falsifying their birth papers during Argentina's ``dirty war''
of 1976-83.
   The children, Carolina, 12, and Pablo, 10, were quoted this
month in the independent daily newspaper Hoy as saying they don't
want to be separated from the major and his wife.
   ``We don't know anything about those supposed parents we have in
Argentina,'' the children were quoted as saying.
   The Grandmothers group says Bianco, a bone doctor at a military
hospital in Buenos Aires, abducted the children shortly after their
birth and falsified the attending physician's signature to make
them appear to be his and his wife's offspring.
   Neighbors say Ms. Wehrli was not pregnant at those times.
   At least 9,000 people suspected of being leftist subversives
were abducted by military and paramilitary agents and vanished
without a trace during what became known as the ``dirty war'' under
military rule in Argentina, officials say. Human rights group say
the number is closer to 30,000.
   The Grandmothers group, an offshoot of the Mothers of the Plaza
de Mayo group that includes relatives who lost loved ones in the
``dirty war,'' says 72 of the 182 children taken from their parents
were recovered.
   According to local reports, Bianco submitted to a blood test in
Asuncion last month to determine if he was the father of the two
children. Results were never announced.
   The cases of two other couples also accused of having fled to
Paraguay with children suspected of having been born to mothers
held in captivity in Argentina are pending, authorities say.
   Raul Alfonsin was elected Argentina's president in 1983, ending
nearly eight years of military rule.

   Julie and Guy Garner's boat
disappeared, but it found its way home the next day.
   As Ms. Garner was listening to her emergency radio Sunday
morning, her ears perked up when she overheard someone on the radio
``call for assistance from a boat named `Tradition.'''
   Seems that ``Tradition,'' the Garners' 36-foot cabin cruiser,
had disappeared the previous evening from a dock in San Francisco
Bay while the couple and friends were having dinner in San
Francisco. They were afraid that vandals had untied the lines and
the boat was heading out to sea.
   As she listened to the radio the next morning, she said, ``The
man aboard was saying something about waking up on the boat and not
knowing how he got on board or where he was.''
   There was another surprise in store for Ms. Garner when she
turned on a scanning device that can pinpoint the boat's position.
   It turned out to be in the ocean right near their beachside Daly
City home, about 10 miles from where it was docked when it
disappeared.
   ``We looked out and saw our boat sailing about a mile out,'' she
said.
   The Coast Guard dispatched a crew, which intercepted the boat.
San Francisco police Sgt. Jerry Senkir said Edward Thomas James,
26, was taken into custody for investigation of grand theft.

   Residents of this village, settled 131
years ago by Irish homesteaders, celebrated St. Patrick's Day a bit
early with their decidedly un-Irish tradition: toilet bowl racing.
   To the cheers of 100 onlookers Sunday, two-time champion Darrell
Knish downed a cup of beer and jumped on a bowl perched on plywood
and bicycle tires.
   Teammates whisked him down the block toward a second beer
sitting on the snow-covered pavement, which he chugged before
racing back up the hill ahead of a competitor.
   His trophy? A toilet seat cover with the names of the winning
team members scrawled on the back.
   Kilkenny, population 180, swelled by several hundred Sunday as
locals and visitors sprayed their hair green, painted shamrocks on
buildings, and gulped homemade mulligan stew and beer.
   ``If you're going to pick a town to go to, this is it,'' said
Kevin Taaffe of Richfield, who has come to the last four St.
Patrick's Day celebrations in Kilkenny.
   ``If you don't know anybody, you'll know them before you leave
town,'' said Gene Mach, son of the mayor.
   Dana Begley, 36, was quick to learn that. She passed through the
town a while ago on a trip and liked it so much that she and her
children moved here from southern California.
   Kilkenny was all-Irish at its founding in 1857, but mobility and
marriage have gradually reduced the ranks.
   ``There are a few around here who are 100 percent Irish, but not
many,'' said Ann Sheridan, 62, one of the 100 percenters. ``But
even if the people aren't Irish, on St. Patrick's Day, they're all
Irish.''
   As put by Donald Kewatt, tapping his foot to the beat in the
Lions Den: ``I'm German, but I help 'em celebrate.''

   The sentencing of former presidential aide Lyn
Nofziger was postponed Monday from March 25 until April 8 to give
defense lawyers more time to study a report being prepared by the
federal probation office.
   U.S. District Judge Thomas A. Flannery granted the defense

   Nofziger, who was White House political director from 1981 until

   An Asian businessman identified as the Drug
Enforcement Agency's No. 1 heroin target has been arrested and
charged with importing 1,000 pounds of heroin from Southeast Asia
over three years, authorities said Monday.
   The drug ring run by Kon Yu-Leung Kon was much larger than those
in such well-known heroin smuggling cases as the French Connection
or the Pizza Connection, said Robert Stutman, head of the DEA's New
York office.
   The French Connection involved 70 pounds of heroin, the Pizza
Connection about 200, he said.
   Heroin trafficking ``is now controlled by Chinese ethnic groups
that are bringing in vast amounts to the United States, in amounts
far more than any of us who have been professionals in the field
ever thought possible,'' Stutman said.
   U.S. Attorney Andrew Maloney said federal authorities lured Kon
to New York, where he was arrested Sunday night in front of the New
York Hilton Hotel. The 44-year-old Kon was charged under an
indictment handed up in December.
   Maloney refused to give details of the arrest.
   Stutman said that although Kon is charged with importing 1,000
pounds of heroin, it is believed he is responsible for bringing in
twice that amount.
   The heroin was smuggled into the country from 1984 to 1987
through various means, including suitcases and shipments of vases,
ice buckets, T-shirts and wall plaques, said Maloney.
   Couriers then carried millions of dollars in proceeds back to
Hong Kong to be laundered, authorities said. Kon allegedly used $20
million to buy commercial real estate in the New York area and San
Francisco.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Catherine Palmer said Kon, who was born
in China and later moved to Hong Kong, had numerous businesses in
Asia and the United States, including several fur companies.
   Kon had eluded arrest by becoming ``an international gypsy'' and
moving between Thailand, Taiwan, Japan and Manila, Maloney said.
Kon had at least six phony passports, Palmer said.
   Authorities confiscated 570 pounds of heroin alleged to have
been imported by Kon's organization in several seizures over the
years, Stutman said.
   Authorities also arrested John Routollo, a former New York City
police officer, at his Mountclair, N.J., home Sunday night.
   Routollo, 50, was allegedly responsible for picking up the
heroin in New York, usually at the Hilton, for distribution in the
United States. He gathered the drug money and arranged its return
to Hong Kong, according to authorities.
   Routollo worked with Kon before leaving the force in 1981,
authorities said. Maloney said Routollo supplied weapons to Kon's
organization through his position in the Police Department's office
of pistols and licenses.

   The Army went public on Monday with a
classified program to improve the armor on its main battle tank,
announcing that it was starting to build the M-1A1 Abrams with
depleted uranium in the armor plating.
   A Defense Department official who requested anonymity said Army
officials were convinced the new uranium-laced plates were so much
stronger than conventional steel that they could stop all types of
ammunition used by Soviet tank guns.
   The Army insisted that the depleted uranium would pose no threat
to either the soldiers who operated the tanks or to the production
workers who built them because of the manner in which the tanks
would be fabricated.
   ``The armor design modification to the M-1A1 incorporates
steel-encased depleted uranium,'' the Army said in a statement.
``Sealed within the tank, depleted uranium has a very low level of
natural radiation, which is well within the acceptable range
established by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.''
   The service said it had begun on Monday briefing the roughly
5,000 production workers who assemble the tanks about the new
modifications. The Abrams is made for the Army by the General
Dynamics Corp. at two plants _ in Lima, Ohio, and Detroit, Mich.
   While attempting to alleviate fears about radiation, the Army
made clear that it attached a high priority to building the new
version of the M-1A1. Production is starting immediately, the
service said, and the new armor ``represents a significant
enhancement of U.S. conventional defense capabilities.''
   ``This improvement culminates several years of research and
development to meet recent and continuing improvements in Warsaw
Pact anti-armor weapons and will allow the Abrams to meet the
anticipated threat well into the 1990s,'' the Army said.
   Maj. Phil Soucy, an Army spokesman, said the new armor plating
now going into production would begin showing up on the tank
manufacturing lines early this summer. The first completed tank
with the new armor should be delivered in October, the spokesman
added.
   Soucy declined to say where the armor plating was being produced
or to discuss the extent to which conventional armor plates are
strengthened by incorporating depleted uranium.
   Depleted uranium is an inert, heavy metal that is unusually
dense. The term ``depleted'' means the uranium does not have
sufficient energy to be used for commercial purposes such as in a
power plant. The Navy, Air Force and Army are already using
depleted uranium to fashion certain types of ammunition.
   In the case of the M-1A1, the Army refused to say how much
uranium would be incorporated into each tank; where on the tank
body the armor with uranium would be located, or how it would
produce the new armor.
   Service officials who asked not to be named, however, said the
new process involved ``weaving'' a thread mesh of uranium into the
regular steel armor plating at the time of casting.
   ``While depleted uranium has a low level of natural radiation,
our tests have confirmed that this material _ as installed in the
Abrams _ will involve no appreciable health threat,'' the Army said.
   ``You would receive less radiation sitting on the surface of the
tank than you would receive when flying during a trans-Atlantic
flight. Because of this low exposure, no special precautions are
required when near the tank.''
   The Army has already acquired about 1,500 M-1A1's and they will
not be retrofitted with the new armor, the service said. But the
remaining 3,000 tanks scheduled for purchase will incorporate the
new armor, the Army added.
   ``The majority of the improved tanks will be stationed in Europe
where they can most directly contribute to NATO defenses,'' the
service said. The first should arrive ``late this year.''

<HEAD>Senators To House: Drop Gephardt Trade Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senate negotiators on Monday called on their
House counterparts to drop Democratic presidential hopeful Richard
A. Gephardt's heavily debated amendment from their sweeping trade
bill.
   ``We decided to stick with our own Super 301 plan and to oppose
the Gephardt amendment,'' Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen,
D-Texas, said as he emerged from a meeting of Senate conference
committee members.
   The move, which came on a voice vote in the closed-door meeting,
could set the stage for the gradual erasure of the Gephardt
amendment if the House presents a compromise counteroffer to the
Senate that makes a substantial change in the wording.
   However, Gephardt spokesman Mark Johnson said that the Senate's
action represents ``nothing new.''
   ``We've known the Senate's bargaining position for eight
months,'' he said. ``It in no way reflects a decision by the
conference committee. It's merely an opening bargaining position.
We're confident that whatever emerges from conference will be new,
forceful legislation to open foreign markets. And clearly the
Gephardt amendment paved the way.''
   Gephardt's plan would require negotiations to reduce Japanese
and other nations' ``excess and unwarranted'' trade surpluses with
the United States. If that failed, it would prescribe presidential
action to cut the surpluses by 10 percent a year.
   Such a move could include tariffs or import quotas on Japanese
goods imported into the United States. But the president could
refuse to act, either to uphold ``national economic security'' or
if the other country were wrestling with a serious international
debt problem.
   The Reagan administration has criticized the Gephardt plan as
being likely to hurt consumers, cost more jobs than it would save
and invite retaliation against U.S. exports.
   The administration also has been critical of the ``Super 301''
provision that the Senate is pushing.
   ``Super 301,'' named for the section of the Trade Act calling
for retaliation against overseas barriers to U.S. exports, would
require the president to act to eliminate all of the unfair foreign
trade barriers listed on an inventory to be drawn up by the U.S.
trade representative.
   The Senate's offer was not immediately sent to the House.
   Instead, the senators planned to return to the bargaining table
on Tuesday and fashion additional provisions involving steps to
combat ``dumping,'' or selling foreign-made products in world
markets at prices lower than those in home markets.
   They also planned to work on provisions involving countervailing
duties, or tariffs that are imposed to offset the price advantage
that some foreign-mad products get from export subsidies in their
home countries.
   The senators also eased some of the provisions in the portion of
their 1,000-page bill calling for retaliation against foreign
unfair trade practices.
   They moved to expand from seven months to 12 months the time for
the president to make a determination as to whether a foreign trade
practice should be considered unfair. And they acted to remove some
of the specific reasons for retaliation from the bill itself and
put them instead in a report that will accompany the legislation.

   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev
said Monday that ethnic minorities stirring unrest in his vast
country are raising old grievances but not challenging the
authority of the Communist government.
   Soon after arriving on Monday in Yugoslavia, which has a long
history of its own nationality problems, Gorbachev was asked about
recent demonstrations and ethnic riots in the southern Soviet
republics.
   ``Show me the country in which there are no such problems,'' the
Communist Party chief replied. ``If you show me, I will travel
there right away, without stopping in Moscow on return from
Yugoslavia.''
   Gorbachev, who is on a five-day visit, is the first Soviet
leader to visit Yugoslavia since the death of President Josip Broz
Tito in May 1980.
   Referring to recent demonstrations in Yerevan, capital of Soviet
Armenia, and rioting in neighboring Azerbaijan between ethnic
Azerbaijanis and Armenians that left more than 30 people dead,
Gorbachev said the problems had been brewing for a long time.
   He acknowledged some tensions between ethnic groups have been
neglected in his nation of more than 100 nationalities, but said
the protesters were not questioning socialist rule or ``challenging
our political line.''
   The remarks were his first personal comments on the situation in
the Soviet south, although a statement in his name was read to
Yerevan demonstrators.
   Gorbachev plans to visit Slovenia, Yugoslavia's northernmost
republic, and the Croatian city of Dubrovnik.
   Missing from his itinerary is Kosovo, which is beset by strife
between the Albanian majority and Slavic minority.
   Late Monday, after touring memorials and monuments, Gorbachev
began talks with President Lazar Mojsov and Bosko Krunic, head of
Yugoslavia's party.
   Yugoslavia's assistant foreign minister, Ilija Djukic, briefed
reporters later. He said national minorities were not raised as a
separate topic, but that in a general discussion on social
developments, Gorbachev stressed the difficulty of resolving ethnic
problems.
   Djukic quoted Gorbachev as saying, ``There are no problems that
could be solved once and for all, that conditions change, that
everything requires improvement.''
   Gorbachev and his wife, Raisa, set an informal pace Monday as
they took their first look at a Communist country that has
implemented some of the economic reforms Gorbachev proposes _ but
with mixed results.
   The Soviet leader made an unscheduled stop in a busy downtown
square and left his armored limousine to shake hands and chat with
pedestrians. A witness said he picked up a child and gave it a kiss.
   Mrs. Gorbachev tried to take a walk through downtown Belgrade
but was nearly overwhelmed by several hundred people pressing for a
closer look.
   The Gorbachevs placed a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown
Soldier atop Mount Avala, just outside Belgrade.
   On the way down the mountain, their limousine made an
unannounced stop at a monument in the shape of a broken airplane
wing that marks the site of a Soviet air disaster. On Oct. 19,
1964, a plane carrying former Soviet soldiers who helped liberate
Belgrade 20 years earlier crashed there, killing all aboard.
   The Gorbachevs left two small bouquets.
   At one point, a reporter asked Gorbachev if there was progress
at the Geneva talks on the Afghan conflict. With a smile, he said
``There is,'' and ``There will be,'' but did not elaborate.
   He has pledged to withdraw all Soviet troops from Afghanistan _
estimated at 115,000 _ in less than a year if the Geneva talks
produce a settlement.
   Gorbachev said he came to Belgrade to give ``new impulses'' to
the friendly relationship between the countries.
   Yugoslav officials have said a principal topic of discussion
will be Yugoslavia's economic system of ``self-managed, market
socialism.''
   It also allows for private initiative along lines similar to
cooperative enterprises that have sprung up in the Soviet Union
under new laws.
   The Yugoslav system was developed by Tito, who broke with the
Kremlin in 1948 on ideological grounds and pursued his own
communist course. While maintaining relations with the Soviet
Union, he was a founder of the non-aligned movement and developed
ties with the West.
   Yugoslavia enjoyed a long economic boom, but has encountered
hard times in recent years.
   Today, the government and party are struggling with annual
inflation of 170 percent, 15 percent unemployment and a $20 billion
debt to Western creditors.
   Gorbachev is trying to end stagnation in the Soviet economy by
encouraging more accountability by management and more local
control of production.
   Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vadim Loginov told reporters the
Soviets are studying Yugoslav economic reforms.

   Charles E. ``Buddy'' Roemer III, a
self-styled reformer who toppled a political legend, was
inaugurated governor Monday and challenged the people of Louisiana
to help him ``clean up our politics.''
   The 44-year-old Democrat, who won a runoff concession from Gov.
Edwin Edwards on Oct. 24, took the oath of office from former Sen.
Russell Long, the son of legendary Gov. Huey Long, shortly after
noon on the Capitol steps.
   He takes office amid fiscal crisis, with an accumulated budget
deficit and cash shortfall of as much as $1.2 billion, much of it
due to the oil patch depression.
   ``Do we have the character to clean up our politics, to free our
political leadership from the stranglehold of the special
interests?'' asked the former four-term congressman. ``From the
governor's mansion to the Pardon Board, from the Legislature to the
local government, I say we do.''
   ``I will lead, but I need you to pick me up when I fall,'' said
Roemer, Louisiana's 51st governor. ``I need you to stand beside me
when the special interests attack.''
   Edwards, who served as governor from 1972 to 1980 and returned
for a third term in 1984, was occupied for much of his last
administration defending himself successfully against federal
racketeering charges.
   Roemer, during an inaugural address to some 5,000 people, did
not cite the usual litany of Louisiana's problems, including high
unemployment, teen pregnancies, high school dropouts and
nearly-empty state coffers.
   Roemer was interrupted frequently by applause, Edwards included.
   ``I'm going hunting tomorrow,'' Edwards told reporters. ``It's
his now.''
   The state's unemployment rate hit 12 percent in January, one of
the highest in the nation, due primarily to the long downturn in
the oil and gas industry.
   Louisiana's schools are under challenge, business interests are
demanding an overhaul of the tax system to attract industry and
environmental groups are calling for tougher regulations to protect
the air and water.
   Roemer campaigned on calls for major reforms in those areas and
others, including campaign financing. He said recently that the
challenge is unlike that facing any other Louisiana governor.
   ``I've got to do both to get us out of debt and build _
education development, economic development, better environment.
It's going to be a difficult and interesting job,'' Roemer said.
   As solutions for the state's budget problems, Edwards had
proposed a statewide lottery and casino gambling in New Orleans.
Roemer is opposed to both.
   ``We are not going to raise taxes or change taxes until we cut
this budget,'' said Roemer. ``It is out of control.''
   Even before his inauguration, Roemer won two key victories in
the Legislature as his candidates for House speaker and Senate
president were elected during organizational meetings by lawmakers.
   Roemer said earlier that a change in the legislative leadership
was needed to give his ambitious programs a fair hearing by
lawmakers.
   Before Roemer was sworn in, Lt. Gov. Paul Hardy, a Republican,
took the oath from former Gov. Dave Treen. Hardy defeated Lt. Gov.
Bobby Freeman in a runoff last fall. Other top state officials, all
Democrats, also were sworn.
   Roemer, his wife, three children and his parents started
inauguration day with a worship service at the First United
Methodist Church.

   The Supreme Court by a vote of 7-2 refused
Monday to postpone the execution of Wayne R. Felde, who was due to
be executed in Louisiana Tuesday.
   Justices Thurgood Marshall and William J. Brennan, who oppose
capital punishment in all circumstances, voted to grant the stay.
   At the same time, the court refused Felde's request for formal
consideration of his appeal.
   Felde's claimed he was denied competent representation at his
1980 trial on charges of killing a police officer because his
attorney joined him in asking for the death sentence.
   Felde had claimed his experiences in the Vietnam War left him
subject to flashbacks and unable to tell right from wrong. He
described himself as a walking time bomb who would have to be
executed to prevent further killings.

<HEAD>Young Anti-Drug Lawyer Wins Bogota Mayoral Election</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A young lawyer who is the son of a
former president and was kidnapped for campaigning against drugs
has won the Bogota mayor's office in the first mayoral elections in
Colombian history.
   Security for Sunday's voting was tight throughout Colombia,
where violence by extremist political factions and powerful
narcotics traffickers is common.
   An alleged leader of the biggest drug organization even tried to
run for city council in the town of Armenia, but Carlos Lehder
Rivas failed because Colombian law demands that candidates register
in person. Lehder is in jail in Jacksonville, Fla., facing drug
charges there and in Miami.
   Andres Pastrana, 34, son of former President Misael Pastrana,
won the mayoralty election in Bogota and will be one of the
youngest men to hold the office, which often has been a stepping
stone to the presidency.
   Pastrana is a rising star in the Conservative Party and his
election was a setback for President Virgilio Barco's governing
Liberals.
   He was the only Conservative running for mayor in Bogota, but
feuding factions in the Liberal Party ran a total of three
candidates. Pastrana got 324,801 votes and Juan Caicedo, Liberal
former president of the Colombian Association of Businessmen,
finished second with 236,212.
   Voters heeded Barco's call to fight bullets with ballots in the
first election of mayors. For 169 years the president, always from
either the Liberal or Conservative parties, had appointed governors
who in turn chose the mayors.
   Colombians elected 1,008 mayors Sunday. They also chose city
councils, state legislatures and governing bodies for remote
territories with too few people to become states.
   By late Sunday night the elections office said the Liberal Party
had won 405 of the races for mayor, Conservatives 379 and the
leftist Patriotic Union 13. Coalition candidates representing
several parties won 104 of the mayoral contests, the elections
office said. Results were not yet in from remote areas.
   Barco said in a speech televised Saturday night that voting
would be a way to reject the violence. More than 1,700 people were
killed in the past year in fighting between leftist guerrillas and
government security forces and by right-wing death squads and drug
traffickers.
   On Sunday, soldiers and police guarded voting places and
patrolled cities and towns. The election campaign was one of the
bloodiest ever in Colombia, with leftist guerrillas and right-wing
death squads killing five mayoral candidates and 19 city council
candidates. Hundreds of other political activists were slain.
   Leftist guerrillas kidnapped 14 mayors in the two weeks before
the election, then freed them after telling each to do more for the
poor.
   Pastrana, who called for stronger action against the
multibillion-dollar cocaine and marijuana trade, was kidnapped by
drug traffickers in January. A week later, police acting on a tip
raided a farmhouse where he was held and rescued him unharmed.
   One group, the Medellin Cartel, is said to be responsible for 80
percent of the cocaine smuggled into the United States. Lehder is
charged in Miami with being one of its leaders.

<HEAD>PLO Observer Says He Will Refuse to Close Mission</HEAD>

<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Palestine Liberation Organization
observer said Monday he will defy Washington's decision to shut the
PLO mission to the United Nations, and U.S. officials said they
would not try to close it immediately.
   Zehdi Labib Terzi said American authorities would have to ``put
me behind steel bars'' if they wanted to close the mission, which
is in a New York City townhouse.
   ``We have the right to stay here and we will stay where we
are,'' he told a news conference, and added that if the mission is
closed the United Nations should exclude Israel from debates on the
Middle East.
   Last Friday, Attorney General Edwin Meese III said he would have
to close the PLO observer mission as required by a new
anti-terrorist law.
   U.N. officials said Monday another session of the 159-member
General Assembly was possible this week in an effort to retaliate
or thwart U.S. plans. The PLO mission was established 13 years ago.
   U.S. officials said they would not physically close it by March
21, as stipulated in the law, but would let legal proceedings run
their course.
   The legal situation was confused. Terzi said he opposes PLO
action in U.S. courts because the dispute is between the United
States and United Nations.
   ``Unless I am dragged, I see no reason why I should appear in a
U.S. court,'' he told reporters. Terzi added, however, that a U.S.
citizen might sue in an American court to keep the mission open and
protect constitutional rights of free speech and association.
   The United Nations recognizes the PLO as the sole legitimate
representative of the Palestinian people and it has non-voting
observer status. Its representatives have the right to address
every U.N. debate on the Middle East.
   The United States considers the PLO a terrorist organization.
   If the mission is forced to close and the PLO message cannot be
heard, Terzi said, the General Assembly should decide ``in a sense
of fairness and justice'' to exclude Israel from Middle East
debates.
   The United Nations and U.S. State Department have said the
decision to close the mission violates the international U.N.
Headquarters Treaty under which the United States allows U.N.
missions to operate.
   At a three-day emergency session Feb. 29-March 2, the General
Assembly condemned U.S. plans to close the mission, asked the World
Court to rule on arbitration and urged the United States to abide
by the Headquarters Treaty.
   It passed the resolution of condemnation overwhelmingly, with
the United States not participating, and decided to reconvene
before March 21 to decide what to do if Washington decided to press
ahead with closing the mission.
   General Assembly resolutions carry moral weight as expressions
of world opinion but are not binding, as are those of the Security
Council.

   Many roads in mountainous western
Austria remained impassable because of snow or avalanches Monday,
leaving thousands of tourists trapped at ski resorts.
   In Tyrol province, 10 people died under avalanches last weekend.
Forestry experts and mountain rescue officials predicted new slides
of wet snow this week.
   Traffic chaos in the area eased a bit. Parts of westernmost
Vorarlberg province remained isolated, however, and tourists were
stranded at the resorts of Lech, Zuers and Stuben and in the Kleine
Walsertal valley along the border with West Germany.
   Among those isolated by the masses of snow were former Queen
Juliana of the Netherlands and her husband, Prince Bernhard, who
are staying in a hotel at Lech am Arlberg.
   The royal guests had planned to leave last Saturday. A
helicopter flight out of Lech also had to be canceled because of
bad weather.
   Snowfalls resumed at noon in western Austria and supply flights
to isolated towns and villages were impossible. Local officials
said there was no lack of food because emergency supplies had been
stored.
   Snow removal and cleanup operations continued at St. Anton, the
tourist resort in western Tyrol hit by avalanche disasters. Five
Swedish vacationers and two local women were killed by two huge
avalanches early Sunday. Damage was estimated in the millions of
dollars.
   Experts said wet snow does not settle down unless the ground is
frozen. They said recent mild weather, coupled with rising
temperatures predicted for Tuesday and Wednesday, is bound to
increase avalanche danger.
   In St. Anton, at least 14 houses, including hotels and
guesthouses, were wholly or partially destroyed by avalanches.
   Work teams cleared snow from the approaches of the Arlberg
tunnel, allowing trains to travel to Vorarlberg province.
   In Salzburg province, the main westward rail line was closed for
most of Monday because of acute avalanche danger. Long-distance
trains were diverted through Regensburg, West Germany.

   Iran and Iraq shot missiles at each
other's most heavily populated cities and pounded border towns with
renewed intensity Monday after a weekend truce. Scores of civilians
were killed and wounded.
   In a resumption of the ``war of the cities,'' Iraq reported it
fired eight surface-to-surface missiles into Iran's capital of
Tehran, the last one at 11:27 p.m., and Iran said its forces shot
two missiles at Baghdad, the Iraqi capital.
   The Iraqis, declaring an all-out offensive on Iranian cities,
also launched air raids on ``military and economic targets'' in
Dezful, Kermanshah, Shushtar and three other border towns, scoring
what it said were ``destructive hits.''
   Iraqi communiques said the air raids were carried out in a
40-minute period, with all planes returning safely.
   Iraq also claimed its helicopter gunships downed an Iranian
helicopter.
   Iran, meanwhile, claimed its Revolutionary Guards and
Iranian-backed Kurdish guerrillas have killed or wounded 1,900
Iraqis during ground assaults that began Sunday in the mountains of
northeast Iraq.
   Tehran Television reported Iran fired nine surface-to-surface
missiles into Umm Qasr, an industrial town near Iraq's southern
border with Kuwait, and said anti-aircraft gunners shot down an
Iraqi fighter-bomber in the northeastern battles.
   The official Iraqi News Agency, monitored in Cyprus, said the
Iraqis fired eight long-range Al Hussein missiles into Tehran
Monday.
   It said the barrage was a reprisal for the shelling of Iraqi
border towns Sunday night in which at least 21 civilians were
killed and 80 wounded.
   Iraq resumed firing on Sunday when it shot a lone ``warning''
missile into Tehran, also in retaliation for the shelling of
civilian areas.
   The exchanges shattered the uneasy two-day truce in the war
against cities that began Friday, bringing a brief respite after a
12-day exchange of missiles, artillery fire and air raids by both
sides.
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency, also monitored in
Cyprus, reported that Iraq's missiles on Monday exploded in
residential sections of the Iranian capital, a city of 6 million,
killing at least 26 civilians and wounding 50.
   The news agency, quoting military communiques, said the Iranians
retaliated by lobbing two missiles at ``military and economic
centers'' in Baghdad.
   The Iraqis reported that only one missile crashed into a
residential area, killing an undisclosed number of civilians.
   The missile exploded as oil and energy chiefs from 20 Arab
countries gathered in Baghdad for a conference on resources.
Officials in Baghdad said some Arab ministers had canceled plans to
attend the session, apparently because of the flare-up in the war.
   Both sides in the 7{-year-old Persian Gulf war vowed to keep
pounding each other cities until the other quits.
   ``Iran will not rest until the blood of our martyrs of Iraqi
missile and air attacks has been avenged,'' said Kamal Kharrazi, a
member of Iran's Supreme Defense Council and head of the War
Information headquarters in Tehran.
   Iraqi News Agency quoted an unidentified military spokesman in
Baghdad as saying that ``Iraq has decided to resume its missile
attacks and air raids on all Iranian cities, not just Tehran ...
because of Iran's new crimes.''
   The Iraqi agency said that heavy Iranian shellfire of the border
cities that began Sunday was continuing Monday, with a ``large
number'' of civilians killed or wounded.
   It said the northern towns of Halabja and Darbandikhan were
badly hit.
   Iraqi communiques said the southern port of Basra, heavily
bombarded by the Iranians in the last 18 months, was hammered by
artillery and short-range missiles, with casualties reported to be
heavy.
   The nearby refinery town of Zubair and other southern towns also
were being shelled, the communiques reported.
   Iraq said it fired 71 missiles into Tehran, the holy city of Qom
and the central city of Isfahan, capital of ancient Persia, between
Feb. 29 and March 11.
   Iran said it shot 27 missiles into Tehran and two into the
northeastern city of Mosul in that period.

   The judge in the case of seven
revolutionaries accused of plotting the overthrow of the government
refused a defense request Monday to let the three women defendants
be tried separately from their husbands.
   Ruling on pretrial motions, U.S. District Judge William Young
also rejected the defendants' request to dismiss the case because
of what they claimed was the vagueness of the sedition statute
under which they were charged.
   However, the judge gave the defense a victory when he indicated
that witnesses who had been hypnotized to help them recall events
related to the case might not be allowed to testify.
   Jury selection was slated to begin Tuesday. The trial is
expected to last up to a year.
   The so-called Ohio 7 face one count each of seditious
conspiracy, racketeering conspiracy and racketeering enterprise.
Each count carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison and
$20,000 in fines.
   The indictment accuses defendants Raymond Luc Levasseur and
Thomas W. Manning of nearly 20 bombings and 10 robberies throughout
the Northeast since 1975 to raise money to finance their radical
political aims.
   Two others, Jaan K. Laaman and Richard C. Williams, allegedly
joined them on later crimes.
   The wives of three defendants _ Patricia H. Gros Levasseur,
Carol A. Manning and Barbara J. Curzi Laaman _ are accused of
harboring their husbands as fugitives, using false identification
and taking part in some bombings.
   Ms. Levasseur's attorney, William Newman, argued Monday that
prosecutors were trying to ``bury the women'' by tying them to the
crimes allegedly committed by their husbands.
   Prosecutors, however, accused the women of taking an equal part
in planning the violent crimes, and Young denied the women's
request for a separate trial.
   Young denied without comment the defendents' motion to dismiss
the case because of what they claimed was the vagueness of the
sedition statute, enacted during the Civil War to punish
Confederate rebels.
   He also denied a motion by the government to add to the
indictment some of the defendants' convictions on bombing, robbery
and other charges. Prosecutors had asked that the convictions be
included to help prove a conspiracy.
   The judge agreed Monday with the defense team's objection to
government witnesses who were hypnotized to help them recall events.
   ``Before that witness takes the stand, before you even call that
witness, you must file a motion detailing explicitly that witness's
pre-hypnotic testimony,'' the judge told prosecutors.
   ``I am not disposed to let any of these witnesses testify to
anything.''
   U.S. Attorney Frank McNamara said after the hearing that two or
three witnesses had been hypnotized. He wouldn't comment on who
they were or their potential importance to the prosecution.

<TEXT>
   New York Gov. Mario Cuomo said Monday that
Jesse Jackson was electable as a Democratic presidential candidate
and ``has done extremely well'' at getting out an appealing message.
   ``Of course he's electable,'' said Cuomo during an inpromptu
news conference following a speech to New York's county officials.
``If the Democrats _ and that's a majority in the country, is it
not? _ if the Democrats say they want Jackson, how can you say he's
not electable?''
   Some political observers have suggested that Jackson could not
win the general election even if he were the Democratic nominee,
saying the country is not ready to elect a black man as president.
   ``His message is appealing,'' Cuomo said of Jackson. ``He's
saying to the people ... that we have many people who have been
left out that we need to educate and house through job training
because we can't make it without them. It's not just a matter of
compassion, it's a matter of common sense.''
   ``It's an important message,'' said the New York governor. ``And
I think people relate to it. I think we need to fashion the most
effective message that the Democrats can put together.''
   Cuomo, who announced more than a year ago that he wouldn't seek
the Democratic presidential nomination, has refused to rule out
accepting a draft for the nomination if there were a deadlocked
national convention.
   The New York governor has refused to endorse Jackson or any of
the other active Democratic candidates.
   Cuomo has said he believes Jackson stands a good chance of
winning New York's important April 19 primary.

<HEAD>NOAA Issues $100,000 In Fines For Illegal Fishing In Bering Sea</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LES BLUMENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration has levied fines totaling $100,000 against three
Japanese firms whose ships were videotaped apparently fishing
illegally in U.S. waters off Alaska in early January.
   The civil fines of $25,000 per vessel involved are the maximum
allowed under U.S. law.
   ``This underscores how seriously we viewed the violations,'' Jim
Brennan, a deputy general counsel for NOAA, said Monday. He said
the Japanese companies can seek an administrative hearing on the
fines if they decide to appeal.
   Northwest congressmen, who had criticized the Reagan
administration's handling of the fishing situation, were pleased
with the fines.
   ``This action should send a powerful message to any fisherman
who is thinking about fishing illegally in our waters,'' said Rep.
Don Bonker, D-Wash.
   Added Rep. John Miller, R-Wash.: ``If these fines make it
dangerous to fish illegally in our waters and if these fines make
it expensive for outlaw fishing vessels if they get caught, then I
am all for them.''
   The fines were based on a review of the videotapes and
depositions taken from commercial fishermen who chartered a plane
and photographed the vessels with their nets down allegedly 38
miles inside the American fishing zone, said Brennan.
   The investigation was conducted by a NOAA lawyer in Juneau,
Alaska, and the fines issued late last week.
   Two of the vessels videotaped are owned and operated by Hamaya
Suisan Co., Ltd., which was fined a total of $50,000, said Brennan.
The other two vessels are owned and operated by Senkon Gyogyo Co.,
Ltd., and Taisei Gyogyo Co., Ltd., Those companies each were fined
$25,000.
   In addition, the owners and operators of two unidentified
fishing vessels that were also videotaped were fined a total of
$100,000. The identification numbers on the vessels were covered at
the time they were photographed.
   Those fines were for illegal fishing and for having their
identifying marks obscured.
   ``We expect we will get the cooperation of the Japanese
government in tracking those vessels,'' said Brennan.
   Brennan also said NOAA was considering denying applications for
permits from the three companies to fish in American waters until
1992.
   Foreign vessels are not currently allowed to fish in the
200-mile U.S. zone off Alaska, but they are allowed to participate
in joint ventures with American firms. Brennan said the denial of
permits would bar the three Japanese firms from participating in
joint ventures.
   American fishermen and the U.S. Coast Guard have suspected for
more than a year that foreign trawlers were slipping into the U.S.
zone under cover of darkness or in stormy weather to fish illegally.
   Ed Wolfe, the State Department's ambassador for oceans and
fisheries, said Monday he was not aware of the NOAA fines and
declined comment.

   A jury Monday found Manson disciple and
would-be presidential assassin Lynette ``Squeaky'' Fromme guilty of
escaping from a federal prison after she told the panel: ``You
don't have any choice.''
   ``I'm guilty as charged, legally, and without remorse morally,
so that's that,'' Fromme, acting as her own lawyer, said in closing
arguments.
   Fromme, 39, a disciple of mass murderer Charles Manson, is
serving a life sentence for a 1975 assassination attempt against
President Ford. She escaped Dec. 23 from the Federal Correctional
Institution at Alderson, W.Va., and was captured about two miles
away on Christmas after a manhunt.
   Fromme called only herself as a witness and carefully followed
Hallanan's instructions that her testimony had to be in the form of
questions and answers, questioning herself on the pronunciation of
her name and cautioning: ``Miss Fromme, you talk too much,'' and
``Wait a minute, you're getting ahead of yourself.''
   The U.S. District Court jury returned its verdict after less
than 10 minutes of deliberation. Judge Elizabeth Hallanan set an
April 28 sentencing date. Fromme faces an additional sentence of up
to five years in prison and a $250,000 fine.
   Fromme has been described as the main member of the ``family''
that congregated around Manson, who is serving a life sentence in
San Quentin prison in California for the 1969 murders of actress
Sharon Tate and eight others.
   She told the jury Monday that she attempted to escape because
``I got word that (Manson) had cancer.
   ``He needs a relative, somebody to check on him,'' she said of
Manson, whom she described as ``my husband, my brother, my father,
my son, the man who's been my friend.''
   She said she decided to escape because ``my access to him is so
limited, I've been feeling helpless for years. If love means
anything at all it means stop feeling helpless ... (and) take
action if necessary.''
   Assistant U.S. Attorney J. Kirk Brandfass called four prison
employees to testify about Fromme's disappearance and her capture.
   Fromme cross-examined each government witness on the population
of the prison, and each of them indicated the institution _ which
has an official capacity of 670 prisoners _ now holds about 1,000,
   In her testimony she told the jury that the overcrowding was one
of the reasons she tried to escape.``The prison has become more and
more crowded, and the institution staff has become more and more
tense,'' she said.
   The judge had twice denied Fromme's request for a no-contest
plea and entered an innocent plea on her behalf.
   Fromme had told Hallanan the case ``doesn't warrant a jury
trial'' and said she was ``willing to accept whatever sentence you
hand down to me.''
   But Fromme failed on Monday to ask for ``bench trial,'' which
would have left the decision in the judge's hands without calling a
jury.
   Ford was unharmed when a Secret Service agent grabbed a
semiautomatic .45-caliber pistol aimed at him by Fromme on Sept. 5,
1975.
   In San Francisco 17 days later, Ford escaped injury when Sara
Jane Moore, 45, fired a revolver at him. She eventually pleaded
guilty and received a life sentence.
   In 1979, Moore also escaped from the Alderson prison but was
recaptured hours later about 25 miles away. She is now in a federal
prison in Pleasanton, Calif.

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Activists protesting the Bank of Boston's
investment in a paper mill succeeded in depositing a dead fish in a
safety deposit box despite pleas from bank officials.
   The protesters appeared outside the bank building at noon in
opposition to what they said are toxic hazards at the International
Paper Co. mill in Jay, Maine. Mill workers on strike since last
June have been replaced and in recent weeks, there have beeen three
incidents of gas leaks.
   Members of the National Toxics Campaign and a group from Jay,
Stop Toxics Against Citizens, placed dead fish in safety deposit
boxes in several Bank of Boston branches last week to symbolize
what they said are the fish killed in the Androscoggin River
because of International Paper's alleged toxic dumping.
   Bank of Boston controls 189,000 shares of International Paper
and a bank board member, Donald McHenry, is on the board of
International Paper.
   On Monday, three activists entered the bank as some people
outside chanted ``Bank of Boston, they won't tell, holy mackerel,
what's that smell?''
   As Michael Stein, representing the protesters, Kate O'Connor, a
National Toxics Campaign worker, and Tina McDonald, a Jay resident,
walked to the vault, a coterie of bank security guards scurried
after them, banishing press photographers from the premises.
   One bank official, who declined to give his name, first tried to
dissuade the protesters from placing two fish inside the deposit
box.
   ``I'm just another schlep here,'' he told them. ``I don't know
why you want to do this, but I don't think it's a good idea.''
   Another official, who would only identify himself as ``Ronald
McDonald,'' informed Stein that he would be allowed to place the
two dead fish in his box, but that the bank planned to terminate
his contract immediately thereafter.
   ``We're asking you to surrender the box,'' said the official.
``We don't want you as a customer any more.''
   Stein then desposited the fish and was ushered out of the
building.
   Wayne Taylor, spokesman for the Bank of Boston, said the
protesters' tactics were hypocritical and caused a health issue.
``They're jeopardizing the safety and health of bank employees and
customers,'' he said, arguing that the dead fish could attract
cockroaches.
   Taylor said the bank has been, and will remain, neutral in the
controversy surrounding the paper mill and the strike.
   Members of the United International Paperworkers Union and the
Brotherhood of Firemen and Oilers walked out June 16 in a contract
dispute. International Paper wanted to eliminate 170 jobs and cut
premium pay on Sundays.
   Eight workers were sent to the hospital after being exposed to
hydrogen sulfide on Jan. 28, and a 112,000-gallon chlorine dioxide
leak on Feb. 5 forced nearly 4,000 residents out of their homes and
schools for several hours. A leak on Feb. 14 chlorine gas leak
injured seven people.
   Following protests from residents, Maine Gov. John R. McKernan
Jr. and International Paper chairman John A. Georges agreed on a
full-scale inspection of the plant, at the company's expense, by an
outside consultant selected by the state.
   Bill Greener, spokesman for International Paper in Purchase,
N.Y., said that the Maine Department of Environmental Protection
last week announced they had found no reason to close down the
mill. Greener said the three chemical leaks were ``something to be
avoided'' and said the company is cooperating with efforts to make
the mill as safe as possible. He denied the protesters' claim that
the company engages in toxic dumping.

<TEXT>
   A Cuban official on Monday claimed the United
States paid bribes to win support for its effort to have the U.N.
Human Rights Commission investigate Cuba, the news agency Prensa
Latina reported.
   The Cuban news agency said Assistant Foreign Minister Raul Roa
told the Havana newspaper Granma that some people at the commission
hearings held in Geneva received $50,000 in bribes.
   In the report monitored in Mexico City, Prensa Latina mentioned
no names and gave no further details on the bribe allegation.
   Last week, the 43-nation Human Rights Commission accepted
President Fidel Castro's invitation to send a delegation to Cuba to
investigate allegations of human rights abuses.
   After that action, the United States withdrew a resolution
calling for the U.N. secretary-general to study the human rights
situation in Cuba and report to the commission.
   Roa, who returned to Havana last weekend from Geneva, called the
commission decision ``the most crushing defeat'' the United States
``has suffered in recent years in an international forum,'' Prensa
Latina said.
   Armando Valladares, a former Cuban political prisoner who headed
the U.S. delegation to the Geneva meeting, said last week the
two-year U.S. effort to have the commission examine the human
rights situation in Cuba had forced Castro to invite a delegation
to his country.

<TEXT>
   A theological conservative was elected
president Monday of divided Southeastern Baptist Theological
Seminary and said he will hire as faculty members only those who
accept the Bible as the literal truth.
   A moderate on the seminary's board of trustees warned ``there
will be no peace'' at the 1,009-student school if Drummond makes
good on his commitment to carry out the agenda of the board's
conservative majority.
   Lewis A. Drummond, 61, a professor of evangelism at Southern
Baptist Seminary in Louisville, Ky., takes office April 1 at
Southeastern, the fourth-largest of six Southern Baptist
seminaries. It was founded in 1950.
   Drummond, an associate of evangelist Billy Graham, pledged to
seek peace among the school's factions and said he he would
preserve academic quality and freedom of inquiry at the seminary.
   However, he also said he will implement the agenda of the
conservatives, including hiring as faculty members only those
scholars who hold the ``inerrancy'' view that the Bible is
literally true, even in matters of science and history.
   Theological moderates believe the Scriptures were divinely
inspired but may contain errors by their human authors. The issue
is at the heart of a clash that has divided the nation's biggest
Protestant denomination for several years. There are 14.6 million
Southern Baptists.
   Drummond succeeds Randall Lolley, a moderate who announced his
resignation in the fall after 14 years. Lolley said he could not
carry out what he called the conservatives' plan to ``create a
fundamentalist seminary.'' Four administrators also resigned.
   ``It will be my prayer ... that a fresh wind of spiritual
renewal could sweep the campus, fostering a spirit of love, harmony
and reconciliation and commitment to all that God would accomplish
in and through the institution,'' Drummond said.
   Despite his conservative orientation, Drummond had been
described as perhaps the only candidate acceptable to conservatives
and moderates because of his academic credentials and what
colleagues describe as a tolerant attitude and agreeable
personality.
   The board's vote 21-6 with one abstention to hire Drummond after
nearly 90 minutes of debate.
   ``Dr. Drummond's view of the Bible is one I cannot accept,'' the
Rev. Mark Caldwell, a moderate trustee from Washington, D.C., said
in an interview.
   Caldwell read a statement on behalf of other moderates that
accused the conservatives of trying to ``shift radically the
theological foundation of the school toward fundamentalism . ... We
will not endorse such an erosion of the school's historic
character.''
   Caldwell said a faculty panel that met with Drummond gave
Drummond a less than 50 percent confidence rating. The faculty
raised concerns about his his understanding of the
moderate-conservative rift, his appreciation of the ``broad Baptist
constituency'' and his leadership skills, Caldwell said.
   The Rev. Robert D. Crowley, the conservative trustee chairman
and a Rockville, Md., minister, said Drummond ``brings to this new
job impeccable credentials, an enviable track record and every
qualification we could have wanted for a new president.''
   Richard L. Hester, president of the seminary chapter of the
American Association of University Professors, which has fought the
conservatives, said the faculty would give Drummond a chance to
demonstrate his commitment to academic freedom and excellence.
   ``But we want to make fully clear that if his dream is the same
dream as the trustee majority there will be no peace here,'' Hester
said.
   Drummond has been administrative director of the Billy Graham
Center since 1981 and Billy Graham professor of evangelism at
Southern Seminary since 1973. He also has taught at Spurgeon's
Theological College in London, England.
   At a news conference, Crowley read from Graham's letter of
recommendation in which he described Drummond as ``an ideal
president at Southeastern Seminary.''

<TEXT>
   Troops shut down one of the
biggest produce markets in the West Bank on Monday, turning away 70
trucks of food grown by Arab farmers and tightening the economic
noose on the occupied territories.
   Soldiers also shot and wounded at least 11 Arabs, and a
3-year-old girl was in serious condition after she was hit in the
right eye by a rubber bullet, hospital officials said.
   The army imposed a nightly 10 p.m. to 3 a.m. curfew over the
entire Gaza Strip for the first time since unrest began in the
territories Dec. 8. A spokesman, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the curfew will be in effect indefinitely.
   Israel radio said the curfew was to prevent ``the entrance of
violent instigators ... and of written instigation material'' to
the Gaza Strip where about 600,000 Palestinians live.
   All residents will have to stay home while the army seals off
entrances to Gaza, the radio said.
   The daily Yediot Ahronot meanwhile reported that the Israeli
army will spray rock-hurling protesters with paint from helicopters
so they can be identified and arrested.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir arrived in Washington with what he
said were new ideas for Mideast peace talks.
   Also on Monday, another 150 Arab policemen in Gaza announced
they would resign, joining 450 other officers in the occupied
territories who quit earlier, according to an Arab reporter who
watched many turn in their uniforms.
   Israeli authorities acknowledged some police quit but gave no
figures. About 850 Arab police worked in the occupied territories.
   The resignations were ordered by the Palestine Liberation
Organization two days after the slaying of a Jericho policeman
accused of collaborating with the Israelis.
   ``It is clear their resignations were not handed in freely but
because they fear for their lives,'' Gaza Police commander Shimon
Levy said on Israel radio. In apparent response to the PLO-backed
protests and unrest, Israel stepped up economic sanctions,
including a ban on the shipment of gasoline and other fuel to
service stations in the West Bank.
   Uri Hakak of the Israeli-owned Padesco Co., which supplies fuel
to 50 West Bank gas stations, said drivers were afraid to make
deliveries after two tank trucks were attack and burned.
   In Jericho, 22 miles northeast of Jerusalem, soldiers closed the
regional fruit and vegetable market, turning away 70 trucks
carrying produce, Arab merchants said.
   ``We started to sell about 8 a.m. when the soldiers came and
forced us to close,'' said one merchant who refused to give his
name, saying he was being watched by a collaborator.
   He said Arab farmers tried to open informal markets elsewhere,
but soldiers chased them away.
   PLO leaflets have ordered Jericho shops to open only in the
morning. But on Monday, merchants said troops told them they could
operate only after noon.
   Saeb Erakat, a political science professor from An Najah
University who lives in Jericho, said Israeli authorities wanted to
break the back of the Palestinian strike with economic pressure.
   ``The military government is trying to tell the people here who
is boss. Jericho is an agricultural city. To order the market
closed in the morning amounts to killing it economically,'' Erakat
said.
   At least 91 Arabs have been killed during unrest in the occupied
territories since rioting began, according to United Nations
figures.
   In Jenin and the nearby West Bank village of Yamoun, troops
using live ammunition shot and wounded 11 Arabs.
   Witnesses in Ramallah said troops also shot 3-year-old Rasha
Youssef Said in the eye with a rubber bullet in a clash with
Palestinians protesting alleged harassment by Jewish settlers.
   On the political front, legislators of the right-wing Likud bloc
said they would try to defeat a U.S. peace plan by forming a new
government without the left-of-center Labor Party, led by Foreign
Minister Shimon Peres.
   But Shamir arrived in Washington with what he said were new
proposals for Mideast peace talks. He also said he would not give a
blanket yes-or-no reply to the U.S. peace plan devised by Secretary
of State George P. Shultz.

   A baby born with most of his brain
missing clung to life Monday at a hospital where doctors hoped to
make the doomed infant's organs available for transplant, a
hospital spokeswoman said.
   ``He shows progressive signs of brain stem deterioriation but
has not yet met all the criteria for total brain death,'' said
Anita Rockwell, a spokeswoman for Loma Linda University Medical
Center.
   The boy, identified only as Baby D, was born at an unidentified
Southern California hospital March 10 with a fatal birth defect
known as anencephaly, in which much of the brain and skull are
missing.
   The newborn's other vital organs are healthy, and his parents
asked that their child be considered an organ donor. He was
transferred to Loma Linda.
   Loma Linda has developed the nation's first medical guidelines
for preserving anencephalics' heart and other vital organs for
transplanting into critically ill infants.
   The baby is the fourth brain-absent newborn accepted at Loma
Linda for possible use as an organ donor.
   Under criteria established by the hospital, Baby D was placed on
life-support systems for a seven-day period, which ends Thursday
night.
   If doctors determine that Baby D is brain-dead during that
period, the hospital will serve notice that the organs are
available for transplant.
   If the infant is not declared brain-dead within seven days, Baby
D will be taken off the respirator and will be allowed to die
naturally.
   The guidelines were developed to address ethical questions
surrounding use of doomed anencephalics as organ donors.
   Loma Linda received nationwide attention and criticism in 1984
when Dr. Leonard Bailey transplanted a baboon's heart into a girl
known as Baby Fae. She died 20{ days later.
   Bailey later transplanted infant hearts successfully. However, a
shortage organ donors led Loma Linda to develop its policy on
anencephalic infants.

   Police fired tear gas Monday at
protesters who blocked traffic in the capital and cried, ``Noriega
must go!'' Work stoppages broke out as employees learned they would
not be paid by a government that has run out of money.
   The government began selling sacks of food, called ``dignity
bags,'' to unpaid workers. Some schoolteachers, telephone company
and Panama Canal dock workers demanded cash and struck to reinforce
their demand.
   In Washington, the Pentagon announced it had sent 104 Marines
and Air Force military police to Panama to reinforce U.S. security
units.
   Violence was reported in the port city of Colon at the Caribbean
entrance of the Panama Canal.
   Nicolas Psichoyos, a manager of the Rey supermarket chain, said
two company stores were attacked by gangs demanding free food for
government employees. Five supermarket employees were injured in
fights with the attackers, one of them seriously, Psichoyos said.
   He said the gangs were supporters of Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega, the nation's strongman.
   Protesters in Panama City erected flaming street barricades of
trash. Others yelled at security forces and were met by volleys of
tear gas.
   For the first time, the disturbances reached into the heart of
the capital's business district.
   Riot police used tear gas to disperse about 600 primary and
secondary school teachers blocking traffic in front of the Ministry
of Education. ``We want our pay!'' shouted the teachers. ``Books
yes, arms no!''
   As the police, armed with rubber truncheons and tear gas
grenades, forcibly removed them, the teachers cried: ``Noriega must
go!'' No arrests were reported.
   Primary and secondary schools were to have reopened Monday
following a three-month vacation, but they stayed closed.
   Alberto Williams, a secretary of the Dock Workers Union, said
about 700 employees walked off their jobs at 9 a.m. at the Port of
Balboa, the Pacific Ocean entrance to the Panama Canal, after being
told they would not be paid their semi-monthly salaries.
   ``This strike is not a political movement,'' said Williams, a
forklift operator who makes $5.85 an hour. ``All we want is that
the workers get their money.''
   Alberto Soto, the port administrator, said the strike would have
``absolutely nothing'' to do with traffic through the 50-mile
waterway linking the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans.
   Dock workers also struck at Colon 50 miles north of Panama City.
Colon residents told The Associated Press that in another protest,
teachers temporarily blocked the highway that runs parallel to the
canal.
   The U.S. Defense Department announced that 60 Marines and a
44-man Air Force police unit were flown to Panama Monday. A
Pentagon spokesman, Cmdr. Robert Prucha, said, ``This is simply a
prudent measure to augment the security personnel who are already
in place.''
   U.S. officials in Washington have said President Reagan's
decision to withhold a $6.5 million payment due Panama on Tuesday
was aimed at impairing the Panamanian government's ability to pay
Panama's 130,000 public workers this week.
   Withholding the payment was one of a number of economic
sanctions the United States has imposed to pressure Noriega to step
down as chief of the Defense Forces.
   Nearly one in every five working Panamanians is employed by the
government. Until now, they have supported Noriega, at least
outwardly.
   According to Panamanian figures, their payroll comes to about
$33 million every two weeks. Diplomatic sources and private
economists, speaking on condition of anonymity, say the nation's
treasury is empty.
   The ``dignity bags'' contained such staples of the Panamanian
diet as rice, beans, flour, onions, cheese and lard. They were
being sold for between $15 and $16 but the government apparently
was not demanding immediate payment.
   Horacio Rodriguez, director of the Ministry of Farm and Dairy
Products Marketing, said his agency prepared 12,000 of the bags.
   The nation's new civilian chief executive, Manuel Solis Palma,
Noriega and other top officials resumed an emergency economic
conference Monday morning after recessing an earlier session at 2
a.m. without comment.
   Solis Palma, installed by the military last month, has been
meeting frequently with his chief advisers but Sunday's meeting was
the first time that Noriega had been known to join them.
   Noriega, the power behind the government since 1983, was
indicted by two U.S. federal grand juries last month on charges of
drug trafficking and money laundering.
   About 40 employees outside the state-run telephone company's
main office told reporters they were striking because they had not
been paid.
   ``Nobody has told us anything,'' said one worker, who refused to
identify himself.
   The 118 local and foreign banks in Panama remained closed by
government order for the 10th straight day. Most had closed their
doors earlier because the government was unable to provide them
with the cash to cover a run on deposits.
   The bank run began Feb. 26, the day Noriega engineered the
dismissal of Eric Arturo Delvalle as president. The day before,
Delvalle had tried to fire Noriega. The deposed president has been
in hiding for more than two weeks, but is still recognized by the
United States as Panama's legitimate chief executive.

   A former official in Gov. Evan Mecham's
administration, testifying Monday at the governor's Senate
impeachment trial, accused a key prosecution witness of lying about
an alleged death threat.
   Max Hawkins said the witness, Peggy Griffith, ``really had it in
for Lee Watkins,'' the man Griffith accused of making the threat.
   In a heated round of questioning, Hawkins insisted repeatedly he
did not believe a death threat had been made. ``I thought Peggy
really detested Lee Watkins,'' said Hawkins, former director of the
Department of Administration.
   Asked by Sen. Carolyn Walker whether he was accusing Griffith of
lying, Hawkins said: ``I testified I think she did lie on that.''
   Watkins, former state prison construction chief, has been
accused of threatening Donna Carlson, a former Mecham aide who was
testifying at the time before a grand jury investigating Mecham's
finances.
   Mecham, the first U.S. governor to face an impeachment trial in
six decades, is charged with obstructing an attorney general's
investigation of the alleged threat.
   Other impeachment charges against the first-term Republican
allege he concealed a $350,000 campaign fund and misused $80,000 in
a state fund by loaning it to his auto dealership.
   Mecham has not attended the trial since it began Feb. 29.
   Earlier Monday, Mecham's lawyer, Fred Craft, accused the state
police of intimidating defense witnesses as he moved for a mistrial
or dismissal of charges against Mecham.
   Mecham sent a letter to acting Gov. Rose Mofford asking that
three top state Department of Public Safety officials be placed on
leave. Mecham sugested that federal authorities be called in to
investigate the intimidation claims.
   ``A political trial that is difficult at best is made even more
difficult when witnesses are subject to these kinds of intimidation
and harassment,'' the letter said.
   There was no immediate response from Mrs. Mofford's office to
the letter requesting that she place DPS Director Ralph Milstead
and two other officials on leave.
   Arizona Supreme Court Justice Frank X. Gordon, who is presiding
over the impeachment trial, said he would not rule on Craft's
motion until Tuesday.
   Gordon also spent an hour in chambers with attorneys.
Prosecutors asked for sanctions against Craft for trying the case
in the news media with a weekend news conference, according to Rep.
Henry Evans, a Democrat who is a member of the House prosecution
team.
   Craft held the news conference to protest the arrest Friday of
defense witness Terri Fields on an outstanding warrant. She had
testified the day before.
   DPS arrested Ms. Fields on a January warrant charging that she
failed to attend court-ordered Alcoholics Anonymous meetings
following a driving-while-intoxicated conviction. She was released
on $1,000 bond.
   Ms. Fields testified that a state official who had testified
about the alleged threat tended to exaggerate. Ms. Fields also said
she thought there had been no death threat.
   DPS spokesman Sgt. Allan Schmidt has denied that Ms. Fields'
arrest was an attempt to intimidate impeachment trial witnesses.
   Meanwhile, Hawkins testified Monday that he considered the
alleged death threat ``a culmination of comical errors.''
   ``I saw no crime,'' Hawkins testified. He denied any attempt to
shield Watkins.
   House prosecutor William French, confronting Hawkins with his
own words in a news release, a newspaper interview and a tape
recording of a phone call, suggested Hawkins tried to shief Watkins
and help him pass a lie detector test.
   Hawkins said he was misquoted in the newspaper article and
wasn't sure his phone conversation with Watkins' attorney was
transcribed accurately. He complained bitterly that the
conversation with attorney Dale Anderson was illegal because it was
recorded without his knowledge.
   On the tape, he was quoted as saying: ``I love Lee and I want to
save his ass. I believe he's being railroaded.'' A transcript also
shows Hawkins discussing questions that could help Watkins pass the
polygraph test.
   Outside, some 200 pro-Mecham demonstrators protested Ms. Fields'
arrest. They carried placards denouncing the DPS and the news media
and calling for Mecham's reinstatement as governor.
   A two-thirds vote of the Senate is required to convict Mecham
and remove him from office.
   Mecham contends he has broken no law and is the victim of a
political conspiracy. He also faces an April 21 criminal trial on
felony counts alleging he concealed the $350,000 loan, and a May 17
recall election.

<HEAD>Independent Producers Seek Exemptions From Striking Scriptwriters</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD DE ATLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WEST HOLLYWOOD, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 50 independent TV
production companies, including Johnny Carson's ``Tonight Show,''
appealed to striking scriptwriters for an exemption from the
walkout, a union official said Monday.
   Brian Walton, West Coast executive director of the striking
Writers Guild of America, said the union board would consider the
special requests to allow scriptwriters to return to work at some
companies during the strike.
   The strike by 9,000 Guild members against the 200-member
Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers began March 7.
   Walton declined to identify the productions companies seeking
special, interim agreements, but ``The Tonight Show,'' announced it
was among them.
   About 40 percent of the companies that make shows for television
are wholly independent. Of the rest, about half are considered
independent but are affiliated with a major studio.
   Among shows already rejected for an exemption was the Academy
Awards ceremony, which is scheduled for worldwide broadcast April
11.
   Lobell-Bergman Productions said Monday the strike has affected
development of five of eight movies on its slate and stopped work
on a network comedy series.
   Previously postponed was a revival of ``The Smothers Brothers
Comedy Hour'' and a new series, ``The Dictator,'' starring
Christopher Lloyd.
   A spokesman for the producers belittled the union's assertion
about the number of independents seeking waivers.
   ``With the exception of Carson, I don't know of any other
independent producer looking to make a deal who is also member of
the alliance,'' said Herb Steinberg.
   No new talks were scheduled in strike. The guild is seeking
greater creative control, higher residuals from foreign market
distribution, and no adjustment by producers of residuals for
hour-long syndicated TV shows.

   A former gang member testified
Monday that he agreed to the assassination of Chinese-American
journalist Henry Liu because he believed it was a patriotic act
requested directly by the Taiwanese government.
   Tung Kuei-sen, the former member of a Taiwanese criminal
``Bamboo Gang,'' has pleaded innocent to the 1984 shooting death of
journalist Henry Liu. He faces a sentence of 27 years to life in
prison if convicted of first-degree murder with the use of a
handgun.
   Liu, 52, was killed in the garage of his Daly City home just
south of San Francisco on Oct. 15, 1984. Liu, a columnist for
Chinese-language newspapers in San Francisco, had just finished a
biography critical of Chiang Ching-kuo, Taiwan's president from
1978 until his death of a heart attack in January.
   Tung, 35, has admitted the killing but went to trial because the
prosecution has not offered a plea bargain and because Tung want to
tell his story, said defense attorney Douglas Gray.
   Tung testified in San Mateo County Superior Court that he had
never heard of Liu or his writings until he was driven to San
Francisco the day before the killing.
   Speaking through an intepreter, he said he agreed to act as a
gunman at the request of Chen Chi-li, a reputed United Bamboo gang
leader who told him he received his orders from Taiwan's then chief
of military intelligence, Vice Adm. Weng Hsi-ling.
   ``He asked first of all, `Am I willing to help my country?'''
said Tung. ``I said, `Yes, of course, because this is everyone's
obligation.' And then he showed me he was a member of the
intelligence bureau with the ID card of the intelligence bureau of
the Republic of China.''
   He said Chen told him Liu was a traitor who had become a double
agent for Taiwan and the People's Republic of China.
   Tung said he was recruited by Chen because they both been United
Bamboo members before Tung moved to the United States to set up an
import-export business in August, 1984.
   Two years ago, Tung testified about his role in the Liu killing
while on trial on heroin smuggling charges in New York. He has said
that he wanted to testify in order to apologize and possibly lessen
his sentence. He received 20 years in prison for conspiracy to
smuggle 600 pounds of heroin into the United States.
   Tung described the shooting scene Monday. He said he and Wu Tun
rode up to Liu's home on bicycles, hiding in the garage until Liu
came in. He said Wu Tun shot first. ``I heard a shot and I went
forward and I saw this man fall down. At that time, I believed that
should be the man I should assassinate. I aimed at his tummy and
shot him twice,'' Tung said.
   Tung fled the country and was apprehended in Rio de Janeiro
after stops in Bangkok, the Philippines and Singapore.
   Chen Chi-Li, reputed head of the Bamboo Gang, and Wu Tun were
convicted in a Taipei court and are serving life terms in Taiwan.
The Taiwanese government has refused U.S. attempts to have them
extradited for trial here.
   Weng and two of his aides were convicted and given life
sentences in the case. Chen testified that the admiral and other
high-ranking military officers recruited him to kill Liu.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ The U.S. ambassador personally
notified President Leslie Manigat about the indictment in Miami of
Col. Jean-Claude Paul on narcotics trafficking charges, embassy
spokesman Jeffrey Lite said Monday.
   ``We have formally notified them, but have not yet revealed the
details of the case,'' Lite said. ``They will be passed along when
they're made available.''
   He said Ambassador Brunson McKinley met with Manigat Thursday,
the same day the Miami indictment was unsealed.
   Lite would not say if McKinley discussed the possible
extradition of Paul or recommended any course of action.
   The indictment accuses Paul, along with his brother and ex-wife,
of using a private airstrip to fly a 220-pound cocaine shipment to
the Bahamas for delivery to Miami.
   Paul commands the powerful Dessalines Battalion that backs up
police in this capital city with a population of 1 million.
   The indictment puts Manigat in a precarious situation. The
57-year-old political science professor came to power in a Jan. 17
election that many Haitians boycotted, foreign observers criticized
and rival candidates said was rigged by the army.
   A decision to act against Paul could provoke a coup, and if
Manigat ignores the indictment it could affect U.S. aid vital to
this impoverished Caribbean nation and its 6 million people.
   Manigat issued a statement last week through a Washington public
relations firm calling the incident ``a matter of concern'' that
will be handled in Haiti by military courts.
   Manigat is in a ``horrible situation,'' said a Western diplomat
who spoke with the condition he not be identified.
   ``Paul knows that if he goes (to the United States) he will land
in jail. He's not about to let himself be had,'' the diplomat said.
``The solution would be to bring him to trial locally. But how? Who
would you send to arrest him?'' Anaise Chavenet, a spokeswoman for
the Ministry of Information, said Monday the government has not
been officially notified about the indictment.
   ``The American government has not notified the Haitian
government by letter or through normal diplomatic channels _
through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs _ of the indictment of Col.
Paul,'' she said.
   She added she was not aware of any meeting between Manigat and
McKinley on the indictment.

<HEAD>Gephardt Talks Up Trade Issues As He Heads Into Key Michigan
Contest</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MOUNT CLEMENS, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democratic presidential hopeful Rep.
Richard Gephardt brought his tough trade talk to a bastion of
organized labor Monday night, telling Democrats here that America's
allies must be prepared to accept U.S.-made products.
   For Gephardt, whose campaign stumbled badly on Super Tuesday,
the March 26 Democratic caucuses here are a crucial test. The
Missouri congressman passed up campaigning in Tuesday's Illinois
primary.
   Gephardt told about 300 supporters that in the past, the threat
of tariffs has helped the United States persuade Canada to stop
dumping wood products and the Japanese in dumping microchips on the
U.S. market.
   ``When we finally lose the timidity and stand up for basic
fairness, other countries open up,'' said Gephardt, who has made
trade issues a campaign centerpiece.
   Gephardt drew scattered groans and catcalls from the audience
when he quoted President Reagan as saying the trade deficit was a
sign of strength.
   ``I thought maybe he got his cuecards messed up,'' Gephardt said.
   Even as Gephardt talked up his stance on trade, lawmakers in
Washington moved toward to discard the trade amendment the Missouri
congressman authored.
   Senators are starting to push their House counterparts in
earnest to abandon the provision as conferees from the two houses
try to hammer out a final version of sweeping trade legislation.
   Gephardt spokesman Mark Johnson said the Senate action
represented ``nothing new'' in the trade debate.
   Gephardt planned to remain in Michigan through Wednesday, then
return Friday to continue campaigning in advance of the caucuses.
   Michigan Attorney General Frank Kelley, Gephardt's state
chairman, said the Missouri congressman had between $400,000 and
$500,000 available for a television advertising blitz over the next
11 days.
   ``It's very important that I win in Michigan, and we're going to
win in Michigan,'' Gephardt said after the speech.
   Kelley likened Gephardt's campaign to that of 1948, when another
Missourian, Harry Truman, won an upset victory for the White House.
   ``I predict he's going to surprise a lot of people,'' Kelley
said.
   Earlier Monday, Gephardt talked to more than 300 members of
United Auto Workers Local 569 in Flint, where he repeated his call
to rebuild America's declining industrial base.

<TEXT>
   In 1948, Peter Rodino left his native Italian
neighborhood in Newark, N.J., an eager 38-year-old lawyer ready to
represent the bustling city in Congress.
   Rodino became an institution in the intervening 40 years:
fighting for liberal legislation, controlling one of Congress' most
powerful committees and helping write into history the downfall of
a president.
   On Monday, the 78-year-old congressman announced his plans to
retire after 20 terms.
   In those years, Newark decayed from the heart of the Garden
State into the brunt of jokes. Rodino's political base eroded, too.
His decision not to seek re-election came in the face of mounting
pressure from black political leaders, who claim it's now their
time to represent the vastly changed area.
   Born in 1909, the son of an Italian immigrant toolmaker, Rodino
seemed awed by responsibility when he was placed in charge of the
President Nixon's impeachment proceedings in 1974.
   ``If fate had been looking for one of the powerhouses of
Congress, it wouldn't have picked me,'' he told a reporter then.
   But Rodino's steady, judicious handling of the momentous
hearings earned him widespread praise and helped produce an
overwhelming bipartisan majority in favor of impeachment.
   Rodino said last year he retired to a private office and cried
after his committee approved three articles of impeachment, forcing
Nixon to resign two weeks later.
   More recently, Rodino was again in on the making of history, as
a senior member of the House Iran-Contra committee that
investigated the sale of arms to Iran and the funneling of profits
to the Nicaragua Contra rebels. He had harsh words for what he
called the Reagan administration's lack of concern for the
Constitution.
   He has continually used the Judiciary Committee to press for
civil rights and what he calls ``the rule of law.''
   Little in the early years of Rodino's career suggested he might
climb to the center stage of national political life.
   A child of the Depression, he completed law school in 1937,
after 10 years of night classes. He was later decorated for World
War II Army service in Italy.
   Like many members of Congress, Rodino relied upon service to his
constituents for his electoral success. But he was a strong civil
rights advocate, and that served him well as his once-prosperous
city became predominantly black by the 1970s.
   He spoke proudly of his Italian heritage, and sponsored
legislation that made Columbus Day part of a three-day annual
holiday.
   ``Peter Rodino was an unknown quantity,'' former House Speaker
Thomas P. O'Neill, D-Mass., once recalled. ``He was a flame under a
bushel basket.''
   Nixon's political demise raised Rodino's stock considerably. He
made the cover of national news magazines, starred on the dinner
circuit, and was even interviewed to be Jimmy Carter's running mate
in 1976.
   In December 1980, his wife and high-school sweetheart, Marianna
Stango Rodino, died after suffering for two years from a brain
tumor. Rodino had missed many a House session caring for her. He
received further blows in 1982 and 1983 when he lost his brother,
sister and mother-in-law.
   Rodino focused himself on his work, running for his seat and
winning, despite ever-mounting challenges. Two years ago, he hinted
he would step down as soon as Reagan left office.
   He said then he would concentrate on writing his memoirs.

<TEXT>
   At least 10,000 people marched through La
Paz Monday in a funeral procession for a student who died from a
bullet wound he received during a violent protest.
   Later Monday, about 5,000 workers demonstrated in the capital
against the government's economic policies. At one point, police
threw tear gas canisters to disperse protesters about to throw
rocks at the U.S. Embassy, authorities said.
   The students and faculty were protesting the death of Marco
Antonio Uria, a student at San Andres University in La Paz who died
Saturday morning after being hit by a bullet during a confrontation
between students and police.
   The march was peaceful and no arrests were reported.
   Students said police were responsible for Uria's death, but the
Ministry of the Interior said the bullet was fired by students.
   Friday's protest was organized to demand an increase in the
federal budget for universities. Students threw rocks at police,
overturned vehicles and threw up roadblocks. Police pursued fleeing
students onto the campus.
   A group of students returning from the funeral Monday afternoon
destroyed a booth in downtown La Paz that was selling souvenirs of
the pope's visit to Bolivia in May, witnesses said.
   Later in the afternoon, at least 5,000 workers marched through
La Paz to protest the economic policies of the administration of
President Victor Paz Estenssoro.
   The march, organized by the Bolivian Workers Central, was called
to pressure the government to increase wages, protect the
government social security system and strengthen the public school
system.
   ``The government is obeying the mandates of the International
Monetary Fund and as a result workers are suffering the
consequences with starvation wages,'' said Simon Reyes, executive
of the Workers Central, during a rally that preceded the march.

<TEXT>
   The shackling of former Black Panther
Johnny Spain at his murder trial stemming from a 1971 prison
breakout attempt was justified by the threat of violence, a
prosecutor told an appeals court Monday.
   As the 38-year-old Spain, newly released from prison after 21
years, looked on, Deputy Attorney General Ronald Niver argued that
the judge who presided at the trial ``was confronted with six
violent men'' charged with murder.
   ``It was reasonable for (the judge) to fear for the safety of
those in the courtroom,'' Niver told the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals. ``He tried the best way he knew how to protect the safety
of the spectators.''
   But Spain's lawyer, Dennis Riordan, urged the panel to uphold a
lower-court order granting Spain a new trial on the grounds that
the heavy and painful shackles influenced the jury and deterred
Spain from testifying.
   ``We know that this jury only heard one half the story,''
Riordan said. In five years of court proceedings and a 17-month
trial, Spain wore 25 pounds of chains around his body, arms and
legs.
   The three-judge appeals panel heard more than 90 minutes of
arguments and will rule on whether to reinstate Spain's two murder
convictions.
   One option raised during the hearing was to return the case to a
lower court to find out what Spain would say if he had testified
and whether it could have affected the verdict. Riordan opposed the
suggestion.
   Spain, released on $350,000 bail last week, told reporters after
the hearing that being free was ``an incredible feeling'' and he
wasn't worried about the court sending him back to prison.
   ``I probably won't put a down payment on a home, but I can't
stop living because of that possibility,'' Spain said.
   Spain faces a more immediate threat to his freedom: a vote next
week by the state Board of Prison Terms reconsidering a panel's
decision to parole him from a life term for a 1966 murder-robbery
committed when he was 17.
   In the unrelated trial known as the San Quentin Six case, Spain
was the only prisoner convicted of murder in a 1971 bloodbath that
took the lives of militant leader George Jackson, two other inmates
and three guards.
   Authorities said Spain, who was seen running out of a
maximum-security unit with Jackson, conspired with Jackson in the
escape attempt. Three other prisoners were acquitted, and two were
convicted of assault.
   In his 1986 ruling granting Spain a new trial, U.S. District
Judge Thelton Henderson said Superior Court Judge Henry Broderick
had failed to consider alternatives to the shackling, such as the
warnings used for another of the six defendants.
   But Niver said the appeals court, reviewing the trial years
later, should defer to Broderick's evident conclusion that he had
no safe alternative.
   Circuit Judge Alex Kozinski pressed Niver on whether safety
could have been maintained with less severe measures _ for example,
leaving an arm unchained so Spain could write a note to his lawyer
without pain.
   ``We wouldn't do that to an animal, right?'' Kozinski asked.
   Niver replied that Spain, even while fully manacled, threw a
file folder at the jury and caused other courtroom disruptions. But
Riordan said the disruptions were caused by the pain of the
shackles.

<HEAD>Teachers Strike Across Argentina On First Day Of Classes</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Primary school teachers across
Argentina went on strike Monday demanding higher wages and forcing
cancellation of most classes on the first day of the public school
year.
   Officials said only in northeastern Corrientes province, where a
salary agreement was reached earlier this month, did teachers begin
regular classes for pre-schoolers and youngsters in grades one
through seven.
   More than 450,000 members of the CTERA teachers' union are
demanding a minimum salary of 770 australs a month _ the equivalent
of $126.
   CTERA has said grade school teachers in some poorer provinces of
this nation of 31 million people receive about 350 australs ($57) a
month, requiring many to seek second jobs.
   It issued a statement saying that except in Corrientes, at least
90 percent of the primary school teachers joined Monday's walkout.
   Their strike could extend to high school teachers if no
agreement is reached by next Monday, the opening day of high school
classes. University teachers have threatened to boycott classes
because of wage conflicts.
   The government has acknowledged that teachers' salaries are low,
but said the wage demands cannot be met because of the country's
severe economic problems.
   Education and Justice Minister Jorge Sabato described the union
decision to disrupt the opening of the school year as abrupt and
lamentable.
   Most private schools, many of which are operated by churches,
opened as scheduled but a few reported walkouts by teachers
sympathetic with their public school collegues.
   CTERA is demanding a uniform minimum salary for teachers in all
of Argentina, noting differences between wages in districts in and
around Beunos Aires and those in lesser developed regions.
   The government and provinces have offered to gradually increase
salaries by an unspecified amount over several months. That was
rejected by CTERA, saying the offer was inadequate considering
Argentina's rampant inflation.
   Inflation registered 189 percent over the past 12 months.

   A fugitive arrested after he was recognized
on the TV game show ``Super Password'' pleaded guilty Monday to
collecting $100,000 on a life insurance policy by falsely claiming
his wife had been killed in an auto accident.
   Kerry Dee Ketchem, 36, entered the plea to two counts of
mail-fraud indictment. He admitted submitting the false insurance
claim while stationed with the Air Force in England.
   He faces up to 10 years in prison and a $500,000 fine at
sentencing May 2.
   Ketchem, appearing under a pseudonym on ``Super Password,'' was
identified by a TV viewer in Alaska and was arrested as he
attempted to pick up a record $58,600 in winnings from his
appearance on the show.
   The Alaskan banker who spotted Ketchem and called authorities
claimed Ketchem had run up about $25,000 in bills by using
fraudulently obtained credit cards.
   After Monday's hearing, Ketchem's attorney, Jerry Newton, said
his client also may be indicted in Indiana on charges of obtaining
a $26,000 bank loan by using a car he didn't own as collateral.

   A pro-Noriega diplomat who was replaced at the
Panamanian consulate here Monday apparently left with official
diplomatic seals and important papers, authorities said.
   Consul General Joaquin Meza left office after Panamanian
Ambassador Juan Sosa replaced him with Robert Dominguez, a
prominent businessman who fled Panama after President Eric Delvalle
was forced from office.
   Sosa supports the ousted Delvalle and has replaced 25 other
consuls general who had backed Panamanian military strongman Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   Dominguez said that when he arrived at the consulate Monday
morning, he found seals and important immigration papers were
missing. Miami police are investigating, but a spokesman said Meza
already has left the country.
   Among the papers missing were visa applications filed by dozens
of Cuban Americans who had paid thousands of dollars to visit or
pick up relatives living in Panama, Dominguez said.
   The Central American nation has been in turmoil since Noriega
was indicted in Miami and Tampa on drug charges and Delvalle called
for his ouster.
   The U.S. State Department has said it recognizes Delvalle, who
is in hiding, as the official leader of Panama.

<TEXT>
   Dissident Miklos Haraszti said police
detained him for two hours Monday and raided the house of another
activist on the eve of an official ceremony marking an unsuccessful
revolt against Austria in 1848.
   Dissidents were planning their own demonstration following the
official event scheduled for Tuesday morning.
   Haraszti, a writer, told The Associated Press police picked him
up at his house and handcuffed and beat him before taking him to a
police station in Budapest's 5th district where he was released
after being held for two hours.
   He said he was warned that he and a colleague, Tibor Philipp,
would be held responsible for any ``anti-system moves'' or
disturbances if the dissidents hold a demonstration.
   Police also searched the home of Philipp, who is associated with
the underground Inconnu cultural group, according to Haraszti.
   Over the past two weeks, police raided the homes of at least
seven dissidents including sociologist Ottilia Solt, writer Gyoergy
Gado and Gabor Demzsky, who runs the largest underground publishing
operation in communist Hungary, according to dissident sources.
   They said police seized hundreds of journals and documents.
   Haraszti said he also was criticized by the police for taking
part in a recent two-day conference in Bonn, organized by the West
German Social Democrats to discuss detente, and for making a
statement on Radio Free Europe. In the broadcast statement, he
denied the official claim that police in the earlier house raids
found leaflets opposing the consititution and legal order.
   He said only books and underground papers were confiscated.
   Last Friday, several official publications referred to the house
searches and said proceedings were under way against six people,
but they did not report the type of proceedings.
   Saturday's edition of the Communist Party daily Nepszabadsag
said the police announcement of the raids showed that ``the organs
responsible for public order had managed to stop irresponsible
people from disturbing the March 15 holiday.''
   It said that in addition to the official event, ``an opportunity
has been offered for other types of commemorations if they are not
of dubious intent and do not disturb the peace.
   ``It is impermissible that this celebration be used for
adventurist goals.''

   Lightning struck the fuselage of a passenger jet

   It said the Tupolev 154, on a flight from Taskhkent to Donetsk

   One engine died and the second stalled but the pilot, identified
as S. Kharkov, showed ``presence of mind and high skill'' in

   Izvestia did not say how many people were on the plane, which
can carry about 160 passengers, and did not mention injuries.

   The Soviet Union acknowledged Monday it
has failed to win support for a Security Council resolution calling
for an end to the deadly missile duel against each other's cities
by Iran and Iraq.
   The United States viewed the proposal as a maneuver to deflect
attention from the U.S. push for a worldwide arms embargo against
Iran for its refusal to honor the council's July 20 cease-fire
resolution and peace plan.
   It is expected the council now will just issue a statement this
week by the council president calling for an end to the missile
attacks.
   Soviet Ambassador Alexander Belonogov acknowledged that the
Soviet bid for a new resolution on the ``war of the cities'' had
failed after the council met behind closed doors.
   ``Our personal preference would be a resolution of the Security
Council,'' he said, but the important thing is ``not the form but
the essence'' of the council's action.
   ``If the presidential statement has better chances than a
resolution to be adopted by the Security Council, we are all for
it,'' he told reporters.
   Belonogov urged the council to do its utmost to end the
long-range duel, which he said was poisoning the ``political and
psychological'' atomosphere for peace talks centering on the
council's July resolution.
   A weekend truce in the war of the cities began collapsing
Sunday. By Monday, both sides had unleashed missiles on each
other's capitals.
   Both Iran and Iraq are believed to be using Soviet-made Scud-B
missiles in the duel that has killed scores of civilian since Feb.
29.
   U.S. Ambassador Herbert S. Okun said the council does not want
to ``proliferate pieces of paper when we have a resolution that we
are in the process of implementing.''
   The superpowers have been at odds over the July 20 resolution
demanding an immediate cease-fire and withdrawal to international
boundaries as the first steps in a complex plan for negotiating an
end to the 7{-year-old war.
   America has been trying to gain support since last fall for an
arms embargo against Iran, which has refused to accept the U.N.
resolution. The Soviet Union is trying to improve its relations
with neighboring Iran and has been reluctant to suppport an embargo.

<HEAD>Appeals Court Says Judiciary Committee Can Receive Hastings
Information</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court Monday ordered grand jury
material concerning U.S. District Judge Alcee Hastings of Florida
turned over to a House committee considering his impeachment.
   In a 2-1 ruling, a panel of the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals said the House Judiciary Committee had demonstrated a
``particularized need'' for the normally secret material.
   The grand jury had investigated whether Hastings tipped off a
politician about a FBI wiretap the judge had authorized in 1985. No
indictments resulted.
   Hastings, 52, the first black federal judge in Florida, was
acquitted in an unrelated case in 1983 of charges he conspired to
solicit a $150,000 bribe.
   However, two fellow judges filed a complaint that Hastings lied
in his defense and was guilty of judicial misconduct. A 27-judge
Judicial Conference last year recommended that the House consider
Hastings' impeachment.
   Hastings, who was appointed by President Jimmy Carter in 1979,
claims the impeachment proceedings are racially motivated.

<TEXT>
   Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir arrived
here Monday with what he called new ideas for Mideast peace talks
and said he would not give a yes-or-no reply to the U.S. blueprint
for negotiations with the Arabs during his four-day stay.
   ``For us, these matters are questions of life and death, of our
very existence,'' Shamir said Monday night in a speech to the
United Jewish Appeal.
   While he promised to keep an open mind in the talks, Shamir took
a hard line on Israel's retention of the West Bank and Gaza, at
least part of which the Reagan administration is calling on Israel
to surrender.
   ``I am astonished at some people's short memory,'' Shamir said.
``Did we have peace when we did not have these territories? Don't
they remember that the two most dangerous attempts to destroy us _
in 1948 and in 1967 _ were made when we did not control any of
these territories? Do they want us to go back to a situation which
would inevitably invite another such attempt?''
   Shamir's speech was well-received by an enthusiastic crowd of
about 3,000 people, who gave him several standing ovations.
   Referring to the violence on the West Bank and in Gaza in which
91 Palestinians have perished, Shamir said ``it is not a war for a
Palestinian state in those areas. It is a war against Israelis,
against the existence of the state of Israel.''
   Shamir's reluctance to respond directly to the U.S. plan did not
seem to distress the Reagan administration. ``We are not pressing
Israel,'' a senior U.S. official told reporters at a White House
briefing.
   But the official, who spoke under rules granting anonymity, said
``it is the situation in the area which is pressing Israel and all
the other parties in the area.''
   Shamir did not disclose the revisions he will propose to
Secretary of State George P. Shultz, who devised the plan and set
this week as a deadline for a reply from the Israeli and Jordanian
governments.
   The senior U.S. official said ``we are not hung up'' on a
specific date for Israel's response. But he said the Middle East
was not stable and ``we feel very strongly that everyone, Arabs and
Israelis, must move forward.''
   In an arrival statement, Shamir said the 1978 Camp David
agreements, which called for a five-year trial period of
Palestinian self-rule, ``should serve as our guide.''
   Shamir also met Monday with three of the 30 senators who had
sent him a letter urging him to give up some occupied territory in
exchange for peace. The three Democrats _ Sens. Carl Levin of
Michigan, Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey and Howard Metzenbaum of
Ohio _ again urged that Israel cede land for peace, but Shamir did
not soften his position.
   The State Department did not indicate whether Shultz would be
willing to alter his formula for negotiations. Spokesman Charles E.
Redman simply called it ``a serious proposal'' that was under
``active consideration'' in Israeli and Arab capitals.
   But the senior official said ``we won't let any aspect be eroded
or compromised.''
   He said the Camp David framework was a ``work of`genius,'' but
was partly out of date, especially since Jordan and the
Palestinians did not participate in negotiations that fell apart in
1981.
   Shultz is pushing for a three-year interim arrangement on the
Israeli-held West Bank and Gaza Strip, with negotiations for an
overall settlement to open by December. He also is prodding Israel
to cede territory in exchange for Arab recognition.
   Shamir, stepping from a U.S. Air Force plane at Andrews Air
Force Base in suburban Maryland, said he was ``always open to new
and constructive proposals'' to bring peace to the Middle East.
   He said Israel wished to live in peace with its neighbors, but
that ``violence, terrorism and war are endemic'' to the region.
   Meanwhile, Senate Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va.,
cautioned that for Israel ``to continue down the road developing
now is a road to disaster.''
   Byrd told reporters on Capitol Hill that ``Mr. Shamir would be
well-advised to listen to the viewpoints of the friends of Israel
in this country,'' including Congress and the American Jewish
community.
   Shamir, after an overnight flight from Tel Aviv, met with about
30 Jewish leaders at Kennedy International Airport in New York
before continuing on to Washington. Avi Pazner, his spokesman,
said, Shamir told them, ``I have decided not to take any decision
right now because people in Israel are divided.''
   Shamir told the group, which including Morris B. Abram, head of
the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish
Organizations, that most people in Israel want peace.
   But Shamir added that the question was whether it was possible
to make peace with the Arabs now and also maintain ``our normal
lives and our security,'' Pazner said.
   Shultz escorted Shamir to his hotel in downtown Washington on
Monday morning and talked with him for a half-hour over coffee.
   Shultz reportedly underscored the importance of Shamir's visit
as well as the ``strong and unshakable'' ties between the United
States and Israel.
   In reply, Israeli sources said, Shamir said he had brought some
``new ideas'' that he would present to Shultz in their talks over
the next three days.
   In his arrival statement, Shamir appealed for understanding.
``In our search for peace, the United States has always been
helpful, open and indispensable,'' he said.
   He said ``violence, terrorism and war are endemic'' in the
Middle East and the area ``is littered with broken agreements.''
   Shamir said the Camp David agreement, which led to a peace
treaty between Egypt and Israel in 1979 but failed to resolve the
Palestinian issue, ``should serve as our guide'' in the current
search for a negotiating formula.
   He said if past accords were ignored ``future agreements will be
meaningless.'' The Camp David agreement called for self-rule for
the 1.5 million Palestinian Arabs who live on the West Bank and in
Gaza for five years. Jordan and the Palestinians did not
participate in the talks, which ended in failure in 1981.
   Shultz has proposed a three-year interim arrangement, with talks
on an overall settlement of the Arab-Israeli dispute to begin by
December.
   On Sunday, in Israel, Shamir said ``after I come back with a
summation of my talks with representatives of the American
government, the cabinet will meet immediately and I think we'll
have a decision on this subject.''
   Meanwhile Monday, Hanna Siniora, a Palestinian who met here with
Shultz in late January, urged the secretary to make room at the
negotiating table for the Palestine Liberation Organization.
   At a news conference, Siniora, who is a newspaper editor in
Jerusalem, said ``so far there has not been a credible effort to
seek Palestinian representation.''
   Shultz's plan envisions a joint delegation of Jordanians and
Palestinians, who could participate only with the approval of the
PLO.
   But the PLO, which Shultz and Israel have branded a terrorist
group, would not take part directly. All the Arab governments have
endorsed Yasser Arafat's organization as the only legitimate
representative of the Palestinians.

   A wildfire that charred hundreds of square
miles of Texas prairie, killing cattle and wildlife, was declared
under control Monday, but surviving animals faced possible
starvation without forage or feed.
   Federal and state officials were organizing a hay donation
program for cattle roaming past burned fenceposts through the
blackened terrain.
   Officials declared the five-county fire under control Monday
about noon, said Murry Fly, the state Forest Service's head of
operations for fire control. But the forecast called for continuing
dry, windy weather.
   Damage was so widespread that crews were still trying to assess
it five days after flames from burning trash went out of control
near Abilene.
   Hundreds of firefighters, National Guardsmen and state and
federal workers contained the blaze after three days. The burned
swath covered parts of an area 56 miles long and 24 miles wide.
   ``There's been a tremendous amount of forage lost right now,''
Fly said.
   Lt. Gov. Bill Hobby issued a disaster proclamation Monday,
freeing up state money to help the area clean up and recover, said
Don Couch of the governor's Emergency Management Division. Gov.
Bill Clements was out of state.
   Bashur said representatives of the state Department of Emergency
Services will instruct local officials Tuesday on how individuals
can apply for relief grants from the federal government.
   In about 87,000 acres surveyed so far, more than 100 cattle were
killed or had to be destroyed, said Lawrence Winkler, agriculture
extension agent in Shackelford County, the hardest-hit county with
more than 250,000 acres burned. An additional 175 head were injured.
   Wildlife in the area also suffered, he said. A herd of about 20
antelope perished in the flames, according to ranchers who answered
questions about damage as they put in requests for hay and feed to
keep their livestock alive.
   There is a two-day supply of donated feed on hand, Winkler said.
Ranchers without winter forage for their herds will have to sell
their livestock, haul in hay or feed, or truck the cattle
elsewhere, he said.
   The Federal Emergency Management Agency will make disaster aid
available to reimburse firefighting costs in the five-county
region, said Bruce Miles, Forest Service director.
   If ranchers had to buy feed for all 15,000 cattle affected by
the fire, it would require 175 tons a day, at a daily cost of
$30,000, said Winkler.
   Over the weekend, ranchers from across Texas began donating hay.
By Sunday, tractor-trailers stacked with hay rolls were parked on
the courthouse square in Albany.
   At least seven firefighters were treated for minor injuries,
said Fly. The wildfire at one point threatened the towns of Albany,
Moran and Baird.

   A mass resignation of Arab
policemen has displayed the muscle of the PLO and posed a security
dilemma for Israel and Palestinians alike in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip.
   A national police spokesman, Yehoshua Goldapfel, on Sunday said
that 450 of the 850 Arab police in the occupied territories ``have
asked to leave the force.'' He left open the possibility more would
depart.
   The police control crime and direct traffic, but they are not
used to quell Arab rioting in the occupied lands, now in its fourth
month.

   Iraq said it fired five long-range
missiles into Tehran today, and Iran reported at least 16 people
killed and 27 wounded, as the two nations resumed their so-called
``war of the cities.''
   Iran vowed revenge for the missile strikes, which it said hit
residential districts of the Iranian capital, which has a
population of 6 million.
   Baghdad's official Iraqi News Agency, monitored in Nicosia,
quoted a military communique as saying the five surface-to-surface
missiles were launched in retaliation for an Iranian ground attack
in northern Iraq on Sunday night and shelling of the southern port
of Basra and three other towns.

contest is looking like another George Bush runaway.
   One poll out today said Jesse Jackson was pulling ahead of Paul

out dozens of other diseases that can produce the same symptoms.
   ``It's a diagnosis of exclusion, and it has to be considered as

something else going on. You have to keep an open mind and not

<HEAD>The Queen of Ranchera Music</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAVIER PICHARDINI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   All you have to say in Mexico is Lola la
Grande, or Lola the Great One, and everyone knows who you're
talking about.
   Lola is Lola Beltran, the queen of ranchera music, whose rich,
husky and wide-ranged voice can evoke the pain and happiness of
love, tender feelings for the land or the gaiety of a Mexican
fiesta.
   For 35 years, Beltran has shared those sounds of Mexico
throughout the world, often bringing tears to the eyes of homesick
Mexicans in the United States and elsewhere.
   ``My soul feels like crying. ... I need you so much and yet I
swore I would never tell you this,'' she sang in one of her first
concerts after she made a hit on Mexico City XEW radio station.
   ``Three days without looking at you ... three days crying for
you ... three days looking at the sunrise,'' she sang in another
song, this one written by a friend _ composer Jose Alfredo Jimenez,
the sad-faced, tragic figure of modern Mexican music who died an
early death and who became famous for songs about love, land, bars
and drink.
   ``I will always remember Jose Alfredo,'' Beltran said, recalling
the times they performed together in Mexican films. ``Since he
died, many beautiful things have disappeared. He was unique and
extraordinary. Only those who go to heaven can have his kind of
heart.''
   Jimenez wrote the lyrics that broke down barriers and appealed
to pure, raw, feelings. ``What can you know about life? When did
you ever open with me the doors to Tenampa?'' which is a popular
Mexico mariachi bar.
   On March 12, Beltran was honored in New York by the Hispanic
Association of Entertainment Writers.
   The honor came as the sounds of ``ranchera'' music gets new,
widespread attention in the United States from pop singer Linda
Ronstadt and her Spanish-language album ``Canciones de Mi Padre,''
or ``Songs of My Father.''
   Ronstadt, who was recently in Mexico rehearsing for her current
concert tour of the United States, said she always has been an
admirer of the regal Beltran.
   ``When I was growing up, my father used to play the records of
Lola Beltran, who has always been a great influence on my
singing,'' Ronstadt recalled.
   ``I love that young girl,'' Beltran said. ``Whenever I am in the
United States, she comes to see me and when she comes here, I am
happy to receive her.''
   Beltran and Ronstadt performed a duet last fall at the Acapulco
Film Festival.
   ``I am very grateful to everyone,'' Beltran said in an
interview. ``I have been lucky enough to sing for people like
(Presidents) Eisenhower, Nixon and (former French President
Charles) De Gaulle.''
   Like most music of the people, ``ranchera'' music is similar to
American country music, with a few Mexican variations.
   ``May the devil take you, you murderous bull,'' Beltran curses
in a soulful song that recounts the death of a young boy who sneaks
into the corrals and is killed by the brave bulls under a moonlit
night.
   Since Beltran's first three songs on XEW, she has maded more
than 100 albums and acted in more than 50 movies.
   However, she is not as active as she used to be years ago when
she would sing before a weekly TV audience or in between cockfights.
   But she does three benefits every year and has an invitation to
sing at the University of Southern California next May.

<HEAD>Thousands of Trash Pickers Being Moved as Mexican Dump Closes</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The sprawling Santa Fe garbage dump is being
bulldozed and filled in to help rid Mexico City of pollution, but
for thousands of trash pickers it means the end of a way of life
that began more than 40 years ago.
   A distinct class of the poor people _ 2,000 to 3,000 people _
had taken shape in and around the dump since it first opened in the
1940s and picking trash provided a livelihood for them. It grew
into a tightly knit society regulated by a dump boss _ Pablo Tellez
Falcon being the most recent _ and outsiders were unwelcome.
   Now, the city government says, the trash pickers will be moved
to homes with electricity and plumbing near a new but temporary
dump, and Santa Fe will become a park.
   But the plan leaves trash pickers with mixed feelings and
somewhat concerned about the future.
   The foul-smelling dump, spread over about 150 acres on the
western edge of Mexico City, was one of the largest in Latin
America and the last of the big open-air sites to be shut down by
the Mexico City government.
   ``This dump became an air pollution and public health problem,''
the city said in a news release announcing the project.
   Under an ambitious plan, the city began a year ago to level,
compact and seal the solid wastes at the Santa Fe site. The garbage
was estimated to be 230 feet deep in some places, forming enormous
cliffs from the refuse deposited there for more than four decades.
   Homero Aridjis, a poet and president of the Group of 100
environmental activists, said the project ``is important because
the garbage is not only a pollution problem but also a social
problem.''
   The Mexico City metropolitan area, the world's largest with 18
million people, is considered by experts to have the world's worst
air pollution.
   The Santa Fe dump, releasing bacteria into the air, posed a
health hazard to the trash pickers (``pepenadores,'' or scavengers,
in Spanish) and residents of surrounding neighborhoods, some of the
city's wealthiest.
   Spontaneous fires often broke out, sending noxious fumes into
the air. There also was concern the wastes were seeping into
aquifers and contaminating the city's already scarce water supply.
   Much of the trash has been covered over, but many pickers still
live in their shacks amid the fly-covered refuse that remains at
Santa Fe.
   Nearby, the city has opened the other dump, Prados de la
Montana, where some 2,500 tons a day of trash are unloaded. That
site will be used, however, for just five years.
   The Santa Fe pickers will be moved in the coming months and
offered new houses outside the Prados de la Montana dump. The
nearby Tlayapaca housing project, which will provide 510 two- and
three-bedroom houses, with water, electricity and drainage systems,
is to be completed in May.
   ``With this action, the social evolution of that group of people
will be achieved, improving their conditions of health and
well-being and, as a result, their quality of life,'' the
government said.
   Apolonia Martinez de Correa, whose family flattens milk cartons,
stuffs them into plastic bags and sells them for recycling, said
she would be glad to live in a cleaner place but is not so sure
about moving from Santa Fe.
   ``There is not as much pollution. There are not as many flies,''
she said of living somewhere else.
   But she expressed sadness at being forced out of a place that
has been the family home since the area became a dump and concern
about where her family would move.
   She said she had been told the new houses would cost 2 million
to 3 million pesos apiece (about $870 to $1,300), a sum the family
cannot afford.
   ``We will have to go somewhere else,'' she said.
   However, Alejandro Rodriguez Cortez, chief of information for
the city government, said the residents would have to pay only for
water, electricity and other public services in the new homes.
   Mrs. Martinez de Correa earns 80 pesos _ less than five cents _
for a 2.2-pound bag of paper. A week's work, she said, is worth
50,000 pesos or about $22. The government-set minimum wage is 8,000
pesos a day, or about $3.50.
   As she talked to a reporter, several of her 10 children sat
nearby. A young boy played with a dirt-encrusted fruit pit. Two
small girls, their faces and clothes covered with grime, listened
quietly.
   Behind them, several of the stray dogs that roam the dump in
packs scratched for scraps among flattened milk cartons waiting to
be bagged.
   Over the years, some of Santa Fe's residents arranged their
shacks, made of the metal cut from oil drums, in rows, forming
streets and some order in their lives. Their children studied at a
primary school and took part in sports events on the weekends.
   About 200 families have already moved out of Santa Fe to housing
farther away from the sites, residents said. Some return to work at
the new dump, but others are trying to find different jobs.
   Under new rules, the garbage pickers are allowed to enter the
Prados de la Montana dump and pick trash from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m.
daily, separating glass and plastic from paper and tin. They can't
live there, and small children and pregnant women will be refused
entry for health reasons.
   After the workers leave at night, the unpicked rubbish is
flattened and covered with dirt to prevent contamination.
   ``It's controlled,'' said Hector Javier Samano, a project
engineer with the city`s Urban Services Department. ``There are no
flies, there is no smell.''

<HEAD>Demise of the Deux Chevaux, a French Automotive Institution</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For nearly half a century, mountains, deserts and
Paris' traffic couldn't stop it _ that chugging, ungainly
four-wheeled beast known as the Deux Chevaux. But modern times
have, and an era in the French auto industry has come to an end.
   The Deux Chevaux (French for two horses, or two horsepower) is a
car, although some say it is an exaggeration to call it that _ tin
can on wheels is more like it. The last one rolled off a French
assembly line Feb. 29 when France's oldest automobile factory, the
Citroen plant in Levallois, shut down.
   There was hardly a whimper or a word in the press.
   Yet the closing of the plant on the western edge of Paris
signals the demise of the tortoise-shaped automotive with bulging
headlights that look like a frog's eyes.
   So ends an institution as French as the beret or baguette.
   Whether rattling down a country road or careening across a city
boulevard, with its side windows flapping on their hinges, the Deux
Chevaux has long been part of the French landscape. Its snail's
pace and its noisy chugs have endeared millions, spawning Deux
Chevaux fan clubs worldwide.
   ``When the last car left the factory in Levallois, you can say
it was the end of an era,'' said Gro Hoeg, a Citroen spokeswoman.
``But you can't say it is the end of the Deux Chevaux.''
   The car will continue to be manufactured in Portugal, but at
less than half the 1987 rate, when 43,255 Deux Chevaux were turned
out.
   ``I don't have great patriotic sentiment, but it's the only car
with a French identity,'' said three-time Deux Chevaux owner Gilles
Collignon.
   The Deux Chevaux was conceived as an affordable car for those of
modest means.
   When it first came out the Deux Chevaux cost the franc
equivalent of about $650. The two latest models cost $6,500 and
$7,460.
   Like sensible shoes, the buggy with bed-spring suspension, a
simple engine, no ``extras,'' is functional in the extreme. And
allegedly indestructible.
   Funny looking to some people, downright ugly to others, the Deux
Chevaux is simply ``beyond beauty,'' says Citroen. In the 1960s,
Deux Chevaux's heyday, it became a reverse status symbol among the
rebellious young.
   ``It's more than a car,'' said Collignon. ``Everyone who has one
has a more or less sentimental relationship with it.
   ``The big advantage is that it can be completely falling apart,
broken all over, and it keeps running. It has an incredible life.''
   The Deux Chevaux has set altitude and depth records for a car _
climbing to 17,180 feet on Bolivia's Mount Chacaltaya in 1953 and
down deep into a salt mine in France's Lorraine region.
   Two Frenchmen, Jacques Seguela and Jean-Claude Baudot, made an
87,000-mile round-the-world trip in a Deux Chevaux, once resorting
to crushed bananas to replace oil lost from a broken gearbox during
a 200-mile desert stretch.
   ``Four wheels under an umbrella'' was the order to engineers
working on the design in the 1930s, according to Citroen, which
later touted it as ``the most minimum car.''
   A wooden model was produced in 1936. World War II intervened,
and the car was not formally unveiled until October 1948 at the
Paris Auto show.
   Originally available only in gray, with a top speed of 37 miles
an hour, today's Deux Chevaux streak by in all colors, or even
two-tone, and can reach a top speed of 72 mph.
   The upgraded engine remains mechanically elementary and the
horsepower has increased from two to three.
   Citroen brochures call the Deux Chevaux ``a mechanical
phenomenon, a commercial phenomenon, a sociological phenomenon.''
But the truth, Ms. Hoeg concedes, is that the car is outmoded.
   ``Orders have fallen a lot,'' she said in a telephone interview.
``The European market is increasingly closed to the Deux Chevaux
because of pollution norms.''
   Strict pollution controls, for example, have effectively banned
the car from Switzerland and Austria since October 1987. It has not
been sold in Sweden since 1968 and in Finland since 1982 because it
doesn't come up to their safety standards. Deux Chevaux fans in
other countries are expected to be deprived of the car in the
coming years, Ms. Hoeg said. No effort was ever made to sell it in
the United States, but she said she understands there are some Deux
Chevaux collectors there.
   The closing of the Levallois plant, built in 1893, is part of an
overall retrenchment of the French auto industry. At its peak in
the mid-1960s, the plant turned out 550 Deux Chevaux a day,
compared to 80 a day last year.
   The Citroen plant in Manguade, Portugal, manufacturing Deux
Chevaux since 1982, is expected to produce about 20,000 in 1988.

   Nawal Akiki wept as
the ferryboat Empress left the dock, the lights of Jounieh
twinkling in the darkness, masking Lebanon's scars and suffering.
   It was her last sight of her troubled homeland.
   With her husband, Elie, and their two sons, she was getting away
from Lebanon's violence and economic chaos of 13 years of civil war
for a new life in Canada.
   For Lebanon's 900,000 Christians, penned up in a enclave north
of Beirut by the war, the 8,187-ton Empress and its sister ship,
the Sunny Boat, are their only way out of Lebanon.
   Beirut's airport is in Moslem-controlled territory on the other
side of the capital's dividing Green Line and is unsafe for
Christians. Jounieh, 13 miles north of Beirut, is the Christians'
only passenger port.
   Mrs. Akiki spent the entire voyage staring out of a porthole,
sometimes weeping as she sailed into an unknown future in a strange
land.
   The white-painted Empress and the Sunny Boat shuttle between
Jounieh and Larnaca on the south coast of Cyprus every day with
bizarre cargoes of humanity, dispirited Lebanese, commuting
businessmen, security agents, gamblers, and sometimes hashish
runners.
   During the nine-hour night-time voyage across the eastern
Mediterranean, the Empress becomes Lebanon in microcosm, mirroring
the despair and hopelessness of its feuding people.
   In the lounge, a band pounds out pop tunes. In the all-night
casino, Lebanese high-rollers crowd around the roulette and
blackjack tables and the bank of a dozen slot machines.
   The action never stops. But few are few winners, said one of the
croupiers, identifying himself only as Tanious.
   ``These people drop thousands of dollars every night. It's
amazing. Some of them are regulars on the boat and they rarely get
off ahead of the game.''
   Before he joined the Empress last summer, Tanious said, he was a
fighter with the Lebanese Forces, the Christians' main militia.
   So was Elias, 24, one of the crewmen. He said he took the
$100-a-month job ``because I don't want to fight any more.''
   Elias said he has been wounded three times fighting Moslems and
leftists in the war.
   ``I want to get out for good, but no one will give me a visa.
One of these days maybe I'll meet an American lady, or an English
lady, on the boat and I'll marry her and get myself a new
passport.''
   Elias and one of his friends among the 200-member crew admitted
that part of their job is to gather information for the Lebanese
Forces about travelers heading for Lebanon.
   With Cyprus increasingly used by the Middle East's underground
organizations, foreign intelligence agencies, gunrunners and drug
smugglers, the Empress and the Sunny Boat attract the attention of
Lebanese and Cypriot authorities as well.
   Passengers are checked and closely questioned by the Lebanese
security officials and Cypriot police during the voyage.
   Cypriot customs officers regularly arrest Lebanese for
drug-smuggling after the ferryboats dock, although they admit the
big rings use high-speed boats to ship their hashish and heroin
grown in Lebanon's Bekaa Valley.
   The Empress is well known in the eastern Mediterranean. It
evacuated Palestinian guerrillas from Beirut after Israel's 1982
invasion of Lebanon.
   The following year, it carried Yasser Arafat and his PLO
guerrillas when they were pushed out of their last Lebanese
stronghold in the northern port of Tripoli by Syrian-backed
dissidents.
   In December, Israeli gunboats intercepted it and forced it to
turn back to Larnaca because they suspected it was carrying
Palestinian guerrillas to Lebanon as part of Arafat's effort to
rebuild his onetime power base.
   Lebanese Foreign Ministry officials estimate that as many as 1
million Lebanese have been granted emigration visas in the last
three years.
   Businessman Jean Mubarak was heading for Larnaca aboard the
Empress to catch a plane for Montreal after receiving initial
acceptance as an immigrant from Canadian authorities.
   Two of his brothers have lived in Montreal for three years and
he was going to take a look at the country where he and his family
will make their new home.
   ``What's it like in Montreal?'' he asked Akiki, also bound for
Montreal with his family. ``I hear it's really cold in winter and
I'm worried if my children will able to bear it there.''
   ``Anything's better than the gunbattles and shelling, the power
cuts,'' Akiki replied. ``I want a better life for myself and my
family.''

<HEAD>Capital of Laos Like a Sleepy Village These Day</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MOLLY YONG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>VIENTIANE, Laos (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Buddhist monks in saffron robes stop in
the middle of a downtown street to meditate. Mechanics work at
keeping rusty Volkswagen Beetles running. Panes are missing from
windows in government buildings. Just about everything needs a coat
of paint.
   This is Vientiane 13 years after Communist forces took it over
during the Indochina War. It is more like a sleepy village than a
national capital.
   In contrast to virtually every urban center in Asia, its
population has decreased, from nearly 200,000 at the war's end in
1975 to 100,000 now.
   Virtually no construction has taken place under the Communists,
who are trying to cope with one of the most meager economies in the
world. The landlocked country's per capita income hovers around
$160 a year.
   Vientiane's tallest building is the seven-story Ministry of
Culture, built more than 15 years ago. It faces a water fountain
that has no water.
   Only a few traffic lights are seen along the main streets, which
before 1975 bustled with Chinese merchants. Some of their shops are
now closed, their owners having joined the exodus of more than
300,000 from a country with a population of less than 4 million.
   This small population and relatively abundant agricultural land
have helped avoid the hunger and poverty found in some other Asian
countries.
   In Vientiane, at least, there is evidence of the good life for
some.
   At the sprawling, open-air marketplace, vendors display a wide
variety of consumer goods, mostly from Thailand, which lies just
across the Mekong River boundary.
   Prices for Thai jeans, toothpaste and other basic items are only
slightly higher than across the river.
   Although Laos is closely linked with Vietnam, another neighbor,
and has attempted to establish close economic ties with it, a large
quantity of Laotian imports and exports still pass through Thailand.
   Thais and Laotians share racial and cultural bonds and despite
the Laotian government's its attempts to veer away from pro-Western
Thailand, residents of Vientiane read Thai magazines, gossip about
Thai movie stars and tune in to Thai television.
   There is also a lingering influence of the French, onetime
colonial masters in Laos. Apart from the French-style residences,
one can still buy tasty French bread and frequent such
establishments as La Fantaisie Tailor and hairdressing salons with
French names.
   Even a big billboard advertising the Soviet airline Aeroflot and
``its more than 160 worldwide destinations,'' is written in French,
although hundreds of Soviet advisers are in the country and some
attempt is made to teach Russian in schools.
   But Moscow and the Soviet way of life seem very distant from
languid Vientiane. Aeroflot's Flight SU553 flies directly from
Moscow to Vientiane once a week but it does not pick up passengers
on its return.
   Despite strident Marxist calls to greater efforts at national
reconstruction, the old Laos of temple bells and the ``bo pen
yang'' (``never mind, take it easy'') lifestyle appears in some
degree to have survived.
   Near the 16th century monastery of That Luang, barefoot boys
plau around an ancient frangipani tree in bloom as their mothers
pass the day chatting.
   Evidently intact is the traditional hospitality of Laotians.
   Although Western journalists are rarely granted visas, once
admitted they are invariably greeted with the smiles, patience and
small kindnesses.
   By far the largest group of journalists to visit Laos _ 55 Thais
and other foreigners _ were entertained with dances and a magic
show and fed exotic food as they accompanied Thailand's army chief,
Gen. Chaovalit Yongchaiyudh, to Vientiane for a 27-hour visit
recently. Chaovalit was leading a Thai military delegation trying
to patch up relations after the bloodiest border fighting between
the two countries since 1975.
   At Vientiane's Laksi restaurant, overlooking the Mekong River,
the visitors were served pangolin stew, a concoction of onions,
wild mushrooms and dark meat of the toothless anteater.
   The Laotians reportedly went out of their way to capture the
animal and prepare the delicacy for military officers they had been
fighting a week earlier.

<HEAD>Producer Robert Cooper Likes Movies About `The Little Guy'

   Movie producer Robert Cooper likes to tell
stories about the little guy pursuing a goal despite seemingly
insurmountable odds.
   His first movie in 1979, ``Running,'' was about a middle-aged
man determined to run in the Olympics.
   ``The Terry Fox Story,'' a television movie for Home Box Office,
told of a youth who ran across Canada despite losing a leg to
cancer.
   ``The Simon Wiesenthal Story: Murderers Among Us'' will follow
the story of a man who devoted 40 years of his life to tracking
down Nazi war criminals.
   And ``Max and Helen'' will show a survivor of the Holocaust who
is finally reunited with the woman he loves, but because of a twist
of fate cannot testify against the Nazi who brutalized them both.
   Cooper has pursued his own goals against the odds. At 5-foot-4,
he describes himself as a little guy out to prove himself. He grew
up in Montreal, where he abandoned his goal of acting to become a
lawyer after his father was threatened by gangsters. He set up a
storefront law firm, then became a prosecutor fighting organized
crime.
   He later spent six years as host of a Canadian television show
called ``Ombudsman,'' which looked into complaints of injustice by
its viewers.
   ``The theme of the little guy against the odds has always
appealed to me, not only in my films but in my own life,'' he said.
``I think because of my size I developed an early sensitivity to
injustice. It's the David and Goliath thing, although some people
tell me I use the sling a little too often.''
   ``The Simon Wiesenthal Story'' goes into production for HBO in
Budapest on May 2. Academy Award winner Ben Kingsley (``Gandhi'')
stars in the title role of the four-hour miniseries.
   ``You've got to do something about a man who's been obsessed for
40 years,'' said Cooper. ``I told Simon I wanted to know why he did
what he did when everyone else had come to terms with the
Holocaust. He had stayed in a time warp in the 1940s. He was the
man who found Adolph Eichmann and (found) the man who arrested Anne
Frank.''
   Cooper will also film a Wiesenthal book called ``Max and
Helen,'' which tells of the only time Wiesenthal let a Nazi war
criminal go. Max and the woman he loved, Helen, were brutalized in
a Nazi camp by an SS officer who was found living free in Munich.
But Max refuses to testify.
   ``Max tells Simon to `get in my skin,''' Cooper said. ``He tells
of how he and Helen were in the same camp, but were separated. In
1945 he was able to escape, but was imprisoned another 10 years by
the Russians. In 1955 he finally found Helen in Germany.
   ``But Helen had a son who was the image of the Nazi SS officer.
He had raped her repeatedly in camp and freed her when she became
pregnant. Max can't marry her. Her son reminds him of the Nazi.
Yet, he won't testify because the son thinks he's Jewish and
doesn't know who his real father is.''
   Later, the son grows a beard and moves to Canada. Max and Helen
marry, but within a few weeks Max kills himself.
   Cooper also has these projects in the works:
   _``Inspector Maigret,'' which is being filmed in Europe with
Richard Harris, Victoria Tennant and Patrick O'Neal. Maigret has
been described as a sort of French Columbo. The show is for
syndication.
   _``Cuba,'' a four-hour miniseries for CBS, tells of an American
family living in Cuba from 1900 until Fidel Castro takes over in
1959. Cooper hopes to be able to film it in Cuba.
   _An NBC movie about New York model Marla Hanson, whose face was
slashed in a knife attack arranged by her landlord and former
makeup man. ``My interest is the fact that she was slashed by her
makeup man, whose job was to make her beautiful,'' he said. ``Why
did he do it? That's what fascinates me. That and the story of a
woman who was told all her life she is beautiful _ then loses it.''

   American electronics companies are starved for
computer chips. Japanese chip makers are raking in windfall
profits. And nobody seems quite sure what to do.
   This is the way of the world in the electronics industry, circa
March 1988. It didn't have to be this way.
   The current worldwide shortage in computer chips is a classic
manifestation of the Law of Unintended Consequences, one that has
resulted in higher prices of electronic products and even delays in
the introduction of some new computers.
   One big reason for the shortage is unobjectionable: Booming
sales of personal computers and the retooling for a new generation
of memory chips have combined to produce a cyclical squeeze on
production capacity.
   But another reason for the shortage is that a 1986 chip
agreement between the United States and Japan has backfired in a
way that should have been predictable.
   The accord, intended to benefit U.S. chip makers, was supposed
to keep the Japanese from ``dumping'' chips at unfairly low prices
while giving the Americans better access to Japan's huge market.
   What actually came about was the creation of a de facto
semiconductor cartel _ a legalized form of collusion that had the
effect of setting prices above market levels and carving up markets.
   The Japanese did raise prices of memory chips, mainly by
limiting production, but the main beneficiaries were just two U.S.
companies, Texas Instruments Inc. of Dallas and tiny Micron
Technology Inc. of Boise, Idaho.
   Texas Instruments and Micron are the only American companies
still selling dynamic random access memory chips, or D-RAMs, and
they are earning a windfall.
   Meanwhile, U.S. companies such as Digital Equipment Corp. and
Hewlett-Packard Co. are paying more for chips than their foreign
rivals pay. The consequences of that over the long term are
disquieting.
   As for U.S. access to the Japanese market, it is not happening.
It was reported in January that foreigners' share of Japan's market
had fallen every month since June.
   In Japan, Americans are bumping their heads against a concrete
ceiling. For one thing, the biggest consumers of chips in Japan are
also the biggest producers. It is unlikely they will buy from
Americans when they can take chips right off their own fabrication
lines, although pressure on them should be continued.
   Most worrisome in the long run is that the high prices Japanese
chip makers are fetching under the accord is giving them even more
money to pour into their world-leading research and development.
   In exactly the same way that Japanese automakers responded to
``voluntary'' restraints by moving upscale with cars like the Honda
Acura, Japanese chip makers are beginning to move upscale with more
complex, expensive chips that have been the domain of the Americans.
   So what needs to be done?
   The main job, obviously, is to rebuild the American chip
industry so it can compete with the Japanese without the need for a
de facto cartel. The 1986 accord has already been legally
challenged by the European Economic Community.
   Sematech seems to be a step in the right direction. The
organization, to be based in Austin, Texas, is financed by
government and industry and will work to improve manufacturing
techniques, which are considered the Achilles' heel of the U.S.
chip makers.
   A bigger problem is that many of the United States' leading chip
makers, such as Intel Corp. and National Semiconductor Corp., are
only mid-sized companies that lack the deep pockets to compete with
Japanese giants such as Hitachi Ltd. and Toshiba Corp.
   Big U.S. chip buyers such as General Electric Co. could give the
American industry a financial shot in the arm by buying the chip
makers, but they have shown little interest in the volatile and
expensive business.
   More mergers of chip companies almost surely lie ahead. The
federal government may even serve as matchmaker in some cases.
   But two of the most worthwhile steps to help the U.S. chip
business _ and thus the electronics business _ have nothing to do
with integrated circuits per se.
   Step one would be to lower the cost of borrowing for the
capital-intensive industry by cutting the federal budget deficit.
Step two would be to improve the quality of American technical
education, on which the industry depends.
   Those are long-term steps, to be sure. But Japan did not get
where it is by concentrating on the short term.

<HEAD>A Walk In The Zoo With An Actor-Knight</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT WOLF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``Hello dear. You're very handsome. Yes you are,''
Sir Alec Guinness coos through the cage at a rhinoceros.
   ``You've got a sweet face, very pretty ears,'' the elder
statesman of British acting says, as he strolls through Berlin's
central Zoologischen Garten.
   His chat with the animals is almost as engaging as the wonderful
characters he has portrayed on stage and screen during five decades
as one of the world's finest, most chameleon-like talents.
   On this particular day, the Berlin Film Festival was awarding
the 73-year-old Guinness its special ``Ehren Bear'' (honorary bear)
for lifetime achievement in the cinema. The actor, however, elected
to avoid the morning crush of screenings and news conferences for a
romp in the zoo.
   ``I'm not actually that keen on them; I hate to see certain
animals caged up,'' he said.
   ``But I remember this zoo being small and very imaginatively
laid out on the open plan, and I thought it might be amusing to
have a second look.'' He last visited the Zoologischen Garten 14
years ago.
   Images of some of the zoo's reported stock of 10,000 animals
have lingered: ``They used to have white rhinoceroses there that
were charming. And a great sea lion covered in shrapnel wounds _ an
old thing that was like a symbol of Berlin; a splendid, great
creature.''
   This time around, Guinness' observations are as keen as ever,
whether applied to the varieties of zoo-bound species or the
special tributes that have marked his career.
   In 1980, he received a special Academy Award to honor a range of
work encompassing such portrayals as the sinister Fagin in ``Oliver
Twist'' (1948), a comic octet of murder victims in ``Kind Hearts
and Coronets'' (1950), the hard-driving Colonel Nicholson in ``The
Bridge on the River Kwai'' (1957), the aging mystic Ben Obi-Wan
Kenobi in ``Star Wars'' (1977) and its sequels.
   Last year, he was twice feted in lavish galas _ in April at New
York's Lincoln Center and in May at the Cannes Film Festival.
   The occasion in Berlin may be less tony, but its significance is
no less clear: in the Festival's 38 years, Guinness is only the
second actor to be so honored, following James Stewart in 1982.
   ``I'm afraid when you get rather elderly, these things seem to
come on you rather more than you might wish,'' he says, his brisk
gait belying his years, his nose becoming slightly red in the
seasonal chill.
   A signpost draws his attention: ``I think that way may be the
pheasantry. Do you mind if we go in there?''
   Somewhere between pheasants and finches, the conversation turns
to work. His latest project is ``Little Dorrit,'' the six-hour film
adaptation of Charles Dickens' novel in which he plays William
Dorrit, a long-term inmate of a debtor's prison who finds that
sudden wealth brings sudden freedom.
   Guinness had not performed Dickens since the 1940s, when he both
adapted ``Great Expectations'' for the stage and made his movie
debut as Herbert Pocket in David Lean's 1946 film version. He then
appeared in ``Oliver Twist'' in 1948. He considers ``Little
Dorrit'' to be one of Dickens' two or three greatest novels.
   ``Dickens offers great temptations for actors because you can go
over the top,'' he said.
   Later this year, he'll be seen as Mr. Todd in a movie of Evelyn
Waugh's 1934 novel, ``A Handful of Dust.'' Then there's Lee
Blessing's current Broadway play, ``A Walk in the Woods,'' which
Guinness may do on the London stage. He last trod the West End
boards in Alan Bennett's ``The Old Country'' in 1977-8.
   ``It's a very distinguished piece of writing,'' he says of the
play. But Guinness acknowledges its pitfalls, as well: ``The amount
of learning for a two-hander is horrendous. An actor's great fear
is that he won't have the memory.''
   On that topic, he is emboldened by the recent return to the
stage, after a decade away, of his friend and mentor, Sir John
Gielgud, in the new play ``The Best of Friends.''
   ``Gielgud is 83,'' Guinness says matter-of-factly, ``and he got
through it (the play) very successfully.''
   By now, the sky has clouded over, and rain looks likely.
Guinness has a lunch date for which he mustn't be late, so he
returns to his hotel to find that autograph hunters have arrived.
   ``There they are,'' he says, sounding resigned as the anonymity
of the walk in the zoo gives way to the fans' ever-ready pens and
cameras.
   But before leaving the zoo, he has one last remark about rhinos:
``We're told they have very nice personalities.''
   He takes an inimitable pause. ``But I don't think I'd like to
encounter them intimately.''

<HEAD>The Name Lavrenti Beria Still Brings Chills to Soviets</HEAD>

   Lavrenti Beria.
   The mere mention of the name stills brings chills to some
Soviets.
   In the 1960s, years after his death, people still avoided
walking past his drab mansion at 28 Kachalov St. in Moscow because
of the terrible memories it might evoke.
   Now, 34 years after Beria's own execution, the mansion houses
the Tunisian Embassy.
   Ambassador Abderraouf Ounaies of Tunisia said there were stories
that Beria had a dungeon built in the basement and a secret
passageway. Some areas of the basement could have been used as a
dungeon, Ounaies said, but he found no evidence of that they
actually were used for that, nor was there evidence of a secret
passageway.
   The curse seems to have worn off. People these days walk by,
apparently without giving a thought to Lavrenti Beria, the balding,
small Georgian who wore pince-nez and is held responsible for the
executions of millions during the Stalin era.
   ``Every generation has its horrors,'' said an elderly
neighborhood woman, who recalled seeing Beria strolling outside the
mansion when he lived there.
   The administration of General Secretary Mikhail S. Gorbachev
says it wants the current generation of Soviets to know the truth
about the past, and is reviving nightmares about Beria and the
machine of terror he ran in the late 1930s and 1940s as Stalin's
most ruthless and powerful henchman.
   Press articles and the portrayal of a Beria-Hitler-like
character in the recent Georgian movie ``Repentance'' are part of
Gorbachev's attempts to fill in ``blank spots'' in history _
formerly taboo subjects. He believes that extending his policy of
glasnost, or openness, to the crimes of the Stalin era will help
ensure that such mistakes are not repeated.
   The effort parallels Gorbachev's drive to rid Soviet society of
Stalinist policies under which the central government exercised
tight control over the economy.
   Sergo A. Mikoyan, the son of the late Anastas I. Mikoyan who had
served with Beria in the Stalin leadership, wrote Feb. 21 in the
youth newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda that it is important to review
Beria ``to finally free the future from the past.''
   Beria's legacy is the image of the state security forces as
all-powerful and ruthless. In their re-examination of Stalin and
Beria, Soviet media have not touched on this image as it pertains
to the present-day KGB, successor to Beria's NKVD. Also
conspicuously absent is any criticism of the system that enabled
such a pair to take charge and to operate their machine of terror
for so long.
   This is not the first time the official media have focused on
Beria's reign of terror. He was first exposed during Nikita S.
Khrushchev's de-Stalinization drive in the 1950s and 60s.
Khrushchev, in his memoirs _ published only in the West _ called
Beria ``a butcher and an assassin,'' a ``beast'' who was ``without
the slightest trace of human decency'' and who was ``very skillful
at anything that was filthy and treacherous.''
   Although Beria was sharply condemned during Khrushchev's years,
the early official accounts inacurrately described his relationship
with Stalin.
   ``We refused to believe that Stalin himself could have been
behind the terror which Beria oversaw,'' Khrushchev wrote. ``For a
while, we gave the party and the people incorrect explanations
about what had happened; we blamed everything on Beria. He was a
convenient figure.''
   The truth, Khrushchev said, was that ``Beria didn't create
Stalin; Stalin created Beria.''
   Only now, under Gorbachev, is the official record being
corrected, with the help of Sergo Mikoyan and the sons of other
members of Stalin's Politburo, Georgy M. Malenkov and Khrushchev.
Andrei G. Malenkov and Sergei N. Khrushchev are quoted in a recent
edition of Nedelya, a weekly supplement to the Literary Gazette
newspaper. That and the other articles put the blame squarely on
Stalin.
   ``I believe that the roots of Beria's evil deeds should be
sought in the personality of Stalin rather than in Beria himself,''
Nikolai Zhusyenin wrote in Nedelya. ``Namely the cult, the
deviation from Leninist norms, resulted in the Beria phenomenon.
Beria was able to guess Stalin's wishes, was able to exploit the
weaknesses of his master for personal profit and
self-glorification.''
   Zhusyenin said that when he interviewed people, ``their arms
began to tremble at the very mention of the name Beria.''

   The writers of the recent articles said they had trouble
researching Beria because he did such a good job of covering his
tracks, making sure that any evidence that could be used against
him was destroyed and witnesses killed.
   Komsomolskaya Pravda stated the new evaluation of Stalin's
relationship with Beria in its headline over Sergo Mikoyan's
article: ``The Servant.''
   Stalin tapped Beria, a fellow Georgian, to be deputy head of the
already-dreaded NKVD, as the state security and police force was
known at the time, in the summer of 1938. By year's end, Beria
replaced NKVD chief Nikolai Yezhov, who had fallen out of favor
with Stalin and was executed in 1940.
   The people breathed a sigh of relief, hoping that the years of
bloody mass purges were behind them. Mass arrests did end, but the
terror continued. Beria simply made it more selective, playing on
Stalin's paranoia by identifying and eliminating those deemed to be
``enemies of the people.''
   In the meantime, he garnered a staggering amount of power. Beria
became the first secret police chief elevated to the Communist
Party's ruling Politburo. During World War II, Stalin named Beria
to the committee supervising defense and later put him in charge of
developing a Soviet atomic bomb. After the war, Beria controlled
the regular and secret police, the country's labor camps,
propaganda and transport, as well as a private empire in his native
Georgia and surrounding regions.
   Among the horrors Western historians link to Beria was the
massacre of more than 4,000 Polish officers in the Katyn Forest
near Smolensk by NKVD troops in April 1940. The official Soviet
version is that the Poles were killed by Germans.
   On a personal level, Soviet accounts of Beria said he
interrogated and executed prisoners himself. Khrushchev claimed
Beria raped teen-age girls after having them kidnapped off the
streets.
   Beria's intrigues also took a heavy toll on the party itself.
Nedyelya noted that Beria collected files on every government
leader, including Stalin, for possible use against them. His
victims included veteran party members, comrades-in-arms of V.I.
Lenin and officials of the party youth group Komsomol, Nedyelya
said.
   Even Stalin began to fear Beria, and by 1946 had taken away all
his henchman's security posts. But Beria retained unofficial
control over the security organs, and planned to use his forces to
seize power after Stalin's death in March 1953.
   Khrushchev, in his memoirs and in remarks cited Feb. 24 in
Literary Gazette, said he was aware of Beria's ambitions and
suggested privately to the other top leaders in the summer of 1953
that they oust Beria. They agreed. The Politburo, in Beria's
presence, met and voted to arrest him. Military troops outside
Beria's control took him to prison. He was put on trial, convicted
of being a British agent _ a dubious charge _ and of trying to
``elevate the Ministry of Internal Affairs above the party and
government in order to seize power.''
   Official accounts say he was executed Dec. 23, 1953, but some
Western historians believe he was put to death months earlier.
   Beria, who had been in the limelight for 14 years, quickly
became a non-person. The editors of the official Soviet
encyclopedia, for example, told readers to paste an article about
the Bering Strait over one about Beria.

<HEAD>Conservationists Oppose Dam for Thailand's Last Virgin Forest</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>

   ``This is our last
forest,'' said ranger Veerawat Dheeraprasart, pointing down a deep
river valley. ``If the dam is built here, all this will vanish, and
nobody will ever be able to replace it.''
   Veerawat, the chief ranger of this rich wildlife sanctuary
astride the border with Burma, is among thousands who have joined
what unquestionably has become the greatest environmental battle in
Thailand's history _ a fight to persuade the government not to
build a dam in Thailand's last virgin forest.
   In a country that once was jungle-carpeted and teeming with
wildlife, it is rare today to see a tract of undisturbed forest, an
unpolluted river, white-handed gibbons or free-ranging tigers.
   Anti-dam groups have held rock concerts and demonstrations, some
featuring life-like models of crucified animals, in their campaign.
   Newspapers are probing the issue in unprecedented detail. Former
Prime Minister Kukrit Pramoj says the government could face a mass
uprising if it approves the Nam Choan dam.
   The dam's proponents say Nam Choam needs to be built, in what is
the largest remaining area of protected forest in Southeast Asia,
to increase Thailand's energy supply by about 2 percent.
   The government's Electric Generating Authority of Thailand has
described the proposed, 580-megawatt dam as the ``last possible
exploitable source of hydro power'' in the country. It says it will
create a reservoir that would also help irrigate farm land and
assure water supplies in times of drought.
   The projected dam site is still hard to get to: a lurching,
nine-hour drive over dirt roads from Bangkok, the Thai capital,
followed by a four-hour jungle trek. When monsoons lash the
countryside, a three-day elephant ride offers the only access.
   But dam opponents claim construction of Nam Choan, with the
necessary approach roads, facilities and ensuing human
encroachment, would spell doom for what they say is also the last
area in Thailand large enough to ensure the survival of a wide
variety of wildlife.
   Found in the Thung Yai and the adjacent Huay Kha Khaeng
Sanctuary, an area about the size of Delaware, are large mammals,
such as elephant, gaur, tiger and clouded leopard; some 350 species
of birds, and a wide range of plant life. A number of the species
are classified as endangered in Thailand, some worldwide.
   Foreign conservation groups have written letters expressing
concern to the Thai government. In December, Britain's Prince
Philip, head of the World Wildlife Fund, urged an independent
environmental impact study before a final decision is reached. A
similar plea came from more than 1,300 conservationists and
scientists at the general assembly in February of the Swiss-based
International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural
Resources.
   The Electric Generating Authority maintains that Nam Choan would
degrade only 4 percent of the area. But ranger Veerawat, who has
served for 10 years in the sanctuary, contends the 47-mile-long dam
reservoir would not only eradicate a biologically vital riverine
valley but also disrupt the migration routes of animals, forcing
them into smaller habitats.
   Opponents also dispute the 4 percent degradation estimate,
saying that in Thailand roads built into remote, forested areas
have inevitably been followed by massive logging, with collusion
between businessmen and corrupt officials circumventing protective
legislation.
   Loggers are already felling the rich forests along the park
boundary.
   Pisit na Patalung, secretary-general of Wildlife Fund Thailand,
one of some 30 private organizations opposing the proposal, said
the dam issue has raised an environmental awareness among Thais.
Until recent years, the public appeared apathetic as the country's
once teeming wildlife was slaughtered and forests that blanketed
about 70 percent of the country a generation ago were reduced to
around 15 percent of total area today.
   The dam was first proposed in the early 1970s but plans were
shelved in 1983 in wake of protests and charges that environmental
impact studies were sloppy and improper.
   In 1986, the Electric Generating Authority asked that the
project be reconsidered and the government appointed a 40-man
committee headed by Deputy Prime Minister Thienchai Sirisamphan to
come up with a decision, which is expected soon.
   Some opponents believe government leaders will be impressed by
their arguments that Thailand now has enough alternate energy
sources, including offshore natural gas and lignite, to scrap the
dam proposal.
   Others, however, feel that too many key bureaucrats and
politicians are still little concerned over environmental problems.
   Another wildlife ranger, Sueb Nakhasathien, didn't sound
optimistic.
   ``Thais haven't yet put a price on the environment,'' he said.
``They don't realize that trees and water have a price, that
wildlife has a price.''

   When the farmworkers union failed
to persuade civilian officials to remove Mario Espinal as head of
the National Agrarian Institute, it took its case to the armed
forces chief.
   In going to Gen. Humberto Regalado and the military high command
the National Association of Honduran Campesinos made plain its
feeling, shared by others, that real power in Honduras does not lie
with the civilian government of President Jose Azcono Hoyo.
   The union is seeking Espinal's ouster from the Cabinet-level
post on grounds that he was stalling on agrarian reform.
   Espinal, nevertheless, remains in his post, confirmed once again
by Azcono Hoyo, and so far as is known Regalado has not acted.
   The campesinos' tactic was also used in the past few years by
bus drivers, teachers, business leaders and other sectors. It
underscores the powerful, even dominant, role still exercised by
the armed forces six years after Honduras restored civilian
government.
   Honduras has a long history of military governments, most
recently in the 1972-82 period.
   ``The people know where the source of power lies,'' said Anibal
Puerto, vice president of the Independent Human Rights Commission
and a critic of Azcona Hoyo's administration. Even government
supporters acknowledge the imbalance of power.
   ``Longstanding vices are not gotten rid of from the night to the
morning,'' said Joaquin Luna Mejia, president of the Honduran
Council on Private Enterprise.
   In an interview with The Associated Press, he said consolidation
of civilian power ``is coming along well.'' But he also observed,
``Here, as in all countries, interests are managed according to the
real powers. And if those powers are ambitious, we could fall again
into old vices.''
   ``No Honduran politician is going around saying, `We've got to
put the military back in the box,' because here the military never
has been in the box,'' said a Western diplomat.
   Compared to its neighbors, Honduras has enjoyed a degree of
stability and peace during a decade of regional conflict. But the
civil wars surrounding it have caused big problems.
   ``We have become a sanctuary,'' said Luna Mejia of Honduras'
tens of thousands of refugees from El Salvador, Nicaragua and
Guatemala, all torn by guerrilla wars. ``We are victims of the
entry into our country of irregular forces.''
   He referred to the Contras, who since 1982 have been trying to
topple the Sandinista government in Nicaragua. Until last year, a
Contra force estimated at 6,000 to 12,000 men had waged the better
part of the campaign from base camps in Honduras along the
Nicaraguan border. The rebels say most of their forces are now
inside Nicaragua.
   By congressional vote, the United States has cut off further
military aid, damaging prospects for long-term effectiveness inside
Nicaragua.
   ``There is a great concern that the Contras, if defeated, will
try to come back here,'' said Luna Mejia.
   Gen. Regalado told journalists in February he hoped the Contras
would be able to keep up their fight but said if they cannot, they
are not welcome back in Honduras.
   ``We have instructed immigration authorities along the border to
ensure that they do not return,'' he said.
   Puerto sees a connection between the Contra problem and
continued military preponderance in Honduran politics. Citing
Honduras' very strong alliance with Washington, he said: ``To whom
does the Honduran army owe its allegiance? Everything indicates it
owes its allegiance to the United States, and not to its own
people.''
   He said civilian government and close alignment with the United
States had done little to alleviate the poverty of hundreds of
thousands in this mainly agricultural country of 4.5 million people.
   ``People expected something different from civilian government,
but they got more of the same,'' Puerto said. ``If things continue
like this, people may lose faith in so-called democracy and look
for other less desirable forms of struggle.''
   Azcona Hoyo is past the midway point in the four-year term to
which he was inaugurated in January 1986. Elections are scheduled
in November 1989.

<TEXT>
   New discoveries by American
archaeologists indicate that humans could have settled on Cyprus
around 9000 B.C., 1,500 years earlier than previously thought.
   The finds also indicate that some species of ancient animals
survived here at least 1,000 years after they were believed to have
become extinct.
   If proven correct, the discoveries mean that Cyprus was one of
the earliest human settlements north of Africa, along with the
island of Corsica, also in the Mediterranean.
   ``If these dates are corroborated, the site will have provided
by far the earliest archaeological evidence for island colonization
anywhere in the Mediterranean,'' Dr. Stuart Swiny, director of the
Cyprus American Archaeological Research Institute, reported in a
recent lecture.
   Scientists had previously dated man's arrival on Cyprus around
7500 B.C.
   But archaelogists digging on a slope near the sprawling British
air base at Akrotiri on Cyprus' south coast recently found pygmy
hippopotamus and dwarf elephant bones, some mixed with shells,
flint and ash.
   Archaelogists believe the flint, an early cutting tool, was used
to slice meat from the animals. The ash indicated cooking fires.
   Carbon dating placed the remains at around 9000 B.C., a
millenium after those species of animals were believed to have died
out.
   Swiny said that the animals, common to many Mediterranean
islands thousands of years ago, were wiped out by climatic changes
during the last Ice Age that ended around 12,000 years ago.
   ``We thought ... these animals died out because of natural
causes _ they couldn't get enough food or enough water,'' Swiny
said in an interview after the lecture.
   ``But now it looks as if man was also responsible for wiping
them out.''
   The Akrotiri excavation is sponsored by the University of Nevada
and the American Schools of Oriental Research, which sponsors the
Cyprus American institute. The dig is under the direction of Dr.
Alan Simmons, who currently is in Nevada.
   The original discovery was made in 1980 by a British security
officer at Akrotiri, Maj. Brian Pile, then a lieutenant, while he
was training his men to seek out unusual objects.
   Underground excavation at the site, eight miles south of the
port city of Limassol, started last July and will continue this
summer.
   Swiny said the actual age of the site will remain questionable
until results of further tests are obtained.
   The finds are only some of the important discoveries unearthed
by American archaeologists in the last few years on Cyprus, the
center of trade routes between Europe and the Middle East for
centuries.
   The island is studded with relics of a history that spans more
than 10,000 years, during which more than a dozen civilizations,
including Achaean Greeks, Egyptians, Romans, Armenians, Venetians
and Ottoman Turks left their imprint.
   Americans are involved in six of the 20 digs currently being
made in the Greek-controlled southern part of Cyprus.
   The Cyprus American institute provides logistical help at one
sponsored by Brandeis University, of Waltham, Mass., at the Late
Bronze Age town of Kalavasos-Ayios Dhimitrios, 18 miles northeast
of Limassol.
   It was one of the biggest Bronze Age settlements on Cyprus and a
center for the island's ancient copper trade. Cyprus is the
Phoenician word for copper.
   Last summer archaelogists uncovered the remains of a 13th
century B.C. building, covering more than 10,764 square feet and
once at least two stories high, that was apparently destroyed by
fire.
   ``It's the biggest and most important building at the site and
one of the biggest of that period in Cyprus,'' said Dr. Alison
South Todd, the dig's co-director.
   ``We also found some inscriptions which are very rare to the
period in Cypro-Minoan script,'' she added.
   Cypro-Minoan, which resembles the script used in Minoan Crete
4,000 years ago, has never been deciphered.
   The presence of these inscriptions and the huge storage capacity
of the building, known as Building X, suggest it was either a
palace or a town hall.
   The storage room, more than 60 feet long and 24 feet wide,
consists of an outer wall and six stone pillars that once supported
the roof.
   The shards of at least 47 jars, some once as tall as six feet,
have been found. All apparently had been smashed in the fire. But
six intact jars were later discovered in pits below the floor.
   Todd discovered a tomb, considered one of the richest and best
preserved ever found on Cyprus, while digging an exploratory trench
out from the building.
   The oval-shaped tomb contained the skeletons of three young
women, a child about 3 years old and three infants. They apparently
had social status and wealth.
   The women had been buried with gold and silver jewelry, bronze
and bone artifacts, containers of wine with small cups inside and
cylindrical ivory cosmetic boxes.

<HEAD>Sofaer Burned and Tempered Since Becoming Top Lawyer at State</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Abraham D. Sofaer says he has been burned and
tempered since leaving the federal bench three years ago to become
the top lawyer at the State Department, a job that keeps him in the
heat of the battle over ``Star Wars,'' the Iran-Contra affair and
other controversies.
   ``If it helps to go through fire, I was helped,'' said Sofaer.
   Sofaer, 49, says he faces an uncertain future after President
Reagan leaves office, and is bitter about criticism he received
from lawmakers for what is called the ``broad interpretation'' of
the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.
   His interpreration, which would have allowed Reagan to
accelerate the development and testing of missile defenses using
lasers and other exotic weapons, provoked angry outcries from
members of Congress, who voted last year to bar the administration
from spending any money that would violate the ``restrictive
interpretation.''
   ``I hope that people consider me to be respectable and honorable
some day for my work,'' said Sofaer. ``But it has been very rough
to be attacked the way some people have attacked me,'' he said,
referring to Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., the chairman of the Armed
Services Committee, and Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., of the Foreign
Relations Committee.''
   ``Arms control is a very, very emotional subject,'' said Sofaer.
``I must say I was not clued in, in a sense, so it was a shock for
me to run into that degree of criticism. I feel it was very unfair
and unjustified.''
   He was also involved in questioning Israeli officials in the
case of Jonathan Pollard, who was sentenced to life in prison for
spying for Israel, and has facilitated contacts between the Israeli
government and the independent counsel investigating the
Iran-Contra affair.
   Sofaer, interviewed in his office, indicated he might oppose
efforts by the Iran-Contra independent counsel to subpoena
testimony from two Israelis involved in the clandestine sale of
arms to Iran, but that no final decision had been reached.
   As State Department legal adviser, Sofaer heads a team of about
100 lawyers, and by all accounts has a warm relationship with
Secretary of State George P. Shultz.
   Sofaer was born on May 6, 1938, in Bombay to a family of Iraqi
Jews, and came to this country in 1948. After attending law school,
he served as clerk to Supreme Court Associate Justice William J.
Brennan in 1966-67, taught law at Columbia University from 1969-79,
and was U.S. District Judge in New York from 1979-85.
   Sofaer gained national prominence as trial judge in the libel
case brought by former Israeli Defense Minister Ariel Sharon
against Time Magazine.
   In an landmark verdict engineered by Sofaer, the jury found that
Time made a factual error in reporting that a secret Israeli report
said Sharon had discussed revenge with Lebanese officials before
massacres in two Palestinian refugee camps. But the jury said Time
acted without malice, and was therefore not liable for monetary
damages.
   ``Because of the way I handled the verdict, it turned out to be
an important innovation in libel law,'' said Sofaer, who proudly
points out a sketch of the trial scene hanging on wall of his State
Department office.
   ``I liked being a judge very much,'' said Sofaer. ``I
particularly liked trials.''
   But, he said, ``I don't have any expectation of returning to the
bench. No one has invited me. I would certainly prefer that to
being unemployed. I don't expect to be unemployed.''
   The truth is, he said, ``it's a possibility that I will have a
lot of time on my hands'' after Reagan leaves office.
   Sofaer bridles at accusations that he devised legal rationales
for controversial Reagan policies, such as Star Wars.
   ``I have said no to several things, plans, kidnappings,
abductions, intrusions into the mail of other nations. There have
been lots of things I have opposed successfully,'' he said.
   Sofaer declined to disclose details of the kidnappings and
abductions he opposed, but said that none had gone forward. He did
support the abduction of Fawaz Younis, a Lebanese suspected in the
hijacking of a Royal Jordanian airliner on June 6, 1985.
   Younis was seized by U.S. agents in international waters off
Cyprus last Sept. 13 and brought to the United States.
   Of all Sofaer's actions, he probably will be remembered most for
his broad interpretation of the ABM treaty.
   ``What happened was that Senator Nunn and others jumped on this
issue before we were done with all our work,'' said Sofaer. ``The
reason we weren't done with our work was because the broad
interpretation was announced long before all the work was done, and
before any decision to implement was made.'' The interpretation
never was implemented.
   Robert C. McFarlane, then the White House National Security
adviser, disclosed the broad interpretation on a television news
show on Oct. 6, 1985.
   The ensuing controversy has centered on three main issues:
   _Whether the treaty barred development of space-based or mobile
anti-missile weapons based on ``other physical principles''' than
those which existed in 1972.
   _Whether remarks made by U.S. officials during ratification
hearings in 1972 bound future administrations.
   _ And whether the subsequent conduct of the superpowers bound
them to the restrictive interpretation.
   Sofaer said he was ``not amazed'' by the outcry following
McFarlane's revelations. ``I am not naive. I realize that these
people are motivated by their desire to win political battles, not
to win legal arguments.''
   Analysis of the ratification question had been prepared not by
Sofaer, but by junior attorneys on his staff, and was seized upon
by SDI opponents.
   ``I had said three times (the ratification analysis) was
inadequate and that I would have to come back and redo it. In fact,
I was in the midst of redoing it'' when McFarlane disclosed the
broad interpretation.
   Sofaer has completed his review of the ABM treaty, and sticks by
the broad interpretation, although Congress has closed the door for
the time being.
   ``Now would be the time for a real debate on the ABM treaty,''
he said.

   Labor relations in the airline industry used to
be fairly genteel and mutual accommodation was the rule. Then,
after deregulation, came a competitive crunch, mergers and
cost-cutting, and at many carriers snarl has replaced purr. A
reporter surveys today's turbulent scene.

<TEXT>
   The chairman of Pan American World Airways and
several senior executives are fired after a closed-door deal with
the airline's labor unions.
   Flight attendants trek to the suburban home of the chairman of
Trans World Airlines to register a protest about a strike that
ended nearly two years ago. More than 4,000 of them are still
looking to get their jobs back.
   Eastern Airlines, expecting a strike, is planning for a small
cargo carrier with non-union pilots to fly many of its passenger
planes, prompting charges of union busting from Eastern pilots and
mechanics.
   It's management and labor hardball, pure and simple.
   And it has become more frequent since the government eased out
of regulating the airline industry in the early 1980s. Along with
bitter competition among airlines have come increasingly
acrimonious relations with labor.
   In the wars between airline workers and their bosses, the
genteel atmosphere of bargaining _ common when the government had
its reins on the industry _ seems to have gone the way of the
propeller airplane.
   The hotbed of labor-management combat is at Eastern, the
Miami-based airline that has struggled with huge losses and almost
continuous labor turmoil for more than a decade. The company wants
major concessions. The unions say they're being pushed into a
strike.
   When word came recently that 26 Eastern jets were being leased
to a little known cargo operator named Orion Air, the news
unleashed a firestorm among many of Eastern's employees.
   It was no secret that Eastern, in the midst of stormy contract
talks with its mechanics, intends in event of a strike this summer
to have non-union Orion Air pilots fly the leased planes on
Eastern's most critical routes.
   ``It's an attempt to decimate Eastern's cockpit crews,'' says
Jack Bavis, head of the airline's pilots union. There are hints
from the parent 40,000-member Air Line Pilots Association of a
one-day nationwide shutdown of air service if Eastern ever uses the
Orion pilots.
   Thomas Matthews, Eastern's vice president for human relations,
calls the non-union Orion pilots ``our insurance coverage.''
   Corporate hardball.
   ``Prior to deregulation, for maybe 20 years, there was a posture
of accommodation. The unions accepted the companies and the
companies accepted the unions. Government generally was neutral or
slightly on the side of labor,'' says Frank Cassels, a professor of
industrial relations at Northwestern University.
   When labor wanted more money, the airlines often agreed. They
knew that the government would pass the increased costs on in the
form of higher fares. Today, airlines compete vigorously on fares
and have argued that one of their biggest problems has been high
labor costs. On average, 35 percent of airline operational costs
are for labor, according to the Air Transport Association.
   As a result, there has been ``a stage of outright hostility''
between labor and management in recent years, Cassels says.
   The tiff at Eastern may be the latest, but it's hardly the most
bitter standoff between labor and management in recent years.
   It was in September 1983 that Frank Lorenzo, chairman of Texas
Air Corp., the nemesis of airline labor, stopped negotiating with
the unions and shut down Continental Airlines. He declared
bankruptcy and shed the existing labor contracts.
   Three days later, Continental emerged with pilots flying the
same planes, but earning half the salary. Pilots and flight
attendants saw their strike fizzle.
   Today, Continental, which like Eastern is owned by Texas Air
Corp., is larger than ever, but many of its one-time well-paid
pilots are wearing the uniforms of other airlines and have lost
much of their seniority and pay.
   In early 1986 the flight attendants at TWA, faced with demands
for sharp salary cuts, walked off their jobs and onto the picket
lines. Today two-thirds of the 6,500 attendants who went on strike
are still grounded. While the attendants await a recall from TWA,
the airline continues to fly with a third fewer attendants who earn
less money and work longer hours.
   Would the flight attendants again choose a strike?
   Victoria Frankovich, president of the Independent Federation of
Flight Attendants, who led the 1986 walkout, mulls the question
over before answering. ``I don't think we had a choice,'' she says.
   Attendants at other airlines may not have lost their jobs in
recent years, but they have not been able to exert much clout.
Recently, flight attendants were pushed reluctantly into a
settlement at American and thought better of a strike at Northwest,
where negotiations continue.
   But labor _ at least in terms of the more-powerful pilots and
mechanics unions _ has flexed its muscles as well after several
years of back-pedaling and reeling from management demands.
   Consider the fired Pan Am executives.
   William T. Coleman, with the blessing of fellow members of the
Pan Am board of directors, resigned and sealed the deal with a
handshake last January. He then walked into the office of Pan Am
Chairman C. Edward Acker and informed Acker and Vice Chairman
Martin Shugrue they were fired.
   By the time the bloodletting was over, three senior vice
presidents, including Raymond Grebey, who was in charge of labor
relations, also were forced to resign.
   Acker is now in Bermuda ``assessing what he's going to do
next.'' Shugrue recently was hired by Texas Air Corp. to head its
Continental Airlines subsidiary.
   Richard Ferris can understand how they feel.
   A former hotel executive, Ferris had a dream of turning United
Airlines into a broad-based travel company. While at the helm of
UAL Inc., he bought two hotel chains and a rental car company and
envisioned one-stop shopping for transportation and lodging for
businessmen.

   The name of UAL Inc., was changed to Allegis Corp., to broaden
its appeal, but the moniker never caught on among Wall Street
investors. It also served to highlight claims by the pilots that
Ferris was siphoning money and attention from the airline.
   One evening last June, the company's board of directors demanded
Ferris' resignation. The pilots claimed responsibility.
   Although Ferris' fall may have been the result of a variety of
forces, most industry analysts agree that his empire began to fail
when the pilots union launched a $4.5 billion takeover bid, the
first effort by a union to buy an entire airline.
   ``Anyone who thinks that the pilots union or the machinists
today are the underdogs in one of these battles is clearly
mistaken,'' says Clark Onstad, a vice president for Texas Air.
   Indeed, pilots at many airlines have regained the momentum.
Their salaries are on the upswing. The dual wage scales _ a lower
one for newly hired pilots _ imposed by American Airlines in 1983
and widely copied by other carriers is showing signs of erosion.
New contracts call for a more rapid merging of the two scales.
   The Air Line Pilots Association, caught unprepared and
disorganized by the Continental bankruptcy, has vowed never to be
left so vulnerable again. Stiff increases in dues for its 40,000
members have brought $40 million into a war chest that continues to
grow.
   The unions also say they will continue to take their fights into
airline board rooms, citing their successes at United, Pan Am and
at TWA where the pilots formed an unusual alliance with corporate
raider Carl Icahn two years ago to fend off Lorenzo's Texas Air.
   Ironically, that set the stage for Lorenzo to buy Eastern, where
labor war remains rife. Nevertheless, declares ALPA president Henry
Duffy, ``Labor unions will continue to increase their Wall Street
connections.''
   ``Certainly in this day and age you won't get (salary or work
rule) givebacks,'' says Robert Joedicke, airline analyst for
Shearson Lehman Bros. But he adds quickly that he wouldn't ``put
the unions in the catbird seat'' just yet.
   Nowhere is that more true than at Texas Air, the Houston-based
airline whose Continental and Eastern subsidiaries account for 20
percent of the industry's market and which has led the trend toward
lower airline fares.
   Lorenzo made his mark in 1972 when he bought debt-ridden Texas
International and turned it around by unleashing ``peanut fares''
when business was slow. His low-fare strategy continued with New
York Air in 1981 and with the newly emerged Continental two years
later.
   But to play out the strategy, Lorenzo had to cut costs, a direct
attack on labor.
   ``Does Frank like unions? That's not the issue,'' says Onstad,
Lorenzo's point man in Washington. ``The issue is how does
management get the flexibility to deal in a deregulated environment
that Frank is dealing with.''
   Onstad says that some members of the machinists union,
especially ground workers who haul baggage, are earning salaries _
an average of $43,000 a year with fringes _ that are way too high.
   When Continental emerged with a non-union work force in 1983 it
had cut its pilots' pay in half overnight. Continental workers in
1986 earned on average $28,200 a year, the lowest in the industry,
and better than a third lower than its chief competitors.
   Mechanics at Continental earn $16 an hour base salary, $4 an
hour lower than new contracts agreed to at United and USAir,
according to the machinist union.
   In the third quarter of last year, Continental's labor costs
were 22 percent of total operating costs, compared to about 35
percent industrywide.
   But Texas Air executives argue that low costs are needed if the
airline is to survive and continue to provide the low fares that
have opened air travel to millions of people.
   Texas Air Corp., lost $466 million last year and its executives
put much of the blame on costs related to absorbing People Express
and the labor unrest at Eastern, where losses were $182 million.
   Eastern president Philip Bakes has said he wants $490 million in
labor concessions at the struggling airline. Union leaders
countered that they have given back too much already and accuse
Lorenzo of trying to dismember the airline.
   Jack Bavis, the pilot's leader at Eastern, says that since
Lorenzo bought the airline he has:
   _Sold Eastern's valuable computer reservation system to Texas
Air.
   _Cleared the way for Continental to fly Eastern's profitable
Latin America routes if Lorenzo chooses to.
   _Sold six Eastern Airbus A-300s and a McDonnell Douglas DC-10 to
Continental.
   _Tried to spin-off Eastern's moneymaking Northeast air shuttle
operation under a separate subsidiary.
   ``He's taking the crown jewels, spinning them off and making
them part of Texas Air,'' says Charlie Bryan, the chief of the
International Association of Machinists at Eastern.
   Onstad suggests the Eastern negotations have industrywide
implications.
   ``We are now the last of the low-cost operators. People focus
all of their attention on Texas Air,'' Onstad says. ``If the unions
can defeat us, low fares go away and the pressure on wages at other
airlines go away.''

   It's been called America's most hidden problem.
An estimated one in five adults in the United States can't read
beyond the fourth-grade level. But help is available through a
growing network of organizations dedicated to stamping out
illiteracy. Two of the most successful groups are based in
Syracuse, N.Y.

   Joseph Everson always feared ``signing
away his life.'' Even more, he dreaded revealing that he couldn't
read.
   Then, about four years ago, Everson received a letter from a
local hospital saying he owed a big bill for recent treatments. His
nightmare had become reality.
   ``I told them I had Medicaid to take care of it, but they said I
had agreed to pay the bill,'' Everson says. ``They said I had
signed my name on the dotted line.''
   Fortunately, the 42-year-old Everson was able to settle the
dispute, but only after admitting to hospital officials that he
really didn't know what he had signed because he couldn't read.
That was the catalyst Everson needed to seek help.
   No longer would Everson have to rely on his wife, children or
siblings to explain service applications and contracts to him or
read him the newspaper to him. Above all, he would be able to do
the thing he had longed for most _ to be able to read his Bible for
the sermons he gave to his Church of God in Christ congregation at
Payton Memorial Temple in Syracuse.
   Over the years, family members had read the Bible to him.
   ``At first it was hard, but after a while I began to know by
heart most of the verses I would use in my sermons,'' the minister
says. ``I might not know the exact words, but I knew the exact
feeling and that was easy to translate.''
   Everson says it's painful to admit you can't read, ``But it
opens a new way of life and you have to admit it to get help.''
   Living in Syracuse, it was easy for Everson to find help. The
city is the headquarters of two of the most successful
organizations in the fight against illiteracy _ Laubach Literacy
International and Literacy Volunteers of America, both part of a
national campaign being conducted by Project Literacy United States
(PLUS).
   Laubach is the older of the two groups, founded in 1955 by the
late Frank C. Laubach, a missionary who spent 40 years traveling
the globe teaching people how to read and write their native
languages. Laubach became internationally recognized for his
approach to illiteracy, the ``Laubach Method.'' Today, LLI has 750
councils in 45 states as well as an international program and
publishing division.
   Syracuse housewife Ruth Colvin was inspired by Laubach, who
taught at Syracuse University in the 1950s, and in 1962 she began a
basement organization speaking out against illiteracy and teaching
people to read. Today, nearly 300 LVA community affiliates comprise
a network spanning 35 states. The organization has doubled in size
in the last three years.
   Together, the two groups are responsible for teaching millions
of Americans to read. Last year alone, both estimated they taught
more than 100,000 adults how to read.
   Sadly, that only scratches the surface. The U.S. Department of
Education says 27 million adults in the United States _ one in
every five _ can't read beyond a fourth-grade level.
   In some cases the consequences have been tragic. A New York City
mother fed undiluted formula to her nine-day old infant because she
couldn't read the directions. The baby died.
   The government estimates illiteracy costs the United States
about $225 billion annually in welfare payments, lost job
productivity, unrealized earnings and tax revenues and crime.
   While illiteracy is predominantly a problem of poor America, its
victims include bankers, real estate brokers, firefighters,
farmers, laborers and others, according to Colvin.
   ``Don't equate ignorance with illiteracy. People learn to get
by,'' she says. ``They contrive ways to work around it because they
are too embarrassed to let anyone know. Some people have remarkable
memories, others fake poor eyesight and have others do their
reading.''
   However, the demands of today's high-tech society have made it
harder.
   ``It's a national embarrassment,'' says Peter Waite, director of
American programs for Laubach. ``Illiteracy is America's most
hidden problem, and its most solvable problem given adequate
resources. Really, there's no good reason people who want to learn
how to read and write can't do it. There are a dozen proven
programs out there now.''
   Laubach and Literacy Volunteers each have their own approach to
teaching. Both are self-paced individual programs that specialize
in mobilizing volunteers to serve as tutors. But Laubach teaches
reading through a phonics-based system keyed on letter and word
sound association, while Literacy Volunteers use a four-part method
that incorporates phonics.
   The Literacy Volunteers approach also takes advantage of
language experience, using the student's hobbies or interests to
draw on as a basis to teach new words.
   Sight words and patterned words are other reading techniques
employed by Literacy Volunteers. Sight words are those so basic to
reading and encountered so often that they are best learned by
sight, not by sounding them out, such as `the,' `have,' and `were.'
In the patterned words technique, which concentrates on vowel
sounds, words are taught by learning families of words, such as
`man,' `can,' `fan.'
   ``It hasn't been easy, but I don't know why I didn't try and
learn sooner,'' says Everson, who wants to become an LVA tutor as
soon as he becomes proficient. ``The longer you wait, the worse it
gets as far as dealing with the problem. Learning to read is like
finding yourself.''
   Waite and Colvin say Everson's story is a familiar one.
   ``It's interesting if you ask a student whose fault it is they
can't read, invariably they will say it's their fault,'' Waite
says. ``They blame themselves. But there are always extenuating
circumstances they can't control. Someone else's fault: a teacher,
a parent, a school system. They drop behind and then get caught in
the cycle.''
   In recent years, the federal and local governments, local school
systems, libraries, churches, businesses and community groups have
entered the endeavor, starting up programs at various levels to
assist people in learning how to read.
   ``There's no indication the problem is getting any worse,''
Waite says. ``However, it doesn't appear to be getting any better.''

   A museum in southeastern Mexico offers clues to
three civilizations that predate the Aztecs. Among other things,
there is evidence that these ancient people probably perceived the
earth as round, designed remarkably accurate calendars and had an
advanced knowledge of mathematics and astronomy.

   Huge carved stone heads, tiny clay figures
and thousands of other artifacts at a museum here tell a strange
story about three civilizations that flourished long before
Columbus discovered America.
   It's about the Olmecs, Totonacas and Huaxtecs, who inhabited a
long stretch of coast on the Gulf of Mexico.
   The fascinating and sometimes gruesome story is told vividly at
the Museum of Xalapa, which specializes in the region's
archaeological treasures.
   A lot is still unknown about the three civilizations. They are
believed to have been part of a series of migrations from Asia that
started about 35,000 years ago across the Bering Strait, by way of
Alaska, and lasted several millenia.
   But, says museum director Fernando Winfield Capitaine, ``as new
finds are made and studies of old ones shed new light, the results
may rewrite quite a few history books.
   ``We don't know what their language was, or what they even
called themselves,'' he adds. ``Even the names we use for them are
false and relatively new. They are `nahuatl' names, the trading
language of the Aztecs, which didn't even exist at the time.''
   Only 3,000 of the museum's 29,000 pieces are on display for lack
of space. They tell how these people performed human sacrifices,
probably perceived the earth as round, designed remarkably accurate
calendars and had an advanced knowledge of mathemathics and
astronomy, among other things.
   The artifacts range in size from a tiny Olmec carving of a rain
god 4 inches high, to huge stone altars. The museum's centerpiece
is a monolithic head 9 feet high and weighing 16 tons, carved from
andesite rock.
   Now housed in a new $3 million set of modern buildings covering
14,400 square yards and surrounded by eight acres of wooded park,
the museum is part of the Veracruz state university in Xalapa, the
state's capital 74 miles northwest of the port of Veracruz.
   The Olmecs, Totonacas and Huaxtecas based their agriculture on
corn, frijole beans and squash, supplementing their diets with dog
meat, river fish and wild animals and birds, which they seasoned
with chili peppers, herbs and other spices.
   Both their weapons and their tools were crude, mostly made out
of stone or wood, and no one is sure how they carved such huge
stone statues. But their civilizations were surprisingly advanced
for its time.
   In his guidebook ``Master Works of the Xalapa Museum,'' Mexican
anthropolgist Alfonso Medellin Zenil says it's possible the Olmecs
were the first to make paper out of wood pulp in America.
   Archaeologists believe the political organization was more of a
loose coalition of small towns or city-states than one big
government entity. But their influence spread far and wide and some
of it survives in present-day Mexico.
   They could read and write and knew what a wheel was, but didn't
use it, probably because they had no draft animals. Their ancestors
had hunted them all out of existence, including the ancient
American horse and the elephant.
   They spun and wove fibers, including cotton. They tailored their
clothes, wore earrings and jewelry, blackened their teeth with
natural tar for cosmetic purposes and made rubber from the rubber
tree, which is native to the region.
   Being cross-eyed was considered a sign of beauty.
   By polishing metallic rock, the Olmecs made flat mirrors which
they hung over their chests as jewelry, or concave ones, which they
used to light fires.
   They made music on drums, whistles, ocarinas, clay flutes and
other instruments. They traveled and traded extensively, as far
west as the Pacific Coast and as far south as El Salvador in
Central America, spreading their cultures and acquiring new ones.
   As a result, cacao _ the bean from which chocolate is derived
and is native to the Gulf Coast _ became a popular currency for
trade throughout pre-Columbian Mexico.
   At first, they cremated or simply buried their dead, but later
they built little pyramidal rock mounds to mark the sites. Later
still, they built the monumental pyramids that survive today.
   They played a ceremonial sport with a rubber ball, which was a
combination of soccer and basketball. The winning team was
afterwards beheaded as a sacrifice, usually to a sun god, although
some authorities claim it was the losers who lost their heads.
   Other victims had their hearts cut out atop some pyramid or
other sacred altar. Some were skinned alive and priests donned
their skins to dance before Xipe Totec, the ``god of the flayed,''
in a fertility rite to mark the beginning of spring.
   Prisoners of war often had their hands severed so the victors
could acquire their strength, skill and magic.
   Worship was centered on the sun, the moon and the planet Venus.
   All three cultures worshipped the jaguar as a sun god and
hunting the animal was forbidden, except for its skins, which
priests wore during sacred ceremonies. The jaguar was often
depicted in partly human form.
   It was said that in times long past a woman mated with a jaguar,
giving birth to a ``were-jaguar.'' Archeologists believe this
explains the Olmecs' morbid fascination with dwarfs, hunchbacks and
other human deformations.
   Little is known about Venus, usually depicted as the lesser of
the three, except that Ehecatl Quetzalcoatl, god of the hurricane
and other winds, and Xochiquetzal, goddess of love and the spring,
were probably associated with it.
   The most fascinating of the moon deities was Tlasolteotl, the
Totonaca goddess of confession, protectress of childbirth and
advocate of illicit love and passions. She encouraged people to sin
so that she could later absolve them.
   Sinners had to confess to her, so that she could devour the
``rubbish or spiritual garbage'' that weighed upon them.
   ``But,'' says Winfield, ``only one confession was allowed in a
lifetime, and people tried to put it off as much as they could,
since there was no forgiveness for a second offender.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ They are on the radical fringe of the
environmental movement, labeled terrorists by some for their
practice of ``monkeywrenching,'' sabotaging the equipment of
loggers and developers. But Earth First! founder David Foreman
compares his style of civil disobedience with that of Mohandas
Gandhi or Dr. Martin Luther King.

   From their seats in a Juneau conference
hall, some 400 people tip their noses toward the rafters and let
out a long, high-pitched howl.
   With scarcely a giggle, they howl their scorn at
wilderness-wrecking development, howl their devotion to David
Foreman's controversial brand of environmentalism.
   Wolf mimicry is among the more benign of Foreman's
attention-grabbing tricks, which some call criminal, others call
visionary.
   It's the stuff of Earth First!, the self-styled radical fringe
of environmentalism founded by Foreman in 1980 when he decided the
movement was boring itself out of existence.
   Since then, Earth Firsters have been putting themselves on front
pages, infuriating loggers and frustrating law enforcement
officials with their ``civil disobedience'' protests.
   They shackle themselves to trees, stage sit-ins before bulldozer
blades, pour sand in the engines of earthmovers and pound spikes in
tree trunks to mangle loggers' saws.
   They call the practice monkeywrenching.
   In the eyes of the Alaska Loggers Association, Foreman and his
followers are ``terrorists.'' Foreman prefers to compare himself to
Mohandas Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr.
   He says sabotaging equipment isn't terrorism because it doesn't
hurt people.
   ``I think that I believe in non-violence, too,'' he says.
``Pulling up survey stakes, putting sand in the crank case of a
bulldozer, those aren't violent.''
   Though opponents often link Earth First! to an accident in
California in which a sawmill worker was hurt by a tree spike that
struck a saw blade, Foreman says conservationists were not involved.
   Foreman, who makes his home in Tucson, Ariz., has been arrested
several times. Dozens of Earth First! members were charged with
criminal mischief and similar crimes for anti-logging protests in
Oregon last summer.
   Over the past few years they've blockaded oil wells, occupied
uranium mines and joined Greenpeace at nuclear test protests in
Nevada.
   If people see him going to jail for his cause, Foreman says,
maybe they'll take environmentalism more seriously.
   ``Sometimes you've got to put your body on the line,'' Foreman
says. ``Face it. There are a lot of madmen and madwomen out there
destroying the earth. Why shouldn't we be mad about it? Why
shouldn't we be passionate?
   ``We need to scare people. It's not our job to come up with the
final, politically acceptable solution. We're advocates.''
   For all its radical tone, Foreman's activism has its
underpinnings in conventional political strategy.
   At a how-to workshop on promoting the environmental cause, he
explained he doesn't really expect the general public to adopt all
his views. By presenting an extreme, he simply hopes to shift the
ultimate compromise his way.
   ``There are rational solutions, but others should find them,''
he said. ``I see very few politicians respond to facts. I see
politicians respond to votes, to public opinion. We compromise and
we sort of water down our opinions before ever speaking them.''
   He tells a class how to use self-deprecating jokes _ as
politicians do _ to make the audience think they're regular guys.
   He advises his students not to dread a knowledgeable audience.
``If you relax, you can sound like you know a lot more about
something than you do.''
   Passing out pamphlets? Dress up in animal costumes and stage a
skit, he says. You'll be harder to ignore.
   And when you're really in an adversarial position, Foreman says,
remember ``They can't beat you up quite as much if they're
laughing.''
   It was Foreman's talent for humor and drama that brought him an
invitation to speak at the Alaska Environmental Assembly's recent
conference in Juneau.
   The assembly got the theater it wanted as he sermonized.
   First came the doomsday predictions: ``1988 is the greatest
biological crisis since evolution began 3{ billion years ago,''
Foreman says. ``By the year 2,000 the only large mammals left will
be the ones we allow to exist.''
   Then the promise of salvation: This generation is the most
important that ever lived, he says, the generation that can halt
environmental destruction.
   Then the underlying moral: Biocentrism, Foreman says, is the
most important philosophy of man. It holds that you can't change
one part of the world without affecting every other, that a crab in
the mud has as much right to life as a man.
   And, finally, the call to give up worldly goods, to choose
wilderness over drinking more Coke, buying more VCRs, figuring the
value of something ``by how many greasy bills you can pile up next
to it.''
   Forget about building more highways and bring back the bison
instead, Foreman says. Look beneath skyscrapers and opera houses to
see ``a vision of the world the way it could be.''
   Be an animal, he advises, closing with the howl, 400 voices
strong.
   So how does Foreman suggest modernized Americans get back to the
bison?
   ``I don't have all the answers,'' he says after the speech. ``I
think that's one of the problems, that we think we have to have all
the answers. But I want to energize people to ask the questions.''
   Foreman says giving up all modern ways for an ecologically sound
Stone Age is not the idea. He'd settle for a shift toward the
primitive side.
   ``I believe in compromise and balance. We're protecting
something like 3 percent of the land of the United States as
wilderness. I don't think that's balance. I would be satisfied with
20 or 30 percent.''
   The conservationists who work to reach those compromises
sometimes seem unsure how to react to Foreman's flamboyance.
   Some Juneau environmentalists were titillated. ``Did you know
you're sitting behind a terrorist?'' one lobbyist stage-whispered a
row behind Foreman, who was giggling at the furor his visit had
stirred.
   Loggers and state Natural Resources Commissioner Judy Brady
boycotted the meeting because of Foreman's presence.
   Others mixed admiration with a tinge of embarrassment.
   Bart Koehler, a leader of the Southeast Alaska Conservation
Coalition, was Foreman's partner in founding Earth First!, but
returned to more conventional environmental groups in 1982.
   Though they've been best friends since 1973 and remain so,
Koehler doesn't like to be reminded of his ties to Foreman.
   Foreman isn't offended. Being environmentalism's bad boy, he
says, has its political purpose.
   ``I think we help other environmental groups look mainstream and
reasonable _ which they are _ but I think we've helped move them
toward taking a stronger position,'' he says.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Many of the stories of the late John Steinbeck
have become the plot lines for movies, but sometimes the author's
artistry has been lost in the translation. Now his sons and some of
their friends have formed a movie company to try to faithfully
adapt their father's works to feature films.

   A realist in the video age, writer Thom
Steinbeck believes that film offers him the best opportunity to
carry on in his famous father's footsteps.
   The son of the late John Steinbeck, one of America's best-known
writers, is one of the founders of a new movie company dedicated to
faithfully adapating the works of famous authors, starting with
Steinbeck.
   Sitting in the secluded Catskill Mountain studio of artist
Eugene Gregan, his film company partner, Thom Steinbeck explains
his plans for Steinbeck Films Inc.
   ``Our concern is with craftsmanship. Steinbeck spent a lot of
time on his work,'' says Thom, who frequently refers to his father
by the family name. ``We're going to spend as much time on his work
as he did.''
   With dark, combed-back hair, ruddy complexion and piercing blue
eyes, the 43-year-old Thom resembles the prize-winning author who
wrote ``The Grapes of Wrath,'' ``East of Eden'' and other classics
of American literature.
   Following years of struggle to make a living as an author, John
Steinbeck gained national attention in the early 1930s as a writer
who could masterfully depict the plight of the disenfranchised and
downtrodden. He produced 19 works of fiction, eight of non-fiction
and also plays, a documentary and a screenplay.
   His 1939 book ``The Grapes of Wrath,'' about the hopeless
migration of Dust Bowl farmers, won a Pulitzer Prize. It also was
one of the many Steinbeck stories adapted for film.
   In 1962, six years before his death at age 66, Steinbeck was
awarded the Nobel Prize for literature.
   Steinbeck's two sons, Thom and John IV, are writers themselves
and now partners in the film venture.
   ``We chose Steinbeck to work with first because there've been
very few accurate interpretations of his work that have been
translated into film,'' Thom says. ``In many cases, companies have
chosen pieces that are far too long for a 125-page script, which is
usually standard.''
   The results, Thom says, have been films which cut the writing of
his father and others to fit the filmmaking ``formula.''
   ``On Broadway, the author owns the stage. In Hollywood, he's
lucky if he can get invited to a couple of parties,'' says Thom,
who recently completed the screenplay of his father's novel, ``In
Dubious Battle'' for a Los Angeles film company, Zupnick
Enterprises Inc.
   It's not that the senior Steinbeck minded seeing his writing
adapted for film.
   ``Steinbeck is not like a lot of authors,'' Gregan says,
``because he thought visually and wrote visually. Some writers are
totally verbal. Steinbeck is easy to intepret to film because he
saw it that way. He loved movies. All his best friends were
involved in movies.''
   Thom says his father knew and influenced the writers who adapted
his stories for film while he was alive. ``It's the films that have
taken place since his death that I think he would roll over in his
grave about,'' he says.
   The company plans to make full-length feature films based on
``Travels With Charley in Search of America,'' Steinbeck's last
book, and ``The Moon Is Down,'' a story about Nazi occupation of a
Norwegian town in World War II.
   Short stories from ``The Long Valley'' and ``The Pastures of
Heaven'' are also slated for production, with ``The Long Valley''
scheduled for release in about a year.
   ``We want to stay very close to the novel,'' Gregan says, ``so
that eventually what people can have is a videotape library of John
Steinbeck's work.''
   If translating books to film is so difficult, then why not leave
Steinbeck's efforts in their purest form?
   ``Because people don't read any more,'' Thom says with a laugh.
``And the only way I can start them to read is by doing accurate
interpretations of Steinbeck's work so that they might be enticed
to read it.''
   Some of Steinbeck's work that is already on film shouldn't be
duplicated, Thom says.
   ``Who could play Tom Joad better than Fonda?'' Thom said of
actor Henry Fonda who starred in ``The Grapes of Wrath.''
   For the last 2{ years, the Steinbeck brothers and Gregan have
talked of starting a film company. Thom spent last summer and fall
in a cabin near Gregan's mountain home and the wheels began to turn.
   Three other partners, whom Thom didn't want to identify, are
also involved.
   The firm will have offices in New York City and Monterey,
Calif., where Thom makes his home and where his father lived off
and on.
   Viking Penquin Inc. has continued to print Steinbeck books in
hardbound and paperback editions. The largest printings since 1986
have been 280,000 paperback copies of ``The Grapes of Wrath'' and
119,500 of ``East of Eden.''
   Professor Ted Hayashi, president of the International Steinbeck
Society at Ball State University in Muncie, Ind., believes there is
an ample market worldwide for the films.
   ``Whenever somebody makes a film out of Steinbeck literature, I
want to see it,'' Hayashi says, though he concedes that some people
have been disappointed in the past when Steinbeck stories were
adapted for film.
   ```Cannery Row'' independently was a very enjoyable movie, but
if you're serious about comparing movies and literary work, a lot
of scholars were disappointed,'' Hayashi says. ``Film is a very
independent art after all.''
   The logo of the film company is a haunting sketch of the elder
Steinbeck, done by Gregan. But what would Thom say in response to
critics who might accuse him of trying to profit off of his
father's name?
   ``I make money off my father's name right now,'' he said in a
blunt, matter-of-fact tone. ``My name is Steinbeck. I also share in
the literary estate with my brother and stepmother.
   ``It's a little bit like inheriting a grocery store. You've got
one of two choices: letting the fruit rot on the shelves and not
pay attention to it or you can see it as an ongoing business.
Certainly a literary estate is an ongoing business.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Five years after he became conductor of the City
of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra at age 25, Simon Rattle thought it
could become Britain's best. At 33, he hasn't changed his mind.
Rattle, who is attracting a lot of attention in the world of music,
is now bringing the orchestra to America to show it off in 11
cities.

   Britain's Simon Rattle, who has become known as
one of the world's most exciting young conductors, is introducing
his City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra to American audiences for
the first time.
   The orchestra, which Rattle believes is ``well on the way'' to
becoming Britain's finest, will tour 11 U.S. cities from March 29
to April 17.
   Rattle has made his mark in the music world without joining the
baton-wielding jet set or accepting a top job with a prestigious
orchestra. In fact, he regularly turns down offers to appear as
guest conductor.
   The 33-year-old native of Liverpool, England, prefers to
concentrate on his job as conductor of the Birmingham orchestra and
his work as principal guest of the Los Angeles Philharmonic.
   The curly haired, bright-eyed Rattle took over the Birmingham
orchestra in 1980, at age 25. He plans to stay a while, already
making plans for the orchestra into the next century.
   Before he went to Birmingham, Rattle was the No. 2 conductor
with the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic and the BBC Scottish Symphony
and did a lot of guest conducting. ``In some ways,'' he says, ``I
was following a more conventional career pattern than I seem to be
now.''
   Rattle is not without his fans in the United States.
   In the words of critic Andrew Porter in the New Yorker magazine,
Rattle is considered a first-rate conductor who ``inspires players
and elates audiences.''
   Just before Rattle conducted the Los Angeles Philharmonic in his
1985 New York debut, critic Nicholas Kenyon wrote in The New York
Times: ``The biggest surprise about this debut by the most
brilliantly successful conductor of the younger generation in
Britain _ the perception, power and clarity of whose work has been
acclaimed internationally _ is not the age at which it is occurring
but the fact that it did not happen long ago. Mr. Rattle has been
invited to the Metropolitan Opera and he has been invited to the
New York Philharmonic. He has turned both down.''
   During a recent stopover in New York, Rattle was asked if an
offer from a prestigious orchestra would lure him away from
Birmingham.
   ``I've been given enough offers that haven't,'' he answers,
declining to elaborate. It is known that in 1984 he rejected an
invitation from the Los Angeles Philharmonic to become its music
director.
   ``The work in Birmingham is so satisfying,'' he says. ``And it
is also unfinished. Now we're planning a festival. Starting in
1991, we'll do spring festivals, each year concentrating on the
music of one decade of 20th century music.
   ``In 2000 we'll just about have caught up with ourselves. In
1999, when we're dealing with the music of the '90s, we will surely
be playing music by people who now are schoolchildren.''
   Rattle said in 1985 that he thought the Birmingham Symphony
could become the best in Britain.
   ``I think they're well on the way,'' he says now.
   ``My wife tells me I always refer to the City of Birmingham
Symphony Orchestra as `us,' which is true,'' he says. ``We consider
that we've been able to grow together. They play beautifully as a
unit. There's a degree of listening to each other as an ensemble,
like chamber music playing, that is unique in Britain.''
   Though he has made a lot of music documentaries for television,
surveying trends or about a particular composer's work, Rattle says
he isn't a TV ``natural'' like Andre Previn.
   ``Andre created an extraordinary new audience in England for
music. He can talk to the camera as though it was his best friend.
It's something I admire enormously. I can't do that.''
   Rattle's father briefly led a jazz band. While he appreciates
jazz, the younger Rattle knew from the time he entered the Royal
Academy of Music at age 16 that he would conduct. He thought he'd
have to be an instrumentalist _ he was a percussionist _ first,
whose conducting career would only be beginning ``about now.''
   Conducting happened sooner because Rattle won a conetst. ``I
went in simply because if you got in the final 10, there was a
chance to work with the Bournemouth Symphony,'' he says. ``I was 19
and I'd never conducted a professional orchestra.
   ``I still think I only won because it never occurred to me that
I might win and I had no anxiety. The final piece I conducted was
Strauss' `Don Juan,' which takes 17 minutes. There were 20 minutes
to rehearse it. At that age, it was probably just as well. I didn't
have time to get up the noses of the musicians.''
   Studying conducting, Rattle says, he learned that ``there's as
much connection with what your baton does to the orchestra as to
what a violinist's bow does to the strings. All motions a conductor
makes affect the orchestra, even if you don't want them to.
   ``The reason a conductor begins to get halfway competent around
50 or 60 is that he probably has had as much time in front of an
orchestra then as the average 20-year-old violinist has had playing
his instrument.
   ``At a certain point, to be able to communicate what you know,
you have to know your musicians. That's the reason I went down the
road of working very hard with one orchestra.''
   One of the reasons Rattle limits his guest conducting is that he
and his American wife, soprano Elise Ross, and 4-year-old son
Alexander, known as Sasha, like to spend time together.
   ``I'm not one of those musicians who wants to live a life which
is entirely the musician part,'' he says. ``I'd like to be able to
explore the richness of life. There is enough else going on in the
world to put music in perspective.''

   When the time came for President Lincoln's
secretary of war to point out Gen. Robert E. Lee's route into
Pennsylvania, he had to seek help from a private.
   ``We were filming a scene and we couldn't find the place on the
map,'' says Sam Waterston, who portrays Abraham Lincoln in the NBC
miniseries ``Gore Vidal's Lincoln.'' ``The only person who knew the
route was a private.''
   The private was one of the Civil War re-enactors who served as
Union and Confederate soldiers for the four-hour adaptation of
Vidal's book about life inside the White House.
   `They were just an enormous resource in helping the rest of us,
who were just pretending, to feel authentic,'' says Waterston. ``I
remember riding down a street and there were small groups of Union
soldiers along the way. They came to attention as I passed. They
did it according to Civil War drill.
   ``They were immensely supportive of the rest of us. They saved
us more than once when we needed information, like with Lee's
route.''
   ``Lincoln,'' which will be televised on Sunday and Monday, also
stars Mary Tyler Moore as Mary Todd Lincoln, John Houseman as Gen.
Winfield Scott, Richard Mulligan as Secretary of State William
Seward, John McMartin as Ohio Sen. Salmon P. Chase, who hopes to
become president, and Deborah Adair as Chase's overly ambitious
daughter, Kate.
   In an ironic twist on history, the Washington scenes were filmed
in Richmond, Va., the capital of the Confederacy. The Confederate
Home for Needy Women, built as a replica of the original White
House, was used as the executive mansion. Petersburg, where Lee put
up his last defense before surrendering at Appomattox, was also
used for some Washington scenes.
   ``The side benefit of that was that everyone had an enormous
interest in the Civil War,'' Waterston says. ``One man came up to
me and said, `If you were the man you're pretending to be I'd want
to shoot you.' We got into quite a discussion.''
   Waterston says he had not seen any Lincoln portrayals in a long
time and had purposely avoided looking at any.
   ``Henry Fonda seems to me to be the closest to what I imagine he
was really like,'' Waterston says. Fonda appeared in ``Young Mr.
Lincoln'' in 1939. ``But I didn't see anything. The danger is that
you'll be influenced. In college a friend was doing `Richard III'
and made the fatal mistake of seeing Laurence Olivier's film about
five days before we opened. He couldn't put it out of his head.''
   Waterston says he read a lot of books on Lincoln, including one
by William Safire, one-time speech writer for President Richard M.
Nixon.
   ``If Safire meddles with the facts, he tells you how,''
Waterston says. ``If he's interpreting, he tells you the opposing
views so you don't have to read 17 different books to get all the
viewpoints.''
   Waterston says when he read Vidal's book he thought it would
make good television. ``It's the Civil War as seen from the White
House, which is different from the usual way of looking in from the
outside. It shows how Lincoln responded to the pressure of events.
I think what's most extraordinary was that he was not perfectly
attuned to every situation.
   ``But when the chips were down he was up to the occasion. That's
what people have found remarkable about him _ how could a man of
his background find the skills to manage a war on a scale that no
one had ever imagined. His law partner once described him as a man
who read less and thought more than anyone he had ever known.''
   Waterston also spent time trying to understand the man. ``Edwin
Stanton called him `the Illinois gorilla,''' he says. ``It
certainly takes a breadth of mind to hire that same man as your
secretary of war.''
   Waterston, who is somewhat Lincolnesque in build and looks, says
he has wanted to portray Lincoln for a long time.
   ``There ought to be some reward for looking like this,'' he
says. ``I thought he was a fascinating man. You can't help but be
in awe of this combination of high principle and amazing public
skills.''
   It was Waterston's third opportunity to work with Mary Tyler
Moore. Previously, they were in ``Finnegan Begin Again'' and ``Just
Between Friends.'' He says he found her portrayal of Mrs. Lincoln
as a woman on the edge ``very bold and interesting.''
   Waterson is currently starring with Robert Prosky in the New
York play ``A Walk in the Woods.'' Playwright Lee Blessing based it
on a real incident in which two arms negotiators, one American and
one Soviet, worked out a deal during a walk in the woods in Geneva,
Switzerland.
   This is one of the rare TV appearances for Waterston, who was
nominated for an Academy Award for ``The Killing Fields,'' although
he did star in a series six years ago, ``Q.E.D.''

   Carole Shorenstein Hays put her own money, some
$850,000, where her convictions were and brought ``Fences'' to
Broadway. Tony awards, a Pulitzer Prize and a lucrative film sale
were her reward.
   Smart money was against the play, Hays' first solo producing
venture.
   ``Listen kid, it ain't commercial,'' Hays deadpans, mimicking
the advice she got from seasoned theater professionals. They
cautioned against bringing to New York the August Wilson drama
about the upheavals of a black family during the late 1950s.
   ``It was important for me to do `Fences' because I believed in
it,'' the producer said the other day, between coos to her infant
son, Wally, in a Fifth Avenue hotel suite. ``It was very important
for me to send out the word to young emerging American playwrights
that Broadway is a place where their dreams could be fulfilled. You
don't have to go to London or Hollywood.''
   Besides ``Fences,'' Wally, born Aug. 16, was Hays' other big
production last year.
   When Hays, wearing a maternity evening gown, clambered to the
stage of the Mark Hellinger Theater last June to accept a Tony as
producer of the best play of the season, she exclaimed, ``I think
I'm going to give birth right now.''
   She didn't. Little Walter Hays actually arrived some two months
later, but, according to Hays, ``He knows `Fences' inside and out.''
   The baby made his Broadway stage debut _ at age 8 weeks _ in the
show. Wrapped in a blanket, he was carried on stage by James Earl
Jones, who usually cradles a doll. Wally had to be kept covered,
though. He was playing a little black girl.
   ``I don't believe I did that,'' Hays laughs. ``I'm a real stage
mother.''
   Hays first saw ``Fences'' in January 1986 at Chicago's Goodman
Theater, while it was making the circuit of various regional
theaters. By intermission, she knew she wanted to produce the play.
   She met with director Lloyd Richards, who had first done the
show at the Yale Repertory Theater in Connecticut, with author
Wilson and Jones.
   ``It was all very simple,'' she recalls. ``I said, `I want to do
this. It will be done. I have a theater in San Francisco.'''
   Hays actually runs three theaters there _ the Curran, the Golden
Gate and the Orpheum _ all owned by her family. Her father is
Walter H. Shorenstein, a California real estate mogul. Three years
ago, Forbes magazine estimated the family fortune at some $300
million.
   Hays always was stage-struck. Theater-going was the big family
activity. She remembers as a child putting on her party dress and
white gloves and going to the theater.
   When her family got into theater real estate, Hays got into the
theater business.
   ``I started at the bottom of the top,'' she recalls, learning
what it takes to put on a play. Until ``Fences,'' though, she had
never produced a show on her own.
   ``I think the easiest thing is to find other investors,'' Hays
says. ``You can twist arms. I always sold the most Camp Fire Girl
cookies and Girl Scout cookies.
   ``That's the point of my being `Fence's' sole investor. It was
about doing it right and having that control. I think when you
produce you must be a benevolent dictator. You must have the power
to make a decision, to say `no' or `yes.'''
   Before New York, Hays staged ``Fences'' at one of her theaters
in San Francisco and the reviews were mixed. Changes needed to be
made, particularly in clarifying the play's final scene, and Hays
saw that they were.
   ``It was a tryout and we went through the process of trying
different things,'' she recalls. ``Ultimately, it worked, but it
could have gone the other way.''
   Now the future of ``Fences'' seems secure. The play, now
starring Billy Dee Williams, has started its second year at
Broadway's 46th Street Theater. Its fortunes were boosted last
April after the drama won the Pulitzer Prize, last June when it won
four Tony awards and then later in the year when Paramount Pictures
paid some $500,000 for the film rights as a possible vehicle for
the super hot Eddie Murphy.
   ``I never did the play strictly as a commercial venture,'' Hays
says. ``I'm a Broadway baby. I believe in Broadway as being the
pinnacle of American theater.
   ``The first day of rehearsals for `Fences' I said to everyone,
`We do not know what's going to happen to this play, but we know
that we will all do our very, very best,''' she recalls. ```And I
want all of you to know that as a producer, you have my word that
this show isn't going to open and close. No matter what. We're
going to try and keep it running.'''
   So far, Hays hasn't had any trouble keeping her promise.

<HEAD>November 1985 Key in Relationship Between U.S., Israel</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOAN MOWER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The tangled, complicated and close
relationship between the United States and Israel is underscored by
developments in the Iran-Contra affair and the Iraqi oil pipeline
deal, which converged in November 1985.
   By coincidence, that mont also saw a serious rift in
U.S.-Israeli relations when Jonathan Jay Pollard, a
counterterrorism expert at the Naval Investigative Service was
arrested as a spy for Israel.
   An examination of what led up to the events of November 1985
provides insight into the relationship between Israel and the
United States and the interaction between officials from the two
countries.
   Two independent counsels, James McKay and Lawrence Walsh, are
investigating the Iraqi pipeline proposal and the Iran-Contra
affair, respectively. They have begun to share information in a
search for links between the cases.
   What is clear is that at least two of the same people dealt with
both cases; private citizens used their friendships with government
officials to make money, and international policy was affected by
business interests.
   At the same time that Israelis were shipping U.S.-made weapons
to Iran in an effort to free American hostages in Lebanon,
businessmen were enlisting friends at the highest levels of both
governments to guarantee the safety of a proposed Iraq oil pipeline
from Israeli bombing attacks.
   Late in the year, the Israelis gave White House aide Oliver L.
North free rein over $850,000 in excess profit from the Iranian
arms sales. Most of that money went to the Nicaraguan Contras,
according to a congressional report.
   Here is a loose chronology:
   On November 21, 1985, North worked frantically in his National
Security Council office to sort out foul-ups in the plan to have
Israel ship 80 Hawk missiles to Iran as part of a deal to release
six American hostages held by pro-Iranian groups in Lebanon.
   Desperate for help, he called his boss, Robert C. McFarlane,
then national security adviser, the State Department and the CIA.
   The Israelis had flown the first batch of U.S.-made weapons to
Tehran in late August, leading to freedom for hostage Benjamin Weir
in September. Details for future shipments were ironed out by North
and Amiram Nir, an aide to Shimon Peres, then Israel's prime
minister.
   Handling operational details on the Israeli side was Adolph
Schwimmer, an arms dealer, founder of Israel Aircraft Industries
and one of Peres' closest friends.
   President Reagan had given his blessing to the project.
   On Nov. 22, an Iranian middleman transferred $24 million _
payment for 80 Hawks _ into Swiss bank accounts controlled by an
Israeli intermediary.
   North had ordered Schwimmer to place $1 million in a Lake
Resources account run by private businessmen working with North.
The money was to cover transportation costs of flying the missiles
from Israel to Iran.
   Ultimately, only 18 of the 80 Hawks were flown to Tehran on Nov.
24. Shipments were halted because the Iranians complained they had
been cheated on the kind of missiles sent to them; no hostages were
released.
   Because only 18 Hawks were delivered, more than $800,000
remained in bank accounts under North's supervision. That money was
spent on the Nicaraguan Contras _ the first diversion of money to
the rebels, and it appears to derive from Israeli funds, a
congressional report on the Iran-Contra affair says.
   ``North testified that in early 1986 he told the Israelis that
the money had been used `for the purpose of the Contras' and they
acquiesced,'' the report said. The Israelis said North told them
Dec. 6, 1985, that he intended to use proceeds from the Iran arms
sales to help the Contras.
   American investigators have been unable to question Israeli
officials face-to-face about the Iran-Contra case. Yossi Gal, a
spokesman at the Israeli Embassy, did not return telephone calls
asking about the diversion.
   The Israelis gave the congressional Iran-Contra committees
written chronologies, but no one was interviewed in person. Walsh
has not been able to question Israelis, either.
   About the time the missiles were en route to Iran, another
project that involved Israel and the United States came to a boil:
the proposal by the Bechtel Group Inc. and Swiss businessman Bruce
Rappaport to build a $1 billion, 540-mile pipeline to run from
Iraq's Kirkuk oil fields to the Jordanian port of Aqaba. The route
ran near the Israeli border.
   Rappaport, who has a relationship with Peres that goes back 45
years, had hired as his attorney, E. Robert Wallach, a San
Franciscan with close ties to Attorney General Edwin Meese.
   On Sept. 19, 1985, four days after hostage Weir was freed, Peres
wrote Meese asking the attorney general to advise Secretary of
State George P. Shultz about Israel's interest in the pipeline.
   Promoters of the project planned to pay Israel to keep Jerusalem
from bombing the pipeline in the territory of its enemy, Iraq.
   A week later, Wallach wrote Meese about Rappaport's purported
arrangement to pay Israel _ and Peres' Labor Party.
   The debt apparently involved Israel's role in freeing Weir, the
memo said. Rappaport ``indicates that Peres emphatically indicated
that the release of Weir was a result of the state of Israel, and
no one else,'' Wallach wrote.
   In his memo, Wallach says ``there is a feeling that the U.S.
`owes' and that the accomplishment of this project, as outlined in
my memo, is appropriate.''
   Peres has denied he or his party received bribes; he has called
the idea ``nonsense.'' The Israeli government supported the
project, however, he said.
   On Oct. 7, Meese recommended that Peres discuss the pipeline
with McFarlane who is ``thoroughly familiar with the subject.''
McFarlane had assigned NSC aide David Wigg to quarterback U.S.
involvement in the pipeline.
   When Peres visited the United States Oct. 16-Oct. 12, he met
with McFarlene and Wigg about the pipeline, according to sources
quoted by The Washington Post.
   On Nov. 20, Peres sent McFarlane a letter saying the Israeli
government was prepared to ``extend guarantees'' that the pipeline
would not be touched.
   Within weeks, a proposal surfaced which called for the Pentagon
to make secret payments to Israel to prevent a pipeline bombing.
   McFarlane's successor, John M. Poindexter, eventually ended the
NSC involvement in the pipeline at year's end. It was never built.
   Meanwhile, the Justice Department continues to investigate the
unrelated Pollard case.
   Michael Ledeen, a former NSC consultant, said he thinks the
Pollard case may have encouraged red-faced Israelis to keep pushing
the Iran initiative on the assumption it would lead to release of
more American hostages in Lebanon, thus pleasing the United States.
   An Israeli source with access to top officials in his government
says Peres indicated that Jerusalem thought it could earn
forgiveness for the Pollard affair if hostages were freed. The
source spoke on condition he remain anonymous.
   Peres publicly apologized to the United States on Dec. 1, 1985.
   Pollard pleaded guilty to charges he sold secret military
documents to Israel and was sentenced to life imprisonment. His
wife, Anne Henderson-Pollard, was sentenced to five years for being
an accessory.
   Israeli Air Force Brig. Gen. Aviem Sella was indicted, and three
other Israelis were named as co-conspirators in the espionage
network operating inside the United States.

<HEAD>At the Movies: ``Au Revoir Les Enfants,'' ``The Family''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Hollywood's pursuit of the here-and-now has created a glossy,
mostly superficial quality to the product coming out of the major
studios. Nowadays it's European filmmakers who indulge in
remembrance of things past.
   Two commendable examples are candidates for this year's Academy
Award as best foreign language film: ``Au Revoir Les Enfants'' from
France and ``The Family'' from Italy.
   Louis Malle, after working for a decade in the United States,
returned to his homeland for the most personal film in his
distinguished career, ``Au Revoir Les Enfants'' (``Goodbye,
Children''). He wrote and directed the film from his own bitter
memories as a schoolboy in occupied France during World War II.
   The story begins with a tearful 12-year-old, Julien Quentin,
leaving his mother in Paris to attend a Catholic boys school in
Fontainebleau. There he encounters the taunts of the older boys,
the privations of wartime and the strict discipline of the priests.
Julien forms a grudging friendship with a bright, aloof fellow
student, Jean Bonnet, whose background is a mystery.
   Jean, it turns out, is a Jew whose identity is hidden by the
sympathetic priests. But Jean is betrayed by someone inside the
school, and both he, two other boys and the head priest are taken
off to concentration camps.
   A brief synopsis cannot convey the rich texture Malle
contributes to the melancholy tale, nor the deep humanity. He is
fortunate in his choice of two gifted young performers: Gaspard
Manesse (Julien) and Raphael Fejto (Jean).
   In ``The Family,'' Ettore Scola traces the 80-year history of a
Roman family through the recollections of the central figure,
Carlo. The entire film takes place within the family's apartment,
with views of the hallway signifying the change of eras.
   The turbulent events from 1906 to 1986 provide the backdrop for
the family history. The central theme is Carlo's divided affection
between the sister he marries and the sister he really loves.
   Scola is the master of such wide-sweeping stories, and his
depiction of the temperament and humor of the Italians is
delightful. He chose three actors to depict Carlo at different
ages: young Emmanuele Lamaro, the rising star Andrea Occhipinto as
Carlo from 20 to 40, and Vittorio Gassman thereafter. All three are
superb.

<HEAD>Star Watch: Poitier Is Back to the Action</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sidney Poitier was recently asked why he took
a 10-year absence from film acting. In explaining why, in a
roundabout way, he reminisced warmly about his boyhood on Cat
Island in the Bahamas:
   ``I started work when I was seven. My father was a tomato
farmer, and I was the youngest of the (family) group. It was not
traditional to leave a child of seven, because a child of seven was
able to work. There was no one to leave me with. So I went to the
fields, for the practical value of contributing to the family by
working.
   ``I remember we took our breakfast at home, and then we walked
to the fields, which were three to four miles from the house. We
would all walk because there was no form of transportation except
for the donkey, which my mother would ride. It was a very important
time when I would be allowed to ride the donkey for brief periods.
   ``We worked in the fields until the sun was mid-sky. About that
time, my mother would quit work, build a wood fire, take utensils
out of a bag, and she would cook for the family in the fields. We
used leaves of plants for plates. Interesting. We didn't know what
we were doing, but they were biodegradable.
   ``My job was to find the leaves, which were usually what we call
a sea grape in the Bahamas. My mother would fashion them into a
plate, very easily done. Of course we didn't have knives and forks,
so we would twist one of these leaves into a spoon. After lunch we
worked until the light began to fade, then we would go back to the
house, where my mother would have to prepare a fire and cook
dinner.''
   The Poitier farm went bust when the United States banned tomato
imports from the islands, and the family moved to Nassau. A husky
lad, Sidney Poitier at 12{ became a ditch digger and water boy for
a construction project.
   ``And I've been working ever since,'' he declared.
   This, he admitted with a laugh, was a long way around to
answering the question. But then, Poitier has always been a man to
choose his words with thoughtful care, never flinging pat answers
to oft-asked questions.
   When he reached 50, he continued, he faced the situation of many
people in mid-life:
   ``You somehow develop through the years work habits. More than
that, one becomes psychologically habituated to the process of work
as the gauge for your life. We work and we take a certain amount of
time off every year _ two weeks or three or four if we're
fortunate. The rest of the time we're doing the nine-to-five. Even
if you have the awareness of other lifestyles, you don't have the
wherewithal to investigate them.
   ``At 50 I decided to see what life was really like outside of
the narrow corridor of work.''
   What is it like?
   ``It's wonderful,'' he said. ``It's a little scary, because most
of the wonderful things have nothing to do with making a buck. The
world is filled with wonderful things; a remarkable diversity
exists in the world.''
   Poitier, who is now 61, fulfilled a long-held desire to study
astronomy. He began work on a novel. He and his wife, Joanna
Shimkus, and their two daughters (he has four grown daughters as
well) traveled a great deal. He also looked into individuals and
organizations who in a quiet sort of way _ Poitier style _ try to
improve the world around them.
   He stopped acting after ``A Piece of the Action'' in 1977, but
not filmmaking. He directed ``Stir Crazy,'' ``Hanky Panky'' and
``Fast Forward.'' About 18 months ago, David Puttnam, then head of
Columbia, sent Poitier a script about an FBI man who enlists an
18-year-old to catch a pair of Soviet spies _ the boy's own
parents. The result: ``Little Nikita,'' starring Poitier and River
Phoenix.
   Then Disney submitted ``Shoot to Kill,'' with Poitier as an FBI
agent chasing a killer through the wilds. The film was released
before ``Little Nikita'' and has reasserted the star's box-office
power.
   It may seem a curious coincidence that Poitier would play FBI
men in his two returning films, but he maintains it's not
surprising.
   ``That seems to be a trend in motion pictures. Many of our top
actors, and I don't place myself among them, play law enforcement
officers. (Clint) Eastwood. (Sylvester) Stallone. Eddie Murphy.
(Al) Pacino. Kevin Costner. Nick Nolte. Why?
   ``I have a feeling that filmmaking is so much a business that we
tend to search for formulas more than we are willing to admit. Cops
are almost always good guys, however one-dimensional they are
drawn. Criminals are the bad guys. So we don't have to deal with
real issues. We can deal with surface entertainment and a lot of
razzle-dazzle, action, dangerous activity and gunplay.''

<HEAD>The Artists: Animal Fat and Felt Do Sculpture Make</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KENNETH JAUTZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Joseph Beuys, West Germany's answer to the late
pop artist Andy Warhol, once said the Berlin Wall should be raised
10 centimeters for aesthetic reasons. The comment did little to
endear him to his countrymen.
   For most of his career, Beuys was better known in the United
States than at home. But now, two years after his death, Germans
have suddenly become fans of the avant-garde artist.
   Prices for his works are skyrocketing. Critics are singing his
praises. And record numbers of visitors are flocking to see the
first-ever major exhibition of his sketches and sculptures in West
Germany at one of the nation's leading museums.
   In East Berlin, a smaller exhibit of Beuys' early drawings also
is attracting crowds to the communist capital.
   The overhaul of Beuys' reputation has been speedy. Less than a
year ago, cleaners at the Duesseldorf Art Academy accidentally
threw out a Beuys sculpture made of wood, butter and animal fat.
The cleaners thought the creation was, literally, garbage.
   ``I often wonder what Beuys himself would think of all this,''
said a bemused Heiner Bastian, who served as the artist's assistant
for 12 years. ``He was used to criticizing society, but not to
being toasted by it.''
   Beuys specialized in sculptures made out of everyday items or
cast-off objects: empty boxes and tin cans, scraps of wood, stones,
shoes, blackboards or pieces of furniture. Felt and fat were his
favorite materials.
   In one creation, a single egg sits atop a wooden bench. In
another, a pair of battered boots dangles on a string above two
empty crates.
   A 1977 sculpture entitled ``In Memory of My Youth in the
Mountains'' consists of three large, white boulders inscribed with
the same words of the title.
   ``Beuys believed art had to be puzzling to be good, and there is
no denying that he is puzzling,'' said Bastian, who organized the
120-piece exhibition in West Berlin's Martin-Gropius-Bau museum.
   The 10-week show, which opened Feb. 20, drew an unexpected 9,000
visitors in its first five days, an unofficial record for an
exhibit in West Germany.
   With his jaunty and battered felt hat, vest and rumpled
trenchcoat, Beuys never looked like he fit in among the prosperous
and serious West Germans.
   His sense of humor was also atypically German. He was fired from
his job as administrator at the Duesseldorf Art Academy in 1972,
after announcing he would hire only applicants who had failed a
formal art program.
   He was dismissed by an angry Johannes Rau, then the economics
minister for the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, Beuys' birthplace
and lifelong home.
   But Rau and other politicians have since changed their tune.
   Now the North Rhine-Westphalian governor, Rau traveled to East
Berlin last month to open the city's first Beuys exhibition and
lavish praise on his former employee.
   Meanwhile, Volker Hassemer, West Berlin's culture chief, claimed
Beuys for Berliners.
   ``It is only fitting that the best-known contemporary German
artist be shown first in Berlin,'' Hassemer told reporters at the
Bueys exhibit's gala opening.
   Bastian is at a loss to explain the boost in Bueys' popularity,
and says it caught him by surprise.
   ``Throughout the history of art, there have been artists who
have become popular only after their deaths,'' he said. ``That has
been particularly true for modern art. No one can say why this is
so.''
   In a recent issue of Der Spiegel, West Germany's largest news
weekly, the entire letters column was devoted to Beuys. Opinion was
running decidedly against the artist.
   ``You recently ran pictures of Beuys works,'' wrote Immo
Kayser-Eichberg, a lawyer from the town of Meerbusch. ``You do not
seriously consider these things works of art, do you?''
   Visitors to the West Berlin Beuys exhibition were more tactful.
   ``No I do not understand it,'' said Ulrike Nagel, gazing at a
Beuys object that appeared to be little more than several empty
blackboards scattered on the floor. ``But that does not mean I do
not automatically dislike it.''

<HEAD>Music Makers: `Miami Vice' Music Man Drops Crockett, Tubbs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY McSHANE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jan Hammer had one thing in common with the
cocaine dealers on ``Miami Vice'': he was fleeing Sonny Crockett
and Rico Tubbs. Unlike those villains, the man behind the ``Vice''
music got away.
   After three years of scoring the show, Hammer has stepped down
from handling the weekly music chores for ``Miami Vice.'' And he's
released a new album, aptly titled ``Escape From Television.''
   ``It was very autobiographical when the name was coined,''
Hammer said recently in an interview at his manager's Manhattan
office. ``We went through many different titles, and then I came up
with `Escape From Television,' because I was definitely leaving the
show.''
   The decision to leave, Hammer said, was not too difficult to
make.
   ``There's other things I want to do _ like living without this
sword hanging over your head,'' said Hammer, 39, who scored the
first 69 ``Vice'' episodes, delivering a half-hour of music for
each show. ``Every week there's a new deadline. ... It's not
healthy living.''
   It also forced Hammer, who came to the United States from his
native Czechoslovakia in 1968, to pass on several projects. For
example, Hammer said it pained him to turn down the chance to score
``Lethal Weapon,'' the Mel Gibson-Danny Glover movie.
   ``I really like Mel Gibson. That would have been fun,'' Hammer
said with regret.
   But he has few regrets about ``Miami Vice,'' which created such
opportunities and produced Hammer's lone No. 1 single with the TV
show's theme song. Now, Hammer says, he's ready to return to his
solo career and continue his collaborative efforts with guitar
virtuoso Jeff Beck.
   ``I have some sketches for songs, so we're going to get together
and see what they sound like. Just write and record, just the two
of us, and see what happens,'' said Hammer, who works in a studio
on his upstate New York estate. ``Jeff is like second nature to
me.''
   Hammer's initial collaborations with Beck followed the 1973
break-up of his acclaimed fusion band, Mahavishnu Orchestra, which
featured guitarist Jon McLaughlin. These days, Hammer said, the
idea of a band doesn't appeal to him any more.
   ``Those days are over for me. ... All through the '70s, I always
had a band. I kept people on salaries year-round,'' said Hammer,
who toured about eight months a year back then. ``Can you imagine
the drain? The overhead? I don't feel the need for that, and it
just doesn't make sense.''
   There are a few other things Hammer finds do not make sense:
American radio and music videos.
   ``It's a machinery, and it force-feeds people,'' he said of
radio. ``Through the whole Top 40 format, it just force-feeds:
`You're now going to dig these 40 songs, and only these 40 songs.
You're not going to hear anything else.
   ``It's just this chunk of 40 songs being jammed down people's
throats. ... These things are prechewed, you know?''
   As for videos, Hammer said, ``To tell you the truth, I'm sick
and tired of them. I still like music-music, as opposed to
music-pictures. I think that's what I object to _ that everybody
has a video, and it's always the same.''
   And what does he mean by always the same?
   ``A run-of-the-mill boys playing guitars on the rooftops, boys
playing guitars in the desert, and boys playing guitars
underground,'' Hammer explained. ``And the funniest thing is these
really ugly guys have these gorgeous women just climbing over them.
   ``They wouldn't do it unless they were paid a lot of money. It's
just so unreal.''
   After getting together with Beck, Hammer plans to make his first
live appearances in the United States since a 1983 benefit tour. He
hopes to release another solo album, score some films and doesn't
rule out a return to television work. He'd also be content just
hanging around the house playing the piano.
   ``I really don't have any mountains to climb. I've been so lucky
in my life _ it's staggering,'' said Hammer. ``I don't want to
analyze it, because I might disturb something. I've been able to be
successful, and to do what I love. It's great.''

<HEAD>Books and Authors: Diverse Pierre Salinger Dabbles in Espionage
Fiction</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GENEVA COLLINS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pierre Salinger has worn so many hats in his
lively career that it's not surprising he's helped create a
fictional hero with an identity crisis.
   Investigative reporter Andre Kohl returns to his supersnooping
in ``Mortal Games'' (Doubleday, $17.95), the second espionage novel
written by Salinger and Leonard Gross.
   The two authors first introduced the character a few years back
in ``The Dossier,'' in which the star news correspondent prevented
a World War II Nazi collaborator from coming to power in France. In
``Mortal Games,'' Kohl is forced to stage his own death and resume
another identity as he ferrets out a rogue CIA network that has
inked up with similar rebel operations within the KGB and elsewhere.
   Salinger, who has been a reporter for the San Francisco
Chronicle, press secretary to President John F. Kennedy, U.S.
senator, and chief foreign correspondent for ABC News, said in a
recent interview that writing fiction serves an important function
for him.
   ``Fiction appeals to me because I can say all kinds of things
that I can't say in non-fiction. I can deal with stories that
interest me, have my charact's coming.''
   She said the message is ``be careful about pointing the finger.
You've got three more pointing at yourself.''

   ``One Mind'' (Global Pacific Records) _ Joaquin Lievano
   
   Joaquin Lievano gives special thanks to Zen Master Rama on the
back of ``One Mind,'' his new record. If you buy this record, you
may wish to enlist Mr. Rama's assistance in learning the patience
you'll need to get through it.
   ``One Mind'' is simple-minded. It starts at the beginning and
never wanders far beyond, winding back and forth upon itself with
no apparent direction.
   Lievano plays a variety of instruments, including guitars,
synthesizers and drums. He is assisted by Steve Smith on drums,
Steve Kindler on violin and Issac Epps on hand percussion. The
musicianship is proficient and the production is excellent. The
players turn in a nice riff here or a soft phrase there and, if you
like this sort of technical mastery of the soul, the record
delivers. For this reviewer, though, the overall effect was less
than zero.
   This record has its roots in the 1970s. It is derivative of
Chick Corea's ``Return to Forever'' and Kindler's playing sounds
suspiciously like that of Jean Luc Ponty, who rocketed out of
France in the '70s on a bow and an electric violin and has been
laying down the same tracks ever since.
   With apologies to Mr. Rama, an ancient Greek philospher once
said, ``You can't step in the same river twice.'' But Joaquin
Lievano is sure trying.

   ``If My Heart Had Windows'' (MCA) _ Patty Loveless
   
   Patty Loveless' new album consists of 10 songs, and the writing
credit is different on each. But Loveless' singing and the
production of Emory Gordy Jr. and Tony Brown make the album into a
cohesive set that's as country as grits.
   ``If My Heart Had Windows'' includes a honky-tonk waltz (the
title cut, by Dallas Frazier); country swing (Hank Williams' ``I
Can't Get You Off of My Mind''); and plenty of ballads. Loveless'
full-throated alto really hits its stride on Side 2, climaxing on
John and Johanna Hall's ``Fly Away,'' which lives up to its name
with a soaring chorus reminiscent of the Halls' defunct pop group,
Orleans.
   The arrangements, built around the solid rhythm section of
Leland Sklar and Eddie Bayers, include such nice touches as a steel
and fiddle playing in unison on the break of ``I Can't Get You Off
of My Mind.'' The material occasionally sags, but most of the album
contains strong and honest performances.

   You've heard it before and you'll hear it again: The success of
your paint job will depend on how much time and effort you put into
the preparation.
   It's nice to see the paint transform your lackluster walls and
ceilings into gleaming brightness or unblemished freshness, but the
pleasure will disappear quickly if you haven't prepared the
surfaces properly.
   Proper preparation means freeing the interior of loose dirt,
peeling paint, oil and grease. It also means spackling all cracks
and holes with spackling compound or patching plaster. The patches
should be primed before the final coat of paint goes on, but read
the label on the paint can to determine the manner of treatment.
   Some professionals and many do-it-yourselfers apply a primer
even when no patching has been done.
   It is especially important that any gloss be removed from the
surfaces, since new paint does not adhere well to slick or shiny
walls and ceilings. The gloss can be steel-wooled, sanded or given
a coat of a special liquid that dulls the shine. Unlike a few years
ago, oil and latex paints can be used fairly well over each other,
but a primer will insure an excellent result. The assumption is
that you will be using a good paint, since it is poor economy to
choose a low-quality paint when it is your own ``elbow grease''
that is being utilized. Latex paints have little or no odor and
make it easier to clean up after the job is completed.
   Follow the rule-of-thumb that a high gloss paint usually is more
washable, resists moisture and wears well, which is why it is
preferred in kitchens and bathrooms. Flat paints are the choice in
most living rooms and bedrooms, being easier on the eyes. A
semi-gloss paint is what the name implies, about halfway between
the gloss and flat.
   The ideal way to prepare a room for painting is to remove
everything from it, but this may be impractical. At least take out
the lighter objects, moving the heavier pieces to the center of the
room and covering them with a dropcloth or whatever is handy.
   All electrical switch plates, doorknobs, etc., can be taken off,
but be extra careful about exposing any electric wires. Ceiling
fixtures can be dropped slightly to make the painting easier.
   In a casual room, you might want to try unusual effects. There
are special rollers to give you offbeat results. You can do the
same thing by dragging or swirling brushes, whisk brooms, sponges
and rags across the paint while it is still wet, keeping in mind
that easy does it if you want to avoid a mess. To find out what
kind of results these gimmicky styles of painting will produce, try
practicing on something like a piece of scrap wallboard.
   When you have estimated the amount of paint you will need, it's
a good idea to buy an extra amount. For one thing, you always find
something more you want to paint to blend in with the room. It may
be only a bookcase or two, but if you have it on hand, it can be
used at some later time for a touch-up job.
   Buying the same kind of paint at a future time does not always
assure that the shade will be identical with the original.
   Some people just don't order enough the first time because they
don't want to pay for unused paint. But many paint dealers will
take back an unopened can if too much time hasn't elapsed. Should
you think that might be a problem, ask the dealer about the
possibility.
   You may want to get on with the painting and not worry about
whether you are trying to make a room seem larger or smaller, but
if the latter concerns you, the proper color is the answer. Want to
make something in a room ``disappear''? Paint it the same color as
the room itself. Want to make it stand out? Paint it a contrasting
color.
   If a room is long and narrow and you want it to seem a bit
shorter, using white paint on two of the walls and a soft warm
color on the two end walls will do the trick. When a side wall is
painted white or a cool color, the room will appear to be wider. In
the same way, a hallway that is too narrow can be made to seem
wider if a side wall is painted white or cool.
   Warm colors _ red, yellow, red-orange, yellow-orange and
variations of red _ make a room warm. Cool colors _ blue, green and
their many shades _ make it cool. Thus, theoretically, rooms which
get very little sunlight are best painted warm colors, those with
lots of sunlight cool colors. In actuality, other factors,
including the shapes of the rooms and their decorative features,
usually affect the choice of colors, not to mention personal
preferences.

   Spring fashions will be sealed with a kiss from
the '60s _ but bows and bubbles will replace love beads this time
around.
   The mood is flirty and fun _ romantic and dramatic.
   And body-conscious.
   Short skirts were the most obvious blast from the past as
designers revealed their upcoming lines. The tent dress _ mini, of
course _ was revived by Adrienne Vittadini. Some models piled
plastic bangle bracelets up their arms.
   And there was plenty of Flower Power: frequent floral prints;
skirts curved and layered like upside-down tulips; fabric flowers _
attached as a simple corsage or, ala Betsey Johnson and Bill Blass,
stuck all over the dress.
   But the stark options of the '60s also have been tempered with
plenty of old-style chiffon and elegant silk, along with buoyant
skirts, frothy sleeves, pretty sundresses and even a few bustles.
   Fanciful, pumpkin-shaped bubble skirts appeared frequently,
along with a less-radical version that's been dubbed a ``collapsed
bubble.'' Bob Mackie took bubbles one step beyond, turning them
into bustles, ruffles and stand-up collars.
   Lace, sequins and gleaming, intricate beadwork also made for
after-dark glamour.
   Day or night, black and white still prevailed, along with bold
teal, fuchsia and goldenrod yellow. Polka dots, ruffles, big
buttons and bows cropped up often _ the latter in every conceivable
location. Waists were nipped and accented with wide belts or sashes.
   Shoulders were bared in strapless, bustier sundresses and
off-the-shoulder jackets and dresses.
   When it came to gams, Cathy Hardwick's collection was the
leggiest of the lot. One strapless, green and yellow cotton dress
by Mary Jane Marcasiano was too snug and short for anything but
mincing steps. Ronaldus Shamask also had some shockingly short
selections.
   Ellen Tracy's silk, knee-skimming tulip-shaped skirts were soft
and feminine. Even a few offerings from traditionalist Laura Ashley
crept slightly above the knee.
   To hem or not to hem? The undecided could opt for Bob Mackie's
tight, beaded black dress, featuring a diagonal hem slashed from
knee to thigh. Or try the cookie-cutter hemlines, many to mid-calf,
that spiced the new made-in-America collection by Soviet couturier
Viyacheslav Zaitsev.
   The other alternative _ trousers _ was the opposite of
body-conscious: Perry Ellis' loose, ankle-skimming pants; Donna
Karan's navy pajama pants, teamed with slinky, wrapped tops; Mary
McFadden's flowing palazzo pants, with ridges of delicate mushroom
pleats tumbling from waist to hem; Ronaldus Shamask's high-waisted
pants, shorts or culottes with sashes.
   Only bike pants, like those offered by Adrienne Vittadini, were
slim, and they often were topped with long dusters or tunics.
   Geoffrey Beene favored the jumpsuit, heralding his black, crepe
version with a halter neck and a swimsuit back as ``the new
ballgown.''
   Shorts had fashion flair, too: like Williwear's cuffed,
knee-grazing walking shorts teamed with a double-breasted blazer or
a smartly cropped jacket; Vittadini's mint-green, cuffed shorts
with a bra-top and unstructured jacket.
   The shorts also were part of a new, below-the-waist, layered
look.
   Ashley's two-piece halter dress in a splashy print featured a
wrap-around skirt that unraveled to reveal matching shorts.
Carolina Herrera's billowing, black and white, silk organza skirts
were cut away in front to reveal beaded camisoles and shorts.
   Some designers also layered dresses and skirts with petticoats,
or a second skirt, peeking out from beneath.
   Williwear's eye-catching Egyptian print skirt opened to show a
solid-colored, cotton-eyelet skirt. Johnson's stretchy tube-dress
in black and white gingham was prettied up with a buoyant,
knee-length skirt and can-can slip. Beene's short, sweet, baby-doll
circle skirts were fluffed out with petticoats.
   And just about every designer braved one ensemble that combined
unlikely fabrics or prints. Mary Ann Restivo and Ralph Lauren, for
instance, showed floaty, chiffon skirts with tailored jackets.

   Suits are back in force for spring _ especially as
haute couture sees the picture. They look everything from wildly
extroverted to wearable for business and travel.
   And the crowning glory of all the couture pizazz is _ what else?
_ hats. The designers let their fantasy run mad, from the sublime
to the silly.
   For couture _ which is not for average shoppers, but serves
mainly as a strong prototype for what might be found on the racks _
here are ideas to look for:
   Suits are nearly always waist-hugging and short, with jackets
short or long to choose from, and shoulders still shaped, but more
played-down than in the past.
   Saint Laurent's suits hit both day and dressy notes. His
sharply-tailored long jackets with double-breasted or belted safari
effects are worn with knotted chiffon scarves at the neck for
softening the seriousness of the suit.
   Large boater-style hats give his suits a cachet of total chic.
   His dressier suit is plastered with a sequined cubistic design,
elegance and height added by a wrapped fez hat in a different
color, such as purple to contrast with a turquoise satin skirt.
   Dior suits are peppier than ever, but still in the daywear
category. They're charmingly bouncy with stiffened, full skirts,
very small waists and the crowning touch of tiny perched boater
hats.
   Lagerfeld at Chanel has brought back some great Chanel ideas in
suits that are just above the knee _ terrific white tweeds bordered
in bicolored ribbon piping. The topper? For this spring's touch,
it's a large banded straw hat overturned like a salad bowl.
   His slinky long suits are harbingers of next winter; he says
they're definitely coming back. This is glorious news for those who
want to hide their knees. They look authoritative in checked and
solid ensembles with long tulip-wrapped jackets, and the salad-bowl
hat becomes bigger than ever.
   Budding out into springtime dressy looks, Nini Ricci showed
loads of suits with layers of ruffles on skirts, dressy jackets
fitted with a little padding on the shoulders, big stand-out peplum
effects on long jackets.
   Polka dots in these flirtatious clothes are often matched with a
big dotted sunhat.
   Jean-Louis Scherrer's silk suits come right out of the hothouse
for spring, with flowers all over them _ maybe teaming black and
white with bright flower prints in skirts, lapels and cuffs in
ultra-fitted suits. And of course, the big-brimmed garden-party hat
nearly eclipses the shoulders with flowers.
   More about hats: Solidly sane or simply crazy, they add a fillip
to any outfit, and lots of fun to the fashion party. Sailor hats
are a favorite at Louis Feraud. Maryll Lanvin opts for little
flower baskets to top her fussily feminine short outfits in a
collection based on her ``secret garden.''
   With flowers in patterns, appliques and even sleeve shapes in
these collections, naturally flowered hats are de rigueur.
   Pierre Cardin practically made a whole outfit with his gigantic
yellow wildflower chapeau covering the model's face, if not her
body _ which was clad in a slinging black mini.
   Kal Lagerfeld added an original touch to his Chanel collection
with the dashing multi-layered straw hat fluted in waves like a
seashell, but shaped more like a flounced stand-out skirt.
   Marc Bohan at Dior branched out into tongue-in-cheek fantasy by
pairing a feathery fright wig with all the allure of a jungle
``Hottentot'' to go with a draped zebra-striped dress.
   And in the devil-may-care vein, wonder boy Christian Lacroix
matched zany hats to some of his fanciful outfits. For a circus
look, he topped a puffy-skirted short dress with a towering tube
slightly curved for laughs. In a sunny beach-inspired mood, he
shaped a straw hat like a whorled sea-snail.
   With these showy or relatively safe toppers, there are plenty of
choices to try on and take home from the hat bar.
   But make sure you get the quick lift you'd get at a cocktail bar
_ rather than a hangover.

   Geoffrey Beene believes the jumpsuit could
become the unisex look of the future. But his svelte, black version
for spring harkens feminine magic.
   Rising star Angel Estrada has mixed up some magic of his own in
elegantly draped silk dresses.
   Beene describes his slinky, black, crepe jumpsuit, with a halter
front and a swimsuit back, as ``the new ballgown.'' He tops it with
a sharp, cropped jacket in coral, yellow or white.
   Another enchanting, black jumpsuit is studded with pink moons
and stars. The heavenly motif appears again at the waist and
neckline of a long, slightly clingy, black gown.
   Throughout his collection, necklines are slashed into striking
geometric shapes, including stars. ``Fashion is both magic and
magical,'' observes Beene. ``It's a Snow White kind of magic.''
   The designer also favored polka dots, especially in baby-doll
dressing dominated by short, sweet circle skirts and petticoats.
   One version, with an empire waistline, was strapless and sugary
in white-and-black dots with curvy piping around the hemline. A
strapless, black, bustier dress was zippered in front and back,
with a black, full, baby-doll skirt in black-and-white dots. Many
skirts landed about four inches above the knees.
   Beautiful, billowy coats were another of Beene's crowning
glories. A black, street-length, Phantom of the Opera coat swirled
like a cape. White, scalloped lace circled its stand-up collar.
   Swishy, suave, calf-length raincoats were fashioned in green or
gray. A short, effervescent, Ultrasuede coat in fuchsia or coral
sprouted an uneven hemline. A yellow cotton sheath with a square
neck and zip front is splashed with black jonquils; the matching
coat had a capelike back.
   Estrada's silk designs, in crepes, taffeta and chiffon, are
based on the trim, timeless, princess silhouette. His draping
provides la difference.
   A mint green mini-dress has a foamy cowl that floats down over
the shoulders. A gold micro-mini, not for the faint-hearted,
resembles a swimsuit, with draping over the bustline and a bustle
effect in the back. A short, red, bustier dress looks almost like a
jumper over a see-through blouse with balloon sleeves.
   When the Renaissance mood strikes, m'lady would be fetching in a
pink, strapless, ankle-length gown, slightly flared at the bottom,
with spaghetti straps and plunging back. The long-sleeved
bolero-style jacket rises to the midriff. The ensemble is completed
with a medieval hat topped with two tall, pink horns and yards of
veil.

   Hand-crocheted knits and the most feminine of
stretchy laces are some of the richly textured fabrics Donna Karan
uses to create her draped and sculpted clothing for spring. The
collection is unquestionably one of the most beautiful of the
season.
   The delicate, airy weave of her fabrics _ inspired, Ms. Karan
says, by her collection of lacey antique straw hats _ makes her
clothing soft and feminine without artificial-looking frills, poufs
or trim.
   ``I want women to feel beautiful in a most luxurious and
sophisticated way,'' she says.
   Ms. Karan doesn't design mix-and-match sportswear. A jacket is
carefully sculpted to be worn with a certain skirt and camisole to
capture the fluid line of a one-piece dress.
   Long ``scarf jackets'' in navy and cream stretch wool crepe,
elegantly draped to one side and gathered there with a satin bow,
were worn with soft, fluid Bermuda shorts and short skirts.
Sometimes there was a hint of a lace decollete, twisted V-neck
bodysuit or little camisole.
   Body-revealing wrapped tops also are a favorite of Ms. Karan's,
and she matched them with flowing navy pajama pants worn with
elegant high-heel pumps.
   Ms. Karan, whose designs concentrate on fabric and shape, used
understated solid colors _ navy, cream, taupe and mulberry for
daytime, with red replacing mulberry for evening. Gold jewelry and
buttons, with the dull shine of family heirlooms, provided a touch
of brightness.
   Her collection easily made the transition from daytime to
eveningwear, since the basic shapes of her clothing vary little.
But, for evening, her fabrics attained a lustrous quality _ most
apparent in her clingy lace sweaters with plunging necklines, worn
over soft skirts or tucked in and cinched at the waist with satin
bands.
   Dramatic elegance describes an off-the-shoulder, scoop-neck
jacket in stretchy scarlet silk, held in place at the waist by a
ribbon rose and then cut away to show a hand-crocheted skirt.
   The ``scarf jacket,'' with its softly draped fabric at the side,
reappeared as a stunning long evening gown in navy.

   Although the bite of winter is still nipping at the
heels, shops are already preparing for what promises to be one of
the shortest summers in fashion history.
   The spring-summer of 1988 in fact marks the return of the
miniskirt with hemlines so short they make Mary Quant's version
look dowdy.
   Champions of the new micro-mini are the Italian ready-to-wear
designers who propose a variety of styles from ruffled to pleated
to draped and puffed. Fabrics range from sexy leather to demure
cotton and sensuous silk, but the hemline always hovers closer to
the thigh than the knee.
   For those with scant pocketbooks, the best investment for the
summer 1988 Italian style is a pair of good scissors to lop off
last year's hemlines. However, the fortunate few with a fat bank
account _ and a skinny figure _ have an infinite variety of minis
to chose from.
   Giorgio Armani, the ``Numero Uno'' in the classic tailoring of
the famed made-in-Italy label, prefers to keep his summer hemlines
a discreet several inches above the knee in supersoft draped skirts
and culottes. Gianfranco Ferre, on the other hand, strays from his
traditional line to offer the tightest shortest skirt of the season
_ a black patent leather number which barely covers the buttocks.
   Gianni Versace, who previewed the return of the mini with a
daring winter skirt dubbed the ``postage stamp'' for its minute
proportions, offers a minidress with wide-hooped skirt and
tight-fitting bodice reminiscent of an inverted champagne glass,
while Krizia proposes gaily polka-dotted evening minidresses.
   Along with the miniskirt, the Italian designers dreamed up a
myriad of sugary sweet party dresses, in pretty floral chintz and
ruffled lace, matched with wide-brimmed straw hats complete with
floral corsage and demure white gloves _ for the delight of the
young, or at least the young at heart.
   The great risk, in fact, of the new Italian ``moda bambina'' is
that it fall into the hands or onto the bodies of the over-aged and
over-sized.
   Byblos is the best place to find this romantic youthful look,
with its jeans dresses decorated with lace frills, and its many
floral printed mini party dresses with hooped skirt.
   Another label that favors the party dress is Fendi, designed by
extravagant Karl Lagerfeld. His petticoated floral printed
minidress with oversized puffed sleeves and matching wide-brimmed
hat is so young looking it would be a hit at a birthday party for
3-year-olds.
   Armani also picked up on the party theme in his evening wear,
designing gaily printed and ruffled floor length evening gowns,
with enticing bodice, and puffed petticoated skirt, reminiscent of
a fairytale milkmaid.
   Fortunately, the Italian designers never forget that they
started out a decade ago as the inventors of the tailored classical
look, and therefore along with the minis and the party dresses they
offer plenty of elegant outfits for summer office and city life _
Laura Biagiotti's pastel colored linen safari suit, and navy and
white striped cashmere pullover; Basile's ankle-length rose printed
shirt waist cinched at the waist by a wide brown belt, and Jenny's
feminine plaid blazer and cropped black and white floral printed
jacket.
   On the whole, jackets were man-tailored and long, sometimes
covering the scanty attire below.
   The place to look for an overall fashionable spring-summer of
1988 is Armani who, while taking inspiration from the new trends,
did not sacrifice elegance and wearability for creativity.
   The new Armani look is based on a very simple daytime
silhouette: a classic polo shirt or the newer fencing blouse, a
pair of loose trousers or a gently draped skirt or culotte only
several inches above the knee, and either a man-tailored double
breasted blazer, or a V-necked jacket, all in super soft fabrics
and delicate pastel shades.
   Summer colors come right out of a box of watercolors: peach
apricot and rose, acqua blue and green, cream and beige. Bright
fruit shades such as grape, cherry and raspberry, or lemon, orange
and lime are cheerful alternatives.
   High heels are back again, to put even more distance between the
hemline and the floor, but there are also plenty of comfortable
flat daytime sandals.
   Italian designer clothes were never cheap, but rising costs in
Italy and the falling dollar have made prices soar almost as much
as hemlines. An Armani outfit made up of jacket, shirt and trousers
or skirt rings up to the shocking figure of over $2,5OO, but
compared to $600 for a Ferre mini only 10 inches long, it is
positively a bargain.

   Turning one pair of women's shoes into a fashionable four is not
necessarily a magician's trick, according to footwear fashion
consultants. It can be done by any woman with a few handmade,
European-inspired accessories.
   The accessories can give a simple pair of pumps at least four
different looks, according to Suzan Kressel, director of accessory
marketing for Riviera, a New York-based company.
   The accessories, called ``Shoetooz,'' use fabrics ranging from
rich satins and faille to bright tulle and fine leathers. Italian
plastics also are used as well as metals such as antique gold and
silver.
   Styles include a wide variety of shapes and sizes, including
bows, rosettes, buttons, tassels and geometric patterns, with
prices ranging from $10 to $35, says Ms. Kressel.
   The classic, leg-slimming pump also has been given a new look by
Hush Puppies, a footwear manufacturer specializing in comfortable
shoes.
   According to John Stevenson, company president, although flat
shoes have dominated the fashion scene in the past few seasons, the
pump traditionally has been the cornerstone of a woman's wardrobe,
due to its versatility, working equally as well with casual, dressy
or business clothes.
   ``Now the classic pump has been updated,'' Stevenson says.
``We've added some new interest, such as snake skinned patterns,
sling-backs, and gold tips. The spectator pump _ with contrasting
blue and white or black and white _ will also be a bold look for
spring.''
   To showcase the classic pump, he adds, the white, pale, or nude
leg is making a comeback, stimulated by the new romantic and
feminine movement in clothing.

   Sun-worshiping women from California to Cape
Cod this summer will wear a blend of stripes, animal patterns and
floral designs that celebrate an active lifestyle and physical
zest, swimwear industry experts say.
   Women want suits that ``portray an image of physical fitness,
whimsical sensuality, fashion awareness and success,'' said Jill
Lee Williams, who designs for Los Angeles-based Jag swimwear.
   ``Our body styling, color and print attitudes are very fashion
forward, on top and unafraid,'' Ms. Williams added.
   In other words, the suits are being designed for young women who
value success and who cultivate the Body Beautiful.
   Other lines being offered this year are similarly bold and
revealing, including those made by Catalina, DeWeese and Gottex of
Israel, all of which have West Coast manufacturing facilities.
   In coming weeks, cash registers will be ringing from purchases
of yardage with texture that feature ribs, puff prints, Lycra,
silk, cotton and rubber.
   All are intended to make a day at the beach a visual as well as
a physical exercise.
   The Anne Cole Collection offers a neoprene wet suit that is a
provocative bikini with a hint of scuba diving adventure to it. The
cost: $75.
   Jantzen also features a zippered vest suit dubbed the ``Sea
Hunt,'' which diver Mike Nelson would doubtless appreciate.
   ``In designing Jag swimwear, the creative ideas come from my own
active lifetyle, sporting events, international attitudes, trends
and travel,'' Ms. Williams said.
   Still, even those who achieve less than the image of perfection
portrayed by the swimsuit models will likely be able to find a suit
that works for them. Such outfits are called ``solution suits.''
Prints can camouflage figure faults more than solids. A sheath or
skirted suit can hide heavy hips. A maillot made with a girdle in
the tummy area offers another solution.
   Women who buy the DeWeese, Jag and Catalina products will find
retail prices starting around $25 and topping about $60. Gottex of
Israel, an international manufacturer, prices a bit higher with
many offerings in the $80 range.
   Swimwear, however, isn't limited to the beach anymore. Gottex
also makes accessories that render swimwear acceptable for evening
wear and social events, said spokeswoman Vicki Abrams.
   The Gottex offerings feature maillots, bikinis and thongs, along
with swimming minis that can be worn to town and flounced skirts
and stretch dresses ``for dancing 'til dawn.''
   Some of the influence of last year's popular choices can be seen
in animal and floral prints, which remain popular.
   Metallic fabrics are out at Catalina, according to June Wylie of
the Los Angeles-based swimwear manufacturer.
   ``They have been replaced with a subtle hint of foil _ just
enough to catch the eye and hold it.''
   Stripes are also back on the fashion menu, she said.
   ``Stripes, stripes, stripes,'' she said. ``Vertical, diagonal,
horizontal or interjected with more stripes are the active
ingredients of some of the newest patterns,'' said Wylie.
   Catalina is offering suits in colors that feature rich earthen
tones of sienna, taupe or charcoal, gentle pastels of mint, coral,
pink lilac and ice blue. Fruit colors are also on the fashion
plate, such as cherry, grape, raspberry or apple green, she said.
   Gottex colors include red, jade, yellow, turquoise, pink,
bronze, denim and champagne. Gottex textures involve weaving
techniques that feature puckered, crinkled, seersuckers and
metallics.
   At DeWeese, the company describes its as ``young in spirit, yet
well-bred in its silhouettes and level of sophistication.''
   ``Nothing is more permanent in fashion than good taste,'' said
designer Lorraine Roese in a statement of her philosophy.

   In 35 years at Brooks Brothers, the men's
clothing store founded by his great-great grandfather, Ashbel Wall
saw the shirt breast pocket come and the back collar button go.
   He survived the store's first sale, its first women's department
and the demise of the pull-over dress shirt. He was there the day
suits _ stacked on tables for more than a century _ finally were
hung from racks.
   But Wall, the last member of the Brooks family to work there,
says nothing changed faster than the number of stores.
   By 1975, the year he retired, there were 16. ``I didn't see how
we could keep expanding and keep our image,'' he said in a recent
interview. ``We had begun to run out of sophisticated cities.''
   Today, Brooks Brothers has 48 stores around the country, many of
them in shopping malls. They've popped up in cities from Tulsa,
Okla., to Birmingham, Ala. There are 14 stores, named Burukusu
Buradasu, in Japan.
   Brooks Brothers' main store still is on New York's Madison
Avenue and its mainstays still are the button-down cotton shirt and
the three-buttoned, natural-shouldered suit coat. But the rapidly
growing chain ``isn't the store I knew,'' says Wall, 72.
   The store that became Brooks Brothers was founded by Henry Sands
Brooks in 1818 near lower Manhattan's port district. In 1850 the
store, which specialized in ready-made clothing, was renamed Brooks
Brothers by the founder's five sons.
   It sold Ulysses Grant his uniforms, Franklin Roosevelt his capes
and Fred Astaire his pajamas. When Abraham Lincoln was
assassinated, he was wearing a Brooks suit.
   Brooks Brothers' button-down shirt resulted when company
president John Brooks, visiting England early in the century,
noticed that polo players held down their collar points with
buttons to keep them from flapping.
   It was the first of several American introductions: the Shetland
sweater (1904); the polo coat (1910); the lightweight cotton suit
(1930); the Dacron-and-cotton shirt (1953).
   After Garfinkel's bought the store following World War II,
Ashbel Wall became its link with the past.
   ``I was there to keep the continuity,'' he explained. ``I was
the last one in the family to work there (so) I was the arbiter of
what was Brooksy and what wasn't. One of my responsibilities was
answering the mail and saying, `I'm a member of the family, and
we're doing things the same as ever.'''
   Well, almost. For years the pocketless shirt was a Brooks
trademark, although the company would add a pocket for those who
wanted it _ at no extra cost.
   But after the vest went out of style, more and more customers
began asking for pockets, and in the late 1960s the pocket became
standard. Now it is the pocketless shirt that must be specially
ordered _ at no extra cost.

   The demise of the dress-for-success uniform that
puts women in box-like suits and little uptight blouses is no
surprise to Alcott & Andrews, which calls itself wardrobers to
America's successful women.
   The specialty store entered the women's apparel market three
years ago with the idea that executive women are tired of looking
like male clones and want their clothing to be distinguished, but
with a soft, feminine touch.
   ``I think one of the reasons we've been as successful as we have
is that we understand this lady is a lady _ she's not a man,'' says
Coleen Brady, 39, vice president of Alcott & Andrews.
   Advertisements for the store's 11 outlets across the country
show beautiful, blond women with an impeccably coiffed Grace Kelly
look.
   The company's president, Michael Jeffries, 43, bristled at the
suggestion that his store has something in common with Brooks
Brothers. ``They're traditional clothiers. We're in the fashion
business,'' he said.
   For instance, Jeffries notes that Alcott & Andrews had no
hesitations about embracing the short skirt for the fall season.
And Ms. Brady says customer response has been ``tremendous.''
   ``We think the knee is quite stylish, quite appropriate,'' she
says.
   Ninety-eight percent of the stores' merchandise, Jeffries says,
is designed by talent inside the company.
   He and Ms. Brady want their apparel to appeal to executive
women, ``presidents of country clubs'' and wives of ``very
successful men.'' The one common characteristic shared by them all,
Ms. Brady says, is that they are ``successful.''
   The store strives for a refined yet efficient atmosphere.
Classical music and antique furniture aim to sooth the harried
shopper.
   Merchandise is grouped in complementary color blocks so a woman
can put together a total wardrobe without searching for a blouse or
jacket to go with a skirt.
   And ready to help her in her selections are some of the highest
paid salespeople _ called ``wardrobe consultants'' _ in the retail
business. ``They can make upwards to $50,000 a year. ... And the
norm is between $20,000 and $50,000 a year,'' Jeffries says.
   ``Our customer is traditionally a hard-working executive woman
who doesn't have time to wait unattended for sales help or to check
out,'' Ms. Brady says.
   Alcott & Andrews is a privately held company whose 1987 sales
are expected to exceed $50 million.

   One of the great modern classics was born late
last century when Griswold Lorillard attended the Tuxedo Park
Club's traditional white-tie-and-tails autumn ball wearing a
short-jacketed suit and satin lapels.
   The formal wear, called the tuxedo ever since, came to symbolize
the epitome of elegance and style. Immortalized by Fred Astaire and
brought to the heights of sophistication by Cary Grant, the tuxedo
has changed little since its auspicious beginning.
   Now, although it was ravaged during the 1970s with ruffles, wide
lapels and pastel colors, the basic black ``tux'' is back _ with a
few exceptions.
   The traditional black tuxedo is single vented with notch lapels
and natural sloping shoulders, according to Joel S. Screiber,
president of A.T. Harris, one of the oldest formal wear
establishments.
   ``People who bought designer tuxedos two or three years ago are
coming back and renting because their tuxedos are no longer in
style,'' said Schreiber.
   He said tuxedos should be worn with a white, studded formal
shirt with a turned down collar, and black patent lace-ups or pumps.
   But this doesn't mean there aren't variations. People are
experimenting with different colored cummerbunds and ties. Some,
mostly the young, are opting for the wing tip collar.
   Certain accessories also are becoming popular, says Schreiber.
``More people are requesting white silk scarfs, gloves, spats and
even top hats.''
   Although all of the big designers make a tuxedo, the bulk sold
today come from two major companies: After Six and Lord West.
   After Six, designed by Bill Blass, is more in the classic
tradition. The selections from Lord West, designed by Pierre
Cardin, have more of a European flair.

   The miniskirt may be back, but it's more
formal and refined than the thigh-high hemlines of the 1960s, says
Alison Lurie, Pulitzer Prize novelist and fashion commentator.
   The more sophisticated minis, she says, may be an expression of
women's confidence at work and in the economy.
   ``When things are good economically, skirts tend to go up. If
we're happy and carefree, we begin to act and dress like children.
The miniskirt is part of this general phenomenon,'' she says.
   ``When we were young, we wore very short skirts; children still
do. But there's an age beyond which you have to be in absolutely
wonderful shape to wear a miniskirt, maybe 40.''
   Lurie won the fiction Pulitzer Prize in 1985 for the novel
``Foreign Affairs'' and also wrote ``The War Between the Tates.''
She is an English professor at Cornell University here in narrative
writing, folklore and children's literature. A native of Chicago,
she was raised in White Plains, N.Y., and is the mother of three
grown sons.
   She is also the author of ``The Language of Clothes,'' written
in 1981, in which she said that the lacy, baby-doll style of the
1960s made ``grown women look like toddlers with a glandular
affliction, or like severely retarded nubile teen-agers.'' The
miniskirts, she said, seemed ``ridiculous rather than seductive.''
   In the beginning, ``it was said that men wouldn't be able to
concentrate on their work if they had `beautiful chicks' running
around in brightly colored clothes,'' she says. ``Women had to
scrape their hair back into buns and wear dark, depressing clothes
that hid the figure.
   ``Those clothes were boring. Women are not used to wearing the
same thing every day the way men are; they couldn't put up with it.
Now that they are confident in their jobs, they can kick up their
heels a little and stop wearing such a dreary costume.''
   It was consumer demand, not designer contrivance, that brought
the miniskirt back, she says, noting that so far the skirts seem
more popular away from work than at the office.

   By whatever name, those bands over the shoulders that hold up
your pants or skirt are holding up as fashion statements, too.
   ``They have become so popular that most trousers are being
manufactured today suspender button-ready,'' says Larry Levy,
president of Field Brothers menswear.
   ``As with ties, suspender styles are more exotic,'' he says,
``as opposed to the standard solid blue or black of recent years.''
   Indeed, suspenders are being ``snapped up,'' he says, with sales
rising 400 percent in the past year.

   Paper hats are old hat, but paper bathing suits? And paper
pajamas?
   Designer Susan Lane has created a line of ``paper couture,'' 15
paper designs for resort, holiday and bridal fashions _ all
recyclable.
   The designs _ from jogging apparel and tennis whites to sailor
suits and evening dresses _ are made of paper interfacing, a
material commonly used for garment linings.
   Each design in what Ms. Lane calls the ``Symbol Signature''
collection carries the paper recycling symbol of three revolving
arrows.
   ``In the tradition of the Polo pony and Guccis Gs, I'd like to
see the recycling symbol become the newest symbol of fashion
savoir-faire,'' says Ms. Lane, owner of the Los Angeles-based
Country Elegance boutique, who introduced paper wedding gowns to
the fashion industry two years ago.
   ``There are many advantages to paper clothes,'' she says. ``They
can be personalized with a pen, altered with a pair of scissors and
repaired with Scotch tape.''

   ``Pretty, yet pain-free'' is the philosophy behind a line of
fashion clothing and accessories aimed at women who have physical
problems, like arthritis, in getting dressed.
   Irwin Taylor, a Rochester, N.Y.-based company named for its
designers, Janet Irwin and Pattie Taylor, produces clothing with
easy closures for those who have difficulty in hooking, tying,
snapping or buttoning.
   A shirtwaist, for example, opens halfway down the front for easy
``step-in'' dressing and fastens with a zipper-like strip of Velcro
to eliminate buttoning.
   An ``Elegant Ease'' line has back-opening apparel for women who
use wheelchairs.
   Irwin and Taylor say they worked with occupational and physical
therapists to develop the clothing. Research, they say, showed many
women between the ages of 46 and 65 needed pants that didn't
require pulling on. Many others had difficulty with buttons or
hooks-and-eyes.
   Their line of clothing includes dresses, undergarments, evening
clothes and sportswear.

   Maiden modesty has been out of style for
decades. And for religious women, that once meant settling for
dowdy clothes.
   But now, a small fashion industry is growing up around covering
up.
   Far from mousy, the clothes at these boutiques are the best
Italian and French imports _ at up to $1,000 a dress.
   ``I buy things that are fashion forward,'' said Judi Kalatsky,
owner of David's Den, which caters to Orthodox Jewish women in
affluent Lawrence, N.Y.
   Many Orthodox Jewish women wear sleeves that cover the elbow,
skirts that cover the knee, and high necklines.
   Many of the same dress restrictions apply to Moslem women, said
Dr. M.T. Mehdi, head of the National Council on Islamic Affairs in
New York. However, Moslem women are more likely to hire dressmakers
or make their own clothes, according to Nur Ali, a Brooklyn
couturier with a Moslem clientele.
   David's Den and other shops like it cull appropriate fashions
from top designers' collections. That saves the Orthodox shopper
from weeding out what she can't wear.
   Ms. Kalatsky said she also gets manufacturers to run off a batch
of clothes with longer hems and sleeves. Or she may order fabric
swatches so the customer can fill in a neckline.
   Since long skirts have been in style for 15 years, Orthodox
Jewish women who want to look great have had it pretty easy, said
Madeleine Novitsky, manager of Kutiel Fashions in Brooklyn.
   But now, ``everything coming from Italy is a mini,'' she said.
``I predict a problem in the coming year.''
   Ms. Novitsky pointed out that Orthodox women do shorten their
skirts when the styles are shorter. In the 1960s, ``more religious
women were walking around with skirts right by their knees.'' But
as calf-length caught on, the shorter skirt became unacceptable.
   Now, she says, the women who shop at Kutiel _ including the
manager _ could have stepped out of Vogue.
   ``OK, my leopard hat and bag do help,'' she said.

   GQ and Esquire are unquestionably the leading
magazines in the men's fashion and lifestyle field.
   But publisher Gerald Rothberg sees an affluent buying pie out
there and he wants a piece of the market. So he started MGF _ for
Men's Guide to Fashion _ three years ago. It's aimed at the younger
end of the ``well-healed'' market, the 18-to-29-year-olds, and
Rothberg says his circulation is up near 200,000 now.
   A New Yorker, Rothberg _ who once worked at Esquire _ is also
the publisher of the rock magazine Circus, now in its 18th year.
But, he says, as an independent publisher, he finds it
``dangerous'' to rely on the revenue of one magazine. So, for
years, he says, he's been looking for another kind of publication.
   He hit on MGF after reading a Sunday newspaper story by a
feminist who bemoaned the yuppie male generation as ``peacocks only
interested in themselves and their clothes.'' As an entrepreneuer,
he saw in that not a social statement but a business opportunity:
there's a market there.
   Others see similar opportunity in sharing the magazine market
for younger men, including Men's Look and Ebony Man.
   Like the others, the monthly MGF is not just about clothing
styles. It has regular features on grooming and hair style as well
as columns on fitness, a ``sex advisor'' and lifestyle articles
such as these in the March issue: ``The Truth About Steroids,''
``Your Power Breakfast'' and ``She's Your Friend _ Can She Be Your
Lover?''
   Rothberg, who serves as fashion editor as well as editor in
chief and publisher, personally visits various designers, selected
to reflect his reading market, then boils it down to a ``point of
view'' aimed at his readership. He calls it ``selective reporting.''
   And the men's ``look'' for this spring and summer? ``Loose and
comfortable,'' he says, ``with style.'' First, ``the right
lightweight suit. Then, open a button or throw on a polo shirt for
that dressed-down, casual look. It's not only comfortable for
spring. It's a smart-looking way to lounge around.''

   For men, the suit still is the thing to wear, whether it's for a
corporate look or a casual one with a T-shirt.
   Yet, many men don't know what to look for when buying a suit.
   J. Schoeneman, a private label manufacturer which has recently
started its own line of ``power clothing'' suits called DeRigueur,
offers this advice:
   _When you try on a suit, put everything you normally carry with
you _ glasses, pens _ in the pockets. Stand normally; don't correct
your posture. Wear shoes you would wear with the suit.
   _Shoulders should be wide enough to allow a straight drop along
the outside of the sleeve, from the top edge to the cuff. They
should lie evenly and smoothly.
   _Jacket length should be long enough to cover the seat entirely.
   _The jacket collar should lie smoothly against the back of the
neck.
   _Lapels should lie flat when the jacket is completely buttoned.
   _Three-eighths of an inch of shirt cuff should show below jacket
sleeve.
   _There should be no pulling on the pants through the hips, no
tugged-open pleats, no strain across the pockets.
   _Trouser hems should fall to the top of the shoe, producing a
slight break.
   Most important, says J. Schoeneman: If it doesn't fit, don't buy
it. Never have extensive alterations.

   The look in women's hair fashions this spring is natural and
decidedly female, according to hairstylists.
   ``Hair will have a soft natural look; it won't be quite as full
as in previous seasons,'' says Gordon Nelson, director of style
training for Regis Hairstylist salons.
   ``We will also see a variety of exciting new styles. There won't
be just one specific look that is this year's hot trend,'' he adds.
   ``The best new looks are close and shapely. Tops will be left
long for lots of permed-in texture and movement. New perm wrap
methods are essential to create unusual finishes with texturized
volume,'' says Nelson.
   Xenon, international creative director for the Helene Curtis
professional division, says, ``Women are finally learning that
looking professional doesn't mean the same as looking masculine.
   ``The more subdued feminine fashion looks shown for spring allow
hair to make an important, dramatic statement of its own,'' says
Xenon, in introducing a collection of perm styles for this spring.
   ``Hairstyles today are highly sculpted, yet must remain soft and
touchable. The only way to achieve this sculpted look without
weighing hair down with sticky, brittle sprays and gels is through
perming.''
   As for length, he says, ``anything goes.''
   ``Hair length is not really an issue this spring. The key to
this season's most up-to-date looks is volume and softness. Curls
are softer and looser; waves have more definition; all hairstyles
move and shine.
   ``Most of my styles involve lifting the hair up and away from
the face, emphasizing the individual woman's facial features. After
all,'' he says, ``what could be sexier or more feminine than a
woman's face?''

   ``Accessories can't be emphasized too much,'' says Marigale

   She offers some accessory ``picks'' for spring:
   _Bicolor footwear, bags and belts. ``Spectator'' accessories.
   _Sculptured handbags.
   _Woven sandals and skimmers in brown. ``Brown is essential for
spring,'' she says, ``because it works beautifully with neutrals
and with white.''
   _Watches. ``Look for bold tank faces, floating rhinestones or
sundials.''
   _Banded footwear.
   _Waist-cinching belts, 2{ to 5 inches.
   _Sterling silver or matte gold jewelry.
   _Earrings with movement. ``Look for hoops that swing from button
posts or drop earrings.''
   _Sheer hosiery. ``Especially with shorter skirts' focus on the
leg, the move is definitely towards tonal dressing for career,''
she says. ``Save your opaque hosiery for fall and winter.''

   The mini is not for the many, according to a survey published in
a newsletter for marketers.
   The especially short, thigh-high miniskirt is appropriate only
for ``the young, the skinny and the bold when they're at play,''
according to the Langer Report.
   Its findings were based on a study of women 15 to 64 years old,
conducted in Los Angeles, New York, Dallas and Kansas City during
November and December 1987.
   ``It is for a small minority of women, a minority of the time,''
said Judith Langer, publisher and co-editor of the report, which
says the ``thigh-high micro-mini is seen by women as tacky _ worn
to attract male attention, but not respect.''
   Langer Associates Inc. is a New York-based market research firm.

   What's involved in a complete wardrobe for men?
   ``Having a good wardrobe doesn't mean owning 20 suits or 30 pair
of shoes and only one sports coat,'' says Marvin Blumenfeld,
president of April-Marcus, a New York-based retailing consulting
firm. ``It means that you have something to wear for every
occasion.''
   He believes the average man's wardrobe should include at least
seven suits _four all-weather, two all-wool winter suits and a
lightweight summer suit. In addition, there should be at least
three sports coats _ ``One should be the blue blazer because it can
be used in so many different ways.''
   Blumenfeld recommends five pairs of trousers, which can be worn
with or without a jacket; 10 dress shirts (five white); five sports
shirts and at least 10 ties.

   When men shop for clothes, they tend to seek mainstream
``basics'' rather than unusual items, says a men's fashion designer.
   ``These `basics' become well-loved favorites in a man's
wardrobe, often replaced year after year,'' says Bill Windhorst, a
designer at Spiegel, the catalog retailers.
   He lists some ``must-have'' basics for a man's wardrobe:
   _ White, 100 percent cotton shirt.
   _Multipurpose blue blazer.
   _Jean jacket.
   _Worn-in blue jeans.
   _Pleated khaki pants.
   _Striped rugby shirt.
   _Polo-style shirt.
   _Striped cotton shirts.
   _Loafers.
   _Cotton sweater.
   A focus group study by Spiegel found that men generally are
``shopping shy'' and usually refer to others for help before
buying. Seventy percent of men's purchases involve a woman,
according to the study, conducted in Boston, Chicago and Los
Angeles in late 1987.

   Wholesale prices dipped 0.2 percent in
Feburary as both energy and food costs declined, including a
dramatic 70 percent tumble in the price of lettuce, the government
said.
   The decline reported Friday in the Labor Department's Producer
Price Index partially erased a 0.4 percent increase in January.
Analysts said it provided further evidence that inflation remains
tame.
   The producer index does not show two categories in which price
increases have been the most pronounced _ services and imported
goods.

   Instead of a 0.5 percent rise in sales, the Commerce Department
said Friday sales actually fell 0.2 percent during January, showing

   The New York Stock Exchange's 5-week-old
``collar'' on computerized trading appears to be an effective
therapy for easing volatility in the post-crash market and luring
back frightened investors, analysts say.
   But the restriction also makes the market less attractive to
investors who thrive on risk, which could theoretically drive them
overseas.
   Some market experts argue that the restriction would do little
to squelch another panic.

<HEAD>French Publisher Offers $415 Million To Acquire Grolier</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   French media giant Hachette SA is launching a
tender offer today for Grolier Inc., bidding $21 a share to acquire
the Connecticut-based book publisher.
   Hachette, the biggest publisher in France and the second-largest
in Europe, announced Sunday it would launch a tender offer today
aimed at acquiring the 95 percent of Grolier's roughly 19.5 million
outstanding common shares that it did not already own. Hachette put
the total cost of its offer at $415 million.
   The offer expires at midnight EST April 8 unless extended.
   Grolier stock rose 87{ cents to $15.87{ a share Friday on the
New York Stock Exchange.
   Telephone calls to Grolier's headquarters in Danbury, Conn. were
not answered Sunday.
   Hachette stated that an acquisition of Grolier would make
Hachette the world's leading encyclopedia publisher.
   ``The acquisition of Grolier is an important strategic step for
Hachette,'' stated Yves Sabouret, Hachette's chief executive
officer.
   Jean-Claude Lattes, vice president and director of Hachette's
international book publishing business, said Hachette planned to
dedicate ``substantial resources'' to the encyclopedia business
``in order to meet the rapidly expanding information needs of the
public.''
   Grolier is an international publisher of encyclopedias,
reference and educational books, juvenile books and furniture,
trade publications and yearbooks. Grolier also owns Mystic Color
Labs, a mail-order film processor.
   The company has about 7,200 employees.
   Grolier posted a profit of $22.1 million on revenue of $424.2
million in its 1987 fiscal year, up from net income of $12.5
million on revenue of $350.6 million the previous year.
   The 162-year-old Hachette, which reported sales of more than $3
billion in 1987, has operations in book and magazine publishing and
distribution, radio broadcasting, movie and television production
and outdoor advertising.
   Hachette publishes magazines such as Elle, Paris Match and a new
French edition of Fortune, and owns Curtis Circulation Co., which
it describes as the second largest national magazine distributor in
the United States.

<HEAD>New Magazines Designed for Doctors' Waiting Rooms</HEAD>
<HEAD>Laserphoto planned</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Have you ever reached for a magazine to pass the
time in a doctor's waiting room and come up with an election
analysis _ of Jimmy Carter's victory in 1976?
   Or gotten interested in a magazine story only to find the
conclusion was missing, along with the rest of page 87?
   Who hasn't found outdated or tattered magazines in the doctor's
office?
   Christopher Whittle, chairman of Whittle Communications of
Knoxville, Tenn., is prescribing a package of six new magazines
designed to fit the reading habits of people waiting for the doctor.
   But the idea makes some magazine publishers ill. They object to
a key feature of the Whittle package, which asks subscribers to
have no more than two magazines from other publishers in their
offices.
   Whittle said the provision lets him charge advertisers more for
an uncluttered, relatively exclusive publishing environment.
   ``I'm taken aback by it,'' said George Green, an executive vice
president at Hearst Magazines, which publishes Good Housekeeping
and Redbook. ``It is putting other publishers in a position where
they are not able to sell their product.''
   Some advertising agency executives also question Whittle's
proposal.
   ``If he believes his editorial product is so great, why is it
necessary to eliminate what he refers to as the worn-out, dog-eared
and soiled waiting room magazines?'' asks Richard Kostyra, media
services director for the advertising agency J. Walter Thompson.
   Whittle has heard all the objections and parodies some of them
in a series of full-page advertisements that have appeared in the
New York Times.
   In one ad, this headline appears over a photo of a torn and
smudged magazine page: ``Few things equal the special quality of
magazines in a doctor's waiting room.''
   In another full-page ad, a mob is shown assaulting a cowering
man. ``Few things have brought magazine publishers together the way
`Special Reports' has,'' reads the ad.
   Special Report is the name for six new Whittle magazines to
begin appearing quarterly in 15,000 doctors' waiting rooms in
September. The titles are Families, Sports, Fiction, Health,
Living, and Personalities.
   Whittle said each magazine is designed to be read in 27 minutes,
which he said is the average time spent in a doctor's waiting room.
   The magazines are being offered only to three types of doctors:
obstetricians-gynecologists, pediatricians and family
practitioners. Whittle declines to disclose the subscription price
but says it will be below the typical $200-300 a year that doctors
now spend on magazine subscriptions.
   But Whittle's proposal goes a lot further than a simple magazine
subscription. He said he will provide three to four copies of each
of the six titles and a magazine rack to display them. His staff
will deliver the magazines in person and return monthly to replace
any that have been taken or abused.
   ``No other company is beginning to provide the level of service
and numbers of magazines that we are going to provide,'' he said in
an interview.
   What Whittle asks in return is the assurance that Special
Reports be the ``primary magazines'' in the office, with no more
than two other titles around.
   The requirement enables Whittle to offer advertisers exclusivity
in their product categories that will help their messages stand out.
   Special Report magazines will carry 30 pages of ads in every
64-page issue and no competing products _ only one coffee
advertiser per issue, for instance.
   The minimum ad purchase is one page each quarter for a year in
all six magazines, a total of 24 ad pages. The price: $1.2 million.
   Whittle said category exclusivity and the expectation that the
magazines will reach over 70 percent of all the mothers in America
who have two or more children make his magazines worth the price
for some advertisers.
   He said the company already has sold 20 of the 30 available
advertisements for the first two years, but declined to identify
the buyers.
   Procter & Gamble Co., the biggest U.S. ad spender, describes
itself as ``very interested'' in the magazines. ``We are continuing
to explore it in depth, but have not yet signed any agreements,''
spokeswoman Sydney McHugh said.
   Rival publishers say readers may be bored by the Whittle
magazines. ``Who would want to pick up a generic quarterly when you
can read the current issue of People, Time or McCall's?'' asks Dale
W. Lang, chairman of the Working Woman-McCall's Group, which also
publishes Working Mother.
   But Whittle said he has recruited some of the finest editors in
the country, led by editor-in-chief William Rukeyser, the former
managing editor of Fortune and founding editor of Money.
   Rivals have warned they may take legal action over the issue of
limiting other magazines in waiting rooms that take Whittle's
service.
   Rodale Press Inc., which publishes Prevention and Children
magazines, has written 40,000 pediatricians, warning that Whittle's
proposal raises legal issues that could result in ``a waiting room
battle, one likely to be settled in court, one that could only
cause unfavorable publicity for doctors in the program,'' according
to Rodale executive Thomas Stoneback.
   But Whittle said he is not trying to force doctors into
anything. If doctors who take his service keep more than two other
magazines in their waiting rooms, Whittle says he simply will
remove the Special Reports.
   ``What it gets down to is, what does the doctor prefer?,''
Whittle said.

<HEAD>Dollar Down As Pound Surges On; Gold Firmer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar fell against all major currencies in
early European trading today as the British pound continued a
weeklong surge with the Conservative government split on whether to
rein in sterling.
   Gold prices rose.
   Some traders said the pound was helping to depress the dollar.
   The pound jumped more than half a cent to $1.8590, compared with
$1.8535 late Friday. The pound has risen 8 cents from a week ago.
   Sterling has been rising on expectations the government will
announce substantial tax cuts in its annual spring budget Tuesday,
and was boosted further by the government split.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher last week rejected state
intervention to depress the pound, either by selling sterling or
lowering interest rates _ thus overruling Chancellor of the
Exchequer Nigel Lawson.
   A strong pound hurts British exports. But Mrs. Thatcher believes
lowering interest rates to make the pound less attractive to
foreign investors will encourage borrowing and fuel inflation.
   After years of low-deficit budgets, Britain is heading for a
balanced budget, or even a surplus of revenue over expenditure, for
the first time in nearly 20 years.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar closed at 127.23 yen, down 0.57 yen from Friday.
Later, in London the dollar slipped further to 126.55 yen.
   Tokyo dealers said the dollar was depressed partly by
pessimistic expectations for U.S. January trade figures to be
released Thursday.
   Other dollar rates at mid-morning, compared with late Friday's
rates, included: 1.6575 West German marks, down from 1.6615; 1.3665
Swiss francs, down from 1.3720; 5.6325 French francs, down from
5.6515; 1.8624 Dutch guilders, down from 1.8680; 1.228.40 Italian
lire, down from 1.232.55; and 1.2552 Canadian dollars, down from
1.2553.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $441.80 a troy ounce,
compared with late Friday's $440.50. At mid-morning today, the
city's five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of
$441.90.
   In Zurich, the noon bid price was $441.85 dollars, up from $441
late Friday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold closed at a $444.81 bid, up $1.27
from Saturday's closing price.
   Silver was quoted in London on Monday at a bid price of $6.23 a
troy ounce, down from $6.36 late Friday.

   Stocks closed lower and the dollar fell further
against the yen in Tokyo today as traders' expectations for U.S.
trade figures for January grew more pessimistic.
   After opening at 127.35 yen, the dollar closed at 127.23 yen,
down 0.57 yen from its close of 127.80 yen on Friday, when it fell
0.40 yen. The dollar traded in a narrow range between 127.20 yen
and 127.37 yen today.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues closed at 25,433.51 points, down 110.22 points, or
0.43 percent, from Friday's close. Volume in the first section was
950 million shares, nearly half that of Friday's session.
   An exchange dealer at a major commercial bank in Tokyo said the
market was turning its attention toward the release of U.S.
merchandise trade figures for January, due to be released Thursday.
   ``It is hard to say how much impact the U.S. trade figures are
having, but compared with the end of last week we're seeing a trend
toward a stronger yen,'' the dealer said.
   Other dealers mentioned speculation that the U.S. trade deficit
would be larger than previously expected.
   Traders in the stock market also were waiting for the U.S. trade
figures, said an analyst with a major brokerage.
   ``Trading was not so heavy in the first section, aside from some
heavy industrials, steel, and electricals,'' said the analyst, who
requested anonymity.
   ``We are following what is happening in New York, but the market
is still strong, and what we are seeing here are adjustments,''
said a dealer, also speaking on condition of anonymity.

<NOTE>EDS: discussion in closed meeting; top prospects uncertain; also

   Democratic presidential candidate Richard A.
Gephardt's plan for retaliatory trade policies comes face to face
with its long-threatened demise this week following its sponsor's
poor showing on Super Tuesday.
   Lawmakers who previously had held off on a decision now have
decided to tackle the issue as they step up efforts to reach a
compromise on legislation to sharpen the U.S. edge in world markets.
   ``I expect the trade conference to finish its work by the end of
this month and we'll get it on the president's desk some time in
April,'' said Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen,
D-Texas.
   A House-Senate conference committee weighing rival versions of
the sweeping, 1,000-page trade bill had been hesitant to tamper
with the plan that Gephardt, a Missouri congressman, has made a
centerpiece of his presidential campaign.
   Majority Democrats had sought to avoid anything that might trip
up Gephardt, whose plan is part of the House version of the trade
bill but not the Senate legislation.
   The Reagan administration calls it veto bait and Japanese
businessmen expressed elation last week when Gephardt carried only
one of the 20 states _ his own _ where there was Super Tuesday
primary and caucus voting.
   After that disappointing showing, Democratic chairmen decided to
go ahead with action on the issue this week, congressional sources
said.
   The so-called Gephardt amendment would require the president to
reduce ``excess and unwarranted'' surpluses run by Japan and a few
other countries in trade with the United States. If negotiations
failed, the president would be required to use import curbs to
lower the surpluses at a 10 percent annual rate.
   The president could waive such action if he found it contrary to
the national economic interest or if the offending country were
wrestling with serious debt. But critics say the plan is a long
step toward protectionism and invites retaliation against U.S.
industries.
   Senate conferees, returning from a one-week recess, planned to
take up the Gephardt proposal along with related issues of Japanese
trade barriers at a closed caucus today, an aide to a State Finance
Committee member confirmed.
   ``Up to this point, the Senate side has been making all the
concessions and there's no question but what, come Monday, they'll
be asking the House to give up Gephardt,'' said the aide, who spoke
on the condition that he not be identified.
   House and Senate conferees have been meeting separately and thus
far the negotiations have been a ping-pong match of offers and
counter offers.
   On its face, the senators' move to drop the plan will not amount
to anything all that unusual, since the Senate never passed the
measure in the first place. It also will take some heat off of
Gephardt's fellow Democrats on the House Ways and Means Committee,
who don't want to be seen as lowering the boom on him.
   The House is expected to make a counter offer that most likely
will be couched as an effort to rescue the main thrust of
Gephardt's plan.
   The politics involved in the issue became apparent last month.
   Rep. Sam Gibbons, D-Fla., said Feb. 21 that the ``Gephardt
provision will be dropped. We're going to dump it because it's bad
policy.''
   But two days later, Ways and Means Chairman Dan Rostenkowski,
D-Ill., issued a statement saying that ``Mr. Gephardt's amendment
has not been scuttled or jettisoned.'' He said it would be part of
any eventual compromise.
   The key difference between the House and Senate versions is that
Gephardt's proposal focuses on trade surpluses while the Senate
bill calls on the president to retaliate against foreign barriers
to U.S. exports.
   In tackling the Gephardt controversy, the conferees are moving
into one of the toughest issues remaining to be resolved. But it is
not the only one.
   Senate conferees holding out for a five-year import ban on
Toshiba Corp. products are deadlocked with House counterparts, who
propose to allow the president wide latitude to discipline the
Japanese company for selling submarine silencing equipment to the
Soviet Union.
   The administration does not want the outright ban, neither side
has shown much inclination to budge and even the House conferees
say they are divided.
   There have been no meetings of a conference subcommittee
weighing a Senate provision that would require companies to give
employees advance warning of plant closings and mass layoffs. The
measure is not part of the House bill and also has been described
as potential veto bait.
   There also have been no meetings thus far on a highly
controversial amendment to the House bill that would require
disclosure of foreign ownership of property and land in the United
States.
   ``It's under huge attack from these international companies and
foreign lobbyists as well as the White House that don't want to see
any disclosure of foreign ownership at all,'' says Rep. John
Bryant, D-Texas, the sponsor of the measure. He said last week the
provision probably has a 50-50 chance of getting to the president's
desk.

   The Environmental Protection Agency says it
will not launch a special study of a widely used herbicide
suspected of causing cancer among farmers because other research
has not confirmed the suspicion.
   A major commercial user, however, said it won't put the chemical
back in its lineup until the cancer picture is clarified, and a
scientist with an environmental group called the EPA's decision
``outrageous.''
   The herbicide is 2,4-D, short for dichlorophenoxyacetic acid. A
1986 study said it was the fourth most widely used pesticide in the
nation, with more than 39 million pounds of active ingredient sold
the previous year.
   The great bulk of that is believed to be used for broadleaf weed
control in wheat fields, though 2,4-D also is widely used on
highway rights of way, on lawns and in forests.
   Following several scientific reports associating certain cancers
with farming or exposure to various _ and sometimes unspecified _
herbicides, the National Cancer Institute in 1986 found that
farmers in Kansas who used 2,4-D more than 20 times a year, mixing
their own formulations, had an eight times greater chance than
normal of getting a specific cancer called non-Hodgkin's lymphoma,
a cancer of the lymph system.
   Home and garden users did not face concentrations large enough
to cause concern, the study said.
   The herbicide aroused suspicion because it can be contaminated
with small amounts of chemicals related to the dioxins, though
there are no U.S. reports, and only one abroad, of contamination
with the most toxic form of dioxin.
   The contaminants of 2,4-D generally have only about 1 percent of
the cancer-causing power of the most toxic dioxin.
   In all the controversy over dioxin, a cancer called soft-tissue
sarcoma has been at the center of the issue _ and this cancer
sometimes was found in the early 2,4-D reports.
   EPA frequently puts suspicious pesticides into what it calls
``special review,'' a way of bringing the chemical to the head of
the line. The agency may call for additional studies by the
manufacturer and the reviews may end up with new use restrictions
or an outright ban.
   In this case, EPA has decided not to begin such a review.
Spokesman Al Heier confirmed trade press reports of the decision,
describing the decision as a ``tough call.''
   Animal studies, he said, ``do not suggest that it's a
carcinogen,'' and ``I think there are quite a few (human)
epidemiology studies'' that also fail to confirm the cancer-causing
ability of 2,4-D.
   It is extremely rare for a chemical to cause cancer in humans
but not in laboratory animals. The best example is arsenic.
   Officials to whom Heier referred more detailed questions did not
immediately return telephone calls. The agency plans a news
conference on Thursday to discuss its decision.
   One study of farm and forest workers in New Zealand found
elevated incidence of non-Hodgkins lymphoma and another cancer
called multiple myeloma, but did not examine exposure to
pesticides. A followup study, however, found no excess risk of
cancer as a result of exposure to chemicals of the 2,4-D class.
   Chemlawn Services Inc. stopped using 2,4-D after the National
Cancer Institute results were announced.
   The company acted ``out of concern for our employees,'' of whom
2,500 to 3,000 probably were using 2,4-D on 80 days a year, said
spokesman Steve Hardymon in Columbus, Ohio.
   It has arranged a study of employees by the institute, and will
not decide whether to resume use of 2,4-D until results are
reported, probably late next year, though EPA's decision ``probably
is right,'' said Hardymon.
   ``I think it's outrageous,'' Diane Baxter, staff scientist of
the National Coalition Against the Misuse of Pesticides, said of
the EPA's decision.
   She was particularly critical of the weight given to animal
studies that showed no effect. ``We only do animal studies when we
don't have human studies,'' but in this case a good study of humans
_ the Kansas farmers _ was outweighed by animal studies, she said.
   She said ``2,4,5-T was banned mostly because of birth defects
(among humans) in the Pacific Northwest ... and that is not
anywhere near as hard to refute as the study NCI did.''

   Federated Department Stores Inc. said today that
R.H. Macy & Co. has sweetened its friendly takeover bid, while
Campeau Corp. announced an extension until midnight Friday of its
competing $6.18 billion tender offer.
   Cincinnati-based Federated said its board of directors was
meeting here today to consider a proposal from Macy ``to revise and
improve the terms upon which Macy's would acquire Federated.''
   Federated spokesman Jim Sluzewski said he could not provide
details of the revision. Macy currently has a definitive $6.1
billion agreement to acquire Federated.
   Meanwhile, Campeau said it extended its hostile offer to buy
70.5 million of Federated's stock at $75 a share from Tuesday until
Friday to take pressure off a federal judge who was scheduled to
hear arguments today on the takeover battle.
   The extension gives Federated and Macy more time to work on a
sweetened deal.
   Shortly after Campeau's move was announced, Federated urged its
shareholders to hold onto their stock.
   On Sunday, Federated had ``reluctantly'' advised stockholders to
tender their shares under Campeau's two-tier buyout offer although
it was against merging with the Toronto developer.
   The unusual recommendation had been intended to ensure that
Federated shareholders get the higher price offered under the first
stage of Campeau's offer.
   Campeau said it would pay $75 a share in cash for 80 percent of
Federated's stock while the remaining 20 percent would be acquired
later for $44 cash per share in a subsequent merger, giving the
deal an aggregate value of $68 per share.
   In early trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Federated stock
rose $1.37{ to $67.37{.
   Federated's board said Sunday shareholders should tender their
stock to Campeau ``to insure that they are not relegated to the $44
back end'' in the event the Campeau bid were successful and their
shares were not tendered by the deadline.
   Federated noted that shareholders could withdraw shares tendered
to Campeau if the Campeau deadline were extended.
   Macy has sought a federal court injunction to extend Campeau's
Tuesday expiration. Macy contended Campeau's current offer, which
was amended from an earlier $68 per share bid for all Federated
shares, essentially is a new offer and under federal law must
remain open past its scheduled expiration.
   A hearing was set for today on the dispute, and Campeau also
planned to ask the court to strike down Federated's ``poison
pill,'' or shareholder-rights plan, which makes an unfriendly
takeover prohibitively expensive.
   Macy has offered $74.50 per share in cash for 80 percent of
Federated's stock in an bid that expires April 4. Macy plans to
swap shares in a new company, Macy's-Federated Inc., for the
remaining 20 percent of Federated shares.
   Federated said its board met Friday and unanimously reaffirmed
that the definitive merger agreement with Macy was superior to the
Campeau bid.
   Federated also said Sunday its directors and corporate
management have insisted their stock options and restricted shares
be converted to cash on the same basis as other shareholders in the
Macy-Federated merger agreement.
   A filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission revealed
last week that some 500 Federated executives would receive all cash
for their stock in the proposed Macy acquisition, while other
shareholders would get cash for only 80 percent of their shares.
   ``Senior management has taken this steop to avoid any possible
implication that they would be treated better than the company's
stockholders generally,'' Federated said in a news release.
   Federated owns department store chains including Bloomingdale's,
Burdine's, Filene's, Foley's, Rich's and Bullock's.
   Macy has nearly 100 department and specialty stores, while
Campeau owns Allied Stores Corp.
   Campeau said today it expects to obtain all the necessary
financing to complete a buyout by the March 18 expiration date.

<HEAD>Rig Count Drops By 32 To Total 946</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The number of oil and gas rigs working in the
United States decreased by 32 this week to total 946, Baker Hughes
Inc. announced.
   The total reflects the number of rigs actively exploring for oil
as of last Friday, not the number rigs producing oil. The previous
week, the count had decreased by five to 978.
   ``In a normal year, the low comes in late March or early April,
and then begins a gradual increase from that point,'' said Ike
Kerridge, a Baker Hughes economist who compiles the count. ``It is
not unusual for it to be coming down in March.''
   Kerridge said companies usually accelerate their exploration
spending as the year progresses. A year ago, the rig count stood at
761, Baker Hughes said.
   Houston-based Baker Hughes, an oil toolmaker, tallies the number
of working rigs and the count is the widely-watched industry index
of drilling activity.
   Hughes Tool Co., which merged this year with Baker International
Corp. of Orange, Calif., has kept track of the number of working
rigs since 1940.
   The rig count reached a peak of 4,500 active rigs in December
1981 _ the height of the oil boom. But as oil prices plunged to
less than $10 per 42-gallon barrel in the summer of 1986, the count
fell to 663, the lowest since Hughes began compiling figures.
   Among the major oil producing states, Oklahoma lost 14 rigs,
Ohio lost seven, New Mexico lost five, Colorado and Pennsylvania
each lost three, and Michigan and Wyoming lost one apiece.
   Kansas gained three rigs, Louisiana gained two and Texas gained
one. The states of California and North Dakota showed no change.

<TEXT>
   T. Boone Pickens' Mesa Limited
Partnership said today it has withdrawn its $1.9 billion cash offer
for Homestake Mining Co., the nation's largest gold producer.
   Mesa said in a statement it was withdrawing its $20-per-share
offer for Homestake's 93 million outstanding shares following
Homestake's rejection of the unsolicited bid earlier this month.
   Mesa owns about 3.8 percent of Homestake stock.
   Homestake's board said on March 7 the bid was inadequate and
that the company preferred to remain independent.
   Homestake, based in San Francisco, holds interests in oil and
natural gas and mines uranium, silver and gold, as does Newmont
Mining Corp., another major gold producer which was the target of
an unsuccessful hostile takeover bid by Pickens.
   Last year, New York-based Newmont was approached by Ivanhoe
Partners, another group led by Pickens, which made a $2 billion
hostile bid for control of the company.
   That move was blocked in October when a Delaware court upheld a
``market sweep'' in which Newmont's biggest shareholder, Britain's
Consolidated Gold Fields PLC, grabbed enough shares in a two-day
buying spree to raise its holdings to nearly 50 percent of Newmont
and thwart the hostile bid.
   Pickens made his reputation as a corporate raider with
high-profile bids for several major oil companies in the early
1980s, including Gulf Corp., Phillips Petroleum Co. and Unocal Corp.
   In the bids, Mesa launched hostile takeover attempts, then
pocketed millions of dollars in profits when the target companies
either were bought out by a higher bidder or repurchased its own
stock.

   The stock market showed little change in quiet
trading today as traders looked ahead to a busy and potentially
volatile week.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 4.97 to 2,039.95 by
11 a.m. on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 7 to 6 in the overall tally
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 582 up, 693 down and
466 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 41.01 million shares at
midmorning.
   Analysts said traders were reluctant to take big positions in
advance of the government's report Thursday on the nation's trade
balance for January.
   The trade deficit narrowed in the last two months of 1987, but
some analysts expect the January data to show a modest increase in
the gap between exports and imports.
   This week's trade report will come just ahead of a quarterly
``triple witching hour'' involving a group of expiring options and
futures on stock indexes.
   The past couple of witching hours have been relatively
uneventful with the adoption of new procedures designed to spread
out the impact of last-minute maneuvering by computer program
traders.
   Nevertheless, analysts say uncertainty about how it will go this
time has lent an added element of uncertainty to a marketplace
still haunted by memories of the crash last fall.
   Grolier Inc. led the active list, up 7{ at 23]. Hachette S.A. of
France made a $21-a-share offer to acquire the company.
   Homestake Mining fell 1{ to 14}. Mesa L.P. withdrew a
$20-a-share takeover bid that Homestake had opposed.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
gained .16 to 149.61. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was up .88 at 296.97.

<HEAD>Two Billion New Jobs by 2030 Would Provide Full Employment</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Close to two billion new jobs would have to be
created by 2030 if the goal of full employment were to be attained
worldwide, according to a survey published Monday by the
International Labor Office.
   Citing data from the ILO's new statistical yearbook, the survey
suggested that this goal was out of reach at current levels of
creating new employment.
   It said that globally an average 47 million new jobs are needed
each year over the next four decades to cope with the population
growth and absorb the ``armies of unemployed and underemployed.''
   The yearbook, covering data from almost 100 nations, said women
and young people continue to fare worst, but that the women's share
of the workforce increased in many parts of the world.
   However, in some developed countries, including Belgium, Italy,
and Greece, jobless rates of women were more than double than those
of men.
   The picture looked grimmest for young people. In Spain, more
than half of all teenagers and almost half of those between 20 and
25 were unmployed in 1986, and in France the rates were 27.5 and 16
percent. No statistics were available for African countries where
the problem is believed to be most serious in the Third World.
   The statistics list a decline of unemployment in 31 countries
between 1985 and 1986. Improvement was most marked in Latin
American and Caribbean countries although they still have some of
the highest unemployment rates in the world.
   Rates dropped from 12.1 percent to 8.7 percent in Chile; from
21.8 percent to 18.9 percent in Puerto Rico; from 11.8 percent to
8.2 percent in Peru; and from 14 percent to 10.3 percent in
Venezuela.
   The trend was also downward in the United States, from 7.1 to
6.9 percent. The hardest hit European country was Spain, but the
rate also declined slightly from 21.9 percent to 21.5 percent. By
contrast, Ireland's rate was up from 17.8 percent to 18.2 percent.
   Switzerland, with a rate of 0.8 percent, ranked at the bottom of
the survey. China and Norway, at 2 percent, and Japan, at 2.8
percent, also reported almost full employment.

<HEAD>J.P. Stevens Accepts Takeover Bid From Investment Firm</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   J.P. Stevens & Co. said today it has accepted a
nearly $1 billion cash buyout bid from a group led by Odyssey
Partners, a private New York investment firm.
   The bid tops recent offers from rival West Point-Pepperell Inc.
and Stevens senior management.
   Under the approved tender offer, Odyssey and unnamed private
investors have agreed to pay $61.50 for each of Stevens' 15.5
million shares outstanding, or around $953.24 million.
   The deal is subject to a majority of the shares being tendered
and the necessary financing being obtained.
   Odyssey said it would finance the deal through a $600 million
loan from Citibank N.A., $570 million of subordinated debt and
preferred stock and a $100 million equity investment.
   Stevens said the offer was approved by a committee of outside
directors formed last month to consider a leveraged buyout from a
group led by the fifth generation member of the family that founded
Stevens in 1813.
   The management group recently sweetened its bid to $55 a share
in cash and securities from $43 a share, after West
Point-Pepperell's $56-a-share offer.
   Stevens is a leading manufacturer of textile products,
principally home fashion textiles. In 1987 it earned $56 million on
salesof $1.6 billion.
   Odyssey is a private investment company. Its deals included the
purchase of controlling interest in Lucky Stores Inc.'s Eagle Food
Stores, located in the Midwest, and a leveraged buyout of Research
Cottrell Inc., a pollution control, engineering and construction
company.

<HEAD>Lawmakers Petition for Oraflex Victims Trust Fund</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A non-partisan group of 100 lawmakers Monday asked
Eli Lilly & Co. to set up a trust fund for victims of side effects
of its anti-arthritis drug Oraflex.
   The lawmakers wrote to Lilly President Richard Wood asking that
the company bring compensation for British claimants into line with
that offered American claimants.
   ``The total of 2.275 million pounds ($4.1 million) for 1,354
people is extraordinarily low compared wth the roughly equivalent
sum paid in compensation to one American sufferer,'' said the
letter.
   It said the differences between British and U.S. legal systems
did not justify lower payments to British claimants while the
Indianapolis-based company offered $50 million to 103 U.S.
claimants.
   Derek Anthony, a spokesman for Lilly Industries, the British
subsidiary of Eli Lilly, said he would not comment on the amount of
compensation offered to U.S. or British claimants because of
confidentiality.
   He said, however, that about 98 percent of the British claimants
had accepted the settlement.
   Anthony said he could not comment on the lawmakers' letter
because he had not seen it.
   The drug, known as Opren in Europe, was withdrawn worldwide in
1982 because of complaints of serious side-effects, including
damage to skin, kidneys and liver.
   The Opren Action Committee in Britain said doctors had linked it
to 83 deaths and nearly 4,000 cases of adverse reactions.

   Ply-Gem Industries Inc. and Wolverine
Technologies Monday announced a merger agreement involving a

   Ply-Gem secured financing from Manufacturers Hanover for the
$18.50-a-share offer for Wolverine's 3,285,000 shares of common
stock, said Diane Cady, a Ply-Gem spokeswoman reached in New York.
   Wolverine is a major manufacturer of vinyl siding and windows.
   Gregory C. Smith will continue as chairman and chief executive
officer and James K. Cassedy as president of Dearborn-based
Wolverine, which will be a wholly owned Ply-Gem subsidiary, the
companies said in a joint announcement.
   ``The merger with Wolverine in combination with Ply-Gem's 1986
acquisitions of Veriform Inc. and Great Lakes Window Inc. will make
Ply-Gem the leading company in the vinyl siding and vinyl window
market today,'' said Jeffrey Silverman, Ply-Gem chairman and
president.
   Ply-Gem, a maker and distributor of home improvement specialty
products such as vinyl siding and windows, decorator paneling and
fire-retardant lumber, reported 1987 revenues of $313 million.
Wolverine had revenues of $111 million for 1987.
   By midday, following the morning announcement, Ply-Gem stock was
at $13 a share, up 12{ cents on the American Stock Exchange, and
Wolverine stock was at $18.12, up 50 cents on the New York Stock
Exchange.

   Moore McCormack Resources Inc. said
Monday its board rejected as inadequate a sweetened $450 million
bid from Southdown Inc. and authorized the sale of a Moore
McCormack subsidiary as a move to enchance shareholder value.
   Last week Southdown, a Houston-based cement and energy company,
increased its tender offer for all of Moore McCormack's outstanding
common stock to $35 per share from its previous offer of $31 per
share. The initial offer valued the company at about $391 million.
   Moore McCormack called the latest bid ``inadequate and not in
the best interests'' of the company and its shareholders.
   ``The board of directors of Moore McCormack continues to believe
that remaining independent would be a superior alternative over the
long-range term,'' the company said in a statement.
   Moore McCormack's board authorized the sale of Moore McCormack
Energy Inc., the company's oil and gas subsidiary.
   The company said it is ``continuing to explore and investigate
the variety of ... transactions intended to enhance securityholder
values, other than a significant acquisition by the company.''
   Southdown said its tender offer was conditional upon the valid
tender of a majority of Moore McCormack common stock, the
invalidation of Moore McCormack's ``poison pill'' anti-takeover
defense and the acquisition of sufficient financing.
   Southdown produces and sells cement and ready-mixed concrete and
is active in oil and gas production. Moore McCormack, of Stamford,
produces building materials and is involved in oil and gas
exploration and production, mainly in Texas and Louisiana.

<TEXT>
   American electronics companies are starved for
computer chips. Japanese chip makers are raking in windfall
profits. And nobody seems quite sure what to do.
   This is the way of the world in the electronics industry, circa
March 1988. It didn't have to be this way.
   The current worldwide shortage in computer chips is a classic
manifestation of the Law of Unintended Consequences, one that has
resulted in higher prices of electronic products and even delays in
the introduction of some new computers.
   One big reason for the shortage is unobjectionable: Booming
sales of personal computers and the retooling for a new generation
of memory chips have combined to produce a cyclical squeeze on
production capacity.
   But another reason for the shortage is that a 1986 chip
agreement between the United States and Japan has backfired in a
way that should have been predictable.
   The accord, intended to benefit U.S. chip makers, was supposed
to keep the Japanese from ``dumping'' chips at unfairly low prices
while giving the Americans better access to Japan's huge market.
   What actually came about was the creation of a de facto
semiconductor cartel _ a legalized form of collusion that had the
effect of setting prices above market levels and carving up markets.
   The Japanese did raise prices of memory chips, mainly by
limiting production, but the main beneficiaries were just two U.S.
companies, Texas Instruments Inc. of Dallas and tiny Micron
Technology Inc. of Boise, Idaho.
   Texas Instruments and Micron are the only American companies
still selling dynamic random access memory chips, or D-RAMs, and
they are earning a windfall.
   Meanwhile, U.S. companies such as Digital Equipment Corp. and
Hewlett-Packard Co. are paying more for chips than their foreign
rivals pay. The consequences of that over the long term are
disquieting.
   As for U.S. access to the Japanese market, it is not happening.
It was reported in January that foreigners' share of Japan's market
had fallen every month since June.
   In Japan, Americans are bumping their heads against a concrete
ceiling. For one thing, the biggest consumers of chips in Japan are
also the biggest producers. It is unlikely they will buy from
Americans when they can take chips right off their own fabrication
lines, although pressure on them should be continued.
   Most worrisome in the long run is that the high prices Japanese
chip makers are fetching under the accord is giving them even more
money to pour into their world-leading research and development.
   In exactly the same way that Japanese automakers responded to
``voluntary'' restraints by moving upscale with cars like the Honda
Acura, Japanese chip makers are beginning to move upscale with more
complex, expensive chips that have been the domain of the Americans.
   So what needs to be done?
   The main job, obviously, is to rebuild the American chip
industry so it can compete with the Japanese without the need for a
de facto cartel. The 1986 accord has already been legally
challenged by the European Economic Community.
   Sematech seems to be a step in the right direction. The
organization, to be based in Austin, Texas, is financed by
government and industry and will work to improve manufacturing
techniques, which are considered the Achilles' heel of the U.S.
chip makers.
   A bigger problem is that many of the United States' leading chip
makers, such as Intel Corp. and National Semiconductor Corp., are
only mid-sized companies that lack the deep pockets to compete with
Japanese giants such as Hitachi Ltd. and Toshiba Corp.
   Big U.S. chip buyers such as General Electric Co. could give the
American industry a financial shot in the arm by buying the chip
makers, but they have shown little interest in the volatile and
expensive business.
   More mergers of chip companies almost surely lie ahead. The
federal government may even serve as matchmaker in some cases.
   But two of the most worthwhile steps to help the U.S. chip
business _ and thus the electronics business _ have nothing to do
with integrated circuits per se.
   Step one would be to lower the cost of borrowing for the
capital-intensive industry by cutting the federal budget deficit.
Step two would be to improve the quality of American technical
education, on which the industry depends.
   Those are long-term steps, to be sure. But Japan did not get
where it is by concentrating on the short term.

<HEAD>Standard & Poor's Changing its 500-Stock Index</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Standard & Poor's Corp. said Monday it will
restructure its widely followed index of 500 issues traded on the
New York Stock Exchange, effective April 6.
   S&P's 500 Composite Stock Price Index will no longer contain a
fixed number of industrial, utility, financial and transportation
companies. The composite index currently includes four sector
indices with a set number of stocks: 400 Industrials, 40 Utilities,
40 Financials and 20 Transportation companies.
   The investment research company said it will continue to
calculate sector indices, but they will be referred to as the S&P
Industrial Index, the Utilities Index, the Financial Index and the
Transportation Index. The composite index will still contain a
total of 500 companies.
   Although this is the first structural change in the S&P 500
index since 1976, market analysts said it shouldn't make a
significant difference for stock traders. The index, which
represents more than $2 trillion in market value, is used as the
basis for many index-linked investment funds.
   S&P said the revamping is designed to respond to economic
changes.
   The change ``reflects a major shift toward a more
service-oriented U.S. economy, illustrated by the increasing number
of highly-capitalized companies in the financial services
industry,'' said S&P Executive Vice President Robert S. Andrialis.
   He said the change will allow S&P to be more flexible in
choosing new companies for the index when openings occur and in
switching companies between sectors as their businesses change.
Under the current system, when a company is removed from the
500-share index, usually due to a merger or acquisition, it is
replaced by another company from the same sector.
   Now, if a transportation company were dropped, for example, it
could be replaced with an industrial, utility or financial company.
   S&P also announced that effective April 6, Primerica Corp. and
Salomon Inc. will be transferred from its composite index to its
financial index.
   Primerica, formerly American Can Co., divested itself in recent
years of its container business and has made several acquisitions
in the financial services area _ including the investment firm
Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co. in 1987.
   Salomon, formerly Phibro Corp., has shifted its main focus from
commodities trading to financial services.

<HEAD>Arab Oil Experts Convene in Baghdad, Most Ministers Absent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Arab Energy Conference opened here
Monday with many key Arab oil ministers staying away from the
missile-threatened Iraqi capital.
   The absence of influential oil ministers made it unlikely, in
the view of experts, that significant action could be taken to deal
with the current imbalance between oil prices and production.
   In addition to debating price and production, the conference
will consider some 50 papers on a variety of energy-related
subjects.
   Sources said emphasis will be given to the petrochemical
industry. One paper to be discussed makes the point that Arab
countries produce 22.1 percent of the world's oil but less than 3
percent of the world's petrochemicals.
   Another paper prepared by the Organization of Arab Petroleum
Exporting Countries estimated that the Arab world has 57.3 percent
of the world's proven oil reserves and 17.2 percent of the world's
proven gas reserves with major potential for increasing reserves of
both fuels with new technology.
   Issam Abdul-Rahim Al-Chalabi of Iraq, and his Saudi counterpart,
Hisham Nazer, were the only oil ministers from major Arab
oil-exporting countries present among 550 delegates to the four-day
conference.
   Though oil ministers of major Arab oil-producers gave personal
or professional reasons for their absences, sources suggested the
recent missile attacks by Iran and Iraq on each others' capitals
may have contributed to ministerial cancellations.
   Seven Arab nations are among 13 members of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries. Ten Arab nations belong to the
Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting States, a sponsor of the
conference along with the 22-member Arab League.
   Among OPEC or OAPEC oil ministers missing were from Kuwait,
Libya, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Algeria and Egypt.
   A paper before the conference notes that Arab oil income from
oil was $178 billion in 1981 and $52 in 1986.
   The oil cartel is currently facing deteriorating oil prices as
production exceeds demand.
   OPEC has been trying to prop up its official price of $18 per
barrel. But member nations have been forced to give discounts to
match market prices several dollars lower.
   The OPEC ministers are divided on whether to lower production
quotas in order to defend the official price or to lower the price
to defend their share of the market against non-OPEC producers.

   Stock prices marked time in quiet trading today
as traders looked ahead to a potentially volatile week.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 1.49 to 2,036.47 by
2 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 4 to 3 in the overall tally
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 619 up, 841 down and
439 unchanged.
   Analysts said traders were reluctant to take big positions in
advance of the government's report Thursday on the nation's trade
balance for January.
   The trade deficit narrowed in the last two months of 1987, but
some analysts expect the January data to show a modest increase in
the gap between exports and imports.
   This week's trade report will come just ahead of a quarterly
``triple witching hour'' involving a group of expiring options and
futures on stock indexes.
   The past couple of witching hours have been relatively
uneventful with the adoption of new procedures designed to spread
out the impact of last-minute maneuvering by computer program
traders.
   Nevertheless, analysts say uncertainty about how it will go this
time has lent an added element of uncertainty to a marketplace
still haunted by memories of the crash last fall.
   Grolier Inc. led the active list, up 8[ at 24. Hachette S.A. of
France made a $21-a-share offer to acquire the company.
   J.P. Stevens climbed 5\ to 61. The company agreed to be acquired
for $61.50 a share by an investor group.
   Homestake Mining fell 1[ to 15[. Mesa L.P. withdrew a
$20-a-share takeover bid that Homestake had opposed.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks lost
.01 to 149.44. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up .61 at 296.70.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 87.53 million shares with two
hours to go.

<HEAD>Mesa Withdraws Cash Offer for Homestake</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AMARILLO, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mesa Limited Partnership's second foray
into the gold industry fell short Monday when the group, controlled
by oilman T. Boone Pickens, withdrew its $1.88 billion cash offer
for Homestake Mining Co.
   Mesa released a statement saying it retracted its offer to
obtain the entire equity interest in Homestake, a leading gold
producer, with a negotiated transaction for a price of $20 per
share in cash.
   Mesa spokesman David H. Batchelder said the San Francisco-based
Homestake had rejected Mesa's bid. But he offered no explanation
for Mesa's move.
   The partnership made a cash offer on Feb. 29 for the 93 million
outstanding common shares of Homestake. Mesa already controlled
about 3.8 percent of Homestake's stock.
   The Mesa statement said its offer was rejected March 7 by the
board of directors of Homestake as ``inadequate and not in the best
interests of Homestake and its shareholders.''
   Homestake had 1987 earnings of $146.4 million, two-thirds coming
from Homestake's sale of its interests in an Australian mining
operation.
   The company's stock traded between $18 and $24 a share before
the Oct. 19 stock market plunge. When Pickens, Mesa general
partner, announced his offer, Homestake stock shot up $3.50 to
about $18.50 per share. Late in Monday's session, it stood at
$15.12{ per share, down $1.12{ on the New York Stock Excange.
   ``The Street didn't seem to be that excited about his going
after Homestake,'' said Bob Hill, vice president for the A.G.
Edwards investment firm in Amarillo.
   Wall Street analysts said they did not perceive Pickens' pursuit
of Homestake as a good buy.
   ``Obviously, he did or he wouldn't have gone after them,'' Hill
said of Pickens.
   Homestake Vice President Richard W. Stumbo took the bid
seriously.
   ``You always take him seriously,'' Stumbo said, adding he did
not know if Mesa's withdrawal was the end of its takeover efforts.
   Homestake holds interests in oil and natural gas and mines
uranium, silver and gold, as does Newmont Mining Corp., another
major gold producer targeted in an earlier, unsuccessful hostile
takeover bid by Pickens.
   New York-based Newmont was approached last year by Ivanhoe
Partners, a group led by Pickens, which made a $2 billion hostile
bid for control of the company.
   A Delaware court blocked the move in October when it upheld a
``market sweep'' in which Newmont's biggest shareholder, Britain's
Consolidated Gold Fields PLC, grabbed enough shares in a two-day
buying spree to raise its holdings to nearly 50 percent of Newmont
and thwart the hostile bid.
   Pickens' reputation as a corporate raider was made with
high-profile bids for several major oil companies in the early
1980s, including Gulf Corp., Phillips Petroleum Co. and Unocal Corp.
   Mesa launched hostile takeover attempts, then pocketed millions
of dollars in profits when some of the target companies either were
bought out by a higher bidder or repurchased their own stock.

<TEXT>
   Soybean futures prices soared on the Chicago
Board of Trade Monday as fears about increased soybean acreage
eased. Grain futures also closed higher.
   Prices for delivery of new-crop soybeans _ those to be harvested
this fall as opposed to those harvested last fall _ posted the
greatest gains in reaction to talk about estimates issued Monday
morning by Sparks Commodities, a private analytical firm based in
Memphis, Tenn.
   Sparks reportedly pegged 1988 U.S. soybean plantings at 57.5
million acres, just slightly above last year's 57.4 million. The
report followed an estimate of 60 million acres made last week by
Refco Inc., a large commodities trading firm.
   Sparks would not comment on the figures, which it supplies only
to its subscribers.
   ``That's not the gospel, but it's the closest thing we've got
for the time being,'' Victor Lespinasse, a trader for Dean Witter
Reynolds Inc., said of the reported Sparks estimate.
   Sparks also reportedly predicted 1988 corn plantings at 66.8
million acres compared to last year's 65.7 million. The estimate
was seen as slightly bullish for corn prices.
   The Agriculture Department will release its first crop acreage
estimates on March 31.
   At the close, wheat was 1 cent to 4 cents higher with the
contract for delivery in March at $2.93{ a bushel; corn was { cent
to 2{ cents higher with March at $1.97{ a bushel; oats were } cent
to 2 cents higher with March at $1.89{ a bushel; soybeans were 5
cents to 12 cents higher with March at $6.12\ a bushel.

   United Artists Communications Inc. announced
that is has formed Corsair Pictures, a new motion picture company
based in New York.
   Denver-based United Artists, one of the nation's biggest movie
operators with about 2,050 motion picture screens, said Monday that
Corsair will develop a slate of quality films made with low and
moderate budgets of $3 million to $10 million each.
   The new company, to be privately financed by United Artists,
will be headed by Frank Perry, a film producer and director. Perry,
who won an Academy Award nomination for best director for ``David
and Lisa,'' will be president and chief executive officer of
Corsair.
   Perry said he envisions Corsair producing three or four feature
films in its first year, although that could vary depending on the
number of quality projects and filmmakers available. ``Corsair will
be governed by quality and economic logic, not quantity,'' he said.
   Last week, United Artists and United Cable Television Corp.
agreed to combine their operations into a $3.8 billion concern that
would rank as one of the nation's biggest cable TV companies.
   United Artists has about 800,000 cable subscribers, while United
Cable has around 1.1 million.
   United Artists also announced Monday that its Taurus
Entertainment Co., a film marketing and distribution group, will
report to Perry in the future. Perry will also oversee the
company's recently acquired interest in ``Think Entertainment,'' a
movie production company founded and run by actress-producer
Shelley Duvall.
   Perry's producing and directing credits include ``Last Summer,''
``Diary of a Mad Housewife,'' ``Play It As It Lays,'' ``Rancho
Deluxe,'' ``Mommie Dearest,'' ``Compromising Positions'' and
``Hello Again.''

<TEXT>
   Husky Oil Ltd. of Canada is considering offering
Texaco Inc. a cash infusion of at least $1 billion to help persuade
Texaco to sell Husky a majority interest in Texaco Canada Ltd.,
according to a published report.
   A Texaco spokeswoman declined comment on the report carried in
Monday's editions of the Wall Street Journal. Officials at Husky,
based in Calgary, Alberta, did not return phone calls.
   The Journal said Robert Blair, co-chairman of Husky, said in an
interview he remains very interested in acquiring the Texaco unit
and will step up his efforts in a trip to New York this week.
   Blair added that Husky would be willing to pay $2.4 billion to
$2.7 billion for Texaco's 78 percent interest in the Toronto-based
unit of Texaco, the Journal said.
   The estimated purchase price does not include the possible $1
billion cash infusion from Husky, the Journal said. It was not
immediately clear what form a cash infusion might take.
   Blair told the Journal he hopes to present Texaco a ``mutually
attractive plan'' under which the two Canadian companies would
merge under Husky's control. He added that Texaco would have to
sell enough of its interest to give Husky a stake of at least 51
percent.
   Blair said his recent phone messages have not been answered by
James Kinnear, Texaco's chief executive.
   Texaco is planning to sell about $3 billion in assets as part of
its plan to emerge from Chapter 11 protection by late next month.
   Texaco filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of
federal bankruptcy law last April to forestall enforcement of a
$10.3 billion damages judgment for interfering with Pennzoil Co.'s
acquisition of an interest in Getty Oil Co. in 1984. Texaco settled
the dispute in December by agreeing to pay Pennzoil $3 billion.

   Oil prices fell sharply Monday in response to
reports that Saudi Arabia, OPEC's largest producer, had rejected
calls for new restrictions on production.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, contracts for April
delivery of West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark crude, lost 70
cents to settle at $15.59 per 42-gallon barrel.
   The contract had moved above $16 late last week after members of
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries called for a
meeting of the cartel's pricing committee to stabilize market
prices. In addition, officials of non-OPEC producers met last week
to discuss similar concerns.
   ``The Saudis believe that if current quotas are maintained,
inventories are going to come down gradually,'' said Bob Baker, an
analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   The Saudis' apparent rejection of new quotas, attributed to
officials attending an Arab Energy Conference in Baghdad, also
dimmed hopes that key members of the 13-nation OPEC cartel would
convene an emergency pricing meeting any time soon.
   ``Action is going to be taken, but not necessarily the kind
that's going to right the world in a week,'' said Baker.
   As the mood on prices turned bearish, near-term contracts for
refined products also turned downward. Wholesale gasoline for April
delivery lost 1.23 cents to 44.36 cents per gallon. Wholesale
heating oil fall 1.35 cents to 43.34 cents per gallon.
   Analysts said the slide in prices was accelerated by technical
factors as traders dumped contracts purchased in the midst of the
rally late last week.
   ``Everyone remains very, very nervous and unsure of the
(market's) direction,'' said Richard Redoglio of Merrill Lynch
Energy Futures.

   Internal documents indicate that G.D.
Searle & Co. may have misled doctors and a federal regulatory
agency about safety characteristics of its Copper-7 contraceptive,
according to an attorney representing a woman who claims the device
made her sterile.
   Wall Street reacted Monday by knocking the stock of Monsanto

   According to the documents, Searle apparently hid complaints
about the Copper-7 from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the
attorney said.
   An FDA task force recommended that a federal grand jury
investigate whether any laws were broken by Searle's allegedly
misleading reports on animal studies for a number of products,
including the Copper-7. No charges were filed.
   The Searle documents, produced for a trial set to start May 16
in St. Paul, became public last week on order of U.S. District
Judge Robert Renner. The judge rejected Searle's arguments that the
memorandums be kept confidential to protect trade secrets.
   Michael Ciresi, a Minneapolis attorney who represent Esther
Kociemba, a Melrose woman who claims to have been made infertile by
the Copper-7, said: ``These documents can be characterized as the
tip of the iceberg. Once all the documents are disclosed (to the
public), they will collectively establish without a doubt that the
Copper-7 causes (infection) and Searle knew about it, but did not
disclose it to doctors or to women.''
   Nationally, there have been 17 trials involving Searle's
Copper-7, 14 of them decided in the company's favor.
   Kociemba's case ``will be the first case tried against Searle
where the jury will be presented with evidence from Searle's files
showing what Searle knew about the hazards of the IUD, when they
knew about them and what they did about them _ which was to conceal
the information,'' Ciresi said.
   Paul Strain of Baltimore, an attorney for Searle, said, ``We are
confident when a jury hears all the evidence, reviews all the
documents and, most importantly, hears from the doctors that they
will conclude the Copper-7 is a good IUD that does not cause
infection.''
   He said that documents not yet released and defense testimony
will show that the company did not mislead anyone.
   A major issue in the suit will be whether the Copper-7 tail
string was a single strand of polypropylene incapable of
transporting infection-causing bacteria into the uterus, as Searle
contends, or if it was made up of many tiny strands that could act
as a tunnel for bacteria, as Ciresi contends.
   One of the Searle documents quotes a company official saying for
the first time that the Copper-7 string is a ``bundle of fused
micro-filaments.''
   The Copper-7 was a popular intrauterine device from 1974 to
1988, when Searle withdrew it from the market citing litigation
costs. Many American women continue to use Copper-7 IUDs and Searle
recently resumed manufacturing the device in order to fill foreign
orders.

   The dollar turned in a mixed performance against
other major currencies Monday as traders bided their time in
advance of Thursday's report on the January merchandise trade
deficit. Gold prices edged higher.
   Republic National Bank of New York said gold was bid at $441.90
a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EST, up from $441.25 an ounce late Friday.
   Traders in Europe said the dollar's immediate future was closely
tied to the British pound, which has gained 10 cents against the
dollar in the past month.
   Traders were cautious about the dollar-sterling rate on the eve
of Tuesday's British budget statement.
   Also in the offing were a Commerce Department report Tuesday on
the United States' fourth-quarter balance in the current account,
the broadest measure of trade, and Thursday's merchandise trade
figures.
   Currency traders in New York have largely been reacting to
developments overseas in the last two weeks, ever since the big
run-up in the British pound, said Keiichi Udagawa, chief trader for
the Bank of Tokyo in New York.
   ``Now it's going to be a calm before the storm, before the trade
figures,'' said Zlatko Glamuzina, chief currency dealer for the
Banco di Sicilia in New York.
   In London, the British pound edged upward to $1.8575 from
$1.8535 Friday. But later in New York, the pound finished the
trading day at $1.8540, down from $1.8562 late Friday.
   In Tokyo the dollar closed at 127.23 Japanese yen, down from
127.80 on Friday. In London the dollar traded at 126.85 yen. At the
end of the trading day in New York, the dollar sank to 126.79 yen
from 127.29 yen late Friday.
   Other late rates for the dollar in New York, compared with
Friday's late rates, included: 1.6629 West German marks, up from
1.6602; 1.3717 Swiss francs, up from 1.3696; 1.2572 Canadian
dollars, up from 1.2571; 5.6395 French francs, down from 5.6460;
and 1,231.25 Italian lire, up from 1,231.
   Other late rates for the dollar in Europe, compared with
Friday's late rates, included: 1.6645 West German marks, up from
1.6615; 1.3693 Swiss francs, down from 1.3720; 5.6375 French
francs, down from 5.6515; 1.8645 Dutch guilders, down from 1.8680;
1,227.87 Italian lire, down from 1,232.55; and 1.2577 Canadian
dollars, up from 1.2553.
   Gold bullion prices gained about 50 cents in light trading.
   The late gold price in London, the major European center, was
$441 a troy ounce bid, up from $440.50 late Friday. The late Zurich
bid price was $441.50, up from $441.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery rose 60 cents a troy ounce to $441.90 an ounce.
   Earlier in Hong Kong gold closed at $444.81 bid, up from $443.54.
   Silver bullion traded late in London at $6.22 bid a troy ounce,
down from $6.36. On New York's Comex, silver bullion for current
delivery rose 6.2 cents to $6.240 an ounce.

<HEAD>Soybean Futures Skyrocket On Private Firm's Acreage Estimate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Soybean futures prices soared as much as 13{ cents a bushel
Monday after a private crop analyst predicted only a slight
increase in soybean planting this year. Grain futures also closed
higher.
   On other markets, crude oil futures tumbled well below $16 a
barrel; livestock and meat futures advanced sharply; precious
metals posted slight gains; and stock-index futures advanced.
   Prices for delivery of new-crop soybeans _ those to be harvested
this fall as opposed to those already in storage _ posted the
greatest gains on the Chicago Board of Trade in reaction talk about
estimates issued Monday morning by Sparks Commodities Inc., a
private analytical firm based in Memphis, Tenn.
   Sparks reportedly pegged 1988 U.S. soybean plantings at 57.5
million acres, just slightly above last year's 57.4 million acres.
The report followed an estimate of about 60 million acres made last
week by Refco Inc., a large commodities trading firm.
   Earlier trade estimates have been as high as 64 million acres.
The Agriculture Department will release its first 1988 crop acreage
estimates on March 31.
   Sparks would not comment on the figures, which it supplies only
to its subscribers.
   ``That's not the gospel, but it's the closest thing we've got
for the time being,'' Victor Lespinasse, a trader for Dean Witter
Reynolds Inc., said of the reported Sparks estimate.
   Mickey Luth, Chicago-based soybean analyst for Shearson Lehman
Hutton Inc., said the Sparks estimate merely gave the soybean
market an excuse to reclaim the losses it sustained last week.
   ``You were oversold, you were in a hole,'' Luth said. ``With an
excuse to rally, that's exactly what the market did.''
   Luth said he expected 1988 soybean planting to total 58.4
million acres.
   Sparks also reportedly predicted 1988 corn plantings at 66.8
million acres compared to last year's 65.7 million. The estimate
was seen as slightly bullish for corn prices.
   Wheat settled 2} cents to 4 cents higher with the contract for
delivery in March at $2.95\ a bushel; corn was 1\ cents to 2{ cents
higher with March at $1.98\ a bushel; oats were 1 cent to 2 cents
higher with March at $1.90 a bushel; soybeans were 7{ cents to 13{
cents higher with March at $6.14} a bushel.
   Oil prices fell sharply to below $16 on the New York Mercantile
Exchange in reaction to reports that Saudi Arabia, OPEC's largest
producer, had rejected calls for new restrictions on production.
   Crude prices had moved above $16 late last week after members of
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries called for a
meeting of the cartel's pricing committee to stabilize market
prices.
   Prices for future delivery of refined products also tumbled.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 63 cents to 70 cents
lower with April at $15.59 cents a barrel; heating oil was 1.30
cents to 1.38 cents lower with April at 43.34 cents a gallon;
unleaded gasoline was 1.23 cents to 1.33 cents lower with April at
44.36 cents a gallon.
   Livestock and meat futures posted sharp gains on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange in response to stronger demand for cattle and
tighter supplies of hogs, resulting in higher cash prices for both.
   Weather worries also helped boost the livestock futures,
analysts said. A winter storm moving out of the Rocky Mountains
could slow the movement of animals to market in the northern Great
Plains states, said Tom O'Hare, an analyst in New York with Smith
Barney, Harris Upham & Co.
   Live cattle settled .70 cent to 1.18 cents higher with April at
74 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .38 cent to 1.42 cents higher
with March at 82.85 cents a pound; hogs were unchanged to 1.50
cents higher with April at 45.22 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies
were 1.40 cents to 1.90 cents higher with March at 53.57 cents a
pound.
   Silver futures advanced slightly while gold finished nearly
unchanged on the Commodity Exchange in New York.
   Gold settled unchanged to 50 cents higher with April at $443.10
a troy ounce; silver was 5.9 cents to 6.2 cents higher with March
at $6.24 a troy ounce.
   Stock-index futures gained on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange,
where the contract for March delivery of the Standard & Poor's 500
index settled .90 point higher at 266.40. The underlying spot index
gained 1.43 points, closing at 266.37.

   American Telephone & Telegraph Co. is urging
shareholders to reject a resolution from a white supremacist
organization calling on the company to phase out its affirmative
action program.
   The resolution is included in the proxy materials for the
company's annual meeting, to be held in Denver on April 20.
   The National Alliance of Arlington, Va., argues that affirmative
action programs ``may contribute towards discrimination against
white people'' and ``may contribute to a decline in the quality of
a company's work force.''
   AT&T responds that affirmative action plans are necessary to
qualify for government business, are a ``sound and fair business
practice'' and have improved employee morale and performance,
spokeswoman LuAnn Gardner said Monday.
   The National Alliance is described in the Encyclopedia of
Associations as an organization dedicated to creating racial and
cultural pride among whites and ``building a new order in American
life.''

<HEAD>Pickens: Recovering Oil Industry Won't Cure All Ills</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID SEDENO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN ANTONIO, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oilman T. Boone Pickens said Monday
the petroleum industry will recover soon, but never to the heights
reached during its boom days in the early 1980s.
   Pickens, chairman of Mesa Limited Parnership of Amarillo, said
oil should reach at least $18 a barrel by the end of the year, far
below its highs near $40 a barrel in 1982.
   Pickens told delegates to the 111th Texas and Southwestern
Cattle Raisers convention that the state needs to continue its
trend of economic diversification.
   ``Sometime, oil production in Texas won't be too important.
Taxes from the oil industry are consistently going down,'' Pickens
said.
   ``To believe that the oil industry is going to lead the state of
the doldrums we're in I don't believe it will be the case,'' he
said. ``I do believe the industry will get better over a period of
time, but it will never be the leader that we had been in the
past.''
   Pickens said the oil and gas rig count would never reach its
peak of nearly 5,000 in 1981.
   ``I don't believe in my lifetime that I will see 2,000 rigs
operating in the United States,'' Pickens said.
   Pickens said that consumers should not fear the long lines at
the pumps such as those during the Arab oil embargo of 1973 and
1974.
   ``OPEC is going to provide the floor price for you. Just give
them a little time and they'll get their act in order and they'll
give you an $18 floor,'' he said.
   Pickens said he opposed an oil import fee because it would spark
government control.

<HEAD>First City Optimistic About Closing On Bank Deal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH RENDON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Investor A. Robert Abboud said Monday he is
confident debt holders of First City Bancorporation of Texas Inc.
will surrender their notes to the bank for less than face value.
   On March 4, more than 71 percent of the Houston-based bank
holding company's 37 million shareholders approved a $1.5 billion
federal bailout plan.
   The plan _ which would be the second largest government bank
bailout _ calls for $970 million in federal assistance, a $500
million infusion of capital raised privately by an investor group
headed by Abboud, and a spinoff of $1.79 billion in book value of
poorly performing assets.
   First City, the fourth-largest bank firm in Texas, grew quickly
during the Texas oil boom, but was hammered by energy and real
estate losses when oil prices plummeted. For 1987, the company
posted a $1.1 billion loss.
   Under a buyout plan that was made a condition of the bailout,
holders of First City's debt securities would be paid less than the
face value of their notes, said Alan Whitney, director of
communications for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
   The amounts offered to note holders ranged from 35 cents to 45
cents on the dollar, he said.
   But Abboud, who would head the bank under the plan, told federal
regulators in Washington this weekend that not enough of the note
holders have agreed to sell at those prices. The agreement provides
that 90 percent of the debt holders turn over their notes by a 4
p.m. CST Tuesday deadline.
   During a Monday afternoon news conference in Houston, Abboud
would not say how many debt holders had submitted their notes, but
expressed confidence the deal can be closed by month's end.
   ``There's a high degree of confidence and enthusiasm as
presently structured,'' said Abboud, who was wearing a ``Yes We
Can! First City'' button on his lapel.
   ``I would ask the other debt holders who have not yet tendered
to cooperate with us and submit their securities. We're prepared to
close if conditions are fully satisfied,'' he added.
   Abboud said debt holders are getting more than if the bank were
liquidated.
   ``The offer on the table is basically the offer until Tuesday
afternoon,'' he said. ``There is no intent on anybody's part to
make any material changes in the monetary terms of the offering.''
   Last week, First City bonds were trading well above the prices
being offered under the bailout plan. Analysts said this indicated
that some investors were gambling that federal regulators would
come up with a higher price for the First City debt.
   The investors are betting that the FDIC, in its eagerness to
wrap up the First City deal, will either sweeten the offer or
reduce the percentage of shares that need to be tendered.
   Still other analysts said last week that the FDIC could refuse
to raise the offer for fear of setting a precedent for future bank
bailouts.
   Other options available to the FDIC, the analysts said, include
cancelling the Abboud deal and reopening bidding for the bank, or a
move by the FDIC to itself take over First City, as it did with
Continental Illinois Bank and Trust of Chicago in 1984.
   First City has assets of $11 billion and operates 59 banks in
Texas and one in South Dakota.

<HEAD>Black & Decker Releases American Standard Information</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOWSON, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Black & Decker Corp. on Monday disclosed
previously confidential information received from American Standard
Inc. that showed the takeover target expected sales and earnings to
rise substantially by 1992.
   American Standard had shared the information as part of its
negotiating strategy with Black & Decker, a tool and appliance
company that has been pursuing the plumbing and air conditioning
maker since late January.
   Black & Decker has an outstanding offer of $73 a share, or $2.27
billion, to acquire American Standard.
   It wasn't clear whether the information would influence Black &
Decker's next move. American Standard said Sunday it was
considering other bids from undisclosed suitors, including one
worth $75 a share or $2.35 billion, and gave Black & Decker until
Wednesday to make another offer.
   As quoted by Black & Decker, the information received from
American Standard included its secret five-year plan with sales and
cash flow figures and the basic economic assumptions underlying
them.
   They showed American Standard expected sales to rise from $3.8
billion this year to more than $4.7 billion by the end of 1992, and
earnings to double to $304 million.
   Both companies said the disclosure was required by federal
securities laws because it could have a bearing on whether Black &
Decker changed its position in the takeover battle. But securities
analysts said it was highly unusual that the information was
released.
   Black & Decker is involved in a ``contentious battle,'' said
William H. Miller, who follows the company for Legg, Mason, Wood,
Walker in Baltimore. ``If the information works to discourage
another bidder, that works in Black & Decker's interest,'' he said.
If the returns look crummy, it could discourage someone else.''
   Stanley Fishman, analyst for Fahnestock & Co., in New York, said
``I've never heard of that before. Confidential means confidential
where I was brought up.
   ``If it is not unique, it's nearly unique,'' said Fishman. ``We
(analysts) can't even get five-year forecasts.''

   Share prices closed slightly higher in thin
trading Monday in what traders said was cautious optimism ahead of
Tuesday's release of the British budget.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index closed up 7.9
points at 1,819.5. The index had been up by 9.0 points at
mid-afternoon after a Wall Street slightly higher than Friday's
close.
   Volume fell to 337.1 million shares from 688.2 million on Friday.
   Traders said many participants stayed on the sidelines ahead of
Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson's budget speech to
Parliament on Tuesday.
   Economists are forecasting personal tax cuts amounting to 3
billion to 4 billion pounds _ about $5.5 billion to $7.4 billion at
current exxchange rates _ and a fiscal 1989 budget that is balanced
or slightly in surplus.
   Also boosting shares were better-than-expected results from
Glaxo Holdings, the giant pharmaceuticals concern, traders said.
Glaxo announced its pre-tax profit rose 5.6 percent to 397 million
pounds in the six months ended Dec. 31, exceeding market
expectations.
   Glaxo finished up 27 pence at 10.82 pounds a share.

<HEAD>Media General Again Spurns Sugarman Bid, Files Suit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Newspaper and television station operator
Media General Inc. said Monday it sued unwanted suitor Burt
Sugarman, the Los Angeles-based investor and TV producer, accusing
him of making statements designed to create speculation in Media
General's stock.
   The suit filed in federal court in Richmond, Va., where Media
General is based, seeks an injunction barring Sugarman from such
actions and requiring Sugarman to sell the 10 percent of the
company's stock he has acquired.
   The suit also seeks unspecified monetary damages.
   At the same time, Media General said its board had ``carefully
considered'' Sugarman's $61.50 per share, or $1.58 billion, offer
for the 90 percent of the company he doesn't already own and
decided not to pursue it.
   Sugarman was out of the office and not available for comment, a
receptionist said.
   The suit accuses Sugarman of making ``inaccurate and
incomplete'' statements to the press and in Securities and Exchange
Commission filings `designed to create speculation concerning Media
General stock and to help him in a possible proxy contest.''
   The suit also claims Sugarman has, in effect, begun seeking
proxies through his statements in the press without filing required
SEC documents in advance.
   Media General's stock closed Monday at $47.25, down 37{ cents.
   The suit is the latest salvo in two-week-old tug of war between
Sugarman and the family of Media General's chairman, D. Tennant
Bryan, which controls a majority of the company's voting power.
   If Sugarman succeeds in putting his proposal before
shareholders, the company said, the Tennant family will vote
against it.
   The Tennant family owns 71 percent of the company's Class B
common stock. Although there are only 559,168 Class B shares, they
have the voting power to elect seven of the company's 10 directors.
   Media General has 28 million Class A shares, which have one vote
each and elect three directors.
   Sugarman, who owns 10 percent of the company's Class A stock and
none of the Class B, has argued that the disproportionate voting
rule doesn't apply if a holder of more than 10 percent of the
company's stock proposes a merger.
   Media General says its counsel disagrees.
   Media General, based in Richmond, owns a number of daily
newspapers, including the Richmond (Va.) Times-Dispatch and News
Leader, the Winston-Salem (N.C.) Journal and the Tampa (Fla.)
Tribune, plus 32 weeklies in Southern California and a 40 percent
interest in Garden State Newspapers Inc. that owns 18 dailies and
four weeklies in eight states.
   It also owns television stations, including WCBD-TV in
Charleston, S.C., WJKS-TV in Jacksonville, Fla., and WXFL-TV in
Tampa, Fla.
   Sugarman is making the takeover offer through two companies he
controls _ Barris Industries Inc., the maker of successful
televison programs such as ``The Dating Game'' and ``The Gong
Show,'' and Giant Group Ltd., the parent of Keystone Cement Co. and
Giant Cement Co.

   Federated Department Stores Inc. on Monday
agreed to a sweetened friendly merger with R.H. Macy & Co., which
upped its initial bid by $200 million in cash to $6.3 billion,
giving it an edge over hostile competitor Campeau Corp.
   Under terms of the amended merger agreement unanimously approved
by the Federated board, Macy will offer $77.35 a share in cash for
80 percent of Federated's stock, up from $74.50 per share for the
same portion in its original offer.
   Macy plans to swap shares in a new company _ Macy's-Federated
Inc. _ and issue convertible debt securities for the remaining 20
percent of Federated shares. The offer expires on April 4.
   Meanwhile, Toronto-based Campeau indicated it had no immediate
intention of revising its rival bid. The company late Monday
extended its $6.18 billion tender offer through Friday in advance
of a court hearing over suits filed by both sides to challenge each
other's bids.
   U.S. District Judge Leonard Sand indicated at the lengthy
evening hearing that he would not rule before Wednesday either on
Macy's request to force Campeau to extend its tender offer past
Friday or on Campeau's challenge to Federated's ``poison pill''
takeover defense.
   Sand said he was seeking an opinion from the Securities and
Exchange Commission on Macy's contention that Campeau's latest
tender offer _ which was revised from a previous, lower bid _
constitutes a brand-new offer that must remain open past its
scheduled expiration. Macy hopes that by forcing Campeau to extend
its offer it will ease the pressure on Federated stockholders to
accept the Canadian company's bid.
   The judge said he would not get the SEC opinion before Wednesday
and would not rule on either suit before then.
   However, Sand stated that both buyout offers would have to
remain in effect for at least three business days after he ruled on
the poison pill issue, effectively extending Campeau's offer
through next week.
   Federated stock closed unchanged at $66 a share on the New York
Stock Exchange.
   In consideration for the sweetened offer from Macy, Federated
granted Macy a ``lockup'' option to purchase its
Bullock's-Bullock's Wilshire and I. Magnin retail divisions if the
merger is not successful. Federated said the divisions would sell
for at least $800 million and $150 million, respectively.
   Campeau has valued those divisions at a total of about $1.25
billion.
   Additionally, Macy granted Federated's board ``sole discretion''
over whether to maintain its ``poison pill,'' or shareholder-rights
plan, which makes unwanted takeovers prohibitively expensive. Under
its previous agreement, Cincinnati-based Federated would have
rescinded the plan in a merger with Macy.
   In recommending shareholders tender their stock to Macy,
Federated called the new offer ``substantially more favorable to
Federated stockholders than Macy's previous offer and the coercive
Campeau two-tier offer.''
   Campeau on Monday extended its hostile offer to buy 70.5 million
of Federated's stock, or 80 percent, at $75 a share from Tuesday
until Friday to take pressure off the federal judge who was to
preside over the courtroom battle.
   Campeau said the remaining 20 percent of Federated stock would
be acquired later for $44 cash per share in a subsequent merger,
giving the deal an aggregate value of $68 per share.
   Shortly after Campeau's move was announced, Federated urged its
shareholders to hold onto their stock, reversing an unusual
recommendation issued Sunday, when Federated ``reluctantly''
advised shareholders to tender their shares.
   Although Federated is opposed to merging with Campeau, the
retailer intended to make sure its shareholders got the higher
price offered in the first stage of Campeau's two-tier buyout bid.
   Federated said later Monday that its board again might advise
shareholders to tender to Campeau ``to avoid the risk of being
relegated'' to the $44-a-share ``backend.''
   If Campeau were to succeed in its bid, Federated vowed to go to
court, and urged shareholders to do the same rather than
``accepting the grossly inadequate price which Campeau has proposed
for its backend merger.''
   Federated owns department store chains including Bloomingdale's,
Burdine's, Filene's, Foley's, Rich's and Bullock's. Campeau has
indicated that if successful in acquiring Federated it planned to
sell Filene's and Foley's to May Department Stores Co. for about
$1.5 billion.
   Macy has nearly 100 department and specialty stores, while
Campeau owns Allied Stores Corp.
   Campeau said it expects to obtain all the necessary financing to
complete its buyout by the March 18 expiration date, but Federated
repeatedly has challenged that claim.

<HEAD>Contintenal Cited For Tying IRS Plan to Flying Their Skies</HEAD>

   A Continental Airlines advertisement designed to
catch readers' attention has caught some flak from the New York
City Consumer Affairs Department.
   The department said Monday it had cited the airline for a March
10 ad in the New York Times that it claims gave the false
impression that the U.S. Internal Revenue Service was involved with
the airline's promotion.
   The ad in question stated: ``Fly Continental to be out of the
country on April 15 and the IRS will allow you an automatic filing
extension.''
   Angelo Aponte, commissioner of Consumer Affairs, said the ad
falsely implied a sponsorship by the IRS and falsely asserted that
consumers must leave the country in order to get the automatic
extension to file.
   Aponte also said the ad failed to give important information
concerning the filing of extensions.
   Bruce Hicks, a spokesman at Continental's Houston headquarters,
said an IRS official indicated last week there were no problems
with the ad and that it was straightforward and accurate.
   ``We're mostly very puzzled that the department would insinuate
itself into an issue where there is no argument,'' Hicks said.
``The IRS has stated that it has no problems whatsoever with the
advertisement.''
   Gary Walker, a spokesman for the consumer affairs department,
said Continental was cited Friday and sent a notice via overnight
mail to its headquarters. Continental was directed to send a
representative to the department on March 25 and pay fines of up to
$500 for each violation.
   Hicks said no one at the airline's headquarters had seen the
notice, but the airline's representatives would attempt to clear up
the issue with the consumer affairs department.
