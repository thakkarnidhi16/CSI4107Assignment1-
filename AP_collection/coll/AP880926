   Lehrer: Peter Jennings, a question for the vice president.
   Jennings: Mr. Vice President, I'm struck by your discussion of
women and the sanctity of life and it leads me to recall your own
phrase that you are ``haunted'' by the lives which children in our
inner cities live.
   Certainly the evidence is compelling, there's an explosion of
single-parent families, and by any measure these single-parent
families _ many with unwanted children _ are the source of poverty,
school dropouts, crime which many people in the inner city simply
feel is out of control.
   If it haunts you so, why over the eight years of the Reagan-Bush
administration have so many programs designed to help the inner
cities been eliminated or cut?
   Bush: One of the reasons _ and I first would like to know which
programs you're talking about and then we could talk on the merits
of the programs _ but you see my fundamental philosophy is give
local and state government as much control as possible.
   That might be the explanation if you tell me the program. I do
strongly support the WIC program. I think it is good.
   I think part of the answer to the haunting of these children
that are out there and suffering lies in extension of Medicaid to
challenge the states and maybe, maybe we're going to have to
enforce more on the states in terms of Medicaid taking care of
these.
   But, Peter, so much of it is _ gets into a whole other phase of
things. The neighborhood, the kind of environment people are
growing up in.
   And that leads me to the programs I'm talking about in terms of
education. I think part of it is the crime-infested neighborhoods,
and that's why I'm a strong believer in trying to control crimes in
the neighborhood, why I was so pleased to be endorsed by the
policemen on the beat _ the Boston Police Department _ the other
day. I think they understand my commitment to helping them in the
neighborhoods.
   And so, it's a combination of these things. But do not erode out
of the system the thousand points of light, the people that are out
there trying to help these kids, the programs like cities and
schools, the work that Barbara Bush is doing so people can learn to
read in this country, and then go on and break this cycle of
poverty.
   I'm for Head Start, moving that up, and I've already made a
proposal. And yes, it'll cost some money, but I favor that. So
these are the combination of things I want, and the fact that I
don't think the federal government can endorse a $35 billion
program does not mean I have less compassion than the person who
endorses such a program.
   Q. Governor?
   Dukakis: Well, I must have been living through a different eight
years from the one that the vice president's been living through,
because this administration has cut and slashed and cut and slashed
programs for children, for nutrition, for the kinds of things that
can help these youngsters to live better lives.
   It's cut federal aid to education; it has cut Pell Grants and
loans to close the door to college opportunity on youngsters all
over this country.
   And that, too, is a major difference between the vice president
and me. Let me just give you one other example.
   We have a great many people _ hundreds of thousands of people _
living on public assistance in this country. The 50 governors of
this nation have proposed to the Congress that we help those
families to get off of welfare, help those youngsters, help their
mothers to become independent and self-sufficient.
   It's taken months and months and months to get Mr. Bush and the
administration to support that legislation, and they're still
resisting.
   Now, that's the way you help people. Being haunted _ ``a
thousand points of light'' _ I don't know what that means.
   I know what strong political leadership is. I know what's
happened over the course of the past eight years. These programs
have been cut and slashed and butchered, and they've hurt kids all
over this country.

   Jennings: Governor, the crisis is no less a crisis for you if
you were elected president. Where would you get the money to devote
to the inner cities, which is clearly needed? And can you be
specific about the programs not only you'd reinstate, but the more
imaginative ones that you'd begin?
   Dukakis: Well, I said a few minutes ago, Peter, that you could
improve the lives of families and youngsters and save money at the
same time. Welfare reform is one way to do it.
   If we invest in job training, in child care for those
youngsters, in some extended health benefits so that that mother
and her kids don't lose their health benefits when she goes to
work, we can help, literally, hundreds of thousands, if not
millions, of families to get off of welfare, to become independent
and self-sufficient, to be taxpaying citizens, and to improve their
lives _ the quality of lives, their futures, and the futures of
those children. That's just one example of how you can save money
and improve the quality of life at the same time.
   In my own state, for example, we now have that universal health
care system, which the vice president opposes, I think very
unwisely. One of the greatest barriers to opportunity for a family
and for those children is the threat that they may lose their
health insurance. Think about that father down there in Houston who
has to tell his youngster that he can't play Little League ball,
that he can't go out on that ball field, because he's afraid he's
going to get hurt.
   And, yet, Mr. Bush says, ``Well, I don't think we ought to
expect businesses to provide health insurance for their
employees.'' When responsible employers, a majority of employers in
this country do and are paying more for their insurance to
reimburse hospitals for free care on account of people that are not
employed, that are not insured that have to go to that hospital.
   So, these are the ways that you help families, you help
youngsters to live better lives and more decent lives. And we're
ready to go to work at the state and local level, all of us. I know
the private sector is. People are all over the country. But, it
takes presidential leadership. It takes a commitment to being
involved and to leading. And that's the kind of presidency I want
to lead.

   Anita O'Hearn has come up with a
not-so-subtle way to attract suitors: a huge balloon tethered to a
building by a heavily traveled interstate that reads, ``MARRY ME!!!
INTERESTED?''
   The 12-foot by 10-foot balloon floating along Interstate 680
near this San Francisco Bay area city also sports a painting of a
platinum blonde in a black velvet dress reclining on a red couch _
and O'Hearn's phone number.
   A call to that number gets a tape-recorded voice of O'Hearn
singing ``The Man I Love.''
   Callers also get a letter and a questionnaire from O'Hearn, who
describes herself as the over-40, 250-pound, almost 6-foot-tall
``blonde on the balloon.'' She says she is a professional singer,
comedian, writer and entrepreneur.
   ``If you are still interested and would love a woman who just
fell, fully clothed, out of a Rubens painting ... read on,'' she
said in her letter.
   O'Hearn said recently that she's gotten 20 calls so far.

   Children can begin learning about banking at a
tender age at the First Children's Bank, which has opened at famed
toy store F.A.O. Schwarz.
   The bank, which drew more than 2,000 youngsters and their
parents to its opening Sunday, will offer savings and deposit
accounts, sell certificates of deposit and hold lectures and
seminars on banking and money, according to a news release.
   ``If this bank can help young people learn more about financial
matters, then maybe it won't be such a daunting experience when
they take out their first mortgage 20 years later,'' said Neale S.
Godfrey, president and chief operating officer of the First Women's
Bank, which opened the children's bank.
   She said the idea for the bank came to her two years ago after
her daughter asked why there was bank for adults and not for
children.
   Savings accounts may be opened on behalf of children of any age.
Checking accounts must be opened jointly with a child of at least 6
years old and an adult, both of whom must sign the checks.

   Union officials and Bay Area Rapid
Transit authorities reached a tentative contract settlement Sunday
on the eve of a threatened strike that would affect about 100,000
commuters on the 71-mile train line.
   ``Both sides compromised and compromised, and then we met _ sort
of happily _ in the middle,'' said Suzanne Angeli, vice president
of Public Employees Union Local 790.
   Union negotiators and BART officials held face-to-face talks
throughout the weekend with a state mediator before a settlement
was reached late Sunday afternoon. The agreement was announced at a
joint news conference Sunday evening.
   A ratification vote is set for Wednesday, and Local 790
President Milt Waalkens predicted approval.
   ``I think they will be as happy as they can be with what we've
gotten,'' he said.
   Details of the tentative settlement were not released.
   A strike had been called for Monday morning after 1,200
janitors, maintenance workers and clerks rejected a contract offer
last week. As negotiations took place Sunday, agency managers were
being trained in operations of the train system, BART spokesman Sy
Mouber said.
   A wildcat strike threatened for Sunday by union representatives
angry about the training did not materialize, Mouber said. BART
hoped the training would enable it to operate about half its normal
service Monday with the use of 42 management employees.
   Another union, which represents 500 station agents and train
operators had agreed to a contract with BART but promised to honor
Local 790's picket lines. Those lines had been scheduled to form at
6 a.m. Monday at 34 stations.
   The disputed contract proposals involved profits from retirement
fund investments, union activity during work hours, sick leave
restrictions and overtime.

   Lehrer: Mr. Vice President.
   Bush: What troubles me is that when I talk of the voluntary
sector and a ``thousand points of light'' and a thousand different
ways to help on these problems, the man has just said he doesn't
understand what I'm talking about. And this is the problem I have
with the big-spending liberals. They think the only way to do it is
for the federal government to do it all.
   The fact happens to be that education spending is up by the
federal government. It is up, it is not down.
   The federal, but here's the point he misses, the federal
government spends 7 percent of the total money on education, and
the rest of the state governments and local governments, and the
``thousand points of light'' _ and I'm talking about private
schools, and private church schools, and things of this nature _
are putting up 93 percent.
   But the federal spending for education is up. And I want to be
the ``education president,'' because I want to see us do better.
   We're putting more money per child into education, and we are
not performing as we should.
   We've gotten away from the values and the fundamentals, and I
would like to urge the school superintendents and the others around
the country to stand up now and keep us moving forward on a path
toward real excellence. And we can do it, but it's not going to be
dictated by some federal bureaucracy in Washington, D.C.
   Lehrer: All right. Let's move now to some questions on foreign
and national security policy. John Mashek will ask the first
question of the governor.
   Mashek: Governor, the vice president continually refers to your
lack of experience, weakness, naivete on foreign policy and
national security matters. He says you are prepared to eliminate
weapons systems that will result in the unilateral disarmament of
this country. Is that true?
   Dukakis: Of course not. Of course, that's a charge that's always
made against any governor who runs for the presidency. I think it
was one of the things that Mr. Bush said about Mr. Reagan back in
1980. Remember that, George?
   And yet, some of our finest presidents, some of our strongest
international leaders were governors: Franklin Roosevelt, Woodrow
Wilson, Theodore Roosevelt.
   It's not the amount of time you've spent in Washington, it's not
the length of your resume.
   It's your strength, it's your values, it's the quality of the
people you pick, it's your understanding of the forces of change
that are sweeping the world, and whether or not you're in a
position to provide leadership to make those forces of change work
for us and not against us.

   President Reagan promised to outline his view
of what lies ahead for the world as he went before the United
Nations today for his seventh appearance and his last before
leaving office.
   Asked as he returned from a weekend at Camp David, Md., on
Sunday whether he was looking forward to his annual visit for the
opening of the General Assembly in New York, the president answered
with a single word: ``Yes.''
   An official who spoke on the condition of anonymity said over
the weekend that Reagan would deal in his speech with the thorny
issue of chemical weapons, which the United States and many other
Western nations manufacture.
   The president's national security adviser, Lt. Gen. Colin L.
Powell, predicted last week that the president also would press
efforts to stem the proliferation of such weapons in individual
talks with world leaders.
   Reagan has addressed the opening session of the General Assembly
each year since 1983. He also spoke at a special U.N. session on
disarmament in 1982.
   In his weekly radio speech Saturday, the president said he would
talk today about his administration's record of ``successes for our
philosophy of peace through strength.''
   ``The great question now is, what next?'' he added. ``Where does
the world go in the next eight years and the next 80 years? What
are the steps we might take toward a safer, better, freer world?
And I'll have some thoughts of my own on Monday.''
   ``One thing is certain,'' he said. `If we're to continue to
advance world peace and human freedom, America must remain strong.
We must turn a deaf ear to those born-again patriots who talk about
strength while serving up the same old menu of weakness.''
   The president didn't say whom he was talking about, but the
words were similar to those he has used to describe the campaign of
Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis.
   After his speech, the president planned to meet with U.N.
Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar; with senior advisers at
the U.S. mission to the United Nations; with Egyptian Foreign
Minister Esmat Abdel-Meguid and Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon
Peres; with President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe; with Sheik Sabah
Al-Ahmed, foreign minister of Kuwait; and with members of the
Persian Gulf Cooperation Council.
   Powell told reporters the United States is ``committed to a
comprehensive, worldwide ban on chemical weapons'' and he expected
Reagan to ``press the issue'' in his talks.
   Both Iran and Iraq used chemical weapons in their eight-year
Persian Gulf war. In addition, the United States has accused Iraq
of using poison gas against its Kurdish minority.
   It will be Reagan's first meeting with Perez de Cuellar since
the White House's announcement on Sept. 13 that the president was
releasing $188 million the United States had withheld from the
organization to show displeasure with U.N. budgetary and hiring
practices.
   Powell said the United Nations had responded to U.S. suggestions
by making changes in its budget procedures and the size of its
staff and that the president wanted to recognize this as well as
the fact that the organization ``has started to play a more
important role around the world in helping to deal with regional
conflicts.''

<HEAD>U.S.-Soviet Exhibit Showcases Rare Alaskan Artifacts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When Spencer Fullerton Baird sent a team of
scientists to Russian Alaska in 1865, he expected them to return to
the Smithsonian Institution with samples of birds, animals and
Eskimo artifacts.
   They brought back all that, as well as evidence of mineral
wealth that helped persuade a reluctant Congress two years later to
spend $7.2 million to buy Alaska from the Russian czar. ``Seward's
Folly'' it was called, after William Henry Seward, who was then
secretary of state.
   Many of the samples collected in those and later expeditions,
including some native American hunting cloaks of astounding beauty,
have gone on display at a joint U.S.-Soviet exhibit that also
features samples collected by 18th century Russian pioneers but
never before shown. The exhibit is at the Smithsonian's Museum of
Natural History.
   ``This is a story that no one country can tell,'' said William
Fitzhugh, curator of the show, which is the fruit of a decade of
planning and cooperation between American and Soviet
anthropologists.
   The exhibit, ``Crossroads of Continents: Cultures of Siberia and
Alaska,'' also highlights recent scientific findings about the
migration of people across the Bering Strait 11,000 years to 12,000
years ago and the development of native American culture in the far
Northwest.
   And now, 121 years after Alaska was sold for a song, Russian
scholars flocked to the Smithsonian last week for a series of
seminars on the links between ethnic groups in Far Eastern Siberia
and the Eskimo, Aleut, Athapaskan, Eyak and Tlingit peoples of
Alaska and northwestern Canada.
   ``So we learn that the Smithsonian played a leading role in
convincing Congress in the 19th century to buy Alaska,'' said
Aleksandr Potemkin, cultural attache at the Soviet Embassy in
Washington.
   ``It is the same Smithsonian Institution that is playing a
leading role in bringing the neighbors together again,'' he said.
   The exhibition, part of increased cultural cooperation between
the superpowers, breaks new ground in several respects.
   It provides Western scholars with their first look at examples
of Eskimo and Tlingit art collected for the czars by explorers like
Vitus Bering, and by scientists and Russian traders who settled as
far south as San Francisco. Many of the objects have been stored
out of public sight in the Museum of Anthropology and Ethnography,
the oldest museum in the Soviet Union, founded in what is now
Leningrad by Peter the Great in 1714.
   In another first, after the exhibition tours the United States,
with stops in Seattle, New York, Indianapolis and Anchorage, it
will go to Ottawa, Canada, and then to Moscow, Leningrad and two
Soviet cities yet to be chosen.
   The rich collection of clothes, hunting devices and other
utensils on display testify to the links between the native
cultures of Siberia and Alaska, and also the differences.
   Many of the Siberian peoples, said Fitzhugh, learned to raise
herds of reindeer. That form of life involves a more complex social
structure than that of the Alaska peoples, who remained largely
hunter-gatherers.
   ``The hunters had a spiritual relation with the animals that
were their prey,'' said Fitzhugh. And when they hunted, they wore
their best clothes, including one elaborate cloak sewn of gut and
decorated with cormorant feathers, Fitzhugh's favorite object in
the exhibit.

   The Metropolitan Opera's 105th season may be
opening with something of a musical whimper, but it promises to end
with a bang.
   The gold curtain will rise tonight on a production of Verdi's
``Il Trovatore'' that, when it premiered last season, provoked some
of the most scathing critical catcalls in recent memory.
   When the season ends in May, it will be with a musical event of
historic proportions _ three performances of Wagner's four-opera
Ring Cycle, not seen in its entirety at the Met for a generation.
   In between are a number of promising evenings _ starting with
the second night of the season when Handel's ``Giulio Cesare'' will
be presented at the Met for the first time. Kathleen Battle and
Tatyana Troyanos will star, along with Jeffrey Gall, the first
countertenor ever to sing at the Met.
   The Handel masterpiece will be conducted by Trevor Pinnock, the
British early music specialist who not only has never conducted at
the Met before but has never conducted any opera before. He will be
leading an orchestra of about 30 players, unusually small for the
Met pit.
   By contrast, there is little new or unusual about ``Il
Trovatore.'' Met artistic director James Levine will conduct an
all-star cast that includes Luciano Pavarotti, Eva Marton and
Sherrill Milnes, but whether they can overcome the dreary staging
remains to be seen.
   ``Normally it takes a new opera production years to decline to
the point of terminal weariness and ineptitude, but the
Metropolitan Opera's `Trovatore' reached that sad state in one
evening,'' New York Times chief music critic Donal Henahan wrote
after the premiere last fall.
   Of Fabrizio Melano's production, Henahan said, ``The idea that
anyone actually directed the solo singers or the chorus strained
belief.'' Ezio Frigerio's sets, he wrote, ``consisted mostly of six
groups of marbleized pillars that moved about for reasons known
perhaps only to the designer.''
   Despite this and other pans, most upcoming performances of
``Trovatore'' have been sold out for weeks. That includes opening
night, when tickets cost up to $1,000, a price that entitles the
holder to attend a post-opera party. Total gross revenues from the
evening will come to $629,000.
   ``Gradually, we're making opening night into the gala social
event it was 25 years ago,'' explained Met spokeswoman Johanna
Fiedler. ``If you approach it that way, then it makes sense to do
something like Verdi that is popular with the kind of audience that
goes to galas.''
   A key ingredient of success for such a gala seems to be the
presence of either Pavarotti or the world's other leading operatic
tenor, Placido Domingo. One or the other has starred in five out of
the last six opening nights, and Domingo will be on hand when the
Met puts on another gala in December _ a new production of Verdi's
``Aida.''
   The three Ring Cycles that will climax the season represent the
fulfillment of a longtime dream for Levine, restoring to the
repertory for the first time since the early 1970s one of the
crowning works of opera. The production by Otto Schenk has sets and
projections by Guenther Schneider-Siemssen that combine an
old-fashioned literalism with modern technology. The cast, led by
Hildegarde Behrens as Bruennhilde, is about the best available in
today's impoverished world of Wagnerian singing.

<HEAD>Greeting Card Designer Wants To Bridge Gap Between Blind And

   With something as simple as a greeting
card, Truesillia Ruth Shank hopes to help bridge the gap between
the worlds of the sighted and the blind.
   ``It seems so unfair that a blind person should miss out on the
simple, little pleasures of life,'' said Mrs. Shank, sitting in the
living room of her modest home that doubles as the office for her
7-month-old card company, Sucurre Greetings. Sucurre is an Old
French word meaning ``to assist.''
   ``Can you imagine being 30, 40 or 50 years old and having to
wait for someone to read a stack of Christmas cards to you? Or not
being able to go into a store and pick out an anniversary card for
your wife or a birthday card for your child?'' she asked.
   The inspiration for Sucurre Greetings, which Mrs. Shank owns
with her husband, came while she was working on an advertising
project with a blind businessman.
   ``He was doing things I couldn't do even with my sight,'' she
said. ``It just didn't seem right that he needed someone to go to a
store with him just to pick out a card.''
   Because of the limited market, Braille greeting cards have not
been manufactured by established card companies, said Adam Ash,
publisher of the Gift Reporter, a trade publication for the gift
industry. Some rehabilitation agencies have been known to sell some
Braille cards at Christmas, and others translate greeting cards to
Braille when requested.
   ``At best, what you've been able to get up until now is a card
for a sighted person that's been Brailled. These cards are designed
specifically for a visually impaired person, but are still
appealing to a sighted person as well,'' said Paul Ponchillia, a
professor in the Department of Blind Rehabilitation at Western
Michigan University.
   Ponchillia, who is blind, helped the Shanks design the cards.
   The Shanks, also co-owners of a year-old advertising and
printing company, hope the pastel colors and simple but elegant
designs embossed on the front of the cards will appeal to a wide
audience. Underneath the design is a description of the object in
Braille. Inside, Braille appears under the message, typically a
short phrase with slightly raised letters.
   One lavender card has an embossed bird in flight on the cover.
Inside, the message is ``My heart's all a-flutter.''
   In addition to her basic line of 25 cards, Mrs. Shank said she
also has a line of Christmas cards.
   ``We want the person to get the full impact of the card _ a card
that everyone can enjoy,'' said Mrs. Shank, a bubbly, 32-year-old
mother of three.
   She does the embossing by hand. Her husband, Michael, art
director at a television station, does much of the designing and
printing. Most of the Brailling is done by blind volunteers.
   Distribution of the cards is mostly limited to local card shops,
but Mrs. Shank says she fills mail orders and is trying to line up
distributors for the cards in other parts of the country. The cards
sell for $2 and $2.50 locally.
   If the cards catch on, the Shanks would like to provide jobs for
blind rehabilitation and training groups.
   And it looks as if the cards may be catching on. Marshall Field
has expressed interest in buying the line for their chain of
department stores, as well as an alphabet book Mrs. Shank designed
for use by both sighted and blind children.
   ``Before getting involved in this, I never really knew a blind
person and I don't think I ever remember seeing a book that's shown
me what Braille's like,'' she said.
   ``We planned the book to get rid of the gap between sighted and
blind children. We want a sighted child to know what Braille feels
like and a blind child to be able to feel the letters that we're
seeing. Maybe that way we can get rid of some of the prejudice.''
   Prejudice is a subject Mrs. Shank knows well.
   ``Because I'm black, some people might ask why I'm not doing
something for a black cause. Well, blindness knows no color. When
people stop being prejudiced against blind people or handicapped
people, maybe they'll stop being prejudiced about black people,''
she said.

<HEAD>Frustration Over Lack of Information, Conflicting Reports On
Emperor</HEAD>

   As Emperor Hirohito lies in his sickbed, a lack of
information and conflicting reports on his health are provoking
frustration and concern.
   The Imperial Household Agency's stubborn reluctance to release
detailed information about the monarch is drawing increasingly
strong criticism.
   ``I am getting the strong impression that the emperor's real
condition may be much worse than what's been reported,'' said Naoki
Inose, author of several books on the imperial family. ``Only a
handful of doctors, nurses and servants actually get to see the
emperor other than those in the imperial family.''
   The Imperial Household Agency, which handles all matters
concerning the monarchy, has been releasing only the emperor's
temperature, blood pressure and pulse three to four times a day
along with a brief comment about his condition.
   ``What we are interested in is how the emperor is really doing,
not those medical numbers,'' said a middle-aged man who came to the
palace Sunday to sign his name in a registry of well-wishers. ``His
condition is everyone's interest.''
   A reporter for a nationally circulated newspaper said the
Imperial Household Agency had its ``own standards about the news,
which apparently differ considerably from today's ordinary
standard.'' He spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The Asahi Shimbun, Japan's second largest circulation newspaper,
said Saturday that the emperor apparently has cancer. It quoted
pathologists who examined tissue taken from the emperor's pancreas
when he underwent intestinal bypass surgery last September as
saying ``cancer cells were found in the tissue.''
   The article said pathologists at Tokyo University believe the
emperor has either pancreatic or duodenum cancer and that palace
officials decided he should not be told about it. Instead, the
article said, they announced the illness as merely an inflammation
of the pancreas.
   Shouichi Fujimori, director general of the Imperial Household
Agency, telephoned the publisher of the Asahi Shimbun, expressed
regret and asked the newspaper to exercise self-restraint.
   ``At this point where the emperor's consciousness is still clear
and he is struggling with his illness, publishing the article was
deemed totally inappropriate,'' said Kenji Maeda, an Imperial
Household Agency spokesman. ``Taking into account the emperor's
feeling, the decision to publish such an article apparently lacks
consideration.''
   But he refused to confirm or deny the report, saying only:
``Matters regarding the fact of the article and publishing such an
article are on different dimensions.''
   Deputy Managing Editor Hisao Kuwashima said the paper printed
the article after its editors decided the emperor would not be able
to read a newspaper again.
   ``Everyone is frustrated about the lack of information about his
condition,'' said Kuwashima. ``His conditions have been clearly
showing signs of pancreatic cancer since a long time ago. After he
was listed in critical condition, we decided we must run this
article.'' He said the decision also was based on the fact that
Hirohito is a public figure.
   In Japan, the decision whether to tell patients they have cancer
is left to doctors and relatives.
   When Hirohito's temperature soared Saturday afternoon, some news
services and television stations quoted unidentified government
sources as saying the emperor was in critical condition, was hooked
to a respirator and was receiving heart massages.
   Maeda hastily denied those reports and angrily said: ``Which can
you trust, speculation by unknown soruces or us?''
   The emperor has no political power but serves as a symbol of
Japan.
   ``Secrecy is an important part of the imperial family,'' said
Inose. ``If an imperial family gave away all secrets and everything
became open, they would not be able to maintain the implicit
authority they have now.
   ``For the people surrounding the imperial family, what's good
for the emperor always comes before what's good for people, and
that's been taken for granted for centuries,'' Inose said.

<TEXT>
   The Olympic stadiums where athletes
from 160 nations are competing overlook another battlefield, where
U.S. troops were locked in ferocious combat 38 years ago today.
   It is the anniversary of the Sept. 26, 1950 capture of Seoul by
U.S. and South Korean forces from communist North Korean troops _
three months after the beginning of the Korean War.
   About 4 million soldiers and civilians were killed or wounded in
the war. Seoul and almost every other city on the Korean peninsula
was badly damaged in the bitter ideological clash.
   ``Starting in Seoul I finally found out there is no glory in
war. It's cruel, miserable, dirty and nothing worth bragging
about,'' said former U.S. Marine Jack Wright in an interview.
   Seoul has been rebuilt and is now a sprawling, modern metropolis
of 10 million people. The city's skyscrapers and broad avenues are
a monument to South Korea's astonishing growth since the war.
   But the scene was very different in 1950 when the United States
and 15 other nations intervened under United Nations command to
help South Korea after it was invaded on June 25 by North Korea.
   South Korea's ill-equipped and poorly trained army was knocked
back and Seoul captured within a few days of the invasion.
   U.S. forces that rushed into Korea were pushed back with the
South Korean army until they held the southwestern tip of the
peninsula around the port of Pusan. Bloody battles raged through
August 1950 as the North Koreans attempted to break through the
Pusan perimeter.
   The war took a dramatic turn Sept. 15, 1950 when Gen. Douglas
MacArthur outflanked the North Koreans with an amphibious assault
at Inchon next to Seoul and far behind communist lines.
   MacArthur's gamble paid off and within days U.S. and some South
Korean forces reached the south bank of the Han River, including
the area around where the Olympic Park is now.
   North Korea rushed 10,000 reinforcements into Seoul and the
northern bank of the Han was bristling with tanks and artillery
that could fire straight into any assault across the river.
   The U.S. commanders on the spot wanted to advance slowly and
outflank the North Koreans. But MacArthur's headquarters in Tokyo
ordered Seoul retaken by Sept. 25, exactly three months after the
communist invasion.
   American ground commanders were forced to attack across the Han
in the face of deadly North Korean gunfire, according to historical
accounts. All of the bridges had been destroyed and the U.S. troops
went across in barges and boats.
   Joseph Saluzzi, another U.S. Marine who took part in the attack,
saw dead bodies for the first time when he arrived on the banks of
the Han.
   ``We were assembled near an area covered with litters of dead
Marines ... I was afraid to look but eventually forced myself to.
Only hours before those Marines had been joking and telling sea
stories,'' he said in an interview.
   ``I saw myself covered by one of those blankets and remember
thinking, `When it comes, let it be quick and without pain.'''
   Much of the city was burned and destroyed by massive artillery
and air attacks before the assault. Entire streets were demolished
by cannon fire and fires swept unchecked across the ancient capital.
   Once the troops got across the Han, they found the North Koreans
ready to fight for every house and street. Units battled their way
across Seoul, dislodging communist troops who would not surrender.
   ``It seemed that every building in Seoul housed an enemy sniper.
We cleaned out doorways and rooftops; we went from street to
street, house to house,'' said former Marine sergeant Lee Bergee.
   The U.S. commanders in Seoul were furious when American military
headquarters announced the city was retaken Sept. 25, according to
historical accounts, because the main attack did not begin until
early Sept. 26 and there was scattered fighting until Sept. 28.
   MacArthur and South Korean President Syngman Rhee arrived Sept.
28 for a ceremony at the National Capitol to mark the return of the
city to the South Korean government. Rhee said to the U.S.
commander, ``We love you as the savior of our race.''
   Seoul would fall again in January 1951 after China intervened in
the war in November and pushed back the U.N. forces _ and later be
recaptured by the U.N. forces and held until the war finally ended
in stalemate in 1953.

   Chinese who live abroad and wish to be buried in
the motherland can now buy a plot under a grave-marketing venture
by Canton and Hong Kong companies, the official Xinhua News Agency
reported today.
   The joint venture is offering 2,000 ``tombs'' on a hillside 12
miles from Canton, with a 50-square-foot site costing $2,050, the
agency said.
   People wishing a more prominent post-life return to the mainland
will be able to put up personal statues, and the plots come in a
variety of styles to meet the needs of people of different
religions, the report said.
   The project is a joint venture between the Guangzhou (Canton)
Funeral and Interment Service Co. and a Hong Kong interment service
company.
   Xinhua did not specify whether those buying the sites would
follow Chinese custom and be cremated before being put to rest.
   The Beijing government has tried to make cremation a universal
practice in China because of the country's severe land shortage,
but has met some resistance in rural areas where people are
traditionally buried.

<HEAD>WINSTON-SALEM, N.C.: a mistake?</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Dukakis: Well, if this is Christmas, I hope it's Christmas when
you make that decision.
   Bush: These are the, these are the, these are the _ my answer
is: do not make these unilateral cuts. And everybody now realizes
that peace through strength works. And so this is where I have a
big difference.
   Of course we're going to have to make some determination on
this, and we're going to have to make it on conventional forces.
But now, we've got a very good concept called competitive
strategies. We will do what we do best.
   It's a strategy that we've been working on for a couple of
years. It is going to take us to a much better advantage in
conventional forces. But look, let me sum it up. I want to be the
president that gets conventional forces in balance. I want to be
the one to banish chemical and biological weapons from the face of
the Earth. But you have to have a little bit of experience to know
where to start, and I think I've had that.
   Lehrer: Governor?
   Dukakis: Well, first, let me say with respect to the freeze,
that back in the spring of 1982, Mr. Bush was a lot more
sympathetic to the freeze than he seems to be today. As a matter of
fact, he said it was not and should not be a subject of partisan
demagoguery, because it was too important to the United States, or
for the world.
   I didn't hear, John, exactly where he was going to cut and what
he was going to do, but I know this. We have serious financial
problems in this country. We've piled up over $1 trillion in debt,
and the next president of the United States is going to have to
make some choices.
   Mr. Bush wants to spend billions on Star Wars. He apparently
wants to spend billions on the MX on railroad cars, a weapons
system we don't need and can't afford. I thought the administration
was opposed to the Midgetman. I thought the administration was at
the negotiating table in Geneva suggesting that we ban mobile
missile systems entirely.
   But those are the choices the next president of the United
States is going to have to make. I am for the Stealth, I am for the
D-5, I am for going ahead with the advanced cruise missile. But I
don't think we need these other systems. I don't think we need them
to remain strong. We've got to move ahead with the strategic arms
negotiation process, with the comprehensive test-ban treaty, and _
   Lehrer: Governor?
   Dukakis: _ with negotiations leading to conventional force
reduction in Europe, with deeper cuts on the Soviet side. And
Senator Bentsen and I will pursue that policy.
   Lehrer: Anne Groer, a question for the vice president.
   Groer: Well, Mr. Vice President, you said you met with Secretary
General Gorbachev, you have met with Mr. Shevardnadze. But for the
last 40 years, Americans have been taught to regard the Soviet
Union as the enemy. Yet, President Reagan has signed two arms
control treaties, and he's promised to share Star Wars technology
with the very country he once called the ``evil empire.''
   So, perhaps you could tell us this evening, should we be doing a
lot to help the economics and the social development of a country
that we have so long regarded as an adversary?
   Bush: What I think we ought to do is take a look at perestroika
and glasnost, welcome them, but keep our eyes open, be cautious,
because the Soviet change is not fully established yet.
   Yes, I think it's fine to do business with them, but I don't
want to see us exporting our highly-sensitive national security
oriented technology to the Soviet Union.
   I don't want to see us making unilateral cuts in our strategic
systems while we are negotiating with them. And so I'm encouraged
by what I see when I talk to Mr., what I hear when I talk to Mr.
Gorbachev and Mr. Shevardnadze. But can they pull it off?
   And when they have deals that are good for us as China started
to do _ the changes in China since Barbara and I lived there is
absolutely amazing in terms of incentive and partnerships and
things of this nature.
   And now the Soviet Union seems to be walking down that same
path. We should encourage that. We ought to say this is good. But
where I differ with my opponent is, I am not going to make
unilateral cuts in our strategic defense systems or support some
freeze when they have superiority.

<HEAD>No ``Smoking Gun'', But Charges Still Tarnish Aquino Government
Luster</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Corruption charges are tarnishing the
image of President Corazon Aquino's government, even though no one
has produced evidence she is sanctioning practices that led to the
downfall of her predecessor, Ferdinand Marcos.
   For months, Manila newspapers have been replete with allegations
of official corruption. They include ``disappearing'' food stocks,
rake-offs from state-run companies, bribery in the Customs Bureau
and shakedowns by crooked policemen.
   Last week, retired Maj. Gen. Cesar Tapia, who was appointed
security chief at Manila airport to clean up corruption there, quit
in disgust, saying he was powerless to root out ``institutionalized
graft.''
   Mrs. Aquino's personal integrity remains unquestioned. But
critics allege some of her relatives used their connections to
enhance their wealth in questionable business deals.
   In August, Ramon Diaz quit as chairman of the Presidential
Commission on Good Government, citing interference by relatives of
``powers that be'' in efforts to retrieve the billions of dollars
Marcos and his associates allegedly embezzled during his 20-year
administration.
   Marcos fled to Hawaii in February 1986 after he was ousted in
civilian-military uprising that placed Mrs. Aquino in power.
   Few of the recent allegations against Mrs. Aquino have been
proven, and so far no senior official has gone to jail. Many of the
charges have been leveled by self-serving opposition politicians
seeking to find an issue with which to embarrass the president.
   Last week, opposition Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile admitted he was
wrong in claiming Mrs. Aquino's brother-in-law, Paul Aquino, had
secretly assumed the chairmanship of Security Bank, which was taken
over by the government because of its links to Marcos.
   Nonetheless, political commentators believe the sheer volume of
the charges has sullied the reputation of an administration which
came to power promising to clean up government after rampant
corruption under Marcos.
   At best, the charges point to widespread inefficiency,
incompetence and mismanagement in the bureaucracy. In some cases,
government investigators acknowledged widespread irregularities in
state agencies but found no evidence of criminal wrongdoing.
   Mrs. Aquino has vowed to stamp out corruption but demands proof
before she will crack down on alleged offenders. She has said
frequently that most of the allegations have been raised by her
enemies to undermine her personally.
   But some analysts believe strong measures are necessary because
of public sensitivity after years of blatant, state-sanctioned
corruption under Marcos.
   ``The president must start giving her people some big fish to
fry,'' said the pro-government Philippine Daily Inquirer.
``Otherwise, they will set their hooks elsewhere. And the blood
will spatter not just the walls of bureaucray but on the
foundations of our new democracy as well.''
   Some analysts believe Filipinos are quick to accept corruption
allegations _ regardless of proof _ because many see examples of
petty graft every day.
   These include policemen who shake down motorists for bribes to
ignore traffic violations to bureaucrats who accept ``tips'' to
speed processing of licenses and other official documents.
   Vast timberlands are being systematically denuded of trees by
illegal logging operations. It is widely assumed such operations
continue under the protection of corrupt military officers.
   Impatience with high-level corruption has also been heightened
because millions of Filipinos must struggle daily simply to earn
enough to feed, clothe and shelter themselves and their families.
   Coupled with that is the continuing failure of the government to
improve the economic livelihood of millions, especially those who
live in the impoverished countryside.
   ``There is a strong perception here that Mrs. Aquino is
personally honest,'' said Most Rev. Leonardo Legaspi, archbishop of
Naga City, located about 190 miles southeast of Manila. ``But
people do not see goodness translated into something that is
effective.''

<HEAD>Hurricane Gilbert Smashed Resorts And Cities In Deadly Eight-Day
Rampage</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Rising out of the azure waters like the
Caribbean god of wind, Hurricane Gilbert smashed idyllic resorts
and industrial cities during an eight-day rampage across the
Caribbean and Mexico.
   Gilbert grew into a hurricane with winds of 74 mph on Sept. 10,
100 miles southwest of Puerto Rico, sending the first waves of
torrential rain and panic to impoverished towns in Haiti and the
Dominican Republic.
   By the time Gilbert lost its hurricane status over northeastern
Mexico, it had killed more than 300 people, left hundreds of
thousands homeless and caused billions of dollars damage to the
Caribbean, Central America, Mexico and the United States.
   Gilbert's trail of destruction across nine nations occurred
despite the technological advances of modern-day weather
forecasting. Airplanes flew into the eye of the hurricane several
times daily and meteorologists with computers predicted the storm's
next target.
   ``It was one of the top 10 as far as intensity, size and
destructive potential,'' said Bob Sheets, director of the National
Hurricane Center in Coral Gables, Fla.
   After leaving more than eight dead in the Dominican Republic,
Gilbert punished Jamaica's capital Kingston and the resort of
Montego Bay, then pushed northwestward past the Cayman Islands and
Cuba.
   Jamaica, which needs tourism for much of its hard currency,
sustained $8 billion in damage and at least 30 people died.
Kingston lost much of its drinking water, electricity and many
services. A half-million people, nearly one-fourth the island
population, were left homeless.
   Luckiest perhaps was the low-lying three-island British colony
called the Caymans, which suffered remarkably little damage.
   ``All 23,000 people of the islands got on their knees and said
`Thank You,''' journalist Carol Winker said.
   Gilbert moved into the Yucatan Channel between Cuba and Mexico,
gathering strength over warm waters to become a Category 5 storm or
``great hurricane'' with winds of up to 160 mph.
   The Caribbean Indians called their god of wind Huracan, and the
winds of Gilbert were terrifyingly strong, up to 218 mph at one
point as it neared Mexico.
   Rain spread more than 400 miles from north to south. Gilbert's
tail dumped up to 10 inches of rain in portions of Central America,
leaving more than 15 dead in Honduras.
   Next struck was Cancun, a 110-hotel Mexican island resort off
the Yucatan that was built in the 1970s after computer studies
showed it would be rarely hit by hurricanes.
   Said tourist Wendy Kidd of Montreal: ``The wind came in the
bedroom one way and went out the other and took everything with
it.''
   In one Cancun hotel, where 450 were packed into a banquet room,
refugees had to hold up a wall against the strong winds. There was
no water. Toilets, in some cases one to a shelter, could not be
flushed.
   ``We do not know what it is to be dirty ... sharing bathrooms
that don't work. We are not used to it,'' Mrs. Kidd said of the
American and Canadian tourists caught by the storm. ``Some people
handle it graciously and some don't.''
   Gilbert uprooted palms, Indian laurels and other trees and
snapped antenna support cables in the nearby resorts of Cozumel and
Isla Mujeres. Electrical poles fell, breaking power lines. Thatched
huts and wooden structures collapsed.
   After the storm, a 118-foot Cuban fishing boat was found tossed
up beside a beach hotel, dramatic proof of Gilbert's strength.
   Gilbert caused more than $300 million in damage to the tourist
industry of Cancun and Cozumel. In nearby Merida, it destroyed
nearly all the corn and fruit crops. At least 24 died in the area.
   Gilbert next moved into the Gulf of Mexico, threatening oil
drilling installations and populated areas from Veracruz to
Florida, before moving over land in the state of Tamaulipas, 100
miles south of Brownsville, Texas.
   Ocean waters more than three feet deep pushed several miles
inland over the barren flats. At least 11 villagers drowned along
the coast.
   But the worst lay ahead. About 160 miles northwest was Monterrey
and its 2.8 million people.
   Gilbert collided with the 14,000-foot-high mountains around
Monterrey, creating killing torrents with a load of rain that swept
away passenger buses traveling along the normally dry bed of the
Santa Catarina River.
   More than 200 died Sept. 17 in Monterrey alone, the biggest
single toll from the storm.
   In recent years the state government had used the riverbed as a
thoroughfare, for electricity towers and for miles of fields for
baseball and soccer.
   ``The water was kind of running through,'' said witness Cosme
Garibay. ``Then all of a sudden, it came, bam, all at once. I have
never seen anything like it in my life.''
   Two Americans also died from Gilbert-spawned tornadoes in Texas,
but the dying rains did some good, filling dams near the Texas
border and bringing an abrupt end to a long summer drought.

   The emergence of rival Christian and
Moslem governments threatens to plunge Lebanon once again into a
civil war fueled by outside powers that long have used the country
as a proxy battlefield.
   The crisis could formalize the de facto partition of Lebanon
into sectarian cantons carved out during the 13-year civil war,
which killed about 150,000 people.
   Syria, the major power broker in Lebanon, backs the Moslem
government and the Shiite Moslem Amal militia. Israel and Iraq
support the right-wing Christians. Libya funds the Druse militia,
which sent volunteers to fight alongside Col. Moammar Gadhafi's
army in Chad.
   Iran arms and bankrolls the Shiite fundamentalists. Saudi Arabia
helps the Sunni Moslems, but fundamentalist Sunnis also look to
Iran for support.
   The Christians and Moslems each are split by internal rivalries.
   The Maronite Catholics, the dominant Christian sect, are
patronized by the United States and France. The Greek Orthodox,
traditionally more leftist, are pro-Syrian.
   The failure of Lebanon's Parliament to elect a successor to
President Amin Gemayel, a Maronite Catholic, when his six-year term
expired Thursday spawned competing Christian and Moslem governments.
   Gemayel appointed army commander Gen. Michel Aoun as prime
minister. Syria backs Sunni Moslem Prime Minister Salim Hoss, who
took office in June 1987.
   At best, Gemayel was little more than a figurehead. He had no
control of Moslem-held areas, and even in the shrunken Christian
enclave the real power was the Lebanese forces, the Christians'
main militia.
   The 42,000-man army is fractured, with some units backing
Gemayel or allied with the Lebanese Forces. Shiite and Druse Moslem
brigades have either sat on the sidelines or actively backed Moslem
militias.
   The cease-fire in the Iran-Iraq war and the 9-month-old
Palestinian uprising in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza
Strip also have significantly affected the region.
   Particularly important is the intensification of the long feud
between Iraq and Syria, which backed Iran in the eight-year Persian
Gulf war. Syria and Iraq are ruled by rival wings of the Baath Arab
Socialist Party.
   Syria has been weakened by Iran's apparent military collapse,
and Iraq has stepped up its propaganda campaign against Damascus.
   Syria also fears it could be eclipsed as a key player in the
Arab-Israeli dispute by the support the Palestine Liberation
Organization has gained from the uprising.
   Syrian President Hafez Assad looked to Lebanon to provide him
with a success by restoring stability to the divided country
through the election of one of its allies as president.
   The Syrians, with 40,000 troops in north and east Lebanon and
Beirut's Moslem sector, consider their tiny western neighbor vital
to their security.
   The cease-fire freed the Iraqis to take revenge on Damascus for
siding with Iran by confronting the Syrians' ambitions in Lebanon
and stirring trouble for them in their own backyard.
   Iraq, influential in Lebanon until the Syrians moved in in 1976
seeking to quell the civil war, has provided weapons and ammunition
to the right-wing Lebanese Christian forces opposed to Syria.
   Arab diplomats said Baghdad, which long has had links with the
Lebanese Forces, recently shipped 50 armored personnel carriers to
the Christian militia.
   It was the Lebanese Forces' fierce opposition to Syrian-backed
candidates in the presidential election that foiled Damascus'
efforts to secure political reforms that would give Lebanon's
Moslem majority an equal share of constitutional power with the
long-dominant Christians.
   Iraq's claim that it defeated Iran, justified to some extent by
its military victories, pushed Syria to seek to impose greater
control over Lebanon and prevent any Iraqi intervention.
   The Iraqis also support Yasser Arafat's Palestine Liberation
Organization, which is feuding with Assad.
   The Syrians also have to contend with Iranian-backed Shiite
Moslem fundamentalists, who seek to create the world's second
Islamic Republic in Lebanon.
   Syria's Shiite ally, the Amal militia, sought to crush the
pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God, this year. When Hezbollah,
aided by Iranian Revolutionary Guards, came out on top, the Syrians
intervened to corral Hezbollah in its stronghold in south Beirut's
slums.
   The fundamentalists, quiet for the moment, remain a threat to
Syria's efforts to control Lebanon.

<TEXT>
   In the tense capital of Yugoslavia's
backward region of Kosovo, the majority Albanians and minority
Slavs are divided from the cradle to the grave.
   It starts in kindergarten, where parents say Albanian and Slav
children trade racial slurs.
   It ends with the death notices on trees lining main streets _
black borders for Slavs, green for Albanians.
   In good times, there was some fraternization, even
intermarriage, among the Albanians, who make up 90 percent of
Kosovo's 2 million people, and the 200,000 Slavs. But the closeness
is increasingly rare since ethnic riots in 1981 left at least nine
dead and 200 injured.
   In the past months, the tension has increased in this region the
Slavs see as their historic homeland.
   The Albanians, most of whom are Moslems, want to win a greater
voice in governing Kosovo, now administered by the republic of
Serbia. The Slavs are pushing to absorb the autonomous province
into Serbia.
   For the mostly Christian Slavs, made up of Serbs and
Montenegrins, the Albanian demand is impossible. They argue that a
separate republic would oust them from Kosovo.
   Kosovo was settled by Serbs in the 7th century and was the heart
of Serbia's medieval empire. The Turks conquered it in 1389 and
ruled until the Balkan War of 1913, when it was partitioned between
Serbia and what is now the republic of Montenegro in Yugoslavia.
Albanians, believed to be descended from the ancient Illyrians,
have been in the region since ancient times.
   Slavs say the Albanians would precipitate the breakup of this
communist Balkan country by seceding and uniting with Albania, the
neighboring communist country.
   Thousands of Serbs and Montenegrins have left Kosovo because of
arson and other attacks they blame on the Albanians, who are rarely
given a chance to publicly respond to what appear to be grossly
distorted accounts.
   The animosity, exacerbated by emotional Slav rallies protesting
alleged Albanian attacks, is now so high that many residents
believe a military crackdown will come within months, or even
weeks. Police equipped with armored personnel carriers have been
sent to the province by the federal government in Belgrade.
   The Slavs say Kosovo's Albanians, who have the highest birthrate
in Europe, are making a conscious effort to outbreed them. They
claim the Albanians are chasing them out of Kosovo by attacking
their women and children and offering irresistibly high amounts of
money for their properties.
   ``You could buy in New York for what they pay here,'' said a
Western resident of Pristina, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
He cited prices of $222,000 for a house in the hilly city.
   The Slavs have found a champion for their cause in Slobodan
Milosevic, the leader of Serbia's Communist Party, who advocates
more direct Serbian control over Kosovo and the autonomous province
of Vojvodina, near the Hungarian border. Both areas control their
own judiciary, police and other insitutions.
   The position of the Serbian Communist Party has thrown
Yugoslavia into its most explosive political crisis of the postwar
era.
   Milosevic's views have drawn hundreds of emotional crowds to
rallies where they vent their frustrations with Yugoslavia's
economic crisis by chanting for arms and vowing to keep Kosovo
Slavic.
   ``We are shaking the country,'' said Miroslav Solevic, a
Pristina Serb who heads a committee to organize the rallies.
   But leaders of Yugoslavia's other republics say Milosevic's
emotional tactics could lead to civil war.
   The rallies ``have a negative effect on the situation in
Kosovo,'' said Albanian Hashim Rexhepi, a member of Kosovo's
Communist leadership.
   ``It's very bad for us now,'' said student Nazim Rexhepi, an
ethnic Albanian with no known family ties to the politician.
``Nobody asks us anything. If we even organized a similar rally (to
those held by the Serbs), we would all be proclaimed Albanian
separatists and sentenced.''
   The ethnic crisis has been worsened by Kosovo's economic
backwardness.
   Seventy percent of the population is under 30, and 135,000
people are jobless. Listless, bored young men gather by the
hundreds on Pristina's refuse-strewn streets.
   Those with jobs earn as little as $75 a month, less than half
the national average. A middle-class family of four is lucky to
live in a one-bedroom apartment in a building with broken light
bulbs and windows and an entrance that reeks of garbage.
   Money from the richer republics has produced some incongruously
luxurious buildings, such as the university library.
   ``We're the only country in the world that has borrowed money to
finance its own destruction,'' said a Serbian journalist in Kosovo
who spoke on condition of anonymity. He was referring to
Yugoslavia's $21 billion debt and child support paid to Albanians
for each of their many children.
   In the village of Prekale, armed Serbian vigilantes protect
children from harassment by Albanian villagers and police patrol
the area every six hours.
   ``The ordinary people _ it's not their fault. It's all the big
heads that do this,'' says Serb villager Slobodan Maksimovic.
   The villagers are ready to flee if ethnic violence erupts, but
Serbian nationalists anxious to stem emigration from Kosovo have
persuaded many people to stay.
   ``I had to come back from (working in) Switzerland to protect my
family,'' said Maksimovic. ``I have to go with my kids every day to
school, wait until they finish and then come back with them. We
feel as if we are in a zoo, encircled by Albanians and guarded by
police.''

<TEXT>
   Prisoners briefly seized control of a
high-security section of the Idaho State Penitentiary on Sunday,
and guards later found an inmate dead in his cell, authorities said.
   The 3{-hour rampage began when two unarmed guards ran into
resistance trying to confiscate homemade liquor from inmates, said
Tim McNeese, executive assistant to state Department of Corrections
director Al Murphy.
   The prisoners broke glass and burned mattresses and papers
before surrendering.
   The death was being investigated as an apparent homicide, said
McNeese. He said the victim's name was being withheld pending
notification of relatives. He refused to release details of how the
man was killed.
   After SWAT teams entered the building and inmates ended their
disturbance without force, officers found the body during an
inspection, McNeese said at a news conference.
   ``It appears there was significant damage,'' said McNeese. It
was mainly glass damage. ``There isn't that much in there to
burn,'' he said.
   Someone broke through a cinderblock cell wall to get at the
inmate, he said. He said there was no immediate information whether
the disturbance was staged to aid the slaying.
   The cellblock involved normally has a population of 120. McNeese
said he had no immediate indication how many inmates took part in
the disturbance and destruction, but many remained in their cells.

``drug-running dictator. We've been dealing with him, he's been

``Is this the time to unleash our one-liners?'' Bush said in

<TEXT>
   I'm not going to do that because I think the jury is still out
on the Soviet experiment. And the interesting place, one of the
things that fascinates me about this perestroika and glasnost is
what's going to happen in Eastern Europe. You see the turmoil in
Poland today. And I think we have enormous opportunity for trade.
   I don't want to go back to the Carter grain embargo on the
Soviets. We are once again reliable suppliers and I would never use
food as a political tool like our predecessors did. But this is an
exciting time. But all I'm suggesting is, let's not be naive in
dealing with the Soviets and make a lot of unilateral cuts hoping
against hope that they will match our bid. Look at the INF treaty.
And if we haven't learned from the negotiating history on that
we'll never learn. The freeze people were wrong. The Reagan
administration was right. Excuse me.
   Lehrer: Governor Dukakis.
   Dukakis: That was a very different George Bush who was talking
much more sympathetically about the freeze in the spring of 1982
than he is today, and you were right then George when you said that
it was no time for partisan demagoguery. Nobody is suggesting that
we unilaterally disarm or somehow reduce our strength. Of course
not.
   What we're talking about is a combination of a strong and
effective and credible nuclear deterrent, strong, well-equipped,
well-trained, well-maintained conventional forces, and at the same
time, a willingness to move forward steadily, thoughtfully,
cautiously.
   We have serious differences with the Soviet Union. We have very
fundamental differences about human rights, democracy, and in our
basic system, our basic view of human beings and of what life is
all about.
   But there are opportunities there now. Senator Bentsen and I
have a plan for the 1990s and beyond; Mr. Bush and Mr. Quayle do
not.
   And we want to pursue that plan in a way which will bring down
the level of nuclear armament, will build a more stable and more
peaceful world, and we can do so while making choices here at home.
   Let's not forget that our national security and our economic
security go hand in hand. We cannot be strong militarily when we're
teeter-tottering on top of a mountain of debt which has been
created in the past eight years. That's why we need a Democratic
administration in Washington in 1989.
   Lehrer: Anne Groer, a question for the governor.
   Groer: Yes. Governor Dukakis, speaking of seeming changes of
position, you have gone from calling the Strategic Defense
Initiative, or Star Wars, ``a fantasy and a fraud'' to saying
recently you would continue SDI research, and might even deploy the
system if Congress supported such a move. Why the change of heart?
   Dukakis: No, there's been no change of heart. I've said from the
beginning that we ought to continue research into the strategic
system at about the level it was at in 1983. That's about a billion
dollars a year.
   But I don't know of any reputable scientists who believe that
this system, at least as originally conceived, could possibly work,
this notion of some kind of an Astrodome over ourselves that could
protect us from enemy attack, makes real sense. And as a matter of
fact, the system that the administration's now talking about is
very different from the one that was originally proposed in 1983.
So, I am for continued research.
   But I also want strong conventional forces. Now, the other day
Mr. Bush said, ``Well, if we continued with Star Wars, we'd have to
cut some place.'' He hasn't told us where. We know where they're
cutting. We know where you're cutting right now. You're cutting
into the fiber and muscle of our conventional forces. You're
cutting back on maintenance and equipment.
   There was an Air Force general, not too long ago, in Europe, who
said that pretty soon we'd have airplanes without engines, tank
commanders who can't drive their tanks more than three-quarters of
a mile because they don't have enough fuel, Coast Guard cutters
tied up at the dock this summer, not patrolling _ they're supposed
to be our first line of defense against drugs and the war against
drugs _ because they don't have enough fuel.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ The rebellion in the rank and file
of the 7,000-man army has dramatically reformed the high command,
replacing corrupt and repressive remnants of the Duvalier
dictatorship with competent professionals.
   ``There is a democratic revolution going on in the army. No
decision is made without the enlisted men,'' said Serge Gilles,
co-leader of the Patriotic Unity Bloc, a coalition of three
democratic political parties.
   The army purge began Sept. 17, when enlisted men and their
sergeants ousted Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy, the head of government.
They replaced him with Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril, who as a brigadier
general had been the army's top administrative officer.
   The soldiers sacked dozens of commanders at units across the
country. Avril endorsed their action and said 29 superior officers
were retired.
   The sergeants who engineered the coup share daily
decision-making with Avril, but they have promised to respect the
chain of command under their newly appointed leaders, mostly
younger junior officers.
   ``We are thankful to these nation-builders,'' Louis Roy,
co-writer of the 1987 Constitution, said of the soldiers. ``(Avril)
must not forget that they are watching him and will punish any
deviation.''
   Soldiers speaking on radio stations identify themselves with
Haiti's oppressed poor and speak of human rights, democracy, free
elections and re-establishing the constitution abolished by Namphy.
   ``The army is the people and the people are the army,'' was the
rebellion's slogan.
   An important motive of the mutiny was the desire to improve
living and working conditions. Most soldiers earn less than $200 a
month and live with their families in the city's wretched slums.
Now they are demanding higher pay, subsidized housing, and medical
and pension benefits.
   Corrupt officers such as Col. Gregoir Figaro, police chief of
the capital, Port-au-Prince, have been replaced by young
professional officers such as the new police commander, Lt. Col.
Georges Valcin, who was trained in a French police academy.
   A survivor of the upheaval is Col. Jean-Claude Paul, commander
of the feared 700-man Dessalines Barracks, the only major unit in
which soldiers did not mutiny.
   A Western diplomat said privately that Paul, who was indicted in
Miami on charges of drug-running, is popular because he is not
arrogant, treats his troops well, and ``spreads money around to his
men.''
   The soldiers said they chose Avril as president because he is
honest and treats them with respect.
   During the 29-year family dynasty founded by Francois ``Papa
Doc'' Duvalier and inherited by his son, Jean-Claude, the army was
shunted aside, stripped of its traditional power and humiliated by
the arrogant Tonton Macoutes, the Duvalier private militia.
   When Jean-Claude Duvalier was ousted and fled to France on Feb.
7, 1986, the Macoutes were officially disbanded. The repressive
army high command of Duvalier appointees remained largely intact,
taking over the Macoutes' lucrative contraband and drug-smuggling
activities and siphoning off public funds.
   Francois Duvalier, a quiet country doctor the army expected to
manipulate, rose to power in 1957 in military-rigged elections.
Instead, he used the Tonton Macoutes to terrorize the population
into submission and loosen the army's grip on power.
   In the early 1960s, Duvalier closed the military academy and
exiled, retired or shot scores of army officers considered a threat
to his power.
   Professional officers either opted to collaborate with the
dictator or were forced into submission. A low-ranking, illiterate
Macoute wielded more power than an army officer.
   When Jean-Claude Duvalier took over as president-for-life upon
his father's death in 1971, he reopened the military academy. The
graduates soon discovered they had no chance of promotion in an
officer corps clogged by Duvalierists, who remained in power even
after the dictator's departure.
   ``If an army is a disciplined group of men in arms, there is no
Haitian army,'' a major said in an interview shortly before
Namphy's ouster. ``What we have are more or less discordant centers
of authority ... infiltrated by criminal elements,'' he said.
   Rank-and-file soldiers, already envious of officers' salaries of
up to $3,500 a month for a general, were provoked into rebellion
when thugs, many of them former Macoutes, attacked worshipers at a
Sunday morning Mass in a Roman Catholic Church on June 11, killing
13 and wounding 77.
   Presidential Guard Sgt. Joseph Heubreux, the 27-year-old leader
of the coup, said the enlisted men were disgusted by the massacre
and other acts of violence under Namphy and felt humiliated when
the outraged public accused them of siding with the killers.
   Heubreux, speaking in full battle gear on national television
the night of the coup, said the soldiers' goal was ``to raise the
prestige of the Haitian people, degraded by so many acts which have
revolted our conscience.''

<HEAD>Democrats Confident They Can Move Minimum Wage Hike to Vote</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: Top prospects uncertain</NOTE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Only one vote _ and possibly a few federal
judgeships _ are stopping Senate Democrats from shutting off a
Republican filibuster and passing the first increase in the $3.35
hourly minimum wage since 1981.
   But having lost two cloture votes last week in trying to break
the logjam, Democratic leaders were unwilling to schedule a third
attempt until after Sunday night's debate between presidential
candidates George Bush and Michael Dukakis.
   Republican leaders following a White House-directed legislative
strategy are insisting on paring down by about half the $1.20
increase in the minimum wage that Democrats would like to implement
over a three-year period.
   The Republicans also want to couple the increase to a new
90-day, 85 percent subminimum wage for newly hired workers, as long
as no one would fall below the current $3.35 floor.
   The minimum wage bill is one of several facing an impatient
Congress eager to adjourn to hit the fall campaign trail.
   Senate Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., has warned
senators to be prepared for Saturday sessions if the 100th Congress
is to end by Oct. 16 _ a date two weeks beyond the original target
date for finishing business.
   Behind the scenes, GOP leaders are holding the minimum wage bill
hostage while trying to win a commitment from Democratic leaders to
act before Congress adjourns on an unspecified number of the 29
federal judicial nominations that President Reagan has sent to
Capitol Hill.
   Recalling that 17 of President Carter's judicial nominations
disappeared in the interim between the November election in 1980
and Reagan's taking office the following January, Republicans are
determined that the same will not happen to them should Dukakis win.
   Senate GOP Whip Alan Simpson of Wyoming made it clear that any
``deal'' for allowing Democrats to move the minimum wage bill and
possibly act on other social and environmental legislation does not
have to involve all 29 of Reagan's nominees to the bench.
   ``A shake of the hand will do it _ we do not need to have it in
writing _ that these certain judges will be approved,'' Simpson
said. ``That is really the issue before us and it really does not
have anything to do with the minimum wage.''
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., the primary sponsor of the
minimum wage increase, expressed confidence in picking up the 60th
vote needed to end the filibuster, regardless of whether a deal is
struck on the judicial nominations.
   Last Friday, eight Republicans _ five more than on Thursday _
joined 48 Democrats in a 56-35 vote seeking to break the
filibuster. ``I believe we're on the edge of having a successful
resolution,'' Kennedy said.
   GOP leaders, however, were confident that no more members in
their party would break ranks and suggested that a few might even
switch back.
   Democratic Sens. Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, Bill Bradley of New
Jersey and Lawton Chiles of Florida all were absent during Friday's
vote. Kennedy believes all three will support him.
   Assuming none of the Republicans switch, that means he has to
get one vote from among Democratic Sens. David Boren of Oklahoma,
Richard Shelby of Alabama and James Exon of Nebraska.
   Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., said some senators on his side
of the aisle were ``confused'' on Friday's vote. ``By Monday,
they'll realize what's at stake,'' he said.
   Proposals to overhaul the welfare system and to grant parents
unpaid leave from work to care for newborn or sick children still
are the subject of late-session maneuvering.
   Several appropriations bills, including one $300 billion measure
for the Defense Department that Reagan has vetoed once already,
have been approved in one form or another but differences remain
between House and Senate versions.
   Also still pending is the biggest environmental bill of the last
two years _ a revision of the Clean Air Act with tighter
prohibitions on urban air pollution and acid rain.
   Closed-door negotiations over the clean air legislation have
been taking place for several weeks on both sides of the Capitol,
but lawmakers remain divided on whether Congress can agree on the
complicated package in the remaining three weeks.
   Slated for House action this week is a bill authorizing 20 new
water projects around the country by the Army Corps of Engineers.
   Even if the legislation is approved, the projects also require
the passage of separate appropriations bills before construction on
them can begin. So far this year, Congress has declined to approve
funds for any new projects because of the budget deficit.

   You have to make choices.
   We're not making those choices, and to spend billions and
billions of dollars as Mr. Bush apparently wants to _ although he
himself has been all over the lot on this issue lately _ on ``Star
Wars,'' in my judgment, makes no sense at all.
   We need a strong, credible, effective nuclear deterrent. We have
13,000 strategic nuclear warheads right now.
   On land, on sea and in the air, enough to blow up the Soviet
Union 40 times over. They have about 12,000.
   So, we've got to move forward with those negotiations, get the
level of strategic weapons down, but to continue to commit billions
to this system makes no sense at all and I think Mr. Bush has been
reconsidering his position over the course of the past few weeks _
at least that's what I read. Maybe, he'll tell us where he stands
on it tonight.
   Q. Mr. Vice President.
   Bush: I'm not reconsidering my position.
   Two questions _ how do you deter nuclear attack without
modernizing our nuclear forces, when the Soviets are modernizing?
   And, how come you spend _ willing to spend a dime on something
that you consider a fantasy, and a fraud?
   Those are two, hypo-rhetorical questions. He is the man on
conventional forces that wants to eliminate two carrier
battlegroups.
   The armed forces _ the conventional forces of the United States
have never been more ready.
   Every single one of the Joint Chiefs will testify to the fact
that readiness is at an historic high.
   And, secondly, in terms of the cutting of the Coast Guard, it
was the Congress _ the Democratic-controlled Congress _ so please
help us with that, who cut $70 million from the Coast Guard out of
the interdiction effort on narcotics.
   He's got to get this thing more clear. Why do you spend a
billion dollars on something you think is a fantasy and a fraud?
   I will fully research it, go forward as fast as we can. We've
sent up the levels of funding, and when it is deployable, I will
deploy it. That's my position on SDI, and it's never waivered a bit.
   Lehrer: Peter Jennings, a question for Governor Dukakis.
   Jennings: Well, governor, and Vice President Bush, you both
talked tonight about hard choices. Let me try to give you one.
Somewhere in the Middle East tonight, nine Americans are being held
hostage. If you are commander in chief, and Americans are held
hostage, what will be more important to you _ their individual
fate, their individual fate, or the commitment that the United
States government must never negotiate with terrorists. And, if any
Americans are held hostage, and you become president, to what
lengths would you go to rescue them?
   Dukakis: Peter, it's one of the most agonizing decisions a
president has to make.
   These are American citizens. We care deeply about them. Their
families care deeply about them, want them back, and understandably
so, and we want to do everything we can to bring them back.
   But, if there's one thing we also understand it is that you
cannot make concessions to terrorists, ever _ ever. Because if you
do, it's an open invitation to other terrorists to take hostages
and to blackmail us. And that's the tragedy of the Iran-Contra
scandal.

<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   In lines they've been polishing all campaign
long, George Bush and Michael Dukakis traded familiar accusations
in a leadoff debate with no clear winner _ a standoff that may well
benefit the Democratic challenger.
   The confrontation at Wake Forest University put Dukakis on an
even platform with the better-known Republican nominee, two men
displaying their presidential wares. Absent a telling blow from one
debater or the other, that usually works to the advantage of the
outsider, in this case the Massachusetts governor.
   But a breakthrough on the issues will have to await their next
confrontation, three weeks away.
   In 90 minutes of Sunday night campaign debate, Bush and Dukakis
summarized what they have been saying to voters every day for
months.
   There were no surprises, no secret weapons. Neither man landed a
major punch. The campus chapel, converted to a television
auditorium for the night, was just another campaign stop _ with a
vastly larger audience.
   Based on the presidential campaign debates that have gone
before, the forum itself is likely to be more of a plus for the
Dukakis campaign than for Bush, less for what they did in debate
than for where they started.
   It usually has worked that way for the challenger, for Kennedy
versus Nixon, Carter versus Ford, Reagan versus Carter, even, in
their first debate, for Democrat Walter Mondale against President
Reagan. Reagan, heavily favored for re-election, reversed that when
they met a second time.
   The vice president is an administration incumbent with an
administration record to defend. He did so at one point by saying
he would take all the blame for the Iran-Contra affair and for any
mistakes in dealing with Panama if he could have only half the
credit for the things President Reagan has accomplished in the
cause of world peace.
   Because the Washington outsider is the likely beneficiary, the
Bush campaign wanted fewer debates than Dukakis sought, and wanted
them early in the fall, not close to the Nov. 8 election. They got
their way; the final Bush-Dukakis debate will be in Los Angeles on
Oct. 13 or 14.
   There were no major gaffes in the opening debate, nothing to
compare with Gerald R. Ford's 1976 insistence that the Soviet Union
does not dominate Eastern Europe.
   Bush did misspeak in a discussion of weapons systems, but sought
to deflect the slip-up with a joke on himself. Dukakis shunned the
scholarly, defensive stance that once gave him problems, and
concentrated on offense.
   For all that, and despite the questions posed by debate
panelists about specific issues, the basic fare for each candidate
was his attack on the other one. That's been a constant complaint
about the presidential campaign fare of 1988, and the first debate
did little to change it.
   Each candidate questioned the other's judgment.
   The course of the forum was signaled when Dukakis was asked to
name three specific federal programs he would cut in order to
reduce the budget deficit. He mentioned one, sort of. ``I've
suggested there are certain weapons systems which we don't need and
can't afford,'' he said. Then he talked about economic growth,
lower interest rates and better tax enforcement.
   Then he went on offense, saying that Bush's budget claims would
turn him into the Joe Isuzu of American politics.
   ``Is now the time to unleash our one-liners?'' Bush replied.
``That answer was about as clear as Boston Harbor.''
   But Bush's budget formulation was hardly less murky. He talked
about his ``flexible freeze'' on spending, blamed the Democratic
Congress for current problems, claimed a cut in the capital gains
tax will generate more revenues instead of less, and promised, ``I
will not raise taxes.''
   He said Dukakis had raised taxes five times, and didn't even
have a defense budget to worry about in Massachusetts.
   When Bush got weapons systems confused in one answer, he joked
that it was like his problem getting dates correct, as when he
misdated Pearl Harbor Day.
   ``Wouldn't it be nice to be perfect, to be the ice man, so you
never make a mistake?''
   Later, he made another one, in defending Sen. Dan Quayle, his
vice presidential nominee. Bush said there are three men on the
ticket who are knowledgeable in defense. He corrected that to say
three men in the campaign. He obviously meant to include Sen. Lloyd
Bentsen, the Democratic vice presidential nominee, and to exclude
Dukakis. It didn't work.
   ``Did I sense a desire that maybe Lloyd Bentsen ought to be your
running mate?'' Dukakis shot back.

<HEAD>Most Farmland Sales Still Between Farmers, Survey Shows</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When farmers sell out, the odds favor their
land being bought by other farmers in the neighborhood, but an
Agriculture Department analyst says the outcome also depends on the
region of the country.
   According to a USDA survey, a total of 7,150 transactions
involving about 2.3 million acres were reported between Sept. 1,
1987, and Feb. 1, 1988.
   Overall, there was no dramatic shift in the use or ownership of
U.S. farmland, says Roger Hexem of the department's Economic
Research Service. Around 2 percent to 4 percent of all agricultural
land changes hands each year, and the majority of buyers are farm
operators.
   The 1988 survey showed that 64 percent of the farmland was
bought by farmers who already owned and operated land as farm
units. That compared with 60 percent in the 1987 survey and 65
percent in 1986.
   Hexem, reporting in the October issue of Farmline magazine, said
25 percent of the land was bought by non-farmers, 10 percent by
tenants and 1 percent by retired farmers.
   ``The proportion of acres bought for non-agricultural uses
varies among regions,'' the report said. ``Non-farm activity is
often highest in the Northeast, Appalachia and Southeast, where
non-farm buyers and non-agricultural uses figure more prominently.''
   On average, sales in these regions involve considerably smaller
land parcels. Nationally, farmland sales averaged 317 acres,
according to this year's survey, while in the Northeast the average
was 141 acres; Appalachia, 115; and Southeast, 194.
   Also, the report said, the share of land bought by farm owners
and operators varied by region, compared with the 64 percent
national average. In the Pacific region, for example, about 80
percent of the land sales went to other farmers, while in the
Northeast only 41 percent was bought by farmers.
   ``Producers have been relatively less active in the Northeast
and Southeast markets for most of the 1980s,'' the report said.
``For example, the amount of acreage reportedly bought by
owner-operators in the Northeast fell from 59 percent in 1983 to 41
percent in 1988.
   ``In the Southeast, it dropped from 71 percent in 1983 to 42
percent. At the same time, acreage bought by non-farmers in the
Southeast rose from 23 percent in 1983 to 55 percent this year.''
   Hexem said part of this trend results from greater demand for
land along the East Coast from non-agricultural sources. Urban
sprawl around such cities as New York, Boston, Pittsburgh,
Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington, D.C., Atlanta and Miami has
been a major factor.
   The demand includes more land for homes, shopping centers,
office complexes, industrial centers, roads and airports. Hexem
said additional demand comes from second homes, retirement homes
and recreational uses.
   Even so, Hexem said, most of the land that has changed hands is
expected to continue in agricultural production for the foreseeable
future.
   According to the survey, about 91 percent of the recently sold
farmland nationwide will probably remain in agriculture for the
next five years. An additional 1 percent is expected to go into
forestry and about 8 percent into other uses, including housing,
recreation and commercial and industrial sites.
   Land most likely to stay in farming five year after being sold
is in the Lake states, Corn Belt, Northern Plains, Mountain and
Pacific regions, Hexem said. One reason is that farming
predominates in these areas, with less competition from other land
uses.
   Another development has been an increase in the acres per parcel
of land sold and a decrease in the average price per acre of the
reported sales. In 1988, sales averaged 317 acres nationwide, up
from 236 acres in 1987. Prices dropped to $566 per acre from $607
in 1987.
   Hexem said some of this can be attributed to several large
tracts of land, likely rangeland, sold at relatively low prices in
the Mountain and Southern Plains regions. While accounting for only
13 percent of the land transactions, the two regions were
responsible for 45 percent of the acreage that changed hands, he
said.
   The survey showed that buyers have been acquiring land with less
credit, many using cash instead. In 1988, the report said, 70
percent of the sales were financed, down from 73 percent last year
and 90 percent in the late 1970s and early 1980s.
   Hexem said the 70 percent ``is comparable to financing levels of
the early 1960s.''
   Credit-financed sales remained most popular in the Northeast,
Lake states and Mountain regions, while cash sales increased in the
Corn Belt, Appalachia and the Southeast.

<HEAD>WINSTON-SALEM, N.C.: Iran-Contra scandal.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   As a matter of fact, Mr. Bush was the chairman of a task force
on international terrorism, which issued a report shortly before
that decision was made, and said _ and rightly so _ that we never,
ever can make concessions to terrorists and hostage takers.
   And yet, after sitting through meeting after meeting, he
endorsed that decision, endorsed the sale of arms to the ayatollah
in exchange for hostages, one of the most tragic, one of the most
mistaken foreign policy decisions we've ever made in this country,
and I dare say, encouraged others to take hostages, as we now know.
   So, there can be no concessions under any circumstances, because
if we do, it's an open invitation to others to do that same.
   We've got to be tough on international terrorism. We've got to
treat it as international crime. We've got to attack it at all
points.
   We've got to use undercover operations. We have to be prepared
to use military force against terrorist base camps. We have to work
closely with our allies to make sure that they're working with us
and we with them.
   And we can give no quarter when it comes to breaking the back of
international terrorism.
   Yes, we should make every effort to try help those hostages come
home, but it can never be because we make concessions. That was a
tragic mistake that we made _ mistake that Mr. Bush made, and
others made, and it should never, ever be made again.
   Q. Mr. Vice President?
   Bush: I wrote the anti-terrorist report for this government. It
is the best anti-terrorist report written.
   Yes, we shouldn't trade arms for hostages, but we made vast
improvements in our anti-terrorism.
   Now, it's fine to say that sometimes you have to hit base camps
but, when the president saw the state-sponsored fingerprints of
Moammar Gadhafi on the loss of American life, he hit Libya.
   And my opponent was unwilling to support that action. And since
that action _
   Dukakis: That's not true. That's not true.
   Bush: _ terrorist action against United States citizens have
gone down.
   And I have long ago said I supported the president on this other
matter. And I've said mistakes were made _ clearly, nobody's going
to think the president started out thinking he was going to trade
arms for hostages.
   That is a very serious charge against the president. And that
has been thoroughly looked into. But, the point is, sometimes the
action has to be taken by the federal government.
   And, when we took action, it had a favorable response.
   Lehrer: A question for the vice president, Peter.
   Jennings: It seems, perhaps, a good subject, Mr. Vice President,
on which to make the point that you've campaigned vigorously as
part of a leadership team. But, so far, you won't tell the American
people in considerable measure what advice you gave the president
on issues, including the sale of arms to Iran.
   And what should have been done about the hostages. To the best
of my knowledge, there's no constitutional requirement which
prevents you from doing so.
   Jimmy Carter urged his vice president, Walter Mondale, to tell
the American people. Would you now ask President Reagan for
permission to tell the American people what advice you did give
him? And, if you don't, how do we judge your judgment in the Oval
Office in the last eight years?
   Bush: You judge by the whole record. You judge by the entire
record. Are we closer to peace? Are we doing better in
anti-terrorism? Should we have listened to my opponent who wanted
to send the U.N. into the Persian Gulf? Or, in spite of the
mistakes of the past, are we doing better there?
   How is our credibility with the GCC countries on the western
side of the gulf? Is Iran talking to Iraq about peace?
   You judge on the record. Are the Soviets coming out of
Afghanistan? How does it look in a program he called phony, or some
one of these marvelous Boston adjectives up there, about Angola?
   Now, we have a chance, now _ several Bostonians don't like it
but the rest of the country will understand _ now, we have a
chance. Now, we have a chance. Now, we have a chance. And, so, I
think that I'd leave it right there and say that you judge on the
whole record.

   Thomas Jefferson High School for Science
and Technology has yet to graduate its first class but already more
than a sixth of its 340 seniors have been named National Merit
Scholarship semifinalists.
   And a 16-year-old junior led a four-student team to victory over
1,500 schools in a rigorous nationwide competition for a $1 million
supercomputer last month.
   In other respects, the kids in the school in Annandale, a suburb
of Washington, D.C., are normal teen-agers. They go out for
football, plaster their classroom walls with posters and art,
produce a school newspaper, audition for the drama club play.
   But their academic record is something else. The seniors'
performance in the Merit Scholarship competition placed the high
school fifth among the 19,000 schools that participated.
   ``Isn't it fabulous?'' says Fairfax County School Superintendent
Robert Spillane. ``This is the first full year of a four-year
school, and it has already made its mark.''
   A passion for learning among the student body and unusual
cooperation make Thomas Jefferson a trend-setter among high schools
in this era of burgeoning technology.
   ``What characterizes the environment in this building is
extraordinary intellectual stimulation _ a sense of enjoyment of
learning and a commitment to excellence,'' said Mary Harley Kruter,
admissions and staff development director. ``It's really
phenomenal.''
   The school won the supercomputer thanks to a project by Manish
Tuteja, 16, called ``Complex Plane Analysis of the Newton Raphson
Method on High Order Polynomials.'' The project focused on a method
for deriving formulas in calculus, involving work being done in
relatively new study of chaos, according to principal Geoffrey
Jones.
   ``The work he did was quite significant and likely will lead to
publication,'' Jones said.
   Jefferson opened in fall 1985 in an area that's growing faster
than any in the country in the high-tech field. Sixteen-hundred
teen-agers are bused in daily from all over northern Virginia.
   Only one in three eighth-grade students who hope to attend
Jefferson meet its rigorous standards for admission. Aspirants must
take a standardized test and write an essay. School officials also
take into account their previous school experiences, including
grades, activities, and ability and interest in science and
mathematics.
   Students pursue parallel programs in science and technology. The
science curriculum follows the standard college preparatory course,
with classes in earth science, biology, calculus and the other
usual requirements.
   The technology portion focuses on learning by doing in the real
world.
   ``We have a strong tie with business and industry that leads us
to a different model of education, focusing on the technology as
it's being used and developed in the field,'' Jones said. ``The
ideal program for us is to have student and faculty who are
actually working with people in the industry on the same
technologies and learning the science and math as part of the
experience.''
   Corporations have donated computer labs and other equipment to
the young school, and professionals visit regularly to teach and
work with students.
   ``We actually send students out to work in the field,'' said
Jones, pointing out the example of Honeywell, where students work
part-time and during the summer.
   Other companies that support Jefferson include Atlantic
Research, Virginia Power, AT&T, Sony, Hazelton Laboratories, BDM,
Martin Marietta, Hewlitt Packard, Computer Sciences Corp., IBM,
Dynalectron and TRW.
   The high-tech focus at the school is balanced by a strong
humanities program and a sports program.
   Jones plays down the Merit Scholarship aspect of his school's
success, saying the standardized tests are ``not a good measure of
school success.'' His challenge is finding innovative ways to
measure how well Jefferson fulfills its mandate as one of the first
schools in the nation to focus intensively on science and
technology.
   ``One of our real challenges or goals is to develop a model for
scientific and technological education, and to see if that model is
different from what has traditionally happened in the schools,''
said Jones.

   And let me say this, all he can talk about, he goes around
ranting about Noriega.
   Now, I've told you what the intelligence briefing he received
said about that.
   He can talk about Iran-Contra, and also _ I'll make a deal with
you. I will take all the blame for those two incidents if you give
me half the credit for all of the good things that have happened in
world peace since Ronald Reagan and I took over from the Carter
administration.
   I still, I still have a, I still have a couple of minutes left.
And there is a different principle here on _
   Lehrer: Sorry, sorry, Mr. Vice President.
   Bush: It's only on yellow out here, wait a minute.
   Lehrer: I'm sorry. I'm wrong. Go ahead. My apologies.
   Bush: Jim.
   Lehrer: You said, nobody's perfect.
   Bush: I said, I wasn't perfect, but I thought you were. Where
was I?
   Lehrer: My apology.
   Dukakis: The 25th of December, Mr. Vice President.
   Bush: I agree. I agree. Where was I?
   Lehrer: Governor.
   Dukakis: He can have another 10 seconds if he wants to.
   Lehrer: Yes, sir. Go ahead.
   Bush: Go ahead.
   Lehrer: All right. All right. Governor, you have a minute to
respond.
   Dukakis: Well, the matter of judgment is very important, and I
think it's important to understand what happened here.
   A report on international terrorism chaired by the vice
president was released, and made some very specific recommendations
about how to deal with terrorism. They were ignored.
   The vice president ignored them. It says mistakes were made _
very serious mistakes in judgment were made.
   He says, ``Well, let's concede that the administration has been
doing business with Noriega,'' who's made him a part of our foreign
policy and has been funneling aid to the Contras through convicted
drug dealers.
   I think those are very, very serious questions of judgment,
which those of you who are watching us here tonight have a right to
judge and review.
   We're not going to make those kinds of mistakes. You cannot make
concessions to terrorists. If you do, you invite the taking of more
hostages. That's a basic principle. It was ignored in that case,
and it was a very, very serious mistake in judgment.
   Lehrer: Go to a question from John Mashek. It goes to the vice
president.
   Mashek: Mr. Vice President, Democrats, and even some
Republicans, are still expressing reservations about the
qualifications and credentials of Sen. Dan Quayle of Indiana, your
chosen running mate, to be a heartbeat away from the presidency.
What do you see in him that others do not?
   Bush: I see a young man that was elected to the Senate twice, to
the House of Representatives twice.
   I see a man who is young and I'm putting my confidence in a
whole generation of people that are in their thirties and in their
forties.
   I see a man that took the leadership in the Job Training
Partnership Act, and that retrains people in this highly
competitive changing society we're in so if a person loses his job,
he is retrained for a benefit, for a work that will be productive
and he won't have to go on one of these many programs that the
liberals keep talking about.
   I see a young man who is knowledgeable in defense. And there are
three people on our ticket that are knowledgable in the whole, in
the race, knowledgable in defense, and Dan Quayle is one of them,
and I am one of them. And I believe that he will be outstanding.
And he took a tremendous pounding, and everybody now knows that he
took a very unfair pounding.
   And I'd like each person to say, did I jump to conclusions
running down rumors that were so outrageous and so brutal. And he's
kept his head up and he will do very, very well. And he has my full
confidence and he'll have the confidence of people that are in
their thirties and forties and more.
   So judge the man on his record, not on a lot of rumors and
innuendo and trying to fool around with his name.
   My opponent says, ``J. Danforth Quayle.'' Do you know who J.
Danforth was? He was a man that gave his life in World War II. So
ridiculing a person's name is a little beneath this process and
he'll do very well when we get into the debate.
   Dukakis: Well, when it comes to ridicule, George, you win a gold
medal. I think we can agree on that.
   Bush: Just the facts.
   Dukakis: But did I sense a desire that maybe Lloyd Bentsen ought
to be your running mate when you said that the three people on your
ticket? (Laughter.)
   Bush: No. I think the debate ought to be _
   Dukakis: I think the American people have a right to judge us on
this question, on how we picked a running mate, a person who is a
heartbeat away from the presidency. I picked Lloyd Bentsen, a
distinguished, strong, mature, a leader in the Senate; somebody
whose qualifications nobody has questioned.
   Mr. Bush picked Dan Quayle. I doubt very much that Dan Quayle
was the best qualified person for that job. And as a matter of
fact, I think for most people the notion of ``President Quayle'' is
a very, very troubling notion tonight.

   Christopher Burroughs was 14 when he was
told his mother was a Tibetan saint who lived 300 years ago. But it
wasn't much of a surprise to him.
   ``She was always giving advice and teaching people,'' he says of
his mother, Catharine, who was enthroned Saturday as the Western
world's first adult reincarnate lama. Now 16, Christopher
eventually plans to continue the path of Buddha, known as dharma,
and become a monk.
   ``There is certainly an adjustment when you find out that Mom is
not just Mom,'' says her husband, Michael Burroughs, director of
the Buddhist prayer center in Poolesville, a suburb of Washington,
D.C. ``But there was no question that she always was
extraordinary.''
   Catharine Burroughs, a 38-year-old mother of three, had been a
meditation teacher in Maryland when Penor Rinpoche, a ``living
Buddha'' who runs a Buddhist monastery in India, visited her
classes in 1985 and told her that her instinctive knowledge was
Tibetan Buddhism, and that her wisdom was that of a Tibetan saint,
Ahkon Lhamo, who helped found a monastery the mid-1600s.
   He returned to the center Saturday, which he named the seat of
his teachings in America, to perform the ceremony.
   ``I was teaching Buddhism before I ever read a book on it,''
Mrs. Burroughs said while sipping tea after the ceremony.
   The reincarnate lamas, teachers with an obligation to help rid
the world of suffering, are venerated by Tibetan Buddhists because
they are believed to return to this world voluntarily to enlighten
others.
   Usually such lamas are recognized as children to be the
reincarnation of their predecessor who recently died.
   ``In India there are (reincarnate lamas) who have walked up to
their parents and said `I am not Joe-Bob, I am so-and-so. Take me
to my monastery,''' Mrs. Burroughs said.
   She was born in Brooklyn to a Roman Catholic Italian father and
Jewish mother. She attended high school and community college in
Miami, and moved to Maryland in 1982 to establish a place for
meditation.
   The Buddhist center, formally established in 1983 as Kunsang
Odsal Palyul Changchub Cheoling, is a temple of Buddhist teaching
and prayer devoted to the cessation of suffering.
   Its members are some 70 professionals in the
Baltimore-Washington area who take shifts maintaining a 24-hour
prayer vigil, and fund the center through private donations.

<HEAD>Audience Interprets Bush Remark as Slur on Boston Region</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (AP) _ Vice President George Bush drew a
deep groan from the presidential debate audience in questioning
Michael Dukakis' use of ``phony or some one of these marvelous
Boston adjectives'' to describe the Reagan administration's foreign
policy.
   With a long ``o-o-o-h,'' the audience appeared to have
interpreted Bush's remark during the presidential debate Sunday
night as a regional slur, appealing to a belief among many voters
that Dukakis' home town is a cradle for liberal politicians and
ideas.
   ``Several Bostonians don't like it,'' Bush said in response to
the utterances from the audience, ``But the rest of the country
will understand.''

   Lehrer: All right. John will now ask a question of the governor.
It will be the last question, and then the vice president will have
a rebuttal. John?
   Mashek: Well, governor, you did select Lloyd Bentsen of Texas.
   Dukakis: I did, indeed.
   Mashek: And you have a lot of disagreement with him on
fundamental issues, including the Reagan tax cuts, aid to the
rebels in Nicaragua, the death penalty, gun control _ who's right?
   Dukakis: Well, John, I'm a man who's been a chief executive for
10 years. I've picked a lot of people. I've picked cabinets, I've
named judges. I know that the people you pick make an enormous
difference in your ability to govern.
   And I set high standards, I try to meet them, and I insist that
people who work for me meet them. And if they don't, they don't
stick around very long.
   But, I didn't pick Lloyd Bentsen because he was a clone of Mike
Dukakis. I picked him because he was somebody who would be a strong
vice president, somebody who would be an active vice president,
somebody who would come to me, if somebody came up with a crazy
idea that we ought to trade arms to the ayatollah for hostages, and
say, ``Mr. President, that's wrong. We shouldn't do that.'' That's
the kind of vice president I want.
   He himself has said, and rightly so, that he will be a strong
vice president, but when the president makes a decision, that will
be his decision. And I am very, very proud of that choice. And I
didn't pick him because he agreed with me on everything.
   You know, Sam Rayburn once said that if two people agree on
everything, then only one person is doing the thinking.
   The fact is that I've picked somebody who not only will be a
great vice president, but if, God forbid, something happens to the
president, could step into that office and do so with distinction
and with strength and with leadership.
   I doubt very much, I doubt very much that Mr. Bush's selection
for the vice presidency of the United States meets that test.
   Lehrer: Mr. Vice President.
   Bush: We obviously have a difference. I believe it does meet the
test. We'll have an opportunity to see the two of them in action in
a friendly forum _ wonderful, friendly fashion like this.
   I had hoped that this'd, I'd hoped this had been a little
friendlier an evening.
   I'd wanted to hitchhike a ride home in his tank with him, but I
think now we're, we've got the lines too carefully drawn here.
   But you talk about judgment. I mean, what kind of judgment? I
mean, jumping all over the president on his decision on one area of
the foreign policy.
   What kind of judgment sense has your chief education adviser,
now in jail in Massachusetts? I mean, I don't think this is a fair
argument, but nevertheless, I support my nominee for vice
president, and he'll do an outstanding job.
   Lehrer: Gentlemen, I was given some bad word a moment ago. There
is time for one more question. (Laughter.) Getting it in my ear.
And Anne Groer will ask it.
   Groer: To Vice President Bush?
   Lehrer: To, to the governor. Sorry.
   Groer: Oh, I'm so sorry. Governor Dukakis, as many U.S. farmers
face or undergo foreclosure, the United States is considering the
possibility of forgiving a certain percentage of debt owed by Latin
American and Third World countries. Do you favor giving these
countries a break in their loans? And if so, how do you explain
that to the American farmers who are losing their land and
livelihood?
   Dukakis: Well, I think we have to go to work on the problem of
Third World debt, and we've got to assist those Third World
countries in dealing with this massive debt which they currently _
which they have incurred, and which is burdening them, and which,
if we don't do something about it and assist them, along with other
nations around the world, we'll destroy their economies, destroy
their future, and at the same time, we'll destroy markets that are
important to our farmers.
   But I also believe that we need an agricultural policy which
doesn't cost us the $15 billion to $20 billion to $25 billion a
year that it's been costing us over the course of the past three or
four years under this administration.
   I think it's going to require good, solid credit policies, and
thanks to the Congress, we now have an agricultural credit bill
which is helping, and improving the situation with at least some of
our farmers. I think it's going to require a combination of supply
management and reasonable price supports to make sure that our
farmers get a decent price.

<HEAD>Bush Uses Slip To Poke Fun at His Penchant for Verbal Mistakes</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (AP) _ Republican nominee George Bush used
some momentary confusion over weapons systems in the presidential
debate to poke fun at his tendency to utter bloopers on the
campaign trail.
   ``It's Christmas,'' the vice president said during the debate
with Democrat Michael Dukakis after confusing the Midgetman and
Minuteman with the MX missile but correcting himself immediately.
   Laughter erupted from the audience, remembering Bush's reference
earlier this month to the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor as
occurring on Sept. 7, 1941, instead of Dec. 7.
   ``Wouldn't it be nice to be perfect?'' Bush quipped in response
to the laughter. He then played to a Republican theme that Dukakis
is cold and aloof. ``Wouldn't it be nice to be the ice man, so you
never make a mistake?''
   Dukakis got the last laugh by picking up on the same quip when
Bush later objected to moderator Jim Lehrer cutting off his
response to a question on the Iran-Contra arms and money scandal.
   ``It's only on yellow here, wait a minute,'' Bush said,
referring to a light at the front of the stage warning that his
response time for the question was about to expire, but had not yet.
   Lehrer admitted he was wrong, apologized _ saying ``You said
nobody's perfect'' _ and told Bush to go ahead with his answer.
   ``I said I wasn't perfect, I thought you were,'' Bush told
Lehrer, drawing more giggles from the audience. ``Where was I?''
   ``The 25th of December, Mr. Vice President,'' Dukakis answered.
   ``I agree,'' Bush said. ``I've finished.''

   And I think it also is going to require an administration that
understands that there are tremendous opportunities out there for
the development of new uses for agricultural products, new uses
which can help us to clean up our environment at the same time:
biodegradable plastic, gasohol, which the vice president himself
has been involved in, road de-icers made from corn products.
   I mean, there are enormous opportunities out there to expand
markets and to build a strong future for our farmers.
   But I don't think there is anything mutually exclusive or
contradictory about building a strong farm economy in this country
and assisting our family farms, and providing a good, strong future
for rural communities and for rural America, and at the same time
working on Third World debt.
   As a matter of fact, Mexico itself is one of our biggest
agricultural customers. So, in the sense that we can work to help
Mexico, we build and expand and deal with its very serious economic
problems; we help our farmers at the same time.
   Lehrer: Mr. Vice President.
   Bush: I oppose supply management and production controls. I
support the Farm Bill, the '85 Farm Bill, and its spending is
moving in the right direction.
   I want to expand our markets abroad, and that's why I'd like to
call for that first economic summit to be on agriculture.
   I will not go back to the way the Democrats did it, and use food
as a political weapon and throw a grain embargo on the farmers in
this country.
   I want to see rural redevelopment, and I have been out front in
favor of alternate sources of energy, and one of them is gasohol,
and it comes from using your corn, and I think we can do better in
terms of biodegradables, for a lot of products. So, I'm optimistic
about the agricultural economy.
   In terms of the Third World, I support the Baker plan. I want to
see market economies spring up all around the world. And, to the
degree they do, we are succeeding.
   And I don't want to see the banks let off the hook; I would
oppose that. But I think we're on the right track in agriculture,
and I am very, very encouraged.
   But let's not go back to, that's what they call ``supply
management'' and ``production control,'' that will simply price us
out of the international market. Let's try to expand our markets
abroad.
   Lehrer: All right. That really is the end. Now, let's go to
closing statements. They will be two minutes each in duration by
agreement. Vice President Bush goes first. Governor Dukakis,
second. Mr. Vice President.
   Bush: I talked in New Orleans about a gentler and kinder nation,
and I have made specific proposals on education, and the
enviroment, on ethics, on energy, and on how we do better in
battling crime in our country.
   But there are two main focal points of this election:
opportunity and peace. I want to keep this expansion going. Yes, we
want change, but we are the change, I am the change. I don't want
to go back to malaise and misery index. And so opportunity, keep
America at work. The best poverty program is a job with dignity in
the private sector.
   And in terms of peace, we are on the right track. We've achieved
an arms control agreement that our critics thought was never
possible. And I want to build on it; I want to see us finalize that
START agreement; and I want to be the one to finally lead the world
to banishing chemical and biological weapons. I want to see
asymmetrical reductions in conventional forces.
   And then it gets down to a question of values. We've had a
chance to spell out our differences on the Pledge of Allegiance
here tonight, and on tough sentencing of drug kingpins and this
kind of thing. I do favor the death penalty. And we've got a wide
array of differences on those.

   But in the final analysis, in the final analysis, the person
goes into that voting booth they're going to say: Who has the
values I believe in? Who has the experience that we trust? Who has
the integrity and the stability to get the job done? My fellow
Americans, I am that man and I ask for your support. Thank you very
much.
   Lehrer: Governor. Governor Dukakis.
   Dukakis: This has been an extraordinary 18 months for Kitty and
me, and for our family.
   We've had an opportunity to campaign all over this country, to
meet with so many of you in communities, states and regions, to get
to know you.
   I'm more optimistic today than I was when I began about this
nation, providing we have the kind of leadership in Washington that
can work with you, that can build partnerships, that can build jobs
in every part of this country, not certain parts of this country.
   You know, my friends, my parents came to this country as
immigrants, like millions and millions of Americans before them and
since, seeking opportunity, seeking the American dream.
   They made sure their sons understood that this was the greatest
country in the world. That those of us, especially who were the
sons and daughters of immigrants, had a special responsibility to
give something back to the country that had opened up its arms to
our parents and given so much to them.
   I believe in the American dream. I am a product of it. And I
want to help that dream come true for every single citizen in this
land _ with a good job and good wages, with good schools in every
part of this country and every community in this country. With
decent and affordable housing that our people can buy and own and
live in, so that we end the shame of homelessness in America. With
decent and affordable health care for all working families.
   Yes, it's a tough problem, as Mr. Bush says, but it's not an
insolvable problem. It's one that we will solve and must solve _
with a clean and wholesome environment. And with a strong America,
that's strong militarily and economically, as we must be. An
America that provides strong, international leadership because
we're true to our values. We have an opportunity, working together,
to build that future, to build a better America, to build the best
America. Because the best America doesn't hide, we compete.
   The best America doesn't waste, we invest. The best America
doesn't leave some of its citizens behind, we leave _ we bring
everybody along. And the best America is not behind us, the best
America is yet to come.
   Thank you very much for listening.

<TEXT>
   WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (AP) _ Here are excerpts of the debate
Sunday night between presidential candidates George Bush and
Michael Dukakis.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Question: What is there about these times that drives or draws
so many Americans to use drugs?
   Bush: I think we've seen a deterioration of values. I think for
a while, as a nation, we condoned those things we should have
condemned. ...
   Dukakis: ... It's important that our leaders demonstrate those
values from the top. ... Here we are with a government that's been
dealing with a drug-running Panamanian dictator. We've been dealing
with him; he's been dealing drugs to our kids. ... And governors
like me, and others, have been trying to deal with the
consequences. ...
   Bush: Seven administrations were dealing with Mr. Noriega. It
was the Reagan-Bush administration that brought this man to
justice. ...
   Question: ... Would you identify for us ... three specific
programs that you are willing to cut to bring that deficit down.
   Dukakis: ... There are certain weapons systems which we don't
need and we can't afford. ... Secondly, we've got to invest in
economic growth in this country, in every part of this country. ...
Thirdly, we have to bring interest rates down ... And finally,
we've got to go out there and collect billions and billions of
dollars in taxes owed ...
   The thing I don't understand about Mr. Bush's approach to this
is how he could possibly be serious about bringing that deficit
down given what he says he wants to do. ...
   If he keeps this up he's going to be the Joe Isuzu of American
politics. ...
   Bush: ... That answer was about as clear as Boston Harbor. ...
When you cut capital gains you put people to work. ... Now
Massachusetts doesn't have an enormous defense budget, but
nevertheless the governor raised taxes five different times. ...
   Question: ... Today, 37 million Americans, including many
working families with aging parents and young children, cannot
afford any health insurance _ but earn too much to qualify for
Medicaid. What will you do to provide protection for them, and how
will you pay for it?
   Bush: One thing I will not do, is sock every business in the
country, and thus, throw some people out of work. ... What I will
do, is permit people to buy into Medicaid. ...
   Dukakis: ... It's no answer to those 37 million people, most of
them members of working families who don't have a dime of health
insurance, and don't know how to pay the bills if the kids get sick
at night. ...
   Question: ... What is so wrong with the governor being a member
of an organization (the ACLU) which has come to the defense of,
among other people, Col. Oliver North?
   Bush: ... I don't agree with a lot of the, most of the positions
of the ACLU. ... He has every right to exercise his passion as what
he said: a strong, progressive liberal. ...
   They raised the same thing with me on the Pledge of Allegiance.
You see, I'd have found a way to sign that bill. ... I'm not
questioning his patriotism. ... I am questioning his judgment on
these matters. ...
   Dukakis: ... Of course, the vice president is questioning my
patriotism. ... And I resent it, I resent it.
   Question: ... What commitment are you willing to make tonight to
(the homeless)?
   Bush: ... The government has a role. It is to fully fund the
McKinney Act. There are certain Army bases that the act calls for
that can be used in certain cases to shelter people when it's
rough. ...
   Dukakis: ... Mr. Bush wants to spend billions and trillions on
``Star Wars.'' ... Do we spend money on that weapon system in the
billions and trillions? Or is providing some decent and affordable
housing for families of this country ...
   Question: ... If abortions were to become illegal again, do you
think that the women who defy the law ... and the doctors who
performed them, should go to jail?
   Bush: I haven't sorted out the penalties, but I do know -- I do
know that I oppose abortion, and I favor adoption. ...
   Dukakis: Well, I think what the vice president is saying is that
he's prepared to brand a woman a criminal for making this decision.
...
   Question: ... If it haunts you so, why over the eight years of
the Reagan-Bush Administration have so many programs to help the
inner cities been eliminated or cut?
   Bush: ... I think part of it is the crime-infested
neighborhoods, and that's why I'm a strong believer in trying to
control crimes in the neighborhood, why I was so pleased to be
endorsed by the policemen on the beat _ the Boston Police
Department.
   Dukakis: Well, I must have been living through a different eight
years from the one that the Vice President's been living through,
because this administration has cut and slashed and cut and slashed
programs for children, for nutrition, for the kinds of things that
can help these youngsters to live better lives. ...
   Question: ... Where would you get the money to devote to the
inner cities ...
   Dukakis: ... If we invest in job training, in child care for
those youngsters, in some extended health benefits so that that
mother and her kids don't lose their health benefits when she goes
to work ...
   Bush: ... We're putting more money per child into education, and
we are not performing as we should. ...
   Question: Governor, the vice president continually refers to
your lack of experience, weakness, naivete on foreign policy and
national security matters. ...
   Dukakis: ... That's a charge that's always made against any
governor who runs for the presidency. I think it was one of the
things that Mr. Bush said about Mr. Reagan back in 1980. ...
   The vice president has a long resume, but it didn't stop him
from endorsing the sale of arms to the Ayatollah. ... His
experience didn't prevent him from ...being involved in the
relationship between this government and Mr. Noriega and the
drug-trafficking in Panama. He went to the Philippines in the early
'80s and commended Ferdinand Marcos for his commitment to
democracy. And he continues to support a failed policy in Central
America ...
   Bush: ... I've met Mr. Gorbachev. I met Mr. Shevardnadze ...
These people are tough. ... But please, do not go back to the days
when the military was as weak as they could be, when the morale was
down, and we, when we were the laughing stock around the world. ...

   Question: ... Are you prepared to tell the voters one system ...
that you'd be willing to cut or even eliminate that wouldn't
endanger national security?
   Bush: ... What I am not going to do when we are negotiating with
the Soviet Union, ... I'm not going to give away a couple of aces
in that very tough card game. ... We are going to make some changes
and some tough choices before we go to deployment on the Midgetman
missile, or on the, on the Minuteman _ whatever it is _ we're going
to have to _ the MX, MX. ...
   Dukakis: ... Mr. Bush wants to spend billions on Star Wars. He
apparently wants to spend billions on the MX on railroad cars ... I
thought the administration was opposed to the Midgetman. I thought
the administration was at the negotiating table in Geneva
suggesting that we ban mobile missile systems entirely. ... I am
for the Stealth, I am for the D-5, I am for going ahead with the
advanced cruise missile. ...
   Question: ... Should we be doing a lot to help the economics and
the social development of a country that we have so long regarded
as an adversary?
   Bush: What I think we ought to do is take a look at perestroika
and glasnost, welcome them, but keep our eyes open, be cautious,
because the Soviet change is not fully established yet. ...
   Dukakis:
   What we're talking about is a combination of a strong and
effective and credible nuclear deterrent ... and at the same time,
a willingness to move forward steadily, thoughtfully, cautiously.
...
   Question: ... You have gone from calling the Strategic Defense
Initiative, or Star Wars, ``a fantasy and a fraud'' to saying
recently you would continue SDI research, and might even deploy the
system if Congress supported such a move ...
   Dukakis: ... I've said from the beginning that we ought to
continue research into the strategic system at about the level it
was at in 1983. ... But I don't know of any reputable scientists
who believe that this system, at least as originally conceived,
could possibly work ...
   Bush: ... How do you deter nuclear attack without modernizing
our nuclear forces, when the Soviets are modernizing?
   Question: ... If any Americans are held hostage, and you become
president, to what lengths would you go to rescue them?
   Dukakis: ... You cannot make concessions to terrorists, ever _
ever. Because if you do, it's an open invitation to other
terrorists to take hostages and to blackmail us. ... (Bush)
endorsed that decision, endorsed the sale of arms to the Ayatollah
in exchange for hostages ...
   Bush: ... I've said mistakes were made _ clearly, nobody's going
to think the president started out thinking he was going to trade
arms for hostages. ...
   Question: ... So far, you won't tell the American people in
considerable measure what advice you gave the president on issues
... And, if you don't, how do we judge your judgment in the Oval
Office in the last eight years?
   Bush: You judge by the whole record. ... Are we closer to peace?
Are we doing better in anti-terrorism? Should we have listened to
my opponent who wanted to send the UN into the Persian Gulf? ... Is
Iran talking to Iraq about peace? ... Are the Soviets coming out of
Afghanistan? ...
   Dukakis: ... I think those are very, very serious questions of
judgment ... We're not going to make those kinds of mistakes. ...
   Question: Democrats, and even some Republicans, are still
expressing reservations about the qualifications and credentials of
Senator Dan Quayle of Indiana ...
   Bush: ... I see a man who is young and I'm putting my confidence
in a whole generation of people that are in their thirties and in
their forties. ... I see a young man who is knowledgeable in
defense. ...
   So judge the man on his record, not on a lot of rumors and
innuendo and trying to fool around with his name. ...
   Dukakis: ... I picked Lloyd Bentsen, a distinguished, strong,
mature, a leader in the Senate; somebody whose qualifications
nobody has questioned. Mr. Bush picked Dan Quayle. I doubt very
much that Dan Quayle was the best qualified person for that job ...
   Question: ... You have a lot of disagreement with (Bentsen) on
fundamental issues ... who's right?
   Dukakis: ... I didn't pick Lloyd Bentsen because he was a clone
of Mike Dukakis. I picked him because he was somebody who would be
a strong vice president, somebody who would be an active vice
president, somebody who would come to me, if somebody came up with
a crazy idea that we ought to trade arms to the ayatollah for
hostages, and say, ``Mr. President, that's wrong. We shouldn't do
that.'' ...
   Bush: ... But you talk about judgment. I mean, what kind of
judgment? I mean, jumping all over the president on his decision on
one area of the foreign policy. What kind of judgment sense has
your chief education adviser, now in jail in Massachusetts? ...
   Question: Do you favor giving (Latin American and Third World)
countries a break in their loans? And if so, how do you explain
that to the American farmers ...?
   Dukakis: ... If we don't do something about it and assist them,
along with other nations around the world, we'll destroy their
economies, destroy their future, and at the same time, we'll
destroy markets that are important to our farmers. But I also
believe that we need an agricultural policy which doesn't cost us
the $15 billion to $20 billion to $25 billion a year ...
   Bush: ... I want to expand our markets abroad, and that's why
I'd like to call for that first economic summit to be on
agriculture. I will not go back to the way the Democrats did it,
and use food as a political weapon and throw a grain embargo on the
farmers in this country. ...
   CLOSING STATEMENTS
   Bush: ... There are two main focal points of this election:
opportunity and peace. ... Yes, we want change, but we are the
change, I am the change. I don't want to go back to malaise and
misery index. ...
   And in terms of peace, we are on the right track. We've achieved
an arms control agreement that our critics thought was never
possible. And I want to build on it ...
   In the final analysis, the person goes into that voting booth
they're going to say: Who has the values I believe in? Who has the
experience that we trust? Who has the integrity and the stability
to get the job done? My fellow Americans, I am that man ...
   Dukakis: ... My parents came to this country as immigrants ...
They made sure their sons understood this is the greatest country
in the world. That those of us, especially who were the sons and
daughters of immigrants, had a special responsibility to give
something back to the country that had opened up its arms to our
parents and given so much to them. ...
   We have an opportunity, working together, to build that future,
to build a better America, to build a best America. Because a best
America doesn't hide, we compete.
   The best America doesn't waste, we invest. The best America
doesn't leave some of its citizens behind, we leave _ we bring
everybody along. And the best America is not behind us, the best
America is yet to come.

   The Rev. Barbara C. Harris says her election
as the first woman bishop in the Anglican Communion's 450-year
history offers new hope to those who've felt alienated and ignored
by the Episcopal Church.
   ``A fresh wind is blowing across this church of ours,'' Ms.
Harris said Sunday in her sermon at the Church of the Advocate,
where she serves as interim rector.
   The Episcopal Church is attempting to include everyone in the
mainstream ``of God's justice, grace, brotherhood and sisterhood,''
the black cleric told a congregation of 50.
   Pointing to the Rev. Jesse Jackson's ``Rainbow Coalition,''
reaching across color and sexual lines, she said the church's
action gives ``new hope ... and new vision to hundreds of
thousands'' who have felt left out of the denomination.
   Ms. Harris, a 58-year-old former public relations executive, was
elected Saturday to the position of suffragan, or assistant, bishop
for the eastern Massachusetts diocese. The diocese, which includes
Boston, is the nation's largest in both geography and population.
   However, the third-ranking prelate in the Church of England said
Sunday he will refuse to recognize Ms. Harris or any other woman
bishop.
   ``I have already stated publicly ... that I would not be able to
be in communion with a woman so elected and consecrated,'' said the
Rt. Rev. Graham Leonard, bishop of London.
   Bishops at a world Anglican conference this summer approved a
resolution saying they would respect and remain in fellowship with
churches that have women priests and bishops, even if they disagree
with their principles.
   Several appointments earlier this year show the church is
changing, said Ms. Harris. Two black priests were elected coadjutor
bishops, who are first in line to succeed their presiding bishops,
without first serving as assistants.
   One, the Rev. Herbert Thompson Jr., was installed in Cincinnati
on Saturday as the first black bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of
Southern Ohio.
   Ms. Harris told the congregation her election ``is of
significance to the Episcopal Church in the United States and to
the worldwide Anglican Communion.''
   The Rev. Paul Washington, retired pastor of the Church of the
Advocate, said Sunday that Ms. Harris' election will allow other
qualified women to move into bishop positions.
   The Episcopal Church is one of 27 self-governing church bodies
in 164 countries that comprise the Anglican Communion. About 70
million people belong, with 2.5 million in the United States.
   After services, Ms. Harris said she was ``deeply honored'' to
accept the position. She declined to answer questions until a news
conference scheduled Tuesday in Boston.
   The Philadelpia native was a parishioner at the Church of the
Advocate in 1974 when the first 11 female Episcopal priests were
ordained there _ against church rules at the time.
   Ms. Harris, a divorcee, was ordained a priest in 1980, four
years after the church changed its policy. She was pastor in
Norristown from 1980 to 1984, then became executive director of the
Episcopal Publishing Co.

   WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (AP) _ The debate was over and gridlock
reigned in the press room. It wasn't reporters trying to reach
George Bush and Michael Dukakis, it was the stampede of political
heavyweights shamelessly promoting their candidate's performance
while making the other guy's seem abysmal.
   Senators and governors competed for reporters' attention and
television's cameras to claim that Dukakis came across as
presidential, humane and compassionate and Bush as plastic and
fuzzy _ or vice versa.
   In political parlance, it is known as the spin patrol and a glut
of spin was spun by politicians brought in for just that purpose.
The Democrats had the likes of Sens. Ted Kennedy and Bill Bradley
and the Republicans had Sen. Alan Simpson, former Sen. John Tower
and New Hampshire Gov. John Sununu.
   The Wake Forest University cafeteria, turned into a press room,
was packed with post-debate spinners, who needed no prompting to
stand amenably, surrounded by cameras and tape recorders and
reporters with notebooks. Other spinners made the rounds of the
television shows.
   Kennedy volunteered that his home state governor, Dukakis, had
scored a clear win. ``He was presidential, he was compelling, he
was convincing,'' said Kennedy.
   The Democratic line on Bush was typified by Dukakis adviser Tom
Donilon, who coordinated the Democrat's debate preparation: ``I
don't think he was very presidential tonight. He wasn't in command
and control. He was wandering.''
   Simpson of Wyoming said Bush showed he was ``a real human
being'' while Dukakis ``looked absolutely programmed'' as well as
``plastic.''
   And Sununu came up with this instant analysis: ``I thought the
vice president looked very relaxed. I think Michael Dukakis looked
very clerkish.''
   While each side claimed their candidate had won, many were
willing to say that the winning and losing was not pronounced and
some even ventured to acknowledge that the other candidate scored a
point or two.
   ``I don't think either candidate made any mistakes,'' owned up
Sununu.
   Several Democrats seized on Bush's stumbles such as when he
referred to the Midgetman missile, ``Or the Minuteman _ whatever it
is.''
   No, rebutted the Bush spinners, little mistatements showed Bush
was human, not a ``man who looks like a machine,'' in Simpson's
description of Dukakis.
   Appearances were important to the spinners because each side had
wanted to project their man as a caring, humane candidate as well
as one who grasped the issues.
   Predictably, each side expressed satisfaction on that score.
   Media consultant Frank Greer who had coached Dukakis on being
more personable, said his candidate ``did everything that he needed
to do and more.''
   Richard Darman, who played the part of Dukakis in Bush's debate
practice sessions, on the other hand said Bush scored ``a perfect
10'' while Dukakis came across as ``dour, stern, didactic.''
   ``Dukakis was boring,'' said Bush campaign manager Lee Atwater.
   ``George Bush was on the defensive,'' said Sen. John Kerry,
D-Mass.
   Several Republicans, including GOP party chairman Frank
Fahrenkopf stressed that more than winning or losing, the debate
helped crystallize the differences between the two candidates and
in the mind of the Bush ssupporters cement Dukakis as a liberal.
   ``They both did fine. They both reinforced their positions,''
said Atwater, who then could not resist adding the spin: ``All the
swing voters that watched this, would come down on the side of the
vice president.''

<HEAD>Soviet Father and Son Reunited After 22 Years</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Soviet journalist who defected to Britain in
1966 is now reunited with his son, who had tried in vain for more
than 20 years to gain permission to emigrate.
   ``Today is the first day in my life that I have been really
happy,'' said Anatoli Shustov, 43, standing arm-in-arm with his
father, Leonid Finkelstein, at London's Heathrow Airport after a
flight from Moscow on Sunday.
   ``I have plans to improve my English and start a new life,'' he
told reporters through an interpreter.
   Finkelstein, a 64-year-old journalist, last saw his son in
December 1965 shortly before he sought political asylum during a
visit to Britain with a group of writers.
   He said his protracted campaign to bring his son to Britain came
to nothing until the intervention of the British government last
year, when Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe presented to Soviet
authorities a list of some 20 Soviets seeking to emigrate to
Britain, most to be reunited with family members.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher discussed the plight of those
people with Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev when he stopped in
Britain Dec. 7 on his way to a Washington summit with President
Reagan. The Foreign Office says many have since emigrated, but has
declied to give a figure.
   Finkelstein has worked for the British Broadcasting Corp.'s
Russian Service since 1980. Shustov, an industrial chemist, said he
listened to his father's weekly broadcasts in the Soviet Union.
   Because he had applied to emigrate, Shustov said he was barred
from working as a chemist and forced to take jobs as parking-lot
attendant and shopkeeper _ ``such work where there would be no risk
of getting any classified information.''
   ``Maybe now I will work as an industrial chemist again,'' he
said.
   Finkelstein said he was ``still a little at sea'' over meeting
his son again.
   ``I can't yet form an opinion but the omens are good,'' he said.
``I have good signs which I haven't had for years in my life _ good
dreams, good happenings and good tidings altogether. I think it
will be alright.''
   Finkelstein said he was committed to a labor camp in Moscow
between 1947 and 1953 for ``using the wrong words'' and his son
used to visit him there.
   ``I remember him sitting on my knee and saying to me, `Dad,
let's go home.'''

<HEAD>Foreign Aid Cutoff Could Bring Change in Burma, Analysts Say</HEAD>

   A growing economic boycott by the
international community could force change in Burma, where an angry
populace and economic crisis are challenging the resolve of the new
military government.
   But some analysts following the recent chaotic events in the
Southeast Asian nation are skeptical that outside pressure can sway
the top leadership, given its 26 years of isolationism and
disregard of earlier calls for reform.
   ``There's very little leverage. If the outside world holds up
its hands in horror, they (Burmese leaders) are still going to do
what they think is necessary,'' one Bangkok-based diplomat said.
   Japan, which accounts for about 80 percent of foreign loans and
grants to Burma, has just stopped sending assistance. West Germany,
the No. 2 donor, froze its aid Sept. 5 and Washington announced
last week that it was suspending all but humanitarian help.
   These countries along with Australia, China, Britain, the Soviet
Union, Sweden, the European Economic Community and others have
expressed concern over the violence in recent days.
   Western diplomats estimate that since last fall, several
thousand demonstrators have been killed on orders from a military
elite that seized power in 1962 and led one of Asia's most
resource-rich countries into economic ruin and isolation.
   Gen. Saw Maung seized power a week ago in a military coup that
overthrew civilian President Maung Maung. Diplomats say Saw Maung
is a close associate of Ne Win, who led the 1962 coup and ruled
with an iron fist until he resigned in July after massive street
protests.
   The recent political turmoil has crippled an economy that was
already on a rapid downward spiral. Factories have halted
production, transport has been paralyzed and foreign currency
reserves are virtually at zero while the foreign debt has climbed
to more than $4 billion.
   ``They're in such bad shape that if the Japanese and others just
say `absolutely no more' until there is some kind of democracy,
there would be changes,'' American economic consultant Robert
Nathan said in an interview.
   But Nathan, who has spent several years in Burma, said any
economic boycott would have to be accompanied by continued popular
_ and probably bloody _ resistance headed by a unified oppositon
coalition.
   He said sanctions by the Japanese would have the greatest
economic impact on Burma. Sanctions by the United States, which
gives a relatively modest $14 million, could have a significant
``moral, psychological'' impact, he said.
   Another expert on Burma, David Steinberg of the United States,
said a ``carrot and stick approach'' could induce change. While
halting all aid at present, the major donors should at the same
formulate a comprehensive assistance program to be implemented when
a pluralistic system emerges in Burma, he said.
   In the past, Burma has been impervious to criticism by
international human rights groups such as Amnesty International _
and even to advice on economic policy from such major aid donors as
the World Bank.
   Advocating strict neutrality, Burma pulled out of the
non-aligned movement in 1979 and since has taken other steps to
minimize outside influence. It risked offending its biggest donor
by closing down the Rangoon offices of Japanese companies in 1986.
   ``Burma has been in the backwaters for 26 years, and Ne Win is
benefiting from this,'' said Swedish Burma expert Bertil Lintner.
   He said neither the Soviet Union, the United States nor giant
neighbors China and India have had real leverage with Burmese
leaders and that all major powers have avoided interference for
fear of provoking the others.
   Despite critical humanitarian needs, including basic medical
supplies at hospitals overflowing with wounded victims,
international emergency aid has to date been minimal.
   ``This is very much an affair of the Burmese people ... but I
hope the international community would be bit stronger about its
protests,'' a key opposition leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, said in an
interview published in Hong Kong's South China Morning Post.
   In the past, key donors including the World Bank and Asian
Development Bank have provided as much as $500 milion a year in
assistance to prop up the faltering economy.
   West Germay last year promised $36 million while Japan offered
$244.1 million in 1986, $172 million last year and only $27.5
million to date in 1988. The World Bank by mandate cannot halt
assistance for political reasons but can refrain from starting new
projects. Neither it nor the Asian Development Bank has issued a
statement on the current situtation in Burma.

   In 90 minutes, George Bush and Michael Dukakis
gave the American people a clear-cut choice on issues likely to
land on the desk of the next occupant of the Oval Office: from
housing the homeless to dealing with Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev.
   Their debate Sunday night brought out in sharp relief their
differences on the Strategic Defense Initiative, on taxes, on
universal health insurance, the death penalty, abortion and other
issues.
   Between the jibes and jabs, both Bush and Dukakis managed to
spell out many of the stands they have built their campaigns around.
   They fudged on some big questions, like how they would deal with
the federal deficit, or fulfill campaign promises without adding to
the red ink.
   When confronted with what one reporter called the nation's No. 1
domestic problem, drug abuse, Bush suggested the answer is ``to
instill values in these young people,'' while Dukakis implied all
would be well if the White House just hadn't dealt with a
drug-running Panamanian dictator.
   Here is a look at how other key issues played out in the debate:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>STAR WARS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Dukakis accused Bush of wanting to spend ``billions and
trillions on Star Wars.'' He said he knew of no reputable scientist
who believes this ``kind of an Astrodome over ourselves'' could
work. But Dukakis said he would continue basic Star Wars research
at its 1983 level of $1 billion a year _ about a quarter of the
current budget.
   Bush demanded to know why he would ``spend a dime on something
that you consider a fantasy, and a fraud.'' Bush vowed, ``I will
fully research it, go forward as fast as we can. We've sent up the
levels of funding, and when it is deployable, I will deploy it.
That's my position on SDI, and it's never waivered a bit.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>DEFICIT</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Bush said his ``flexible freeze'' would help bring the deficit
down. He also called for line-item veto authority and a balanced
budget amendment to the Constitution.
   Dukakis suggested he'd find savings in agriculture subsidies,
scrap certain weapons, find ways to bring interest rates down and
bring in ``billions and billions'' by cracking down on tax cheats.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>CAPITAL GAINS TAX</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Dukakis charged Bush's promise to lower the tax on capital gains
(from 28 to 15 percent) would cost $40 billion and provide a tax
break of $30,000 (``more than the average teacher makes'') for
people earning $200,000 a year.
   Bush said that when the capital gains tax was cut in the past,
it produced more revenue and investment, not less.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>HEALTH INSURANCE</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Dukakis defended his plan to seek legislation requiring most
businesses to offer workers health insurance; that would reach 22
million of the 37 million Americans who now have no health
insurance. ``I think it's time that when you get a job in this
country it came with health insurance,'' the Democrat said.
   But Bush said that would cost businesses $35 billion. ``One
thing I will not do, is sock every business in the country, and
thus, throw some people out of work,'' he said.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>HOMELESS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Asked about the nation's up to 3 million homeless, Bush said he
would fully fund the McKinney Act and seek to galvanize voluntary
efforts.
   Dukakis charged the Reagan administration created the problem by
cutting back ``by 90 percent on our commitment to affordable
housing for families of low and moderate income. And when you do
that, you have homeless families.''
   Bush countered that interest rates were 21{ percent the last
time ``your party controlled the White House.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>ABORTION</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Dukakis said, ``I don't favor abortion. I don't think it's a
good thing. I don't think most people do. The question is, who
makes the decision? And I think it has to be the woman, in the
exercise of her own conscience and religious beliefs, that makes
that decision.''
   Bush, who favors outlawing all abortions except to save the
mother's life or in cases of rape or incest, ducked a question on
whether he favors jailing women and doctors who defied such a law.
``I haven't sorted out the penalties,'' he said.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>POVERTY</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Bush said he supports Head Start; the Womens, Infant and
Children nutrition program and expansion of Medicaid to help
alleviate urban poverty, as well as cracking down on crime.
   Dukakis charged the Reagan-Bush administration has ``cut and
slashed and butchered'' education and nutrition programs for poor
children, and aid for college. He accused the administration of
resisting welfare reforms.
   Bush said federal spending on education actually has risen in
the Reagan years.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>FOREIGN AFFAIRS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Dukakis defended his lack of experience in the foreign arena,
saying that didn't hamper other governors who became president such
as Woodrow Wilson and Franklin D. Roosevelt. And he charged that
Bush's ``long resume ... didn't stop him from endorsing the sale of
arms to the Ayatollah'' and being involved with Panama's Manuel
Antonio Noriega.
   Bush offered a ``deal'' to Dukakis: ``I will take all the blame
for those two incidents if you give me half the credit for all of
the good things that have happened in world peace since Ronald
Reagan and I took over from the Carter administration.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>NUCLEAR WEAPONS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Dukakis denied he favors ``unilateral disarmament,'' but
acknowledged he would cut ``certain weapon system we don't need and
can't afford.'' Bush criticized his rival's opposition to the
mobile MX and Midgetman missiles, saying the Soviets are tough
negotiators, and ``I'm not going to give away a couple of aces in
that very tough card game.''
   Dukakis said, ``I thought the administration was opposed to the
Midgetman.'' He said the administration has suggested at the Geneva
arms talks ``that we ban mobile missile systems entirely.''

   The dollar edged up against the Japanese currency
in Tokyo today while stock prices eased over widespread concerns
about the health of ailing Emperor Hirohito.
   The dollar closed at 134.73 yen, up 0.26 yen from its close on
Thursday, the last day of trading. It opened at 134.80 yen and
moved in a narrow range of 134.66-134.85 yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, the main index
on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, shed 59.17 points or 0.22 percent to
end Monday's trading at 27,330.95.
   Dealers said the dollar's strength followed a reaffirmation
among monetary authorities from seven major industrialized
countries, meeting in West Berlin over the weekend, that they would
continue to coordinate economic policies targeting stable exchange
rates and containment of inflation.
   But they said the market needed fresh incentives to determine
the direction of the currency. ``They (the G-7) did not say whether
the dollar should or shouldn't be traded higher or lower,''
complained one dealer at a major commercial bank, who spoke
anonymously.
   Seiichi Kita of Daiwa Securities said steel issues turned out to
be ``a driving force to gear up the index in late morning trading''
as investors began to buy prospective shares ahead of a new
financial year beginning Tuesday.
   The Nikkei index lost 159.63 points, or 0.58 percent, in early
trading, following a 38.19-point loss during Saturday's half-day
session, after morning papers reported the emperor was continuing
to receive blood transfusions. But palace officials later denied
the reports and said Hirohito was in stable condition.
   Kita said, however, investors were still concerned about the
87-year-old monarch.
   Both the currency and stock markets in Tokyo were closed Friday
because of a national holiday.

   WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (AP) _ Demonstrators who wanted to deliver a
message to the candidates were sealed off on the soccer field, but
that didn't stop Wake Forest University students from expressing
themselves. Some undecideds hung a banner: ``Throw 'em both back.
Let's go fishing again.''
   It could have been homecoming weekend _ with the Big Debate
taking the place of the Big Game.
   There were banners, partisan crowds, a huge press contingent and
a festive yet tense atmosphere Sunday as George Bush and Michael
Dukakis matched wits for 90 minutes in the chapel with millions of
Americans looking on through television.
   Placards dotted the windows of buildings ringing the grassy
quadrangle at the center of the tree-lined campus. Banners hung
from windowsills with catchy slogans: ``I hate pork rinds. Vote for
Dukakis,'' and ``Deacons don't dig the Duke.''
   Wake Forest's athletic teams use the nickname ``Demon Deacons.''
   Other banners had less partisan messages: ``Don't hide in a Bush
or run for the Mike. Come see for yourself who you like.''
   Demonstrators representing a variety of causes hoped for a
moment in the spotlight, but the university soccer field where they
were shuttled off to was hundreds of yards away from the debate
site.
   ``We'd like to be closer but that's something we can't do
anything about,'' said Marian Franklin of the Winston-Salem chapter
of the National Organization for Women, who held a sign touting the
Equal Rights Amendment.
   As the debate time neared, a throng of star-struck students
packed sidewalks near Wait Chapel, watching for the arrival of
VIPs. Network anchors appeared to excite the crowd more than anyone
if the flashbulb pops and gasps of recognition were any indication.
   Only two public entrances to the chapel were provided, creating
huge traffic jams as people struggled through security checks.
   Inside, the crowd chatter grew and tension built in anticipation
of candidates' grand entrance.
   Kitty Dukakis, wife of the Massachusetts governor, entered the
auditorium while Democratic National Chairman Paul Kirk and his GOP
counterpart Frank Fahrenkopf were welcoming the crowd. Mrs.
Dukakis, wearing a dark blue dress, took her seat in the front row.
   After Kirk and Fahrenkopf stopped talking, Bush's wife, Barbara,
entered through another door. She wore a black-and-white print
dress and a pearl necklace.
   Bush partisans gave her a standing ovation; Dukakis supporters
remained seated and did not clap.
   The vice president and the Massachusetts governor walked onstage
simultaneously from opposite sides, meeting at the center and
cordially shaking hands. But they wasted no time attacking each
other.
   Moderator Jim Lehrer had urged the feisty crowd not to applaud,
cheer or otherwise disrupt the debate _ a plea that was ignored as
the spectators vented their pleasure or disdain.
   Bush's claim that he was not attacking Dukakis's patriotism on
the Pledge of Allegiance issue drew scornful laughter from the
Democratic side of the aisle. When Dukakis said he had been tough
on criminals, it was the Bush side's turn to guffaw.
   The applause and signs of displeasure became more frequent as
the debate went on _ despite a second admonition from Lehrer _ and
the candidates' exchanges got more heated. The temperatures inside
the chapel seemed to rise; Bush and Dukakis frequently sipped water
and Bush mopped his brow with a handkerchief as his rival delivered
a closing statement.
   The combatants again shook hands and smiled after the debate's
conclusion. Members of the candidates' families hurried forward;
Bush leaned forward to kiss his wife while Dukakis and his wife
embraced.
   They lingered onstage for several moments; Bush even autographed
a couple of debate programs. Then both rushed away to post-debate
rallies.

   None of the families of the seven astronauts who
died in the Challenger disaster 32 months ago plan to attend
Discovery's launch Thursday, and some may not even watch it on
television, a spokeswoman says.
   ``I would hate to see anything happen to it (Discovery),'' Bruce
Jarvis, father of Challenger astronaut Gregory Jarvis, said in a
recent interview.
   June Scobee, whose husband, Dick, commanded the ill-fated
spacecraft, said she, too, would not go to Cape Canaveral, Fla.,
for the launch.
   Some of the families have not even decided whether they will
watch on TV, said Lisa Turner, a spokeswoman for the Challenger
Center, which was set up in memory of the crew.
   Mrs. Scobee said that ``like any other American citizen,'' she
is eager for a successful Discovery mission to get NASA's manned
spaceflight program back on track.
   ``NASA needs to focus on the launch facility, on the crew and
their families,'' she said in a telephone interview. ``For me to be
there would just remind everyone of that tragedy. And it would be
difficult for me, too.''
   Mrs. Scobee has not been back to Cape Canaveral since Jan. 28,
1986, when the Challenger exploded 73 seconds after launch.
   Mrs. Scobee said the Challenger tragedy changed forever the way
the Natonal Aeronautics and Space Administration goes about its
business.
   ``I really think they're launching a new era. There's a new
awareness of how vulnerable we are,'' Mrs. Scobee said.
   Since the accident, the Challenger families have avoided
discussions about their personal grief, and have focused their
efforts on establishing a memorial to their lost loved ones, she
said.
   Those efforts were rewarded last month with the opening of the
first Challenger Center for Space Science Education in Houston, a
place where children can learn about space.
   The center, at Houston's Museum of Natural Sciences, gives
students an opportunity to make a simulated spaceflight complete
with a mission control center and scientific experiments.
   It was paid for with a $150,000 grant and will serve as a
prototype for other small facilities associated with schools and
museums. Mrs. Scobee and the other Challenger relatives conceived
the center as a memorial to the crew and their educational mission.
   Besides Scobee and Jarvis, the Challenger astronauts were pilot
Michael Smith, Ellison Onizuka, Judith Resnik, Ronald McNair and
Christa McAuliffe, a Concord, N.H., high school teacher who was to
have conducted the first classroom experiments from space.
   The Challenger crew's families have made many appearances to
help raise money for the center and for other memorial events
honoring the astronauts.
   Three of the widows, Jane Smith, Lorna Onizuka and Cheryl
McNair, still live in the Houston area.
   Mrs. Scobee lived in the same area until April, when she moved
close to Washington, D.C.
   Marcia Jarvis still lives in Hermosa Beach, Calif. Ms. Resnik
was not married, but her brother, Dr. Charles Resnik of Baltimore,
has been active in the Challenger Center efforts.
   Steven McAuliffe continues to practice law in Concord, where he
can be seen around town with his two children. McAuliffe avoids
publicity concerning his wife, and his law firm would not comment
on his plans for the Discovery launch.

Winner Emerged</HEAD>

   Political partisans heaped on the hyperbole in the aftermath of
the presidential candidates' debate, but independent observers said
neither nominee delivered the zinger that could change the face of
their race.
   Who won? ``Who knows. This is a media event. This is
entertainment,'' said Jerry Calvert, political science chairman at
Montana State University. ``Both of the men scored well with the
people who are already supporting them.''
   Politicians promptly backed Calvert up: Republicans declared
George Bush the clear victor of Sunday's 90-minute confrontation at
Wake Forest University, while Democrats unabashedly designated
Michael Dukakis the champion.
   ``I believe Dukakis not only won the debate but the election
tonight,'' said Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif.
   ``Bush really laid him out,'' said Sen. Orrin G. Hatch,
Republican of Utah.
   Professional analysts were more reluctant to pick a winner, and
even some elected officials were equivocal. ``Neither guy won,''
said Republican Gov. James Thompson of Illinois, ``and neither guy
lost.''
   ``There was no knockout here,'' said political commentator David
Gergen, former communications director for President Reagan. ``I
thought Bush picked up points on policy issues. I thought Dukakis
was smoother on presentation and reached out effectively to the
middle class.''
   On balance, Gergen said, Bush appeared to succeed in further
delineating his ideological differences with Dukakis, while the
Democrat scored with economically struggling voters. ``I don't
think this will swing it,'' he said. ``I do think this will make it
a more competitive race.''
   Many Republicans put greater emphasis on the ideological issue,
saying Bush succeeded in portraying Dukakis as too liberal for most
voters.
   ``George Bush had a mission and he can say mission
accomplished,'' said Sen. Bob Dole, R-Kan., who lost the GOP
nomination to Bush. ``He documented again and again that Mike
Dukakis is a Ted Kennedy Massachusetts liberal _ and that means
someone who's out of step with mainstream America.''
   Democrats, however, took the position that their nominee had
widened his appeal. ``Dukakis won decisively in terms of picking up
political support. He came across as assured, confident and clear
on the facts,'' said Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri, who lost
his party's nomination to Dukakis.
   Bush, Gephardt said, ``seemed befuddled and confused.''
   But Culpepper Clark, a University of Alabama professor who
studies speeches, scored five topics for Bush, four for Dukakis and
three a tie. ``If you believe that Dukakis had to score some kind
of knockout or create some kind of major error on the part of the
vice president, it did not occur,'' he said.
   Some viewers considered style rather than issues. Psychologist
Joyce Brothers rated the candidates on everything from using their
hands for emphasis _ advantage Dukakis _ to appearing relaxed, a
score for Bush.
   ``Dukakis did much better when the camera caught him
accidentally. He is the master of the ironic smile,'' she said.
``Bush was caught making notes, like a professor. That's a minus.
But Bush is the better master of the pause.''
   Lillian Glass, a speech consultant who is author of ``Talk to
Win,'' said Dukakis ``came across a lot weaker than Bush.''
   ``Bush looks presidential, but he needs to hold his head up
straighter,'' she said. ``He made impressive recovery when he made
an error. It made a big difference for him to drop his voice. The
wimp factor is finally gone.''
   There were complaints from some quarters about the coaching
undergone by both participants. ``Both candidates were pretty well
programmed,'' said Sen. J. Bennett Johnston Jr., D-La. ``We saw a
little window into the candidates tonight, but not enough.''
   ``Both gave somewhat canned responses,'' agreed a Republican
Louisianan, Rep. Jim McCrery.
   As a result, not all observers were thrilled by the
performances. Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., called the debate
``pretty mundane,'' and to Democrat Willie Brown, speaker of the
California Assembly, ``It was rather boring.''
   Others drew more dramatic evaluations:
   _Sen. Robert Byrd of West Virginia, the Democratic leader in the
Senate: ``Tonight we saw a leader emerge and it was Michael
Dukakis.''
   _Republican Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas: ``I believe George Bush
did what he had to do to win the election. He came across as being
more of a leader and more of a real person.''
   _Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y.: ``Dukakis had to do well, and I
think this will clearly be the opportunity Michael Dukakis lost.
The vice president has fended him off.''
   _Gov. Mario Cuomo of New York: ``Governor Dukakis clearly
advanced his campaign dramatically. He appeared knowledgeable,
decisive, cool, presidential. He won.''
   _Pat Robertson, the television evangelist who ran against Bush
for the Republican nomination for president: ``On the important
issues of taxation, strong defense and law and order, George Bush
was a clear winner.''
   _Ira Glasser, president of the American Civil Liberties Union,
of which Dukakis is a member: Bush's criticism of the ACLU during
the debate was ``a descent into mudslinging of a kind we have not
seen in my lifetime.''

on separate drunken driving charges.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>AUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soul singer James Brown is in trouble with
the law again.
   Brown faced numerous charges, including assault and battery with
intent to kill, after leading police on a chase that began Augusta,
ran into South Carolina and back into Georgia, authorities said.
   ``The Godfather of Soul'' was released after posting a total of
$25,298 in bonds in both states late Saturday.
   He was arrested again on Sunday, less than 10 hours later, this
time on a drunken driving charge, police said.
   Brown was released on $1,219 bond after being charged with
driving under the influence, driving while his license was
suspended and improper movement on the roadway, said Augusta police
Sgt. C.V. Huffman.
   In the earlier encounter with the law, a half-hour chase ended
when police shot out the tires on Brown's pickup truck. He drove
six miles on wheel rims before winding up in a ditch, police said.
   The incident began when Brown, 55, walked into an insurance
seminar Saturday armed with a shotgun and a pistol, ordered
everyone to leave the room and ``escorted'' some women outside to
lock the restrooms, police said.
   During the chase, Brown tried to ram police cars with his pickup
truck, said Sgt. Frank Tiller of the Richmond County Sheriff's
Department.
   Brown's wife, Adrienne, said the singer is on medication for jaw
surgery. ``He's in pain. ... He's not in his right mind,'' she said.
   On July 21, Brown was sentenced to 2{ years of suspended jail
time, fined $1,200 and placed on probation until he performs a
benefit concert after pleading no contest to possession of the drug
PCP and guilty to a charge of resisting arrest and a weapons charge.

<BYLINE>But Did It Play in Peoria?
^By BILL VOGRIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PEORIA, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here's how Bush vs. Dukakis played in Peoria:
   George Bush scored big for his position on drugs, his vice
presidential experience and desire to return to ``fundamental
values.''
   Michael Dukakis won points for his criticism of U.S. dealings
with ``drug-running Panamanian dictators,'' international
terrorists and advocacy of programs for America's homeless.
   One hundred voters _ selected at random _ took part in an
instantaneous electronic survey of their reactions as they watched
Dukakis and Bush debate on television Sunday night.
   ``It's clear from the audience here that neither candidate hit a
home run with their remarks,'' said Bill Adams, a professor at
George Washington University who coordinated the opinion survey
experiment for a Washington, D.C., research firm.
   The group was assembled at a Peoria hotel and hooked to
computers through an electronic monitoring system that allowed
minute-by-minute monitoring of their opinions.
   Adams said the Peoria area was chosen for the audience survey
because Illinois is a pivotal state in the election.
   Before the debate, the group included 33 people leaning toward
Bush, 41 leaning toward Dukakis and 26 undecided.
   After the debate, 36 said they were leaning toward Bush, 45 were
leaning toward Dukakis and 19 were undecided.
   The debate reaffirmed Mary Herman's impressions of Bush.
   ``He's more personable and I think he has a better sense of
values,'' said Ms. Herman, 69, of East Peoria. ``I don't care for
Mr. Dukakis' ideas. He's too liberal.''
   ``To me, quite honestly, he seems to be more for the average
person,'' said Patty Impinto, 43, of Peoria, referring to Dukakis.
She said the debate changed her preference from Bush to Dukakis.
   ``Both candidates made gains,'' said Christopher Wheeler, who
developed the electronic system used to gauge the audience
response. ``Each man pulled a segment of the undecided voters into
their corners. Nobody lost any ground.''
   Women generally responded more strongly to Dukakis.
   ``It demonstrated vividly the gender gap,'' Adams said. ``The
men in our audience were resonating to Bush. More dramatically, the
women were responding much more positively to Dukakis. It was
highly significant, statistically.''
   ``I was also struck by the phenomenal lack of response to the
Dan Quayle issue,'' Adams said. ``I interpreted that to mean a lot
of them are withholding judgment until the vice presidential
debate.''

<HEAD>Bishops Call For Disarming Tonton Macoutes, Purging Government</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL NORTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Taking a tough new stand, Haiti's
Catholic bishops have advocated disarming the ruthless private army
of the Duvalier regime and banning the dictatorship's collaborators
from civil service.
   ``We insist on this justice to break the hellish circle of hate
and vengeance,'' the 10-member Bishop's council said Sunday in its
first reaction to the week-old soldier's rebellion.
   In an unsually strong statement broadcast by Radio Soleil church
radio, the bishops addressed ``a solemn appeal to all Haitians to
take seriously this moment which, led according to the principles
of the Gospel and the social teachings of the church, can lead to a
veritable liberation.''
   The bishops said the people wanted a change in the system when,
through massive demonstrations, they forced Jean-Claude Duvalier to
flee to France in February 1986, ending his family's 29-year
dictatorship.
   Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy then became de facto ruler of Haiti until
Sept. 17, when he was ousted by enlisted men of the Presidential
Guard and replaced by Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril, a longtime Duvalier
collaborator.
   Much of the recent violence in Haiti targeting civilian
opponents of Namphy's authoritarian rule was carried out by thugs
who at one time belonged to the Tonton Macoutes, the dreaded
private militia of the Duvalier regime.
   The rebels have ousted military commanders who tolerated the
violence and there have been reprisal killings of people associated
with the Macoutes.
   In their statement, the bishops called for ``a policy of
elimination of Macoutism and a plan for the salvage of the nation.''
   ``This policy entails the general disarming of Macoutes and the
exclusion from the civil service of all those who in one way or
another actively contributed to the consolidation and perpetuation
of the dictatorial system during the last 30 years,'' the bishops
said.
   It was not immediately clear whether the bishops were including
Avril in their refernce to Duvalier collaborators. Avril was a
financial adviser and close friend of Duvalier and also served
under the dictator's father, Francois ``Papa Doc'' Duvalier.
   The bishops called for the creation of an impartial judiciary
and urged unspecified ``international organizations'' to increase
assistance to this impoverished Caribbean nation.
   The United States, France and Canada cut off aid after thugs
attacked and killed at least 34 voters in thwarting November 1987
balloting that would have been Haiti's first free elections in 30
years.
   The church has always exerted a strong influence over the
Haitian populace, which is 90 percent Roman Catholic and was a
crucial supporter of the demonstrations that led to the end of
Duvalier rule.
   Laennec Hurbon, a sociologist and author of books on Haitian
culture, called the bishops' statement ``a break with the past
policies of the church.''
   Hurbon, who is affiliated with the National Science Research
Center in Paris, said the bishops recognized that national
reconciliation is not possible unlces Macoutism is eradicated.
   Some 3,000 Roman Catholics, meanwhile, spilled out of the
auditorium of the St. Gerard Church on Sunday for a service to
mourn victims of a Sept. 11 massacre at the nearby St. Jean Bosco
Church and to celebrate the military uprising.
   The Rev. Antonio Sele referred in a sermon to the rank-and-file
troops who led the coup as ``our soldiers'' and denounced the
slaughter that left 13 people dead and more than 70 wounded at St.
Jean Bosco's.
   After the Mass, about 1,500 people, including 150 survivors of
the massacre, marched more than seven miles to a suburban church
school, where they were greeted by the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide,
pastor of St. Jean Bosco's.
   It was Aristide's first public appearance since escaping the
massacre.
   ``God is with us. We don't lose courage. The cleaning up has
just begun,'' he said in a barely audible voice as the throng
erupted in cheers. Two women shouted, ``He's alive, he's alive.''
   Aristide, a frequent target of assassination by the Macoutes,
was an outspoken critic of the Namphy government.

   Concern over the health of ailing Emperor Hirohito
dampened trading today on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, while the
dollar firmed against the Japanese yen.
   The 225-share Nikkei Stock Average gyrated through the day over
concern for Hirohito, whose condition appeared to stabilize today
after setbacks over the weekend.
   The Nikkei lost 59.17 points, or 0.22 percent, to close at
27,330.95 in dull trading. Volume on the first section was a light
550 million shares.
   Traders said investors were reluctant to take large positions
because of fears the market might close temporarily upon Hirohito's
passing, leaving them unable to respond to financial markets
overseas.
   In addition, many traders cited the psychological impact of
uncertainty over the health of any major world figure. Hirohito has
reigned for nearly 62 years.
   Monday was also the last day Japanese brokerages could trade on
their accounts for the fiscal year ending Sept. 30, when most
companies close their books.
   On the Tokyo foreign exchange market, the dollar closed at
134.73 yen, up 0.26 yen from Thursday's close, the last day of
trading. It opened at 134.80 yen and moved in a narrow range of
134.66-134.85 yen.
   Dealers attributed the dollar's strength to a reaffirmation over
the weekend among monetary authorities from seven major countries.
The Group of Seven met in West Berlin and decided to continue to
coordinate economic policies targeting stable exchange rates and
containing inflation.
   ``Following the outcome of the G-7 meeting, the market took it
as an indication there will be no market intervention by the
nation's central bank at the current exchange rate level,'' said a
dealer at a major commercial bank in Tokyo, speaking anonymously.

<HEAD>More Than 100 Million Africans Reported Undernourished</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 100 million Africans, or one in four, do
not get enough food to fuel an active working life, and the
situation is getting worse, a new World Bank report says.
   ``In the 1980s ... both the proportion and the total number of
Africans with deficient diets have climbed _ and will continue to
rise unless special action is taken,'' the study says.
   Edward V. K. Jaycox, the bank's vice president for Africa,
released the report Sunday. He told a news conference that
production of food grains on the continent has been declining for
two decades.
   The study says 103.7 million Africans are among the ``food
insecure'' _ those who do not get the minimum of 2,200 calories a
day that people need to be able to work.
   It lists communist Ethiopia, buffeted by wars and drought, as
having the largest number: 14.7 million, or nearly half its
population. Ethiopia is followed by Nigeria with 13.7 million and
Zaire with 12 million. Both countries have close ties to the United
States.
   Chad, Somalia, Zambia and Mozambique have higher percentages of
food insecure, but their population is smaller. Egypt is the best
off among the 36 countries listed, with only 4 percent of its
population, about 1.7 million, in the category.
   In some places food may be scarce, but more often people just do
not have the money to buy it, said Jaycox.
   Ethiopia is the poorest country on the World Bank's list, with
average income estimated at $120 a year, less than 35 cents a day.
   The report calls for action so that within five years, half to
two-thirds of the countries south of the Sahara will have carried
out programs to cover a majority of the region's most needy.
   But Jaycox said it would be futile to propose anything so
specific as abolishing hunger ``by the year X.''
   He said billions of dollars have been spent on aid for Africa,
but the programs have not worked well. He said many solutions do
not need new aid money.
   One of those is for African governments to pay higher prices to
African farmers, he said. He said the bank had completed
negotiations with Ethiopia that will give farmers more incentives
and reduce state confiscation of crops, which he said started
before the present government took power.
   But food security does not mean that every African country
should grow all its own food, he said.
   ``If a farmer in the Ivory Coast makes $8 a day growing cotton,
which nobody can eat, there's no point in his growing maize at $2 a
day,'' he said.
   Jaycox said some African governments pay their own farmers too
little, which discourages them from producing. The governments then
buy food from abroad and subsidize its sale in the towns.
   He said these policies are worse than the policies of wealthier
countries in America and Europe where governments sell their
surplus food cheap to benefit their own farmers at the expense of
the taxpayer.
   Jaycox said the African policies encourage people to shift to
rice and wheat, which are uneconomical to grow in Africa, away from
the sorghum and maize that their farmers traditionally have raised.

   Matthew F. Wilson has been named managing
editor of the San Francisco Chronicle, the newspaper said in
today's editions.
   Wilson's promotion from his position as special assistant to the
executive editor was effective today.
   As special assistant, he played a major role in the expansion
and redesign of the newspaper's news and feature sections last year.
   Wilson, a 32-year-old native of San Francisco and graduate of
the University of California-Berkeley, began his career at the
Chronicle in 1975 as a copy boy. He became a copy editor in June
1978.
   Wilson helped direct installation of the newspaper's
computerized editing system in 1982 and 1983. He has since been
involved in seminars on technology issues for the American Society
of Newspaper Editors and The Associated Press Managing Editors
Association.
   Wilson's father, Kenneth E. Wilson, was managing editor of the
Santa Rosa Press Democrat and is the Chronicle's assistant to the
publisher for systems.

   The political skeletons were out of the closet
long before Halloween here in the congressional race between
Republican Rep. Pat Swindall and Democratic nominee Ben Jones.
   The congressman, with hidden tape recorders running, discussed
financing his million-dollar home with laundered drug money.
   And Jones, who appeared on the television series ``The Dukes of
Hazzard,'' admits to ``wild'' drunken behavior and a conviction for
assaulting his wife.
   Swindall asked for forgiveness, Jones for understanding. Neither
has much for the other.
   ``He beat his wife,'' Swindall, 47, said at one point,
elaborating at a debate that it was ``your second of four wives.''
   ``Being called dishonest by you is like being called ugly by a
possum,'' said Jones, 46, of Swindall's charge that he changed his
story about his criminal record.
   ``I'll have to say it's the most bitter personal attacks I've
seen in Georgia politics in 35 or 40 years,'' said the secretary of
the Georgia Senate, Hamilton McWhorter.
   Atlanta pollster Claibourne Darden called it ``a contest between
two dirty candidates.''
   Jones blundered by failing to let Swindall simply be haunted by
the house issue, Darden said. Instead, Jones reacted angrily when
Swindall grabbed headlines the night Jones won the Democratic
primary by demanding to see Jones' arrest record. Jones suggested
both take a drug test.
   There have been no drug tests, but the ensuing argument gave
Swindall a chance to swear he had never used drugs and forced Jones
to admit he smoked marijuana in the 1970s.
   McWhorter said he thinks Jones still holds the edge, although
Swindall should benefit from being on the ballot with Vice
President George Bush in the Republican-leaning district, made up
mostly of east Atlanta suburbs.
   Swindall and Jones first squared off in 1986, with Swindall
winning election to his second two-year term. But Jones' 47 percent
showing was a surprise for a candidate who began the race with less
name recognition than Cooter, the character he played on television.
   Jones said at the outset that he was an alcoholic who was
frequently in trouble until he kicked the bottle in 1977.
   In the current race, he said the trouble included an incident in
which he shoved his wife in a bar. Jones said he was convicted of a
misdemeanor assault charge, but originally forgot the outcome.
   He made Swindall's house an issue in the first race, suggesting
Swindall was getting a sweetheart deal from a politically
conservative contractor.
   But the price of the house grew to $1.2 million, and Swindall
last year turned to Charles LeChasney for help in financing it.
   When LeChasney was indicted for money laundering, Swindall
acknowledged he once accepted a $150,000 check from LeChasney. He
said he returned it uncashed because he became suspicious.
   The matter became the campaign's commanding issue when
recordings of Swindall's conversations with LeChasney and a shady
financier _ who turned out to be an undercover Internal Revenue
Service agent _ were leaked in June.
   ``I can only draw the conclusion that certainly there are drugs
involved and I can understand if you want to walk away,'' the agent
told Swindall in a tape-recorded meeting Sept. 13, 1987.
   ``I'd say this: first and foremost it becomes Charles'
problem,'' Swindall answered. ``What I have to say is I borrowed
money from (LeChasney's company),'' he added.
   ``And frankly I don't think it's incumbent upon me to go out and
find out where XYZ Corp. gets their money,'' he said in the
recording.
   Swindall said he had made an error in judgment and asked for
forgiveness.
   Jones said the tapes proved Swindall's dishonesty. But he now
says he wants to quit talking about personal issues, saying he
``overreacted'' by suggesting the drug tests and now wants to focus
on national issues.
   ``I have sinned, Pat, and so have you,'' he said at a debate.

<HEAD>In Remembering Babi Yar Slaughter, Jews Also Attack Soviet Policy</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   In an officially sanctioned event unthinkable
before the era of glasnost, hundreds of people gathered at a Moscow
cemetery to remember more than 100,000 people, mostly Jews,
massacred by the Nazis at a ravine near Kiev.
   And some directed their anger not at the Germans but at the
Soviet government for its repression of Jews.
   ``Babi Yar was a prelude to the spiritual genocide of the Jewish
people of our country,'' Yuri Sokol, a World War II veteran, told
at least 500 people huddled Sunday on a road outside the gates of
Moscow's Vostryakov Cemetery.
   A few years ago, police would have broken up such a
demonstration as an anti-Soviet outpouring of nationalism. But in a
product of Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy of glasnost,
or openness, only a few policemen were on hand and did not
interfere.
   Standing alongside Jewish activists atop a makeshift speakers
platform on a truck were a prominent Jewish Soviet army general,
the head of the Soviet Anti-Zionist Committee and members of
parliament.
   The rally, which lasted 1{ hours, was called by the official
Anti-Zionist Committee, which includes Soviet Jews who oppose
Israel, and by the unofficial Society for Friendship and Relations
with Israel.
   It was the second year that authorities gave permission for a
Babi Yar memorial rally in Moscow, but the first in which a state
organization was a co-sponsor.
   In a sign of official sanction, the Moscow Communist Party and
government newspaper Evening Moscow ran an announcement of the
ceremony on Thursday, and the state-run Tass news agency carried a
dispatch after the demonstration.
   ``You must agree that some democracy exists because 10 years ago
you couldn't have met here,'' William Perry of New York told the
crowd in a mixture of Yiddish and English. Perry is president of
the International Union of Industrial, Service, Transport and
Health Employees.
   The rally marked the 47th anniversary of the killing of more
than 100,000 people, mainly Jews, at Babi Yar in the Ukrainian
capital. Speakers said that shortly after occupying Kiev, the Nazis
rounded up and shot to death 35,000 Jews on Sept. 29-30, 1941.
   Pictures of women and children concentration camp prisoners,
people hanging from gallows and piles of corpses were nailed onto
the side of the truck. A Moscow rabbi led the crowd, assembled on
the first night of the Jewish holiday Sukkot, in a Hebrew prayer of
mourning for the massacre victims.
   Several speakers reminded the crowd that the suffering and
repression of Jews did not end when the Nazis were defeated.
   ``After the war, members of the Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee
were shot, there was the `Doctors Plot' and they wanted to deport
the Jews to Siberia,'' said Valery Sherbaum, secretary of the
friendship society.
   Dictator Josef Stalin accused some of the country's top
physicians, most Jewish, of being spies and trying to kill Kremlin
leaders. He had them arrested in 1953.
   Sherbaum said repression of Jews did not stop after Stalin died
that year.
   Even under Gorbachev, Jewish cemeteries have been destroyed in
several Soviet cities, Jews are not permitted to organize classes
to study Hebrew or Yiddish and unsanctioned Jewish organizations
are denied meeting places, he told the crowd.
   Yuli Kosharovsky, a Jew refused permission to emigrate, said the
government still publishes anti-Semitic and anti-Zionist literature.
   Other speakers charged that the Pamyat organization, an
unofficial Russian political group that has sprung up under
glasnost, was reviving the anti-Semitism symbolized by the Babi Yar
massacre through its racist ultra-nationalist views.
   For years, authorities arrested and harrassed Jews agitating for
preservation of Babi Yar as a symbol of the Holocaust.
   After poet Yevgeny Yevtushenko wrote a poem about the massacre
deploring the lack of a memorial, authorities relented and a
monument was erected in 1976 on the swampy ravine.
   But many Jews have remained unsatisfied because the monument's
plaque does not mention that most victims were Jews.
   Among those at Sunday's rally sharing that view was a member of
the first Israeli diplomatic delegation to visit the Soviet Union
since the Kremlin severed ties with the Jewish state in 1967.
   ``It's very painful that there is not one word mentioning that
Jews were killed there,'' said Gershon Gorev, who attended the
ceremony with his wife Hasia and Yaakov Kedmi, another member of
the six-member Israeli team that arrived in Moscow July 28.

<DATELINE>YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK, Wyo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As Yellowstone National
Park superintendent, Bob Barbee has endured a political, emotional
and ecological firestorm.
   Because of the summer blaze that ravaged much of the oldest
national park, his once-bright future seems as cloudy as the pall
of smoke over Yellowstone, where fires continue to smolder.
   A 30-year National Park Service veteran who rose through the
ranks, the 52-year-old Barbee holds a highly visible, prestigious
post.
   In June, he played host to park service Director William Penn
Mott, a score of dignitaries and nearly 400 of his peers and
others, as he presided over the first general superintendents'
conference in 12 years.
   During the four-day meeting, gossip buzzed that if the next
president looked toward the career ranks for his new director,
Barbee had a strong chance of heading the National Park Service.
   But that preceded three months of flames and political flak,
insults and cartoon caricatures.
   ``I have the best job in the world,'' Barbee said in an
interview, using his standard line since he became overseer of the
2.2 million-acre park in 1983.
   But in a season of drought and flames around the West, it is
almost a throwaway line, a touch of bravado wedged between a
defense of park policies and a recitation of climatological
conditions that surprised his seasoned scientists.
   At the center of the controversy is the park service's policy of
allowing naturally caused fires to burn as long as they don't
threaten life, property or historic sites.
   ``By anybody's reckoning these fires are a catastrophe because
of the impact and the anguish they caused,'' Barbee said.
   ``One million acres burned, threats to communities, power lines
burning down, millions and millions of dollars being spent ... No
one would promote something like that, for heaven's sake.
   ``But the Catch-22 ... is that if we say `Look it, there's
another side to this,' that statement is confused with a
celebration of the fire and its impact.
   ``Yellowstone Park is still all here. There will be a changed
face to Yellowstone, but not a devastated face, not a destroyed
face _ that's just folly, that's myth. What there will be is just a
different face. This event provides a great educational opportunity
to see what a powerful force like fire can do, and how the land
responds to it.''
   Some of the physical strain of 20-hour days, no time off in
months and unceasing criticism of park service policies shows in
Barbee's set jaw and grim tone.
   He has become the focus for much of the anger and frustration
stemming from the fires. Barbee says such a reaction has left him
``dismayed but not necessarily surprised ... I don't like it.''
   Interior Secretary Donald P. Hodel has called the firefighting
policy a ``disaster.''
   Wyoming Sens. Alan Simpson and Malcolm Wallop, both Republicans,
have attacked the ``let-it-burn'' policy, with Wallop suggesting
Mott should be fired.
   Sen. John Melcher, D-Mont., has called for congressional
oversight hearings about the origins of the fires and the way they
were fought.
   No one knows better than Barbee that he's become the butt of
jokes in the communities that ring the park and depend on it for
economic survival.
   ``Did you hear that Bob Barbee had a fire in his kitchen?'' goes
one such joke. ``No, how did he put it out?
   ``He started a backfire in the living room.''
   ``What are the fires in Yellowstone Park called?'' begins
another. ``Why, they're called Bar-bee-ques.''
   And then there are the newspaper cartoons depicting drooping
bears with singed fur and a caption identifying them as ``Barbee
Dolls.''
   Barbee has stressed repeatedly that he did not make day-to-day
firefighting decisions, but added, ``I clearly, because I am
sitting here, am responsible, and I accept that.''
   And he expects the controversy the blazes have ignited to
continue for months to come.
   ``Yellowstone draws fire because it is the `Mother Park,' it has
a symbolic aura about it,'' Barbee said. ``We who care for it have
a sort of sacred charge. People here take it seriously, and they
don't like being maligned for not taking it seriously.''

   Tokyo and surrounding areas shook for almost half a
minute today as a strong earthquake struck east of the capital.
Police said there were no immediate signs of serious injuries or
damage.
   Central Meteorological Agency officials said the temblor hit at
5:23 p.m. (4:23 a.m. EDT) and registered a preliminary 5.9 on the
Richter scale. An earthquake measuring 6.0 on the scale is
considered severe and capable of widespread damage near its center.
   ``We felt it very strongly. It lasted about 20 seconds, but
there haven't been any reports of injuries,'' said a police officer
in Choshi in Tokyo's neighboring Chiba prefecture. He spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   The meteorological agency said the earthquake's center was
located off the eastern coast of Chiba about 30 miles below the
seabed.
   The agency said the quake registered four in Choshi on the
Japanese earthquake scale _ intense enough to shake buildings
strongly and overturn unstable objects. It measured three in Tokyo,
Chiba City and Mito on the scale, which has a maximum reading of
seven and measures ground motion at particular locations.
   In contrast, the open-ended Richter scale measures the total
magnitude of an earthquake, and is not convertible to the Japanese
scale.

   South Carolina's first black United
Methodist bishop says his installation in the post tells blacks in
the state ``they are part of the church.''
   The Rev. Joseph Bethea, 56, was installed Sunday as leader of
the state's 244,000 United Methodists in 1,080 churches at a packed
service at Washington Street United Methodist Church. Many of the
worshipers came from black congregations.
   At a news conference, Bethea said his new position ``speaks a
very relevant and needed word to ... the black United Methodists in
South Carolina. It says ... they are part of the church; they have
ownership of the church.
   ``I would hope all United Methodists in South Carolina will have
a new sense of healing and wholeness as a result of my assignment
as episcopal leader I hope I have some skills and graces that can
serve all the people.''
   Before his election as bishop Sept. 1, Bethea was superintendent
of the Raleigh (N.C.) District. Bethea is a graduate of Claflin
College in Orangeburg.

<HEAD>Burma's Ruling Party Changes Its Name</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SEIN WIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RANGOON, Burma (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The military-dominated political party
that has ruled Burma for a quarter century gave itself a new name
today in what one diplomat described as an attempt to change the
party's tarnished image.
   State-run Radio Rangoon announced that the Burma Socialist
Program Party is now the National Unity Party.
   It did not give an explanation for the change, but a Western
diplomat in Bangkok, Thailand, described the move as an attempt
``to change their image (and) make a break with the past.''
   In recent months, millions of people have engaged in street
demonstrations, strikes and other acts of opposition to the party
and the 26 years of political repression and economic decline
associated with it.
   Military commander Gen. Saw Maung led a coup Sept. 19 that
diplomats say apparently has re-established effective control over
the country by the ruling clique. Soldiers have driven protesters
from Rangoon's streets and broken up protest centers in dozens of
towns nationwide.
   The government says security forces have killed more than 250
civilians, mostly people described as looters, since the coup.
Diplomats believe more have died, including many unarmed
demonstrators who marched the day after the coup.
   In the latest incidents reported by Radio Rangoon, security
forces shot and killed 12 people Sunday in looting incidents as
lawlessness persisted a week after Saw Maung took over.
   The radio said five people also were wounded and 16 arrested in
five incidents in the capital in which looters were trying to steal
rice, gasoline and corrugated iron sheets.
   In the bloodiest incident, security forces shot and killed seven
people who were among a crowd of 100 looters Sunday night at the
state-owned Five Star Shipping Line near Rangoon River, the radio
said.
   It said two others were killed when security forces dispersed a
mob of 1,000 people looting a government rice warehouse, and three
died while looting another government warehouse.
   The main anti-government activity currently is a general strike
that began Aug. 8 and has paralyzed the government administration.
Authorities have ordered civil servants back to work by Oct. 3.
   Saw Maung has pledged to hold multiparty elections once peace is
restored to the impoverished nation, but he has set no timetable.
The last such elections were in held in 1960, two years before
leader Ne Win seized power in a military coup.
   Three key opposition leaders _ Aung Gyi, Tin Oo and Aung San Suu
Kyi _ on Saturday formed an umbrella group to unite the millions of
students, Buddhist monks, government workers and others struggling
for democracy.
   Although the opposition has not formally responded to Saw
Maung's plan for elections, it earlier opposed a snap election
because said the ruling autocracy could not be trusted to hold fair
and free balloting.
   Opposition leaders also said such elections would have been
unfair because the longstanding ban on political parties other than
the ruling party was only recently lifted. They have urged
formation of a non-partisan interim government to conduct the
elections.
   The government earlier this month ordered civil servants and all
military personnel to resign from the ruling party and repealed the
law authorizing financial support to the party from the government.
   But the party, which had 2.5 million members before the unrest
and susequent resignations, remains a potent force with offices
throughout this nation of 38 million people.
   The party has been the personal fiefdom of 77-year-old Ne Win,
who led Burma into isolation during his 26 years of rule and made
the resource-rich nation one of the world's poorest countries.
   Current leader Saw Maung is believed to have strong links to Ne
Win.
   Government news releases first issued last week said Burma's
official name was changed back to what it was before 1962 _ from
the ``Socialist Republic of the Union of Burma'' to the ``Union of
Burma.''

   Millions of red and grey locusts darkened
the sky over Khartoum for 90 minutes this morning, some landing on
cultivated fields along the Nile River to devour the crops.
   Huge swarms of the insects began arriving about 7:30 a.m. and
left at about 9 a.m. The sun was completely covered for almost half
an hour of the 1{-hour period.
   Officials had no immediate estimate of the size of the swarm,
which came in from the east and moved in a westerly direction, or
the amount of damage it left behind.
   Torrential rains caused disastrous flooding in Khartoum last
month, and experts said the greening of normally barren desert
areas created perfect breeding grounds for locusts.
   Earlier this month, Agriculture Minister el-Fatih el-Tigani said
Sudan's locust threat had entered ''a critical stage.''
   He said that the government had destroyed half of about 60
potential swarms in the country but that Sudan lacked sufficient
insecticides or equipment to spray all agriclutural lands facing an
invasion.
   Swarms are known to be mainly in eastern and western Sudan.
Khartoum lies at the center of the country.
   Officials fear that locusts could leave behind more devastation
than last month's flooding, which caused damage estimated at $330
million or more.

   Vandals defaced a museum honoring the Rev.
Junipero Serra with such spray-painted slogans as ``Genocidal
Maniac'' for his alleged mistreatment of Indians as others
protested at the 18th century monk's grave.
   The graffiti marred ceremonies Sunday at Presidio Park honoring
Serra, the Spanish priest revered as the founder of California's
missions, on the day he was beatified by Pope John Paul II in the
Vatican City.
   Vandals spray-painted slogans including ``Murderous Lying Scum''
and ``Serra was a Baby Killer'' on the doors and sides of the Serra
Museum and other walls and memorials in the 40-acre park.
   In the northern California town of Carmel, about 20 Indians held
a protest prayer vigil at Serra's grave Sunday.
   ``We want to show we're against this because of the brutality
that occurred when Father Serra had control of the missions,'' said
Anthony Miranda, chairman of the Costanoan band of local Indians.
   Carrying an abalone shell filled with burning sage, a variety of
feathers and shell ornaments and a dried gourd that was beat to
mark cadence, the Indians entered the Carmel Mission between
morning Masses.
   One of about 200 parishioners inside yelled, ``Take your pagan
rites out of the church.''
   When the prayer was finished, the protesters left the church and
resumed a demonstration at the gates of the mission. Several were
weeping.
   Museum officials here said the graffiti, which colored a bronze
likeness of Serra, a bronze statue of an Indian and a 50-foot stone
cross, will cost hundreds of dollars to repair.
   ``It's a shame that they chose this method of protesting. That
sort of thing doesn't help anything and certainly is not going to
change the church's position,'' said Dan Pitre, spokesman for the
San Diego Roman Catholic Diocese.
   About 30 protestors who attended a rally later denied
involvement in the vandalism. Police said they had no suspects.
   The graffiti, including obscenities, attacked Serra for greed,
racism and anti-Semitism, as well as cruelty to Indians.
   Serra's critics say he whipped and enslaved the Indians he
worked to convert, stole their lands, and exposed them to European
diseases to which they had no resistance.
   ``He shouldn't be honored,'' said protestor Kip King, an Indian
descendant. ``Serra had the arrogance of any missionary effort of
coming to a people that already had a religion and trying to impose
their European religion.''
   In ceremonies moving Serra toward sainthood, John Paul called
the Franciscan monk, ``a shining example of Christian virtue and
the missionary spirit.''
   Built in 1769, the San Diego mission was the first in a series
of missions along the California coast whose construction was
organized by Serra.
   ``It saddens and angers me,'' Eleanor Neely, education
coordinator for the Serra museum, said of the graffiti. ``There's
no proof whatsoever that Serra mistreated anyone.''
   A group of nine historians that investigated the issue for the
Catholic Church last year reported that Indians were abused in the
missions but found no evidence to support charges against Serra
himself.

   An 18th century monk who founded
California's first missions and a priest executed by a firing squad
in Mexico in 1927 moved a step closer to sainthood when they were
beatified by Pope John Paul II.
   The monk beatified Sunday, the Rev. Junipero Serra, founded nine
missions in what is now California. But critics say he whipped and
enslaved the very native Americans he worked to convert.
   In California, demonstrations were held against the Franciscan's
beatification, including a protest by his graveside in Carmel and
the defacing of a museum in San Diego.
   Serra was one of six people the pope beatified during a
three-hour Mass in St. Peter's Square. In the Roman Catholic
Church, beatification is one step from possible sainthood.
   Some Indians claim Serra stole their lands, destroyed their
culture, forced their ancestors to work in fields or on
construction projects and exposed them to European diseases against
which they had no resistance.
   But John Paul, speaking in English, said Serra was ``a shining
example of Christian virtue and the missionary spirit.
   ``His great goal was to bring the Gospel to the native peoples
of America, so that they too might be `consecrated in the truth,'''
the pope said. ``It was a field of missionary endeavor that
required patience, perseverance and humility, as well as vision and
courage.''
   In Carmel on Sunday, about 20 Indians entered the chapel at the
Carmel mission between Masses and, standing in a semi-circle around
Serra's grave, prayed aloud for the souls of the 2,364 Indians
buried at the mission.
   ``We want to show we're against this because of the brutality
that occurred when Father Serra had control of the missions,'' said
Anthony Miranda, chairman of the Costanoan band of local Indians.
   In San Diego early Sunday, vandals defaced a museum honoring
Serra, marring ceremonies marking his day of beatification. They
spray-painted such slogans as ``Genocidal Maniac'' and ``Serra was
a Baby Killer'' on the doors and sides of the museum.
   Among those taking part in the Mass in Vatican City celebrated
before more than 20,000 people were 5-year-old AIDS sufferer
Brendan O'Rourke of San Francisco and Sister Ann Clare Johnson, a
30-year-old nun from Mission San Jose, Calif. who has incurable
cancer.
   Both have prayed that Serra's intercession will save their lives.
   Also beatified Sunday was the Rev. Miguel Agustin Pro, a Jesuit
priest shot by a Mexican firing squad 61 years ago. The only martyr
among the six beatified, he was killed at the height of the
conflict between the Catholic Church in Mexico and the
anti-clerical revolutionary government.
   Although he denied it, Pro was accused of taking part in a plot
to kill Mexican strongman Gen. Alvaro Obregon. He was executed
without trial on orders of President Plutarco Elias Calles.
   The pope praised Pro for organizing secret Masses and Communion
services in private homes during ``the years of persecution'' in
Mexico.
   Pro's beatification was seen as a condemnation of the regime
that executed him, one that still governs Mexico.
   The Mexican government made no official comment about the
beatification. A a leftist magazine, Proceso, called it ``a slap in
the face of the revolution.''
   Photographs show Pro kneeling in prayer, then standing before a
government firing squad clutching a rosary and a crucifix and
finally collapsing. Just before he died he shouted, ``Christ the
king lives.''
   Some believe Pro was killed because of his clandestine work
among labor unions and other working class groups in Mexico.
Critics contend he was more of a political activist than a priest.
   In Mexico on Sunday, church bells rang in Chihuahua to
commemorate the beatification and Mexicans packed Mexico City's
Basilica of Guadalupe, the country's most sacred shrine, for a
special Mass.
   Others beatified Sunday were Cardinal Giuseppe Benedetto Dusmet,
a 19th century Italian archbishop who devoted his life to the poor;
the Rev. Francesco Faa di Bruno, a 19th century Italian priest who
founded an order of nuns; the Rev. Frederic Janssoone Bollengier, a
French missionary in the Holy Land and Canada who died in 1916, and
Josefa Naval Girbes, a 19th century Spanish woman who dedicated her
life to God.

<HEAD>New Plan Could Lower Surgeons' Pay, Raise Internists'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The pay of some highly specialized surgeons will
drop sharply while internists and others on medicine's front lines
will earn more under a proposed new physician fee structure drawn
up for Congress, its author says.
   The results of the 2{-year project, called the resource-based
relative value scale, are to be published this week in the New
England Journal of Medicine and released by the federal Health Care
Financing Administration.
   Its chief architect, economist William C. Hsiao of the Harvard
School of Public Health, said the plan is intended to correct
``distorted and inequitable'' fees that pay doctors too little for
examining patients and too much for specific procedures and
operations.
   Hsiao's project attempts to determine the amount of work
involved in everything doctors do _ from checkups to brain surgery
_ so they can be paid what their services are worth.
   If accepted by Congress, which requested it, the plan will be
used to set the pay for doctors who treat elderly Medicare
patients. It may also be adopted by state-run Medicaid programs and
private insurance companies.
   ``In general, some of the primary-care specialties will rise,
and a few of the highly specialized surgical specialties may see a
sharp drop in fees for their services,'' Hsiao said in an
interview. ``But the impact will not be uniform. Some specialties
will not be affected very much.''
   Hsiao said that if adopted by government health agencies and
insurance companies, his 2,000-page plan could have a profound
effect on the nation's health care system. Among other things, it
could:
   _improve care by encouraging doctors to spend more time with
their patients.
   _lower medical costs by discouraging expensive tests, procedures
and operations.
   _increase the number of doctors willing to specialize in family
practice and other kinds of primary care.
   _lower the income of some surgical specialists while raising the
pay of physicians who provide general care to patients.
   ``This is going to be a very important piece of work that we
hope will rationalize the manner in which physicians are paid,''
said Dr. James Todd, senior deputy executive vice president of the
American Medical Association.
   Not all doctors would make the same pay under the system,
because some have more demanding jobs than others.
   ``An orthopedic surgeon, under this fee system, will be
justifiably making more than pediatricians,'' Hsiao said. ``They
will receive different levels of compensation according to their
level of work.''
   Hsiao declined to reveal specifics of his report until it is
formally published, but outlined some of the major conclusions and
described the effect he believes it could have on medicine.
   Traditionally, doctors have been paid relatively little for
seeing patients in their offices, monitoring them and writing
prescriptions. However, they are often highly paid for diagnostic
tests and such procedures as installing pacemakers.
   Hsiao's plan would narrow this gap. He believes that without a
strong financial incentive, doctors will do fewer questionable
procedures.
   ``There could be a change in the quality of patient care,'' he
said. ``Physicians will be willing to spend more time with patients
and treat them as a whole person.''

<HEAD>IMF Calls For Forceful Action to Help Third World Debtors</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SALLY JACOBSEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The International Monetary Fund said today that
more forceful action is needed to help heavily indebted Third World
countries.
   ``Many countries continue to face severe financing and
adjustment difficulties, which have become more severe due to the
recent increase in interest rates,'' said a statement issued by
finance ministers from 22 countries at the annual meeting of the
International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
   ``More forceful actions are needed in the context of the current
cooperative, case-by-case approach to resolve these difficulties,''
the statement said.
   Poor countries have been pressing for more help from
industrialized nations and bankers to ease their staggering debt
burdens.
   The panel urged debtor countries to continue making changes in
their economic policies to spur growth. It also urged banks ``to
provide adequate refinancing and not only rescheduling of
amortization payments.''
   Banks have been reluctant to lend the debtor nations more money
and have instead agreed in some cases to stretch out payment terms.
   The panel came out strongly against shifting to governments the
risks taken by commercial bankers in Third World lending.
   Because of doubt about the ability of debtors to repay, banks
holding the debt have to take sharp losses when they resell.
   The World Bank deals with the long-term development of Third
World countries. The fund was set up to handle shorter-term
problems.
   On Sunday, Brazil's Finance Minister Mailson Ferreira da Nobrega
told other finance chiefs that industrialized nations should launch
a ``direct attack'' on the economic troubles of developing
countries.
   ``It is clear that growth in industrial countries does not
trickle down to developing countries' economies,'' da Nobrega said.
   The debt of developing countries is one of the key topics at the
meeting, which began last week and will run through Thursday. Some
12,000 financial officials, bankers and journalists planned to
attend.
   Officials of the seven key industrialized nations have already
given final approval to a plan to help the world's poorest
countries, mostly in sub-Saharan Africa.
   But Latin America's large debtors would like more help with
their problems. Brazil owes $121 billion in foreign loans, making
it the developing world's No. 1 debtor. Mexico follows with about
$104 billion in debts.
   The United States and other major industrialized nations have
said the money problems of the ``middle-income'' debtors, such as
Brazil and Mexico, should be handled on a case-by-case basis, a
strategy fashioned in recent years.
   On Sunday, Nigel Lawson, Britain's chancellor of the exchequer,
and West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg both urged the
United States to trim its federal budget deficit.
   ``The absorption by the United States government, for a further
long period, of a sizable share of the world's net savings would
not be in anyone's interest,'' said Lawson.
   The U.S. delegation to the conference did not release remarks of
Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady in the private meetings.
   But non-U.S. sources who spoke on condition of anonymity quoted
Brady as assuring his financial counterparts that the United States
placed the ``highest priority'' on efforts to reduce red-ink
spending.

   Emperor Hirohito continued to bleed internally and
his temperature rose today, a week after his condition suddenly
deteriorated, but officials said the 87-year-old monarch's health
was stable.
   Kenji Maeda, spokesman for the Imperial Household Agency, said
doctors gave the world's longest-reigning monarch .43 pints of
blood in a transfusion to compensate for that lost from his
intestinal hemorrhage.
   He said the frail emperor was fully conscious today and had
discharged ``slight traces of blood'' through his bowels during the
night.
   Since he vomited blood one week ago, the emperor has through
transfusions received a total of 5.96 pints.
   Maeda said Hirohito briefly watched television today, and
conversed with Crown Prince Akihito and Crown Princess Michiko when
they visited. On Thursday, all the emperor's imperial duties were
transferred to Akihito, 54, who is heir to the throne.
   ``I have not seen him (today) myself, but my impression is that
his condition is consistent and stable,'' Maeda said. ``But we have
to remain alert.''
   But he said Hirohito's temperature had risen to 100 at
midafternoon, up from 98.1 in the morning and well above his normal
reading of about 95.9.
   The nationally circulated Asahi Shimbun today quoted medical
experts as saying cancer was the likely cause of Hirohito's
continuous discharge of blood.
   Palace officials have refused to confirm or deny press reports
that the emperor has cancer and instead have urged the Japanese
media to refrain from speculation. Cancer is rarely acknowledged
publicly in Japan.
   Government spokesman Keizo Obuchi said Hirohito was well enough
Sunday to watch on television as sumo wrestling champion
Chiyonofuji won his 25th title in the Autumn Grand Sumo Tournament.
   ``A perfect victory, isn't it,'' the emperor was quoted as
saying.
   Chiyonofuji, along with other top wrestlers, called on the
palace today to sign his name to a register wishing the emperor
speedy recovery.
   The Tokyo Stock Exchange's main index gyrated today with varied
reports of the emperor's condition. After early reports the emperor
had received transfusions during the night, the index fell almost
160 points. It regained its losses after the palace said Hirohito
was in stable condition, but ended the day down 56 points or 0.22
percent.
   Seiichi Kita of Daiwa Securities said the market fluctuations
indicated investors were still concerned about Hirohito's health.
   A crowd of almost 800 people began gathering at the Imperial
Palace after dawn under threatening skies as the nation's vigil
entered a second week.
   As of Sunday, more than 300,000 had signed registries at the
palace and at 11 other locations around the country wishing for the
emperor's recovery, according to palace reports.
   The emperor, who ascended the throne in December 1926, has been
under 24-hour medical supervision since vomiting blood a week ago.
   His condition took a turn for the worse Saturday when his fever
soared to 102.6. By Sunday night, however, Shoichi Fujimori, grand
steward of the Imperial Household Agency, told reporters the crisis
was over.
   Last year on Sept. 22, Hirohito underwent a bypass operation
after an inflamed pancreas put pressure on the duodenum.
   On Saturday, the Asahi Shimbun reported the emperor was
suffering from pancreatic cancer and the respected Kyodo news
agency, quoting a biopsy report, said pathologists found evidence
of cancer in tissue taken from the region between the pancreas and
duodenum in last year's operation.
   Under the constitution, the emperor has no real power but signs
documents and government appointments already approved by the
government.

   A tentative contract agreement averted a
strike by 1,200 Bay Area Rapid Transit workers today, allowing
thousands of commuters to get to work on time.
   ``Both sides compromised and compromised, and then we met _ sort
of happily _ in the middle,'' said Suzanne Angeli, vice president
of Public Employees Union Local 790, which represents janitors,
mechanics and clerks.
   A ratification vote was set for Wednesday, and union leaders
predicted approval.
   The key money issue in the contract dispute was whether BART or
its employees should benefit from an estimated $10 million-a-year
windfall from investments from the Public Employees Retirement
System, to which BART contributes.
   The old contract required the turning over of profits to the
workers. BART wanted two-thirds of the money to go toward
operations.
   The tentative agreement announced Sunday calls for the profits
to be used for three years to finance medical insurance for retired
employees. The union agreed that members also would pay $15 per
month toward the retirees' benefit.
   ``We're happy. They're happy,'' said BART spokesman Mike Healy.
   Local 790, which had been working without a contract since June,
had set a strike time of 12:01 a.m. today. Local 1555 of the
Amalgamated Transit Union, which represents 500 station agents and
train operators, had promised to honor picket lines.
   The district had hoped to offer about half the normal train
service, but only during certain hours of the day.
   Many of the 100,000 people who ride the 71-mile system to work
and back each weekday had spent much of the weekend trying to find
alternative ways to get to their jobs. At least one was set to go
sailing _ to work.
   ``I'm planning to sail my boat to Fisherman's Wharf in San
Francisco, let my wife sail the bay the rest of the day, and then
have her pick us up after work,'' said Don Ravetti of Berkeley
before the strike settlement was announced.

   Two civilian workers at the Philadelphia
Naval Shipyard were killed when 350-degree steam filled the small
tunnel where they were working, a spokesman said.
   The boiler technicians were trying to open a valve to return
steam to a part of the shipyard Sunday morning when the utility
tunnel filled with low-pressure steam that had leaked from a pipe,
said Al Peterson, shipyard spokesman.
   ``The steam filled the area almost instantly and there was no
chance of escape,'' he said.
   Charles Carlson, 42, and Ted Shaw, 28, both of Philadelphia,
entered the tunnel through a manhole at about 6:20 a.m., he said.
   About 40 minutes later, when co-workers realized the men were
overdue, they tried to reach them by radio, Peterson said. Without
knowing what had happened, workers shut off steam to the area as a
precaution, he said.
   Firefighters vented the steam out of the tunnel and pulled the
bodies out, Peterson said. The men were pronounced dead on arrival
at the Naval Hospital.

   Former Sen. Gary Hart said today he would
talk to Syrian officials about the U.S. hostages in Lebanon during
a four-day visit to Damascus.
   The former Democratic presidential front-runner stressed he was
in the Syrian capital on a ``purely personal'' visit. Hart went to
Iraq and Jordan before Syria.
   Hart, who met with Deputy Foreign Minister Yossef Shakkour
shortly after arriving today, said his talks in Damascus would
cover the U.S. hostages, the political crisis in Lebanon, the
Middle East situation and the Iran-Iraq peace talks.
   Syria has some 40,000 troops controlling Lebanon's eastern and
northern provinces in addition to Moslem west Beirut. It wields
considerable infulence with Moslem and leftist factions in that
country.
   Syria has been trying to mediate the release of some of the 17
foreign hostages in Lebanon, including nine Americans. Most of the
captives are held by Shiite Moslems loyal to Iran.
   Damascus was Iran's main Arab supporter during the 8-year war
with Iraq.

<TEXT>
   A minister who shot and killed a church
handyman before beheading him and leaving the man's body in a
burning church has been sentenced to death by electrocution.
   The Rev. John David Terry, 44, was convicted Thursday of
first-degree murder and arson in the slaying of James C. Matheny,
32, whose headless body was found in Terry's burning church on June
16, 1987.
   The jury returned the death sentence against Terry on Sunday
after 13 hours of debate and a brief church service.
   Defense attorney Lionel Barrett said, ``I normally don't put
that much stock in appeals, but I think we've got some genuine
legal issues in this case.''
   Terry's strongest ground for appeal is challenging whether the
murder was committed in conjunction with a larceny, which the jury
listed as one of two aggravating circumstances justifing the
imposition of the death penalty, Barrett said.
   Terry admitted misappropriating more than $30,000 in church
funds, but Barrett argued that it did not amount to larceny under
the terms of Tennessee's felony murder statute.
   Terry also admitted he killed Matheny, dressed the body in his
own clothes and set the Emmanuel Church of Christ Oneness
Pentecostal on fire in a scheme to fake his own death. Prosecutors
said Terry wanted to start a new life and leave insurance proceeds
to his family.
   Terry cut off Matheny's head, part of an arm and patches of skin
marked with tattoos and threw the body parts into Lake Barkley near
Dover, Tenn.
   Prosecutors said Terry bought an additional $150,000 in life
insurance in April 1987 and gathered false identification papers in
the name of a boy who drowned in 1951.
   Circuit Judge Walter Kurtz set Terry's execution for April 3,
1989. Appeals begin immediately and can take more than a decade.
Tennessee has not executed a death row inmate since Nov. 7, 1960.

<TEXT>
   An inmate who was identified in court papers
as a police informant was killed in his cell while other prisoners
went on a rampage, authorities said.
   The 3{-hour uprising Sunday began when inmates refused to let
two unarmed guards confiscate their homemade liquor. Twenty minutes
after authorities quelled the rampage, they discovered the body of
Richard Holmes.
   The lawyer for Holmes, who faced a charge of aiding and abetting
the murder of a drug informant, said authorities are to blame for
Holmes' death because they made public his cooperation, and one
prosecutor involved in the case said his identity was made public
by mistake.
   ``I'm absolutely convinced he was killed because the
prosecutors, contrary to the promise they made, went public with
the fact that Richard Holmes helped them,'' said attorney Rolf
Kehne.
   Idaho State Penitentiary officials declined to speculate whether
the rampage was staged as a diversion to cover up the killing.
   Guards left the area of the uprising about 3:15 p.m. for
reinforcements. Inmates broke glass and burned mattresses and
papers.
   When SWAT teams from several law enforcement agencies re-entered
the building about 6:45 p.m., inmates left voluntarily and no force
was needed, officials said.
   Tim McNeese, executive assistant to state Department of
Corrections director Al Murphy, refused to release details on how
Holmes died. But he said Holmes' killer got into the cell through a
hole knocked in the cinder-block wall.
   In August, Holmes, 35, led police to the partially buried
remains of a drug informant, Denise Williams, 28, of Nampa. But his
hopes of a plea-bargain fizzled when he failed a polygraph test. He
was convicted of unrelated felony charges and also awaited trial on
a charge of aiding and abetting murder.
   Holmes became an instant target when word spread that he had
cooperated with authorities, Kehne said.
   Just Friday, Kehne said, Holmes told him that he considered
himself to be in danger. Holmes had said a handful of newspaper
clippings detailing how he led police to Ms. Williams' body, in
hopes of making a deal, had been shoved into his cell, the lawyer
said.
   Canyon County Prosecutor Richard Harris said he was shocked to
discover that the sensitive information had been placed in the
court file, accessible to reporters and other members of the public.
   He blamed the action on Owyhee County Prosecutor Lawrence
Wasden. Both prosecutors were involved in the case.
   ``I was upset when I found out about it,'' Harris added, ``but
that's one of the problems you get when you have different agencies
involved.''
   Wasden, reached at his home Sunday night, declined to comment.
   Holmes refused to request protective custody because he did not
want to spend several months before his trial in maximum-security,
his lawyer said.
   Holmes was accused of ordering two friends to kill Ms. Williams.
Maxwell Hoffman, 32, has been charged with first-degree murder, and
Ronald Wages, 36, has pleaded guilty to the same charge.

<TEXT>
   A poll conducted in five key states shows Vice
President George Bush with an edge over Democrat Michael Dukakis,
but the lead was within the margin of error and the results could
be regarded as a dead heat.
   The poll of 1,521 voters, published in weekend editions of the
Chicago Tribune, put the vice president ahead in Florida and Texas,
with Dukakis leading in Illinois and New York. California, the
state with the most electoral votes, was a virtual tie.
   No presidential candidate in the 20th century has won without
taking three of the five states polled, and many voters in those
states were looking to Sunday's nationally televised debate to help
them choose between the candidates.
   Overall, Bush led Dukakis 46 percent to 43 percent in the
mid-September survey by pollster Peter Hart of Washington, but the
poll had a 3.5 percent margin of error.
   Bush led in Florida by a comfortable 54 to 37 percent margin,
and in Texas by 50 to 40 percent. In California, the vice president
was ahead 46 to 43 percent, making the state a virtual tie because
of the poll's 6 percent sampling error for the individual state
statistics.
   Dukakis led in New York, 48 to 40 percent, and in Illinois, 47
to 40 percent.
   Nearly three-quarters of those surveyed said they were likely to
watch the debate, and 42 percent said they would ``definitely''
tune in, the newspaper reported.
   One-fourth said the 90-minute debate would be ``very important''
in helping them decide which candidate to vote for, and 18 percent
said the joint appearance would be ``fairly important.''

<HEAD>Scientists Use Eye-Cell Transplants in Rats to Cure Disease</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scientists have taken a major step toward curing
a disease that causes blindness, saving the eyesight of
experimental rats by transplanting retinal cells in their eyes,
according to a published report.
   Two groups of scientists have succeeded in performing the
transplants and preventing a type of blindness in the rats, The New
York Times reported Sunday. The researchers said the procedure
would have to be repeated on monkeys and other animals before it
could be tried on human beings, the Times reported.
   According to the Retinitis Pigmentosa Foundation in Baltimore,
degenerative diseases of the retina occur in 400,000 living
Americans. Macular degeneration, one of these diseases, is the
leading cause of blindness in this country in people over the age
of 60.
   Sometimes doctors can slow the loss of vision in patients with
these diseases but they have no way of preventing it.
   Before the scientists' findings could be applied to humans, the
problem of tissue rejection will have to be overcome, the newspaper
reported. The rats came from a special, inbred strain whose immune
system accepts other tissue without attacking it.
   The experiments involved rats with an inherited defect in
pigmented epithelial cells, which darken the pupil and allow light
to pass through. These cells cover and nourish photoreceptor cells,
which convert light to electrical signals that are interpreted by
the brain. The pigmented epithelial cells also ingest excess
photoreceptor cells.
   In the diseased rats, the pigmented epithelial cells die, which
eventually leads to the death of the photoreceptor cells.
   To cure the disease before the photoreceptor cells died, the
scientists cut slits in the back of the animals' eyes and injected
tiny drops of fluid containing healthy cells into the area where
the pigmented cells normally grow.
   The research was conducted by two groups working independently:
James E. Turner and Linxi Li of Wake Forest University in
Winston-Salem, N.C.; and Peter Gouras and his colleagues at
Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in New York.
   Turner has operated on more than 200 rats, the Times said. In
every case, the transplanted cells survived and prevented the
photoreceptor cells from dying.
   Gouras said he and his colleagues hoped to try the retinal cell
transplants on monkeys next. Turner said he would try them on
rabbits and monkeys and would try implanting greater numbers of
cells in rats.

   NASA set the countdown clock ticking
today for returning Americans to space on Thursday aboard the
shuttle Discovery.
   ``The launch countdown is now in progress,'' test director Terry
Willingham announced promptly at 8 a.m. EDT as he signaled the
traditional ``call to stations.'' That call assembled more than 100
controllers at their consoles.
   Early work included loading Discovery's computer software,
servicing the main engines and other propulsion systems and
removing work platforms from around the base of the spaceplane.
   ``We're looking forward to doing the shot and doing it right and
launching on time,'' Frank Merlino, another test director, told a
news conference shortly after the countdown began for the first
U.S. manned space mission since Challenger exploded over the
Atlantic, killing the crew of seven, 32 months ago.
   Thursday's forecast was for scattered and broken clouds, a wind
of 10-15 knots from the southeast, temperatures of 85 degrees and
widely scattered showers.
   ``Given the constraints NASA has, things look very, very good,''
said Senior Master Sgt. Mike Beeman, an Air Force weather spokesman.
   The countdown had been set to begin at midnight but was
postponed when launch pad workers fell behind in preparations
Sunday.
   NASA said that did not affect the goal of launching Discovery at
9:59 a.m. Thursday.
   ``We're still on the timeline for launch on the 29th and that's
the plan,'' launch director Bob Sieck said Sunday.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration had built 39
unprogrammed hours of contingency time into the countdown as
insurance for last-minute problems.
   Sieck said it was decided Sunday to allot eight hours of that
time to complete the work of replacing panels and removing work
platforms from around Discovery's engine compartment.
   ``We don't want those people to have to do that under the gun
with the clock counting,'' he said. ``So we said, `Take all the
time it takes and we'll delay the call to stations to accommodate
that.'''
   Closing out the aft end of the spaceplane had been held up when
low voltage readings were detected in an electrical circuit that
ignites the explosive charges used to separate the shuttle from its
fuel tank in flight. Engineers eventually determined the fault was
in a ground circuit, which does not affect the flight.
   Discovery's five astronauts planned to fly here late this
afternoon from their training base at the Johnson Space Center in
Houston.
   Once here, they will receive daily briefings on launch
preparations, review their flight plan and undergo medical
examinations.
   Commander Rick Hauck, a Navy captain, and pilot Dick Covey, an
Air Force colonel, planned to practice landings at a runway here in
a jet outfitted to handle like the shuttle.
   The three mission specialists in the crew are George Nelson,
Mike Lounge and Dave Hilmers, a Marine lieutenant colonel.
   All have flown on earlier shuttle flights.
   During four days in orbit they are to release a $100 million
communications satellite from Discovery's cargo bay, conduct 11
science and technology experiments and check out modifications made
to the shuttle since the Challenger accident.
   ``Because there are so many changes, we're treating it like a
test flight of a new vehicle,'' Hauck said in a recent interview.
   The Rogers commission that investigated the Challenger accident
said the direct cause was a leak at a joint between two segments of
one of Challenger's two solid-fuel booster rockets.
   Engineers redesigned the booster, and made improvements to the
orbiter, the main engines and the external fuel tank. In all, 56
major changes and more than 400 lesser ones were made. The program
to redesign all three shuttles has cost about $2.4 billion to date.
   The commission report said cold weather, 36 degrees at launch,
contributed to the Challenger accident by stiffening O-rings in the
joint, preventing them from sealing gaps properly.
   Some engineers had argued with lower-level managers against
launching in the cold, but their concerns never were relayed to top
managers who made the launch decision.
   NASA has changed procedures to make certain concerns of any
agency or contractor employee are relayed to top management.
   And a Mission Management Team, made up of 21 key NASA and
contractor managers and engineers, has been established to monitor
the final two days of the countdown.
   The team is headed by astronaut Bob Crippen, who has made four
shuttle flights. With the help of team members, he will assemble
all information in the final minutes of the count and will have
sole authority to signal the decision to launch.

<HEAD>Debate Over Veep Choices: Bush Defends Quayle, Dukakis Questions

<TEXT>
   WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (AP) _ Michael Dukakis and George Bush had
one of their more feisty debate exchanges when discussing running
mates, with Bush declaring he had ``full confidence'' in Dan Quayle
while Dukakis scoffed at the prospect of ``President Quayle.''
   The debate over running mates came late in the 90-minute clash
Sunday night between Democrat Dukakis and Republican Bush. Bush had
not mentioned Quayle at all before he was asked to explain his
choice; Dukakis twice before briefly had mentioned Bentsen when
discussing his views on foreign policy.
   Bush, in defending Quayle, praised the Indiana senator's defense
credentials and noted his leadership role in winning passage of a
job training measure. ``I believe he will be outstanding,'' said
Bush, who then said the media had subjected Quayle to
``outrageous'' and ``brutal'' scrutiny of his academic and military
records.
   ``He has my full confidence,'' Bush said.
   But the vice president also created an opening for Dukakis when,
in an effort to paint the Massachusetts governor as naive on
foreign policy and defense, said there were three people on the
Republican ticket who were well-versed in those areas. Bush
obviously meant to say three people among the four candidates, but
Dukakis seized the opportunity.
   ``Did I sense a desire that maybe Lloyd Bentsen ought to be your
running mate whe you said that the three people on your ticket?''
Dukakis said to laughter from the audience at Wake Forest
University.
   Quayle, interviewed outside his suburban McLean, Va., home
Sunday night, said he was undisturbed by the questions that Dukakis
raised about his qualifications.
   ``When the American people come to know Dan Quayle ... they will
feel more comfortable,'' Quayle said. ``They've been told a lot of
inaccuracies, a lot of rumors that proved to be groundless.''
   Quayle said Bush had telephoned him after the debate and was
``very upbeat, for a very good reason.'' He said Bush was clearly
victorious ``because he was able to depict Michael Dukakis as out
of the mainstream.''
   Dukakis, who includes the Quayle selection in his attack on
Bush's judgment, used most of his rebuttal time after Bush defended
Quayle on that track and to praise the experience and maturity of
Bentsen.
   But he also delivered a biting criticism of Quayle, a second
term senator who was little known nationally before Bush tapped him
for the vice presidential spot in August.
   ``I doubt very much that Dan Quayle was the best qualified
person for that job,'' Dukakis said. ``And as a matter of fact, I
think for most people the notion of `President Quayle' is a very,
very troubling notion.''
   Bush did not criticize Bentsen but did attack Dukakis for making
fun, in his campaign appearances, of Quayle's given name, J.
Danforth Quayle.
   ``Do you know who J. Danforth was?'' Bush asked of his rival.
``He was a man that gave his life in World War II. So ridiculing a
person's name is a little beneath this process.''

<HEAD>Ozal To Remain Premier After Referendum Defeat</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EMEL ANIL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ANKARA, Turkey (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Premier Turgut Ozal said today he would
remain in office and continue to serve ``with vigor and
enthusiasm'' even though Turkish voters rejected a referendum
sponsored by his government.
   Opposition parties turned Sunday's proposed constitutional
amendment _ which called for moving municipal elections from March
1989 to November of this year _ into a vote of confidence on Ozal
and his free-market economic policies. The premier said earlier he
would resign ``depending upon the outcome.''
   With 86 percent of the votes counted, the state television
reported early today that 65 percent of the 26.5 million eligible
voters opposed the amendment and 35 percent were in favor of it.
   But Ozal said in a televised statement today that he would
remain premier until the next general elections in 1992.
   He said he was satisfied with the result of the vote, since the
number of ``yes'' votes were about the same as the 36 percent his
Motherland Party won in general elections 10 months ago. The result
gave the party a 290-seat majority in the 450-member Parliament.
   But opposition leaders Erdal Inonu of the Social Democrat
Populist Party and former premier Suleyman Demirel, who heads the
centrist True Path Party, said today's result was a defeat for the
61-year-old premier.
   ``He has not received the support he was seeking,'' said Inonu.
   ``This government has been rejected by the people _ tomorrow
there will be new political conditions in Turkey,'' said Demirel.
   During the pre-referendum campaign, the opposition emphasized
the country's 78 percent inflation, the rising foreign debt _ which
doubled in the past five years to $42 billion _ and low wages.
   Ozal responded that under his tenure, Turkey has enjoyed high
economic growth, which has averaged an annual 7.5 percent in the
past two years and is projected at 7.2 percent for 1988. He said
the economic boom has brought Turkey new housing, roads, dams, and
communications systems.
   The premier called on voters to avoid returning to the turbulent
decade that ended in a 1980 military takeover, which was
accompanied by an economic crisis and political violence.
   Ozal, who launched Turkey's economic recovery program as deputy
premier under the military government, became premier when his
party won in the 1983 elections that restored civilian rule.

   Dow Chemical Co. and a Canadian company,
Domtar Inc. of Montreal, will form a joint venture to recycle
discarded plastic for use in manufacturing, the companies said
today.
   The new company, to be owned equally by Dow and Domtar, will
take plastic soft-drink bottles, milk jugs and other waste consumer
items and process them into raw materials to be used in making
other products.
   ``We're confident that this joint venture will show that
commercial recycling of plastics can be a profitable enterprise and
an important part of the solution to North America's solid-waste
disposal problem,'' said Don Genson, Dow's business director for
solid-waste solutions.
   Plastics recycling is now limited mainly to industrial scrap,
said Dow, which is based in Midland, Mich.
   Genson said the recycling venture will provide an alternative to
landfills for disposal and so ``will help to preserve the
environment and make better use of our resources.''
   Domtar will be principally responsible for collecting the waste
plastic for recycling.
   The waste will be taken from existing collection centers, mainly
in areas that have recycling laws, the companies said.
   The plastic reclaimed by the joint venture will be used by
Domtar in its manufacturing or sold by Dow Chemical in resin to
other industrial customers, the companies said.
   Domtar now recycles waste paper in both the United States and
Canada.
   Initially, the joint venture will conduct a pilot-plant program
to improve recycling technology. Full-scale commercial operation is
expected to begin no sooner than 1990, the companies said.
   A decision on plant location remains to be made, they said.

<HEAD>Government Designates Neighborhoods To Be Integrated</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GREG MYRE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government today for the
first time publicly identified ``whites only'' neighborhoods that
could be opened legally to people of all races.
   Tens of thousands of non-whites already live illegally in
districts of Johannesburg, Cape Town, Durban and Port Elizabeth,
which Constitutional Planning Minister Chris Heunis cited as areas
likely to be integrated.
   In a session of Parliament today, Heunis reintroduced three
bills under the Group Areas Act, which segregates all neighborhoods
by race and sharply increases the penalties for violations of the
act.
   The bills, viewed as an attempt to appease conservative white
voters before the nationwide municipal elections on Oct. 26, were
first introduced last month, but were withdrawn after
anti-apartheid groups and black leaders condemned it.
   The new legislation, however, also proposes to legalize a
limited number of multiracial neighborhoods that have developed in
recent years as whites moved out of urban neighborhoods. The
measure has been denounced by the Conservative Party, which is
expected to makes gains in the elections at the expense of
President P.W. Botha's National Party.
   The Group Areas bills created a political furor in Parliament
last month, when the white chamber approved them, but the
mixed-race and Asian chambers boycotted parliamentary discussions
in protest. The government withdrew the bills, but decided to
reintroduce them after the two chambers agreed to end their boycott.
   ``When the colored (mixed-race) and Indian communities tell me
that the Group Areas Act has hurt them, I say in all earnestness:
`I hear you,''' Heunis said today at a joint session of the three
chambers.
   But Heunis said the government remained committed to protecting
``group rights'' _ a phrase for policies which allow whites-only
schools, hospitals and residential areas.
   The mixed-race and Asian chambers are expected to reject all
three bills, including the proposal to allow multiracial
neighborhoods. Leaders of the chambers say the Group Areas Act
should be repealed, rather than amended.
   However, the National Party _ which controls Parliament's white
chamber _ has the power to enact the legislation even if the
proposed bills are rejected by the other two chambers.
   Under South Africa's policy of apartheid, the nation's 26
million blacks are not represented in Parliament and has not vote
in national affairs, which are controlled by the 5 million whites.
   Among the areas mentioned by Heunis as candidates for
multiracial status were Johannesburg's Hillbrow and Joubert Park
neighborhoods and Cape Town's District Six, from which tens of
thousands of mixed-race people were evicted in 1966 after it was
designated for whites only.
   A surplus of housing in white urban neighborhoods is accompanied
by a severe shortage of housing in non-white areas, and thousands
of Asians, blacks and people of mixed race have been moving into
districts vacated by whites.
   The Group Areas Act has been the most hotly contested issue in
the municipal elections.
   The anti-apartheid Progressive Federal Party is the only major
white party that opposes the Group Areas Act, the most hotly
contested issue in the municipal elections. Last week, a National
Party member of Johannesburg's city council said he would lobby for
multiracial areas in wards that vote for the Progressive Federal
Party, but would seek to keep other white neighborhoods segregated.

<HEAD>Father Delighted at Mention of Insurance Plight by Dukakis</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An unemployed Houston machinist said he was
pleased that Michael Dukakis mentioned insurance problems facing
the Texas family in a nationally televised debate.
   ``I was kind of surprised,'' said Charles Strickland, 42. ``It
made me feel good in a way that issue was important enough to be
mentioned on national TV in a debate,'' Strickland said.
   ``I don't know if it will sway any votes one way or another, but
I know there are a lot of people like me.''
   Dukakis, facing George Bush in a debate from Winston-Salem,
N.C., Sunday night, spoke of ``a father who had been laid off a few
months ago and lost his health insurance.
   ``He has an 11-year-old son and can't let that son compete in
sports in Little League because he's afraid he's going to be hurt
and he won't be able to provide health insurance to pay those
bills,'' Dukakis said.
   Strickland said he had not mentioned Little League baseball when
he met with Dukakis and others in a forum on health insurance last
week in Houston.
   Instead, he had told the Massachusetts governor of his son's
desire to play football in school.
   ``My son would like to participate in sports, but frankly,
without insurance, I'm scared to death to let him play,''
Strickland told Dukakis during the forum at Houston's Hermann
hospital. ``If he'd get hurt, I couldn't get any medical treatment
for him.''
   Strickland said he and his wife were sad that they felt had to
keep their son, Jason, off the playing field. But he said they had
little choice because they would have to sign a release relieving
the school of responsibility if Jason were injured.
   ``My wife is employed and insurance is available where she
works, but the premiums are so high we can't afford it,''
Strickland said. ``We're scraping now to pay off the house notes
and the utilities.''
   Dukakis mentioned Strickland and his son while discussing his
proposal that the federal government require businesses to provide
health insurance for employees.

<DATELINE>CALTANISETTA, Sicily (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Sicilian magistrate who sentenced
two Mafia bosses to life imprisonment was ambushed and killed along
with this 35-year-old son, police said today.
   Antonio Saetta, 66, and his son Stefano were killed by gunmen
who stopped their car on a road outside Caltanisetta as they drove
home Sunday night, police said.
   Investigators said the ambush appeared to be a Mafia vendetta
for the 1985 sentencing of brothers Michele and Salvatore Greco.
   Saetta was the presiding judge at the trial of the Grecos,
described as the bosses of a powerful Mafia ring. Saetta sentenced
the brothers to life in prison after they were convicted of
masterminding the killing of Judge Rocco Chinnici, who had been
investigating their activities.
   An Interior Ministry spokesman in Rome called Saetta's killing
``a clear challenge to the state'' that recently named a special
investigator, Judge Domenico Sica, to crack down on the Mafia and
its financial links in Sicily.
   Saetta, who had been transferred from the court in Azzizes to
one in Palermo following the trial of the Grecos and their
associates, became the eighth magistrate killed by the Mafia in
Sicily since 1968.
   Police said the killers shadowed Saetta and his son as they left
the nearby resort of Canicatti, where they had spent the weekend
with relatives.
   In a deserted part of the Agrigento-Caltanisetta road in central
Sicily, the killers rammed and stopped the judge's car and fired at
least 20 shots through the windows.
   Police said the judge was hit by three bullets in the head and
two in the chest and died instantly. His son was also hit by
several bullets.
   An anonymous caller tipped police about two hours after the
killings, sources reported.

   In a weekend when residents marched to
reclaim streets from violent gangs, four people died and seven
others were wounded including a pregnant woman shot as part of an
apparent gang initiation rite, police said.
   Residents of south-central Los Angeles on Saturday marched to
protest gang violence in their neighborhoods.
   ``The walk that we made was simply to say to those people who
want to intimidate us that we won't be intimidated,'' said Claudia
Ghess of the South Central Organizing Committee. ``They think they
have possession of those streets. We want them to know we plan to
take charge of those streets.''
   But that day in the area, one man was killed and three others
were wounded in separate drive-by shootings, authorities said.
   A teen-age gang member on Saturday night walked into the
apartment complex of Marlene Garcia, 19 and three months pregnant,
and opened fire, police Sgt. Ralph Freeze said Sunday.
   Ms. Garcia, sitting on the front steps of the complex, was shot
in the lower back and was in stable condition Sunday at County-USC
Medical Center, Freeze said. Three 16-year-olds were arrested and
booked for investigation of attempted murder.
   The attack was believed to be part of a gang initiation, police
said. The boy who fired the shots was believed to be trying to
impress other gang members.
   A second pregnant woman and two men were wounded Saturday by
pellets from shotgun blasts fired from a passing car, authorities
said.
   The expectant mother, who wasn't identified, and the two men
were treated for minor pellet wounds resulting from the incident on
a Westlake street, Sgt. Richard Roach said.
   In other shootings, one man was killed in a possible
gang-related confrontation, a teen-ager was killed in an argument
among fellow gang members and a pedestrian was fatally shot in a
suspected gang-related incident.
   The highest weekend death toll from gang violence in Los Angeles
this year occurred during the weekend before Labor Day, when 11
died.

   A candidate for the state's highest criminal court
is publicizing his campaign with a contest that asks entrants about
the race and promises a free trip to Sea World to the winner.
   Judge Tom Rickhoff of San Antonio, who says his bid for the
Texas Court of Criminal Appeals has received little attention,
placed a full-page ad in the September issue of Texas Monthly
magazine with pictures of himself, a penguin and a dolphin under
the headline ``A Real Political Contest.''
   The ad includes a contest entry form that invites Texans to
answer four true-or-false questions about Rickhoff's race against
incumbent Judge Charles Miller.
   The winner, to be selected in a drawing Oct. 18, gets a
four-day, three-night vacation in San Antonio, complete with passes
to see Sea World of Texas, tickets to a San Antonio Spurs
basketball game and a tour of the Alamo.
   And there are prizes for the runners-up: 10 pounds of Tex-Mex
frozen shrimp, three pairs of jogging shoes and an assortment of
candy.
   ``It's innovative,'' said Rickhoff, who is currently a
Republican state district judge in San Antonio.
   ``This is embarrassing,'' Miller said.
   Randy Erben, assistant secretary of state, said his office has
studied Rickhoff's contest and concluded it does not violate state
election law.
   Miller said the idea shows poor judgment.
   ``It creates a circus atmosphere in a race that ought to be
dealt with seriously,'' he said.
   Rickhoff said he decided to conduct the contest after finding
that people not only didn't recognize his name, but had never heard
of the Court of Criminal Appeals, the court of last resort for
criminal cases in Texas.
   He said he wants to ``dramatize the fact that there is a citizen
wall of apathy around the race.'' He added that he's received only
about two dozen entries.
   The contest entry blank also has a box that can be checked for
donations, but the ad specifies that entrants need not contribute
to enter the contest.

<HEAD>U.N. Protests Rise In Palestinian Casualties</HEAD>

Arab shot to death, 34 wounded, details. No pickup. CHANGES byline.</NOTE>

   A U.N. relief agency protested today to the
Israeli army about the sharp rise in the number of Palestinian
casualties since July in the occupied territories.
   Meanwhile, a 19-year-old Arab protester died after he was shot
in the mouth and at least 34 others were wounded today as violence
swept the West Bank and Gaza Strip, hospital officials said.
   The clashes came as Palestinians staged a general strike in the
territories to protest the jailing of thousands of Arab activists
by Israel. Militants hoisted white sheets sprayed with red
swastikas and scrawled anti-Israeli grafitti on walls.
   The U.N. Relief and Works Agency, which aids Palestinian
refugees, said the number of Palestinians shot by army gunfire in
the Gaza Strip jumped from 19 in July to 130 so far this month. The
count did not include today's casualty toll. Figures for the West
Bank still are being compiled.
   ``There is a clear trend of a growing use of live ammunition
that cannot be justified,'' said a senior U.N. official. ``Our
concern is very real. This is not just a knee-jerk reaction to a
bad day.''
   The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, linked the
increase in casualties to the introduction in August of plastic
bullets that penetrate the body like live ammunition, but generally
are not fatal unless fired from less than 20 yards.
   The introduction of plastic bullets lowered the threshold for
opening fire. While troops are allowed to use live ammunition only
in life-threatening situations, they can now fire plastic bullets
to disperse stone-throwers.
   In violent clashes in the Arab village of Jabal Mukaber
straddling Jerusalem's city limits, riot police fatally shot
19-year-old Jamal Mattar in the mouth during a stone-throwing
protest, officials at Jerusalem's Mukassed Hospital said.
   An Israeli photographer said about 20 stone-throwers faced off
with riot police, with the two groups standing on opposing hills.
Police fired tear gas and then live ammunition, the photographer
said.
   Mattar's death brought to 272 the number of Palestinians killed
since the uprising began Dec. 8. Six Israelis have died during the
same period.
   Widespread clashes spread throughout the West Bank and Gaza
Strip, and 34 Palestinians were wounded, including 26 in the Gaza
Strip and eight in the West Bank, hospital officials said.
   Among the wounded was an 11-year-old deaf boy from Gaza City who
was in serious condition with a bullet wound in the chest, the
officials said.
   The army confirmed three wounded and said it was checking the
other casualty reports.
   On Sunday, Jewish settlers tried to mark a festival celebrating
the Jews' biblical wanderings by settling a patch of land in the
West Bank, but Israeli troops thwarted the attempt.
   The settlers were marking the beginning of the weeklong
celebration of Sukkot, the Feast of Tabernacles, which marks the
Israelites' wanderings in the desert after their exodus from Egypt.
Jews traditionally build makeshift huts on Sukkot to symbolize life
in the wilderness.
   Moshe Neuman, a spokesman for the settlers' group, said 12
families and 20 single people pitched tents northwest of the Arab
town of Jericho, about 15 miles northeast of Jerusalem.
   ``They went to the site in the morning and set up there with
tents, equipment and everything needed,'' Neuman said. He said the
families had been promised more than a year ago that a settlement
would be approved.
   The families ``were evacuated peacefully,'' Neuman said.
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin had warned that attempts by
settlers to set up new colonies during Sukkot would be resisted by
the government.
   About 120 Jewish settlements have been established in the West
Bank and Gaza Strip since Israel occupied the lands in the 1967
Middle East war. The independent Jerusalem Center for Public
Affairs says about 72,000 people live in the settlements,
surrounded by 1.5 million Palestinians.

<HEAD>Willowbrook Computer Company Investigated On Exports</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal authorities suspect a suburban Chicago
electronics company of illegally exporting computer equipment that
may have been resold to the Soviet Union.
   No charges have been filed against Libra Electronics Inc. of
Willowbrook, but documents filed in U.S. District Court indicate
the company and owner Rajeev Sharma of Westmont are under
investigation by the U.S. attorney's office and the U.S. Department
of Commerce.
   Investigators said warehouses in Australia, where computer parts
were shipped by Libra for assembly into personal computers, turned
out to be vacant.
   U.S. Attorney Anton Valukas declined to comment on the
investigation. Sharma had an unpublished number at his Westmont
home and could not be reached for comment.
   Vijay Gulani, manager of Libra, confirmed that a search of
company offices had been conducted, but said: ``This is ridiculous.
Somebody made up a story.''
   The Commerce Department bars exports of sophisticated computer
equipment to Soviet-bloc nations because they could be used for
military purposes. For the past seven years, the U.S. Customs
Service has conducted an ongoing investigation, called ``Operation
Exodus,'' to stem illegal shipments of electronic equipment to the
Eastern bloc.
   Federal agents, armed with search warrants, raided Libra's
offices and Sharma's home in late July, a court affidavit said.
   The investigation began after federal authorities were contacted
by officials of Motorola Inc., an electronics company.
   According to records obtained by the government, Sharma
purchased $338,000 worth of computer products, including high-speed
memory devices, from Motorola suppliers in the Chicago-area.
   Alan Smith, Motorola's distribution marketing manager for
Australia, reported to Motorola officials in the United States that
he suspected Libra might be violating U.S. export regulations by
sending parts to India and possibly to the Soviet Union, the
affidavit said.
   Smith said Libra's Sydney representative, Sud Kakwani, told him
in May that Libra was ``re-exporting the components'' to another
manufacturing site in India, according to the affidavit.
   Smith said Kakwani told him that ``his Libra colleagues in India
were building a strong relationship with the `Russian market,'''
the affidavit said.
   After becoming suspicious, Smith and another Motorola official
decided to visit three addresses listed by Libra as the sites of
their assembly facilities in Australia, but found two partly empty
warehouses and an apartment, according to court documents.

<HEAD>Reagan Ending Convoys But Keeping Navy Close By</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Diplomatic Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan decided today to end U.S.
convoys of American-flagged ships in the Persian Gulf but will keep
U.S. forces in the gulf to aid threatened ships, the White House
announced.
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters that
Reagan acted ``after reviewing the current cease-fire ..., which
has been in effect since Aug. 20, and consulting with allies and
friends in the region.''
   There have been no attacks on gulf shipping since the cease-fire
began.
   Fitzwater said the president made the decision in Washington
before leaving for New York, where he was to discuss the change
with heads of state from the region.
   Reagan, after a farewell speech to the U.N. General Assembly,
had meetings set with Sheik Jamir Ahmed Sabah, the ruling emir of
Kuwait, and with leaders of the Gulf Cooperation Council, which is
headed by Saudi Arabia.
   The president's meeting with the sheik is the first since Sabah
came to power in 1976.
   The convoy operation, begun 14 months ago, involved a precise
Navy formation used to protect against potential Iranian attacks
Kuwaiti tankers re-registered under the U.S. flag.
   ``The modification entails a change from a `tight escort'
procedure to an `accompany' regime,'' Fitzwater said on Air Force
One as Reagan flew to New York.
   ``In an `accompany' regime, U.S. forces will be positioned such
that they can take appropriate action if American-flagged ships are
directly threatened.''
   There have been no attacks on gulf shipping since the cease-fire
went into effect.
   The spokesman said that even with the change, the United States
``intends to maintain in the gulf the forces required to protect
U.S.-flagged shipping and support our national objectives. These
changes in no way alter our commitment to freedom of navigation in
the gulf.''
   The spokesman said the move is ``the first step in the change of
our presence. We will continue to review our presence in the gulf
and will make changes as the threat diminishes.'' For now, he said,
the Navy will not reduce its presence in the gulf.
   The United States has 26 ships in its Joint Task Force Middle
East, including 17 in the Persian Gulf. As of Sept. 16, the Navy
had conducted 85 convoy operations since the escorts began.
   When asked whether the move could lead to normalization of
relations with Iran, Fitzwater said, ``We've always said we're
willing to talk to authorized Iranian officials.''
   But he said that there have been no requests from Iran for a
meeting and that there has been no news regarding the American
hostages held in Lebanon.
   The spokesman said it will take a few days before the changes in
gulf escorting take place and there are no plans to make a formal
announcement at that time.

<HEAD>Young Praises Unheralded Role Of Southern Governors On Civil
Rights</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEA ISLAND, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Southern governors by and large got a bum
rap during the civil rights struggle, and their behind-the-scenes
efforts to resolve social problems were largely ignored, Atlanta
Mayor Andrew Young said today.
   In a keynote speech to the Southern Governors Association's
annual conference, the former aide to civil rights leader Martin
Luther King Jr. said news accounts of the period focused on the
``embarrassing'' public activities of some governors rather than on
the work they were doing privately.
   ``In the difficult, dark days of the South, when it was
extremely unpopular politically to be for justice, there were
Southern governors who took the risk ... and found ways to deal
with the problems without losing their political credibility,''
Young said.
   He attributed much of the change in the South today to the quiet
work of those governors.
   Young drew a standing ovation from the governors and an audience
of several hundred registered for the conference.
   Summarizing progress in the South, Young said that ``25 years
later, we're working together in a way most of us as children would
never have believed possible.''
   He added, however, ``We have only just begun to achieve the
potential of this region.''
   The governors are among 11 chief executives from Southern states
participating in the 54th annual meeting of the SGA. The meeting
began today and runs through Tuesday.

   NOTE: This breakdown counts the vacant seats in the 3rd District
in New Jersey and the 19th District in New York as Democratic and
the 2nd District in Tennessee as Republican. James J. Howard's
death in March left the New Jersey seat vacant, while John J.
Duncan's death in June left the Tennessee seat vacant. The New York
seat is vacant after the resignation of Mario Biaggi.
   The trend line gives the anticipated new party division for the
U.S. House. It is calculated by adding the number of races which
each party has won or is leading.

   Round One of the presidential candidates'
debates went to Michael Dukakis by a slender margin over George
Bush, according to a panel of veteran debate judges who kept score
for The Associated Press.
   Three judges gave the nod to Dukakis, while the other three
sided with Bush, but the Democrat emerged with the most points on
their ballots, 144-141.
   Several hundred television viewers polled by ABC immediately
after Sunday night's debate also thought the Massachusetts governor
was the winner.
   Of the 639 registered voters surveyed by the network, 44 percent
said Dukakis won the encounter, 36 percent said Bush and 20 percent
called it a tie.
   When ABC contacted the same people prior to the debate, 48
percent identified themselves as Dukakis suporters, 46 percent as
Bush backers and 6 percent undecided. Afterwards, 52 percent said
they favored Dukakis, 45 percent Bush and 3 percent remained
undecided _ a shift toward the Democrat of no statistical
signicance, given the poll's 4.5 percentage point margin of error.
   A copyrighted Newsweek magazine poll showed American voters were
evenly split in their assessment of which candidate won the Sunday
debate, with 42 percent favoring Dukakis and 41 percent saying the
GOP nominee was the victor.
   The Newsweek poll showed that undecided swing voters went both
ways _ 43 percent said they were more likely to vote for Dukakis
after the debate and 43 percent said they were more likely to vote
for Bush.
   The Newsweek survey, conducted by the Gallup Organization,
involved telephone interviews with 337 registered voters
immediately after the debate. The margin of error was 6 percentage
points.
   James J. Unger, director of the National Forensics Institute at
American University in Washington and chairman of the AP panel,
said, ``There was no knockout punch by either party.''
   Unger, who gave Bush a 25-24 edge on his scorecard, said, ``On
the very narrow, argumentative, technical sense, on the flow sheet,
I think that Vice President Bush was the winner. But my suspicion
is that Michael Dukakis will emerge as the political victor from
the debate.
   ``Dukakis had more blanks to fill in from the standpoint of the
voters. ... He emerged as a credible alternative to Bush,'' Unger
said.
   Melissa Maxcy Wade, director of forensics at Emory University,
said that in 12 years of judging presidential debates, ``It's the
first time I've ever heard the candidates laughed at by the
audience. Bush was laughed at twice by the audience at Wake Forest
University, on Iran-Contra and the abortion question, and Dukakis
was laughed at on crime.''
   Wade, who scored it 25-22 for Dukakis, said, ``Dukakis was much
more organized. Bush has a tendency to ramble and be a little out
of it.'' But she praised Bush for ``deflecting his potential
bloopers with humor.''
   James M. Copeland, national executive secretary of the National
Forensic League in Ripon, Wis., picked Dukakis, 23-21. He called
Bush ``choppy and fumbling.''
   William Southworth, director of forensics and professor of
speech at the University of Redlands, rated Bush a 27-26 winner.
``Bush's position that you must negotiate (with the Soviets) out of
strength was never answered,'' he said.
   Frank Sferra, director of forensics at J.K. Mullen High School
in Denver, gave Dukakis a 23-21 edge, while L.D. Naegelin, speech
and theater arts consultant for the North East Independent School
District, San Antonio, Texas, scored it 25-23 for Bush.
   The judges watched the debate on television in their own
hometowns, using a scorecard modeled after the American Forensic
Association Debate Ballot for collegiate and scholastic debates.
   They awarded one to five points in each of six categories:
reasoning, evidence, organization, refutation, cross-examination
and presentation. A 1 was poor, 2 fair, 3 average, 4 excellent and
5 superior.
   Here are their combined scores:

   Afghan guerrillas killed 21 people and wounded 33
today in rocket attacks on Kabul, the Afghan capital, and the city
of Pulialam to the south, the official Soviet news agency Tass said.
   The agency said 16 people were killed in a ground-to-ground
missile attack on Kabul and five died when missiles were fired in
Pulialam.
   Tass said 27 people were wounded in the Kabul attack. Six others
were injured by the shelling in Pulialam, the report said. It said
Afghan forces confiscated rocket launchers, a rifle, a mortar and
several machine guns.
   The Soviet Union began pulling its troops out of Afghanistan on
May 15. The troops were sent into the country in December 1979 to
help the Afghan government fight Moslem guerrillas.

   WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (AP) _ George Bush and Michael Dukakis
resumed campaign hostilities from a distance today as the early
soundings rated Sunday night's nationally televised debate as close
as their race for the White House.
   ``I really think it went well. I really think it went great,''
the vice president told reporters as he departed the debate city
for a campaign appearance in Jackson, Tenn., with running mate Dan
Quayle.
   Dukakis flew to Cleveland and said the 90-minute debate had
provided ``the best moments of this whole campaign.'' In remarks
prepared for a rally, the Democrat heralded the opportunity to move
beyond ``the slogans and labels, the photo opportunities and the
flag-waving, and get down to the real issues.''
   Dukakis left it to his campaign manager to claim victory. ``Our
own polls showed us winning the debate decisively,'' said Susan
Estrich.
   Bush went into the debate holding a narrow lead over his rival
in most surveys, with six weeks remaining until the election.
   The debate was marked by numerous biting comments as Dukakis and
Bush clashed over the deficit, defense issues and dealing with the
Soviet Union in their 90 minutes on stage at Wake Forest University.
   Newsweek said a poll taken immediately after the debate found
that 42 percent of the voters who watched the debate said Dukakis
did a better job while 41 percent said Bush outperformed his rival.
   An ABC poll taken Sunday night found that 44 percent rated
Dukakis the winner, 36 percent gave the edge to Bush and 20 percent
said it was a tie.
   Those polled had been contacted by the network prior to the
debate and, at that time, 48 percent supported Dukakis, 46 percent
backed Bush and 6 percent were undecided, Brennan said.
   In the survey taken just following the debate, 52 percent said
they supported Dukakis, 45 percent supported Bush and 3 percent
were undecided. Given the margin or error, that shift is
statistically meaningless, said network polling analyst John
Brennan.
   Bush campaign chairman James A. Baker III told reporters that
Bush would oppose criminal prosecution of women who receive
abortions, even though the vice president said during the debate
that he hadn't ``sorted out of the penalties.'' Bush opposes
abortion in most cases.
   Said Baker:
   ``He would not wish to see a woman labeled as a criminal,
notwithstanding his views on the right-to-life. Women should be
seen as an additional victim.''
   The pollsters began weighing in as the two candidates returned
to their task for the final six weeks of the campaign. The two men
will debate again in Los Angeles Oct. 13 or 14, and vice
presidential candidates Dan Quayle and Lloyd Bentsen sqaure off in
Omaha on Oct. 5.
   ``It was a good night,'' Democrat Dukakis said after the
90-minute encounter Sunday at Wake Forest University. Bush, his
Republican rival, gave the thumbs-up sign and told cheering
supporters the debate had given him a chance ``to spell out some of
the differences.''
   Dukakis' running mate, Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, and Bush campaign
chairman Baker agreed that neither candidate suffered any
self-inflicted wounds in the debate, and both probably gained
stature.
   ``I don't think either side won, but I think Mike Dukakis came
very close to winning and George Bush came close to losing,''
Bentsen told The Associated Press.
   Baker said the vice president won the debate on style and
substance, and that Dukakis failed on both counts.
   ``We think this debate reaffirmed the contrasts between the
positions of these two candidates that has projected George Bush
into that lead,'' Baker said.
   In the first of two face-to-face meetings, there was very little
warmth between the candidates other than the traditional handshakes
at the beginning and end. Bush said he had hoped for a ``little
friendlier an evening.''
   Dukakis accused him of questioning his patriotism; Bush painted
his opponent as a ``far-out liberal.''
   In terms of issues, the debate broke no new ground but it gave
the candidates _ locked in a close race _ a chance to press their
cases against their opponents before their largest audience ever,
in the tens of millions.
   Trying to capitalize on their debate performances, the two
candidates headed separate ways today, with Bush campaigning in the
South while Dukakis moved North.
   Right from the start in their first debate, Dukakis took an
aggressive stand, accusing the Reagan-Bush administration of doing
business ``with a drug-running Panamanian dictator.''
   In reply, Bush said there was no ``hard evidence'' that
Panamanian leader Manuel Antonio Noriega was involved in drugs
``until we indicted him.''
   Bush attacked Dukakis for his membership in the American Civil
Liberties Union and for vetoing a bill that would have required
public school teachers to lead students in reciting the Pledge of
Allegiance. Bush said Dukakis' judgment was at issue, adding, ``I
hope people don't think that I'm questioning his patriotism.''
   Given a chance to respond, Dukakis coldly declared, ``Of course
the vice president is questioning my patriotism. ... And I resent
it. I resent it.''
   Noting that he was the son of immigrants, Dukakis said, ``I'm in
public service because I love this country. I believe in it. And
nobody's going to question my patriotism as the vice president has
now repeatedly.''
   Bush fired tart words at Dukakis after a question about Quayle
and his qualifications to step into the presidency, if necessary.
   ``Judge the man on his record, not on a lot of rumors and
innuendo and trying to fool around with his name,'' Bush said,
noting that Dukakis frequently refers to his running mate by his
full name of J. Danforth Quayle. Bush said that ``ridiculing a
person's name is a little beneath this process.''
   Dukakis shot back, ``I doubt very much that Dan Quayle was the
best qualified person for that job. And as a matter of fact, I
think for most people the notion of `President Quayle' is a very,
very troubling notion tonight.''
   The two candidates traded a series of one-liners, beginning when
Dukakis claimed Bush was ``the Joe Isuzu of American politics,'' _
referring to television commercials in which the salesman makes
implausible claims for Isuzu cars.
   Bush retorted, ``That answer was about as clear as Boston
Harbor,'' referring to the pollution in Dukakis' hometown.
   While Bush depicted Dukakis as a liberal Democrat ``out of the
mainstream,'' the Democratic nominee challenged the vice
president's judgment, particularly on the Iran-Contra scandal.
   Dukakis said that Bush, the chairman of a task force on
terrorism, ``endorsed the sale of arms to the Ayatollah in exchange
for hostages, one of the most tragic, one of the most mistaken
foreign policy decisions we've ever made in this country, and I
dare say, encourages others to take hostages.''
   In reply, Bush said, ``Yes, we shouldn't trade arms for
hostages, but we have made vast improvements in our
anti-terrorism.'' Going on the attack, Bush said Dukakis opposed
the U.S. military strike against Libya, a claim that Dukakis
protested was not true.
   An Associated Press panel of six veteran debate judges gave
Dukakis a narrow edge over Bush. Three judges thought Dukakis won
and three picked Bush, but the Democrat got the most points
overall. Dukakis got top marks for presentation and organization,
while Bush bested his opponent in refutation and reasoning.

   Two Indian activists went to court today
for their trial on charges of taking hostages at a newspaper in
what they say was an effort to spotlight local corruption, but one
was without his regular lawyer.
   Defense lawyers have said they will argue that Eddie Hatcher and
Timothy Jacobs acted out of necessity when up to 20 people were
taken hostage at The Robesonian on Feb. 1.
   U.S. District Judge Terrence Boyle today denied a request for a
continuance in the trial, even though Hatcher's attorney, William
Kunstler, was not present because he is involved in another trial
in New York. Hatcher had said repeatedly he would not participate
in the trial without Kunstler.
   ``I will not be there,'' Kunstler, famed for his defense of
leftist causes, said last week. ``Eddie will not have a lawyer. He
will, I think ... stand up and tell that jury at every opportunity
that he is there without a lawyer.''
   When he granted a third delay in the case Aug. 1, Boyle warned
Hatcher that he did not intend to continue the case again and said
another lawyer should be prepared to begin the trial if Kunstler
was not present.
   But lawyer Barry Nakell asked the judge today to delay the trial
until Oct. 18, when Kunstler should be through with the other case.
Hatcher has said he does not want Nakell as his attorney at the
trial, though Nakell has represented him in some other hearings.
   The judge turned down Nakell's request.
   The defendants are charged with hostage-taking and manufacturing
illegal weapons.
   Hatcher, 31, and Jacobs, 20, have never denied that they took
over the offices of The Robesonian in Lumberton, but say they did
so to draw attention to their allegations of discrimination against
minorities and drug trafficking by local law enforcement agencies.
   They say they were driven to commit ``an act of desperation''
because their knowledge of the drug trafficking had put their lives
in danger.
   ``We have a necessity defense in this case ... (which) involves
showing that neither Timothy or Eddie had any legal alternatives to
what they did and that they were in fear of their lives on Feb.
1,'' Bob Warren, Jacobs' attorney, said last week.
   The 10-hour siege at the newspaper ended after Gov. Jim Martin
agreed to form a state task force to investigate their charges.
   But Hatcher and Jacobs, who say they are Tuscarora Indians, met
only once with the task force, which issued a preliminary report
saying it had found little evidence to back up their charges.
   Hatcher, Jacobs and their supporters said the task force did not
do a thorough investigation and that potential witnesses would not
testify without federal and state immunity.
   The defendants' lawyers have conducted their own investigation
and say they have potential witnesses who could back up the charges
of official wrongdoing.
   Hatcher disappeared Aug. 31 after a federal appeals court
revoked his bond. Jacobs surrendered to marshals the same day.
Hatcher was arrested at Raleigh-Durham Airport one week ago when he
stepped off a plane with a Kunstler associate.

   Hurricane Helene's winds, a threat only to ships in
the central Atlantic Ocean, dropped to 95 mph today as the storm
continued to move north into colder, strength-sapping waters,
forecasters said.
   ``It's going to gradually weaken from here on in,'' said Jim
Gross, a hurricane specialist at the National Hurricane Center.
``We've estimated it to become a minimal hurricane within the next
72 hours and weaken even further after that.''
   At one time last week, Helene had winds of 140 mph as it kept a
westward course across warm tropical waters, but it then veered
northward.
   At noon EDT today, the storm's center was near latitude 25.3
north and longitude 49.7 west, or about 1,400 miles southwest of
the westernmost Azores. Helene was headed north at 15 mph away from
all land areas for the next few days, according to a center
advisory.
   Hurricanes are composed of strong winds revolving around warm
cores of low pressure fueled in part by the tropical waters that
spawn them. Cold water weakens the storms.
   Helene's northerly course should eventually cause it to die out,
unlike its predecessor Gilbert, which turned its deadly winds west
and grew into a category 5 hurricane _ the strongest possible.
   Gilbert killed more than 300 people, left hundreds of thousands
homeless and caused billions of dollars damage to the Caribbean,
Central America, Mexico and the United States.
   Both storms came out of Africa as disturbed weather systems this
month, the busiest time of the six-month Atlantic Hurricane Season
that begins June 1.
   Helene is the eighth named storm of the 1988 Atlantic hurricane
season, and the fourth with winds exceeding 74 mph, earning it
classification as a hurricane.
   Two other hurricanes, Florence and Debby, caused only minor
damage in Mexico and along the U.S. Gulf Coast.

   Democrat Michael Dukakis said today the first
presidential debate provided the ``the best moments of the whole
campaign,'' and his aides declared him the decisive winner over
Republican rival George Bush.
   ``The American people finally had the chance to look beyond the
slogans and labels, the photo opportunities and the flag-waving,
and get down to the real issues,'' Dukakis said in remarks prepared
for a rally here, his first stop after leaving the debate site,
Winston-Salem, N.C.
   ``We heard a lot of talk last night from Mr. Bush about the
mainstream. But it's clear that he's willing to leave American
families high and dry,'' Dukakis said.
   ``What happened last night was long overdue. Those 90 minutes
were the best moments of this whole campaign,'' he said.
   Susan Estrich, Dukakis' campaign manager, said the Dukakis
campaign's polls ``showed us winning the debate decisively.''
   Estrich, at a briefing in North Carolina before Dukakis departed
on a campaign swing to Ohio and New Jersey, said Dukakis succeeded
in ``dominating the debate virtually from beginning to end,
speaking to the issues of concern to voters sitting around their
kitchen tables.''
   As for Bush, she said, the vice president ``failed to dominate
the debate at all.''
   Paul Brountas, Dukakis' campaign chairman, said the Democratic
nominee ``kept George Bush on defense all night long. He took the
issues, he discussed the issues, he was putting in the innovative
proposals that the working Americans are worried about, their
concerns and anxieties. And I thought that Bush was shaky all night
long.''
   With the first debate behind him, Dukakis was heading out to
campaign in key industrial states that are likely to determine the
outcome of the election.
   On his schedule today were stops in Cleveland and Jersey City,
N.J.
   By the end of the week, the Democratic nominee also will
campaign in Illinois, Pennsylvania, New York, Texas and California.
   On Sunday night, Dukakis went from the debate on the campus of
Wake Forest University to a rally a few miles away in the
Winston-Salem Convention Center where he told supporters, ``The
message tonight that we were able to convey .. was that the
Democratic Party and the Democratic ticket are prepared to provide
leadership on the real challenges that face this country and the
real concerns of Americans all over this country.''
   ``This is going to be a tough, competitive stretch drive,'' he
said of the final six weeks of the presidential campaign.
   Dukakis and Bush will debate again in Los Angeles on Oct. 13 or
Oct. 14, the exact date hinging on the baseball playoff schedule.
   Their running mates _ Democrat Lloyd Bentsen and Republican Dan
Quayle _ will debate in Omaha, Neb., on Oct. 5.
   The Massachusetts governor delivered his strongest response to
date when Bush raised what has become known as the Pledge of
Allegiance issue. Bush has scored heavily by attacking Dukakis for
vetoing legislation that would have required recitation of the
pledge in Massachusetts public schools.
   Bush raised it again during the debate and said he was not
questioning his opponent's patriotism.
   ``Of course, the vice president is questioning my patriotism,''
Dukakis responded. ``I don't think there's any question about that.
And I resent it, I resent it.''
   Bush delivered an impassioned defense of his choice of Quayle
for the Republican ticket.
   ``I'm putting my faith in a whole generation of young people who
are in their thirties and in their forties,'' the vice president
said.
   ``Judge the man on his record, not on a lot of rumors and
innuendo,'' he said, chiding Dukakis for referring to the Indiana
senator as ``J. Danforth Quayle.''
   ``Do you know who J. Danforth was?'' Bush said. ``He was a man
that gave his life in World War II. So ridiculing a person's name
is a little beneath this process.''
   Dukakis didn't give an inch. He said that ``for most people the
notion of `President Quayle' is a very, very troubling notion
tonight.''
   Dukakis also was asked to respond to the perception that he is
``passionless, technocratic _ the smartest clerk in the world.''
   ``I care deeply about people,'' he responded. ``All people,
working people, working families, people all over this country who
in some cases are living from paycheck to paycheck.''
   He recalled his 1978 defeat in the Democratic gubernatorial
primary when he was running for a second term.
   ``Defeat is sometimes an important lesson,'' he said. ``I think
I'm a much better governor today. I think I'm a much better person,
a much better listener. I think I'll be a much better president for
having gone through that experience.''

   Billy Carter, whose escapades as President
Carter's beer-guzzling good ol' boy brother alternately amused and
dismayed Americans, ``struggled courageously'' with the cancer that
killed him, his family says.
   Carter died at home of pancreatic cancer, the same disease that
killed his father and an older sister, on Sunday morning at the age
of 51.
   A few blocks away in this southwestern Georgia hamlet, a flag
flew at half-staff across the street from the gas station where
Carter often downed beers while entertaining reporters with his
irreverent wit.
   ``He had a heart of gold,'' said Becky Gentry, who operated the
station for six months when Carter moved away. ``He made you feel
good just being around him. You never saw a frown on his face.''
   Carter ``died quietly and peacefully in his sleep ... with his
family at his bedside,'' said a statement issued by the Carter
Presidential Center in Atlanta on behalf of the former president
and his family.
   ``He had struggled courageously with his illness, never losing
his sense of humor and always more concerned about those who loved
him than about himself,'' the family said.
   Plains Mayor Lynton Earl Godwin III recalled Carter today as ``a
good person. He was a friend, and the people who were his personal
friends will really miss him.''
   Police Chief Jim Smyth said he expected a large crowd for the
funeral and called in officers from the Georgia State Patrol and
nearby Americus to assist his three-member department in traffic
control.
   Billy Carter, a self-proclaimed beer-drinking good ol' boy, was
forced to redefine himself when big brother Jimmy rocketed into the
White House in 1977.
   Within a few years, Billy Carter put his name on a brand of beer
that flopped, got in hot water with remarks denounced as racist or
anti-Semitic, accepted money from Libya and was forced to sell some
properties to pay a debt to the Internal Revenue Service.
   But underneath the mask of court jester was a perceptive man, an
avid reader, a fighter who refused to go down quietly under the
pressures of alcoholism or cancer.
   He was born William Alton Carter III, on March 29, 1937, the
youngest of four children.
   He grew up in Archery, a child with a stutter and a poor
student. Billy was 13 when the family moved the three miles to
Plains, and 16 when his father died.
   He ran the family peanut business until Jimmy, a Navy officer 13
years his senior, returned home to take over. Billy, chafing under
his brother's reign, quickly married his high school sweetheart,
Sybil, and joined the Marines.
   He later took over the peanut business, turning it into a $5
million operation, as his brother got involved in politics. Billy
Carter also made a stab at politics, running unsuccessfully for
mayor of Plains in 1976.
   His quick, often profane wit made him a hit on the personal
appearance circuit.
   He once said he didn't like sleeping in the White House because
he got lost, ``I couldn't find the bathroom and I'd had 20 beers
before I went to bed.''
   Jimmy Carter stood gamely by his brother, refusing to muzzle
him, joking about Billy Carter's contributions to the beer industry
and assuring reporters his brother was a competent, capable man.
   But the brothers were forced to put some distance between
themselves in 1979, after Billy Carter visited Libya and served as
host for a return visit by Libyan officials. He also disclosed he
had accepted $220,000 from the Libyans.
   In 1979, a federal grand jury investigated whether loans to the
family peanut warehouse were diverted to the presidential campaign,
allegations Billy Carter denied. He spent seven weeks in an alcohol
rehabilitation program that year.
   In 1981, to help pay a $105,000 debt to the IRS, he sold his
Plains home and the gas station. He moved to Alabama, worked as a
mobile home salesman, and returned to Plains in 1986.
   In September 1987, doctors told him he had inoperable cancer of
the pancreas.
   Carter refused to knuckle under, saying he'd get a voodoo doctor
if necessary. He tried a variety of experimental treatments and
lived longer than his doctors expected.
   A graveside funeral service was set for this afternoon at
Lebanon Cemetery, where Carter's mother, Lillian Carter, and his
father, James Earl Carter, are buried.
   In addition to his wife and brother, Carter is survived by six
children, ages 11 to 31, and sister Gloria Carter Spann.

   Deformed and disfigured people came from around
Mexico to a San Diego hospital, lured by promises of better
function and self-esteem, and returned across the border with new
faces, ears or improved hands.
   And it didn't cost them a cent, thanks to churches, a hospital,
a San Diego charity and dozens of medical workers who donated a
20-hour day to conduct back-to-back operations.
   Only those who have seen the medical needs of the poor south of
the border could understand, said nurse Pat Robinson, who
participated in the reconstructive surgical marathon Saturday at
Mercy Hospital.
   ``I have never seen so many children with so many deformities
that haven't been taken care of,'' said Ms. Robinson, who's been in
the field for 30 years.
   Her patients included a 6-year-old girl with a club hand, a
17-year-old girl with a peg of tissue instead of an ear and a
10-month-old baby with a cleft lip dividing her face up to her
eyes. Other patients had club feet and one needed a hip replacement.
   She recalled an operation in which doctors repaired a
40-year-old woman's cleft lip under local anesthesic.
   ``After we finished with her surgery, we helped her hold a
mirror up. She started crying,'' said Ms. Robinson, 50. ``The
change was so noticeable. She felt so good about how she looked.
   ``The doctor gave her his card and she clutched it to her heart.
We all started crying, she was so overcome by gratitude.''
   For the girl without an ear, doctors took a piece of rib and
shaped it to form the external part of the hearing organ. ``That
one took about 2{ hours,'' Ms. Robinson said.
   About 20 surgeons, 12 anesthesiologists and more than 100
nurses, support staff and volunteers participated in the lengthy
session, said Laura Avallone, the hospital's spokeswoman.
   About 30 patients came from as far south as the Mexican state of
Oaxaca, south of Mexico City, for Saturday's operations, Ms.
Robinson said.
   Local churches provided housing the night before the surgeries,
which would have cost upwards of $500,000, officials said. Drug
companies donated all required pharmaceutical materials. The
hospital donated rooms and equipment.
   All but four were returned to Mexico on Sunday with whatever
medical instructions and drugs they needed, Ms. Avallone said. Some
were taken to a Tijuana hospital for observation but most went
home. Those who remained hospitalized at Mercy were in good
condition, she said.
   It was the second such surgical marathon for Mexican patients at
Mercy Hospital, organized with Coad, a San Diego-based
international charitable organization. In February, about 35
patients underwent reconstructive operations.
   Coad, ``helper'' in Spanish, was founded 15 years ago by John M.
Martin of San Diego, a former San Jose construction mogul who
discovered the need for such medical help during a fishing trip in
Mexico.
   He says he has since taken surgical teams to Mexico and Central
America to operate on thousands of people.
   For surgery in San Diego, Martin travels around Mexico to locate
patients with scars or birth defects, takes care of paperwork
including visas, and provides bus transportation.
   ``You could say I have a Christian commitment, but that is not
the real reason _ I do it because I like to do it,'' Martin told
The Tribune of San Diego last week.
   Though weary from Saturday's long hours, Ms. Robinson said she
looked forward to the next Coad event for Mexican patients,
tentatively scheduled for February 1989.
   ``I feel I have something to give and they need it so badly,''
she said. ``It changes their lives. They can be more like a normal
person and feel better about themselves.''

   Italy's train traffic came to a halt Monday
as rail workers struck nationwide to protest a government plan to
reorganize the state-controlled railways. The plan includes massive
layoffs.
   The 24-hour strike, which began at 9 p.m. Sunday, stopped all
trains and alternative bus service gave little relief to the
stranded passengers.
   In Vercelli, in northern Italy, 600 passengers stranded by the
strike smashed windows in one station before riot police ended the
protest.

<TEXT>
   The debate between U.S. presidential candidates
George Bush and Michael Dukakis was broadcast live in some West
European countries for those sufficiently addicted to U.S. politics
to stay up long after midnight.
   The British Broadcasting Corp. televised the entire debate live
as did Austrian Television and Italy's state-run RAI network. The
Austrians aired it in English, while RAI provided simultaneous
translation into Italian.
   In West Germany, the U.S. Armed Forces Network broadcast it live
on radio and television.
   The debate was held too late for Europe's morning newspapers to
comment, but two afternoon dailies were lukewarm.
   ``Overall, Mr. Bush came out better than many people had
expected; but the debate will not have altered the growing
impression, abroad as well as among many Americans, that for the
most powerful job in the world the choice is between two
mediocrities,'' said London's conservative Evening Standard.
   ``This may be a harsh judgment, but if there are impressive
personalities behind the public faces of the two candidates, then
it is high time they escaped from the suffocating embrace of their
marketing men and revealed the humanity behind the hype,'' it said.
   In Paris, the left-leaning Le Monde said there was ``no evident
winner, no revelation on the character of the candidates, and
absolutely nothing new as to their intentions.''
   In his broadcast, Italian TV correspondent Antonello Marescalchi
said: ``The result of the Bush-Dukakis match is still uncertain.
Dukakis was probably better than Bush, but there was no knockout.''
   He added: ``The vice president and the governor said nothing
new. Every issue had already been discussed during the conventions
in Atlanta and New Orleans, and during the electoral campaign.''

<HEAD>Party Meeting Expected To Slow Down Open-Market Reforms</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Communist Party leaders convened a meeting Monday
that was expected to call for a slowdown in market-oriented reforms
that are fueling inflation and economic turmoil in China.
   The official Xinhua News Agency said 162 members of the
175-member Central Committee and several hundred other leading
party members gathered at the Great Hall of the People for the
five-day meeting.
   The agency said General Secretary Zhao Ziyang delivered a speech
outlining China's troubled economic reforms over the next two years.
   Zhao, it said, dealt with ``improving the economic environment
and rectifying the economic order,'' catchwords for a more cautious
stance emphasizing stability rather than new initiatives in the
country's drive to reduce central planning and tie production to
free-market forces.
   Zhao discussed ways to promote reform in a ``planned way and
under unified leadership'' _ an apparent reference to reported
differences within the party on how to cope with current economic
problems.
   The 20 percent inflation _ spurred by rising consumer demand,
profiteering and government moves to end some price subsidies _ has
become a major source of complaint among urban residents.
   Corruption is rampant, industrial output is increasing at double
the rate the economy can sustain, and local governments have
ignored orders from Beijing to cut back on unauthorized spending.
   Fears of further price increases have led to panic buying and
runs on banks in August, with retail sales almost 40 percent higher
than in the same month in 1987.
   Chinese leaders insist they will not turn their backs on reforms
that have significantly improved the lives of millions of Chinese
over the past decade. But they have admitted the reforms have hit a
shoal of doubt and confusion.
   The government has tried to calm consumers and cool off the
economy by promising there will be no more price increases this
year, and by tightening money supplies and linking interest rates
to the inflation rate.
   Vice Premier Yao Yilin, who oversees economic policy, told
visiting Soviet officials on Friday that China will not lift
controls on the prices of grain and other staples. But the policy
of freezing low prices has discouraged farmers from growing grain
crops.
   At the party meeting, Zhao also discussed ``strengthening party
leadership in order to bring the party's political advantage into
full play,'' the Xinhua report said. The 47 million-member party is
trying to improve an image tarnished by corruption within its ranks
and to restore its prestige among a population disenchanted with
ideology and political infighting.
   The Central Committee session may give some indication if Zhao,
the most ambitious of China's top reformers, has been politically
damaged as a result of the nation's economic problems.
   There has been widespread speculation that Premier Li Peng, the
more cautious head of China's government, has eclipsed Zhao as the
nation's top economic planner amid government concerns that a fast
pace of reform could cause economic and social chaos.
   Western diplomats, however, say there is no indication that
Zhao, although he may have lost some prestige, is in serious
political trouble.

   U.S. and Vietnamese officials began
searching northern Vietnamese villages Monday for people who may
have seen plane crashes in which American soldiers were lost more
than 15 years ago, an official said.
   Two joint teams including U.S. military experts drove to the
areas near the capital of Hanoi to try to resolve the fates of
seven airmen downed during the Vietnam War, said Maj. Thomas J.
Boyd, spokesman for the U.S. Pacific Command.
   He said the teams headed out in jeeps the Americans flew in from
Honolulu the previous day, along with metal detectors and other
equipment including forensic instruments in case human remains were
found during the 10-day search.
   ``This is the first joint activity that involves tracking down
of missing in action (MIA) cases,'' he said. ``The teams are
investigating loss incidents that occurred and trying to interview
individuals who may possess information surrounding the incidents.''
   He said the two sides may later excavate any warplane crash
sites that are found during the investigation.
   Previously, the only significant joint field activity was in
late 1985, when U.S. soldiers and Vietnamese state workers dug up
the wreckage of a U.S. B-52 bomber just outside Hanoi but found no
remains.
   Boyd said the teams will try to gather evidence such as the
soldiers' personnel effects and local government reports of the
incidents.
   He said the teams will search an area in Bac Thai and Vinh Phu
provinces, 40 miles northwest of Hanoi, and in Lang Son and Ha Bac
provinces 30 miles to the northeast of the capital. They may later
investigate a third area southeast of Hanoi, he said.
   Boyd said the U.S. side brought in eight motorcycles for the
Vietnamese to scout villages before the joint teams arrive.
   The seven cases are among 70 ``discrepancy cases'' the United
States has asked Vietnam to resolve urgently, claiming there is
evidence the men survived and came under Vietnamese control.
   Washington says it has no evidence they remain alive 15 years
after U.S. forces withdrew from Vietnam.
   ``We hope to accomplish many more joint investigation operations
in Vietnam during this initial 90-day period of joint activity and
continue beyond that time until this issue is resolved as fully as
possible,'' said a statement from the U.S. team leader, Lt. Col.
Joe Harvey. ``We are prepared to provide four teams, if Vietnam
agrees.''
   Harvey earlier called the project a significant breakthrough,
and said joint investigations could resolve all 70 cases.
   A total of 2,393 Americans listed as MIA in the war -- 1,757 in
Vietnam, 547 in Laos, 83 in Cambodia and six in China.
   The war, which cost 58,000 American lives, ended when communist
North Vietnam defeated U.S.-backed South Vietnam in April 1975.

   The unemployment insurance system has enough
reserves to last only five months in a severe recession and would
have to borrow billions of dollars from the federal government to
keep paying benefits, congressional watchdogs said Monday.
   Because states had to borrow $11.8 billion to keep paying
benefits during the 1981-82 recession, most have tightened
eligibility requirements so much that only one of every four
jobless workers in October of last year received unemployment
checks, the General Accounting Office said in a report.
   ``The average proportion of unemployed receiving benefits during
the 1980s has fallen by about 30 percent since the 1950s,'' the GAO
said. ``In 1952, nearly 55 percent of unemployed civilian workers
were receiving benefits; by 1986, only 32 percent received
benefits.''
   Although demographic changes in the workforce explain part of
the decline, the report said the Reagan administration's emphasis
on states repaying the $11.8 billion they borrowed in 1981-82 has
caused at least 44 of them to tighten eligibility requirements.
   As of 1986, the GAO said, state unemployment insurance trusts
still owed the U.S. Treasury a total of $4.8 billion. The combined
state-federal system still had reserves of about $19.4 billion last
year, enough to last about five months in a severe recessions, the
watchdogs said.
   But, they added, recent recessions have tended to last at least
12 months, and the Labor Department recommends that each state
carry sufficient reserves to pay benefits for 18 months.
   While 39 states had adequate reserves in 1969, no more than two
states have had sufficient funds in any year since 1976 to deal
with a recession without borrowing from the federal Treasury, the
report said.
   The state-federal system was created as part of the New Deal to
help cushion the blow of the Depression on laid off workers. The
program is designed to be self-sufficient, with the federal
government assumes the cost of administration while states pay the
actual benefits with funds raised through a payroll tax on
employers.
   Because states have been trimming benefits and tightening
eligibility, the GAO questioned the system's ability to ``stabilize
the economy and mitigate the effects of income loss suffered by the
unemployed'' in the next recession.
   The report suggested that unless Congress somehow eases the
burden, the country may see ``greater tax increases and larger
benefit reductions in the regions that have experienced the least
favorable economic conditions.''

   Here is the text of remarks by
President Reagan to the 43rd General Asssembly Monday.
   Mr. President, Mr. Secretary-General, distinguished delegates.
Half a world away _ far from this place of peace _ the firing, the
killing, the bloodshed in two merciless conflicts have for the
first time in recent memory diminished. After adding terrible new
names to the roll call of human horror _ names such as Halabja,
Maidan Shahr, and Spin Buldak _ there is today hope of peace in the
Persian Gulf and Afghanistan.
   So, too, in the highlands and coastal cities of southern Africa
_ places of civil war, places of occupation by foreign troops _
talk of peace is heard, peace for the tortured nation of Angola.
Six thousand five hundred miles further east, in the Southeast
Asian country of Cambodia, there is hope now of a settlement, hope
now of the removal of Vietnam's occupying forces. And finally in
this hemisphere, where only 12 years ago one-third of the people of
Latin America lived under democratic rule, some 90 percent do so
today; and especially in Central America, nations such as El
Salvador, once thratened by the anarchy of the death squad and the
specter of totalitarian rule, now know the hope of self-government
and the prospect of eocnomic growth.
   And, another change, Mr. Secretary-General. A change that if it
endures may go down as one of the signal accomplishments of our
history _ a change that is cause for shaking of the head in wonder
_ is also upon us. A change going to the source of post-war
tensions, and to the once seemingly impossible dream of ending the
twin threats of our time _ totalitarianism and thermonuclear world
war.
   For the first, time, the differences between East and West _
fundamental differences over important moral questions dealing with
the worth of the individual and whether governments shall control
people or people control governments _ for the first time, these
differences ahve shown signs of easing. Easing to the point where
there are not just troop withdrawals from places like Afghanistan
but also talk in the East of reform and greater freedom of press,
of assembly, and of religion. Yes, fundamental differences remain.
But should talk of reform become more than that, should it become
reality _ there is the prospect of not only a new era in
Soviet-American relations but a new age of world peace. For such
reform can bring peace; history teaches and my country has always
believed that where the rights of the individual and the people are
enshrined, war is a distant prospect; for it is not people who make
war, governments do that.
   I stand at this podium then in a moment of hope. Hope, not just
for the peoples of the United States or the Soviet Union but for
all the peoples of the world. And hope, too, for the dream of peace
among nations, the dream that began the United Nations.
   Precisely because of these changes, today, the United Nations
has the opportunity to live and breathe and work as never before.
Already, you, Mr. Secretary-General, through your persistence,
patience, and unyielding will, have shown, in working toward peace
in Afghanistan and the Persian Gulf, how valuable the United
Nations can be. We salute you for those accomplishments.
   And in Geneva at this very hour, there are numerous negotiations
underway: multilateral negotiations at the Conference on
Disarmament as well as bilateral negotiations on a range of issues
between the Soviets and ourselves. And these negotiations, some of
them under U.N. auspices, involve a broad arms control agenda;
strategic offensive weapons; strategic defense and space; nuclear
testing; and chemical warfare _ whose urgency we have witnessed
anew in recent days.
   And, Mr. Secretary-General, the negotiators are busy _ and over
the past few years they have been engaged in more than an academic
exercise. There is movement. The logjam is broken. Only recently,
when the United States and the Soviet Union signed the INF
agreement, an entire class of U.S. and Soviet nuclear missiles was
eliminated for the first time in history. Progress continues on
negotiations to reduce, in massive number, strategic weapons with
effective verification. And talks will begin soon on conventional
reductions in Europe.
   Much of the reason for all of this goes back, I believe, to
Geneva itself; to the small chateau along the lake where I and the
General Secretary of the Soviet Union had the first of several
fireside chats _ exchanges characterized by frankness, but
friendliness, too. I said at the first meeting in Geneva that this
was a unique encounter between two people who had the power to
start World War III or to begin a new age of peace among nations.
And I also said peace conferences, arms negotiations, proposals for
treaties could make sense only if they were part of a wider context
_ a context that sought to explore and resolve the deeper,
underlying differences between us. I said to Mr. Gorbachev then, as
I have said to you before: Nations do not mistrust each other
because they are armed, they are armed because they mistrust each
other.
   In that place, by that peaceful lake in neutral Switzerland, Mr.
Grobachev and I did begin a new relationship based not just on
engagement over the single issue of arms control, but on a broader
agenda about our deeper differences; an agenda of human rights,
regional conflicts, and bilateral exchanges between our peoples.
Even on the arms control issue itself, we agree to go beyond the
past. To seek not just treaties that permit building weapons to
higher levels, but revolutionary agreements that actually reduced,
and even eliminated, a whole class of nuclear weapons.
   What was begun that morning in Geneva has shown results. In the
INF treaty. In my recent visit to Moscow. In my opportunity to meet
there with Soviet citizens and dissidents and speak of human
rights. And to speak, too, in the Lenin Hills of Moscow to the
young people of the Soviet Union about the wonder and splendor of
human freedom. The results of that morning in Geneva are seen in
peace conferences now under way around the world on regional
conflicts; and in the work of the U.N. here in New York as well as
in Geneva.
   But Mr. Secretary-General, history teaches caution; indeed, that
very building in Geneva, where important negotiations have taken
place _ the Geneva Accords on Afghanistan, the Iran-Iraq
negotiations, for example _ we see it today as stone-like testimony
to a failed dream of peace in another time. The Palais des Nations
was the headquarters of the League of Nations _ an institution that
was to symbolize an end to all war. And yet that institution and
its noble purpose ended with the Second World War, ended because
the chance for peace was not seized in the 1930s by the nations of
the world, ended because humanity did not find the courage to
isolate the aggressors, to reject schemes of government that serve
the state, not the people.

   Police on Tuesday will question two
U.S. Olympic swimmers who are accused of stealing a marble lion's
head from a Seoul hotel. Angry South Koreans are demanding the pair
be sent to prison.
   Police officials were quoted by Seoul newspapers as saying the
men _ Doug Gjertsen and Troy Dalbey _ will not receive any special
consideration when they are questioned about the theft Saturday of
the $830 ornament.
   The decision on whether to prosecute the Americans will be made
by the prosecutor's office after police submit a report.
   Gjertsen and Dalbey, who each won two gold medals, could be
sentenced to 1-10 years in prison if convicted on charges of
aggravated theft.
   U.S. Olympic officials said the incident was a foolish prank and
kicked the pair off the American team.
   Police and Seoul newspapers said Monday they have been flooded
with calls from irate people demanding the two Americans receive
prison sentences.
   Newpapapers, which referred to the incident under the headline
``Ugly Americans,'' said many readers were calling to complain, and
the publications backed the calls for tough treatment.
   The newspapers continued to bristle with denunciations of U.S.
press coverage of the Olympics and South Korea. Commentators
charged the U.S. media was trying to blacken the nation's image.
   The influential Chosun Ilbo said in an editorial, ``The theft
case involving the U.S. swimmers clearly shows the overbearing
attitude of Americans.''
   Newspapers compared the swimmers to a brawl on Thursday when
South Korean boxing officials attacked a referee after a Bulgarian
boxer was named the winner over local favorite Byun Jong-il.
   Byun and some officials were suspended for the incident.
   ``The U.S. media should know that such incidents have greatly
hurt the pride of the Korean people who have worked hard to prepare
for the Olympic Games for the past seven years, and as a result it
is proliferating anti-American sentiments,'' said newspaper
commentator Chung Tong-woo.
   The Korean media and some government politicians have played up
the arrest of the swimmers in an apparent attempt to divert
attention from the boxing incident.
   The media and many people have denounced NBC for its coverage of
the incident, claiming the American network played it up to
embarrass South Korea.
   Newspapers have complained that the U.S. media failed to focus
on the incident involving the swimmers in the same way that it
dwelt on the boxing incident.
   ``How is NBC, which reported the momentary violent act in the
boxing in such a manner, going to explain the theft case involving
athletes from its own country?'' Joong-Ang Ilbo said.
   The boxing incident was extensively covered by television around
the world. But NBC is the only foreign network seen in South Korea,
where it is shown on a U.S. military network.
   The United States is South Korea's main ally, but there has been
some tension between the two nations over trade and political
issues.
   Some South Koreans claim Americans want to dominate them, but
many observers say Korean resentment reflects growing pains as it
emerges from years of dependence on Washington.

   Sales of existing single-family homes
increased a modest 1.1 percent in August to the second-highest
level of the year as buyers tried to close purchases before
interest rates rose further, a real estate trade group said Monday.
   The National Association of Realtors said sales of existing
homes rose to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.67 million
units last month, following a sharp 5.0 percent decline in July.
Except for the 3.82 million rate in June, the August pace was the
fastest in 15 months.
   John Savacool, an economist with the Wefa Group, a Bala Cynwyd,
Pa., forecasting firm, said buyers completing sales in August
probably began looking for homes in May and June.
   ``That was just after rates started rising,'' he said. The
increase ``was a mild panic response to rising rates.''
   Fixed-rate mortgages dipped below 10 percent in February and
March and have since risen to about 10.5 percent as the Federal
Reserve Board fought inflation through higher interest rates. Many
economists expect rates to top 11 percent by early next year.
   ``Basically, what we're seeing here is the movement of
households into the market now to avoid what they perceive to be
deteriorating conditions. This has persisted through the summer,''
said John A. Tuccillo, chief economist of the real estate
association.
   He predicted sales will decline the rest of the year, bringing
them for all of 1988 to 3.45 million units, a 2.1 percent decline
from 1987.
   Savacool said stronger-than-expected resales so far this year
are a reflection of a robust economy in general.
   ``We've gone a nice long time with a good strong housing market.
... We've had a few declines, but we're still looking at a pretty
strong market,'' he said.
   After hitting a low of 1.99 million units in the recession year
of 1982, resales climbed to a record high of 3.56 million units in
1986. Savacool said sales likely would decline next year as
interest rates rise in the first half, but then recover in 1990.
   All of the strength in August came in the South, where sales
rose 4.4 percent to an annual rate of 1.42 million units,
rebounding from a 4.2 percent decline in July.
   In the Northeast, sales fell 2.9 percent to a 670,000-unit rate,
following a 6.8 percent decline in July.
   Sales were unchanged in the Midwest and West, at 910,000 units
and 650,000 units, respectively.
   Analysts have attributed the softening of sales in the Northeast
to high prices and to the effects of the October stock market crash
on employment in financial service industries.
   Sales in the Midwest, they say, are beginning to pick up, a
reflection of the strong manufacturing economy.
   The median price of a home rose from July to August by $600 to
$91,300, up 5.5 percent from a year ago when the median sales price
for an existing home was $86,500.
   The Northeast remained the costliest region of the country, with
a median sales price of $144,800 last month, up 6.7 percent from a
year ago. It was followed by a median price of $122,000 in the
West, up 6.0 percent from a year ago; $84,300 in the South, up 4.3
percent; and $70,500 in the Midwest, up 6.0 percent.

<HEAD>Burmese Government Urges Student Dissidents To End Protest</HEAD>

   Top officials appealed Monday to parents
and teachers to stop dissident students from going underground and
linking up with ethnic insurgents to fight the military-led
government.
   Also Monday, the governing party chose a new name in what one
diplomat described as an attempt to change its tarnished image.
   In recent months, millions of people have engaged in street
demonstrations, strikes and other acts of opposition to the Burma
Socialist Program Party and the 26 years of political repression
and economic decline associated with it.
   State-run Radio Rangoon announced the party was changing its
name to the National Unity Party but did not say why.
   A Western diplomat in Bangkok, Thailand, speaking on condition
of anonymity, described the move as an attempt ``to change their
image (and) make a break with the past.''
   Students were among the leaders of the anti-government
demonstrations. Many have gone underground since Gen. Saw Maung
seized power from a civilian president in a military coup Sept. 18,
and security forces, by government count, have killed more than 250
civilians in the crackdown that followed.
   The government described many of those killed as looters.
   Diplomats believe far more than 250 people died during the
crackdown, including unarmed demonstrators who marched the day
after the coup.
   Rangoon remained quiet Monday, although troops stopped all cars
for security checks in the capital's downtown.
   ``Some students, being misled by unscrupulous people, have gone
underground and several others are preparing to follow suit,''
acting Education Minister Pe Thein said in an appeal broadcast
Monday night on state-run Radio Rangoon.
   ``Parents are asked to prevent their children from being misled
by unscrupulous people,'' he said.
   The army commander, Lt. Gen. Than Shwe, issued a similar radio
address, urging parents and teachers to stop students from going
into hiding or linking up with rebel groups seeking autonomy in
Burma.
   ``The army has no intention to take any action against students,
except those who had committed specific criminal offenses,'' he
said.
   A spokesman for Burma's strongest ethnic rebel group, the Karen
National Union, said Saturday that 90 student protesters fled to
his group's border base camps where they may get military training.
Border security officials in Thailand have reported students
crossing the frontier in recent days.
   The main ongoing anti-government activity is a general strike
that began Aug. 8 and has paralyzed Burma. Authorities have ordered
civil servants to return to work by Monday.
   Saw Maung has pledged to hold multiparty elections once peace is
restored to the impoverished nation, but he has set no timetable.
The last such elections were held in 1960.
   Three key opposition leaders _ Aung Gyi, Tin Oo and Aung San Suu
Kyi _ formed an umbrella group Saturday to unite the millions of
students, Buddhist monks, government workers and others struggling
for democracy. The group have called for a non-partisan interim
government to conduct the elections.

<HEAD>UNITED NATIONS: the people.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   We are here today, Mr. Secretary-General, determined that no
such fate shall befall the United Nations. We are determined that
the U.N. should succeed and serve the cause of peace for humankind.
   So, Mr. Secretary-General, we realize that, even in this time of
hope, the chance of failure is real. But this knowledge does not
discourage us. It spurs us on. For the stakes are high: Do we
falter and fail now and bring down upon ourselves the just anger of
future generations? Or do we continue the work of the founders of
this institution and see to it that, at last, freedom is enshrined
and humanity knows war no longer. And that this place, this floor
shall be truly ``the world's last battlefield.''
   We are determined it shall be so. So we turn now to the agenda
of peace. Let us begin by addressing a concern that was much on my
mind when I met with Mr. Gorbachev in the Kremlin as well as on the
minds of Soviet citizens I met in Moscow. It is also an issue that
I know is of immediate importance to the delegates of this assembly
who, this fall, commemorate the 40th anniversary of the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights.
   That declaration says plainly what those who seek peace can
forget only at the greatest peril, that peace rests on one
foundation: observing ``the inalienable rights of all members of
the human family.'' In a century where human rights have been
denied by totalitarian governments on a scale never before seen in
history _ with so many millions deliberately starved or eliminated
as a matter of state policy _ a history, it has been said, of
blood, stupidity, and barbed wire _ few can wonder why peace has
proved so elusive.
   Let us understand. If we would have peace, we must acknowledge
the elementary rights of our fellow human beings. In our own land.
And in other lands. If we would have peace, the trampling of the
human spirit must cease. Human rights is not for some, some of the
time. Human rights, as the universal declaration of this assembly
adopted in 1948 proclaims, is: ``for all people and all nations.''
And for all time.
   This regard for human rights as the foundation of peace is at
the heart of the U.N. Those who starve in Ethiopia, those who die
among the Kurds, those who face racial injustice in South Africa,
those who still cannot write or speak freely in the Soviet Union,
those who cannot worship in the Ukraine, those who struggle for
life and freedom on boats in the South China Sea, those who cannot
publish or assemble in Managua _ all of this is more than just an
agenda item on your calendar. It must be a first concern; an issue
above others. For when human rights concerns are not paramount at
the United Nations _ when the Universal Declaration of Human Rights
is not honored in these halls and meeting rooms _ then the very
credibility of this organization is at stake, the very purpose of
its existence in question.
   That is why when human rights progress is made, the United
Nations grows stronger and the United States is glad of it.
Following a two-year effort led by the United States, for example,
the U.N. Human Rights Commission took a major step toward ending
the double standards and cynicism that had characterized too much
of its past. For years, Cuba, a blatant violator of its citizens'
human rights, has escaped U.N. censure or even scrutiny. This year,
Cuba has responded to pressure generated by the Human Rights
Commission by accepting an investigation into its human rights
abuses. Fidel Castro has already begun to free some political
prisoners, improve prison conditions, and tolerate the existence of
a small, independent national human rights group.
   More must be done; the United Nations must be relentless and
unyielding in seeking change. In Cuba and elsewhere. And we must
also see to it that the universal declaration itself should not be
debased with episodes like the ``Zionism is Racism'' Resolution.
Respect for human rights is the first and fundamental mission of
this body, the most elementary obligation of its members. Indeed,
wherever one turns in the world today there is new awareness, a
growing passion for human rights _ the people of the world grow
united; new groups, new coalitions form; coalitions that monitor
government, that work against discrimination, that fight religious
or political repression, unlawful imprisonment, torture or
execution. As those I spoke to at Spaso House said to me last June:
such movements make a difference.
   Turning now to regional conflicts, we feel again the uplift of
hope. In the gulf war between Iran and Iraq _ one of the bloodiest
conflicts since World War II _ we have a cease-fire. The resolution
and the firmness of the allied nations in keeping the Persian Gulf
open to international shipping not only upheld the rule of law, it
helped prevent further spread of the conflict and laid the basis
for peace. So, too, the Security Council's decisive resolution in
July a year ago has become the blueprint for a peaceful gulf. Let
this war _ a war in which there has been no victor or vanquished,
only victims _ let this war end now. Let both Iran and Iraq
cooperate with the Secretary-General and the Security Council in
implementing Resolution 598. Let peace come.
   Moving on to a second region _ when I first addressed the U.N.
General Assembly in 1983, world attention was focused on the brutal
invasion and illegal occupation of Afghanistan. After nearly nine
long years of war, the courage and determination of the Afghan
people and the Afghan freedom fighters have held sway _ today, an
end to the occupation is in sight. On April 14, the U.S.S.R. signed
the Geneva Accords, which were negotiated under U.N. auspices by
Pakistan and the Kabul regime. We encourage the Soviet Union to
complete its troop withdrawal at the earliest possible date so that
the Afghan people can freely determine their future without further
outside interference.
   In southern Africa, too, years of patient diplomacy and support
for those in Angola who seek self-determination are having their
effect. We look forward to an accord between the governments of
Angola, Cuba, and South Africa that will bring about a complete
withdrawal of all foreign troops _ primarily Cuban _ from Angola.
We look forward as well to full implementation of U.N. Security
Council Resolution 435 and our longstanding goal of independence
for Namibia. We continue to support a growing consensus among
African leaders who also believe there can be no reconciliation
within Angola.
   Mr. Secretary-General, there are new hopes for Cambodia, a
nation whose freedom and independence we seek just as avidly as we
sought the freedom and independence of Afghanistan. We urge the
rapid removal of all Vietnamese troops and a settlement that will
prevent the return of the Khmer Rouge to power, permitting instead
the establishment of a genuinely representative government _ a
government that will, at last, respect fully the rights of the
people of Cambodia and end the hideous suffering they have so
bravely and needlessly borne.
   In other critical areas, we applaud the Secretary-General's
efforts to structure a referendum on the Western Sahara. And in the
Mediterranean, direct talks between the Greek and Turkish Cypriot
communities hold much promise for accord in that divided island
nation. Finally, we look to a peaceful solution to the Arab-Israeli
conflict. So, too, the unnatural division of Europe remains a
critical obstacle to Soviet-American relations.

<HEAD>Seven Priests Ordained By Lefebvre Bishop, First Since Split</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ECONE, Switzerland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre's
traditionalist movement ordained seven new priests, the first since
it formally split with the Roman Catholic Church in June, a member
of the movement said Monday.
   The ordination Sunday was performed by one of the new bishops,
Bernard Tissier de Mallerais, with Lefebvre in attendance, said a
member of the St. Pius X Fraternity identifying himself as Brother
Michel.
   Six of the new priests are French and one is Italian, he said.
   Lefebvre, whose movement campaigns against reforms which he says
are spreading the ``cancer of liberalism'' in the church, on June
30 consecrated four bishops without papal approval.
   The Vatican condemned the consecrations as as act of schism, a
formal break with the Holy See. It announced that Lefebvre and the
four bishops were automatically excommunicated, or ejected from the
church, for refusing to submit to papal authority.
   It was the first schism since 1870, when Old Catholics split
with the Vatican over the dogma of papal infallibility.
   Lefebvre, 82, said he consecrated the bishops to ordain priests
in his movement after he died.
   He set up his first seminary in 1970 in the Swiss Alps,
rejecting several changes of the Second Vatican Council in 1962-65.
Lebebvre named it after Pope Pius X, who condemned the modernist
``Le Sillon'' movement in 1910.
   In 1976, Pope Paul VI suspended him from his priestly functions
after Lefebvre continued to celebrate Mass in Latin, rather than in
the vernacular.
   Lefebvre ignored the sanction. He has since ordained more than
220 traditionalist priests, and seminaries of his movement operate
worldwide.

<HEAD>Ethics and Race on the Agenda in N.C. Governor's Race</HEAD>

<DATELINE>RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lt. Gov. Bob Jordan has launched an
offensive depicting Republican Gov. Jim Martin's administration as
riddled with ethical shortcomings as polls show Martin pulling
ahead in his re-election bid.
   Martin, in turn, has questioned Jordan's respect for the Rev.
Martin Luther King Jr. and criticized the Democratic challenger for
telling blacks he could not support their views publicly for fear
of alienating ``the white redneck vote.''
   Martin, a former congressman who rode President Reagan's
coattails to victory in 1984, is the second GOP governor elected
this century in North Carolina and would be the first re-elected in
state history.
   Jordan is a 55-year-old lumber mill executive.
   In North Carolina, the governor and lieutenant governor run
separately. There have been disagreements between Martin and Jordan
throughout their term on issues from highway funding to veto power
for the governor.
   But their longest battle was over the budget, which in North
Carolina must be balanced. Jordan accused Martin of being
irresponsible in turning in an unbalanced budget. Martin responded
that he had no way of knowing when he submitted his budget that
changes in tax collections would make it unbalanced.
   Both are moderates with strong business ties who emphasize
education, highway expansion, economic growth and environmental
protection. They expect to spend $5 million each, a state record
for a two-candidate gubernatorial race.
   Some insiders said the average voter probably cannot see much
difference between the two.
   A Charlotte Observer poll Sept. 11-14 gave Martin 51 percent
support to Jordan's 43 percent among 802 voters surveyed. The
margin of error was plus or minus 3.5 percentage points. The
paper's poll in May saw the race as a dead heat.
   A survey for The News and Observer of Raleigh gave Martin an
even bigger lead. Of 806 likely voters interviewed Sept. 11-13, 47
percent favored Martin, 36.4 percent Jordan and 16.6 percent were
undecided. The margin of error was 3.5 points.
   In mid-September, Jordan went on the attack, accusing Martin of
``cynical manipulation of government for political purposes.''
   During his tenure Martin weakened the state financial disclosure
rule and stacked environmental protection commissions with
developers who had conflicts of interest, Jordan charged.
   He accused Martin of giving jobs to spouses of top aides, buying
a leading Democrat's support with a $329-a-day role as an adviser
and making one department ``a tax-paid campaign headquarters'' and
another ``a graveyard for defeated Republican candidates.''
   ``Part of leadership is who you surround youself with, whether
or not you protect the public trust,'' Jordan said. ``Jim Martin is
a nice fellow. But that doesn't mean he is a good governor.''
   Martin called the attacks ``a smear.''
   ``He (Jordan) is a decent enough guy that he will be ashamed of
himself for trying to impugn my ethics,'' Martin said.
   Merle Black, political science professor at the University of
North Carolina at Chapel Hill, said Jordan was being more
aggressive because his positive approach had been ineffective.
   ``He's got to poke some holes in Martin's armor,'' Black said.
``He's got to develop reasons for the voters why Martin ought to be
removed from office.''
   Earlier this month, Jordan cried foul over a radio commercial
Martin aired on black-oriented stations.
   The spot consisted of a conversation in a fictitious barbershop.
It said Jordan declined Martin's offer to be chairman of a
commission planning activities for the state Martin Luther King Jr.
holiday. ``I wonder what Bob Jordan has against Martin Luther
King,'' it said.
   The ad did not mention that Jordan supported a 1987 bill
establishing the holiday while Martin opposed it. Jordan aides
called the commercial sleazy and a black commission member resigned
in protest.
   Earlier this year, Jordan told a group of black newspaper
executives he agreed with them on some issues that he could not
discuss publicly for fear of alienating ``the white redneck vote.''
   Martin has needled his opponent by telling audiences he wants
their votes ``regardless of your race, creed or the color of your
neck.''
   ``We're not writing off the black vote and we're not going to
let them (Democrats) take it for granted,'' the governor said.
   About 20 percent of the state's 3.2 million registered voters
are black.

<HEAD>Swope Completes Cross-State Trip In Less Than 24 Hours</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ASHLAND, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former cancer patient says he surprised
even himself when he took less than a day to ride his bicycle
across most of the length of Kentucky to raise money for the
American Cancer Society.
   Brad Swope arrived in this northeastern Kentucky city about 4:30
a.m. EDT Monday, approximately 400 miles from Paducah in western
Kentucky, where he began his trek at 7 a.m. EDT Sunday.
   ``I thought I would take every minute of 24 hours. I think
everybody did,'' Swope said.
   ``There was a lot of energy and poignance attached to this
effort,'' he said. ``I couldn't have done it just to do it. I
needed a mission like the American Cancer Society.''
   Swope believed he reached his goal of raising $20,000 in
individual and corporate pledges for cancer research.
   ``The money hasn't been tallied,'' said crew chief Tim Omer,
``but we're expecting to meet our goal.''
   Swope, 38, of Louisville, experienced no health problems during
his ride but planned to rest for two to three days, Omer said.
   Swope was diagnosed as having malignant melanoma _ a form of
skin cancer _ three years ago. Doctors removed a growth from his
back and told him they felt certain they got it all, he said in a
pre-ride interview.
   The 5-foot-8, 136-pound athlete said he undertook the trip
because he ``wanted others to know that people can recover and be
cured from cancer.''
   Swope said hills and fog that covered much of the state Monday
morning made the last 50 miles of the trip the toughest. ``The
terrain was a nightmare,'' he said.
   Swope added that a 12 mph headwind in the western section of the
state caught him by surprise but, in the end, did not affect the
outcome.
   ``Cyclists are almost like sailors, we always watch the wind ...
especially if you weigh 136 pounds and are riding a 19-pound
bike,'' he said. ``But it wasn't the negative factor I thought it
would be. It just became a matter of time and distance.''
   Swope's wife Ann is glad it's over.
   ``It's been a long three months (of intense training),'' she
said. ``Now we can go on to other things.''
   ``It's going to be kind of strange to go home,'' she added.
``We'll probably sit there and say `Now what to we do?'''

   In most of these areas, then, we see progress and, again, we are
glad of it. Only a few years ago, Mr. Secretary-General, all of
these and other conflicts were burning dangerously out of control.
Indeed, the invasion of Afghanistan and the apparent failure of
will among democratic and peace-loving nations to deter such events
seemed to cause a climate where aggression by nations large and
small was epidemic, a climate the world had not seen since the
1930s. Only this time, larger war was avoided, avoided because the
free and peaceful nations of the world recovered their strength of
purpose and will. And now the United Nations is providing valuable
assistance in helping this epidemic to recede.
   And because we are resolved to keep it so, I would be remiss in
my duty if I did not now take note here of the one exception to
progress in regional conflicts. I refer to the continuing
deterioration of human rights in Nicaragua and the refusal of the
tiny elite now ruling that nation to honor promises of democracy
made to their own people and to the international community. This
elite _ in calling itself revolutionary _ seeks no real revolution;
the use of the term is subterfuge, deception for hiding the oldest,
most corrupt vice of all _ man's age-old will to power, his lust to
control the lives and steal the freedom of others.
   That is why, as president, I will continue to urge the Congress
and the American public to stand behind those who resist this
attempt to impose a totalitarian regime on the people of Nicaragua;
that the United States will continue to stand with those who are
threatened by this regime's aggression against its neighbors in
Central America.
   Today, I also call on the Soviet Union to show in Central
America the same spirit of constructive realism it has shown in
other regional conflicts. To assist in bringing conflict in Central
America to a close by halting the flow of billions of dollars worth
of arms and ammunition to the Sandinista regime, a regime whose
goals of regional domination _ while ultimately doomed _ can
continue to cause great suffering to the people of that area and
risk to Soviet-American relations. Unless action is taken now.
   Moving now to the arms reduction agenda, I have mentioned
already the importance of the INF treaty and the momentum developed
in the START negotiations. The draft START treaty is a lengthy
document, filled with bracketed language designating sections of
disagreement between the two sides. But through this summer in
Geneva, those brackets have diminished; there is every reason to
believe this process can continue. I can tell this Assembly that it
is highly doubtful such a treaty can be accomplished in a few
months, but I can tell you a year from now is a possibility, more
than a possibility. But we have no deadline. No agreement is better
than a bad agreement. The United States remains hopeful and we
acknowledge the spirit of cooperation shown by the Soviet Union in
these negotiations. We also look for that spirit to be applied to
our concerns about compliance with existing agreements.
   So, too, our discussions on nuclear testing and defense and
space have been useful. But let me here stress to the General
Assembly that much of the momentum in nuclear arms control
negotiations is due to technological progress itself, especially in
the potential for space-based defensive systems. I believe that the
United States determination to research and develop and, when
ready, deploy such defensive systems _ systems targeted to destroy
missiles, not people _ accounts for a large share of the progress
made in recent years in Geneva. With such systems, for the first
time, in case of accidental launch or the act of a madman
somewhere, major powers will not be faced with the single option of
massive retaliation, but will instead have the chance of a saner
choice _ to shield against an attack instad of avenging it. So,
too, as defensive systems grow in effectiveness, they reduce the
threat and the value of greater and greater offensive arsenals.
Only recently, briefings I have received in the Oval Office
indicate that progress toward such systems may be even more rapid
and less costly than we had at first thought. Today, the United
States reaffirms its commitment to its Strategic Defense Initiative
and our offer to share the benefits of strategic defenses with
others.
   And yet, even as diplomatic and technological progess holds out
the hope of at last diminishing the awful cloud of nuclear terror
we have lived under in the post-war era, even at this moment
another ominous terror is loose once again in the world. A terror
we thought the world had put behind, a terror that looms at us now
from the long, buried past; from ghostly, scarring trenches and the
haunting, wan faces of millions dead in one of the most inhumane
conflicts of all time.
   Poison gas. Chemical warfare. Mr. Secretary-General,
distinguished delegates, the terror of it. The horror of it. We
condemn it. The use of chemical weapons in the Iran-Iraq war _
beyond its tragic human toll _ jeopardizes the moral and legal
strictures that have held these weapons in check since World War I.
Let this tragedy spark reaffirmation of the Geneva signatories to
that protocol, as well as other concerned states, to convene a
conference to consider actions that we can take together to reverse
the serious erosion of this treaty. And we urge all nations to
cooperate in negotiating a verifiable, truly global ban on chemical
weapons at the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva.
   It is incumbent upon all civilized nations to ban, once and for
all _ and on a verifiable and global basis _ the use of chemical
and gas warfare.
   Finally, Mr. Secretary-General, we must redouble our efforts to
stop further proliferation of nuclear weapons in the world.
Likewise, proliferation in other high-technology weapons such as
ballistic missiles is reaching global proportions, exacerbating
regional rivalries in ways that can have global implications. The
number of potential suppliers is growing at an alarming rate and
more must be done to halt the spread of these weapons. This was a
matter of discussion last week between Secretary Shultz and Foreign
Minister Shevardnadze. Talks between American and Soviet experts
begin on this today. And we hope to see a multilateral effort, to
avoid having areas of tension like the Middle East become even more
deadly battlegrounds than they already are.
   But in most of these areas, we see not only progress but also
the potential for an incrasingly vital role for multilateral
efforts and institutions like the United Nations. That is why now
more than ever the United Nations must continue to increase its
effectiveness through budget and program reform. The U.N. already
is enacting sweeping measures affecting personnel reductions,
budgeting by consensus, and the establishment of program
priorities. These actions are extremely important. The progress on
reforms has allowed me to release funds withheld under
congressional restrictions. I expect the reform program will
continue and that further funds will be released in our new fiscal
year.
   And let me say here we congratulate the United Nations on the
work it has done in three areas of special concern. First, our
struggle against the scourge of terrorism and state-sponsored
terrorism must continue. And we must also end the scourge of
hostage taking. Second, the work of the World Health Organization
in coordinating and advancing research on AIDS is vital. All
international efforts in this area must be redoubled. The AIDS
crisis is a grave one; we must move as one to meet it.
   So, too, is the drug crisis. We are moving now toward a new
anti-drug trafficking convention. This important treaty will be
completed in December. I am confident other strong U.N. drug
control programs will also follow. The American people are
profoundly concerned, deeply angered. We will not tolerate the drug
traffickers. We mean to make war on them _ and we believe this is
one war the United Nations can endorse and participate in.

   A burglar who may have spent the night hiding in
locked St. Patrick's Cathedral stole cash from a collection box and
escaped before dawn Monday, one week after a killing in the
landmark church, police said.
   Capt. Barry Noxon said two janitors saw the man breaking into
the box at about 4 a.m. They did not see him leave but police were
unable to find him, Noxon said.
   The doors were locked at the time of the burglary and Noxon said

   Noxon said ``it doesn't appear he got away with very much.''
   Cardinal John J. O'Connor, who lives in the attached rectory,
was assigned around-the-clock police protection last week after a
deranged naked man killed an usher in the cathedral. The assailant
was killed by a police bullet.
   In February 1987, two men ransacked O'Connor's bedroom and
private office while he was out of town. Two armed men stole $7,000
from cathedral ushers on Nov. 30, 1985, said archdiocese spokesman
Joseph Zwilling.

<HEAD>With AM-Botha-10 Years, Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID CRARY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government Monday
identified a group of ``whites only'' areas that could become South
Africa's first legally integrated neighborhoods.
   Tens of thousands of non-whites already live illegally in the
districts named in Parliament by Constitutional Planning Minister
Chris Heunis.
   Heunis listed districts in and near Johannesburg, Cape Town,
Durban and Port Elizabeth when he reintroduced a package of
legislation dealing with the Group Areas Act, which segregates all
neighborhoods by race.
   Neighborhoods are to become multiracial only where a majority of
residents approve or where integration has occurred on a de facto
basis.
   The package also includes proposals to tighten enforcement of
the act in areas that remain segregated.
   The entire package is opposed by most anti-apartheid
organizations, which say the Group Areas Act should be repealed
rather than modified.
   ``If we don't destroy it, it will destroy us,'' said Miley
Richards, a mixed-race Parliament member, in regard to the act.
   Among the areas mentioned by Heunis is Cape Town's District Six
_ a formerly multiracial area from which tens of thousands of
mixed-race people were evicted after it was declared whites-only in
1966.
   Also mentioned was Hillbrow, an area of high-rise apartment
buildings which is one of Johannesburg's liveliest and most
cosmopolitan neighborhoods.
   Hillbrow, like several of the areas named by Heunis, has become
home to many Asians, blacks and people of mixed-race moving into
inner-city housing vacated by whites who left for the suburbs.
   The proposal to allow multiracial neighborhoods has been
denounced by the extreme-right Conservative Party, which is
expected to makes gains in nationwide municipal elections next
month at the expense of President P.W. Botha's National Party.
   Anti-apartheid groups say the National Party is trying to
appease right-wing voters by proposing tougher enforcement of the
Group Areas Act, including sharply increased penalties for
violators.
   The government also is proposing to crack down on occupants of
substandard urban housing and illegal squatter camps _ moves which
could affect millions of blacks.
   Heunis said the government remained committed to protecting
``group rights'' _ its phrase for policies which allow whites-only
schools, hospitals and residential areas.
   The Group Areas bills created a furor in Parliament when the
government introduced them last month. The white chamber approved
the measures, but the smaller mixed-race and Asian chambers refused
to discuss the bills.
   The government withdrew the bills, but decided to reintroduce
them after the other chambers agreed to end their boycott.
   The nation's 26 million black majority is not represented in
Parliament.
   Under South Africa's constitution, the National Party _ which
controls Parliament's white chamber _ has the ability to enact
bills even if the other two chambers reject them.
   The Group Areas Act has been the most bitterly debated issue in
the municipal election campaign.
   Last week, a National Party city councilor in Johannesburg said
he would lobby for multiracial areas in wards that vote for the
anti-apartheid Progressive Federal Party, but would seek to keep
other white neighborhoods segregated.
   The councilor, Danie van Zyl, was accused Monday of ``gutter
politics'' by Tony Leon, the Progressive Federal leader in
Johannesburg. Leon said his party favored intergration nationwide,
not just in selected neighborhoods.

<HEAD>Fire May Stand in Way of Reintroducing Wolves to Yellowstone</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A controversial plan to reintroduce wolves in
Yellowstone National Park may be stalled because of the fires that
have raced through the area this summer, the chief naturalist for
the area said.
   George Robinson said the fire turned the park into a sort of
carnivore's smorgasbord, burning off the foliage and fallen
deadwood that hid mice and other rodents as well as elk, deer and
moose.
   ``I don't ever remember having seen so many hawks in the sky
before,'' he said.
   He said there are reports of grizzlies standing over the
fire-felled carcasses of elk and deer, the same prey wolves would
seek if they were in the park. ``Had the wolves been re-established
prior to the fires, the timing would have been perfect,'' he said.
   The fires, which burned a million acres of timber, also may
stand in the way of the controversial wolf program, in which at
least 10 breeding pairs would be introduced into the park.
   ``My guess is we aren't going to have time to do much but assess
the impact of the fire on the park for quite a while,'' Robinson
said. ``I'd guess such projects as the wolf reintroduction will be
pushed onto the back burner.''
   Timber wolves, once plentiful in the mountains of Yellowstone,
were exterminated by hunters around the turn of the century. Their
elimination created a gap in the park ecosystem, conservationists
think.
   However, sheep and cattle ranchers in Wyoming, Montana and
Idaho, the states Yellowstone straddles, have opposed the
reintroduction plan, fearing the wolves will prey on livestock
outside the park. Wyoming Sens. Malcolm Wallop and Alan Simpson and
Rep. Dick Cheney support the ranchers.
   L. David Mech, a U.S. Fish and Wildlife wolf specialist from
Minnesota, thinks the ranchers fears are unfounded.
   Minnesota is more susceptible to livestock predation than
Yellowstone, he said. ``In Minnesota the ranches are scattered like
a mosaic throughout the wolves' territory.
   ``We have 1,200 wolves and 12,000 livestock ranches, yet only 40
to 50 complaints of wolves killing livestock,'' he added.
   In Denver last week for a lecture at the Museum of Natural
History, Mech said he hadn't studied the situation in Yellowstone,
but based on the size of the elk herds it's obviously a prime
habitat for wolves.

   A British tourist accused of setting a fatal hotel
fire after an argument with her boyfriend was ordered held without
bail Monday, and a magistrate also ordered a psychological
examination.
   Tara Jane Terry, 19, of Camberley, England, was arrested last
week on federal arson charges in the fire at the Nassau Hotel in
Miami Beach. She faces a maximum of life in prison if convicted.
   Her boyfriend, Mark Edward Richardson, 20, was detained as a
material witness, but has been released on $100,000 bond.
   Two people died of smoke inhalation in the Sept. 17 fire and one
person was critically injured.
   Ms. Terry appeared Monday before U.S. Magistrate Linnea Johnson.
   ``Nobody would set a fire in which her money was burned up, all
of her clothes, all of her documents _ it just doesn't make
sense,'' argued her attorney, Corey Hoffman.
   He said his client should be freed pending trial, saying her
mother intends to come to live in the United States during
proceedings.
   But Assistant U.S. Attorney Terry Lindsey told the magistrate
that Ms. Terry was a flight risk and should be held. ``She's here
only on a tourist visa and she has the means to leave,'' he said.
   Ms. Johnson agreed Ms. Terry should remain in custody and, with
Hoffman's consent, ordered a psychologist to examine her. The
psychological evaluation will be presented at a formal arraignment
set Oct. 13.
   According to an affidavit filed by a federal agent in the case,
Ms. Terry and Richardson arrived at the Nassau Hotel on the night
of Sept. 17.
   They went upstairs arguing, but Richardson later returned to the
lobby and spoke to the manager, leaving Ms. Terry alone in their
room. She later joined him in the lobby, and while they talked
passersby reported the fire.
   Federal agents and firefighters determined the fire was set and
pinned it down to the time Ms. Terry was in the room alone.

   The Reagan administration has been trying to
persuade the Afghan rebels not to attack departing Soviet troops,
fearing this tactic could prompt Moscow to back off its promise to
be out of Afghanistan by Feb. 15, U.S. officials said Monday.
   This is among the issues that a newly appointed U.S. envoy to
the rebels, Edmund McWilliams, is expected to discuss with
insurgent leaders operating out of base camps in Pakistan, the
officials said.
   State Department deputy spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley confirmed
McWilliams' appointment Monday. He is a career diplomat who once
served at the U.S. Embassy in Afghanistan.
   The U.S. officials, speaking on condition they not be
identified, said some Afghan rebel factions believe that attacks on
Soviet forces will ensure their prompt withdrawal. But they said
the administration holds the opposite view.
   ``We don't want Soviets to have any excuse to slow their
withdrawal or to attack the Afghans,'' one official said.
   He added that the final decision on this and other operational
matters is up to the rebels themselves.
   ``We don't control their fighting activities, but we do present
them with our views,'' the official said.
   On Friday, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze
bitterly criticized the Pakistani role in supplying the Afghan
rebels, even through the Soviets are continuing with their
withdrawal schedule.
   He said Pakistan ``is behaving as though it has no obligations''
under the agreement in Geneva signed last April under which the
Soviets promised to pull out their troops over a nine-month period.
   He proposed a meeting at the United Nations this week involving
the representatives of the signatory countries: the Soviet Union,
the United States, Pakistan and Afghanistan.
   Asked about the proposal, Mrs. Oakley said Monday the
administration ``sees no need'' to have such a meeting.
   A U.S. official noted that the United States does not regard the
Afghan government as legitimate and that American participation at
a meeting with an Afghan official could be seen as a reversal of
that policy.
   The United States has maintained for the past five months that
it will show restraint in arming the Afghan rebels only if Moscow
does the same with its ally in Kabul.
   Since Moscow has been providing substantial support to the Kabul
government, the United States has continued its backing for the
insurgents, the official said.

   Spotting a ``fundamental shift in society'' to
recycling, Dow Chemical Corp. and Domtar Inc. of Montreal said
Monday they will form a new company to recycle plastic bottles.
   The as-yet unnamed 50-50 venture will retrieve from the trash of
the two countries polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and high-density
polyethylene (HDPE) plastics, which make up about 90 percent of the
plastics used in bottles for milk, soft drinks and a variety of
other products such as powdered detergents.
   Domtar, a diversified chemical and paper firm based in Montreal,
already operates paper and plastics recycling businesses.
   Don Genson, business director for solid waste solutions for Dow,
said the new company would build a pilot plant and then a
commercial plant as early as 1990 at a location in the United
States or Canada still to be decided.
   Domtar will collect the raw material and use the bulk of the
output in its own industrial packaging and building materials
products. Dow will sell some of the material it retrieves, the two
companies said.
   Dow and Domtar declined to estimate their expected investments
or what the output would be used for or to detail the new
technology developed by Dow that will be used in the plant.
   ``We have about 20 projects being evaluated in the corporation
right now,'' said Warren Arseneau, Domtar new business manager.
   The size of the plant has not been decided, but the two firms
believe it will handle about 50 million pounds a year of PET and
HDPE.
   About 900 million pounds of PET is sold each year, with 150
million pounds recycled currently. About three-quarters of original
annual production goes into bottles; recycled material currently is
not used for food and drink because of the chance of contamination.
   HDPE is one of the most widely used plastics and 7.82 billion
pounds is produced every year, about 465 million pounds made by
Dow. Some 2.1 billion pounds goes into bottles for milk and other
household goods and another 342 million pounds goes into
miscellaneous food packaging. Only about 2 percent is recycled
   One recycler, Eaglebrook Plastics Co., estimates that four HDPE
bottles are thrown out for every PET bottle.
   ``We're entering the business confident that the waste
management issue will make a fundamental shift in society and
recycling systems will become the norm,'' Genson said.
   Domtar will deal with recycling centers in areas with PET bottle
return laws and ``waste recovery facilities expected to be
established by states developing new recylcing programs,'' the
companies said.
   Last week, the Environmental Protection Agency announced plans
to exhort, persuade, push and nudge U.S. residents to recycle 25
percent of their garbage and trash by 1992, up from 10 percent now,
because of the rapid exhaustion of landfill space in a throwaway
society.
   According to EPA, 10 states have passed laws requiring recycling
programs of one kind or another, with households separating
recyclable material from food when they put out their garbage. The
agency estimates that these programs operate in about 600 U.S.
communities.

   American Clinton Suggs said
Monday he figured he had just five minutes to live after Arab
hijackers shot a fellow Navy diver and threw him out of a
commandeered TWA jetliner.
   ``I made up my mind that if my turn was next _ I'm ready, but
I'm not going to scream,'' Suggs said at the murder and air piracy
trial of Mohammed Ali Hamadi. The Lebanese Shiite Moslem is charged
in the June 1985 hijacking in which Robert Stethem, 23, was killed
and 39 Americans held hostage for 17 days.
   Suggs testified that said Stethem was alive when the hijackers
threw the mortally wounded man on the runway at Beirut airport in
1985.
   ``I could hear him moaning,'' Suggs said. ``I fixed my mind on
him. I tried to hear everything I could because I was blindfolded
and couldn't see.''
   The court indictment states that Stethem died of his wounds a
short time after being thrown from the airplane.
   Suggs testified that before Stetham was thrown from the plane
Hamadi said ``let the pig suffer'' when the chief flight attendant,
Uli Derickson, asked the hijackers if she could loosen Stethem's
bound hands.
   Suggs and Stethem, of Waldorf, Md., had been taken to the
plane's first- class section after the flight was diverted to
Beirut.
   ``I heard a lot of screaming to the tower in Arabic, I couldn't
understand it,'' he testified. ``Then I could hear Robert (Stethem)
scream,'' Suggs said.
   Other witnesses, including Mrs. Derickson, have said that
Stethem never made a sound during beatings he received by the
hijackers. But Suggs, when asked about that testimony, maintained:
``I heard him scream.''
   ``Then I hear a gunshot, the door open, and a second shot,''
said Suggs. ``At this point I just listened for Bob, he was still
alive and I could hear him moaning.''
   Although he was blindfolded at the time, Suggs said he knew when
the door opened ``because you can feel it with the draft, and the
engines were louder.''
   John Testrake, the pilot of flight 847, testified earlier at the
trial that the engines were running when the hijackers shot Stethem.
   Suggs said that after Stethem was shot, he heard one of the
hijackers say in broken English: ``One more in five minutes.''
   ``I felt I would be the next to die,'' Suggs said.
   Stethem's parents, Richard and Patricia, who have been attending
the trial since it opened July 5, sat quietly listening to the
testimony.
   Hamadi also sat impassively during Suggs' testimony.
   Later Monday, another Navy diver, Jeffrey Ingalls, 27, testified
he hid his military identification card from the hijackers and that
he was ``roughed up a little when they found out about it,'' just
before he was taken off the plane in Beirut.
   Asked to comment on Monday's testimony, Hamadi said in Arabic
through his interpreter: ``I have nothing to say.''
   Hamadi has acknowledged taking part in the hijacking, but denied
having shot Stethem. He faces a maximum sentence of life in prison
if convicted.
   Hamadi was arrested at Frankfurt Airport on Jan. 13, 1987, after
customs officials discovered liquid explosives in his luggage.
   In the week following his arrest, two West Germans were
kidnapped in Beirut. Both captives have since been freed.
   Hamadi's older brother, Abbas Hamadi, was convicted by a
Duesseldorf court on charges that he took part in the kidnappings
in a failed effort to pressure West Germany into releasing Mohammed.

<TEXT>
   The Communist Party Central Committee
today recommended that party propaganda chief Mieczyslaw Rakowski
become Poland's next prime minister, the official PAP news agency
announced.
   The 61-year-old Rakowski, a newspaper editor who became a
Politburo member in December, would take over from Prime Minister
Zbigniew Messner. Messner resigned with all 19 of his ministers
last week following criticism over the handling of economic
problems.
   The Sejm, or parliament, was to meet Tuesday to formally approve
the Central Committee's choice of Rakowski as Poland's ninth prime
minister since World War II.
   The PAP announcement came after a closed-door session in which
the 230-member Central Committee sought a prime minister to cope
with Poland's stagnant economy and steer the government during
delicate negotiations next month with the opposition.
   The meeting of the Central Committee was chaired by party leader
Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, and was addressed by Interior Minister
Czeslaw Kiszczak and by party secretaries Wladyslaw Baka and Jan
Glowczyk, PAP said.
   Others mentioned as possible candidates for prime minister were
Politburo member and economist Wladyslaw Baka; Interior Minister
Gen. Czeslaw Kiszczak; Peasant Party leader Roman Malinowski; and
alternate Politburo member Stanislaw Ciosek.
   Commentators ranging from Solidarity leader Lech Walesa to the
official party weekly Polityka have said the appointment of a new
government has limited significance because a fundamental change is
needed in the system of governing.
   Diplomats and party sources suggest another government could be
formed in a few months anyway, depending on the results of the
talks scheduled with the opposition for mid-October. In that case,
the new prime minister might be a temporary caretaker.
   Under Poland's system, the party controls the choice of
government through its majority in parliament. The party sets the
nation's priorities and it is up to the government to carry out the
party's dictates.
   Jaruzelski, first secretary of the Polish United Workers Party,
named his candidate for the prime minister's post Saturday to the
leadership of PRON, a national patriotic group, the Polish news
agency said. But there has been no public announcement of his
choice.
   Whoever assumes the job of prime minister will have a daunting
task. Confidence in the government is low, inflation is 60 percent
annually, consumer goods are in short supply and workers are
restive after recently staging two punishing waves of strikes.
   The last strike ended after authorities set aside their
longstanding opposition to negotiating with Solidarity, agreeing to
talks in mid-October to consider legalizing the trade union, banned
since 1982.
   Last week Walesa said, ``Personnel changes will not change
anything, but systematic changes will.''
   The sentiment was echoed by Polityka, which said last week in a
front-page article, ``Crisis has affected the whole system of
exercising power, and it is unlikely to be resolved by just new
faces in government.''

   President Reagan, in a farewell address to
the United Nations, said today it is ``more than a possibility''
that a treaty curbing intercontinental ballistic missiles can be
signed with the Soviet Union within the next year.
   In a speech at the opening of the General Assembly, Reagan also
called for an international conference to stop the use of poison
gas and other chemical weapons.
   The president reviewed what he said has been progress toward
peace in his administration, but added that ``history teaches us
caution'' and that ``even in this time of hope, the chance of
failure is real.''
   He called upon Iran and Iraq to cooperate in implementing the
U.N. resolution on their Persian Gulf war, saying, ``Let this war
end now .... Let peace come.''
   In Afghanistan, he said, ``We encourage the Soviet Union to
complete its troop withdrawal at the earliest possible date so that
the Afghan people can freely determine their future without further
outside interference.''
   The president condemned ``the continuing deterioration of human
rights in Nicaragua and the refusal of the tiny elite now ruling
that nation to honor promises of democracy made to their own people
and to the international community.''
   He called on the Soviet Union to ``assist in bringing the
conflict in Central America to a close by halting the flow of
billions of dollars of arms and ammunition to the Sandinista
regime'' in Nicaragua.
   And he said he will ``continue to urge the Congress and the
American public to stand behind those who resist this attempt to
impose a totalitarian regime'' on the Nicaraguan people.
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze, sitting with the
Soviet delegation to the General Assembly, nodded as Reagan spoke
of progress on arms control. Members of the Nicaraguan delegation
were expressionless as the president charged their country's
Marxist-led government with repressive practices.
   Turning to negotiations on long-range nuclear weapons, the
president said, ``I can tell this assembly that it is highly
doubtful such a treaty can be accomplished in a few months, but I
can tell you a year from now is a possibility, more than a
possibility.''
   Then, in an emotional passage, he said, ``Poison gas. Chemical
warfare ... the terror of it. The horror of it. We condemn it. The
use of chemical weapons in the Iran-Iraq war _ beyond its tragic
human toll _ jeopardizes the moral and legal strictures that have
held these weapons in check since World War I.''
   The president urged nations that signed the Geneva protocol
outlawing such weapons and other concerned countries to ``convene a
conference to consider actions that we can take together to reverse
the serious erosion of this treaty.''
   Iraq has admitted using chemical weapons in its eight-year
Persian Gulf war with Iran but claims Iran also employed the banned
substances. Tehran has denied the allegation. In addition, the
United States has accused Iraq of using poison gas against its
Kurdish minority. An announcement by Iraq's foreign minister last
week indicated Iraq will no longer use chemical weapons against
foreign or domestic adversaries.
   The president also said recent briefings he has received in the
Oval Office on his Star Wars system for space-based misile defense
``indicate that progress toward such systems may be even more rapid
and less costly than we had at first thought.''
   Noting that this would be his last address to the United Nations
before he leaves office in January, the president said that ``if
future generations do say of us that, in our time, peace came
closer, that we did bring about new seasons of truth and justice,
it will be cause for pride.''
   It was Reagan's seventh appearance before the United Nations. He
has addressed the opening session of the General Assembly each year
since 1983 and spoke at a special U.N. session on disarmament in
1982.
   Before going to the General Assembly chamber for his speech,
Reagan was greeted by United Nations Secretary General Javier Perez
de Cuellar. When a reporter asked why there had been such a
dramatic change in his views of the United Nations, of which he has
been sharply critical in the past, Reagan gestured to Perez de
Cuellar and said, ``because of the gentleman present the U.N. has
changed dramatically.''
   It was Reagan's first meeting with Perez de Cuellar since the
White House's announcement on Sept. 13 that the president was
releasing $188 million the United States had withheld from the
organization to show displeasure with U.N. budgetary and hiring
practices.
   The president's national security adviser, Lt. Gen. Colin L.
Powell, said the United Nations had responded to U.S. suggestions
by making changes in its budget procedures and the size of its
staff and that the president wanted to recognize this as well as
the fact that the organization ``has started to play a more
important role around the world in helping to deal with regional
conflicts.''
   After his speech, the president also met with Egyptian Foreign
Minister Esmat Abdel-Meguid, Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres,
President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe, Sheik Sabah Al-Ahmed, foreign
minister of Kuwait, and others.
   The White House announced today that Reagan had decided to end
U.S. convoys of American-flagged ships in the Persian Gulf but will
keep U.S. forces in the gulf to aid threatened ships.
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters Reagan
would discuss the change in meetings with heads of state from the
region. Reagan acted ``after reviewing the current cease-fire ...,
which has been in effect since Aug. 20, and consulting with allies
and friends in the region,'' he said.
   There have been no attacks on gulf shipping since the cease-fire
began.
   During his meeting with the Egyptian and Israeli foreign
ministers, Reagan was asked why more progress had not been made
during his administration toward peace in the Middle East. ``I
think all of us would have liked to have made more progress than we
did...but it's not a complete failure. We're talking,'' he said.

   Republican George Bush declared today his
debate with Michael Dukakis ``went great,'' while running mate Sen.
Dan Quayle proclaimed the vice president a clear victor in the
nationally televised face-off.
   Earlier, Bush campaign chairman James A. Baker III issued a
clarification on Bush's views on abortion, saying that the vice
president would not sanction criminal penalties for women who
obtain abortions _ despite the strong views he expressed in his
debate Sunday night.
   However, Bush told reporters here he had ``no change of mind at
all'' on the subject as aides insisted that Bush never favored
criminal penalties for women who get abortions.
   Quayle, who appeared with Bush for the first time since Labor
Day, praised his running mate's performance. ``From the way you
handled the man from Massachusetts last night, he would have been
better off to take advice from his friends at the ACLU and
exercised his right to remain silent,'' Quayle said, referring to
the American Civil Liberties Union.
   Bush has criticized Dukakis' membership in the ACLU, a group
that supports civil rights.
   ``After last night, for most people the notion of President
Dukakis is a very, very troubling notion today, '' Quayle said,
playing on Dukakis' remark during the debate that people found the
notion of `President Quayle' to be very troubling.
   ``One debate down. How'd I do?'' Bush told a cheering crowd of
several thousand well-wishers who turned out for the Bush-Quayle
rally at an outdoor railroad museum here.
   Earlier, as he left Winston-Salem, N.C., Bush said his debate
with Dukakis ``went great,'' especially in seeking to portray his
Democratic rival as a far-out liberal.
   Asked where he thought he'd hit Dukakis the hardest, Bush
replied, ``Make him be what he is ... you can't permit him to be
something different.'' He promised to persist in preventing the
Massachusetts governor from moving to the ideological center.
   On abortion, Baker said Bush would favor criminal penalties for
those performing illegal abortions but would oppose prosecuting
women who obtain them.
   After stressing strong anti-abortion views during the debate, he
said, Bush decided on further reflection that women who obtain
abortions should be regarded as ``additional victims'' rather than
criminals.
   ``After thinking about it overnight, we went in and discussed it
this morning and concluded it was an issue that should be addressed
and we addressed it,'' Baker told reporters.
   Bush told a debate questioner that ``I haven't sorted out the
penalties'' he would impose under a constitutional amendment he
seeks to outlaw abortions.
   ``... I'm for the sanctity of life and, once that illegality is
established, then we can come to grips with the penalty side and,
of course, there's got to be some penalties to enforce the law
whatever they may be,'' Bush said.
   Dukakis immediately responded that Bush was ``prepared to brand
a woman a criminal for making that decision. It's as simple as
that.''
   That exchange left the issue an ``open question'' that needed to
be clarified, Baker said.
   ``He would not wish to see a woman labeled as a criminal,
notwithstandng his views on the right to life,'' Baker said.
``Women would be seen as an additional victim.''
   Baker said it was the first time Bush had dealt with the
question of penalties _ ``choice vs. right to life'' and ``he has
dealt with it.''
   He said Bush would have criminal penalties apply only to those
performing abortions if the procedure became illegal.
   The vice president's campaign chief said Bush won the debate
over Dukakis by ``coming across as warm, as human and as likable''
while successfully portraying Dukakis as a liberal.
   President Reagan told reporters he also thought Bush won the
debate. ``I think the vice president ... was ebullient, I think he
was the one who was stating the facts and the truth.''
   Bush expressed satisfaction after the debate and declared, ``I
am not going to let this man move to the center and get away from
his past.''
   ``I believe that he will be outstanding,'' Bush said during the
debate.
   The vice president told a noisy crowd of 400 to 500 supporters
at a post-debate rally Sunday night that the session with his
Democratic opponent was a good chance to highlight the differences
between them.
   ``Tonight we had a little debate over there (at Wake Forest),''
he said. ``It is my firm belief that we had an opportunity to spell
out my dreams and my objectives and I am not going to let this man
move to the center and get away from his past,'' Bush said.
   During the debate, Bush repeatedly sought to characterize
Dukakis as a liberal.
   But, unlike many of his aides, he did not claim a clear victory
in the debate. However, Bush gave repeated thumbs-up signs to his
audience of supporters, who crowded into a barn at a local
fairgrounds to shout, ring cowbells and cheer for their candidate.
   While awaiting the public opinion polls, Bush aides were quick
to declare laurels for their man.
   ``I think it was a clear win for the vice president,'' Baker
said. ``He did an extraordinarly good job, in our opinion.''

   Two months after the wife of one of
Mississippi's richest men was abducted from her home, authorities
said Monday they have no clues on the woman's welfare or
whereabouts.
   The last contact with Annie Laurie Hearin was a letter dated
Aug. 10 to her husband, Robert, president of Mississippi Valley Gas
Co. Hearin's worth reportedly exceeds $100 million.
   ``We are working just as hard and intensely at the end of two
months as we did at the end of two weeks,'' said Wayne Taylor, the
agent in charge of the FBI in Mississippi. ``We are just hoping it
will be resolved quickly.''
   The FBI said Mrs. Hearin was abducted sometime between 3 p.m.
and 4:30 p.m. July 26. Small spots of blood were found inside and
outside the front door of the two-story house in Jackson.
   A crudely phrased typewritten note left behind instructed Hearin
to pay an unspecified amount of money to people he allegedly had
wronged.
   The people named in the letter are current or former franchisers
with School Pictures of Mississippi Inc., of which Hearin was once
the largest stockholder. The company sued the 12 people in the
early 1980s, claiming the franchisers owed money from operating
loans, materials and film-processing fees.
   On Aug. 23, FBI officials announced that Hearin had followed the
instructions and that a total of about $1 million was mailed to the
12 named in the letter _ or their survivors _ on Aug. 16, the day
after Hearin received a handwritten letter from his wife. The note
had an Atlanta postmark.
   In addition to Mississippi Valley Gas, Hearin and partner Leon
Hess, a New Jersey oil man, own controlling interest in Lamar Life
Corp., which is Trustmark National Bank's largest shareholder.

   Senate Democrats said today that Republican
have effectively killed chances of raising the $3.35 minimum wage
this year through a five-day filibuster.
   ``There is no point in our continuing to pound on their door,''
said Senate Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va. ``I'm now
conceding that the Republican filibuster was successful. I regret
that. I would have liked to have seen this bill passed by the 100th
Congress.''
   The bill by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., would have raised
the wage floor, which has been at its present level since 1981, to
$3.75 in January, $4.15 in 1990 and $4.55 in 1991.
   Kennedy said it would have directly benefited some 15 million
workers now paid less than $4.55 an hour.
   ``I think it's a pretty good result,'' said Republican Leader
Bob Dole of Kansas. ``This bill couldn't pass the House. It wasn't
going to pass the Senate unless it was modified.''
   Senate Democrats had attempted twice, the last time on Friday,
to invoke cloture to end the filibuster. Both attempts failed.
   Republicans launched delaying tactics after Kennedy used a
parlimentary maneuver to effectively deny a vote on Vice President
George Bush's proposal for a subminimum training wage.

with other musicians and artists at a concert to raise money for a
group that helps people with AIDS.
   He also opened his wallet, writing a $7,500 check to the
non-profit Health Education Resources Organization.
   ``Lifesongs '88,'' which raised more than $170,000 for the
group, included performances Sunday night by singer Roberta Flack
and comedians Paula Poundstone and Kevin Rooney.
   The check from Feinstein, who returns to Broadway this fall to
perform classics by Cole Porter and George Gershwin in a five-week
run at the Booth Theater, wasn't the only surprise of the evening.
   Letters of support for the organization from President Reagan,
actress Elizabeth Taylor and singer Dionne Warwick were read during
the 3{-hour event.

   When actor Peter Fonda got into an argument with
a limousine driver Monday en route to O'Hare International Airport,
police were called.
   But by the time officers arrived, the two were ``kissing
cousins,'' a policeman said.
   The altercation apparently began in the limousine and police
were asked to stop the vehicle as it neared O'Hare, said Officer
Tom Legittino.
   The limo was stopped, but police said the two had resolved their
differences.
   There was a ``lack of communication between the limousine driver
and Peter Fonda,'' Legittino said, adding he was uncertain of the
nature of the argument.
   No arrests were made and no charges filed.

Award-winning role in the play ``Fences.''
   ``The Tony makes more of a difference to my agent, because he

   ``I'm sure it gives some of us a healthy confidence. Others of
us, it doesn't help at all. Actors are very fragile, you know. Shy?
Necessarily, yeah. I pretend a lot that I'm not.''
   Jones, 57, plays a man who could have been a major-league
baseball player, except that he was black. The character, Troy
Maxson, instead drives a garbage truck.
   Jones won the award last year, when the play was on Broadway.
The play opens here Wednesday at the James A. Doolittle Theater.

   Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski, selected Monday to
become Poland's new prime minister, is known as an advocate of
reform but a fierce opponent of the banned Solidarity trade union.
   A man of peasant origins who rose to become one of Poland's
leading journalists and then deputy prime minister, the 61-year-old
Rakowski joined the ruling Communist Party Politburo Dec. 15 and
was put in charge of propaganda.
   Rakowski's appointment to the Politburo represented a political
comeback after being dropped from the government in 1985.
   A protege of Polish leader Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, Rakowski
became unpopular with leaders of Solidarity during the 15 months it
was legal in 1980-81. He was in charge of the government's
committee for trade unions and was the authorities' chief
negotiator with Solidarity.
   He also played a major role in defending the suppression of the
union after the introduction of martial law on Dec. 13, 1981.
   And in August 1983, he went to the Lenin shipyard in Gdansk to
attack Solidarity and defend the martial-law crackdown in a steamy
meeting in which he was jeered and hooted by workers.
   The grey-haired Rakowski took off his tie and rolled up his
shirt sleeves for the televised confrontation, but failed to win
over much of the work force which instead cheered Solidarity
chairman Lech Walesa.
   Rakowski became deputy prime minister on Feb. 12, 1981, and held
the post until his ouster in November 1985. Afterwards, he held a
largely ceremonial position as deputy speaker of the Sejm, or
parliament.
   Born to a peasant family in the village of Kowalewek near
Bydgoszcz in northwest Poland on Dec. 1, 1926, Rakowski was a
teen-age laborer during the Nazi occupation of Poland and served in
the Polish army from the time of the liberation until 1949.
   He joined the Communist Party in 1946 and was a party political
worker in Warsaw from 1949 to 1952. He then attended the Institute
of Social Sciences in the capital until 1957.
   Rakowski became editor-in-chief of the party weekly Polityka in
1958, a post he held until 1982, and gave it a reputation as a
progressive center within the official press and winning him the
distrust of conservatives within the party.
   In a widely circulated memorandum on Poland's political
situation written before his appointment to the Politburo, Rakowski
backed further democratization and economic reform.
   But he urged the party to be more defined in its political
struggle against Solidarity, saying the party must make clear its
ideological goals and defend them.
   In the nine months since Rakowski took over official propaganda,
the state media has become more open in distributing information
about the opposition but has been aggressive in attacking
opposition views.
   Jamming of Western radio stations such as Radio Free Europe has
ceased, but the official media has stepped up rebuttals of reports
heard on the stations.

   A gunman entered an elementary school
today and calmly opened fire, killing one pupil, wounding 10 other
people and sending terrified youngsters fleeing into the woods,
authorities and witnesses said.
   Police have a suspect in custody, said Police Chief James
Coursey.
   Dan Branyon, spokesman at Self Memorial Hospital in Greenwood,
said eight children and two teachers were brought there, all
suffering from gunshot injuries. Six of the 10 were treated and
released and four were being admitted, including a child who was in
critical condition, he said.
   Children ran from the Oakland Elementary School into adjacent
woods when the man opened fire about 11 a.m., the The (Greenwood)
Index-Journal reported. Janitor Thad Barr, a witness to part of the
shooting, said he wasn't sure where it started, but the man was in
the lunchroom shooting then went down the hall shooting into
classrooms.
   Physical education aide Phillip Browning said after the suspect
quit shooting, he threw the pistol down and walked out of the
building as if nothing was wrong.
   Browning said he held the suspect until police arrived. He
described the man as a hefty white male in his mid-20s. ``He
remained calm and offered no resistance,'' Browning said.
   The school was evacuated as state troopers, police officers,
sheriff's deputies and school officials arrived. Officers and
volunteers combed the woods for a time after the shooting, looking
for children who might be hiding.
   Greenwood School District 50 Superintendent Bob Watson said
about noon that all he knew was that an unidentified man came into
the building and started shooting children and teachers. Watson
said it didn't appear the man had any connection with the school.
   Marilyn Amick, a first-grade teacher, said she and her students
fled the cafeteria after she saw a man waving a gun around. They
exited through a back door and ran toward the woods.
   Later, they joined other groups of students on the lawn in front
of the school, and teachers checked rolls to count the students.
Children were allowed to go home after they were accounted for.
Some volunteers called parents to let them know their children were
all right.
   Ms. Amick said she comforted her students by telling them
everyone in their class was OK.
   Greenwood is a town of about 22,000 in western South Carolina,
some 50 miles north of Augusta, Ga.
   Just last week, a man later identified Clem Henderson shot and
killed two people in a store in Chicago, then walked across the
street to a school, killing a school janitor and a policewoman
before he was killed by another police officer.
   In that case, no pupils or teachers were injured, but on May 20,
an 8-year-old boy was killed and six other people were injured when
a woman went on a rampage in and around a school in the affluent
Chicago suburb of Winnetka. The woman, Laurie Dann, killed herself
at the end of the spree.

   The Grateful Dead's long, strange career took a
new turn when the 23-year-old rock band staged a benefit concert
for preservation of the world's tropical rain forests.
   A boisterous crowd of colorfully clad deadheads _ the group's
legion of devoted fans _ seemed in shock several times during the
almost six-hour concert Saturday night at packed Madison Square
Garden.
   While the band, an icon of the psychedelic 1960s, has played
benefits before, they called this show the first act in a lifetime
commitment to the rain forest issue.
   Some fans were surpised to hear the Dead push a cause.
   But a real blow was the labored singing of lead guitarist Jerry
Garcia, whose ragged, cracking voice showed the exhaustion of
ending a three-week East Coast tour with nine shows in 11 nights in
New York.
   Overshadowing those anomalies, though, was the participation of
other popular musicians.
   Bruce Hornsby and the Range kicked off the show with an
energetic 75-minute set. Hornsby also joined the Dead for a jam on
``Not Fade Away.''
   Former Rolling Stones guitarist Mick Taylor accompanied the Dead
for two songs, trading leads with Garcia on ``West L.A. Fadeaway''
and the blues standard, ``Little Red Rooster.''
   Folksinger Suzanne Vega also performed.
   But the real high point came when Daryl Hall and John Oates came
on stage, bouncing like jumping beans in the midst of the
always-placid Garcia and rhythm guitarist Bob Weir.
   The musicians launched into an energetic ``Everytime You Go
Away,'' with Oates singing the lead and Hall providing falsetto
accompaniments. Garcia stood to the side, laying down lead runs
during appropriate intervals but generally looking confused.
   Marvin Gaye's ``What's Going' On,'' written in the early '70s at
the height of the ecology movement, also got an enthusiastic
response from the audience.
   Another highlight was bass player Phil Lesh's enthusiastic
rendition of the Dead classic ``Box of Rain.''
   The group also unveiled a banner from the rafters of the Garden.
Decorated in the tie-dyed colors favored by Deadheads and bearing
the number 25, it represented the 25 shows the band has played in
the Garden, the most by any rock group.
   For the finale, Hornsby, Hall and Oates and bass player Jack
Casady, formerly of Jefferson Airplane and Hot Tuna, joined in
``Good Lovin'' and Bob Dylan's ``Knockin' on Heaven's Door.''
   Throughout the night, performers and video messages reminded
patrons who paid up to $250 a seat about the cause.
   Tropical rain forests are lush jungles located near the equator,
primarily in South and Central America, Africa and Southeast Asia.
According to the National Academy of Sciences, rain forests cover 7
percent of the globe and contain 5 million to 30 million species of
plants, animals and insects.
   Environmentalists and scientists contend that deforestation _
through cattle ranching, farming, timber harvesting and land
development _ contributes to the global warming trend known as the
greenhouse effect. It is caused by increased carbon dioxide in the
atmosphere that traps heat, similar to glass in a greenhouse.
Scientists say that left unchecked, it would melt the polar ice
caps, causing ocean levels to rise.
   Rain forests absorb carbon dioxide and produce oxygen through
photosynthesis.
   Leaflets distributed at the show urged people to write
politicians, foreign leaders and financial institutions in a plea
to halt projects that destroy rain forests.
   Proceeds from the show, expected to exceed $600,000, were to be
distributed among environmental groups, including the Rainforest
Action Network, Cultural Survival and Greenpeace International.

<HEAD>Aoun Seeks Arab Recognition, But Envoys Boycott Him</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Army commander Gen. Michel Aoun failed
Monday to win Arab recognition for his fledgling Christian military
Cabinet in a struggle for power with a rival Syrian-backed Moslem
government.
   None of three Arab envoys who attended a meeting at the
presidential palace called by Aoun apparently made any commitment
to his Christian Cabinet, while other Arab envoys boycotted the
session.
   At the same time, Syria, which supports the rival Moslem
government led by Salim Hoss, stepped up its criticism of Aoun's
4-day-old, three-man Cabinet.
   Syria's rejection of Aoun has sharpened sectarian tensions in
Lebanon and threatened to formalize the country's de facto
partition into Christian and Moslem areas carved out during the
13-year-old civil war.
   President Amin Gemayel appointed fellow Maronite Catholic Aoun
prime minister in a six-man interim military Cabinet on Thursday,
five minutes before Gemayel's six-year term ended. Parliament
repeatedly failed to elect a successor to Gemayel, who was barred
from seeking a second, consecutive term.
   Hoss, a Sunni Moslem who was acting prime minister under
Genayel, insisted that his five-man Cabinet, all that was left of a
fractured national government under Gemayel, was the legitimate
authority.
   Three Moslem army officers Gemayel named to serve in Aoun's
government refused to serve. But the general insisted his Cabinet
had legally inherited Gemayel's powers and constituted Lebanon's
legitimate government.
   Gemayel's action in naming Aoun violated an unwritten convenant
dating from Lebanon's independence in 1943 under which the
president must be a Maronite, the premier a Sunni and the
parliament speaker a Shiite Moslem.
   The only envoys to respond to Aoun's call for a meeting Monday
were Iraqi Charge d'Affaires Sabbar Al-Hadithi, Tunisian Charge
d'Affaires Mohammed Ali Ben Abdallah, and the head of the Egyptian
interest section, Hassan Shash.
   An aide said Aoun asked them to ``inform your governments that
the Cabinet appointed by President Amin Gemayel before his term
ended is the legitimate executive body in Lebanon.''
   The representatives of Algeria, Libya and South Yemen, who are
based in Moslem west Beirut, refused to attend the meeting, an
action interpreted in some circles as reflecting their country's
disapproval of Aoun's Cabinet.
   The envoys who attended the meeting were non-committal on the
issue of recognition.
   ``We expressed to Gen. Aoun our hope that the Lebanese would
agree on the election of a new president to unite the country and
avert the evil of partition,'' Shash said.
   Hadithi, the Iraqi envoy, said Baghdad supports ``the election
of a new president and supports Lebanon's unity.''
   Abdallah of Tunisia said Aoun gave ``us an explanation of the
current situation. We will relay it to officials in Tunis.''
   The Iraqi and Egyptian diplomats are based in Christian east
Beirut. Iraq, Syria's main Arab rival, has been openly challenging
Syria's grip on Moslem-held areas of Lebanon.
   Other influential Arab countries such as Saudi Arabia, Jordan
and Kuwait, have had no missions in Beirut for several years
because of the violence.
   Hoss and Aoun both held meetings during the weekend with envoys
of the five member states of the United Nations Security Council _
the United States, the Soviet Union, China, Britain and France _ as
the two Cabinets battled for recognition. But so far none of those
governments has committed itself.
   Syria, the main power broker in Lenanon, is the only country to
have declared its support for either of the rival Cabinets.
   Damascus' Al-Baath daily, which speaks for Syrian President
Hafez Assad's ruling Arab Socialist Baath Party, warned that Aoun's
Christian administrations will not last. ``If the three-man
military rule which usurped power ... thinks it is going to last,
then it's belief is wrong,'' a Al-Baath editorial said.

<HEAD>Four Mines Found in Persian Gulf; Shipping Fears Rise</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD PYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ABOARD USS VANDEGRIFT IN THE GULF (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four mines have been
discovered in the northern Persian Gulf recently, and U.S. naval
officers say shipping will be endangered if rough winter weather
rips more mines from their moorings.
   U.S. Navy officers said Monday that three of the mines were
spotted drifting on the surface after breaking loose from their
seabed anchors.
   ``As winter approaches, the waters in the northern gulf get a
lot rougher, and that's when the anchored mines are more likely to
break away. They're also harder to spot,'' said one officer.
``We're very concerned that the situation is going to get worse in
the immediate future.''
   The warning was issued as this 3,600-ton missile frigate arrived
off Kuwait, escorting what U.S. military sources said could be the
next-to-last convoy of U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti tankers to be protected
by American warships.
   The White House announced President Reagan has decided to end
the ``tight escort'' of vessels, opting instead for
``accompanying'' them with warships posted along the way to provide
any assistance needed.
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Reagan acted
``after reviewing the cease-fire'' between Iran and Iraq which
began Aug. 20, and ``consulting with allies and friends in the
region.''
   Aboard Air Force One en route to New York, where Reagan later
addressed the U.N. General Assembly, Fitzwater said U.S. ships
would still ``take appropriate action if American-flagged ships are
directly threatened.''
   Administration officials said last week they are considering the
``zone defense'' plan, citing reduced gulf tensions and prospects
for a U.S. force cutback of at least one ship. The United States
has 26 warships in the region, 16 in the gulf.
   The military sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
a convoy scheduled to leave Kuwait on Tuesday would likely be the
last escorted the entire 550-mile voyage through the gulf. The
Vandegrift was designated as escort for the 81,283-ton oil products
carrier Surf City.
   The Navy has been escorting 11 Kuwaiti tankers reflagged with
the Stars and Stripes since July 1987 to protect them from Iranian
attack.
   Monday's convoy, the 67th this year and the 89th since
``Operation Earnest Will'' began, brought the 294,739-ton tanker
Townsend up the gulf to Kuwait. A second tanker, the U.S.-owned
Overseas Valdez, dropped off at Bahrain.
   As they neared Kuwait early Monday, the Vandegrift and its
massive charge sailed through waters where the missile frigate
Taylor, a sister ship of the Vandegrift, spotted a floating mine
Saturday. It was destroyed by Navy divers.
   A Kuwaiti cargo vessel reported a similar discovery Friday near
Hout island, 40 miles northwest of the Taylor sighting.
   The officers said a U.S. minesweeper's sonar located a mine Aug.
19 on the seabed in a ``mine danger area'' near Iran-owned Farsi
Island, where dozens of mines had been cleared earlier.
   A day earlier, the Vandegrift was patrolling near two secret
U.S. Navy barges in the same area when bridge lookouts spotted a
mine bobbing 100 yards off the port side.
   U.S. officers said all the mines were 500-pound M-08 contact
devices that Iran is known to have sown widely, and each was safely
disposed of.
   All were covered with marine growth, indicating they had been in
the water for some time, the officers noted.
   Capt. Jim Miller, ``commodore'' of the U.S. minesweeping force
in the gulf, estimated two months ago that despite the recovery of
scores of mines, ``a couple of hundred'' remain, mostly in northern
waters near Iraq, and mostly laid by the Iranians.

   It's not a sign of the times.
   So the illuminated likeness of pioneer topless dancer Carol Doda
will be coming down from its perch above the Condor Club, which
will become a sports bar or comedy club under new ownership.
   The topless craze began at the club 24 years ago when Doda
donned a topless bathing suit and climbed atop the club's piano.
She was featured at the Broadway nightspot until two years ago.
   Broadway, once jammed with barkers for numerous skin shows, has
been moving upscale during the past few years. In December 1987,
the Condor was sold by owner David Benson to Tex Norton, who tried
to switch from topless entertainment to a family-oriented Barbary
Coast review. But the new show never caught on. Benson bought the
club back a few months later and brought back topless.
   The club now has been sold to Timothy Chee, David Seto and
Shacuan Seto.
   ``They want to put something in there that will make money, that
the city will like and that will upgrade the street,'' said a
spokesman for the partners. ``They haven't made up their minds
whether it will be a nightclub or a sports bar.''
   The 40-foot female form now on the sign will be replaced with a
mural of sports figures or a picture of entertainers who have
performed in the area.

   There was Democratic Sen. Edward M. Kennedy,
leaning over reporters' shoulders to say he thought Michael Dukakis
won the debate decisively and succeeded in looking ``presidential.''
   Not so, said Wyoming Republican Sen. Alan Simpson, who labeled
George Bush the presidential figure and said Dukakis ``looked
absolutely programmed'' and came across as ``plastic.''
   The high-stakes Dukakis-Bush debate took the game of political
spin to new heights, as familiar faces from both parties were flown
in to Winston-Salem, N.C., to provide not-so-objective analysis of
the first encounter between the presidential contenders.
   With polls showing a close race for the White House and
undecided voters anxiously awaiting the debate, neither candidate
risked being outspun and each paid the way for a phalanx of instant
commentators ready to offer ins think if you had a mutual non-aggression
pact you'd probably
have about the same effect,'' said Hickman. ``But as long as people
on one side are doing it those on the other side have to do it as
well.''

   About 60 percent of those watching television
Sunday night tuned into the first 1988 presidential debate,
according to preliminary figures from the A.C. Nielsen Co.
   In the 16 largest markets, the 90-minute live, prime-time debate
between Vice President George Bush and Massachusetts Gov. Michael
Dukakis had a rating of 17.4 and a 27 share on NBC, an 11.9 and 18
share on CBS and a 9.8 and 15 share on ABC.
   The rating is a percentage of the estimated 90.4 million U.S.
households with televisions. The share is a percentage of sets in

   NBC interrupted its Olympics coverage for the debate. Ratings
were not available Monday for CNN and PBS, which also carried the

<TEXT>
   Six to seven dozen wild horses have
been shot dead in an isolated stretch of central Nevada, the
federal Bureau of Land Management confirmed Monday.
   In addition to the remains of 73 animals found last week, BLM
investigators have turned up a dozen more carcasses of wild horses,
along with spent bullets and other evidence, said bureau
spokeswoman Maxine Shane.
   She said the bureau hasn't determined exactly how many horses
have been killed because a few of the original 73 remains spotted
by helicopter turned out to be cattle that died of natural causes.
   The carcasses and bones are strewn along an area one to two
miles wide and about eight miles long. The BLM has said the horses
apparently were shot over a six-month period starting about a year
ago.
   The remote area includes canyons and rolling benchland about 30
miles north of the tiny central Nevada town of Austin and about 15
miles west of the highway linking Austin with Battle Mountain.
   The BLM was tipped by a person who was questioned about an
earlier rifle slaughter of 41 horses whose remains were discovered
30 miles away in August. The bureau did not identify the person.
   More than 38,000 wild horses now run the open range in 10
western states. Nevada's herds are the largest, with estimates of
up to 28,000 horses roaming the state.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Economists from major U.S. corporations are
predicting the economy will slow next year _ bad news for
presidential candidates George Bush and Michael Dukakis, who are
both counting on strong growth to help them reduce the federal
budget deficit.
   A panel of 60 economists from the National Association of
Business Economists are bullish about growth this year, predicting
an expansion of 3.9 percent as measured by the gross national
product. That's even more optimistic than the administration's
forecast of 3.5 percent.
   However, the median forecast for next year is an anemic 2.3
percent, substantially less than the administration forecast of 3.1
percent.
   Nearly half of the economists _ 47 percent _ said in a survey in
late August and early September that they expect the country to
topple into a recession by the end of next year. Another 42 percent
believe a recession will occur in 1990. Only 11 percent believe the
six-year-old economic expansion will continue into 1991 or later.
   That's slightly more optimistic than a similar survey in May
when 57 percent said the recession would come in 1989.
   ``For business economists, a group often accused of an inability
to reach agreement on anything, the fact that 90 percent ... expect
an economic downturn during the next two years is noteworthy,''
said Jay N. Woodworth, an economist with Bankers Trust Co. and
incoming president of the association, which is holding its 30th
annual meeting in Pittsburgh this week.
   Republicans are looking for strong growth the rest of this year
to boost Bush into the presidency, and the economists are
optimistic he'll win. They boosted their projection from 2.9
percent in May to 3.9 percent, even though the summer drought is
expected to knock a full percentage point off GNP growth.
   Fifty-three percent of a larger panel of 300 association members
believes Bush will win, while 37 percent think Dukakis, the
Democrat, will be elected. A more lopsided majority, 62 percent vs.
22 percent, believe Bush's policies would better maintain stable
growth and moderate inflation.
   However, the economists _ who identified the budget deficit as
the No. 1 economic problem facing the next president _ were
pessimistic that either candidate will be able to accomplish much
on the deficit.
   Bush, who has vowed not to raise taxes and has proposed a tax
cut for capital gains, said on a nationally televised debate Sunday
night that he'll whittle the deficit with a ``flexible freeze''
that will permit the president to cut spending in some programs.
   Dukakis, who says he will turn to a tax increase only as last
resort, said at the debate that he will get tougher with tax
cheats, cut some military programs and encourage growth.
   However, by a 3-to-1 margin, the 300-member economists' panel
predicted no major deficit reduction package would be enacted in
1989.
   A majority, 51 percent, said there would be no great difference
between a Bush and a Dukakis administration in the chances of a
package being adopted. Twenty-eight percent said they believed
Dukakis would have a better chance, versus 20 percent who said
Bush. That probably reflects an assumption that Dukakis would find
it easier to work with a Democratic Congress.
   The median deficit projection for next year was $150 billion,
about the same as last year's budget gap and the deficit expected
in fiscal year 1988.
   Other economic policy priorities, listed in order of importance
after shrinking the budget deficit, were: completing the free trade
agreement with Canada; speeding up productivity growth; encouraging
personal savings; and stimulating business investment.
   Near the bottom of the economists' list was curbing hostile
corporate takeovers, discouraging corporate debt accumulation,
increasing antitrust law enforcement, reforming securities laws to
prevent another stock market crash and changing federal law to
allow banks to enter the securities industries.
   In other predictions, the 60-member panel said:
   _Inflation as measured by the Consumer Price Index will kick up,
from a projected 4.5 percent this year to 5.1 percent next year.
The administration is looking for inflation of 3.9 percent in 1989.
   _Interest rates, both short- and long-term, should rise a full
percentage point by mid-1989 and then start to decline.
   _The merchandise trade deficit of $170 billion in 1987 will
shrink to $135 billion this year and $120 billion next year.
   _Sixty-two percent believe the value of the dollar, which has
rebounded somewhat over the past six months, will remain stable
this year, and 55 percent believe it will slip next year.

   Democrats have sent their vice presidential
nominee, Lloyd Bentsen, what they describe as an ``official Quayle
license'' for use in the upcoming debate with his Republican
counterpart Dan Quayle.
   The so-called license is a wallet-sized card which says it
``entitles the bearer to bag one Quayle by beating the Bush (as in
George) during open season on Nov. 8.''
   It was sent to Bentsen by Helen Boosalis and Dan Morgan,
co-chairs of Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis'
Nebraska campaign.
   ``Having read about your enthusiasm for hunting both quail and
Quayle, it occurred to us that although you're probably licensed to
bag the former, you haven't been given a permit to hunt the
latter,'' Boosalis and Morgan said in a letter to Bentsen.
   Bentsen and Quayle are scheduled for their only debate
appearance Oct. 5 in Omaha.

   A priest told more than 1,000 mourners at the
funeral of a slain police officer Monday to be anguished over cuts
in services for the mentally ill, saying the killer ``needed more
help, more love and more understanding.''
   Amid the wail of bagpipes, scores of police officers saluted the
casket carrying the body of Officer Irma Ruiz.
   Ruiz was one of four people killed by Clem Henderson, 40, during
a shooting rampage Thursday at a store and school. Henderson also
died.
   As police stood at attention under a blue sky, the Emerald
Society, a police drum and bagpipe corps, played a dirge while
pallbearers carried the casket into Christ The King church on the
city's Southwest Side.
   ``If we are to be anguished and upset today, perhaps we should
be anguished and upset at those who are cutting and continue to cut
resources for our mentally ill,'' the Rev. James Maloney told
mourners.
   ``Perhaps that is what killed Irma, because there was a person
who needed more help, more love and more understanding than our
institutions provided him,'' Maloney said.
   Dozens of city officials attended the funeral Mass at the Roman
Catholic church, including Mayor Eugene Sawyer and police
Superintendent LeRoy Martin.
   Sawyer said he hoped the shootings would make the public realize
the need to ban the manufacture and sale of handguns.
   On Thursday, Henderson walked into an auto parts store and
fatally shot owner John Van Dyke, 41, and an employee, Robert
Quinn, 26.
   Henderson then crossed the street to the Montefiore School where
he fatally wounded a custodian, Arthur Baker, 33, and wounded a
garbage collector, Laplose Chestnut Jr., 34.
   At the school's front door, Henderson surprised Mrs. Ruiz and
Officer Greg Jaglowski, who had been called there to remove an
unruly student.
   Mrs. Ruiz, the mother of four, was shot once in the chest.
Jaglowski was shot in both legs, but pursued Henderson into the
school where he killed the gunman.
   Jaglowski was in good condition Monday at Mount Sinai Hospital.
   Three of Henderson's other victims also were buried Monday.
Henderson's funeral was scheduled Thursday.

   The Oct. 5 presidential referendum in Chile will
occur in a political climate dominated by fear as the military
continues a successful strategy of using torture to control people,
a study of the country concludes.
   The report, ``Sowing Fear: The Uses of Torture and Psychological
Abuse in Chile,'' is based on a four-year investigation by the
Boston area-based Physicians for Human Rights.
   The organization claims that an atmosphere of terror has been
accelerated in Chile by the emergence of paramilitary vigilante
squads which are responsible for kidnappings, rape, torture and
murders.
   In the referendum, voters will determine whether to elect
General Augusto Pinochet to eight more years as president or to
have an open election in a year. Pinochet came to power after the
military overthrew the socialist government of President Salvador
Allende in 1973.
   ``Let's not be deceived by elections in Chile _ it's a country
gripped by fear,'' said Jonathan Fine, the executive director of
the 1,000-member group and one of the physicians who interviewed
alleged torture victims.
   ``In Chile you find a carefully planned program of state terror,
a scientific approach to intimidation designed so the country will
be paralyzed by fear and won't go against the government,'' Fine
said.
   Two other human rights reports released early this year said
Chile's human rights situation was improving, but some repression
continued.
   Amnesty International said in an 18-page report that the number
of ``disappearances'' has dropped sharply since 1977, but has not
stopped completely. A United Nations report said human rights
violations including torture continue in Chile, but the overall
situation is improving.
   More than 700 people have disappeared during Pinochet's rule,
most of them in a wave of repression following the 1973 coup,
according to international and local human rights groups.
   The physicians' report said in many instances entire communities
have been intimidated and terrorized by state security agencies.
The primary targets are usually the poor, social and political
activists and those involved in human rights issues.
   The report includes graphically detailed case histories of
alleged torture victims, information gathered during seven trips to
Chile made by the organization from 1984 to 1988 where more than
100 such people were interviewed.
   Most of those who said they were tortured were kidnapped and
subjected to brutal treatment, including the use of electric
current on the the genital area, beatings, threats, sleep
deprivation and rape and sexual violation.
   The most frequently reported psychological torture, according to
the report, involves threats to family and friends, the forced
presence of friends and close relatives during torture sessions and
interrogation while blindfolded and nude.
   Central Nacional de Informaciones, Chile's secret police, is
believed reponsible for the bulk of the terrorism and tortures,
according to the report.

<HEAD>Two Killed, 67 Wounded In Israel; U.N. Protests</HEAD>

   Israeli troops killed two Palestinians and
wounded 67 in the occupied lands on Monday, hospital officials
said, and a U.N. agency claimed the army was resorting to gunfire
too often to quell the unrest.
   ``There is a clear trend of a growing use of live ammunition
that cannot be justified,'' said a senior official of the U.N.
Relief and Works Agency. ``Our concern is very real. This is not
just a knee-jerk reaction to a bad day.''
   The Israeli army rejected the criticism.
   The number of Palestinians wounded Monday was the second highest
since the Dec. 8 start of the uprising against Israel's occupation
of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. As many as 90 Palestinians were
wounded during protests against the April 16 assassination of PLO
military commander Khalil Wazir.
   Monday's clashes came as Palestinians staged a general strike in
the occupied lands to protest the detention of thousands of
Palestinian activists by Israeli authorities. During the protests,
white sheets sprayed with red swastikas were attached to
electricity polls in the biblical city of Bethlehem.
   The number of Palestinian casualties in the Gaza Strip jumped
from 19 in July to 130 in September, not counting Monday's wounded,
said the U.N. official who spoke on condition of anonymity. He said
figures for the West Bank were being compiled. The U.N. agency,
which aids Palestinian refugees, filed a complaint with the army,
the official said.
   He also blamed the growing casualty toll to the army's
introduction in August of plastic bullets which penetrate the body
like live ammunition, but generally are not fatal unless fired from
less than 60 feet.
   An army spokesman, Col. Raanan Gissin, rejected the U.N. agency
complaint, and blamed the increase in casualties on more violent
Palestinian protests, not more liberal use of gunfire. He also said
plastic bullets served as a deterrent while avoiding fatal injuries.
   In clashes in the Jabal Mukaber district in Arab east Jerusalem,
riot police fatally shot 19-year-old Jamal Mattar in the mouth,
said officials at the city's Mukassed Hospital. He was the first
Palestinian reported killed in Jerusalem during the uprising.
   Police spokesman Rafi Levy said the death was under
investigation. Initial reports showed police fired only tear gas
and rubber bullets, not live ammunition, Levy said.
   An Israeli photographer said he heard several shots and minutes
later saw six masked Palestinians carry Mattar to a car. One of the
youths held Mattar's arm with one hand and flashed a victory sign
with the other.
   About 4,000 people attended Mattar's funeral, chanting Palestine
Liberation Organization slogans and waving outlawed Palestinian
flags. Police fired dozens of tear gas canisters into the crowd,
witnesses said.
   In Gaza City, troops fatally shot 27-year-old Jihad Zanoun in
the chest during a stone-throwing protest, hospital officials said.
The army said it was checking the report.
   A third Palestinian, Nasser Jundi, 22, of the West Bank refugee
camp Nur Shams, died late Sunday at an Amman hospital of a chest
wound sustained in a May 25 clash, hospital officials in Jordan
said.
   The deaths brought to 274 the number of Palestinians killed in
the uprising. Six Israelis also have died.
   At least 67 Palestinians were wounded by army gunfire Monday,
including 43 in the Gaza Strip and 24 in the West Bank, hospital
officials said. Army officials confirmed 15 wounded in Gaza and 11
in the West Bank, and said they would check further.
   The one-day strike was ordered by the pro-PLO United National
Leadership of the Uprising and the Moslem fundamentalist group
Hamas, Arabic for ``zeal.''
   Streets were deserted in towns, villages and refugee camps in
the West Bank and Gaza.

   A Cabinet minister who had been
helping rebuild a region devastated by the 5-year-old civil war in
Sri Lanka was shot to death Monday near a Buddhist temple.
   The military said three unidentified assailants opened fire on
Lionel Jayatilleke's car, killing him and seriously injuring two
bodyguards. The Joint Operations Command said the shooting occurred
in Kuliyapitiya, 40 miles northeast of Colombo.
   Jayatilleke, 64, served as education minister and as minister of
rehabilitation and reconstruction.
   There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the killing.
   Military officials who requested anonymity said they suspected
the People's Liberation Front, a Sinhalese extremist group that has
vowed to kill anyone who supports a July 1987 accord aimed at
ending the ethnic dispute that was wracked the island's north and
east.
   Members of the front have been accused of trying to assassinate
President Junius R. Jayewardene in August 1987.
   Jayatilleke, a former teacher, had served as minister of
education since July 1977.
   Last year, he was appointed minister of rehabilitation and
reconstruction and assigned to re-open schools and restore civil
services to the war-torn provinces. He spent the last two months
touring the north and east, talking to ethnic groups left homeless
by the war.
   Tamils, mostly Hindus, comprise 18 percent of the island's 16
million people. They claim they have been denied jobs and military
appointments by the predominantly Buddhist Sinhalese, who make up
75 percent of the population and control the government.
   The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, the most militant group,
briefly accepted the accord, but later reneged, claiming it failed
to meet enough demands.
   Militant Sinhalese also claim the accord makes too many
concessions. They have been blamed for 450 killings, including
government and security personnel.
   India became involved in the conflict because 60 million Tamils
living in southern India are sympathetic to the rebel cause. An
estimated 47,000 Indian troops have been stationed on the island
trying to enforce the accord.
   About 8,500 people have died in the fighting, including at least
575 Indian soldiers.

<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Yugoslavia's official youth union on
Monday blamed the political system of this crisis-ridden communist
country for ethnic clashes and warned the conflict could develop
into a civil war.
   A top Communist Party official resigned to protest the mass
rallies by Serb nationalists against ethnic Albanians in the poor,
southern province of Kosovo. The Socialist Youth Union, in a
statement addressed to the Yugoslav people and carried by the state
Tanjug news agency, blamed the ``almost totally inefficient
political system'' for ``a situation which is closer to fratricidal
war than progressive solution of the problems.''
   The youth union also called on officials to battle Yugoslavia's
``economic and social collapse'' through free elections and a
open-market economy.
   In addition to increasing ethnic tensions, Yugoslavia is
battling a 200 percent annual inflation rate, a $21 billion foreign
debt, a 15 percent unemployment rate and increasing labor unrest.
   ``The current situation in the country is characterized by fears
of violence ... poverty and hopelessness,'' the statement said.
   In Kosovo, the Moslem Albanians form 90 percent of the 2 million
population and are fighting to win a greater voice in governing
their autonomous province, now administered by the republic of
Serbia. The Christian Slavs, formed by Serbs and Montenegrins,
claim they are the victims of Albanian arson and street attacks,
are calling on Serbia to completely absorb the province.
   Franc Setinc, a member of the ruling Communist Party Presidium,
resigned Monday over recent rallies by tens of thousands of Slavs
who have chanted demands for arms to fight the Albanians.
   Serbian party boss Slobodan Milosevic backed the protests and
demanded tough measures against Albanian separatists, who are
demanding their own republic free of the 200,000 Slav minority.
   In a resignation letter sent to Tanjug, Setinc said he ``is
concerned by slogans `We want arms!' and the like that call for a
blaze in Kosovo and all of Yugoslavia.''
   ``We are doing little to stop the insanity that ... is driving
us into catastrophe,'' added Setinc, one of the highest officials
to resign since the communists came to power after World War II.
   Milosevic has denounced Setinc and several other communist
officials at the rallies, and his supporters claim non-Serbian
officials have prevented action to stop ethnic strife in Kosovo.
   ``I am afraid of people who manipulate with hardships and
emotions of Serbs and Montenegrins in Kosovo,'' Setinc said in an
apparent reference to Milosevic and other Serbian leaders.
   Yugoslavia's leaders say the rallies could imperil the fragile
ethnic balance in this nation that stretches from Austria to
Greece, or even lead to civil war.
   The animosity in Kosovo, exacerbated by the rallies, is now so
high that many residents believe a military crackdown will come
within months, or even weeks. Police in armored personnel carriers
have been sent to the province by the federal government in
Belgrade.
   In Pristina, the capital of Kosovo, about 2,000 Slav
schoolchildren continued to boycott their classes Monday to protest
alleged harassment by ethnic Albanian classmates, sources said.
   The elementary and high school students have not attended
classes since Thursday, when they staged a street protest. The
students, who belong to Serb and Montenegrin minorities, also
marched Friday.
   They apparently were kept at home Monday by parents fearing
possible confrontations with ethnic Albanians, according to the
sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The Slav students say they will not return to classes until a
meeting of the Communist Party Central Committee in early October
results in decisive action against the Albanians.

   Moslem guerrillas staged rocket attacks on the
Afghan capital of Kabul and the southern city of Pulialam on
Monday, killing 21 people and wounding 33, the official Soviet news
agency Tass said.
   Also Monday, a bomb exploded under a military jeep in Kabul,
killing two soldiers and injuring two pedestrians, according to a
Western diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity. It was not
known if the soldiers were Soviet or Afghan.
   Tass said 16 people were killed and 27 people were wounded in a
ground-to-ground missile attack on Kabul.
   The report said five people died and six others were injured by
shelling on Pulialam. It said Afghan forces confiscated rocket
launchers, a rifle, a mortar and several machine guns.
   Four Afghan jets swept into Pakistani territory Monday, bombing
three border villages and killing six people, Pakistan's state-run
television reported.
   The Soviet Union began pulling its troops out of Afghanistan on
May 15 under terms of a U.N.-mediated accord signed in Geneva. The
troops were sent into the country in December 1979 to help the
Afghan government fight Moslem guerrillas.

<HEAD>1-Ton Turtle Washes Up On Welsh Beach</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CARDIFF, Wales (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A one-ton leatherback turtle found washed
up dead on a Welsh beach could be the largest of its species ever
recorded, the National Museum of Wales said Monday.
   ``It appears to be a world record,'' said Peter Morgan, keeper
of zoology at the museum in Cardiff, south Wales.
   ``We had to weigh it on a crane and it scaled 2,000 pounds. It
is 8{ feet long from its head to the end of its tail and nearly 10
feet wide, measured across the flippers. I doubt whether they grow
much bigger,'' Morgan said.
   ``There are earlier reports of leatherbacks approaching this
size but this seems to be the heaviest recorded,'' he said.
   The turtle, found Thursday on Harlech Beach in Cardigan Bay,
northwest Wales, was driven to Cardiff by a nature warden where it
was put in the museum's deep freeze.
   Morgan said reports of leatherbacks in Welsh waters were ``very
rare'' and all were females. This one was a male and was thought to
have come from the Caribbean.
   ``They live in the tropics and feed on jellyfish and as we have
had lots of jellyfish in Welsh waters this year it probably was
pursuing them,'' he said.
   Morgan said that while most stranded turtles are injured in
collisions with ships this turtle had not been injured before it
died at sea from an unknown cause. ``We've done an autopsy and
tests on its parasites, like barnacles, should show where it came
from,'' he said.

   President Reagan departed from a generally
conciliatory speech Monday to deliver a tongue-lashing to a handful
of nations for abusing human rights, singling out the Soviet Union
and others.
   Reagan declared that ``the regard for human rights as the
foundation of peace is at the heart of the United Nations.
   ``Those who starve in Ethiopia, those who die among the Kurds,
those who face racial injustice in South Africa, those who still
cannot write or speak freely in the Soviet Union, those who cannot
worship in the Ukraine, those who struggle for life and freedom on
boats in the South China Sea, those who cannot publish or assemble
in Managua _ all of this is more than just an agenda item on your
calendar,'' Reagan told the delegates from 159 nations.
   ``It must be a first concern; an issue above others,'' said
Reagan.
   Reagan's farewell address to the General Assembly drew about a
minute of applause but no standing ovation, except among members of
the U.S. delegation.
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze sat stony-faced
during Reagan's criticism. He left afterward by a private exit and
offered no comment to reporters.
   Reagan's South China Sea reference was to refugees fleeing
Vietnam, and his mention of Kurds was prompted by allegations Iraq
has used poison gas to crush a rebellion by its Kurdish minority.
   Of Cuba, Reagan said ``for years, Cuba, a blatant violator of
its citizens' human rights, has escaped United Nations censure or
even scrutiny.''
   Reagan said the United States prompted the U.N. Human Rights
Commission to examine Havana's human rights policies.
   ``Fidel Castro has already begun to free some political
prisoners, improve prison conditions, and tolerate the existence of
a small, independent national human rights group,'' he said.
   Few foreign officials had comment on Reagan's attacks. But
Nicaragua's deputy foreign minister, Victor Hugo Tinoco, said
Reagan singled out his country out of frustration because ``he
accepts that his policy is a total failure, ... the policy of
paying mercenaries this policy of eight years of war.''
   Washington supports the rebels, known as Contras, in the civil
war against the leftist Sandinista government.
   Clovis Maksoud, the permanent observer of the League of Arab
States, has said previously there is no evidence Iraq used chemical
weapons against the Kurds. Maksoud also has criticized Washington
for allegedly bowing to ``Zionist'' pressures.
   Maksoud did question Reagan's failure to mention the Palestinian
uprising against Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip
and the political standoff between Christians and Moslems in
Lebanon.
   The United Nations itself may have had the keenest interest in
Reagan's speech. In previous years, Reagan has lambasted the
organization for alleged overspending, anti-Western bias and a
bloated bureaucracy.
   Washington began withholding part of its U.N. dues to spur
reform, and by this fall the United States was more than $530
million in arrears.
   On Sept. 13, Reagan announced he was satisfied with the U.N.'s
reforms and the United States began paying its back dues.
   ``That eliminates the threat of insolvency,'' said a U.N.
official, speaking on condition of anonymity. The United Nations
would have run out of funds for its payroll, rents and other fixed
expenses by late October.

   Ozone depletion by chlorofluorocarbon
compounds could be even worse than previously thought, the
Environmental Protection Agency said Monday in urging a stepped up
attack on CFC use worldwide.
   Separately, the major trade association of producers and users
of CFCs said for the first time the world should aim at ``phasing
out ... CFCs to the maximum extent feasible.''
   ``The depletion that has already occurred calls into question
our earlier projections of future damage,'' EPA Administrator Lee
M. Thomas said in releasing a new assessment of future
concentrations of chlorine in the atmosphere.
   ``Regretfully, our new analysis predicts an even worse scenario
than anticipated.''
   Thomas' call for ending all CFC use was a switch from his
position that there was plenty of time for participants in last
year's treaty to decide what, if any, further steps were necessary.
   That treaty, signed by 45 major nations, pledges signatories to
a 50 percent cut in CFC production in 1998.
   Thomas has been urging the United Nations Environment Program to
accelerate the scientific review called for by the treaty, and an
informal review will convene in The Hague next month.
   Environmentalists, who have been calling for an end to CFC use
for months, hailed EPA's announcement.
   ``It underlines the seriousness of the emergency we are
facing,'' said David Doniger of the Natural Resources Defense
Council. ``This kind of report will have a lot of impact'' on major
producing countries in Europe.
   ``We're glad to see they've come around to our way of
thinking,'' said Liz Cook of Friends of the Earth.
   The CFC compounds are widely used as refrigeration fluids,
solvents and foam blowing agents and, outside the United States, as
aerosol propellants. Related bromine compounds are used in fire
extinguishers. Some of them can last for more than a century,
rising to the stratosphere where they eventually break down to
liberate chlorine.
   A major study of ozone by the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration in March found ozone depletion of a few percent at
mid-latitudes and attributed it to chlorine.
   The NASA panel's work prompted some major producers of CFC
compounds to announce their intention to develop harmless
substitutes.
   The trade group, the Alliance for a Responsible CFC Policy, said
its new recommendation grew out of the NASA report.
   Up to now, EPA has estimated that it would take an 85 percent
reduction in one of the major CFC compounds to keep chlorine from
growing. But this estimate did not include low-potency CFC
compounds outside the treaty and non-CFC sources of chlorine,
notably methyl chloroform, the most widely used industrial solvent.
   The report focused on chlorine concentrations to avoid the
uncertainties of trying to predict ozone depletion. Any increase in
chlorine and bromine increases the risk of ozone depletion, EPA
said.
   John Hoffman, co-author of the report, said, ``You ask the
atmospheric chemists for a prediction (of ozone) and they won't
give you one'' because their computer models failed to predict the
ozone depletion that has occurred so far _ spectacularly so for the
annual ``hole'' over Antarctica that sees ozone decline by half
every September.
   Currently, average chlorine in the stratosphere is about 2.7
parts per billion.
   This concentration would triple or double by 2075, depending on
whether methyl chloroform use increases or not, even if the entire
world abides by last year's treaty, EPA found.
   ``An immediate 100 percent reduction in the use of all (the most
powerful) compounds and a freeze in methyl chloroform would be
needed'' to stabilize chlorine, EPA said. ``Immediate'' means 1990,
and the actions would have to cover all countries.
   The ``most likely'' restrictions necessary for stability would
call for ``conservative'' use of low-potency replacement compounds,
EPA said. If one pound of these compounds were used for every five
pounds of major compounds given up, the world could increase use of
the substitute compounds by 4 percent per year.
   This would keep chlorine concentration at about 1985 levels in
2060 and hold the increase by 2100 to less than 1 ppb, EPA said.
   ``In fact, delaying a full phaseout from 1998 to 2008 increases
the maximum chlorine level by about 0.7 ppb and delays the decline
back to 1985 levels by about 70 years,'' EPA said.

   A judge ruled Monday that one of two Indian
activists accused of taking hostages in a newspaper office could
act as his own lawyer after the man refused representation by
anyone other than William Kunstler.
   Eddie Hatcher, 31, and Timothy Jacobs, 20, are charged with
taking hostages and possessing illegal firearms. They have never
denied that they walked into The Robesonian newspaper office Feb. 1
in Lumberton, chained the door and held up to 20 people for 10
hours, saying they were trying to expose local corruption.
   Before jury selection started, Hatcher insisted he would be
represented by no one but Kunstler and that the trial should be
delayed until Kunstler finished a trial in New York.
   But U.S. District Judge Terrence Boyle had warned Hatcher when
he granted a third delay in the case Aug. 1 that he did not intend
to continue the case again. He said then another lawyer should be
prepared to begin the trial if Kunstler was not present.
   Boyle denied Hatcher's renewed request for a delay Monday, and
then asked Hatcher if he wanted to fire his local attorney, Barry
Nakell, a law professor at the University of North Carolina at
Chapel Hill. ``If you want him to stay and try this case, I'll
force him to stay,'' Boyle said.
   Hatcher replied: ``Bill Kunstler is my attorney, and I feel like
I'm being forced to make this decision, and my constitutional
rights are being violated.''
   Nakel withdrew as Hatcher's attorney and Boyle then called
Stephanie Moore, an associate of Kunstler, to the front of the
courtroom and asked Hatcher if he would accept her as his trial
attorney.
   But Hatcher continued to repeat that Kunstler was his attorney.
   ``Well, he's not here,'' Boyle said. ``Will you take Ms. Moore?''
   ``Bill Kunstler is my attorney,'' said Hatcher.
   ``His answer, for the record, is no,'' Boyle said, adding that
Hatcher had chosen to defend himself.
   ``No, your honor, I have had that decision forced on me against
my constitutional rights,'' Hatcher said.
   When Boyle told the attorneys to introduce themselves to 28
prospective jurors, Hatcher stood up and said: ``Your honor, I am
not allowed to have my chosen counsel present, so I do not have
anything to say to the jury.''
   Several prospective jurors said they believed the defendants
were guilty. Four said they'd never heard of the case.
   ``In a country which consistently insists that criminal
defendants are entitled to counsel of their choice, it is a
disgrace for a federal judge, sworn to uphold the Constitution to
deny this right to anyone and particularly, a native American who
faces a potential punishment of life in prison,'' Kunstler said in
a statement issued from his New York office.
   Hatcher and Jacobs claim membership in the Tuscarora tribe, an
Indian faction affiliated with the Lumbee tribe in southeastern
North Carolina.
   Hatcher and Jacobs have said they committed the act to draw
attention to allegations of drug trafficking and corruption in the
county. The 10-hour siege at the newspaper ended after Gov. Jim
Martin agreed to form a state task force to investigate their
corruption charges.
   But Hatcher and Jacobs met only once with the task force, which
issued a preliminary report saying it had found little evidence to
back up their charges. Hatcher, Jacobs and their supporters said
the task force did not do a thorough investigation, and that
potential witnesses would not testify without federal and state
immunity.
   Hatcher disappeared Aug. 31 after a federal appeals court
revoked his bond. Jacobs surrendered to marshals in Asheville the
same day. Hatcher was arrested at Raleigh-Durham Airport one week
ago when he stepped off a plane with a Kunstler associate.

   Official Soviet media said Monday that life was
strained but slowly returning to normal in the Armenian capital of
Yerevan and in Stepanakert, the main city of disputed
Nagorno-Karabakh.
   The evening television news program ``Vremya'' said children had
returned to school in Stepanakert, but a curfew remained in effect
and many state-run enterprises were not working.
   The predominantly Armenian population of Nagorno-Karabakh, a
territory that's part of the southern Soviet republic of
Azerbaijan, is seeking annexation by Armenia, leading to clashes,
demonstrations and strikes. National authorities rejected the
demand.
   ``Vremya'' showed clear blue skies in Stepanakert as
schoolchildren and other residents walked along city streets.
   One teacher, interviewed in front of a school by a TV
correspondent, denied that Stepanakert residents forced their
children to stay away from school and take part in demonstrations.
   She said that because of the tense atmosphere in the region,
``Our small children have become grown-ups in their heads.''
   On Sept. 18, Armenians and Azerbaijanis exchanged gunfire in
Khadzhaly village near Stepanakert, and one man was killed. Soviet
officials have said 48 people were wounded in the shooting and in
arson attacks and other acts of violence in the following days.
   Yerevan residents have been holding meetings, demonstrations and
strikes to support annexation. Interior Ministry soldiers moved in
last Wednesday, sealing off streets around government buildings and
blockading entrances to the city.
   The official news agency Tass said tens of thousands of people
were milling around Yerevan's Theater Square, where activists have
held mass meetings. But it the situation was calmer than last week.
   The TV report said that as of Sunday, Armenian newspapers for
the first time began publishing detailed information about what was
happening in Nagorno-Karabakh.
   It said that would help lessen the strength of the Karabakh
Committee, a group in Yerevan that has organized the strikes and
protests to support annexation of Nagorno-Karabakh.
   The television report said 207 of the 227 state-run enterprises
in Yerevan were working Monday. However, among the 20 not working
were some of Yerevan's largest, it said.
   Armenian Communist Party leader Suren Arutyunyan visited a cable
factory that was operating Monday, the reports said.

   A jury was seated Monday in the federal
extortion trial of state Rep. Thomas Reed, who is accused of
accepting $10,000 in cash to secure a killer's early release from
prison.
   Sixteen people were seated to hear the case of Reed, who also is
president of the Alabama National Association for the Advancement
of Colored People.
   U.S. District Judge Joel Dubina ordered the jury sequestered,
and said the trial probably would last three days.
   Reed, a Democrat and the senior black member of the Alabama
House, is charged with accepting $10,000 in cash and $5,000 to
$10,000 in restaurant equipment from the family of Anthony Dennis
Chesser to secure his early release from prison.
   Reed has denied the allegations and has said they are related to
his efforts to have the Confederate battle flag removed from the
state Capitol.
   ``If the truth prevails, I'll be a free man when I leave here,''
Reed, 60, told reporters when he arrived at the U.S. District Court.
   The trial was moved to Mobile from Montgomery because of
publicity.
   A list of prosecution witnesses includes several state prison
and parole officials as well as the inmate Chesser's family.
Defense witnesses include former Alabama Gov. Fob James, state Rep.
Mary Zoghby, former House Speaker Joe McCorquodale, and several
others.
   Jury selection took four hours.
   Reed is scheduled to go to trial Nov. 7 in Montgomery on related
state charges.

   Prosecutors described homosexual
violence, necrophilia and mutilation Monday when opening statements
began in the trial of a man accused of killing 16 young males.
   Prosecutor Bryan Brown portrayed Randy Kraft, a former Long
Beach computer programmer, as one who prowled the highways of
Orange County, picking up young male hitchhikers, plying them with
Valium and beer, strangling, then sodomizing them and sometimes
dumping their bodies from a moving car.
   ``Kraft had a fetish for collecting mementos of victims and
photographs,'' the prosecutor said, describing photos in which
victims apparently were posed while dead.
   If Kraft, 43, is found guilty in the 16 killings, which would
make him eligible for the death penalty, prosecutors plan to
produce evidence at his sentencing that they say links him to 21
other slayings in Southern California, Oregon and Michigan.
Prosecutors say the death total may be as high as 60.
   Opening statements in the trial, expected to last a year, began
five years and four months after Kraft was arrested by a Highway
Patrol officer who pulled him over for a routine traffic stop and
discovered a dying Marine on the seat next to him.
   Brown gave the jury gruesome details of the killings, which took
place over 11 years.
   The victims were bound with shoelaces and strangled, often with
their own belts, Brown said. One victim was beheaded and at least
one was sexually mutilated with a knife, the prosecutor said.
   Defense attorney C. Thomas McDonald responded to the
prosecutor's two-hour speech with 10 minutes of opening statements,
warning jurors against being swayed by vivid descriptions of the
killings.
   ``These are tactics designed to inflame you,'' McDonald said.
``This is a tactical decision made by the prosecutor. He won't be
able to prove it. This case is based on suspicion, innuendo and
prosecutorial rhetoric.
   ``Mr. Kraft killed no one,'' McDonald said.
   Defense attorneys lost two rounds in pretrial motions, when
Orange County Judge Donald A. McCartin denied a request to move the
trial to another community and refused to bar some entries from a
list prosecutors have called a ``scorecard'' of Kraft's alleged
victims.
   Kraft has pleaded innocent to 16 counts of first-degree murder
for slayings that occurred between December 1972 and May 1983.
   When he was arrested, police said, they found 47 color
photographs of young men, many of them nude and apparently dead.
They also found a notebook with more than 60 notations, which
prosecutors have called a ``death list'' for all the murders
allegedly committed by Kraft.
   Last week, McCartin allowed 13 entries on the list to be
admitted as evidence. Prosecutors said the entries pertain to 14
killings in which Kraft is charged.

   The son-in-law of the late Soviet President Leonid
I. Brezhnev testified at his corruption trial Monday that he kept a
$160,000 bribe because it would have been too awkward to return,
Tass reported.
   Yuri Churbanov, the first deputy interior minister before
Brezhnev died in 1982, took the witness stand for the first time at
his trial before a military tribunal. The proceedings are in their
fourth week.
   Churbanov, 51, is being tried with eight others in a case that
is expected to last another month. He is charged with accepting
hundreds of thousands of rubles in bribes from officials in the
republic of Uzbekistan, and could be sentenced to death by firing
squad.
   Tass, the official Soviet news agency, said Churbanov testified
that an Uzbekistan Communist Party official named Umarov delivered
a briefcase to his hotel room once, telling him it was a present
from Uzbekistan party leader Sharaf Rashidov.
   ``When If opened it I found 100,000 or 130,000 rubles,'' Tass
quoted Churbanov as saying. ``I wanted to return the money, but to
whom? Umarov left and I felt awkward approaching Rashidov.''
   ``I was told that that was a a gift, and looked on it as a
gift,'' Tass quoted Churbanov as saying.
   At the official rate of exchange, 100,000 rubles is about
$160,000.
   Rashidov, who died in 1983, was a close associate of Brezhnev.
Since Rashidov's death, several key Uzbekistan officials have been
charged with corruption that occurred during his rule and two have
been executed.
   Churbanov married Brezhnev's daughter, Galina, and worked in the
Interior Ministry under Brezhnev's close associate, Nikolai
Shchelokov.
   He pleaded guilty to abusing his office, but innocent to
accepting bribes.
   Tass said Churbanov also testified that Interior Ministry
officials misled him into believing it was legal for him to use
ministry resources to build a cellar for his country house.
   ``Naturally, when such explanations came from the former first
deputy minister of internal affairs whose job it was to know the
law, the audience could not help smiling,'' Tass said.
   Churbanov's trial is the centerpiece of a campaign against the
legacy of Brezhnev, whose 18-year rule now is characterized in the
Soviet Union as a time of corruption and stagnation.

<HEAD>Ford Trust Agreement Breaks Down, Negotiations Continue</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A last-minute settlement in a
family feud over the $350 million trust left by auto magnate Henry
Ford II broke down in court Monday.
   The hearing before Palm Beach Circuit Judge Vaughn Rudnick
pitted Ford's widow Kathleen DuRoss Ford against the late
automaker's son Edsel Ford II and other family members, as well as
trustee William Donaldson.
   Mrs. Ford had complained that Donaldson, an ally of Edsel Ford,
was demanding a $1 million-a-year salary to administer the trust,
and that he had threatened to cut her income to the minimum level
of $1.5 million.
   Early Monday morning, 14 attorneys for both sides hammered out a
compromise that was to remain secret.
   Robert Montgomery, one of four attorneys representing Mrs. Ford,
said only that under the settlement, Donaldson would remain a
trustee, a new lawyer would be appointed as the trust's attorney,
and a financial advisor would be appointed.
   But a question over whether a legal guardian should be appointed
for Ford's minor grandchildren created a furor, and the whole
settlement collapsed.
   Ford, who died last year, took control of Ford Motor Co. in 1945
from his frail and failing grandfather, auto pioneer Henry Ford.
   He named Mrs. Ford as sole beneficiary of his trust, but
stipulated that upon her death, his six grandchildren would become
the beneficiaries.
   He named three people to manage the trust _ Mrs. Ford, Edsel
Ford and family friend Martin Citrin. In April, Citrin killed
himself.
   Ford's choice for an alternate trustee was Donaldson, 57, an
investment banker, former undersecretary of state and founder of
the Yale Graduate School of Organization and Management.
   Citing his expertise, Donaldson requested a $1 million yearly
salary for managing the trust. Mrs. Ford said his request amounted
to extortion, and sued to have him removed.
   Mrs. Ford's income is more than $10 million a year, an attorney
said.
   On Wednesday, a judge will hear a motion to dismiss the $5.4
million claim on the estate brought by Cristina Ford, who Ford
divorced in 1980 before he married Kathleen DuRoss later that year.
   The divorce settlement left her with $100,000 in quarterly
payments for 20 years. She contends that since Ford died, the
payments stopped, and has sued for the full 20-year amount.

   Senate Democrats gave up Monday on trying to
raise the $3.35 minimum this year, conceding they lacked the 60
votes needed to break a Republican-led filibuster.
   ``There is no point in our continuing to pound on their door,''
Senate Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd, W.Va., said. ``I'm now
conceding that the Republican filibuster was successful. I regret
that. I would have liked to have seen this bill passed by the 100th
Congress.''
   Byrd's announcement meant there would be no vote on the bill
this year.
   The bill by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., would have raised
the wage floor, which has been stuck at its present level since
1981, to $3.75 in January, $4.15 in 1990 and $4.55 in 1991.
   While some 4.7 million Americans are now paid the minimum wage
or less, the bill's supporters claimed it would have directly
benefited 15 million workers now paid less than $4.55 an hour.
   ``I think it's a pretty good result,'' said Republican Leader
Bob Dole of Kansas. ``This bill couldn't pass the House. It wasn't
going to pass the Senate unless it was modified.''
   The legislation had been the center of a partisan power struggle
since it was introduced on the Senate floor on Sept. 15.
   Republicans immediately tried to amend it to include a 90-day,
80 percent subminimum wage that was demanded by the White House and
advocated by Vice President George Bush as a condition for raising
the basic floor.
   Kennedy balked, using parliamentary tactics to effectively
preclude the so-called training wage _ no training was required by
companies that would pay the lower wage _ from ever getting a
yea-or-nay vote. Republicans then immediately launched their
filibuster.
   Democrats tried twice last week to break the filibuster but fell
seven votes and then four votes short even though they had the
support of eight Republicans on the last attempt Friday.
   Kennedy called the training wage proposal ``a blatant attempt to
turn back any consideration for an increase.'' He said it only
would have encouraged employers to hire new workers at the
subminimum and then fire them 90 days later to be replaced by a new
group of workers that could be paid the lower amount.
   However, Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, the leader of the floor
opposition to the bill, said a compromise increase could have been
worked out if only Democrats had been willing to establish some
form of broad subminimum.
   ``The real reason this is being pulled down is that the senator
from Massachusetts knows we were on the very edge of passing the
training wage,'' Hatch said. ``The fact is that the international
trade union movement in this country will not accept a training
wage. They consider the minimum wage as their single idea.''
   Republicans had filed a total of 158 amendments and Kennedy had
answered each one with an amendment of his own to enable Democrats
to retain control of the legislation.
   Byrd and Kennedy immediately tried to put the blame for the
bill's demise on Vice President and Republican presidential
candidate George Bush. The vice president had said in the past
three weeks that he could support a modest increase in the minimum
wage _ never specifying how much _ but only if it was coupled with
a subminimum floor.
   ``Perhaps the word from the vice president's campaign had not
gotten through,'' Byrd said. ``Perhaps it has gotten through.
Either way the results are evident. Some 15 million workers are the
loser.''
   The AFL-CIO, which has endorsed Democrat Michael Dukakis, also
sought to put the blame on Bush.
   ``Although Vice President Bush claimed he favored an increase,
he never specified the terms of his proposal and he never urged
Republicans to end their filibuster,'' said the labor federation's
president, Lane Kirkland.
   The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the most vigorous opponent of the
increase, said the legislation's defeat reflects a growing
understanding that mandated pay hikes and other benefits ultimately
cause more harm than good.
   ``Hundreds of thousands of jobs were saved today by members of
the Senate fighting for pro-growth economic policies,'' said Bob
Martin, director of employee relations policies for the chamber.
``Today's action will not only keep jobs in America, but will keep
inflation in check and help our competitiveness economically.''

   George Bush backpedaled Monday from his debate
suggestion that he might favor criminal penalties for women who
undergo abortions.
   His campaign manager, James A. Baker III, told reporters in
Winston-Salem, N.C., that Bush has thought the issue through and
decided women are ``additional victims'' and should not be punished
for undergoing abortions.
   But Bush still believes in the possibility of ``punishment as
far as the abortionist is concerned,'' Baker said.
   The head of a pro-choice group said Bush's remarks had
``horrified'' many women. An anti-abortion leader called the issue
``a red herring'' and said no one envisions jailing women who get
abortions.
   Bush, who favors a Constitutional ban on most abortions, was
asked Sunday night if women and doctors who defied a ban on
abortion should go to jail.
   ``I haven't sorted out the penalties,'' Bush replied. ``I'm for
the sanctity of life, and once that illegality is established, then
we can come to grips with the penalty side, and of course, there's
got to be some penalties to enforce the law.''
   Bush himself told reporters later Monday in Jackson, Tenn.,
there was ``no change'' in his stance.
   ``He horrified women last night,'' said Kate Michelman,
executive director of the National Abortion Rights Action League.
``If he believes that abortion is murder, this business of saying
women are the second victims is hypocritical.''
   ``What he advocates is a policy of forced childbirth for every
women who gets pregnant,'' she said. ``The result would be that
women would be forced to seek back-alley, medically unsafe
abortions as we did before 1973. Women would have to risk their
lives and be butchered once again.''
   Douglas Johnson, legislative director for the National Right to
Life Committee, said that neither his group nor others want to send
women who seek abortions to jail. He called that ``a non-issue, a
red herring.''
   But ``we do think the doctors who profit from killing unborn
children should be punished,'' including loss of their licenses, he
added.
   Democrat Michael Dukakis seized upon Bush's comment during their
debate, saying, ``He's prepared to brand a woman a criminal for
making this choice.''
   Dukakis said he does not favor abortion, but believes ``it has
to be the woman in the exercise of her own conscience and religious
beliefs that makes that decision.'' As governor of Massachusetts,
he has vetoed bills that sought to restrict funding of abortions
for poor women.
   Baker, in explaining his clarification of Bush's position, said:
``After thinking about it overnight, we went in and discussed it
this morning and concluded it was an issue that should be addressed
and we addressed it.''
   ``Frankly, he thinks that a woman in a situation like that would
be more properly considered an additional victim _ perhaps the
second victim _ (and) that she would need help and love and not
punishment,'' Baker said.
   Susan Estrich, Dukakis' campaign manager, said Bush has altered
his stance on abortion four times. The nation needs a decisive
president, ``not someone who will change his mind after an
overnight meeting with his pollsters,'' Estrich said.
   She said the Constitutional amendment to ban abortion that Bush
now favors _ after opposing it in 1980 before becoming Ronald
Reagan's running mate _ ``would leave states free to impose
criminal penalties on women who have abortions.''
   Bush opposes abortions except to save the mother's life or in
cases of rape or incest. He supports government funding of
abortions only to save the mother's life. He favors overturning the
1973 Supreme Court decision, Roe vs. Wade, that struck down state
laws against abortion, and passage of a human life amendment to the
Constitution to protect the unborn.
   Some 1.5 million abortions are performed in the United States
annually, compared with 586,760 in 1972, when abortion was legal in
only a few states.
   Johnson estimates that before abortions were legalized in New
York and elsewhere in the 1960s, some 200,000 were performed
illegally each year.
   To Michelman's argument that more women would be killed if
abortions were outlawed again, Johnson said that would be ``a
tragedy,'' but there would still be ``a tremendous savings in human
life ... when one recognizes that at least one human being dies in
every abortion.''

<TEXT>
   A film industry leader said Monday a committee
with binding arbitration power should be formed to resolve future
labor disputes so Hollywood can avoid a rerun of the crippling
5{-month writers' strike.
   ``It's absolutely absurd and doubly shameful that it took five
and a half months and involved thousands of innocent people to come
up with a solution that reasonable men should have come up with
sooner,'' Lee Rich said.
   Rich spoke at the opening session of Cinetex, a trade show and
film festival for the film industry. The former board chairman of
MGM@UA Communications Co. announced this summer he was moving to
Warner Bros. to set up an independent production company.
   Rich called on the industry's management and unions to establish
a commission that would arbitrate future labor problems before they
deteriorate into strikes.
   ``Call it HELP, or Hollywood Enhancement of Labor Practices,''
Rich said. ``This commission would be in place to forever ensure
better handling of the labor-management situations than have ever
existed before.
   ``This strike avoidance committee would act as the final arbiter
in a dispute, when two sides agree to disagree,'' Rich said. ``Its
ruling would be binding, just like the baseball players and club
owners who take salary disputes to arbitration.''
   Rich said that with an enforceable body in place, cooler and
wiser heads might prevail.
   ``With the potential to have everything to win, but also with
the potential to have everything to lose, perhaps management and
labor will more efficiently and more expediently work toward what's
fair.''
   The movie chief, who helped build Lorimar into a TV programming
powerhouse in the early 1980s, said his idea might not be perfect,
but called it a place to start.
   ``The key is that we've got to do something about this
problem,'' Rich said. ``If not, the goose that laid the golden egg
is going to be gone, chopped up _ and eaten.''
   Under his proposal, studios would agree to bring in skilled
labor relations experts _ either federal labor negotiators or labor
lawyers.
   ``Just as a Jack Valenti heads the MPAA (Motion Picture
Association of America) and represents our interests, perhaps a
labor statesman representing both the industry and the unions and
guilds could serve as chairman of this committee,'' Rich suggested.
   ``We'd bring together representatives from the AMPTP (Alliance
of Motion Picture and Television Producers) with representatives of
all the guilds and unions to devise an anti-strike commission
designed to be the arbiter of labor-management disputes.''
   He called the strike an embarrassment to the industry and said
it was ``time for management and the unions to put collective egos
aside and make sure that there isn't a next time.''
   A final arbiter in labor disputes could render verdicts ``long
before any other bloodbaths occur,'' Rich said.

<HEAD>Reagan Assured PLO Trying To Recognize Israel</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Reagan received assurances
Monday from Egypt's foreign minister that the Palestine Liberation
Organization was trying to find a way to acknowledge Israel's right
to exist.
   That would meet a primary U.S. condition for dealing with Yasser
Arafat's organization, which all Arab governments recognize as the
sole representative of Palestinians.
   Foreign Minister Esmat Abdel Meguid told Reagan that ``some
elements'' of the PLO would continue to resist.''
   But the Egyptian official assured the president that senior PLO
leaders ``would like to find a way to come to terms with Israel's
right to exist,'' U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Richard W.
Murphy said.
   Reagan met for about half an hour with Meguid and Israeli
Foreign Minister Shimon Peres. Secretary of State George P. Shultz
and Murphy participated.
   For years the PLO has been rumored to be on the brink of
accepting Israel, but Arafat's organization has never taken the
step. Its covenant, meanwhile, is sworn to the destruction of the
Jewish state.
   Shultz plans further meetings with Meguid and Peres while they
are in New York to attend the special session of the United Nations
General Assembly.
   Egypt is the only Arab country officially at peace with Israel.
Reagan hailed their 1979 treaty as ``a monumental achievement.''
   Reagan met with the ministers after delivering his farewell
speech to the General Assembly. In it he made a brief reference to
the Arab-Israeli conflict, simply saying ``we look to a peaceful
solution.''
   Reagan also briefly criticized the United Nations for its
adoption of a resolution in 1975 equating Zionism, the Jewish
aspiration for a national homeland, with racism.
   Unlike other speakers, he did not demand Israel's withdrawal
from the West Bank and Gaza, which the Arabs lost in the 1973
Middle East war, or call for a Palestinian homeland.
   At a picture-taking session with Meguid and Peres, the president
said he wished he could have made more progress toward peace in the
Middle East.
   Murphy said U.S. policy calls both for security for all
countries in the region and that ``the Palestinians must have a
voice in their own future and achieve their legitimate political
rights.''
   The State Department official did not attempt to define the
rights.

<TEXT>
   The widow of Salvador Allende visited
the president's unmarked grave Monday after returning from 15
years' forced exile, and tearfully thanked those who tended the
site in her absence.
   Hortensia Bussi de Allende made the 75-mile trip from Santiago,
the capital, to the Pacific coastal resort town of Vina del Mar
with her two daughters, Isabel and Carmen, and a grandson, Gonzalo.
   Mrs. Allende, 74, spent a few minutes in silence before the
gravestone, which carried only the name of a sister, Ines, and a
brother-in-law. A recently-placed plaque bearing Allende's name had
been removed.
   She brought a bouquet of red carnations and left them atop the
tomb.
   About two dozen sympathizers, most of them working-class women,
embraced Mrs. Allende at the hillside cemetery. Many said they
regularly tended to the gravesite.
   The widow, brushing back tears, told the women, ``I thank all of
you for your faithfulness.''
   ``Faithful to the death,'' several women answered.
   On a concrete walkway in front of the tomb, supporters had
written in red paint: ``Allende Lives On In The People.''
   Mrs. Allende returned to Chile Saturday, 24 days after
right-wing President Augusto Pinochet announced an end to all
official exile. The measure affected 504 leftists, including Mrs.
Allende and her children.
   Allende died on Sept. 11, 1973, during a coup led by Gen.
Pinochet that toppled the elected leftist government. According to
the military, Allende shot himself with a machine gun at the
presidential palace, which was rocketed by air force fighter jets.
The version is widely accepted by historians and even many Pinochet
critics. Allende, a Marxist, had said he would never surrender or
allow himself to be captured.
   A day later, he was buried in Vina del Mar. Mrs. Allende was
flown by the military to attend the ceremony. She and her children
then sought refuge in the Mexican Embassy in Santiago and left the
country.
   Mrs. Allende was not active in her husband's government but
after his death became a symbol of political repression by the new
military government. She became an outspoken critic of Pinochet,
and upon her return said she would support efforts to defeat him in
an Oct. 5 presidential plebiscite.
   If a majority votes yes in the ballot, Pinochet will remain in
power until 1997. If most vote no, an open election will be held
next year and he must hand power over to the winner in 1990.

   Rakowski, then a deputy prime minister, became unpopular with
Solidarity activists as the chief government official responsible
for negotiations with the union during its legal existence in
1980-81.
   Although he had been considered a liberal within the party, he
strongly defended the decision to ban the union in the martial-law
crackdown of December 1981.
   Baka, a party economist elevated to the Politburo in June, also
had been considered a likely candidate for the prime minister's
post.
   Parliament deputy Ryszard Bender, an independent, said Rakowski
may have been chosen over Baka because the party wanted ``someone
with a political, rather than economic, dimension ... And Rakowski

   Both political camps waved victory flags
Monday in the wake of the Bush vs. Dukakis matchup, but polls
indicated the debate was a draw in the opinion of many voters.
   Several analysts said a tie actually worked in favor of one
runner in this race: Michael Dukakis.
   Their reasoning was that since the Massachusetts governor was
less experienced and less well known on the national stage than
George Bush, he gained credibility simply by holding his own
against the vice president.
   A few polling organizations hit the telephones as soon as the
debate stage went black, seeking voters' opinions uncolored by the
analysis of campaign officials or others.
   The Gallup Organization surveyed 337 voters after the debate for
Newsweek magazine and found 42 percent thought Dukakis came out on
top, while 41 percent picked Bush as the winner. Twelve percent
called it a tie and 5 percent had no opinion. The poll had a 6
point margin of error.
   ABC News canvassed 639 voters immediately after the debate and
found 44 percent felt Dukakis won the encounter, 36 percent picked
Bush and 20 percent called it a tie.
   In a CBS News-New York Times poll of 415 debate watchers, 42
percent thought Bush won and 39 percent thought Dukakis won, within
the margin of error of plus or minues five points. And in a Los
Angeles Times survey, 35 percent of 637 viewers polled though
Dukakis won, 34 percent Bush, and 29 percent called it even.
   Lee Miringoff, director of the Marist College Institute for
Public Opinion in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., said, ``Overall, it was a net
plus for Dukakis in that it leveled the playing field forboth of
them.''
   William Schneider, political analyst with the American
Enterprise Institute, said, ``Close means good for Dukakis because
he started out four to six points behind in most of the polls.''
   ``Dukakis effectively demolished the Bush image of him as some
sort of dangerous, radical left-winger,'' said Schneider. ``Bush
had been painting him in very extreme colors for the last month.
... Just by appearing safe and steady and reasonable, I thought he
scored a big point.''
   The Bush and Dukakis handlers began trumpeting victory the
moment the debate ended, and their supporters were for the most
part true blue, too.
   An exception was Illinois Gov. James Thompson, a Republican, who
said, ``Neither guy won and neither guy lost.''
   David Gergen, editor-at-large of U.S. News & World Report and
former Reagan White House communications director, predicted ``this
will make it a more competitive race.''
   Gergen said Bush ``made good, telling points on traditional
values and the differences between the two candidates,'' while
Dukakis ``showed an understanding of the middle class and those
left behind on health insurance, housing, age and the like.''
   An Associated Press panel of six forensic experts gave Dukakis a
narrow victory on their scorecards, 144-141, although three judges
picked Dukakis and three called Bush the winner.
   James J. Unger, director of the National Forensics Institute at
American University in Washington and chairman of the AP judges'
panel, said neither candidate delivered a knockout punch.
   The AEI's Schneider said the debates loom especially large in
this election year because there is no single issue that has
galvanized the voters' attention. He predicted, ``Both candidates
are going to be looking for a knockout blow at the next debate.''
   That will be held Oct. 13 or 14 in Los Angeles. Their running
mates, Republican Dan Quayle and Democrat Lloyd Bentsen, get their
turn in the debating ring Oct. 5 in Omaha, Neb.

<HEAD>Most of Nation Enjoys Pleasant Fall Weather</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Northern Florida and parts of the Great Lakes and Pacific
Northwest got scattered rain Monday, but most of the nation enjoyed
pleasant weather thanks to a high-pressure pattern over the Ohio
Valley and southern Plains.
   Warm and humid air just south of a stationary front across
northern Florida triggered scattered thunderstorms in the area in
the early afternoon.
   A low pressure front moving slowly across central Minnesota
brought widely scattered showers there, while warm air tracking
northward across the Plains moved over cooler air above the
northern Great Lakes, producing rain across northern Wisconsin and
Michigan's Upper Peninsula.
   In the Pacific Northwest, rain was spotty in parts of
Washington, with showers increasingly heavy by nightfall.
   Fair skies and temperatures in the 60s and 70s were the rule for
most of the nation, with readings in the 50s over the northern
Rockies and in the 90s in southern Texas, south Florida and the
desert Southwest.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 47
degrees at Sault Ste. Marie, Minn., to 97 at Palm Springs, Calif.
The nation's morning low was 16 degrees at Gunnison, Colo.
   Tuesday's forecast called for rain showers to spread across the
Pacific Northwest, with the heaviest concentration across northwest
Washington state. A low pressure front stretching from Wisconsin to
Quebec should bring scattered showers into northeastern New York.
Rain was also predicted in southern Georgia and much of Florida.
   High temperatures should be in the 70s and 80s across much of
the nation, dipping into the 60s from the Pacific Northwest into
the northern Rockies, from North Dakota through upper Michigan and
across New England. Maine should see highs only in the 50s. Highs
should be in the 90s across parts of western Oklahoma and southern
Texas, warming into the 90s in the desert Southwest.

   The army said Monday that
clashes last week between leftist guerrillas and troops of the
U.S.-backed government killed 60 people and wounded 100.
   It said that in a one-week span ending Saturday, 30 guerrillas
of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front and 23 soldiers
were killed in the fighting and 36 guerrillas and 54 soldiers were
wounded.
   A communique from the Armed Forces Press Office said two other
people were killed by land mines planted by the rebels and accused
the guerrillas of ``assassinating six peasants.''
   In addition, rebels wounded two peasants, kidnapped two people
and injured eight more in mine attacks, the statement said.
   The communique said rebels destroyed two offices of the
state-owned telecommunications company, a city hall, six vehicles
and 12 electrical system structures during the period.
   No rebel report for the same period was available Monday.
   A rebel attack Monday destroyed another telecommunications
office in Soyapango, four miles east of San Salvador, but no
casualties were reported, military sources said.
   The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said guerrillas
fired on a military helicopter on Sunday in the northern province
of Chalatenango, 54 miles north of the capital, wounding the pilot.
   About 65,000 people, most of them civilians, have been killed in
the nearly 9-year-old war between the guerrillas and the government.

<HEAD>Experiment Would Use Cards Instead Of Food Stamps</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three test projects using plastic magnetic
strip cards instead of food stamps will be conducted in parts of
Arizona, New Mexico and Minnesota, the Agriculture Department said
Monday.
   Assistant Secretary John W. Bode said that nearly 30,000 food
stamp households in the three states will use the cards to see if
the system will be easier for people to use and to help reduce lost
or stolen coupons.
   The projects are scheduled to begin within the next 8 to 12
months and run for at least three years, he said. An evaluation
will be made to see if the electronic system might be used
nationally.
   Bode said the $1.3 million project will operate by running the
plastic cards through a computer terminal at grocery checkout
counters. The cost of the food will be automatically deducted from
the family's todal monthly food stamp allotment.
   In addition, he said, some of the food stamp recipients will be
able to use the same plastic cards for other public benefits, such
as Aid for Families With Dependent Children.
   The department first tested the use of electronic benefits in
Reading, Pa., in 1984, involving 3,400 households. It received high
scores from food stamp recipients, stores and banks, which are
involved in issuing and redeeming food stamps coupons.
   Bode said Arizona will get funding to design its projects, which
will be tested in Mesa, with services to 6,500 households.
   Minnesota will test its system in Ramsey County among 13,000
households, and New Mexico will conduct its test in Albuquerque
among 10,150 households.
   Nationally, nearly 19 million people are getting food stamp
benefits, based on family size and adjusted household incomes. The
program costs about $12.6 billion a year.

<TEXT>
   Congressional and administration officials
were close to agreement Monday on a Pentagon budget which
eliminates some of the objections raised by President Reagan when
he vetoed a defense spending measure last month, congressional
sources said.
   The agreement was being worked out in a series of closed-door
meetings involving Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci and top
Democratic and Republican members of the House and Senate Armed
Services committees, said the sources, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   Under terms of the proposed agreement Reagan's cherished Star
Wars anti-missile program would receive $4.1 billion, a figure far
under his $4.8 billion he requested for the fiscal year starting
Oct. 1, the sources said. The Strategic Defense Initiative, as the
program is formally known, currently receives $3.9 billion.
   But the compromise would drop some restrictions in the SDI
budget to which Reagan had objected in the bill he vetoed Aug. 3,
the sources said.
   Reagan wanted $330 million for SDI work which could be used for
an early-stage deployment system, but the Democratic-controlled
Congress had restricted spending on that program to only $85
million.
   The compromise also drops a restriction which had been added by
Congress on testing of depressed-trajectory missiles, a type of
atomic-tipped weapon being developed by the Pentagon.
   Overall, the bill would provide about $300 billion for the
Pentagon, the same as the earlier bill, but slightly less than the
current $302 billion.
   Agreement on the Pentagon budget would dramatically enhance the
prospects that all 13 appropriations bills needed to finance the
government would be enacted by Saturday, the first day of the 1989
federal fiscal year.
   The last time work on all 13 spending bills was completed by the
start of the new fiscal year was in 1948.
   House and Senate Democratic leaders have been pressing to
complete work on all appropriations bills to avoid Reagan and the
GOP painting the Democrats as inefficient and incapable of adhering
to the budget process.
   Last December the Democratic-controlled Congress sent the
president a 1,400-page, $600 billion catch-all spending bill that
arrived at the White House nearly three months into the new fiscal
year. During his State of the Union address in January, Reagan
threatened to veto any similar giant spending bills this year, and
scores of lawmakers signed letters pledging to support him.
   This year's appropriations work was made easier by the budget
summit agreement reached between Reagan and congressional leaders
in November.
   That pact settled many broad spending questions for 1989, but
disputes over various provisions within several individual bills
have caused delays. Lawmakers have said that the dispute over the
defense bill was the most serious, and that its resolution would
make it likely that all 13 bills would be finished on time.
   So far, Reagan has signed four appropriations bills into law,
and has been sent two others.

<TEXT>
   A panel of business and academic executives
said Monday that America is wasting its human capital, and the next
president must make improved education and training a top national
priority.
   ``Inattention to our human resource needs and the waste of human
potential are eroding our national strength,'' the Business-Higher
Education Forum warned.
   The panel, chaired by University of California President David
P. Gardner, said the nation must forge a new consensus on how to
improve its schools and the capacity of its workers.
   ``Too much of our human talent is being wasted, and a growing
proportion of the next generation is slipping beyond the reach of
the institutions and values of our society,'' it said in a report
called ``American Potential: The Human Dimension.''
   Donald E. Petersen, chairman of the board of Ford Motor Co. and
a leader of a task force that produced the report, told a news
conference, ``The task must be faced and the price must be paid. We
are out of alternatives. From the cradle on, Americans must have
the best in education and training, and we must provide it.''
   The forum, comprised of 80 corporate and university executives,
urged the next president to appoint Cabinet-level task forces or
convene a White House Conference on Human Resources to address
these problems.
   It said math and science education must be bolstered, especially
for the disadvantaged, and it urged every state to follow the
example of North Carolina, Louisiana, Illinois and others that have
created highly selective public high schools for math and science.
   It also called for expanded preschool opportunities, including
day care, health screening and nutrition services.

   George Bush, amid efforts to clarify who
would be liable for punishment if abortions were outlawed,
campaigned in a Democratic region Monday with running mate Dan
Quayle and was cheered loudly when he asked: ``One debate down.
How'd I do?''
   And the vice president gave what seemed a surprising answer to
that question when talking later to reporters. ``I thought it was
kind of about even,'' Bush said.
   Several thousand people turned out at a railroad amusement park
in this west Tennessee community to applaud Bush on his debate
Sunday night with Democratic presidential rival Michael Dukakis.
   Dukakis had his supporters, as well. A plane flew over the park
trailing a streamer that read: ``Dukakis 1. Bush 0.''
   Even before Bush left Winston-Salem, N.C., the debate site,
campaign chairman James A. Baker III said the vice president, after
reflecting overnight, decided he would not favor criminal
prosecution of women who have abortions even if abortions are
outlawed.
   In the debate, Bush said he had not ``sorted out the penalties''
that might be imposed under an anti-abortion constitutional
amendment he favors but that ``there's got to be some penalties to
enforce the law, whatever they may be.''
   Dukakis immediately seized on the answer, saying Bush was
``prepared to brand a woman a criminal for making that decision.
It's as simple as that.''
   Bush made no mention of the potential controversy until asked
about it by reporters at Casey Jones Village in Jackson. ``No
change of mine at all,'' he insisted.
   Bush's appearance with Quayle was his first since they were
together on Aug. 21. From Jackson, Bush campaigned separately at a
barbecue near Atlanta before flying to Cincinnati for an overnight
stay.
   At the event near Atlanta, Bush was asked about a news report
that president Reagan had claimed in a conversation with Sen. Rudy
Boschwitz, R-Minn., that the debate was a near draw.
   ``He's probably right,''Bush said. Even though Bush's aides have
claimed the vice president scored a clear victory, Bush had not
made such a claim during his day of camapign appearances in the
South.
   Addressing a crowd of hundreds, Bush said: ``You know you get up
there in these debates, why sometimes things escape you. Barbara
(his wife), I think, was a nervous wreck, and our daughter-in-law,
Margaret Bush, standing next to her, I think they were biting their
fingernails off,'' he joked. ``But we think it turned out pretty
well.''
   ``I am particularly proud to be standing at the side of my
running mate in whom I have not only confidence but pride,'' Bush
told the flag-waving audience in Jackson.
   ``One debate down. How'd I do?'' he asked. When he got the
response he wanted, Bush said: ``All right. Stay tuned'' _
referring to Quayle's debate Oct. 5 with Democratic vice
presidential nominee Lloyd Bentsen.
   Bush said, ``I loved it last night, I loved it'' when Dukakis
raised the problem of housing for Americans. He said interest rates
were 21 percent under the last Democratic administration and
``America does not want that anymore.''
   Using a football metaphor, Bush said that when Republicans took
over the White House in 1981, America's economy ``was in punt
formation, deep in our own end zone.
   ``And now we're marching down the field, heading toward the goal
line, and the old Democratic team, that second string, that
punt-on-first down crowd, wants to get back into the game,'' he
said. ``No thank you. No thanks. Let's hold the ball. Let's keep
moving forward. Let's take it into the score.''
   Bush's debate answer on abortion _ one of the most explosive and
divisive issues in politics _ gave Dukakis an easy target to
exploit. Bush's staff moved quickly to remove it.
   ``We went in and discussed it (with Bush) this morning and
concluded it was an issue that should be addressed and we addressed
it,'' Baker said.
   He said Bush ``would not wish to see a woman labeled as a
criminal, notwithstanding his view in favor of right of life.''
   ``Frankly, he thinks that a woman in a situation like that would
be more properly considered an additional victim _ perhaps the
second victim _ that she would need help and love and not
punishment,'' Baker said.
   He said that ``some consideration could be given ... to
punishment as far as the abortionist is concerned.''
   At an early-morning briefing with reporters, Baker said that
Bush was able to project himself as ``warm, as human and as
likeable'' while Dukakis failed to ``come across as likeable, and
less dour and less technocratic.''
   Baker softened Bush's debate proposal to ``permit people to buy
into Medicaid'' in order for the very poor to have medical
coverage. ``All I know is he thinks that would be an appropriate
approach to explore,'' Baker said.

   One of 10 men accused in the alleged
gang rape of a woman testified Monday he was having an affair with
her and that she insisted on having sex with him outside a shed
where an illegal cockfight was taking place.
   ``She had been drinking,'' said Orlando Garza, 24, who testified
that he and the woman had been seeing each other for about two
months.
   His testimony before more than 160 people in the jammed
courtroom conflicted with the woman's allegations. The woman told
police she was abducted and raped the night of March 26-27 by as
many as 23 men at a ranch where the cockfight was taking place and
in two other locations near this southern Texas town about 50 miles
west of Corpus Christi.
   Garza is the first of the 10 men charged in the case to come to
trial, before State District Judge Ricardo Garcia.
   Garza testified he first saw the woman that night as he was
driving down a street near her home. She flagged down his pickup
truck, got in and they drove somewhere and had sex, he said.
   The woman told him she wanted to see him later that night, but
he declined because he was going to the cockfight, Garza said.
Then, as he and three friends were were driving to the ranch for
the fight, they passed the woman, who insisted on getting in, Garza
said.
   The woman testified earlier she declined to get in the car and
that ``they grabbed me and pushed me in the car.''
   When they got to ranch, Garza said his three companions got out
of the car, but the woman insisted Garza stay.
   ``I wanted to go over there (to the shed) to see the roosters,
but she wouldn't let me,'' Garza said. ``She started kissing me and
we started making love in the car.''
   Afterward, he said he went to the cockfight while she stayed in
the car. He returned later and told her he was going to take her
home because ``she was all crazy,'' Garza said.
   But she got out and followed him to the front of the car, he
said.
   ``Then she started kissing me again and we started making love
on the hood of the car,'' Garza testified.
   Garza said the woman refused to get off the car when the other
men started coming out of the shed.
   He said she finally jumped onto the hood of another car and he
and the three other men left and he went home.
   Garza said when he left she was not having sex with anybody.
   Assistant District Attorney Rodolfo Gutierrez, on cross
examination, pointed out that others had testified Garza was
present when various men were having sex with the woman, and that
Garza and another man assaulted her simultaneously.
   ``And all these people are lying, right?'' Gutierrez asked.
   Garza answered, ``Yes.''
   Garza also denied holding her wrists and having oral or anal sex
with the woman, as other witnesses have testified.
   Earlier Monday, a justice of the peace testified the woman was
dazed and crying when he interviewed her the morning after the
alleged attack.
   ``She was quiet and, you know, she would be facing down most of
the time, facing the floor,'' said Justice of the Peace Amado
Garcia Jr.
   The justice of the peace said the woman, 19, and her husband,
23, filed complaints the morning of March 27. The couple cried
during their interview, Garcia testified.
   ``Sometimes she told me they were all over her and sometimes she
didn't see who it was,'' Garcia testified.
   All 10 men charged with sexual assault are being tried
individually while those charged with kidnapping will be tried in
groups, officials have said. All 10 men have pleaded innocent. A
14-year-old boy also faces charges in the case.

   Three federal appeals court judges sharply
questioned a District of Columbia lawyer Monday about why city
officials had not taken necessary steps to reduce overcrowding at
Lorton Reformatory.
   Circuit Judge Max Rosenn noted that a lower court had found ``an
intransigence on the part of prison officials'' in complying with a
1982 consent decree to limit the population of Lorton's central
facility to 1,125.
   ``There hasn't been a good-faith effort to comply with the
consent decree,'' said Rosenn, a federal appeals judge from
Wilkes-Barre, Pa., who was sitting on the case by special
assignment.
   Circuit Judge Abner Mikva said D.C. prison officials were guilty
of abuse of judicial power in choosing to pay fines imposed by U.S.
District Judge June Green for violating the consent decree rather
than eliminate overcrowding.
   The $250-per-day fines for each of the Lorton facility's 26
dormitories has been ``treated as another operating expense'' by
prison officials, Mikva said. Those fines now total $1.5 million,
according to a lawyer for the inmates.
   Ed Schwab, a city lawyer, argued that prison authorities
couldn't foresee the ``massive increase in the prison population''
resulting from increased drug prosecutions and convictions over the
last five years.
   ``How is that a changed circumstance?'' Mikva said, noting that
city officials knew the physical capacity of the central facility
when they agreed to the consent decree to settle the lawsuit by
prisoners complaining of overcrowded and filthy conditions at the
prison in Lorton, Va.
   ``There is no basis for anyone to find that the increase in the
drug conviction rate was unforseeable,'' Schwab said.
   The city is appealing Green's order directing it to comply with
the consent decree by lowering the population of the central
facility, which has fluctuated between 1,400 and 1,500 inmates in
the last two years.
   Peter Nickles, who represents the inmates, called the district's
request that the judge modify the consent order ``a calculated
attempt to postpone the court's order to enforce the decree.''
   Both Mikva and Judge Douglas Ginsburg questioned the city's
threat to refuse to take new inmates convicted of felonies if it
were forced to comply with the consent decree.
   Ginsburg wanted to know the number of inmates serving sentences
for misdemeanors who could be released to make room for newly
convicted felons. Schwab couldn't produce a figure, drawing further
rebuke from the court.
   ``The representation to the court that the system will have to
be closed _ that is like saying there is nobody in the system who
is less dangerous than someone who is about to be convicted,''
Ginsburg said. ``That's not really credible.''
   Mikva also chastised Schwab for depicting a prison department
``at war with'' the mayor and City Council over corrections policy.
   ``If you've got problems with the mayor and the City Council you
have my deepest sympathy, but these aren't legitimate reasons to
modify the consent decree,'' Mikva said.

<TEXT>
   Twenty-four members of the political
opposition ended a hunger strike Monday but vowed to continue their
non-violent campaign against the leftist Sandinista government.
   The hunger strike by members of the Nicaraguan Democratic
Coordinate began Friday after the government barred a planned
Sunday demonstration. Interior Minister Tomas Borge said the march
had been called to provoke the authorities.
   Ramiro Gurdian, vice president of the coordinate, a center-right
coalition of 16 labor groups and political parties, called the
hunger strike the first in a series of peaceful anti-government
actions. He told a news conference that other actions could include
longer fasts or work stoppages.
   The strikers said they also were demanding the release of 38
Nicaraguans jailed July 10 after an anti-government demonstration
in the southern city of Nandaime. The government says the detainees
will be tried.
   ``There is no judicial liberty in Nicaragua!'' yelled Luis
Andara Ubeda, a coordinate member.
   He said the detained political leaders were being kept in
``inhuman'' conditions at a prison in Granada but ``their hearts
are filled with patriotism that Nicaragua will return to being a
republic.''
   Opposition leaders also lashed out at U.S. House Speaker Jim
Wright, D-Texas, who said the CIA backed opposition groups in an
internal destabilization plan. Gurdian claimed Wright ``jeopardized
the Nandaime prisoners.''
   ``His (Wright's) comments put into danger the lives of the
opposition and gives the Sandinista Front more reason for deeper
repression,'' said Erick Ramirez, president of the center-left
Social Christian Party, in an interview.
   The Sandinistas said Wright's comments supported what they had
been saying all along.
   The National Endowment For Democracy, a U.S. government-funded
organization, provided more than $600,000 for civic opposition
groups in Nicaragua. Those who received the funds have been
identified as the opposition newspaper La Prensa, two
anti-government labor unions, the Superior Private Enterprise
Council, the Nicaraguan Conservative Party and the Nicaraguan
Democratic Coordinate.
   Ramirez said his group does not receive any U.S. funding.
   Members of Nicaragua's fragmented opposition note they have
remained in their country to fight against the Sandinistas rather
than leave, take up arms and join the U.S.-backed rebels, known as
Contras.
   Ortega and other Sandinista leaders recently have referred to
the opposition groups as ``unarmed Contras.''
   Ramirez also said he signed an agreement with Eden Pastora on
Sunday in Costa Rica to join forces in the political opposition.
Pastora, whose nome de guerre was Commander Zero, is a former
Sandinista guerrilla who switched sides after the Sandinistas came
to power and led the Contras in the southern front near Costa Rica.
   Pastora, who left the Contras in 1986, has talked about
returning from exile in Costa Rica.
   Ramirez seeks a broad-based center-left opposition to fight the
Sandinistas politically.
   ``It can't be with the right or the extreme left, not with
Washington and not with Moscow. It's an option away from
extremes,'' he said.
   The Sandinistas came to power in a 1979 revolution that deposed
rightist President Anastasio Somoza. The Contras have been fighting
the government since 1981.

<HEAD>New Party Chooses `Democrats' Title, Rejecting `Liberal'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BLACKPOOL, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Members of Britain's new centrist
party, the Social and Liberal Democrats, voted overwhelmingly
Monday to call themselves the Democrats for short.
   The vote by a show of hands at the party's first annual
conference in this north England resort upset some members of the
old Liberal Party who wanted the short title Liberal Democrats, to
include their former party's historic name.
   The Social and Liberal Democratic Party was formed last March
from a merger of the long-established Liberal Party and most of the
7-year-old Social Democratic Party. David Owen, the Social
Democratic leader, refused to join and is a leading a separate
faction.
   Legislator Sir Russell Johnston, a former Liberal, said
excluding Liberal from the short title was ``extraordinary folly.''
   ``For me, the world Democrat simply has no clear political
meaning,'' he said.
   He said the new short title implied that Britain's two major
parties, the governing Conservatives and opposition Labor Party,
``are not democrats.'' ``They are,'' added Johnston.
   The new parties obtained 20 percent of the vote in an electoral
alliance at the last general election in 1987.
   But the acrimonious merger slashed support. A Harris poll
published Sunday in the liberal Observer newspaper showed the
Democrats with eight percent support and Owen's faction with five
percent.
   The Liberal Party dates to the 1840s and was one of Britain's
two major parties until Labor supplanted it in the 1920s.

<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis and George Bush exchanged post-debate jabs from
a distance Monday, the Democrat saying his rival would ``lead
America nowhere'' and the vice president charging his opponent with
trying to obscure a liberal past.
   The two candidates renewed campaign hostilities as their aides
waited for the impact of Sunday night's nationally televised debate
to show up in the close race for the White House. The first polls
rated the 90-minute confrontation a tossup, and Bush himself said
he thought the debate went ``kind of about even.''
   Dukakis moved to exploit the debate to his advantage as aides
rushed two new television commercials into production containing
snippets of his performance. One shows the Democrat delivering a
portion of his closing debate statement, saying: ``The best America
is not behind us. The best America is yet to come.''
   Bush joined running mate Dan Quayle at a campaign rally in
Jackson, Tenn., and said, ``One debate down. How'd I do.'' The
crowd cheered and Quayle provided the answer, declaring Bush the
victor.
   But Bush said later at a barbecue near Atlanta, ``I thought it
was kind of about even.''
   Bush had been asked about a news report that president Reagan
had claimed in a conversation with Sen. Rudy Boschwitz, R-Minn.,
that the debate was a near draw.
   ``He's probably right,'' Bush said. Even though Bush's aides
have claimed the vice president scored a clear victory, Bush has
not made such a claim during a day of camapign appearances in the
South.
   ``After last night, for most people the notion of President
Dukakis is a very, very troubling notion today,'' Quayle said in
Jackson. That was an attempt to reverse Dukakis' debate-night
declaration that the prospect of a President Quayle was a troubling
idea for many people.
   Despite the outward display of confidence, Bush and his aides
sought to deflect any repercussions from the vice president's
debate comment that he hadn't decided whether women who obtain
abortions should face legal penalties.
   Campaign manager James A. Baker III told reporters that after
giving it more thought overnight, Bush was opposed to the idea.
Bush told reporters he had ``no change'' on the subject, although
during the debate he said he hadn't ``sorted out'' the subject of
possible penalties.
   Dukakis' first appearance of the day was in Cleveland, where he
said the debate provided ``the best moments of this whole
campaign.''
   In remarks intended to rebut Bush's charges of liberalism, the
Massachusetts governor said: ``We heard a lot of talk last night
from Mr. Bush about the mainstream. But it's clear that he's
willing to leave American families high and dry.''
   Bush, he said, ``offers the easy way. He sees no challenges, he
offers no solutions, and he will lead American nowhere as president
of the United States.''
   Addressing a crowd of 3,000, Dukakis said he had asked Bush to
explain how he'd bring down those massive federal deficits without
raiding the Social Security trust fund. ``And what did he say? Not
one word,'' Dukakis said.
   Just as Bush's managers sought to minimize damage of the
abortion issue, Dukakis' aides tried to deflect controversy about
the ACLU, a civil-rights organization that counts Dukakis among its
members. Bush has criticized Dukakis for joining the group, and
said during the debate that the ACLU favors relaxing child
pornography laws, wants to eliminate the current system for movie
ratings and opposes the Catholic Church's tax exemption. Dukakis
spokesman Dayton Duncan said the governor disagreed with the ACLU's
position on each of the issues cited by Bush.
   ``Last night he suggested that I agreed with every position ever
taken by the ACLU, and that is nonsense and I know it,'' he said in
Jersey City, N.J., ``Two months ago, I signed one of the toughest
child pornography laws in the United States. I've always supported
tax exemptions for religious institutions. And I certainly don't
support Oliver North, who the ACLU is defending.''
   Bush and his Democratic rival clashed sharply on a variety of
domestic and foreign issues Sunday, and public opinion polls said
the debate was roughly a draw. That type of outcome traditionally
favors the out-of-power candidate, and one analyst said that was
exactly what happened.
   ``In essence, the debate served to restart the campaign.'' said
Lee Miringoff, director of the Marist College Institute for Public
Opinion in Poughkeepsie, N.Y. ``Overall, it was a net plus for
Dukakis in that it leveled the playing field for both of them.''
   Newsweek said a poll taken immediately after the debate found
that 42 percent of the voters who watched on television said
Dukakis did a better job while 41 percent said Bush outperformed
his rival. The margin of error is plus or minus 6 percentage points.
   An ABC poll taken Sunday night found that 44 percent rated
Dukakis the winner, 36 percent gave the edge to Bush and 20 percent
said it was a tie.
   Those participating in the survey said in advance of the debate
that they supported Dukakis by a margin of 48 percent to 46
percent, with 6 percent undecided, said network polling analyst
John Brennan.
   In the survey taken immediately after the debate, 52 percent
said they supported Dukakis, 45 percent supported Bush and 3
percent were undecided. Given the 4.5-point margin or error,
Brennan said, the shift in sentiment was statistically meaningless.
   In a CBS News-New York Times poll of 415 debate watchers, 42
percent thought Bush won and 39 percent thought Dukakis won, within
the margin of error of plus or minues five points. And in a Los
Angeles Times survey, 35 percent of 637 viewers polled though
Dukakis won, 34 percent Bush, and 29 percent called it even.

   Investigations began Monday at a
police academy into whether strenuous exercise contributed to the
hospitalization of 16 cadets for exhaustion and dehydration,
including one who needs a liver transplant.
   Several stricken cadets refused to be interviewed Monday without
clearance from Gary Egan, director of the Edward J. Connelly
Criminal Justice Training Center in Agawam. He was taking part in
the internal investigation and unavailable.
   But one former trainee said the training routine was severe.
   ``I've been through basic training in the Army and it was twice
as bad as that,'' said Mike Purcell of Northampton, who quit the
academy after one day. ``The doctors told me that if I had gone
back for a second day, I could have suffered permanent kidney
damage.''
   Timothy Shepard, 25, a Pittsfield police trainee who collapsed
while running on the track Sept. 19, the first day of classes, was
flown to Presbyterian Hospital in Pittsburgh and on Monday for a
liver transplant.
   The operation, which began Monday evening, was expected to take
up to 12 hours, said Pittsfield Mayor Anne Everest Wojtkowski, who
kept in contact with the Shepard family in Pittsburgh.
   A Springfield hospital spokesman said Shepard also suffered
kidney problems, and that several of the other hospitalized cadets
underwent kidney dialysis treatment. Six remained hospitalized
Monday.
   After Shepard collapsed, instructors allowed the recruits to
drink two small cups of water, Purcell said. ``Before that, they
had lined us up at the bubbler twice during the day and only let us
take one cup of water each,'' he said.
   Dr. George Grady, chief state epidemiologist, said his
examination last week found ``it's very clear the exercise was
stressful,'' although he said further investigation may show other
contributing causes.
   Jeff Grossman, a spokesman for the state executive office of
public safety, said investigators from the Criminal Justice
Training Council, which runs the academy, and state police, whose
troopers are instructors at the academy, interviewed the class of
47 men and women Monday. They planned to present findings Tuesday.
   Several local officials, including Wojkowski and North Adams
Mayor John Barrett III, asked the state attorney general's office
to review the training program.
   Wojkowski met Monday with Egan and state police Capt. Thomas
White, and said afterward, ``I was completely dissatisfied with
their responses. I suspect that the incidents are not isolated.''
   Shepard, 25, was the only cadet hospitalized the first day of
classes, but two more were hospitalized the next day and an
additional two the third day of classes, authorities said. Academy
officials urged cadets Wednesday night to seek medical
examinations, and 21 exhibited some of the symptoms ranging from
fatigue and nausea to kidney failure.
   Shepard was in ``tip-top'' shape and had ``worked out for over
six months at least, running and everything,'' to prepare for the
academy, said his brother, Thomas Jr.
   ``He really wanted to be a policeman,'' the brother said. ``He'd
been trying to be one for a couple of years.''
   Grossman said Shepard's condition may have resulted in part from
a ``self-induced, severe diet.'' But Thomas Shepard said his
brother spent the days before reporting to the academy with his
family and ate normally.
   ``He definitely was not fasting. That's total lies. He
definitely was eating fine,'' the brother said.
   Purcell said recruits were required to exercise vigorously and
were kept moving with pushups and laps if they failed to respond
quickly to orders.
   ``We started at 7:30 a.m. with a formation with our gear _ our
jackets, boots and other stuff in a duffel bag weighing 50 to 60
pounds _ and we had to walk to classes carrying the duffel bag
above our heads with one arm,'' he said.
   ``We also moved metal lockers and heavy wood furniture from the
basement up to either the second or third floor of the building,''
he said. ``Everybody was pushed to the limit before we even got to
the physical training part.''
   In February 1987 a young University of Massachusetts officer
shot herself in the head after the first week of the 13-week course.

<HEAD>Official: Namphy is Broke, Will Have to Leave Luxury Hotel This
Week</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUDDY GONZALEZ</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy
is broke and will have to leave the luxurious suite he has occupied
since fleeing here after a coup in neighboring Haiti unseated him
Sept. 17, an official said Monday.
   Deputy Foreign Minister Fabio Herrera Cabral said Namphy was
forced to leave Haiti so quickly _ only hours after the coup
carried out by the Presidential Guard _ that he did not have time
to bring money.
   Namphy's bills at the Dominican Concorde Hotel will be paid by
the Dominican government but he will have to leave the hotel by
week's end, the official said.
   In a televised interview, Herrera said Namphy has received some
economic aid from a group of Haitian businessmen residing in the
Dominican Republic and from Dominican friends.
   The deposed general is accompanied in exile by his wife,
Gabrielle, and daughter, Melissa.
   Herrera denied that Namphy had made an official petition for
permanent political asylum in the Dominican Republic, as was
reported by a Foreign Ministry source last week.
   However, he admitted that Namphy has made it obvious he wants to
stay in the Dominican Republic, which shares the Caribbean island
of Hispaniola with Haiti.
   Herrera indicated that Namphy's presence in the Dominican
Republic will not affect relations with Haiti.
   ``He (Namphy) says that he was never a politician, that he was a
military man, that his military career is over now and that he is
not interested in any political or military position,'' Herrera
said, speaking about discussions he had with the former Haitian
leader.
   ``It seems that Namphy never thought he would have to leave his
country and ... because of the circumstances under which he had to
do it he was unable to bring any money,'' Herrera said.
   The deputy foreign minister said Namphy's friends are searching
for a modest but secure house for the deposed general and his
family to move into by the end of this week.
   Herrera also denied rumors that Franck Romain, the ousted mayor
of Port-au-Prince, left the Dominican Embassy in the Haitian
capital. He said Romain, his wife, daughter and a group of about 10
other persons are still in the embassy waiting for the Haitian
government to grant them safe conduct out of the country.
   Romain is the reputed leader of thugs known as Tonton Macoutes
and is suspected of having ordered the attack at the St. Jean Bosco
Church that left 13 persons dead and 77 wounded. The Sept. 11
massacre was mentioned by the soldiers who overthrew Namphy as one
of the reasons for carrying out the coup.
   Namphy remains secluded in his hotel suite, refusing to speak
with reporters.
   A waiter who is the only person authorized by security personnel

<NOTE>Eds: TOP six grafs new with comments from Dukakis on ACLU issue;
EDITS elsewhere to tighten.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>JERSEY CITY, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democrat Michael Dukakis said Monday
the vice president was wrong in suggesting in the previous night's
debate that he agreed with controversial positions of the American
Civil Liberties Union.
   ``That's nonsense and he knows it,'' Dukakis said.
   Dukakis addressed the ACLU issue at an evening rally in Jersey
City after ignoring the issue earlier in the day even as aides
moved to distance him from positions taken by the civil liberties
organization which he holds a membership in.
   In the debate Sunday night, Bush questioned Dukakis' membership
in the group and noted positions taken by the ACLU, including
opposition to restrictions on child pornography, opposition to
movie ratings and opposition to the tax exemption for the Roman
Catholic Church.
   ``Last night he suggested that I agreed with every position ever
taken by the ACLU, and that is nonsense and he knows it,'' Dukakis
said.
   ``Two months ago, I signed one of the toughest child pornography
laws in the United States,'' he said. ``I've always suggested tax
exemptions for religious institutions. And I certainly don't
support Oliver North, who the ACLU is defending.''
   But ACLU president Norman Dorsen said in New York that Bush had
misstated the organization's positions. And Dukakis aides earlier
had noted that the ACLU had filed lawsuits against Dukakis as
governor of Massachusetts over his plans to use roadblocks to catch
drunken drivers and a policy that effectively bars homosexuals from
becoming foster parents.
   Earlier in Cleveland, Dukakis did not raise the issue, although
Ohio Sen. John Glenn told reporters that Dukakis ``has to respond''
on the ACLU issue. Dukakis made his first campaign stop in
Cleveland, a reliable Democratic stronghold in a major industrial
state, after his first nationally televised confrontation with Bush
in Winston-Salem, N.C., on Sunday.
   Before an estimated crowd of 3,000 people in Cleveland's Public
Square, Dukakis belittled Bush's debate answers on questions such
as Social Security, Medicare and the federal deficit.
   ``I asked George Bush to explain how he'd bring down those
massive federal deficits without raiding the Social Security trust
fund,'' Dukakis said. ``And what did he say? Not one word.''
   On each issue, he asked what Bush's answer had been and elicited
the crowd's response: ``Not one word.''
   ``Mr. Bush offers the easy way,'' Dukakis said. ``He sees no
challenges. He offers no solutions. And he will lead America
nowhere as president of the United States.''
   Dukakis recalled former President Kennedy's crucial debate with
GOP Vice President Richard Nixon in 1960, and said Kennedy also had
chosen Cleveland for his first post-debate appearance.
   ``And all of you know what happened,'' Dukakis said. Kennedy won
the debate and the election that year, although he lost Ohio.
   ``Last night, we got down to the real issues in this campaign,''
Dukakis said. ``We heard a lot of talk last night from Mr. Bush
about the mainstream. But it's clear from what we heard last night
that he's willing to leave American families high and dry.''
   Dukakis' week-long campaign swing will take him to several of
the biggest states he is seeking to win. By week's end, he also
will have visited Illinois, Pennsylvania, New York, Texas and
California.
   Campaign manager Susan Estrich said overnight polls showed
Dukakis was judged as decisive winner of the debate, although she
disclosed no details. She said campaign surveys showed ``a very
strong increase in the governor's favorabilities,'' or people
responding favorably to Dukakis.
   Dukakis aides released a list of 16 Bush statements during the
debate that they contended were errors or distortions.
   They noted Bush's debate statement that he wants ``to be the one
to banish chemical and biological weapons,'' but said he cast three
tie-breaking Senate votes as vice president to renew production of
chemical weapons after a 17-year moratorium.
   The aides said Bush praised the Surgeon General's effort to
educate the public about AIDS, but that the Reagan administration
opposed sending AIDS educational materials to households until
forced by Congress.

<TEXT>
   An Aerolineas Argentinas Boeing 737
skidded off the runway while landing at Ushuaia on Monday and the
state-run Telam news agency said the co-pilot, two flight
attendants and three passengers were hurt.
   The attorney general's office in Buenos Aires said a federal
judge and two federal prosecutors among several passengers who
suffered minor injuries.
   The airline, however, issued a statement saying 56 passengers
were aboard and that neither they nor any of the flight crew were
injured in the incident at this small town 2,000 miles south of the
capital city of Buenos Aires.
   Attempts to reconcile differences in the accounts proved
unavailing.
   Telam gave the number of passengers aboard as 120 and cited the
local radio station LRA 10 Radio Nacional de Ushuaia as saying
several passengers and flight crew were injured. Telam said victims
were treated at Ushuaia Hospital for concussions, fractures and
other injuries.
   The landing on the short runway lodged between mountains and the
Beagle Channel took place during severe crosswinds, Telam reported.
The agency said one wing cracked before the plane came to rest at
the edge of the channel.
   Flight 648 departed Buenos Aires at 6:30 a.m. and made two stops
before landing at Ushuaia at 11:35 a.m., Telam reported.

   U.S. negotiators met separately with
Angolan-Cuban and South African delegations Monday as a new round
of Angolan peace talks opened. The Americans were clearly hopeful
of an accord.
   Chester Crocker, the U.S. assistant secretary of state for
African affairs, sat down with South Africa's delegation to sound
it on an Angolan proposal for the withdrawal of Cuban troops within
three years, conference sources said.
   Later Monday, Crocker met with the Cuban-Angola delegation to
give them South African proposals on the withdrawal, according to
the sources, who spoke on condition their names not be used.
   President Reagan, speaking at the United Nations in New York on
Monday, said that ``years of patient diplomacy and support for
those in Angola who seek self-determination are having their
effect.''
   ``We look forward to an accord between the governments of
Angola, Cuba, and South Africa that will bring about a complete
withdrawal of all foreign troops _primarily Cuban _ from Angola,''
Reagan said.
   South Africa has insisted the estimated 50,000 Cuban troops in
Angola be withdrawn within a year.
   The Cubans are backing Angola's Marxist government, which is
fighting a 13-year-old bush war against guerrillas backed by the
United States and South Africa. The Reagan administration was
optimistic about the talks, but South Africa's
government-controlled radio expressed reservations.
   ``It is now imperative that ... the Angolan and Cuban
governments stop stalling on the agreement to withdraw the Cuban
military contingent from Angola and set a realistic timetable for a
Cuban troop withdrawal,'' the radio said.
   The leader of the South African delegation, Neil Van Heerden,
director-general of foreign affairs, claimed Cubans had moved
beyond a cease-fire line to attack the rebels, the National Union
for the Total Independence of Angola. Angola has denied the Cubans
are involved in the attack.
   South African troops already have pulled out of Angola as part
of the Aug. 10 cease-fire.
   Angola has said it will take four years to send the Cubans home.
South Africa has insisted they pull out before it grants
independence to South-West Africa, also known as Namibia, which
borders Angola to the south. Independence is to be granted within
the next year.
   Some African nations have joined the United States in trying to
persuade Angola to begin talks with the rebels, but it has refused
any official contact.
   Angola was represented at the talks Monday by Lt. Gen. Antonio
Franca, chief of staff of the Angolan military. Cuba sent Carlos
Aldana Escalante, Communist Party Central Committee secretary.
   Other observers were from the United Nations, the Soviet Union,
France and the South-West African People's Organization, which has
been fighting to oust South Africa from South-West Africa.

   Army boats and helicopters took
thousands of marooned people to safety in Punjab state Monday after
four days of incessant rain flooded northern India and killed
hundreds of people, authorities said.
   At least 70 people died in Punjab and floodwaters in the
neighboring states of Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and Jammu and
Kashmir killed nearly 200 others, officials said.
   Agriculture Minister Mohammad Shafi of Jammu and Kashmir state
said at least 34 people were washed away in swirling floodwaters
there since Sunday.
   The toll was expected to rise because communications were cut
off with many villages after rivers overflowed their embankments.
   Relief officials said at least 200,000 people were stranded in
78 villages across Punjab, which produces more than half of India's
wheat and rice. Punjab Gov. S.S. Ray said many of those crops were
destroyed.
   Officials said 35 power stations in Punjab were ordered shut
because of the danger of electrocution, plunging flood-hit areas of
Jalandhar, Ludhiana, Amritsar, Kapurthala and Hoshiarpur into
darkness. Disrupted road and rail links and continued rains
hampered relief efforts.
   The Yamuna River was flowing ``well above danger levels'' in the
federal capital of New Delhi, according to officials at the Flood
Control Center, and villagers living along the river bank were
being evacuating to higher ground.
   A government spokesman told reporters in New Delhi on Monday
said no threat to the city itself existed, although water levels
were rising.
   Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi appointed a crisis management group
of government officials to handle the flood emergency, the
spokesman said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The hardest-hit Pujabi city was Jalandhar, where an estimated
50,000 Indians were isolated.
   ``Our first priority is to evacuate the marooned and to give
them food and shelter,'' Ray told reporters.
   He said 100 boats were pressed into service and another 100 were
requested from the army and the Ministry of Agriculture.
   Helicopters dropped food into stricken areas, but were hampered
by rain.
   Many roads were covered with up to eight feet of water,
officials said. Landslides set off by the rains cut off access to
other roads.
   Rail service among the cities of Ludhiana, Jalandhar and
Amritsar was suspended due to rising rivers.
   Floods caused by summer monsoons are a frequent problem in
India, Bangladesh and Nepal.
   Last month, monsoon-swollen rivers flooded three-fourths of
Bangladesh. The government said at least 1,000 people died.
Newspapers put the toll at more than 2,000.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Rank-and-file soldiers who helped
oust Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy and more than 50 of his military
commanders promised Monday to protect the rights of the poor.
   ``We are not only defending the enlisted men, we are speaking
for all the poor people,'' an unidentified soldier was quoted as
telling Radio Haiti Inter at army general headquarters in downtown
Port-au-Prince.
   ``People have the right to demonstrate, to express what's in
their hearts, as long as they do it peacefully,'' he said, adding
that soldiers would guarantee the safety of demonstrators.
   Another soldier said the 50 or more superior officers who have
been ousted by their troops since the Sept. 17 uprising against
Namphy will not be allowed to return to the army.
   ``We won't allow it,'' he said, adding that soldiers are still
demanding the ouster of more officers because of their unpopularity
or ties to the 29-year Duvalier family dictatorship.
   The soldiers were not identified by the radio station.
   Members of Namphy's Presidential Guard, led by 27-year-old Sgt.
Joseph Heubreux, said they ousted Namphy because they were
``sickened'' by his alleged collusion with thugs of the Duvalier
regime who massacred 13 parishioners and wounded more than 77
others people during a Mass on Sept. 11.
   The soldiers appointed Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril as the new
president.
   Also Monday, soldiers ordered the dismissal of the director of
the general post office, Jean Malette, after employees went on
strike demanding his ouster. Malette was replaced by Jean-Claude
Jean-Jacques, a managerial level employee.
   Employees of state agencies, following the example of Haiti's
7,000 soldiers, have ousted the unpopular directors of the state
flour mill, telephone company and water authority.
   Jacques Armand Charles, the new state prosecutor, was sworn in
Monday at the Palace of Justice, replacing Namphy-appointee
Mireille Zamor Pluviose.
   Meanwhile, Haiti Inter and Radio Metropole reported Monday that
former members of the Tonton Macoutes, the private army under the
Duvalier regime, killed three peasants who were protesting their
presence in Verrette, a village 60 miles north of the capital.
   The alleged Tonton Macoutes were accompanied by local police
Chief Dumarsais Charles, the radio stations reported.
   The regime begun by dictator Francois ``Papa Doc'' Duvalier in
1957 ended when his son, Jean-Claude, fled into exile in February
1986. Namphy took over as head of a three-man junta until Leslie
Manigat was elected president last January in balloting widely
thought to be fraudulent.
   Namphy ousted Manigat in a coup last June.

   President Reagan on Monday proposed making $2
million available to pay for the transition from his administration
to that of his White House successor.
   In a move that is subject to congressional approval, Reagan said
he wanted to give the General Services Administration authority to
transfer the funds for the purposes of carrying out a smooth
transition of power.
   Reagan also proposed a change in language contained in the
Labor-Health and Human Services appropriations bills which would
permit the use of available funds for the construction of a single
office building on the campus of the Naional Institutes of Health
to consolidate AIDS-related activities of the institution in
suburban Maryland.
   This move was recommended to Reagan by the commission he named
last year to look into the AIDS crisis.

   An official at Fort Sill Army Post said
Monday the claim by an Apache leader that Vice President George
Bush's father stole Geronimo's skull years ago is groundless.
   Towana Spivey, director of the Fort Sill museum, said to his
knowledge, Geronimo's grave was disturbed one time, shortly after
his death in 1909, but the body was not disturbed.
   Geronimo, the famous Apache leader, died at Fort Sill in 1909,
and was buried there.
   But some members of the San Carlos Apache tribe in Arizona
believe Geronimo's skull was stolen years ago by Prescott S. Bush
and put on display at the meeting place of the Skull and Bones, a
secret society that both Prescott S. Bush and his son, the vice
president, belonged to at Yale University.
   Former San Carlos tribal chairman Ned Anderson said his
information comes from a 55-year-old document called ``History of
Our Order'' _ purportedly a chronicle of Skull and Bones activities.

<TEXT>
   The brother-in law of Rep. Robert Dornan
denied he is homosexual and is suffering from AIDS, despite an
emotional public description of his alleged ailment by the
conservative congressman's wife.
   Douglas Richard Hansen, 51, a San Diego landscape architect,
angrily denounced comments made Sept. 18 by his sister, Sallie
Dornan.
   Mrs. Dornan told a Garden Grove town hall meeting she lost her
temper and called a gay demonstrator a ``fag'' because she was
distraught over her homosexual brother's battle against AIDS, the
Los Angeles Times reported.
   Hansen denied he is homosexual, saying he is healthy and has
seen his sister only once since their mother's funeral in 1983.
   Hansen, who threatened to file a defamation lawsuit against the
Dornans, said he came forward for two reasons: ``To defend my good
name and to blast that guy (Dornan) out of the water, too. He's a
turkey.''
   Dornan and his wife both declined to comment, said Brian
Bennett, Dornan's chief of staff.
   ``It has no bearing on his responsibility as a U.S.
congressman,'' Bennett said. ``It's a matter between his wife and
her brother.''
   Hansen said that because he had many gay friends and feared even
casual contact with them might expose him to the disease, he had
been tested for the AIDS virus four or five times in the last two
years. All the tests were negative, he added.
   ``Why does she come off the wall and say something like this,''
Hansen said. ``I can't believe it. She's been in politics for
years, and she's got to do this to me? I can't believe it.''
   Dornan, a Republican running for a third term, has been
criticized by gay activists for his stand against
anti-discrimination legislation and his opposition to having any
gay caucus within the GOP.
   The congressman's daughter, Robin, said her parents would not
respond to inquiries about Hansen.
   Responding to questions about how the Dornans learned of
Hansen's alleged illness, Robin Dornan said: ``That's personal.
There's been communication. That's all I'm going to say.
   ``It's something that's very, very sensitive and very personal
and very sad. We just want to communicate with him and we don't
want him to be sick and alone.''
   Mrs. Dornan described her brother's condition to the crowd of
200 at the forum.
   ``He tells me every day; the thinner he gets, the sores covering
his body,'' she said.
   Robin Dornan said her mother was speaking in the future tense
about what she feared would happen to her brother in the advanced
stages of the fatal illness.
   The Times reported that Hansen appeared robust and healthy
during the interview.
   ``I'll take an AIDS test anytime,'' Hansen said. ``I'm a healthy
51.''
   He held out his arms and referring to the purple lesions that
are symptoms of a skin cancer common among AIDS patients, he asked,
``Do you see any spots?'' As for his weight, Hansen grinned and
said, ``I'm getting a little porky.''

   A Mexican drug trafficker on Monday became
the second of a trio of defendants to be found guilty in torture
and slaying of a American undercover drug agent in Mexico in 1985.
   Rene Verdugo Urquidez, described by prosecutors as the chief
lieutenant of reputed Mexican drug czar Rafael Caro Quintero, was
convicted on five counts of conspiracy, kidnapping, murder and two
counts of violent acts in support of racketeering. The two acts
were the murders of Drug Enforcement Administration Agent Enrique
Camarena and his pilot, Alfredo Zavala Avelar.
   The U.S. District Court jury, which had earlier convicted a
co-defendant in the case, returned its verdict on Verdugo, 36, in
its fourth day of deliberations. However, the panel didn't
immediately decide on the charges against a third defendant, and
planned to resume deliberation on Tuesday.
   Verdugo, an admitted drug trafficker, and his attorneys sighed
in disappointment when Judge Edward Rafeedie read the first guilty
verdict. The lawyers had argued that Verdugo was a scapegoat used
by the U.S. and Mexican governments to close an embarrassing and
internationally sensitive case.
   Defense attorney Michael Pancer, who had argued passionately for
Verdugo's acquittal, told reporters: ``It's a black day in U.S.
justice.
   ``They brought in trumped-up evidence in the case, lied to the
jury and got away with it. Rene is innocent. They flat-out fooled
this jury.''
   Prosecutors declined immediate comment.
   In the trial, prosecutors alleged that Caro ordered the killing
of Camarena and Zavala in retribution for the agents' role in the
seizure of a multimillion dollar load of marijuana destined for
sale in the United States.
   The chief evidence against Verdugo came from government
informants, including drug smugglers who said they heard him
discuss the Camarena killing.
   The sole piece of physical evidence against Verdugo was a single
strand of his hair found at the Guadalajara estate of Caro, where
Camarena is believed to have been tortured and killed.
   Evidence at the trial showed the agent and pilot were tortured
with red-hot metal pipes and beaten so severely that Camarena's
skull was crushed.
   One witness who had a plea bargain with the government told of
seeing Verdugo at the villa on the day of the murder and related a
conversation in which Verdugo spoke of ``a problem'' that had been
taken care of.
   Sentencing for Verdugo was set for Oct. 26.
   The third defendant, Jesus Felix Gutierrez, a former Los Angeles
seafood company owner, is charged with helping Caro escape to Costa
Rica after the killings.
   The battered bodies of Camarena and Zavala were found at a
remote Mexican ranch on March 5, 1985.
   Last Thursday, jurors convicted Raul Lopez Alvarez of the
murders. His sentencing was set for Oct. 24.
   In a related development, Caro, 37, and an associate, Ernesto
Fonseca Carrillo, were convicted in Mexico Thursday on narcotics
and weapons charges. Caro was sentenced to 34 years in prison and
Fonseca to 11 years.
   The 28-year-old Lopez, a former member of the Mexican state
police in Guadalajara, was the subject of the trial's most dramatic
evidence. Prosecutors showed jurors a secretly recorded videotape
of Lopez discussing details of Camarena's death with an undercover
DEA agent.
   Lopez said on the tape that Camarena's killing was a mistake
that occurred when Caro ``got carried away.''
   The cases against the two other defendants relied heavily on the
testimony of informants and drug dealers. Physical evidence against
all defendants was slim.
   Attorneys for Verdugo and Felix said they were victims of
political corruption in Mexico and an untruthful prosecution in Los
Angeles.
   Nine men were indicted in Los Angeles but only three were tried
here. One defendant subsequently died. Four, including Caro and
Fonseca, were tried in Mexico on narcotics and murder charges.
Verdicts have not yet been reached on some of those charges,
including those of murder.
   Another defendant, former Mexican federal police commander
Armando Pavon-Reyes, was convicted and sentenced in Mexico on
charges of helping Caro escape.

   About two dozen demonstrators, protesting the
lack of affordable housing, were arrested Monday when they blocked
a roadway on the grounds of the U.S. Capitol, according to police.
   The demonstrators were part of a larger group which has
scheduled daily protests near the Capitol until the elections in
November.
   Those arrested were 24 members of Justice House in Roanoke, Va.,
and two juveniles.
   A police spokesman said the protesters had broken away from the
main demonstration and had tried to enter the Capitol while
carrying a wooden cross that had been made by two homeless men.
   When they were barred entry ``they broke away (from the main

Nichols, a spokesman for the U.S. Capitol police.
   The 26 were charged with obstructing passage on Capitol grounds
and demonstrating without a permit.
   The first charge carries a maximum $500 fine and six months in
jail. The second carries a maximum $300 fine and 90 days in jail.

   George Bush appeared believable and warm
and Michael Dukakis seemed cold, calculating and expressionless,
the traits seen in poker players or negotiators, a body language
expert said a day after the two clashed in their first debate.
   ``I've been disappointed throughout the campaign because there
hasn't been much body language to watch,'' said Judy Riggenbach, a
communications expert who advises businessmen and others about
leadership through verbal and non-verbal language.
   Sunday night's debate provided little more information; both men
restricted by podiums and microphones.
   But there was enough to see to form an opinion.
   ``What I've drawn is that Bush is more believable and credible.
He is much more animated than Dukakis. I didn't see any expression
in Dukakis' eyes. His eyes are very cold. They just don't express
anything.''
   Bush's eyes, however, were expressive.
   ``They twinkled, they sparkled, and in addition, Bush looked at
his audience and his questioners,'' she said. ``Dukakis looked at
the camera and hardly ever changed his eye focus or the position of
his head. He was almost like a robot.''
   Riggenbach, 42, who teaches speech and drama, confesses to being
a registered Republican but ``in between'' and objective in
observing political candidates.
   Dukakis limited his gestures. Bush was expansive, she observed.
   ``Dukakis had two gestures, one with one fist clenched, the
other with both fists clenched and his arms tightly to his sides.
   ``Another gesture was the use of the half-palm, that is, if you
put your palm up, then the fingers inward a quarter-rotation _ that
was his other gesture.''
   Palms down is negative, palms up is positive, she said.
   Bush, she observed, was animated and ``very fluid.''

   A dispute over payment for milk in a
store touched off four days of violence in an overcrowded slum that
hospital officials said killed at least 12 people by Monday,
including a police officer.
   Authorities called in the army and imposed a curfew on the area,
which crackled with the sound of sporadic gunfire Monday.
   A police spokesman said three soldiers patrolling the area were
believed to have been kidnapped early Monday, although no one
immediately claimed responsibility. Enforcement officials searched
for the missing soldiers.
   Police and residents said the violence began with a dispute
Friday between youths and a store owner.
   ``It all started when some boys refused to pay for the milk they
drank at a milk shop,'' said Mumtaz Ali, an area resident. ``The
owner wanted money and started beating the boys. Later, friends of
the boys came to the shop and ransacked it.''
   Four people died when police stepped in to end the dispute. A
curfew ended the violence until Sunday, when residents in the area
heard sporadic firing. A hospital spokesman said eight died Sunday.

   Citing the Iran-Iraq cease-fire agreement, the
Reagan administration said Monday it will end America's
ship-escorting operation in the Persian Gulf while maintaining a
presence there.
   President Reagan's decision to terminate the close-quarter
convoying of neutral commercial ships came after U.S. officials
reviewed how the Aug. 20 cease-fire was working, said White House
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
   The move substantially lowers the U.S. profile in the troubled
waters nearly three months after a U.S. Navy Aegis cruiser shot
down an Iranian civilian airliner with 290 people on board. The
United States said it regretted the accident, and officials have
been weighing a program to compensate relatives of the victims.
   Talking to reporters aboard Air Force One while Reagan flew here
from Washington, Fitzwater said the administration decided to relax
the Persian Gulf sea-lane policing operation only after
``consulting with allies and friends in the region.''
   On Capitol Hill, meanwhile, the House was urged to pass
legislation imposing economic sanctions against Iraq as ``a
concrete expression of congressional outrage against the use of
chemical weapons.''
   A vote on the resolution, which authorizes even sterner future
sanctions if Iraq persists in its alleged poison gas attacks
against it Kurdish minority, was postponed until Tuesday.
   The Reagan administration opposes the legislation on grounds
that it ``would not bring us closer'' to the goal of ending Iraq's
use of chemical weapons.''
   After making a farewell address to the U.N. General Assembly,
Reagan met with Sheik Jaber Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah, the emir of Kuwait,
and also had a session set for later Monday with leaders of the
Gulf Cooperation Council, which is headed by Saudi Arabia.
   During the meeting with the Kuwaiti official, Reagan was asked
why the change was being made in the U.S. military operation.
   ``It's just a little difference in the way it's being done.
That's a Navy decision because of the new situation ... thus
cease-fire.''
   The president said he thought the emir would recognize that ``we
are not lessening our protection of them at all.''
   Asked if there was any chance of normalization with Iran, he
said, ``You know me, I always hope. We're waiting to see what
develops from this cease-fire.''
   Fitzwater said it would take a few days to revamp the U.S.
military presence in the region. He said there would no formal
announcement when that takes place.
   In effect, the United States will replace its close-quarter
escorting of commercial ships with a sort of arms-length
surveillance operation. The formation was likened by U.S. officials
to a ``zone'' coverage of shipping rather than a ``man-to-man''
coverage.
   The analogy to a kind of coverage used in football means that
U.S. ships will watch selected areas of the gulf for trouble,
rather than focusing the protective operation on individual vessels.
   In his General Assembly speech, Reagan said the world can feel
``the uplift of hope'' in the gulf war, which he called ``one of
the bloodiest conflicts since World War II.''
   ``The resolution and the firmness of the allied nations in
keeping the Persian Gulf open to international shipping not only
upheld the rule of law, it helped prevent further spread of the
conflict and laid the basis for peace,'' he said.
   During a brief exchange with reporters after a private meeting
with U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar, Reagan also
said he hoped the easing of tensions in that part of the world
could lead to the release of nine Americans held hostage by
pro-Iranian elements in Lebanon.
   ``I'm keeping my fingers crossed on that because I have high
hopes,'' the president said. ``I have high hopes.''
   Asked if he thought a hostage-release could be achieved in the
four months remaining in his administration, Reagan replied, ``I
don't know if anything can be done that quickly, but we haven't let
up.''
   Reagan also said, however, that ``I'm superstitious about
calling a no-hitter before the game is over.''
   Fitzwater sought to minimize the significance of Reagan's
off-hand remark. ``What he said was, `I don't want to talk about
hostages because it might be bad luck,' '' the spokesman said,
saying Reagan was alluding to a baseball superstitution that one
never talks about a pitcher who might throw a no-hitter against
opposing batters.
   White House chief of staff Kenneth A. Duberstein, asked whether
something was in the works to advance the cause of the hostages,
said, ``There is nothing new on that.''
   Fitzwater said ``there is no new morsel of information'' to
encourage U.S. officials, and said ``there is no new signal''
indicating a hostage release.
   Reagan told Perez de Cuellar that ``peace between Iran and Iraq
was uncertain,'' Fitzwater told reporters at an afternoon briefing
at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel.
   In announcing the phase-down of the U.S. ship protection
operation, Fitzwater stressed that ``the U.S. intends to maintain
in the gulf the forces required to protect U.S.-flagged shipping
and support our national objectives. These changes in no way alter
our commitment to freedom of navigation in the gulf.''
   The White House said that the modification in the U.S. operation
``entails a change from a tight escort procedure to an `accompany'
regime. In an accompany regime, U.S. forces will be positioned such
that they can take appropriate action if U.S.-flagged ships are
directly threatened.''
   There have been no attacks on neutral shipping in the gulf since
the ceasefire began on Aug. 20.
   The U.S. convoy operation began 14 months ago and involved a
precise Navy formation used to protect against potential Iranian
attacks against Kuwaiti tankers re-registered under the U.S. flag.
   The United States had 26 ships in its Joint Task Force Middle
East, including 17 in the Persian Gulf, as of Sept. 16. The Navy
had conducted 85 convoy operations since the escorts began.

   The Soviet Union praised President
Reagan's farewell speech to the U.N. General Assembly on Monday as
``generally positive'' and the kind of speech he should have used
to begin his presidency, not end it.
   But it also found the speech ``acerbic'' at times and
``self-serving.''
   Last year the Soviet Union was the target of harsh criticism by
Reagan in his General Assembly address.
   In a telephone interview with The Associated Press from Moscow,
Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady Gerasimov called Reagan's speech
on Monday ``in general, positive ... Overall, it was good and
tomorrow (Tuesday) we will listen to the Soviet side'' when Foreign
Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze speaks.
   ``I wish he (Reagan) had started his presidency with this kind
of speech, not finish it,'' Gerasimov said of Reagan's seventh and
final address to the General Assembly.
   Reagan lectured the communist world last year, from Moscow to
Managua, on the virtues of democracy and private enterprise and the
perceived inferiority of their own system. He praised the United
States for what he suggested was a unique harmony with ``the human
heart,'' a quality he claimed was lacking in other forms of
government.
   In 1987, Reagan condemned the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan;
this year he welcomed the Soviet withdrawal and encouraged an early
withdrawal. Last year he condemned Soviet dictatatorship; this year
he cited ``a change going to the source of postwar tensions and to
the once seemingly impossible dream of ending the twin threats of
our time _ totalitarianism and thermonuclear world war.''
   This year, citing the Moscow summit, Reagan said he was able to
speak ``to the young people of the Soviet Union about the wonder
and splendor of human freedom.''
   Gerasimov commented, ``The president's upbeat mood, his optimism
about where the world is going are things we completely agree
with.''
   ``We are also very glad to hear from him his appreciation of
U.N. efforts to maintain international peace and security,''
Gerasimov said.
   ``It is certainly a change in position, which we warmly
welcome.''
   Gerasimov said it was positive that Reagan cited the easing of
international relations, which Reagan said began in the Geneva
summit meeting with Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   ``That sounds pretty good to us,'' Gerasimov said.
   He noted that Reagan said the areas of disagreement on a
50-percent cut in strategic nuclear weapons were decreasing and
that a treaty could be signed within a year.
   ``Both sides wanted this in his administration,'' Gerasimov
said. ``But it proved too difficult. But we agree that the sooner
the better. Within a year is okay with us.''
   The Soviet Union also agrees with Reagan's call for a
renegotiated global ban on the use of chemical weapons.
   Gerasimov said Reagan made some ``acerbic remarks'' and
``self-serving'' comments about the superiority of democracy over
Soviet socialism and restrictions on human rights in the Soviet
Union.
   ``Actually,'' he said, ``the world is really changing.''
   In his speech, Reagan called on Moscow to halt its massive aid
to the Nicaraguan government and Gerasimov remarked: ``In Central
America, we are pragmatic, we are not adding fuel to the conflict.
   ``We say the Guatemala Agreements must be fulfilled, and we are
ready to not give aid to Nicaragua if America stops its own aid to
the Contra rebels,'' Gerasimov said.
   It seemed ``a little bit strange,'' he said, ``that the
president of a big and powerful country raises the danger from
small Nicaragua. It does not sound convincing to us.
   ``The government of Nicaragua is ready to talk to the Contras,
and I think the president exaggerates what really is happening
there.''
   The Guatemala Agreements to which Gerasimov referred was the
signing of a peace plan by five Central American presidents on Aug.
7, 1987. The plan was designed by Costa Rican President Oscar
Arias, who won the 1987 Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts.
   One major goal of the Arias plan was an end to all outside aid
to the region's insurgencies.

<HEAD>James A. Danforth Was Friend Of Quayle Family</HEAD>
<DATELINE>INDIANAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The man who Vice President George Bush says
his opponent is ``ridiculing'' when he refers to his running mate
as ``J. Danforth Quayle'' was an Army hero in World War II.
   Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis has repeatedly
referred to Sen. Dan Quayle, R-Ind, by his full name of J. Danforth
Quayle, a practice Bush condemned as ``beneath this process''
during Sunday's debate.
   James Alexander Danforth rose to the rank of captain in the Army
infantry and earned three Purple Hearts during the war, including
one in the D-Day invasion of Normandy. He died in an Army hospital
in England of the third wound, said Quayle campaign spokesman Jeff
Nesbitt.
   Danforth was a longtime friend of the Quayle family, and his
father attended the University of Illinois with the senator's
grandfather, said James Quayle, father of the senator.
   Danforth and James Quayle were fraternity brothers at DePauw
University in Greencastle, where Danforth served as president of
the university chapter of Delta Kappa Epsilon, James Quayle said.
   ``He was a great guy,'' James Quayle said. ``We lost a lot of
great friends, but Jimmy was the first one that died. What Bush
said was right.''
   Bush was asked during the debate about Dan Quayle's
qualifications to step into the presidency if needed. After
crediting Quayle with 12 years of service in the U.S. Senate and
portraying him as knowledgable on defense and national security
issues, Bush accused Dukakis of ``ridiculing a person's name.''
   ``My opponent says `J. Danforth Quayle,' '' Bush said. ``Do you
know who J. Danforth was? He was a man that gave his life in World
War II, so ridiculing a person's name is a little beneath this
process.''

<TEXT>
   Third World countries led by Brazil, the
world's most indebted developing nation, blamed the industrialized
nations in part Monday for perpetuating their poverty.
   Foreign Minister Roberto de Abreau Sodre of Brazil told the
opening session of the 42nd General Assembly that the Third World
economic picture was dimming ``due to the lack of progress in
international economic relations.''
   ``It is ... sad to note that we, American, Asian, African
brothers, still suffer from the same horrors and the same
desolation which so badly affected our forebears,'' he said,
adding, ``hunger ... is endemically spreading throughout the
continents.''
   A similar theme sounded Monday in West Berlin, where finance
ministers of 22 developed or developing countries demanded ``more
forceful action'' to help Third World countries repay $1.2 trillion
in debts.
   Brazil, with $121 billion in foreign loans, has been among the
strongest Third World lobbyists for debt restructuring and
writeoffs. It signed a comprehensive rescheduling agrement last
week with its Western creditors.
   It is critical of the U.S. view that strong economic performance
in developed countries would trickle down to help the Third World.
   Foreign Affairs Secretary Obed Y. Asamoah of Ghana appealed to
creditors to write off some debts and reschedule others. He urged
nations to work together to raise commodity prices to strengthen
African economies.
   ``In a market place where one group of operators is continually
selling its wares cheaply and buying those of others dearly,
protection needs be given to the weak and vulnerable operators,''
he said. Ghana had an estimated foreign debt last year of $2.8
billion.
   Officials of the seven key industrialized nations in the
non-communist realm _ the United States, West Germany, Japan,
Canada, France, Italy and Britain _ have approved a plan to aid the
world's poorest nations, mostly in sub-Saharan Africa. But Latin
American countries also would like more help.
   Argentina's deputy foreign minister, Susana Ruiz Cerutti, called
for a ``new strategy of global development,'' including debt
forgiveness. Argentina has a $56 billion foreign debt.
   Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland of Norway said her country
spends about 1.1 percent of its gross national product on loans and
grants to developing countries, well above the average 0.34 percent
by other developed countries.
   She urged other industrialized nations to increase financial
aid, saying development and debt are related Third World crises.
   ``The industrialized countries of the North must now demonstrate
that they see the poverty of the Third World as their common
challenge,'' she said.

   Jimmy ``the Greek'' Snyder says he'll
probably vote for George Bush despite his ethnic ties with Democrat
Michael Dukakis.
   ``Because Dukakis is Greek doesn't mean anything to me,'' Snyder
said Monday in a telephone interview from Miami.
   Snyder said Dukakis was ``a tiny bit better'' than Bush in the
presidential debate but Bush remains a 13-10 favorite to win.
   Snyder, who had rated Bush a 7-5 favorite, revised his forecast
after Sunday's debate and said the gap between the candidates was
``just like a point or so _ really insignificant.''
   Snyder was fired as a sports commentator with CBS in January
after making comments about black athletes that some called
offensive.

   Marilyn Quayle says the campaign so far
``hasn't been a picnic'' because of persistent questions about the
background of her husband, vice presidential nominee Dan Quayle.
   But, she said, ``when you have the truth on your side, things
aren't near as trying as they would be.''
   She was in Connecticut to attend a $100-a-person fund-raiser for
the Victory 88 Committee, which raises money to get out the vote
and promote Republicans in general, not for the Bush-Quayle ticket.
   ``We have great faith in the American people and we knew they
would see the feeding frenzy for exactly what it was,'' she said of
media questions about her husband's background and service in the
National Guard.
   Asked if she and her husband had discussed having him drop off
the ticket, Mrs. Quayle said: ``No. This election is far too
important for our country and Dan Quayle has so much to offer the
country, as does George Bush, that there was never any question
that he continue.''

   A mock trial began Monday of industrialized
nations, accused of using their financial muscle rather than
military might to dominate developing nations.
   The prosecution is made up of a group of international activists
called the Permanent People's Tribunal, who opened their four-day
``trial'' of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund.
   The policies and influence of those institutions, now holding
their annual meetings in West Berlin, is tantamount to war on Third
World nations, the activists charged.
   ``The Third World War has already started,'' said Susan George,
an American sociologist and author who has written extensively on
connections between Third World debt and poverty.
   ``This war is a financial low-intensity conflict. It's a
policing action, a way of projecting power into the Third World,''
she said.
   George Wald, who shared the 1967 Nobel Prize in Physiology or
Medicine for his work on the mechanics of vision, expressed similar
views.
   ``The debt has become a major instrument of domination of the
Third World by First World nations,'' the 81-year-old scientist
said.
   Ms. George, who lives in Paris, spoke at the start of the
proceedings. Wald, a retired Harvard professor, is one of 15
``jury'' members.
   Both the World Bank and IMF declined requests by the tribunal to
send someone to speak in their defense.
   Hellmut Hartmann, an IMF spokesman, said at a news conference in
Frankfurt on Sept. 13 the organizations have their own
institutional control mechanisms to monitor their operations.
   ``We don't need such a tribunal,'' he said.
   American economist Robert Triffin has agreed to independently
``defend'' the two organizations during the proceedings.
   In a speech that drew loud applause from about 300 people, Ms.
George charged the United States is using the massive Third World
debt to control developing lands.
   ``The more intelligent people in the Pentagon discovered that an
overt war (to control political conditions) with bombs and troops
and a lot of television probably would result in protests at
home,'' she said.
   She said the United States, through its banks, has a
stranglehold on some developing countries.
   ``You can get your raw materials on the cheapest possible terms.
And you can get control over the infrastructure of indebted
countries, when debt is swapped for control over productive
capacity,'' she said.
   ``The adversary is made to pay for his own oppression, just as
occupying powers have always done.''
   In an interview with The Associated Press, Wald said he agrees.
   ``The Third World debt is a marvelous instrument of control. And
its advantage is, it's so large that it can never be paid back,''
he said.
   Wald singled out the IMF for what he called ``harsh conditions
it attaches to its lending.'' The IMF has fashioned financial
rescue packages for heavily indebted countries that call for
changes in economic policies to bring about healthier growth.
   ``Such programs,'' he argued, ``impose further deprivation upon
what are already some of the world's poorest people.''
   The Permanent People's Tribunal is part of the International
Lelio Basso Foundation, a Rome-based human rights organization
founded by Lelio Basso, an Italian political activist who died in
1978.

<HEAD>Olympic Gold Medal Given To Lewis After Johnson Test Positive for
Steroid</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: New throughout with awarding of gold to American.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Canadian Ben Johnson was stripped
Tuesday of his world-record victory in the 100-meter dash after
testing positive for steroids, and the Olympic gold medal awarded
to American Carl Lewis.
   International Olympic Committee spokeswoman Michele Verdier said
the IOC executive board unanimously approved its medical
commission's recommendation that the medal be withdrawn because
traces of Stanozolol, a water-based anabolic steroid, were found in
Johnson's urine sample after Saturday's race.
   Johnson flew to New York, and his manager said he was shocked by
the test result.
   ``The only thing we can say at this stage is that it is a
tragedy, a mistake or a sabotage,'' said Johnson's manager, Larry
Heidebrecht.
   ``Up to five days before the race, Ben was in perfect condition.
Something has happened in those days,'' he said.
   ``We do not know what happened and how it happened, but
apparently somebody has sabotaged Ben and we will find out who it
was and how it was done.''
   The Canadian sprinter is automatically suspended from
international competition for two years.
   Johnson finished first in his long-awaited showdown with Lewis
on Saturday in 9.79 seconds, four-hundredths of a second under his
own world record set at the 1987 world championships in Rome. Lewis
was second in an American-record 9.92 seconds.
   With Johnson disqualified, an International Amateur Athletics
Federation spokesman said Lewis moves up to first, Britain's
Lindford Christie gets the silver and American Calvin Smith the
bronze.
   The decision revived Lewis' bid for an unprecedented win of gold
medals in each of two consecutive Olympics in the 100- and
200-meter dashes, the long jump and the 400-meter relay. He won the
long jump Monday.
   Johnson was the seventh athlete and third gold medalist to test
positive at the Seoul Games. Officials had predicted 15 positive
tests among the almost 10,000 athletes.

   An activist who campaigned against
organized crime was killed by gunmen Monday, one day after a judge
who sentenced two crime bosses to prison was killed, authorities
said.
   Government officials said the judge's slaying is a sign that
organized crime figures are trying to intimidate authorities.
   ``This is a crime with the clear stamp of the Mafia, aimed at
intimidation,'' Interior Minister Antonio Gava said Monday.
   Magistrate Antonio Saetta, 66, and his son Stefano, 35, were
slain Sunday by gunmen who shadowed their car, rammed it with their
vehicle and stopped it on a country road ouside Caltanisetta in
central Sicily. The assailants fired at least 20 shots through the
windows.
   On Monday, meanwhile, attackers fired on Mauro Rostagno in
Trapani as he drove home from an appearance on local television to
discuss drug abuse and organized crime influence, the Italian news
agency ANSA reported.
   Police in the western Sicilian town called the killing
``Mafia-style'' but said it was under investigation.
   Rostagno was a leader of ``Continous Fight,'' a leftist
organization that organized protests during the 1960s and 1970s. He
moved to Trapani a decade ago and founded a drug rehabilitation
center.
   Rostagno, 46, appeared regularly on a local television program,
campaigning against drug use and organized crime.
   Saetta had sentenced two powerful crime bosses, brothers Michele
and Salvatore Greco, to life in prison.
   ``This assassination is a very serious signal as to how deep and
difficult to extract are the roots of the evil plant of organized
crime,'' President Francesco Cossiga said of the Saetta killing.
   Authorities have linked the slayings of eight magistrates since
1968 to organized crime.
   Premier Ciriaco De Mita said the reaction of political forces
``has to be strong and united.''
   Gava flew to the island of Sicily on Monday for a meeting with
authorities there about the killing.
   Besides the Greco trial, Saetta presided over the trial of three
organized crime figures convicted of killing Capt. Emanuele Basile
of the carabinieri, or national police. The Grecos were convicted
of masterminding the killing of Judge Rocco Chinnici, who had been
investigating their activities.

   A gunman walked into an elementary school
and opened fire Monday, killing an 8-year-old girl and injuring 10
other people, authorities said.
   Police Chief James Coursey said James William Wilson, 19, of
Greenwood had been arrested and charged with murder. No motive for
the shootings was determined. Wilson was being held at the
Greenwood Law Enforcement Center.
   Coursey said that shortly after 11 a.m., Wilson entered Oakland
Elementary School's front door, walked to the cafeteria, pulled a
.22 caliber, nine-shot revolver from his belt and opened fire,
injuring one teacher and three students.
   Wilson left the cafeteria and entered a girl's restroom where
teacher Kat Finkbeiner tried to prevent him from leaving after he
reloaded, Coursey said.
   In the scuffle that followed, Ms. Finkbeiner was shot in the
mouth and hand, he said.
   Coursey said Wilson evaded Ms. Finkbeiner and entered a
classroom two doors away, where he opened fire again, injuring a
teacher and five students and killing one of the students.
   After firing all bullets in his pistol, Wilson dropped the
weapon and Ms. Finkbeiner, unarmed, ordered him to raise his hands
and stand until a police officer arrived.
   Coursey's chronology of Wilson's actions, given during an
evening news conference, differed from that given earlier in the
day by school officials.
   Coursey would not answer questions after making a prepared
statement and did not resolve the conflicting versions.
   Coursey said Wilson had been living with his paternal
grandmother in Greenwood, but traveled to his maternal
grandmother's home earlier Monday.
   There, he said, Wilson took a gun without his grandmother's
knowledge, then stopped at a department store, where he bought two
boxes of ammunition.
   Coursey said Wilson then returned to Greenwood and went to the
school.
   District 50 Superintendent Bob Watson said he knew of no
connection between the assailant and the school.
   ``It appears to be an entirely random incident. The classroom
was chosen randomly,'' Watson said.
   There were about 100 children in the cafeteria when the shooting
occurred and about 21 children in the third-grade classroom, he
said.
   Witnesses said some children ran into the woods when the man
began shooting.
   Physical education aide Phillip Browning said that after the
gunman quit firing, he threw the pistol down and walked out as if
nothing had happened. ``He remained calm and offered no
resistance,'' Browning said.
   The dead child was identified as Shequila Tawonn Bradley, said
Greenwood County Coroner Odell Duvall.
   The 10 injurd were taken to Self Memorial Hospital in Greenwood,
where two pupils, Ms. Finkbeiner and another teacher remained
hospitalized, said spokesman Dan Branyon. He said they ``suffered
fractures ... a number of gunshot wounds.''
   A 7-year-old girl was in critical condition and undergoing
surgery; the others were in fair condition, he said. Six students
were treated and released.
   After the shooting, teachers directed students to the front
lawn, counted them and checked attendance rolls. The school was
evacuated as state troopers, police officers, sheriff's deputies
and school officials arrived. Officers and volunteers combed the
woods for children who might be hiding.
   Some parents came to pick up their children while buses lined up
to take others home.
   Carolyn Davis said she was in the school office to pick up her
7-year-old granddaughter who was sick.
   ``While we were standing there, I heard gunshots. All of a
sudden, teachers were running, children screaming, hollering `he's
shooting, he's shooting,''' Mrs. Davis said.
   ``I got mine into the nurse's lounge and waited there until the
teacher that got shot in the mouth came in with the little girl
that got shot in the neck and four or five other kids,'' she said.
   Marilyn Amick, a first-grade teacher, said she and her students
fled the cafeteria after she saw a man waving a gun around. They
exited through a back door and ran toward the woods.
   Her class sought shelter in a house across the street from the
school until she saw other classes assemble outside. She said she
comforted her students by telling them everyone in their class was
OK.
   Watson said classes had been canceled for Tuesday and that
children would receive counseling when they returned Wednesday.
   Steve Brown, Greenwood city manager, described the town's mood
as very solemn.
   ``Everyone pretty much is saying they have read about these
types of things in other areas but never thought it would happen in
Greenwood,'' he said.
   Gov. Carroll Campbell issued a statement of sympathy for the
slain child's family and other victims and praised teachers for
acting quickly to protect the students.
   ``There are no words to adequately express the feelings of all
South Carolinians as a result of the tragedy which occurred in
Greenwood today. ... I was shocked and saddened by the brutal and
senseless act which took the life of a little, 8-year-old girl and
wounded 10 others,'' Campbell said.
   ``I would like to personally express my appreciation to the
teachers who, I am told, acted quickly to protect the children.
Their actions possibly saved lives,'' the governor said.

   Rock singer Pat Benatar underwent
emergency abdominal surgery on the eve of a scheduled concert but

Atlanta, her publicist said.
   Benatar, 35, and her family are staying with relatives at an

tour, Jocelynn Loebl said in New York.
   ``She's with her husband, Neil (Geraldo), and her baby,'' Loebl

   Benatar was in the Detroit area on Friday for a performance at
the Pine Knob Music Center when she became ill, Loebl said.
   ``After experiencing severe abdominal pain ... Benatar was take
to Pontiac Osteopathic Hospital, where she underwent emergency
abdominal surgery,'' Loebl said. Loebl said she didn't know the
nature of the ailment but said it wasn't appendicitis as had been
reported.
   Benatar, whose nationwide tour coincides with release of her
album, ``Wide Awake in Dreamland,'' will reschedule appearances she
missed in Detroit, Chicago, Cincinnati and Columbus, Ohio, Loebl
said. No dates have been set.

<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Maoist rebels ambushed an army truck in the
highlands Monday and killed five soldiers and wounded six in a
crossfire after crippling the vehicle with land mines, police said.
   Also Monday, the military command in Ayacucho state said an army
patrol killed two rebels in a clash with a column of Shining Path
guerrillas Sept. 20.
   The ambush Monday occurred on a lonely mountain road 27 miles
east of Huancavelica, a state capital 155 miles southeast of Lima.
   Police said rebels had mined a 100-yard stretch of dirt road
with dynamite every 10 yards and that at least nine charges
exploded as the truck passed.
   A lieutenant and four soldiers were killed. Eight soldiers who
escaped harm and some of the six wounded troops managed to repel
the attack and the Shining Path guerrillas withdrew after half an
hour, according to the police report.
   Police said the rebels were believed to have suffered casualties
but took their wounded with them.
   In Ayacucho, a state capital 70 miles southeast of Huancavelica
and 230 miles southeast of Lima, the military command said a patrol
encountered a rebel column on Sept. 20, killing two guerrillas in
the ensuing firefight.
   A military communique said troops captured arms, grenades and
subversive pamphlets in the shootout but that other members of the
guerrilla force escaped. The communique did not say if the patrol
suffered casualties.
   The impoverished countryside around Ayacucho was the birthplace
eight years of the Mao-inspired Shining Path insurgency.
   Since then the violence has spread through much of the country
and more than 12,000 people have been killed.

   Terrorists who fired on the car
of a government finance official have been linked to slayings in
1985 and 1986, authorities said Monday.
   Objects found in a car used by the assailants were ``of a
similar nature'' to evidence from the 1985 slaying of industrialist
Ernst Zimmerman and the 1986 killing of diplomat Gerold von
Braunmuehl, said Alexander Prechtel, a spokesman for the federal
prosecutor's office.
   Prechtel would not elaborate.
   Attackers last week fired on the car of Hans Tietmeyer, the No.
2 official in the Finance Ministry. Neither Tietmeyer nor his
driver were hurt.
   The Red Army Faction, West Germany's most notorious terrorist
gang, claimed responsibility, saying its plans to kill Tietmeyer
were thwarted by a jammed rifle.
   Bonn officials linked the attack to this week's joint World
Bank-International Monetary Fund annual meetings in West Berlin.
   Tietmeyer, a key adviser to Chancellor Helmut Kohl, was actively
involved in planning for the talks.
   On Saturday, Prechtel said investigators identified Red Army
Faction member Birgit Hogefeld as one of the assailants. He said
Hogefeld rented the car under an assumed name before the attack.
   The car was later found in a Bonn suburb a few miles from the
attack site.

   Admirers of poet T.S. Eliot read his works in
Westminster Abbey and in theaters and meeting places around London
on Monday night to mark the centenary of the poet's birth.
   Actress Jill Balcon read Eliot's ``Four Quartets'' during a
service at the abbey, and Eliot's widow, Valerie, laid a wreath at
his memorial tablet there.
   The Poetry Society, Britain's main poetry organization,
organized readings around the capital in churches, concert halls
and other meeting places.
   Ted Hughes, the poet laureate, introduced a Sunday night reading
of ``The Waste Land,'' Eliot's most famous poem, at London's Palace
Theater.
   Thomas Stearns Eliot, one of the major poets of the 20th
century, won the Nobel Prize in literature in 1948. He was born in
St. Louis on Sept. 26, 1888, became a British citizen and died in
London Jan. 4, 1965.
   Many articles about Eliot and his works have appeared in the
British press for the centenary and Mrs. Eliot has edited a first
volume of his letters, covering the years 1898 to 1922.
   ``Her continuing labor of love is everywhere evident in her
editing. ... It is inevitable and right that Eliot should have a
centenary monument; fitting that his widow's life-work should
provide it,'' wrote poet and critic Alan Jenkins in a review of the
book in the weekly Times Literary Supplement last Friday.

   An F-14 fighter jet assigned to the USS Carl
Vinson crashed into the North Arabian Sea on Monday, but the two
Navy fliers who ejected after smoke engulfed the cockpit were
rescued, Navy officials said.
   It was the fifth crash involving the $44 million supersonic jet
in the past month, including one at the civilian Gillespie Field in
El Cajon, Calif., that killed a Navy flier and injured four people
on the ground.
   There have been 99 accidental losses of the aircraft since the
jet's introduction to the Navy fleet in 1972, according to Navy
records.
   The latest crash occurred while the F-14, part of a squadron
based at San Diego's Miramar Naval Air Station, conducted routine
flight operations, Navy spokesman Lt. Cmdr. Bob Pritchard said.
   The pilot and radar intercept officer, whose names were not
immediately available, reported smoke and fumes in the cockpit
shortly before bailing out about 10 miles from the carrier,
Pritchard said.
   A chopper was dispatched from the Carl Vinson and the two were
plucked from the water and returned to the ship.
   ``Both appear to be in good health with no injuries,'' Pritchard
said. The plane sank into the ocean and is not recoverable, he said.
   The carrier was in the North Arabian Sea, just outside the
Persian Gulf, as part of the Joint Middle East Task Force.
   Pritchard said the Navy is disturbed by the rash of F-14
accidents but has no plans to ground the aircraft because there is
no common thread linking the crashes.
   ``They are all unrelated and dissimilar,'' he said. ``Without a
trend developing and with no known mechanical defect as a suspect,
there's no reason to ground them while the incident investigations
continue.''
   He said that prior to Sept. 8, the date of the first of the five
F-14 accidents over the past month, the aircraft had gone through
387 accident-free days.
   Pritchard said that the investigations on those five F-14
accidents remain open.
   ``You can bet we're going to be looking very, very hard at all
aspects of our program,'' he said. ``The bottom line is we want
zero mishaps. Everything that can be done to achieve that goal is
being done.''

   Jesse Jackson urged his supporters to go
door-to-door to sign up new voters who he said could provide a
margin of victory for Democrat Michael Dukakis in November's
general election.
   ``As the Bible tells us, there's power in the word, and the vote
is the word,'' Jackson told more than 1,000 people Sunday at the
founding conference for the state chapter of the Rainbow Coalition,
a multiracial network that Jackson founded.
   He said voters should go ``door-to-door, church-to-church,
synagogue-to-synagogue, school-to-school, and along the highways
and byways of this state'' to register voters.
   In a Sept. 20 letter to Rainbow Coalition board members, Jackson
said the nation's 13 million unregistered blacks and Hispanics
could be the margin of victory for Dukakis, who is running against
Vice President George Bush.
   ``We can't throw away this kind of power by not registering and
not voting,'' he wrote.
   Jackson, who lost the Democratic nomination to Dukakis, has
recently started to make campaign appearances on behalf of the
Massachusetts governor.
   In San Francisco, Jackson told a meeting of 200 labor leaders
and supporters that Bush was running a ``mean-spirited'' campaign.
   ``There's a certain mean-spiritedness in this Bush-Quayle
approach,'' Jackson said of the Republican ticket, which he
criticized for ignoring the needs of many Americans, including
women, minorities, the homeless and the poor.
   Jackson also attended a rally at the University of California at
Berkeley, where he concluded his remarks before a crowd of about
4,000 by urging students to come forward and register to vote.
   A university spokesman called the rally one of the biggest
gatherings in recent years.
   This week Jackson said he planned to visit Tennessee, Georgia
and Maryland this week to urge Rainbow Coalition members to sign up
new voters.

   Mammoth sumo wrestlers joined crowds outside the
Imperial Palace on Monday to pray for 87-year-old Emperor Hirohito,
whose condition stabilized despite continued internal bleeding.
   ``The emperor is in stable condition ... but last night he
discharged a slight amount of blood,'' Kenji Maeda, head of general
affairs for the Imperial Household Agency, told reporters early
Tuesday morning.
   Hirohito had a fever of 98.4 Tuesday, down from around 99 Monday
but still higher than his normal temperature of 95.9. On Saturday
it rose to 102.6, prompting concern about his fate, palace
officials said.
   The stock market was up in early trading Tuesday after
fluctuating Monday, reflecting uncertainty over Hirohito's health.
Majiro Ueda of Nomura Securities, Japan's largest brokerage, said
reports the emperor was in stable condition encouraged investors to
trade more actively.
   On Monday, Hirohito watched television dramas and received his
sons, Crown Prince Akihito and Prince Hitachi, and their wives for
brief chats, palace Maeda said.
   The emperor's imperial duties were transferred to Akihito, 54,
last Thursday.
   The sumo wrestlers, dressed in silk robes, added their names
Monday to registries to wish Hirohito well. Palace officials said
more than 450,000 well-wishers have journeyed to the Imperial
Household Agency's 12 registry sites across the country.
   Doctors found traces of blood in the emperor's bowels for the
fourth straight day, indicating an intestinal hemorrhage had not
been contained. They administered another .43 pints in blood
transfusions, bringing the total since Hirohito first vomited blood
Sept. 19 to 5.96 pints.
   The nationally circulated Asahi Shimbun quoted medical experts
Monday as saying cancer was the likely cause of Hirohito's
continuous discharge of blood.
   Palace officials have refused to confirm or deny news reports
that the emperor has cancer and instead have urged the Japanese
media to refrain from speculation. Cancer is rarely acknowledged
publicly in Japan.
   Outside the moats surrounding the forested imperial compound,
NTT, Japan's giant telephone company, installed a row of free
public phones so well-wishers could call home.
   ``We wanted to do something to be helpful to all the people who
have come out of concern for the emperor,'' said Yuji Itoh, a
company official. More than 16,000 people have used the phones, he
added, most to tell their families they had recorded their names.
   Also Monday, Japan's third-largest newspaper apologized for an
editorial inadvertently published in its English-language editions
expressing sadness at the emperor's demise.
   ``We deeply regret the completely erroneous editorial, retract
it in entirety, and apologize deeply,'' the Mainichi Shimbun said.
It did not explain how the slip at the Mainichi Daily News had
occurred.
   The newspaper also apologized to the government and the palace.

   WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (AP) _ George Bush and Michael Dukakis, each
hesitant to declare victory in their first head-on clash, are
awaiting the voters' judgment about a debate marked by sharp words
on patriotism, Iran-Contra and Bush's choice of a running mate.
Neither committed a serious mistake or landed a knockout blow.
   ``It was a good night,'' Dukakis said after the 90-minute,
nationally televised encounter Sunday at Wake Forest University.
Separately, Bush flashed a thumbs-up sign to supporters and said
the debate had given him a chance ``to spell out some of the
differences.''
   In the first of two face-to-face meetings, there was very little
warmth between the candidates other than the traditional handshakes
at the beginning and end. Bush said he had hoped for a ``little
friendlier an evening.''

   WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (AP) _ The debate was over and gridlock
reigned in the press room. It wasn't reporters trying to reach
George Bush and Michael Dukakis, it was the stampede of political
heavyweights shamelessly promoting their candidate's performance
while making the other guy's seem abysmal.
   Senators and governors competed for reporters' attention and
television's cameras to claim that Dukakis came across as
presidential, humane and compassionate and Bush as plastic and
fuzzy _ or vice versa.
   In political parlance, it is known as the spin patrol and a glut
of spin was spun by politicians brought in for just that purpose.
The Democrats had the likes of Sens. Ted Kennedy and Bill Bradley
and the Republicans had Sen. Alan Simpson, former Sen. John Tower
and New Hampshire Gov. John Sununu.

   Round One of the presidential candidates'
debates went to Michael Dukakis by a slender margin over George
Bush, according to a panel of veteran debate judges who kept score
for The Associated Press.
   Three judges gave the nod to Dukakis, while the other three
sided with Bush, but the Democrat emerged with the most points on
their ballots, 144-141.
   Several hundred television viewers polled by ABC immediately
after Sunday night's debate also thought the Massachusetts governor
was the winner.

   Most state unemployment insurance funds would
have to borrow billions from the federal government to pay benefits
in a future recession because of inadequate reserves, according to
a congressional report released today.
   The General Accounting Office study found the Unemployment
Insurance system's ability to cushion economic hard times for many
Americans has declined as states have tried to manage their
financially troubled programs.
   Created to help working people make it through economic hard
times, the state trusts are tightening eligibility requirements
solely to keep their books in the black, leaving more Americans to
face a bleak future if a recession strikes, the GAO said.

   The economy will slow in 1989 but probably
won't topple into a recession until 1990 or later, economists for
top U.S. corporations predicted today.
   The latest survey of the National Association of Business
Economists found a panel of 60 economic advisers to the country's
largest businesses substantially more optimistic about 1988 and
somewhat more optimistic about next year than it was three months
ago.
   In May, 57 percent of the economists believed the current
expansion, now nearly six years old, would end sometime in 1989.
However, in a survey taken in late August and early September, that
view was held by a smaller but still substantial 47 percent of the
panel.

   Only one vote _ and possibly a few federal
judgeships _ are stopping Senate Democrats from shutting off a
Republican filibuster and passing the first increase in the $3.35
hourly minimum wage since 1981.
   But having lost two cloture votes last week in trying to break
the logjam, Democratic leaders were unwilling to schedule a third
attempt until after Sunday night's debate between presidential
candidates George Bush and Michael Dukakis.
   Republican leaders following a White House-directed legislative
strategy are insisting on paring down by about half the $1.20
increase in the minimum wage that Democrats would like to implement
over a three-year period.

   The Rev. Barbara C. Harris says her election
as the first woman bishop in the Anglican Communion's 450-year
history offers new hope to those who've felt alienated and ignored
by the Episcopal Church.
   ``A fresh wind is blowing across this church of ours,'' Ms.
Harris said Sunday in her sermon at the Church of the Advocate,

   The Episcopal Church is attempting to include everyone in the

   President Reagan told the United Nations
in a farewell speech Monday that this was ``a moment of hope'' for
peace in the world and that a new U.S.-Soviet treaty to sharply
reduce nuclear arms may be concluded next year.
   He called for an international war on drug traffickers,
terrorism and hostage-taking, and vowed to maintain U.S. support
for an armed insurgency against the leftist government of Nicaragua.
   He said the Sandinistas were pursuing ``the oldest, most corrupt
vice of all _ man's age-old will to power, his lust to control the
lives and steal the freedoms of others.''

   Citing the Iran-Iraq cease-fire agreement, the
Reagan administration said Monday it will end America's
ship-escorting operation in the Persian Gulf while maintaining a
presence there.
   President Reagan's decision to terminate the close-quarter
convoying of neutral commercial ships came after U.S. officials
reviewed how the Aug. 20 cease-fire was working, said White House
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
   The move substantially lowers the U.S. profile in the troubled
waters nearly three months after a U.S. Navy Aegis cruiser shot
down an Iranian civilian airliner with 290 people on board. The
United States said it regretted the accident, and officials have
been weighing a program to compensate relatives of the victims.

presidential candidates George Bush and Michael Dukakis, who are
both counting on strong growth to help them reduce the federal

   A panel of 60 economists from the National Association of
Business Economists are bullish about growth this year, predicting
an expansion of 3.9 percent as measured by the gross national
product. That's even more optimistic than the administration's
forecast of 3.5 percent.
   However, the median forecast for next year is an anemic 2.3
percent, substantially less than the administration forecast of 3.1

   The unemployment insurance system has enough
reserves to last only five months in a severe recession and would
have to borrow billions of dollars from the federal government to
keep paying benefits, congressional watchdogs said Monday.
   Because states had to borrow $11.8 billion to keep paying
benefits during the 1981-82 recession, most have tightened
eligibility requirements so much that only one of every four
jobless workers in October of last year received unemployment
checks, the General Accounting Office said in a report.
   ``The average proportion of unemployed receiving benefits during
the 1980s has fallen by about 30 percent since the 1950s,'' the GAO
said. ``In 1952, nearly 55 percent of unemployed civilian workers
were receiving benefits; by 1986, only 32 percent received
benefits.''

million new jobs added since President Reagan took office in 1981,
the report by the Democratic staff of the Senate Budget Committee
concluded that both high-paying and low-paying jobs have grown at
the expense of a shrinking middle class.
   But the share of low-wage jobs that on a full-time, year-round
basis pay less than the government's poverty breakoff point for a
family of four _ $11,611 measured in 1987 dollars _ has increased
by more than twice the share of high-wage jobs defined as four
times the poverty level, the report said.

   Chileans gave overwhelmingly approval to a new
constitution eight years ago, and military leaders called it
grassroots acceptance of the way they had governed since seizing
power in 1973. The constitution prescribed a referendum for this
year on a military-picked candidate to serve as president until
1997. That candidate is Gen. Augusto Pinochet, ruler for the past
15 years. The referendum is set for this week. Chile is at a
crossroads.

   A geographical stringbean between the
Andes and the sea, Chile always seemed separate and distinct from
other countries in South America.
   It had the longest tradition of democracy. Its schools and
universities forged a highly literate society: more than 90 percent
of its people can read and write. It dug a wealth of copper from
its mountainsides, harvested rich crops from its soil and plucked
fish in abundance from its seas.
   In contrast to its neighbors who lurched from one military
dictator or civilian strongman to another, Chile lived in
relatively prosperous stability in the years after achieving
independence from Spain in 1818.
   But in 1970, Chilean stability began to falter following the
election to the presidency of Salvador Allende, a self-declared
Marxist whose change in direction from the past brought political
and economic disorder.
   On the morning of Sept. 11, 1973, Chile's long tradition of
elected, representative government came to an end.
   The military, declaring the nation on the verge of a communist
takeover, seized power in a bloody coup.
   Gen. Augusto Pinochet, the coup leader, became president in a
military dictatorship. He has remained in office for 15 years.
   On Wednesday, Oct. 5, the 7 million registered voters among
Chile's 12 million people will be asked to decide in a yes-no
referendum whether they want the 72-year-old Pinochet to stay on as
their leader for eight more years _ until 1997.
   ``Joy is coming,'' goes an election campaign jingle of
Pinochet's opponents, confidently predicting his demise in
Wednesday's referendum.
   ``The Marxists are coming,'' counters a pro-Pinochet television
advertisement, meaning a vote against Pinochet would set Chile back
to the Allende years of the early 1970s.
   Chile stands this week on the doorstep of a future blurred by
two radically distinct ideological visions. The deep split between
Pinochet's opponents and backers tends to color the country's
troubled past and its present as well.
   Pinochet is the sole candidate in the referendum, which has
spawned reflection and debate on the merits of his administration
and on the chain of events that led to his seizing power.
   Allende's leftist policies and the fierce opposition to them set
off widespread economic and social upheaval, including paralyzing
strikes and street violence, shortages of basic goods and an angry
polarization of society that has left deep scars.
   In the aftermath, a U.S. congressional investigation found that
the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency financed efforts to
destabilize Allende's government. It also found that the
International Telephone and Telegraph Corp., which had substantial
investments in Chile, financed efforts to prevent Allende from
taking office after he was elected. Allende nationalized ITT after
assuming the presidency and the corporation left Chile long before
Pinochet's coup in 1973.
   Historians today debate whether the CIA's involvement had a real
impact, and Pinochet denies any direct foreign involvement in the
coup or its planning.
   Upon taking power, Pinochet declared a mission to purge the
nation of what he saw as communism and to forge a society he
envisioned as based on the values of family, hard work and love of
country.
   Pinochet and his supporters say the coup saved Chile, even
though it snapped a decades-long chain of democratically elected
governments. Allende died in the coup, his supporters charging he
was killed by soldiers and the military claiming he committed
suicide with a weapon given him by Cuba's Fidel Castro.
   All Chileans agree that Pinochet's 15 years of military rule
have been marked by profound change. They argue heatedly, however,
whether it has been for better or for worse.
   Pinochet's supporters talk of a ``silent revolution'' in which
Chile has become a modern, efficient nation with a stable economic
base. They claim to see an emergence from Third World
underdevelopment.
   The country is in its fifth straight year of steady economic
growth, with the gross national product projected to rise 6 percent
in 1988. The official inflation rate has declined to about 10
percent a year, a fraction of the Latin American average. The
foreign debt of $20 million is being paid off on time, and is
actually shrinking.
   Export earnings have soared and are projected at $6.8 billion
this year, up 46 percent from 1984. Foreign investment is at
unprecedented levels, surpassing $300 million in the first six
months of 1988 alone. Once-bloated state industries have been
streamlined and, in dozens of cases, auctioned off whole or in part
to private business.
   In his campaign, Pinochet promises growth and stability.
   ``We can't turn our back on progress,'' he told the nation
recently, maintaining that his defeat in the referendum would bring
back leftist experiments and the chaos of the Allende years.
   Even his critics give his economic performance at least faint
praise.
   ``There has been a positive macro-economic policy in the last
four years,'' said Andres Zaldivar, vice-president of the centrist
Christian Democratic Party.
   But Zaldivar, who spoke in an interview, and other Pinochet foes
say most Chileans are still struggling to recover from a fierce
recession in 1982, which they blame on a radical free-market
experiment launched after the coup and only later modified. In
addition, the recent boom has benefited the rich much more than any
other social group.
   ``Pinochet has destroyed the middle class,'' Zaldivar contended.

<HEAD>SANTIAGO: Zaldivar contended.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   According to economist Alvaro Garcia, ``Those with higher
incomes have achieved a level (of income) almost 25 percent higher
than in 1982. Workers and medium-income groups have not yet
recovered the levels they had before the '82 recession.''
   In any event, the opposition contends, any economic advances are
more than overshadowed by a grim legacy of human rights abuse.
   More than 700 people were arrested and disappeared during
Pinochet's rule, most of them in a wave of official repression
following the coup that affected thousands of dissidents. The
number of atrocities has declined in recent years but illegal
arrest, beating and torture of leftists persists, according to
international and local human rights groups.
   ``Impunity still continues for those who violate human rights,''
said Gustavo Villalobos, a lawyer for the local Roman Catholic
Church's human rights agency.
   Shadowy bands of armed civilians threaten, shoot at and
sometimes kidnap and torture opposition activists, he said in an
interview.
   ``We are convinced of an association between these apparently
private terror groups and (official) security organs.''
   Pinochet insists that tough action was necessary to turn the
Marxist tide represented by Allende and remains needed to stem
subversion, including two active communist guerrilla organizations.
   But with his electoral campaign in full swing, and critics
calling for greater political freedom, Pinochet lifted states of
emergency that had persisted since he took power. He also ended a
ban on the return of more than 300 leftists in exile.
   He pledged that his new government would be fully democratic,
while retaining certain anti-communist safeguards.
   The constitution, crafted in 1980 by his administration and
overwhelmingly approved in a referendum, formally bans Marxism. The
same document outlines a phased return to democracy, requiring the
upcoming referendum and a re-establishment of Congress, which was
disbanded after the coup.
   If a majority votes yes in the referendum, Pinochet will begin a
new eight-year term in March. The military junta, which
theoretically served as the legislative branch of Pinochet's
government, will be disbanded. The new Congress will be seated in
1990, two-thirds elected and the remaining third appointed by
Pinochet.
   If the electorate rejects Pinochet in the referendum, Pinochet
will stay on as president but an open election must be held in a
year. He then must step down in 1990.
   No matter what the outcome of the referendum, congressional
elections will be held in 1990, but the legislature will have
limited authority. It will be virtually powerless to amend the 1980
constitution, which gives the military autonomy and a supervisory
role in national policy-making.
   Pinochet has said he hopes to see the Congress filled with ``a
new generation of leaders'' who put the nation's welfare ahead of
party interests. He portrays his chief opponents as people eager
for personal gain and power, and too busy feuding among themselves
to provide coherent leadership.
   For years the opposition had been chronically divided. This past
February, however, 16 parties ranging from the center-right to the
socialist left formed a united front, called the Command for the NO
Vote.
   With an unusual degree of cooperation, they have agreed on a
moderate political platform and have launched a grassroots
campaign. Party leaders who once battled each other now embrace at
crowded anti-Pinochet rallies.
   ``There has been a process of maturation in the opposition,''
said Genaro Arrigada, the coalition's general secretary. He said
political parties had realized their feuding only helped Pinochet
gain and keep power.
   Confident of getting a no-vote and defeating Pinochet in the
referendum, opposition leaders said they will seek talks with the
military to speed up the open elections and Pinochet's replacement
with a four-year transitional government.
   They claim the military will be willing to negotiate once their
commander is defeated.
   There is no indication yet, however, of a conciliatory spirit in
Pinochet's army, by far the most powerful branch of the armed
forces. Several top army officers are openly politicking for him,
and the vice-commander, Gen. Santiago Sinclair, has declared that
troops are ``in a state of readiness'' to defend their leader and
Constitution.

   Here are some facts and figures on Chile:
   
   THE LAND _ Chile is a long, narrow territory of 292,000 square
miles extending 2,670 miles along the southwestern coast of South
America. It ranges from the semi-tropical, desert north to the
rainy, windswept south. Wedged between the Andes mountains on the
east and Pacific Ocean on the west, its average width is only 95
miles. Its largest cities are Santiago, the capital, where nearly 5
million of the nation's 12 million people live; Valparaiso, its
largest port, 75 miles north west of Santiago, and Concepcion, an
industrial center 350 miles south. It is bordered by Peru on the
north and Bolivia and Argentina on the east.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE PEOPLE _ The population is predominantly a mixture of the
local Araucano Indians and descendants of the Spanish conquerors.
In the agricultural southern provinces a large German immigrant
community exists. The official language is Spanish, and literacy
exceeds 90 percent. While Chile has no official religion, more than
90 percent of Chileans call themselves Roman Catholics.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE ECONOMY _ Chile is the world's second biggest producer of
copper, after the United States. In recent years, the economy has
diversified and the country has become the Southern Hemisphere's
largest fruit exporter. Mining, fishing and agriculture, including
a booming timber industry, are the main economic activities. The
annual economic growth rate has averaged 5 percent since the
mid-1980s. Inflation stands at around 10 percent annually, one of
the lowest rates in Latin America. The currency is the peso, and
the present exchange rate is 246 pesos to the U.S. dollar.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   HISTORY _ Chile launched a struggle for independence from Spain
on Sept. 18, 1810, and finally attained it in 1818, becoming a
republic and establishing a reputation as one of Latin America's
most stable democracies. Presidents were freely elected, even in
1881 during a victorious four-year territorial war against
neighboring Bolivia and Peru. Major political disturbances were
historically rare, consisting of a brief civil war in 1891 and a
series of coups in 1925. In 1973, however, the military led by Gen.
Augusto Pinochet ousted the elected leftist government of President
Salvador Allende, an avowed Marxist who died in the takeover.
Pinochet has remained in power since and seeks ratification of a
new period of rule, until 1997, in an Oct. 5 referendum.

   His election in the ``year of three popes'' was
a startling surprise: He was non-Italian and came from a
Communist-ruled country. As John Paul II, he set a record for papal
world travel, reflecting his determination to reach out to all in
his flock. A longtime Vatican reporter looks back on 10 years of
high visibility and the inevitable controversies of an outspoken
activist reign.

<TEXT>
   Ten years ago, Karol Wojtyla of Krakow,
Poland, assumed the papacy, ushering in a decade of activism that
has seen Pope John Paul II travel the world, attempt to bring an
unruly flock into line and suffer the jolt of schism in the ranks.
   He has drawn the admiration of many as he assumes the role of a
world leader on matters of peace and social justice, speaking out
on causes ranging from the rights of Latin American peasants to the
plight of Palestinians. He has also upset many Roman Catholics in
the United States and elsewhere by his consistent doctrinal
conservatism.
   No pope has ever traveled so much and delivered so many
speeches, embarking on a path to prepare his church for the next
century, when the Vatican expects there will be 1 billion Roman
Catholics in the world.
   The 10 years have allowed the pope to place like-minded
conservatives in key dioceses and in the Curia, the church's
central administration, and to put his people into the College of
Cardinals, which serves as an advisory body and elects his
successor.
   From the Vatican, there have been crackdowns on dissent, the
censuring of several prominent theologians. Among North American
and Western European Catholics have been signs of alienation and a
feeling among some women that John Paul is unsympathetic to their
aspirations.
   The pope was particularly upset when traditionalist French
Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre ordained new bishops on June 30 without
his approval, provoking the first significant schism in the church
in more than a century. The pope was described as deeply pained and
bishops asked Catholics to rally around him.
   Wounded in an assassination attempt seven years ago and now 68,
John Paul has perhaps slowed down a step. He often appears tired
and drawn, although Vatican officials insist he's lost none of his
drive to set down his vision of the church.
   ``To say, as many have, that the present bishop of Rome does not
understand the church in the United States or in other parts of the
free world is not to condemn him,'' the Rev. Richard P. McBrien, a
University of Notre Dame theologian, said in a comment published in
a 1988 anthology ``The Church in Anguish.''
   ``He seems to assume that the only effective way to combat our
common enemies in today's world, atheism and materialism, is
through a completely united front. No dissent, no public
quarreling, no breaking from the ranks.''
   The year 1978, the ``year of the three popes,'' saw the death of
Paul VI after a 15-year-papacy and the death of his successor, John
Paul I, after only 33 days. Then, on Oct. 16, the cardinals elected
Archbishop Karol Wojtyla of Krakow as the first non-Italian pontiff
in 455 years and the first Pole ever.
   At 58, young for a pope and coming from a Communist country
where the church has traditionally been a second center of power,
Karol Wojtyla seemed the ideal man to head a growing church still
in turmoil from the changes initiated by the Second Vatican Council
and battling the challenge of Marxism.
   He has pursued his goals energetically and encouraged his
bishops to do likewise, whether through an unsuccessful attempt in
1981 to overturn Italy's law allowing abortions or the successful
effort to permit his meeting with political opposition leaders in
Paraguay last June.
   John Paul says the church has an obligation to speak out on
moral issues but that priests and nuns have no business in partisan
politics.
   Throughout the decade, John Paul has been critical of both
liberal capitalism and Marxist collectivism. Among his visions is a
Europe united by its common Christian roots.
   The Vatican's attempt to pursue its agenda in Eastern Europe
appeared to suffer a setback when John Paul was wounded by a
Turkish gunman May 13, 1981. There were allegations _ never proven
_ that the shooting was inspired by the Soviet Union to halt John
Paul's support for the independent Solidarity labor movement in
Poland.
   But with Mikhail Gorbachev leading the Soviet Union, relations
between the Soviets and the Vatican have improved to the point
where the Vatican sent a senior delegation to Moscow this year for
the celebration of a major religious event by the Orthodox Church.
There has even been talk of a papal visit to the Soviet Union,
although nothing immediate is expected.

   Another focus has been Latin America, where he has sought to
weed out Marxist liberation theology by church activists while
seeking to counter inroads made by Protestant sects.
   Nine of the pope's 39 trips have been to Latin America,
reflecting Vatican interest in a region expected to include half
the world's Catholics by the year 2000. The Vatican estimates that
Catholics now number 850 million worldwide.
   John Paul has repeatedly stressed the church's ``option for the
poor'' but has refused to tolerate the more openly political
liberation theologists such as Brazil's Leonardo Boff, who in 1985
was punished with a year of ``obedient silence'' for criticizing
what he called the church's ``feudal hierarchy.''
   Cardinal Paulo Evaristo Arns of San Paulo, Brazil, a leading
human rights advocate and a sort of patron of liberation
theologists in the world's largest Catholic country, has praised
the pope for encouraging church leaders to work for greater social
equality.
   ``In Brazil, where the abyss between the rich and poor is
immense, where traditionally the elites rule with scandalous
egotism, the words of the pope have encouraged bishops, priests and
laymen in a common struggle for a new society marked by signs of
faith, of hope and of fraternity,'' Arns said in an interview.
   The pope has frequently reached out to other Christian
denominations and religions, convening a multi-faith prayer session
in Assisi, Italy, in October 1986. But he has said that the
ordination of women in the Anglican Church poses an obstacle to
church unity and has angered Jews by receiving PLO leader Yasser
Arafat and meeting with Austrian President Kurt Waldheim, who has
been linked to Nazi war crimes.
   It is often said that Pope John XXIII breathed new life into the
church by calling the Second Vatican Council, 1962-65, that
produced major changes in the liturgy, the church's relations with
other religions and its view of its role in the world.
   If John's successor, Pope Paul VI, was seen as troubled by
doubts and inclined to compromise, John Paul II steers the church
with obvious self-assurance.
   A close aide to the pope told this story to describe how John
Paul runs his church:
   This summer, while on vacation in the Italian Alps, John Paul
indicated he wanted to climb a narrow, risky trail to reach a cross
planted atop a peak. He sounded out his aides, who all advised
against the climb, but decided to do it anyway.
   ``It's not that he doesn't listen to advice. But once he makes
up his mind, nothing can change it,'' said the aide, who asked that
his name not be used.
   Although Vatican officials dismiss the suggestion that the pope
has little interest in the superdeveloped Western societies, the
Vatican is clearly counting on the church's growth in the less
developed nations. Vatican figures show, for example, that most of
the increases among seminarians are in the Third World.
   Africa is one area the Vatican is counting on for such growth,
and the pope has made several trips to that continent.
   John Paul has twice visited the United States. The 1987
pilgrimage allowed for candid criticism from the ranks, but the
pope was unbudging and made it clear that it was a ``grave error''
to believe dissent from church teaching was compatible with being a
good Catholic.
   Troublesome issues among North American Catholics include
mandatory priestly celibacy and the ban on women becoming priests,
prohibitions on contraceptives, divorce and abortion.
   ``We're not going to have a sufficient number of qualified
priests if they have to be male celibates,'' said the Rev. Daniel
Donovan, a theology professor at St. Michael's College in Toronto.
   The pope recently affirmed that the church is determined to do
all it can to fight discrimination against women and has written a
document on the issue.
   But some American nuns have been among the pope's strongest
critics.
   There have also been differences over the role national bishops'
conferences should play as a body and investigations of U.S.
seminaries and religious orders.
   The pope's world vision, as laid out in a social encyclical in
February, drew some questioning from the Catholic right, usually
his strongest defenders.
   ``World peace is inconceivable unless the world's leaders come
to recognize that interdependence in itself demands the abandonment
of the politics of blocs, the sacrifice of all forms of economic,
military or political imperialism, and the transformation of mutual
distrust into collaboration,'' John Paul wrote.

   Here are significant quotations from Pope
John Paul II in his 10-year pontificate:
   ``Even if I cannot express myself well in your ... our Italian
language, if I make a mistake you will correct me,'' to the crowd
in St. Peter's Square in his first public appearance after election
as first non-Italian pontiff in 455 years, Oct. 16, 1978.
   ``(Man) cannot become the slave of things, the slave of economic
systems, the slave of production, the slave of his own products,''
his first encyclical, ``Redemptor Hominis,'' issued March 15, 1979.
   ``Never lose your trust, do not be defeated, do not be
discouraged; do not cut yourselves off from the roots from which we
had our origins,'' farewell Mass in Krakow on first trip to Poland,
June 10, 1979.
   ``I pray for that brother of ours who shot me, and whom I have
sincerely pardoned,'' from his hospital bed, May 17, 1981, four
days after being wounded by a Turkish gunman, Mehmet Ali Agca.
   ``I came here as a herald of peace to proclaim a gospel of peace
and a message of reconciliation,'' Cardiff, Wales, June 2, 1982,
ending historic trip to Britain during Falklands war.
   ``No human law can morally justify induced abortion ... nor can
the behavior of local authorities in trying to limit the
responsible freedom of parents to decide whether to procreate
children be allowed on the moral plane,'' address in San Juan,
Puerto Rico, Oct. 13, 1984.
   ``You yourselves are witnesses of the appreciation and gratitude
of the faithful when you don't get mixed up in interests of an
ideological or political nature, which are foreign to the Bible and
to the demands of your vocation,'' to priests in Medellin,
Colombia, July 5, 1986.
   ``It is sometimes claimed that dissent from the magisterium is
totally compatible with being a `good Catholic' and poses no
obstacle to the reception of the sacraments. This is a grave error
that challenges the teaching office of the bishops of the United
States and elsewhere,'' to the U.S. bishops, Los Angeles, Sept. 16,
1987.
   ``For world peace is inconceivable unless the world's leaders
come to recognize that interdependence in itself demands the
abandonment of the politics of blocs, the sacrifice of all forms of
economic, military or political imperialism and the transformation
of mutual distrust into collaboration,'' from the social encyclical
`Sollicitudo Rei Socialis,'' Feb. 19, 1988.
   ``As I stressed last year before representatives of Jewish
communities in the United States, the Jewish people has a right to
a country of its own, as any other nation has under international
law. The same, however, holds for the Palestinian people, many of
whom have become homeless and are refugees,'' to the Austrian
Jewish community, Vienna, June 24, 1988.
   ``With great distress the church has observed the illegitimate
ordination of bishops performed June 30 by Archbishop Marcel
Lefebvre. ... This act of disobedience _ which constitutes the
outright rejection of the Roman primate _constitutes a schismatic
act,'' letter to bishops, July 2, 1988.

   Pope John Paul II is so well-traveled that
the focus has shifted to where he hasn't visited instead of where
he has already stopped.
   Since setting out for the Dominican Republic and Mexico three
months after assuming the papacy 10 years ago, John Paul has made
39 foreign pilgrimages, stopping in 72 countries.
   Easily the most traveled pope in history, he has flown some
370,000 miles, including his trip to southern Africa in
mid-September. That's like traveling from the Earth to the moon and
more than halfway back.
   But if he has visited every continent but Antarctica, he has yet
to visit the Soviet Union, China, Cuba, South Africa and the Holy
Land.
   Early in his pontificate, John Paul described himself as a
pilgrim messenger who would travel the world to see his flock. He
has kept his word, far surpassing Pope Paul VI, the first jet age
pontiff who became known as the ``apostle on the move.''
   Paul made nine overseas trips from 1964 to 1970, when, weary and
72, he halted all foreign travel.
   John Paul has made nine trips to Latin America alone, reflecting
the importance the Vatican attaches to a region expected to contain
half the world's Roman Catholics by the turn of the century.
   He has also paid four visits to Africa, where the church has
been making inroads, as well as three pilgrimages to his native
Poland and two to the United States.
   The trips are central to John Paul's papacy. He has bristled at
suggestions he should spend more time at the Vatican (Vatican
statistics say he is away less than 8 percent of his pontificate)
or that the trips cost too much.
   He chose a bishops conference in Mexico, on his first trip, to
reject Marxist-inspired liberation theology. He influenced the mood
of his fellow Poles during his 1979 pilgrimage that helped lead to
the birth of the Solidarity free trade union, and he expounded
church teaching to Americans in 1987, saying that dissent was
incompatible with being a good Catholic.
   Still to come are a trip later this year to Strasbourg, France,
to address the European Parliament and a visit to Scandinavia next
year.
   John Paul's hopes of visiting the Soviet Union have not yet been
realized. He has disclosed that he's been prevented from visiting
Lithuania, the Roman Catholic stronghold in the Soviet Union, and
insists that he must be allowed to visit with his flock on any
pilgrimage.
   The Holy Land is an especially delicate case. Paul VI made a
whirlwind visit to Israel and Jordan in 1964, but that was three
years before Israel took over predominantly Arab East Jerusalem and
the West Bank in the 1967 war.
   The Vatican has not established diplomatic relations with Israel
and John Paul has stressed that the Palestinians, like the Jews,
have a right to a homeland.
   The Vatican says it is premature for the pope to visit apartheid
South Africa and Communist Cuba. There has been no invitation from
China, which broke relations with the Vatican in 1957 and
established its own breakaway Catholic church.

   He was notably a busy man on the high-minded
Swarthmore campus, which would have surprised no one who'd seen
Michael Dukakis in action at Brookline High. He was big in sports,
big in student government and long on A's. In high school and
college, he was always reckoned among the brainiest. But, active as
he was, he was never ``a rah-rah guy,'' as a college friend
recalls. ``He'd rather do something about an issue.''

<DATELINE>SWARTHMORE, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Looking back on those halcyon (also the
name of the yearbook) days, college chums are undecided whether
Michael's barber shop on the third floor of Wharton Hall or courses
nicknamed ``Ditch Digging and Sewage Disposal 1 & 2'' gave distant
early warning of a future Democratic presidential candidate.
   Of course it was the ``D'' in general physics that discouraged
freshman Michael Dukakis from becoming a physician, like his Greek
immigrant father, and inspired Swarthmore's now best-selling
T-shirt: ``Anywhere else, it would have been an A.''
   Practical politics, solving problems in state and local
government, as taught in the early '50s by Paul Ylvisaker,
intrigued the scholarship student who had graduated second in a
class of 439 at intellectually top-drawer Brookline High School in
the suburbs of Boston.
   In a matter of weeks, Michael, who in those days was never
called ``Duke'' and rarely ``Mike,'' was ringing doorbells in West
Philadelphia and handing out campaign literature for Joe Clark, the
reform candidate who became the first Democrat in 70 years to
capture Philadelphia's city hall.
   ``Swarthmore has always been pretty liberal, an egghead campus
where kids think they can change the world,'' says Leighton
Whitaker, who was a year ahead of Dukakis and now is director of
psychological services at the college. ``But Michael wasn't a
rah-rah guy. He'd sooner do something about an issue than attend
rallies and demonstrations.''
   ``Theory wasn't his bag,'' adds professor emeritus J. Roland
Pennock, summoning up a memory of a dark-eyed lad seated
Buddha-style on his living room floor for those afternoon seminars
on political theory. ``His arguments were sound, well-researched,
but he was less aggressive and less talkative without a real
problem to sink his teeth into.''
   Actually it was Jonathan Fine, his Brookline buddy and now head
of Physicians for Human Rights, who proposed boycotting the three
barber shops down in ``the vill,'' the village, when they refused
to cut the hair of three Nigerian students. Dukakis made it work by
wielding the comb and clippers in the dorm and sometimes out on the
lawn.
   Some recall his charging 50 cents, others say 65 cents, for a
``flattop,'' the only styling offered.
   ``There may have been a two-tier price structure, depending on
what the trade would bear,'' mused associate provost emeritus
Gilmore Stott, who as admissions officer back then coaxed Dukakis
into entering Swarthmore over a dinner cooked by his wife, Mary.
``He was being penny-wise as well as striking a blow for racial
equality. Barbering gave him some pocket money.''
   Classmate Ted Perkins, a Philadelphia patent attorney, surmises
the barber of Wharton may have been a youthful edition of the
tightwad governor who picks his suits off the rack, still shops for
specials at the supermarket, grew his own lettuce on the front lawn
when the price hit 89 cents a head, pushes a 25-year-old snow
blower and often rides ``the T,'' the suburban trolley, from
Brookline to the Massachusetts State House.
   ``But with a captive audience in the chair, Michael never could
resist politics,'' Perkins recalls. ``Frank Sieverts, his roommate,
told us the hotter the argument got, the faster the hair flew.''
   A couple of Christmas cards ago, Dean Stott enclosed a $1
campaign contribution, suggesting Dukakis run for president. ``I
like being governor,'' the reply came back but, Stott says, ``he
kept the dollar.''
   Swarthmore is a small college, then as now with only about half
of Brookline High's 2,000 enrollment, but lush as a landscape from
the brush of colonial painter Benjamin West, whose house is at the
edge of the 380-acre campus that flourishes as an arboretum of rare
trees. Daffodils, azaleas, dogtooth violets, lilacs and
rhododendrons in seasonal succession perfume the paths of Crum
Woods, where in the delicate euphemism of the Halcyon editors
``couples took field trips in Baudelaire.''
   Dukakis was attracted by the beauty of the campus when, as a
high school senior, he visited Philadelphia for a week in a class
exchange program. That Swarthmore was coed and small enough for
almost half the student body to take part in varsity sports also
proved persuasive.
   Brookline High had conditioned him for Swarthmore's heady
intellectual climate.
   ``He was brilliant, got all A's _ isn't that disgusting?''
marvels Sandra Cohen, now Bakalar, his high school sweetheart. She
was secretary of the student council when Dukakis solved the
problem of broken milk bottles in the lunch room by having the
distributor deliver paper cartons. ``But Michael lost a big
election in senior year: Bob Wool beat him out for class
president.''

   Orders for ``big ticket'' durable goods jumped
6 percent in August, the government reported, suggesting to
analysts that recent signs of sluggishness in the economy are
probably temporary.
   The Commerce Department said Friday that orders jumped to a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of $123.1 billion last month
following a huge 7.4 percent decline in July and an 8.7 percent
increase in June.
   The volatility in the month-to-month total reflects wide swings
in demand for transportation and military goods, but economists
said the underlying trend portrays a vigorous U.S. manufacturing
sector.

<TEXT>
   When Sigourney Weaver used a futuristic
fork-lift to dispatch an alien beast during a climactic fight in
the movie ``Aliens,'' it was a real-life triumph for Caterpillar
Inc.
   The image of the lifter _ which bore the Caterpillar logo _
being pushed to its limit in triumph over an evil force was
powerful enough. But the positive exposure to Caterpillar from the
box-office success of the film surprised officials of the
Peoria-based company.
   ``We had a number of people calling and writing in wanting to
buy the machine,'' said Ron Pilon, manager of Caterpillar's sales
and promotion division. ``We had to explain to people that the
machine in the movie doesn't exist.''
   The cinematic victory _ and accompanying wide public promotion
of its machines as tough and versatile _ resulted from the work of
Caterpillar's Hollywood agent.
   The company for two years has employed UPP Entertainment
Marketing of North Hollywood, Calif. to help it find scripts that
would give its equipment a high, positive profile in motion
pictures and television, and to protect itself from negative
exposure.
   ``We like to be selective so our machines don't come off as the
heavy in a movie,'' Pilon said. ``We don't want another movie like
`Killdozer.'''
   In that 1974 made-for-television movie, a thinly-disguised
Caterpillar tractor became possessed by aliens and proceeded to
wreak havoc on the residents of a small island.
   ``It was going around wiping out people,'' Pilon said. ``Of
course, we got up in arms about it because they made the machine
look like a killer. We want people to see our machines for their
contributions to society: building roads and homes and removing
piles of snow in the winter.''
   The classic movie ``Grapes of Wrath'' also made Caterpillar
officials cringe as company equipment was used to destroy a home
and came to symbolize the oppressive force that forced Dust Bowl
victims off their land.
   Caterpillar declined an opportunity for its machines to appear
in the recent Steven Spielberg movie, ``Batteries Not Included.''
   ``In that movie, the construction company was the bad guy and
Caterpillar equipment would have been used to tear down a hotel and
cafe where a bunch of old folks lived,'' said Cliff McMullen,
president of UPP Entertainment Marketing. ``They had nowhere else
to go.''
   That's typical of what movie-makers have in mind for heavy
equipment, McMullen said. And Caterpillar is the equipment of
preference, he said.
   ``That's the problem,'' McMullen said. ``We probably keep them
out of more films than we get them into. Caterpillar is a sensitive
company and doesn't want to offend the sensibilities of its target
market.''
   Although Caterpillar can't control the use of its equipment,
McMullen often dissuades negative portrayals, sometimes with
threats of legal action.
   But Caterpillar always is ready for heroic roles, such as
fighting a creature in ``Aliens,'' stopping an oil well fire on
``Dallas'' and constructing a pipeline on ``Dynasty.''
   Later this year, three large tractors will appear in the comedy
``Fugitives'' with Nick Nolte and Martin Short. In the December
television special ``A Brady Christmas,'' a Caterpillar
wheel-loader saves the day, and the Brady Bunch, from disaster at a
construction site.
   ``We have never paid anyone to use Caterpillar equipment in a
movie,'' said Don Axt of Caterpillar's advertising department.
``People think this involves big money but it really only involves
a convenience.
   ``We make it convenient or very easy for filmmakers to use
Caterpillar equipment and we usually share the costs.''

in a future recession because of inadequate reserves, according to
a congressional report released today.
   The General Accounting Office study found the Unemployment
Insurance system's ability to cushion economic hard times for many
Americans has declined as states have tried to manage their
financially troubled programs.
   Created to help working people make it through economic hard
times, the state trusts are tightening eligibility requirements
solely to keep their books in the black, leaving more Americans to
face a bleak future if a recession strikes, the GAO said.
   Only one in four unemployed people received unemployment
benefits in October 1987, GAO said.
   The GAO, an investigative arm of Congress, said that represents
a decline in the proportion of unemployed receiving the benefits.
   ``The average proportion of the unemployed receiving benefits
during the 1980s has fallen by about 30 percent since the 1950s,''
according to GAO. ``In 1952, nearly 55 percent of unemployed
civilian workers were receiving benefits; by 1986, only 32 percent
received benefits.''
   Although several changes in the makeup of the workforce explain
part of the decline, the report said 44 states took action to
reduce eligibility.
   The GAO also said the drop in the number receiving benefits
``suggests a reduction in the system's effectiveness in stabilizing
the economy _ and in mitigating the effects of income loss suffered
by the unemployed.''
   The report warns Congress to ease the current burden and help
restore reserves or the country may see ``greater tax increases and
larger benefit reductions in the regions that have experienced the
least favorable economic conditions.''
   The Unemployment Insurance system was created in the 1930s as
one of the New Deal programs passed in response to the Great
Depression. It is run jointly by the federal government and the
states, with each state managing separate trusts within the federal
treasury and setting its own eligibility requirements and benefit
levels.
   The system was designed to be self-sufficient, subsisting on
federal taxes to finance administration and state taxes to fund
benefits.
   But, said the GAO report, ``the system's long-standing
presumption of self-financing has been eroding since the 1970s,
when the government began making major loans to states otherwise
unable to meet benefit commitments.''
   ``Although only three state funds had ever received loans before
1972, during 1982-83 states needed loans of over $11.8 billion to
pay benefits,'' the GAO said.
   In 1986, state trusts owed the U.S. Treasury a total of $4.8
billion, and federal laws have given them greater incentive to
repay the loans _ and to trim their spending on benefits.
   The report stressed that the overall system is not insolvent.
The system had $19.4 billion in reserve in 1987, GAO said, enough
to last about five months in a severe recession.
   But recent recessions have lasted 12 months, the report noted,
and the Labor Department recommends each state have enough on hand
to pay benefits for 18 months.
   The GAO said those who qualify for benefits under state
regulations will get them _ the federal government should cover any
shortfall. Yet increased borrowing has been accompanied by an
ominous decline in the percentage of people eligible for
unemployment insurance.
   In 1969, 39 states had adequate reserves, the report said. But
no more than two states have had adequate funds on hand in any year
since 1976, the report said.
   At the same time, attempts to trim people from benefit rolls
apparently have increased.

   The Associated Press reported Thursday that
the 2.5-liter Chrysler TC by Maserati made the Environmental
Protection Agency's list of gas-guzzling cars which are subject to
a special gas-guzzler tax.
   Chrysler spokesman Tom Jakobowski said Friday that Chrysler is
not panning to offer the TC by Maserati with the 2.5-liter engine
and, instead, will only offer that model with a 2.2-liter engine,
which is not subject to the special tax.

<HEAD>Tate And Lyle To Buy U.S. Sugar Operations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tate & Lyle PLC said Monday it has agreed to
acquire the sugar refining operations of Amstar Corp. for about
$305 million, strengthening the British company's position in the
U.S. sweetener market.
   At the same time, Tate & Lyle said it will seek a buyer for its
much-smaller sugar refining operations in Yonkers, N.Y., held by
the British company's Refined Sugars Inc. subsidiary. Tate and Lyle
said it expects proceeds from this sale to exceed $100 million.
   The Amstar sugar business, which markets under the Domino brand
name, will be jointly owned by Tate & Lyle and Redpath Industries
Ltd. through Refined Sugars Inc.
   Redpath is a publicly quoted Canadian concern which is 50.15
percent owned by Tate & Lyle. The two companies each own half of
Refined Sugars.
   ``This ... gives the Tate & Lyle group a significant position in
the U.S. cane sugar refining industry,'' said Tate & Lyle Chairman
Neil Shaw.
   Amstar, which has its headquarters in Stamford, Conn., has sugar
refineries in Brooklyn, N.Y., Baltimore and New Orleans.
   Tate & Lyle acquired U.S.-based Staley Continental, a leading
producer of corn sweeteners, in June. In 1985, it formed Western
Sugar Co. in the United States.

   A partial settlement will be announced this week
in a group of lawsuits against investors in Ivan F. Boesky & Co.,
the investment vehicle of the imprisoned stock speculator,
according to a report published today.
   The accord will result in a payment of $30 million to $50
million to shareholders in companies who claim they were defrauded
by Boesky, the New York Times said in a report attributed to people
involved in the suits.
   The accord is an agreement between 42 limited partners in
Boesky's defunct firm; a British enterprise once controlled by
Boesky; and shareholders of companies who claim they were
defrauded, the newspaper said.
   The pact does not include the two central defendants, Boesky
himself and his main underwriter, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., the
Times said.
   ``The settlement is really a grand alliance that will make it
much easier for us to pursue Ivan Boesky and Drexel Burnham,'' a
lawyer involved in negotiations between shareholders and the Boesky
partners told the Times.
   Two years ago Boesky paid a $100 million fine to settle
government charges that he illegally traded on confidential
information. He is serving a three-year federal prison term after
admitting that he conspired to file a false statement with the
Securities and Exchange Commission.

   The stock market moved slightly lower today in
lethargic dealings, weakened somewhat by lower bond prices.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials eased 1.60 to 2,089.08
in the first hour and a half of trading.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 7 to 5 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
633 down, 463 up and 536 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 33.58 million
shares as of 11 a.m. on Wall Street.
   Analysts noted that the market continues to be stalled in a
narrow trading range and that activity is dominated by ``deal''
stocks.
   ``People are focusing on (companies') earnings or lack of
earnings, on takeover stocks and takeover rumors,'' said Philip
Puccio, a senior vice president at Dillon, Read & Co.
   ``It is starting to become an individual stock-picking market,''
he said. Institutional investors are content to sit on the
sidelines, which has kept trading volume depressed.
   In addition, analysts said there is some concern among investors
that economic statistics for September, although not due to be
released for several weeks, will show the economy has been
reheating. An expanding economy puts upward pressure on interest
rates.
   Meanwhile, the market ``is stalled on the upside because of
concern about interest rates and buffered on the downside because
of the enormous buying power that's around,'' said Larry Wachtel, a
first vice president at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   Among actively traded issues, TW Services rose 1~ to 25}; the
investment firm Coniston Partners disclosed it holds a 19 percent

<HEAD>EEC Says U.S. Trade Law Could Lead To More Protectionism</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The European Economic Community warned
the United States Monday that a new U.S. trade law could lead to
more protectionism.
   The law ``could lead to greater recourse to unilateral measures
by the United States which would be inconsistent with the Punta del
Este declaration and with our common commitment to the multilateral
trading system,'' the 12 EEC foreign ministers said in a statement.
   The 1986 declaration in Punta del Este, Uruguay, launched a new
round of world trade talks designed to combat protectionism.
   The EEC ministers said they will monitor implementation of the
U.S. law ``very closely'' and will take ``prompt action'' if EEC
interests are threatened.
   EEC External Relations Commissioner Willy de Clercq told the
ministers that the new U.S. trade law, by increasing trade powers
for the U.S. Congress, would ``diminish the scope for discretion by
the administration.''
   He said it would ``open the door'' to lobbyists trying to
influence the U.S. administration to renege on its obligations
under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), the set of
regulations governing world trade.
   The United States and the EEC are locked in several trade
disputes at the moment.
   These include EEC objections to the use of hormones in American
beef and U.S. objections to government subsidies for Airbus, the
European aircraft consortium.
   The ministers also repeated their objections to another U.S.
trade initiative, a bill offering protection to manufacturers of
textiles, clothing and footwear.
   ``Such a development would seriously affect trade in this sector
and jeopardize the Uruguay round negotiations,'' the EEC ministers
said in their statement.
   The bill would limit increases in textile and apparel imports to
1 percent a year over their 1987 levels and freeze non-rubber shoe
imports at their 1987 level.
   Both the U.S. House and the Senate have passed the bill, but by
majorities insufficient to override a promised veto by President
Reagan. He has 10 days to sign it into law or, failing that, veto
it.

<HEAD>Soybean Futures Open Sharply Lower; Grains Also Fall</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soybean futures prices opened sharply lower today
on the Chicago Board of Trade, pressured by a number of bearish
factors. Grain futures also opened lower.
   Soybeans for November delivery plunged more than 15 cents a
bushel in early trading. Analysts said prices were driven lower by
follow-through selling from Friday, weekend rains in major South
American soybean regions and harvest pressure in the United States.
   ``The opening was much weaker than anybody expected,'' said
Victor Lespinasse, a trader with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   Midwestern corn and soybean growers had ``excellent harvesting
weather over the weekend and real good conditions are expected for
the next three days,'' Lespinasse said.
   Soybean crops in Brazil and Argentina were much improved from a
few weeks ago, although rain was still needed in northern Brazil,
he said.
   Wheat futures retreated on a lack of significant new export
business, analysts said.
   In early trading, wheat was 2{ cents to 4\ cents lower with the
contract for delivery in December at $4.22{ a bushel; corn was {
cent to 2} cents lower with December at $2.83{ a bushel; oats were
2} cents to 5 cents lower with December at $2.50{ a bushel;
soybeans were 10 cents to 16} cents lower with November at $8.17 a
bushel.
   Livestock futures were higher in early trading on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange but frozen pork belly futures were mixed.
   Live cattle were .28 cent to .53 cent higher with October at
70.05 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .30 cent to .55 cent higher
with September at 79.75 cents a pound; hogs were .28 cent to .55
cent higher with October at 39.55 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .33 cent lower to .88 cent higher with February at
51.70 cents a pound.
   Livestock futures closed mostly higher on Friday while pork
bellies declined.

<TEXT>
   The number of working oil and natural gas rigs
dipped this week by four to total 917 as the resumption of rigs
shut down by Hurricane Gilbert was offset by sharp declines
elsewhere, Baker Hughes Inc. reports.
   The small, overall decline compares to last week's drop of 17 to
total 921. The total reported Monday is the lowest since the count
reached 894 on Aug. 1, and appears to reflect continuing softness
in the crude market, said Baker Hughes economist Ike Kerridge said
Monday.
   The number of working rigs a year ago was 1,094.
   Baker Hughes' rig count, the widely watched industry index of
drilling activity, reflects the number of rigs actively exploring
for oil as of last Friday, not the number of rigs producing oil.
   Houston-based Hughes Tool Co., an oil toolmaker company that
merged with Baker International Corp. of Orange, Calif., has kept
track of the number of working rigs since 1940.
   The rig count reached a peak of 4,500 active rigs in December
1981, which was the height of the oil boom. But oil prices plunged
to less than $10 per 42-gallon barrel in the summer of 1986 and the
rig count went with it, dropping to 663 _ the lowest since Hughes
began compiling figures.
   The lowest level this year was the reported 880 rigs on May 2.
   Among major oil producing states, Oklahoma had 13 fewer working
rigs, followed by Wyoming, nine; Colorado, five; California, four;
North Dakota, three; and Ohio, one.
   Louisiana was the biggest gainer for the week with an increase
in eight working rigs, followed by New Mexico, seven; Texas and
Kansas, with five each; and Michigan, one. Pennsylvania was
unchanged for the week.

<TEXT>
   Ministers from five OPEC nations adjourned
an emergency price review session Monday without calling for a
special meeting of the full cartel but urged all oil-producing
nations to help stem the decline of world oil prices.
   The price monitoring panel, which tracks world oil trends and
OPEC member compliance with the organization's output policies,
called for a joint meeting of the price committee and another OPEC
group, the Long-Term Strategy Committee.
   The joint meeting, which could be held in October, would review
the objectives and strategies of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries, the ministers said in a communique following
the meeting.
   OPEC Secretary General Subroto, speaking to reporters, said that
the ministers would decide following the joint session whether to
call for a full gathering of the cartel before November.
   The ministers began meeting Sunday to review ways to harness a
surge in production being blamed for forcing down international
crude prices, an OPEC source said.
   The meeting of the Price Evolution Committee of the Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries began just after 11 a.m. at the
Indonesian embassy in the Madrid suburbs.
   The committee comprised of delegates from Nigeria, Algeria,
Indonesia, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela was not expected to take any
decisive action, the source said.
   The meeting was called after the recent slump in crude oil
prices due largely to burgeoning oil production by OPEC members,
analysts say.
   The Paris-based International Energy Agency reported OPEC was
producing 19 million barrels a day in August, far more than the
15.06 million barrel ceiling set by the cartel last June.
   In recent weeks world oil prices have fallen to their lowest
level since the summer of 1986 when they dropped below $10 a barrel.
   World oil prices firmed slightly in the days leading up to the
meeting as hopes escalated that the gathering might lead to a full
meeting of the oil cartel and a restoration of quota discipline
within the group.
   Although the committee, which monitors crude prices and member
compliance with OPEC policies, has no enforcement powers, it can
recommend an emergency meeting of all 13 OPEC member nations prior
to the scheduled fall session set for Nov. 21 in Vienna.
   Meanwhile, Iraq's Oil Minister Issam Abdul-Rahim al-Chalabi was
quoted as saying that falling oil prices would not deter Iraq from
boosting its production.
   In an interview published Monday in Nicosia, Cyprus, the Iraqi
minister reiterated earlier statements that Iraq would not adhere
to its OPEC quota of 1.5 million barrels a day and instead was in
the process of increasing oil output to 4.5 million barrels a day
by 1991.
   The minister said Iraq needed to boost its oil revenue to
rebuild its economy shattered during an eight-year Persian Gulf war
with Iran.
   Other OPEC countries, including Saudi Arabia and the United Arab
Emirates, also are reported to be exceeding their quotas and
competing for market share, leaving some analysts skeptical about
the cartel's ability to reinstitute discipline among the
organization's members.
   On Sunday, the price committee held a one-hour formal meeting at
the same embassy in the Madrid suburbs and discussed a report on
the current state of world oil prices and production, a senior
delegate said.
   The OPEC source said the meeting was likely to break for lunch
Monday at 1 p.m. and then resume talks in the afternoon.
   The source also said Indonesian OPEC Secretary General Subroto,
who is also attending, may make a statement to reporters later
Monday.
   He described the report as ``not very good.''
   On Friday, North Sea Brent crude for October delivery dropped to
$13.10 per barrel on rumors later proven false that Saudi Arabian
Oil Minister Hishan Nazer would not appear at the price committee
meeting.
   By 12 p.m. Monday, North Sea Brent crude for October delivery
had risen to $13.25 per barrel.
   Algeria, whose minister hosted a dinner here Saturday for his
committee colleagues, has complained to Saudi Arabia and other Gulf
producers that failure to respect OPEC production quotas is causing
serious hardships for other OPEC members whose economies are
dependent on oil revenues.
   Besides Saudi oil minister Nazer, the others at the meeting
include OPEC chairman Rilwanu Lukman, who is also Nigeria's oil
minister, Algeria's Belkacem Nabi, Indonesia's Ginandjar
Kartasasmita and Venezuela's new oil minister Julio Cesar Gil.

   Share prices finished almost unchanged Monday on
the London Stock Exchange, as a nervous market awaited Tuesday's
key British trade report for August.
   Some participants worried that another bad trade performance
could leave the British government with no alternative but to push
up interest rates.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index ended 0.3
point, or 0.02 percent, higher at 1,792.7, below its best level for
the day of 1,795.3 but stronger than its low of 1,789.4.
   Volume was a light 299.6 million shares, down sharply from the
396.5 million shares that changed hands Friday.
   The market remained lethargic as players awaited the British
trade numbers. The report was considered especially important after
last month's trade figures unhinged British markets with news of a
deficit more than double what private economists had expected.
   For August, market expectations call for a narrowing of
Britain's current- account deficit to between 1.2 billion pounds
and 1.7 billion pounds, or about $2 billion to $2.8 billion, from
July's 2.15 billion pounds, or $3.6 billion.
   Many market watchers said a poor trade number already has been
discounted by the market, while a better-than-expected figure might
send equities prices skyward.

<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The International Monetary Fund said Monday poor
countries have been hurt by the recent rise in world interest rates
and urged stronger steps to ease their staggering foreign debt
burdens.
   The policy-making arm of the IMF also called on indebted
countries to pursue policies that will spur growth and help
``restore domestic and foreign confidence.''
   The panel, made up of the finance leaders of 22 countries, said
banks should be encouraged to offer adequate refinancing to the
debtor countries and not just stretch out their payments over
longer periods.
   ``Many countries continue to face severe financing and
adjustment difficulties, which have become more severe due to the
recent increase in interest rates,'' said a statement from the
group attending the annual meeting of the IMF and its sister
agency, the World Bank. The financial organizations count 151
nations as members.
   ``More forceful actions are needed in the context of the current
cooperative, case-by-case approach to resolve these difficulties,''
the statement said.
   The ministers also said governments should not bail out
commercial banks which have made risky loans to poorer countries.
   ``There should be no official guarantees to private lenders,''
said Dutch Finance Minister H. Onno Ruding, the panel chairman.
   Finance ministers from throughout the world began a round of
talks last week in conjunction with the IMF-World Bank meeting,
which officially opens on Tuesday.
   Some 12,000 financial officials, bankers and journalists were
expected to attend the sessions.
   The officials' talks have centered mostly on prospects for the
world economy and the Third World debt.
   In its statement, the policy-making panel said, ``Growth in the
industrial countries has heen stronger than expected, world trade
has been buoyant, and inflation has been kept moderate.''
   The group offered no new proposals for the debt problem and said
it supported the current debt strategy.
   It took note of an offer from the Japanese Export-Import Bank to
make loans on easy terms to large debtor countries following
IMF-backed economic policies.
   ``Japan,'' it said, ``intends to promote growth in developing
countries and to contribute to the solution of the debt problem.''
   Japan's central bank governor, Satoshi Sumita, was expected
Tuesday to provide details of another debt plan, again to help the
larger debtors, known as the ``middle-income'' countries.
   This proposal, first discussed in June at the Toronto economic
summit of key industrialized nations, calls for the debtors to
deposit some of their international reserves with the IMF.
   The finance leaders of the United States and six other major
industrial nations over the weekend gave their final approval to a
plan to help the very poor countries, mostly in sub-Saharan Africa.
   But the big debtors, like Mexico and Brazil, also would like
some special assistance in reducing the debt burdens that have
slowed their economic development. The two countries, the
developing world's largest debtors, have debts totaling more than
$220 billion.
   In recent years, the industrial nations have followed what they
call a case-by-case approach to the debt, an approach that calls
for dealing individually with the debtors.
   The IMF has been instrumental in fashioning financial rescue
packages for heavily indebted countries. The World Bank provides
assistance to these countries for economic development.

   The stock market gave ground in a slow session
today, weighed down by lower bond prices.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials slipped 5.51 to 2,085.17
by 3 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 8 to 5 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
520 up, 839 down and 517 unchanged.
   Analysts noted that the market continues to be stalled in a
narrow trading range and that activity is dominated by ``deal''
stocks.
   In addition, analysts said there is some concern among investors
that economic statistics for September, although not due to be
released for several weeks, will show that the economy has been
reheating. An expanding economy puts upward pressure on interest
rates.
   Meanwhile, the market ``is stalled on the upside because of
concern about interest rates and buffered on the downside because
of the enormous buying power that's around,'' said Larry Wachtel, a
first vice president at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   Among actively traded issues, TW Services rose 1\ to 24}. The
investment firm of Coniston Partners disclosed that it holds a 19
percent stake in the food services concern.
   Best Products, which said its board is considering the sale of
the company, jumped 3} to 18}.
   Kroger rose } to 56{. The company rejected bids from the Haft

   Service Merchandise fell 1| to 12\ among the volume leaders in
the over-the-counter market. An investor group which had previously
expressed an interest in the company decided not to make a bid at
this time, Service Merchandise said.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dropped .40 to 151.98. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was down .20 at 298.91.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 95.77 million shares with an
hour to go.

<HEAD>OPEC Committee Calls for Prompt Action to Lift Sagging Oil Prices</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Subroto's name as one word is cq</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   OPEC's price monitoring committee ended a
two-day emergency session Monday by calling for prompt action to
reverse the sharp decline in world oil prices but stopped short of
calling for a special meeting of the full 13-member cartel.
   In a communique released at the conclusion of the meeting, the
oil ministers also said it was essential that a joint meeting of
the price committee and the Long-Term Strategy Committee be held to
review existing OPEC strategies and objectives.
   ``No lasting stability in the world oil market can be achieved
without concrete cooperation by the non-OPEC oil producing
countries and their contribution in regulating world supplies of
oil in line with demand,'' the price committee said.
   OPEC Secretary General Subroto of Indonesia, speaking to
reporters at a news conference following the meeting, underscored
the committee's statement saying the cause of the recent fall in
oil prices was ``mainly due to a significant overproduction of some
OPEC countries as well as non-OPEC oil producers.''
   Subroto said the ministers would decide after the joint meeting
whether a special session of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries should be called before its regularly scheduled
meeting Nov. 21 in Vienna.
   Oil futures prices on the New York Mercantile Exchange, which
had risen earlier in the day, began falling immediately after
Subroto's statements then recovered slightly, analysts said. One
broker said Subroto's comments were interpreted as indicating OPEC
was unwilling to take immediate action to restrain oil output and
boost sagging oil prices.
   The meeting of the price committee was called in response to the
recent slump in world oil prices, which earlier this month hit
their lowest level since the summer of 1986 when they fell below
$10 a barrel.
   According to many analysts, sagging prices represent the failure
of nearly all OPEC members to respect production quotas.
   The secretary general did not give specific dates for the joint
meeting except to say it would probably be held in October.
   Subroto said Iran and Iraq are to speak directly with each other
at the Long-Term Strategy Committee for the first time in years
within OPEC. He downplayed the significance of such a meeting,
however, saying it was normal that their respective oil ministers
should speak since their foreign ministers began meeting last month
in peace talks.
   The Long-Term Strategy Committee is comprised of OPEC's founding
members, including: Iran, Iraq, Saudia Arabia, Algeria, Venezuela
and Kuwait. Subroto said Iran and Iraq have both confirmed their
attendance at the joint session. Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and
Algeria also are members of the price committee, along with Nigeria
and Indonesia.
   Since the last price committee meeting Aug. 3 in Lausanne,
Switzerland, a cease-fire between the two countries in their
eight-year Gulf War has begun to hold.
   The Price Evolution Committee, as the price committee is
officially named, is an influential panel that studies price
developments and compliance with OPEC policies, namely production
quotas, by OPEC members, although it has no enforcement powers.
   The committee may, however, call for special meetings of all 13
OPEC members.
   The committee said it also examined during the emergency session
in the Spanish capital a report prepared by the Vienna-based OPEC
Secretariat on current market conditions as well as a report
presented by Subroto on the outcome of his recent visits to various
OPEC and non-OPEC oil producing countries.
   The Paris-based International Energy Energy Agency reported OPEC
production at 19 million barrels a day in August and OPEC President
Rilwanu Lukman has put OPEC production at closer to 20 million
barrels per day.
   Last June, OPEC set a 15.06 million barrel a day ceiling to
apply to all OPEC nations except Iraq, which has refused to go
along with OPEC quotas, saying it needs to produce more oil to
rebuild its war-torn economy following eight years of fighting with
Iran.
   On Monday, North Sea Brent crude for delivery in October was
quoted at $13.25, up slightly from Friday.

<HEAD>Harvest Pressures Soybean Futures To 16-Week Low</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soybean futures prices plunged Monday to their
lowest close in nearly four months on the Chicago Board of Trade as
the accelerating harvest brought new supplies to the market.
   Grain futures also finished lower with oats for December and
March delivery closing down the allowable limit of 10 cents a
bushel.
   Soybeans for delivery in November plummeted more than 26 cents
to close at the day's low of $8.06 a bushel. That was the lowest
closing price for soybean futures since June 1, when soybeans for
July delivery finished at $8.01} a bushel.
   Fine harvesting weather in the Midwest over the weekend and
rains in major soybean-growing areas of Brazil and Argentina
prompted heavy selling, analysts said.
   ``The market's very much on the defensive with the harvest going
on,'' said Victor Lespinasse, a trader with Dean Witter Reynolds
Inc.
   Harvest pressure also weighed on the corn market while wheat
prices fell on a lack of significant new export business, analysts
said.
   The corn market ignored bullish reports that aflatoxin, a
carcinogenic fungus, had been found in some samples of corn from
grain elevators in Iowa and Indiana.
   At the close, wheat was 3{ cents to 5\ cents lower with the
contract for delivery in December at $4.21{ a bushel; corn was 3\
cents to 5{ cents lower with December at $2.80} a bushel; oats were
6\ cents to 10 cents lower with December at $2.44{ a bushel;
soybeans were 13 cents to 27\ cents lower with November at $8.06 a

<HEAD>Securities Industry Group President Offers Dismal Post-Crash
Review</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Crash-Reforms</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's leading securities industry group
offered a bleak assessment Monday of the year since the stock crash
and predicted individual investors will shun the market until they
see major reforms.
   Edward I. O'Brien, president of the Securities Industry
Association, said in a statement that although the worst fears
about the economy never materialized after the Oct. 19 collapse and
market conditions have improved in some areas, ``the overall
current environment is at best gray.''
   He said the SIA, the main trade group of Wall Street, ``believes
the near-term outlook isn't likely to improve substantially until
full investor confidence is restored in both the integrity of the
marketplace and the strength of the economy.''
   In the longer term, he said, ``lackluster equities prices will
make it more difficult for companies to raise equity funds at the
very time capital needs and reconstruction of industry are
necessary to effectively compete in the world market for goods and
services.''
   O'Brien's remarks were part of what the SIA called his overview
of events since the crash, which erased 508 points from the Dow
Jones industrial average and has continued to undermine the health
of the securities industry.
   Quoting what he called currently available data, O'Brien said
the dollar amount of common stock offerings fell 37.5 percent in
the first half of 1988 vs. the same time a year earlier. The drop
would have been sharper without the inclusion of offerings in
special investment companies called closed-end funds.
   Although prices of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues have
partly recovered from post-crash lows, they averaged only $32.80
through August 1988, well below $44 in September 1987, O'Brien said.
   Volume on the NYSE through July remained 8 percent off the 1987
average, and the drop would have been even sharper without
inclusion of volume-inflating strategies in which stocks are traded
to capture quarterly dividends, he said.
   Largely as a result of these conditions, layoffs and furloughs
in the business totaled 16,000 nationwide through the first
quarter, he said.
   O'Brien said there have been a few steps to correct problems
exposed as a result of the crash, ``but major regulatory reform
hasn't taken place.''
   As an example, he said no concerted effort has emerged to place
financial markets under one regulator, a key recommendation of a
presidential commission that examined the crash. He also said the
markets themselves have so far failed to agree on common ways to
stop or slow the impact of another panic.
   ``Failure to have these and other systems in place contributed
to the October 19 freefall; and until they are rectified, the
individual investor is likely to continue to be wary of the
marketplace,'' O'Brien concluded.

   A federal judge has denied Interco Inc.'s
request for a preliminary injunction against a $2.64 billion cash
tender offer for Interco by a Washington, D.C.-based investor
group, it was announced Monday.
   U.S. District Judge Joseph J. Farnan Jr. of Wilmington, Del.,
ruled against St. Louis-based Interco on Friday, according to the
investor group, Cardinal Acquisition Corp., which is headed by the
brothers Steven and Mitchell Rales.
   Interco's brands include Ethan Allen and Broyhill furniture,
London Fog outerwear, and Florsheim and Converse shoes.
   Cardinal's $70-a-share tender offer expires Friday at midnight.
Last week Interco's directors spurned a $72-a-share offer that was
conditioned on Interco's providing certain confidential information
to the bidders.
   The offer of $70 a share places a value on the company of $2.64
billion, based on Interco's 35 million outstanding shares,
currently exercisable options for 1.14 million shares, and
preferred stock convertible into 1.59 million shares.

<HEAD>Time Magazine Making Some Changes in Design</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Time Inc. is changing the layout of its flagship
magazine to make it easier to read, but an editor says the changes
are minor and most readers may not even notice.
   The changes will include the expansion of Time's one-page index
to two pages, introduction of new ``Travel'' and ``Interview''
sections and use of bigger and more informative headlines and photo
captions, executives said Monday.
   Richard Duncan, assistant managing editor of Time magazine, said
the changes represent ``a tuning up and modification of our 1977
redesign'' that signalled the regular use of color photographs in
the magazine.
   He said some of the changes, such as longer headlines and
captions, have been used on occasion over the past few months.
   But he said all of the changes become magazine policy starting
with the Oct. 17 issue, which will appear on newstands starting
Oct. 10.
   Managing Editor Henry Muller was in private meetings all day
Monday, outlining the changes to Time's bureau chiefs and editors
who were not involved with the changes, Duncan said. The company
has called its ad salesmen and managers in for a similar meeting on
Tuesday.
   Duncan said the changes reflect a response to the increasing
demands on readers' time and attention.
   ``The key is to increase the accessibility of the story to the
reader,'' he said. ``We're helping them grab the essence of the
story.''
   Along with bigger headlines and longer captions, he said, the
magazine will make more extensive use of taking quotes from a story
and putting them in a box to draw more attention to the story.
   He said he did not know if the average reader would have noticed
the changes if the magazine did not call attention to them.
   The new ``Travel'' section will carry stories about issues such
as fare wars as well destinations, while the ``Interview'' section
will use a question-and-answer format, alternating with the
``Profile'' section, he said.
   The magazine also will offer an ``American Ideas'' section,
alternating with its ``American Scene'' section and focusing on
people and how they succeeed or fail at bringing off their ideas.
   Time is the largest of the weekly newsmagazines, with a
circulation of 4.6 million, unchanged from a year ago.
   For the first eight months of this year, Time's ad pages rose
2.5 percent to 1,487.32 from a year ago while its ad revnue rose
3.6 percent to $205 million, according to a survey by Publishers
Information Bureau for the research firm Leading National
Advertisers.
   Newsweek, on the other hand, saw its ad pages fall 4.6 percent
to 1,467.97 in the first eight months, and its ad revenue slip 1.8
percent to $140 million, the report said.
   U.S. News & World Report had a 12.2 percent increase in ad pages
to 1,090.72, while its ad revenue rose 20.2 percent to $73.4
million.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar shook off central bank selling and
closed mostly higher Monday, reflecting traders' optimism that the
U.S. currency would remain strong.
   Gold prices rose in domestic trading after falling overseas.
Republic National Bank of New York quoted a bid of $395 for a troy
ounce of gold as of 4 p.m. EDT, up $1.25 from late Friday's bid of
$393.75.
   At a weekend meeting in Berlin, finance ministers of the seven
industrial nations known as the Group of Seven reaffirmed their
intention to keep currency rates stable.
   But Jack Barbanel, a vice president with Gruntal & Co. Inc.,
said the meeting did not seem to influence the dollar's direction
Monday.
   Investors were reacting to positive factors including a recent
narrowing of the U.S. trade deficit and the conservative attitude
of the Federal Reserve toward interest rates, Barbanel said.
   ``The pressure is for the dollar to stay at these levels or go
higher,'' he said.
   The central banks of several nations entered foreign-exchange
markets to stem the dollar's rise, but the currency still chalked
up a gain.
   The Federal Reserve and central banks of West Germany, Britain,
France, Switzerland, Italy and Austria all intervened to sell
dollars, dealers said.
   In Tokyo, the dollar rose 0.26 Japanese yen to a closing 134.73
yen. Later, in London, it was quoted at 134.70 yen, and the U.S.
currency ended the day by rising to 134.535 yen in New York, up
from late Friday's 134.325.
   In London, the dollar gained against the British pound. It cost
$1.6668 to buy one pound, cheaper than $1.6715 late Friday. In New
York, however, the pound edged up against the dollar, closing at
$1.6720, up from $1.6715 late Friday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday's
rates, included: 1.8817 West German marks, up from 1.8735; 1.5910
Swiss francs, up from 1.5827; 6.4035 French francs, up from 6.3870;
1,401.37 Italian lire, up from 1,399.00; and 1.2195 Canadian
dollars, down from 1.2223.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Friday's
prices, included: 1.8835 West German marks, up from 1.8750; 1.5935
Swiss francs, up from 1.5850; 6.5000 French francs, up from 6.3888;
2.1230 Dutch guilders, up from 2.1140; 1.403.50 Italian lire, up
from 1,400.50; 1.2211 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2220.
   Gold prices steadied in New York Monday after plunging through
the $400 mark last week. On the Commodity Exchange, a troy ounce of
gold closed at $395.10, up from $394.20 late Friday.
   In overseas trading, gold prices fell, but traders predicted
there would be demand for the metal in coming days.
   ``We've seen the worst, at least for the time being,'' said one
bullion dealer in Zurich, Switzerland.
   Gold fell in earlier London trading to a late bid price of
$394.50 a troy ounce, down from late Friday's $396.50, and also
declined in Zurich to $392, down from $398 late Friday.
   All financial institutions in Hong Kong were closed Monday for
the Chinese Mid-Autumn Festival holiday.
   Silver prices fell. On the Commodity Exchange, a troy ounce of
silver dipped to $6.107 from $6.167. In London trading, the metal
was bid late in the day at $6.16 a troy ounce, down from Friday's
$6.22.

<HEAD>Retailer Reports Quarterly Loss, Annual Profit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Carter Hawley Hale Stores Inc. on Monday said
it lost $9 million in the final quarter of its fiscal year but
managed to post a profit for the 12-month period.
   The shortfall still was an improvement over the year-ago
quarter, when the retailer reported a loss of $188.8 million.
   Sales during the quarter ended July 30 totaled $594.5 million,
virtually unchanged from a year earlier.
   For the full year, Carter Hawley reported a profit of $17.7
million, a dramatic turnaround from a $178.7 million loss in the
previous year when the Neiman-Marcus unit was spun off to fight a
takeover attempt.
   The company reported sales in the 1988 fiscal year of $2.6
billion, compared with 1987 sales of $2.9 billion.
   The 1988 results include one-time gains of $30 million on the
sale of a shopping center and $10.1 million from an accounting
change. Those gains were partly offset by one-time charges totaling
$30.3 million for changes to operations and early payment of debt.
   The company's 1987 losses were blamed on a restructuring
undertaken to fight a takeover attempt by rival retailer The
Limited of Columbus, Ohio.
   Carter Hawley spun off its specialty stores, Nieman-Marcus,
Bergdorf Goodman and Contempo Casuals, into a separate public
company whose majority shareholder is General Cinema Corp. of
Chestnut Hill, Mass., a large Carter Hawley stockholder.
   Carter Hawley currently runs 113 department stores, including
the Broadway-Southern California, the Broadway-Southwest, Emporium
Capwell, Thalheimers and Weinstock's.

<HEAD>Partial Settlement Reported Near in Boesky-Related Civil Lawsuit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A partial settlement is close in a class-action
lawsuit between one of Ivan F. Boesky's companies and investors who
claim they were defrauded by the imprisoned speculator's insider
trading, lawyers said Monday.
   Key details were not disclosed, but the lawyers said it would
cause a realignment in the morass of civil suits and countersuits
that have enveloped Boesky since he paid the Securities and
Exchange Commission a record $100 million nearly two years ago in
penalties and illicit trading profits.
   ``We've got it virtually done,'' said David Berger, lead
co-counsel of a group of shareholders who sued Ivan F. Boesky &
Co., an investment vehicle once controlled by Boesky.
   The settlement would remove as defendants in the class-action
suit the limited partners in Boesky's investment company, who
themselves have sued Boesky on grounds he defrauded them.
   Boesky would remain a defendant in the class-action suit, as
would Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., the Wall Street firm he has
implicated in a number of allegedly fraudulent deals.
   Drexel was accused by the SEC earlier this month of extensive
securities law violations but has denied the charges. It remains
unclear what impact, if any, the partial settlement disclosed
Monday would have on the Drexel litigation.
   Berger declined to comment on reports that the partial
settlement could involve between $30 million and $50 million in
compensation payments to his clients.
   ``I've been working for one and a half years to get this
settlement, and don't want to see premature publicity,'' he said.
   Others however, speaking on condition they not be identified,
said the compensation element of the settlement remains unresolved
and would involve petitioning the SEC, which will use part of
Boesky's surrendered money to repay others who can prove they were
victimized.
   In addition, these lawyers said, Berger's clients would need the
approval of the U.S. District Court in Manhattan, where all of the
Boesky-related civil litigation has been filed.
   The SEC, which has been drafting a plan for how to compensate
Boesky's victims, is scheduled to complete it by Oct. 3. SEC
officials declined to comment Monday on whether plaintiffs in the
class-action suit against Boesky would be part of that plan.
   Boesky and the entities he once controlled were inundated with
lawsuits after federal authorities disclosed his insider trading
activities in November 1986. Most of the suits were by shareholders
who were selling stock at the time Boesky and his associates were
buying.
   The speculator began serving a three-year federal prison term
last March after he pleaded guilty to a charge of conspiracy to lie
to the SEC.

<HEAD>GM Chairman Says Aerospace Techniques Move Into Auto Industry</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM S. BERGSTROM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Automakers have learned from defense and
aerospace programs how to develop coordinated systems rather than
sticking with component-oriented piecemeal design approaches,
General Motors Corp. Chairman Roger B. Smith said Monday.
                                                                                        echnologies,
integrating them
into new products and bringing the whole package to market more
quickly than anyone else,'' he said.
   Smith and Honda Motor Co. Chairman Tadashi Kume gave keynote
speeches at the opening of a four-day conference of the
International Federation of Automotive Engineering Societies.
   Renault Chairman Raymond H. Levy, another keynote speaker, was
unable to attend, but his prepared remarks were read by Mack Trucks
Inc. Chairman John B. Curcio.
   Smith said GM started its Project Trilby electronics and
computer-oriented engineering effort years ago to answer the
question, ``What would an automobile be like if, instead of the old
add-on approach, we started to design it today, with all of the ...
systems know-how and microprocessor technology that we have at our
disposal?''
   Resulting coordinated, systems-engineering methods are now
moving into mainstream auto design at GM, he said.
   Smith said those approaches are vital, not only for quicker
reaction to the market but to coordinate design of advanced
technology items such as active suspensions, automated braking
systems and traction control.
   Kume talked about his company's growth as an international auto
manufacturing power, and his resulting efforts to shake off
complacency in the ranks.
   Kume said he sometimes keeps his executives on their toes by
transferring them to new positions for which they have no apparent
background.
   ``Sometimes I do that by challenging the organization to meet
seemingly impossible goals,'' he said.
   ``The larger an organization becomes ... the more bureaucratic
it becomes. Persons become contented with a standard way of doing
things. No chances are taken. No mistakes are made,'' he said.
   Spreading into worldwide markets also helps avoid those
tendencies, Kume said. ``Internationalization of our company is
causing it to become more flexible, and from this flexibility comes
more creativity,'' he said.
   Levy estimated in his remarks that 25 million to 30 million
people worldwide work in auto-related jobs. But he predicted a 50
percent drop in auto industry employment by 1992.
   Increased use of outside suppliers, fewer supervisors as
production workers assume more responsibility, and fewer white
collar workers as computers are used for more tasks will contribute
to the decline, Levy said in the remarks delivered by Curcio.
   Nearly 200 technical presentations are slated during the
conference, which continues through Thursday, on topics such as
vehicle handling, composite materials, suspension systems, vehicle
safety, power train design and electronic controls.
   The international gathering of 22 automotive engineering
societies is hosted by the Society of Automotive Engineers Inc. in
the United States.

<HEAD>Harvest Pressures Soybean Futures To Lowest Close In 16 Weeks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Soybean futures prices plunged Monday to their lowest close in
nearly four months on the Chicago Board of Trade as the
accelerating harvest brought new supplies to the market.
   Grain futures also finished lower with oats for December and
March delivery closing down the allowable limit of 10 cents a
bushel.
   On other markets, sugar and cocoa futures were sharply lower;
livestock and meat futures were sharply higher; energy futures
rose; precious metals were mixed and stock-index futures weakened.
   Soybeans for delivery in November plummeted more than 26 cents
to settle at $8.06\ a bushel, the lowest settlement price for
soybean futures since June 1, when the July contract finished at
$8.01} a bushel.
   On Aug. 24, soybeans for September delivery fell to $8 a bushel
in intra-day trading but settled that day at $8.31{.
   Fine harvesting weather in the Midwest and rains in major
soybean-growing areas of Brazil and Argentina prompted heavy
selling, analysts said.
   ``The market's very much on the defensive with the harvest going
on,'' said Victor Lespinasse, a trader with Dean Witter Reynolds
Inc.
   In addition to the harvest pressure, a dearth of significant
export orders has limited buying interest in soybean futures, said
Cathy Leow, an analyst with Thomson McKinnon Securities Inc. in New
York.
   ``Demand is eventually going to drive us higher, of course, but
... the longer we wait before we see some demand, the lower we're
going to go,'' she said.
   Harvest pressure also weighed on the corn market while wheat
prices fell on a lack of significant new export business, analysts
said.
   Wheat settled 3{ cents to 5\ cents lower with the contract for
delivery in December at $4.22\ a bushel; corn was 3\ cents to 5{
cents lower with December at $2.80} a bushel; oats were 5 cents to
10 cents lower with December at $2.44{ a bushel; soybeans were 12{
cents to 28} cents lower with November at $8.06\ a bushel.
   Sugar futures prices fell dramatically on New York's Coffee,
Sugar & Cocoa Exchange in a sell-off triggered by the sharp drop in
soybean futures, analysts said.
   Prices for March through October 1989 delivery skidded the
0.5-cent-a-pound daily limit while most contracts for nearer-term
delivery, which are not subject to the limit, fell even further.
   Sugar for delivery this October settled 0.5 cent lower at $9.49
a pound.
   Cocoa futures declined steeply in a continuing reaction to the
International Cocoa Organization's failure earlier this month to
devise a means of supporting prices.
   Prices are at 13-year lows and cocoa ``looks like a terminally
ill market with no cure in sight,'' said John Gambino, a technical
analyst with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Inc. in New York.
   Cocoa for December delivery settled $45 lower at $1,124 a metric
ton.
   Unexpectedly strong packer demand for hogs and fattened cattle
helped push some livestock futures up the 1.50-cents-a-pound daily
limit on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, analysts said.
   The pork market was especially strong, based on expectations
that Friday's quarterly Agriculture Department hogs-and-pigs report
will show that some producers abandoned expansion plans this year
because of the drought-driven increase in feed-grain costs, said
Chuck Levitt, an analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   Live cattle were .65 cent to 1.50 cents higher with October at
70.95 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .70 cent to 1.50 cents
higher with September at 80.17 cents a pound; hogs were .03 cent to
1.50 cents higher with October at 40.30 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .05 cent to .50 cent higher with February at 52.10
cents a pound.
   Gold futures rose slightly on New York's Commodity Exchange
while silver posted solid declines.
   Gold settled 30 cents to $1 higher with October at $495.80 a
troy ounce; silver was 6 cents to 7.5 cents lower with September at
$6.107 a troy ounce.
   Energy futures ended slightly higher on the New York Mercantile
Exchange in a volatile session that calmed on news that OPEC's
pricing committee had adjourned their weekend meeting in Brussels,
Belgium, with plans to meet again with the cartel's long-term
strategy committee.
   The 13-member Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is
seeking a solution to the OPEC overproduction that has been blamed
for persistent weakness of crude oil prices.
   West Texas Intermediate crude settled 2 cents to 4 cents higher
with November at $14.20 a barrel; heating oil was unchanged to .20
cent lower with October at 40.23 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline
was .05 cent to .31 cent higher with October at 45.25 cents a
gallon.
   Stock-index futures retreated on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, where the contract for December delivery of the Standard
& Poor's 500 index settled .30 point lower at 271.95.

   Kroger Co. said Monday it would sell stores
and food processing plants and reduce its work force as part of a
$4.6 billion restructuring aimed at defeating two takeover bids.
   Kroger officials contended the restructuring would be more
lucrative for shareholders than a $4.6 billion bid by Kohlberg
Kravis Roberts & Co. or a competing $4.32 billion offer from Dart
Group Corp.
   Late Friday, when Kroger announced that its board had approved
the restructuring, the company also said it had rejected both
offers as inadequate.
   Spokesmen for Dart and Kohlberg Kravis declined comment Monday.
   The restructuring, which must be approved by shareholders, is
worth $57 to $61 per share, or as much as $4.6 billion, officials
said.
   The plan, first publicly proposed on Sept. 13, would pay
shareholders $40 a share in cash, plus securities valued at $8 and
publicly-traded stock worth between $5 and $10. Kroger has 78.6
million outstanding shares.
   Dart, a retailing company which has made a number of
unsuccessful takeover bids in recent years, offered last Monday to
buy Kroger for $55 per share _ $43 in cash and securities valued at
$12 _ or about $4.32 billion.
   Kohlberg Kravis, which has outbid Dart for three other
corporations in recent years, entered the bidding last Tuesday by
offering to buy Kroger for $58.50 per share _ $50 in cash and $8.50
in securities, or a total of $4.6 billion.
   Goldman Sachs & Co., Kroger's adviser, told company officials
the Kohlberg Kravis offer raised antitrust issues because the
investment firm recently acquired two other grocery retailers,
Safeway Stores Inc. and Stop & Shop Cos.
   Kroger stock rose 62{ cents to close at $56.37{ a share in New
York Stock Exchange trading Monday.
   Company officials said at a news conference they expected the
asset sales to raise an estimated $333 million after taxes.
   The restructuring would make the company smaller and increase
its debt load, but leave it economically viable and competitive,
Chairman Lyle Everingham and President Joseph Pichler said.
   Everingham declined to reveal how many employees would be laid
off. The jobs would be eliminated at the grocery retailer's
Cincinnati headquarters, he said.
   Kroger said it would sell some of its food processing
facilities; its 27-store Fry's division in northern California; its
Welcome Inc. superwarehouse venture in the South and 29
supermarkets in North Carolina and South Carolina.
   The company also said it would sell its 16-unit Price Savers
Wholesale Warehouse Inc. to a management-led investment group, and
proceed with the sale of its Florida Choice division, which
comprises 43 supermarkets and 39 liquor stores.
   Kroger also announced plans to sell and then lease back stores
and real estate in Texas and sell its general merchandise
distribution center in San Marcos, Texas.
   The retailer said it had commitments for $3.6 billion in
financing for the restructuring.
   Kroger, founded in 1883 by shopkeeper Barney H. Kroger, operates
more than 1,300 supermarkets, 935 convenience stores and 15
membership warehouses in 29 states. The company also processes a
variety of food products for sale in its retail stores and to
outside customers.
   Kohlberg Kravis won a hostile takeover battle for Beatrice Cos.
in 1985, in which the Haft family was a bidder, and outbid the
Hafts for Safeway in 1986 and Stop & Shop earlier this year.
   Dart Group owns the Crown Books bookstore chain and the auto
parts retailer Trak Auto Stores.

<HEAD>SmithKline Restructuring Expected At Tuesday Board Meeting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Announcement of a major restructuring at
SmithKline Beckman Corp., whose profits have declined, could come
after a board meeting of the pharmaceutical company expected to
take place Wednesday.
   The firm announced in July it planned to cut costs and become
more efficient by restructuring its corporate staff. The firm has
refused to divulge details of the restructuring.
   Analysts and development officials who have spoken to SmithKline
executives believe the shakeup could lead to layoffs of as many as
3,000 worldwide.
   PaineWebber Inc. analyst Ron Nordmann said as many as 2,000 of
SmithKline's employees could be laid off, but cautioned that ``the
restructuring may be more far-reaching than that.''
   Analysts have said they expect the board meeting Wednesday, but
SmithKline refused to confirm the date.
   ``We just can't comment on anything right at the moment,'' a
spokesman said last week. ``We have announced that we are studying
the restructuring of the pharmaceutical business and corporate
staff, and work is continuing, but we can't say anything fruther at
this time.''
   The company said in July that it would reorganize its business
following a lackluster first-half performance in which earnings
dropped by 25 percent. The company also predicted that earnings for
the full 1988 fiscal year would be off by 25 percent as well.
   SmithKline blamed the drop in its profits on the disappointing
sales of its two top drugs _ Tagamet, an anti-ulcer drug, and
Dyazide, a drug used in the treatment of hypertension.

<HEAD>KKR Said To Face Deadline for Amending Macmillan Bid</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An investment group aligned with Macmillan Inc.
management said Monday it was considering amending its $2.36
billion buyout bid for the publishing concern, but a deadline
passed without an announcement.
   The British publisher Robert Maxwell has made a competing offer
of $2.41 billion in cash for all of the company's stock, but
Macmillan's board has taken no position on it and said it wanted
``to continue the auction process.''
   Nonetheless, Macmillan appeared to be moving toward a resolution
of the takeover contest that began in mid-May.
   In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the
investment firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. said Macmillan had
advised it Friday that the bidding process was ``drawing to a
close'' and requested that if Kohlberg planned to amend its bid, it
should advise the company by 5:30 p.m. Monday.
   As the deadline passed, spokesmen for the company were
unavailable for comment.
   The Dow Jones Professional Investor Report said, however, that a
source close to Macmillan said its board was scheduled to meet
Tuesday before the stock market opened.
   In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Macmillan stock rose
62{ cents a share to $87.25, which was slightly higher than
Maxwell's bid of $86.80 a share.

   Scores of leftist militants fought running battles
with truncheon-swinging riot police Monday night during protests
against world financial discussions, witnesses said.
   Several rioters were hauled away in police vans, and paramedics
said some protesters and police officers were injured. No figures
were given on the injuries.
   The incidents were the first serious clashes between
demonstrators and police since World Bank-International Monetary
Fund talks began in West Berlin last Thursday.
   Militants threw stones at the windows of downtown stores, banks
and cars. They dragged a small car from its parking place and used
it to block Kurfuerstendamm, the city's main boulevard.
   Police moved in with truncheons, and smashed camera equipment of
photographers taking pictures of the violence, reporters at the
scene said. The street was cleared.
   Some reports said that at one point Bavarian state police
officers used their truncheons to beat plainclothes West Berlin
police. About 2,700 police from across West Germany have been
transported to West Berlin to help the city's 6,000-strong force
during the financial talks.
   The violence broke out after about 500 radicals blocked streets
leading to the German Opera, where hundreds of people were watching
a production of Mozart's ``Magic Flute'' staged especially for
delegates and guests of the talks, witnesses said.
   Some protesters left after warnings by police but others refused
to budge, said witnesses, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Police threw a tear-gas grenade as protesters fled down a
street, they said.
   About 100 of the demonstrators ran to a square near West
Berlin's famed Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church where they again
fought police, then fled once more, according to the witnesses.
   Other protesters fought with police on a nearby square and at
other sites downtown, said the reporters.
   On Sunday, tens of thousands of people held a mostly peaceful
march in West Berlin to protest what they called unfair financial
policies by industrialized nations toward heavily indebted Third
World lands.
   Several peaceful demonstrations were held earlier Monday.

<HEAD>A&P's Earnings Up 21 Percent in Second Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MONTVALE, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co. Inc. said
its second-quarter earnings jumped 21 percent from the year-earlier
quarter.
   The supermarket company reported Monday that its net income rose
to $29.4 million, or 77 cents a share, in the three months ended
Sept. 10 from $24.3 million, or 64 cents a share, a year earlier.
   Second-quarter sales rose 5.8 percent, to $2.3 billion.
   James Wood, A&P's chairman and chief executive officer, said he
was pleased with the continued positive earnings trend.
   The company, which has had some financial problems in recent
years, opened nine new stores in the first half of 1988, including
several ``upscale'' markets in high-income areas.
   At the same time, Wood said, A&P closed 22 older, money-losing
stores.
   ``We expect to open an additional 20 to 25 new stores and
remodel or expand another 60 units during the last half of the
fiscal year,'' he said.
   In the first half of A&P's fiscal year, net income jumped 23.4
percent _ to $67.5 million, or $1.77 a share, from $54.7 million,
or $1.44 a share.
   First-half sales rose 4.5 percent, to $5.3 billion from $5.1
billion.
   The company now has 1,170 supermarkets in 25 states and Canada
under the trade names of A&P, Super Fresh, Food Emporium, Kohl's,
Dominion and Waldbaum's.

<HEAD>Ford Raises Fourth-Quarter Production for Third Time</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ford Motor Co. has scheduled the third increase
in car production for the fourth quarter _ raising its total by
23,000 cars to 455,000, a company spokesman said Monday.
   On July 1, Ford projected a fourth-quarter output of 382,000
cars, but has raised production three times since then, with the
latest increase coming last Friday, spokesman Ray Windecker said.
   ``We expect the remainder of the year to continue at good to
very good sales rates,'' said Robert L. Rewey, Ford vice president
of sales operations. ``To back up that projection we have, in the
past 90 days, added 73,000 cars to our fourth-quarter U.S.
production schedule.''
   Windecker said Ford quarterly sales of several models had been
surprisingly high, helping create an increase.
   Sales of the luxury Lincoln Continental nearly have tripled from
the June 21-Sept. 20 periods of 1987 and 1988, from 3,105 last year
to 9,105 this year.
   Also, Mustang and Probe sales for the period were up from 39,178
in 1987 to 61,314 this year, while Tempo and Topaz sales went from
60,677 to 95,182 this year, Windecker said.
   However, he said, there were no planned layoffs that would be
affected by the production increase.

<HEAD>Trial Begins Bottlers' Federal Court Suit Against Coca-Cola</HEAD>

   Coca-Cola Co. hurt its independent
bottlers when it changed its syrup formula and did not pass on the
savings, a bottler testified Monday as trial began in a federal
court suit against the soft-drink manufacturer.
   The U.S. District Court trial, which is expected to take five
months, involves 24 independent bottlers seeking to have the court
uphold a 1921 pact tying the price they pay for Coca-Cola syrup to
the cost of sugar.
   If successful, the bottlers could realize up to $35 million in
damages.
   William B. Schmidt of Elizabethtown, Ky., who filed the lawsuit,
testified that Coke began substituting high-fructose corn syrup for
sucrose as a sweetener in 1980 without passing the savings on to
bottlers.
   Schmidt, whose grandfather established the fifth Coke bottling
plant in the United States, said the changes made it difficult for
him to compete with other major brands, such as Pepsi Cola.
   ``The company said they'd go to a 50-50 sugar-fructose syrup,''
Schmidt testified. ``The problem was if Coke went to fructose, the
cost decreases. Unless the decreased cost is passed on to the
bottler then competitors would also add fructose and be able to
charge less.''
   Jane F. Vehko, an attorney who argued for the bottlers, alleged
during opening arguments Monday that Atlanta-based Coca-Cola
``broke its promise'' to use sugar as a sweetener, and when it
changed to a cheaper sweetener refused to pass the savings on the
bottlers.
   Frank C. Jones, Coke's attorney, argued the bottlers are not
entitled to any monetary relief.
   ``The bottlers never contended they had a veto right'' to a
change in ingredients in the syrup under the 1921 pact, Jones said.
   He said in 1971 and 1974, Coke changed the caffeine content in
its product without consulting the bottlers, and there were no
complaints from the bottlers.
   ``It's absurd to think (any bottler) would have the power to
veto a sweetener change,'' Jones said.

   Scores of leftist militants fought running battles
with truncheon-swinging riot police Monday night during protests
against world financial policy toward poor countries.
   Several rioters were hauled away in police vans, and paramedics
said some protesters and police officers were injured. A police
spokesman said he had no figures on injuries. The ZDF television
network said 80 people were arrested.
   Police at one point fire tear gas at demonstrators who refused
to disperse, witnesses said. The demonstrations stopped by midnight
and streets were quiet.
   The incidents were the first serious clashes between
demonstrators and police since World Bank and International
Monetary Fund annual meetings began in West Berlin on Thursday.
   Militants threw stones at the windows of downtown stores, banks
and cars. They dragged a small car from its parking place and used
it to block Kurfuerstendamm, the city's main boulevard.
   Police moved in with truncheons, and smashed camera equipment of
photographers taking pictures of the violence, reporters at the
scene said. The street was cleared.
   Witnesses said at one point Bavarian state police officers used
truncheons to beat a West Berlin police officer. About 2,700 police
from across West Germany have been transported to West Berlin to
help the city's 6,000-strong force during the financial talks.
   The violence broke out after about 500 radicals blocked streets
leading to the German Opera, where hundreds of people were watching
a production of Mozart's ``Magic Flute'' staged especially for
delegates and guests of the talks, witnesses said.
   Some protesters left after warnings by police but others refused
to budge, said witnesses, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Police threw a tear-gas grenade as protesters fled down a
street, they said.
   About 100 of the demonstrators ran to a square near West
Berlin's famed Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church where they again
fought police, then fled once more, according to the witnesses.
   Other protesters fought with police on a nearby square and at
other sites downtown, said the reporters.
   On Sunday, tens of thousands of people held a mostly peaceful
march in West Berlin to protest what they called unfair financial
policies by industrialized nations toward heavily indebted Third
World countries.
   Several peaceful demonstrations were held earlier Monday.
