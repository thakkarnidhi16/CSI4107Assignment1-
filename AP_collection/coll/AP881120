   It's no joke that it's healthy to laugh when you
hurt, funny people Phyllis Diller and Art Buchwald told a medical
symposium.
   ``You can really help someone in the hospital tremendously by
cheering them up ... even when they have stitches and are not
supposed to laugh,'' said Buchwald, the 63-year-old Pulitzer
Prize-winning author and syndicated columnist.
   Miss Diller, the 71-year-old comedian who specializes in
portraying herself as fighting a losing battle against the ravages
of age, shook her head when asked whether humor keeps her looking
young.
   ``Surgery,'' she replied.
   For her, humor during childhood was a ``defense to not being
gorgeous.
   ``There was the Queen of May and there was me. I didn't even get
to February,'' she said.
   The two were featured speakers Sunday at Johns Hopkins Medical
Institutions' symposium ``Comedy as Catharsis: The Therapy of
Laughter.''

   ``Magnum, P.I.'' made Tom Selleck a rich man and
his recent movie deals have kept the dollars coming.
   But the handsome actor, soon to appear in ``Her Alibi,'' says
he's stimulating the economy, not just his bank account.
   ``You can so easily fall into the trap of wanting more and more
money, and how much is enough? But understand, I don't apologize for
making it,'' Selleck said in an interview in December's Cosmopolitan.
   ``People say, `Don't you feel guilty, when so many are starving?'
Well, I strongly believe that my success has created lots of jobs,''
said Selleck, who has invested in a restaurant in Hawaii and is
developing shopping centers.
   ``I don't stick the money in a mattress; I spend it, I directly
employ a lot of people. The fact that I'm hired for a movie gets it
financed, creates work. It's not that I take a bigger slice of the
pie _ I make the pie bigger.''

   Heartthrob Corbin Bernsen, who plays the
crafty divorce lawyer on NBC-TV's ``L.A. Law,'' has married British
actress Amanda Pays of ``Max Headroom'' fame, a publicist says.
   Bernsen, 34, who plays the silk-suited Arnie Becker on ``L.A.
Law,'' exchanged vows Saturday with Miss Pays, 29, in nearby
Calabasas as about 170 guests watched, spokeswoman Marilyn Heston
said.
   With ``L.A. Law'' still in production, honeymoon plans are on
hold for several weeks, she said.
   The couple, whose first child is due in March, lived together for
about a year at Bernsen's Hollywood Hills home and will continue to
reside there, Ms. Heston said.
   Miss Pays, who appeared in ``Max Headroom'' and the movie
``Oxford Blues,'' is awaiting the release of her latest film
``Leviathan'' in March.
   Bernsen has made three films scheduled for release in 1989,
including ``Major League,'' co-starring Charlie Sheen and Tom
Berenger.

   When the hands of the ``Doomsday Clock'' move
again, one of the scientists behind the change will be Soviet
physicist and human rights activist Andrei Sakharov.
   Sakharov, who has been in the United States, has agreed to join
in setting the clock that the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists uses to
estimate the relative chances of nuclear war, the publication said
Saturday.
   Sakharov was contacted in Cambridge, Mass., by Bernard Feld, a
Massachusetts Institute of Technology physicist and former Bulletin
editor.
   ``He was very pleased to be asked and had been interested in the
Bulletin for some time,'' Feld said.
   Sakharov becomes the 18th Nobel laureate among the 44 members of
the Bulletin's board of sponsors, which helps decide where to put
the minute hand of the ``Doomsday Clock'' that has been featured on
the cover of the magazine for 41 years.
   The clock is currently at six minutes to midnight, one minute
closer to doomsday than when it first appeared in 1947. It has
ranged from 12 minutes to two minutes.

   President Reagan wasn't there in person
but he helped ``roast'' Harry Caray, the baseball announcer who has
made ``holy cow'' a part of the sport's jargon in his 45 years at
the microphone.
   About 2,500 people, most of them Chicago Cubs fans flown in from
the Windy City, spent five hours listening to jokes about the
announcer Saturday night.
   In a video tribute for the 69-year Caray, Reagan recalled his
visit to the Cubs broadcast booth this summer.
   ``It's not often the president of the United States has trouble
getting a word in edgewise,'' Reagan said.
   Tommy Lasorda, manager of the world champion Los Angeles Dodgers,
said, ``If they don't put Harry Caray in the Baseball Hall of Fame,
they better destroy it.''
   Cubs pitcher Rick Sutcliffe also had kind words for the often
outspoken announcer.
   ``If you think I'm going to roast him in front of 2,500 people,
when he can roast me next year in front of 8 million, you're
crazy,'' he said.
   But Caray, at the end of the five-hour event, said, ``This is the
worst beating I've taken since my last divorce.''
   He then led the crowd in a chorus of ``Take Me Out to The
Ballgame.''
   The event was a fund-raiser for the Maryville Academy for orphans
and neglected children in Des Plaines, a Chicago suburb. The academy
was founded in 1883 and has provided a home for more than 60,000
youngsters over the years.

   At least two snipers, firing
from Mexican cliffs along the Rio Grande, opened fire on three
rafters, killing one and wounding the other two, authorities said
Sunday.
   The river guide walked through thick brush after Saturday's
attack in southwestern Texas, and was seen by a farmer when he
reached a highway on Sunday morning. A woman who was shot hid in
brush overnight.
   U.S. and Mexican authorities flew over the area in a helicopter
and spotted the dead man's body on the riverbank, said Mike Cox, a
spokesman for the Texas Department of Public Safety in Austin.
   Cox said it was the second time this year that American tourists
in the area have reported being shot at from Mexican bluffs.
   Between 20 and 30 shots were fired, Cox said, adding that the
area where shell casings were found was remote and reachable only by
boat or helicopter and was once notorious for its marijuana
cultivation.
   The casings were 30-30 caliber, which are used in rifles;
.44-caliber Magnum; and .22-caliber, Cox said.
   ``The woman says it was a nightmare,'' Cox said. ``There was no
provocation or anything. It was just an attack. They were just a
married couple who were tourists in the area. The woman believed
that two people were on the bluff. The guide said he saw four.
   ``They were in an area of high bluffs on the river,'' Cox said.
``The woman said she remembered seeing some smoke coming from the
high bluff on the Mexican side of the river ... and that moments
later, shots were fired and bullets hit on either side of their
raft.''
   Guide Jim Burr, 36, had led the raft about two miles downriver
from a remote camp area when the shooting began about noon Saturday.
   ``They were in what is known as Colorado Canyon on the American
side of the river in an area about 30 miles east of Presidio,'' Cox
said.
   Burr was shot first, in the right thigh, but managed to get the
raft to shore, where all three got out, Cox said.
   The snipers continued shooting, and the three got back into the
raft and went farther downstream, Cox said.
   ``He (Burr) thought he could get to a better point of safety, so
they got back in the raft and hugging closely on the shore
(continued) to get on down the river,'' Cox said.
   As the shots continued, the trio pulled ashore again to seek
shelter in the brush. As they were getting out of the raft, Jamie
Heffley was shot in the left side and left shoulder, Cox said. Her
husband, Michael W. Heffley, 40, was trying to help her to safety
when he was shot in the back and killed, Cox said. The injured were
taken to Brewster Memorial Hospital in Alpine, about 80 miles from
the national park, where night supervisor Joyce Rutledge said late
Sunday they were in stable condition.
   U.S. and Mexican officials were working together to find the
snipers.
   The Heffleys were from Eastland, about 60 miles east of Abilene,
Cox said.

   Christina Onassis, heir to the
billion-dollar fortune of Greek shipping tycoon Aristotle Onassis,
suffered an apparent heart attack Saturday and died, officials said.
She was 37.
   Miss Onassis, whose famous father, stormy romances and huge
fortune made her an international celebrity, was stricken at a
country club swimming pool about 25 miles northwest of Buenos Aires,
a doctor said.
   Miss Onassis, who was married four times and had a 3-year-old
daughter, was the stepdaughter of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, widow
of the late President John Kennedy who married Aristotle Onassis in
1968.
   Dr. Hernan Bunge, a director of the Clinica del Sol Hospital in
Buenos Aires, said Miss Onassis was stricken at the weekend home of
close friends Marina and Alberto Dodero at the Tortuguitas Country
Club.
   Miss Onassis fell ill as she prepared to go swimming about 11
a.m. (9 a.m. EST) in a pool at the home. She was taken to a country
club first-aid station station for attention, then to the clinic,
where she was pronounced dead at 3 p.m., he said.
   The body was taken to a morgue for an autopsy and then to a Greek
Orthodox church for a ceremony.
   The findings of the autopsy were not immediately announced. A
police officer at the morgue said a death certificate could not be
issued until the cause of death was officially determined.
   A woman who identified herself as Annabella Onassis, a cousin,
told reporters at the church that Miss Onassis ``died in the
bathroom'' of the Dodero home.
   ``She had been feeling fine,'' Annabella Onassis said. ``In fact,
she felt very well during a party yesterday at the club.''
   Asked if Miss Onassis' death could have involved suicide, the
woman replied: ``A happy person can never commit suicide and
Christina was content and happy. She didn't have any (apparent)
health problems.''
   A woman identifying herself as Mary Onassis, an aunt, said Miss
Onassis' remains would be flown to Greece on Monday or Tuesday for
burial on the family-owned island of Skorpios beside the graves of
her father and brother, Alexander, who died in a 1973 plane crash.
   Alexander and Christina were Aristotle Onassis' only children.
   Mary Onassis told reporters that her neice had planned to attend
a party Saturday night given by the local Greek community.
   ``Christina was in the best part of her life,'' she added.
   The official news agency Telam said Miss Onassis was stricken as
she changed to go swimming in the pool at the Dodero home.
   Buenos Aires police said the administrator of the country club,
site of about 350 weekend homes, told them that Miss Onassis had
died of a heart attack. Bunge said Miss Onassis was dead on arrival
at the clinic.
   A spokesman for the Greek Orthodox Archbishop's office said Miss
Onassis' body would remain at the church until the arrival of her
fourth husband, French businessman Thierry Roussel, from Paris.
   Roussel was expected to take charge of arrangements to fly Miss
Onassis' body to Greece for burial on the island of Skorpios, the
spokesman said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Miss Onassis and Roussel were married in 1984 and had a daughter,
Athena, in early 1985. Eight months later the heiress filed for
divorce, her fourth.
   Miss Onassis arrived in Buenos Aires on one of her frequent
visits to the Doderos, an Argentine shipping family closely
associated with her late father, the legendary Greek shipping
magnate whose larger-than-life image is chronicled in books and
films.
   Aristotle Onassis lived in Argentina as a young man and held dual
Greek and Argentine citizenship.
   The heiress, who usually stayed with the Doderos at their
downtown Buenos Aires apartment or in a luxury hotel, told reporters
that she had come to help celebrate the 40th birthday of Marina
Dodero.
   Miss Onassis inherited her father's shipping and real estate
empire when he died in 1975 and was worth an estimated $1 billion.
   She reportedly didn't get along with her famous stepmother. After
Onassis died, his daughter and other members of the Onassis family
reportedly offered Mrs. Kennedy Onassis a multi-million dollar
settlement to give up her rights to the Greek magnate's estate, news
reports indicated.
   She married Roussel in March 1984. Her first marriage was in 1971
to Los Angeles real estate broker Joseph Bolker, who was nearly
twice her 20 years. Their marriage ended after nine months. Her
second marriage to Alexander Andreadis, the heir of another Greek
shipping fortune, also was short-lived and ended in 1976.
   Her third, perhaps most widely publicized marriage was in 1978,
in Moscow to a Soviet civil servant, Serguei Kauzov. They were
divorced less than two years later.
   Miss Onassis maintained residences in Paris and St. Moritz,
Switzerland. She was born Dec. 11, 1950, in New York City.

Truck</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Two men and two teen-age girls, whose bodies
were found Saturday morning in a truck with its engine running in
the woods, died of carbon monoxide poisoning, an autopsy showed.
   ``It's just a sad and very unfortunate accident,'' said District
Attorney John Conte.
   The four victims were in a four-wheel drive truck that apparently
was climbing a dirt hill and became stuck, said state Trooper Robert
C. Meier.
   Meier said the exhaust pipe was clogged with mud, which could
have caused the fumes to fill the truck and cause asphyxiation.
   ``Speculation is that they tried to get out of the mud and
decided to wait until morning. The right rear tire had blown,''
Conte said.
   He added that he doubted alcohol was involved.
   Dr. John Krolikowski completed autopsies at the University of
Massachusetts Medical Center about 5:30 p.m. Saturday, Conte said.
   The victims were identified as Kimberly McNeill, 18, of Upton;
Darlene Whitney, 17, of Grafton; Douglas Scobie, 25, of Hopkinton;
and Hans Rosenberger, 24, of Mendon.
   Conte said a hunter discovered the victims' bodies about 7:45
a.m. Saturday in Upton State Forest.

   Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos met with the FBI
again Saturday, and Mrs. Marcos said the American justice system was
going to be the death of her husband.
   ``Enough is enough,'' Mrs. Marcos said in a statement released
before the meeting, which was closed to reporters. ``The Filipino
people and the Marcoses have long been used and abused. You surely
will not stop until you have killed President Marcos of the
Philippines.''
   Marcos, the 71-year-old former president, and his wife waved
through their car windows as they passed with lawyers and an
entourage of about a dozen people and entered an underground garage.
   Nearly three hours later, they departed the same way, refusing to
answer questions.
   The FBI refused to release details, although spokesman Harlan
Frymire said things went more smoothly than the night before, when
the Marcoses cut short their visit because Marcos was tired and weak.
   ``He finished the processing and he is just cleaning up, washing
the ink off his hands,'' Frymire said. ``He provided fingerprints
and voice samples. She provided handwriting samples. Everything was
accomplished without any complications.''
   The Marcoses were to submit fingerprints and voice samples,
according to Marcos' Washington attorney Richard Hibey. They also
were to sign forms authorizing U.S. investigators to search the
records of several foreign banks where they are said to have assets.
   A federal grand jury in New York last month indicted the Marcoses
on federal racketeering charges accusing them of plundering $103
million from the Philippine treasury and defrauding U.S. banks of
$165 million.
   Mrs. Marcos, 59, pleaded innocent to the charges and was released
on $5 million bail provided by tobacco heiress Doris Duke, a close
friend who owns a home here. While in New York, Mrs. Marcos provided
some the the required samples, including finger and palm prints.
   Marcos has not been arraigned. His attorneys claim he is too
frail to make the 10-hour trip to New York.
   The Marcoses supplied handwriting samples during Friday night's
three-hour session, but stopped because Marcos was too tired to
continue, Hibey said.
   ``It takes a while to do these things,'' Hibey said. ``They were
very cooperative. So was the FBI. He just got very tired.''
   Attorneys and FBI agents shielded the Marcoses from journalists,
and the couple refused to answer questions as they left the Prince
Kuhio Federal Building Friday night. Marcos sat in a wheelchair and
was wearing a neck brace, while his wife, wearing a floor-length red
gown, clutched a handkerchief and walked slowly beside him.
   In a statement later, Mrs. Marcos expressed her anger.
   ``Now I ask President Reagan for our basic human right to
country, freedom and justice,'' she said. ``If President Reagan
dared to ask the government of the U.S.S.R. for the human rights of
the people of Russia, why not also for the Marcoses, who are always
the United States' allies and friends.
   ``We are in the USA against our own free will,'' she said. ``The
Marcoses were kidnapped and deceived to come to America.''
   Marcos fled to Hawaii in February 1986 after a civilian-military
revolt catapulted President Corazon Aquino into office, ending his
20-year rule.
   He later claimed U.S. officials promised to fly him to his home
province of the Ilocos Norte, not to the United States.

   Mob boss Nicodemo ``Little Nicky'' Scarfo and
16 associates were convicted Saturday night in a racketeering
conspiracy that involved murder, extortion and other crimes.
   A federal jury deliberated 26 hours over three days before
returning the verdicts.
   The government contended the 17 defendants are members of
organized crime who conspired to participate in nine murders, four
attempted murders, extortions, drug dealing, loansharking and
illegal gambling. They each face up to 20 years in prison.
   ``I think every one of us was quietly confident,'' said Assistant
U.S. Attorney Louis Pichini. ``We were so terribly proud that the
system worked and did not buckle under.''
   He added, ``One of the things that this case did was it broke the
myth of the Mafia's invincibility.''
   Robert Simone, Scarfo's lawyer, hugged each defendant and patted
them on the back after the verdict.
   Outside the courtroom, Simone said the prosecution did ``more
than a decent job.''
   ``I never question what a jury does, win or lose,'' Simone said.
   U.S. District Judge Franklin VanAntwerpen warned the crowd before
the verdict was read that he would not tolerate any outcry or
demonstration, and there was none.
   A few of the relatives, most of them wives and children, gasped
when the first ``guilty'' verdict was read concerning Scarfo, 59,
who headed the list of defendants. Most of the relatives sat
stunned, a few wiped at their eyes and sobbed.
   Scarfo already is serving a 14-year prison term for conspiring to
extort $1 million from Philadelphia developer Willard Rouse III.
   In two other cases, defense attorneys successfully discredited
the informants to win acquittals for Scarfo _ in a drug case and in
the slaying of Salvatore Testa, who authorities said challenged
Scarfo's control of the Philadelphia-southern New Jersey crime
family.
   This time, each defendant was found guilty on the two main
racketeering counts they faced. In addition:
   _Francis Iannarella Jr. and Salvatore Scafidi were convicted of
operating an illegal gambling business;
   _Scarfo, his nephew Philip Leonetti, Salvatore Merlino and Joseph
Pungitore were convicted of sports bookmaking;
   _Joseph Pungitore was convicted of distributing methamphetamine;
   _Scarfo, Joseph Ciancaglini and Salvatore Merlino was convicted
of distributing 50 pounds of methamphetamine; and
   _Scarfo and Merlino were convicted of distributing
methamphetamine.
   Others convicted on the main racketeering counts were Lawrence
``Yogi'' Merlino, Charles ``Charlie White'' Iannece, Salvatore Wayne
Grande, Phillip Narducci, Frank Narducci Jr., Eugene ``Gino''
Milano, Ralph Staino Jr., Joseph Grande, Nicholas ``Nick the Blade''
Virgilio and Anthony Pungitore, Jr.
   At Pichini's request, VanAntwerpen revoked bail for the one
defendant who had not been linked to violent crimes. Scarfo and 15
of the other defendants have been in jail without bail since their
indictment earlier this year and were confined in the courthouse
through the deliberations.
   VanAntwerpen adjourned the court without setting a sentencing
date.
   Jurors had begun their third day of deliberations Saturday at 9
a.m.
   Defense attorneys had attacked the credibility of the
government's star witnesses, ex-mobsters Thomas ``Tommy Del''
DelGiorno and Nicholas ``Nicky Crow'' Caramandi, who have testified
in previous trials against Scarfo, who is from Atlantic City, N.J.
   Prosecutors pointed to secretly recorded tapes that they said
also showed the defendants' guilt.
   Thirty-three days of testimony included only two days by defense
witnesses. None of the defendants testified. It took five days for
opposing lawyers to sum up their arguments and VanAntwerpen needed a
full day to explain applicable laws to jurors before handing them
the case.
   During the trial, attention also was drawn to two of Scarfo's
sons, beginning with what authorities said was the attempted suicide
of Mark Scarfo, 17, in Atlantic City Nov. 1.
   Then, in the Philadelphia hospital where Mark was taken, Nicodemo
Scarfo Jr., 23, was charged with assaulting a woman in an elevator
Nov. 4 after visiting his brother.

   Authorities evacuated more than 500
people Saturday after a train carrying hazardous chemicals derailed
in north Alabama, and one car began leaking sulphuric acid.
   Officials built a sand levee to try to prevent the acid from
flowing into a nearby creek, said Lee Helms, director of operations
for the Alabama Emergency Management Agency.
   ``Some of it leaked into a swampy area that has leaked into a
creek,'' he said. ``We were able to damn it up pretty well, but some
of it did get into the creek.''
   He said the creek feeds the Mulberry Fork River, and officials
wanted to make sure that the acid doesn't contaminate area water
supplies. ``The river is quite a ways downstream, and not enough of
the acid has leaked into creek to have an impact,'' he said.
   The CSX train derailed for undetermined reasons about 5:30 p.m.
near Garden City, about 35 miles north of Birmingham.
   Helms said 500 to 550 people within 1{ miles of the derailment
were evacuated. Shelters were opened, and the evacuees would not be
allowed to returned to their homes until Sunday.
   ``We're going to keep the people out of the area until (Sunday)
sometime,'' he said. ``Early in the morning we're going to try to
upright the derailed cars, and there's the potential for some
problems although nothing severe.''
   Helms said ``some people experienced some irritation as far as
their eyes,'' but no one was hospitalized.
   After receiving conflicting reports, Helms said late Saturday
that 28 cars and three engines came off the track, but it was a
30,000-gallon tanker car that caused the most concern.
   ``Right now, the situation is under control and it doesn't look
like any danger as far as the sulphuric acid leak,'' Helms said.
``We don't see any problems with any of other cars that derailed.''
   Helms said two other cars were carrying flammable materials but
apparently did not rupture when the train derailed.

   An earthquake centered off the coast jolted
Southern California on Saturday night, alarming residents as far as
70 miles inland, but there were no immediate reports of injury or
damage, authorities said.
   The tremor, registered 4.5 on the Richter scale and struck at
9:40 p.m. said Hall Daily, spokesman for the seismological
laboratory at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena.
   The epicenter was in the Pacific Ocean, about 10 miles southwest
of Huntington Beach, an Orange County coastal community about 33
miles south of Los Angeles.
   The tremor was felt as far inland as Redlands, about 70 miles
from the coast. It was also felt throughout San Diego County, about
80 miles southeast of Los Angeles, and at least as far north as La
Crescenta, about 15 miles north of downtown.
   ``I felt maybe a four-second shake,'' said Michael Wilder of
Silver Lake, a community a few miles north of downtown Los Angeles.
``It didn't rattle anything loose, but it sure shook us.''
   There were no immediate reports of damage or injuries, Los
Angeles County sheriff's Deputy Detta Roberts said.
   ``It was weird, I was sitting here. I felt myself go back and
forth (in a chair),'' Ms. Roberts said. ```I thought I must have hit
the desk wrong. Usually, my heart goes into my throat, and this time
it didn't.''
   Authorities throughout the region reported receiving calls from
startled residents, but none were calling to report any injuries or
serious property damage.
   Earthquakes with a magnitude of 4.5 are classified as moderate,
but are capable of causing damage to homes and businesses.

   Throngs of people turned out Saturday for a
chance to buy buckets of conductors' badges, a bus odometer, old
signs and even an old subway car when the Transit Authority threw a
garage sale.
   ``I guess a lot has to do with memories,'' said Alan Unger of
Brooklyn, one of the lucky 2,000 who gained admission, for $5, to
the Transit Authority auction and ``tag sale'' of subway memorabilia.
   Unger, a medical investigator for the city's Health and Hospitals
Corporation, shelled out $16 for two 6-foot-long signs and two
subway photographs.
   For $90, Chris McGovern, a Solomon Brothers employee and
Manhattan resident, became the proud owner of an old roll sign,
reading ``Nassau Street.''
   ``It seems like this is a good piece of nostalgia for the
price,'' said McGovern.
   The proceeds, which amounted to $48,788, will go into for the
authority's general fund.
   The sale raised about $20,000 more than expected, said Gail
Dawson, deputy director of the Transit Museum, which gets part of
the proceeds.
   ``Volume was really good for the tag sale,'' Ms. Dawson said. ``I
don't know, people love this stuff.''
   A couple of subway workers rolled their eyes with disbelief while
buyers sifted through piles of rusty signs.
   ``Warning: Do Not Lean Over Edge of Platform,'' read one priced
at $150.
   The crowd snaked outside the subway museum, housed in a former
subway station in Brooklyn, and about 1,000 of them never got in.
   ``The line went all the way around the block. I nearly fell
over,'' said Jared Lebow, another transit spokesman.
   ``We're crazy,'' said JoAnne Martinez of Queens, who had been
waiting for 40 minutes.
   Her husband, Ray, a Police Department mechanic, hoped to buy some
of the Transit Authority badges tagged at $3 to $5 apiece.
   At the auction, Arthur Green, an entrepreneur from Woodstock,
N.Y., paid $3,000 for the 1937 subway car. He'll move it by flatbed
truck to Kingston, N.Y., where he plans to open a railroad exhibit.
   A solid oak ticket chopper, circa 1920, sold for $1,650. In those
days, passengers bought a ticket for a nickel, then a transit worker
pulled a lever to cut it in half as they entered the subway.
   A 4-foot-long, blue and white, oak-framed, circa 1920 sign that
read ``Interborough Rapid Transit Co.'' fetched $850. It used to
hang in the office of Transit Authority President David Gunn.
   A blue mosaic, bearing an ``H'' from the now-renovated Hoyt
Street station in Brooklyn, went for $850, while a snappy,
red-white-and-blue uniform from the defunct Transit Authority
marching band brought $250.

   Severe weather early Sunday in this
western Alabama city damaged houses, downed power lines and injured
an undetermined number of people, authorities said.
   J. Danny Cooper, director of the Alabama Emergency Management
Agency, said a tornado apparently touched down in Tuscaloosa about
12:45 a.m.
   However, Joe Wheeler, a meteorologist with the National Weather
Service in Birmingham, could not immediately confirm the tornado
report. He said an inspection would determine whether a twister
caused the damage.
   Cooper said it was difficult to immediately assess the damage
since the storm hit in the middle of the night and knocked out power
in much of the area.
   ``I would say it would be in the morning before we'll know the
total number of people injured,'' Cooper said from his agency's
Montgomery headquarters. ``This is very difficult situation in the
dead of the night.''
   A Tuscaloosa police dispatcher who refused to give her name said
people were hurt but she did not know how many or the seriousness of
their injuries.
   Tuscaloosa County was under a severe thunderstorm warning when
the tornado was reported.
   Cooper said Gov. Guy Hunt had authorized the Alabama National
Guard to provide emergency lights and generators to aid rescue
workers, who were moving door-to-door to assess the damage.

Afghanistan</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and
Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi of India said today that a
U.N.-supported international conference may be needed to establish a
broad-based government in Afghanistan.
   In a joint statement issued at the end of Gorbachev's three-day
state visit to New Delhi, the two leaders appealed to U.N.
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar to implement a United
Nations resolution stressing the need for a ``government of national
reconciliation in Afghanistan.''
   However, Gandhi said he and Gorbachev agreed to continue
supporting the government headed by President Najib.
   Najib has had little success persuading the Afghan Moslem
guerrillas fighting his forces to lay down their arms and join him
in what he calls the process of ``national reconciliation.''
   The United States and Pakistan have been the chief backers of the
Moslem guerrillas fighting Soviet and Afghan government troops.
   The Soviet Union is midway through the process of withdrawing its
troops from Afghanistan but said earlier this month that it was
temporarily halting the withdrawal because of recent rebel successes
in the Afghan battlefield.
   The Soviet withdrawal is scheduled to be completed by Feb. 15,
under the terms of a U.N.-sponsored accord signed in Geneva last
April.
   The statement signed by Gorbachev and Gandhi urged Perez de
Cuellar ``to implement without delay'' the General Assembly's Nov. 3
resolution that called for an end to outside interference in Afghan
affairs and stressed the need for a broad-based government.
   ``The formation of such a government in Afghanistan is a matter
exclusively for the Afghan people to decide,'' the Gorbachev-Gandhi
statement said. ``A U.N.-supported international conference may be
needed for this purpose.''
   It also said India and the Soviet Union ``deplored the
obstructionist policy of certain forces'' that were violating the
Geneva accord on Afghanistan.
   The joint statement did not name these forces, but on Saturday
Gorbachev accused the United States and Pakistan of creating
obstacles in the implementation of the Geneva Accord.
   ``Their actions appear to indicate that they would like us to
rescind those accords, even though the grave consequences of that
are obvious,'' Gorbachev said Saturday.
   Before Gorbachev left to return to Moscow, the Soviet leader and
Gandhi signed an agreement for the Soviet Union to build two nuclear
reactors for a power plant in the south Indian state of Tamil Nadu.
   The reactors, each capable of generating 1,000 megawatts of
energy, will give India its largest nuclear power plant, an Indian
government official said.
   The project is scheduled for completion in 10 years.

   A new program to bring arts to homeless people
will help them build self-esteem and allow them to express what it's
like to be forced to tolerate the intolerable, sponsors say.
   ``Art is a socially acceptable means of communicating very strong
feelings,'' said Nancy Kirk, associate director of Omaha's
Metropolitan Arts Council.
   ``People who live in shelters need to be able to express very
powerful emotions in a way other than screaming.''
   The council has teamed with a coalition of local groups for the
homeless to provide workshops at seven homeless shelters in Omaha
and one in nearby Council Bluffs, Iowa.
   The experiment includes performances as well as opportunities for
homeless people to paint, sculpt, write and act. Eventually, the
council hopes to organize an exhibit of works by homeless people and
will also use the artworks to brighten the shelters.
   Omaha's homeless population is estimated to vary between 400 and
about 1,000, city officials said.
   When someone first mentioned the idea of arts for the homeless,
members of the council laughed, organizers recalled.
   ``We thought, `What would we do? Have port-o-arts kits? Or
strolling minstrels along the river banks?''' said Eleanor Jones,
the council's program coordinator.
   ``All of us were very naive. We thought the homeless were bums on
river banks,'' she said.
   Susan Ogborn, chairwoman of the Coalition for the Homeless, said
shelter residents have responded enthusiastically to the program,
which held its first performance last month.
   ``We started brain-storming last spring about what it is that
makes for a whole and healthy person,'' Ms. Ogborn said. ``Of
course, we thought of food and shelter and job training, but we also
thought of building self-esteem. A lot of that comes back to the
arts.''
   The Rev. Bob Timberlake, director of Omaha's Open Door Mission,
said the first performance at his shelter, involving a pair of folk
singers, was a great success.
   ``It helps them see beyond the tragedy. The homeless are so
filled with despair and emptiness. This helps to fill the vacuum,''
he said.
   ``It was a real treat,'' said Bruce Smith, 27, a resident of the
mission.
   James Bryant, 23, a Louisiana man who came to Omaha looking for
carpentry work, said the show he saw at the Day House was
``something different for the kind of situation we are in.''
   ``Most of the people here are kind of running short on money and
don't have anyplace they could go to see something like that,'' he
said.
   Critics of the homeless arts program feared it would be a
high-society wine-and-cheese party thrown on behalf of the
disadvantaged, sponsors said.
   ``When it first came out in the media it sounded like we were
trying to raise $50,000 or $60,000 to put on some extravagant arts
project, so there was an understandable backlash,'' Ms. Ogborn said.
Instead of government funds, the program is being run on $4,000
raised so far in private donations.
   Some contributors, Jones said, question the need for arts
programs for people who don't even have food and shelter, but she
has a ready response.
   ``I do feel that everybody has a right to a full-life experience,
even if it is just for one day,'' she said.
   Artists have a special ability to relate to the plight of the
homeless, Jones said.
   ``When you put something down on canvas or sculpt something, it
is you. It is your life and soul. You often are liable to great
criticism,'' she said.
   ``Artists are not in the mainstream of society. They sort of
understand what it is like not to be a mainstream person.''

   A 27-year-old man who police say telephoned
his grandmother in Florida while burglarizing an apartment here was
arrested after authorities traced the phone call.
   Harold Schmidt of Waukesha was arrested last week on charges he
stole cassette tapes, jewelry, and vitamins from the apartment on
April 8. Also taken were chicken patties from a freezer and aspirin,
police said.
   Police earlier interviewed Schmidt about the burglary, but it
wasn't until the victim received her telephone bill several months
later that he was connected to the crime, according to a criminal
complaint.
   Schmidt has since returned two necklaces, a set of earrings, 16
cassette tapes and a solar-powered calculator, the complaint said.
   Schmidt was ordered to appear before Court Commissioner Gerald
Janis on Dec. 5. If convicted, he could be sent to prison for up to
10 years.

<HEAD>U.S. Captain Reassigned After Shells Nearly Hit Japanese Vessel</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The captain of an American destroyer has been
relieved of his command, military officials said Sunday, less than
two weeks after shells fired from the captain's warship reportedly
came close to hitting a Japanese vessel.
   Frederick H. Michaelis Jr., commander of the USS Towers since
1987, was reassigned effective Nov. 19, said Marine Master Gunnery
Sgt. Jake Rodriguez, a military spokesman.
   Rodriguez did not give a reason for the move. He said more
details would be released after a Navy inquiry.
   On Nov. 9, the Towers was holding firing practice about 10 miles
off Boso peninsula east of Tokyo. The destroyer fired 10 rounds of
non-explosive, sand-filled projectiles from its 127mm guns that
landed as close as 330 yards from the Japanese coast guard patrol
boat Uraga, news reports said.
   No injuries or damage were reported, but Japanese authorities
have been demanding Michaelis resign. Michaelis will be assigned
temporarily to Destroyer Squandron 15, Rodriguez said.
   In another incident, clouds of irritating gas from an apparent
explosive device wafted over a residential area near Kadena Air Base
in Okinawa at about midnight Saturday, sending scores of crying,
choking people into the streets, police said.
   The officer, speaking on condition of anonymity, said residents
complained of burning in their eyes and throats after what was
described as a tear gas-like substance hit a neighborhood in
Chatancho after making a loud popping sound.
   Fragments from an apparent explosive device were found in 35
spots around the area neighboring the American base, he added.
   The officer said police were told by U.S. officials that
colorless canisters the size of Coca-Cola cans are used by the air
base during practice, but that they make little noise upon impact,
unlike those that Chatancho residents heard.
   The U.S. military in Japan has suffered a series of accidents
recently that involved the public.
   In October, rifle bullets hit a civilian housing area near a
firing range on Okinawa. Earlier this month, two U.S. Marine
helicopters collided in flight over the island, killing four Marines.
   An editorial in the Asahi Shimbun, Japan's second-largest
newspaper, quoted Okinawa Gov. Junji Nishime as blaming the
accidents there on ``something wanting in the U.S. military's chain
of command or a decline of discipline.''
   About 46,000 U.S. troops are stationed in Japan under the
U.S.-Japan mutual security pact.

<HEAD>Democrats May Ask Congress to Help Change '92 Campaign Calendar</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONALD M. ROTHBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Frustrated Democrats are considering asking
Congress to help change the campaign calendar for the 1992
presidential election, possibly using a lottery to select early
primary states and diminish the pitfalls of Iowa and New Hampshire.
   Among the state party leaders who met here this weekend, there
was little sentiment for a wholesale rewrite of delegate selection
rules as the solution to the Democrats' dismal showing in recent
presidential elections.
   ``I'm going to tell you, everybody's damn tired of rules
changes,'' said Bob Slagle, the Texas state party chairman. ``And I
think the average Democrat thinks we're absolutely insane if we get
into another big battle about rules.''
   Said Slagle: ``They want us to worry about how we're going to win
elections.''
   The one change that has widespread support among party officials
would be to alter the campaign calendar. The principal target would
be Iowa, which traditionally has begun the delegate selection
process.
   To many Democrats, the Iowa caucuses are an exercise in
special-interest politics that pushes candidates into positions that
leave them vulnerable to attack in the general election campaign.
   Having just suffered their fifth defeat in the last six
presidential elections, the Democrats are looking for ways to limit
their vulnerabilities.
   Iowa and New Hampshire each have state laws that automatically
move their caucuses and primary ahead of any other similar events.
   Until now, there has been no serious attempt to force those two
small states to observe timetables set for other states, which Iowa
and New Hampshire have resisted.
   The solution now being debated is a federal law dealing with the
timing of presidential primaries and caucuses.
   Gaining favor among Democrats is the idea of a lottery to
determine the states that would lead off the process.
   Democratic National Chairman Paul G. Kirk Jr., while emphasizing
that he was not endorsing the idea, said he thought there was merit
in studying proposals for holding a lottery one year before the
nominating conventions to choose two or more small states as sites
for the first primaries and caucuses.
   ``The candidates don't know what that state is, so they're not
camping out,'' Kirk said. ``It shortens the calendar.''
   Camping out is exactly that candidates now do in Iowa. The very
day that Kirk was speaking, Jesse Jackson was appearing in Iowa at
the convention of the Iowa Farm Unity Coalition.
   ``Most Iowa Democrats expect there will be a debate about the
Iowa caucuses,'' said Bonnie Campbell, that state's Democratic
chairwoman. ``They are defensive because they like what we do. They
also recognize there is not unanimity of opinion on that.''
   In the end, ``it may well be that nothing happens,'' she said.
``I think if we survive, that will be why.''
   Kirk also said he thought Super Tuesday, the date when most
Southern states hold their primaries together, had not produced the
expected result of boosting a conservative presidential contender,
and probably would be repeated even though it is ``too large and too
dispersed.''
   Super Tuesday's big winner was Jackson and the eventual nominee
was Gov. Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts, who failed to carry a
single Southern state in the general election.
   Also talking about a lottery or some other federal move to
shorten the delegate-selection process was former Arizona Gov. Bruce
Babbitt, a short-lived contender for the Democratic nomination this
year.
   Babbitt said a lottery would prevent candidates from knowing
where the campaign would begin and would force them to address
national rather than parochial issues.
   He blamed the Democrats' string of presidential election defeats
on a lack of understanding of what voters want from a president and
candidates who campaign as if they were running for Congress.
   Babbitt said voters want presidential candidates who offer a
clear vision of where they would take the economy and how they would
handle defense and foreign policy concerns.

   Malcolm Kilduff clearly remembers the
horror and tears on reporters' faces when he told them that
President Kennedy was dead.
   The assistant White House press secretary was on his first trip
as Kennedy's acting spokesman 25 years ago Tuesday when he was
forced to make the statement confirming the nation's worst fears.
   ``President John F. Kennedy died at approximately 1 p.m. Central
Standard Time today here in Dallas,'' the nervous young spokesman
said as news-service reporters dashed for telephones.
   ``He died of a gunshot wound in the brain.''
   Now 60, Kilduff recalled the events of that day from his office
here where he is editor of the weekly Beattyville Enterprise.
   ``I was half crying, with tears in my eyes, because I found it
difficult to say,'' Kilduff said.
   But the reporters who assembled for that briefing at 1:31 p.m. on
Nov. 22, 1963, were not the first to get confirmation of the tragedy
from Kilduff.
   A short time earlier, Kilduff said, he was seeking permission to
make the announcement and walked into the heavily guarded room at
Parkland Memorial Hospital where Lyndon B. and Lady Bird Johnson
were. Kilduff said he wasn't sure how to address the man who was
sitting before him.
   ``I just gave my best shot, and I called him `Mr. President,'''
Kilduff recalled recently. ``And Lady Bird kind of screamed. ... She
realized what I was saying.''
   It was only by chance that Kilduff was the ranking White House
spokesman during Kennedy's tour through Texas. Kennedy's main
spokesman, Press Secretary Pierre Salinger, was with a group of
Cabinet members on an airplane bound from Hawaii to Japan.
   Kilduff can recall each second as he and a group of journalists
heard shots ring out from the sixth floor of the Texas School Book
Depository Building in downtown Dallas at 12:30 p.m. They were in a
press pool vehicle, five cars behind Kennedy.
   ``Someone in the car said, `What was that?''' Kilduff recalled.
``I thought, this is the week before Thanksgiving and they sold
firecrackers. I said, `It sounded to me like a firecracker.'''
   Another shot was fired, and they realized that it wasn't
firecrackers. Reporters fought to use the single radio-telephone in
the car. But until the motorcade arrived at the hospital, no one in
the press car seemed to seriously think Kennedy had been hit, much
less killed, Kilduff said.
   After catching little more than a glimpse of Kennedy and the
blood in the car outside the hospital's emergency entrance, Kilduff
concluded that the wounds might be serious enough that the president
would be hospitalized for some time. He asked an aide to arrange for
a press briefing room.
   ``And it still didn't occur to me that he could be dead,''
Kilduff said. ``It just never occurred to me. I figured that he was
wounded.''
   But moments later, a doctor told Kilduff the president was dead,
and Kilduff went in to speak to Johnson. Fearing a widespread plot
against all top-ranking government officials, Johnson quickly left
the hospital.
   Under orders from the new president, Kilduff withheld the
announcement that Kennedy was dead until Johnson made the short
journey to the airport and was being guarded aboard Air Force One.
   Kilduff stayed at the White House press office until 1965. He
held several media-related jobs before becoming editor of the
Beattyville Enterprise five years ago. Beattyville, a small
community in Appalachian eastern Kentucky, is the hometown of his
wife, Rosemary.
   These days, the biggest announcements that Kilduff handles are
the results each fall of the Lee County Woolly Worm Survey. The
results have received national attention in recent years as a folk
forecast for the coming winter weather.
   ``It's unreal to me that 25 years have gone by,'' Kilduff said.
``You wonder whether you said the right things. You wonder whether
you said enough. You worry about that.''

<HEAD>If Bush Dies Before Electoral Votes Cast, Who Would Become
President?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HARRY F. ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Suppose, just suppose, that after his election
as president two weeks ago, George Bush dies before the Electoral
College meets in December. Who would become president?
   Or suppose that the Electoral College has met, but Bush dies,
resigns or is disqualified before Congress counts the electoral
votes on Jan. 6. Or, after the votes are counted, some dire fate
befalls the president-elect before the Inauguration on Jan. 20.
   Who would become president? Dan Quayle? Don't be too sure.
   The first question is a trick question. No person was elected on
Nov. 8, not even Bush. No matter how the ballot was phrased, votes
were cast for the electors who will choose the president and the
vice president when they meet in their individual states on the
first Monday after the second Wednesday in December.
   This year, that's Dec. 19. By custom and honor, but not because
of any constitutional requirement, the electors usually vote for
their party's nominee. But not always. In 1976, a Gerald Ford
elector in Washington state bolted to Ronald Reagan, and in 1968, a
Richard Nixon elector chose George Wallace.
   ``Until the electors meet, there is no president-elect,'' says
Thomas H. Neale, an analyst in American government for the
non-partisan Congressional Research Service.
   Under Democratic and Republican party rules, if their
presidential or vice presidential candidate dies or resigns between
the nominating conventions and the electors' meetings, their
national committees fill the vacancy.
   In 1912, Vice President James S. Sherman died on Oct. 30, days
before the election in which he sought a second term. Meeting after
the election, the Republican National Committee chose Nicholas M.
Butler to receive the Republican electoral votes for vice president.
No matter, the Republicans lost that year to Woodrow Wilson.
   It is not clear what would happen if the winning candidate dies,
resigns or is disqualified between the time electoral votes are cast
on Dec. 19 and the votes are counted in Congress on Jan. 6.
   ``There is a school of thought that there really is still no
president-elect or vice president-elect until the votes are counted
in Congress,'' says Neale, who is co-author of a report for Congress
on presidential elections.
   ``Some authorities maintain that there is, technically, neither a
president-elect nor a vice president-elect until after the votes are
counted (by Congress) on Jan. 6,'' the report says. The reasoning is
that no living candidate would have received the required majority
of electoral votes.
   But, says the report, ``others suggest that in case of the death
or resignation of the winning candidate, the Jan. 6 congressional
session would declare the vote as cast by the electors.''
   If Quayle should die or resign prior to the congressional count,
the office would either be declared vacant, to be filled by the
president after his inauguration, or the Senate would elect a vice
president from among other candidates who received electors' votes.
Presumably, Lloyd Bentsen would fill the office.
   There is no question what would happen if Bush should die after
Congress has counted the electoral vote but before the Jan. 20
inauguration. Quayle would become president-elect. And, upon taking
the oath, he could then nominate someone to fill the vice
presidential vacancy.
   If Bush and Quayle both should die between vote count and
inauguration, the presidential succession law would be applied. The
House speaker would become president and if his office were vacant,
then the president pro tem of the Senate and on down the Cabinet by
seniority.
   Assuming none of this becomes necessary, the Constitution orders
the electors to send their sealed votes to ``the president of the
Senate (who) shall, in the presence of the Senate and House of
Representatives, open all the certificates and the votes shall be
counted.''
   The president of the Senate and the vice president of the United
States are the same person.
   So if nothing goes wrong, a sitting vice president will be
elected president on Jan. 6, for the first time in 152 years, and
George Bush will have the pleasure of declaring himself the winner.

<DATELINE>DANVILLE, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A fraternity has apologized for a mock
hanging at Centre College that had racial overtones and members said
they are waiting for their punishment.
   ``There is no excuse for our lack of foresight,'' Lee D. Tatum,
president of Centre's Kentucky Alpha-Delta chapter of the Phi Delta
Theta fraternity, said in a statement Friday.
   ``We should have realized how this action would be interpreted,
and we are thoroughly embarrassed by our lack of sensitivity.''
   The 46-member fraternity, which has been on campus since 1850,
also hung a banner of apology outside a dining hall at the center of
campus.
   The mock hanging on Nov. 10 is an annual prank conducted around
Halloween, said Art Jester, director of college relations.
   While about 40 students and fraternity members watched, one
volunteer Phi Delta Theta member was placed in a mountain-climbing
harness attached to a tree by a rope, Jester said.
   The volunteer, whose face was blackened with burned cork, swung
about six feet above ground, without injury. Five people wearing
robes _ four gold and one black _ carried torches during the
15-minute ceremony.
   ``We are painfully aware of the way this incident has been
perceived by a large number of people,'' Tatum said. ``It was in no
way our intention to symbolically represent anything derogatory
toward any person or group of people.''
   Of the 860 students who attend Centre, a private university in
central Kentucky, 10 are black Americans and three are African. The
college has no black instructors.
   Dr. Ray Hammond, vice president and dean of students, will decide
upon the punishment, Jester said. He could not elaborate on what the
punishment would be or when it would take effect.

<HEAD>Evidence From Kennedy Murder Stacked in National Archives Room</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CALLAHAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Stacked on institutional green metal shelves in
a dreary, off-limits nook of the National Archives is virtually
every shred of evidence of the crime of the century, the
assassination of John F. Kennedy.
   Behind a vault door are hundreds of gray cardboard boxes filled
with materials used in two government investigations, from tedious
bureaucratic documents to chilling reminders of that dark day in
Dallas 25 years ago Tuesday.
   There is the 6.5mm, Mannlicher-Carcano bolt-action rifle that Lee
Harvey Oswald bought for $20 through a mail order house. It is still
tagged with a ``commission exhibit'' label from the Warren
Commission's investigation a quarter-century ago.
   There are the three shell casings that Oswald left at his
sixth-floor perch in the Texas School Book Depository overlooking
Dealey Plaza.
   There's the bullet, an incredibly unblemished copper slug, which
the Warren Commission said killed the president and wounded
then-Gov. John Connally of Texas as they rode in the motorcade.
Conspiracy theorists say the bullet, found on a stretcher at
Parkland Memorial Hospital, could not have pierced both Kennedy and
Connally and remained virtually intact.
   There's a piece of Dallas in the collection, a one-foot chunk of
concrete street curb removed from Dealey Plaza because of an early
suspicion that it contained bullet fragments. The curb was found to
contain fragments of lead but not the copper of the kind of bullets
used by Oswald.
   Scattered among reams of FBI and Secret Service reports are
fragments of the lonely life of Oswald, a Marxist who lived in
obscurity and died in infamy and who the Warren Commission concluded
was acting alone when he killed Kennedy.
   There are his academic records from the first grade, FBI
interviews with junior high school classmates, letters to his mother
and his smudged, handwritten diary.
   The Warren Commission, appointed by President Johnson shortly
after the assassination, transferred its estimated 360 cubic feet of
records to the National Archives in late 1964.
   More than 95 percent of those records, along with physical
evidence collected by the FBI and other government investigators, is
available to researchers.
   The House Select Committee on Assassinations also has its
records, another 300 cubic feet of materials, housed in the same
room. Most of the House panel's records have been sealed for 50
years, and a small band of Kennedy researchers have failed in their
tireless efforts to persuade Congress to open them for public
scrutiny.
   In the 1960s and early 1970s, the National Archives was seen as a
gold mine of clues for authors and self-styled sleuths who were
convinced they could unravel the mysteries of the Kennedy
assassination and prove that Oswald was part of a conspiracy.
   Interest in the materials was renewed in 1978 when the House
committee concluded that Kennedy probably was killed as the result
of a conspiracy. The panel's finding that there was more than one
gunman has sparked as much controversy as the Warren Commission's
lone gunman conclusion.
   There is little activity involving the records these days,
according to Marion Johnson, a government archivist for 40 years and
chief overseer of the Kennedy records. He said no authors or
scholars are conducting regular research on the assassination at the
National Archives.
   Some of the Kennedy assassination materials are off-limits.
   The slain president's clothing, including his monogrammed
pinstripe shirt soaked with blood, are available only with special
permission from the Kennedy family.
   The same is true of the 52 black-and-white and color photos of
the autopsy. A set of the graphic photos, made clandestinely at the
time of the autopsy by a Secret Service agent who was one of the few
people who had access to them, have appeared recently in a reprint
of a conspiracy theory book and on a segment of public television's
``Nova'' series that was devoted to the assassination.
   Also available at the archives is the Zapruder film, grainy home
movie taken by a Dallas dress manufacturer Abraham Zapruder that has
provided the best, though far from perfect, video evidence of the
slaying.
   But the film can be reproduced only with the permission of the
Zapruder family, and Zapruder's son, a Washington lawyer, is selling
rights to the film clip to TV producers for up to $30,000. He was
sued last month by researchers who claim the historic film is part
of the public domain.

   Japan will name Vice Foreign Minister Ryohei Murata
its ambassador to the United States shortly after President-elect
George Bush is inaugurated in January, a newspaper reported Sunday.
   A duty officer of the ministry declined comment on the report,
saying officials in charge were not available over the weekend.
   The highly respected Nihon Keizai newspaper said the government
is satisfied with its current ambassador, Nobuo Matsunaga, but wants
to put Murata in the post to ``reconstruct'' its relations with
Washington.
   Murata, 59, became vice foreign minister in June 1987 after
serving as ambassador to Austria and director general of the
ministry's economic bureau.

<HEAD>GOP Senator Says Bush Should Resist `Bum's Rush' On Economy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate Budget Committee's ranking
Republican said Sunday that President-elect George Bush is getting
``the bum's rush'' over the economy and should resist pressure to
fight the federal budget deficit before he takes office in January.
   ``If we start working on this deficit before he's even sworn in,
the highest risk ... is that we're going to get new taxes,'' said
Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M.
   ``The hysteric markets and those who insist on new taxes are
trying to give him (Bush) the bum's rush and panic him into starting
formal kinds of meetings. I don't think he ought to do that,''
Domenici said on NBC-TV's ``Meet the Press.''
   Rep. William Gray, D-Pa., chairman of the House Budget Committee,
said on the same program that Bush needs to take several steps
quickly, including convening a meeting of his administration's
prospective economic advisers and members of Congress.
   On Saturday, Sen. Jim Sasser, D-Tenn., said in the weekly
Democratic radio address that Bush himself should meet with members
of Congress before his Jan. 20 inauguration to search for a common
ground in efforts to reduce the deficit.
   ``I totally disagree this president-elect has to do anything
before he's sworn in,'' Domenici said Sunday. ``In fact, I don't
think he has to do anything very quickly.''
   The senator said he believes Bush will keep his campaign promise
to reject any tax increases, and said he should choose appointees to
the bipartisan National Economic Commission who strongly agree with
that position. Bush is to fill two seats on the commission, created
after last year's stock market crash to recommend ways to lower the
deficit.
   Gray praised Bush for expressing his determination to deal with
the deficit, but said he should go further by appointing other
members of his economic team, fill vacant seats on the deficit
commission, subject his own budget proposals to Congress and have
his economic advisers meet with congressional leaders.
   Gray said Democrats would prefer to reduce the deficit without
raising taxes, but the figures don't add up to enough money for
defense, Social Security, interest on the national debt, education,
the war on drugs and all the other programs Bush supported during
the presidential campaign.

<TEXT>
   Thousands of flag-waving Spaniards held an
anti-government demonstration in downtown Madrid on Sunday to
commemorate the 13th anniversary of the death of Gen. Francisco
Franco.
   The demonstration, led by Carmen Franco Polo, the only daughter
of Franco, was organized by a veterans group that includes men who
fought with Franco against the second Republic during the 1936-39
Spanish Civil War.
   Organizers estimated the crowd at 150,000, but the municipal
police said only 20,000 attended.
   Demonstrators shouted slogans in favor of Franco and his regime
and against the government of socialist Prime Minister Felipe
Gonzalez.
   Giving the fascist salute, the protesters shouted, ``Franco,
Franco, Franco!'' and ``Long live Franco!''
   Irene Fernandez, spokeswoman for the Madrid provincial governor's
office, said the demonstrators dispersed without incident after the
90-minute protest.
   After his forces won the Spanish Civil War, Franco established an
authoritarian regime that ended with his death at age 83 on Nov. 20,
1975.
   Demonstrators placed bouquets of flowers on a statue of Franco in
front of the Transportation Ministry in Madrid. The demonstration
was the only one held in Spain, and many people attended from other
cities.

<HEAD>With AM-Riot Anniversary, Bjt</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Despite the sirens and fire, the drama and the
damage, the takeover of Atlanta's dank, crowded federal prison by
Cuban inmates a year ago caused only a hiccup in a five-year plan to
modernize it.
   Most buildings destroyed or damaged by the 11-day riot already
were scheduled for demolition and replacement.
   An exception was $1.3 million in damage to the prison industries
complex, where inmates made furniture, brooms and mattresses, which
had not been scheduled for replacement. It smoldered for days; parts
were saved, parts will be rebuilt.
   ``(The destruction) didn't save us any money but I don't think it
really cost us much either,'' said associate warden Garland Jeffers.
He said the riot caused a delay of about three weeks in the $63
million project. Work resumed soon after the last of the Cuban
detainees were shipped to other prisons.
   One inmate was killed in the riot, which prison officials now
call ``the November activities.''
   Of the 145 prison guards and other employees taken hostage in
Atlanta and Oakdale, La., 10 still receive workers' compensation for
related psychological problems. A few have left the Bureau of
Prisons but 123 are back at work in the federal prison system, many
in Atlanta.
   Half of the 14 buildings at Oakdale were destroyed and that
facility, opened in 1986 as a short-term holding center for illegal
aliens, remains closed.
   The riot and takeover by the 1,100 inmates started Nov. 23, three
days after the United States announced Cuba would take back many of
the prisoners and two days after a similar takeover at Oakdale.
   The Cubans had arrived in 1980 on the ``Freedom Flotilla''
boatlift and either had criminal records in Cuba or ran afoul of the
law in the United States.
   About 750 regular prisoners are back in the ``Big A,'' as the
prison has been known since shortly after it opened in 1902. The
Cuban detainees have been paroled or are held elsewhere.
   The penitentiary was last modified around 1918 and was one of the
blacker holes in the federal prison system for decades. It is the
oldest and one of the larger federal prisons.
   Outside contractors within the 27-acre prison are building
recreational and vocational facilities and new cell blocks that will
provide more open space but incorporate smaller units, lessening the
chance of another takeover.
   ``The idea is to do away with the claustrophobic feeling, to have
more open areas,'' said Angie Sheffer, executive assistant to Warden
Joseph Petrovsky.
   She said the prison population is smaller than it has been in
years and is made up of lower-security prisoners, primarily
white-collar criminals and drug dealers not considered violent.
   Despite the classrooms, new chapel, recreation and television
rooms, library and other amenities being built, the Big A is still a
prison.
   Rolls of barbed wire drip from the tops of high steel fences.
   Tower guards watch every move and there is always the wall,
finished in 1910.
   A prison fact sheet says the 4,178-foot wall, as much as 37 feet
high, was the largest single concrete structure in the world until
Hoover Dam was built on the Colorado River in the 1930s.

<TEXT>
   The Afghan government said Sunday it
had captured three U.S. spies, and Pakistan claimed it shot down an
Afghan military plane over its territory.
   An official Radio Kabul broadcast monitored in Islamabad said an
Afghan national was imprisoned along with three American spies. The
state-run radio did not say where or when these people were captured.
   A Western diplomat, speaking on the usual condition he not be
identified, dismissed the Radio Kabul report, saying there are no
government officials in Afghanistan.
   The aircraft was shot down near the border town of Parachinar, a
Defense Ministry spokesman said in a statement to the official
Associated Press of Pakistan news agency.
   Pakistan has repeatedly complained of air violations. The latest
report gave scant details. It said the plane was shot down by
``ground fire'' but did not say who was doing the shooting.
   Afghanistan and Pakistan signed a U.N. accord in April providing
for the withdrawal of Soviet soldiers from Afghanistan by Feb. 15.
The Red Army has been in Afghanistan nine years supporting the
Afghan government in its war with guerrillas, who are supported by
Pakistan and the United States.
   Since the accord signing, Pakistan and Afghanistan have been
hurling charges of violations at each other.
   Pakistan's foreign minister, Sahabzada Yaqub Khan, said
Afghan-Soviet aircraft have intruded into Pakistan airspace 104
times since the accord signing. He made these allegations in a
letter sent to the U.N. security council. The news agency published
the text of the letter.
   The letter alleged the violations left 134 people dead.

   One year after Mayor Harold Washington's death,
there is pessimism in the black community that worshiped him and the
strong prospect of another Daley occupying City Hall come next
spring.
   When Washington was stricken by a heart attack Nov. 25, two days
before his 66th birthday, it marked the second time in 11 years that
a powerful Chicago mayor died in office without warning.
   And like the politician he came most to resemble _ ``Boss''
Richard J. Daley, who died in 1976 _ Washington died without
annointing a successor.
   ``Both were so jealous of power,'' said Alderman Larry Bloom, a
staunch Washington ally and one of a handful of announced candidates
for mayor, ``they made sure that nobody, but nobody, was on their
heels.''
   On Monday, the Illinois Supreme Court is scheduled to decide
whether to order a special election next year or allow acting Mayor
Eugene Sawyer to finish Washington's second term and face
re-election in 1991.
   If a lower-court ruling stands, 1989 will be the time and an
already crowded field is expected to swell as both Sawyer and Cook
County State's Attorney Richard M. Daley formally announce their
candidacies.
   The two are favored to meet in the Democratic primary Feb. 28,
although political observers say the 54-year-old Sawyer has the
tougher road to travel. In this strongly Democratic town where no
Republican has been mayor for more than a half-century, the primary
is considered decisive.
   If he wants to avoid a possibly fatal split in the black primary
vote, Sawyer will have to persuade Alderman Tim Evans, who leads him
in the polls, to drop out before the primary. Daley, the 46-year-old
son of the late mayor, is expected to have an easier time persuading
two of his three white rivals to step aside, while Bloom, the third
rival, is not considered much of a factor.
   Ironically, it was Daley who helped put Washington in office as
the city's first black mayor, by splitting the white vote with
then-incumbent Mayor Jane Byrne in the 1983 Democratic primary.
Washington gained a narrow primary victory against Daley and Byrne
before going on to win the general election that year. He then
repeated his win in the spring of 1987.
   Just as in 1983, the primary could be decided next February by
how many black or white candidates remain in the field. And this
time, the more costly struggle is taking place among the black
candidates.
   ``By electing Harold and then re-electing him, we gave ourselves
the impression we had become more sophisiticated politically,'' said
Lu Palmer, an influential local radio commentator and political
activist. ``Now, we are proving we did not.''
   According to a recent poll by the Chicago Sun-Times and WLS-TV,
Evans was supported by 45 percent of black voters, against 16
percent for Sawyer. A third black candidate, Alderman Danny Davis,
managed just 8 percent support. Blacks make up about 40 percent of
the population.
   When Daley is factored in, the same poll shows the late mayor's
son supported by 37 percent of all voters, including 13 percent of
blacks and 53 percent of whites. Evans was second at 22 percent and
Sawyer third with just 10 percent.
   Republicans have yet to name a candidate for the April 4 general
eelction.
   One main reason Sawyer's black support lags is that the City
Council coalition that elected him acting mayor a year ago was made
up largely of anti-Washington white aldermen.
   Evans, who was Washington's floor leader in the council and
claims to be his only heir, argues that Washington would never have
made such an accommodation with his foes.
   ``They have forgotten that everything we got for ourselves, we
got by fighting for it,'' Evans said, ``not because we decided to
unite with our enemy.''
   But Sawyer has amassed a $2 million campaign chest, compared with
less than $100,000 for Evans, and his campaign strategists are
betting an advertising blitz will force Evans out of the Democratic
primary.
   ``I'm in the chair and I'm not a quitter,'' Sawyer said. ``I'm
not going to walk away.''
   Daley, meanwhile, has had the luxury of remaining above the fray,
quietly building a war chest of his own. He has demurred when asked
about a mayoral run, but several Democratic committeemen say he is
simply waiting for Monday's court ruling.
   ``He's told me that he'll run,'' the Sun-Times quoted an
unidentified Daley source as saying. ``And he doesn't care who else
is in the race.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The conservative Heritage Foundation is
recommending that President-elect George Bush give his vice
president, Dan Quayle, a key role in White House dealings with
Congress.
   The proposal was included in the think tank's 937-page ``Mandate
for Leadership III: Policy Strategies for the 1990s,'' which is
expected to be published next month.
   The foundation urged Bush to give new weight to the vice
president's constitutional role as presiding officer of the Senate,
which traditionally has been a ceremonial post except when the vice
president is needed to cast tie-breaking votes in the Senate.
   ``This will inevitably make him a powerful figure in his own
right, but a strong president should welcome the prospect,'' William
J. Gribbin wrote for the foundation.
   Quayle, a 41-year-old Republican senator from Indiana, is an
ardent conservative whose credentials for the vice presidency were
widely questioned during the presidential campaign this fall. Bush
has not yet outlined the assignments he will give his vice president.
   The volume is the third in a series of policy books by the
Heritage Foundation. The first, released shortly after the 1980
election, was considered a blueprint for President Reagan's first
term.
   The chapter of the latest volume on dealings between the White
House and Congress was made available Sunday to The Associated Press.
   Gribbin, a staff member of the Senate Republican Policy
Committee, recommended that Bush, a former House member:
   _Be president of all the people but not try to be a colleague of
all of Congress, where he will have real enemies.
   _Refrain from appearing on network television joking and
backslapping with members of Congress who are hostile to his
policies. If a president signals to the public that his adversaries
are ``regular guys,'' it won't matter who wins.
   _Hire as director of the White House legislative affairs office
someone with sufficient personal prestige who cannot be intimidated
by other advisers. Appoint a deputy director who is respected as
both policy analyst and legislative lobbyist.
   _Quickly solidify his political base in Congress and consolidate
enough support to sustain his legislative vetoes. Issue veto threats
only in the name of the president and not his aides.
   _Give a short, business-like State of the Union speech and let
the public know that the president will not conduct ``politics as
ususal.''
   _Fire anybody who refuses to abide by administration policies.
   _Socialize with members of Congress, not just a key figure or
two, to strengthen his clout on Capitol Hil.

   A pale and seriously ill former paratrooper left
the Soviet Union on Sunday for the United States, where he hopes a
network of support set up by his uncle in Moscow might save his life.
   Alexander Muchnik, 20, of Klaipeda in the Baltic republic of
Lithuania, is suffering from leukemia and his 15-year-old sister,
Viktoria, is the only source of the bone marrow needed for a
transplant that couldn't be performed in the Soviet Union.
   Before boarding a plane for New York on Sunday, the siblings,
their mother and stepfather said good-bye to friends and relatives.
Among them was Alexander's uncle, Ilya, a 50-year-old Moscow
computer scientist who built a network of medical help stretching
from Moscow and Amsterdam to the United States.
   Muchnik, whose pale complexion and sparse moustache give him the
appearance of a young student rather than a veteran of the Soviet
army's paratroop force, said simply, ``We'll see,'' when asked about
his prognosis.
   In the Soviet Union, doctors could only promise him a death
without pain.
   In the United States, the family planned to be united with
Alexander's grandmother, who emigrated years ago and now lives in
Brighton, Mass., and two aunts who live nearby. On Tuesday, Muchnik
has his first appointment with a Boston doctor.
   Ilya Muchnik said so far they have raised only a few thousand
dollars to cover a complicated operation that will cost about
$100,000.
   ``The question about financing the operation remains open,'' he
said. ``I think I have about three weeks. But three weeks, that's
the limit.''
   He said Dr. Dean Buckner, a Seattle specialist who examined
Alexander on a trip to Moscow and has followed the case since,
estimated the operation had an 80 percent chance of success if
performed in the very near future. But he said the chance of success
will fall sharply after that.
   In early October, doctors in Lithuania spotted a deformation of
cells that signaled a severe worsening of Muchnik's condition, his
uncle said.
   When Muchnik fell ill in July, shortly after being released from
the army, his uncle prevailed upon two well-known Soviets,
sociologist Tatyana Zaslavskaya and economist Abel Aganbegyan, to
help him find a place for his nephew in a top Moscow hospital.
   Doctors in the Netherlands analyzed blood samples and determined
that his sister could donate bone marrow.
   A long-time friend of Ilya Muchnik, computer science professor
Semyon Meerkov of Ann Arbor, Mich., found American doctors who took
an interest in the case and started a bank fund in the Michigan city.
   Friends from Canada, the United States, West Germany, Hungary and
Poland sent medicine that is not produced in the Soviet Union.
   U.S. Embassy officials in Moscow processed the necessary visas,
which the family received Nov. 14. The young man and his family are
traveling to the United States as immigrants, a decision spurred by
the illness.
   Muchnik's uncle said the family was held back at first because
Alexander and Viktoria's natural father would not sign waivers
allowing them to leave the Soviet Union, but he consented when told
of his son's illness.

<TEXT>
   Mike Mansfield, who got his first look at Asia
from a troopship as a teen-age serviceman, 66 years later is winding
down a formidable career of public service and strong influence on
U.S.-Asian relations.
   Mansfield told a Tokyo news conference last week he will retire
before the end of the year after a record ll years as U.S.
ambassador to Japan, the country he often describes as the most
important of all in America's future.
   Now 85, the former teen-age runaway, seaman, Marine, miner,
college professor, U.S. representative, senator and ambassador said
his decision to retire was made jointly with his wife, Maureen Hayes
Mansfield.
   By mentioning her, Mansfield was sharing credit for his story of
rags-to-fame and influence in America.
   As a grade school dropout back from service abroad in the Navy
and Marines, Mansfield got a job in the deep copper mines of Butte,
Mont., where, he once recalled, his schoolteacher bride ``put some
sense into me, told me to go to school and make something of
yourself, and I did.''
   The future ambassador was born in New York City of Irish
immigrant parents. His mother died when he was 3 and his father, a
hotel porter, sent him to live with relatives in the rugged Western
state which he represented in the Senate.
   ``I never thought I could get a college education because I left
school _ ran away before I finished the eighth grade _ and joined
the Navy at the age of 14 in the first (World) War'' by lying about
his age, Mansfield once told an interviewer.
   Still working in the mines, he enrolled at Montana School of
Mines and in 1933 at the age of 30 graduated from the University of
Montana. There he became an instructor and later professor of Asian
and Latin American history. Decades later, as ambassador, he liked
to tell Japanese he was once a professor. Montana U's main library
is now the Maureen and Mike Mansfield Center.
   Miners, teachers and Montana trade unions provided the Democratic
Party political base that sent Mansfield to Congress for 34 years,
the last 16 as Senate Democratic leader. As a freshman congressman
in 1944, he was included in a presidential mission to China. At the
end of the war, he was among lawmakers advising retention of the
emperor in Japan.
   Retiring from Congress in 1976, Mansfield returned from a
monthlong visit to China urging America to accept the ``reality'' of
communist rule. Mansfield argued that Beijing factions pushing
revival of the Soviet-Chinese alliance would grow stronger unless
the United States normalized relations with the mainland, even at a
cost of breaking official ties with Taiwan.
   Two years later, the United States took those steps.
   Mansfield earned a reputation in the Senate as a master of gentle
persuasion and compromise while criticizing U.S. participation in
the Vietnam War and scolding Secretary of State Henry Kissinger in a
soft-spoken style that became Mansfield's trademark. He is
remembered for informal Saturday morning gatherings open to any
reporters who cared to drop into his office in the Capitol.
   After President Jimmy Carter named him ambassador to Japan, Sen.
Robert Byrd, Mansfield's successor as Senate majority leader, joked
that Mansfield in Tokyo would turn the tables and ``give our friends
in the East the opportunity to study an inscrutable American.''
   Concerned by growing trade friction, Mansfield soon after
arrival, made the oft-repeated statement that the U.S.-Japanese
bilateral relationship is the most important in the world, ``bar
none,'' and that the collision course of the 1930s must be avoided
at all costs. The U.S.-Japan security alliance prompted him to liken
Japan and America to copper miners working underground in pairs,
each responsible for his partner's life.
   Mansfield tried to explain Japanese sensitivities and
complexities to American visitors, and to urge U.S. business to
compete more aggressively and seek long-term rather than instant
profits in Japan.
   This promoted some American critics to say Mansfield was too
conciliatory. But defenders said that to the Japanese he was always
plainspoken and made it clear they were certain to trigger U.S.
protectionism unless they opened markets and dismantled trade
barriers. Portraits of congressional leaders adorned Mansfield's
Tokyo office as a reminder of who wielded much of the power in
Washington.
   The U.S. trade deficit with Japan ballooned during most years of
Mansfield's ambassadorship but newly elected President Reagan's 1981
decision to keep the former Democratic senator in Tokyo was widely
applauded as an effort to depoliticize the issue.
   Protectionist pressure came from Democrats and Reagan apparently
felt it ``very useful to keep a Democrat in Tokyo who was close to
his policy line and enormously respected in Japan,'' said Dr. Martin
E. Weinstein, director of Japan programs at Washington's Center for
Strategic and International Studies, a private nonpartisan research
organization. ``I think Mansfield has done an excellent job and
clearly hasn't given into Japan-bashing at times when it was
fashionable.''
   In 1977, Mansfield's first year as ambassador, the U.S. worldwide
trade deficit was 25 billion dollars, 6 billion of it with Japan.
More than a decade later, the last annual figures were 170 billion
worldwide and 57 billion with Japan.

   An orangutan that escaped from a display
enclosure at the San Diego Zoo earlier this month was put back on
display and immediately made its fifth escape, a spokeswoman said.
   The 11-year-old, 100-pound female named Kumang was released into
the exhibit for the first time since its Nov. 7 escape and by about
9:25 a.m. Saturday had gotten out, said zoo spokeswoman Georgeanne
Irvine.
   The orangutan made its way atop an aviary as visitors who had
entered the zoo since the 9 a.m. opening were cleared from the area.
   When Kumang came down to a low level, zoo workers hit her with a
tranquilizer dart and ended her bid for freedom at 10:15 a.m., Ms.
Irvine said.
   Unharmed by the tranquilizer, Kumang was returned to the
orangutan sleeping area, which is separate from the display
enclosure.
   ``I'm afraid she's gonna have to stay there till we figure out
our next step,'' Ms. Irvine said. ``She's quite a clever orangutan.''
   Kumang first escaped in August 1987 using a mop handle left in
the enclosure and got free twice since June.

   Bangladesh and India agreed Sunday to
update their flood warning systems and seek ways to prevent
devastating floods like the ones that killed more than 1,000 people
in the summer.
   ``Although this is a problem of Bangladesh, India is trying to
help the situation for common benefit,'' Indian Water Resources
Secretary Naresh Chandra told reporters after the first meeting of
the Indo-Bangladesh Task Force.
   Bangladesh's mightiest, most flood-prone rivers start in India
and Nepal.
   Floods are a recurring problem in Bangladesh, a low-lying nation
of river deltas, but this year's were the worst in memory. About
three-fourths of the country was covered by water up to 16 feet deep.
   The task force, established Sept. 19, is to meet in New Delhi
next month.

   Hall of Fame pitcher Carl Hubbell was in
critical condition Sunday after his car struck a metal pole,
authorities said.
   Hubbell, 85, apparently suffered a heart attack or stroke that
caused him to lose control of the vehicle Saturday, police said.
Hubbell, who suffered a heart attack in 1977, was taken to
Scottsdale Memorial Hospital-Osborn.
   The left-hander, who lives about one mile from the accident
scene, won 253 games for the New York Giants from 1928 to 1943. He
struck out Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Jimmy Foxx, Al Simmons and Joe
Cronin in succession during the 1934 All-Star Game. All five are in
the Hall of Fame, which admitted Hubbell in 1947.
   Hubbell was known as ``King Carl'' and ``The Meal Ticket'' and
was famous for his screwball.

   Model Paulina Porizkova, who recently signed a
reported $5 million to $6 million contract with Estee Lauder, says
she dislikes modeling and only does it for the money, but she admits
worrying about aging.
   Porizkova, 23, also said she ``eats like a horse'' and during a
recent breakfast interview consumed a doughnut, coffee cake,
buttered toast and coffee with cream.
   ``Beauty can get a woman what she wants: love and money. But when
beauty leaves you, so can the things it brought,'' she said. ``I'm
not thrilled about getting older. But I'm already facing up to the
irreversibility of the aging process.''
   Porizkova said she's learned to ``sew great curtains, paint,
build dollhouses, act and write.'' Her boyfriend, Ric Ocasek of the
rock group The Cars, ``thinks I lost my true calling to be a
librarian. I'm always reading.''
   ``You always think your last job is your last job,'' she said of
modeling. ``Then they turn their backs on you and say you don't look
good anymore, that you're getting older. They assume you're deaf,
they you don't have ears to hear. They tear you apart, detail by
detail. It's very cruel.''

   Lisa Marie Presley, the daughter of Elvis
Presley, says her life has come together after a period in which she
dropped out of high school and experimented wiht drugs.
   ``I have a life of my own now and a man I want to share it
with,'' Presley said in the December edition of Life magazine.
   Presley said her father's drug use ``never changed my love for my
dad,'' and she described her own drug use as part of her
``rebellious stage.''
   ``I have to learn things by myself. I learned my lesson, and I
won't go near drugs again,'' she said.
   Presley dropped out of school in the eleventh grade. ``Even after
I quit doing drugs, I never went back. I regret it now,'' she said,
adding that she plans to take correspondence courses.
   Presley, 20, and musician Danny Keough, 23, were married in
October and are expecting their first child.
   Priscilla Presley said her daughter has turned out to be ``a

   Novelist Jeffrey Archer, who won record libel
damages against a London newspaper, says he is writing a satirical
play about how journalists battle for stories.
   ``Exclusive'' will open in London's West End next September,
Archer said Sunday.
   The play is set in Wapping, the east London district where many
Fleet Street newspapers have relocated, Archer said. It covers one
week in the life of a fictious tabloid, The Daily Chronicle,
following eight news stories through the eyes of 16 characters.
   Archer said the play does not seek revenge for newspaper
allegations he had a sexual liaison with a prostitute. A jury in
1987 awarded him about $800,000, the biggest libel award in British
history.
   ``My new play is just a witty, cheeky and irreverent Fleet Street
satire,'' Archer said.
   ``Absolutely not one line in it is for revenge. ... The trial was
18 months ago. It took me about a week to get over it. Now I just
don't give it a minute's thought.''
   Archer's best-selling novels about power and intrigue include
``Kane and Abel'' and ``First Among Equals.''

   ABC correspondent Sam Donaldson on Saturday
said George Bush will probably keep the news media at arm's length
the way President Reagan does.
   ``The presidency is closed down,'' Donaldson told a meeting of
journalists here, referring to Reagan's habit of barring or limiting
access to the presidency.
   Donaldson warned that the Bush administration probably will
continue ``the sequestering of the president from the press.''
   The ABC White House correspondent, who soon will leave that post
to host his own news program for the network, spoke at the national
convention of the Society of Professional Journalists, Sigma Delta
Chi.
   Donaldson has become known for asking tough questions and for
shouting them at Reagan when the president is boarding his
helicopter. Such tactics have drawn attacks from Reagan supporters
and criticism from other news people.
   But Donaldson said that presidents have set the rules for
journalists.
   ``Don't shoot at (the correspondents) because they're trying to
get access,'' he said. ``It's the presidents who've made it into
theater.''

   A British archaeological expedition has
found the remains of an ancient Assyrian city in the Jazira region
near the Syrian border, its director said Sunday.
   Warwick Ball said the main discovery was a ziggurat, a temple
built in the shape of a terraced pyramid.
   The team unearthed clay tablets relating the 247-acre site to the
Assyrian city of Telluleh.
   ``It is rather a small city but the find is exciting,'' Ball
said. He said the site was inhabited as long as 6,000 years ago.
   At its height in the 7th century B.C., the Assyrian Empire
stretched from Egypt across Mesopotamia to the shores of the Persian
Gulf. Its rulers were known as fierce military commanders and
efficient administrators.

   Thousands of ethnic Albanians marched
in a blizzard through this provincial capital on Sunday in defiance
of government orders to end a wave of ethnic unrest and street
demonstrations.
   The demonstrations in the southern province of Kosovo are the
biggest there since World War II.
   Sunday's protests, the fourth straight day of unrest since the
forced resignation of two ethnic Albanian leaders, started when
about 500 chanting students braved the snow to march on the
headquarters of Kosovo's Communist Party.
   Waving Yugoslav flags and ethnic Albanian emblems, the crowd
swelled to about 4,000 within two hours, roaming city streets and
gathering outside a student canteen and party headquarters.
   The crowd first ignored an order by security forces to disperse,
but the demonstrators later began leaving the city center and it was
quiet by 8 p.m.
   Up to 100,000 people marched from dawn until midnight Saturday to
protest Thursday's resignations of Azem Vlasi and Kacusa Jasari,
members of Kosovo's 13-member ruling Politburo.
   Police blocked roads into Pristina late Saturday to prevent more
protesters from joining the boisterous crowds that demonstrated
almost continously since Vlasi and Jasari resigned.
   Snow fell through the night, driving chanting columns of
protesters off the streets, and increased police patrols appeared on
the streets Sunday.
   The province's acting Communist Party head, Remzi Koljgeci, tried
to defuse the tension by announcing Saturday night that the
resignations might be reviewed and reversed. But he also warned that
``extraordinary measures of security'' could be introduced if
demonstrations continued.
   ``In the past three days, we went through a situation which we
could not control,'' he said in a television interview Sunday
morning.
   Slobodan Milosevic, the Communist Party chief of the republic of
Serbia, which controls Kosovo, put what Vlasi called ``terrific
political pressures'' on him and Jasari to resign as part of his
campaign for more control over the autonomous province.
   Kosovo, which is dominated by an ethnic Albanian population, is
the heartland of Serbia's medieval empire. The Slav minority,
composed of 200,000 Serbs and Montenegrins, alleges it is being
harassed by the 90 percent Albanian population.
   On Saturday, Milosevic was honored by hundreds of thousands of
Serbs at a rally in Belgrade, the capital of both Yugoslavia and
Serbia. The Belgrade Communist Party daily Politika said the
demonstration was the largest in Yugoslavia's postwar history.
   Milosevic's supporters claimed 1.3 million people attended the
rally to express solidarity with Milosevic and the Slavs in Kosovo.
The Communist Party daily Vjesnik suggested 600,000 people ``would
be closer to reality'' as the number who attended the rally.
   In his speech, Milosevic vowed the Serbs would not stop until
their battle for Kosovo is won.
   Milosevic has antagonized non-Serb Communist leaders with his
campaign, which they fear may only be the first step toward
increasing the already powerful role of Serbia, Yugoslavia's largest
republic, in federal affairs.
   After the Belgrade rally, Milosevic and Koljgeci spoke by
telephone and agreed on undisclosed measures to calm the situation
in Kosovo, the official Tanjug news agency reported.
   The demonstrations in Kosovo were the largest there since the
communists came to power after World War II.
   Provincial leaders warned at a meeting Saturday night that, while
they hoped to control the situation Sunday, they feared more unrest
when workers return to work on Monday.
   Television reports said two or three demonstrators were briefly
detained Saturday for reportedly chanting demands that Kosovo become
a full-fledged republic. The country is made up of six republics and
Serbia's two provinces of Kosovo and Vojvodina.
   An estimated 500 ethnic Albanians are in jail on charges of
spreading counterrevolution by allegedly demanding independence from
Serbia.
   One ethnic Albanian student was heard shouting Saturday, ``What
are we waiting for when our people are rotting in jail?''
   The simmering ethnic strife in Kosovo, a backward region
bordering communist Albania, heated up over the summer when Serbs
staged a series of mass rallies to back Milosevic's campaign for
more control over Kosovo.
   Kosovo won broad autonomy under the 1974 constitution. Milosevic
wants that changed to restore Serbian control over education, the
judiciary and security in the province.

<HEAD>Boy Scouts Usher In Holiday Season By Collecting Food For Poor</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of Boy Scouts around the nation went out during the
weekend to pick up tons of donated food for the poor, neatly
packaged in bags the youths distributed the week before.
   In Utah alone, more than 100,000 Boy Scouts estimated they
collected more than a million pounds of nonperishable food as part
of the nationwide Scouting for Food drive.
   ``As far as I know, this is the most comprehensive request for
food and response since World War II,'' said Carl Whiting, an
executive of the Hawkeye Area Boy Scout Council in eastern Iowa. He
said early collection totals in the seven-county area far surpassed
predictions of 450,000 cans. ``We collected that in Cedar Rapids
alone,'' he said.
   Officials of Boy Scouts of America said some 4 million Boy Scouts
joined in the project, and the organization hoped to collect more
than 100 million food items.
   The Scouts organization estimated that more than 20 million
Americans, including 4 million children, go hungry at some time
every month, said Carlos Santiago, associate director of the Scouts
for New Jersey's Ocean and Monmouth counties. He said Scouts in his
region alone might collect more than 10 million cans of food.
   In Utah, only the Great Salt Lake Council participated in the
food drive last year and collected 129,136 food items, roughly 60
tons. This year, all four Boy Scout Councils in the state
participated.
   ``We are extremely pleased with the results and we are deeply
appreciative of the cooperation of people in our community,'' said
Larry Lunt, chairman of the drive for the Great Salt Lake Council.
   ``It is especially timely to have this program take place just
before Thanksgiving,'' said Richard Winters, head of the Salt Lake
Food Bank. An estimated 175,000 Utahns received food through various
food banks and pantries last year.
   In six counties of central Florida, Scouts collected 120,000 bags
of canned and boxed food Saturday from 200,000 homes at which they
left the bags, and Scout officials said that was enough to feed
64,000 people.
   Some 9,000 Scouts and volunteers collected 250,000 cans of food
in New Hampshire.
   ``We had no idea what we would get here and a qaurter of a
million cans is one heck of a good start,'' said Ron Titus of the
Daniel Webster Council in New Hampshire.

<TEXT>
   King Hussein said Sunday the PLO has met
American conditions for a place in Arab-Israeli peace talks and
suggested Israel and the United States were blocking peace.
   Hussein made the comments in an interview on CBS television's
``Face the Nation.'' The program was screened on state-run
television in Jordan, which shares Israel's longest border.
   ``I believe the PLO has gone as far as it was asked to go and has
contributed its share for progress toward a just and comprehensive
peace,'' the king said.
   Israel for years has pinned its peace hopes on a separate deal
with Hussein, cutting out the Palestine Liberation Organization. But
Hussein insists that the PLO take part in any Middle East settlement.
   The PLO's policy-setting Palestine National Council last week
endorsed U.N. Security Council resolutions 242 and 338, implying
recognition of Israel's right to exist.
   It also endorsed the Cairo Declaration, which calls for an end to
21 years of worldwide Israeli-PLO underground warfare and restricts
guerrilla operations to military targets in Israel and the occupied
territories.
   Israel officially rejected the council's move, saying the
organization has not explicitly recognized Israel nor renounced
terrorism. The United States also had refused to deal with the PLO
until it renounced terrorism.
   ``I believe they have denounced terrorism time and again,''
Hussein said. ``I believe that if there is any intransigence _ and
there is indeed _ it is in the Israeli position, which hasn't
changed, and up to now the United States' position.
   ``I believe our friends in Washington had better go back and look
at the papers and positions they adopted and they will find there is
no difference between their initial demands and requests and
suggestions and what the PLO has come through with now.''
   U.S. officials have reacted cautiously to the PLO declarations.
   Resolution 242, adopted in 1967, called for an Israeli withdrawal
from the territories it captured in that year's Arab-Israeli war _
the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Resolution 338, passed in 1973, called for implementation of the
earlier resolution and negotiations for ``a just and durable peace
in the Middle East.''
   Asked why PLO chief Yasser Arafat would not explicitly endorse
Israel's right to exist, Hussein said, ``they have accepted 242,
which speaks of the right of all states in the area to live in peace
and security. Beyond that, I don't see what could be asked of the
PLO at this date.''
   Hussein said there would be ``no hope for peace'' if Israel's
hard-line Likud faction holds to its demands that Israel maintain
all of the territory captured from the Arabs in 1967 _ land the
Arabs hope to trade in return for peace.
   The Likud bloc has been asked to form a new Israeli government
following Nov. 1 elections and is trying to forge a coalition
government.
   ``If Likud holds onto the policies that it declared before ...
then there is no hope for peace,'' Hussein said. ``But on the other
hand, if they're speaking of 242 ... in other words territories
occupied in June of 1967, then that is an entirely different
situation.
   Hussein disputed U.S. President-elect George Bush's claim that a
Palestinian state would be a threat to Jordan.
   ``I see no threat in any form or way,'' said the monarch, who has
guided the often-imperiled kingdom since 1953.
   Hussein's prime minister, Zaid Rifai, said earlier Sunday that
``the biggest challenge'' facing Bush in the Middle East ``is going
to be how to face Israel's instransigence and refusal to recognize
the basic, essential ingredients for a peaceful resolution of this
conflict.''
   Rifai, in an interview with The Associated Press, said Jordan was
prepared to grant diplomatic relations to the new Palestinian state.
   In July, Jordan renounced sovereignty over the Israeli-occupied
West Bank.

<HEAD>Americans Urge OPEC Ministers to Reach Agreement, Boost Prices</HEAD>

<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Representatives of the United States'
energy-producing states urged OPEC on Sunday to reach a new
production accord so crude prices can rise and help their states'
ailing economies.
   ``We're fighting for our lives,'' J.E. Jumonville Jr., a
Democratic state senator from Ventress, La., told a news conference.
``It's a major part of our economic survival.''
   Ministers of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
tried in a third day of closed-door talks to resolve a dispute
between Iraq and Iran that has been delaying work on a new
production agreement.
   The accord would limit the amount of oil each of the 13 OPEC
countries could produce in an attempt to limit breakneck production
that has caused a glut and sent prices downward.
   Oil Minister Rilwanu Lukman of Nigeria, the cartel's president,
said a proposal was on the table, but he gave no details.
   ``The discussions are continuing,'' said Sheikh Ali Khalifa
Sabah, the Kuwaiti oil minister. ``We are here to find a solution.''
   The negotiations preceded Monday's start of the cartel's winter
meeting.
   Jumonville and other representatives of U.S. energy-producing
states met with OPEC members to appeal for price stability.
   The 12-member delegation represents the South-West Energy Council
and the Interstate Oil Compact Commission. Members of the delegation
are from Louisiana, Arkansas, Texas, Oklahoma and Alaska.
   Texas Railroad Commissioner Kent Hance told reporters he wanted
to have ``a dialogue with people that have more say on the Texas
economy than anything that's decided in our state capital or our
national capital.''
   The plunge in prices in 1986 badly damaged the economies of U.S.
oil states. There is concern a recent fall in prices could lead to
another downturn.
   ``We feel that our economy in Texas is starting to turn around,
but if oil prices went to single-digit numbers, it would stop us
from having a turnaround,'' he said.
   The officials said if prices rose to $18-$20 a barrel, it would
help their economies.
   ``It wouldn't be a boom for us, but it would allow us to
survive,'' Hance said.
   The December contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark
grade of U.S. crude oil, settled at $13.60 a barrel on Friday.
   OPEC maintains a benchmark price of $18 a barrel, although Arab
crudes have been running about $10 a barrel.
   The recent weakness in prices has been blamed partly OPEC
production that has surged to its highest monthly level in five
years.
   The current output accord, worked out in 1986, sets total OPEC
output at about 15 million barrels a day. But total cartel
production in October was estimated by the International Energy
Agency at nearly 21.1 million barrels.
   The accord covers only 12 members because Iraq refused the daily
quota of 1.5 million it was assigned, insisting that it be raised to
the 2.4 million given its bitter enemy, Iran.
   Since the two countries agreed to an August cease-fire in their
8-year-old war, efforts have been made to return Iraq to the quota
system.
   Formal talks between the two OPEC committees _ price evolution
and long-term strategy _ began Thursday.
   Cartel members are Algeria, Ecuador, Gabon, Indonesia, Iran,
Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, United Arab
Emirates and Venezuela.

   President Reagan says he plans to say hello.
So do Douglas Fairbanks Jr., Itzhak Perlman, Jimmy Carter and George
Bush.
   They are among the hundreds of world leaders, entertainers and
others who agreed to do their part Monday to promote the 16th annual
World Hello Day by greeting 10 strangers with a pleasant ``hello.''
   The tradition began in 1973 when two Omaha brothers got the idea
they wanted to do something to encourage world peace.
   ``World Hello Day is a unique opportunity for people to do
something personal, memorable and enjoyable for the advancement of
peace,'' said Michael McCormack, 36.
   ``The attention we are getting shows what just one day like this
can do to transcend all the geo-political divisions that exist in
the world,'' he said in an interview Sunday.
   The brothers received an express letter from the White House on
Thursday with a ``warm hello'' from President Reagan.
   ``In reaching out to others in friendship, you spread the spirit
that is the foundation for peace within the home, the community, the
nation and the world,'' Reagan said.
   The Rev. Jesse Jackson wrote that the brothers ``represent the
essence and the spirit of peace because you personally took the
initiative to do something in the name of peace.''
   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis said a simple ``hello'' has
the power to span generations and traverse the globe. He cited a
favorite Chinese proverb _ ``A journey of a thousand miles begins
with a single step.''
   ``World Hello Day may well be the first step on a journey that
leads to peace on our planet,'' the former presidential candidate
said in a letter to the brothers.
   Past participants included Mother Teresa, Bishop Desmond Tutu,
Lech Walesa, Anwar Sadat, Oscar Arias, Prince Charles, Indira
Gandhi, Pope John Paul II, Luciano Pavarotti, Lee Iacocca, Charlton
Heston, Stevie Wonder and Arnold Palmer.
   Tass, the Soviet Union's official news agency, conducted two
telephone interviews with McCormack and his brother, Brian, 31.
   ``I was stunned for about 15 minutes after those two calls,'' he
said.
   ``Also, with official letters from Zaire and the Yemen Arab
Republic, the number of governments who have contacted us with
letters of support has risen to 101,'' he said.
   Everyone is encouraged to participate, McCormack said.
   ``Participating in World Hello Day is a symbolic action, which
celebrates the contributions made by personal communication to the
resolution of conflicts and the preservation of peace,'' he said in
a promotional flier.
   McCormack said he came up with the idea while attending Harvard
University in response to rising global tensions. The first year,
representatives of 15 countries wrote back to him saying they had
participated.
   ``We certainly hoped it would be successful but the magnitude has
surprised us,'' he said.
   McCormack has worked full-time recently on promoting the
observance.
   ``I just decided to save up some money and do the best job I
could this year on World Hello Day. We're not quite like Gandhi, but
we're not rich folks. We've spent several thousand dollars on this.
I do it full-time _ night and day since June,'' he said.
   McCormack said accounts of Monday's ``hellos'' are to be
broadcast by the BBC, Radio Netherlands, China News Service,
Hungarian News Agency and State Publishing House of Mongolia.
   ``To see this happening around the world is just amazing,'' he
said.

   The former mayor of Crabb no longer has to
worry about incorporation referendums or road repairs. His first
priority now is just to finish high school.
   ``I'm taking one day at a time,'' said Brian Zimmerman, 16. ``I
haven't made my mind up about whether to go to college or what to
study. I've been having too much fun living.''
   Zimmerman was elected mayor at age 11 in this uncorporated town
southwest of Houston, serving two terms after defeating two adults
in the race. His parents said he got the idea after he couldn't find
Crabb on a map.
   ``My main idea was that incorporation was an advantageous move
and the people here needed someone to lead the fight to keep cities
from annexing Crabb,'' Zimmerman said.
   The young mayor put money from his savings account into the fight
to get an incorporation referendum on the ballot. He did get it on
the ballot, but the final vote went against incorporating.
   ``The mayor's office ended with that vote,'' he said.
   For now, Brian's primary goal is ``to do as good as I can in high
school.'' He's also enjoying his political retirement with extra
time for hunting, fishing, bowling and dating.
   But he's still no ordinary 16-year-old.
   He's expanded what began as a summer business cooking barbecue on
a pit in the parking lot of his grandmother's grocery store. ``Brian
Burgers'' now operates out of a bright red trailer complete with a
grill and sink, framed business licenses and health department
permits.

   There's a gnawing problem in Chagrin
Falls. A family of beavers has moved into the fashionable Cleveland
suburb, much to the chagrin of residents.
   ``This is the worst year we've had with them,'' said Robert
McKay, village administrator. ``They've done a number on a lot of
trees.''
   The beavers apparently have multiplied in recent years and have
moved downstream in the Chagrin River to popular Riverside Park.
   Small trees at the back of the park were the first to go about
three months ago, McKay said. Then, the beavers started moving
farther into the park, biting chunks out of ornamental cherry and
other trees.
   ``They started chewing all the trees in the park,'' said Mayor B.
Richard Bodwell, estimating the cost of the damaged trees at $3,000
or more.
   Several residents are concerned about more than the trees,
fearing that children or pets in the park could be injured,
officials said. But they say that the animals are natuarally timid,
and will flee when approached.
   ``At night when people walk through the park, they find
themselves face to face with Bucky Beaver,'' Bodwell said.
   A trapper has been helping village employees catch beavers and
take them to lakes and rivers out in the country.

   A woman trying to find the source of a strange
odor in her house opened a closet door and found the body of her
18-year-old son, who was last seen on Halloween, police said Sunday.
   Joseph Gooch had alcohol problems and had been treated
periodically for mental problems, said Detective Nick Gaudio.
   An autopsy was being performed to determine how long the man had
been dead and how he died, Gaudio said.
   Patricia Gooch, 59, told police her son might have been using
drugs.
   ``We have no reason to suspect that he has been killed,'' Gaudio
said, noting that Gooch ``was known to hide in various places in the
house.''

<HEAD>Juror Marries Man She Helped Convict, Wants Decision Overturned</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman who married a man she earlier helped
convict of murder, kidnapping and rape has asked the state Court of
Appeal to overturn the conviction because of alleged coercion by
fellow jurors.
   Steven Erickson, 34, was convicted in March 1987 of the February
1984 abduction, rape and shooting death of a 26-year-old woman.
   Gwendolyn Wix, 41, was a juror during Erickson's six-month murder
trial.
   Erickson was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility
of parole, primarily because of Ms. Wix's resistance to the death
penalty.
   In March, Ms. Wix filed a seven-page declaration alleging
impropriety on the part of her fellow jurors.
   She didn't mention her marriage in the affidavit and the attorney
general's office wrote last month that her marriage to Erickson
tarnished her credibility.
   Deputy District Attorney Michael Knight, who prosecuted Erickson,
said he once tried to have Ms. Wix removed as a juror after learning
that she contacted the defense attorney in the case. That effort was
denied by the judge.
   ``This is stranger than fiction,'' Knight said. ``She apparently
fell in love with the guy during the trial. I've seen some jurors
becomed enamored of the guy, but I've never seen where they've
actually gone and met the guy and married him.''
   Knight said he planned to investigate how the couple got together
and determine whether Ms. Wix acted improperly during the trial.
   Jurors who worked with Ms. Wix said they agreed to a penalty
other than death at her insistence to avoid deadlocking 11-1 and
possibly having the case retried, jury foreman Harry Godley said
Friday.
   Referring to her marriage, Godley said: ``I'm completely
flabbergasted. I'd like to know how their relationship developed.''
   Ms. Wix said fellow jurors were biased against Erickson, verbally
abused her and pressured her to side with them. She said they
refused to listen to her arguments.
   Godley denies Ms. Wix was coerced. ``You have no idea the way
everybody bent over backward to try to reason with her,'' he said.
   The attorney general's office said there was no evidence that Ms.
Wix's fellow jurors acted improperly.

<HEAD>Historians Seek Clues From Sunken Ship in Lake Michigan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EVANSTON, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Historians are hoping to learn more about
the glory days of Great Lakes shipping from a well-preserved wreck
that sank more than a century ago and was discovered recently in
Lake Michigan.
   Two divers found the 200-foot wooden schooner Wells Burt over the
summer, said Kurt Anderson, a board member of the Chicago Maritime
Society, which wants to help recover artifacts to learn more about
shipboard life.
   The divers have decided to keep the ship's location secret for
now to prevent it from being plundered by artifact hunters, Anderson
said.
   Ship traffic was heavy on the Great Lakes in the 1800s and many
of them sank during storms, he said.
   The Wells Burt sank in 1883 off Evanston, a suburb north of
Chicago, while heading to Chicago with a load of coal, he said. Its
11 crewmen died. The ship may have been coming from Buffalo.
   The wreck is under nearly 50 feet of water and is resting next to
a rock ridge that protects it from currents, Anderson said. The
ship's deckhouses and masts were ripped off in a storm that sank the
vessel.
   Anderson said he has seen a videotape of the wreck and it is in
good shape.
   ``The deck is pretty much in place and there's a lot of things
that are still on board,'' he said. ``Hopefully the crew's quarters
are still intact so we can look into shipboard life,'' he said.
``We'd like to find personal effects of the people who were sailing
on her.''
   While shipping on the Great Lakes in the 19th century was a major
industry, little is known about sailors' lives aboard merchant
ships, he said.
   ``We want to put together an exhibit about the ship and its
times,'' Anderson said.
   The first step is mapping and charting the wreck to find where
everything is and then recovering artifacts, he said.

<HEAD>Lawmaker Says Estonians Used Pressure To Pass Amendment</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK J. PORUBCANSKY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Estonian activists put undue pressure on their
legislators and resorted to threats to win approval for a challenge
to the Kremlin's authority over their Baltic republic, an Estonian
lawmaker was quoted as saying Sunday.
   In an interview with the Communist Party daily, Vasily Koltakov,
an ethnic Russian and one of seven deputies to vote against the
measure Wednesday, portrayed the unprecedented action as excessive
and dangerous to ethnic relations.
   The Estonian Supreme Soviet, or parliament, approved an amendment
to the republic's constitution requiring that any new Soviet laws be
approved by local authorities. They also passed a ``declaration of
sovereignty'' in all areas except foreign affairs and defense.
   Koltakov, a factory worker, told Pravda that ``on the eve of the
session there was an overt `coaching' of deputies.''
   Koltakov said the People's Front, the Estonian organization that
sponsored the amendment, advised him to ``abstain from voting when
they learned about my stand.
   ``Moreover, as one of the women deputies told me, unidentified
persons telephoned her on the eve of the session and uttered threats
to make her cast an `aye' vote.''
   Felix Undusk, a spokesman for the People's Front, said the Pravda
interview was read in Estonian on the republic's official radio on
Sunday.
   ``That's propaganda pressure,'' Undusk said in a telephone
interview from Tallinn, the Estonian capital. ``I can't say there
was any such strong pressure.''
   A Soviet parliamentary committee ruled Saturday that the Estonian
action was at odds with the national constitution. On the same day,
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said during his visit to India that
``what is happening in Estonia is perestroika,'' his program of
social and economic reforms.
   In the Pravda interview, Koltakov said the People's Front was
taking Gorbachev's reforms too far.
   Some members of the organization openly have called for a halt to
emigration of other ethnic groups into Estonia or even repatriation
to their home areas.
   According to the last census, 61 percent of Estonia's 1.5 million
people are ethnic Estonian, and 28 percent are Russian.
   ``Hundreds of thousands of people of non-indigenous nationalities
have come to feel like `lodgers' unwelcome to the hosts,'' Koltakov
said.
   But Undusk said the People's Front, which has gained thousands of
members and the support of high government and Communist Party
officials in Estonia, will not back down.
   ``There won't be any other decision,'' he said. ``We are standing
on our own.''
   The drive for autonomy in Estonia has spread to the two other
Baltic republics, Lithuania and Latvia. Residents of the three
republics, which together have a population of less than 10 million,
are clamoring for greater control over their economic and cultural
life under the banner of Gorbachev's reform effort.
   Legislators in Lithuania on Friday proclaimed Lithuanian, the
mother tongue of about 80 percent of the republic's population, the
official language and restored the flag of the independent republic
that existed until 1940.
   On Sunday, about 140 leaders of the independent Lithuanian
Movement for Perestroika proclaimed the ``moral independence'' of
their republic from Soviet laws, said spokesman Alvydas Medalinskas
in a telephone interview from the capital of Vilnius.
   But Lithuanian legislators have been discouraged from taking
action similar to Estonia's by the chief of their Communist Party,
Algirdas Brazauskas.
   The small, Westward-looking republics were independent until
1940, when they were deeded to the Soviet Union under a secret
agreement between Hitler and Soviet leader Josef Stalin.

   Troops raided Palestinian settlements in the
West Bank and Gaza Strip on Sunday, fatally shooting a 22-year-old
man and wounding six Arab youths in clashes, Arab hospital officials
said.
   Five Palestinians suffered beating injuries during an army raid
in the West Bank village of Madama, Arab doctors said. The injured
included a 9-year-old boy with head wounds, they said, adding that
the cause of the injuries was not known.
   The army command confirmed that there was ``activity'' in Madama
but said it had no reports of injuries.
   Three Israelis suffered injuries when buses they were riding in
were pelted with rocks in the West Bank.
   In Lebanon, an Israeli soldier was killed and four others injured
when their armored personnel carrier overturned Sunday in southern
Lebanon, the army said. ``It was a road accident,'' said an army
spokesman, who declined to elaborate.
   Israel radio said the accident occurred north of the Lebanese
city of Naqoura, two miles north of the Israeli border in Israel's
self-declared buffer zone. The zone is patrolled by about 1,000
Israeli troops and the 2,000-member South Lebanon Army.
   Meanwhile, underground PLO leaders distributed leaflets praising
the declaration of an independent Palestinian state last week by the
Palestine National Council, the PLO's parliament-in-exile.
   The leaflet said the Palestine Liberation Organization had seized
a historic opportunity to boost the 11-month-old uprising against
Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. The pro-PLO
leaders also urged Moslem fundamentalist extremists to stop
criticizing the declaration publicly.
   ``Whether you like it or not, that will serve the enemy,'' said
the leaflet, signed by the Unified National Leadership of the
Uprising.
   The pro-PLO leaders called for ``escalating the struggle''
against Israel in the next two weeks and announced three one-day
strikes.
   Egypt on Sunday became the latest nation to recognize the
Palestinian state. A statement said it hoped the proclamation would
``serve the cause of peace and stability in the region.''
   ``I regret it very much,'' Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres
said about Egypt's stand. He declined further comment until he
studied the Egyptian statement.
   At least 31 other nations, mainly Moslem, have recognized the
state.
   In Jordan, Prime Minister Zaid Rifai said the PLO has met
conditions for taking part in the Middle East peace process by
implicitly recognizing Israel's right to exist, and accused Israel
of blocking a settlement.
   Sunday's Palestinian fatality occurred during an army raid of the
West Bank village of Baqa, near Nablus, said officials at Nablus' Al
Ittihad Hospital.
   Troops encountered resistance from Palestinians and opened fire,
wounding Yousef Mohammad Abdallah in the head and shooting a
16-year-old in the shoulder. Abdallah died at the hospital, Al
Ittihad officials said.
   His death raised to 314 the number of Palestinians killed in the
uprising. Eleven Israelis have been killed.
   At the El-Ein refugee camp near Nablus, a 17-year-old Arab youth
was shot in the hand, hospital officials said.
   Also in the West Bank, three Israelis were slightly injured in
stone-throwing attacks on public buses at the Amari refugee camp
near Ramallah and in the biblical town of Hebron.
   Israel's military administration said it will gradually start
reopening about 1,200 schools in the West Bank in December, but
warned schools will be shut down again in case of student
demonstrations.
   In separate clashes in Gaza's Jabaliya and Shati refugee camps,
soldiers shot and wounded four teenagers, hospital officials said.
   The 1.5 million Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and Gaza
Strip have been engaged since last December in an uprising against
21 years of Israeli military rule. Israel captured the territories

   A plane carrying Gov. Mario Cuomo made an
emergency landing at a small Pennsylvania airport early Sunday after
occupants of the plane reported smelling smoke, a spokesman said.
   Nobody was injured in the incident, which happened about 1:30
a.m., said Gary Fryer, a Cuomo spokesman. It was the third time
since July 1987 that the twin-engine state plane has been forced to
make an emergency landing.
   After the Democratic governor and his aides reported smelling
smoke, the two pilots turned off all non-essential power, including
the aircraft's interior lights, Fryer said. Using flashlights to
read their controls, the pilots then landed at the Williamsport
airport, which was closed at the time.
   The governor's spokesman said it was still unclear Sunday whether
there was a fire aboard the plane.
   People who had been on board said the smell was like that of an
electrical fire, he said, but ``it could just have been overheated
wires smoldering.'' At the same time, the plane's pilots reported
some problems with the radio, Fryer said.
   The pilots were assisted by an unidentified pilot in another
plane and by air traffic controllers in New York City, Boston and
Altoona, Pa., said Fryer.
   Because of the electrical problems, the governor's plane's radios
and navigational equipment were not working properly, said Fryer. So
the unidentified pilot helped out by relaying information from air
traffic controllers to the governor's pilots, he said. The pilot
also used his equipment to turn on the runway lights at the closed
airport, he said.
   ``We don't know who the good samaritan was, but whoever he is, he
was very helpful,'' said Fryer.
   After Cuomo's plane landed safely, another state plane flew to
Williamsport and returned him to Albany at about 6:30 a.m. Sunday,
said Fryer. Cuomo had been flying from New Orleans, where he
addressed the Council of Jewish Federations on Saturday night.
   In July 1987, pilots made an emergency landing at the Albany
County Airport when a light indicated an engine fire on the
Grumman-made G-1. That incident occurred shortly after Cuomo and his
entourage took off for a National Association of Governors meeting
in Michigan. An inspection revealed that the light had malfunctioned
and there was no fire.
   The plane then underwent a $628,000 overhaul after Cuomo
concluded it would be too expensive to replace. Then, there was an
emergency landing in March while the speaker of the state assembly
was on board, again because of a malfunctioning warning light.
   The two-engine turbo-prop aircraft had ``a substantial amount of
work done'' on it after the first incident last year, Fryer said.
``But like any aircraft, it's subject to problems.''
   Cuomo was traveling Sunday with two assistants and a State Police
bodyguard, Fryer said.

<HEAD>Pop Song Falls Foul of IRA Broadcast Ban</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   British authorities have banned a song by the
popular Irish folk group The Pogues because its lyrics support 10
people convicted of IRA bombings, a newspaper reported Sunday.
   The ban was issued under an order imposed last month by Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher's government. The order prohibits
broadcast interviews with members of the outlawed Irish Republican
Army, 10 other militant groups and their sympathizers.
   The Observer, a London weekly, said Britain's Independent
Broadcasting Authority ordered all commercial radio stations not to
play the band's single ``Streets of Sorrow@Birmingham Six.''
   Pogues manager Frank Murray was quoted as saying he stood by the
song's lyrics, which say the 10 were ``picked up and tortured and
framed.''
   The Broadcasting Authority said the lyrics might ``invite support
for an organization proscribed by the Home Secretary's directive in
that they (the lyrics) indicate a general disagreement with the way
in which the British government responds to, and the courts deal
with, the terrorist threat,'' according to the newspaper.
   Six Irishmen have claimed they were beaten into confessing and
convicted on faulty forensic evidence of killing 21 people in two
IRA pub bombings in the central England city of Birmingham in 1974.
It was the worst terrorist attack in modern British history.
   Three other Irishmen and an Irish woman have professed innocence
for two IRA pub bombings that killed five people in Guildford near
London the same year. Their lawyers say they too were convicted
after forced confessions and that the jury never heard evidence in
their favor.
   All 10 were sentenced to life in prison.
   Last month's ban followed an upsurge in killings by the mainly
Roman Catholic IRA. The rebel group is fighting to end British rule
in the Protestant-dominated province of Northern Ireland and unite
it with the predominantly Catholic Irish Republic to the south.

<TEXT>
   A 70-year-old woman who was partly paralyzed
after an operation to staple her stomach for weight loss was awarded
$7 million in damages.
   A Baltimore Circuit Court jury decided Friday that Ida Sober's
paralysis, which stemmed from a stroke she suffered five weeks after
the stomach operation, was caused by the negligence of Dr. George
Thomas and Church Hospital.
   C. Robert Loskot, an attorney representing Thomas and the
hospital, said he planned to file post-trial motions but declined to
specify what he would seek. He contended that the doctor was not
negligent and did not cause the complications that followed the
operation.
   Four days after the June 7, 1981, operation, Ms. Sober's stomach
began to leak internally, said her attorney, Robert Paul Mann.
Thomas ordered several tests but did not diagnose the problem until
the next day. An operation was then performed to stop the leakage,
but Ms. Sober's condition deteriorated and she eventually suffered a
stroke.
   ``She was looking forward to the loss of weight and a new life
before this all happened,'' said Mann.

<HEAD>Authorities Say China's Spies Most Active In United States</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The FBI says Chinese spies are active in
California, home to 25 percent of the nation's defense contracts,
but a Chinese official says the conclusion is based on ignorance.
   ``As far as human intelligence collection, the Chinese have now
outstripped the Soviets in California. Because of the political
climate, they have more opportunities here and appear to be
utilizing them,'' said Harry J. Godfrey III, head of FBI
counterintelligence in Los Angeles.
   About 400,000 people of Chinese descent live in California. There
are about 100 Chinese government-owned companies in the state, an
80-member consulate in San Francisco and a 30-member consulate in
Los Angeles.
   ``We know they are running operations here,'' Godfrey said. ``We
have seen cases where they have encouraged people to apply to the
CIA, the FBI, Naval Investigative Service and other defense
agencies. They have also attempted to recruit people at our research
facilities at Los Alamos (National Laboratory in New Mexico) and at
Lawrence Livermore.''
   ``We don't have intelligence ties,'' said Zhang Pengxiang,
China's political consul in Los Angeles. ``It's really imagination.
Not only that, it's ignorance. They really don't know China. We are
open here. Quite open.''
   Ma Yuzhen, China's consul general in Los Angeles, also denied
espionage efforts.
   ``I think that is the most inaccurate view of Chinese activity
here. None of us here are involved in intelligence gathering. No
Chinese consular officer is ever doing such things,'' Yuzhen said.
   China is the world's fifth largest arms merchant, selling more
than $2 billion worth of weapons annually.

<TEXT>
   A Jewish official who resigned under
fire after defending a blunt speech about the Nazi era said West
Germany's top Jewish leader pays too much attention to the problem
of antisemitism, a newspaper said Sunday.
   In a related incident, a city council member resigned after a
newspaper quoted him as saying ``they still haven't killed enough
Jews.''
   Both incidents surrounded West Germany's observance of the
anniversary of the Nov.9-10, 1938 Kristallnacht, the night of Nazi
terror against Jews that signaled the coming Holocaust.
   The Aachen Nachtrichten newspaper quoted witnesses as saying
councilor Willi Vossen Vossen made the comment as the Wegberg city
council reviewed plans to mark the anniversary.
   Vossen's wife on Sunday said her husband would not comment on the
newspaper report. She denied he made the remark.
   ``He didn't say anything like that at all,'' said Mrs. Vossen in
a telephone interview. She refused to give her first name.
   Wegberg, a city of 25,000 people, is 30 miles northwest of
Cologne.
   The newspaper Die Welt quoted Michael Fuerst as saying that
Jewish officials should concentrate more on day-to-day problems of
German Jews and place less emphasis on threats from antisemitism.
   ``The chairman of the Jewish Supervisory Council, Heinz Galinski,
places too much emphasis on the problem of antisemitism,'' it quoted
Fuerst as saying.
   Fuerst was the No.2 official in West Germany's Jewish community
until he resigned last week under heavy criticism from Galinski.
   Fuerst got into trouble with Galinski after defending a Nov. 10
speech by then-Parliament President Philipp Jenninger marking the
Kristallnacht anniversary.
   In his address, Jenninger reminded his audience that many Germans
initially embraced Hitler's campaigns. The speech outraged Jews and
others, who maintained his comments were not balanced with strong
condemnation of the Nazi atrocities. Jenninger resigned the next day.
   Fuerst had defended the speech, saying Jenninger had said ``with
full clarity'' what occurred in Germany after Hitler took power.
   Die Welt's report is to appear in Monday editions. The newspaper
telexed the report to other news organizations in advance.
   The Aachen newspaper quoted unidentified council members as
saying Vossen said during a meeting, ``They still haven't killed
enough Jews.''
   Mayor Fritz Jakobs said he did not know Vossen's exact words, but
council members told him it was ``something very similar'' to what
the newspaper reported.
   The mayor, speaking by telephone, read a statement that was
approved by the council after Vossen's resignation.
   It said, in part, ``I wish to state our deep concern. We distance
ourselves in every way from this unbearable and shameful remark.''

<HEAD>Opposition Leader Denounces Pinochet Threat to Annul Election
Results</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CONCEPCION, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An opposition leader said Sunday that
President Augusto Pinochet would lose the backing of the armed
forces if he tried to overturn a referendum requiring him to call
open elections.
   Pinochet, the army commander, said Saturday said that the outcome
of the Oct. 5 presidential referendum would become invalid if his
opponents refused to abide by a constitution drafted in 1980 by his
military government.
   Patricio Aylwin, leader of the centrist Christian Democratic
Party, told reporters in Concepcion that Pinochet's statement
``makes me think this gentleman is not really assuming his
reponsibility as leader.''
   Referring to Pinochet's comments about canceling the referendum
results, Aylwin said, ``He couldn't do it, because I'm certain that
the armed forces would not back any thing like that.''
   Aylwin, a 69-year-old lawyer, is considered to be the most
probable presidential nominee of an opposition coalition. The
Christian Democrats are Chile's largest single political
organization.
   In the referendum, Chileans rejected a proposal that would have
kept Pinochet in power until 1997. The vote was 3.9 million against
and 3.1 million in favor.
   As a result, the constitution requires that Pinochet call
elections, planned for December 1989, and hand over power to the
winner in March 1990.
   Since its victory the opposition has pressed for constitutional
amendments it says are needed to assure full democratic powers for
the new government. They contend the constitution gives too much
power to the presidency and to the military.
   Pinochet has said he will permit no changes. On Saturday, in the
southern city of Coyhaique, he said of the opposition: ``I have
asked them if they accept the constitution, but they remain silent.
If they say `No,' the plebescite is null.''
   The 72-year-old army commander seized power in a 1973 coup that
ousted the elected government of Marxist President Salvador Allende.
   Aylwin called Pinochet ``a president who has been beaten, to whom
the people have said they no longer want, and who finds himself more
and more alone.''

<DATELINE>MARION, Ind. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Roy Detamore never had a bicycle when he grew
up in a family of 14 children, so he spent 40 years making sure
other kids do. But he's decided to stop giving out bikes because
neighborhood kids keep stealing them. The last straw came when his
dog was shot with a pellet gun.
   ``I know if I keep (the bikes), I'll hurt someone,'' said
Detamore, 78. ``So I'm just giving them away.''
   His wife, Marie, says her husband lost his desire to collect and
repair bicycles when ones he intended to give to needy children
began disappearing at night.
   Bicycles filled all but a small path in the Detamores' backyard
and lined both sides of their driveway until he gave about 600 bikes
Saturday to the city, which hopes to continue Detamore's charitable
mission.
   His bike collecting began when his sons wanted one.
   ``I couldn't afford new, so I got some old ones and fixed them
up,'' he said. ``It wasn't long before every kid in the neighborhood
was pushing his bike up the alley for me to fix.''
   He'd take old bikes, find the parts and repair them. He asked
only for money for the parts. But if a child didn't have the money,
that was fine, too.
   ``It was just something for me to do,'' said Detamore, who is
retired.
   Now, he plans only to repair bikes with the spare parts that fill
every available nook and cranny of his garage.
   ``I can't stop altogether,'' Detamore said.

<HEAD>Suburban Schools Battling Increase Of Illegal Students</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK PERKISS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   City students fleeing gangs and low-quality
education are improperly attending suburban schools, which are using
educators and off-duty police officers to catch the impostors,
authorities said Sunday.
   Efforts to find students posing as suburban residents include
staking out train stations and following students home.
   ``We've caught 75 kids this year who live outside the district
and the money it cost us to educate them could translate into three
more teachers,'' said Larry Walker, assistant principal of Oak
Park-River Forest High School.
   Under state law, youngsters who live in one school district may
attend a public school in another area if they pay tuition. Student
impostors thus are costing school districts and taxpayers thousands
of dollars, officials said.
   At Walker's school in Oak Park, located just west of Chicago city
limits, annual tuition for students from other districts is $6,944,
Walker said.
   Other suburbs report similar problems.
   ``Last year it cost $5,049 to educate students and this year
we've found about 25 students who don't belong here and are not
paying tuition,'' said Raymond Surges, assistant principal at
Proviso East High School in Maywood.
   ``If we catch four students, that's one teacher we could hire,''
he said. ``It's a burden that the board of education and the
taxpayers don't want to deal with.''
   When they are caught, impostor students are withdrawn from the
school and ordered to enroll in the district where they live, Surges
and Walker said.
   ``When we find them we ask them to surrender their school
identification so they can't get into the building,'' Surges said.
   Students who want to get into a suburban school sometimes find
someone with the same last name in a telephone book and take the
address as their own or claim they are living with ailing relatives,
the educators said.
   ``I've heard an awful lot of dying grandmother stories,'' Surges
said.
   Parents seeking better educations for their children usually are
behind the problem, Walker said.
   ``The time we see this the most is when the Chicago schools are
on strike,'' he said. ``Most parents are honest, but if it's a
choice of no school or lying to get their kids into Oak Park, a lot
will decide to lie.''
   Illinois law requires that once a student is suspected of
attending classes illegally, officials must allow parents an
opportunity to prove they and the youngster live in the district.
   ``The burden of proof goes to the parent to prove residence,''
Walker said. ``We ask to see leases or utility bills. Parents have
to convince us. They're suspect.''

<HEAD>Mondale Says Presidential Campaign ``A Disgrace''</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Vice President Walter Mondale says the
presidential campaigns run by both candidates this year were ``a
disgrace'' and turned out ``worse than I originally thought.''
   ``I feel sick,'' Mondale said of the George Bush and Michael
Dukakis campaigns in an interview published in Sunday editions of
the Star Tribune.
   Mondale said part of the blame should go to television, which
revealed more about campaign media handlers than about the
candidates themselves.
   ``There is no substance,'' Mondale said of the campaign. ``The
candidates are hidden. You don't get to ask questions. The negatives
have taken over and it's mud every night.''
   Mondale said he was especially angered by a news conference at
Boston Harbor where Bush declared himself an environmentalist,
labeled Dukakis a polluter and then put a halt to questions.
   ``Politicians are permitted to throw mud from privileged
sanctuaries and the negatives are driving substance off the playing
field,'' he said. ``They can mount an attack and then not take
questions about that attack. First Bush, then Dukakis. You couldn't
get a hold of any of them for questioning and for context.''
   Mondale called for more frequent and longer debates than the two
sessions held this year, in which he said Bush and Dukakis delivered
scripted lines and ignored substantive questions.
   Mondale predicted the problems he identified wouldn't be resolved
until people get fed up with show-business presidential campaigns.
   ``Maybe it's starting,'' he said, noting that this year's voter
turnout was only about 50 percent.

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Wet weather dominated the eastern third of the nation Sunday with
heavy rain over parts of the Northeast, Florida and the Ohio Valley,
after a night of strong tornado activity.
   A low pressure system was centered over Ohio and thunderstorms
developed along a cold front that extended from the low southward
into the Florida Panhandle.
   Showers and thunderstorms developed near the low over
southwestern, central and eastern Ohio into western West Virginia.
Wind from a thunderstorm downed trees at East Liverpool, Ohio.
   Gusty wind was reported with the passage of the cold front, with
gusts to 56 mph at Cincinnati, 53 mph at Columbus and to 52 mph at
Huntington, W.Va.
   One to two inches of rain was measured across southern Ohio
including 1.95 at Piketon, 1.92 at Salem Center and 1.65 at Athens.
Louisville, Ky., reported 1.41 inches in 24 hours.
   Other showers and thunderstorms were along the cold front over
Georgia and the Florida Panhandle, producing brief heavy rain over
parts of the Florida Panhandle.
   During the six hours up to 1 p.m., 1.33 inches of rain fell at
Panama City, Fla.
   During the previous night, 23 tornadoes were reported over the
South, and two people were killed in Mississippi.
   Rain also was widespread from southern Lower Michigan into New
England and the mid Atlantic Coast region. Northern New Jersey got 1
to 1.75 inches of rain and Newark had a record 1.31 inches by
midmorning. Bridgeport, Conn., got 1.32 inches of rain in the six
hours up to 1 p.m. and New York City got 1.30 at LaGuardia airport.
   Snow fell over much of the middle Mississippi Valley region, with
5 to 7 inches on the ground at Rolla, Mo. Three inches fell in the
St. Louis area.
   Scattered light snow fell from the Dakotas into Minnesota.
   Elsewhere, light showers were scattered over the Idaho Panhandle
and northwestern Montana.
   A tropical depression in the Caribbean was upgraded Sunday to
tropical storm Keith, the 11th named storm of the hurricane season.
   Jacksonville, Fla., reached a record 85 degrees.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 14
degrees at Warroad, Minn., to 87 at Daytona Beach and St.
Petersburg, Fla. Sunday morning's low was 12 degrees below zero at
Jackson, Wyo.
   For Monday, snow was forecast from northeastern New York state
into much of Maine, with scattered snow showers in western and
central New York state. Widespread rain was forecast over the
northern and central Pacific Coast, with showers scattered across
the Pacific Northwest and northern plateau regions and snow
spreading across northwestern Montana.
   Highs in the 30s were predicted from the northern high Plains
through the upper Mississippi Valley and the Great Lakes region into
the northern half of New England; in the 60s from western and
central Texas through the Gulf Coast region into the middle and
southern Atlantic Coast, and over central and southern California;
in the 70s across the Los Angeles basin, southwestern Arizona, the
lower Rio Grande Valley and central Florida; in the low 80s over
southern Florida; and in the 40s or 50s across much of the rest of
the nation.

<TEXT>
   The Church of Love promised Angels of Love
and a paradise called Chonda-Za, but federal prosecutors say it was
a sex-fantasy scam that bilked more than 31,000 lonely men out of at
least $4.5 million.
   Donald S. Lowry, 59, and Pamala St. Charles, 24, were scheduled
to go on trial on fraud charges Monday in federal court in Peoria,
with prosecutors saying they would attempt to prove the pair built a
money-making myth based on photographs of nude and semi-nude young
women.
   The operation was centered in the Quad Cities _ Moline, Ill., and
Rock Island, Davenport and Bettendorf, Iowa _ where police called
the photos ``soft-porn provocative.''
   Federal authorities say the photos aren't the real problem.
``This isn't an obscenity trial, it's a fraud trial,'' said
assistant U.S. Attorney Tate Chambers.
   Indictments returned in December named Ms. St. Charles, Lowry and
his wife, Esther Lowry. All three were charged with multiple counts
of mail fraud, one count of conspiracy and unlawfully using fraud
proceeds. The charges against Mrs. Lowry were dropped recently, but
Chambers declined to say why.
   According to the indictment, Lowry and his wife formed the COL
Corp. in June 1974 while they were also operating a company called
Lydian Manor Publishers. In May 1986, Ms. St. Charles joined the
corporation and soon became Lowry's chief assistant.
   Meanwhile, COL allegedly began mailing out ``initial pitch
letters'' to men, asking them to send between $20 and $30 for a
membership fee, according to the indictment.
   The letters said the Church of Love was founded in June 1965 by a
teen-age Mexican girl named Maria Simona Mireles. Prosecutors say
Maria Mireles was played, when necessary, by Mrs. Lowry.
   ``Mother Maria,'' as she was called, supposedly lived with many
young women known as the ``Angels of Love'' on a farm near Hillsdale
just north of the Quad Cities, according to the letters.
   The letters claimed Mother Maria and the Church of Love wanted to
establish a valley paradise to be known as Chonda-Za, where men
could join the Angels, have all their wishes fulfilled and spend the
rest of their lives, the indictment states.
   To solicit funds, the COL made various misrepresentations,
including telling recruits that the Angels needed money for Mother
Maria's garden fund at the nonexistent retreat. The Angels depended
on the garden for food in winter, the letters explained.
   The case originally was scheduled for trial in the Quad Cities,
but was moved to Peoria because of extensive publicity. The jury
trial is expected to take five weeks.

   A car rigged with explosives
blew up near a British army base Sunday night, wounding nine
soldiers, police said.
   The huge blast at the North Howard Street army base was heard
over much of west and south Belfast. Nine soldiers were taken to a
hospital but their injuries were found to be slight, a police
spokesman said on condition of anonymity.
   Police said the blast was caused by a car rigged with explosives
at an intersection near the army base.
   More than 11,000 British army troops are based in Northern
Ireland, which is a province of Britain.
   There was no immediate claim of responsibility. The area was
sealed off and an investigation begun.
   Earlier Sunday, a soldier from the locally recruited Ulster
Defense Regiment spotted a booby-trap bomb under his car in Dundrum
in County Down, authorities said.
   Fifty people were evacuated from their homes for more than three
hours while an army bomb expert defused the device, which contained
two pounds of plastic explosives.
   Last week, police warned all residents to be on their guard for a
new wave of booby-trap bombs by the Irish Republican Army. The
mostly Roman Catholic group is fighting to drive the British out of
mainly Protestant Northern Ireland and unite it with the
predominantly Catholic Irish Republic.

   Voters in the central and southern states of
Tlaxcala and Chiapas on Sunday cast ballots in more than 150
municipal races, and opposition parties accused the government of
fraud.
   The governing Institutional Revolutionary Party has not lost a
major election in its 59-year history and was expected to win most
of the mayoral races. Many of the municipalities are in remote
regions and final results were not expected to be announced until
next week.
   Mayors were being elected in all 109 towns and cities in Chiapas
and in the 44 in Tlaxcala.
   ``If the vote is respected _ and it's not being respected _ there
would be the possibility of victories in at least 20
municipalities,'' Jorge Moscoso Pedrero, an official of the leftist
National Democratic Front in Chiapas, said by telephone.
   The governing party ran candidates in all of the contests. The
Democratic Front had candidates in 43 municipalities in Chiapas and
the conservative National Action Party was entered in 21.
   In Tlaxcala, the Democratic Front parties had candidates in 33 of
the 44 municipalities and the National Action Party 12.
   Moscoso Pedrero said, ``We have reports of `flying brigades,' all
traveling in pickup trucks of the Agriculture Department'' going to
different polling places and voting in each one in Villa Flores, 35
miles southwest of the provincial capital of Tuxtla Gutierrez.
   Similar allegations were made by the opposition in the July 6
general elections. PRI officials denied the claims.
   The governing party candidate, Carlos Salinas de Gortari, won the
presidential election with an official tally of 50.36 per cent of
the vote and will succeed President Miguel de la Madrid on Dec. 1.

<TEXT>
   The party of populist leader Benazir
Bhutto virtually swept voting in its home province but shared
regional power with rivals in three other provinces, according to
election results released Sunday. Ms. Bhutto's left-of-center party
won the largest bloc of seats in National Assembly elections last
week and moved her closer to her goal of becoming prime minister.
She had hoped Saturday's follow-up provincial elections would allow
her to consolidate her political power.
   She said Sunday she was pleased with the showing of her Pakistan
People's Party in Saturday's voting.
   ``We feel very happy about these elections,'' she told a press
conference at her walled compound in the southern port city of
Karachi. ``They are a tribute to the people of Pakistan.''
   With all but a handful of 459 precints reporting results from
Saturday's voting, Ms. Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party gained 184
provincial seats, compared to 145 for the right-wing Islamic
Democratic Alliance, its strongest rival. The remainder went to
independents and minor parties.
   In her home province of Sind, Bhutto's party virtually shut out
the Democratic Alliance with a 67-1 victory in provincial Assembly
seats.
   Ms. Bhutto's party appeared likely to be able to form a slim
majority coalition in two other provinces, Baluchistan and Northwest
Frontier.
   However, the Democratic Alliance captured a 108-94 victory over
the People's Party in Eastern Punjab, where 60 percent of the
country's 107 million people live.
   With the country's first free elections in more than a decade
complete, Pakistanis now look to President Ghulam Ishaq Khan to name
a prime minister. He has not said when he will do so.
   Ms. Bhutto says her party has attracted enough support outside it
ranks to form a government. She would be the first woman to lead an
Islamic country.
   However, her conservative rivals in the Democratic Alliance say
that despite their weaker showing in the national election, they too
can form a coalition big enough to command a majority.
   Ms. Bhutto's populist party won 92 seats in Wednesday's voting
for the National Assembly, while her main rivals won 55 in the
237-seat body.
   Ms. Bhutto, 35, is the daughter of former Prime Minister Zulfikar
Ali Bhutto, was ousted by Gen. Mohammed Zia ul-Haq in 1977 and
executed two years later.
   Zia died Aug. 17 in a plane crash soon after calling elections.

<TEXT>
   The prosecutor in mob boss Nicodemo ``Little
Nicky'' Scarfo's racketeering trial says the conviction should send
a message that the government can get tough on organized crime.
   A federal jury on Saturday night convicted Scarfo, 59, and 16
associates in a racketeering conspiracy that included murder, drug
dealing, loansharking and illegal gambling.
   The five-lawyer Organized Crime Strike Force that prosecuted the
case rejoiced after the verdict was read.
   ``I think everyone of us was quietly confident,'' said Assistant
U.S. Attorney Louis Pichini, who led the team. ``We were so terribly
proud that the system worked and did not buckle under.
   ``We were confident that the case had the evidence to convince a
reasonable jury and this jury was convinced overwhelmingly. One of
the things that this case did was it broke the myth of the Mafia's
invincibility.''
   Scarfo's attorney, Robert Simone, said he would appeal the
verdict reached after 26 hours of jury deliberations.
   Each defendant was found guilty on each of the two main
conspiracy counts they faced. In addition, some were found guilty on
other charges they faced individually.
   All the defendants face up to 20 years in prison. No sentencing
date was set.
   The government contended the 17 defendants were mobsters who
conspired in nine murders, four attempted murders, extortions, drug
dealing, loansharking and illegal gambling.
   Defense attorneys had attacked the credibility of the
government's star witnesses, ex-mobsters Thomas ``Tommy Del''
DelGiorno and Nicholas ``Nicky Crow'' Caramandi, who have testified
in previous trials against Scarfo.
   The case began Sept. 13 and was heard before U.S. District Judge
Franklin Van Antwerpen.

<TEXT>
   Thousands of teachers and students
called Sunday for educational reforms and demanded that former
President Chun Doo-hwan be punished for alleged misdeeds during his
authoritarian rule.
   About 10,000 educators and students demonstrated peacefully
outside the National Assembly building to demand laws be revised to
prohibit government interference in education.
   ``Abolish undemocratic educational laws,'' the protesters yelled.
Many demonstrators also shouted slogans demanding Chun's arrest for
corruption, misrule and human rights abuses.
   President Roh Tae-woo, beset with mounting calls for Chun's
punishment, has been pressing his predecessor to surrender property
and retire to the countryside in a traditional gesture of repentance.
   There has been a spate of street protests urging Chun's arrest in
recent weeks. On Saturday, thousands of students and dissidents
battled riot police in downtown Seoul when police stopped their
march to Chun's house.
   Opponents also charged that mutinous army generals, including
Roh, worked out an elaborate scenario in 1980 that enabled Chun to
seize power during martial law.
   In a parliamentary hearing late Saturday, meanwhile, lawmakers
quizzed former Defense Minister Choo Young-bock about the alleged
roles Chun and the United States played in putting down the 1980
civil uprising in the southern city of Kwangju.
   Opposition lawmakers claimed Chun and his associates provoked the
uprising to catapult Chun to the presidency. The Kwangju tragedy
remained a political tinderbox during Chun's seven-year rule.
   Choo shrugged off most opposition allegations Saturday but
apologized to the nation for failing to prevent the Kwangju
violence, in which nearly 200 people were killed.
   Choo also testified that the South Korean military worked
independently to put down the uprising, although the United States
had operational control of South Korean forces under the two
nation's mutual defense pact.
   ``There is no reason for the United States to intervene in
domestic affairs,'' Choo said.
   But opposition lawmakers produced military records they claimed
indicated that U.S. forces had prior discussions with Korean army
generals and approved the dispatch of troops to Kwangju.
   Top opposition leader Kim Dae-jung said Friday that the United
States could not avoid moral responsibility for bloodshed in Kwangju.
   The opposition-controled National Assembly opened hearings Nov.
7., the first in South Korean history. The hearings have been
broadcast live on national television and have drawn large audiences.

   Supporters and opponents of the U.S.-Canada free
trade agreement combined last-minute electioneering Sunday with a
final advertising blitz on the eve of national elections.
   Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, buoyed by recent polls that showed
his Progressive Conservative Party back in the lead, toured his
native Quebec while his leading rival, Liberal Party leader John
Turner, campaigned in Vancouver, British Columbia.
   Both have focused on the trade deal _ the major issue in Monday's
race.
   Mulroney told a Saturday news conference in Quebec that he would
call Parliament back into session quickly to proceed with final
passage of the pact, which Turner has vowed to reject.
   In an interview with this week's Maclean's magazine, Mulroney was
quoted as saying he would try to pursue the trade agreement even if
his party can only form a minority government.
   ``The trade deal is a must for Canada's future,'' he was quoted
as saying. ``It's a visionary instrument of job creation and new
wealth and it is clearly something that is on the right side of
history.''
   But Turner has revived his campaign by saying the pact threatened
to make Canada a U.S. colony.
   Speaking at a Saturday campaign rally, Turner repeated his call
to ``keep Canada Canadian for Canadians'' and cancel the pact with a
vote for his party.
   In this week's Maclean's, Turner was quoted as saying the pact
``would radically change the direction of our country. It yields the
economic levers of sovereignty: our energy, our investment policy,
our capital markets, supply-management of agriculture.''
   The socialist New Democratic Party also opposes the agreement
that President Reagan and Mulroney signed in January, so only a
majority Conservative government ensures that it will proceed as
scheduled.
   The 10-year agreement would start phasing out all remaining
tariffs between Canada and the United States on Jan. 1. It has
passed the U.S. Congress but still needs Canadian parliamentary
approval.
   Mulroney spent the campaign's last weekend in his native
French-speaking Quebec, where he is counting on support for the free
trade agreement to come through with a solid showing for the
province's 75 seats.
   ``We're on the road to Baie-Comeau, and we're on the road to
victory,'' a confident-looking Mulroney said at a Sunday rally in
Trois-Rivieres, Quebec. The prime minister, the first bilingual
native of Quebec to lead his party, was returning to his hometown of
Baie-Comeau for election day.
   Turner was in Vancouver, British Columbia, on the Pacific coast,
where he will vote in his home district Monday. He reiterated his
call for Canadians to vote for his party to halt the trade agreement.
   ``This election is still to be won,'' he said.
   Turner hopes the Liberals will come through best in the 99 seats
of predominantly English-speaking Ontario, where opposition to the
agreement is strongest.
   Quebec and Ontario have the majority of Canada's 26 million
people. The House of Commons was newly expanded this year to 295
seats, so a party needs 148 seats to form a majority government.
   The Conservatives are hoping for a second successive majority,
which has not happened in Canada since 1953. Mulroney led his party
to an overwhelming victory four years ago, taking 210 of the then
282 seats in Commons.
   Mulroney says the trade deal guarantees future Canadian
prosperity by assuring access to the larger U.S. market.
   ``Canadians must not be tricked into squashing an agreement other
countries would welcome with open arms,'' the Canadian Alliance for
Trade and Job Opportunities, a business lobbying group, said in its
final argument.
   The Toronto Star, which has opposed the trade agreement, said in
its Sunday editorial that the deal ``is a magnet that will pull us
economically, culturally and politically into the U.S. orbit.''
   A Gallup Poll published Saturday by the Star found the
Progressive Conservatives back in the lead with 40 percent of
decided voters to 35 percent for the Liberals and 22 percent for the
New Democrats.
   It said the regional distribution of the Conservatives' support
indicated they could win a majority government of 162 seats with
that margin of victory.

   Foreign Minister Shimon Peres told a group of
American Jews on Sunday that his Labor Party will never make a
political deal that would alter Israel's criteria for determining
who is legally Jewish.
   An amendment supported by the rival Likud bloc would give
Orthodox rabbis the exclusive authority to approve conversions to
Judaism. The proposal is strongly opposed by Conservative and Reform
Jews.
   ``We could not have built Israel without American Jews,'' Peres
told a delegation from the New York-based National Council of Jewish
Women. ``We must continue to keep our people together.''
   Representatives of the women's council said they are concerned
that some Israeli parties are willing to use the ``Who is a Jew''
amendment as a political bargaining point.
   ``This amendment would disenfranchise Jews all over the world,''
said Nan Rich, a member of the council's national board of
directors. ``It would alienate many of us who feel we have a great
stake in the future of Israel.''
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's right-wing Likud bloc has told
Israel's religious parties it would support the amendment. The
religious parties are a crucial factor in forming a coalition
government.
   Religious parties won 18 of the 120 seats in Parliament in the
Nov. 1 election and neither Likud nor the left-leaning Labor
acquired a majority, with Likud winning 40 seats and Labor 39.
   Peres declared that his party would not change its position on
the ``Who is a Jew'' issue even if it joins a coalition government
led by Likud.
   ``We will never negotiate away our right to remain true to our
positions,'' Peres told reporters after the meeting with the
American delegation.
   The proposed amendment would change the Law of Return that gives
Israeli citizenship to any Jew who seeks it.
   Current law defines a Jew as anyone born to a Jewish mother or
converted to Judaism. The change would nullify conversions performed
by Reform and Conservative rabbis, disqualifying a majority of the
six million Jews in North America.
   Earlier Sunday, 1,000 British members of the international Joint
Israel Appeal opened its annual fundraising drive in Jerusalem with
a call to abandon the ``Who is a Jew'' amendment.
   Trevor Chin, president of the group in Britain, said changing the
Law of Return would damage relations with Jews around the world. He
said on Israel radio, ``Israel has a constituency of world Jewry
that is unified.... For God's sake don't break it.''
   In Atlanta, Ga., Reform leaders urged Israel to reject the
efforts by Orthodox parties to amend the Law of Return.
   The board of trustees of the Union of American Hebrew
Congregations, meeting in Atlanta, sent a letter to Israeli
President Cjaim Herzog, Shamir and Peres saying: ``We implore you,
for the sake of Israel and the Jewish people, to put Jewish unity
before considerations of political expediency.''

   Sweden held the Soviet Union to a 2-2 tie
in the seventh round of the Chess Olympiad on Sunday, but the
Soviets kept a 2.5-point lead in the championship.
   In separate women's competition, the Soviets regained the lead
from Hungary with a 3-0 victory over West Germany. They seized a
1.5-lead as Hungary, the overnight leaders, lost 2-1 to Yugoslavia.
   The first Soviet defeat in the men's championship came when
Swedish International Master Thomas Ernst gained an impressive
victory over Grandmaster Jaan Ehlvest.
   The Soviets tied the match when former world champion Anatoly
Karpov beat Sweden's top player Ulf Andersson.
   The Soviets maintained first place with 22 points. Sweden, the
ninth seed, was second with 19.5 points.
   Yugoslavia, which was ahead 2-0 against Bulgaria with two games
unfinished, was third with 18.5 points.
   Harry Schussler, Sweden's second-ranked player, said the 2-2 tie
with the Soviets left Sweden with a strong chance to win a medal.
   West Germany crushed Poland 4-0 to move up and share fourth place
with East Germany, Netherlands and third-seeded Hungary.
   The United States, who won the bronze medals in the last three
Olympiads, on Sunday drew its match with East Germany 2-2.
   Boris Gulko of the United States defeated Uwe Boench, but the
East Germans tied with a victory from Rainer Knaak over Larry
Christiansen.
   The biggest surprise of the day in the men's competition came
when India, the 21st seed, took a 2-1 lead over second-seeded
England.
   One victory came from International Master Krishnamoorthy
Murugtan, who overpowered British Grandmaster Jonathan Mestel.
   But England has a chance to tie the match. Grandmaster Murray
Chandler has adjourned a pawn ahead in an endgame against Dibyendu
Barua.
   The Hungarian women's team, favored by many experts to win the
gold medals over the Soviets, collapsed when Ildiko Madl lost
against Yugoslavian International Master Suzana Maksimovic.
   It was the first match where Hungary had rested Judit Polgar, the
highest ranked 12-year-old in history.
   The 28th Olympiad, a biennial world team championship, is being
held in this city about 300 miles north of Athens. Organized by the
127-member World Chess Federation, the month-long competition
features teams from 106 nations.
   The 14th and final round is scheduled for Nov. 29.
   The adjourned games will be completed Monday with the eighth
round on Monday evening.

   Hundreds of people returned home Sunday
after an overnight evacuation that began when a train derailed and
spilled nearly 30,000 gallons of sulfuric acid.
   Four engines and 73 cars _ 42 loaded and 31 empty _ jumped the
tracks at 5:30 p.m. Saturday as the CSX train traveled north from
Birmingham to Nashville, Tenn., officials said.
   Most of the contents leaked from a 30,000-gallon tanker
containing acid, producing fumes that irritated lungs and eyes. An
estimated 1,000 people from Garden City and Bangor, about 35 miles
north of Birmingham, were evacuated, said Chief Deputy E.C. Ellard
of the Cullman County Sheriff's Department.
   ``It was a precautionary measure, but no one was injured,''
Ellard said.
   Crews built a levee to contain the leaking acid and then used
lime to neutralize it.
   Some of the acid leaked into a creek, which feeds into the
Mulberry Fork River, but it was not enough to be dangerous, said Lee
Helms, director of operations for the Alabama Emergency Management
Agency.
   John Walker, a CSX Transportation spokesman in Jacksonville,
Fla., questioned the county's evacuation count, and said railroad
officials estimated it at no more than 200.

   Two Tamil organizations won 18 seats
and a Moslem party won 17 in balloting for a a new administrative
council in war-ravaged eastern Sri Lanka, election officials said
Sunday.
   Tamil guerrillas battling for a separate homeland boycotted
Saturday's election in Eastern province.
   Military officials said at least 40 people were killed in
election-related violence Saturday and Sunday, including six members
of the Indian peacekeeping force that provided security at polling
stations. The officials, who were not identified according to
government policy, gave no other details.
   Sinhalese, who form a majority in most other areas of this island
nation and control the national government, did not win any of the
35 council seats.
   Lakshman Perera, deputy election commissioner, said two Tamil
groups, the Eelam People's Revolutionary Liberation Front and the
Eelam National Democratic Liberation Front, received 215,230 votes
and 18 seats.
   Both had been guerrilla organizations but renounced violence and
accepted the peace accord mediated by India in an effort to end the
fighting that has taken more than 8,500 lives since 1983.
   Perera said the Sri Lanka Moslem Congress won 168,038 votes and
17 seats while the predominantly Sinhalese United National Party got
8,056 votes.
   There were 635,050 eligible voters but the most powerful Tamil
guerrilla group, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, called for a
boycott. The Liberation Tigers said that the plan, which merged the
Northern and Eastern provinces with a semi-autonomous 71-seat
administrartive council, did not meet their demands for their own
homeland.
   Eastern province has large Sinhalese, Tamil and Moslem
communities while Northern province is overwhelmingly Tamil.
Northern province named its 36 members to the administrtavie council
last month. There were no elections there because the Tamil factions
agreed on a formula for apportioning the seats and all candidates
were unopposed when nominations were filed.
   Most Tamils are Hindus and many accuse the Buddhist Sinhalese of
discrimination. Sinhalese comprise 75 percent of Sri Lanka's
population of 16 million people and the Tamils about 18 percent.

   Hundreds of supporters of the Solidarity

leader Lech Walesa failed to agree on talks with the government,
activists said.
   Police arrested more than 20 people after an opposition march in
Gdansk when a group of protesters tried to hang a Solidarity banner
on a railroad car, said Solidarity spokeswoman Joanna Wojciechowicz.
   She did not know if they had been freed.
   The protests in the Baltic port city and in the southern
coal-mining city of Jastrzebie came after Walesa and Interior
Minister Gen. Czeslaw Kiszczak failed to reach agreement in talks
Friday and Saturday. They tried to lay plans for stalled round-table
talks on national reconciliation and the future of the outlawed
labor movement.
   Earlier Sunday, several hundred people with Solidarity banners
marched to the railway station from a Roman Catholic Church, Ms.
Wojciechowicz said.
   The crowd then headed toward local Communist Party headquarters
but returned to the station and dispersed when police appeared, she
said.
   A Gdansk police spokesman reached by telephone said he could not
confirm the report.
   In Jastrzebie, about 1,000 people marched from a Catholic church
to a former Solidarity headquarters building and listened to
speeches by regional Solidarity leaders, said group spokesman Robert
Kozak. There was no police intervention, he said.
   Strikes by miners in Jastrzebie in mid-August touched off
Poland's worst labor unrest in seven years.

<HEAD>Haiti To Get Emergency Hurricane Relief Aid, Other Funds Released</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ The United States will give Haiti
about $3 million in emergency hurricane relief and release $5
million in other aid, a spokesman for the U.S. Embassy said Sunday.
   Spokeswoman Susan Clyde said the hurricane aid will be in the
form of food and heating oil. Agricultural production in the
southern peninsula of Haiti was severely damaged by Hurricane
Gilbert in September.
   The United States also is releasing $5 million in food relief
money under a program called the Food for Peace.
   The United States froze $20 million in Food for Peace money after
last year's violently aborted elections, but $15 million were
released last month.
   The U.S. government cut off about $60 million in non-humanitarian
aid to Haiti after last year's aborted elections.
   ``About $30 million in humanitarian aid has never been cut off,''
Clyde said.
   The total U.S. aid package to Haiti was about $90 million.
   At least 34 people were slain Nov. 24 when thugs shot and hacked
to death voters while army troops looked on. Haiti at the time was
under the rule of Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy, who was deposed Sept. 17 in
a coup by lower-ranking officers. Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril was
installed in Namphy's place.

<HEAD>McNamara Says He Won't Resign Over Marijuana Probe</HEAD>

   U.S. Attorney Frank L. McNamara Jr. said Sunday he
will not resign despite a Justice Department investigation into
allegations that he lied when he said he saw his predecessor smoke
marijuana.
   ``This is a mountain out of a molehill,'' McNamara said. ``I
think the whole thing has been a tremendous amount of nonsense. You
can look for that office to continue to function as a professional
office with me at the helm.''
   McNamara also said his own use of marijuana as recently as four
years ago did not run counter to tough anti-drug pronouncements.
   ``What I did is what a lot of people who grew up and went to
college in the '60s and '70s did. I wish I hadn't done it. I'm not
happy I did it. It was a mistake,'' he said.
   ``Perhaps out of that I can be even more committed to the war
against drugs,'' he added.
   McNamara, 41, the chief federal prosecutor for Massachusetts,
faces a Justice Department inquiry into his claim to investigators
that his predecessor, William F. Weld, smoked marijuana at a 1982
party in Virginia while still U.S. attorney.
   The Justice Department reported last week that an inquiry found
evidence to contradict McNamara's assertion.
   ``I want any questions that may exist in anybody's mind about my
motivations in this entire matter to be resolved,'' McNamara said in
a telephone interview from his home in Bolton. ``That's why I
requested the investigation.''
   McNamara refused to discuss the inquiry by the department's
Office of Professional Responsibility or his accusations against
Weld, whom McNamara succeeded in April 1987.
   McNamara said he planned to hold a staff meeting Monday to
discuss the charges, which aides said have virtually paralyzed the
50-lawyer office that prosecutes all federal crimes in Massachusetts.
   McNamara took over as U.S. attorney several weeks afer Weld left
for Washington to head the Justice Department's criminal division.
   The federal probe is examining whether McNamara made up the
marijuana story because Weld had opposed his nomination on grounds
that other prosecutors had more experience. It also reportedly is
examining whether McNamara was forthright about smoking marijuana
when he was questioned prior to confirmation for the job.

<TEXT>
   A man who got into a wild shootout with police
who tried to arrest him and then spent 2{ weeks in hiding was
acquitted Sunday on attempted murder charges, but convicted of
weapons violations.
   It was the second time this year that Larry Davis has been
acquitted in a trial. On March 3, he was found innocent of murdering
four suspected drug dealers in the Bronx.
   When the verdicts were announced, Davis squeezed the hands of his
lawyers, Lynne Stewart and William Kunstler, according to Kunstler.
Tears came to Davis' eyes, said Kunstler, the leftist lawyer who
often portrays black clients like Davis as victims of a racist
system.
   ``Maybe there will be no more black Sambos, only black Rambos,''
Kunstler said. ``Maybe this means there will be fewer shootings of
blacks and young Latinos in this city.''
   Bronx District Attorney Paul Gentile said he would ask the judge
to give Davis the maximum sentence on the weapons counts, in the
hope that ``it will help those police officers who received
devastating injuries accept these verdicts.''
   ``The devastating fact remains that this jury of 12 people, by
their verdict, found that the injuries that Larry Davis imposed upon
these police officers in the course of their duties were justified
by law,'' Gentile added.
   The Nov. 19, 1986, shootout occurred when 20 officers went to
Davis' sister's apartment to arrest him for the four drug-related
slayings.
   Davis, now 22, escaped unscathed from the apartment after trading
more than 30 shots with nine officers. He was captured after a
17-day manhunt, one of the most extensive in the city's history.
   Prosecutors said Davis opened fire to evade arrest. The defense
contended officers went to kill Davis because of his knowledge of
police corruption, and that he fired in self-defense.
   In addition to the nine counts of attempted murder, Davis was
acquitted of six counts of aggravated assault.
   The jury, which deliberated for five days, convicted Davis on six
counts of criminal possession of weapons, said Ed McCarthy,
spokesman for the Bronx district attorney's office.
   Davis faces a maximum penalty of 10 to 20 years in prison on the
weapons counts when Acting Justice Bernard Fried imposes sentence.
In unrelated cases, Davis still faces two charges of murder.
   A key issue was who fired first _ the police or Davis. The
defense said it was a shotgun-wielding officer, presumably one who
rushed in ahead of other officers; prosecutors said it was Davis,
whom they portrayed as a murderous crack dealer.
   Kunstler said the testimony of a ballistics expert showed that
the first shot came from a police shotgun at close range _ closer
than the prosecution maintained.
   ``The truth of this case is justification,'' defense attorney
Lynne Stewart told the jury during closing arguments. ``Against all
odds, Larry Davis, a son of the South Bronx, acted to save his life
in the back bedroom of his sister's apartment.''
   Testimony lasted four months, with the prosecution calling 56
witnesses, most of them police, and the defense calling 17.
   Jury selection began April 18 but pretrial maneuvers took months,
beginning with the prosecution successfully arguing that the defense
was arbitrarily excluding whites from the jury.
   The defense sought to establish that Davis had unusual contacts
with the police, presenting testimony that officers frequently
visited him at home the past five years. Prosecutors countered with
police witnesses who said they visited the Davis home in the course
of numerous criminal investigations.
   The defense also sought to show that the police fabricated the
grounds for the arrest party as an excuse to kill Davis. Prosecutors
countered by trying to establish that Davis was legitimately a prime
suspect in the four killings.

   Nearly two dozen tornadoes slashed across parts of the South
during the weekend, destroying homes and ripping down trees, and at
least two people were killed.
   Torrential rain also fell across the South and from Arkansas into
Kentucky, washing out one small dam and sending streams over their
banks.
   Three Mississippi traffic deaths were blamed on the wet weather
and tornadoes injured six people in Alabama and 11 in Mississippi.
   In colder air west of the rain, 5 inches of snow fell at Joplin,
Mo., 3 to 8 inches of snow was reported in Montgomery County, Kan.,
and 4 to 6 inches of snow fell over parts of the Ozarks, the
National Weather Service said.
   Twenty-three tornadoes were reported along with numerous reports
of damaging wind and large hail Saturday and early Sunday, the
weather service said.
   One tornado cut a mile-long path of destruction through
Tuscaloosa, Ala., early Sunday, damaging more than 100 houses and
injuring six people.
   ``In most of the neighborhood, everything is pretty much
devastated,'' said John Gray, who had a tree blown on his house.
   Dick Pierce, director of the Tuscaloosa County Emergency
Management Agency, said about 15 houses were destroyed or heavily
damaged and another 20 to 25 suffered moderate-to-light damage. The
houses were all in a strip about a quarter-mile wide and a mile
long, he said.
   Alabama Gov. Guy Hunt called out the National Guard to help with
the cleanup, and the Red Cross set up a diaster center to serve
those whose homes were damaged.
   The tornado knocked out electrical service to 3,600 homes.
Alabama Power Co. brought in crews from neighboring towns and had
electrical service restored by 3:30 p.m. Sunday to every house
capable of receiving it, company spokeswoman Bunny Cox said.
   Two people were killed, one a 9-month-old child, and 11 others
were injured late Saturday when a tornado slashed through a rural
area north of Nettleton, Miss.
   ``We're told it hit right around midnight, and from what
observers say it touched down along an area about a quarter-mile
wide and three miles long,'' said Jim Maher, director of the
Mississippi Emergency Management Agency.
   Mississippi Gov. Ray Mabus cut short a trip outside the state to
tour the area.
   Tornadoes also were reported in Simpson, Bolivar, Sunflower and
Leake, with at least 25 houses damaged in Simpson County.
   Maher said 12 buildings _ six mobile homes, four homes and two
businesses _ were destroyed by the Nettleton twister. Twenty-two
other homes and two mobile homes were damaged, he said. A tornado in
Sunflower County destroyed a staff worker's home at the Mississippi
State Penitentiary at Parchman.
   Some minor lowland and street flooding also was reported around
Mississippi, with hail ranging up to the size of golf balls in some
areas, the weather service said. In the 24-hour period ending at 7
a.m. Sunday, 6.61 inches of rain was reported at White Oak, with
6.32 at D'Lo and 5.25 at Forest.
   Little Rock, Ark., got 4.08 inches of rain Saturday for a two-day
total of 11.09 inches, exceeding the city's previous record rainfall
for the entire month of November.
   Arkansas' heavy rain Friday and Saturday caused rivers to rise,
and the Ouachita River is expected to crest 10 feet above flood
stage Tuesday at Camden.
   In Lonoke, Ark., a town of 4,100 where a tornado Tuesday night
caused millions of dollars in damage, wind up to 50 mph and
torrential rain left about 3,600 residents without electricity
Saturday, said John Heuston, a spokesman for Arkansas Power & Light
Co.
   More than 50 people were evacuated in southeast Jonesboro, Ark.,
``because the water was coming into their houses,'' said John
Varner, a Craighead County deputy sheriff. Most evacuees were
sheltered at the homes of friends and relatives, he said.
   Three to 6 inches of rain doused south-central and western
Kentucky during the night and a temporary dam at a reservoir in
Campbellsville, Ky., broke early Sunday. No flooding or damage was
reported, said Mayor Robert Miller.
   The dam, which was holding back 7 feet of water that covered
about 80 acres, broke in small sections ``and it didn't come out as
one big gush of water,'' Miller said. One family evacuated Saturday
night returned home Sunday, he said.
   High wind accompanied by heavy rain ripped the roof off an empty
elementary school in McClellandtown, Pa., Sunday and caused
widespread damage throughout southwestern Pennsylvania.
   The brief storm also knocked down trees and blew out the windows
of homes.
   No injuries were reported.

<TEXT>
   Randy Newman's songs, many of them satirical or
from an off-the-wall point of view, probably need a format for
theater different from a revue where it's just ``and then he wrote
...''
   ``The Middle of Nowhere,'' which opened Sunday night at the
off-Broadway Astor Place Theater, has a novel format _ the
washed-up-on-a-desert-island idea combined with the old-time
minstrel show. It sounds chancy but it works quite well. It's
simpler than it sounds, too.
   Brief program notes explain about the sections in 19th century,
white-glove minstrel shows. This allows Newman songs to be grouped _
love songs, songs about misfits, songs about money _ for a reason.
   Roger Robinson is whittling in an unused bus station when Vondie
Curtis-Hall as a soldier, Michael Arkin as a salesman, Diana Castle
as a Baltimore-bound hitchhiker and Tony Hoylen, carrying beer cans
in a guitar case, come in out of the rain. This gives them
individual identity. Miss Castle, for instance, is the logical
singer of Newman's ``Baltimore.''
   The show's two most inspired theatrical strokes are during the
songs ``Short People'' and ``Lonely at the Top.'' As Curtis-Hall,
Arkin and Hoylen fervently spout the nonsensical prejudice in
``Short People,'' a carnival distorting mirror is slid in behind
them on stage, turning their own reflections into the object of
their prejudice.
   ``Lonely at the Top'' has its universality furthered by having it
sung by Robinson, dressed as a janitor and pushing a dustmop.
   Newman put sarcasm and deep satire in ``Song for the Dead.''
Curtis-Hall sings the show's most thoroughly serious song, in his
Army uniform.
   Most of Newman's songs are devised so the satire brings a smile.
Curtis-Hall glides through ``It's Money That I Love'' as a slick
dance number. Arkin becomes an ugly American for the selfish ``Roll
with the Punches.''
   ``They Just Got Married'' was probably included to show that,
with Newman, you can't guess the ending of a lyric. Hoylen gets to
sing the funny ``Maybe I'm Doing It Wrong'' and the pretty ``Marie.''
   Tracy Friedman conceived, wrote, directed and choreographed. The
Back of the Bus Band, not seen, plays instrumental accompaniment.
Producers are Frank Basile, Lewis Friedman, Tom O. Meyerhoff and
Albert Nocciolino. ``The Middle of Nowhere'' was first produced by
the Wisdom Bridge Theater in Chicago.
   There's a lot of entertainment to be had in an evening in this
Louisiana town so small ``the gas station went out of business when
the diner shut down.''

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gasoline prices at the nation's pumps dropped
an average two-tenths of a cent over the past two weeks because of a
drop in wholesale crude prices and a return to seasonal driving
habits, an analyst said Sunday.
   The Lundberg Survey, a sampling of 12,000 service stations
nationwide, showed the average retail price of gasoline was $1.0006
on Friday, said analyst Trilby Lundberg.
   The average retail price includes all grades of self- and
full-serve gasoline, all taxes, and all cash and credit sales, she
said.
   In the Nov. 4 survey, prices had climbed two-tenths of a cent
because of increased wholesale prices and heavy gasoline trading.
   Ms. Lundberg predicted further price cuts as wholesale prices
continue to drop and winter keeps motorists home.
   On Nov. 18, the average price at self-serve pumps for regular
unleaded gasoline was 90.62 cents a gallon; premium unleaded was
$1.0604 a gallon; and regular leaded was 86.77 cents a gallon.
   The average price at full-serve pumps for regular unleaded
gasoline was $1.1922 a gallon; premium unleaded was $1.3016 a
gallon; and regular leaded was $1.1627 a gallon.

<HEAD>Transport Strike Begins, Paralyzes Several Manila Districts</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: UPDATES throughout with strike in effect; no pickup</NOTE>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Armed soldiers guarded buses and
military trucks shuttled stranded commuters Monday as passenger jeep
drivers went on strike in the capital.
   Police and other officials said several routes were paralyzed
although service was operating near normal on others.
   The strike was called by PISTON, a militant association of about
25,000 passenger jeep drivers. The jeeps are the major means of
transport in the Philippines. Several other jeep associations have
announced they would join Monday's strike.
   PISTON has demanded a price roll-back of commodities and a
reduction in the cost of automotive spare parts following a
presidential decree last week to reduce fares.
   Mayor Jejomar Binay of Manila's financial district of Makati made
a last-minute appeal to striking drivers over government-run Radio
of Nation to end the strike.
   ``I wish to tell the drivers that they should give the government
a chance to prove its promises,'' Binay said. ``Prices of
commodities cannot be brought down overnight. We are doing our best
to bring prices of goods and spare down.''
   Patrolman Dick Calizo said at least 20 military trucks have been
sent out to help stranded passengers but no violence was reported as
of mid-morning.
   Classes at the University of Santo Tomas and other schools were
suspended for the day because of the strike.
   Radio DZMM said there had been reports of jeepney drivers
harassing other drivers who refused to join the strike which
resulted in several fistfights and stoning incidents.
   On Sunday, troops and police were placed on nationwide alert in
preparation for the transport strike and for celebrations marking
President Corazon Aquino's first 1,000 days in office, state-run
media reported.
   The state-run Philippines News Agency said Gen. Renato De Villa,
the military chief of staff, issued the order to prevent violence
during the strike.
   De Villa said armed troops would ride buses in the capital Monday
and that military trucks would prowl the streets to assist commuters
who may be stranded by the strike, government media said.
   Under the new transport fares, a passenger has to pay a minimum
of 3 cents for a 2.5-mile ride. The old rate was 4 cents, but
drivers actually charge a 5 cents.
   There was no explanation why the military was placed on alert
nationwide since the strike was called only for Manila and its
surrounding suburbs.
   But Monday marks Mrs. Aquino's first 1,000 days in office, and
military sources have said leftist or rightists opponents may try to
foment unrest to distract from official ceremonies marking the
benchmark date.
   Mrs. Aquino took office on Feb. 25, 1986, after a popular
uprising toppled the administration of Ferdinand Marcos and forced
the Philippine strongman to flee to exile in Hawaii.

   Here are some facts and figures on the Canadian election:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE STAKES _ Canadians are electing a House of Commons newly
expanded to 295 seats, so a party needs 148 seats to form a majority
government.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE VOTERS _ There are 17.1 million eligible voters. Polls open
from 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. in each district. Across the nation that means
they open at 7:30 a.m. EST in Newfoundland and close at 11 p.m. EST
in British Columbia.
   The first returns are expected about 9 p.m. EST, but it could be
well into the night before the outcome is clear. Voter turnout in
the last Canadian national election on Sept. 4, 1984, was 75 percent.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE MAJOR PARTIES _ They are the incumbent Progressive
Conservative Party led by Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, the
opposition Liberal Party led by John Turner and the socialist New
Democratic Party led by Ed Broadbent. In 1984, the Conservatives won
211 seats, the Liberals 40, the New Democrats 30, and there was one
independent. The House of Commons then had 282 seats.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE KEY ISSUE _ The free trade agreement with the United States
scheduled to take effect Jan. 1 overshadowed all other issues in the
seven-week campaign. The Conservatives say the agreement will
guarantee future Canadian prosperity by securing access to the
larger U.S. market. The Liberals and New Democrats oppose the pact,
saying it endangers Canadian sovereignty and such crucial social
programs as senior pensions and health care.
   The U.S. Congress has approved the agreement, but it still needs
final Canadian parliamentary approval. Only a Conservative majority
government ensures that the agreement will proceed.

<HEAD>Jackson Requests Meeting With Bush</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHARLES J. GANS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jesse Jackson said Sunday he was seeking a meeting
as soon as possible with President-elect George Bush to discuss
threatened farm foreclosures and the new administration's policy
toward South Africa.
   Jackson met with about 80 staff members, advisers and prominent
supporters to review the 1988 presidential campaign and to make
plans for his Rainbow Coalition political movement.
   At a news conference, Jackson urged Bush to speak out against
last week's treason conviction of four leading black activists who
belong to the United Democratic Front, South Africa's largest
anti-apartheid group.
   He also said that if Bush is committed to ``a kinder and gentler
nation'' he should call a moratorium on the foreclosures of family
farms.
   Earlier this month, the Farmers Home Administration began mailing
notices to more than 80,000 farmers who are past due on loans that
they risk foreclosure proceedings if they do not make arrangements
for settling their debts.
   ``We hope to meet with Mr. Bush at the earliest possible date to
put some primary focus on his making a statement appealing for mercy
and reasoning in South Africa, and mercy for the 90,000 family
farmers who received their notices ... one week after the
election,'' said Jackson.
   He planned to telephone Bush to ask for a meeting, said Jackson
spokesman Eric Easter.
   Jackson said he will be focusing next year on supporting
candidates whom he considers progressive in mayoral elections in
Chicago, New York, Los Angeles and other major cities.
   The former Democratic presidential hopeful said the Rainbow
Coalition would push its demands for an effective anti-drug
campaign, a higher minimum wage, a national health care system,
improved child care, and simplified, same-day voter registration
procedures.
   Jackson denied that liberal positions were responsible for
Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis' loss to Bush, because the party
made gains in congressional and local races.

   Egypt said it recognized the newly proclaimed
Palestinian state on Sunday and expressed hopes the declaration
would contribute to peace and stability in the region.
   China also announced Sunday it had decided to recognize the newly
declared state, its Foreign Ministry was quoted as saying.
   Egypt's statement came a few hours after Israel's ambassador,
Moshe Shamir, called on Foreign Minister Esmatt Abdel-Meguid to
brief him on the Israeli government's position regarding the newly
proclaimed state.
   The Palestine National Council, the PLO's parliament-in-exile,
proclaimed the state on Tuesday and also endorsed U.N. resolutions
242 and 338, implying recognition of the state of Israel.
   Israel has officially rejected the move, saying the Palestine
Liberation Organization has not explicitly recognized Israel nor
renounced terrorism.
   An Egyptian government communique said that ``as Egypt blesses
this constructive step, it hopes that it (the proclamation) would
serve the cause of peace and stability in the region.''
   The Chinese statement, carried by the official Xinhua News
Agency, said: ``The Chinese government, with full respect for the
choice made by the Palestinian people, has decided to recognize the
state of Palestine.''
   An initial Foreign Ministry reaction on Wednesday stopped short
of explicitly recognizing the new state but called for ``friendship
between the peoples of China and the state of Palestine.''
   In Jerusalem, Foreign Minister Shimon Peres said Sunday he
regrets Egypt's decision. ``I regret it very much,'' he told
reporters.
   Peres said he had to study the Egyptian statement before making
further comment.
   Israeli officials have argued that Egypt would violate the 1978
Camp David accords between Israel and Egypt if it recognized the
Palestinian state.
   The U.S.-mediated Camp David pact called for the final status of
the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip to be negotiated in peace
talks among parties to the Middle East conflict.
   The Egyptian statement, read to reporters and carried by the
state-run Middle East News Agency, said the recognition should be
effective Nov. 15, the day the PLO body proclaimed the state.
   The statement complained that ``some quarters'' have persisted in
casting doubt on Egypt's position of support.
   ``To uproot these doubts ... Egypt hereby affirms its recognition
of the Palestinian independent state according to the points that
came in the political statement issued by the PNC and considers this
recognition effective since Nov. 15.''
   On Saturday, the agency quoted President Hosni Mubarak as
expressing Egypt's recognition of the Palestinian state, but later
it amended its report, saying the word ``recognition'' was incorrect
and that Mubarak had only declared support for the establishment of
the state.
   More than 30 countries, mostly Moslem, have recognized the
Palestinian state.
   PLO chief Yasser Arafat pressed his efforts Sunday to gain more
recognition. He and Iraqi President Saddam Hussein urged non-aligned
countries to recognize fully the newly declared state, the Iraqi
News Agency reported.
   Monitored in Nicosia, the agency said both voiced ``satisfaction
over the historical decisions'' taken by the Palestine National
Council. The two were meeting in Baghdad.
   King Hussein of Jordan said Sunday the PLO has met U.S.
conditions to join in Arab-Israeli peace talks and suggested Israel
and the United States were blocking peace.
   ``I believe the PLO has gone as far as it was asked to go and has
contributed its share for progress toward a just and comprehensive
peace,'' he said on CBS television's ``Face the Nation.''

   China has decided to recognize the newly declared
independent state of Palestine, the Foreign Ministry said Sunday.
   ``The 19th special session of the Palestine National Council held
in Algiers on Nov. 15, 1988 proclaimed the founding of the state of
Palestine,'' the ministry said in a statement carried by the
official Xinhua News Agency.
   ``The Chinese government, with full respect for the choice made
by the Palestinian people, has decided to recognize the state of
Palestine.''
   China has long been a strong supporter of the Palestinian
Liberation Organization and Arab causes. It has said it will not
form diplomatic relations with Israel until the Israeli government
returns land seized during the 1967 Israel-Arab War.
   An initial Foreign Ministry reaction on Wednesday stopped short
of explicitly recognizing the new state but called for ``friendship
between the peoples of China and the state of Palestine.''
   The Palestine National Council, legislative wing of the PLO,
declared a new Palestine state with Jerusalem as its capital.
   More than 30 nations, most of them Moslem, said they recognized
the declaration.

   Government officials accused rebel forces
Sunday of firing the missile that hit a plane with the nation's
defense minister and other top-ranking military officials aboard.
   Brig. Gen. Mohamed Osman Malik, the military command spokesman,
said the SAM-7 surface-to-air missile was fired Saturday by rebels
of the Sudan People's Liberation Army.
   The pilot of the damaged Hercule C-130, which carried Defense
Minister Abdul-Maguid Khalil and military Commander-in-chief Gen.
Fathi Ahmed Ali, managed to land without any injuries. The plane had
just taken off from Wau in southern Sudan's Bahr el-Ghazal region.
   The attack came a day after a tentative cease-fire agreement was
signed in the Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa between rebel leader
John Garang and a delegation from the second-largest partner in
Sudanese Prime Minister Sadek Mahdi's coalition cabinet. Mahdi
supports the agreement, but his ministers have not yet voted on it.
   The prime minister said Sunday that the attack proves the
southern-based rebels do not really want peace. ``The rebel movement
is not serious about its peace claims,'' he said. ``It has lost
credibility.''
   The rebels are demanding economic and social reforms for their
region.

<HEAD>Oil Strike Leaders Urge Locals to End Crushing Strike</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leaders of the nation's worst oil
strike called for local unions Sunday to accept a government offer
and return to work. They declared their strike a political success.
   The recommendation came after stocks of kitchen gas and diesel
fuel fell to critically low levels. In the northeast, bottled
cooking gas was rationed to one canister per household, and
elsewhere Brazilians waited in long lines or paid black-market rates
for a single canister.
   The Strike Command of the National Oil Workers recommended that
local unions accept the government's proposal for a 15 percent pay
raise. Strikers had asked for 26 percent.
   Unions nationwide were to vote through early Monday on whether to
follow the National Command directive, according to Command director
Carlos Gomes. He spoke to The Associated Press by phone from
Brasilia.
   ``We believe the government proposal is reasonable, although it
isn't ideal,'' Gomes said. ``We consider the strike, politically,
has been a complete success.
   ``We expect strikers will vote to go back to work (Monday),'' he
said.
   On Saturday, Petrobras, the government-run monopoly that runs
petroleum drilling and production, offered workers the pay raise to
make up for losses caused by a 1,000-percent annual rate of
inflation. Petrobras also said it would pay wages for five of 10
days workers have been striking, not punish strikers, and consider
rehiring workers fired in another walkout.
   Brazil has suffered a recent wave of strikes caused by a
sputtering economy under President Jose Sarney. The strikers have
included national park employees, doctors and nurses at
government-run clinics, electricity workers, subway personnel,
steelworkers and federal employees in at least 17 of 26 ministries.
   Civilian Liaison Minister, Ronaldo Costa Couto, told journalists
Sunday he hoped strikers would return to work Monday. He said the 15
percent wage increase represented ``the limit of government
possibilities.''
   During the strike, emergency stocks of cooking gas and diesel
fuel have been imported from Argentina, Venezuela and Algeria.
Gasoline supplies were expected to last another 20 days.
   Of Brazil's 10 refineries, three were partially operating Sunday,
and petroleum production stood at 350,000 barrels per day. At full
capacity, Brazilian refineries produce 1.5 million barrels daily.

third bid to deport Doherty to Britain.</NOTE>

<DATELINE>KEARNY, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When Joe Doherty broke out of a maximum
security prison in Northern Ireland seven years ago, the Irish
Republican Army's underground network of safehouses and sympathizers
led him to this working class, Irish-American suburb of New York.
   Doherty had been convicted with three others of killing a British
army officer in a 1980 shootout.
   In Kearny, he lived with an American girlfriend, worked in
construction and took a part-time job at Clancy's Bar in Manhattan.
   ``It was sort of like being normal for once ... having a job and
knowing you're not going to get assassinated or stopped in the
streets because of your religion,'' Doherty said in a recent
interview at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan.
   On June 28, 1983, a group of FBI agents walked into Clancy's,
ordered a round of beers and took him into custody again.
   Since then, the case has grown to involve the the White House,
the Justice Department, civil rights activists, and the leaders of
Great Britain and Ireland.
   Doherty doesn't deny being involved in the killing but says it
was a political act and that he warrants political asylum in the
United States.
   The government disagrees. The Justice Department calls Doherty a
terrorist and says he should be deported to Britain.
   ``The question of who gets political asylum and who is a refugee
should be based on the law, on facts and on circumstances,'' said
Mary Pike, Doherty's lawyer. ``But the question really depends on
which government you're fleeing. If it's a government with which the
Reagan administration wants to remain friendly, then you can't get
asylum.''
   ``If I was a Cuban,'' said Doherty, ``there's no way I would be
deported.''
   Doherty, a bachelor, has spent the better part of his 33 years in
hiding or in prison. He joined the IRA in 1969, the year British
troops were sent to the province to quell sectarian violence between
Protestant and Catholic.
   ``I'd watched my father live his life as a second-class citizen,
and tell me to learn a trade and then emigrate,'' said Doherty. ``I
didn't want to tell my son at 17 that he had to go to Canada to find
a job because of his religion.''
   While lawyers debate his case, Doherty has spent the past five
years in a 12-foot-by-6-foot cell at the federal prison in New York.
   ``I see this case as a complete rejection of the Constitution by
the government,'' said Paul O'Dwyer, a civil rights attorney in New
York. ``There is no other prisoner I know of who has been held for
such a protracted period of time having committed no crime in the
United States.''
   Tom Moseley, a former Justice Department attorney who handled the
Doherty case, said the bottom line is that Doherty is a terrorist
who killed someone.
   ``We felt he should have been extradited to the U.K. on the
grounds of murder and assault,'' said Moseley, now in private
practice in Morristown.
   Some who sympathize with the IRA's goal of uniting the Republic
of Ireland with the northern six counties that make up the British
province of Northern Ireland consider Doherty a folk hero.
   The Justice Department went to court last year to stop
Philadelphians from naming Doherty honorary grand marshal of their
St. Patrick's Day parade.
   ``Free Joe Doherty'' graffiti adorns walls and sidewalks all over
New York City. At a New Jersey bar not far from where Doherty lived,
his picture hangs alongside that of Bobby Sands, the IRA prisoner
who starved to death during a 1981 hunger strike at a British prison.
   Among Doherty's supporters are New York's Roman Catholic
Archbishop Cardinal John O'Connor, Amnesty International, the
American Civil Liberties Union and the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who
visited Doherty in prison in July.
   But there also are influential forces fighting for Doherty's
extradition.
   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher raised the case in talks
with President Reagan during a 1986 visit to Washington.
   Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., described the jailed IRA man as ``an
Irish Ghengis Khan.'' Lugar led a successful fight to exclude the
political exception clause from the century-old U.S.-British
extradition treaty when it was renegotiated in 1986.
   The British government filed a formal request for Doherty's
extradition in 1983. It was denied in December 1984 by U.S. District
Judge John E. Sprizzo in Brooklyn, who ruled that Doherty's crime
was a political act and qualified the defendant for political asylum.
   The government appealed and U.S. District Judge Charles S. Haight
decided in Doherty's favor. A government appeal to the U.S. Court of
Appeals in New York upheld Doherty's previous victories.
   Having failed to extradite Doherty, the Justice Department began
deportation proceedings.
   Since the law says deportees can choose where they are sent,
Doherty chose the independent Republic of Ireland and his decision
was upheld by immigration Judge Howard I. Cohen in 1986.
   ``If I was sent back to Ireland, I would be arrested and put in
jail,'' Doherty said. ``But hopefully it would be a humane place and
I would get a fair hearing, not like in the north.''
   The administration, this time through the Immigration and
Naturalization Service, appealed Cohen's order and again lost. Two
more appeals and two more government defeats followed, the latest
coming Nov. 14.
   Meanwhile, the Republic of Ireland, under pressure from London
and Washington, in December 1987 ratified the European Convention on
Terrorism, which calls for mandatory extradition of those deemed
terrorists. That eliminated Doherty's Irish option.
   Today, Doherty is pinning his hopes on winning asylum, though
after 5{ years of court battles, he isn't too optimistic about his
chances for freedom.
   ``I go to court. I win,'' he says. ``But here I am.''

   Editors of tiny Dollars & Sense magazine
take no small pride in the fact their October 1987 cover story
predicting financial upheaval was followed within days by the stock
market crash.
   ``We were kind of proud of that,'' said Arthur MacEwan, who
helped found the 8,000-circulation magazine in 1974. ``Here we had a
cover that came out and said `Crash' in the first week of October
and that's when it happened.''
   Dollars & Sense is published by a collective of journalists and
economists who offer an unabashedly socialist perspective on
capitalism and its social implications.
   But far from being hell-bent for a systemic collapse, the editors
hope the nationally circulated magazine is used by trade unions,
students and others to gain insight into financial complexities.
   ``We advocate more democratic openness in the economy,'' said
staff editor Vince Valvano. ``We generally feel that people should
have more input, whether it's about the specifics of their job or
how decisions are made in a corporation they work for.''
   He said Dollars & Sense is unique in helping to make
understandable for regular working people the economic issues that
he claims are covered in business magazines and newspaper sections
``as if they're intended for managers, business owners, investors.''
   MacEwan, a former economics professor at Harvard College who now
teaches at the University of Massachusetts in Boston, said: ``We
attempt to focus a lot on the way people themselves affect economic
events. We don't simply look at people as being affected by this
abstraction of the economy.''
   The collective says the ``Crash'' cover story was less an uncanny
prediction than a warning of economic trends creating greater
divisions between the rich and the poor.
   ``If you read it you recognized that we were not claiming to be
predictors of the short-run movement of the economy,'' MacEwan said.
``There was obviously a lot of luck in the particular timing of that
issue.''
   The collective, which is based in a former church that also
houses a collection of other leftist groups in this working class
city's Union Square, also publishes ``Real World Macro,'' an
economics reader for classroom use.
   Among Dollars & Sense's boosters are economist John Kenneth
Galbraith, journalist Alexander Cockburn and Democratic U.S. Rep.
Ron Dellums of California.
   ``It isn't caught up in the established cliches of economic and
financial reporting,'' Galbraith said in a recent telephone
interview. ``There's no field in which this is more important.''
   ``The overall philosophy is that there are serious problems with
capitalism,'' said staff editor Tim Wise. ``The coming crash wasn't
so much a prediction as an examination of the underlying instability
in the economy.''
   Although the economic fallout from the crash was less than some
expected, MacEwan says the national deficit, trade deficit and
foreign debt are looming problems.
   ``We were not the only ones saying this, although the media in
general and the common feeling is a very Pollyanna-ish one that
somehow as long as the stock market crash hasn't reoccured in a few
months everything is fine again,'' he said.
   The monthly magazine's philosophy may be best conveyed by a
direct-mail campaign envelope featuring two tuxedo-clad party-goers
holding goblets of champagne. It reads: ``They threw a party. You
weren't invited. Now they want you to pay the bill.''
   ``We generally attract those who are frustrated they don't see
more analysis and information on economic affairs in progressive
publications, and mainstream publications present only a mainstream
business-oriented view,'' Wise said.

<HEAD>Tyson Extends Holly Farms Offer; Will Challenge Provisions Of
ConAgra Deal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHARLES W. BURTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LITTLE ROCK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tyson Foods Inc. on Sunday extended its $941
million hostile buyout offer for Holly Farms Corp., and said it
planned to sue to block key provisions of Holly Farms' white knight
merger with rival ConAgra.
   Tyson, the nation's largest poultry processor, was stung Thursday
when Memphis, Tenn.-based Holly Farms said it had agreed to be
acquired by ConAgra in a stock swap valued at about $1 billion.
   Tyson extended its $52 a share offer, which was to expire last
Friday, through 5 p.m. EST Dec. 16, said James B. Blair, the
company's general counsel.
   Blair also said that about 3.3 million, or 18.2 percent, of Holly
Farms' 18.1 million outstanding common shares had been tendered
under its offer as of Friday.
   Blair said Tyson would sue in Delaware Chancery Court to block a
so-called lockup option giving ConAgra the right to buy key Holly
Farms assets in the event a third company acquires Holly Farms, and
the ``bustup fee'' Holly Farms has agreed to pay ConAgra if their
merger falls through.
   Such merger provisions frequently are used to discourage rival
bidders from continuing their pursuit of a company.
   ``They've taken the best part of the company, the part we want
the worst, and put an option price to ConAgra at less than its
market value,'' Blair said in a telephone interview. ``That option
triggers if their merger if defeated for some reason. What that is
doing is depriving the Holly shareholder of the right to make a
choice.
   The option covers two Texas processing plants and their support
systems, including breeder flocks and hatcheries, Blair said. The
two plants are the lowest-cost producers held by Holly Farms, he
said. Also included are Holly Farms' biggest processing and cooking
plants in North Carolina and the best piece of the company's food
service business.
   ``That isn't all their chicken business, but it's the best,''
Blair said.
   Under the terms of the proposed ConAgra merger, Holl Farms
stockholders would receive the equivalent of $59.25 worth of ConAgra
stock for each share of Holly Farms, based on the average stock
price to be set shortly before shareholders meet to approve the plan.
   Based on stock prices last week, the deal would be worth about $1
billion.
   Telephone calls to the headquarters of ConAgra, in Omaha, Neb.,
and Holly Farms went unanswered Sunday night.
   Holly Farms shares fell 37{ cents to $51.50 a share Friday on the
New York Stock Exchange, while ConAgra shares dipped 12{ cents to
$27.50. Tyson shares rose 50 cents to $15.62{ a share in national
over the counter trading.
