<HEAD>Report: West German Tapped Into U.S. Military Computers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For nearly two years, a West German citizen
gained access to more than 30 computers belonging to the U.S.
military and military contractors, according to a published report.
   The New York Times reported in Monday's editions that the West
German searched for data related to nuclear weapons, intelligence
satellites, the Strat=e Initiative, the space shuttle and
the North American Air Defense Command.
   The Times, quoting computer security experts, said he did not
gain access to any classified information or break into a
``secure'' government computer where classified information is
stored.
   An FBI spokesman confirmed Sunday that the matter was under
investigation.
   A West German magazine, Quick, detailed the case last week and
identified the intruder as Mathias Speer, 24, a computer science
student in Hanover. The FBI would not confirm his identity, the
Times said.
   The electronic break-ins may have gone on for a year before
being discovered in August 1986, the newspaper said.
   They were monitored for a year and traced, the Times said, and
in June 1987, the West German and an American who may have been an
accomplice apparently were questioned by authorities. The break-ins
stopped about the same time.
   ``This kind of penetration could clearly have been used for
espionage,'' Peter G. Neumann, a computer security expert familiar
with the case, told the Times. ``I think most of the attacks before
this have been relatively benign on a global scale. This one is
much more insidious.''
   Computer managers at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory in
Berkeley, Calif., which is involved in broad-based unclassified
scientific research, discovered the intrusions, the Times said.
   The laboratory and its sister institution, the Lawrence
Livermore Laboratory, which is involved nuclear weapons research
and SDI, are operated by the University of California for the
federal government.
   The break-ins involved a variety of U.S. military computer
systems in this country, Europe and Japan, the Times said,
including systems at the Naval Coastal Systems Command in Panama
City, Fla., the Air Force Systems Command in El Segundo, Calif.,
the Pentagon's Optimus data base and NASA's Jet Propulsion
Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif.

   A medical evacuation xwzaking an injured
motorcyclist to a hospital crashed Sunday in a fog-shrouded
mountain pass, killing the pilot and a nurse, authorities said.
   The patient, the only other person aboard, survived, perhaps
because he was strapped down in the aircraft's midsection, said
county fire Capt. Tom Andreas.
   The helicopter hit a power line in Cajon Pass in the Lost Lake
area of San Bernardino County, 60 miles northeast of Los Angeles,
Andreas said.
   ``When the craft came down, it hit a rock wall and went over an
embankment,'' Andreas said.
   The pilot and nurr=wzified as David Skala, 40, of Los
Alamitos and Cheryl Collins, 40, of Hesperia, sheriff's Deputy Paul
Cook said. They were dead when rescuers arrived.
   The injured motorcyclist, a 26-year-old man whose name was
withheld until relatives could be contacted, was flown to San
Bernardino County Medical Center, where he was listed in critical
condition, said a nursing supervisor who wouldn't give her name.
   ``There were heavy clouds, fog and generally very bad weather in
the pass,'' Andreas said.
   The helicopter apparently was trying to turn around to avoid the
fog when it crashed, said county sheriff's Lt. Mike Stodelle.
   The motorcyclist had suffered head and neck injuries in a crash
in the Mojave Desert near Interstate 15 north of Victorville.
Although Andreas said he had been strapped in, authorities found
him ``sitting in a patch of sand in a creek bed'' near the downed
craft, Stodelle said.
   ``He was alive, awake and incoherent,'' Stodelle said.
   The helicopter was owned by Medical Air Transport of Riverside,
where a spokesman said no information was available.

<HEAD>Apology, Videotape Wins Child Rapist Probation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A firefighter who pleaded guilty to
raping a young girl has agreed to make of videotape of his
confession in order to warn parents that respectable people can be
child abusers, officials said.
   John Roper was given probation after he agreed to make the tape
and to apologize for saying he had been falsely accused.
   ``Roper represents a typical child molester that is so difficult
to convict,'' Deputy District Attorney Bob McGregor said.
   ``He's nice looking, had a good job, had children of his own,
well-thought of in the community. People want to believe that the
only ones who molest children are the dirty-old men in raincoats.''
   Roper pleaded guilty to first-degree rape. He was charged last
year with first-degree rape and first-degree sexual assault in a
case involving an 11-year-old girl.
   Circuit Judge Joseph Jasper, who had sentenced Roper to 15 years
in prison, earlier this month granted him probation. The sexual
abuse charge was dropped as part of the plea bargain.
   Roper must make the apology tonight to his former co-workers at
a fire house in suburban Hoover for saying the victim's mother
fabricated the story.
   The videotape must be made at his expense by July and will be
used by Prescott House, a center for child abuse victims, to
educate the public about child sex abuse.
   The victim's mother said her agreement to probation was based on
concern about her child having to testify in a trial and her belief
that the videotape would help other children.
   ``All children in Alabama would benefit,'' she said.
   Defense attorney Doug Jones called the case a breakthrough.
   ``The ultimate outcome offers a significant way to help the
community with regard to these cases,'' Jones said. ``We gave up
some things. They gave up some things.''
   Jones said Roper, who resigned as a firefighter, already has
been punished.
   The probation agreement requires Roper to seek psychiatric help,
which Jones said Roper began receiving last year.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON WIRE: Without a Vote Cast, Dukakis Adds 105 Delegates</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JONATHAN WOLMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   On the one hand, Michael Dukakis has won all
of two elections in a row and on a good day he draws maybe half the
crowd and a quarter of the enthusiasm of Jesse Jackson.
   On the other hand, over the past 12 days Dukakis won an
invisible primary the size of New Jersey and quietly boosted his
claim on the Democratic presidential nomination.
   In the hiatus between Wisconsin's primary almost two weeks ago
and Tuesday's voting in New York, Dukakis picked up pledges from
105 national convention delegates, and he won another 22 in
Saturday's Arizona caucuses.
   ``He's being called `El Nuevo Kennedy' in the barrios around
Phoenix,'' the governor's Western coordinator, Richard Ybarra,
enthused after Dukakis defeated Jackson and shut out Sen. Albert
Gore Jr. in Arizona.
   All told, the Massachusetts governor stretched his delegate
margin from a measly 36 to a more substantial 134.
   Where did all these delegates come from?
   Half came from Puerto Rico, where Gov. Rafael Hernandez-Colon
delivered his blessing and 52 previously uncommitted delegates.
   But the 53 other pledges may prove more significant, for they
may signify the first rumblings of an establishment bandwagon.
   They came from among the so-called super delegates, Democratic
party leaders and officeholders who are beholden to no one and free
to vote their consciences _ or to sniff the political winds.
   The nomination of Dukakis seems all but inevitable _ except when
you consider that he faces a stiff test from Jackson on Tuesday in
New York and his 872-delegate total remains far below the 2,082
needed to win nomination in Atlanta.
   ``The popular wisdom is that Mike has been a front-runner from
the beginning in New York ... (but) I said 10 weeks ago that you
should not take the polls too seriously and that Jesse could win,''
Gov. Mario Cuomo says of the Dukakis-Jackson battle. ``I don't
think anything has changed since then.''
   Gore is the wild card. If he does well, it could hurt Dukakis.
   ``I don't think there's any doubt that he (Gore) is stronger now
than he was a couple of weeks ago,'' Cuomo said Sunday. ``Jesse is
doing well because he draws crowds, they're enthusiastic and that
may be the very best barometer of all.''
   Dukakis, concerned that his ethnic support may be soft and his
backers must be motivated to vote, had some influential surrogates
campaigning in New York City on Sunday.
   He brought in one of the not-so-nuevo Kennedys, Sen. Edward
Kennedy of Massachusetts, for a bring-out-the-vote effort and after
marching in a ``Salute to Israel'' parade, he attended a Gaelic
football game and a reception with Gov. Hernandez-Colon.
   Gore was touring Hispanic, Italian and Jewish neighborhoods
while Jackson met with community leaders in a session set up by one
of his most prominent Jewish supporters.
   Yet for all the attention, New York is not the only election
being held Tuesday _ congressional Democrats will caucus Tuesday
and Wednesday to choose their super delegates to the Atlanta
convention.
   Most members were ``nominated'' in closed-door party meetings
last week and Dukakis did very well on both sides of the Capitol,
even in the Senate, which is home to two of his remaining rivals.
   Most Senate delegates remain uncommitted, but nine are lined up
with Dukakis. Gore picked up just four pledges from his colleagues,
as well as his own, and Sen. Paul Simon _ who doggedly maintains a
one-state strategy _ had two pledges, his own and that of fellow
Illinois Sen. Alan Dixon.
   Jackson won no pledges from the Senate but fared better in the
House, where 142 member-delegates are still uncommitted. Dukakis
has pledges from 26, Jackson 15, Gore 12 and Simon 10 (most of them
from Illinois).
   These super delegate pledges provide timely assistance for
Dukakis because while he's favored to win New York, has there ever
been a more invisible front-runner?
   The crowds drawn to Jackson, and the New York City mayor _ Ed
Koch _ drawn to Gore practically drove Dukakis off the local
newscasts, except when he was under attack by the Tennessee senator.
   Delegate counters for the Massachusetts governor do not expect
anyone, no matter who wins, to pick up more than 150 of the 255
delegates at stake in New York. But that's a lot of delegates in
the splintered Democratic environment _ it would put Dukakis almost
halfway to a nominating majority.

<TEXT>
   Former television evangelist Pat Robertson
insists he's not one for ``tilting at windmills,'' but his refusal
to lay down his lance formally is posing a few tactical problems
for Vice President George Bush.
   For one thing, it may be helping to keep President Reagan on the
sidelines, even though Robertson's campaign poses no real obstacle
to Bush's march to the GOP nomination.
   Reagan vowed to remain neutral in the contest so long as there
was a battle among Republicans, even though his active support for
Bush was a foregone conclusion.
   After Bush's main competitor, Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas, dropped
out, the White House hinted that Reagan wanted to start stumping
for Bush. But so far he hasn't scheduled any appearances.
   Bush has 922 delegates and after the New York primary on Tuesday
may have as many as 970 _ within easy grasp of the 1,039 needed for
the Republican nomination. By contrast, Robertson has a scant 17
delegates.
   Bush is still behaving as if he has some competition for the
nomination. He campaigned last week in New York, and today begins
an Ohio and Pennsylvania swing in anticipation of primaries in
those states in the next two weeks.
   Robertson's vow to ``energize people who support me'' on issues
also raises the possibility of a platform battle at the GOP
convention, one Bush strategists would like to avoid.
   For his part, Robertson has made no effort to contact Bush or to
try to mend fences, according to the Bush camp.
   ``I think he's plowed under,'' Bush said in a recent
conversation with reporters on Air Force II.
   Asked if some prominent Republican, perhaps Dole, might serve as
a mediator between the two camps, Bush said: ``We don't need any
mediation. We need our facts clear.''
   Bush still has not spoken to Robertson, even though the two were
back-to-back speakers last Friday before the American Association
of Newspaper Editors in Washington.
   Robertson still appears to be smarting at the drubbing he
received from Bush, insisting to the newspaper executives on Friday
that there were ``no differences in either education or income
level'' of those supporting him and those supporting Bush.
   The major difference, Robertson suggested, is that ``George Bush
was regarded as Reagan the Second, or whatever, so they were voting
again for the man who they have voted for twice before _
Reagan-Bush. I don't think anybody could have done much better.''
   ``I'm not Don Quixote. I don't believe in tilting at windmills.
It's obvious from the delegate count that has come out that George
Bush is going to be the nominee....''
   But still, Robertson remains the only candidate of the original
five Republicans challenging Bush for the nomination to persist in
the face of the vice president's steamrolling candidacy. Dole,
former Delaware Gov. Pete du Pont, former Secretary of State
Alexander Haig Jr. and Rep. Jack Kemp of New York have all formally
withdrawn, releasing their delegates in the process.
   Suggestions that Robertson feels he has been unfairly treated in
the process ``are absurd,'' Bush has said.
   Bush spokesman Peter Teeley said no efforts have been made by
Bush or his advisers to try to persuade Robertson to bow out
gracefully.
   ``It would not be proper,'' Teeley said.
   However, the aide said, ``His campaign for the most part is
dormant. He's doing very little traveling. It's almost as if his
campaign is nonexistent.''
   Robertson's campaign has acknowledged he has spent nearly all
the money allowed for the primary season under federal spending
limits. He has laid off most of his staff and confined his
campaigning to an occasional trip.
   As for Reagan's non-participation, Teeley suggested that might
change ``once we have the delegates to go over the top.''
   According to an Associated Press delegate count, that will come
no later than May 3 _ possibly even sooner};klZkl[ C

   Turnout at tonight's Democratic presidential
caucuses in Delaware is expected to hit a record high due to an
organizing drive by backers of Jesse Jackson, the state's party
chief said.
   At the 41 caucuses, held by state representative district, 189
delegates will be chosen to the state convention May 23. There, the
party will choose 15 of its 19 delegates to the Democratic national
convention.
   Four of the delegate slots automatically go to the state
chairman, vice chairwoman, the national committeeman and national
committeewoman.
   Samuel Shipley, state party chairman, said normal caucus turnout
is about 2 percent of the state's 135,000 registered Democrats.
This year, though, he predicts a 3 percent or 4 percent turnout _
which would be a record _ due to a big push by Jackson's backers.
   ``The Jackson people are very organized and have been for three
or four months. They've had a major presence on a local level,''
Shipley said.
   ``We have an inspiring and fervent and committed group of people
who think this is going to be a Jackson state,'' said Vivian
Houghton, the Delaware co-coordinator for Jackson.
   Those attending the caucuses will split into groups based on
their preference for president, including those uncommitted. Any
candidate, including uncommitteds, who gets at least 15 percent of
the vote will be awarded delegates to the state convention.
   Ms. Houghton said the Jackson campaign has been active in
Delaware since September. She said she expects the predominantly
black 2nd and 3rd representative districts in Wilmington to go to
Jackson, but she also predicted he om_Oo@ghout the
state.
   Organizers for Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis have been in
the state for about a month. Cynthia R. Drucker, Dukakis' state
director, saiw~@rces caused a late start, but was
upbeat about her candidate's prospects.
   ``We have a good organization in place. We're going district by
district to get the message out to Delaware Democrats. It's a
message of a candidate that can beat Bush in November,'' she said.
   Sen. Albert Gore Jr. has no organization in Delaware.
   The Republicans have been holding caucuses since April 5. On
April 25, they will select delegates to the party's state
convention May 14.
   The Delaware GOP had campaigned for former Gov. Pete du Pont
while the state's Democrats threw their support behind Sen. Joseph
R. Biden Jr. Both home-state candidates subsequently dropped out of
their respective races.

<HEAD>Study: Hospitals Made $2 Billion on Unneeded Stays</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY ESTILL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal investigators havr evidence suggesting
the nation's hospitals are making billions of dollars extra by
admitting patients who could be treated better and cheaper without
hospitalization.
   A draft report prepared by the inspector general's office of the
Department of Health and Human Services concludes that hospitals
probably were paid about $2 billion by Medicare in 1985 to treat
patients who should not have been hospitalized in the first place.
   ``Although an estimated $939 million would have been spent
providing care to these patients in other medical settings,
reducing unnecessary admissions to hospitals is one of the most
effective ways of saving Medicare dollars,'' says the report, a
copy of which was obtained by The Associated Press.
   The analysis was based on 7,050 patient records at 214 randomly
selected hospitals from October 1984 to March 1985. It concluded
that 740 admissions, or 10.5 percent, were unnecessary.
   There is potential financial incentive to admit patients who do
not need hospitalization under a plan established by Congress in
1983 which sets a fixed payment for each of 475 diagnosis related
groups _ or DRGs, as they are known in the industry.
   A hospital receives the same payment for each admission for a
particular diagnosis regardless of the actual services provided or
length of time a patient spends in the hospital.
   ``Hospitals retain a profit when patient care costs less than
the DRG payment, but must absorb losses when costs are higher than
the DRG,'' the report noted.
   Against that background, the study found that the average length
of stay for the unnecessary admissions was 4.4 days, compared with
7.6 days for necessary admissions.
   ``Most of the unnecessary admissions needed medical attention,
but not in an acute care setting,'' the report said. It placed
nearly 78 percent in that category, but concluded that almost 12
percent of the patients did not require immediate treatment of any
kind when they were admitted.
   Most of the other medically unnecessary admissions were classed
as either ``social admissions,'' such as temporarily hospitalizing
an elderly person because he or she did not have any other place to
stay, or instances of frail people being hospitalized when they
should have been admitted to a nursing home instead.
   Only 25 of the 214 hospitals studies had no unnecessary
admissions, according to the report, but there was wide variation
in the rates of unnec? admissions for the others. For example, at
least half the admissions were judged unnecessary at two hospitals
and at least a third at eight other institutions. Twenty percent or
more of the sampled admissions at 34 hospitals were found
unnecessary.
   No individual hospitals were named in the study. Neither were
any variations among states or regions of the country detailed.
   The overall 10.5 percent unnecessary admissions rate for the
cases sampled is far higher than the maximum 2.5 percent
unnecessary admission rate reported to the Health Care Financing
Administration by any of the state peer review organizations the
federal agency pays to police hospitals.
   One of the major recommendations in the report is that the
Health Care Financing Administration, which oversees Medicare and
Medicaid, determine why those peer review organizations identify a
substantially lower rate of unnecessary admissions than the
inspector general's survey found, and require them to adopt more
effective screening techniques.
   The inspector general's report found the unnecessary admissions
tended to be concentrated in five diagnostic groups: back problems,
diabetes, bone cancer, digestive disorders and upper respiratory
tract infections.
   The study methodology involved selecting hospitals at random to
reflect the overall numbers of small, medium and large hospitals.
   Registered nurses were hired to screen records using objective
screening techniques approved by the Health Care Financing
Administration. If a case looked suspect, it was referred to a
physician for review.
   ``Reviewers ignored marginal problems or cases involving honest
differences in medical judgment about appropriate case
management,'' the report said.
   Moreover, if documentation in the record was so poor reviewers
could not make a determination, it was given the benefit of doubt
and considered a necessary admission.

<HEAD>Dukakis Makes Ethnic Rounds in New York</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   From Hispanic and Irish wards of the Bronx to
Jewish crowds in Manhattan, Democrat Michael Dukakis has reveled in
this city's ethnic diversity while urging supporters not to be
overconfident in Tuesday's crucial New York primary.
   After a Sunday of campaigning across New York City under a
brilliant spring sky, Dukakis was skipping around the state today
to deliver final arguments that he would make the strongest
Democratic presidential nominee.
   As he did, Dukakis' organization was concluding two weeks of
telephone calls to a half-million likely Democratic voters in a
targeted effort to remind them to turn out when the voting begins
Tuesday.
   Dukakis' aides were trying to spread their view of the race with
Jesse Jackson and Sen. Albert Gore Jr. as tightening, although a
late poll by Cable News Network-USA Today put Dukakis ahead by 12
points.
   ``I never talk about polls because I don't pay any attention to
them. I did once and will never do it again,'' Dukakis said, a
reference to the re-election defeat he suffered after his first
term as governor of Massachusetts.
   On Saturday, standing in a blustery cold in front of chunks of
ice floating on Lake Erie in Buffalo, Dukakis offered a reminder of
his crushing loss in Michigan's caucuses, a 2-1 defeat that had not
been predicted.
   ``What is important is that they vote,'' he said. ``I've been
ahead in the polls before, in my own state, and I was way ahead in
Michigan, and we all know what happened there.''
   His New York campaign director, Paul Bograd, said volunteers had
been working 500 to 600 phones a night calling voters in precincts
where demographic indicators suggest Dukakis should be strong.
   After meeting his rivals in their last debate of the New York
campaign Sunday morning, Dukakis walked 25 blocks up 5th Avenue
where he drew warm cheers from thousands of people who lined the
streets for the city's parade honoring Israel's 40th anniversary.
He followed, out of sight of Mayor Ed Koch and Gore, who walked
together.
   At Gaelic Park in the Bronx, Dukakis threw a ball during
halftime of an Irish football game _ a rough sport that has
elements of soccer and rugby.
   He moved into a dance hall at the park as a band and female
singer shifted smoothly from a Patsy Cline country-blues medley to
the Irish tune, ``Take Me Home To Mayo,'' and Dukakis and his wife
Kitty waltzed for the cameras.
   Shifting to a Latin beat, Dukakis traveled to another Bronx
neighborhood where a band played rhythmically with conga drums and
other instruments and the 200 people danced and sang, ``Mike
Du-ka-key, pres-i-dent-e.''
   With him was Puerto Rico Gov. Rafael Hernandez-Colon of Puerto
Rico, and each spoke in Spanish to the predominantly Hispanic
audience inside the Club Cubano Americano, where pink paint peeled
from the walls and stairwell windows were broken out.
   Dukakis ``talks our own language,'' the Puerto Rican governor
told them, using Spanish.

   The assistant principal thought it a
deed most foul when student pranksters released 25 clucking
chickens in a school auditorium while a theater troupe recited
Shakespeare.
   Twelve Fairview High School students received 10-day suspensions
for the prank Friday during the performance of ``Shakespeare on
Broadway'' and ``West Side Story'' by the Cleveland Opera On Tour.
   ``They may feel it was a prank, but we do not consider it
humorous,'' said Assistant Principal Charles Kulik. ``It disturbed
a very fine program and was not in good taste. To think the
students would let loose live chickens ... it's a very embarrassing
thing.''
   The performers didn't realize what was happening until Kulik
interrupted to apologize to the troupe and dress down the seniors.
   Betsy Clark, an assistant in the opera's tour department, said
she didn't believe the chickens had ruined the performance.
   ``They (opera singers) did well under the pretty bad
circumstances,'' she said. ``I saw different teachers trying to
catch the chickens. One teacher caught one and headed out the door
with it; the kids started giggling and clapping, and the performers
couldn't figure out why they were laughing and applauding right in
the middle of a serious Shakespeare dialogue.''

<DATELINE>DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   All 1,900 guards in the Republic of
Ireland's 11 prisons went on strike Saturday following the
breakdown of talks with officials of Prime Minister Charles
Haughey's government.
   The government said it would use 1,000 police officers, about a
tenth of the nation's police force, and about 300 soldiers to staff
the prisons. The prisons hold about 2,000 inmates.
   It is the first national walkout by prison guards in the
nation's history.
   The prison guards' union, the Irish Prison Officers'
Association, said in a statement the strike is a protest against
the Department of Justice's decision to impose new shift
arrangements without consulting the guards.
   The union also says it wants money used to pay for guard
overtime to be used to hire more prison staff.
   But the department said the cause of the dispute is the guards'
demand for compensation for overtime payments lost last year when
extra staff was hired. The department said the extra staff was
added partly to meet union complaints about staff shortages.
   The strike comes amid reports of unrest in some prisons. Four
prisoners at the high-security Portlaoise, 47 miles southwest of
Dublin, were reported to have smashed up their cells to protest
conditions.
   About 130 of the 200 prisoners at the Portlaoise prison are
convicted guerrillas of the outlawed Irish Republican Army and the
Irish National Liberation Army.

   Government and rebel negotiators met
Saturday in search of ways to achieve peace, but the two sides
remained far apart on the key issue of a permanent truce.
   After day-long talks they agreed to resume negotiations Sunday.
   Bosco Matamoros, a spokesman for the rebels, said the
discussions had been frank, and Deputy Foreign Minister Victor
Tinoco called the meeting ``a productive day where we advanced
quite a bit.''
   Neither side gave details of the talks.
   More than 1,000 people gathered in front of the U.S. Embassy to
protest the American support for the rebels known as Contras and
demand that their leaders sign a cease-fire during the discussions.
   The demonstrators carried signs saying, ``Cease North American
Support of the Contras.''
   No incidents were reported.
   The delegations met briefly Friday night, then gathered again at
the negotiating table at 9 a.m. (11 a.m. EDT) Saturday behind
closed doors and recessed at 7 p.m.
   The rebels are demanding the Sandinista government take the
first steps toward returning Nicaragua to freely elected democratic
rule before they sign an armisice.
   ``If we sign a permanent cease-fire without first taking steps
to lead (the country back) to democracy, it would be tantamount to
surrender on our part,'' Adolfo Calero, the top Contra negotiator,
told The Associated Press in a telephone interview shortly before
the start of Saturday's session.
   Gen. Humberto Ortega, the Sandinista defense minister and head
of the government delegation, said Friday the Sandinistas believe
an agreement on a permanent truce comes first.
   ``The victory we should seek is a permanent cease-fire,'' Ortega
told reporters.
   But both sides expressed optimism they could reach agreement.
   ``We came here with faith and goodwill and we hope to find the
same goodwill on the other side to reach agreement that will
benefit all Nicaraguans,'' Calero said.
   He added, however: ``We have reservations to return to Costa
Rica on Monday afternoon. If the negotiations are on the right
track, then we could prolong our stay.''
   This is the first time the Sandinistas have allowed Contra
leaders to come to Managua since the revolt began in November 1981.
President Daniel Ortega has said 26,500 people have been slain in
the conflict.
   A 60-day cease-fire has been in effect since April 1 and
continued to be holding on Saturday.
   Even though each side has accused the other of violating the
cease-fire, incidents have been few and minor.
   The Contra umbrella organization known as Nicaraguan Resistance
said in a brief statement Saturday that Sandinista helicopter
gunships have been violating the cease-fire by trying to chart
rebel troop movements. It also said Sandinista ``agents'' have been
trying to contact rebel commanders to discuss peace.
   The statement issued in Miami, where the Contras have their
headquarters, added: ``Consequently we are instructing our
combatants to reject any contact with these elements, the majority
of whom belong to the State Security forces, or to capture them.''
   Delegates signed the 60-day cease-fire on March 23 after three
days of negotiations in the tiny border post of Sapoa, 90 miles
south of Managua.
   Agreement on the technical aspects of the cease-fire was reached
during talks that ended Friday at Sapoa, and the two sides agreed
to further technical talks at this week's high-level meetings in
Managua.
   The sides have agreed on seven cease-fire zones where the rebels
would gather during the temporary cease-fire until a permanent
truce is negotiated.
   But the logistics of moving into those zones, whether the
Contras would give up their weapons, and how they would be
resupplied have kept the sides apart.
   Although details of Friday's talks were not released, a joint
communique said the delegations had made ``substantial progress.''
   The Soviet-supported Sandinistas have been in power since
defeating the right-wing government of the late President Anastasio
Somoza in 1979.

   First results from rural counties gave
Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis a strong early lead over Jesse
Jackson in Arizona's Democratic presidential caucus Saturday.
   In La Paz County in southwestern Arizona, Dukakis had 66 votes
compared with 21 for Jackson. Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore Jr. got 18
votes while Illinois Sen. Paul Simon, who has suspended his
candidacy, got four votes and political extremist Lyndon LaRouche
had one vote. Three voters expressed no preference.
   In Greenlee County in eastern Arizona, Dukakis had 144 votes
compared with 27 for Jackson, 13 for Gore and three each for Simon,
LaRouche and no preference.
   ``We expected to win Arizona,'' said Richard Ybarra, Dukakis'
director for western states. ``If we do, if the preliminary numbers
hold up, it will be a continuation of the Dukakis campaign winning
in the West.''
   Backers of both Dukakis and Jackson have insisted their
candidate can capture the caucus because of the traditional low
turnout.
   Traditionally, only about 25,000 to 30,000 of Arizona's 680,000
Democrats turn out for the primary-style vote which is the first
step toward choosing 36 delegates to the July 18-21 national
convention in Atlanta. Party Executive Director Glenn Davis said
Saturday evening he did not yet have an accurate turnout projection.
   ``I think we can win Arizona,'' Jackson campaign coordinator
John Norris said earlier Saturday. ``People committed to Jesse
Jackson tend to be more apt to go out and vote.''
   Dukakis state director Jose Villarreal was pleased with his
candidate's endorsements this week by Phoenix Mayor Terry Goddard,
Tucson Mayor Tom Volgy and a number of other state and local
government leaders.
   ``If the word gets out, it's significant,'' Villarreal said.
``These are all very well-known and respected individuals.''
However, he acknowledged the vote Saturday could be close.
   Davis agreed earlier in the day, saying ``It's anybody's ball
game.''
   Jackson is the only candidate who visited the state.
   Gore's local coordinator, Burt Drucker, said he is disappointed
the national campaign allocated no money or candidate visits to the
Arizona campaign.
   ``It's not the easiest way to put on a presidential race,''
Drucker said. ``He is the kind of moderate candidate that we feel
would have appealed to the Democratic voters in rural Arizona.''
   Thirty-six of Arizona's 41-member delegation are up for grabs
Saturday. The other five are ``super delegates'' _ four top party
officials and Gov. Rose Mofford, all of whom are uncommitted.
   Saturday's vote is conducted like a primary, except there are
only 99 polling places statewide. Democrats will vote twice: first,
for the presidential candidate of their choice, and second, for the
delegates they want to represent that candidate.
   The top 500 potential delegates, in proportion to the candidates
they represent, will go to regional caucuses May 28. At those
caucuses, 23 national convention delegates will be chosen.
   Later, in June, another 13 delegates _ also in proportion to the
candidate vote _ will be chosen by the state committee from among
party and elected officials.
   Villarreal acknowledged that Jackson has a ``distinct
advantage'' in the Arizona voting system, which is similar to the
process in Michigan where Jackson won a few weeks ago.
   Dukakis was the strong leader in a poll of Democratic voters
conducted several weeks ago. It found 36 percent in his corner,
compared with 17 percent for Jackson and 4 percent for Gore. The
poll did not screen for likely voters.

   Republican Jim McCrery claimed victory
Saturday night in an election to fill the northwest Louisiana
congressional seat vacated by Gov. Buddy Roemer, but his opponent
refused to concede.
   With all 371 precincts reporting from the 4th Congressional
District, unofficial returns gave McCrery 63,481 votes, or 51
percent, to 61,900 votes, or 49 percent, for Democratic state Sen.
Foster Campbell.
   The winner will serve the remaining months of Roemer's 1987-89
congressional term. Roemer was inaugurated governor in March.
   ``To be a U.S. congressman and help ensure the future of this
great nation ... has long been a dream of mine. I will be a good
congressman,'' McCrery told supporters. He also said he will run
for a full two-year term in the fall.
   ``This race is razor-thin. I'm not ready to concede,'' said
Campbell. ``I think the race is too close to call. I think we'll
wait. We'll know more about it when the voting machines are opened.
... I still think we can win this.''
   The governor's office, State Police and private security guards
will guard all of the district's voting machines until the results
can be certified, McCrery quoted Roemer as saying.
   There was confusion about the exact vote in Caddo Parish, as
officials checked and rechecked computer readouts.
   In addition, Secretary of State Fox McKeithen said in Baton
Rouge that he had talked with federal voting officials about the
disqualification of 3,000 Caddo Parish voters between the March 8
primary and Saturday's runoff.
   McKeithen said he was told voters cannot be disqualified less
than six weeks before an election.
   Most recent polls had given McCrery, a former Roemer aide, a
slight advantage over Campbell.
   The last precincts to report were from the most populous
Shreveport-Bossier City area, and the narrow edge they gave McCrery
was just enough to offset the support Campbell received in the
seven rural parishes.
   Turnout was predicted at about 45 percent, said Darrell Cobb,
director of the elections division of the secretary of state's
office.

   McCrery, 38, is a former lobbyist for Georgia-Pacific Corp. and
a former congressional aide to both Roemer and his predecessor.
   Campbell, 41, is serving his fourth term in the Louisiana
Senate. His ability to campaign actively had been hampered because
he was seriously injured in an auto accident March 13.
   Roemer vacated the 4th District seat March 14, the day he was
inaugurated. The governor, a conservative Democrat, made no public
endorsements in the runoff.
   McCrery was also a Democrat until he switched parties last fall
in anticipation of running for Roemer's seat, saying he disagreed
with some aspects of the national Democratic Party platform.
   In the March 8 primary, McCrery led a field of 10 candidates
with 31 percent of the vote, followed by Campbell with 19 percent.
McCrery was the only Republican in the race.
   In Louisiana, non-presidential primaries are ``open,'' with all
candidates running against one another regardless of party. If no
one gets a majority, a runoff is held between the top two
vote-getters.

   Democratic presidential candidates set aside their differences
during a one hour-debate Saturday and concentrated their fire on
the Republican administration, criticizing President Reagan and
Vice President George Bush on issues ranging from the sale of arms
to Iran to the handling of the AIDS epidemic.
   ``I don't see any intensity out there for George Bush,'' said
Michael Dukakis, entering the final weekend of the New York
presidential primary as the front-runner in the polls.
   Sen. Albert Gore Jr. said the administration had ``a disgraceful
record'' in its handling of AIDS.
   ``We cannot just manage Reaganomics, we're going to have to
reverse Reaganomics,'' Jesse Jackson said at the debate in
Rochester, N.Y.
   Before flying to the western New York city, Dukakis met with
black businessmen in Harlem and toured an Italian neighborhood in
Queens.
   Asked why he has spent so little time campaigning in black
neighborhoods, the Massachusetts governor said, ``I understand
Jesse's going to get the lion's share of the votes in this
community and that's understandable.''
   But, said Dukakis, he had ``always had good support in the black
community.''
   Jackson, in a campaign appearance in Niagara Falls, N.Y., urged
Indians, who generally do not vote as a matter of principle, to get
involved in the nation's political process to improve life on the
reservation.
   ``We want to reach out to them and urge them to vote,'' Jackson
said at a rally at an Indian museum. ``So many Native Americans
have simply been broken-hearted. They've been hurt so long they
feel a sense of betrayal. We have to get them involved.''
   Gore, falling deeper in debt and trailing badly in the polls,
began running commercials featuring New York City Mayor Edward Koch
urging voters to ``Vote positive. Vote Al Gore.''
   Koch also planned to march with Gore on Sunday in a Salute to
Israel parade, a gesture Gore hopes will help him capture some of
the Jewish voters who generally comprise 25 percent of the
Democratic primary turnout.
   The three Democratic candidates, seated on stage at the Eastman
Theater on Saturday for the League of Women Voters-sponsored
debate, appeared determined to set aside their differences and
concentrate on the vulnerabilities of their GOP opponent _
virtually certain to be Bush.
   Jackson defended his meetings with Palestine Liberation
Organization leader Yasser Arafat, Syrian president Hafez Assad and
Cuban president Fidel Castro.
   Jackson said he had appealed to Arafat to recognize Israel and
had thanked Assad for releasing a U.S. Navy flier.
   As for Castro, Jackson said he got the Cuban leader to release
political prisoners and said, ``If we have diplomatic relations
with Chile and South Africa on the one hand and China and Russia on
the other, we should not reduce our influence in our own hemisphere
with Cuba.''
   Not even a discussion of the Middle East, which has produced the
sharpest differences between the candidates during the New York
campaign, could shake their congeniality.
   Gore, who has taken the firmest pro-Israel stand, said the
United States should not talk to the PLO until that group renounces
terrorism ``such as blowing up school buses with innocent children
on them, renouncing that kind of act as an instrument of policy.''
   Jackson, who has been the most sympathetic toward the PLO,
quickly responded, ``You are right.'' Then he pointed out that
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir ``said he wouldn't recognize
the PLO even if they recognized him.''
   Dukakis, recalling the step the late Egyptian President Anwar
Sadat took to end his country's state of war with Israel, said, ``I
don't see why it's so difficult for the other Arab leaders to do
what Sadat did.''
   Sadat eventually signed a peace treaty with Israel.
   The candidates greeted each other warmly after the debate with
Dukakis standing on the stage's wing while Jackson answered
questions from reporters, and Gore watched from behind a crowd of
journalists.
   ``I was going to ask you, `when are you going to get off that
stage,''' Gore joked to Jackson when he finally stepped down.
   Every published poll of likely New York Democratic primary
voters showed Dukakis leading Jackson by margins ranging from 6 to
nearly 17 percentage points. All the surveys said Gore was running
a distant third.
   In a Washington Post-ABC News poll published Sunday, Dukakis was
supported by 43 percent, Jackson 37 percent and Gore 13 percent.
The survey calculated the responses of 179 likely voters among 392
Democrats interviewed Thursday and Friday. The margin of error for
the poll was plus or minus 8 percentage points.
   Gore toured a market in the heart of a Polish neighborhood in
Buffalo and conceded that he is running behind in the state.
   ``At a minimum we have to have a strong finish to demonstrate
continued momentum,'' Gore said. ``But I'm not going to put
specific numbers on it.''
   He said he thought he had time to improve his standing and
added, ``It's a very volatile race.''
   Bush was expected to sweep the 96 Republican delegates at stake
on Tuesday. Half of the Bush delegates were running unopposed. His
only remaining opponent for the nomination, Pat Robertson, did not
campaign in the state and has said that Bush was ``going to be the
nominee of the Republican Party absent any unexpected eventuality.''
   While the Democratic candidates were campaigning and debating in
New York, where 255 delegates are at stake, Arizona Democrats,
whose favorite son, former Gov. Bruce Babbitt, was an early
casualty in the Democratic race, held caucuses on Saturday to
allocate 36 delegates.
   Dukakis held a strong lead over Jackson in the earliest results
from two rural counties in Arizona. Those results involved about
300 votes reported by late Saturday night, while an estimated
25,000 to 30,000 people were expected to participate in the
caucuses.
   South Carolina and North Dakota, which use a three-step process
to select delegates, on Saturday held state conventions.
   North Dakota Democrats gave two-thirds of their 15 delegates to
the uncommitted while Dukakis got three and Jackson two. The state
convention was the final step in North Dakota's delegate selection
process which began with precinct caucuses last month.
   In South Carolina, where the party completed its
delegate-selection process begun with precinct caucuses March 12,
Jackson picked up almost two-third of the delegates on Saturday.
Jackson came up with 28 delegates, while Gore won eight and Dukakis
got seven.
   Allocation of the Arizona delegates will be determined by the
outcome of a presidential preference vote at the caucuses.
   Jackson was the only candidate to campaign in Arizona and his
state campaign coordinator John Norris said, ``I think we can win
Arizona. People committed to Jesse Jackson tend to be more apt to
go out and vote.''
   Dukakis had the backing of many top state Democrats and was the
leader in a poll taken several weeks ago. Gore spent neither time
nor money in the state.
   Gore borrowed another $100,000 from banks in his home state of
Tennessee, bringing his total campaign debt to $1.6 million.
Winless since Super Tuesday, when he demonstrated support across
the South, Gore was spending $700,000 on advertising in New York in
a bid to get back into contention.
   The Democratic candidates were scheduled to debate again on
Sunday, a televised appearance on WNBC. All three also planned to
appear at a senior citizen forum sponsored by city council
president Andrew Stein.

   Honduran authorities deported a
Colombian who managed the business affairs of an alleged
international drug trafficker being held by U.S. authorities,
government sources said late Saturday.
   The sources in the Immigration Office, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said Manuel Ruiz and two other unidentified Colombians
were deported to Colombia on Friday.
   Ruiz was a business manager of Juan Ramon Matta, the alleged
drug trafficker who was hustled out of Honduras on April 5 and
wound up in a U.S. prison.
   Authorities had detained Ruiz on April 6.
   Matta's arrest sparked violent anti-American demonstrations that
resulted in the burning and sacking of the U.S. Consulate and
offices of the U.S. Information Service in the capital of
Tegucigalpa.
   Five Hondurans were reported killed in the protests.
   Honduran officials took Matta from his Tegucigalpa home in a
pre-dawn raid and shuttled him onto a plane to the Dominican
Republic without a passport.
   Dominican Republic officials put Matta on a New York-bound
flight and he was arrested aboard the jetliner by U.S. marshals,
according to U.S. law enforcement officials.
   Matta, held at a maximum-security federal prison in Marion,
Ill., was wanted by U.S. officials on drug trafficking charges and
for questioning in the 1985 slaying in Mexico of a U.S. Drug
Enforcement Administration agent.

   Immigration and Naturalization Service
agents on Saturday arrested 211 people suspected of being illegal
aliens in eight cities in northern and central California, the
federal agency announced.
   All of those apprehended were men from Mexico, and all but 15
returned voluntarily Saturday afternoon, said Bill Carter, chief
patrol agent of the Livermore sector of the INS' Border Patrol.
   The arrests were the most made in the sector in one day since
passage of the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, Carter
said. The sector stretches from the Oregon border south to Oxnard
and includes 13 counties in northern Nevada.
   The sweep began shortly after midnight in Fresno, where 90
people were arrested. The others were captured in or near Oxnard,
Salinas, San Luis Obispo, Bakersfield, Livermore, Stockton and
Sacramento by noon, Carter said.
   Some of the suspected illegal aliens were found in an apparent
smuggling operation north of Livermore, he said.
   ``Anybody that had any documentation at all was immediately
released from custody,'' Carter said. Acceptable documentation
included proof of application for amnesty.
   The arrests were made at bus stations and highways. The Border
Patrol has focused on undocumented workers at farms and ranches,
but no one was arrested at his workplace on Saturday, Carter said.
   Those who agreed to return to Mexico and had no criminal records
were loaded on buses late Saturday afternoon.
   The 15 others were being held at the INS detention facility in
El Centro and were expected to appear before an immigration judge
early next week unless bail is posted.

   Arabs enraged by the
slaying of PLO chief Yasser Arafat's top aide fought street battles
Saturday with Israeli soldiers who killed 15 rioters and wounded
scores, Israeli radio reported.
   Hospital officials put the death toll at 14, with eight killed
in Gaza and six in the West Bank.
   Bernard Mills, head of the U.N. Relief and Works Agency in Gaza,
said of the Israeli soldiers: ``From reports we have, they used no
warning shots, no tear gas, no rubber bullets. They just opened
fire.''
   A military spokesman said the soldiers fired because their lives
were in danger. He described the clashes as ``breaking out
spontaneously and with force'' and said demonstrators had thrown
many firebombs at troops.
   Hospitals, U.N. officials and Arab journalists said up to 90
Palestinians were wounded. The army imposed curfews on 10 refugee
camps.
   It was the highest one-day death toll reported since violence
began Dec. 8 in the occupied West Bank and Gaza strip, bringing the
number of Palestinians reported killed to at least 164. An Israeli
soldier and civilian also have been slain.
   Most of the violence was in the Gaza Strip, where Khalil
al-Wazir, military commander of the PLO, lived until 1963 and close
relatives remain. He was killed early Saturday at his home in
Tunis, Tunisia, by seven commandos who escaped.
   Palestinian leaders blamed Israel for the assassination.
   ``Israel is the only party that could have carried out such an
act,'' said Hanna Siniora, editor of the newspaper Al Fajr in Arab
east Jerusalem. ``His (al-Wazir's) portfolio is the occupied
territories. This is an attempt to crush the uprising by force.''
   Spokesmen for the Defense Ministry and Foreign Ministry refused
comment. Avi Pazner, who speaks for Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir,
said it was ``natural for the PLO to blame Israel. They always
blame Israel.''
   Ariel Merari, an expert on terrorism at Tel Aviv University,
said the death of al-Wazir _ also known as Abu Jihad (Father of the
Holy War) _ might have been the result of PLO infighting and that
Arafat, the PLO chairman, probably approved it.
   Riots began in the occupied territories as soon as news of the
assassination was broadcast.
   Hospital officials said seven Palestinians were shot to death in
Gaza and six in the West Bank. The previous highest death toll was
on April 2, when six Palestinians were killed.
   The Israeli army command confirmed 12 Arab deaths and said
troops killed five Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. It said seven
other Palestinians were slain and it was investigating the
circumstances.
   Black flags of mourning fluttered in Gaza City, home of five
families related to al-Wazir, over streets blocked every few yards
by barriers of stones and flaming tires.
   Mobs of angry young Arabs clutching rocks, blocks of cement,
empty tear gas canisters and anything else that could be thrown
crowded around approaching cars. Many masked their faces with
shirts or Arab headscarves.
   ``Gaza has not been this tense since the beginning of the
uprising,'' said a woman who would not given her name.
   Outside the home of Ahmed al-Wazir, the dead man's
brother-in-law, about 100 mourners sat under a tent as loudspeakers
from a nearby mosque blared mourning verses from the Koran, holy
book of Islam.
   Palestinian flags, outlawed by Israel, were draped over the
home's entrance and balcony. More of the red, green, white and
black banners hung from poles in the street, obscured occasionally
by thick smoke from burning tires.
   The service was interrupted when mourners spotted Israelis armed
with rifles and tear gas at a nearby street corner.
   ``Come here if you are men!'' the Palestinians shouted, hurling
stones. The troopers responded with tear gas, and gunfire was heard.
   Women in long black mourning dresses screamed at the soldiers.
Some carried onions, bottles of cologne or buckets of chlorine, all
thought to be remedies for tear gas inhalation.
   Mourners suddenly rushed at the Israelis, carrying Palestinian
flags and shouting ``Allahu Akbar!'' (God is Great).
   About 30 soldiers charged the protesters, firing tear gas and
some live ammunition. The Arabs dispersed in a thick white cloud of
tear gas and no casualties were evident.
   Inside the house, Ahmed al-Wazir, the widow's brother, said he
had ``no doubts'' of who the killers were and denied allegations of
a feud with Arafat.
   Most of the deaths in Gaza were at refugee camps. Three people
were reported killed in the Khan Younis camp in the southern Gaza
Strip, two at the nearby Rafah camp, and one each at the Bureij
refugee camp in the central Gaza Strip and Abssan village near Gaza
City.
   In the West Bank, hospital officials said three people were
killed in the town of Jenin and one each at Silwad near Ramallah,
Habla near Qalqilya, and Qabatiyeh.

   The pilot of a commuter plane that caught fire in
flight was ``either very lucky, very brave, probably very
skilled,'' officials said after a crash-landing that barely missed
a crowded airport bar and injured 19 people.
   Two passengers and their seats were thrown through the side of
the Horizon Air de Havilland Dash 8 in the crash Friday night at
Seattle-Tacoma International Airport. Two of the 40 people aboard
were in serious condition Saturday. No one on the ground was hurt.
   ``Everyone was holding hands. I don't know who the man was next
to me, but I sure must have broke his arm holding onto it,'' said
passenger Wilma Swartzwelder, a Spokane nurse. She said the plane
flew five or 10 minutes before she saw the right engine on fire.
   The propeller-driven plane narrowly missed the airport control
tower. Then it made a hard landing and careened into a boarding
ramp.
   The plane crashed through baggage carts ``like a bowling
alley,'' then headed for the busy B Concourse Bar, said Douglas
Chadd, 29, manager of a restaurant overlooking the B Concourse.
   ``If it would have been a few feet the other way, the nose would
have went right into the bar, and this is their busiest night,''
Chadd said.
   However, a wing punched through a passenger ramp at an empty
Delta Air Lines gate where Chadd said a flight had departed about
10 minutes earlier.
   Eight investigators were sent from the National Transportation
Safety Board, along with board member Joseph Nall, to handle the
investigation, said Ted Lopatkiewicz of the NTSB.
   ``Obviously, the focus (of the probe) is centered in the right
engine,'' Nall said.
   A 2-by-3-foot panel from the ravaged right engine was found
Saturday about a mile and a half from the airport, Nall said. The
panel, used to gain access to the engine for maintenance or
repairs, was the only piece of the plane found outside the airport.
   Horizon President John Kelly said the accident resulted in the
first passenger injuries in the airline's seven-year history. He
said the incident was the third in 19 months involving the
turboprop engines on the Dash 8.
   In June, an engine fire was detected shortly after takeoff, and
in 1986 a plane returned to Sea-Tac when an engine malfunctioned,
he said. The incidents involved different aircraft among the
airline's 10 Dash 8s, Kelly said.
   Officials at the de Havilland division of Boeing Canada and
Pratt & Whitney Canada, manufacturer of the engines on the Dash 8,
said in telephone interviews they knew of no recurrent problems
with the aircraft or its engines.
   Horizon Flight 2658 had just taken off on a flight from Seattle
to Spokane with a full load of 37 passengers, plus three crew
members, said Horizon spokeswoman Nancy Hamilton.
   The plane was about three miles from the airport when pilot Carl
Carlson reported ``a hot engine,'' radio jargon for a fire, said
Dick Meyer of the Federal Aviation Administration regional office
in Seattle.
   The plane ``almost hit the (Sea-Tac) control tower,'' said Lee
Fryer, duty officer at the FAA air traffic control center in
Auburn. ``The controllers thought he was going to hit it.''
   ``They had a fire truck waiting and the flames were out in about
15 seconds,'' Fryer said.
   ``It could have been a lot worse,'' said air traffic controller
Marvin K. Tobosa. ``We consider the pilot either very lucky, very
brave, probably very skilled. It was pretty quick.''
   Before the plane hit the ground, ``there was very little
talking,'' said Steve Lowenstam, 42, of Eugene, Ore. ``I heard
someone in front comforting someone else, but there were no
screams.''
   When the plane hit, ``I heard the boom. They told us to put our
heads down and shield our faces. Everybody was real calm,'' said
Ms. Swartzwelder.
   The flight attendant ``did a good job'' of explaining how
passengers should hold their heads down, said Todd Weber, 32, of
Clarkston.
   The plane came down hard, careened across a runway, some grass
and the tarmac, then hit the boarding ramp. What passengers heard
was ``basically a piece of metal scraping concrete, a lot of bumps,
a lot of noise,'' Weber said.
   Carol Watt, 43, of Eugene, Ore., and Lowenstam said two
passengers and their seats were ejected from the plane on impact.
   ``After we crashed, the whole seat to our right was thrown out
the side of the plane,'' Lowenstan said.
   ``The whole right side of the aircraft basically came apart in
several places,'' said Weber.
   In addition to the man in serious condition after chest surgery
at Harborview Medical Center, officials said at least 18 were
injured. Four people in all remained hospitalized Saturday. None of
the injuries was considered life-threatening.
   Carlson, 38, of Portland, Ore., was treated at Virginia Mason
Hospital for back pain and released, a nursing supervisor said. He
declined to discuss the crash Friday night.
   Tina Mankowski of Harborview, where most of those aboard the
plane were taken, said most passengers were from north-central
Idaho.

<HEAD>Shamir Spokesman Denies Israeli Leaders Approved PLO Assassination</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A spokesman for Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir
refused comment Sunday on reports that Shamir and two other high
Israeli officials approved the assassination of the PLO's deputy
commander.
   NBC television, quoting unidentified sources, reported
Saturday's assassination of Fatah military leader Khalil al-Wazir
in Tunisia was a joint operation of Israel's intelligence service,
the Mossad, and naval and army units.
   The report, aired Saturday night, said the attack was approved
by Shamir, Foreign Minister Shimon Peres and Defense Minister
Yitzhak Rabin after Fatah guerrillas hijacked a bus and killed
three Israelis in southern Israel's Negev desert last month.
   ``This story has the same status as all the other stories like
it which have been published, and we don't relate to any of them,''
spokesman Avi Pazner told The Associated Press.
   NBC said Mossad had asked three times for permission to kill
al-Wazir, but that each time Israeli officials refused to give
permission. That changed after the bus attack, the network reported.
   The former head of a Defense Ministry intelligence unit praised
the assassination and suggested in an interview Sunday with army
radio that al- Wazir had been an Israeli target in past years.
   Rafael Eytan, who stepped down from the unit over the Pollard
spy scandal in 1985, said, ``I have always honored doing justice to
those people responsible for terrorist attacks.''
   Israeli experts say al-Wazir was responsible for a list of
bloody attacks such as the 1975 takeover of the Savoy Hotel in Tel
Aviv in which 11 hostages were slain and a March 1978 bus hijacking
in which 33 Israelis were killed and 82 wounded.
   His assassination touched off a wave of protests in the occupied
Gaza Strip and West Bank Saturday. At least 15 people were killed
and up to 90 wounded in the bloodiest single day of Palestinian
rioting since protests began Dec. 8.
   Eytan also said ``there is no doubt there is a parallel''
between the methods of Saturday's assassination and the 1973
slaying of al-Wazir's predecessor, Kamel Adwan, by Israeli
commandos in Beirut.
   Palestinian officials have cited the similarity between the two
commando raids as showing Israel was involved in al-Wazir's
assassination.
   Eytan headed ``The Scientific Liaison Bureau,'' an intelligence
unit which Israel said it dismantled in 1985 for its involvement in
recruiting former U.S. Navy analyst Jonathan J. Pollard to spy for
Israel.
   Pollard is serving a life sentence after being convicted of
selling Israel hundreds of secret American intelligence documents,
including information about Arab targets.
   In an interview published this week by an army weekly, the head
of Israeli military intelligence, Gen. Amnon Shahak, who commanded
the 1973 Beirut raid, said Israel had a policy of striking at
Palestinian guerrilla leaders.
   ``In my opinion whoever leads acts of terror is a proper target
for liquidation. Whoever uses terrorism against us, should be a
target,'' Shahak told the magazine ``Bamahane.''

<HEAD>Iraq Reports Firing Six Missiles Into Tehran</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with another missile fired, land
attack against Faw, Iranian confirmation. No pickup</NOTE>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iraq reported firing seven missiles
against Tehran and another Iranian city Sunday and said it had
launched an offensive to recapture the Iranian-occupied port of Faw.
   Iran confirmed the attacks but said Iraqi troops were retreating
from the Faw Peninsula.
   Iraqi forces ``are engaged in an epic battle to liberate Faw,''
said the official Iraqi News Agency in an urgent dispatch,
monitored in Nicosia.
   It gave no other details of the attack except that the operation
launched on the first day of the monthlong Moslem feast of Ramadan
was named ``Blessed Ramadan.''
   Iran said Iraqi troops suffered ``hundreds of casualties'' in
the land attack. The official Islamic Republic News Agency said the
Iraqis retreated after trying to infiltrate Iranian positions.
   The Iraqi port of Faw, in the northernmost reach of the Persian
Gulf, was captured by Iranian forces that thrust across the wide
Shatt-Al-Arab estuary in a major offensive in January and February
1986.
   The seizure of Faw, 55 miles south of Basra, Iraq's second
largest city and major port, has been regarded as the most
important Iranian victory in the 7{-year-old war.
   Earlier, Iraq reported firing six long-range missiles into the
Iranian capital of Tehran at 11.30 a.m. (3:30 a.m. EDT). It said a
seventh missile was fired later in the day against the city of
Shiraz, in southern Iran.
   Tehran radio, also monitored in Nicosia, confirmed the missile
strikes against Tehran, saying these were fired ``at different
intervals before noon.''
   The radio added that ``several civilians were killed or wounded
in these attacks,'' which also caused ``substantial damage to
commercial and residential buildings, shops and vehicles.''
   Iraq has fired at least 120 missiles on Iran since Feb. 29, when
the two nations intensified bombings of cities.
   Iran said it responded to the Saturday attacks by firing two
missiles into the Iraqi capital of Baghdad.
   The Iraqi news agency also reported Sunday that one of two
Iranian warplanes raiding cities in the Kurdish region of
northeastern Iraq the previous day was shot down by Iraqi defenses.
   The agency said the raids were directed against residential
areas in the cities of Erbil, Dohuk and Dukan.
   IRNA said Saturday's air raids were in retaliation for Iraqi
missile strikes and air raids against ``civilian areas'' of Iranian
cities.

   Shiite Moslem gunmen who have threatened
to fly a hijacked Kuwaiti jet and about 35 hostages out of Algeria
said Sunday they were extending their ``departure time warning'' to
pursue negotiations.
   Airport personnel were preparing to fill the plane's tanks with
about 6,600 gallons of fuel to maintain conditions inside the
plane, where the hostages were being held for a 13th day.
   The hijackers did not set a new deadline.
   Kuwait Airways Flight 422, with 112 people on board, was
hijacked April 5 on a flight from Bangkok to Kuwait.
   The plane spent three days in Mashhad, Iran, five in Larnaca,
Cyprus, and arrived here early Wednesday.
   The gunmen killed two passengers in Cyprus. They released 57
hostages at Mashhad, 13 at Larnaca and one on Friday in Algiers.
   The hijackers earlier asked for the fuel by 11 a.m. (6 a.m.
EDT). In a brief statement in Arabic to the control tower, the
hijackers said, ``At the request of our brothers the Algerians we
announce that we have agreed to extend the departure time warning
to give an opportunity for the efforts by the Algerians.''
   An Algerian negotiator boarded the blue and white Boeing 747 for
15 minutes, leaving the aircraft at 11:10 a.m. (6:10 a.m. EDT).
   Inside the airport terminal building, Algerian Interior Minister
Hedi Khediri pursued negotiations with a high-level Kuwaiti
delegation.
   On Saturday, the hijackers said they would ask that the plane be
refueled ``to settle our score with Kuwait somewhere else.''
   ``We do not want the massacre to take place here in friendly
Algeria, which welcomed us and which tried to settle the problem,''
they said Saturday.
   The hijackers are demanding freedom for 17 terrorists imprisoned
in Kuwait for the 1983 bombings of the U.S. and French embassies
there.
   Shortly after the threat, Kuwaiti government asked Algerian
authorities to prevent the plane from leaving.
   The new activity came as Moslems prepared to observe Ramadan,
the month-long period of fasting when Islamic values are
particularly stressed. It starts here on Monday.
   It was not immediately clear how the holiday might affect
negotiations or the fate of the hostages.
   Three members of the Kuwaiti royal family are among the hostages.
   There are believed to be about eight hijackers, one or two of
whom may have boarded in Iran.
   Algeria has a record of negotiating solutions to hostage
situations. It successfully gained the release in 1981 of Americans
held at the U.S. Embassy in Tehran for 444 days.

   Fear of the night, two-job couples and the mobile
society are taking their toll on door-to-door solicitations for the
American Cancer Society, fund-raisers say.
   ``People don't know their neighbors like they once did,'' said
Sheila Swimm, who is holding an open house to raise money this year
after more than 20 years of door-to-door canvassing. ``So many
people now work, it's hard to find neighbors at home during the day
and nobody wants to go out at night.''
   Mrs. Swimm, who lives in Lenox in western Massachusetts and is
the society's state chairman for residential fund-raising, said
local chapters decide how to raise funds.
   ``Residential contributions have been going down,'' said Jon
Foley of Newburyport who heads the state cancer drive. ``It was
getting more and more difficult to get volunteers.''
   Foley said house-to-house canvassing last year brought in about
$400,000, compared to $800,000 five years ago.
   Some volunteers are concerned about safety and residents are
more reluctant to open doors to strangers. Some apartment buildings
ban canvassers.
   ``Family structures have changed,'' said Don Henry, society
national vice president. ``Two-income families have reduced the
time people spend in their neighborhood.
   ``They don't form the tight acquaintanceships they used to. And
people are less likely to volunteer in strange neighborhoods.''
   As a result, many of the society's chapters are using lunches,
dinners, road races, house parties and walkathons to replace
door-knocking.
   But some Massachusetts groups are sticking to tradition. The
cancer society's Brockton chapter reported 51,000 canvassers have
signed up to knock on doors this year.

<HEAD>Centenarians Discuss Memories, Views</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MILWAUKEE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When asked to recall his most distant memories,
Hubert Everist went way back to the early days of electric light.
   Everist, of Sioux Falls, S.D., remembered being six years old
when he saw Thomas Edison's revolutionary invention, the
incandescent lamp, at the Chicago World's Fair in 1893.
   His recollections are among those of two dozen other people who
turned 100 years old in 1987 and responded to Northwestern Mutual
Life's fourth annual survey of centenarian policyholders.
   Oddly, of the 85 people who were contacted for the survey, there
was only one common surname _ Young.
   ``We could all learn something from the youthful spirit and zest
for life exhibited by many of those people who have already lived
full lives,'' Donald Schuenke, president of the insurance company,
said recently in making the results of the survey public.
   Such youthful spirit was reported by Anton Lee, of Falmouth,
Mass., who said he still plays golf, pulls his own cart and
regularly hits drives around 150 yards.
   In his lifetime, Lee said he has had seven holes-in-one,
including one at age 94.
   Hazel Marquart, of Crestline, Ohio, did not learn to drive until
she was 62. Although her vision deteriorated, making her nearly
blind for the past 20 years, she described how she has listened to
``talking books'' and has memorized poems.
   Other memories reported by the respondents included seeing
President Theodore Roosevelt give a speech, attending college with
Kansas Gov. Alf Landon and decorating a Christmas tree with real
candles.
   Many said the secret to their longevity was a healthy diet, a
good spouse and high moral standards. Also, more than half of the
centenarians noted that their parents had lived at least beyond age
80, and several reported that both parents lived beyond 90.
   But Adah Crane, of Austin, Minn., said she ``hasn't the faintest
idea'' how she reached the century mark.
   ``Being 100 years old has not been, to me, a time for creating
philosophy,'' she wrote. ``It was a surprise to me to reach my
100th birthday, but I don't think in terms of years. I think in
terms of friends and occasions.''

<TEXT>
   The captain of the frigate Samuel B.
Roberts, in his first phone call to the United States since the
ship struck a mine in the Persian Gulf, said he was told to abandon
ship twice.
   But Cmdr. Paul X. Rinn said his crew of ``heroes'' saved a ship
that was hit so hard her stern rose 15 feet in the air and flames
shot 100 feet through her stacks.
   ``It was close, really close,'' Rinn said. ``We took a very bad
hit.''
   Rinn's account of the Thursday incident came during a 15-minute
phone call Saturday to his wife, Pamela, who traveled to Rhode
Island from South Carolina for a dinner held by the crew members'
wives.
   About 25 wives were at the Portsmouth home of Mary Perez, not
expecting any calls. Then around 2 p.m., the crews' call came.
   Rinn did not say who told him to abandon ship, but spent most of
the call praising what he called a well-trained crew who saved
everyone's lives.
   ``The crew did exactly what they were supposed to do,'' Rinn
said. ``We put out the fires and stopped the flooding.''
   Crew members related stories about the hit in their first phone
calls home since the ship pulled in the United Arab Emirates port
of Dubai on Saturday.
   While everyone was a hero, the men said, they mentioned two
stars _ Chief Petty Officers George Cowan and Robert Bent _ who
saved the lives of three men.
   One of the men was Alex Perez, who was drowning in a pool of oil
and water when Cowan and Bent pulled him out. Perez was in serious
condition with back injuries. His wife said Saturday that he is in
a body cast.
   Lt. Gordan Evans Van Hook, who spoke to his wife Jacqueline
Anne, said the blast came just 20 seconds after the crew had
assumed battle stations. Rinn ordered battle stations after three
mines were detected.
   Van Hook said he was thrown four feet into the air. Another crew
member, Jeffrey Oster of West Kingston, said he was thrown into the
ceiling.
   The wives learned that their husbands were in line on the ship
to use the phone, so they lined up in the hallway ouside Mary
Perez's bedroom in the same order, passing the phone down the line
in a 2{-hour conversation.

<TEXT>
   Viewer privacy, which suddenly became an
issue when Supreme Court nominee Robert Bork's videocassette rental
choices turned up in print, would be protected under a bill passed
by Maryland's General Assembly.
   Legislation on the issue is pending in Iowa and in both houses
of the U.S. Congress.
   The Maryland bill, which awaits the governor's signature, is
thought to be the first enacted in the nation that would penalize a
retail video establishment for violating a viewer's privacy.
   It would impose up to a $500 penalty and maximum six-month jail
term on anyone who released information about what a person had
purchased or rented for use on a home videocassette player.
   Last year a Washington publication's story listed the movies
Bork and his family had rented from a local movie rental shop.
   The story showed the Bork family had a penchant for mystery
movies, but raised questions about whether such information should
be made available, particularly in cases of X-rated movie rentals.
   The Maryland law sets up exceptions for authorized law
enforcement personnel, collection agencies, or individuals
designated by the customer.
   Video industry representatives say they support the bill as a
privacy protection measure.
   Rick Karpel, regional director of the Video Software Dealer
Association in Cherry Hill, N.J., said his group was ``generally
supportive'' of the Maryland bill and had been tracking its
progress.
   ``We've done a lot of work on this at the federal level. Other
states are considering it; Congress is considering it,'' he said.
   The Maryland bill was passed in the closing days of the session
earlier this month and Gov. William Donald Schaefer is expected to
sign it.
   The Iowa Senate voted last Tuesday to add a video privacy
amendment to an uncontroversial bill expanding the confidentiality
of public library records. One of the federal bills has been in the
House Judiciary Committee since Oct 21, 1987, while a Senate bill
remains in draft form. The Senate version sets up civil, rather
than criminal penalties, and allows a video customer to seek up to
$2,500 in damages.
   Vans Stevenson, a spokesman for Erol's Inc., the largest volume
speciality video retailer in the nation, said his organization's
president had written to a Maryland delegate to express support for
the privacy bill, which dovetails with the firm's own policy.
   ``Customer rental and sales are privileged,'' Stevenson said.
``We applied your (Maryland's) proposal to formally protect what we
believe has always been a reasonable expectation and right of
privacy for the video customer. The bill essentially mirrors the
policy we have.''
   His company doesn't handle X-rated or pornographic videotapes
that might be the target of some inquiries. However, he said he
believes that regardless of what categories of videotapes they
handle, the majority of video retailers follow similar policies.
   Stevenson said computerized records of video transactions are
held in Erol's stores 30 days, then put in an offsite vault. Store
employees are instructed not to respond to questions about an
individual's membership in the video club or to release information
to reporters or creditors, he said. All releases of information are
made through headquarters.
   ``We don't release membership lists. We don't sell lists,'' he
said. ``The only information we actually use are aggregate numbers,
certain titles, like how many times did `Robocop' run?''

   Pint-sized would-be desperadoes drew
mustaches above their upper lips before swiping a car from a repair
shop and taking off in it, police said.
   ``It looked like they were painted on with Magic Markers,'' Boca
Raton Police Sgt. Robert Muth said. ``I know what it was: They

   ``I don't think they could see over the steering wheel,'' he

   But the 6- and 7-year-old brothers, stumped by the Honda station

   A police officer who had seen the pair taking the car from
Randy's German Car Repair followed them, parking his car in front
of them so they couldn't drive away.
   ``But they went in reverse. They put it in R for race,'' Muth
said.
   The boys were uninjured when they hit the wall and tried to flee
on foot, but were quickly nabbed Friday night by Sgt. Jim O'Hara.
They were taken into custody, fingerprinted, charged with car theft
and released to their parents, Muth said.

   Jesse Jackson would freeze Pentagon spending
and raise taxes on the rich. Michael Dukakis would shoot down the
Midgetman missile and hire more tax collectors. Albert Gore Jr.
would consider a tax on luxuries, but supports some weapons his
rivals oppose.
   The budget and defense policy are not the only areas in which
the three surviving challengers for the Democratic presidential
nomination differ. Among the others: abortion, education, taxes and
the Middle East.
   The Middle East, particularly, has been a topic of considerable
concern as the candidates head into Tuesday's New York primary. In
1984, Jews cast 23 percent of the votes in that contest.
   Jackson, the civil rights activist, has taken the most
consistently liberal stands on foreign and domestic issues, and has
offered more specifics on how he would grapple with the federal
budget deficit.
   Dukakis, the governor of Massachusetts, also has embraced many
liberal social ideas, including universal health insurance, but has
suggested that taxpayer costs can be minimized by forging
partnerships with the private sector.
   Gore has staked out the more conservative stances on military
and foreign policy issues, and has been the most outspoken
supporter of Israel and opponent of a Palestinian state. He has
gained expertise on arms control during 12 years in Congress, where
he has compiled a liberal voting record on labor, environment and
health issues.
   Here is a look at where the Democrats stand on key issues:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>TAXES</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   
   Jackson would make the wealthiest 600,000 taxpayers pay at a
rate of 38.5 percent instead of the current top of 28 to 33
percent. He also would boost corporate taxes back to 1970s levels.
   Dukakis says, ``No serious candidate for president can rule out
the possibility of new taxes.'' But he says the first step is to
hire more Internal Revenue Service agents and ``collect every
dollar we can of that $110 billion that's not being paid today.''
   Gore has favored a top marginal tax rate of 33 percent for those
making more than $200,000 a year. ``If we are driven as a last
resort to new taxes, I will fight to ensure that we turn first to
those who can afford it,'' says Gore, who has suggested raising
nearly $1 billion with a 5 percent tax on luxury items, $10 billion
by keeping corporate taxes at their current level and $5 billion by
taxing the sale of inherited stocks on the basis of their original
value.
   Jackson supports an oil import fee; Gore has not ruled one out.
Dukakis is a vociferous opponent of such a tariff.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>BUDGET DEFICIT</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   
   Jackson claims he could reduce the deficit by $100 billion
annually by 1993 by freezing Pentagon spending for five years and
by his tax increases on the wealthy. But he has also proposed major
increases in social spending.
   Dukakis would scale back Star Wars research and save $50 billion
by scrapping the Midgetman missile. He says he would trim federal
programs and squeeze out waste, but cautions, ``We're not going to
get major cuts out of the domestic side of the budget. It's been
savaged over the past seven years.''
   Gore says he would ``convene a summit of our nation's leaders on
economics to forge a national consensus on how best to tackle our
budget deficit.'' He proposed eliminating subsidies for junk mail,
cutting corporate farm subsidies and eliminating ``the $40 billion
of unnecessary medical diagnostics'' that the government pays for
each year.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>MILITARY</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   
   All three candidates oppose the Strategic Defense Initiative.
Dukakis and Gore would scale back basic research in the field to
pre-Star Wars levels.
   Jackson proposes saving $40 billion by not building two new
aircraft carrier task forces, and ``tens of billions of dollars''
by negotiating further arms reductions with the Soviets. He opposes
building the Midgetman missile, the Stealth bomber, the Trident D-5
missile, or any more MX missiles.
   Dukakis opposes the Midgetman. He contends that until the United
States and Soviets can agree on reducing conventional forces,
savings on strategic weapons must be invested in strengthening U.S.
non-nuclear forces.
   Dukakis opposes the B-1 bomber, but favors development of the
Stealth bomber.
   Gore is a stalwart supporter of the single-warhead Midgetman
missile, and helped win congressional approval for it in exchange
for limiting production of the multi-warhead MX missile to 50.
   Like his rivals, Gore opposed military aid to the Contras, but
has voted in the past for humanitarian aid for the Nicaraguan
rebels. Gore fought Reagan administration efforts to revive the B-1
bomber, then voted to limit production to 100.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>MIDDLE EAST</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   
   Gore does not support creation of a Palestinian state. Dukakis
has refused to rule it out. Jackson supports an independent
homeland for Palestians. All three say the Arab nations must
recognize Israel's right to exist.
   Jackson, who once met with Palestinian Liberation Organization
leader Yasser Arafat, now says he would not do it again. But he
calls current U.S. policy ``fatally flawed'' and favors ``an
international conference on the Middle East involving all the
parties concerned, including the chosen representatives of the
Palestinian people.''
   Dukakis has said Arab leaders' refusal to negotiate with Israel
is to blame for the current Palestinian strife; he says Israel
should not be forced to relinquish all the land won in the 1967 war.
   Gore refused to join 30 Senate colleagues in sending a letter of
protest to the Israel government on its handling of the unrest;
Dukakis has said he would have signed the letter.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>ABORTION</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   
   Dukakis and Jackson fully support women's legal right to
abortion and federal funding for abortions.
   Gore opposes a constitutional ban on abortions, but has voted to
limit federal tax dollars for abortions.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>EDUCATION</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   
   Jackson would double the $21 billion Department of Education
budget and expand Head Start and other programs so that all
disadvantaged children could take part.
   Dukakis has proposed scholarships to attract more students into
teaching, and new tax breaks for families to save for college.
   Gore as called for more federal support for schools and Head
Start, but also suggested a longer school year and that teachers be
more accountable.

   Police shot and killed one person and
injured 12 others during a riot near Sylhet on the final day of
local council elections, an independent newspaper said Sunday.
   A total of nine people died and nearly 500 were injured during
the eight days of voting, which ended Saturday.
   Last week's voting in 5,000 election districts had been
postponed because of violence on Feb. 10, when the country's other
16,000 districts elected their local councils. At least 100 people
died and 5,000 were injured in the February election violence.
   Saturday's shooting was in the Goainhat district near Sylhet,
125 miles northeast of Dhaka, the Bengali-language Khabar said. The
newspaper said police were trying to stop a riot in which
supporters of rival candidates injured about 100 people with bombs
and bricks near the voting center.
   Election commission sources in Dhaka said voting in dozens of
districts were postponed again last week because of violence.
   The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, were unable to
give an exact number or to say when a third attempt to conduct
elections in those districts would be made.
   Council elections are not conducted along party lines, but the
contests are heated because of the amount of local power and
patronage involved.

   Evangelist Billy Graham preached his first sermon
in China, a fundamentalist teaching on the meaning of the cross, to
more than 1,500 believers in a Beijing church Sunday morning.
   ``I would like to bring greetings to you from Christians all
over the world,'' Graham said at the start of his hour-long sermon,
which was immediately translated into Chinese.
   ``Christians all over the world know about the church in China.
They think about you and they pray for you,'' he said.
   The 69-year-old Southern Baptist minister arrived five days ago
for his first visit to China at the invitation of the China
Christian Council and the Chinese People's Association for
Friendship with Foreign Countries.
   He will travel to Nanking, Shanghai and Canton before leaving
for Hong Kong at the end of the month.
   Church workers at the Chongwenmen church in central Beijing said
Graham's appearance was not announced beforehand to the
congregation and said Graham is known to very few Chinese
Christians.
   But the church's main and side sanctuaries were full, and
latecomers had to stand at the back, in the aisles and in the foyer.
   Some were Chinese who usually worship at other Beijing churches,
but many were foreigners, including a group of 27 Taiwanese
Presbyterians from Brazil.
   The Chinese, many of whom nod off during the
hour-and-a-half-long sermons by Chinese pastors, listened
attentively to Graham's message.
   ``I think he was very good,'' said second-year seminary student
Hu Qiuqiu. ``What he said hits right to the heart.''
   Her classmate, Zhao Guoxiong, said: ``He lifted up the name of
God. His message was Jesus Christ.''
   Graham preached that a person's heart changes when he becomes a
Christian.
   ``You have a great modernization program in China,'' he said.
``It is my prayer that there will be a great moral modernization
program also because that goes right to the heart.''

<HEAD>Senate May Curb Lobbying Lure for Government Officials</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID GOELLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate is talking seriously about putting
a padlock on the revolving door through which government officials
step into high-paying lobbying jobs, one of Washington's best-known
fringe benefits.
   Two top White House aides, Michael K. Deaver and Lyn Nofziger,
walked through that door, only to run afoul of current strictures
against influence peddling. Deaver was convicted of lying about his
activities; Nofziger was convicted of lobbying former colleagues
too soon after he quit.
   Countless generals and colonels have retired from the military
and taken their inside knowledge and Pentagon phone books to new
jobs with defense contractors. Political appointees and career
bureaucrats, similarly, can be regulators one day and employees of
the regulated the next. Several key members of Congress have quit
in recent years to join prestigious Washington law firms or head
trade associations _ thence returning to the Capitol Hill as
lobbyists to trade on their friendships.
   ``It's endemic to Washington,'' says Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, a
liberal Democrat from Ohio who has joined forces with conservative
Republican Strom Thurmond of South Carolina in trying to stem the
practice.
   ``One day you're a public servant and the next day you turn
around and you're peddling your influence,'' Metzenbaum says.
   The Senate is scheduled to vote Tuesday on the
Metzenbaum-Thurmond measure, intended to strengthen the 1978 Ethics
in Government Act. Nofziger, on appeal, is challenging the
constitutionality of the current law _ and presumably any successor
_ on ground that it impinges the right of free speech.
   The pending legislation is a landmark proposal in one respect.
Congress has consistently exempted itself from a variety of laws,
including the 1978 ethics statute, but it would be covered by the
anti-lobbying features of the new bill.
   ``That's the way it should be,'' Metzenbaum said Friday as the
Senate began debate on the bill. ``It's time we police ourselves,''
says Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., another cosponsor of the bill.
   The 1978 law says, in principle, that a top-level executive
branch person cannot lobby in his or her former agency for at least
a year after leaving the job.
   But the law lets the Office of Government Ethics define the
prohibited territory. Under its most recent rulings, a person who
worked in one section of the White House is free to immediately
lobby the other eight defined by OGE. Nofziger has noted,
unhappily, that if he had been accorded the benefit of the latest
interpretation, he could not have been charged in the first place,
since he didn't lobby the same White House office from which he
resigned.
   By OGE's interpretation, there are 200 sections of the Justice
Department, meaning an official who leaves one could lobby the
other 199 without problem.
   The Metzenbaum-Thurmond bill would change all that. It would put
departing members of Congress, all high-ranking judicial employees
and an estimated 45 senior administration officials on the
sidelines for a year _ when absolutely no lobbying of any branch of
the government would be allowed.
   Political appointees like assistant Cabinet secretaries and
heads of independent agencies would be barred from lobbying the
executive branch for a year. Career employees earning more than
$64,397 couldn't lobby their former agencies for a year. OGE would
no longer be able to divide agencies into sections. Congressional
aides earning over $64,397 _ there are 350 to 400 in the Senate
alone _ would face a similar prohibition.
   Current law is silent about lobbying on behalf of foreign
governments. The bill would ban this activity for 18 months by
former high-level executive and legislative branch employees.
   Penalties would be increased. Now, the maximum is two years in
prison and a $10,000 fine for a criminal conviction. The bill would
push this to five years and $250,000. A convicted defendant could
also be forced to pay twice what was earned through illegal
lobbying.
   ``This will make government a place of public service, not a
halfway House for making contacts,'' said Metzenbaum. ``While
influence peddling may have reached new lows, it's not unique to
any administration ... (although) the `sleaze factor' has become a
new household phrase.''
   Sen. Warren Rudman, R-N.H., is opposing the bill, calling it ``a
compilation of slogans, misplaced suggestions and muddled thinking.
... It's possibly unconstitutional and bad public policy.''
   ``This bill is so draconian that many distinguished Americans
... simply will not come into government,'' said Rudman, who
succeeded Friday in getting supporters to agree to amendments that
may make the proposal even tougher to get through Congress.
   One amendment would make it illegal for attorneys to even
practice before a federal court for a year after leaving Congress
or a top government job. Another would prohibit outside jobs by
members of Congress. The Senate has a rule against this, the House
doesn't.
   A third Rudman amendment would repeal the law that allows
members of Congress elected before 1980 to keep excess campaign
funds for personal use, so long as they pay income tax on the money.

<HEAD>Timing of Iran-Contra Trial Could Play Role in Reaction to Pardons</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The timing of the Iran-Contra criminal trial
of Oliver L. North and John M. Poindexter could play a major role
in determining public reaction to a pardon by President Reagan,
experts say.
   However, the experts disagree whether a pretrial or post-trial
pardon _ if Reagan should decide to take that course _ would be
more acceptable to Americans.
   Some of the university professors and senators interviewed by
The Associated Press said pardons before trial would be more
acceptable. This way, the prosecution would not get a chance to
bring out potentially damaging evidence.
   But others said pardons before trial would bring an immediate
assumption of guilt, and they suggested that Reagan await a
conviction if he wanted to forgive the defendants.
   If there is no trial or verdict by next January, according to
this view, Reagan should leave office without taking action.
   The issue is not merely an academic argument, because the trial
date is a hotly contested pretrial matter in the courtroom of U.S.
District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell.
   Independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh said last week he'll by
ready for trial in July, but the defense team sought a March 1989
trial date for North, a former National Security Council staffer;
Poindexter, Reagan's former national security adviser; and two men
recruited by North, retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard V. Secord
and his business partner, Albert Hakim.
   The four face charges that they stole government property as
they conducted secret arms sales to Iran and aided the Nicaraguan
Contras during congressional bans on such assistance.
   The 23-count indictment charges the four ran the Iran-Contra
affair as a broad criminal conspiracy to defraud the government and
to cover up their actions. North, Secord, and Hakim are accused of
personally enriching themselves as a result of the Iran-Contra
affair.
   Taking the view that a pretrial pardon would be the right
course, Walter Dellinger, a Duke University law professor, said,
``If the prosecution can prove the heart of this case, which is
more about embezzlement than aiding the Contras, pardons will cause
a much greater storm (after trial).''
   Dellinger added, ``This may look like a very different case
after trial than it did after the congressional hearings, one the
public is far less likely to view charitably.''
   Sen. Charles E. Grassley, R-Iowa, a member of Senate Judiciary
Committee, said pardons would be ``tougher to justify'' before
trial.
   The defendants would be ``presumed guilty all the time'' if
pardoned before trial, Grassley suggested. If the trial has not
begun when Reagan leaves office in January, Grassley said, the
defendants would ``have to rely on the good will of another
president.''
   Citing former President Gerald Ford's pardon of Richard Nixon,
Grassley said he's ``not sure'' Reagan ``wants to make his place in
history by pardoning people. It didn't do Jerry Ford any good.''
   The pardon may have cost Ford the presidential election of 1976
and is the most remembered act of his presidency.
   Reagan has not taken an official position on pardoning any of
the defendants. On April 6, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater
said, ``I have raised the issue with the president four or five
times myself. I've heard it raised by others, and every time the
president says the same thing, which is, `I'm not discussing
pardons.'''
   Sen. Orrin G. Hatch, R-Utah, said pardons would be easier before
a trial to ``spare America this pain'' of reliving the Iran-Contra
affair in the courtroom. Hatch was a member of the Senate
Iran-Contra committee.
   William Leuchtenburg, professor of history at the University of
North Carolina, said a pretrial pardon would be more difficult for
Reagan, ``because of the gaffe'' he made on March 25 _ when he
appeared to prejudge the case by predicting an innocent verdict.
   Reagan said then, ``I still think Ollie North is a hero'' and
added, ``I just have to believe they're going to be found innocent
because I don't think they were guilty of any lawbreaking or any
crime.''
   Later that day, White House Chief of Staff Howard Baker said
Reagan was expressing a personal view, adding, ``I think the
president made it abundantly clear that he expects the legal
process to run its course.''
   Leuchtenburg said the worst scenario for Reagan would be if a
trial was under way at the time he's ready to leave office.
   ``That would create an all but impossible situation for a
pardon,'' he said. ``That would really produce a cry of outrage. It
would particularly disturb the legal community by taking something
away from the legal process, and undercutting the judge and jury.''
   James David Barber, a Duke political science professor, said
``Pardoning in advance of their trial is wrong. The evidence is the
wrongness recognized by the American people in Ford's pardon of
Nixon. There was surprise that the president's rating plummeted so
fast after the public rallied around him as the new president.
   ``Some people say you go down in history. Some say you get
written up in history. I would suspect if Reagan did it (grant
pardons), it would be a mark on the scroll of history, but on the
down side.''

Collapse</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   House investigators Sunday recommended
tightening government ethics laws in the wake of involvement by two
former administration officials in allowing a now-defunct,
multimillion-dollar health care operation to sidestep Medicare
rules.
   Rep. Ted Weiss, D-N.Y., said the case involving former
presidential aide Lyn Nofziger, former Medicare administrator C.
McClain Haddow and the Florida-based International Medical Centers
Inc. is ``a classic case of conflict of interest, involving greedy
federal officials whose selfish actions could have caused great
harm to Medicare patients.''
   A House Government Operations subcommittee headed by Weiss
alleged that after he left the White House, Nofziger received at
least $300,000 from the company to try to influence officials of
the Department of Health and Human Services.
   The subcommittee's investigative report said Nofziger lobbied
Haddow to waive for IMC a legal requirement that at least half the
enrollees of a health maintenance organization, or HMO, which
offers prepaid health care, be private rather than Medicare
patients.
   The House panel said Haddow, who was then acting administrator
of the Health Care Financing Administration, overruled his staff
and waived the 50 percent rule. After he left the Medicare agency,
the report said, Haddow received a $40,000 consultant's fee from
IMC.
   The 50 percent regulation is intended to ensure that HMOs
treating Medicare patients are competent enough to attract private
clients. IMC had been receiving $360 million a year from Medicare
to provide health care for 130,000 of its up to 200,000 members,
according to the Florida insurance department that seized control
of the company and sold its operations to Humana, a large
health-care firm based in Kentucky.
   Neither Nofziger nor Haddow has been charged with any crime in
their dealings with IMC. Both have been sentenced on other charges,
however.
   Nofziger on April 8 was sentenced to 90 days in prison and fined
$30,000 for illegally lobbying high-level administration officials
on three other occasions after he resigned his White House job as
President Reagan's political director. Haddow pleaded guilty last
July to conflict of interest violations involving accepting $33,450
from a private foundation, and was sentenced to 90 days in prison
and fined $15,000.
   Nofziger has challenged the current ethics laws and denied any
impropriety in his lobbying activities. Haddow in the past has
declined to discuss IMC.
   ``My greatest concern is that current ethics laws may continue
to allow the kinds of conflicts found in the report,'' Weiss said.
``Ethics law reform should include provisions to close these
loopholes.''
   The report also said Juan del Real quit his post as general
counsel at the Department of Health and Human Services to become a
$325,000-a-year executive with IMC.
   The company was dropped from the Medicare program in May 1987
after its president, Miguel Recarey Jr., was indicted on labor
racketeering charges. Since he fled the country, Recarey has been
indicted on additional charges of embezzling more than $350,000
from the Medicare program.
   The House panel said IMC received $11.9 million in government
overpayments because of the negligence of officials in Haddow's
former agency.
   At its peak, IMC had the highest number of Medicare participants
of any HMO in the country _ its 130,000 patients live in five
Florida counties _ and had received $977 million from Medicare in
the six years before it was suspended.

   Zhao Ziyang, leader of the Chinese Communist
Party, sees himself as a golfing grandfather who hates to lose his
temper.
   Zhao didn't exactly bare his soul, but he did provide some rare
insights into his personal life during an interview Saturday with
French television station TF1.
   The official China News Service, in a report appearing Saturday
in this British colony, said Zhao described himself as a person
with a relatively gentle disposition who does not like to lose his
temper.
   The 69-year-old party leader also confessed he's happiest when
one of his ideas is implemented and people comment favorably, the
report said.
   Zhao doesn't burn the midnight oil at the office, typically
working nine hours a day, it said. He spends his free time walking,
jogging, swimming and golfing, a sport he has been learning for
more than a year.
   The party chief was quoted as saying he has five children, two
granddaughters and two grandsons.
   The report said Zhao discussed his personal life during a
15-minute walk along a lake in the compound.
   Zhao, Deng Xiaoping and other top Chinese leaders rarely give
interviews. An interview with Zhao by Tom Brokaw of NBC-TV made
front pages of the Chinese press last fall.

   An explosives expert was killed

   Four other experts lost their limbs and several others suffered
minor injuries when the bomb exploded at the Ojeri camp, site of
the April 10 blast that sent rockets, missiles and other weapons
into the sky.
   The official death toll for the explosion rose to 100 Sunday
when four more people died of their wounds in hospitals. More than
1,000 were injured.
   The army has been blowing up unexploded projectiles at the camp,
between the capital, Islamabad, and its twin city, Rawalpindi.

<HEAD>Crude Oil Production, Demand for Natural Gas Expected to Increase</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Domestic crude oil production in the 1990s
should be higher than previously expected and demand for natural
gas will be markedly higher, according to the Energy Department's
annual forecast.
   The department's Energy Information Administration said oil
prices will be slower to rise in the decade than it projected in
last year's forecast, and natural gas prices will be much lower.
   The import share of U.S. petroleum consumption won't be much
different at the end of the century from what was predicted last
year, EIA said.
   In their annual forecast released last week, the agency's
forecasters significantly raised prediction for U.S. crude oil
production in the year 2000 from 5.4 million barrels a day to 6.0
million barrels. Last year's production was about 8.3 million
barrels compared with 9.0 million barrels before the 1986 petroleum
price collapse.
   Richard Farmer, in charge of the petroleum forecast, said in an
interview Friday, ``There is no way you can avoid a decline'' in
U.S. production by the year 2000. Any major discoveries off
California or in Alaska, areas where explorers have high hopes,
could not be in significant production before then, he said.
   ``We have been significantly influenced here'' by the work of
William Fisher, chairman of the Department of Geological Sciences
at the University of Texas at Austin, Farmer said.
   Fisher reported last year that drilling efficiencies or finding
rates _ barrels of oil per foot of exploratory well drilled _ have
been remarkably stable, instead of declining as many predicted.
   Farmer, using slightly different calculations than Fisher, said
drillers are finding 25 barrels of crude oil per foot drilled, and
have been finding between 25 and 30 barrels for the past 10 years.
   In 1986, the most recent year for which full drilling statistics
are available, drilling dropped off drastically. But efficiency
``didn't change much,'' and may have blipped upward as the least
effective drilling rigs were idled, Farmer said.
   The projections say crude oil, now about $18 a barrel, will
reach $20.37 in 1994 and $30.76 in 2000. Last year's forecast
predicted that $20 a barrel would be reached in 1992, and the price
in 2000 would be $32.87.
   These prices are average cost to U.S. refineries of imported
supplies in dollars of 1987 buying power.
   Demand for petroleum products, including natural gas liquids,
should reach 18.3 million barrels a day in 2000 compared with last
year's projection of 17.4 million barrels. Demand last year was
about 16.5 million barrels per day.
   Imports, which were 35 percent of consumption last year, should
be about 56 percent in 2000, only a slight revision from last
year's prediction of 55 percent.
   In a major revision for natural gas, consumption of 19.7
trillion cubic feet per day was predicted for 2000, when the
average wellhead price is expected to be $4 per thousand cubic feet.
   Last year's forecast said the nation would use 18 trillion cubic
feet of gas in 2000 at a price of $5.50.
   Consumption last year was about 16.8 trillion cubic feet, and
the current average wellhead price is about $1.75. Usage has never
reached the peaks of the early 1970s, 23 trillion cubic feet, and
probably won't get that high again in this century.
   ``This year's view is based on the flexibility gas producers
have demonstrated recently in meeting competition, both from other
gas suppliers and from suppliers of other fuels,'' the EIA analysts
wrote. ``Increases (in consumption) after 1995 are likely to be
especially significant as competitive natural gas prices and the
increased use of (gas-burning) combined cycle units by electric
utilities push demand for this fuel upward.''
   Predicted coal use was reduced slightly, from 1.2 billion tons
in 2000 to 1.1 billion tons. The report noted the entry of new
producing countries in world trade such as China, Venezuela and
Colombia, which will compete with U.S. exports.
   The petroleum demand projection assumes that new cars, currently
averaging 27 miles per gallon, will average 34 mpg in the year
2000, and that people will use cars and trucks about as much as
they do now. Economic growth, expressed as the average annual
change in the gross national product, was predicted to be 2.3
percent per year in the new forecast vs. 2.4 percent last year.
   The report also assumes that the overall energy efficiency of
the economy should improve, though more slowly than in the recent
past. The energy used for a dollar's production of goods and
services, which fell by 2.5 percent per year from 1976 through
1986, will fall at 1.0 percent per year, the report said.

<HEAD>FAA To Expand Airplane-By-Airplane Inspections to Continental</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Transportation Secretary Jim Burnley said
Sunday the department will expand its airplane-to-airplane
inspection to a second Texas Air Corp. subsidiary, Continental
Airlines, beginning Monday.
   The planned inspection comes less than a week after the Federal
Aviation Administration began checking Eastern Airlines, a major
carrier in the Texas Air empire _ the nation's largest airline
company. The FAA also slapped Eastern with $823,000 in fines for
violating safety regulations.
   ``We're going to extend the ramp inspections, intensive
inspection, that we began on Eastern last Wednesday to Continental
as well, beginning tomorrow,'' Burnley said on NBC-TV's ``Meet the
Press.''
   The Transportation Department head said the inquiry will ``be
just like the Eastern investigation.''
   ``We'll have people who'll be walking around the planes and
through them and talking to the maintenance personnel and the folks
in the cockpit and making sure that anything that can be readily
identified is correct,'' he said.
   In another development, Burnley said the department found
``almost a million dollars'' in violations by Continental during a
review of the carrier's files at Texas Air.
   The violations, including some that Continental identified
itself, are ``being acted on,'' he said.
   ``They've swept their system and they've found in varying stages
we've got almost a million dollars in proposed penalties against
Continental,'' Burnley said. ``And in fairness, I should add some
of those at least were areas where Continental volunteered that
they had problems.''
   The airline has been notified of the penalties, according to
Burnley, and is considering whether to pay them voluntarily.
   Frank Lorenzo, chairman of Texas Air, said the planned
inspections were not a surprise, but promised that Continental
would cooperate with the department as Eastern has done.
   ``I'm not surprised in light of the environment that's going on
right now,'' Lorenzo said on the NBC program. ``I think it's
important to note that most of these incidents that the secretary
refers to are more than a year old, but Continental will comply and
do well under this just like Eastern.''
   Burnley reported that the department had inspected about 200 of
the 267 Eastern aircraft since Wednesday and grounded 19 of them.
   ``I think it's important to note that grounding does not mean
that the plane is still on the ground,'' he said. ``All it means
that a problem was identified and a problem was corrected before
the plane returned to service.''
   The Transportation Department head refused to speculate on
whether the 19 groundings, which represent about 10 percent of the
planes inspected, reflect an average or bad record.
   ``We want to go through this for 30 days and see what we find
and then we'll talk about patterns. ... I've got to emphasize that
virtually all the problems identified, and while many of them were
significant problems, were easily correctable so the plane was
returned to service in a couple of hours,'' Burnley said.
   The department also launched an investigation Wednesday into the
finances and management of the Houston-based Texas Air. Burnley
said the department's concerns were raised by evidence that Eastern
and Continental Airlines ``are under substantial, increasing
financial pressure.''
   Texas Air Corp. had record losses of $466 million last year and
its Eastern subsidiary has been plagued with labor turmoil. In
addition to Eastern and Continental, the company also owns Rocky
Mountain Airways, Britt Airways, Bar Harbor Airlines and
Provincetown-Boston Airlines.

   Newspaper Industry Failing To Meet Minority Goal
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>By PHYLLIS MESSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new survey shows the newspaper industry is
falling far short of its goal of making minority employment in the
newsroom equal to the percentage of minorities in the country by
the end of the century.
   The study by the American Society of Newspaper Editors indicates
a slow growth in minority newspaper employees in the past decade.
The percentage of blacks, Hispanics, Asians and American Indians in
the newsroom is 7.02 percent this year, the survey found, up from
6.56 percent in 1987 and 3.95 percent in 1978, the first year the
survey was done.
   But, Arnold Rosenfeld, editor of the Austin (Texas)
American-Statesman and chairman of the ASNE's minorities committee,
said last week, ``Such continued improvement is still not enough to
meet the ASNE goal.''
   The minority population in the United States in the year 2000 is
expected to be at least 25 percent. Minorities made up about 20
percent of the population in the 1980 census.
   In a report to the ASNE convention, Rosenfeld said the survey
also found that whites still dominate supervisory positions at
newspapers, with 95.9 percent of supervisors white and 4.1 percent
minorities. Down the ladder, 93.4 percent of copy editors, 92
percent of reporters and 90.7 percent of photographers are white.
   The ASNE study also showed that the majority of U.S. daily
newspapers still have no minority professionals on their staffs,
with minority hiring slowest at papers with circulations under
25,000.
   ``Obviously,'' Rosenfeld said, ``much needs to be done.''
   Katherine Fanning, editor of the Christian Science Monitor and
former president of the ASNE, singled out the poor minority-hiring
record of small newspapers in a speech to the ASNE convention.
   ``This is deplorable,'' she said, ``And it is a weakness which
must be corrected if we are to serve this country as we should.''
   The survey's findings also drew criticism from the president of
the National Association of Black Journalists, a 1,000-member group
based in Reston, Va.
   ``It's clear to me that whatever they are doing, they're not
getting the results we so desperately want,'' said DeWayne Wickham,
president of the black journalists group and a columnist for
Gannett News Service.
   ``The media plays a vital role in society. We shape what people
know about our society,'' Wickham added. ``And if the media is
manned by white men, then the perceptions the public gets will be
filtered through those people.''
   The ASNE survey is considered the most reliable measure of
minority employment at daily newspapers. This year's figures were
based on responses from 1,092 newspapers, representing 67 percent
of the 1,630 dailies in the country. The responses were projected
to the industry as a whole. The group said it did a follow-up study
of non-respondents two years ago and found that the projections
were accurate within three-tenths of a percentage point.
   The ASNE began surveying minority employment in 1978. That was
also the year the group adopted the goal of making the percentage
of minorities in the newsroom equal to the percentage of minorities
in the nation by the year 2000.
   Rosenfeld told the convention that the number of minority
employees is not the only measure of a newspaper's commitment to
minorities.
   ``The industry needs to remind itself that this is an issue that
goes beyond head count. You have to consider your coverage. ... You
have to find a way of making minorities part of the content-making
decisions,'' he said.

   The Democratic presidential candidates are
spending as much as $1,000 per second to reach New York television
viewers _ and hoping their messages aren't buried by local coverage
of gaffes and controversies.
   The richest trove of voters is in New York City. But that's also
where the TV prices are the highest, the media outlets are the most
plentiful and rambunctious, and the background noise often explodes
into the foreground.
   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, the front-runner, is trying
to communicate competence and experience with his television
advertisements. Jesse Jackson makes a populist appeal to
minorities, union members and farmers, while Tennessee Sen. Albert
Gore Jr. takes tough lines on trade and drugs.
   But voters are also learning what Mayor Ed Koch thinks of Jews
who support Jackson, how Gov. Mario Cuomo thinks Gore should
conduct his campaign, and why neither has endorsed Dukakis. They
are pondering Cuomo's reservations about Jackson's lack of
government experience, charges and counter-charges about the use of
nuclear force, and who came late or early to the war against drugs.
   Consultants and analysts liken the New York media to a jungle
and the race there to tag-team wrestling.
   ``It's loud, it's raucous, it's no-holds-barred, it's New York,
love it or leave it,'' said analyst Robert Lichter, co-director of
the Center for Media and Public Affairs in Washington.
   Lichter said New York may be the only city in the nation that
still has two tabloid newspapers, each ``competing to have bigger
headlines that say more outrageous things than the other.''
   He also said the city's notorious self-centeredness,
immortalized in a New Yorker magazine cover map that showed a huge
New York adjoining a tiny United States, has helped shape the race.
   ``You didn't see Iowa politicians dominating the coverage in
Iowa,'' Lichter said. ``But in New York, it's a Koch vs. Cuomo
contest because New Yorkers are most interested in other New
Yorkers.''
   The tumultuous New York media coverage may actually raise the
level of voter awareness, some consultants said, although voters
may not be seeing and hearing exactly what the candidates want them
to.
   ``The more people you have talking about politics, the greater
the odds are that the average voter will at least hear something or
read something that's of use in making a decision,'' said Larry
Sabato, a political media expert at the University of Virginia.
   The candidates are paying a lot of money in their attempts to
break through the cacophony with their own carefully honed themes.
   Industry sources say it costs from $10,000 to upwards of $30,000
to buy 30 seconds of prime time advertising on a local New York
City television station, depending on the popularity of the
program. That compares to an average of $500 _ maybe $1,000 during
a blockbuster show _ for 30 seconds in Des Moines.
   Gore, who hopes to spend $1 million on media, borrowed $100,000
last week last week to try to meet that goal. Jackson budgeted
$500,000 _ $300,000 in New York City, $100,000 upstate and $100,000
on Spanish-language ads.
   The Dukakis campaign estimated it would spend between $500,000
and $1.5 million, depending on what the others forked out.
   The frenzied atmosphere ``makes it more difficult, certainly, to
get through,'' said Dukakis spokesman Steve Akey. ``But we feel our
message is very strong and clear and punches through the clutter
straight to the voters.''
   Dukakis was continuing through the weekend with a biographical
spot, an anti-drug ad, a spot stressing his responsibilities as a
chief executive and another in which he speaks Spanish.
   Jackson was running five ads, among them an Iowa farmer's
endorsement, an anti-drug spot by filmmaker Spike Lee, an ad
showing him confronting Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, and a
commercial in Spanish.
   Gore, the future of his candidacy on the line, was making the
most effort outside New York City. He was running four ads
statewide, in addition to a new Koch endorsement in the city. In
the ad, Koch, standing on the porch of Gracie Mansion, says Gore
understands the needs of cities and has fought for the homeless and
against drugs.
   ``And in the critical area of foreign policy, where there is no
margin for error, Al Gore is head and shoulders above the rest,''
Koch says.
   Gore brought in veteran media strategist David Garth to
orchestrate his last-ditch effort. But another veteran, Tony
Schwartz, said Gore's move came too late to do any good and
criticized the other candidates for a similar lack of foresight.
   ``One has to come in ahead of time, raise proper money and spend
it wisely. They didn't do any of those things. None of them. And
their stuff is equally bad,'' said Schwartz, who has worked for
Lyndon Johnson, Hubert Humphrey, Edward Kennedy and Jimmy Carter,
among others.
   Schwartz touched a nerve during Johnson's 1964 campaign with a
famous ad against Barry Goldwater. The spot showed a little girl
frolicking in a field of daisies _ and ended with a mushroom cloud.
   This time around, Schwartz contended, the presidential
candidates have failed to connect emotionally with voters in their
living rooms _ including himself.
   ``I wear a button,'' he said. ``It says: `Don't vote, you'll
only encourage them.'''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congress should consider halting the Air Force
program to upgrade the problem-plagued B-1B bomber because the new
plane will be obsolete, a key congressman said in a speech released
Sunday.
   ``We should consider now whether it's worth spending any more
money to make the B-1B operable but obsolescent,'' said Rep. Les
Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the House Armed Services Committee.
   The Air Force, in a statement, disputed Aspin's contentions and
noted that he has long opposed the bomber.
   Aspin's comments were contained in a speech, released Sunday,
which he plans to give Monday on the floor of the House. It is the
latest in a series of addresses in which Aspin is outlining the
results of a lengthy investigation by his committee into new atomic
weapons begun during the Reagan presidency.
   The B-1 was killed by President Carter, but Reagan resurrected
it six years ago, saying the nation needed to buy 100 of the
swing-wing planes to replace the aging B-52s as the atomic bombers
in the nation's nuclear arsenal. Reagan also gave the go-ahead for
development of the radar-evading ``stealth'' bomber.
   Congress authorized 100 of the B-1Bs for a total cost of $20.5
billion, but the Air Force now says it will cost up to $3 billion
more to fix ``electronic counter-measures (ECM)'' that will permit
the B-1B to evade Soviet air defenses.
   It will be at least 1991 before the B-1B has the ECM
capabilities it was supposed to have in 1986, according to Aspin.
   ``My concern is that the B-1B will never work as advertised
because of the time it's taking to fix the problem _ time during
which Soviet air defenses are improving,'' Aspin said.
   ``The bomber's electronic counter-measures will be fixed at
great cost only to meet more effective defenses. Or, at best, it
will be rendered redundant by the B-2 (stealth). Either way, we
will have spent billions for something we didn't need.''
   In a response, Gen. Lawrence D. Welch, Air Force chief of staff,
said, ``Aspin's opposition to the B-1B predates the first assembly
of the first aircraft and should be considered in that context.''
   He said Air Force pilots have repeatedly praised the plane and
he said it is a major addition to the nation's nuclear arsenal.
Like the B-52, said Welch, the B-1B should ``contribute to
deterrence for 30 years or more.''
   Welch admitted that ``we are behind the original schedule for
developing the ECM.'' But he added that ``ECM is by its nature, a
constant contest as we improve penetration capability and the
soviets improve air defenses.''

   A murder trial that had spectators lining
up an hour early to get seats ended with a recommended death
sentence for a man charged with killing seven relatives, but
residents still don't understand why the crimes were committed.
   ``I'm happy it's all over, so we can start forgetting,'' said
Frank Dugan, an elderly neighbor of some of the victims.
   ``I think we can go on with our lives now,'' said Darlene
Beisiegel after watching jurors find James E. Schnick guilty of
first-degree murder in connection with a shooting spree that killed
Mrs. Beisiegel's oldest daughter, her four grandsons and two others.
   The jurors also recommended the judge sentence Schnick to death.
No sentencing date was set.
   Schnick, a dairy farmer, was tried for the deaths of his wife,
Julie, and two nephews, Kirk Buckner, 14, and Michael Buckner, 2.
   Also killed were Schnick's brother-in-law, Steve Buckner;
Buckner's wife and Mrs. Beisiegel's daughter, Jeannette; and the
Buckner's two other sons, Dennis, 8, and Timmy, 6. Buckner and Mrs.
Schnick were brother and sister.
   The prosecutor reserved those four cases for possible later
trial had he not gained convictions in this trial.
   The victims died in a shooting spree Sept. 25 at two dairy farms
near Elkland, a community of about 200 people 10 miles southeast of
Marshfield.
   Dugan said he could not bring himself to go to the trial. But he
stayed near his radio, waiting to hear the verdict, handed down
Thursday, and sentence, recommended Friday.
   ``I leave the house every day and see it (Buckner house) right
there. It's on my mind every day because I'm right in the middle of
it,'' Dugan said Friday.
   The jurors took 2{ hours to decide on a death sentence for
Schnick, the only alternative to life in prison without possibility
of parole in a case of first-degree murder.
   ``I don't want him to be put to death, I just want him (on death
row) where he can't get out,'' Mrs. Beisiegel said. ``The ones with
life sentences can get out on the grounds, they can interact with
each other. They have rights, and I don't think he deserves rights.
He didn't give them any rights.''
   Initially, based on statements given by Schnick, authorities
blamed Kirk for the shooting spree. But Schnick confessed Oct. 5.
   Mrs. Beisiegel and her neighbors crowded into the courtroom for
the week-long trial to sit for eight or nine hours each day.
   ``Julie (Schnick) was a friend of mine,'' said Diane Davenport.
``I just wanted to see it happen. There's so much small-town gossip
that people wanted to see how much was true.''
   Spectators arrived at least an hour before testimony was to
begin, time enough to be searched by security officers and to be
sure of getting one of the 100 or so seats on hard benches.
   ``We come early and stay all day,'' said Maxine Sutton, of
Elkland, who accompanied Mrs. Beisiegel. ``We take turns going to
lunch and the restroom, so we don't lose our seats.''
   Mrs. Sutton explained the large turnout.
   ``They're here for the same reason I am _ to find out what
happened and to see justice done,'' she said.
   ``I just wanted to know why he did it,'' Mrs. Beisiegel said.
   But she said the trial brought her no closer to understanding
why Schnick, described as a dependable neighbor and loving father,
turned on his family.
   Prosecutors speculated that Schnick killed his wife in order to
collect her life insurance, which totaled $100,000. County
prosecutor Donald Cheever also said Mrs. Schnick was aware that her
husband had a mistress and may have enlisted the support of her
brother and his family when she asked Schnick for a divorce,
igniting his anger against them all.
   The defense countered that Schnick told officers Buckner had
molested his sister when the two were young, and threatened Schnick
when Mrs. Schnick pressured him to seek psychiatric care. Attorneys
hinted that such family tension could have led Kirk to commit the
murders, as Schnick originally claimed.

   Patriot's Day, which commemorates the start of the
Revolutionary War in these parts, has become an occasion of much
spectacle, including the Boston Marathon and a re-enactment of a
much earlier race: Paul Revere's ride.
   The living Paul Revere, great-great-great-grandson of the
silversmith, has a different plan for Monday's state holiday:
``Goof off.''
   The man wearing tricorn, cloak and riding boots and riding the
horse will be 72-year-old Harold Snow of Wellesley, a brigadier
general in the Massachusetts National Lancers. The ceremonial
militia founded in 1836 has been re-enacting the ride Paul Revere
took from Boston the night of April 18, 1775, for decades, more or
less factually.
   This year, Patriot's Day was stretched to cover the weekend with
parades, dances and restaged battles, including the one at
Lexington where the shot heard round the world was fired.
   Others have retraced the historic 13-mile route Revere made
famous 213 years ago. Two years ago Ashrita Furman, a world-class
hand-clapper and underwater pogo-stick hopper, set a world record
by somersaulting all the way.
   It's an occasion the real Paul Revere prefers to sit out.
   ``Number one. I don't ride horses,'' he said. In his late 50s
and living in a Massachusetts town he prefers to keep secret, this
Paul Revere does appreciate his heritage, however.
   He was a featured guest on ``To Tell the Truth,'' the 1960s TV
game show. He shared a laugh with Miles Standish, a descendant of
the Mayflower colonist. And he has learned how to brush off pesky
questions about where he keeps his horse.
   ``Probably the most fascinating thing is when you meet people
for the first time and they jump back almost, as if people in
history might not have relatives,'' said Revere. He is president of
the Paul Revere Memorial Association, which owns the 1680 house in
Boston's North End where his ancestor lived.
   Revere said he planned to ``goof off'' on Patriot's Day, taking
a break from his job as marketing chief at Revere Copper Products,
an industrial metals company in New Bedford.
   He won't even be present for the re-enacted ride, which isn't
entirely faithful to historic fact.
   The original Paul Revere set out the night of April 18 to warn
Samuel Adams and John Hancock in Lexington and others in Concord
that British soldiers were assembling on Boston Common. Gen. Thomas
Gage, commander in chief of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, had
ordered a detachment of 700 men to go to Concord and destroy
supplies and arrest Adams and Hancock.
   Revere left his house at 10 p.m. He took a boat across the
Charles River to Charlestown, borrowed a horse and trotted into
Lexington at midnight. After alerting Adams and Hancock, he was
joined by William Dawes and Dr. Samuel Prescott and all three
headed for Concord.
   On the way they were snared by British troops. Only Prescott
escaped to complete the ride.
   The 20th century re-enactment goes only as far as Lexington,
following the same time schedule except for swapping night time for
day so the public can watch.
   And in this version Dawes, played by Lancer Lt. Douglas
Dougherty, leaves from Boston's Roxbury section with the same 10
a.m. start-off as Revere and the two wind up in Lexington for the
finale.
   The real Revere just knocked on doors. Snow will shout, ``The
British are coming!''
   And as they race through the suburban countryside, Snow and
Dougherty will be preceded by police cars and followed by two
stand-ins on horseback, in case of an accident.
   This year is Snow's seventh stint as Revere.
   ``It just gives me a good feeling,'' he said. ``The kids get a
big kick out of it. People shake hands with you. Everybody's
yelling, `Hi Paul, Hi Paul.' It's a lot of thrill.''

   The PLO's assassinated army chief called for a
military escalation in the Palestinian uprising in his last
interview, published Sunday.
   Answering questions in the Kuwaiti newspaper al-Anbaa, Khalil
al-Wazir was quoted as saying the four-month-old confrontation in
the Israeli-occupied territories was moving into a second stage
involving increased use of military force.
   Seven masked commandos burst into the Khalil's home in suburban
Tunis, Tunisia, early Saturday and opened fire with submachine
guns, killing him, two bodyguards and a gardener.
   Al-Wazir, 52, also called Abu Jihad, was the most senior
Palestine Liberation Organization official assassinated since
Fatah, the largest guerrilla group in the PLO, was founded in 1964.
He was PLO chairman Yasser Arafat's closest aide, led the group's
main army, and supervised military operations inside the
Israeli-occupied Gaza Strip and West Bank.
   News reports have linked Israel to the killings, but the }nment
has refused to comment on them.
   In Sunday's interview, al-Wazir said the next stage of the
uprising ``involves commando operations against select Israeli
military targets.''
   ``These operations will shore up the morale of our people in the
occupied territories, because such operations will be directed
against those who act as tools of extremely brutal oppression,
beatings and bone-breakings,'' he said.
   Al-Wazir's assassination unleashed a new spate of rioting in the
occupied territories, causing more than a dozen deaths.
   In the interview, al-Wazir said new operations would include
building up the uprising's own military organization and
distribution of such weapons as Molotov bombs, flame and lead
balls, and arrows.
   He also talked of stepped-up use of guerrilla raids outside the
occupied territories.
   Israeli experts say al-Wazir was responsible for a list of
bloody attacks, such as the 1975 takeover of the Savoy Hotel in Tel
Aviv in which 11 hostages were slain and a March 1978 bus hijacking
in which 33 Israelis were killed and 82 wounded.
   In the uprising against Israeli occupation, Palestinians so far
have fought the heavily armed Israeli security forces mainly with
stones. PLO officials were reported to order them to avoid guns to
help gain international sympathy.
   In his interview, al-Wazir said the Palestinian uprising ``will
continue until the Palestinian flag is hoisted in the heart of
Jerusalem as the capital of the independent Palestinian state.''
   Israel considers Jersualem its capital.

   North met South, stereotypes melted and horizons
expanded this weekend as 13 teen-age girls from Mississippi arrived
to sample the culture and delights of the big city.
   ``I didn't think they were going to be so modern,'' said Kina
Stone, a ninth grader at Chicago's Whitney Young High School. ``We
thought they were going to have straw hats, overalls and wear no
makeup ... but they were pretty much like us.''
   The Greenville, Miss., girls met with a group of inner-city
minority girls from the METRO Achievement Program during a weekend
trip sponsored by Greenville-based Daisy M. Greene National
Association.
   The group is a nonprofit organization dedicated to the services
of minority youth and elderly.
   ``If I could bring one thing from Chicago back to Mississippi,
it would be the Sears Tower, because it's big,'' Daisy Jackson, 17,
said Sunday, after a look at the world's tallest building.
   Miss Jackson said she would love to return, ``as long as I know
I can go back home to Greenville. I'm used to a small town and
slower pace.''
   The girls talked about shopping and exchanged addresses so they
could keep the North-South exchange going after the visit by
becoming pen pals.
   ``I like corresponding with people in different places,'' said
Narsauinika Sprouse, a 15-year-old from Greenville. ``There's a lot
you can put in a letter you might not want to say in person.''
   Marlene Seja, 16, of Chicago, said meeting the Mississippians
and corresponding with them would help her ``get a feel of life
outside Chicago.''
   ``We're so much in Chicago that we want to know what life is
like in the outside world,'' she said.
   Packed into the Mississippi girls' short visit was a trip to the
DuSable Museum of Black Art, a performance by the Alvin Ailey
American Dance Theater, and a sightseeing tour of Chicago.
   ``I got to see a lot of things about culture that I didn't even
know about, and the Alvin Ailey dancers were incredible,'' said
Chandrika Rankin, 16, after attending a Saturday night performance
by the New York-based group.
   The DuSable museum especially impressed visitor Lorarine Loving,
15.
   ``I like the in-depthness of the history there,'' she said.
``There is not enough taught in the schools, and it was just there
waiting for you to come and see it.
   ``I learned that a lot of things were invented by the black man,
but because they didn't have the power to get a patent, the white
man had a patent on it.''
   Although some of the girls were excited about the cultural
exposure, several said the airplane flight and a promised trip to a
shopping mall were the highlights.
   ``To come to Chicago, of course, is new, exciting and different.
Because our town is so small, we don't have museums and cultural
things,'' said Kenya Anderson, a 15-year-old from Mississippi.
   Miss Anderson said she most looked forward to ``meeting people,
going to the museum and going to the mall.'' The ninth grader said
she especially hoped to pick up some Chicago Bears T-shirts.
   Kimberly Womback, 14, said she had been to Chicago three times
previously to visit relatives.
   ``There's a big difference'' between Chicago and Greenville,
which has about 39,000 residents, she said. Chicago ``is a big city
with lots of people to meet and places to go.''
   Mary Wiley of Chicago, chairman of the board of the Daisy M.
Greene group, said she hatched the idea while visiting the
Mississippi city.
   ``I thought the Greenville youngsters should be exposed to
culture outside their own environment, and Chicago _ with all the
performing arts here _ is an ideal place,'' she said.

<HEAD>Legislature To Consider Huge Budget Cuts</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Legislature convenes for its annual
session Monday facing $900 million in proposed state budget cuts
from a governor who has been in office barely a month.
   Gov. Buddy Roemer outlined a bare-bones $5 billion budget last
week that calls for a 36-hour work week, down from a 40-hour week
to accomplish a 10 percent pay cut for most state employees, and
sharp reductions in state aid to local governments.
   Teachers, however, would get a 5 percent raise under the plan.
   ``We've had to do 16 years worth of work in five months to clean
up the biggest fiscal mess in Louisiana history,'' the governor,
who has been working with a transition team since shortly after his
election in November, told the Joint Legislative Committee on the
Budget.
   According to administration figures, the state faces an
accumulated deficit of $1.2 billion going back to 1982 when the oil
boom ended, and a $210 million cash shortage for the remainder of
the fiscal year ending in June.
   As promised, Roemer presented a budget plan based upon current
revenue projections and minus tax increases.
   ``In order to balance the budget, we have had to make some hard,
hard, hard decisions,'' Roemer said. ``Frankly, in our state, that
is long overdue.''
   In order to produce a balanced spending plan based on current
revenues, about $900 million will have to be cut from the $5.9
billion budget adopted last year, said Commissioner of
Administration Brian Kendrick.
   Using emergency powers granted during a special lawmaking
session shortly after Roemer took office on March 15, the
administration has cut spending and seized agency surpluses to
provide more than $30 million for the general fund. Scores of
emergency fee increases for state services also are on tap.
   The state is planning to sell up to $250 million in short-term
notes to provide enough cash through June 30 and has launched a
plan to sell long-term bonds to pay off the $1.2 billion debt.
   To provide more cash against a projected cash shortage, the
administration is delaying one state payday until the next fiscal
year, holding off on state contributions to government retirement
systems and putting off state income tax refunds until August.
   During the regular session, Roemer also plans to present his
plans to overhaul public education, the state's system of colleges
and universities, put stringent limitations on campaign
contributions and beef up environmental protection.
   A special legislative session, tentatively set for July after
the regular 85-day meeting ends, will deal with overhauling the
state's tax structure, administration officials said.
   Lawmakers will not receive a complete budget proposal for at
least another week.
   The new budget will determine priorities for the coming years as
Louisiana faces the prospect of a no-growth economy, Kendrick said.
   Kendrick acknowledged that local governments would be left with
funding problems if state revenue sharing payments are eliminated,
but said that the state must change its priorities now that oil
revenues have dried up.

<TEXT>
   More than 5,000 Poles paid homage to the
heroes of the Jewish Ghetto Uprising at an unsanctioned rally
Sunday, then retraced the route of condemned Jews to the
deportation site for the Nazi death camps.
   In a tribute under bright sunlight in front of the Monument to
the Heroes of the Warsaw Ghetto, the 1943 uprising's last commander
in Poland, Marek Edelman, and leaders of the banned trade union
Solidarity spoke of the tragedy of the Holocaust.
   ``We bend our heads in homage to the courage and dignity (of the
fighters), and at the same time to all those who were dying of
starvation, from bullets, in flames. To all victims,'' said
Solidarity spokesman Janusz Onyszkiewicz, reading a letter to the
crowd from union chairman Lech Walesa.
   Authorities had told the citizens' committee organizing the
ceremony that it would be illegal.
   But police did not interfere either during the speeches and
wreath-laying at the monument or as the banner-carrying throng made
its way to the old deportation site at Umschlagplatz, about a
half-mile away.
   Earlier, thousands of people, including U.S. labor leader Albert
Shanker, packed the city's Jewish cemetery to honor two Jewish
socialists executed by the Soviet Union in 1943.
   Across town in the Parliament building, the Yad Vashem Institute
of Jerusalem honored more than 100 Poles for their efforts to
rescue Jews during World War II.
   The ceremonies were part of unofficial observances sponsored by
Polish intellectuals and opposition activists to mark the 45th
anniversary of the uprising. More than 4,500 people from around the
world have come to Poland for the weeklong observances.
   Edelman dedicated a monument to executed socialist Jewish Bund
leaders Henryk Erlich and Viktor Alter, who were ordered put to
death by Stalin in 1943.
   ``It's better now than never and so I'm happy, but I am also
bitter that it's taking place only now,'' said Erlich's
daughter-in-law, Iza Erlich of New Haven, Conn., who traveled to
the ceremony with her sons Mark and Henry.
   The ceremony brought together a cross-section of the Polish
opposition movement and linked it historically to the political
activism of earlier generations.
   Represented were Solidarity, the outlawed Polish Socialist
Party, the Independent Student Association and the conservative
opposition group Confederation of Independent Poland.
   Edelman, 64, had been a leader of the Bund party's youth
movement. He led a unit of Bund fighters in the uprising, in which
several hundred Jewish insurgents staged a three-week struggle
against the final Nazi onslaught against the ghetto in April 1943.
   News of the execution of Erlich and Alter in the Soviet Union
reached the outside world a few months before the uprising.
   They had been deported to the Soviet Union after the Red Army
occupied eastern Poland in September 1939, a few weeks after the
Nazis had invaded from the West. At the time, the Soviets and Nazis
had entered into their non-aggression pact that led to the division
of Poland between them.
   Edelman said the two men, members of the Warsaw municipal
council, were executed for signing an official protest against the
Soviet occupation.
   Shanker, president of the American Federation of Teachers, said
he was representing Lane Kirkland, president of the AFL-CIO.
   He drew repeated applause when he likened the Bundist leaders'
struggle to that of Solidarity, which was declared illegal after
the government's martial law crackdown in 1981.
   At Parliament, Israeli Deputy Prime Minister Itzhak Navon and
officials of the Polish veterans' association were present as 96
medals and certificates were presented to more than 100 Poles for
rescuing Jews during World War II.
   The silver medal for ``Righteous Among Nations in the World''
bears an inscription from the Talmud in Hebrew and French: ``He who
saves one life also saves the world.''
   Felix Zandman, 60, of Philadelphia had an emotional reunion with
the children of three Polish sisters whose family hid him in a hole
with four other Jews for 18 months in 1943-44.
   Gen. Jozef Kaminski, a leader of the Polish veterans'
association Zbowid, told the assembly that more than 3 million
Polish Jews were killed, and he praised those Poles who came to the
aid of their Jewish countrymen.

<HEAD>Study Urges States To Help Fight Money Laundering</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Instead of relying on the federal government,
state and local authorities should vigorously pursue money
laundering cases against drug traffickers who frequently dump their
illegal profits back into local communities, according to a new
study issued Sunday.
   Only California and Georgia have laws specifically barring
conversion of profits from drugs and other crimes, said the report,
but most states do have effective though rarely utilized laws which
can be used to prosecute money laundering operations.
   They include statutes against criminal conspiracy, fraud and
failure to pay state income taxes, said the report conducted for
the National Institute of Justice by the Police Executive Research
Forum, a group of police officials.
   The report notes that money generated by narcotics trafficking
and other underworld activities has been estimated as high as $100
billion annually.
   State and local law enforcement agencies rely on the federal
government to investigate complex money laundering cases because
such operations often are international in scope.
   But offenders at the lower levels of criminal groups are capable
of generating enormous sums that require laundering, ``and for the
same reasons that international traffickers and syndicate
racketeers need such services,'' concluded the report by the police
forum's associate director, Clifford Karchmer.
   Money launderers convert cash from illegal activities to a form
that conceals its origin and true ownership.
   Karchmer said that illegal money which is ``generated locally
tends to remain locally, often in a variety of financial
institutions and legitimate business ventures, and as investment
capital ready for more illegal activities.''
   Because state and local agencies ``are often closer to street
and wholesale-level drug dealing, they may be able to amass more
information on the flow of illegal money than we had earlier
thought,'' said James Stewart, director of NIJ, a Justice
Department agency.

   Seven Sikh separatists accused of some
of the worst attacks in Punjab state this year were trapped in a
farmhouse and killed during a six-hour shootout with government
troops, officials said Sunday.
   Three members of the paramilitary Central Reserve Police Force,
including a head constable, were killed in the gunbattle Saturday
night near Ratha Gudha, about 90 miles south of Amritsar.
   The seven-man Sikh band, led by 18-year-old Hari Singh, was
responsible for killing 55 people in the past three months, said
S.S. Virk, a deputy inspector general of the paramilitary police
force.
   He said their victims included 25 people, including a
6-month-old baby and an 80-year-old woman, killed March 31 in three
villages north of Amritsar.
   Virk said a patrol going from house to house suspected Sikh
gunmen were holed up in the farmhouse and ordered them to
surrender. But the Sikhs opened fire with automatic rifles and
hurled hand grenades, Virk said.
   He said the seven-man patrol returned the fire and was
reinforced by about 150 men who rushed to the scene and encircled
the farmhouse.
   United News of India quoted Amritsar police superintendent Izhar
Alam as saying the government troops poured at least 1,200 rounds
of ammunition into the farmhouse and it caught fire.
   Virk said a large cache of weapons and ammunition, including
Chinese-made semi-automatic rifles, was recovered from the
farmhouse.
   Virk and Alam said the band's leader, also known as Hari Singh
Gulha, escaped from jail two years ago after being arrested in the
deaths of two Hindus. Virk said Singh later joined the Kalistan
Commando Force, one of the largest of a dozen underground Sikh
separatist groups.
   Eight people, including four Sikh militants, died in other
violence Saturday and Sunday in Punjab, where Indian authorities
have blamed Sikh separatists for 741 killings in Punjab so far this
year.
   Sikhs, whose 500-year-old faith has roots in both Hinduism and
Islam, claim they are discriminated against by Hindus, who make up
82 percent of India's 800 million people. Sikhs are only 2 percent
of the national population, but they are the majority in Punjab
state.
   The most militant Sikh groups, such as the Kalistan Commando
Force, want to establish an independent Sikh nation that would be
called Kalistan. More moderate groups say they would settle for
greater autonomy in Punjab.
   United News of India reported that police killed four Sikh
militants Saturday night and early Sunday in the Bhatinda district
90 miles south of Amritsar.
   Sikh militants killed a Sikh liquor vendor and two other people
in three separate attacks in Punjab Saturday night, the news agency
said. Some Sikh separatists want to ban liquor and periodically
kill people who sell it.
   In Ludhiana, 70 miles southeast of Amritsar, a police constable
died Sunday of wounds suffered Thursday during a robbery, UNI said.
Another constable was killed when Sikh gunmen stole about $23,000
from a van, UNI said.

   Prince Charles has returned to
Switzerland to visit a friend who suffered two broken legs in an
avalanche that nearly engulfed the heir to Britain's throne.
   Charles visited Patti Palmer-Tomkinson on Saturday evening at
Davos hospital, where she has been recovering since the March 10
tragedy involving the royal ski party.
   The prince, accompanied by Palmer-Tomkinson's husband Charles,
brought flowers, the mass-circulation Swiss newspaper Sonntagsblick
said Sunday. They flew into Zurich earlier Saturday on a plane
piloted by Charles, the paper said.
   At the hospital they reportedly also met Bruno Sprecher, a local
mountain guide who was skiing with the prince when the snowslide
hit.
   Maj. Hugh Lindsay, a former aide to Queen Elizabeth and friend
of the prince, was killed in the avalanche above the village of
Klosters. Charles was leading a group of six down an extremely
steep unmarked slope when the avalanche hit.

   Sweden's King Carl XVI Gustaf and Queen Silvia
were on hand in the center box at Carnegie Hall for a gala concert
in honor of Swedish dramatic soprano Birgit Nilsson.
   The king and queen are in America celebrating the 350th
anniversary of the beginning of Swedish emigration to America.
   Sopranos Aprile Millo and Eva Marton and Swedish baritone Hakan
Hagegard sang at Saturday night's concert.
   Nilsson, famous for her magnificent Wagnerian roles, thanked the
audience and noted soprano Kiri Te Kanawa and two Swedish tenors,
Nicolai Gedda and Gosta Winbergh, were sick. ``I have a feeling the
famous stamina of the Vikings is getting weaker these days,'' she
said.
   Also singing were Elisabeth Soderstrom, Shirley Verrett, Vinson
Cole and Tommy Korberg.
   Proceeds of ticket sales for ``A Tribute to Birgit Nilsson and
the Swedish Vocal Tradition in America'' went to establish the
Birgit Nilsson Prize.
   The first Nilsson prize was awarded to Ben Heppner, 32, a tenor
from Dawson Creek, Canada, who sang ``The Prize Song'' from ``Die
Meistersinger.'' Part of his prize will be an engagement with the
Royal Opera of Sweden.

   Mayor Edward I. Koch has given $5,000 to New
York University in exchange for help in preserving an archive of
one of his favorite subjects _ himself.
   The mayor, announcing details of his tax returns Friday, said he
gave the money, his largest single charitable contribution last
year, because he had asked the NYU journalism department to conduct
a study on how to preserve a video archive of his press conferences
and other events.
   Next to NYU's, the largest single donation made by Koch during
1987 was the $1,300 he gave to the United Jewish Appeal. In all, he
gave a little more than $10,000 to charity.
   The records also showed that he paid $47,568 in city, state and
federal taxes last year, roughly one-third of his $144,620 in
earnings.

   Supporters of Jesse Jackson in Illinois
are warning Sen. Paul Simon that he could face a black voter
backlash two years from now, because his decision to suspend his
White House bid is seen as hurting Jackson.
   By suspending his Democratic campaign rather than quitting
outright, Simon still stands to pick up 47 Illinois delegates who
are to be chosen next month by state party leaders.
   Those delegates would otherwise have gone to Jackson. Now
Jackson supporters are making it clear they don't think Simon is
playing fair, and hinting he could face the consequences if he
seeks Senate re-election in 1990.
   ``Out is out. We want him out,'' said state Sen. Howard Brookins
of Chicago, Jackson's Illinois campaign chairman, in urging Simon
to quit the presidential race.
   Brookins joined other black leaders, including Chicag Mayor
Eugene Sawyer, in urging Simon to formally end his campaign.
   Illinois Republicans are already hinting that they see Simon's
liberal presidential platform as grist for the Senate campaign
against him.
   ``He's always been very successful in Illinois in hiding the
fact that he's an old-fashioned 1950s liberal,'' said Republican
Gov. James R. Thompson.
   ``That may have a more important bearing on the campaign for the
senatorship in 1990 than the fact that he missed some roll calls
while he was out running for president,'' Thompson said.
   Some observers say attacks on two fronts _ from black Democrats
and Republicans _ could hurt Simon's prospects for Senate
re-election.
   ``It depends on who runs against him, how he runs and what he
does between now and then,'' said pollster Richard Day. ``It also
depends on the mood of the state _ has it become slightly more
liberal, more conservative?''
   Others predict the delegate controversy will be old news by then.
   ``In this business, two years is a lifetime,'' added Chicago
political strategist William Daley, a son of the late Mayor Richard
J. Daley.
   Illinois Democratic Chairman Vince Demuzio, a Simon supporter,
pointedly compared Simon's delegation to the favorite-son unit
taken to the 1984 Democratic convention by the late Chicago Mayor
Harold Washington.
   Demuzio said of the delegate flap: ``It'll blow over.''
   With Simon on vacation last week, his aides moved to quiet the
grumbling among Illinois' black Democrats.
   The senator's press secretary, David Carle, said Simon's move to
keep a lock on the 47 delegates was intended to ensure a voice in
Atlanta for his supporters, not to derail Jackson's candidacy.
   In a letter to the Chicago Defender, a black-oriented newspaper,
Carle suggested that were Simon to formally drop out of the race,
many of his delegates might sign on with Massachusetts Gov. Michael
Dukakis, thus hurting Jackson.
   Many Democrats say Simon's convincing win over Jackson in
Illinois' March 15 presidential primary proves he's still popular.
   ``He went a long way in stopping the rumors and the perception
that he was in trouble,'' Daley said.
   But Jackson supporters point out the primary win was before
Simon's controversial move to suspend campaigning and keep his
delegates. They say any perception that Simon is linked to a
stop-Jackson movement could leave him without the support of many
of the blacks who helped lift him to victory in 1984.
   ``They are raising this question with us, and we will have to
answer that as we move into elections, his re-election,'' Brookins
said. ``I think that in the primary election there will be other
people running. There are many, many options.''
   Simon's friends say attacks on him might actually strengthen his
hand in a 1990 Senate race.
   ``For many of us, Paul stands for a particular set of
principles,'' said state Sen. Dawn Clark Netsch of Chicago, a Simon
delegate. ``I think people can be very proud, not so much of how
far he got but that he never wavered on the kind of things he
stands for.''

   The Woonasquatucket, Moshassuck and
Providence rivers, long buried beneath railroad yards, a post
office and the world's widest bridge, are being exhumed in a $40
million waterfront renewal that planners hope will give the entire
city a lift.
   The reshaping that began last week will propel Providence into
the 21st century by reviving many features of the 19th, city
officials say.
   ``We're building on our dreams of the past,'' said Mayor Joseph
R. Paolino Jr.
   The mayor hopes to erase Providence's longtime image as a center
of organized crime and corruption.
   Raymond L.S. Patriarca, the reputed longtime boss of the New
England mob, had his headquarters here until his death in 1984, and
his son, Raymond J. ``Junior'' Patriarca of suburban Lincoln, is
considered by lawmen to control his father's old organization.
   Paolino's predecessor, Vincent A. Cianci Jr., was forced from
office in 1984 amid allegations he assaulted his wife's lover and
that city employees were stealing municipal asphalt and curbstones.
   The Cianci administration began planning the redevelopment that
Paolino hopes will eradicate the negative perceptions of his city,
but Paolino said his administration has reshaped the project _ and
city government _ substantially.
   ``People who have had indictments or convictions from the
corruption days of the previous administration have been eliminated
from city government,'' he said. ``I think I've been able to learn
from the mistakes of other administrations and to guide us against
it.''
   The redevelopment has produced little opposition, mostly because
the area to be developed was largely used only for parking lots.
   Some critics have accused the city of concentrating on glitzy
downtown development at the expense of affordable housing in the
neighborhoods, but Paolino said development benefits the entire
metropolis.
   ``To have a run-down, shabby downtown is a reflection on the
rest of the city,'' he said. ``We need each other.''
   If all goes according to plan, the Capital Center area
separating downtown and the Statehouse, long given over to railroad
yards and parking lots, will be bristling with office buildings and
a $350 million shopping center within five years.
   The Woonasquatucket will flow through the center of the
development, pausing at a small cove in a park, before joining the
Moshassuck to form the Providence River in front of a tower that
will house the headquarters of Citizens Bank.
   The rivers now join underneath the downtown post office, which
is staying where it is while the rivers are moved 500 feet to the
southeast.
   In the early 1800s, there was a cove on the Woonasquatucket
right about where the city's plan calls for the new one. The cove
grew smaller and smaller as the city expanded, finally vanishing
underneath the Union Station rail yards.
   At the time they were buried, the rivers were not considered
civic assets, said Providence College history professor Patrick T.
Conley.
   ``They were treated as open sewers, frankly,'' Conley said.
   Chip Young, spokesman for the environmental group Save the Bay,
said the rivers have become somewhat cleaner.
   ``It's good to see them doing this,'' Young said at
groundbreaking ceremonies for the river relocation project. ``Now,
the challenge will be to keep them clean.''
   Union Station, a 90-year-old landmark that was gutted by fire
two years ago, is getting a new copper roof and should reopen as an
office complex in about a year, developer Ron Marsella said.
   Amtrak vacated Union Station two years ago and moved to a
facility closer to the Statehouse, clearing the way for developers
to remove the old rail yards and open the area to development.
   The Westminster Street pedestrian mall, a relic of the 1960s
when planners thought they could save downtown shopping districts
by closing a street to traffic, will be reopened to cars and trucks
this fall, said Thomas V. Moses, director of the city Department of
Planning and Development.
   The downtown pedestrian mall was unable to compete with suburban
shopping centers.
   The neighborhood, just west of downtown skyscrapers, was
predominantly residential until the middle of the 19th century, but
Conley is skeptical about Paolino's dream of reviving it as a place
for people to live.
   City officials concede they will have to do some selling to
attract people to live in the city center, but said they think
there is an audience willing to listen.

   Parishioners of Corpus Christi
Catholic Church received a written apology from one of their
priests Sunday for his public criticism of Pope John Paul II during
last weekend's Masses.
   ``I apologize for the injudicious use of the phrase `dead wrong'
with regard to the Holy Father's stand concerning celibacy for the
diocesan clergy,'' the Rev. Anthony Curran said in a letter printed
in Sunday's church bulletins.
   ``I acknowledge that I was in violation of canon law in speaking
publicly on the matter.''
   Curran's criticism of the pope's position on celibacy came a
week after a former Corpus Christi priest, the Rev. Anton Mowat,
was indicted on charges of molesting four altar boys at the church
in suburban Atlanta.
   Curran was summoned to Atlanta on Tuesday to meet with Monsignor
John McDonough, administrator of the Atlanta archdiocese. After the
meeting, church officials announced that Curran would write a brief
letter of clarification to parishioners but would not be
disciplined.
   Curran said he still thinks church officials need to deal with
the pressures on priests caused by the celibacy requirement and
other factors.
   ``The letter is an apology for saying the pope is `dead
wrong,''' he said. ``I am not recanting my statements about the
pain I have seen in the priesthood.''

<HEAD>Researcher: Dolphins Prefer Bach To Rock</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dolphins prefer Bach to rock, says
a researcher who found that music made the friendly mammals even
friendlier.
   ``They seem to have a preference for Bach, and (Jean Pierre)
Rampal on flute. They'll jump out of the water for that,''
professional diver and photographer Dan Wagner said.
   ``They also thought `Physical' (by Olivia Newton-John) was
pretty neat. But, when we put on some old Chicago and some other
rock 'n' roll, they boogied on out ... They just split,'' Wagner
said. ``I guess they didn't think it was too cool.''
   Wagner made his discovery recently when he played a concerto by
Johann Sebastian Bach with his boat's hydrophone lowered 30 feet
into the Atlantic Ocean about 100 miles north of Grand Bahama
Island. Soon, nine wild dolphins were circling.
   Intrigued, he then played a tape made from dolphins that live at
Ocean World in Fort Lauderdale. When the tamed dolphins whistled
and trilled, their wild cousins swam to Wagner and let him tickle
and scratch their bellies.
   ``It was like they understood what the other dolphins were
saying,'' he recalls. ``It gave you goose bumps.''
   An Ocean World crew is now researching if the dolphins were
responding ``language'' on the tapes Wagner played for them.
   The team has made tapes of tame dolphins as they performed such
tricks as swimming through hoops. They plan to play the tapes and
then toss objects needed to perform the tricks into the water.
   If the wild dolphins perform, it could be a sign that they
understood the tapes and that dolphins have a language _ a
controversial notion.
   And University of San Francisco dolphin researcher Diana Reiss
says that even if the wild dolphins should perform on cue, it could
be because of coincidence and not language.
   ``You've got no way of knowing,'' she said.

   A museum and library filled with old photographs
and the now-rusted guns of the men who stormed Cuba's Bay of Pigs
was dedicated Sunday on the 27th anniversary of the failed invasion.
   ``Future generations must know what happened at the Bay of Pigs.
They must know we fought and many died,'' said Juan Perez Franco,
president of those who served in Brigade 2506.
   Many of the 400 who walked through the hall and central room
were Brigade veterans who pointed to photographs of people they had
known before their friends died in battle.
   ``We knew we could have lost out lives, but we didn't believe we
would lose the battle,'' said Dr. Carlos Garrido, who was captured
and held 22 months after the April 17, 1961 landing.
   The museum, nestled in the heart of the Little Havana section in
central Miami, contains bitter memories for many of the people who
live nearby. It recalls the day when President John F. Kennedy
canceled U.S. support of the CIA-backed mission and left the exiled
Cuban volunteers stranded on the beach of the Cuban bay.
   ``It was a betrayal _ a fiasco,'' said Eduardo Lambert, 47, a
paratrooper in the invasion who now is director of the museum.
``But those men should not be forgotten. They were fighting for
American principles of democracy and freedom.''
   The idea for the museum was hatched two years ago by the Bay of
Pigs Veterans Association as a way of gaining recognition for the
114 men who died in the invasion and the 1,189 held in Cuban
prisons for 22 months until the United States bought their freedom
with $53 million in food and medicine.
   ``To this day, the United States government has not recognized
the Bay of Pigs veterans as true American veterans,'' Lambert said.
``Maybe people will come in here and see the sacrifices we made
fighting for the interests of the United States.''
   About 300 of the volunteers joined the U.S. military forces
after their release.
   A single-story house is home to the museum and library, which is
funded by the veterans and $150,000 in grants from the state and
Dade County.
   Walls are lined with photographs tracing how most of the 1,400
Cuban exiles were quietly recruited from the streets of Miami and
New York City to secret training bases in Guatemala. Other photos
depict how the prisoners of the battle were paraded and mocked at
show trials in Cuba.
   A photocopy of a purported top-secret CIA document is also on
display, detailing plans made during the Eisenhower administration
to attack the marshy beach. Lambert says the document was donated
to the museum anonymously, although the U.S. government steadfastly
denies the document ever existed.
   One section of the museum displays guns and ammunition used to
battle Castro's troops for 65 hours, until supplies gave out.
   Hanging high on a wall of the museum is the green flag of
Brigade 2506, the standard for the ransomed Bay of Pigs veterans.
President Kennedy raised the flag in a 1963 Orange Bowl ceremony
welcoming the prisoners home, promising ``this flag will be
returned to this brigade in a free Havana.''
   Lambert acknowledges the museum is full of broken promises and
bad memories, but he stresses it was not meant to denigrate the
United States.
   ``Just because we question the thought that went into planning
the Bay of Pigs invasion doesn't mean we don't love the United
States,'' Lambert said. ``That's freedom. That's exactly what we
were fighting for.''

<TEXT>
   A year after she lost an arm in a shark
attack, April Dawn Volgino has been named editor of the Llano High
School yearbook, plays xylophone in the band and has kept drawing,
hoping one day to become an artist.
   April, 17, and her parents say their lives, turned upside down
by the incident off Mustang Island last April 18, are calmer now.
   ``My friends get upset over itty-bitty problems they have,''
April said. ``Nothing upsets me anymore.''
   April was attacked by a shark in chest-deep water, 100 feet from
the shore.
   Her father, Robert, attempted to beat the shark away with his
fists, and wrestled with it for about 20 seconds when it pursued as
they fled.
   April lost her right arm about six inches below the shoulder,
but that hasn't slowed her down much.
   ``Drawing was no problem,'' April said. ``I'm even better than I
was before.''
   ``Before, I wanted to pursue an art career, but didn't do a lot
about it. Then I almost died. I put a lot more into it now.''
   The Voglinos told the Corpus Christi Caller-Times that several
hospitals tried to recruit April as a patient because of the
attention she received in the press.
   April hates being labeled a ``shark victim.''
   ``People ask me if I'm the one,'' she said. ``I think I'm going
to have a T-shirt made with `The One' written across it.''
   She also doesn't like to talk about the incident.
   ``Many people don't believe in that type of coping,'' she said,
``but they're not me and I have to live with it. If I change my
mind in the future, then I'll deal with it another way.''
   April and her family often use humor to deal with the pain.
   ``The media account of what Dad did made him look like King Kong
or something,'' April said. ``They made it seem very heroic.''
   On the beach, Robert collapsed from exhaustion and her mother,
Beth, administered first aid.
   ``When we got to the shore, I told Dad, `I can't breathe,'''
April said.
   Her father's answer after the panicked dash: ``Neither can I.''
   April's physical progress has been slowed by painful bone spurs,
which she says have hindered her ability to use her prosthesis. She
will undergo surgery to remove the spurs this summer.

<HEAD>GOP Senator Says Plant-Closing Provision Kills Trade Bill</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The ranking Republican on the Senate Commerce
Committee said Sunday the inclusion of a labor-backed,
plant-closing provision in a new trade bill kills the measure.
   President Reagan has threatened to veto the trade bill if the
plant shutdown notification remains intact, and White House
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Friday that Reagan would not accept
any version of the bill that contains provisions that are
``injurious to a dynamic economy.''
   Sen. John C. Danforth, R-Mo., in an appearance on CBS-TV's
``Face the Nation,'' said the decision by Democratic leaders last
Thursday to include the provision marks the end of the trade bill.
   ``I think that the result of last Thursday was to kill the bill,
unless there is some other way of dusting it off at some later
point,'' said Danforth, a member of the Senate Commerce, Science
and Transportation Committee. ``But this present bill, with plant
closing, I think is dead.''
   The plant-closing clause would require businesses with at least
100 employees to give 60 days notice of factory shutdowns and
layoffs. Business groups oppose it, contending the requirement
infringes on the prerogatives of company managers.
   Legislators are attempting to iron out differences between House
and Senate versions of the 1,000-page trade legislation.
   Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., chairman of the House Ways and
Means Committee, said he hopes that Reagan will reconsider his
position on the measure and sign the bill.
   ``I'm sorry to see us come to a failure if we can't get this
bill passed,'' Rostenkowski said on the CBS program. ``I'm
optimistic, though, I think the bill will pass and the president
will sign it.''
   The congressman also said he remains hopeful that Congress can
override a Reagan veto of the trade bill.

<TEXT>
   Israeli soldiers Sunday
turned back a U.N. convoy carrying food and other supplies to this
West Bank camp, where refugees under a 32-day-old curfew complained
of severe shortages.
   An Israeli soldier guarding the Jelazoun camp told U.N.
officials their convoy posed a security threat.
   ``We have orders,'' he told them after making them wait an hour
and a half. ``You could cause a disturbance. Maybe come another
day.''
   Jelazoun, home to about 5,000 refugees on a hillside 15 miles
north of Jerusalem, has been under the longest continuous curfew on
a camp since the Palestinian uprising began in early December, U.N.
officials say. The Israeli army says it is one of the most violent
spots in the West Bank.
   The army uses curfews here and elsewhere in the occupied
territories, held since the 1967 Middle East War, in an attempt to
blunt the protests against its military rule. During a curfew,
residents are confined to their homes and can circulate only with
special permission from the army.
   Inside the camp Sunday, heaps of refuse were decaying beside
many homes. Open sewers along the streets added to the stench.
Residents remained mostly inside their shuttered homes, but
occasionally one ventured outside to talk to visitors.
   The U.N. officials had arrived there with three trucks filled
with packages for each of the 900 families in the camp. The
supplies included lentils, rice, cooking oil, sardines, corned
beef, powdered milk and 4,000 loaves of bread.
   ``The situation is deteriorating every day,'' Mogens Fokdal, a
U.N. relief official responsible for the camp, said Sunday.
``People have gone without electricity for a month. They have no
oil or fuel to cook. They are starting to burn old shoes and
furniture to make fires.''
   David James, an official with the U.N. Relief and Works Agency,
said he had received assurances from a senior army liaison officer
that he would be able to make the delivery.
   ``We just want to give people the food they need,'' James said.
He said previous shipments of bread had been allowed into the camp.
   A spokesman for the West Bank's military administration said
there was no policy of blocking U.N. food deliveries to refugee
camps.
   However, they must be cleared with the army in advance, said the
spokesman, Olivier Rafovitch. ``In today's case, that was not
done,'' he said.
   ``Life has become terrible this past month,'' said a 30-year-old
refugee, who gave his name only as Hassan. ``We have no vegetables,
no eggs, no meat. All we eat is bread and food from supplies we had
before March 16.''
   Fokdal said U.N. garbage trucks had been denied permission to
enter the camp and clear away garbage since the curfew was imposed
March 16.
   ``We suggested to the people that they burn the garbage
themselves, to avoid disease,'' Fokdal said. ``But they fear the
soldiers will see the fires as a demonstration.''
   An army spokeswoman, who declined to give her name under
military rules, said Jelazoun was placed under curfew because it
was ``an especially problematic and violent camp.''
   An army officer, who also would not give his name, said
residents were being punished for tossing stones and firebombs at
Israeli cars on the road outside the camp.
   ``Not a single Israeli car could pass here without being
attacked before the curfew,'' the soldier said. ``Is that fair? Of
course life here isn't a picnic. But these people have to pay for
their actions.''
   Soldiers posted at the camp entrance, moreoever, denied
residents were suffering shortages. They said the curfew was lifted
for two hours each afternoon, enabling refugees to buy as much food
as they wanted.

   Slain PLO military commander Khalil
Al-Wazir will be buried in Jordan because he wanted to be close to
his homeland of Palestine, his wife said Sunday.
   Al-Wazir, also known as Abu Jihad, was assassinated by a
commando squad Saturday in his home outside Tunis.
   PLO spokesman Ahmad Abderrahman called the killing a ``serious
blow'' to the Palestine Liberation Organization, but said no one
leader embodies ``all the revolution and all the people.''
   The body will be taken to Jordan on Monday after a religious
ceremony in Tunis.
   Intisar Al-Wazir said she preferred that her husband be buried
in Tunisia, but that his last wishes were to be buried ``in a place
close to Palestine.''
   Al-Wazir was born in Ramla in what is now Israel in 1935. He was
the highest ranking Palestinian leader to be killed since Fatah,
the mainstream PLO group, was formed in 1964.
   The PLO immediately blamed Israeli agents for the killing, which
set off the most violent wave of unrest in the Israeli-occupied
territories since the uprising began there in December.
   Abderrahman told reporters that the commando team of six men and
one woman was divided into two units with one entering by the front
door of the house and the other through the back.
   They killed two bodyguards, one on the ground floor and one in
the basement, then climbed the stairs. Al-Wazir, alerted by the
noise, waited with gun in hand, Abderrahman said.
   The revolver was pulverized by machine-gun fire, the fingers on
his hand were torn apart and his body riddled with about 60
bullets, the spokesman said.
   Tunisian authorities said a gardener, initially described as a
bodyguard, also was killed.
   There have been no arrests, but Tunisian police have recovered
three rented vehicles, a car and two minibuses, said to have been
used by the attackers, according to a preliminary report of the
investigation.
   Jordanian authorities have agreed to allow Al-Wazir to be buried
on Jordanian territory, Abderrahman's statement said.
   King Hussein of Jordan sent a telegram Sunday to PLO leader
Yasser Arafat expressing his ``deepest grief'' over the slaying,
according to the official Jordan News Agency, which made no mention
of burial plans.
   In an interview with the British Broadcasting Corp. radio show,
``World This Weekend,'' Abderrahman said a successor to Al-Wazir
would be chosen after the funeral.
   He rejected allegations that Al-Wazir was likely killed by other
Arabs.
   ``It is one of the Israeli lies and the Israelis themselves know
that,'' Abderrahman told his interviewer. ``We have only one enemy
that can make this kind of operation. That's the Israeli
government.''
   Asked whether there would be a reprisal for the killing,
Abderrahman replied: ``I cannot say that. I will say that we will
continue our resistance in the occupied territories until we
achieve self-determination, until we achieve our independent state
in Palestine.''

<HEAD>Judge Orders Settlement Attempt in Damage Suit for AIDS-Exposed
Brothers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SARASOTA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge has ordered a family with
three AIDS-exposed sons to try to reach an out-of-court settlement
with the school board that barred the children from classes, the
school board chairman said.
   Attorneys for Clifford and Louise Ray and the DeSoto County
School Board met Friday, but School Board Chairman James Westberry
refused to reveal any results of the meeting.
   The suit, which was filed in June 1987 after the brothers were
forbidden to attend school in Arcadia, seeks unspecified
``substantial monetary damages.''
   The Ray boys, Ricky, 11, Robert, 10, and Randy, 8, were allowed
to attend Arcadia elementary school only after U.S. District Judge
Elizabeth Kovachevich ordered the school board on Aug. 5, 1987, to
accept them in regular classes.
   The family was forced to flee their town a week after school
began when their house was burned by an arsonist and they received
threatening telephone calls and bomb threats.
   The brothers, all hemophiliacs, are believed to have been
exposed to acquired immune deficiency syndrome through contaminated
blood products they take to control their hemophilia.
   Since their exile, the family has resettled here and the
brothers attend Gocio Elementary School.
   Westberry said Ms. Kovachevich ordered attorneys from both sides
to meet in Tampa, but the meeting before U.S. Magistrate Elizabeth
Jenkins was closed to the public.
   Ms. Jenkins apparently ordered the attorneys not to discuss what
happened at the conference.
   ``Obviously we were in Tampa on Friday and we cannot comment at
all on what transpired there,'' said Fort Myers attorney Patrick
Geraghty, who represents National Union Fire Insurance, the school
board's insurance carrier.
   The board's insurance policy has a limit of $1 million.
Westberry said he didn't think that a settlement of $1 million or
less would have to be authorized by the school board.
   ``Personally, I feel like this system had the best interest of
those children in mind all the time,'' he said. ``I don't feel like
we really owe them anything.''
   Said Ray family attorney Bill Earl, ``We certainly would like to
settle the case on a just and reasonable basis. It doesn't benefit
anyone to proceed.''
   Since their house was burned, the Ray family has received more
than $100,000 in public donations, and in January ABC-TV announced
it would pay the Rays $100,000 for the rights to film their story.

<HEAD>Mao Statues Torn Down At Beijing University</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHARLENE L. FU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A huge statue of Mao Tse-tung came toppling down
under cover of darkness Sunday at the nation's most prestigious
university in a move to further lessen the influence of China's
late leader.
   The four-story-tall monument in front of Beijing University's
main library was one of the largest in the nation. All that remains
of it and a second smaller one just inside the campus' west gate
are the pedestals and some rubble, an American student said.
   Larger-than-life statues of Mao, bare-headed, wearing a long
wind-blown overcoat and with hand raised in greeting, once were
fixtures in nearly all institutions and official compounds.
   However, no new statues have been erected in recent years and
others have come down as the official Chinese attitude toward Mao,
one of the founders of the Chinese Communist Party, has changed
from unquestioning allegiance to the position that he was a great
man but made major mistakes.
   Late Saturday and early Sunday, workers were seen laboring on
the larger statue under bright lights. It had been covered by
scaffolding and plastic sheeting for more than a week, but students
said it was being cleaned and repaired.
   At about 5 a.m., the mammoth concrete statue was sawed off at
the feet and came toppling down, leaving a large dent on the
pavement, the student said.
   Mao has come under criticism from the current leadership of Deng
Xiaoping for the Great Leap Forward of 1958, the lightning-fast
communization of agriculture that contributed to three years of
famine.
   Deng has also blamed Mao for the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution,
during which leftist radicals purged hundreds of thousands of
people accused of disloyalty to the man Chinese used to call ``The
Great Helmsman.''
   It was during that decade, which ended with Mao's death, that
the Maoist cult of personality reached a fevered peak. Chinese
carried around ``The Little Red Book,'' containing hundreds of
Mao's quotations, and posters of the leader were everywhere.
   Reaction to the destruction of the Beijing University statues
was mixed.
   A strongly worded poster criticizing their removal reportedly
was put up briefly Sunday morning on a campus bulletin board, and
several Chinese students expressed regret over the demolition of
the figures.
   ``Taking it down was unecessary. He was an important historical
figure, for good or for bad. We can judge for ourselves,'' one
student said.
   However, several professors disagreed.
   ``It's a symbol of an era, and that era is over. Taking it down
is only natural,'' said a middle-aged professor who helped erect
the larger statue in 1967.
   There was no library then, and the statue was an imposing figure
on an open square in the center of the campus, he said.
   ``Good,'' exclaimed another professor when he saw the wreckage
of the bigger statue.
   He termed the monument ``a spiritual weight on the minds of the
people.'' The professor, in his 30s, said it was the wish of the
entire country that Mao statues be destroyed. He said the reason it
was done secretly at night was that a crowd of people cheering its
destruction would have gathered if the statue had been taken down
during the day.
   The professors explained that to people who are old enough to
remember the Cultural Revolution the Mao statues are painful
reminders of that chaotic period.
   Neither the students nor the professors knew why the statues
were destroyed, but some speculated that it may be part of a
general beautification of the campus in preparation for Beijing
University's 90th anniversary.
   The middle-aged professor said workers told him the pedestal in
front of the library would be turned into a flower stand.

<HEAD>Iraqis Claim To Have Retaken Part Of Southern Faw Peninsula</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SALAH NASRAWI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iraq said Sunday its troops backed by units
of the elite Presidential Guard retook part of the southern Faw
peninsula, captured by Iran in early 1986.
   Also, four injured crewmen from the missile frigate USS Samuel
B. Roberts, which hit a mine in the Persian Gulf last week, were
flown from Bahrain to an American military hospital in West Germany.
   A correspondent for the Iraqi News Agency reported seeing the
bodies of thousands of Iranian troops on the battlefield and said
that large numbers also were captured.
   Iran's Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in Cyprus, denied
the Iraqi claim, saying the attackers were driven back by Iranian
Revolutionary Guards with hundreds of Iraqi casualties.
   Tehran radio reported ``heavy fighting'' in the Faw area Sunday
evening and claimed Iraqi forces used internationally banned
chemical weapons against the Iranian forces there.
   Iraq said it fired six missiles into Tehran and another into the
southern city of Shiraz, bringing the number fired into Tehran to
132 since Feb. 29.
   Tehran radio said the latest missile attacks killed nine
civilians and damaged homes and shops.
   The attack Sunday marked the first time Iraq had taken the
initiative in the ground war since mid-1986, when it overran the
virtually abandoned Iranian town of Mehran just inside the Iranian
border.
   The Iraqi agency issued a military communique saying troops had
``advanced in the Faw sector to liberate our soil and trample upon
anyone who dares to attack great Iraq.''
   ``Pitched battles'' were under way in the marshy peninsula that
juts out into the gulf and straddles Iraq's only sea entrance, the
agency said.
   Iraqi forces had taken the ``saline area,'' IRNA said in an
apparent reference to a 25-square-mile area about 15 miles from the
town of Faw.
   It said coastal areas running parallel to the saline area also
were ``completely liberated.''
   A Western military analyst in Baghdad said the Iraqis had
retaken a salt quarry and this paved the way for Faw's recapture.
   Another Western military analyst, who like the first spoke on
condition of anonymity, said the Iranians once had about 50,000 men
in the peninsula, but it was not known how many there were now.
   The Iraqis have fought a largely defensive war since being
driven out of Iranian territory in 1982. They say they are willing
to negotiate for peace and have blamed Iran's intransigeance for
the war's continuation.
   The use of the Presidential Guards in the attack suggested a
major offensive, since they are rarely deployed in routine combat.
   In addition, the Iraqi agency later also reported that air force
jet fighters provided support.
   The communique said the offensive was in retaliation for recent
Iranian incursions into northern Iraq. Iraq reportedly used
chemical weapons in those attacks.
   The Faw peninsula, about 50 miles southeast of Iraq's major port
city of Basra, was lost to the Iranian attackers in a major
offensive in February 1986.
   Iranian troops carried out a nighttime amphibious landing,
erecting a pontoon bridge. They eventually retained about 120
square miles of the peninsula, using their new positions to shell
Iraq's main air base near Basra.
   Iran also reportedly used Faw to launch anti-ship, Chinese-made
Silkworm missiles at Kuwaiti ships and oil facilities.
   The Iraqi agency said the ``missile shower'' was fired into
Tehran early Sunday, and the rocket attack on Shiraz some time
later. Iran did not immediately acknowledge the attacks.
   The four U.S. Navy men were flown out from Bahrain in
mid-afternoon after the Navy honored them as ``brave men.'' They
were the most seriously injured of the 10 hurt in the mine blast
Thursday. The mine was believed laid by Iran.
   The captain of the frigate, in his first phone call to the
United States since the ship struck the mine, said he was told to
abandon ship twice.
   But Cmdr. Paul X. Rinn said his crew of ``heroes'' saved a ship
that was hit so hard her stern rose 15 feet in the air and flames
shot 100 feet through her stacks.
   ``It was close, really close,'' Rinn said. ``We took a very bad
hit.''
   Rinn's account of the Thursday incident was related Saturday by
his wife, Pamela.
   Rinn did not say who told him to abandon the ship, which pulled
into the United Arab Emirates port of Dubai on Saturday.

<TEXT>
   While first-year associates at the city's 20
largest law offices can expect to pull down about $71,000 a year,
paychecks for the most senior associates vary by as much as 56
percent, according to a new survey.
   The study published in Monday's edition of the New York Law
Journal found that 17 of the 20 firms pay first-year associates
$70,000, $71,000 or $72,000.
   However, by the seventh year, base salaries vary from
Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft's $108,000 to $169,000 at Sullivan &
Cromwell.
   George D. Reycraft, a partner at Cadwalader, told the newspaper
that associates normally get a bonus at his firm.
   ``You see similar salaries in the early years because the firms
are all competing for the same scarce resource coming out of the
top law schools,'' said William C. Cobb, a Houston-based legal
consultant.
   In its survey, the publication found average compensation for
lawyers at the 20 firms are: $71,700, first year; $80,000, second
year; $85,800, third year; $101,900, fourth year; $114,800, fifth
year; $126,200, sixth year; and $139,000, seventh year.

<HEAD>Harlem Teen-agers Take on Soviets in Chess</HEAD>

   Jose Tavarez brought the street smarts of New York
City to a battle Sunday with a Soviet foe.
   The contest between the 15-year-old Harlem resident and Moscow
teen-ager Andrei Krasavin last just 15 minutes. Krasavin took a
last look at the chessboard and resigned, the victim of an unusual
program to teach New York students English through the ancient game.
   Tavarez and his schoolmates, however, have enjoyed only mixed
success in their chess matches in the chess-worshiping Soviet
Union, homeland of world champion Garri Kasparov.
   ``The first day they played, they were sort of destroyed,'' said
William Hall, their English teacher and chess mentor.
   The 11 students from Junior High School No. 99 in East Harlem, a
crime- and drug-plagued area of Manhattan, came to the Soviet Union
for two weeks to challenge counterparts at their favorite game.
   The trip was masterminded by Hall, who teaches English through
chess to 40 pupils from Puerto Rico, Ecuador, El Salvador,
Nicaragua, Pakistan, Hong Kong and other countries. The students
belong to his ``Royal Knights'' chess club.
   ``I saw that kids who were having difficulty learning were
intrigued by chess,'' said 52-year-old Hall, who has been teaching
for 23 years. ``The motivation was so great that they improved
their English faster.''
   ``Do they have an egghead-nerd image?'' Hall asked. ``The answer
is no, with a capital `N.' They play baseball, soccer, street
hockey, and their drive to excel in chess carries over.''
   The New Yorkers, clad in sneakers and blue jackets with their
club's name, met their Soviet opponents Sunday at Pioneer Palace, a
children's recreation center in Moscow's Lenin Hills. In a
third-floor classroom used to teach the game to budding
grandmasters, the Americans sat down at brown wooden tables inlaid
with chessboards to test themselves against some of the Soviet
capital's best young players.
   Previous showings by the Royal Knights, who arrived in Moscow
April 10 and had played at the Spartak and Central Soviet chess
clubs, ranged from disastrous to encouraging.
   ``The Russians know clever moves that we don't, and that gives
them control of the center of the board,'' said Tony Pagan, 15,
whose parents are from Ecuador.
   Tavarez, a club member of Puerto Rican origin who has played
chess for only seven months, was one of the winners Sunday. ``He
wants to take on the best,'' Hall said. ``On the way over here, his
question was, `Does (Soviet leader Mikhail) Gorbachev play chess?'''
   However, Avram A. Pismenny, trainer for the Pioneers chess club,
said the Americans had studied the game less than his players.
   The tour began to take shape last year, when the Royal Knights
placed 17th in a national scholastic tournament. Two club members
playing at the Manhattan Chess Club met the women's champion, Maya
Chiburdanidze of the Soviet Union, who suggested they visit her
country.
   It took 11 months of planning and fund raising, as well as
$20,000 in corporate sponsorship to make the idea a reality.
   The group was scheduled to leave Moscow on Monday for Eshera, a
resort on the Black Sea. They will spend three days there, travel
to Leningrad to visit that northern Russian city and play more
chess, then return to New York on April 24.

   The TV cameras were on and Hal Rasche was
getting up to work a math problem when his microphone cord snagged
on a chair.
   ``It was no big deal but it took a second to get it unhooked,''
the high school sophomore and co-host of ``Homework Hotline'' said
later.
   The live, phone-in television show is about as far from ``Wheel
of Fortune'' as Paducah is from Hollywood, but it's been a success
at showcasing bright students and tutoring those with schoolwork
troubles.
   Organizers from the public school system, a local vocational
center and the Chamber of Commerce scheduled an ``encore'' show
Monday night on the cable channel where the hour-long ``Homework
Hotline'' appeared five times this year as a pilot program.
   Bob A. Ruoff, principal of the Paducah Area Vocation Education
Center, says the show will probably be renewed for a second season.
   The television equipment is donated and volunteers include
teachers, students and technical personnel to operate the equipment.
   ``What's the cost? Blood, sweat and tears,'' said Ruoff. ``One
of the things we believed in is that _ in the short term at least _
if you need something bad enough you can find it in the budget.''
   The show is broadcast Mondays at 7 p.m. and had 90 callers its
first night. Two students answer the telephones and four others
armed with encyclopedias and other reference works take turns
answering the questions, sometimes using a blackboard.
   More than half the questions are in math. Callers have also
dialed the Hotline asking how to diagram sentences for English
class and for the name of the 16th U.S. president (Abraham Lincoln).
   Questions that stump the panel and its teacher-advisers are
studied during the week and answered on the next show.
   The easiest for Hal, a skateboard rider who wants to be an
engineer or computer scientist, are in math.
   ``We had somebody ask for help with synthetic division,'' he
said. ``It was something like X to the third (power) plus 3X
squared plus 4X plus 2, divided by X minus 5.''
   ``These are awesome kids,'' Ruoff said. ``It's just so neat to
be around them. You can just feel the horsepower between their
ears.''

<TEXT>
   A Moslem Afghan guerrilla group
claimed Sunday that its fighters had captured a Communist army
garrison in eastern Afghanistan, killing 20 enemy soldiers and
capturing 50 others.
   The Hezbi Islami Party, led by Gulbaddin Hekmatyar, said in a
statement that the Darwazgai garrison at Shinki district in the
Zabul province fell Saturday after several days of fighting.
   It quoted ``a wireless report'' from guerrillas in the area.
   It said 10 guerrillas had died and 18 others were wounded.
Several mortars, guns, pistols, anti-aircraft guns, wireless sets
and uniforms also were seized in the operation, the report said.
   The report of the capture comes only days after the signing in
Geneva of a U.N.-mediated Soviet troop withdrawal accord.
   The guerrillas, who were not party to the Geneva agreement, have
said they will not be bound by any accord in which they did not
participate. They have vowed to continue the fight until the
Communist regime in Kabul is toppled.
   According to Western diplomatic sources, the Afghan war has
intensified in recent weeks despite the signing of the accord.
There seems to be no indication the guerrillas will let up their
attacks.
   Since Thursday, Afghan President Najib has been making daily
appeals to the guerrillas to join a coalition government and end
the conflict so millions of refugees can return home from Iran and
Pakistan.
   The rebels have said they will not share power with the
Communists in any future government.

   An earthquake shook the resort town of
Oropos in central Greece Sunday but authorities reported no
injuries or damage.
   A spokesman for the Athens Seismological Institute said the
quake registered 4 on the Richter scale and occurred at 3:09 p.m.
with its epicenter 22 miles north of Athens.
   ``We felt the earth move, but nobody panicked and there are no
reports of damage or injuries,'' said a police official in Oropos,
31 miles north of Athens.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of energy released by an earthquake
as measured by the ground motion recorded on a seismograph. A quake
registering 4 is considered capable of causing moderate damage.

   Rustlers armed with machetes and rifles
raided nomad camps at dawn and killed 192 people and injured 50 in
a remote part of northwestern Kenya, the government said Sunday.
   The rustlers stole about 3,500 cattle, sheep, goats and donkeys,
officials said. Forty of the 50 rustlers were captured and killed
and about 3,000 animals were recovered.
   The sky over the massacre scene was black with vultures. Hyenas
and other wild animals ravaged the bodies of the victims, said the
Sunday Nation, an independent newspaper.
   Laban Kitele, a minister of state in the office of the
president, said police tracked and killed about 40 of the 50
rustlers in a search aided by recent heavy rains in the district.
The rest escaped across the border to Sudan.
   Kitele said in a statement that the attackers were a well-armed
``terror gang'' of Sudanese from the Toposas tribe and Ndongiros
from Ethiopia.
   The attackers hit 30 nomadic camps about 30 miles west of the
border town of Lokichoggio on Wednesday. The semi-arid district,
whose mountains and rugged valleys make it inaccessible by car, is
near the borders of Ethiopia, Sudan and Uganda.
   Police recovered 3,000 of about 3,500 animals stolen by the
rustlers, Kitele said.
   On March 30, rustlers hacked 15 nomads to death in northern
Kenya and stole 2,000 goats.
   ``Rustlers have lost all respect for human life to the extent
that they will massacre human beings in cold blood,'' Kitele said.
``I wish to warn anybody within Kenya or outside still harboring
ideas of rustling to desist. ... Government response to rustling
will always be prompt and aggressive hot pursuit.''
   In the latest incident, rustlers struck at 6 a.m. and killed
men, women and children with crude machetes and automatic and
semi-automatic rifles, Mohamed Yusuf Haji, the Rift Valley
provincial commissioner, told the Sunday Nation. The newspaper had
chartered a plane to the area.
   Haji said he found only bones and skulls left by scavenging
animals when he visited the scene.
   Rustling is a tradition among East Africa's nomadic tribes, who
regularly cross borders in search of pasture for their animals.

   John Demjanjuk, who has spent the past 11 years
fighting charges he was the notorious Nazi death camp guard ``Ivan
the Terrible,'' faces a verdict Monday in his 14-month-long court
battle in Israel.
   The three-judge panel's 450-page judgment is based on more than
15,000 pages of emotionally charged testimony from Holocaust
survivors, documents experts and the suspect himself.
   Holocaust mastermind Adolf Eichmann, the only other Nazi war
criminal to be tried in Israel, was convicted and hanged in 1962.
Unlike Eichmann, Demjanjuk has insisted he is an innocent victim of
mistaken identity.
   The retired autoworker from Cleveland, Ohio, is charged with
being a brutally sadistic guard who operated gas chambers that
killed 850,000 Jews at the Treblinka death camp in Nazi-occupied
Poland in 1942 and 1943. ``Ivan'' allegedly tortured prisoners on
their way to their deaths.
   Many observers argue the case against Demjanjuk has not been
proven beyond a shadow of a doubt, despite the tearful insistence
of five death camp survivors who claim to recognize the defendant
as ``Ivan'' more than 40 years after the Holocaust.
   But few Israelis doubt the judges will hand in a guilty verdict.
For them, the only question is whether the Ukrainian-born
Demjanjuk, 68, will be spared the death penalty.
   ``After the emotional accounts of the survivors, people expect a
guilty verdict,'' said Gabriel Bron, a reporter for the Yediot
Ahronot newspaper who covered the trial.
   ``Many want vengeance and a death sentence, but there is a
minority voice calling for life imprisonment.''
   If Demjanjuk is found guilty Monday, he will be sentenced at a
later, separate hearing.
   About 250,000 spectators attended the trial's 106 sessions,
which the government held in a converted movie theater at a cost of
$650,000.
   Despite holes in the prosecution case, Demjanjuk was plagued
throughout the trial by a stumbling defense team which seemed to
move two steps backward for every step forward.
   Demjanjuk's relatives raised more than $650,000 for the defense,
but their lawyers often appeared unprepared, failed to come up with
a coherent account of his whereabouts during World War II and
antagonized judges by engaging in behavior bordering on the absurd.
   Two defense witnesses walked off the stand in the middle of
cross-examination, one claiming the defense had threatened a law
suit if he continued to testify.
   Other defense experts were discredited, including one who
retracted her testimony and another who tried to commit suicide
after her credentials were questioned.
   Even Demjanjuk grew frustrated, firing Mark O'Connor of Buffalo,
N.Y., his attorney of seven years, midway through the proceedings.
   But Demjanjuk's supporters contend the defendant's biggest
problem was being tried before Jewish judges of the same generation
as the Nazi victims testifying against him.
   One judge, Polish-born Zvi Tal, lost family in the Holocaust.
   Much of the trial focused on a lengthy, often repetitive debate
over the authenticity of a key piece of prosecution evidence,
Demjanjuk's alleged Nazi identity card.
   About 500 exhibits, including a paper clip, were submitted to
bolster the testimony of six prosecution experts who said the card
was authentic. Six defense witnesses maintained the document was
fake.
   Demjanjuk contends the document was fabricated by the Soviet
Union to punish him for serving in an anti-Communist unit formed by
the Nazis at the end of World War II.
   Although interest waned and frustration mounted in Israel as
Demjanjuk's trial dragged on for months, some Israelis say the fact
that it took place at all has healed some wounds.
   ``The trial has served as a kind of catharsis for many Holocaust
victims,'' said Cleveland-born Toby Greenwald, whose father-in-law,
Menachem, lost his entire family in Nazi death camps.
   He always refused to talk about his experiences but ``there was
something about the trial that just opened up some kind of deep
well,'' she said. ``He began to release all those pent-up
feelings.''
   But the prospect of a verdict has brought mixed emotions to
dozens of Nazi victims who attended the trial over the year.
   ``If the judges don't find him guilty, I think I'll kill
myself,'' said Holocaust survivor Mordechai Fuchs, 63, as he
tearfully fingered a worn photograph of his parents, three brothers
and a sister killed at Treblinka.
   Even if Demjanjuk wins an acquittal Monday, he will not walk
away from the converted movie theater in Jerusalem a free man.
   Stripped of his U.S. citizenship before extradition to Israel in
February 1986, Demjanjuk is stateless.
   Lawyers say that if he is acquitted they expect the United
States to consider reactivating plans to deport Demjanjuk to the
Soviet Union. Such a move had been a possibility before 1983, when
Israel requested his extradition.
   ``This is a man without a nation, he has no papers. When the
trial ends, our problems don't end. They're only beginning,'' said
Demjanjuk's son-in-law Ed Nishnic.

   President Hussain Muhammad Ershad on
Sunday accused opposition parties of trying to halt U.S. aid to his
government in an effort to oust him.
   The opposition has been waging a 5-month-old campaign of strikes
and protest marches in an effort to force Ershad, a retired army
general, to relinquish the office he seized in a bloodless coup in
1982.
   ``Some political leaders, after failing to make any headway in
their movement against the government, went to Washington and
pleaded to the American government not to provide assistance to
Bangladesh,'' Ershad told a group of elementary school teachers.
   ``They even pleaded to the American government to interfere in
the affairs of Bangladesh,'' Ershad said, according to the
government's Sangbad Sangstha news agency.
   It quoted him as asking his audience: ``Now you tell me whether
these elements are to be put on trial for their act of treachery
and downgrading our image as an independent and sovereign nation?''
   He did not mention names.
   Three opposition leaders visited Washington last month: Former
Foreign Minister Kamal Hossain, Bardruddoza Chowdhury of the Awami
League and Nazmul Huda of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party.
   Chowdhury said the group met U.S. congressmen and policymakers
to tell them about ``the absence of democracy, press freedom and
judiciary in Bangladesh.''
   He said the trio made no direct appeals for Washington to
curtail aid to Bangladesh, which has a per capita annual income of
$150 and is one of the poorest countries in the world.

   Amid complaints that the people deserve a
park more than the dogs, canines have won free running time in
Laurel Canyon Park atop the Santa Monica Mountains.
   At the urgings of such luminaries as artist David Hockney and
former Vice President Walter Mondale, the City Council decreed
Friday that animals will be permitted to run free in the park
during designated hours.
   The battle has been brewing since dozens of adamant dog owners,
including Hockney, allowed their dogs to run loose in the affluent
neighborhood's park in defiance of the city's leash law.
   Stars fought on both sides.
   In a letter to the Council, ``Psycho'' star Anthony Perkins
complained that trips to the park were a ``nightmare.''
   ``My wife and my two school-age sons no longer even want to go
there at all at the risk of being run down by the dogs,'' Perkins
wrote. ``If anything, there should be a fenced dog playground in a
people's park, not the other way around.''
   Hockney, who featured the mountain's Mulholland Drive in one of
his paintings, responded to complaints about dog droppings: ``Some
of us think the world is a little too hygienic anyway.''
   Mondale took sides at the request of his daughter, Eleanor, who,
until moving to Chicago, liked to let her Rottweiler, Teddy, roam
the park.

   Service dogs like By Jove and Trigger can
retrieve dropped items, pull a shopping cart, turn on a light
switch or flip the brake lever on a wheelchair to a locked position.
   ``We really look for a dog with a work ethic,'' said Connie
Drobac, administrator of Southeastern Assistance Dogs, one of
several programs of the Speech, Hearing and Learning Center Inc. of
Greenville, S.C. ``A dog that just wants to sit under the kitchen
table would not work well as a hearing ear dog.''
   Drobac said the dogs, which can serve anyone with a hearing loss
of 45 decibels or more, can respond to a variety of sounds,
including the phone, a smoke alarm, a doorbell, a knock on the door
or a baby crying.
   She said the dogs are trained to go to their owners upon hearing
a sound and then to the source of that sound, except in the case of
a smoke alarm, when the dogs will dig at the ground.
   Training takes about six months for the program begun in 1984,
Drobac said during a demonstration with Trigger and By Jove in
Asheville last week. The dogs, she said, are mostly mixed breeds
from the humane society.

<HEAD>Salvadoran Archbishop Urges Flexibility For Peace Talks</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Roman Catholic church leader
on Sunday urged President Jose Napoleon Duarte to be more flexible
in his demands so that peace talks can resume with left-wing rebels.
   Archbishop Arturo Rivera Damas told reporters Duarte was too
firm in his demands that the guerrillas lay down their weapons and
participate in political activities before the stalled negotiations
can continue.
   ``I see that this is a position in which he should also take
into account the greater aspirations of the people. If he really
takes into account popular sentiments he should modify it,'' Rivera
Damas said.
   He spoke to reporters briefly after saying Mass at the
Metropolitan Cathedral.
   The Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, a coalition of
five guerrilla groups, is demanding a share of power immediately.
Front leaders have said such a coalition government should rewrite
the constitution and organize elections while the rebel combatants
would be integrated into the armed forces.
   Duarte, a Christian Democrat, said earlier this month he would
not budge in his demands.
   ``I cannot allow them (the guerrillas) to get away with a
formula in which they acquire power through force of arms,'' he
said during the inauguration of a new government hospital in a the
western part of the country.
   Government and rebel representatives held three meetings between
Oct. 15, 1984, and Oct. 5, 1987. All ended in deadlock. Rivera
Damas had acted as mediator in the negotiations.
   The rebels broke off the last round ot talks in protest against
the assassination of a prominent human rights activist.
   Peace negotiations are called for under a regional plan that
Duarte and the four other Central American presidents signed last
August in Guatemala.
   The plan calls for cease-fires in the conflicts in the Central
American countries, an end to outside military aid to insurgents
and reforms to bring about greater democracy.
   Human rights groups say more than 65,000 people have been slain
in political violence in the Salvadoran civil war that began in
1979, with most of the victims civilians.

   Police arrested 147 people in a weekend sweep
aimed at street gangs as the movie ``Colors,'' which some people
fear will incite gang violence, opened with only a few minor
disturbances, authorities said Sunday.
   Trouble at a theater in Northern California and another in San
Diego led to cancellation of the film, but few problems were
reported in Los Angeles despite predictions that the portrayal of
the local Crips and Bloods gangs would cause bloodshed.
   A 200-member police task force Saturday night stopped suspected
gang members on the street and checked for outstanding warrants,
making 147 felony and misdemeanor arrests. Seventy-three of those
arrested were suspected gang members, said Officer Larry Judd.
   One Los Angeles man was killed Saturday in gang violence
unrelated to the movie. James Conrad Voldseth, 28, of Sunland was
stabbed by two gang members during a drug deal in the San Fernando
Valley community of Pacioma, police said.
   No violence was reported Saturday night at theaters showing
``Colors'' in Los Angeles and neighboring suburbs. At the film's
opening Friday, minor scuffles prompted 13 arrests.
   ``So far, we have had no reaction whatsoever from the kids,''
said Sgt. A. Talanoa of the Inglewood Police Department.
   In affluent Westwood, where a woman was killed by a stray bullet
during a gang confrontation in January, there were no incidents at
the two theaters showing the film.
   ``Maybe it won't be as volatile as people think, said Sgt. Rick
Walker.
   The Guardian Angels, the self-styled crime-fighters, had been
among those claiming the film glorified gangs and would prompt more
violence.
   Michael Schnell, manager of the Hollywood Pacific Theater, where
10 of Friday's arrests were made, said the 1,000-seat theater is
continuing to sell out for evening shows. He said Saturday's
performance sparked no violence.
   ``It's only a movie,'' Schnell said. ``Everybody seems pleased
with it.''
   In the community of Colma, south of San Francisco, Police Chief
Arthur Dollosso ordered a downtown theater to stop showing the
movie Saturday because, police said, crowds outside the theater
nearly got out of hand Friday night.
   A theater at a San Diego shopping center stopped showing
``Colors'' after a shouting match at a screening Friday.
   ``Colors,'' an Orion release starring Sean Penn and Robert
Duvall as Los Angeles officers in a police anti-gang unit, opened
at 425 theaters nationwide. Director Dennis Hopper employed real
gang members as extras during filming and relied on off-duty
officers as technical advisers.
   Before the movie opened, about 15 theaters nationwide reportedly
dropped plans to show the film. One downtown Los Angeles theater
and two theaters in San Bernardino County communities troubled by
gang violence canceled the film.
   Between Jan. 1 and April 4, there were 89 gang-related deaths in
Los Angeles County. Last year, there were 387 gang-related deaths
in the area.
   In the Detroit suburb of Bloomfield Township, meanwhile, police
reported a shooting early Sunday outside a five-theater complex
where ``Colors'' had been shown. A manager at Showcase Cinema who
asked not to be identified said he believed the shooting was
unrelated to ``Colors'' and that those involved had seen a
different film.
   The shooting broke windows at the cinema and injured an
18-year-old man, whom police refused to identify.

<HEAD>Thunderstorms In Southern Plains, Heavy Snow In New England</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Showers and thunderstorms, some accompanied by funnel clouds,
spread over sections of the southern Plains and Texas on Sunday,
and snow fell on the mountains of the Southwest and northern New
England.
   Mount Washington in New Hampshire, the highest peak in the
Northeast, had accumulated nearly a yard of snow since Friday night.
   Showers and thunderstorms reached from central Texas across
north-central Texas and southern Oklahoma, and showers extended
across Oklahoma, eastern Kansas and northwestern Missouri.
   Locally heavy rain caused street flooding in sections of Wichita
Falls, Texas, the National Weather Service said.
   During the six hours up to 2 p.m. EDT, 1.34 inches of rain fell
at Wichita Falls, with 1.14 inches at Abilene, Texas, and 1.06
inches at Altus, Okla.
   Funnel clouds were spotted over Texas' southern Plains and the
Panhandle, but none touched down and no damage was reported.
   Hail as big as golfballs was reported in some areas of Texas.
   Rain over southern Nevada changed to snow over a small section
of southwestern Utah and northern Arizona.
   In northern Arizona, about a foot of snow fell near the Snow
Bowl ski resort above Flagstaff, with 10 inches at lower elevations
around Flagstaff, which is at an elevation of nearly 7,000 feet.
The area also had gusty wind and 2-foot snowdrifts were reported
east of Flagstaff, the weather service said.
   Light snow continued falling in Maine at both Caribou and
Limestone.
   In northern New Hampshire, Pittsburg had accumulated 14 inches
of snow from a slow-moving storm and 32.5 inches of snow had fallen
since midnight Friday atop Mount Washington, at an elevation of
6,288 feet.
   ``Any time you get three feet of snow it's a lot of snow, even
for here,'' weather observer Chris Norcross said by telephone from
the Mount Washington summit, which records some of the fiercest
weather on Earth.
   Elsewhere, showers were scattered over the Pacific Northwest
during the morning.
   Wind gusted to 61 mph between El Paso, Texas, and Carlsbad, N.M.
High wind advisories were posted there and over the Mojave and
Tehachapi areas of southern California.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 34
degrees at both International Falls and Warroad, Minn., to 86 at
Laredo, Texas. The low for the day was 26 degrees at Devils Lake,
N.D.
   For Monday, showers, possibly mixed with snow, were forecast
over northern New England, with showers extending from the
remainder of New England across the lower Great Lakes, Pennsylvania
and New Jersey. Showers and thundershowers were forecast over the
Virginias, the Ohio Valley, the Tennessee Valley, the western
Carolinas, Georgia, the central Gulf of Mexico states, eastern
Louisiana, Arkansas, the southern half of Missouri and southern
Illinois. Showers also were forecast from Oregon across Idaho, the
northeastern half of Nevada and western Utah.
   Highs only in the 30s and 40s were predicted in northern Maine,
the Great Lakes, the upper Mississippi Valley and eastern North
Dakota; in the 70s and 80s from the Carolinas across Florida, from
the central Gulf of Mexico states across the lower Mississippi
Valley, much of Texas and the desert Southwest; and generally in
the 50s and 60s over the remainder of the nation.

<HEAD>Fight Over Hearsay Evidence, Dying Declaration Expected In
Chambers Case</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CONCORD, N.H. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The freedom of a former Marlow police chief
accused of killing his wife's first husband could hinge on whether
a statement made by the chief's father just before his death will
be admitted as evidence in court.
   Robert Chambers, 36, was charged with second-degree murder
Friday and spent the weekend in the Cheshire County Jail in
Westmoreland after failing to make $200,000 bail. If convicted, he
could be sentenced to life in prison.
   He was charged one month after authorities dug up the remains of
Russell Bean, whose body was secretly buried in the chief's yard 10
years ago.
   John B. Garvey, a Concord lawyer and former professor at
Franklin Pierce Law School specializing in evidence, said the case
may ``rise or fall on many of the judge's rulings on admissibility
of evidence.''
   Attorney General Stephen Merrill said he expected Chambers'
defense to challenge the use of the father's statement, but he said
the prosecution had enough evidence to win a conviction even
without the statement.
   Bean's remains were found buried 25 feet deep in Chambers' yard
on March 14. An autopsy showed he appeared to have been beaten with
a blunt instrument on the head and chest.
   Police acted after Chambers' sister, Melissa, gave them a tip on
March 10, the day after the death of her father, 61-year-old
Clifton Chambers. Melissa Chambers said in affidavits that her
father told her he had helped his son bury the body after Robert
admitted accidentally killing Bean in a fight. She said her father
told her to tell police the story upon his death.
   Clifton Chambers' granddaughter, Lorrie Wheeler, gave police a
similar affidavit.
   Public defender Mark Sisti, representing Chambers, said he would
``disagree strenuously'' with the use of the father's statements as
hearsay evidence.
   In homicide cases, New Hampshire courts allow hearsay evidence
to be admitted when it involves deathbed confessions.
   But Sisti said the father's statement would not qualify because
it did not concern a person the father thought was causing his own
death. Also, the lawyer said the father's words weren't a dying
statement because he spoke to his daughter and granddaughter days
before he suffered a cerebral hemorrhage and died.
   The state rules provide other exceptions for using hearsay
evidence, but the defense could challenge it on the grounds that
the father's reliability as a witness cannot be tested and that
Chambers cannot be granted his Sixth Amendment right to confront
his accuser.
   Merrill said he anticipates the state Supreme Court will settle
the admissibility of the father's statement.
   ``I feel very doubtful that Russell Bean would ever (have) been
found'' without the father's statement, Merrill said. But he said
investigators, after talking to 15 or 20 people, have enough
evidence to convict Chambers even without the declaration. He did
not elaborate.
   Bean, 25 when he was last seen in 1978, was a good friend of
Chambers.
   Chambers and his wife, Deborah, swapped partners with Bean and
his wife, Sylvia, according to affadivits by Chambers'
brother-in-law, Louis LaCourse, and Melissa Chambers.
   Sylvia divorced Bean after he disappeared and Chambers divorced
Deborah, and then Sylvia and Chambers married. They separated after
Bean's remains were found. Sylvia has denied any wife-swapping.
   Chambers has resigned as Marlow's part-time chief and took a
leave of absence as part-time chief of nearby Gilsum.

<HEAD>Lance Predicts Jackson Will Get About 40 Percent Of New York
Primary Vote</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Georgia Democratic Party Chairman Bert
Lance, a Jesse Jackson supporter, predicts his candidate will win
about 40 percent of the vote in this week's New York Democratic
primary.
   But Lance contends that for Jackson, New York is not a
``must-win'' contest.
   ``Jesse's in a position where obviously he does not have to win.
But (Massachusetts Gov. Michael) Dukakis does,'' he said.
   Lance, who was federal budget director in the Carter
administration and has served as an unofficial adviser to the
Jackson campaign, said Jackson could benefit from a close
second-place finish in the Tuesday primary.
   Lance told the Rome News-Tribune last week he thinks Jackson
will improve on his 25 percent showing in New York in 1984.
Depending on how Dukakis and Sen. Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee
split the remaining votes, Lance said, 40 percent could be enough
to win.
   If Dukakis posted a strong victory in New York, that would
result in ``great pressure by those who don't want to see Jackson
continue to do well, to try to say it's all over,'' Lance said.
   Lance warned against premature statements that Dukakis has the
Democratic nomination wrapped up.
   ``Whether that's accurate, you still have to wait and see,'' he
said. ``You can't deny the people the right to make their choice.
And, that means you've got to go through that whole process,
because Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, California, New Jersey all are
still to come.''

<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Corazon Aquino returned
Sunday from a visit to China and said the capture of renegade
soldiers during her absence proved political stability was a
``permanent condition in the Philippines.
   ``No one can say now that political stability in the Philippines
is a daily battle that must be waged by the president herself,''
Mrs. Aquino said during a welcoming ceremony at a heavily guarded
air base near Manila.
   She left Thursday for China and returned home after an overnight
stay in Hong Kong. It was her first trip abroad since visiting
Japan in November 1986.
   Mrs. Aquino became the chief executive after President Ferdinand
E. Marcos fled the country in February 1968 during a
civilian-military revolt. He is now living in Hawaii.
   ``I think we have done our country proud during this trip,''
Mrs. Aquino said. ``More particularly the Filipino people, who have
shown once and for all that freedom and stability are not weak and
fragile achievements but a permanent condition in the Philippines.''
   On Friday, troops captured 10 followers of former Lt. Col.
Gregorio ``Gringo'' Honasan, including eight navy guards who helped
Honasan escape on April 2 from a prison ship. Honasan had escaped
from the ship accompanied by 14 of his guards.
   The military went on full alert to prevent Honasan from leading
an attack while the president was abroad. Honasan led an Aug. 28
revolt in which 53 people were killed and hundreds wounded.
   In China, Mrs. Aquino won pledges of support from senior leader
Deng Xiaoping for her government, which is seeking to crush a
19-year-old communist insurgency.
   Mrs. Aquino said China and the Philippines agreed to increase
trade from an annual $293 million to $800 million in five years.
   The Chinese also pledged to reduce the Philippines' trade
deficit by importing more goods from this country, she said.
   ``On the intangible but far from unimportant side, a truer and
deeper understanding has been achieved by the leaders of China and
the Philippines,'' she said.
   ``And with that understanding has come apparently an
appreciation on China's part for what we are trying to achieve
here. Deng Xiaoping expressed the support of the Chinese Communist
Party for our government and our aims to achieve economic
progress.''
   Some people at the airport chanted, ``Cory, Cory, Cory,'' while
others held banners of support for her government.
   Imelda Laguindam, spokeswoman for the United Filipinos, an
umbrella organization of 14 associations representing about 6,000
maids and servants, said she tried to hand Mrs. Aquino a letter but
was thwarted by bodyguards.
   The letter reiterated demands that the working conditions of
maids from the Philippines who work in Hong Kong be improved and
expressed opposition to the U.S. military bases in the Philippines.
   Mrs. Aquino had met with Sir David Wilson, the governor of Hong
Kong, but no details of their conversation were released. Officials
in Manila said earlier Mrs. Aquino would ask the governor for help
in improving the maids' working conditions.
   In China, Mrs. Aquino visited the village of Hongjian in Fujian

   Palestinians angered by the assassination of a
PLO leader boycotted their jobs and staged protest marches Sunday.
Israel imposed curfews on cities and camps in the occupied
territories.
   Eight Arabs were wounded in scattered clashes with Israeli
soldiers in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, hospital
officials said.
   Leaders of the Palestine Liberation Organization have blamed
Israel for Saturday's killing of PLO military chief, Khalil
al-Wazir, in Tunisia. Many protesters carried black flags Sunday to
mourn his death.
   Also Sunday, most of about 100,000 Arabs who work in Israel
stayed away from their jobs. Most businesses in the occupied
territories were closed in the new general strike called to protest
al-Wazir's death.
   The strike coincided with the beginning of Ramadan, a month-long
Moslem period of fasting. In the West Bank town of Obeidiyeh, near
Bethlehem, about 4,000 Arabs held a march Sunday before prayers,
chanting anti-Israeli slogans. Arab witnesses said three protesters
suffered injuries from beatings by Israeli soldiers who used force
to disperse the march.
   In the Gaza Strip, where al-Wazir once lived and where he still
has relatives, soldiers opened fire on teen-agers who blocked roads
with burning tires and stoned the troops. Six rioters were wounded,
according to officials at Gaza's Shifa Hospital.
   Troops also shot and wounded two Palestinians near Tulkarem in
the West Bank after the Arabs tried to assault the soldiers with
hatchets, Israel radio reported. The army confirmed the report.
   The death toll from violence that swept the occupied lands after
al-Wazir's slaying rose to 17. A 13-year-old boy and a 23-year-old
man died Sunday from bullet wounds inflicted the day before,
according to Palestinian sources.
   The Israeli military command said the reports were being checked.
   Saturday's death toll was the worst in a single day since the
Arab uprising began Dec. 8. At least 166 Palestinians and two
Israelis have been killed.
   As PLO chief Yasser Arafat's No. 2 man, Al-Wazir supervised
military operations in the territories occupied by Israel since the
1967 Middle East War.
   As main military planner for the PLO's mainstream Fatah, he was
held responsible by Israel for a list of bloody terror attacks,
including a bus hijacking last month in which three Israelis were
killed. However, Israel has refrained from directly addressing
Palestinian charges and press reports saying it was behind
al-Wazir's
   The Israeli-owned Itim news agency reported that the army
declared all cities and towns and most of the highways in the
occupied West Bank as closed military zones.
   An army spokesman said the military imposed a curfew on 22
refugee camps and villages in the occupied territories. He said the
army also barred journalists and non-residents from Anabta and from
Nablus, the largest city in the West Bank with a population of
100,000.
   In Jerusalem Sunday, Israeli police detained an Arab American
activist, Mubarak Awad, for 30 minutes at the gates one of Islam's
holiest site, the Al Aqsa Mosque, Awad said.
   A Christian who advocates non-violent resistance, he was
accompanying two Greek Orthodox priests to express sympathy to
Palestinian mourners at a memorial service for al-Wazir.
   Israel also threatened Sunday to shut two Arab-owned weekly
magazines published in Israeli-annexed East Jerusalem.
   Last month, Israel closed the Palestine Press Service, a daily
news service for foreign journalists, for six months.
   Meanwhile, the Arab rebellion to Israel's military rule has hurt
Israel's tourist industry, Israel radio reported Sunday.
   The report said government statistics released Sunday showed
142,000 tourists visited the country in March, or 17 percent fewer
than in January and February. March is usually one of the peak
months for tourism because of the Easter and Passover holidays.
   Meanwhile, figures from a sample of 150 Israeli factories showed
up to 10 percent losses in sales per factory last month because of
a boycott of Israeli goods by Arabs in the occupied territories,
the radio said.
   Economic Affairs Minister Gad Yaacobi has estimated that the
Palestinian uprising has cost the economy at least $300 million.

   Hundreds of make-believe British troops
and American colonists wearing 18th century uniforms Sunday fired
blanks from their muskets and flintlocks in mock battles replaying
the start of the Revolutionary War.
   They were two days early, making a concession for the weekend.
But otherwise they re-enacted the events of April 19, 1775, when
the American Minutemen sent the British regulars retreating to
Boston after the first casualties of the war fell at the Old North
Bridge here.
   ``We're better than the Red Sox _ we're up 2-0 in the last of
seventh,'' said Mike Ryan, who is an assistant dean of students at
Boston College when he is not commanding colonial militia.
   ``By the end of the day we should be up 4-0,'' he said after the
Americans sent the British scurrying from Meriam's Corner in the
day's second battle.
   Sunday's re-enactment drew hundreds of participants in historic
militias _ 200 men on the colonists' side from around New England
and 150 men portraying British soldiers from regiments as far away
as New Brunswick, Canada, Ryan said. Some 300 spectators watched
the skirmish at Meriam's Corner.
   Other celebrations marking the start of the American revolution
were scheduled for the Patriot's Day state holiday Monday,
including parades in Boston, Arlington and Lexington; re-creations
of Paul Revere's ride and the battle of Lexington, and patriotic
ceremonies in other towns.

<HEAD>U.S. Envoy Seeks Farm-Subsidy Accord by December</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BRADLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The top U.S. trade envoy
Sunday called for a framework agreement by December to end the
global farm subsidy war, but the European Common Market's farm
commissioner failed to budge on the issue.
   Following weekend talks with his counterparts from the European
Community, Japan and Canada, U.S. Trade Representative Clayton
Yeutter said there was no justification for industrialized
countries to continue subsidizing exports of farm products or other
goods.
   But Yeutter also said at a news conference following the
ministerial retreat on Quadra Island near Vancouver that the
meeting had seen little progress in resolving the issue.
   The retreat was one of two weekend Quadrilateral Trade Meetings
held each year. The next is scheduled for Gull Lake, Minn., on June
22-24.
   Realistically, Yeutter said, the Reagan administration would
like an outline agreement by December on eliminating farm subsidies
within the 95-nation General Agreement on Tariffs on Trade.
   The GATT agreement is being renegotiated in a round of talks
launched in September 1986 in Punta del Este, Uruguay. A crucial
mid-term meeting of all members is scheduled in Montreal next
December.
   The United States has proposed phasing out of farm subsidies
that create export surpluses by the year 2000.
   Yeutter acknowledged that the 12-nation European Community _
whose subsidy-heavy budget is dominated by its farm program _
considered the target unrealistic and said he was willing to look
at a longer time frame.
   ``But let's not conclude that it's impossible to rid the world
of these onerous practices,'' he said.
   European Community Trade Commissioner Willy de Clercq said the
EEC already had adopted a policy of curbing farm production. But he
described the U.S. proposal as unreasonable and accused the United
States of preaching free trade while practicing intervention.
   ``Both of us spend about $30 billion (a year) to support
farming,'' de Clercq told reporters. ``There are about 2.5 to 3
million farmers in the United States and 12 million in the European
Community. It's not difficult to draw the conclusion which farmers
are more supported.''
   He cited a recent increase in the U.S. export enhancement
program under which nearly 12 million tons of cut-rate wheat was
sold to the Soviet Union in the past year.
   De Clercq said the EEC was willing to negotiate on farm
subsidies but only as part of a balanced ``global package''
covering areas such as investment, services and improved access for
products from tropical Third World countries.
   Canadian trade minister John Crosbie said he hoped for an
agreement by December to at least freeze farm subsidies at current
levels.
   Canada and the Cairns group of grain exporters that include
Australia say they have been victimized by the subsidy war because
their treasuries cannot compete with the U.S. and EEC giants.
   The issue will be in the spotlight throughout the year,
including next month's Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development meeting in Paris, the seven-nation world Economic
Summit in Toronto in June and the next scheduled trade
Quadrilateral in June.
   Both de Clercq and Hajime Tamure, the Japanese trade minister,
said they welcomed the U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement negotiated
last year, but yet to be ratified, as a symbol of more open world
trading.
   But de Clercq said EEC officials still are studying the pact to
ensure that it falls under GATT rules.

   Israeli sources said Sunday that Israeli agents
had assassinated PLO official Khalil al-Wazir, the No. 2 man in the
organization who headed the uprising in the occupied territories.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir declined comment.
   The sources said the operation was carried out jointly by the
Mossad intelligence service, the Israeli navy and an elite commando
unit. They spoke on condition of anonymity.
   They said it had been postponed several times before Saturday.
   Al-Wazir, who was in charge of the PLO's military operations
against Israel, was shot to death Saturday at his home in the Tunis
suburb of La Marsa by an eight-member squad.
   Palestine Liberation Organization officials blamed Israel,
saying the killing was designed to demoralize Palestinians and end
PLO-directed protests in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   ``I'm not ready to relate to these matters,'' Shamir told The
Associated Press at his office in Jerusalem when asked about
reports Israel was behind the operation.
   NBC News said Sunday night it had been told that Shamir was so
happy at the success of the operation he sent a message
congratulating the commandos while they were still sailing home.
   It did not say who provided that information but said Shamir
spent a tense Friday night waiting for the news and was overjoyed
there were no Israeli casualities. The report said Shamir told the
military chief of staff the assassination showed Israel could
strike far and fast.
   The Israeli news media no mention of such a Shamir message and
the prime minister could not be reached late Sunday for comment on
the NBC report.
   Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, co-leader of the coalition
government, said in an interview on Israel radio that he hoped
al-Wazir's assassination would not affect peace efforts.
   Apparently referring to al-Wazir, he added: ``We have to uproot
violence as a ... factor that delays a political development.
People who use violence will in the end see the limits of violence.
It leads nowhere.''
   The issue came up only briefly in Israel's regular Cabinet
meeting Sunday. Israel radio said that when Shamir was asked what
happened, he said he had heard the details on the radio.
   NBC television said Shamir, Peres and Defense Minister Yitzhak
Rabin approved the assassination after Fatah guerrillas hijacked a
bus and killed three Israelis in southern Israel's Negev desert
last month.
   Former intelligence officials and Israeli newspapers openly
compared the assassination to Israel's April 1973 raid on PLO
offices in Beirut in which three top PLO officials were killed.
   They also noted Israel, not rival PLO factions or Arab regimes,
had the ability to mount such a sophisticated operation 1,500 miles
from its shores.
   Rafael Eytan, who resigned as head of a defense ministry
intelligence unit after the Jonathan Pollard spy scandal in 1985,
said, ``there is no doubt there is a parallel'' between the attacks.
   The 1973 slaying was aimed at Ali Hassan Salameh, known as Abu
Hassan, the PLO's security and intelligence chief who later died in
a car bomb attack. Instead, Al-Wazir's predecessor, Kamel Adwan,
Fatah spokesman Kamal Nasser and Mohammed Abu Najjar, a key figure
in the Black September terror group, were killed.
   In the 1973 attack, the navy put a commando team ashore, rented
cars were used to get to and from the target, documents were seized
and a women participated in the raid.
   In Saturday's attack, rented cars were used, documents taken and
a woman was among the hit team.
   Israeli experts say al-Wazir was responsible for a list of
bloody attacks such as the 1975 takeover of the Savoy Hotel in Tel
Aviv in which 11 hostages were slain and a March 1978 bus hijacking
in which 33 Israelis were killed and 82 wounded.
   Three Israelis involved in the 1973 raid now hold senior
security positions. The raid's leader was Maj. Gen. Amnon Shahak,
now head of military intelligence, it was planned by Gen. Ehud
Barak, the current deputy chief of staff, and one of the commandos
was Col. Yigal Pressler, now Shamir's adviser on terrorism.
   In an interview conducted before the Tunis attack and published
this week by the army weekly Bamahane, Shahak said Israel had a
policy of striking at Palestinian guerrilla leaders.
   ``In my opinion whoever leads acts of terror is a proper target
for liquidation. Whoever uses terrorism against us should be a
target,'' Shahak was quoted as saying.
   Asked if such an operation could be mounted now, he said ``I
have no doubt that today it's possible to do it, only better.''
   Similar remarks came from Pressler who told the daily Davar
newspaper April 12 that ``we have to initiate deadly attacks
against the terrorist leaders.''
   The daily Yediot Ahronot said Israel had several motives to kill
al-Wazir. These included showing the Palestinians that Israel could
strike a deadly blow from a great distance and demonstrate to the
Arab world that Israel's military capabilities had not weakened.

   John Demjanjuk, who has spent the past 11 years
fighting charges he was the notorious Nazi death camp guard ``Ivan
the Terrible,'' faces a verdict Monday in his 14-month-long court
battle in Israel.
   The three-judge panel's 450-page judgment is based on more than
15,000 pages of emotionally charged testimony from Holocaust
survivors, documents experts and the suspect himself.
   Holocaust mastermind Adolf Eichmann, the only other Nazi war
criminal to be tried in Israel, was convicted and hanged in 1962.
Unlike Eichmann, Demjanjuk has insisted he is an innocent victim of
mistaken identity.
   The retired autoworker from Cleveland, Ohio, is charged with
being a brutally sadistic guard who operated gas chambers that
killed 850,000 Jews at the Treblinka death camp in Nazi-occupied
Poland in 1942 and 1943. ``Ivan'' allegedly tortured prisoners on
their way to their deaths.
   During the trial witnesses told the court that ``Ivan the
Terrible'' would stand near the entrance of the gas chambers and
strike the doomed prisoners with a metal bar or bayonet.
   Many observers argue the case against Demjanjuk has not been
proven beyond a shadow of a doubt, despite the tearful insistence
of five death camp survivors who claim to recognize the defendant
as ``Ivan'' more than 40 years after the Holocaust.
   But few Israelis doubt the judges will hand in a guilty verdict.
For them, the only question is whether the Ukrainian-born
Demjanjuk, 68, will be spared the death penalty.
   ``After the emotional accounts of the survivors, people expect a
guilty verdict,'' said Gabriel Bron, a reporter for the Yediot
Ahronot newspaper who covered the trial.
   ``Many want vengeance and a death sentence, but there is a
minority voice calling for life imprisonment.''
   If Demjanjuk is found guilty Monday, he will be sentenced at a
later, separate hearing.
   About 250,000 spectators attended the trial's 106 sessions,
which the government held in a converted movie theater at a cost of
$650,000.
   Despite holes in the prosecution case, Demjanjuk was plagued
throughout the trial by a stumbling defense team which seemed to
move two steps backward for every step forward.
   Demjanjuk's relatives raised more than $650,000 for the defense,
but their lawyers often appeared unprepared, failed to come up with
a coherent account of his whereabouts during World War II and
antagonized judges by engaging in behavior bordering on the absurd.
   Two defense witnesses walked off the stand in the middle of
cross-examination, one claiming the defense had threatened a law
suit if he continued to testify.
   Other defense experts were discredited, including one who
retracted her testimony and another who tried to commit suicide
after her credentials were questioned.
   Even Demjanjuk grew frustrated, firing Mark O'Connor of Buffalo,
N.Y., his attorney of seven years, midway through the proceedings.
   But Demjanjuk's supporters contend the defendant's biggest
problem was being tried before Jewish judges of the same generation
as the Nazi victims testifying against him.
   One judge, Polish-born Zvi Tal, lost family in the Holocaust.
   Much of the trial focused on a lengthy, often repetitive debate
over the authenticity of a key piece of prosecution evidence,
Demjanjuk's alleged Nazi identity card.
   About 500 exhibits, including a paper clip, were submitted to
bolster the testimony of six prosecution experts who said the card
was authentic. Six defense witnesses maintained the document was
fake.
   Demjanjuk contends the document was fabricated by the Soviet
Union to punish him for serving in an anti-Communist unit formed by
the Nazis at the end of World War II.
   Although interest waned and frustration mounted in Israel as
Demjanjuk's trial dragged on for months, some Israelis say the fact
that it took place at all has healed some wounds.
   ``The trial has served as a kind of catharsis for many Holocaust
victims,'' said Cleveland-born Toby Greenwald, whose father-in-law,
Menachem, lost his entire family in Nazi death camps.
   He always refused to talk about his experiences but ``there was
something about the trial that just opened up some kind of deep
well,'' she said. ``He began to release all those pent-up
feelings.''
   But the prospect of a verdict has brought mixed emotions to
dozens of Nazi victims who attended the trial over the year.
   ``If the judges don't find him guilty, I think I'll kill
myself,'' said Holocaust survivor Mordechai Fuchs, 63, as he
tearfully fingered a worn photograph of his parents, three brothers
and a sister killed at Treblinka.
   Even if Demjanjuk wins an acquittal Monday, he will not walk
away from the converted movie theater in Jerusalem a free man.
   Stripped of his U.S. citizenship before extradition to Israel in
February 1986, Demjanjuk is stateless.
   Lawyers say that if he is acquitted they expect the United
States to consider reactivating plans to deport Demjanjuk to the
Soviet Union. Such a move had been a possibility before 1983, when
Israel requested his extradition.
   ``This is a man without a nation, he has no papers. When the
trial ends, our problems don't end. They're only beginning,'' said
Demjanjuk's son-in-law Ed Nishnic.

   A mentally impaired man who was shot and
wounded when he pointed a toy gun at a sheriff's deputy was in
critical condition Sunday, authorities said.
   John Betts, 36, who went by the nickname ``Cowboy,'' was shot
twice in the abdomen Saturday when he pointed a realistic replica
of a .38-caliber pistol at deputies, Los Angeles County Sheriff's
Department spokesman Hal Grant said.
   He was in critical condition Sunday at Martin Luther King
Jr.-Drew Medical Center, said nursing supervisor Ruby Grant.
   Workers at the nearby Highland Manor board-and-care home where
Betts had been living said he often dressed like a cowboy, but they
hadn't seen him act in a threatening way or carry a gun or replica.
Workers said he was mentally impaired, but wasn't confined to the
home.
   ``The only thing I've ever seen him with was his cigarettes and
a cup of coffee,'' said employee Vicki Riddick.
   Deputy Darrel Airhart, a seven-year veteran, shot Betts twice
when Betts pointed the fake gun at him, officials said.
   The deputy was dispatched after a report of a man with a gun
outside a fast-food restaurant.

   A fire that threatened an entire downtown
block of old Victorian buildings badly damaged two buildings
occupied by squatters and killed one woman, officials said Sunday.
   The fire, of undetermined cause, also badly damaged a
three-story house that had been converted into an apartment
building. Total damages were estimated at $400,000, assistant fire
Chief Don Matthews said.
   The blaze began about 10:30 p.m. Saturday about a block from the
city's new Hyatt Regency Hotel and was so intense that half the
city's firefighting force was called out, Matthews said. It took 90
minutes to bring the fire under control.
   ``The main problem was it was a congested block of 100-year-old
buildings and it would have gone through them in a few minutes,''
said Matthews.
   One of the squatter buildings belonged to Oakland Tribune
society columnist Robin Orr and had been the center of controversy
for months.
   Homeless people had occupied the building to seek shelter from
the winter. Police removed them once, Matthews said, but squatters
broke back in a short while later.
   The coroners office said Sunday it was trying to unravel
``conflicting stories'' about the identity of the dead woman found
in one of the squatter buildings. One man was reported missing in
the fire, but Matthews said no additional bodies had been found by
mid-day Sunday.

<TEXT>
   The boyfriend of one of four brutally
slain teen-agers blames authorities for not arresting the murder
suspect after the man allegedly threatened him with a knife and
smashed his pickup truck.
   Ricky Moore, who had been dating 17-year-old Shannon Mann for
about six weeks, said Saturday that if police and prosecutors had
acted more quickly, the bloodbath in which Shannon and three
siblings died might have been avoided.
   Moore said he filed charges against Shannon's jealous
ex-boyfriend after an incident on March 28, spoke with police
repeatedly and gave detectives statements.
   ``I thought when someone attempted to kill someone, they picked
him up, and off to jail he went,'' the truck driver said Saturday.
   Leo Narvaiz, 20, was arrested after Friday's killings and is
being held on four capital murder charges and another charge in
lieu of a $4.05 million bond.
   Authorities found cuts on Narvaiz's arms and stabs to the thigh.
But the suspect's father, Leopoldo Narvaiz Sr., said one of his
son's friends told him the wounds were received in a fight with
another man at the Manns' home the evening of the slayings.
   Moore told the San Antonio Light that Shannon had been trying to
get Narvaiz to leave her alone for more than a year without
success. The Mann family moved just 2{ weeks ago to get away from
Narvaiz's constant harassment and alleged break-ins, Moore said.
   Moore, 24, said Narvaiz went on a jealous rampage on March 28,
breaking out the windows and bashing the fenders of Moore's
4-month-old pickup, causing about $2,000 in damage.
   He said Narvaiz later repeatedly threatened to kill him with a
fish-cleaning knife. Moore said he averted an attack by hitting
Narvaiz on the side of the neck with a baseball bat and knocking
him down.
   The suspect's father said his son told him he smashed the truck
windows because Moore tried to run over him, the Dallas Times
Herald reported.
   When police arrived at the Mann family's home after that
incident, Moore said he thought they were going to take Narvaiz to
jail.
   Shannon and her 19-year-old sister Jennifer also went to police
headquarters Tuesday to give statements on the incident, Moore
said. They were killed Friday, along with their 15-year-old sister
Martha and 11-year-old brother Ernest Jr.
   Moore, who visited with the teen-agers' parents Friday, said he
is outraged at what he considers foot-dragging by police and
prosecutors.
   The elder Narvaiz claims his son is innocent and was in love
with one of the victims. ``He is not the type of boy who would do a
foolish thing like that,'' he said, adding that his family has been
harrassed by threatening and obscene phone calls.
   Law enforcement officials responded Saturday that even if they
had speeded up development of the cases against Narvaiz, the
criminal justice system is so clogged it probably would have taken
even more time to secure his arrest.
   After the March 28 incident police opened two separate
investigations, one for a misdemeanor terroristic threat handled by
the homicide division and one for third-degree felony criminal
mischief handled by the burglary detail.
   Homicide Sgt. Mike Akeroyd said Saturday the investigation into
the terroristic threat was completed and ``walked over to the
district attorney's office'' April 5 but no action was taken.
   District Attorney Fred Rodriguez said he was told Friday that
his office had accepted the misdemeanor case, and he asked why an
arrest warrant had not been issued.
   ``What I was told was no warrant was issued because the
misdemeanor courts do not issue arrest warrants in Class B
misdemeanor cases because of the flood of cases they handle and the
overcrowded jail situation,'' Rodriguez said. ``The court would
have issued a summons'' for Narvaiz to appear in court.
   Assistant District Attorney Ed Coffey, who screens criminal
cases submitted for prosecution, said his office had not yet issued
a summons in that case.
   On the felony criminal mischief case, Coffey said it at one
point was rejected by the district attorney's office because it did
not have Moore's statement as the victim attached.
   ``We were forced to send the case back to the police,'' Coffey
said. ``We then accepted the case the day before (the murders),''
after police returned the case with the missing statement attached.

   A passenger aboard a hijacked Kuwait
Airways jumbo jet said Sunday about 35 hostages on the plane faced
certain death if Kuwait refused to release 17 convicted terrorists.
   ``All the passengers are in good health. I hope the Kuwait
government will act quickly to liberate the 17 young prisoners.
Otherwise we all face a black end,'' said the man. He identified
himself as Suleiman Farhan Doukhi.
   Doukhi, who spoke Arabic in a firm voice, also sent ``greetings
to the Kuwait people, to my mother and father and to all those who
miss me.''
   The message appeared to be a recording.
   On Friday, the hijackers brought two other passengers to the
aircraft's radio to make similar statements to the control tower
and one on Thursday.
   Shortly bt Sunday, several Algerian police cars traveled to and
from the plane. It could not be determined who was in the cars. The
Kuwaiti delegation remained in an airport lounge well after
midnight.
   It was the latest the delegation had stayed at the airport since
negotiations began, leading to speculation the hijackers might make
a gesture connected with the Moslems' observance of Ramadan, the
month-long period of fasting. Ramadan begins Monday.
   Since the Bangkok-to-Kuwait flight was hijacked April 5, the
hijackers have demanded the release of the 17 extremists, jailed
for bombing the U.S. and French embassies in Kuwait in December
1983.
   Kuwait has rejected the demand.
   The plane, carrying 112 passengers, first landed in Iran, where
57 hostages were released and additional hijackers reportedly
boarded the plane. The jet then went to Larnaca, Cyprus, where the
gunmen killed two passengers and released 13.
   On Wednesday, it arrived in Algiers and on Friday the hijackers
released an ailing hostage.
   Algerian officials said Sunday that Palestine Liberation
Organization leader Yasser Arafat was expected in Algiers but
declined to say when he would arrive or whether he would play a
role in the negotiations.
   On the morning of the 13th day of the crisis, Algerian
authorities abruptly expelled hundreds of print and television
reporters from the section of the VIP lounge where they had been
staying for nearly a week.
   Reporters moved into tents, erected by Algerian security men, on
the lawn near the lounge.
   At about the same time, Algerian policemen, armed with pistols,
took up position on the roof of the terminal building facing the
plane. It was not clear why they had been dispatched.
   One official, who refused to be identified by name, said the
lounge was needed for Arab ambassadors expected to come to the
airport for a possible expansion of the negotiations.
   The official declined to provide any details.
   The Shiite Moslem gunmen have threatened to fly the jet out of
Algeria ``to settle our score with Kuwait somewhere else.'' Early
Sunday, they said they would extend their ``departure time
warning'' to pursue negotiations. There has been no indication of
where they might go.
   The estimated five to eight hijackers asked for and received
about 6,600 gallons of fuel to maintain conditions inside the
plane, but did not set a deadline or directly repeat their previous
threats to kill the hostages and blow up the plane. The hijackers
also asked for and were given newspapers.
   On Saturday, Sheik Jaber Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah, Kuwait's ruler,
telephoned President Chadli Bendjedid of Algeria to ask that the
plane not be allowed to leave.
   In a brief statement in Arabic to the control tower, the
hijackers said, ``At the request of our brothers the Algerians we
announce that we have agreed to extend the departure time warning
to give an opportunity for the efforts by the Algerians.''
   Algerian negotiators boarded the blue and white Boeing 747 twice
during the day, first at 11:10 a.m. (6:10 a.m.) and again at 4:45
p.m. (11:45 a.m.).
   Inside the airport terminal building, Algerian Interior Minister
Hedi Khediri pursued negotiations with a high-level Kuwaiti
delegation.
   The hijackers asked Sunday for a special meal before the
beginning of Ramadan. The Algerians delivered Souhour, the
traditional meal of fermented cheese and dates.
   In Kuwait, the emir and the crown prince canceled traditional
receptions marking Islam's holiest month out of respect for the
hostages, newspapers reported.
   And leading members of Kuwaits' minority Shiite sect denounced
the ongoing hijack as anti-Islamic.
   The public denunciation appeared to be an effort to defuse
potential strains in relations between Shiites and the majority
Sunni Moslem community.

<DATELINE>HIALEAH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A trapeze artist fell to her death Sunday,
hitting the floor of a circus tent headfirst before about 900
horrified spectators, police said.
   Belinda Amandis, 31, of Sarasota was performing alone without a
net about 17 feet above center ring of Circus USA when she missed a
maneuver, said police and circus owner David Mobbs.
   While swinging back and forth balancing on her back, she
attempted to drop upside down and catch the bar with her knees,
Mobbs said. Performing without using her hands, she missed the bar
and fell.
   ``She fell forward and she was trying to right herself up, and
by doing that she fell right on the side of her face. She wasn't
that high up. She just hit the wrong way,'' said Tom Koenig, 40, of
Hialeah, who was at the show with his two children.
   His wife, Annie Koenig, said, ``At the second she fell,
everybody was silent. Everybody thought it was part of the act.
Then we realized what had happened.''
   Spectator Carol Johnson of Coral Gables said, ``I saw it when it
happened. I just turned my head and said, `Oh my God. She fell.'''
   ``The crew wanted to go on with the show in her memory,'' Mobbs
said, but the performance was immediately ended because police
evacuated the audience. Ms. Amandis was the first act after an
intermission.
   Mobbs described the solo trapeze act as perhaps the hardest in
the circus because there is no one else to rely on.
   ``She was one of the best in the business. She preferred not to
work with a net. She felt it limited her,'' he said.
   Ringmaster Roy Houston said, ``I watched the whole thing. I've
seen a lot of them in this business. It's part of the risk that you
take.''
   Ms. Amandis, a native of Denmark, had performed with several
circuses and was respected as one of the world's best trapeze
artist, Mobbs said.
   Belinda Amandis was the performer's stage name, police Sgt.
Jorge Hierro said, and she also was known as Belinda Nielsen
Visingard.
   The Miami-based circus had erected its big top across from the
Miami Springs River City festival. Mobbs said he assembles the
circus two or three times a year for shows in the area.

   A Continental Airlines Boeing 737 made an
emergency landing at Cleveland Hopkins International Airport after
smoke was detected in the cabin Sunday evening.
   Continental Airlines spokesman Bruce Hicks said Flight 159 was
bound for Cleveland from Newark, N.J., when smoke was detected
during the final minutes of the flight. The smoke was believed to
be coming from an item of carry-on luggage, but investigators were
unsure of the cause, Hicks said.
   The plane's 103 passengers were forced to use emergency slides
to evacuate the plane, Hicks said.
   One woman who suffered an asthma attack during the flight was
treated and released at Fairview General Hospital, hospital
spokesman Mike Plocica said.

<HEAD>Five Inmates Escape During Prison Guard Strike</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police on Sunday searched for five men
who escaped from Cork jail during a nationwide strike by Ireland's
1,900 guards, and disturbances were reported at two Dublin prisons.
   A former Irish Republican Army guerrilla sentenced to 40 years
in prison last week reportedly was involved in one of the
disturbances.
   Five inmates fled Saturday night near the end of a recreation
period at the strikebound Cork jail, police said. Three other
prisoners who escaped at the same time were recaptured within
minutes, they said.
   In Dublin's St. Patrick's Institution for young offenders,
police scuffled with eight prisoners who barricaded themselves
inside their cells Saturday, police said.
   Also Saturday, former IRA guerrilla Dessie O'Hare was among
prisoners who helped smash up cells in the high-security Portlaoise
prison, 47 miles southwest of Dublin, police said. Portlaoise holds
about 130 Irish nationalist guerrillas.
   O'Hare, 29, was sentenced to prison Wednesday for kidnapping a
wealthy Dublin dentist. He is a former member of the IRA and Irish
National Liberation Army. Both predominately Roman Catholic groups
have disowned him as a liability in their fight to rid
Protestant-dominated Northern Ireland of British rule.
   The government has been using about 1,000 police officers and
300 soldiers to staff the nation's prisons, which hold about 2,000
inmates. The walkout that began Saturday is the first nationwide
strike by guards in the nation's history.
   The guards' union, the Irish Prison Officers' Association, said
the strike is a protest against the Department of Justice's
decision to impose new shift arrangements without consulting the
guards.

   A bomb exploded in front of the
Frankfurt Jewish Community Center shortly after midnight Sunday,
and minutes later another blast ripped through the downtown office
of Saudi Arabia's Saudia Airlines, police said.
   There were no casualties in either explosion, but the airline
office was heavily damaged and a Volkswagen bus parked in front of
the Jewish Community Center was destroyed, police said.
   Police spokesman Hans Neitzel told The Associated Press there
were no immediate claims of responsibility.
   ``It's a mess inside the (Saudia) airline office,'' said another
police spokesman, adding that the adjacent offices for Air Canada
also were damaged.
   The blasts blew out windows at both locations, about a mile
apart, Neitzel said.
   He said a caretaker was inside the community center at the time
of the blast but was not injured. No one was inside the airline
office when the explosion occurred there, he said.
   Witnesses said the blast in front of the community center blew a
hole about 1 yard in diameter in the pavement.
   Neitzel said the Volkswagen bus that was destroyed belonged to
the community center and that the bomb was apparently thrown in
front of it.
   The first explosion occurred at two minutes after midnight, and
the second came about 10 minutes later, Neitzel said.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The body of a newborn girl was found in the
toilet of a state psychiatric hospital after the baby's mother, a
patient, gave birth unattended, authorities say.
   The Cook County medical examiner's office, local and state
police are investigating the incident to determine whether the
child was stillborn or died after birth.
   Mental health groups, meanwhile, questioned how a woman could
give birth unnoticed in a crowded hospital ward.
   Staff at Chicago-Read Mental Health Center checked the mother 15
minutes before the baby's body was found last Tuesday night and
found no indication that she was in labor, said David Devane, a
spokesman for the state Department of Mental Health.
   The baby's body was discovered after the mother appeared with
her legs covered with blood, and workers followed a bloody trail to
a communal bathroom, Devane said Saturday.
   No charges have been filed against the mother, Patricia Ales,
34, who was pregnant when admitted to the hospital in October,
authorities say. Hospital officials declined to discuss Ms. Ales'
mental condition.
   ``I find it incredible that this could happen and nobody knew
she was was in labor,'' said Jan Holcomb, former president of the
Mental Health Association in Illinois.
   ``Does it take the death of a newborn baby to recognize that our
underfunded and understaffed state mental health facilities can
pose a threat to the health and safety of our most vulnerable
citizens?'' she asked.
   Devane said state laws require the department to serve patients
in the ``least restrictive'' environment possible. There was no
indication, he said, that Ms. Ales might harm herself or the child.
   Devane said the general psychiatric ward on which Ms. Ales was a
patient had 24 patients and four staff members.

<HEAD>Slain Senator Was On Terrorists' List, Reports Say</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The name of a senator shot to death in northern
Italy was included on an assassination list found in hideouts of
the Red Brigades terrorist organization, an official was quoted as
saying Sunday.
   Sen. Roberto Ruffilli was killed Saturday at his apartment in
the town of Forli. He had been shot twice in the back of the neck,
an autopsy showed.
   Ruffilli, 51, a Christian Democrat, was a close friend and
adviser of Premier Ciriaco De Mita and had been developing a plan
to improve Italy's slow-moving bureacracy.
   Rosario Priore, an investigating magistrate, told RAI state
television that Ruffilli's name appeared on a list of possible
targets found in Red Brigades hideouts in past months.
   An anonymous caller to the Bologna office of the Rome newspaper
La Republica on Saturday asserted responsibility for the killing on
behalf of the Red Brigades.
   A spokesman for the Interior Ministry quoted the caller as
saying, ``We have killed Sen. Ruffilli, attacking at the heart of
the state. Red Brigades for the Formation of the Fighting Communist
Party.''
   The Fighting Communist Party is a faction of the Red Brigades.
   De Mita presided at an emergency meeting Sunday that included
the interior minister and police officials, but few developments in
the case were reported.
   At De Mita's urging, Ruffilli had been developing the Christian
Democrats' plan to reform Italy's cumbersome bureaucracy and
lawmaking process.
   Priore said one of the Fighting Communist Party's goals,
according to seized documents, was to thwart the process to reform
Italy's institutions. One of their biggest fears ``was new
legislation that would make the state more efficient,'' Priore said.
   Ruffilli's killing came exactly 40 years after a national
election that ended the communists participation in government.
   A Vatican official said Pope John Paul II telephoned De Mita to
express his sorrow about Ruffilli's death, saying ``the Italian
nation is threatened, but we hope and pray.''
   Meanwhile, an anti-terrorist investigator, speaking on condition
of anonymity, raised the possibility that the killing was linked to
the car bombing Thursday outside a Naples U.S.O. club in which an
American Navy servicewoman and four Italians were killed.
   The investigator said the killing of Ruffilli might have been
timed to divert attention of security forces looking for Junzo
Okudaira, a Japanese Red Army terrorist suspected in the Naples
bombing.
   The investigator noted that terrorists of the Japanese Red Army
and the Italian Red Brigades have trained together in Lebanon and
have links to Middle East terrorists.

   The timing of the Iran-Contra criminal trial

pardon _ if Reagan should decide to take that course _ would be
more acceptable to Americans.
   Some of the university professors and senators interviewed by

acceptable. This way, the prosecution would not get a chance to

   It may sound like a childhood nightmare
come true: People buying specially wrapped gift boxes of onions.
   But this is the age of the designer onion, and industry
officials say the lower Rio Grande Valley's grapefruit-size variety
known as the Texas 1015 SuperSweet has onion enthusiasts crying for
more.
   At least eight packers are shipping gift boxes from the Valley
at prices amounting to a dollar or more per onion.
   ``They'll put them in there with some of this Easter-type grass
and ship them UPS (United Parcel Service),'' said Dr. Leonard Pike,
a Texas A&M University horticultural scientist who developed the
1015.
   Since 1974, Valley growers have helped fund $1 million in
research grants for the continuing project that Pike leads in the
quest for a sweeter, milder onion.
   He released his round, yellow Texas Grano 1015 _ named for the
optimum planting date of Oct. 15 _ in 1983, providing increasing
competition for sweet onions such as the sweet Vidalia from
Georgia, Hawaii's Maui Maui and California's Imperial Valley.
``Grano'' in the 1015's name means it is a round variety, as
opposed to flatter, ``Granex'' onions.
   ``It's helped us because it's got a lot more people eating
onions that didn't eat them before,'' Dale DeBerry, owner of
Progreso Produce Co., said of the trend. ``You can see that by the
number of tourists who come by here asking for 1015s.''
   The sweet spring onions are available only for a six-week period
beginning in mid-April. DeBerry's company and others have started
labeling the 1015s with individual stickers to help consumers who
ask for them by name.
   ``Right now there's a national obsession for sweet onions, and I
know that sounds strange,'' said Paula Fouchek, executive director
of the Harlingen-based Texas Fresh Promotional Board, which is
waging an aggressive national marketing campaign for the state's
designer onions.
   ``There's a lot of people who are really fanatical about them,''
she said.
   About 80 percent of Texas' onion crop is the sweet spring
variety, said Erv Sandlin, a promotional marketing coordinator with
the Texas Department of Agriculture.
   Texas onion growers got $77.8 million for their crop last year,
making it the top moneymaker among fresh vegetables, said Doug
Bierstedt, with the Texas Agricultural Statistics Service.
   Statewide onion acreage this year is nearly 19,000 acres, of
which 14,000 is for the spring crop, Bierstedt said. About 3,500
Texas acres are planted in the 1015.
   Texas' niche in the national market is that its South Texas
spring crop hits the market early, growers say. Until the spring
onions hit the market, consumers are eating the more pungent winter
storage variety grown in many states.
   ``We come off at a time of a year when the old onions are about
gone and spring begins,'' said Othal Brand Sr., whose McAllen-based
Griffin & Brand Inc. is the largest onion producer in Texas.
   On an early spring afternoon, Brand, who is mayor of McAllen,
tromped through a muddy field to show off some of his earliest crop.
   ``Isn't that beautiful?'' Brand asked after pulling two of the
bulbs up. ``The only thing prettier than that is money in the
bank.''
   Other Texas onions usually begin hitting the market before the
1015s are ready. The drawback from the spring crop grown in the
short days of winter is that they do not last long in storage,
growers say.
   Pike said he is working on ways to store the spring onions
longer. He also is researching the source of the 1015's mildness,
which he said stems mainly from a low level of pyruvic acid, which
reacts with sulfur compounds to produce some of the unsavory
qualities in a more typical onion.
   ``Very rarely will you get one (1015) that will bring tears to
your eyes,'' Pike said.
   The 1015 also causes fewer stomach and breath problems, said
Pike, who thinks that is why many people who do not eat onions will
eat the mild ones of the spring season.
   Most of the 1015s weigh more than a pound, and some have been
reported at three pounds, according to Pike.

<HEAD>Invesment Group Buying Out Yugo America-Founder Malcolm Bricklin</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JANET BRAUNSTEIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Malcolm Bricklin, whose failed 1970s sports car
venture preceded his introduction of the cut-priced Yugo to
America, is being bought out of his auto importing business, the
president of Bricklin's Global Motors Inc. has disclosed.
   Global Motors is the parent of Yugo America Inc., which
introduced the $3,900 Yugoslavian-built auto to the United States
in August 1985, and of Proton America Inc., which plans to import a
Malaysian-built car by year's end.
   An investor-management group headed by Mabon Nugent and Co., a
New York investment banker, agreed three weeks ago to give Global
Motors a cash infusion in exchange for Global stock and debt, said
William Prior, Global's president.
   The deal was to be announced publicly on Monday, and explanatory
letters were mailed to Yugo dealers late last week, Prior said in
an interview. The deal was expected to close within a week, he said.
   Bricklin, through Prior, declined comment.
   ``He just has other interests that he intends to pursue outside
the automobile business,'' Prior said Friday of Bricklin, adding he
didn't believe Bricklin was being squeezed out.
   Prior said the investor group will inject more than $40 million
into the company. Global will pay about $20 million for Bricklin
Industries' 60 percent to 70 percent stake in the business and will
inject at least that amount into the business itself.
   Bricklin also will sell the company his personal Global stake.
   Bricklin, who will remain a paid consultant to Global Motors,
introduced his gull-winged, acrylic-and-fiberglass bodied SV-1
sports car in 1974. But production never neared his 12,000-a-year
goal, and the company died in 1976.
   The little Yugo, marketed as basic, cheap transportation and
aimed at buyers who otherwise might buy used cars, sold so fast
after its U.S. introduction that dealers never had enough to fill
orders.
   But it soon came to be known as a shoddily built, poorly
designed vehicle. In the February 1986 Consumer Reports, the
Consumers Union commented: ``It is hard to recommend the Yugo at
any price. The Yugo scores below every other car we've tested in
recent years.''
   Two years later, Consumers Union's opinion hadn't improved
despite thousands of changes made to the car and a price increase
to $4,199.
   ``The Yugo is the cheapest car on the market. Unfortunately,
it's also one of the worst cars CU has ever tested. ...The money
saved in buying a Yugo may well be spent in maintaining it.''
   Bricklin, who at age 29 had introduced the Subaru to the United
States in 1968, said in early 1985 that by Yugo's second year in
the United States, he expected sales of 150,000. By its third year,
he planned to sell 250,000.
   But the Yugo's reputation was so poor and its competition in the
new, low-end market so tough that less than 50,000 were sold in
1987, its second full year of sales. First-quarter sales in 1988
fell 36 percent from a year earlier.
   Instead, the South Korean-made Hyundai Excel, the first of
several Yugo competitors who crowded into the cheap-car market, set
a first-year import sales record of 150,000 units in 1986.
   In January, Yugo America mounted an aggressive campaign
including a $48 million advertising budget and the introduction of
the Yugo GVX, with a stronger engine and suspension and more frills.
   It also provided a one-year, complete warranty that Prior
estimated will cost Yugo America $19 million annually. During the
first year, Yugo America pays for all maintenance and parts,
routine or not.
   In June, Prior said, Yugo America plans to introduce a Yugo
convertible, complete with a heated, glass rear window and other
amenities, in the $8,000 range. He hopes that as the cheapest
convertible in America, it will sell the way its older brother once
did.

<HEAD>State Reaches Settlement With Arthur Andersen</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state of Ohio has settled its $195 million
lawsuit against the auditor of bankrupt Home State Savings bank,
with the amount to be revealed in a court filing this week.
   Lawyers for the Ohio Department of Commerce in Columbus said
Friday they had reached an out-of-court settlement with Arthur
Anderson & Co. lawyers.
   Ohio Court of Claims Judge John Donnelly ordered both sides to
remain silent on the details of the settlement until it was filed
with Hamilton County Common Pleas Court Judge Richard Niehaus.
   David Phillips, former managing partner of Arthur Andersen in
Cincinnati, said the proposed settlement ``was substantially less
than the cost of the defense,'' but declined to give the amount.
   Connie Harris, head of the Ohio Department of Commerce and
former superintendent of the department's savings and loans
division, had sued Arthur Andersen to recover some of the $275
million in tax money used to protect depositors after Home State
collapsed in March 1985.
   The state claimed Andersen partly was responsible for the losses
because it was auditor of Home State, which had overinvested funds
in ESM Government Securities Inc. of Ft. Lauderdale, Fla., which
later collapsd.
   Andersen's audits did not find anything wrong with Home State's
finances or investments.
   Andersen maintained it had no way of knowing ESM was a
fraudulent operation that had provided Home State and its auditors
with phony financial statements. The company also said state
officials did not adequately regulate Home State and did not act on
warnings about the ESM investments.
   The proposed settlement, reached Friday in Columbus, must be
approved by Niehaus, who is Home State's liquidator.
   The settlement ended the second of the state's three major Home
State-related claims, said Fred Alverson, a Commerce Department
spokesman. The state already has negotiated a $70 million
settlement with Grant-Thornton, formerly known as Alexander Grant,
which was ESM's accounting firm.
   A civil suit is pending against former Home State owner Marvin
Warner, who is appealing his conviction on criminal charges
stemming from the thrift's failure.
   Niehaus has ordered Warner to pay $22 million in restitution to
the state as part of his criminal sentence.

   A new survey shows the newspaper industry is
falling far short of its goal of making minority employment in the
newsroom equal to the percentage of minorities in the country by
the end of the century.
   The study by the American Society of Newspaper Editors indicates
a slow growth in minority newspaper employees in the past decade.
The percentage of blacks, Hispanics, Asians and American Indians in
the newsroom is 7.02 percent this year, the survey found, up from
6.56 percent in 1987 and 3.95 percent in 1978, the first year the
survey was done.
   But, Arnold Rosenfeld, editor of the Austin (Texas)
American-Statesman and chairman of the ASNE's minorities committee,
said last week, ``Such continued improvement is still not enough to
meet the ASNE goal.''
   The minority population in the United States in the year 2000 is
expected to be at least 25 percent. Minorities made up about 20
percent of the population in the 1980 census.
   In a report to the ASNE convention, Rosenfeld said the survey
also found that whites still dominate supervisory positions at
newspapers, with 95.9 percent of supervisors white and 4.1 percent
minorities. Down the ladder, 93.4 percent of copy editors, 92
percent of reporters and 90.7 percent of photographers are white.
   The ASNE study also showed that the majority of U.S. daily
newspapers still have no minority professionals on their staffs,
with minority hiring slowest at papers with circulations under
25,000.
   ``Obviously,'' Rosenfeld said, ``much needs to be done.''
   Katherine Fanning, editor of the Christian Science Monitor and
former president of the ASNE, singled out the poor minority-hiring
record of small newspapers in a speech to the ASNE convention.
   ``This is deplorable,'' she said, ``And it is a weakness which
must be corrected if we are to serve this country as we should.''
   The survey's findings also drew criticism from the president of
the National Association of Black Journalists, a 1,000-member group
based in Reston, Va.
   ``It's clear to me that whatever they are doing, they're not
getting the results we so desperately want,'' said DeWayne Wickham,
president of the black journalists group and a columnist for
Gannett News Service.
   ``The media plays a vital role in society. We shape what people
know about our society,'' Wickham added. ``And if the media is
manned by white men, then the perceptions the public gets will be
filtered through those people.''
   The ASNE survey is considered the most reliable measure of
minority employment at daily newspapers. This year's figures were
based on responses from 1,092 newspapers, representing 67 percent
of the 1,630 dailies in the country. The responses were projected
to the industry as a whole. The group said it did a follow-up study
of non-respondents two years ago and found that the projections
were accurate within three-tenths of a percentage point.
   The ASNE began surveying minority employment in 1978. That was
also the year the group adopted the goal of making the percentage
of minorities in the newsroom equal to the percentage of minorities
in the nation by the year 2000.
   Rosenfeld told the convention that the number of minority
employees is not the only measure of a newspaper's commitment to
minorities.
   ``The industry needs to remind itself that this is an issue that
goes beyond head count. You have to consider your coverage. ... You
have to find a way of making minorities part of the content-making
decisions,'' he said.

   Chrysler Corp. and the United Auto Workers union
on Monday open early national contract negotiations aimed at
healing their recently-bruised relationship and adopting
innovations to make Chrysler more competitive.
   Negotiators led by Chrysler Vice President Anthony St. John and
UAW Vice President Marc Stepp are attempting to reach a pact to
cover 59,500 active and 8,000 laid-off Chrysler workers whose labor
contract expires Sept. 14
   The UAW is seeking a two-year duration for the new contract so
it will expire with the GM and Ford pacts in 1990.
   The two sides will work within a pattern contract established
last fall with Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Corp. The
groundbreaking agreements forbid plant closings not announced
before labor contract talks begin and prevents layoffs except
during production slowdowns caused by poor sales.
   They also feature six-month joint management-labor studies at
each plant to find ways to improve productivity and efficiency,
including adoption of so-called team concept worker organization.
   Harley Shaiken, a labor and technology expert at the University
of California at San Diego, said Chrysler is counting on such
studies to pave the way for company-wide adoption of the so-called
Modern Operating Agreements already in effect at six plants.
   At plants with MOAs, management and labor share all decisions
and design the jobs so they can be performed by a team of workers.
Each team member learns all tasks involved in the team's assignment.
   Workers can increase their wages by learning additional jobs,
while the cross-training cuts down absenteeism costs because fewer
stand-by workers are needed. Teams also inspect their own work,
reducing the need for inspectors and for workers who repair the
mistakes of others.
   Some workers and local union leaders steadfastly have resisted
adopting MOAs. Most of the six local unions that adopted them were
threatened with a plant closing and, in some cases, promised a new
plant and more work.
   Some have resisted successfully. In Belvidere, Ill., local union
leaders refused to accept an MOA despite Chrysler's threat to close
the plant, agreeing only to give more flexibility in use of
workers. Chrysler in turn put its new Dodge Dynasty and Chrysler
Fifth Avenue front-wheel-drive luxury cars in the plant.
   ``What Chrysler wants to create is an atmosphere where the MOAs
will be more readily accepted and you can do that at the national
table,'' Shaiken said in an interview Sunday.
   But, he said, ``it's going to be difficult in the wake of the
attempted Acustar sale and the Kenosha closing. Chrysler's key
challenge will be trying to get the national contract out of the
way so it can concentrate on the local agreements.''
   Chrysler's attempt to sell its Acustar Inc. parts subsidiary
sparked a bitter, company-wide union backlash that forced it to
back down in early March and led to the decision to begin early
contract talks.
   Workers' relationship with the company also suffered from the
automaker's decision to close an assembly plant in Kenosha, Wis.,
by year's end, idling 5,500 workers instead of keeping them working
at least five more years as originally planned.
   The two sides will be working without a strike deadline but hope
to conclude in June.
