   Share prices dipped on the Tokyo Stock Exchange on
Saturday, and dealers said investors were worried about market
uncertainties.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues lost 62.85
points, or 0.23 percent, during the half-day session, closing the
week at 27,338.57.
   Traders linked the decline to the yen's rise overnight on
overseas currency markets.
   ``The appreciation of the yen is making investors wary about the
future of the market,'' said a broker at a major securities firm,
speaking on condition of anonymity. ``Most electronic shares and
other export-oriented shares were lower today because of the strong
yen.''
   Steel and ship-building industry shares, which led the market
during the week, moved lower because of heavy profit-taking,
traders said.
   Volume traded on the exchange's first section, where most major
shares are listed, was a moderate 450 million shares.
   Stock prices were volatile during the week because of mixed
incentives in the market, while volume showed signs of recovering
from a month-long slump. The Nikkei index rose on four days and
declined on two days during the week, and ended the six days with a
32-point gain.
   Gains on the New York Stock Exchange, where the Dow-Jones
industrial average reached a post-crash high and the untroubled
passage of the first anniversary of the worldwide stock market
crash encouraged investors, analysts said.
   But the continuing illness of Emperor Hirohito and the rapid
upsurge of the yen against the dollar dragged share prices down,
they said. Analysts also said uncertainty over oil prices was a
discouraging factor in the market.
   The Tokyo Stock Exchange is open for a half-day session on
Saturdays except for the second and third Saturdays of each month,
but the Tokyo currency market is closed on weekends.

   The 100th Congress paused in its rush to
adjourn late Friday to honor asparagus.
   The House floor erupted in laughter at about 11:30 p.m. when the
clerk read a bill naming May 1989 as National Asparagus Month. The
Senate had quietly passed its version of the bill earlier in the
evening.
   As the laughter died down, Rep. Robert Walker, R-Pa., briefly
objected to passage until he assured himself that he had heard the
clerk correctly.
   With a grin, he withdrew his objection and the bill was passed.
It goes to the White House for President Reagan's signature.

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Centrists run the national
administration and rightists dominate the legislature, but the
radical left has gained control of El Salvador's leading university
during nine years of civil war.
   Portraits of Che Guevara and Farabundo Marti, the revolutionist
for whom the Marxist-led guerrilla army is named, gaze from campus
walls at students moving between classes at the University of El
Salvador.
   ``Long live the people up in arms!'' is written across the
School of Humanities facade. Leftist folk songs boom over the
public address system.
   Conservative groups in El Salvador, a nation of 5.5 million
paople about the size of Massachusetts, say the 35,000-member
student body has become a fifth column of subversives.
   Some students, teachers and alumni contend, however, that
radical student unions do not represent the majority.
   Like nearly all national universities in Latin America, El
Salvador's is financed by the state but remains autonomous. The
government has virtually nothing to do with its administration.
   Police and soldiers are forbidden by law from entering the
grounds, but that did not prevent a military-dominated regime from
invading the school in 1980 and shutting it down for four years.
   When President Jose Napoleon Duarte, a Christian Democrat,
visited the campus last year to inspect damage done by a severe
earthquake, catcalls and shouted insults drowned out his attempts
to speak.
   ``If we examine the institutions that identify with the needs
and aspirations of the Salvadoran people, we find they are all
politicized because we are in the middle of a war,'' said Luis
Argueta Antillon, a leftist economist who is the university's
rector.
   ``These institutions cannot withdraw themselves from that war.
No one can remain neutral,'' he told an interviewer in his office.
   A conservative alumni group alleged in paid announcements
published last month that ``the standard bearers of terrorism'' had
taken over the student body with the object of ``fomenting social
disorder.''
   Student unions use demonstrations for increased government
spending on education as a pretext for ``acts of terrorism'' in the
streets, the ads said.
   Among about 3,000 students in a march for more funds Sept. 13
were 200 with bandannas over their faces, carrying iron staves or
nail-studded wooden clubs. The military says some masked marchers
are guerrilla ``urban commandos.''
   That march ended in a melee of tear gas and flailing clubs when
300 riot troopers moved in on the demonstrators. The driver of a
police truck was killed, allegedly shot by a marcher.
   About 250 people were arrested and 14 charged with subversive
affiliation. All eventually were released for lack of evidence.
   Argueta said security forces frustrated at release by the courts
of people they consider subversive might resort to kidnapping and
murder to quell student action.
   Two young men carrying books entered a university cafeteria Oct.
3, walked up to custodian Raul Escamilla, drew pistols and shot him
to death. A university statement called the killing ``part of a
government and military campaign against the university.''
   Escamilla, 34, was arrested by the National Police and held for
several days last year on suspicion of affiliation with the
Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front.
   Eli Ruiz, a journalism professor, worries about the effect of
radical activism on academic standards.
   ``The effort to keep classes from politicizing is constant,''
Ruiz said, and he tries to teach according to ``scientific''
criteria, ``but because of the context of conflict that is very
difficult.''
   The rector, Arqueta, contends ``We cannot think in terms of
academic level for its own sake.''
   He said medical school graduates had enjoyed success in North
America and Europe, a testament to their training, ``but the fact
we turned out good doctors did not lower our infant mortality rate
or provide better conditions of public health or increase life
expectancy.''
   Argueta is presiding over a revision of the rules to require
that future graduates contribute 500 hours of ``social service'' in
their fields.
   Asked why no centrist or rightist student union had been formed,
he noted that 75 percent of students were from families of workers
or peasants while ``the expressions of the center and the right are
minority expressions.''
   ``Realizing they are in the minority, they don't want to get
into an open confrontation of ideas,'' he said of students from the
political center and right.
   One student, speaking privately, said conservatives on campus
are intimidated by the radical ``minority.''
   ``When they come into a lecture hall and announce that class is
suspended for a march or a sit-in, maybe three or four out of 80
take part in the activity,'' she said.
   Many conservative students express their opinions on lavatory
walls. A tour turned up condemnations of the guerrillas and leftist
student unions, generally unprintable, and ``Vivas'' for Ronald
Reagan and Roberto d'Aubuisson.
   D'Aubuisson leads the rightist Arena party, which won control of
the legislature this year, and is said to have headed rightist
death squads accused of killing thousands of alleged leftists in
the early 1980s.

<HEAD>Angolan War Takes Heavy Toll On Village Of Biongue</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BIONGUE, Angola (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Biongue looks like any other African bush
village at first: grass huts, cooking fires, children running
barefoot among squawking chickens.
   A second look reveals its ghastly harvest from 13 years of civil
war: crutches stacked near a mound of cornmeal, women with wooden
legs, the slow and awkward movements of the maimed.
   More than half the 3,500 residents have lost at least one arm or
leg. Most of the victims, 500 civilians and 1,300 former guerrilla
fighters, were wounded by mines.
   ``I stepped on a mine coming in from a field, after soldiers
raided our place two years ago and killed my husband,'' said Teresa
Felina, who lost both feet. It took her five months to reach
Biongue, in guerrilla territory of southeastern Angola, from her
home near Huambo in the central highlands.
   Her story is typical. Tens of thousands of Angolans are believed
to have been killed or wounded by anti-personnel mines, which are
buried in the sandy soil and are set off by a footstep.
   It has been a slow and cautious war since Angola's independence
from Portugal in 1975. Commanders on both sides are reluctant to
mount large assaults that might gain objectives quickly but would
cost many casualties.
   They capture, lose and recapture rivers, hills and towns. Both
sides plant huge numbers of mines, indiscriminate weapons that may
remain undetected for years until detonated by the random step of a
man, woman or child.
   An example is Cuito Cuanavale, a major battleground of the past
year.
   Guerrillas of the U.S.-supported National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola, UNITA, say army brigades supported by Cuban
troops mined the southern town heavily before retreating from it
early in 1988.
   Jonas Savimbi's UNITA forces were pushed out of Cuito later, but
the guerrillas claim the army cannot re-enter the town until it
conducts the difficult and dangerous operations of disarming the
mines.
   Biongue, visited during a tour of UNITA camps this month, is in
the southeastern corner of Angola an hour's drive from Jamba, the
guerrilla headquarters. It was built in 1983 and UNITA says it is
one of four rehabilitation established for people crippled in the
war.
   Men in a workshop chiseled artificial legs from blocks of wood
held by vises. Homemade wooden wheelchairs stood in a row outside.
   Physiotherapist Chantal Cluset, 23, of Montpellier, France,
worked nearby with several men who suffered paralysis, numbness and
blurred vision after a skirmish last year near Cuemba, on the
Benguela Railroad in central Angola.
   ``They say it happened after a chemical attack,'' she said. ``We
have no proof.''
   Ms. Cluset, who later left Angola, spent nine months with UNITA
on behalf of a French group called Handicap International.
   Lt. Sousa Chipeio, a guerrilla liaison officer, said the maimed
were trained in skills that could make them self-supporting. He
said they could function as teachers, nurses or clerical workers
but it would be difficult for them to continue as farmers.
   Jonatao Muco, 23, lost a leg while fighting near Canage in
eastern Angola last year. He sat on a log bench, his crutches
tucked under him, and said he was studying in the third grade of
primary school while waiting for a wooden leg.
   Col. Jaka Jamba, UNITA's education secretary, said at guerrilla
headquarters:
   ``We pay special attention to (getting) the wounded back into
normal life. While they need it, UNITA provides clothing and food.
There is a secondary school at Biongue and we plan a vocational
school. The aim is to get them into jobs.''

   Restricting news coverage is a favorite weapon of
governments battling those they regard as terrorists.
   Now Britain, with a ban on broadcast interviews of its foes in
Northern Ireland, has joined the list.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's government on Wednesday
slapped an immediate ban on broadcast interviews with 11
paramilitary and political groups involved in the Northern Ireland
conflict, including the outlawed Irish Republican Army.
   The ban raised criticism that it was similar to measures taken
in South Africa, but Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe dismissed
it.
   ``We must refute that argument as far as possible,'' he said
from Spain where he is accompanying Queen Elizabeth II on a state
visit. ``What we are doing against terrorism in our own society is
exactly the same as the government of Ireland has done.''
   British news organizations and civil rights groups also cried
censorship, but the government said it had to act to curb a recent
surge in IRA violence.
   The British Broadcasting Corp. called it a ``damaging
precedent'' and the National Union of Journalists said ``step by
step the freedom of broadcasting is being removed.''
   A statement by the International Press Institute said the ban is
``a serious erosion of the basic freedom of the media to gather and
present news and information from every source and people's freedom
and right to judge for themselves.'' The institute is based in
London and claims a membership of 2,000 journalists.
   The ban is similar to one imposed on the Irish state
broadcasting system 15 years ago to combat the mainly Roman
Catholic IRA, which is fighting to end British rule in the
predominantly Protestant Northern Ireland.
   But it still allows broadcasters to paraphrase statements over
film of the speaker, and does not affect newspapers or foreign
broadcasters, so its net is not as wide as some cast elsewhere.
   South Africa, for example, prohibits broadcasters and newspapers
from quoting scores of opposition figures, and Israel prohibits not
only news media interviews but any contact by Israelis with the
Palestine Liberation Organization.
   The South African ban applies not only to leaders of the
outlawed African National Congress guerrilla movement, but also
many officials of groups committed to non-violence. A June 1986
state-of-emergency declaration also restricts reporting about
unrest, security force action and various ``subversive'' statements.
   Enforcement of the regulations has been haphazard, and neither
local nor foreign journalists observe them rigorously. Two
anti-apartheid newspapers were closed for three-month periods for
allegedly violating the regulations, and others have been warned.
But the newspapers have resumed publication and no individual
journalists have been prosecuted for violating the regulations.
   In Israel, a 1986 law bars citizens from meeting any members of
terrorist organizations. This effectively bans contacts with the
PLO, which Israel considers to be a terrorist group.
   In June, four Israelis became the first to be convicted and
sentenced under this law. They were each sentenced to six months in
prison and fined $2,500 for meeting PLO representatives in Romania
two years ago.
   Israel's state-owned television and radio do not permit
interviews with PLO leaders. This week, Israel's Central Elections
Committee censored an interview with PLO Chief Yasser Arafat from
an election campaign ad of a left-wing Jewish-Arab party called the
Progressive Movement for Peace.
   Under a 1983 law in Turkey, a newspaper editor and prominent
columnist went n trial last month for publishing a story based on
an interview with Abdullah Ocalan, leader of the illegal Kurdish
Labor Party. The party has been fighting government troops since
1984 to establish a Marxist state in parts of eastern and
southeastern Turkey.
   Istanbul Daily Milliyet's foreign correspondant Mehmet Ali
Birand and managing editor Eren Guvener were charged with
publishing material that weakened nationalist feelings and with
publishing the views of a criminal
   It was the first time Turkey's press laws had been used since
they were adopted by the former military regime.
   In Spain, the Basque separatist organization ETA, is proscribed,
and their most important leaders are either hiding in France or
underground in Spain.
   A 1984 law makes it an offense to support or praise the
activities of terrorists through the mass media, although the
courts have thrown out most cases brought by prosecutors. The
Basque newspaper, Egin, continues to print communiques from ETA,
and is in turn quoted by the Spanish national news agency Efe and
private and public broadcasters.
   In Portugal, a court in February acquitted four reporters for
the state-owned television network, Radio-Televisao Portuguesa, of
charges they ``alarmed and upset the public'' by broadcasting a
news conference given by hooded members of a leftist terrorist
group.
   The judge also acquitted the news team of ``personally
favoring'' the group known as the Popular Forces of April 25 _
named for the date of Portugal's 1974 leftist military coup _ by
broadcasting the movement's news conference.
   The judge ruled that the reporters had acted ``only and
exclusively with the aim of informing the public'' in the December
1985 broadcast, and said the television footage aided
identification of one of the hooded spokesman at a subsequent trail.
   Membership in a proscribed organization is a criminal offense in
Kenya, and such groups have no access to state-owned and controlled
radio and television.
   France has no ban on interviews with members of proscribed
organizations and occasionally there are broadcasts with members of
the outlawed Corsican National Liberation Front or Basque
separatists.
   West German officials oppose interviews with members of
organizations such as Red Army Faction, but members of such groups
have been interviewed during leaves from prison, for example.

   The war of words to make English the
official language in three states won't be settled until Election
Day, but it has already prompted lawsuits and the resignations of
key proponents, including Walter Cronkite.
   Arizona and Colorado voters will get to decide the issue Nov. 8.
It's also on the ballot in Florida but a lawsuit seeks to remove it
because petitions in the citizens' initiative weren't circulated in
Spanish in six of the state's 67 counties; a federal judge in Miami
has yet to rule on the suit.
   Fourteen states have passed laws designating English their
official language. Only California has a constitutional amendment,
approved in 1986. Arizona, Florida and Colorado also are
considering amendments, which would, if approved, be harder to
change or repeal than a law.
   Colorado's proposed Amendment 1 would ``declare that the English
language is the official language of the state of Colorado.''
   Arizona's Proposition 106 would require state and county
governments to conduct all business in English, with certain
exceptions in the areas of education, public health and safety, the
justice system and federal election law.
   Florida's Amendment 11 would designate English the state's
official language and give the Legislature authority to pass laws
enforcing that status.
   Both sides say the stakes are especially high in Florida.
   ``We want to turn the heat on this one and try to slow it
down,'' said Jeff Browne, statewide coordinator of Speak Up Now For
Florida, which opposes the amendment. ``If it passes in Florida, I
think it makes Texas, which is the next target state, more likely
to pass this type of law.''
   Browne contends that English is already the de facto official
language of both Florida and the country and that the proposed
amendment could threaten fundamental liberties.
   ``The framers of the (U.S.) Constitution had the opportunity to
declare an official language,'' Brown said. ``They chose not to.
They felt this was an area the government ought to stay out of. In
200 years, they were proved right.''
   Pat Fulton, a spokeswoman for Florida English, which supports
the amendment, agrees that Florida ``has become a bellwether
state.''
   Browne said he thinks Colorado and Arizona voters will pass the
measures, and conceded it will be hard to stop the Florida
amendment if it survives the court challenge.
   But both sides of the official English battle have suffered
setbacks this month.
   On Oct. 12, a federal appeals court cleared the way for the
Colorado measure to appear on November ballots, ruling against a
lawsuit which argued that the federal Voting Rights Act of 1965
required election material to be provided in Spanish in certain
areas of the state.
   The pending Florida suit, filed on behalf of four Dade County
Spanish-speaking residents, makes a similar argument.
   In an action growing out of the campaigns, former CBS anchorman
Cronkite resigned on Oct. 13 from the advisory board of U.S.
English, a group founded in 1983 by John Tanton and former Sen.
S.I. Hayakawa of California to promote a U.S. constitutional
amendment.
   Cronkite said he believed the Arizona proposal could hurt
minorities, though he said he remains opposed to bilingualism.
   On Monday, Linda Chavez, a former White House aide during the
Reagan administration, resigned as president of U.S. English,
citing a report that at least one major contributor to the group
has advocated forced sterilization. She did not elaborate.
   That same day, U.S. English co-founder Tanton resigned. Both
Cronkite and Ms. Chavez had expressed concern over a 1986 memo
Tanton wrote suggesting that too many recent immigrants have been
Roman Catholics and that Hispanics bring with them a trend toward
corruption.
   Ms. Chavez, who said she still supported the idea behind U.S.
English, told Tallahassee business leaders last month that there is
a difference in what's being expected of new immigrants.
   ``Only in the last 20 years or so have we seen a dramatic shift
in terms of the attitude about that integration,'' she said, citing
the expansion of bilingual education from a $7.5 million program in
1968 to $750 million now.

<TEXT>
   The exclusion of religion from public school
curricula is hurting the education of America's children, according
to a group promoting instruction about religion without advocacy of
any particular faith.
   ``For far too long, we've had a remarkable silence on teaching
about religion in the nation's public schools,'' Ernest L. Boyer of
the Williamsburg Charter Foundation school curriculum project said
Thursday.
   The foundation is a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization that
seeks to foster public awareness about the First Amendment
religious liberty clauses in the Constitution and reaffirm freedom
for ``people of all faiths or none'' in America.
   ``The failure to include systematically the study of religion in
the school curriculum has reduced the quality of the education we
are providing to our children,'' said Boyer.
   Boyer, former U.S. Commissioner of Education from 1977 to 1979,
said students cannot know the history of music, art or literature
``without understanding the intensity of religious faith throughout
all of history.''
   The silence often stems from a fear of violating Supreme Court
rulings against state-sponsored school prayer and Bible reading,
said Boyer, who is president of the Carnegie Foundation for the
Advancement of Teaching.
   Henry C. Johnson Jr. of Pennsylvania State University, who will
oversee production of materials for a five-lesson program targeted
at fifth, eighth and eleventh graders, said the goal is not to
advocate any particular faith.
   But he said an understanding of the place of religion in history
is essential for students to understand historical developments.
   ``How will they understand how the average 19th century European
thought about the Catholic church unless you tell them about the
religion? Religious information and study is different from
instruction in religious values,'' he said.
   In addition to a teachers' manual, the group plans to produce
historical and contemporary documentaries, videotapes and materials
for art, literature and drama instruction.
   Johnson said the program, which is being developed by a national
board of educators and evaluated by a cross-section of religious
leaders, will be published next spring. Pilot projects for the
course are scheduled to begin in the 1989-90 school year in several
states.

   Military President Augusto Pinochet
changed half of his Cabinet and flatly ruled out an early departure
from power, rejecting a demand by the opposition parties that
defeated him in the Oct. 5 referendum.
   Speaking at a ceremony in which he swore in the new ministers
Friday, Pinochet also, for the first time, appeared to rule out his
candidacy in a competitive presidential election next year.
   ``I will hand over my post to the person that citizens elect
freely, secretly and in an informed fashion on Dec. 14, 1989,'' the
election date, the 72-year-old president and army commander said.
   Although most legal experts say the constitution bars him from
running in the election and succeeding himself, there has been open
speculation, including by high-ranking government officials, that
he might seek a legal loophole.
   The constitution calls for his term to end in March 1990, when
he will be succeeded by the winner of the December 1989 election.
   Pinochet brought in eight new ministers, all civilians, to his
16-man Cabinet, and shifted one to a different ministry. He kept
seven others, including some military officers.
   In the most most important change, he named Carlos Caceres, a
48-year-old U.S.-educated economist, to replace Sergio Fernandez as
interior minister, by far the most potentially politically powerful
post in the Cabinet.
   The opposition and even some pro-government politicians had
called for the removal of Fernandez, who had firmly rejected
opposition demands for negotiations on democratic reforms of the
8-year-old constitution drawn up under Pinochet.
   In his speech, Pinochet flatly rejected the opposition demands,
saying: ``Sirs, the constitution will not be modified. This issue
is not at stake.''
   The opposition claims its victory in the referendum, in which
Pinochet sought to extend his rule until 1997, showed that voters
want to speed up transition to democracy and the president's
departure from power.
   In the referendum, a simple yes or no ballot, 3.9 million people
voted against Pinochet's continued rule and 3.1 million voted in
favor. Pinochet took power in a 1973 coup that deposed the elected
government of Salvador Allende, a Marxist who died in the coup.
   Opposition leaders seemed unworried by Pinochet's firm rejection
of their demands.
   Jorge Burgos, assistant secretary-general of the Christian
Democratic Party, the country's largest, said of Pinochet's speech:
``Sometimes words can be changed by deeds.''
   Caceres did not rule out a dialogue with the opposition. ``Let
me analyze, think about and study this issue, and then we'll
talk,'' he told reporters.
   Should the government finally agree to negotiating with the
opposition, Caceres would the key man in the talks.
   Caceres, a technocrat who served briefly as finance minister in
the early 1980s, is widely considered more moderate than his
predecessor, Fernandez. He is also considered to be especially
close to Pinochet. He handled the finances of the president's
campaign in the referendum.
   In other important Cabinet changes, Pinochet brought his
ambassador to Washington, Hernan Felipe Errazuriz, 43, to replace
Ricardo Garcia as foreign minister. Miguel Angel Poduje was moved
from the housing ministry to replace Orlando Poblete as government
secretary-general, a key post roughly equivalent to a chief of
staff.
   Pinochet kept finance minister Hernan Buchi, 39, a Columbia
University-graduated engineer, who is widely credited with the
successful performance of the economy in recent years.
   Also confirmed in their posts were Patricio Carvajal, as defense
minister; army Gen. Manuel Concha, economy; Juan Antonio Guzman,
education; Hugo Rosende, justice; army Gen. Bruno Siebert, public
works; and Juan Giaconi, health.
   Other new ministers are Jaime de la Sota, agriculture; Armando
Alvarez, national property; Guillermo Arthur, labor; Pablo
Barahona, mining; Gustavo Montero, housing; Carlos Silva,
transportation.

<HEAD>Senate Approves Bill Providing Up To $1.3 Billion for Homeless</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE GOULD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Legislation providing up to $1.3 billion in
assistance to the nation's homeless is now on President Reagan's
desk, awaiting his decision on whether to sign it into law.
   The bill was sent to Reagan following a voice vote in the Senate
on Thursday. Both presidential candidates, Republican George Bush
and Democrat Michael Dukakis, have praised the legislation, with
Dukakis calling for increased spending.
   The bill allows the federal government to provide money to
states, municipalities and private agencies for rental assistance,
health care, mental health services, alcohol and drug abuse
programs, education and job training projects.
   Money also would be available for the purchase and
rehabilitation of group homes. In addition, unused space at
Veterans Administration hospitals would be set aside for the
treatment of homeless veterans.
   The legislation authorizes spending of $633.8 million for fiscal
1989, which began Oct. 1, and $682.8 million in fiscal 1990.
However, Congress has only appropriated $378 million for this
fiscal year and $360.5 million in fiscal 1990.
   Democrats praised the bill but urged Congress to spend more of
the money the bill authorizes.
   Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., chairman of the Senate housing
subcommittee, said passage of the bill ``demonstrates that while
progress has been made on housing issues, we still have a long way
to go.''
   ``While the bill addresses the housing, health and mental health
needs of homeless persons, the only true solution will come with a
national affordable housing act,'' Cranston said.
   ``It is encouraging that this homeless legislation enjoys such
broad support,'' said Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., chairman of
the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee. ``Perhaps with such
broadbased support, we will be able to secure the appropriations
needed to fully fund this legislation in the coming years.''
   Advocates for the nation's homeless population _ estimated at
between 250,000 and 3 million people _ have complained that
Congress has yet to provide all of the money authorized in the bill.
   The measure is named for the late Rep. Stewart B. McKinney,
R-Conn., one of its original sponsors, who died in May 1987, less
than three months after the legislation became law.

<HEAD>Farm Income Forecast Holds Despite Drought</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Agriculture Department economists are sticking
to their guns that farmers' net cash income this year, despite
crop-gobbling drought, could match or exceed last year's record of
$57.1 billion nationally.
   The latest forecast, released Thursday by the department's
Economic Research Service, is unchanged from one issued in
September.
   Economists said higher commodity prices, inventory drawdowns and
``only moderate decreases'' in government subsidies are the main
reasons for forecasting 1988 net cash income in a range of $55
billion to $60 billion.
   ``However, the fortunes of individual farmers have changed
sharply, some gaining from higher prices received and others losing
from heavy crop losses or higher feed costs,'' the agency said in
its new outlook report.
   Net cash income is the amount of money farmers have to spend
during the year and represents the difference between gross cash
income and cash expenses. For example, 1988 sales of grain stored
from harvests in earlier years are counted as part of the current
gross.
   Another method of USDA bookkeeping measures ``net farm income''
for the calendar year, not simply the cash-in, cash-out system
involved in ``net cash income.''
   In this method, changes in the value of farm inventories are
taken into consideration, and allowances are made for ``non-money''
items such as depreciation, the family consumption of farm-grown
food and the net rental value of dwellings.
   Net farm income in 1988 was forecast at $38 billion to $43
billion, also unchanged from the September report but down from
1987's record $46.3 billion.
   ``Production of red meat and poultry is setting a record this
year, helped by increased slaughter in response to higher feed
costs,'' the report said. ``Production is led by a 9 percent
increase in pork. Turkey, broilers and milk are up moderately; beef
and eggs are down.''
   In 1989, with breeding stock reduced and ``downward pressure on
producer returns,'' the output of red meat and poultry is expected
to decline about 1 percent from this year's record level.
   Crop production is down 18 percent this year, with most of the
decline coming in feed grains, which are down a third.
   ``One measure of the drought's impact is the severe drawdown of
U.S. grain and oilseed inventories,'' the report said. ``Despite
acreage and yield increases likely next year, most production for
1989-90 will be consumed directly in the U.S. and abroad, not put
into (storage) stocks.''

   Drought, parasites and the march of
Africanized ``killer'' bees have contributed to a drop in world
honey production, says the Agriculture Department.
   The department's Foreign Agricultural Service said in a report
on world trade that honey output in selected countries is forecast
at 709,500 metric tons in 1988, down 3 percent from a revised
production of 730,500 tons last year.
   U.S. honey output this year is forecast at about 85,000 tons,
down 17 percent from 1987 because of poor flowering cause by
drought.
   Canada's production is expected to drop 11 percent to 36,000
tons because of a Canadian ban on imports of U.S. bees because of
infestations of parasitic Varroa mites.
   ``The ban caused a decline in the number of colonies from
700,000 in 1987 to 620,000 in 1988,'' the report said. ``Western
Canada was affected the most by the ban.''
   Mexico's honey production was forecast at 44,000 tons, down 8
percent from last year because of dry conditions in the main
producing areas. Also, the report said, the decline can be
``partially attributed to the Africanization of some beehives in
southern Mexico.''
   The Africanized bees have been migrating northward for years
since some of the ferocious insects mingled with domestic breeds.
Beekeepers in the United States have been apprehensive about the
bees as they move north through Mexico.
   Elsewhere, the Soviet Union's honey production is expected to
total 192,000 tons, up slightly from last year. China's output, at
200,000 tons, is down 2 percent.

   A half-inch-long weevil from Argentina is the
Agriculture Department's answer to snakeweed, a poisonous weed that
has plagued livestock ranchers in the Southwest for generations.
   C. Jack DeLoach, an entomologist in the department's
Agricultural Research Service, said about 800 of the weevils have
been released experimentally in New Mexico and Texas.
   The insects were released this summer near Socorro and Las
Cruces, N.M., and Fort Stockton and Andrews, Texas. Some were
confined to net cages, while others were turned loose in the open.
   DeLoach, who works at the agency's laboratory in Temple, Texas,
said in a report released here that USDA scientists learned of the
weevils in the late 1970s. Several thousand were collected in
Argentina and tested on about 30 plants related to snakeweed. It
turned out that snakeweed was their favorite diet.
   The tests will require four or five years before there are
definite results, he said. The weevils are found naturally only in
Argentina and Paraguay.
   Snakeweed was an uncommon plant 150 years ago but has spread to
142 million acres in the western United States and causes an
estimated $70 million to $140 million in losses annually, mainly in
aborted calves, DeLoach said.

<HEAD>Chances of Tax Bill Passage Dimming As Congress Nears Adjournment</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Time is running out on a tax bill that has
been awaiting action for more than two years, as Congress inches
toward adjournment for the year.
   ``We'll need a miracle to pass a tax bill this year,'' said Sen.
Max Baucus, D-Mont., who has been managing the measure for the
Senate. ``However, it's never over until it's over,'' he added.
   Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas, another member of
the Senate team trying to negotiate a compromise with the House,
said there was less than a 50 percent chance of getting a bill. One
House aide, who would not be quoted by name, said there was only
one chance in 10.
   ``There's still a pulse but the odds are against resolution of
the impasse,'' said Rep. Bill Archer of Texas, chief Republican
negotiator for the House.
   After a week of deadlock, senior staff members from the tax
committees suggested a compromise with a three-year price tag of
about $4 billion. That is higher than senators had favored, but
less than backed by the House.
   Baucus ``calls this a serious proposal and one that the Senate
should consider seriously,'' said spokesman Bill Maddox.
   Congress hopes to adjourn tonight or Saturday. And many members
of Congress, including some who were named to negotiate a
compromise tax bill, already have left town.
   The tax bill originally was written in the fall of 1986,
immediately after Congress completed work on a thorough overhaul of
the income tax. The original purpose of the bill was to clean up
errors and clear up uncertainties in that huge bill.
   Efforts to pass it failed in 1986 and 1987. And as it awaited
final action, it picked up dozens of unrelated amendments, most of
which were designed to provide a targeted new tax benefit or extend
an old one, and to raise other taxes enough to finance those
benefits.
   The Senate attached to the package this year a ``taxpayer's bill
of rights'' designed to increase the clout of those who are audited
or face collections actions by the Internal Revenue Service. It
would, for example, require the IRS to inform a taxpayer fully of
his or her rights before any action is begun, and increase from 10
days to 30 days the minimum waiting period before the IRS can seize
property for back taxes.
   Major provisions of the deadlocked legislation would free
farmers from paying the federal fuel tax on diesel burned for
off-road purposes; allow certain livestock producers and freelance
artists to deduct some operating expenses before a project
generates income, and renew an exclusion for employer-financed
educational assistance.
   The version passed by the House would provide tax benefits worth
about $7.5 billion over three years and raise other taxes to pay
for those benefits. The Senate plan has a price tag of under $3
billion.
   The biggest point of contention between House and Senate
negotiators has been over the size of the compromise bill.
   The House insisted that the final version be closer to its
figure in order to finance longer extensions of certain expiring
provisions, such as a tax exemption for bonds issued to help
low-income families buy their first home.
   The Senate declined to go much beyond $3 billion for fear that
President Reagan would veto the bill as another exercise in raising
taxes to pay for more spending.
   Senators and the Reagan administration also object to two big
revenue-raisers in the House plan. One would cost defense
contractors and big construction companies about $2.4 billion by
repealing a special method of accounting. The other would reduce
the dividends-received deduction used by many big corporations;
that would cost those companies about $1.8 billion over three years.

<HEAD>Senate Approves Bills Giving Veterans New Rights and Benefits</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congress has given final approval to two more
bills providing new rights and benefits for veterans, sending the
measures to President Reagan for his expected approval.
   The bills grant veterans the right to have courts review denial
of benefit decisions and provide a series of cost-of-living
increases in a variety of VA payments.
   They were approved on a voice vote by the Senate on Thursday, a
day after similar action in the House.
   Earlier in the week, Congress sent Reagan another bill to
elevate the Veterans Administration to Cabinet status, making the
agency the 14th Cabinet department.
   The review bill allows veterans to have federal courts review VA
denials of benefits for the first time. It creates a new ``U.S.
Court of Veterans Appeals'' to replace the current Board of
Veterans' Appeals. That panel is part of the VA and is now the last
resort of veterans who are unhappy with decisions to reject their
claims.
   The benefits increase legislation provides that 2.2 million
veterans with service-connected disabilities and 310,000 widows and
orphans will receive the same 4.1 percent cost-of-living increases
paid to Social Security recipients.
   Dropped from the final bill was an amendment added earlier by
the Senate that would have provided interim health care payments to
some of the Vietnam veterans who were exposed to Agent Orange, a
highly toxic defoliant used by the United States in Southeast Asia.

   The Occupational Safety and Health
Administration blames a poorly designed, faulty dust-collecting
system for a fatal grain elevator explosion in Illinois.
   The agency recommended Thursday that ADM-Growmark Inc. be fined
$14,000 for willful and serious safety violations at its elevator
in Joliet, where an April 22 blast claimed five lives, injured
three people and leveled a half-dozen concrete grain silos.
   The company either knew or should have known about deficiencies
in the dust-collection system at the complex, said Ronald J.
McCann, director of OSHA's district office in Calumet City, Ill.
   He said the faults included improper or inadequate design, a
lack of explosion relief or venting, a lack of warning devices in
the event of a system failure and improper modifications.
   Officials of ADM-Growmark were attending a corporate board
meeting Thursday and could not be reached for comment about the
citations and fines, said a secretary for company spokesman Richard
Burket.
   Six concrete silos were leveled in back-to-back explosions at
the elevator complex, located about 40 miles southwest of Chicago,
and one of the structures crushed an adjacent one-story building.

<HEAD>Researchers Sue Zapruder's Son Over Copyright On JFK Assassination
Footage</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two researchers of the John F. Kennedy
assassination are urging a federal court to stop the son of the
late Abraham Zapruder from selling the right to show his father's
famous film footage of the slaying.
   A suit filed Thursday in U.S. District Court argues that Henry
G. Zapruder, a Washington tax lawyer, should not have a copyright
claim to the 8mm film that captured for history the shooting of
Kennedy 25 years ago next month in Dallas' Dealey Plaza.
   ``It's a historical event and it's far too important to American
history to allow its use to be dictated by a copyright owner who
has shown no sensitivity for its importance and for the uses which
scholars and writers want to make of it,'' said James H. Lesar, an
attorney and vice president of the Assassination Archives, a
private research group.
   Zapruder, reached by telephone late Thursday, declined to answer
specific questions about the suit, but said the family only charges
people who use the film for commercial purposes.
   ``We make the film available free of charge to anyone who is not
going to use it for commercial purposes, and we've been doing that
for years,'' he said. ``We do that because we think it's the right
thing to do. People who are going to charge, we charge.''
   The elder Zapruder, a dress manufacturer who died in 1970, had
sold the film to Life magazine for $150,000 shortly after the
assassination. Life featured dramatic frames from the footage in a
special issue following the slaying.
   In 1975, Time Inc. sold the film back to the Zapruder family for
$1.
   The original 8mm film is in storage at the National Archives,
but the Zapruder family retains exclusive rights to the film's use
and copies. Henry Zapruder, according to the suit, has been
charging up to $30,000 for the right to use the film footage.

<HEAD>Dukakis' TV Blitz: Can His Version Of A Made-For-TV Campaign Turn
The Tide?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With little more than two weeks to go in a
presidential campaign marked by a made-for-TV mentality, Michael
Dukakis is fighting back with a television blitz of his own, hoping
that a foray into America's living rooms will revive his candidacy.
   The Democratic nominee is making himself available to network
and major-market television outlets and also plans to buy TV time
for direct appeals to voters, a costly venture that is drawing
mixed reviews from political analysts.
   ``It may be too little too late, but it's certainly better than
doing nothing,'' said Mark Siegel, a Democratic consultant. ``There
is still a large segment of the population that is undecided and
another segment that is recently decided and could be persuaded to
change their mind. This election is not over.''
   Republicans, not surprisingly, disagree.
   ``My guess is that people are not going to sit down and watch
this stuff,'' said GOP consultant Eddie Mahe. ``They have made
their decision.''
   The Dukakis campaign, which is paying for some of the network
time, is counting on a large audience.
   ``The American people are looking for a candidate to break
across the soundbite barrier, to talk to them about what's at
stake,'' said Dukakis communications director Leslie Dach. ``That's
what we hope to do.''
   Dach refused to discuss how much Dukakis plans to spend on the
effort, which tentatively includes buying a half hour on each of
the broadcast networks on the eve of the election and several
shorter time slots beginning as early as this weekend. The campaign
also is considering less expensive purchases of television time in
major markets in target states.
   Still unresolved is whether Dukakis will take the high road in
the nationally televised addresses or lash out at Republican rival
George Bush. Campaign aides shy away from discussing that, except
to say Dukakis will attempt to show that he is on the side of
average Americans and Bush is not _ the central theme of the
Democrat's speeches this week.
   But it appears likely he will mix discussion of his proposals
with salvos directed at Bush, a strategy endorsed by Democrats and
Republicans alike.
   ``The first order of business has to be to get George Bush down
in the polls, and that means to me that he has only one
alternative, which is to launch some kind of attack,'' Mahe said.
   Added William Schneider of the American Enterprise Institute:
``One of the things he has to do is depict a vote for Bush as a
risk. I think there is a lot of potential for Bush's negatives to
go up if he addresses some of the risky factors associated with
voting for Bush.''
   Those factors, according to Schneider, include the vice
president's role in the Iran-Contra scandal, the Reagan
administration's anti-drug efforts and the selection of Indiana
Sen. Dan Quayle as his running mate.
   An aggressive Dukakis would please the many Democrats who blame
Bush's surge on the failure of Dukakis to respond forcefully to
Republican attacks.
   ``It's still a very winnable race for Dukakis,'' said New Jersey
Sen. Bill Bradley said Wednesday. ``But he needs to be more intense
and amplify his message.''
   Siegel and others also said Dukakis must convince voters he is a
man of passion and vision.
   ``He is a much warmer, decent and compassionate person than has
appeared so far,'' said Siegel. ``Michael Dukakis is not an iceman.
I think that comes through when he is in these kind of
surroundings.''
   Dach dismissed questions about whether the network addresses
will be viewed as a sign of desperation.
   ``I think the public wants to hear more from the candidates,''
he said. ``We want to be sure that they get to see very clearly
where Michael Dukakis will take this country.''
   Larry Sabato, a University of Virginia political scientist who
specializes in campaign media, was unimpressed with the Dukakis
strategy.
   ``I don't think it will work,'' Sabato said. ``I don't think you
can turn around a significant lead by your opponent this way.''
   Schneider, however, said nationally televised addresses would
give Dukakis an opportuntiy to make up for what was widely viewed
as a lackluster performance in his final debate with Bush.
   ``Of course some will view it as a sign of desperation,''
Schneider said. ``It is better for him to shrug and give up? He's
not too far behind for it to work.''

   In hopes of alerting the public to the dangers of
indiscriminate dumping, Seattle activists will begin stenciling the
outlines of salmon in gutters that drain into streams.
   A message with the fish outline will read: ``Dump no waste.
Drains to stream.''
   The effort, sponsored by city, regional and state officials and
volunteer groups, aims to stem the flow of such liquids as motor
oil and paint that damage streams for fish and other wildlife,
officials said recently.
   Ken Pritchard of the volunteer organization Adopt A Beach said
thousands of gallons of such compounds are dumped into drains every
year, where they flow into streams, lakes and Puget Sound.

   A state Senate candidate running on a
platform of fiscal restraint is practicing what he preaches, using
brochures left over from an unsuccesful campaign 18 years ago and
not accepting any contributions.
   ``Why should I ask my friends to pay for my folly?'' said Donald
A. Jepsen of Windsor, who is challenging Democratic incumbent Frank
D. Barrows of Hartford in the 2nd Senate District. ``I'm depending
entirely on the Fourth Estate to get the word out.''
   Jepson acknowledges that he has virtually no chance of winning
in the heavily Democratic district.
   Jepsen's campaign literature is left over from his unsuccessful
race for state representative in 1970 and features his wife, Jane,
and the couple's four children.
   ``You see the youngest girl there,'' he said recently, pointing
to his daughter, Laura, then 4 years old. ``She's a graduate
student now.''
   The old brochures urge voters to ``restore fiscal responsibility
of our state government through new Republican leadership'' and
address such issues as housing, pollution, crime and drug abuse.
   ``The really weird thing is, none of the issues have changed,''
Barrows said.

<HEAD>Tough Penalties for Procurement Fraud OK'd by House</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Major fraud in government purchasing could
earn violators 10-year prison sentences and $10 million fines under
legislation on its way to President Reagan's desk for his signature.
   ``Procurement fraud costs our country hundreds of millions of
dollars a year,'' Rep. William Hughes, D-N.J., said Thursday as the
House gave final approval to the measure on a voice vote.
   The bill, designed to crack down on cheating among defense
contractors, would establish a new crime of major procurement
fraud, applying to losses involving $1 million or more.
   Maximum sentences of 10 years in prison could be imposed under
the bill. Courts also could fine especially flagrant violators up
to $10 million.
   The House already had passed such a measure and in its action
merely agreed to amendments attached by the Senate. Approval came
without any controversy on the floor.
   A statute of limitations of seven years would be established
under the bill in contrast to the normal one of five years.
``Whistleblower'' protections would be afforded to those drawing
attention to major fraud.
   Among other things, the Senate amendments would authorize $8
million over four years for hiring additional prosecutors to handle
fraud cases. But a House feature authorizing $250,000 rewards for
whistleblowing was deleted by the Senate.

   Firearms capable of passing through detection
devices without setting off alarms would be outlawed under
legislation approved by the House and on its way to the Senate.
   ``Plastic gun technology presents enormous problems for our law
enforcement community,'' said Rep. William Hughes, D-N.J., as the
bill won approval on a voice vote Thursday.
   The measure, which would outlaw manufacture, import, sale or
possession of the largely plastic guns, now goes to the Senate.
   A similar bill is part of the major drug bill now in a
House-Senate conference committee, but press secretary Mark Brown
said Hughes wanted to keep a separate version moving ``simply to
keep both irons in the fire.''
   Violators would be subject to $250,000 in fines for individuals
and $1 million for organizations. The bill also calls for prison
terms of up to 5 years for violators.
   The bill would not affect existing firearms because they do not
fall below the minimum levels of detection devices. The legislation
would provide exemptions for the military and intelligence agencies.

   Commercials depicting Democrat Michael Dukakis
as soft on crime are moving more voters this year than anything
else, a pollster said as a handful of new anti-Dukakis crime ads
hit California airwaves.
   The Committee for the Presidency, an independent group backing
Republican George Bush, said Thursday that its three ads would
start today on TV stations in Los Angeles, San Diego and
Bakersfield, and may be used later in other states.
   The spots feature first-person accounts of crimes involving
Willie Horton, a convicted murderer who failed to return to prison
from a weekend furlough under a program supported by Dukakis, the
governor of Massachusetts.
   The independent ads hit on the same themes as Bush campaign
spots that, according to pollster Lou Harris, have had an enormous
impact on the election.
   ``Really more than the debates, more than anything else, they
have determined the set of the election until now,'' he said
Thursday of Bush commercials hammering the furlough program and
Dukakis' opposition to capital punishment.
   Bush's 9-point lead in the latest Harris poll was built mainly
through his crime spots, Harris said before an appearance in
Rochester, N.Y.
   He said 63 percent of voters see Dukakis as soft on crime as
opposed to 52 percent before the Bush attacks aired, and 49 percent
term the governor out of the political mainstream compared with 34
percent who did so before the advertising blitz.
   Dukakis did not starting any new national or regional
advertising Thursday, according to spokeswoman Lorraine Voles. But
he scheduled an appearance today on ABC's ``Good Morning America,''
and Dayton Duncan, his press secretary, said the campaign had
purchased five minutes of time on the same network to air a speech
at 9:55 p.m. Saturday.
   The new anti-Dukakis spots feature Donna Cuomo, whose brother
was murdered by Horton, and Cliff Barnes, whom Horton stabbed
several months after his release on a weekend pass. Horton also
raped Barnes' fiancee.
   Cuomo and Barnes are shown in tight close-ups, their faces and
voices grim as they recount their experiences and criticize
Dukakis' record.
   ``First Dukakis let killers out of prison. He also vetoed the
death penalty,'' says Cuomo, of North Andover, Mass., in one spot.
``Willie Horton stabbed my teen-age brother 19 times. Joey died.
Horton was sentenced to life without parole, but Dukakis gave him a
furlough. He never returned. Horton went on to rape and torture
others.''
   Barnes, of Maryland, says Horton was serving a life term without
parole ``when Governor Dukakis gave him a few days off. Horton
broke into our home. For 12 hours, I was beaten, slashed and
terrorized. My wife, Angie, was brutally raped. When his liberal
experiment failed, Dukakis simply looked away. ... We are worried
people don't know enough about Mike Dukakis.''
   The Committee for the Presidency said it purchased $125,000 of
airtime for a week-long run of the two spots and a 60-second
combination of the two. They may run in other California markets
and Western states if they are needed, said spokesman Fred Karger.
   Rep. Bill Thomas, R-Calif., a co-chairman of the group,
acknowledged under questioning that the furlough program was
started by a Republican governor who preceded Dukakis. But he said
the point is that Dukakis at first vetoed a legislative attempt to
modify the program.
   ``It's far more important to us how it was ended,'' Thomas said.
``The governor who started it isn't running for president.''

<TEXT>
   Democrats trying to ridicule
Republican Dan Quayle's good looks have been hoisting placards that
say, ``But can he type?''
   It turns out that for Lloyd Bentsen, the Democratic vice
presidential nominee, the answer is ``No.''
   Bentsen visited a computer class for 7th and 8th grade students
on Thursday in Corpus Christi, Texas. He was shown an election
awareness project the students had done with their programs, and
then, to complete a computer-printed greeting for his visit,
Bentsen was asked to type in his name. It took him two attempts.
But he got it right after having to ask where the space bar was
located on the keyboard.

<TEXT>
   Trailing badly in the national polls, they went on bread and
water on Bentsen's campaign jet this week.
   Actually, it was bread and Perrier with a twist of lime, and no
hardship at all. Reporters, the Secret Service, staff and the
candidate were enjoying some of B.A. Bentsen's six-grain bread.
   All aboard the campaign jet agreed it was better than the
regular airplane food, and some were still eating it two days later.
   About 80 loaves were baked to Mrs. Bentsen's family recipe and
distributed to the Texas senator's entourage and his Capitol Hill
office. Jokes were made about Mrs. Bentsen still brushing off the
flour as she raced to the plane, but a Washington caterer handled
the job.
   Each loaf, which cost the campaign about $1.80, came with a copy
of the recipe and a poem.
   ``A loaf of bread, the Bentsen's said, is what we chiefly need.
   ``Butter or margarine besides are very good indeed.''
   ``Enjoy!''
   Signed: ``B.A. Bentsen (with apologies to Lewis Carroll and the
Walrus).''
   Mrs. Bentsen said the recipe was one she got from a cook who
worked for the senator's father on their ranch near McAllen in
South Texas. She bakes it often, though not much during the
campaign season, and the senator ``likes it better than cake.''
   The ingredients of the course-textured yeast bread include maple
syrup or honey, blackstrap molasses, wheat germ, raw sunflower
kernels, bran, rye flour and regular and whole wheat flour. Mrs.
Bentsen said the caterer did an admirable job, but her own was
better, probably because of the quantities involved.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Next to Mrs. Bentsen's bread, the most popular food item on the
Bentsen campaign _ at least in conversation _ is, of course, quail.
   The senator's campaign staff dined on stuffed quail just before
his debate with Sen. Dan Quayle, the Republican vice presidential
nominee.
   Bentsen frequently jokes about going quail hunting and says the
Democrats will come from behind this year and ``make 'em eat
quail'' instead of eating crow.
   Reporters found quail at a Houston restaurant and couldn't
resist. ``It was grilled and had a wonderful sauce on it,'' said a
television producer.
   In Arkansas, a local caterer sent to the campaign jet a tray of
smoked baby quail and a little doggerel on the side.
   ``There once was a bird named Quayle,
   ``Who went on the GOP trail,
   ``We tried to rhyme
   ``But ran out of time
   ``So we and Quayle just failed.''

   Carlos Monzon, the undisputed
middleweight boxing champion when he retired in 1977, must remain
in jail until trial begins on charges he killed his girlfriend, the
Supreme Court has ruled.
   The court rejected appeals by Monzon's attorneys Thursday that
he be released pending trial. No trial date has been set.
   Preventive detention is common in this South America country,
depending on the charge and the preliminary evidence presented by
prosecutors. Monzon is charged with homicide.
   Monzon's longtime companion, Alicia Muniz, was found dead Feb.
14 below the balcony of Monzon's second-floor apartment in Mar del
Plata resort, 250 miles south of the capital Buenos Aires.
   Monzon admitted he hit Muniz, but said she slipped and fell over
the rail while attempting to hit him back.
   A provincial court judge charged Monzon, 46, with homicide after
witness Crisanto Baez testified that Monzon carried Muniz on his
shoulder to the balcony rail, then threw her over.
   Monzon won the middleweight title from Italian Nino Benvenuti
May 7, 1970, and defended it 14 times.

<HEAD>Navy Won't Let David Robinson Play Pro Basketball This Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Basketball all-star David Robinson will have
to wait one more year to begin his professional sports career, the
secretary of the Navy said in requiring the 7-foot-1 center to
fulfill his obligation to the military.
   Robinson already holds an eight-year, $26 million contract with
the San Antonio Spurs and had hoped to begin his pro career this
year instead of waiting until next. His two-year commitment to the
Navy doesn't expire until May 17, 1989.
   Robinson, an ensign, said he accepted the ruling Thursday by
Navy Secretary William L. Ball III and would serve the remainder of
his active-duty Navy hitch ``with pride.''
   An All-American while at the U.S. Naval Academy, Robinson played
with America's Olympic basketball team this summer. After the
Olympics ended, he petitioned Ball to be released from active duty
before completing his required two-year service commitment.
   In return, Robinson suggested the Navy increase his obligation
to the Naval Reserve.
   Ball, however, decided he was not going to tamper with the
current Navy policies regarding active-duty servicemen and
professional sports endeavors by providing Robinson with a special
exception, said one source, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The Navy declined to discuss Ball's decision beyond
acknowledging the secretary had spoken by telephone with Robinson
on Thursday morning.
   Robinson, currently assigned to the Navy's Trident submarine
base at Kings Bay, Ga., as a civil engineering officer, was not
available for direct comment.
   But his agent, A. Lee Fentress, released a statement in which
Robinson said he was ``proud to have been able to serve in the Navy
over the past 17 months.''
   Naval Academy graduates are normally required to serve on active
duty for a minimum of five years. Robinson's commitment was cut in
1987, however, by then-Navy Secretary John Lehman, in part because
the basketball star had grown so tall.
   His height prevented him from serving in so-called unrestricted
line specialities _ such as aviation, submarines or surface warfare
_ after graduation.
   Robinson could not have entered the Naval Academy at his present
size, but was 6-foot-7 when he was accepted for admission his
senior year in high school.
   Lehman, in deciding Robinson's future with the Navy, ruled he
should serve two years on active duty, four years in the active
reserve and two years in the inactive reserve.

   Dan Quayle headed south after
scorning Michael Dukakis' complaints that Republicans are
distorting the Democrat's record on crime issues.
   ``Now we have the man from Massachusetts claiming his stand on
crime is being distorted,'' said Quayle. ``This is coming from a
man who blamed George Bush for last year's drop in the stock
market.''
   Quayle's comments came Thursday as his bus caravan wound through
Ohio where he focused on economic themes in a pitch to blue-collar
voters.
   The campaign turns to the South today, stumping in Tennessee and
Georgia after spending all week in Quayle's native Midwest.
   In Ohio, a hotly competitive state, Quayle insisted that
economic recovery has left most of the nation better off.
   ``It means, for the first time ever, we can make and keep the
promise of a job for every American who wants a job,'' said Quayle.
   But along the way, he couldn't resist taking jabs at Democratic
presidential nominee Dukakis, who has complained that Republicans
are guilty of distorting his record on criminals.
   ``Let's try to give a few facts on the crime issue,'' Quayle
told a crowd at a Zanesville, Ohio, shopping mall.
   Massachusetts, Quayle said, ``has the most liberal prison
furlough program in the country.''
   ``Mr. Dukakis defended his furlough program throughout his
governorship,'' Quayle said. ``He refused to change it until forced
to do so by public pressure in this election year.''
   Quayle insisted the attack was simply a response to issues the
Democrats don't like to discuss.
   ``If I had their liberal ideas, I guess I wouldn't want to talk
about it either,'' he said. ``Since they don't want to talk it,
we'll talk about it.''
   But for the most part, Quayle's campaign centered on folksy
parades, kidding with schoolchildren and pepping up volunteers.
   The message of the day was aimed at Reagan Democrats, featuring
claims that the last few years have resulted in economic growth and
opportunity.
   ``This economy is generating millions of jobs in high-paying
occupations,'' he said. ``Those are good jobs at good wages. It
adds up to a job for all who want to work.''
   The jobs and prosperity theme is standard GOP fare, but Quayle
expanded it slightly, saying it's time to make sure minorities are
included.
   The next administration must move for ``the full integration of
blacks and Hispanics into the economy,'' he said. ``The last seven
years have built a foundation for doing exactly that.''
   The final weeks of the campaign have featured an intense
concentration on a series of states such as Ohio, where both sides
say the race is competitive.
   President Reagan swung through Ohio the day before Quayle, while
Dukakis was to visit later.
   Quayle was questioned Thursday about earlier comments by Sen.
Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., that the Indiana senator had been unfairly
portrayed in the media.
   ``I appreciate his comments,'' Quayle said. ``I think it's
appropriate. We've worked together on several issues.''

<HEAD>AIDS `Poster Boy' Celebrates Third Birthday Since Being Diagnosed</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   AIDS victim Bill Travis celebrates his 25th
birthday today with Dionne Warwick, several dozen of their close
friends and top officials of the federal health bureaucracy.
   The highly public spectacle, intended as a birthday salute to
all people with AIDS, comes a year after Travis decided to allow
government officials to cast him as a sort of unofficial poster boy
for AIDS.
   ``My job now is to be public,'' he said in an interview on his
24th birthday. ``I don't particularly enjoy being photographed, but
it's something I've learned to tolerate. If I become the AIDS
poster boy, that's OK.''
   His story appeared in newspapers from coast to coast, including
his account of the family members who admonished: ``Why don't you
just stay quiet? Why are you dragging us through this? We have to
live with this. You're going to die anyway.''
   Soon he was getting calls from television shows to appear and
talk about his struggle with the deadly disease and subsequently
has maintained an often exhausting schedule of speaking
engagements, most often to student groups.
   Does he have any regrets, a year later?
   ``I was in Kansas City last Monday and after speaking to a group
of people, one of them asked me if I feel people with AIDS are
being exploited when they are put into the media, or in public
speaking engagements,'' he says.
   ``My answer was simply that I made the choice to do this. I
don't feel if the people I am speaking to are listening and hearing
what I have to say, taking it to heart for the knowledge and value
of it, that is not exploitation. That is a learning process.
   ``I've enjoyed doing what I can and it gives me personal
satisfaction to know that in the ways I could, I've made what
difference I could. And even more important, I've encouraged others
to make even larger differences.''
   Still, Travis is conscious that he is ``on stage'' most of the
time now. And that can get trying.
   ``My individual birthday has been very personal to me,'' he said
in a telephone interview Wednesday, his actual birthday. ``It means
so much, I have to keep that personal. Today was my day for me.
   ``The thing about the party on Friday is I want to share that. I
don't mind sharing that on Friday. That's the whole idea, a
celebration for all people with AIDS, their birthdays and that
there is hope they can have more and maybe some things will happen
faster then we ever thought.
   ``Today was very nice,'' he said of his actual birthday. ``I did
get up and have a glass of champagne with breakfast because I was
very happy because I was just thinking back to how little hope I
was originally given for surviving even to that first birthday.
   ``I was very happy. This was three now that I wasn't supposed to
make. I wasn't supposed to make any three of these gigs and now I'm
making all three.
   ``They gave me two weeks to live at one point.''
   That was more than three years ago.
   The birthday party for Travis and several others suffering from
AIDS is sponsored jointly by the Warwick Foundation, created by the
famous singer to fight AIDS, Showtime Networks and the Public
Health Service.
   Showtime plans to screen a 15-minute AIDS Awareness tape that is
being distributed by the Public Health Service to state and local
education authorities for use in junior and senior high schools.
   Other entertainers taking part in the celebration are Julie
Harris and Brock Peters, now appearing in the Kennedy Center
production of ``Driving Miss Daisy,'' and three members of the San
Francisco Ballet, also now appearing at the Kennedy Center.
   Among the government officials taking part are Surgeon General
C. Everett Koop and Dr. Robert E. Windom, the assistant Health and
Human Services secretary for health and head of the Public Health
Service.

<HEAD>Angry Serbs Call for New Provincial Leaders</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Angered by the communist
leadership's refusal to overhaul the party power structure,
thousands of Serbs rally in a restive province and demand the
ouster of provincial leaders.
   Chanting ``Thieves'' and ``You betrayed the people,'' a jeering
crowd of 5,000 people turned their backs Thursday on two members of
the ruling national Politburo who came to the province of Kosovo to
respond to Serbian grievances.
   The flag-waving crowd gathered in a suburb of Kosovo's capital,
Pristina, but protesters mostly ignored the remarks by Politburo
members Marko Orlandic and Kacusa Jasari, who also heads Kosovo's
Communist Party.
   After trying to placate the crowd for an hour, the two senior
party officials eventually were hustled away under police escort
when some Serbs tried to rush toward them.
   Later Thursday, a nearby rally of more than 20,000 Serbs
demanded the ouster within five days of the entire party leadership
in Kosovo, an ancient Serbian heartland bordering Albania and
dominated by ethnic Albanians.
   Kosovo is one of two autonomous provinces over which Serbia, the
largest of six national republics, has some control. Serb
nationalists are angry at what they see as a blow to their drive
for increased control by Serbia over Kosovo, where Serbs claim
discrimination by ethnic Albanians.
   The setback came Wednesday when Dusan Ckrebic, a Serbian
Communist closely identified with Serbian party leader Slobodan
Milosevic, failed to win a secret confidence vote at the end of a
three-day session of the party's policy-making Central Committee.
Ckrebic has offered to resign, but Milosevic says he needs Serbian
approval to do so.
   The vote was seen as a criticism of Milosevic. He has been a
force behind months of Serbian nationalist protests that have
combined with economic unrest and culminated in calls for new
national and regional leadership.
   On Thursday, the Kosovo Serbs chanted ``We will not give up
Ckrebic,'' ``We will not give up Dusan,'' and ``Members of the
Central Committee, you have shown your true faces.''
   Kosovo's 200,000 Serbs and Montenegrins, both Slavic peoples,
had hoped the Central Committee session would oust some of the
ethnic Albanian Communist leadership of Kosovo. But no action was
taken and no measures announced to stop the purported harassment.

   A pet Java monkey was none the worse
for wear after eluding police and animal control officers on a
merry chase that included a failed attempt to get him drunk.
   The 5-year-old monkey, Jesse, was at large for most of the day
Wednesday when they failed to snare him with a long-handled net. He
ate two peanut-butter sandwiches laced with tranquilizers and
remained energetic.
   A bowl of liquor was set out in the hopes the monkey would drink
it and nod off. He poured it over Animal Control Officer Julie
Britton.
   Finally, a dart from a tranquilizer gun knocked him out so his
owner, Sheila Walline, could retrieve him from his rooftop perch.
   Jesse's new eight-foot long cage, which reaches to the ceiling,
was being built when he escaped Tuesday night. Ms. Walline said he
climbed on a clothes dryer to reach the knob of an inside door.
   ``He opened that and he opened the screen door and out he
went,'' she said.
   Officials made several attempts to catch him in the next two
days as he was spotted in trees and on rooftops throughout the
neighborhood.
   The grayish-brown monkey, about 18 inches tall, seemed annoyed
by the capture attempts, frequently bouncing up and down and baring
his teeth before scampering out of reach.

   Hurricane Joan left at least 11 people
dead in Venezuela and then sent tens of thousands of people fleeing
for safety as it closed in on Central America Thursday with heavy
rain and 105 mph winds.
   More than 37,000 people, fearing floods and mudslides, fled
coastal areas of Nicaragua and Costa Rica.
   Nicaragua declared a state of alert and closed schools
nationwide as the slow-moving storm lurked in the Caribbean less
than 300 miles offshore.
   President Daniel Ortega enacted an emergency law banning
communications media from reporting unauthorized news about the
hurricane.
   In Colombia, the National Emergency Committee said the storm
killed 15 people there, injured 50, and left tens of thousands
homeless when it swept the Guajira peninsula on Monday.
   Mudslides and heavy rain late Wednesday night and early Thursday
in the wake of the hurricane left at least 11 people dead and at
least eight hurt, mostly children, in the poorest neighborhoods of
Caracas, Venezuela, firefighters there said.
   The mud engulfed wooden huts built precariously on cliffs
overlooking Caracas, the capital. Rescue teams worked through the
day uncovering victims, who were caught in their homes when mud
swept down.
   ``We uncovered 11 people, most of them kids under 14,'' said
Col. Antonio Morillo, firefighter spokesman. He said eight people
were dug up alive.
   Hurricane warnings were in effect Thursday for the Colombian
islands of San Andres and neighboring Albuquerque and Providencia.
A watch was in force on the east coasts of Nicaragua and Costa Rica.
   At midnight EDT Thursday, Joan's center was about 110 miles
southeast of San Andres and about 225 miles east-southeast of
Bluefields, Nicaragua, near latitude 11.5 north and longitude 80.5
west, said a statement from the National Hurricane Center in Coral
Gables, Fla.
   The hurricane was drifting westward and was expected to continue
moving slowly in that direction overnight, the statement said.
Maximum sustained winds were 105 mph, it said.
   Bob Sheets, hurricane center director, said the storm's slow
movement made it hard to predict, but forecasters still expected it
to strike Nicaragua or Costa Rica on Friday or Saturday.
   Officials said Costa Rica has never been hit by a hurricane in
recorded history, and the last one that hit Nicaragua was in 1911.
   Nicaraguan officials worried about the readiness of government
agencies, relief organizations and coastal residents, some of whom
live in wooden homes on stilts.
   ``We're prepared for war, not hurricanes,'' said Nicaragua's
agrarian reform minister, Jaime Wheelock.
   About 7,000 people fled Nicaragua's remote Miskito Coast and two
small islands by boat.
   Electrical storms played across Nicaragua early in the day and a
light rain was falling in Bluefields at midday, but otherwise no
rain was reported in the hurricane's target zone.
   Heavy rain was reported in Colon, Panama, south of the storm,
but a spokesman for Panama's civil emergency system said the danger
was diminishing because Joan seemed to be headed away.
   In Costa Rica, the National Emergency Council said at least
30,000 people were evacuated from Puerto Limon, a town of 20,000
about 100 miles southeast of the capital of San Jose, and 14 other
towns in the coastal province.
   Council spokeswoman Nevaira Perera said 8,000 more would be
evacuated from Puerto Limon by the end of the day. The evacuees
were being taken to shelters in the central cities of Guapiles and
Siquirri.
   Public Security Minister Hernan Garron said 1,000 police were in
Puerto Limon to prevent looting. Education Minister Francisco
Pacheco said schools and universities throughout the country would
close beginning Friday until the storm was over.
   Costa Rican officials feared Joan could destroy many of the
20,000 banana plantations along the cost. Bananas are one of the
republic's major exports after coffee.
   A mudslide blocked the highway between San Jose and Puerto Limon
for hours Wednesday night and rivers flooded. No injuries or
serious damage were reported.
   Nicaragua's information minister, Manuel Espinoza, said the
government moved 5,000 women, children and old people by boat
Thursday from Bluefields, 180 miles east of Managua on the Miskito
Coast, to shelters in the city of Rama.

<HEAD>FAA Orders Inspections of Takeoff Warning Horns on All Boeing 727s
and 737s</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's airlines are being told to
examine the takeoff warning horns on two of the industry's most
widely used jetliners after faulty alarms were found in 35 of the
aircraft.
   The inspections on nearly 1,800 Boeing 727s and 737s, which were
ordered Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration, comes as
federal accident investigators continue to try to determine whether
an alarm may have failed on a Delta Air Lines Boeing 727 that
crashed last August at the Dallas-Fort Worth airport.
   The alarm is designed to sound if a pilot has forgotten to
prepare an aircraft properly for takeoff, such as leaving wing
flaps, which help give a plane lift, in the wrong position.
   The National Transportation Safety Board has said there is
evidence, though not conclusively determined, that the flaps may
not have been in the proper position on the Delta jet, yet a
cockpit voice recorder tape shows the alarm did not sound. The NTSB
investigation into the crash, which killed 14 people, is not yet
completed.
   As a result of questions surrounding the Delta accident the FAA
last month ordered a one-time ``purely precautionary'' check of the
takeoff alarms on nearly 1,200 Boeing 727s. The agency announced
Thursday that in 35 cases, the alarms either did not work or worked
improperly.
   ``This condition, if not corrected, could result in an attempted
takeoff with the airplane in the improper configuration and with
the takeoff warning system inoperative,'' the FAA told the airlines
in its special airworthiness directive.
   The FAA said 29 of the jets with defective warning systems
belonged to three airlines: Continental Airlines, with 17; Eastern
Airlines, eight; and Delta Air Lines, four. United Airlines and
Federal Express each had two planes with faulty alarms and Orion
Air and AmeriJet International each had one, the FAA said.
   The airlines were ordered to conduct ``repetitive testing'' of
all the alarm systems including the ``repair and replacement of
inoperative components if necessary'' on the 727s as well as Boeing
737s which the FAA said had a similar system ``subject to similar
failures.''
   FAA spokesman John Leyden said the inspections, which are likely
to take about three hours, must be made within 200 flying hours and
then repeated every 200 hours. He said they are not expected to
disrupt the airlines' normal operating schedules since they likely
will be conducted during routine maintenance.
   A takeoff warning alarm, although a different design from those
on the Boeing aircraft, failed to sound last year on a McDonnell
Douglas MD-80 jetliner after the flight crew forgot to set the
plane's flaps, keeping it from gaining proper lift. The Northwest
Airlines jet crashed seconds after taking off from Detroit
Metropolitan Airport, killing 156 people.
   No special tests have been conducted on the MD-80 alarm system,
although McDonnell Douglas and the FAA has advised operators that
flight crews should manually check the warning alarm before each
takeoff.
   In Seattle, Craig Martin, a spokesman for the Boeing Co.,
reserved comment on the FAA order, saying he had not seen it.
   According to industry figures, 1,148 Boeing 727s and 634 Boeing
737s were being flown by major U.S. airlines at the beginning of
this year. Boeing had orders for delivering another 73 Boeing 737s
this year, but it could not be determined how many of those
actually are in airlines' hands. The Boeing 727 is no longer
produced.
   The warning system sounds whenever a set of control or flight
devices is not placed in proper position. In the two Boeing jets,
the alarm is a loud horn, while in some other model aircraft such
as the McDonnell Douglas MD-80, a computerized voice provides the
warning.
   The alarm is designed to protect against improper configuration
of such items as the power throttle; flaps, which help a plane gain
lift during takeoff; speed brakes, which are used to slow the plane
when landing but must be disengaged on takeoff; and leading edge
slats, which are essential for a plane to gain lift.
   According to the Air Transport Association figures, the airlines
with at least 100 Boeing 727s in operation are American Airlines,
United Airlines, Delta, Eastern Airlines and Continental Airlines.
Continental, Delta, United, Piedmont Airlines, USAir and Southwest
Airlines are among the major users of Boeing 737s.

<HEAD>Beauty School and Its President Charged in Student Loan Abuse</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAMPA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal indictment Thursday charged Wilfred
American Educational Corp., which runs beauty schools in 10 states,
along with its president and 18 employees with stealing from
student financial-aid programs.
   The 65-count, 87-page indictment charging racketeering,
falsifying documents and theft or misapplication of funds followed
a three-year probe of Wilfred Academies of Hair and Beauty Culture
operations in Tampa, St. Petersburg and Orlando, a federal
prosecutor said.
   Wilfred is a publicly-held corporation based in New York. Its
students receive about $75 million a year in federal educational
entitlement funds, placing the school among the top five of its
kind in the country, authorities said.
   Philip E. Jakeway Jr. of East Chester, N.Y., Wilfred`s
65-year-old president and chief executive officer, and 18 officers
and employees are accused of scheming to defraud the U.S.
Department of Education.
   Jakeway and the corporation are charged with 28 counts of making
false statements, 27 counts of stealing, embezzling or misapplying
funds either provided or insured by the Department of Education,
eight counts of wire fraud and a single count of operating a
racketeering enterprise.
   A young person studying to be a cosmetologist or beautician can
receive $2,500 aid a year toward tuition and expenses at a Wilfred
school.
   Investigators said the money frequently didn't reach the
applicant and went instead into a large pool operated by Wilfred.
   For the most part, the students were in their late teens and
unfamiliar with loan or grant applications, said James B. Thomas
Jr., of the Department of Education's inspector general's office.
   They were told to sign blank applications to which false
information was added, he said, or they were induced to give false
information to ensure government aid.
   In many cases they were aided by school officials or they relied
on them to help complete the paperwork, he said.
   Most of the time, the money was not sent directly to the
students, but to Wilfred, said Thomas at a joint news conference in
Tampa with the FBI and U.S. Attorney Robert Genzman of the Middle
District of Florida.
   Students frequently didn't get the money, wound up in debt and
eventually dropped out, he said.
   Authorities said investigators conducted 300 interviews and
sifted through 6,000 documents going back until 1979 on the
racketeering count and 1981 on the other charges.
   Investigations are being conducted elsewhere, authorities said
without disclosing what states. And Thomas said eight employees
previously pleaded in a similar case in Boston.
   Genzman said officials don't know how many students were
involved. He said investigators tried to figure how much money was
involved but ``it was difficult to do.''
   ``It could be in the hundreds of thousands or millions of
dollars,'' he said.
   Arrest warrants were issued for those indicted and arrangements
were made to allow them to surrender.

<HEAD>Investigation Continues In 25-year-old Church Bombing Allegations</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   State and federal investigators are
continuing their probe of a dying man's claim that he helped with
the church bombing that killed four black girls in 1963,
authorities said Thursday.
   ``It's still kind of early to know whether he is credible or
not,'' said Rusty Loftin, an assistant state attorney general who
talked to Gary A. Tucker in a Veterans Hospital at Tuscaloosa,
where Tucker is a cancer patient.
   Tucker ``mentioned some names,'' Loftin said, adding that
authorities need to talk to other people to find ``something to
corroborate what he's telling us.''
   In a story published Friday, the Birmingham Post-Herald quoted
unidentified Department of Justice sources as saying that Tucker
named a man serving a prison term in Alabama on theft and drug
charges as an accomplice in the bombing.
   The inmate, who is reported to be a boyhood friend of Tucker's,
denied Tucker's claims and would not comment on whether he had been
interviewed by the FBI.
   The inmate, who according to prison records has been in and out
of prisons since the early 1970s, also denied knowing Robert
Chambliss, the Ku Klux Klansman convicted in 1977 in the killing of
one of the four girls.
   Relatives and friends of the 54-year-old Tucker have said he
suffers from hallucinations and probably is seeking attention.
   In Washington, Ray McElhaney of the FBI said Thursday that the
agency, which has interviewed Tucker, ``has an investigative
interest and we are coordinating with the U.S. attorney's office
and local authorities in Birmingham.''
   McElhaney said any other comment from the FBI would be
inappropriate.
   Loftin would not elaborate on Tucker's mentioning the names of
others he said were involved with him in the Sept. 15, 1963,
bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church.
   ``I think it's safe to say we've always suspected other people
were involved,'' Loftin said. ``If what he's saying is true, that
could very well be.''
   Chambliss, 73 at the time of the bombing, died in prison in 1985
while serving a life sentence on the murder charge.
   Loftin, asked whether Tucker mentioned Chambliss, said that
Tucker ``doesn't remember a lot,'' but that Chambliss could be a
part of the story. ``We don't know at this point how it all ties in
together,'' Loftin said.
   Jefferson County District Attorney David Barber has refused to
comment, saying that Tucker's statements are being sorted out.
   The bombing killed Carole Robertson, Cynthia Wesley and Addie
Mae Collins, all 14, and Denise McNair, 11. They were in a women's
lounge when the bomb blast tore through the wall from concrete
steps outside the church.
   Former Attorney General Bill Baxley, who prosecuted Chambliss,
said he had never heard of Tucker or the inmate mentioned by Tucker.
   Since Tucker contacted authorities last week and told them he
took part in the bombing, he has been placed in a guarded room at
the Tuscaloosa hospital.
   Tucker is a former truck driver who in 1963 lived in Sumiton,
about 25 northwest of Birmingham. Tucker, who was 29 at the time of
the bombing, has refused to talk with reporters.

   The war ended for Lt. Col. Thomas Hart
III when his gunship was ravaged by enemy fire and crashed into the
Laotian forest just before Christmas in 1972.
   His wife's fight ended in federal court Thursday, when a judge
awarded her family $632,000 for the severe emotional distress they
suffered after the U.S. Air Force misidentified bone fragments as
Hart's remains in 1985.
   In a decision that attorneys said could set a precedent for
other cases involving missing soldiers, Senior U.S. District Judge
Winston Arnow ruled the Air Force was responsible for the distress
to Hart's wife Anne, her daughter Gillian Hart and Hart's mother
Vera Lee Hart.
   For Anne Hart the money is small compensation, however.
   ``Money has never been the issue,'' said Mrs. Hart, reached at
home following the decision. ``There is no amount of money that can
undo the damage that has been done to my family. But we might keep
the government from doing this again to another family.''
   Mrs. Hart's battle against the military began in 1985 when about
50,000 bone fragments and personal objects taken from a Laotian
crash site were analyzed by the Air Force and some were identified
as Hart's remains.
   But Mrs. Hart had refused to accept the identification, which
was based on small bone fragments, and battled the Air Force to win
an independent evaluation. The probe found the fragments were
insufficient to prove the identities of most of the crash victims.
   Hart was one of 16 people aboard an AC-130 gunship shot down
over Laos. Two crewmen survived and were rescued but Hart was
listed as missing in action. Six years later the government changed
his status to presumed dead.
   ``She is pleased this case is going to serve as a precedent for
the families of other Southeast Asia war veterans,'' said her
attorney Fran Frick. ``It will afford them some protection against
the same thing happening to them.''
   Arnow had ruled in January that Mrs. Hart suffered from severe
emotional distress but he delayed the issue of damages until this
month's trial, which lasted two weeks.
   ``This has never been a win-or-lose situation for her,'' Ms.
Frick said. ``What the government has done has ruined her life. No
amount of money is going to give her back what she's lost.''
   Ms. Frick said the government may have hurried the
identifications to reinforce the joint effort between Laos and the
United States, the first cooperation between the two countries
after the war.
   Lt. Col. Keith Schneider, a Pentagon spokesman, said in
Washington that the Defense Department did not have any immediate
comment on the ruling.

   Geraldo Rivera says he's having a devil of a
time with NBC censors over the TV personality's upcoming special on
satanism.
   Rivera said Thursday he is so unhappy with network censors that
he may broadcast blank pictures Tuesday night rather than make more
cuts in his two-hour special, ``Devil Worship: Exposing Satan's
Underground.''
   ``We're going to make the changes that we consider
appropriate,'' Rivera said.
   NBC spokeswoman Rosemary Keenan said talks between Rivera and
network censors were continuing.
   Rivera had hoped the show would include graphic descriptions of
satanic murders and other rituals.
   ``NBC hired me to bring the viewer into the belly of this
beast,'' he said. ``There is an aspect of the grotesque in the
ritual crimes that are being committed out there.
   ``If you sanitize it to make it more palatable to the network
censors, then you do violence to the truth, in our opinion,''
Rivera said.

   Grammy Award-winning singer Lynn
Anderson was booked on a misdemeanor charge of malicious mischief
after a pre-dawn incident at the home of songwriter Paul Williams'
brother.
   Judicial Commissioner Howard Taradash released Anderson, known
for her 1970 hit ``(I Never Promised You A) Rose Garden,'' on her
own recognizance after she was booked Wednesday following the
incident earlier that day.
   The warrant was sworn out by Linda Gail Bower, who told police
that Anderson vandalized her car and threatened her life after
songwriter Mentor Williams refused to let Anderson into his home.
   Ms. Bower, who was at the house, said Anderson stole her leather
jacket and threw some of her belongings into garbage pails.
   Ms. Bower said Mentor Williams is a former boyfriend of Anderson.
   ``This is nonsense. The charges have no merit,'' Anderson said
through spokeswoman Cathy Gurley.
   Williams declined to discuss the incident, other than to say,
``I've always had this strange power over women.''
   Williams wrote and produced the 1973 rock hit, ``Drift Away.''
   Anderson, 41, won a Grammy Award for ``(I Never Promised You a)
Rose Garden'' in 1970, and was a vocalist on television's ``The
Lawrence Welk Show.''

   Actor Joel Grey says 22 years of experience
between award-winning portrayals of the perverse master of
ceremonies in the musical ``Cabaret'' helped make his performance
``lots'' sleazier now.
   ``I think there was something more innocent about the show
then,'' he said at a news conference Thursday to promote the Nov. 1
opening of the touring revival of the show.
   He said that since first appearing in the show, he had a chance
to visit a nightclub in Hamburg, West Germany, that was much more
sinister than the fictional Kit Kat Klub of 1930s Berlin of
``Cabaret.''
   Grey won a Tony as the master of ceremonies in the original
stage version of ``Cabaret'' that opened in New York in 1966, then
won an Academy Award as best supporting actor in 1972 for the same
role in the film version.

   A federal court jury acquitted Sasson Jeans
founder Paul Guez of threatening the life of a U.S. bankruptcy
judge.
   The jury deliberated less than two hours before finding Guez
innocent Thursday following a three-day trial in Manhattan.
   Guez was arrested in Manhattan last May 18 after reportedly
threatening the life of Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland, who was
presiding over the reorganization of Sasson Jeans Inc.
   Lifland later authorized the sale of the Sasson trademark as
part of the bankruptcy proceedings.
   Guez, who spent 28 days at a drug rehabilitation center in
California this past summer, said he was ``very much happy'' with
the verdict.

<HEAD>House, Senate Negotiators Reach Agreement on Compromise Drug Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Faced with a revolt by conservatives,
congressional leaders attached anti-obscenity provisions to a
compromise drug bill so the measure can pass and the 100th Congress
can go home.
   A weary House Speaker Jim Wright predicted Thursday night that
both houses would approve the leaders' ``final agreement'' on the
drug bill today, but cautioned that the obscenity language could
not be ``nailed down'' until lawmakers reviewed it. The bill is the
major legislation keeping Congress in session.
   After marathon meetings by rank-and-file negotiators, Wright _
along with the majority and minority leaders of both houses _
gathered to tackle the unresolved issues Thursday night.
   The thorniest among them proved to be Senate-passed language to
give the federal government broad new powers to combat obscenity.
   Earlier in the day, rank-and-file lawmakers stripped the
language from the drug bill after liberals insisted the
government's powers would be too broad.
   ``We were threatened with a revolt'' by conservatives, said
Wright, who admitted he began envisioning an embarrassing floor
fight that would destroy his effort to unite liberals and
conservatives, Democrats and Republicans, behind the bill that
could help all incumbents.
   A coalition of conservative groups began an intense last-ditch
telephone campaign to win inclusion of the anti-obscenity
provisions, said Diane Quartermain, legislative affairs director of
the Liberty Federation, formerly the Moral Majority.
   The bill _ which would authorize some $2.5 billion in new
anti-drug money, is an ambitious attempt to deal with all aspects
of the drug problem, including law enforcement, treatment,
rehabilitation, education and help for authorities in
drug-producing countries.
   New initiatives would include up to $10,000 in civil fines for
those caught with personal use amounts of drugs; a federal death
penalty for killers in drug-related crimes; and denial of some
federal benefits to convicted drug offenders, including users.
   A number of lawmakers cautioned the drug bill would be
meaningless without new financing, and the House Appropriations
Committee took quick action Thursday.
   The panel approved $500 million in new spending for the drug
bill, an amount that would pay for barely a third of the estimated
$1.4 billion first-year costs of the legislation. The final cost is
expected to be about $2.5 billion if the multi-year measure is
fully financed.
   The $500 million includes: $242 million for treatment,
prevention and education; $179 million for new agents and equipment
for federal law enforcement agencies; $42 million for the federal
courts; $25 million for the Coast Guard; and the rest for programs
of the departments of state and agriculture, and the Food and Drug
Administration.
   A combined bill to combat adult obscenity and child pornography
had passed the Senate 97-0 previously, and was added to the drug
bill when the House refused to take action. The child pornography
language was approved by the drug bill negotiators.
   The obscenity language passed by the Senate would allow the
federal government to seize property used to commit or promote an
obscenity offense; and authorize the government to seek civil fines
against those producing, transporting or receiving obscene
materials.
   But Wright said the leadership agreed to target only major
dealers or producers of obscene materials who were ``knowingly
engaged for a long period of time.'' He said the language was not
aimed at the bookstore owner who may have a single volume judged to
be obscene.
   He called the language ``constitutionally respectable and
acceptable.''
   Lawmakers opted to accept portions of House and Senate language
on a program to deny federal benefits to convicted drug offenders,
including those convicted of possession.
   Benefits such as federal public housing, grants, contracts,
loans, mortgage guarantees, and some forms of veterans' aid could
be lost to drug offenders. Judges would have discretion, however,
on whether to impose the penalty after conviction.
   The president would submit a report on the program to Congress
next May, allowing lawmakers to reconsider the proposal. No one
could be denied benefits before next September. Social Security,
Medicare, welfare benefits and some other veterans' aid programs
would be exempted even after September.
   Negotiators agreed that if someone is killed during a federal
drug felony, the federal death penalty could apply if: the killer
was engaged in a continuing criminal enterprise; was trafficking in
major amounts of cocaine, heroin or other drugs; intentionally gave
an order that resulted in a killing; or killed a police officer.
   In other key decisions, negotiators:
   _Agreed to create a ``drug czar'' in the president's Cabinet, to
coordinate national drug policy. The official would develop plans
for every phase of the drug war, share with relevant Cabinet heads
the authority to transfer personnel, and have the right to object
when he believes drug funding is inadequate or misdirected.
   _Dropped a House provision that would have permitted
introduction in federal court of evidence seized illegally, but in
``good faith,'' even in warrantless searches.
   _Accepted Senate language on child pornography, including a
20-year-to-life prison term for anyone convicted of facilitating
use of a child for producing sexually explicit materials.
   _Gave the Justice Department nine months to develop a system for
gun dealers to check whether purchasers are convicted felons.
   _Agreed that records of those punished by civil fines would be
expunged automatically after a period of time.
   _Resolved that states initially would have to contribute 25
percent of the cost of federal grants for anti-drug crime programs.
After the first year of the four-year program, the state portion
would go to 50 percent.
   _Agreed to restore to U.S. attorneys the ability to prosecute
corrupt public officials under the theory that they deprived
Americans of honest government services. A Supreme Court ruling in
June 1987 had prevented such prosecutions.
   _Agreed to finance drug education programs for private
employees, low-income pregnant women, gang members, students, and
dropouts.
   _Decided to drop proposals for random drug testing of
transportation workers.

Crash</HEAD>

   The families of 10 people killed when a
military jet ripped through a hotel lobby lashed out at the Air
Force on the anniversary of the crash, accusing officials of what
one called ``the utmost insensitivity.''
   Sobs filled the charred shell of the Ramada Inn-Airport on
Thursday as parents poked through the debris where their children
died in a fireball on Oct. 20, 1987. A year later, the seven-story
hotel remains blackened, damaged and smelling of smoke.
   ``That's where my daughter died. We think those were her
shoes,'' said Robert T. Goldberg, pointing to a desktop in what was
once the office of his daughter, Beth, who handled reservations for
the hotel.
   Air Force Master Sgt. Larry Martin and his wife, Cheryl, combed
the rubble for the baby ring their daughter, Dawn Shelly, always
wore before her death.
   ``It should be here. It should be here,'' Martin said as tears
filled his eyes.
   Family members said they are bitter about their treatment by the
U.S. Air Force, which doesn't have to pay damages under Indiana law
for the deaths of adult victims who left no dependents.
   ``When the U.S. Air Force kills innocent people, survivors
should receive justice,'' Goldberg said.
   He and other parents contend the Indiana law prevents people
here from receiving justice equal to those in other states.
   ``Because the Air Force is hiding behind Indiana's wrongful
death law, we are being treated with the utmost insensitivity,''
Martin said.
   He added that the Air Force has ``shown little compassion for
our family'' and it has chosen ``to devalue that beautiful gift of
human life by treating the survivors' families as if we are the
guilty party in this wrongful act.''
   The families said they want the law to be changed, and they want
a jury to decide whether the crash was caused by negligence and
whether damages should be awarded.
   An Air Force panel already has cleared the pilot, Maj. Bruce
Teagarden, of any wrongdoing in the crash.
   Teagarden was en route from Pittsburgh to Nellis Air Force Base
in Nevada when his jet's engine shut down. He was trying to land at
Indianapolis International Airport when he was forced to eject and
the jet hit the hotel. He was unhurt.
   Maintenance records showed previous mechanical problems with the
jet, and an Air Force investigation indicated that Teagarden and
air traffic controllers violated some regulations during the
emergency.
   Several families have filed suit against the government.
Goldberg said the Air Force has offered his family $50,000 as
compensation for his daughter's death.
   ``The Air Force has been trying to reach settlements quickly,
compassionately and responsibly,'' said Lt. Col. Thomas A. Mahr,
public affairs officer for Air Force headquarters in Washington,
D.C. ``We believe we are offering equitable settlements within the
bounds of the laws that apply.''
   Hotel owner Sam Saini of Dayton, Ohio, called Air Force
officials ``inhuman people'' and said he plans to file a $13
million lawsuit against the Air Force this week in U.S. District
Court here.
   Saini, who wants to reopen the hotel, said the Air Force offered
him a $5 million settlement. Last month, Saini's insurance company
paid him $4.2 million, but that covers only half his losses.
   On Thursday, the victims' relatives and friends also gathered at
St. Christopher Catholic Church for a memorial service sponsored by
the county's Victim Assistance Fund.

<HEAD>Small Parties May Play Kingmakers In Israel Election</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS graf 11 beginning: `Some say ...' to CORRECT typo in

   Small parties, especially those
representing Arabs and religious Jews, could determine whether the
right-wing Likud bloc or the leftist Labor Party is the big winner
in Israel's Nov. 1 elections.
   The race is expected to be close, with the winner being the
major party that woos the most small parties into a coalition after
the balloting is over.
   There are 25 small parties, and pollsters predict they will
garner up to 40 percent of the votes cast and an unprecedented
number of seats in the 120-member Knesset, or parliament.
   The most sought after are the religious parties.
   Jews who vote primarily on the basis of religious questions make
up 10 percent of the 2.9 million eligible voters. Five religious
parties won 13 seats in 1984, and seven parties are contending this
time.
   Religious groups have drifted to the right in recent years, and
most of their leaders express a preference for Likud. But they
leave open the possibility of joining Labor.
   Rabbi Moshe Zeev Feldman, head of the Agudat Yisrael Party of
Ultra-Orthodox, said recently at his home in the religious
community of Bnei Brak that moral issues such as drug use and dress
take precedence over peace and security, which are the key issues
between the blocs.
   ``There can be no security without the help of God. Without
God's hand guiding the triggers of our soldiers, there never was
any success and can be no success.
   ``What we are very troubled about is the deteriorating moral
climate,'' said Feldman, whose party controls two parliament seats.
   He said Likud's positions were closer to his party's, ``but that
doesn't mean Labor can't change.''
   Some say support for religious legislation and yesheva seminary
schools may be determining factors in persuading such parties to
join a coalition.
   The Arab vote is more problematic because Arab-oriented parties
like the Communists have publicly identified with the Palestine
Liberation Organization. They have thus been regarded as unfit
coalition partners by both major blocs.
   Palestinians with Israeli citizenship make up about 12 percent
of the eligible voters. They could control 14 seats or more,
depending on the turnout.
   Two Arab-oriented parties currently hold six seats. Other Arab
voters cast ballots for Israeli parties in the last election,
giving Labor about two seats worth of votes.
   This time Labor is expected to lose ground because of the tough
measures adopted by Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin of Labor in
putting down the uprising. At least 301 Palestinians and six
Israelis have died since the uprising began Dec. 8.
   Attallah Mansour of the Al Sinara Arabic newspaper in Nazareth
predicted that 70 percent of the Arab vote would go to parties on
the extreme left.
   ``Labor will be punished for Rabin's actions,'' Mansour said.
``To see Israeli soldiers shoot Arab civilians in the occupied
territories every day on television is an issue for us.''
   To get into the Knesset, a party needs to win 1 percent of the
vote, or about 24,000 ballots. Only 12 or 13 small parties are
expected to clear this hurdle.
   Some parties have little chance. These include the ``Quiet
Force,'' which advocates a less noisy and aggressive society.
   Other small parties are off-shoots of the major parties and
almost certainly will join them in trying to form a ruling
coalition of 61 parliament seats.
   Foreign Minister Shimon Peres' Labor, for example, can count on
the support of the liberal Civil Rights Movement, the Socialist
Mapam party and the centrist Shinui party.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's Likud will get backing from the
pro-settlement Tehiya party, the Tzomet faction of ex-Chief of
Staff Raful Eytan and the Moledet party, which advocates the
voluntary transfer abroad of Palestinians.

<HEAD>Media Losing Interest in AIDS, Delegates Told</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD HERZFELDER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>IXTAPA, Mexico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The media has run out of heart-rending
human interest stories and is rapidly losing interest in AIDS while
researchers still struggle to cure the deadly disease, experts say.
   ``AIDS will be a major topic again when journalists can announce
a cure or a vaccine,'' Roger Staub of the Swiss AIDS Campaign said
Thursday at the conclusion of a four-day conference on the disease.
   More than 600 researchers, health workers, psychologists,
sociologists and other scientists from 72 nations gathered at this
Pacific resort for the First International Symposium on Education
and Communication about AIDS.
   Next year's AIDS symposium will take place in the West African
nation of Cameroon.
   Among the topics debated was the media's treatment of the
disease. Jim Bunn, a television reporter from San Francisco who
works for the World Health Organization, said the decline in media
interest is ``all part of the evolution of the disease.
   ``The stories about heartache have been told time and time
again,'' he said, discussing what some participants called ``AIDS
fatigue.''
   Jonathan Mann, director of WHO's Global Program against AIDS,
said a conference on AIDS in Stockholm earlier this year was the
high point of media interest, but it ebbed quickly.
   ``The media is much less interested in AIDS than it was a year
ago,'' Mann said. Nevertheless, he said, health workers will remain
in the field long after ``the flashbulbs are no longer popping.''
   The slow, slogging work of epidemiologists and educators in
trying to contain the disease is not glamorous, but is vital and is
the only real way to fight a disease for which there is no vaccine
and no cure, speakers said.
   The virus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome
spreads most often by sexual contact or by blood or blood products;
the illness, which often breaks out years after the virus has
invaded the body, damages the immune system and leaves it open to a
variety of diseases.
   Speakers at sessions on the media and AIDS condemned
sensationalized accounts and stories that are biased and
judgemental and tend to blame one group for the spread of the
disease.
   Inange Rko, an official at Kenya's ministry of public health,
criticized coverage of Africa by the Western media as unfair and
condemned what she called an irrelevant and unprovable effort to
stigmatize Africa as the disease's starting point.
   Laurie Garrett, a reporter for the Long Island-based newspaper
Newsday and assigned to the AIDS beat, said the media had to take a
critical stance toward efforts to fight the disease.
   ``The press does not try to make people use condoms, that's not
our job,'' she said. ``My job is to ask whether you are doing your
job.''
   Staub, a leader of an effective campaign to encourage the use of
condoms and ``safe sex'' among homosexuals in Switzerland, said
``the media are powerful enough to overrun public health messages
with one sensational story.''
   ``I have learned that I cannot trust anyone in the media except
for those few that are specialists (in the AIDS story),'' he said.
   But Luis Pedro Goicochea Vergara, who studied coverage of the
epidemic in Peru, said health workers should accept the limits of
the media.
   ``It's impossible to ask many newspapers in Latin America to
have specialists in AIDS. Newspapers can't afford it,'' he said.

<HEAD>Preschoolers Get Less Protection On Playground Than Construction
Workers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SONYA ROSS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Few regulations exist to prevent a preschool
child's frolic on playground equipment from turning into a
potentially fatal fall, even though many such hazards could be
avoided, federal health officials say.
   The Centers for Disease Control said Thursday that workers at
construction sites are protected by more safety precautions than
children under 4 years of age on playgrounds.
   A child could suffer severe head injuries or die if he fell
headfirst onto a concrete or asphalt surface from a height of one
foot or onto packed earth from four feet, the CDC said in its
weekly report.
   ``If you can crack your skull from a fall from one foot off the
ground, why put concrete on the playground?'' asked CDC
epidemiologist Jeffrey Sacks. ``We're not asking a child to change
his behavior, we're just saying make the environment more
forgiving.''
   A four- to five-foot fall can be fatal for an adult, and the
Occupational Safety and Health Administration requires that
guardrails be installed in some instances to protect workers as low
as four feet above ground, Sacks said.
   Yet no regulation exists requiring safety measures to guard
against playground falls.
   Although the Consumer Product Safety Commission supervises the
equipment, Sacks said, it does not control where it is placed. The
CDC's report said 48 percent of day-care playground equipment is
not installed over impact-absorbing surfaces.
   ``The CPSC regulation doesn't stop anybody from taking safe
equipment and mounting it over broken glass,'' Sacks said. ``And
there's no regulation regarding that.''
   The CDC said the severity of injuries is reduced if a child
falls from as high as eight feet onto energy-absorbing mats, wood
chips or sand.
   The agency recommended that playground equipment be made safer
for small children by installing it over soft surfaces, locating it
away from obstructing objects, anchoring it and inspecting it
frequently. If wood chips or sand are used as surfacing, they
should not be allowed to compact or fall below an adequate depth.
   Most preschool-aged children with injuries involving school
playground equipment were 3- or 4-year-old boys, with more injuries
occurring in the spring months, the CDC said.
   According to data gathered by the CPSC, about 6.2 million
emergency room visits in U.S. hospitals between 1983 and 1987 were
product-related injuries among preschoolers aged 1-4, with 305,281
involving playground equipment.
   Nearly 56 percent of the playground injuries to preschoolers
happened to boys, while about 45 percent involved girls, the CDC
said. Falls comprised 60 percent of the injuries; 40 percent were
associated with climbing. Two-thirds of injuries occurred in the
head and neck regions, the CDC said.
   The data indicated that 38 percent of preschoolers' injuries
happened at the child's home, 33 percent were at day care centers,
29 percent were in sports or recreation settings, and 9 percent
were at school. About 5 percent of preschool children treated for
playground-related injuries had to be hospitalized, the CDC said.
   ``This is not a band-aid situation. We're talking about breaking
bones, getting severe cuts,'' Sacks said. ``Many of the serious
injuries involve falls on the head, skull injuries and brain
damage. Those could easily be prevented.''
   The CPSC obtained statistics for its analysis by using data from
an electronic injury surveillance system located in 62 hospitals.
The study pointed out a need for measures to protect children who
climb on playground equipment, some of which is more than 10 feet
above the ground.

   A senior State Department official says the
United States has no plans to withdraw troops from South Korea even
though President Reagan says it might be possible to reduce the
U.S. military presence there.
   ``We have no intention of anything of that sort,'' Gaston Sigur,
assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs,
told reporters Thursday after Reagan met with South Korean
President Roh Tae-woo.
   ``We would have to have a firm belief on the part of our country
and the Republic of Korea that the threat from North Korea was
over,'' Sigur said. ``That threat is not over. We have certainly no
intention of changing our policy of maintaining our ground forces
in South Korea.''
   The president, posing for pictures with Roh in the Rose Garden,
was asked by a reporter if he could ``envision a time in the near
future when the U.S. would be reducing its military presence.''
   ``That is a possibility, but it would not be one of us just
withdrawing _ it would be one of (being) no longer needed,'' Reagan
said.
   The United States has about 42,000 troops stationed in South
Korea under a mutual defense pact.
   Sigur said the two presidents did not discuss the subject of
troop reduction.
   He said Reagan told Roh that the United States ``fully
supports'' his proposals to bring about ``a new atmosphere of
reconciliation on the Korean peninsula.''
   The two presidents discussed several steps the United States is
considering, Sigur said, adding that those steps would be announced
``within the next few days or so.''
   He said these steps would not including lifting a U.S. ban on
trade with North Korea, but could include ``humanitarian trade ...
humanitarian aspects of relationships.'' He declined to elaborate.
   Sigur said U.S. officials ``feel comfortable'' with Roh's
proposal for a six-power conference including the United States,
the Soviet Union, China, Japan and North and South Korea.
   ``This is his initiative and it's his to pursue,'' the State
Department official said. ``As I say, we can see some merit in it,
but we have no intention of pushing it at this time.''
   As the visiting presidential party entered the White House, the
clashing of cymbals and beating of drums from an anti-Roh
demonstration in Lafayette Park, across Pennsylvania Avenue, could
be heard. The demonstrators changed ``Roh Tae-woo, Out, Out, Out.
U.S. Troops, Out, Out, Out.''

   Such fish as bass and lake trout would
flourish in Michigan, and the Great Lakes' shipping season would
lengthen if the greenhouse effect warms the Earth a few degrees, a
major federal study says.
   The ice season on Lake Superior would be shortened by one month
to three months, and on Lake Erie by two mohths to three months,
increasing shipping seasons there, said an unreleased Environmental
Protection Agency study that is to be submitted to the Congress in
December.
   The Associated Press obtained a draft of a summary of the
effects of global warming, which is caused by a growing
concentration of carbon dioxide and other gases that trap heat in
the atmosphere.
   The gases that cause the greenhouse effect are produced mainly
by the industries that have spread around the world since the
mid-19th century. Auto exhausts also contribute to the effect.
   While shipping could benefit, the higher temperatures likely
would reduce the snow pack in the Great Lakes region and increase
evaporation. That combination would reduce lake levels, possibly
necessitating dredging ports and channels, the study said.
   The water level of Lake Superior, on average, would be 1\ feet
to 1{ feet lower than now, and Lake Michigan's water level would
fall dramatically by 3 feet to 8 feet, the study said.
   The EPA study also said Michigan's hardwood forests might be
replaced by savannas and grasslands because of the greenhouse
effect, which would open Minnesota, Wisconsin and northern Michigan
to increased cultivation.
   The decline of the northern forests would become evident in 30
years to 60 years, the study said.
   The result by the middle of the 21st century will be an average
global temperature of three degrees to eight degrees Fahrenheit
higher than now, most scientists believe.
   ``Northern hardwood forests in Michigan may be reduced to oak
savannas or grasslands, and mixed boreal and northern hardwood
forests in northern Minnesota may become all northern hardwoods,''
the study said.
   The reduction in forests and increased cultivation in the north
could increase erosion and runoff, harming water quality, the study
said.
   And while some fish would thrive, a greater temperature
difference between the surface of the lakes and their depths might
reduce the amount of oxygen in the lower levels and disrupt the
annual turnover of the water, the study said.
   Fish species in shallow lakes and rivers could suffer from the
higher temperatures, the study said.
   A political effect of global warming might be increased demands
for a diversion of Great Lakes water for use outside the region,
the study said.

<TEXT>
   The political opposition, pressing for
policy changes that will lead to democratic reforms, is hoping that
President Augusto Pinochet's new Cabinet will have more power than
his previous one.
   All 16 members of Pinochet's Cabinet resigned on Thursday and
the 72-year-old general was expected to pick a new group of
ministers today.
   The sudden shakeup in Pinochet's authoritarian government came
the same day a magazine reported that Pinochet's aides tried to
delay news that Chilean voters had overwhelmingly rejected him in
the Oct. 5 referendum on his rule.
   The reports said the purported ploy to delay the vote returns _
and then give Pinochet new emergency powers _ were rebuffed by
members of Pinochet's military junta.
   Government secretary-general Orlando Poblete, a Cabinet member,
said Pinochet's Cabinet resigned Thursday to allow the president
``to select his people and take the steps he considers proper''
following his defeat.
   ``We have put our posts at his (Pinochet's) disposition,''
Poblete told reporters.
   Recent events ``make it necessary that he (Pinochet) adjust some
portfolios ... so that his team is in accord with the new stage the
country is in,'' Poblete said.
   Traditionally, the right-wing army commander has given little
authority to Cabinet members. But opposition leaders said they
hoped for a new interior minister with powers to negotiate.
   ``The key is who the new interior minister will be, and the
level of autonomy he will be given,'' Socialist leader Ricardo
Lagos said. ``We know of some people who were offered the job, and
who asked for a minimal autonomy and were rejected because of that.
   ``We don't want what happened in 1983,'' he added. That year,
faced with civil unrest and economic crisis, Pinochet named a new
interior minister to negotiate with the opposition. The talks
quickly failed, and later were interpreted as a stalling tactic by
Pinochet, who then declared a state of siege to crack down on
dissidents.
   Pinochet lost by 800,000 votes in the referendum, during which
voters were to vote yes or no on whether they wanted Pinochet to
continue as president until 1997.
   The morning after the vote his Cabinet handed in their
resignations but Pinochet rejected them, evidently needing time to
evaluate and pick replacements.
   Under the 8-year-old constitution, free elections are to be held
December 1989 and a president is to take power after Pinochet's
term expires in March 1990.
   A 16-party opposition coalition that led the campaign for
Pinochet's defeat has called for several reforms in the
constitution. It maintains changes are needed for full democracy
under the new elected government.
   In the two weeks since the vote, the coalition's leaders have
said they were waiting for a Cabinet change as a sign Pinochet was
willing to negotiate.
   Pinochet seized power in a violent 1973 coup that toppled the
elected civilian government of President Salvador Allende, a
Marxist.
   The Santiago weekly magazine Que Pasa reported Thursday that
Pinochet aides wanted to announce selective results of the Oct. 5
vote to give the impression Pinochet held a big lead, then launch
pro-government street celebrations that almost certainly would have
been violent.
   The magazine said the purported ploy was rebuffed at the last
minute by navy commander Fernando Matthei, national police chief
Rodolfo Stange and navy chief Jose Merino. The opposition daily La
Epoca reported a similiar account of the meeting on Sunday.
   On election night, the Interior Ministry's initial partial
returns _ less than one percent of the vote _ showed him leading.
There was then a delay of several hours before it released a
substantial tally showing his loss.
   Two days before the ballot, the U.S. State Department disclosed
it had information that pro-government forces might provoke
violence as an excuse to call off the vote or annul the results.

   Fame followed Eldridge Broussard Jr. out
of Watts and back, from basketball stardom to his once-praised
program to lift children out of the drugs and poverty of the Los
Angeles ghetto.
   Now his 8-year-old daughter is dead, allegedly at the hands of
staff members of Broussard's ultra-disciplinary program, and 55
other children are in protective custody.
   Oregon authorities say the children, who were kept in a sparsely
furnished four-bedroom farmhouse, were subjected to ritualistic
beatings of up to 800 strokes with a paddle or electrical cord. The
others were forced to watch and keep count, authorities also said.
   Yet such is Broussard's popularity that parents have made no
attempt to reclaim their children, even though the youngsters were
removed from the house a week ago, according to Children's Service
Division spokeswoman Alice Galloway.
   The parents display ``no lack of confidence in Eldridge
Broussard,'' she says. ``They trust him implicitly.''
   Broussard blames the media for his daughter's death and for the
downfall of his Ecclesia Athletic Association.
   He said negative publicity when Ecclesia arrived in Oregon last
year cost his group financial backing and led to suspension of its
activities a year ago. As a result, Broussard said, there were
fewer staff members, and some were performing duties they weren't
qualified for.
   The children, mostly from the Watts area of Los Angeles, were
kept in the farmhouse near Sandy, about 30 miles southeast of
Portland.
   On Oct. 14, four staff members took the body of Dayna Broussard
to a nearby fire station. She had been beaten and whipped, and died
of multiple blunt-force injuries, Medical Examiner Larry Lewman
said.
   That night, 53 children were taken from the house, where they
were sharing sleeping bags on the floor. Investigators said the
children, ranging in age from 1{ months to 16 years, had eaten only
a tomato apiece that day.
   Two other children involved with the group were taken into
custody in Los Angeles.
   The beatings were an integral part of the group's program to
heighten athletic performance, much like harassment used in
military training, said Donald Welch, director of the Clackamas
County Juvenile Court.
   In an appearance on Oprah Winfrey's syndicated television talk
show Thursday, Broussard denied that the children were beaten or
abused, saying they were only ``spanked.''
   He said standards of discipline in Oregon differ greatly from
those in Watts.
   ``In Watts, parents have seen brutality that would trip the mind
of the average American,'' he said. ``The people that are a part of
my school, when they see brutal, they see ears coming off, they see
giant huge lacerations.''
   Broussard, 35, was a basketball star at Pacific University in
Forest Grove, Ore., and was signed by the Portland Trail Blazers,
where he did not make the final cut.
   In 1975, he formed Ecclesia at his father's Watts Christian
Center in an effort to steer children away from drugs and crime and
to motivate them through tough discipline and athletics. Ecclesia's
members, about 80 adults and 80 children, renovated a rundown
gymnasium and formed a 32-team basketball league.
   The well-mannered children of Ecclesia won praise for their
discipline and sportsmanship.
   In a statement filed with the Oregon children's agency shortly
after his daughter's death, Broussard claimed children as young as
4 in his organization could run seven to 10 miles, do 5,000 jumping
jacks and 300 push-ups in just three hours.
   Broussard said in the statement that he was grooming Olympic
athletes and world-class entertainers.
   Six of Broussard's associates have been charged in his
daughter's death: four with manslaughter and two with hindering
prosecution. Broussard's brother Alvin was arrested for
investigation of child endangerment at the Watts center. Broussard
has not himself been charged.
   Longtime acquaintances say the former athletic standout is not
the same person they knew a decade ago.
   ``It was unbelievable,'' said Wally Scales, director of special
events for the Trail Blazers. ``He was the kind of kid you look at
and say, `Boy, when my kids grow up, I want them to be like him.'
... In retrospect, you look back and say, `Wow, what happened?'''
   ``It's like he took a real bad trip and never came back,''
Scales said.
   Broussard's 79-year-old father, Eldridge Broussard Sr.,
acknowledged that his son has changed, but said he sees nothing out
of the ordinary.
   The elder Broussard said he beat his sons and daughters as
children. ``A child wouldn't listen to you if punishment wasn't
behind it,'' he said.
   ``When they got too tough for a razor strap, I'd get a
connection cord,'' he said. ``You should see the welts on them.''

<TEXT>
   Rescuers frustrated by a delayed
icebreaking barge opted for a new plan to free three trapped
whales: using a helicopter to drop a 4{-ton concrete slab that
could punch a trail through foot-thick ice today.
   ``A large, wide lead has opened four miles from the whales.
That's the closest open water there's been yet,'' Ron Morris of the
National Marine Fisheries Service said Thursday. ``I just want to
take advantage of the situation.''
   Weather forecasts indicated that favorable winds would shift
over the weekend, probably shutting the pathways through the ice,
Morris said.
   Officials said they planned to have a giant Alaska Army National
Guard Skycrane helicopter lift the concrete ``crusher'' _ left over
from the construction of the trans-Alaska oil pipeline _ at first
light today. The trip was expected to take about two hours.
   The Guard has not abandoned its effort to tow the 185-ton
``hover-barge'' 230 miles to Barrow. But the two Guard Skycranes
that towed the barge Thursday have managed to move it just six
miles from the dock at Prudhoe Bay in two days.
   The tow was to have begun Monday, but was stymied by sub-zero
temperatures, darkness, mud, fueling and too much weight. And after
those problems were solved, the helicopters found the going tough
in the shallow, muddy bay just outside the oil field.
   By nightfall Thursday, a desolate stretch of more than 224 miles
remained between the barge and the whales.
   The California gray whales, whose species is endangered, were
trapped during their annual migration about 100 yards off the
treeless Arctic Ocean coast more than two weeks ago by the
constantly shifting ice pack. They have been breathing through
small air holes about 18 miles northeast of this Inupiat Eskimo
village.
   Volunteers have been using ice picks, chain saws and de-icers
donated by a Minnesota family business to enlarge the two original
holes and punch new ones in the ice.
   A new breathing hole was cut Thursday and a tarp was placed over
the largest of the original holes, said biologist Geoff Carroll of
the North Slope Borough.
   ``The whales came up in a hole they've never used before. That's
the first significant progress we've made in moving them, so I
think we'll go full bore on it,'' Carroll said as he headed for
another all-night vigil on the ice.
   The rescuers have recordings of killer whale calls and gray
whale mating calls to scare or lure the trapped whales toward the
open sea.
   The animals don't seem to be as lethargic as they were earlier
this week, Morris said. ``They look nice,'' he said. ``I have hope
that the whales will be around when we try to break through.''
   Even though the whales have been trapped for more than two
weeks, Morris still believes they have a 50-50 chance of making it
to their winter feeding grounds in the warm waters off Southern
California and Mexico.
   Biologists named the whales Bonnet, Crossbeak and Bone _ the
latter having much of its snout scraped away by the ice. Eskimos
have given them their own names: Siku (Ice), Putu (Icehole) and
Kanik (Snowflake).
   At a news conference Thursday, North Slope Borough Acting Mayor
Warren Matumeak said the borough is committed to freeing the
animals, even though Barrow is a whaling village.
   Gray whales are not normally harvested by the villagers, who
rely instead mostly on bowhead whales.
   ``No one has more respect for our native animals than the local
hunters, and we only take what we need to put food on our tables,''
Matumeak said.
   ``We do not like to see animals suffer, and we do not kill for
sport. These whales are suffering and need our help. We feel a duty
to do what we can and we'll see this effort through.''

<HEAD>Retired Boxer Says Helping Hospital Fight Drugs Is His Newest
Fight</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former heavyweight boxing champion Michael
Spinks says he has joined the fight against drugs as part of a
promise to himself to be as good a person as he was a boxer.
   ``I'm a human being first and an athlete second,'' Spinks said
Thursday after a new 22-bed drug detoxification unit at
Bronx-Lebanon Hospital Center was named in honor of Spinks and his
promoter, Butch Lewis.
   ``As I came up, all the rest of the guys I boxed around
portrayed bad images. They used their boxing abilities to outclass
those who didn't box,'' he said in an interview. ``I told myself
that if I ever mastered the art of boxing, I would never go around
boxing or beating on people who were unskillful.''
   Spinks, 32, last fought in July, when he was knocked out in 91
seconds by current heavyweight champion Mike Tyson.
   But the former Olympic gold medalist said he has found life
outside the ring to be the biggest fight of all.
   ``The fight never ends. ... The fight is the war on drugs, to be
the best dad I can be, the best son I can be to my mother,'' he
said.

<HEAD>Scientists Blame A Third Mass Extinction On Objects Striking Earth</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A comet striking Earth with the power of 300
million Hiroshima-sized atomic bombs may be the cause of mass
extinction 11 million years ago, say scientists who blame a bigger
blast for killing the dinosaurs eons earlier.
   The scientists' new study means that of nine mass extinction
episodes in Earth's history, three that occurred about 11 million,
38 million and 66 million years ago now have been linked to comets
or asteroids smacking into the planet.
   The highly controversial theory says such impacts kicked up dust
and triggered smoky fires that blocked enough sunlight to freeze
many creatures and deprive others of food supplies.
   Other new studies bolster support for rival theories that blame
mass extinctions on gigantic volcanic eruptions, on changes in sea
level or on global climate changes unrelated to objects smashing
into Earth.
   The studies are being presented at a four-day conference,
``Global Catastrophes in Earth History,'' which opened Thursday in
Snowbird, Utah.
   Scientists from Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory and the University
of California's Berkeley and Santa Barbara campuses performed the
study that suggests a comet or asteroid impact caused mass
extinction of about 25 percent of species 10 million to 11.7
million years ago. The team was led by Nobel Prize-winning
UC-Berkeley physicist Luis Alvarez, who died last month.
   In 1980, the Alvarez team found thin layers of the metallic
element iridium deposited around the world in 66-million-year-old
rocks, suggesting a comet or asteroid striking Earth killed about
two-thirds of all species, including dinosaurs, at the time.
   Iridium is viewed as evidence of such impacts because it is far
more common in extraterrestrial objects than in Earth rocks.
Iridium in a comet that hit Earth and exploded would have settled
from airborne dust.
   In the new study, two deposits of iridium were found in
10-million- to 12-million-year-old sea-floor rocks some 6,200 miles
apart: in the Weddell Sea near Antarctica and the Tasman Sea north
of New Zealand, said Frank Asaro, a nuclear chemist at Lawrence
Berkeley Laboratory.
   That suggests, but doesn't prove, that a comet or asteroids also
hit Earth and triggered extinctions at that time, he said.
   The researchers estimated the comet or asteroid would have
measured about 1.8 miles across and would have vaporized in an
explosion with 300 million times the power of the 13-kiloton atomic
bomb that destroyed Hiroshima at the end of World War II, Asaro
said.
   He said they estimate the 6{-mile-diameter comet that killed the
dinosaurs produced a blast 10 billion times more powerful than the
Hiroshima bomb.
   In 1982, Alvarez's team said iridium found in 37-million to
39-million-year-old rocks may have triggered a mass extinction of
about 25 percent of species on Earth at that time.
   Asaro said evidence that comet or asteroid impacts caused three
mass extinctions supports a more controversial hypothesis that
extinctions occur at roughly 26-million- to 30-million-year
intervals when comets are hurled toward Earth by the gravity of an
undiscovered companion star to the sun, nicknamed the ``Death
Star'' or ``Nemesis.''
   Other studies support the theory that huge volcanic eruptions in
India 66 million years ago blocked out sunlight and caused mass
extinction.
   A study by Florida State University scientists suggests
``shocked'' grains of quartz could have been produced by extremely
explosive eruptions. Others say the grains were created by a comet
smashing quartz rock. Another team of FSU and British scientists
said volcanic ash found in Weddell Sea rocks suggests volcanoes
caused the extinctions.
   Some fossil experts object to both comet and volcano theories,
arguing that mass extinctions occurred in a ``stepwise'' fashion,
with species disappearing at various times over a few million years
as the climate or sea level changed.
   ``Extinction patterns among vertebrates do not appear to be
attributable to any single cause, catastrophic or otherwise,'' said
a study prepared for the Snowbird meeting by J. David Archibald and
Laurie Bryant of San Diego State University.
   Other studies support a theory that stepwise extinctions
occurred because one or more comet impacts killed some species
immediately, then caused acid rain and global warming that killed
others.

<HEAD>Female Friar Barred From Borgnine Roast</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Friars Club has banished a female colleague
from an all-male roast for Ernest Borgnine, citing a time-honored
tradition despite a Supreme Court ruling against discrimination.
   Attorney Gloria Allred of Los Angeles said the club's executive
director, Jean Pierre Trebot, denied her request to purchase a
ticket Thursday because the event featured rough language and dirty
jokes.
   When she tried to enter the roast without a ticket, she was
pushed back by a man who refused to give his name but said he
represented the club.
   ``Why don't you act like a lady?'' he snarled.
   Ms. Allred, who joined the California Friars in May 1987, filed
a sex discrimination charge last year after she was barred from
having lunch in the New York club.
   She finally did dine at the club on Aug. 26 _ the day after the
U.S. Supreme Court upheld a New York City ordinance prohibiting
such discrimination. After the ruling, the club began admitting
some female members, including Liza Minnelli, Joan Rivers and
Brooke Shields.
   During her lunch at the club, Ms. Allred noticed the ``men
only'' roast flyer on the wall. She began a series of efforts to
attend.
   ``I'm here to do business. I'd like to have access to the
business contacts I could make here. This is a palace of power,''
said Ms. Allred. ``I will therefore file another charge of sex
discrimination against the New York Friars Club'' with the
commission.
   In a statement, the club said the men-only gatherings ``have
been an annual tradition of the Friars for the past 38 years. ...
The jokes are risque and the language usually quite spicy, as a
dais of celebrity comedians throw their barbs at the guest of honor.
   ``While we admire Ms. Allred's endeavors in the interest of
equal rights and ending discriminatory membership practices at
private clubs, we feel her efforts to attend this year's stag
luncheon are motivated by a desire to secure media attention for
herself.''
   ``The jokes are risque _ but that's not the real reason,'' said
Hal Karp, a singer and Friars Club member, who believes ``it is not
the general feeling of the members'' that women should be banished
from roasts.
   Luncheon-goers said comedian Buddy Hackett told the 1,300
members and guests that he had hoped Ms. Allred could attend so she
could hear the obscene joke he told about her.
   ``This is a roast. We say mean things about each other,''
Hackett added after the joke.
   Other entertainers listed on the program included Howard Cosell,
Norm Crosby, Henny Youngman, Richard Belzer and Foster Brooks.

<HEAD>New Interior Minister Named; Newsman The Party's Foreign Policy
Director</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet leaders have appointed a new interior
minister and named the head of an official news agency as director
of the Communist Party's newly organized foreign policy department.
   The television news program ``Vremya'' reported that the
Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, the nation's executive body, on
Thursday named Vadim V. Bakatin as interior minister, the nation's
top policeman.
   He succeeds Alexander V. Vlasov, who was made an alternate, or
non-voting, member of the party's ruling Politburo and premier of
the Russian republic in a major Kremlin shake-up Sept. 30.
   Officials also announced on Thursday that the head of the
government news agency Novosti, Valentin M. Falin, 62, has been
elevated to a new foreign policy post in the party apparatus.
   The job combines the responsibilities of two formerly separate
posts held by Anatoly F. Dobrynin and Vadim A. Medvedev.
   Falin will head the newly reorganized International Department
of the party's policy-making Central Committee, Foreign Ministry
spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov told reporters at a government
briefing.
   Bakatin assumes control of the vast national apparatus of the
uniformed police at a time when state-run media are issuing franker
reports about violent crime and the Criminal Code is being
redrafted.
   He will also be in charge of Soviet criminal investigators and
of special military units, called interior troops, charged with
keeping order within the country.
   Bakatin served as party first secretary in the Kemerovo region
of Siberia, east of Novosibirsk. He has been a member of the
party's policy-making Central Committee since March 1986.
   Falin served as Soviet ambassador to West Germany in 1971-1978
and was appointed chairman of Novosti on March 10, 1986.
   His departure left both official Soviet news agencies without a
chief. Sergei A. Losev, director of Tass, died this month. His
successor has not been named, and Gerasimov said Falin's old job
was now open.
   The International Department, previously headed by Dobrynin, was
responsible for relations with non-ruling Communist parties and
overall foreign policy. A separate Central Committee office dealt
with ruling Communist parties abroad.
   The two departments have been combined and the overall title is
the International Department, another Foreign Ministry spokesman,
Yuri A. Gremitskikh, said later in an interview.
   Gerasimov said Falin will report to Alexander N. Yakovlev, a key
ally of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. Yakelev was named in the
Kremlin shake-up to head a new foreign affairs commission of the
Central Committee.
   Dobrynin, a former longtime Soviet ambassador in Washington, was
retired at that time and Medvedev was elevated to the Politburo and
put in charge of ideology.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Morris Abram Leaving Top Jewish Posts</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Diplomatic Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It's been a long trail from a small town in
Georgia to the University of Chicago Law School, the presidency of
Brandeis University and partnership in a prestigious law firm in
New York.
   Now, at 70, Morris B. Abram, who started out in Fitzgerald, Ga.,
where there were a handful of struggling Jewish families, will step
down at the end of this month as chairman of the National
Conference on Soviet Jewry and the Conference of Presidents of
Major American Jewish Organizations.
   ``It's been a fruitful period,'' he said.
   Jewish emigration from the Soviet Union, one of Abram's concerns
in the two jobs, is on the rise. Through September, 11,238 were
granted exit visas. That is a big jump from the low point of 896 in
1984, but less than one-third of the 51,320 permitted to leave in
1979.
   That was the biggest exodus, and it came under the late Soviet
President Leonid I. Brezhnev, whose record on human rights
generally is considered below the standards set by his successor,
Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Abram is hopeful, nonetheless. He says there have been some
fundamental changes, especially in the United States. President
Reagan and Secretary of State George P. Shultz have made Soviet
Jewry ``a priority concern,'' Abram said in a telephone interview
from his Paul, Weiss law office in New York, ``causing other
governments to become associated with it.''
   Reagan and Shultz gave human rights what Shultz calls ``pride of
place'' on their agenda for the four U.S.-Soviet summits and the
dozens of meetings Shultz held with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
A. Shevardnadze.
   Shultz always began with the topic, putting it ahead, even, of
nuclear arms control.
   He and Reagan have elicited promises that political prisoners
would be freed and emigration rules revised and that there would be
reforms in the Soviet legal system.
   Shultz, receiving an award a few weeks ago from the Hebrew
Immigrant Aid Society, paid tribute to Abram, a regular visitor to
Shultz's office on the seventh floor of the State Department.
   ``He is my rabbi,'' Shultz said. ``You might say he has taken me
by the hand and led me around. You know how he is. He is very
gentle, and sort of suggests you do this and that, and persistent,
wise. He has been a wonderful person for me to get to know in this
job as secretary of state.''
   Indeed, Abram is soft-spoken, a trace of a quiet Georgia accent
remaining with him. But he can be tough.
   In a banquet speech in May 1987, in Budapest, where the World
Jewish Congress was holding its first meeting on communist soil,
Abram unleashed a sharp attack on the Soviet Union over its
treatment of Jews.
   He described Soviet Jewry as ``most miserable and dejected'' and
said only the existence of Israel had prevented 3 million from
disappearing ``down the memory hole of history.''
   Some delegates would have preferred a more diplomatic speech as
a way of nurturing relations between Jews and Eastern bloc
countries.
   Abram's commitment to human rights, however, is not subject to
challenge. In speaking of prejudice, he instinctively couples
mistreatment of blacks with anti-Semitism.
   Abram worked with Dr. Martin Luther King and helped negotiate
the black civil rights leader's release from an Atlanta jail after
a sit-in at Rich's department store in 1960.
   Seven years later, responding to an Abram appeal, King denounced
as ``immoral'' rumblings of anti-Semitism within the black civil
rights movement.
   ``It is used to divide Negro and Jew, who have effectively
collaborated in the struggle for justice,'' King wrote. ``It
injures Negroes because it upholds the doctrine of racism which
they have the greatest stake in destroying.''
   Abram said he got ``a pretty good insight'' into prejudice in
Fitzgerald in 1922 when the Ku Klux Klan sent an organizer to the
town. ``We're against niggers, Catholics and Jews,'' the organizer
told Sheriff E.J. Dormine, offering him the Klan's No. 1 card.
   The story had a happy ending. The sheriff, a fundamentalist
Baptist, considered Abram's father, Sam, his closest friend, and
turned the card down.
   ``The Klan leader said, `We're going to run you out of office.'
Sheriff Dormine told him: `The first time you commit any crime, I`m
going to run you out of town,''' Abram said. ``And he did.''

   British banks say they are prepared to lend $1.7
billion to the Soviet Union, primarily to help modernize the
country's light industry.
   The banks agreed on several proposals during trade talks with
Soviet officials, but no formal offer of the line of credit has
been made, Sir Michael Palliser, deputy chairman of Midland Bank
PLC, said at a news conference.
   Speaking for all banks involved, he said their representative
would make a formal proposal next week in Moscow.
   Bankers said 85 percent of the credit line would be backed by
the British government's Export Credits Guarantee Department.
   Konstantin Katushev, Soviet minister of economic relations, said
the British credit line, as well as other credit lines recently
established in West Germany and Italy, would be used primarily to
help modernize Soviet light industry.
   ``We have enterprises with equipment that don't meet modern
requirements, and we have enterprises which don't have enough
capacity,'' he said.
   Also Thursday, Katushev and British Trade Minister Alan Clarke
announced an agreement worth up to $30 million to manufacture light
commercial vehicles in the Soviet Union. They also announced a
separate deal for a joint venture on photocopying.
   Britain's International Automotive Design company will help the
Soviet foreign trade organization Avtopromimport design light
commercial vehicles for manufacture in the Soviet Union. The
vehicle will be directed at the Soviet market but may be exported
to the West, said Mike Goldsmith of the British firm.
   In the other deal, Rank Xerox will form a joint venture with the
Soviet state publishing group FTO Vnesghtorgizdat to open a
photocopying shop in Moscow for official and public use. The deal
is worth less than $1.75 million, a Rank Xerox official said.

   The economic reforms enacted under President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev have produced a new problem _ how do Soviet
statisticians measure inflation?
   Nikolai G. Belov, deputy director of the state committee on
statistics, said Thursday that his department hasn't figured out
how to measure the rise in the cost of living and therefore doesn't
know how serious inflation is in the Soviet Union.
   Belov, however, acknowledged that wages rose nearly twice as
fast as real income, indicating inflationary forces were at play in
the economy.
   Soviet officials traditionally have contended that inflation did
not exist in the Soviet Union, where wages and prices are
controlled by central planners.
   In other communist countries, including Yugoslavia, Poland and
China, attempts to ease central controls on the economy and permit
the establishment of a market pricing system have led to runaway
inflation.
   Fears of similar problems in the Soviet system may explain
Gorbachev's hesitation in implementing price reform, which he has
said is a critical element of his modernization program.
   Belov, speaking to reporters at a briefing, said his department
would begin calculating inflation next year.
   The closest he would come to offering a figure Thursday was to
say that while wages rose 6.7 percent in the first nine months of
the year, ``real income, including hidden price hikes,'' rose 3.5
percent.
   Prices are rising because some of the state enterprises suddenly
ordered to make a profit have simply substituted expensive products
for cheap ones, Belov said.
   Economic reform has also brought 1 million layoffs in the first
nine months of 1988, although he insisted all those who lost their
jos received new ones or were retired on pension. The government
says it does not permit unemployment.
   Cooperatives were the lone item of unqualified success in the
reform that some Western economists have predicted will bring the
problems of capitalism long before bringing its benefits.
   The private co-ops, where wages consist of shared profits, have
created 700,000 new jobs in the 18 months since they were
legalized, the figures showed.
   In the critical area of food supplies, Belov acknowledged the
Soviet Union is still a long way from being able to feed its people
without substantial imports.
   ``The production of food cannot now meet the demands of the
population,'' he said.
   Supplies reaching the stores, the most significant figure in a
nation where vast amounts of food rot in the field or on the road
to market, are rising but are still $2 billion short of needs,
Belov said.
   Many of Belov's statistics appeared glowing but meant little
without accounting for inflation. For example, he said industrial
production rose 10.2 percent, but he could not say how much was
simply higher prices for the same goods.
   Belov admitted ``an alarming trend'' of salaries rising more
than productivity, which Western economists would consider a danger
sign for inflation. Wages rose 6.7 percent while productivity
increased 5.2 percent the first nine months.
   On the farm front, Belov said grain production will be slightly
less than the past two years. Official figures indicate the harvest
produced 210 million tons of grain last year and 211 million tons
the year before, excellent by Soviet standards.
   Belov also said imports have risen 4.8 percent while exports are
unchanged. The Soviet Union has expanded purchases of Western
technology in hopes of modernizing its factories.

<TEXT>
   The dollar slipped against the Japanese yen in
Tokyo today, while stock prices rose slightly on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange.
   The dollar opened at 126.55 yen and stayed in a range of
126.20-126.75 yen in lackluster trading. The currency finished the
day's trading at 126.40 yen, down 0.75 yen from Thursday's close of
127.15 yen.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues gained 10.87 points, or 0.04 percent, to close at
27,401.42.
   Dealers said the bearish dollar in Tokyo reflected the
currency's poor showing in New York and London overnight.
   The decline in oil prices and doubt over the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries' ability to agree on production
limits also added to the dollar's downward trend, dealers said.
   ``There were not many negative incentives in Tokyo today,'' said
Yoshikazu Kotooge of Yasuda Trust Bank. ``The slight decline after
opening was due to heavy sales of the dollar by securities and
trust firms.''
   Dealers said they expect the dollar will remain at 126-yen level
because it was being bought back in the low 126's.
   Securities dealers attributed the strong performance of shares
on the Tokyo Stock Exchange to the 43.92-point gain in the Dow
Jones industrial average in New York overnight and the sense of
relief felt by market participants after the first anniversary of
the worldwide market crash on Oct. 19, 1987.
   ``The market finally got rid of the pressure after the crash
anniversary passed peacefully,'' said Mike Morizumi of Merrill
Lynch in Tokyo.
   Dealers also said the Japanese parliamentary debate on a new
capital-gain tax and a widening stock scandal involving
politicians' purchases of unlisted stocks is pulling share prices.
   They also said uncertainty caused by Emperor Hirohito's illness
was still hurting the market.
   ``Investors always hate uncertainties and stay away from them,''
said Merrill Lynch's Jeff Bahrenburg.

<TEXT>
   The leftist government sharply
restricted civil liberties with a vaguely worded state of
emergency, citing the threat of Hurricane Joan. Opposition figures
said the Sandinistas were using the storm for political ends.
   The 30-day state of emergency, signed Thursday by President
Daniel Ortega, suspends several articles of the constitution
guaranteeing freedom of expression. The full breadth of the decree
was not immediately known.
   The national emergency decree allows for censorship and
restricts all communications media from publishing or airing news
on Hurricane Joan unless it is given out by the presidency or
authorized sources.
   The decree also said the government could temporarily utilize
whatever resources needed to counter the effects of the hurricane.
That section was interpreted as meaning authorities could
confiscate anything from cars to buildings.
   The decree was announced as Joan, with heavy rains and winds
topping 100 mph, crept within 225 miles of Nicaragua's Atlantic
Coast. Thousands of people were evacuated Thursday from regions
near Bluefields.
   ``A state of emergency is decreed in all the national territory
in view of the threat of Hurricane Joan to Nicaragua,'' the decree
said.
   The decree said an article of the constitution was suspended
that said: ``Nicaraguans have the right to freely express their
beliefs in public or private, individually or collectively, in
oral, written or any other form.''
   The order also suspends an article that says: ``Nicaraguans have
the right to truthful information. This right compromises the
freedom to seek, receive and disseminate information and ideas, be
they spoken or written, in graphic or any other chosen form.''
   The government imposed a strict state of emergency law in 1982,
shortly after an escalation in the war with U.S.-backed rebels,
known as Contras. The restrictions, which barred public gatherings
and sharply limited expression and movement, were lifted in January
to comply with the August 1987 Central American peace plan.
   Opposition leaders denounced the new decree Thursday night.
   Enrique Sotelo Borgen, a member of the Conservative Party, said
in an interview that the law was a move by the government to assert
its control.
   ``The act by the Sandinista regime is suspect of political
repression,'' Sotelo Borgen said. ``They are taking advantage of a
possible catastrophe to impose absolute domination over the
public.''
   Luis Guzman, a member of the Popular Social Christian Party,
expressed similar sentiments. ``It's just to take advantage. There
is nothing that justifies 30 days,'' he said.
   The opposition leaders declined to speculate further on the
motives for the restrictions.
   Under existing law, the president can declare a state of
emergency in times of war, economic crisis and national catastrophe.

   China will restrict further industrial expansion
in agricultural areas to halt a loss of arable land that threatens
the nation's ability to feed itself, an official newspaper reported
today.
   Chen Ye, a senior official in the State Land Administration, was
quoted by the China Daily as saying a quota system will be adopted.
   Industries in such fields as mining, power generation, airports,
railways, oil wells and textiles will need special permission from
the administration for new projects using land exceeding their land
quotas, she said.
   Land and industry experts are now working out details of the new
system, she said.
   Only 10 percent of China's land is arable, and large chunks of
that disappear every year to industrial expansion. In 1985, 2.47
million acres were lost.
   According to Land Administration statistics, the nation now has
312.7 million acres of arable land, and that figure will drop to
247 million acres by the year 2050 at the present rate.
   The daily said China currently has 230 million acres under
cultivation.
   It said about 37 million acres of cultivated land have been lost
over the past 30 years. Meanwhile, China's population has grown by
an average of 13 million people a year since the founding of the
communist People's Republic in 1949.
   China's leaders have said the nation must produce about 500
million tons of grain annually by the year 2000 to keep up with
population growth and improving living standards. Output has
stagnated at 400 million tons or less each of the past four years,
a result of shrinking farmland and low state-set prices for grain
which have turned farmers toward more profitable crops.
   The daily also quoted a recent report in the China Environmental
Journal as saying 82.3 million acres of China's total land area
were damaged by soil erosion and 54 million acres were polluted.

   A single-engine plane that witnesses said
had faltered just before landing crashed into trees short of a
small airport and burned, killing four people, a fire official said.
   The plane crashed about 200 feet from Wings Field on Thursday,
narrowly missing two houses just south of Blue Bell in suburban
Philadelphia, officials said.
   The identities of the four who died aboard the Beechcraft Sierra
200 were not immediately known, said Steve Dolan, fire marshal for
the Whitpain Township Fire Department.
   Fred Berobkin, president of Pennsylvania Aviation, which owns
the airfield, said the dead were two couples. The flight had
originated in Rochester, N.Y., and one of the couples had planned
to get off at Wings Field, where relatives were waiting for them,
he said. The other couple planned to continue to Annapolis, Md.
   Dolan said investigators with the Federal Aviation
Administration would be at the site today.
   Mary Garrity, who lives about a quarter mile from the airfield,
said the plane sounded as if it were experiencing engine trouble
when it passed over her house.
   ``I looked right out this window and I saw the plane go,'' Mrs.
Garrity said. ``At the last minute, (the pilot) surged upward over
the house, thank God, but then hit the two great big pines and the
(electric) lines across the road.''

   Academy Award-winning actress Cher says she is
happy if her relationship with her 24-year-old boyfriend gives
women ``the courage to do the thing they might want to do.''
   In an interview in the December issue of Playboy magazine, Cher,
who won the Best Actress Oscar this year for her role in
``Moonstruck,'' said the last time she was involved with an older
man was 15 years ago.
   But the beginning of her relationship with aspiring actor Robert
Camiletti, 24, two years ago provoked anxiety for the actress.
   ``I felt I was starting to fall into a pattern of being only
with younger guys,'' said the 42-year-old actress and singer. ``I
thought that was maybe a fault or a weakness, something detrimental
in my character. Now I don't know that it's not and I don't know
that I care.''
   Cher said she does not feel she is a pioneer for women because
of her relationships with younger men, but she added:
   ``I'm really happy to give women the courage to do the thing
they might want to do. ... If they need someone to go before them
I'm happy to help.
   ``But I'm certainly not the first one who's been with younger
men _ Tallulah Bankhead, Sarah Bernhardt _ there've been lots of
women before me,'' she said.

<HEAD>Lamar Hunt Settles Silver Case for $17 Million</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An attorney says Peru's state-owned mineral
company views a $17 million check from Lamar Hunt as the ``first
installment'' from the three Hunt brothers, who a jury found
plotted to corner the world silver market.
   Minpeco S.A., the Peruvian minerals concern, has been unable to
collect any part of the $132.45 million jury award from Nelson
Bunker Hunt, 62, and William Herbert Hunt, 59, because they filed
for personal bankruptcy protection in Dallas late last month.
   The three brothers, all from Dallas and sons of the late oil
billionaire H.L. Hunt, were sued by Minpeco in federal court here.
   Minpeco lawyers said they would ask bankruptcy court in Dallas
today to unfreeze the Hunts' assets so Minpeco can pursue
collection efforts against them.
   Lamar Hunt, the 56-year-old owner of the Kansas City Chiefs
professional football team, paid the $17 million Thursday to settle
his part of the finding that the brothers tried to corner the world
silver market.
   Under the settlement's terms, the jury findings against Lamar
Hunt were dismissed by U.S. District Judge Morris E. Lasker, who
approved the agreement. Lamar Hunt's attorney, Paul Curran, told
Lasker his client was settling the matter because he ``wanted to
put an end to the very heavy legal and emotional costs of this
litigation.''
   Curran maintained the settlement did not alter Hunt's contention
that he did nothing wrong.
   Hunt, who attended the brief hearing in a nearly empty
courtroom, declined to comment, referring reporters to a statement
issued by his Kansas City, Mo., office.
   ``In spite of the fact that the claims against me were totally
unwarranted,'' the statement said, ``because of the uncertainties
of litigation and the substantial cost associated with further
proceedings, I made the business decision to put the litigation
behind me so that I can spend my time pursuing positive business
interests.''
   A lawyer representing about 17,000 investors who are suing the
Hunts and others in two large class-action suits complained to
Lasker about certain aspects of the settlement.
   Attorney Herbert Deutsch noted that under the settlement, the
Minpeco verdict against Lamar Hunt could not be used in the
class-action lawsuits and the allegations would have to be proven
all over again, effectively nullifying the 6{-month trial of the
lawsuit.
   But Lasker said he was pleased to approve the settlement.
   After the check was turned over, Minpeco attorney Mark Cymrot
said, ``We view this as the first installment payment by the
Hunts.''
   The filings last month by Bunker and Herbert Hunt under Chapter
11 of the federal bankruptcy law were intended to protect the
brothers' assets from creditors, including Minpeco, while they
reorganize their finances.
   Bunker Hunt was once considered the world's wealthiest man, with
an estimated worth of $16 billion in the 1960s.
   The federal jury found last August that the Hunts and other
investors were part of an unsuccessful scheme nine years ago to
corner the silver market.
   Minpeco had claimed it lost more than $100 million after the
silver market collapsed in March 1980.
   Before the trial began in February, Minpeco collected nearly
$64.7 million in settlements from other defendants including
Merrill Lynch & Co.; Prudential-Bache Securities and E.F. Hutton &
Co.

<TEXT>
   A Dominican priest who espouses a New Age
brand of Catholicism said a yearlong public silence imposed by the
Vatican is the act of an unhealthy institution that ``may even be
already dead.''
   The Rev. Matthew Fox, founder of the 11-year-old Institute for
Culture and Creation Spirituality, said he would abide by the
sentence of silence that begins Dec. 15 for as long as he could.
   But he lashed out at the Vatican, charging that its apparent
intolerance of his views were those of a patriarchal church
``already demonstrating the characteristics of a dysfunctional
family.''
   ``The promise of openness, of collegiality, of the trust of the
spirit operating among those working in the world, has been
forsaken (by the church) on behalf of a rigid authoritarianism,''
Fox said at a Thursday morning news conference.
   Fox said such an institution ``is no longer healthy. It may even
be already dead.'' He suggested the Catholic Church will die as an
institution unless it adopts democratic practices, adding that he
eventually may be forced to renounce his priesthood because of his
views.
   The internationally known author and lecturer said he will take
at least a six-month sabbatical, although his Dominican superiors
in Rome and Chicago recommended a minimum of one year. He will
travel to Latin America, but would not say what his plans would be
after that.
   Although reacting angrily to the order, Fox said he considered
it an honor that places him in the company of Galileo and Thomas
Aquinas, who were ordered silenced by the church in their lifetimes.
   The punishment from the Vatican's Congregation for the Doctrine
of Faith, headed by Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, prohibits the
47-year-old priest from preaching, lecturing or teaching. He can
write, but not publish.
   The Vatican called Fox's esoteric mix of Christian mysticism,
feminism and environmentalism ``dangerous and deviant teachings.''
   Those include criticisms of traditional church doctrine for an
``overemphasis'' on sin and redemption; calling God a ``Mother'';
endorsements of various forms of pantheism; and support for
homosexuals.
   Fox has said he favors optional celibacy for Catholic priests
and the ordination of women. Both are major deviations from the
Roman Catholic Church's positions.
   He also has irked conservative Catholics by hiring faculty
members who include a certified masseuse, a Zen Buddhist, a yoga
teacher and a self-described witch named Starhawk.
   The controversy over Fox's silencing may further strain
relations between some members of the U.S. church and Rome, some
Catholic officials indicated.
   Those relations already are tense because of Ratzinger's 1986
order to dismiss the Rev. Charles Curran from the Catholic
University faculty in Washington for holding views on sexual ethics
that deviate from traditional church teaching and Rome's
disciplining of liberal Seattle Archbishop Raymond Hunthausen for
apparent laxity in pastoral administration.
   The National Catholic Reporter, an independent paper that first
reported the silencing last week, said in an editorial in today's
editions:
   ``People cannot be told to stop thinking or recording their
thoughts. Silencing efforts come from another time.''
   The U.S. Dominicans have not condemned Fox. Instead, they
concluded after a special three-person commission reviewed his work
in 1984 that he was not a heretic, said the Rev. John Gerlack of
the order's headquarters in Chicago.
   ``The commission had minor criticisms, some suggestions that
things should be qualified or balanced, but in the end the
conclusion was there was not sufficient reason that he should be
condemned for heresy or condemned or silenced,'' Gerlack said.

   Suspected Sinhalese extremists
assassinated a ruling party politician and two police officers in
separate incidents today, Sri Lankan authorities said.
   The killings came a day after the government began a truce in a
bid to end Sri Lanka's political murders, police said.
   Tudor Keerthinanda, 55, of the policy-making Executive Committee
of the United National Party, was killed early today outside his
suburban Colombo home, said a police spokeswoman.
   Members of the extremist People's Liberation Front are believed
to have tossed a bomb into Keerthinanda's car, the spokeswoman
said. His wife and driver were critically injured.
   The extremist group opposes the peace accord aimed at ending the
5-year insurgency by Tamil rebels and restoring peace to the
ethnically divided island nation.
   The group has been blamed for more than 500 killings the past
year. Most victims have been members of the ruling party, security
personnel or political rivals.
   On Thursday, the government suspended military operations
against the group for one week and promised to release 788
political prisoners.
   Also today, two suspected Sinhalese gunmen killed a policewoman
waiting at a bus stop in Kadawatte, 15 miles northeast of Colombo,
police said.
   In Kegalle, 30 miles northeast of Colombo, a police inspector
was shot and killed at his home by suspected Front members, police
said.
   Sinhalese extremists contend the July 1987 peace accord signed
by India and Sri Lanka grants too many concessions to Tamil rebels
fighting for an independent homeland in the northeastern province.
More than 8,500 people have died in the separatist war.
   Tamil guerrillas also oppose the agreement. India sent an
estimated 47,000 troops to Sri Lanka to help put down the rebellion
and enforce the accord.
   Tamils, who are mostly Hindu, make up 18 percent of the island's
16 million people. They claim they are oppressed by the majority
Sinhalese, who comprise 75 percent of the population and control
the government and military.

   Nevada gaming officials are considering
whether to continue to allow slot machines that tempt gamblers by
appearing to just miss a jackpot.
   But an attorney for the machines' Japanese distributor said
Thursday the ``near-miss'' devices only make things more exciting.
   The 15,000 Universal Distributing video slots used in most
Nevada casinos randomly choose symbols on the lines being played,
but are programmed to show winning combinations on non-paying
lines. If a player puts two coins in a five-line machine, those
lines will come up with random spins, but the remaining three lines
can be programmed to show a jackpot.
   Although the near-miss machines have been banned in Atlantic
City, they have been used here for three years and are leading the
industry in the latest technology to make slot machines more
entertaining, Frank Schreck, an attorney for the company, said
Thursday.
   ``The company has made playing slot machines exciting again,''
Schreck said. ``There's nothing deceptive about it. This is what
gambling is about. Everybody knows that in the end, the odds are
they'll lose. But the possibility of winning makes it more
exciting.''
   The Nevada Gaming Commission is planning to review whether to
allow Universal to retain the near-miss feature on its 15,000
machines among Nevada's 100,000 slots. No date has been set for a
hearing on the issue.
   The review is part of a stipulation Nevada gaming officials and
Universal entered into last month following a complaint against the
company filed by the Nevada Gaming Control Board in April.
   The complaint said the Tokyo-based company was deceptive in
allegedly hiding the near-miss feature from gaming regulators when
the machines were approved in 1985.
   Schreck said the feature was described in the documents filed
with Nevada but officials ``obviously didn't study all the
information we gave to them.''
   New Jersey officials, however, did review the near-miss computer
program in that state's slot machine lab and outlawed it.
   ``It was to entice the player to play more lines,'' explained
Anthony Parrillo, director of the New Jersey Division of Gaming
Enforcement.
   Last year, Universal's video slot machines were allowed into
Atlantic City, but without the near-miss program, he said.
   Nevada Gaming Control Board Chairman Mike Rumbolz said the board
had not taken an official position on the slots and a final
determination on the near-miss feature's use would be up to the
commission to decide.
   New Jersey's Parrillo has said his staff tipped Nevada's gaming
officials to Universal's near-miss program, but both Universal and
Nevada gaming regulators have denied that.
   ``We discovered it through continuing testing in our
laboratory,'' Rumbolz told the Atlantic City Press.

<HEAD>Suspects To Lose Right To Remain Silent Under Police Questioning</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Leads with 7 grafs to UPDATE with comment from Sinn Fein and
Irish Republic; picks up 6th graf `The government ...</NOTE>

   Critics are denouncing the government's proposal
to scrap a crime suspect's right to remain silent, a legal maneuver
aimed at battling the Irish Republican Army and other Northern
Ireland guerrilla groups.
   ``The government will not defeat terrorism by taking away one of
the few remaining safeguards in Northern Ireland's justice
system,'' Sarah Spencer, general secretary of Britain's National
Council for Civil Liberties.
   The plan to remove the centuries-old right to silence was
announced Thursday in the House of Commons by Northern Ireland
Secretary Tom King, the Cabinet member responsible for the province.
   The government of the Republic of Ireland said in a statement
that it was worried at the implications of the move to end the
right to silence for the administration of justice in Northern
Ireland.
   Paddy McManus, legal affairs spokesman for the IRA's legal
political party Sinn Fein, said King's announcement moved Britain
closer into line with South Africa and Chile, both widely condemned
for human rights abuses.
   The government also hinted Thursday that it may make candidates
for elections in the province take an oath renouncing violence.
   On Wednesday, the government imposed a ban on television and
radio interviews with the IRA and 10 other militant Northern
Ireland groups, including four Protestant organizations, to deny
the guerrillas what it said was a propaganda platform.
   The government said Thursday it plans to introduce legal changes
by 1990 to impose similar restrictions on the right of suspects to
remain silent in England and Wales. Scotland is unaffected, at
least at present, because it has its own legal system.
   Like the broadcast ban, the new measure was part of a security
package promised by the government after a surge in killings and
bombings by the mainly Roman Catholic IRA since spring.
   The IRA is fighting to end British rule in predominantly
Protestant Northern Ireland and unite it with the predominately
Catholic Republic of Ireland under socialist rule. Protestant
militants oppose all suggestion of unity with the Republic.
   King's announcement was contained in what is known as a draft
order in council presented to the Commons. Under present law, the
right of suspects under police questioning to remain silent cannot
be used against them at trials.
   Under King's draft order, which must be approved by Parliament
to become law, suspects will still be able to stay silent under
police questioning if they wish.
   But the order proposes to allow courts in future ``to attach
whatever weight they think proper to the fact that someone remained
silent when questioned.'' That means prosecution lawyers for the
first time will be able to draw attention to a suspect's silence as
a possible indication of guilt.
   The draft order will be debated by Parliament next month. The
government's 101-seat majority in the 650-seat Commons guarantees
its passage and it is expected to become law next year.
   King told reporters: ``Members of terrorist organizations are
being trained to refuse to respond to questions put by the police _
and this technique is increasingly being adopted by those suspected
of serious crimes, including racketeering. ... Justice is being
thwarted.''
   Opposition Labor Party deputy leader Roy Hattersley said the
right to silence was ``an essential element of a free society.''
   Labor's Northern Ireland spokesman, Kevin McNamara, said,
``Northern Ireland is being used as a laboratory for draconian
measures to be used later in other parts of the United Kingdom.''

   The world champion Los Angeles Dodgers
returned home today amid shouts of ``We're No. 1'' from some 1,000
boisterous fans after defeating the Oakland Athletics in the World
Series in five games.
   The fans met the Dodgers at Los Angeles International Airport at
12:45 a.m., a little more than four hours after the team clinched
the major league baseball championship by beating the A's, 5-2, in
Oakland.
   Pitcher Orel Hershiser, the Series' most valuable player, was
briefly mobbed by hundreds of fans.
   ``For the team to come this far is a dream come true,'' said
Hershiser, who won games two and five of the series. ``I know the
whole city is behind us. There's a great love affair with an
underdog.''
   Hershiser, who pitched a four-hitter to lead the injury-riddled
Dodgers to the best-of-seven championship, allowed just five earned
runs in his final 101 innings.
   The Dodgers, crippled by injuries to Kirk Gibson, Mike Marshall,
Mike Scioscia and John Tudor, took over the final game with two-run
homers from Mickey Hatcher and Mike Davis that made it 4-1 by the
fourth inning.
   It was the sixth World Series championship for the Dodgers.

   A 21-year-old man being held on charges he
threatened Vice President George Bush's life has bought at least
six guns and read books by mass murderer Charles Manson, Secret
Service agents testified.
   U.S. Magistrate Stewart Elliott ruled Thursday that David Allen
Russell was a threat to himself and others and should not be
allowed to go free on bond.
   Russell waived his right to a preliminary hearing, and was
returned to the Daviess County Detention Center in this northwest
Kentucky city.
   Secret Service Agent Don Bell testified that Russell had
confessed to mailing two letters to President Reagan threatening
the Republican presidential nominee's life.
   ``If he wins, he will be executed and his blood will be on your
hands,'' said Bell, reading from the second letter.
   The agent said the second letter reached the White House on Oct.
14, about a 1{ weeks after the first one.
   Russell was arrested Tuesday at the home he shares with his
mother, Beatrice.
   He is charged with threatening to take the life of or to inflict
bodily harm upon the vice president, and sending a threatening
letter through the mail.
   No charges have been filed in connection with the second letter.
U.S. Attorney Joseph M. Whittle said a federal grand jury meeting
in Louisville on Nov. 7 will determine whether additional charges
should be filed.
   Bell and Secret Service Agent Michael Richardson described
Russell as a man who had never been employed and who had for the
past 10 years been interested in assassination accounts.
   Bell said Russell told him he had read books by Manson, and that
the young man has bought at least six guns, most of them in the
past year.
   The agents said they believed Russell would flee if freed on
bond.
   The first letter was mailed to Reagan on Sept. 29, two days
after Bush addressed thousands at a rally in Owensboro's English
Park.
   ``I hope Bush feels his life is more inportant than the
presidentcy (sic),'' the letter said. ``I didn't use my pistol this
time. I will next time.''
   Russell said he had carried a concealed .45-caliber
semi-automatic pistol loaded with six rounds to the rally, Bell
said.
   Defense attorney Richard Flaherty argued that his client has no
past criminal record and was no threat to society.
   He described Russell as a young man who never learned to drive
and who lived at home, taking care of his mother, who is dying of
cancer and has a heart condition.

<HEAD>Hussein Encouraged by Peres Proposal on Palestinian Crisis</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jordan's King Hussein says he is encouraged by a
proposal from Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres that could
revive possibility of an international conference aimed at solving
the Palestinian crisis.
   ABC television reported Thursday night that Peres, who is
running for prime minister, has proposed to Hussein that Jordan and
the Palestine Liberation Organization form a joint delegation for
the proposed conference.
   Hussein, interviewed from Jordan by ABC's ``Nightline'' program,
said he regarded the proposal ``to be interesting, to be a step
forward, much more clear than any previous positions, and is thus a
welcome development.''
   ``However, I cannot at this point in time say that Jordan is in
any position to alter its position or stance. Of course, we have
made it abundantly clear and would repeat that again now that we
are prepared, if the Palestinians seek it ... to go to an
international conference in a joint delegation ... which represents
the people of Palestine.''
   The Israeli-occupied West Bank formerly was ruled by Jordan and
Jordan had continued to pay the salary of civil servants there
after Israel occupied it in 1967.
   However, Hussein in August severed Jordan's ties with the West
Bank. The move was seen as a blow to Israeli moderates who had
welcomed Jordan's attempts to moderate the PLO's more radical
stance.
   Asked whether he had actually agreed to take part in a joint
delegation with the PLO, Hussein said, ``There have been no
contacts or discussions in any detail. There was an outline of
their position and I am responding to it by showing our readiness.''

<HEAD>Beauty School and Its President Charged in Student Loan Abuse</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The president of Wilfred beauty schools and
18 employees have been charged with abusing federal student
financial aid programs by duping young people out of their funds,
forcing many to drop out broke.
   Wilfred American Educational Corp., President Philip E. Jakeway
Jr., and 18 loan officers, counselors or other employees were
indicted Thursday on charges of falsifying loan and grant
applications and misapplying funds.
   The indictments of the New York-based publicly held corporation,
which operates Wilfred Academies of Hair and Beauty Culture in 10
states, culminate 3-year investigations in Orlando, St. Petersburg
and Tampa.
   Though they have no firm dollar figure in the alleged abuse,
federal prosecutors said the scheme to defraud the U.S. Department
of Education could total in the millions. Wilfred students receive
some $75 million a year in federal educational entitlement funds,
they said.
   Jakeway and the corporation are charged with 28 counts of making
false statements, 27 counts of stealing, embezzling or misapplying
funds either provided or insured by the Education Department, eight
counts of wire fraud and a single count of operating a racketeering
enterprise.
   A young person studying to be a cosmetologist or beautician can
receive $2,500 in aid a year toward tuition and expenses at a
Wilfred school. But investigators said money frequently didn't
reach the applicant and went instead into a large pool operated by
Wilfred.
   Teen-agers unfamiliar with filing forms were told to sign blank
applications and false information was added later, or they were
induced to lie to ensure government aid, said James B. Thomas Jr.,
the Department of Education's inspector general.
   Students wound up in debt and eventually dropped out, he said.
   Investigations are being conducted elsewhere, authorities said
without disclosing where.
   Thomas said eight employees previously pleaded in a similar case
in Boston.

   A severe storm lashed southern
Bangladesh and battered coastal cities with high waves, and as many
as 1,500 were missing, news reports and witnesses said today.
   The storm, packing 75 mph winds and 15-foot waves, hit coastal
cities on the Bay of Bengal early Wednesday. It knocked down
thousands of mud-and-straw houses, snapped power lines and
overturned fishing boats and trawlers, the reports said.
   One person was killed and more than 1,000 were injured,
according to police and news reports.
   ``We had not prior bad weather warning. It came all of a
sudden,'' one resident, Abdul Mannan, told the Bengali-language
daily, The Dainik Bangla.
   The government-run newspaper said at least six trawlers carrying
40 fishermen sank off the town of Cox's Bazar early Wednesday. All
40 were missing and feared dead, it said.
   Mohammad Kamal, administrator of Cox's Bazar district, said in a
telehpone interview that 20 boats with 200 fishermen on board were
missing.
   ``We have so far no report of any death, though there is little
chance of survival in a storm like this,'' he said.
   Ekrumul Huda Chowdhury, president of Cox's Bazar Fishermen's
Association, said that more than 165 boats carrying more than 1,500
people were missing.
   One witness, Nabi Hossain, said many probably drowned.
   ``I have not seen such a disaster in my whole life,'' Hossain
told The Dainik Bangla.

<TEXT>
   The United States has paid $28.8 million
in back dues, but a U.N. spokesman says the American government
still owes the United Nations $570 million.
   The United States has withheld payments to try to force the
United Nations to adopt budgetary and administrative reforms.
   President Reagan announced Sept. 13 he was satisfied with
progress on the reforms and approved the release of $188 million _
$44 million for the last fiscal year and $144 million for the one
beginning Oct. 1.
   Two other payments have been made since Reagan's announcement _
$15.2 million in September and $85.6 million Oct. 14.
   That leaves $58.4 million still outstanding of the amount
Washington has promised, and more than $500 million more in back
payments, including those designated for the peacekeeping missions
and specialized agencies.
   The General Assembly's fiscal committee is to take up the budget
issue in December. A subcommittee recommended the austerity budget,
which also limits emergency spending, last month.
   Fred Eckhard, the U.N. financial spokesman, has said timely
payments by the United States are necessary if the organization is
to pay for new peacekeeping operations in the Persian Gulf and
possible missions in South-West Africa, Western Sahara and Cambodia.

   Former Philippines President Ferdinand Marcos,
facing an expected federal indictment today, was confident as he
discussed his fate with his lawyers and does not expect to go to
jail, a spokesman said.
   ``He's in a very relaxed mood,'' Marcos spokesman Arturo Aruiza
said Thursday from Marcos' hillside home. ``He's the same president
I see every day. We are used to hard times. ... They have had
harder times that this.
   ``I don't see anybody or any person going to jail right away,''
Aruiza added.
   Aruiza said Marcos' wife, Imelda, reacted more emotionally to
the news that U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giulani in New York plans to
seek charges of racketeering and fraud against the Marcoses for
allegedly diverting huge sums of stolen money to their own use
after fleeing to the United States in 1986.
   ``Imelda, she's a little more, uh, you know ... The president is
a lawyer and he takes things a little more'' matter of fact, Aruiza
said.
   Marcos and his wife allegedly embezzled the money to buy real
estate in New York and other personal property, according to an
opinion Wednesday by a three-judge panel in a matter relating to
the Marcos probe.
   The indictments were expected today, federal sources said.
Aruiza said Marcos would not issue a statement until after the
indictments were handed down.
   Marcos consulted all day with his lawyers, including
Washington-based attorney Richard Hibey, said Aruiza, who would
offer no details of their talks.
   Hibey refused to discuss the case.
   Aruiza said Marcos would not plea bargain with the U.S.
government because he had committed no crime.
   A steady stream of traffic _ every car confronted by a crowd of
journalists _ traveled Thursday night through the guarded gate of
Marcos' home, which overlooks the ocean and downtown Honolulu. None
of the occupants spoke to journalists.
   Three men, one wearing an U.S. Air Force uniform, in a car
marked by a state Department of Transportation sticker also refused
to identify themselves. But Aruiza said they were simply friends on
a social call.
   ``I promised I wouldn't say who they are,'' Aruiza said.
``They're here on a social visit,'' adding that the Marcoses had
many calls from well-wishers.

   A meeting of 320 emerging Soviet and U.S.
leaders this winter will include talks on superpower relations, the
environment and other serious issues, as well as fun such as the
Army-Navy football game, organizers say.
   Organizers said Thursday they hope the U.S.-U.S.S.R. Emerging
Leaders Summit here Dec. 1-7 will produce joint ventures and
friendships that will strengthen bonds between the two superpowers.
   ``To us, it's not enough to say there's simply room for
understanding,'' said Stephen Hayes, president of the Columbus,
Ind.-based American Center for International Leadership, which is
co-sponsoring the gathering with the Soviet Union's Committee of
Youth Organizations.
   ``We want to use this conference as a vehicle to develop some
very longlasting, as close to permanent as we can, dialogue and
agreements that will be very, very difficult to reverse,'' Hayes
told a news conference at Independence Hall.
   Alexander Kondyakov of the Committee of Youth Organizations said
the meeting of 160 U.S. leaders and 160 Soviets 28 to 40 years old
would build on the three summits between Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev and President Reagan. The meeting has been endorsed by
both governments.
   According to a tentative conference schedule, the delegates will
form groups of 20 to discuss such topics as U.S.-Soviet relations,
the military, religion, government, business and the arts.
   The participants will hear from U.S. and Soviet experts and
high-level officials, including Gorbachev via satellite and,
organizers hope, the U.S. president-elect.
   The cultural and social schedule includes the Army-Navy classic
and a Philadelphia musical tribute starring Peter Nero and the
Philly Pops and jazz musician Grover Washington Jr.
   The Soviet delegation will arrive in Chicago from Moscow on Nov.
29 and spend two days there with host families before flying to
Philadelphia. After the seven-day summit, the Soviets will go to
Washington for four days of meetings and sightseeing.
   Among those slated to be in the Soviet delegation are cosmonaut
Svetlana Savitskaya, the first woman to walk in space and M.
Borisyuk, deputy secretary of the Communist Party committee of the
Chernobyl nuclear power station, site of the world's worst nuclear
accident.
   Other Soviet delegates include a bardic singer, a movie director
and a cantor at the Moscow synagogue.
   Americans already chosen include U.S. Reps. Tim Penny, D-Minn.,
and Curt Weldon, R-Pa.; DePauw University President Robert Bottoms;
and Michael Oppenheimer, a scientist with the Environmental Defense
Fund.
   Other Americans will include the director of the Minneapolis
Children's Theater, and U.S. Naval Academy professor and a research
fellow at the Hoover Institution.
   The budget for the summit is $700,000. The money will come from
the foundation and corporations, although the U.S. Information
Agency may help pay for interpreters, said Hayes.

   Ask the kids at Highland Park
Elementary School to pick up your tab, and they'll do it gladly.
   Two years after some 270 students began collecting pull-tabs
from aluminum beverage containers, that collection should hit the
million mark this month.
   ``It just kept growing,'' said school secretary Carolyn Thrams.
``It's unbelievable the interest that people took in this.''
   Hospitals, bowling alleys and park workers joined in. Then a
bowling alley in Billings, 146 miles away, began saving the tabs.
Eventually, the students got tabs from Louisiana, Texas,
California, Ohio, Washington, Nebraska, the Dakotas, Wyoming and
Idaho.
   The school plans to sell the tabs for recycling and split the
proceeds with the Holy Rosary Hospital pediatrics ward and Miles
City's public library. Ms. Thrams said she expects a net of about
$1,000.
   School officials will have the tabs on display Monday and
Tuesday on a tarp in the gym. A school assembly Tuesday will
include discussions of how to use them and mathematical exercises
such as estimating their weight and how far they would reach, end
to end.
   During the collecting process, students counted the tabs in
batches of 1,000 and dumped them in several barrels, Thrams said.

   Adrienne, a 600-pound sow sentenced to
become sausage, was granted a reprieve when a ``Save the Pig''
campaign allowed her to become a permanent exhibit for
schoolchildren.
   Dale Engquist, superintendent of the Indiana Dunes National
Lakeshore, made the decision after receiving petitions bearing 300
signatures asking that Adrienne be spared.
   The announcement means Adrienne will remain a permanent resident
of the lakeshore's Chellberg Farm, a National Park Service working
exhibit that is popular among schoolchildren.
   Lakeshore personnel work the farm much as the Chellberg family
did at the turn of the century. Because of that, Adrienne was
scheduled to be sold and butchered.
   When Adrienne's fans found out about it, they began an emotional
``Save the Pig'' campaign that included the petition drive.
   ``All the kids are going to be so happy,'' said Susie Cutler, a
Chicago attorney who spearheaded the campaign. ``We're very happy
that the park could accommodate Adrienne and listened to all the
people who cared about her.''
   Engquist said the lakeshore's ``Revised Hog Plan'' calls for
Adrienne to remain at the farm as an exhibit to demonstrate how
large a pig can get.
   ``All you have to do is stand there and watch both youngsters
and adults gasp when they go up (to Adrienne) and see how big a pig
can be,'' Engquist said.

a new agreement on U.S. bases in the Philippines said today that
the United States should have paid more to keep its garrisons on
Philippine soil.
   Raul Manglapus, who returned to Manila today after signing the
agreement in Washington four days earlier, said he was ``sorry that
not all the issues put on the table were resolved,''
   Manglapus cited as unresolved the issues of Filipino criminal
jurisdiction over the 40,000 U.S. troops and dependents based in
the islands and Philippine control over American military
operations launched from the bases.
   Later, Manglapus briefed President Corazon Aquino on the
agreement. No statement was issued after the closed-door session.
   About 3,000 people rallied today in a downtown square to protest
the bases accord and the recent slaying of a leftist labor leader
on Mindanao island. The crowd carried banners denouncing the
agreement as a ``sellout'' and demanded the bases be closed.
   A statement by the left-wing New Patriotic Alliance, distributed
during the march, urged the public to ``make known their opposition
to the new agreement.''
   The agreement, signed Monday by Manglapus and Secretary of State
George Shultz, allows the bases to remain until 1991 in return for
$962 million in aid over the final two years of the accord.
   Manglapus said the Filipino panel initially asked for $2.3
billion a year as well as other concessions that were not granted.
   Asked if he was satisfied with the agreement, Manglapus replied:
``No. We should have gotten $2.3 billion (a year).''
   ``But our committee recognized you have a maximum and a minimum.
We got the minimum,'' he said.
   Monday's accord amended the 1947 Military Bases Agreement, under
which the United States maintains Clark Air Base, Subic Bay naval
base and four smaller installations.
   The original agreement expires on Sept. 16, 1991. After that,
any extension must be by formal treaty approved by two-thirds of
the 23-member Senate, where opposition to the bases is strong.
   Mrs. Aquino has not said whether she will support an extension.
   The United States has been paying $180 million a year for use of
the bases, America's largest in Southeast Asia.
   Despite the increase, there has been widespread public
disappointment with the compensation because the government
repeatedly promised to hold out for a significantly higher figure
than it eventually accepted.
   Critics said the outcome of the talks, which began April 5,
would increase opposition to the bases among the 56 million
Filipinos.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Emperor Hirohito broke out in a rash while
receiving blood today, forcing doctors to halt the transfusion, but
palace spokesmen said his condition remained stable and no signs of
internal bleeding were reported.
   ``Doctors had planned to give the emperor 0.42 pints of blood,
but stopped at 0.32 pints as the emperor developed a rash,''
Imperial Household Agency spokesman Kenji Maeda told reporters.
   He said the doctors believe the rash, which soon went away, was
a reaction to incompatible elements in the blood and would not
affect future transfusions.
   The 87-year-old emperor seemed to be in good spirits and
conversed with several family members who visited him during the
day, said an agency source who requested anonymity.
   ``The transfusions seem to be improving his anemia,'' the source
said.
   Though no discharge was reported today, Hirohito has passed a
small amount of blood from his bowels each day for the past six
days. On Wednesday he coughed up blood for the first time since his
condition worsened on Sept. 19.
   Today's transfusion brought the total amount of blood the frail
emperor has received in the past month to 23.12 pints, about three
times the normal amount in his body.
   Palace officials have said doctors suspect past internal
bleeding has come from the area of Hirohito's upper intestine.

   Police charged a huge crowd at a Hindu
festival in the eastern state of Bihar, setting off a stampede that
killed at least 14 people, including 10 children, news reports said.
   Sixty others were injured, 20 seriously, in the incident
Thursday, the United News of India news agency reported.
   The stampede occurred in the town of Jamshedpur, 715 miles
southeast of New Delhi.
   The news agency said police were trying to control a crowd that
gathered to view the immersion of idols of the Goddess Durga in the
adjoining Subarnarekha River.
   The immersion is the culmination of the 10-day Dussehra
festival, in which nine nights are spent in worship of the Hindu
Goddess and the tenth day is spent in celebration.
   Idols are put up for community worship and are immersed in the
nearest river at the end of the festival.

<HEAD>Earthquakes Hit Parts of Calif., New England; No Damage, Injuries
Reported</HEAD>
<HEAD>By The Associated Press</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Two mild earthquakes hit northern California while a moderately
strong temblor a continent away jarred parts of Maine and New
Hampshire, but authorities in both regions reported no injuries or
damage.
   The Weston Observatory in Weston, Mass., said the New England
quake measured 4.0 on the Richter scale, enough to cause moderate
damage, and the U.S. Geological Survey in Menlo Park, Calif., said
the temblor measured 3.9 on the Richter scale. Walter Anderson,
director of the Maine Geological Survey, said the difference in the
two readings could be regarded as insignificant.
   ``It shook the whole house. Pictures on the wall, everything in
it went flopping back and forth,'' said 78-year-old Leo Perron, a
resident of Berlin, N.H., near the quake's epicenter.
   ``I thought it was a load of lumber falling,'' said Sandy
Endicott, a secretary at P.H. Chadbourne & Co. lumber yard in
Bethel, Maine.
   Thursday's quake struck at 9:09 a.m. and was centered five miles
northeast of Berlin, the Weston Observatory said.
   Authorities said rumblings and booms were reported all the way
from central New Hampshire to Yarmouth on the Maine coast, to
Augusta in the south-central part of Maine.
   Police in Berlin received more than 100 telephone calls Thursday
morning after the quake, but no reports of damage.
   In California, one quake, measuring 3.9 on the Richter scale,
occurred near the Geysers area about 50 miles north of San
Francisco about 10:30 a.m. Thursday, the University of California
Seismographic Station at Berkeley reported.
   The other, with a 3.3 magnitude, occurred near Garberville,
about 180 miles north of San Francisco, about 4:20 p.m., according
to the seismographic station.
   Sheriff's departments in Sonoma and Humboldt counties and the
state Office of Emergency Services said there were no reports of
damage or injuries.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by ground motion recorded on a seismograph.
   A quake of magnitude 2 is the is the smallest normally felt by
humans. A quake of magnitude 3.5 can cause slight damage, and a
quake of magnitude 4 can cause moderate damage. Every increase of
one number means a tenfold increase in magnitude, a reading of 4.5
reflects an earthquake 10 times stronger than one of 3.5. The San
Francisco earthquake of 1906, which occurred before the Richter
scale was devised, has been estimated at 8.3.

<HEAD>U.S. Official Says Economic Change Sweeping Eastern Europe</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SALLY JACOBSEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bulgaria's communist government plans
to sell shares of its public-owned enterprises to foreign investors
as part of the widespread economic changes sweeping Eastern Europe,
a U.S. official says.
   Deputy Secretary of State John Whitehead said that during his
trip to Bulgaria, President Todor Zhivkov disclosed plans to turn
government-owned enterprises into corporations that will offer
stock to their employees and other investors.
   ``Marx would have turned over in his grave if he could have
heard Comrade Zhivkov talk that way,'' Whitehead told reporters
after discussing his six-nation trip with officials of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization in Brussels.
   German economist Karl Marx developed the doctrine that the state
should control production for the benefit of the workers, a theory
on which the communist economies have been based.
   Bulgaria has traditionally been the Soviet Union's most loyal
satellite in Eastern Europe and changes there likely reflect Soviet
approval.
   Whitehead said, ``There is change everywhere in Eastern Europe,
that is the key word of my conclusions: economic change, political
change and social change.''
   The changes, he said, are occurring most rapidly in Hungary and
Poland, less so in Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria and East Germany and
hardly at all in Romania.
   The new initiatives, he said, are bringing more democracy,
pluralism, free-market economies and decentralization to those
countries.
   He said, ``Bulgaria is moving on a rapid course of change in a
very sound way, particularly economic change. There is less
political change but I think that that will follow and there is
even less change in their human rights performance but I think that
that will follow.''
   He said he met with Zhivkov for five hours earlier in the week
and was told about the new law on public enterprises that will go
into effect on Jan. 1.
   ``Those corporations,'' he said, ``will become stockholder
corporations like our Western stockholder corporations and ...
employees will be able to buy shares in the corporation that they
work in.''
   Whitehead singled out Romania for sharp criticism as he did
earlier in his travels.
   ``It's very hard to find any bright spots in Romania,'' he said.
   He said he was ``appalled'' by a trip he made to see the razing
of villages carried out as part of a land reform program by
President Nicolae Ceausescu's government.
   He said villagers were being removed from their homes to live in
``barracks-like, bleak public housing buildings ... with no running
water, no bathrooms and very tiny quarters for each family.''
   ``It's an outrageous violation of the rights of the Romanian
people to have that practice,'' he said, adding, ``The world should
let him (Ceausescu) know how they feel about this.''

<HEAD>New Computer `Virus' Found In Software Company's Programs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A computer ``virus'' has infected programs at a
leading software publisher for the second time in eight months
despite efforts to prevent a recurrence, officials say.
   The virus, which turned up in a version of Aldus Corp.'s
FreeHand drawing program, also got into a computer network at the
company's headquarters here, Aldus said.
   No programs for sale to the public were infected and the virus
has been eradicated, Aldus spokeswoman Laury Bryant said Thursday.
   ``Software companies can't always protect themselves from stuff
coming in, but we can say unequivocally that we do everything we
can to make sure they don't go out,'' Ms. Bryant said.
   Viruses are computer programs, created by programmers as jokes
or acts of vandalism, that secretly attach themselves to other
programs. The virus can then spread from computer to computer when
operators share infected software.
   At their most benign, viruses merely flash a message on a
computer screen. At their worst, they can destroy information
stored in computer memories or cripple a machine.
   Two viruses all but paralyzed the work of hundreds of students
and faculty at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, officials
said Thursday.
   Last month, a former Fort Worth, Texas, programmer was convicted
of planting a virus in his employer's computer system in the first
such conviction in the nation. Two days after the employee was
fired, the virus activated, erasing 168,000 company records.
   Aldus officials said their new virus, dubbed ``nVir,'' has
remained dormant so far, attaching itself to other programs.
   ``We don't know why, we don't know what invokes this virus,''
Dauber said. ``With some of them, you have to launch the program a
certain number of times,'' for the virus to activate.
   Aldus said it does not know where the virus originated.
   Ms. Bryant said the infection did not do the company any
financial damage because no retail copies were involved and that it
would not affect plans to ship the updated version of FreeHand
later this year.
   The first infection occurred in March, when a ``peace message''
turned up in an earlier version of FreeHand. The message did no
harm to computers, flashing a brief message on computer screens
before dying out.
   The incident shocked computer experts, who until then had
thought viruses could be avoided if users didn't freely exchange
software, but only used off-the-shelf programs. The infection
forced Aldus to recall or rework thousands of packages of the new
software.
   Aldus and other major software producers have since adopted
rigorous testing methods, including the use of ``vaccine'' programs
designed to seek out viruses. Aldus also has isolated from possible
contamination the machines that reproduce its software, Ms. Bryant
said.
   Still, the virus was found in versions of the updated FreeHand
program that had been sent to specific users to be tested before
the program was offered for sale.
   Aldus said it had shipped infected disks to a dozen businesses
and users around the country. One of those users discovered the
virus and notified the company.
   Aldus said the virus also was found in its quality-assurance
computer network.
   ``nVir'' eluded a number of vaccines, Ms. Dauber said. It was
finally revealed by a new detection program, which was not in use
when the test versions were shipped out.

   An estimated $50,000 worth of anabolic steroids
seized by federal agents may have been intended for high school
athletes, authorities said after breaking up what they called a
major international smuggling ring.
   The steroids confiscated Wednesday in Denver's suburbs were for
veterinary use and unfit for human consumption, but some still may
have been sold to young athletes, acting U.S. Attorney Mike Norton
said Thursday.
   The operation was the second steroid bust in eight days. On Oct.
12, Steven W. Smith of Denver was arrested on charges of selling
steroids without prescriptions.
   Anabolic steroids are used legally to treat bone pain in
osteoporosis and hypogonadism, among other things, but athletes
sometimes use the drug illegally to build muscles and improve
performance.
   Officials said they believe the ring operated for five years,
bringing in $500,000 worth of steroids manufactured in Mexico for
distribution throughout Colorado, Wyoming, Utah and Nebraska.
   Those arrested appeared before U.S. Magistrate Richard B. Harvey
late Wednesday on charges of smuggling, conspiracy, money
laundering and violations of the U.S. Food and Drug Act, officials
said.
   They were identified as Steve Lower, 25, a high school gym
teacher and owner of a tanning salon; Kristy Greenwood, 20; Bradley
Meyer, 23; David Faulk, 22; Robert Shine, 27, and Michael Remy, 29.
   The smuggling charges carry prison sentences of up to five years
and fines up to $250,000. Other charges may be filed against the
suspects after evidence is presented to a federal grand jury the
week of Nov. 14, Norton said.
   Authorities said six vehicles were seized during the raids.
   ``I'm glad they caught them,'' said Denver Broncos Coach Dan
Reeves. ``I hope they proscute them. Steroids are very detrimental
to the health of anybody who uses them, particularly young people.''
   Reeves said he knows steroid use is widespread among area high
school athletes. Black marketeers ``are making a profit and
couldn't care less about the damage they're doing to our young
people,'' he said.
   Side effects include permanent deepening of the voice and hair
growth in females, decreased sperm count for men, liver disorders,
changes in blood pressure, changes in cholesterol distribution,
irritability, aggression, disturbed sleep patterns, and changes in
mood.

<TEXT>
   A firefighter and a rescue squad member
charged with attempted murder for allegedly throwing cinder blocks
on cars have accused each other of the crime.
   Three people were hurt in the incidents, none seriously, when
their vehicles were hit by the blocks thrown from overpasses.
   ``They were creating their own incidents to make themselves
heroes,'' said state Trooper Daniel Cosgrove. ``They were getting a
kick out it this. It's kind of sick to do it.''
   Attorneys for Michael Havekost, 18, and David Domanski, 25, on
Thursday blamed each other's clients for being more responsible for
the incidents, which occurred last month.
   ``I think you will find the link that led to these aberrational
crimes is Mr. Domanski,'' said Mark Malone, an attorney for
Havekost.
   Domanski's lawyer, Herbert Korn, acknowledged his client was
present during the incidents but said the rock throwing was done by
Havekost.
   ``When we get down to the charges, the facts will show the
actual person who committed these crimes was the other suspect,''
Korn said.
   Havekost, of Warren Township, is a member of the Millington
Rescue Squad and Passaic First Aid Squad. Domanski, of Passaic
Township, is a member of the Millington Volunteer Fire Department.
Both were charged Thursday with six counts of attempted murder each
and arraigned in Somerset County Superior Court. They were held in
the Somerville County jail after failing to post $150,000 bail.
   Cosgrove said witnesses reported that a black sports car would
appear on the scene to offer aid after each incident.
   ``It turns out Mr. Domanski owns a 1988 Pontiac Firebird similar
to the car described by witnesses,'' he said.
   The two men were arrested by Passaic police last week on arson
charges and released, Cosgrove said. During questioning one of the
suspects mentioned involvement with the cinder block incidents and
the state troopers were called in, he said.
   Cosgrove said it was not immediately clear why the two were
released after being linked to the cinder block throwing.

   The Palestinian parliament-in-exile will
meet Nov. 12 in Algeria, PLO spokesman Ahmed Abdulrahman said.
   The meeting of the 450-member Palestine National Council is
expected to decide whether to declare the existence of an
independent Palestinian state in Israeli-occupied territories and
whether to create a government in exile.
   The council meeting was originally scheduled in August, and
since then Palestinian officials have announced several dates and
possible venues. On Wednesday, PLO official Moiundher Dajani said
in Algeria that the council meeting would be held in the first 10
days in November.
   But Abdulrahman, chief spokesman at Palestine Liberation
Organization headquarters in Tunis, said on Thursday that the PLO's
executive committee finally decided to hold the meeting Nov. 12 in
Algiers.
   The meeting was called in response to the announcement in July
by Jordan's King Hussein that he was cutting administrative links
with the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Some PLO members wanted to
hold the council meeting after elections in Israel on Nov. 1 and in
the United States on Nov. 8.

<TEXT>
   A black Zulu leader whom the
government had hoped to draw into negotiations denounced President
P.W. Botha today as a racist who has shamed South Africa.
   Mangosuthu Buthelezi's speech in KwaZulu, a black homeland which
he governs, was probably his harshest attack ever on Botha and
suggested that reconciliation between the two was unlikely.
   Buthelezi was responding to sharp criticism leveled at him by
Botha during a political speech Thursday night in Benoni, near
Johannesburg.
   In an aggressive address, Botha also attacked the news media,
the country's top-ranking mixed-race politician, and the white
rugby administrators who recently held talks with African National
Congress guerrilla leaders.
   ``It shames South Africa that the state president has stooped to
make personal attacks on me,'' Buthelezi told the KwaZulu
legislature. ``This is absolutely disgraceful personality
assassination.''
   He said members of Botha's National Party ``would be appalled
that Mr. Botha showed the racist face he showed in Benoni.''
   ``Personalizing his political problems, and placing them on my
shoulders in a racist kind of way is even more appalling than it is
unwarranted,'' Buthelezi said.
   Botha, in his speech, criticized Buthelezi for refusing to
cooperate with proposals to give blacks a limited advisory role in
central government. The president described Buthelezi as ``misled
and misused'' and suggested the Zulus were beset by a long history
of intratribal conflict.
   Repeatedly in recent years, the government has tried to draw
Buthelezi into negotiations on limited power-sharing with blacks.
   Buthelezi has refused to participate, saying the government must
first free jailed African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela
and ease political restrictions on black opposition groups.
   The government says it is willing to negotiate a new
constitution in which the black majority, now excluded from
national politics, would have a formal role. However, Botha says he
would never accept a one-man, one-vote system or black majority
rule.
   Under apartheid, the 5 million whites also control the economy
and maintain separate districts, schools and health services from
those of the 26 million blacks.
   Buthelezi, despite his resistance to government overtures, is
unpopular with militant anti-apartheid activists. He criticizes the
use of violence by the ANC and opposes confrontational tactics such
as sanctions, strikes and boycotts.

   Italy's highest criminal court threw out 13 life
sentences for some of Calabria's top Mafia figures and ordered they
be tried again.
   They included Giuseppe Piromalli, considered a top boss of the
'ndrangheta, the version of the Sicilian Mafia in Calabria, which
is in southern Italy.
   The Italian news agency ANSA, in reporting the decision by the
Court of Cassation, said the court ruled Thursday that the two
judges in the first trial had not been formally approved. The trial
ended on June 9, 1986.
   The high court ruled that the defendants should be tried again
on the same charges, including 27 murders, five kidnappings for
ransom, 16 attempted homicides, extortion and other crimes over
several years.
   In recent months, rival gangs have conducted assassinations in
Calabria and Sicily, including last month's killing in Sicily of
Judge Antonio Saetta, who had presided over convictions of two
alleged crime leaders.

   A car passenger whose arm was
severed by a light pole bled to death while the driver recklessly
sped around asking people if they knew where he could dump the
body, police said.
   The bizarre chain of events began Thursday afternoon when a blue
Fiat passed close to a light pole, severing the passenger's arm at
the elbow. The limb was left on the road as the driver sped away,
said Sgt. Bob Duncan of the Florida Highway Patrol.
   Ten blocks away, the car drove another vehicle off the road and
again left the accident scene, Duncan said.
   Minutes later, with the passenger still slumped in the front
seat, the driver stopped at a trash bin and told two people he had
killed a man and was looking for a place to dump the body, police
said.
   Officers immediately began a block-by-block foot search in the
area, inspecting trash bins without results.
   About 90 minutes later, a man splattered with blood approached a
customer about to enter a downtown liquor store.
   ``He just came up to us and said he killed someone and he's got
blood all over him,'' Anthony Cappucci, night manager at the liquor
store, quoted the customer as saying.
   The driver was arrested at a bus stop outside the store. The
victim's body was found inside the car in an alley several blocks
away.
   ``You guys act like I murdered somebody or something,'' the
driver, Terry Griffith, 47, told police after his arrest.
   Griffith told police he was a professional saxophonist.
   Police did not immediately release the victim's name because
relatives had not been notified.

<TEXT>
   Actor Kirk Douglas, who grew up in a family
that struggled to put food on the table, joined best-selling author
Sidney Sheldon as host of a benefit for Skid Row's Los Angeles
Mission.
   ``I feel strongly that, since I come from immigrant parents,
since I've been born in abject poverty, since I've been in the
Bowery in New York looking for a meal, that the work that the Los
Angeles Mission is doing to help the homeless is something that we
have to support,'' the 72-year-old Douglas said Thursday.
   The fund-raiser was held at the Sunset Boulevard home of
Sheldon, author of such books as ``The Other Side of Midnight'' and
``Windmills of the Gods.'' The celebrity guest list included Sidney
Poitier, Jaclyn Smith, Zsa Zsa Gabor and Red Buttons.
   There was no immediate figure available on how much was raised,
but the buffet was expected to raise $100,000 for the Mission's
$11.2 million plan to house more of downtown's homeless and to
bolster its rehabilitation program.
   ``Homeless is not a popular cause. People try to shy away from
it. The Los Angeles Mission is doing to help the homeless and it is
something that we have to support,'' said Douglas, who details his
struggle with poverty in his recently published autobiography,
``The Ragman's Son.''

   Police said they were investigating several
possible explanations for why a young man wired himself with at
least one homemade bomb that exploded in a Harlem subway station.
   The man, who remained unidentified early today, died within
minutes after the explosion, which tore open his chest and set his
clothes on fire.
   Rescue workers were unable to approach the man to try to save
him because of what appeared to be a second, unexploded device on
his chest.
   Bomb squad technicians took two hours to remove the second
device, said a police spokesman, Sgt. Raymond O'Donnell.
   Both devices were about the size of a lantern battery, said Lt.
Walter Boser, the bomb squad's commanding officer. Small pieces of
foil or metal attached to the man's fingers were believed to have
been the detonator.
   It was unknown whether the man set off the explosives on purpose
to commit suicide or whether it went off accidentally.
   ``We're looking into a lot of things,'' said transit police
Deputy Chief Charles Mills. He said he had heard the man had just
come from an angry confrontation with a security guard at a nearby
drug clinic, but ``right now it's just a rumor.''
   Kirk Davis, a token booth clerk at the subway station, said the
man came up the stairs from the platform with his arms wrapped
around his upper body.
   ``I thought he was sick,'' Davis said. ``All of a sudden there
was a tremendous bang. He took two steps and went up in flames.''
   Two transit police officers were standing nearby.
   ``They heard a bang and then saw a flash,'' said transit police
Sgt. Thomas Burke. ``They didn't notice him until he exploded.''

<HEAD>Magazine Reports Deal To Free Hostages To Help Bush Win</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Beirut magazine said today the United
States and Iran were working out a deal for freeing nine American
hostages before the U.S. presidential election on Nov. 8.
   The weekly Ash-Shiraa said the hostages would be freed to ensure
victory for Vice President George Bush in exchange for a commitment
from the Republican candidate to rearm Iran after he takes office.
   There was no way to verify the report.
   Ash-Shiraa, which has access to Iranian hardliners, gained
international fame when it broke the story of the secret U.S. arms
sales to Iran in November 1986. But its subsequent reports about
the hostages, including reports of an imminent release, proved
inaccurate.
   Other reports have said both Bush and Democrat candidate Michael
Dukakis sent envoys to work out a deal with Iran on the hostages.
But Washington has denied any contact was under way with Iran.
   The nine Americans are among 14 foreign hostages in Lebanon,
most believed held by Shiite Moslem radicals linked to Iran. The
longest held is American Terry Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press. He was kidnapped March 16,
1985.
   Ash-Shiraa said: ``A new deal has been in the works for a while
between the United States and Iran under which Iran would free the
American hostages held by its factions in Lebanon before the
upcoming American elections to ensure the victory of the Republican
candidate, Vice President George Bush.
   ``In return, Bush will undertake to forge a new policy in the
region, making Iran its main cornerstone after Israel as the case
was during the era of the (late) Shah (Mohammed Reza Pahlavi).
   ``The scenario also requires Iran to recover its military might
with particular support from the U.S. and the West in general so
that it will be able to go back to war (against Iraq) as soon as
possible to score battlefield victories that would redeem the
prestige of the Iranian army.''
   After a series of battlefield defeats, Iran in July accepted a
U.N. cease-fire in its eight-year war with Iraq.

   A 10-year-old boy has been arrested and
charged with juvenile delinquency for possession of heroin and
cocaine with intent to sell, state police said.
   The boy, who was not identified because of his age, had what
police suspect was 10 packets of heroin, three packets of cocaine
and $190 in cash, said state Trooper Richard Noone.
   He and two 15-year-old boys and a 24-year-old man were arrested
by undercover state troopers Wednesday, Noone said.
   The boy pleaded innocent to the charges in Brockton Juvenile
Court and was released on bail in the custody of his parents.
   The man, identified as Joel Dennis of Brockton, was charged with
possession with intent to distribute cocaine and contributing to
the delinquency of minors.
   He pleaded innocent and was held in lieu of $25,000 cash bail.
At the bail review hearing prosecutors said Dennis was wanted by
Boston police on a 1987 warrant for attempted murder.
   The 15-year-old boys also pleaded innocent. One was charged with
juvenile delinquency by reason of possession and distribution of
heroin. The other was charged with juvenile delinquency by reason
of possession of marijuana and posession of cocaine with intent to
distribute.
   The arrests came after a youth on a bicycle, who was not
apprehended, allegedly sold a bag of heroin to a trooper for $25.

   Continuing studies committees of the Associated
Press Managing Editors association set a 1989 agenda that includes
focusing on ways to use newspapers' features sections to boost
circulation.
   ``If we help people have a good time, is that a way we can get
people back into the reading habit?'' said Mark Vasche of The
Modesto Bee in Modesto, Calif.
   The 20 committees met Thursday on the third day of the weeklong
APME convention.
   The Ethics Committee decided to tackle a subject members
acknowledged is touchy for journalists: the effort of the business
community to influence newspaper content.
   ``It affects all of us,'' said Rich Archbold, of the
Press-Telegram in Long Beach, Calif. ``But we talk about it in the
hallways ... it's so sensitive.''
   James Wyman of The Journal-Bulletin in Providence, R.I., noted
that most such pressure comes from retail advertisers.
   Members of the Freedom of Information Committee discussed
undertaking a series of profiles of lawyers who represent
newspapers, and a series of brief reports on using FOI to fight for
public access to restricted documents.
   Among the reports issued this year:
   _The Business News Committee looked at coverage of Black Monday,
Oct. 19, 1987, when the Dow Jones industrial average took its
biggest plunge ever.
   _The Marketing Committee examined the anatomy of a marketing
plan for a revamped Anderson Independent-Mail in Anderson, S.C.
   _The Features Committee offered a look at what magazine editors
can teach newspaper feature editors.

   A building contractor has filed a
lawsuit claiming that Mick Jagger shortchanged the company $10,000
after it built a waterfall at the singer's Caribbean retreat.
   In the lawsuit filed Thursday in U.S. District Court, Encon
Environmental Conservation of Newport Beach demands full payment
for the waterfall and stream.
   According to the lawsuit, Encon was hired in 1986 and finished
the project on the tiny island of Mustique by May 1987. Jagger paid
$27,000 in advance, but allegedly balked at making an additional
payment of more than $10,000.
   Jagger could not immediately be reached for comment. A call
placed to the singer's publicist's office before business hours
this morning went unanswered.
   The lawsuit demands that an outstanding balance of $10,065.79 be
paid as well as interest on that amount and unspecified punitive
damages.

<HEAD>Jaruzelski Says Talks With Opposition Could Lead To Breakthrough</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DANISZEWSKI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Polish leader Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski
today told pro-government worker activists that forthcoming talks
with the opposition may lead to a breakthrough in national
reconciliation.
   But a party official told the same meeting, ``We cannot give in
to political blackmail, which is the pressure for relegalization of
Solidarity.''
   Solidarity officials have said that legalizing the union
movement banned after the 1981 martial-law crackdown is their
foremost demand at the talks.
   About 500 worker activists chosen by authorities were invited to
the meeting at the Ursus tractor factory just outside of Warsaw,
the state news agency PAP said.
   ``We are facing a great chance of making a breakthrough in the
process of national agreement,'' PAP quoted Jaruzelski as saying.
``That is why at this moment the party asks the working class for
its opinions.''
   The talks could begin this month, said Andrzej Gdula, head of
the social-legal department of the Polish United Workers
(communist) Party.
   ``We speak for one trade union in one enterprise,'' said Gdula,
whose speech was reported by state radio.
   The party is not against ``the idea of union pluralism'' in the
long run, Gdula said. ``However, in order for pluralism to be a
fact, appropriate political relations must be created.''
   The party has argued that political reforms should be
implemented and tried out first before the more volatile issue of
legalizing Solidarity is addressed.
   The opposition wants Solidarity legalized from the outset of any
agreement as a guarantee of the authorities' interest in reform.
   Gdula said the talks were threatened by recent street
demonstrations and boycotts organized at various universities.
   ``Despite these threats, the party believes that the idea of
reconciliation will win and common sense will win. There is a
chance that the round table will start its activities yet this
month,'' he said.
   The opposition says it wants the talks, agreed to during a wave
of strikes in August, to lead to legalization of the Solidarity
trade union and greater political and economic freedom.
   But Gdula said: ``Thinking that all problems will be solved
(during the talks) is illusory. Convergence of views should take
place about how to solve our problems.''
   He said the meeting would lead to a council for national
reconciliation, which would have representatives of the opposition
and government. It could also lead to changes in the electoral law
for choosing a new Parliament next year, he said.

   An aide to Michael Dukakis resigned after the
Democratic presidential candidate disavowed her remarks directed
toward Republican George Bush. ``I don't approve of that kind of
thing,'' Dukakis said today. ``...I regret it very much.''
   Dukakis said Donna Brazile had made ``a very serious mistake in
judgment.'' He talked to Bush about it Thursday evening, he said,
because ``I thought he was entitled to an apology.''
   Brazile had told reporters Thursday that ``the American people
have every right to know'' the truth about rumors involving Bush's
personal life. She later announced her resignation as deputy
national field director with this statement:
   ``Today I made certain comments which I deeply regret. I believe
too strongly in the importance of electing Mike Dukakis and Lloyd
Bentsen to allow myself to become an issue in the campaign. Because
the time is short, and the issues are so important, I have decided
to leave the campaign.''
   Asked about Brazile's remarks, Dukakis said today in an ABC
interview, ``I don't approve of that kind of thing and she's left
the campaign.'' Minutes later he told a CBS program that her
comments were ``totally unauthorized.''
   Bush spokeswoman Sheila Tate said, ``The Bush campaign has no
comment, no reaction.''
   Brazile's initial remarks were made to a small group of
reporters after Dukakis appearances in New Haven, Conn., and she
elaborated during a bus trip to New York City. She raised the
subject of the Bush rumors in the midst of a conversation regarding
the gender gap and the problems of working families.
   Dukakis campaign chairman Paul Brountas said Bush and Dukakis
met Thursday at the Waldorf Astoria, where both were appearing at a
dinner, and Dukakis extended his regrets for Brazile's remarks.
   Brazile ``voluntarily resigned'' and regrets her remarks,
Brountas said.
   Brazile said she spoke only for herself and added, ``I'm not
pushing this on behalf of the campaign.'' Asked later about her
motivation, she characterized her remarks as ``an outburst'' and
said, ``It wasn't planned.''
   Before joining the Dukakis campaign, Brazile was a campaign aide
to Rep. Richard Gephardt and worked in 1984 in the campaign of
Jesse Jackson.
   Wall Street analysts attributed an abrupt market decline
Wednesday to a rumor that The Washington Post planned to publish a
damaging story about Bush. The Post did not publish such a story.

   Welfare recipients will be able to collect
their benefits through cash machines, starting next summer,
Washington state officials say.
   Jule Sugarman, secretary of the Department of Social and Health
Services, said a $185,000 grant from the U.S. Department of
Agriculture was being used to develop an ``electronic benefit
transfer'' demonstration project for distributing cash and
authorizations for food purchases and medical treatment in Pierce
County.
   Under the program, similar to a six-month experiment that began
last month for unemployed workers to collect jobless benefits by
cash machines, welfare recipients will be issued plastic debit
cards and personal identification numbers.
   They could then use the cards and numbers to draw cash against
their accounts from 140 cash machines in the county, some 400
grocery stores would accept the cards in place of food stamps and
the debit cards also would be good at nearly 1,800 medical offices,
said Frank Mendizabal, an agency spokesman.
   He said the money would be available through cash machines on
the last day of each month, eliminating the three to five days of
waiting for checks to arrive in the mail and cutting administrative
costs.
   ``It is an effort to make it a more efficient system for us and
the recipients,'' Mendizabal explained.

   A passenger who didn't like the job a bus
driver was doing accepted the driver's challenge to get behind the
wheel, leaving the startled driver behind and going more than a
mile before police stopped him.
   ``It was something which I felt was necessary, and so did quite
a few other people on the bus,'' said James G. Biddle, 52.
   Biddle got behind the wheel of the Orange County Transit
District bus Wednesday and put it in gear, pulling away with 31
passengers and leaving the driver at the side of the road,
authorities said.
   Biddle's takeover of the bus was prompted by an argument with
driver Kim Dale Miller, 36, police and transit officials said.
   ``Apparently one of the passengers didn't have the proper fare
and Biddle, who is a veteran rider on Route 38, didn't like the way
the driver was dealing with him,'' said transit spokeswoman Claudia
Keith.
   Biddle, of Buena Park, said he became upset when Miller
allegedly directed a racial slur at the passenger. The driver then
allegedly dared Biddle to do a better job and got off the bus.
   Biddle drove about 1{ miles, stopping several times to pick up
and drop off passengers before police stopped the bus. He was cited
for joyriding and driving a bus without a proper license.
   ``It was really hilarious,'' said Joe Stiglbauer, who like
Biddle is an engineer with Hughes Aircraft Co. and a regular
passenger. ``He was very courteous to the passengers. He stopped in
most of the right places, made change for passengers, gave them
transfer tickets, stopped at the railroad crossing and just looked
like an old pro.''
   Miller declined to comment on the incident.Ms. Keith said the
11-year veteran was ``taking a couple of days off'' with pay while
transit officials investigate the incident.

<TEXT>
   The city's former chief administrative
officer and one-time mayoral candidate has entered a surprise
guilty plea to charges of having sex with teen-age prostitutes and
agreed to testify against brothel operators.
   Roger Boas, whose attorney only last Friday filed a court motion
asking that the 19 felony charges be dismissed for lack of
evidence, pleaded guilty to seven counts of statutory rape in
return for having 12 others dropped.
   District Attorney Arlo Smith announced the plea bargain
Thursday, saying his office is recommending a sentence of three
years probation, participation in a 12-month work program, $70,000
in fines or contributions to programs for wayward and runaway
girls, and psychiatric counseling.
   Boas, 67, a wealthy car dealer, had faced up to three years in
prison on each count.
   ``I am very sorry for what has happened,'' Boas said at a news
conference. ``I feel deep remorse ... I will pay my debt to
society. I hope, one day, to return to that society a forgiven
man.''
   The agreement also calls for Boas to testify against 13
co-defendants, including six people charged with operating a
brothel that reportedly earned $20,000 a week.
   ``We're very happy with this sentencing arrangement because we
feel it was what we would have gotten if we had gone to trial and
won a conviction,'' said Smith, who said the plea bargain was
proposed within the last several days.
   Superior Court Judge Timothy Reardon set Nov. 18 for sentencing.
   The original charges, contained in an indictment handed up Oct.
3, covered a 2{-year period starting in November 1985, including
his final 15 months as San Francisco's chief administrative officer
under former mayors George Moscone and Dianne Feinstein and his
1987 mayoral campaign. He placed a close third in last year's
primary.
   A campaign poster for Boas on a street that is a haven for
runaways was spotted by one of the teen-age prostitutes and
eventually led to his indictment, according to police reports.
   During a 16-month police investigation, five prostitutes said
they had sex with Boas.
   A 17-year-old prostitute told investigators she had sex with
Boas some 30 times, adding he called himself ``George'' and liked
to be referred to as ``Daddy.''

   Reagan announced Sept. 9 the conditions for granting export
licenses for the communist nation to launch the satellites.
   After four days of talks, the two countries reached agreement on
establishing safeguards to protect sensitive satellite technology
and on setting China's liability in case of an accident, the
statement said without elaboration.
   Next month's talks will focus on launch services, pricing and
capacity as the United States seeks assurances that satellite
exports to China will not disrupt the market, the statement said.
   The proposal to allow China to launch U.S.-made satellites
caused a controversy within the Reagan administration and Congress.
The Commerce Department reportedly was concerned the exports could
harm the domestic launch industry and some Republican senators
alleged China's launch prices were artificially low.
   But administration sources said the State Department favored the
exports so as not to offend Beijing.
   Two organizations, both foreign, have applied for licenses to
export U.S.-made satellites to China.
   Hughes Aircraft Co., a subsidiary of Hughes Communications
International, has asked the administration to approve launching a
satellite for an Australian company known as AUSSAT.
   ASIASAT, owned by British and Hong Kong firms, is negotiating
with Hughes to refurbish a Westar 6 satellite that was launched by
the U.S. shuttle in 1984, failed to reach the proper orbit, and was
recovered by the shuttle.
   Eugene McAllister, assistant secretary of state for economic and
business affairs, headed the five-member U.S. team in the talks.
The vice minister of aerospace industry, Sun Jiadong, led the
Chinese side.

<HEAD>Soviets May Request Extradition of War Crimes Suspect</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOAN FISCHER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Officials today said a former
U.S. resident convicted by a Soviet court of murdering civilians
during World War II could be extradited to the Soviet Union if it
waives the death penalty.
   The question whether to extradite Boleslav Maikovskis, 84, comes
as Chancellor Helmut Kohl prepares to travel to Moscow next week
for talks with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   The Soviet Union in 1965 sentenced Maikovskis to death in
absentia for his role in burning down a village and killing
civilians as a pro-Nazi police commander in his native country of
Latvia.
   West Germany has no death penalty and would probably not agree
to extradite Maikovskis to a country where the death sentence
awaits him, said Dortmund Prosecutor Klaus Schacht.
   ``But an extradition could theoretically be possible if, for
example, the Soviet Union agreed to withhold the death penalty in
this case,'' Schacht said in a telephone interview.
   Maikovskis is being held in a West German prison while
authorities investigate the shooting deaths of at least 130 men,
women and children in the Latvian village of Audrine during World
War II.
   ``Maikovskis could well face a criminal trial here,'' Schacht
said, but he said he could not estimate how long investigations
would take.
   Schacht works out of Dortmund's war crimes prosecution office,
which is responsible for the Muenster district where Maikovskis was
taken into custody this week.
   ``The Soviet Union is reserving the right to officially request
Maikovskis' extradition,'' Soviet Embassy spokesman Viktor Gutyev
said in an interview broadcast Thurday by the Mainz-based ZDF
television network.
   West German authorities arrested Maikovskis at his Muenster
residence late Wednesday and said he probably was living in the
country at least since November 1987, when he officially applied to
the West German government for political asylum.
   The West German federal office responsible for granting asylum
is expected to decide on Maikovskis' request by the end of
November, authorities said.
   Before that, Maikovskis was a resident of Mineola, N.Y., where
he lived since 1951. He fled the United States at an undetermined
date while facing deportation. The United States began deportation
proceedings against him in 1976, but the proceedings were held up
by several appeals.
   The Supreme Court denied his last appeal in 1986.

<HEAD>City Orders Artist To Stop Plastering Political Posters</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A self-described ``guerrilla artist'' who has
been plastering political satire posters citywide attacking George
Bush, the Nicaraguan Contras and other public figures, was ordered
to put down his brush.
   City Public Works Department inspectors on Thursday ordered
artist Robbie Conal to take down his posters from traffic switch
boxes, bus shelters and other public property.
   Conal, 42, also was ordered during a 30-minute closed-door
hearing to sign a pledge not to post additional copies. Conal said
he would talk to a lawyer next week about whether he should obey
the city's orders.
   The City Attorney's Office may be asked to press charges if
Conal refuses to remove his signs, public works officials said.
Posting signs on public property is a misdemeanor carrying a
maximum $1,000 fine.
   ``I don't feel I've broken any of the higher laws or principles
on which our democracy is founded,'' Conal said. ``I apologize to
the city workers I've inconvenienced and to the citizens whose
sensibilities I've offended.''
   Conal's most recent poster, unveiled during the Republican
National Convention in New Orleans, is a drawing of Bush with the
slogan, ``It can't happen here,'' and the word ``here'' stamped
across a vacant forehead.
   City officials repeatedly denied that their timing was
politically motivated.
   ``The signs contribute to visual pollution,'' inspector Bill
White said after Conal's hearing. ``We are removing all kinds of
signs. Garage sales, lost pets. ... There's nothing selective about
this.''

   President Reagan said today that
Americans should elect George Bush because he has shown how to
``keep a cool head in hot crises.''
   Reagan said that during his eight years in office, ``I have
given him (Bush) some of the most sensitive and difficult tasks
that we've had, and he's never let me or the country down.''
Reagan, whose remarks came in a speech prepared for delivery to a
rally at Western Kentucky University, did not specify what
situations had allowed him to observe Bush's behavior in crisis
situations.
   Reagan, without mentioning the name of Democratic candidate
Michael Dukakis, said the Massachusetts governor ``may have been
surprised at George Bush's strength, but, you know, I wasn't.''
   ``I've worked more closely with George Bush these two terms than
with any other member of the administration,'' Reagan said. ``I
have seen him keep a cool head in hot crises. I have seen his
leadership and vision.''
   Bush won a turf battle with then-Secretary of State Alexander M.
Haig. Jr., early in the administration to head a crisis management
team that Reagan established. But it has never been clear what Bush
did there.
   He was subsequently named to head a counter-terrorism task force
and to direct a drug interdiction task force focusing on the
southern and southwestern borders of the United States.
   But Bush has been criticized by political opponents for his
apparently laid-back role in meetings he attended in connection
with the clandestine sales of U.S. arms to Iran in 1985 and 1986.
Congressional testimony and a presidential review commission said
that participants in these meetings could not recall anything Bush
said about the initiative at a time when then-Defense Secretary
Caspar W. Weinberger and Secretary of State George P. Shultz
vehemently objected to the move.
   Earlier, in Raleigh, N.C., Reagan said Bush should be elected
because he's tough on criminals and will keep the Strategic Defense
Initiative alive.
   In a speech prepared for delivery to 4,500 GOP partisans, Reagan
asserted for the first time that his administration has been
``wildly successful'' in keeping the space-based anti-nuclear
shield on track.
   The president said Bush's opponent would strive to end the
controversial program. ``SDI is no fantasy,'' Reagan said. ``It's a
reality and it's going to shape the future as long as there's a
Republican in the White House.''
   Repeatedly stating that he and Bush had forged his
administration's eight-year programs together, Reagan said,
``There's something .... that I'm particularly proud about. And
that's pushing ahead on our efforts to protect the United States
and the world from the treat of a nuclear attack by means of a
program we call SDI.''
   Reagan, noting that the North Carolina area is the home of much
of the SDI research, claimed that his administration has been ``so
successful, so wildly successful, in our research and advances that
we've slashed an incredible $46 billion _ that's almost half _ off
the projected cost of our most promising program.''
   Reagan, in claiming credit for keeping costs down on the
billion-dollar project, made no mention of the fact that much of
the cutting in SDI budgets and Pentagon expenses has been forced by
Congress.
   The president hit hard on Dukakis' record on crime, asserting
that he opposes the death penalty ``absolutely and in every case.
   ``Sometimes, they seem to care more about the rights of
criminals than the rights of victims, and if you ask me, we don't
need to see the job of the police made any tougher by the kind of
furlowing of first-degree murderers _ even those ineligible for
parole _ that we've seen in the state of Massachusetts.''
   Reagan said that the nation must choose ``a responsible
president (who) will deal with a responsible Congress that seeks to
enhance our strength at home and abroad.
   ``It is a future of peace through strength and prosperity
through liberty personified by the man I believe will be the next
president of the United States, George Bush.''
   The primary purpose of Reagan's appearance is ``firing up the
troops,'' said Steve Schwartz, state director for Bush's campaign.
   ``People tend to think they have it in the bag when they read
all these favorable polls. ... I think we have a good double digit
lead in the state but that doesn't mean anything. We've not strayed
one iota from our original plan, which includes a massive
get-out-the vote drive,'' Schwartz said.
   A Charlotte Observer telephone survey of 870 registered voters
taken Oct. 9 through Oct. 12 showed Bush leading Democratic rival
Michael Dukakis 53 percent to 40 percent in the state. The margin
of error was 3.3 percent.
   Later in the day, Reagan was to fly to southern Kentucky and
speak to 12,000 students and citizens at Western Kentucky
University in Bowling Green.
   The event was billed as a rally for Bush and his running mate,
Dan Quayle.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters Thursday
that Reagan was traveling to Kentucky because, ``We think we've got
a good shot of winning'' there.

   An explosion that may have been
caused by a gas leak destroyed an apartment building in northern
Bohemia today, and an official said one person died and four people
were injured.
   The blast, which occurred at Ceska Lipa, 60 miles north of
Prague, destroyed all 13 apartments in the building and damaged
several nearby apartments, the state news agency CTK reported.
   An employee of the local gas works told The Associated Press in
a telephone interview that an elderly woman died in the explosion,
four people were injured and one was missing. CTK said the exact
number of casualties was not known.
   Police said a gas leak may have caused the explosion, according
to the gas works employee, who spoke from Ceska Lipa on condition
of anonymity.
   ``It's pretty difficult to determine what did it, because the
whole house was ripped apart, with wires and pipes dangling
everywhere,'' he said.
   CTK said rescue workers were searching through the rubble.

<HEAD>Man With 33 Drunken Driving Convictions Is Released On Bond</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man with 33 drunken driving convictions
and free on bond pending appeal of four others has been released on
bond after being arrested once again for drunken driving, officials
say.
   ``I have never, never, ever had anybody with a record even
approaching that,'' said attorney Earle R. Purser, who represented
Otis Donald Wadford at a hearing in September.
   Wadford, 52, was arrested Monday and released after he posted
$1,000 bond in Wake County District Court. He was free on a
previous bond pending his appeal of four drunken driving
convictions last month, The News and Observer of Raleigh reported.
   Bond can be denied only in first-degree murder cases in which
the death penalty is being sought.
   ``Maybe it's time we look at the law and consider some sort of
revision to protect the public,'' said Wake District Attorney C.
Colon Willoughby Jr. ``Maybe public safety outweighs the
individual's right to be free pending his case being litigated'' in
instances other than murder cases.
   Wadford pleaded guilty Sept. 8 to four charges each of driving
while impaired and driving while his license was permanently
revoked, plus assorted other traffic charges. He was sentenced to
four years in prison under a plea agreement negotiated by Purser.
   But the next day, Wadford appealed the charges to which he had
pleaded guilty. That made him eligible for release on bond pending
a new trial.
   He was released before either Purser or the prosecutor, Zesely
Haislip Jr., knew he had appealed. Purser says he won't represent
Wadford again.
   Prosecutors generally are not notified immediately of a
defendant's appeal on misdemeanor convictions, Haislip said. He
said that if he had known, he would have asked that bond be raised.
   On Monday, Wadford was charged again.
   Magistrate Sonny Garner set Wadford's bond at $1,000. Wadford
posted bond and was again released.
   Garner said he was aware of only one or two drunken driving
convictions on Wadford's record when he set the bond because the
magistrate's office did not have access to computerized criminal
histories after 5 p.m.
   Garner said that, based on his information, the bond was
appropriate. Wadford has a trial date of Nov. 22 on the latest
charges.
   ``The man just keeps on driving, he just keeps on driving,''
Purser said.

<TEXT>
   Human rights activist Andrei D. Sakharov today
said the Kremlin has tentatively agreed to let him leave the Soviet
Union for the first time, to attend a conference in the United
States.
   He said he will leave for the United States next month.
   Sakharov, the father of the Soviet dissident movement, told a
news conference the lifting of a travel ban against him was due to
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's program of economic and political
restructuring and the personal efforts of some Soviet officials.
   Granting Sakharov a visa to travel abroad would be a dramatic
gesture to show the liberalization under Gorbachev's reforms. It
could also set an uncormfortable precedent for the Kremlin, because
many other Soviets are prohibited from leaving the country on
grounds they know state secrets.
   Sakharov, a physicist, had been denied permission to travel on
grounds he had access to sensitive information while working on the
Soviet hydrogen bomb.
   He has spoken out repeatedly for free emigration and protested
Soviet intervention in Afghanistan. For his human rights
activities, he was awarded the 1975 Nobel Peace Prize.
   He was exiled to the closed city of Gorky in 1980 and released
under Gorbachev's administration in December 1986.
   He told reporters the government agreed ``in principle'' to
allow him to attend a conference of the International Foundation
for the Survival and Development of Humanity. Sakharov said he had
not yet officially applied for the necessary travel documents.
   ``This question was raised by the authorities of the foundation
and presented to decision-makers, and now it has received a
positive response. The question is solved in principle. I will take
part in the coming trip by the foundation,'' said Sakharov.
   The clearest indication Sakharov would be given foreign travel
documents was a decree issued Oct. 5 by the Council of Ministers.
   The decree directed the Foreign Ministry to ``provide members of
the Board of Directors and other official representatives of the
foundation and their family members multiple entrance and exit
visas for terms of up to two years.''
   Sakharov is a member of the board of the foundation, as are
prominent Soviet scientists such as Yevgeny Velikhov and Roald
Sagdeyev.
   Sakharov has been invited to attend the board meeting in
Washington on Nov. 15 and 16 as well as meetings in the Los Angeles
area, San Francisco, Boston, New York and possibly Chicago, said
group member Edward B. Hodgman.
   The Moscow-based group is a non-profit philanthropic
organization set up in January to help solve environmental, human
rights, disarmament and economic development problems.
   Today's news conference was held in an auditorium at the
headquarters of the government press agency Novosti. It was the
second time the government furnished a stage for the 67-year-old
activist to speak to reporters.
   Yevgeny Velikhov, a vice president of the prestigious Soviet
Academy of Sciences, shook Sakharov's hand and smiled as Sakharov
arrived. Sakharov said Velikhov had personally interceded to get
him permission to travel abroad.
   In another sign of his return to good graces of Soviet
officials, Sakharov was elected one of 47 members to the ruling
Presidium of the prestigious academy. During the now disgraced rule
of President Leonid Brezhnev, some members of the academy tried to
expell Sakharov.
   Sakharov said the academy voted 152-82 Thursday to elect him a
member of the academy in charge of cosmology, the study of the
universe's origin.

<TEXT>
   A West German journalist called
to testify on the background of confessed Lebanese hijacker
Mohammed Ali Hamadi said today that young Lebanese blame the United
States for Lebanon's chaos.
   ``They (young Lebanese) always blame America for everything
because that's the name they see on weapons used against them,''
said Gerhard Konzelmann.
   Hamadi, a Lebanese Shiite Moslem, is accused of killing U.S.
Navy diver Robert Stethem during the 1985 hijacking of a TWA
airliner.
   He also faces charges of air piracy in connection with the
hijacking of TWA Flight 847, during which some people were brutally
beaten, and 39 Americans were held hostage 17 days.
   Hamadi, who admitted hijacking the plane but denied killing
Stethem, already has testified about his hatred for the United
States and Israel.
   Konzelmann testified Hamadi's views are consistent with those of
many young Lebanese. ``For them, America is often more guilty than
Israel, because it provides the weapons.''
   Konzelmann, 55, worked for West German television in Beirut for
about 10 years starting in the late 1960s. He later wrote a book
about his experiences called ``Der Unheilige Krieg'' (``The Unholy
War.'')
   Hamadi, who court records show is 24, is accused of shooting
Stethem, 23, of Waldorf, Md., after the plane was hijacked in June
1985 and diverted to Beirut on an Athens-to-Rome trip.
   During the trial, which began July 5, numerous witnesses aboard
the hijacked airliner have testifed they believe Hamadi killed
Stethem.
   Hamadi was arrested at Frankfurt airport in January 1987, after
customs officials found liquid explosives in his luggage.
   The week after his arrest, two West Germans were kidnapped in
Beirut, in an effort to force Hamadi's release and prevent him from
being extradited to the United States, where he faces charges in
connection with the hijacking.
   Following the kidnappings of Rudolf Cordes and Alfred Schmidt in
Beirut, West Germany turned down a U.S. extradition request and
announced Hamadi would be prosecuted in Frankfurt.
   Hamadi's brother, Abbas, was arrested at Frankfurt airport on a
return trip from Lebanon in 1987. A German court convicted him in
April of arranging the kidnappings of Cordes and Schmidt, and
sentenced him to 13 years in prison.
   The two West Germans have been released by their captors.

   An animal welfare group says it will stop
cat adoptions until after Halloween because of the possibility that
felines might be tortured during satanic rituals.
   Bill A. Larson, founder of The Free to Live Animal Sanctuary,
said the agency gets numerous requests to adopt black cats this
time of the year. He and other officials of the sanctuary say they
have received several reports that black cats are targets for
torture during Halloween.
   ``We are certain it goes on _ how much we don't know,'' Larson
said. ``But we do not intend to contribute to it by adopting any
cats out during Halloween week.''
   Larson said he hasn't seen a cat that has been sacrificed or
tortured.
   He said the moratorium on adoptions was unrelated to the recent
discovery of 12 mutilated cats in one neighborhood of Oklahoma City.

<HEAD>Movie Planned On Church Bus Crash</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ELIZABETHTOWN, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Families of 27 people killed in a
church bus crash have agreed to cooperate with a planned movie or
miniseries about the May 14 accident to ensure ``it's done
correctly.''
   ``We want something realistic, not something Hollywood style,''
Bill Nichols, a spokesman for the families, said Thursday.
   Nichols, whose son died in the wreck, said he and the others
realized ``somebody's going to make a movie of it, and we wanted to
have some input.''
   Nichols said the families' main concern was ``we don't want to
portray Larry Mahoney as a hero, as he is being done now by his
hometown folks.''
   Mahoney, 35, is charged with driving his pickup the wrong way on
Interstate 71 near Carrollton when it collided with the Radcliff
church bus carrying 63 youths and four adults. Twenty-seven people
died during the fire that erupted soon after impact, and many
others were severely burned and injured.
   Mahoney returned Oct. 10 to his parents' home in Owen County
after relatives and friends provided $540,000 in cash and property
to secure his bond.
   He is scheduled to go on trial Jan. 9 in Carroll Circuit Court,
and is charged with 27 counts of murder, 13 counts of first-degree
assault, 44 counts of wanton endangerment and one count of driving
under the influence.
   A representative of Krantz Productions Inc. of Studio City,
Calif., is expected to meet with the family representatives next
month.
   Nichols said the families and Krantz Productions are interested
in emphasizing the danger of driving under the influence of
alcohol. He also said the person he talked with indicated Krantz
was interested in making a documentary of the crash.
   Krantz spokesman Brian LaPan said Tuesday that since Krantz
works mostly with the networks, a movie about the bus crash
probably would be less like a documentary and more a disaster drama.
   But he added, ``We're still in the development stage of it.''
   Jim Morgan, youth minister at the Radcliff Assembly of God
church that owned the bus, said, ``We the people that lost children
or had people on the bus need a say so we don't have fiction in the
actual movie. We want fact, not fiction.''

<HEAD>Writer-Critic Dorothy Parker's Ashes Given Final Resting Place</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN ROLL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Before her death in 1967, Dorothy Parker, the
Jazz Age writer and critic famous for her caustic wit, suggested
her own epitaph: ``Excuse my dust.''
   Her ashes have finally been laid to rest in a garden behind the
NAACP's national headquarters.
   Until Thursday's ceremony, her remains had languished for a
decade on a shelf in the New York office of lawyer Paul O'Dwyer,
who acquired them as attorney for the late writer Lillian Hellman,
who was executor of Mrs. Parker's estate.
   O'Dwyer decided last summer he'd like to find a more appropriate
resting place and the National Association for the Advancement of
Colored People came up with the final proposal.
   Mrs. Parker, who was Jewish, had left her entire estate to civil
rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. and, in the event of his
death, to the NAACP.
   At Thursday's ceremony, NAACP Executive Director Benjamin Hooks
described Mrs. Parker as a battler for civil rights at a time when
it was ``socially unacceptable.''
   The decision to build a memorial garden for Mrs. Parker was a
symbol of the NAACP's dedication to strengthening ties between
blacks and Jews, he said.
   ``We know the alliance has been subjected to strains ... and we
get on each other's nerves at times, but there are more points on
which we do agree than we disagree,'' Hooks said.
   In addition to her vitriolic drama criticisms for Vanity Fair,
Mrs. Parker won praise for her short stories and for the screenplay
to the Hollywood film ``A Star is Born,'' written with her husband
Alan Campbell.
   Her death at the age of 73 ended a life that included several
unhappy love affairs, three marriages and four suicide attempts.
   But Hooks said Mrs. Parker should be remembered by the lines she
wrote in her poem ``Epitaph for a Darling Lady.''
   ``Leave for her a young red rose
   ``Go your way, and save your pity;
   ``She is happy, for she knows,
   ``That her dust is very pretty.''

   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir today accused
Jordan's King Hussein of meddling in Israel's election campaign by
appearing on American television to back the peace plan of Foreign
Minister Shimon Peres.
   ``The results of the Israeli elections will be determined by the
Israeli people, not by foreign interference,'' said Shamir, leader
of the right-wing Likud bloc. He is running against Peres of the
left-leaning Labor Party in the Nov. 1 election.
   Hussein spoke Thursday night in an interview on ABC-TV's
``Nightline'' program. Alon Liel, Foreign Ministry spokesman, said
today the appearance was engineered by Peres to show Israeli voters
his ``peace plan still has a partner.''
   Peres' peace plan calls for convening an international Middle
East peace conference that would launch direct talks among the
parties to the conflict. Palestinians would be represented by a
joint Jordanian-Palestinian delegation.
   The proposal, initially accepted by Hussein, suffered a severe
setback when the monarch announced July 31 he was severing ties
with the occupied West Bank, thus removing himself from the peace
process.
   In the first segment of the ``Nightline'' program, Peres
reiterated his proposed plan. Hussein, asked by anchorman Ted
Koppel to respond, called Peres' proposal ``interesting'' and ``a
step forward.''
   Jordan is ``prepared, if the Palestinians seek it and ask us
categorically, to go to an international conference in a joint
(Palestinian-Jordanian) delegation,'' Hussein said.
   The monarch also said a Shamir victory would be an ``absolute
disaster'' and escalate tensions in the Middle East.
   Shamir refuses to trade territory for peace and proposes to
negotiate limited Palestinian autonomy in direct talks, a plan
rejected by Hussein.
   Liel confirmed Koppel's on-the-air statement that Hussein's
appearance was engineered by Peres staffers who told ``Nightline''
producers that Peres wanted to spell out his peace plan and that
Hussein would respond favorably.
   ``It was an important move to explain to the Israeli public that
the international peace conference and the territory-for-peace
formula are realistic ideas,'' Liel told foreign reporters after
screening the ``Nightline'' program for them.
   Liel acknowledged the move could cause a backlash among voters
who might resent attempts by foreign leaders to manipulate them.
``Peres definitely took into consideration that such a move would
be controversial,'' Liel said. ``But he wanted to show that his
program still has a partner.''
   But Shamir suggested the ploy would harm Peres' chances in the
elections. ``Those responsible for this attempt will bear full
public responsibility for their actions,'' Shamir said in a
statement.
   Likud and Peres are running neck-and-neck, according to the
latest polls.
   Liel said that while Hussein's remarks did not contain
substantive changes, he made a shift in emphasis. ``In July,
Hussein said, `If things change, I might come back into the
picture.' Now he says, `If the Palestinians would like, I will come
back,''' Liel said.

   Democratic vice presidential nominee
Lloyd Bentsen told nursing students today that the Democratic
ticket stands for programs needed by working women, including pay
equity, day care, an increased minimum wage and the Equal Rights
Amendment.
   ``We're with you. We're the party of progress for the working
women of America,'' said Bentsen, who is Michael Dukakis' running
mate.
   The Texas senator, who is chairman of the Senate Finance
Committee, said the Republicans had tried to cut back on prenatal
care and health care for children and he ridiculed GOP objections
to federal standards for day care.
   ``We have stronger federal standards on dog food than we have on
day care protection for our children,'' he said.
   He said the Reagan administration has opposed an increase in the
minimum wage and George Bush has waffled on the issue while ``seven
out of eight jobs filled by women since 1980 have been paying at
the poverty level.''
   ``We won't rest until American women have equal access to
opportunity and a fair share of the American dream,'' he said,
getting loud applause from the mostly-female audience at the San
Antonio Health Science Center.
   Bentsen's press secretary, Mike McCurry, said the speech today
was aimed particularly at women in Texas. The campaign has found
that much of the deterioration in the ticket's standing in the
state, where it now trails in the polls, has been with young
working women, he said.
   Bentsen arrived back in his home state of Texas on Thursday and
immediately went to Corpus Christi State University for a
question-and-answer session, via satellite, with college students
in 11 states.
   Continuing to emphasize the Democrats' announced commitment to
education, he then flew to San Antonio for a visit with middle
school students, including a computer demonstration from a
13-year-old boy.
   The television conference from Corpus Christi featured prominent
Democrats including Jesse Jackson, Sen. Albert Gore Jr., D-Tenn.,
former Kentucky Gov. Martha Layne Collins, Michael Kennedy, son of
the late Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, and actor Rob Lowe.
   The questioners were screened carefully by campaign staff
members, who made sure Bentsen didn't get any queries that would
embarrass him during the 60 minutes of satellite time rented by the
campaign for the event. Satellite coordinates were publicized to
get maximum media coverage.
   Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton played master of ceremonies, and
punctuated many of Bentsen's remarks by adding jibes of his own at
the Republicans.
   Bentsen's press secretary, McCurry, said the event cost about
$14,000 and some 3,000 students took part in the session. The
satellite feed was made available to television stations nationwide.
   ``Obviously, we're delighted with the format,'' McCurry said.
``It's a great way to campaign in 11 states simultaneously,'' since
local reporters were invited at each site.
   Bentsen told the students the Republicans ``have talked vaguely
of a thousand points of light and a gentler America _ while
savaging the electorate with vicious negative campaigning.''
   It was a continuation of what he says will be a constant
campaign through the election to correct what he says are GOP
distortions.
   Bentsen dropped the harsh political tone at the Eisenhower
Middle School in San Antonio, where he visited 7th and 8th grade
students working on personal computers.
   Chris Payne, a 13-year-old who said his father works for a major
computer company, produced a large-type welcome note, decorated
with American flags, for Bentsen. The Texas senator signed it and
returned it to him.
   Bentsen then took some questions from youngsters gathered in the
school library, and he reminded them of the Democrats' commitment
to improving education, including a new program to help students
finance college.
   Presented with an ``Ike Pride'' T-shirt by the group, Bentsen
recalled how he once tried to get the school's namesake to run as a
Democrat for president.

   Rescue workers scaled a steep mountain
bluff to confirm that three people found in the wreckage of a small
plane dangling precariously from the side of a cliff were dead,
police said today.
   The single-engine Cessna, en route to Illinois from North
Carolina, crashed in bad weather Tuesday in a remote region of the
Cumberland Mountains. Authorities mounted an extensive ground and
air search at daylight Wednesday and spotted the wreckage about 5
p.m. Thursday.
   The plane was ``hanging on the side of a sheer bluff by a small
cable and one wing,'' said Civil Air Patrol Maj. Bob Swabe.
   Four rescue workers managed to work their way down the steep
cliff to the plane late Thursday and determined that none of the
passengers was alive, said Sgt. Charles Hutson of the LaFollette
Rescue squad.
   In addition to the plane's precarious position, rain and fog
late Thursday and today hampered efforts to reach the bodies.
Hutson said the retrieval effort was to resume early Saturday if
the weather cleared.
   The plane disappeared from radar about 2 p.m. Tuesday, shortly
after refueling at Knoxville's McGhee Tyson Airport. The pilot of
the plane was identified as David Oakley, 30, of Hoopston, Ill. The
names of the two passengers have not been released pending
notification of relatives.

   Congressional opponents of U.S. arms sales to
moderate Arab states don't understand American strategy and are
jeopardizing hopes for securing peace in the region, Defense
Secretary Frank C. Carlucci said today.
   Such arms sales not only improve the security of friendly
nations such as Saudi Arabia and Jordan but help cement
relationships that provide the United States diplomatic leverage,
Carlucci said.
   The sales also do not threaten Israel, he said, adding the
administration's critics fail to think through the implications for
the Jewish state of being surrounded by Arab nations relying on
non-American arms.
   ``Some in Washington, and on Capitol Hill in particular, have
exhibited a lack of realism _ indeed, a strategic confusion _ about
the why and wherefore of U.S.-Arab defense relationships,''
Carlucci said, addressing the American-Arab Affairs Council in
Huntington, W.Va.
   ``Various interest groups and many in Congress have sought to
impede virtually every administration initiative to provide
reasonable and responsible military assistance to our Arab
partners,'' he continued.
   ``As a result, Great Britain, France, China the Soviet Union and
others are moving into the highly-desirable positions of confidence
and influence which America has traditionally enjoyed with friends
such as Jordan and Saudi Arabia. We need a new sense of realism in
Washington about the strategic purposes of our policies in the
Middle East ...''
   The text of Carlucci's remarks was released by the Pentagon in
advance of his appearance.
   The defense secretary expressed optimism about peace prospects,
despite the current violence between Israelis and Palestinians on
the West Bank and the failure of Secretary of State George Shultz's
shuttle diplomacy.
   Carlucci said he found heartening the cease-fire between Iran
and Iraq and the Russian withdrawl from Afghanistan. He said he
also had seen signs that radical revolutionary fervor in the region
was waning.
   ``People want capable, productive government, stability and
economic prosperity. For this, they need peace,'' Carlucci declared.
   Real progress can only occur at the bargaining table, he
continued, with all sides participating in direct negotiations.
   ``I am convinced that most Arab states are willing to live in
peace with Israel, but are themselves continually threatened by
radical forces in the region,'' he said. ``That is why I believe
that moderate Arab states must be strong enough to resist
intimidation and take the bold steps to negotiate peace with
Israel.''
   Congress, by blocking the sale of arms to Arab nations,
undercuts ``a key to our ability to broker the peace process,''
Carlucci continued. And to make matters worse, Israel is not
threatened by such deals, he insisted.
   ``Israel must regard non-American arms in the hands of its
neighbors as a higher risk,'' Carlucci said.

<HEAD>House Passes Aviation Safety Research Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House passed legislation today directing
the Federal Aviation Administration to step up its research on
aircraft safety, including fire prevention and the problems faced
by aging planes.
   The measure was approved by the House on a voice vote and sent
to President Reagan for his signature. The Senate passed the
legislation on a voice vote on Thursday.
   The bill gathered momentum after a series of airline accidents,
such as the Delta Airlines crash at Dallas-Fort Worth International
Airport last Aug. 31, in which 14 people were killed but 93 others
survived.
   ``Aviation safety must be improved, and can benefit greatly from
expanded research,'' said Rep. Robert Roe, D-N.J., chairman of the
House Science and Technology Committee.
   The bill requires the FAA to increase its research on post-crash
fire prevention. The legislation also directs the FAA to consider
writing a rule that would require airlines to make aircraft fuel
tanks that are less prone to fire.
   The structural soundness of aging aircraft would be another
category of required research. The provision was inspired by the
April 28 incident in which the roof of an Aloha Airlines Boeing 737
peeled off in flight, sweeping a flight attendant to her death and
injuring 61 of 94 people on board before the plane landed safely.
   The bill would also require added research on the role human
performance plays in aircraft safety. Among the items the FAA would
have to examine would be the standards the agency uses to determine
how many air traffic controllers it believes are needed.
   Overall, the bill directs the FAA to reserve 15 percent of its
research budget, or about $21 million, for long-term research.
   In another development concerning airline safety, the nation's
airlines were told Thursday by the FAA to examine the takeoff
warning horns on two of the most widely used jetliners, Boeing 727s
and 737s, after faulty alarms were found in 35 of the aircraft.

<TEXT>
   Gunmen who abducted a woman after a spree of
burglaries and a car chase with police released her unharmed after
two days, putting her on a Greyhound bus in Tennessee, police said
today.
   Michelle Sisk, 28, of Creal Springs, told authorities that her
abductors, who had forced her into her car Tuesday night after
holding up the Lake of Egypt Supermarket, planned to kill police if
they were stopped even for a minor traffic violation and vowed not
to be taken alive, Williamson County Sheriff Harry Spiller said at
a news conference.
   Mrs. Sisk said her abductors drove her on a route that included
Princeton, Ind., Louisville, Ky., and finally Memphis, where they
bought her a bus ticket home, Spiller said. She was put on the bus
about 6:30 p.m. Thursday and arrived in Marion just after 11 p.m.,
where she called her family.
   Spiller said Mrs. Sisk apparently was released because she has
three children.
   ``I think she held up very well,'' Spiller said. ``She's
emotionally upset. She has a right to be. When we got her, she
indicated she was OK. She was nervous, and certainly that was
understandable. ... She was very cooperative.''
   He identified the suspects as Kenneth Darren Gravatt, 23,
recently released from Menard Correctional Center after serving
time for armed robbery; his brother, Michael, 19; and Joe S.
Johnson, 19, all of Marion.
   The three men had burglarized two homes before the abduction,
stealing 22 rifles and shotguns, the sheriff said. They led police
on a car chase after one of the burglaries, but escaped when they
crashed the car and fled on foot.
   Late Tuesday, one of the men entered the supermarket with a
shotgun and ordered two employees to hand over the money.
Authorities say Mrs. Sisk had just bought some gas when she was
grabbed outside the store and forced into her car.
   Besides an unknown amount of cash taken in the burglaries, the
men made off with $165 to $170 from the grocery. They are being
sought by the Memphis Highway Patrol, the FBI and the federal
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, Spiller said.

   Prosecutors Friday withdrew charges
against four lecturers and six students alleged to have fanned
violent anti-government protests at the Zimbabwe University.
   About 400 students ran through the grounds of the Harare
magistrate's court chanting and raising victory salutes after
prosecutor Tadius Karwi said the state decided to drop the charges.
Karwi said, however, that the state reserved the right to file new
charges against the 10 under law and order regulations.
   The state alleged that the lecturers met with six students
before protests of official corruption erupted in violence on Sept.
29. The state charged the 10 incited other students to violence.
   More than 460 students were arrested and many were injured in
clashes with police. Students later said the police used live
ammunition to break up the demonstration.
   President Robert Mugabe defended firm action taken by the police
but top university lecturers and church groups accused the
authorities of brutality.

   A charity organization said Friday it was reviving
an abandoned national lottery to raise money for the National
Health Service.
   The National Hospital Trust said it has revamped the Loto UK,
abandoned in May after the Director of Public Prosecutions said it
might be illegal because its prize of $352,000 was bigger than the
$11,000 maximum the law allows.
   The organizers are getting around the limit by having each of
the trust's 100 branches hold a lottery simultaneously on one form.
Gamblers who enter all of them, at less than two cents each, will
have a chance at the grand prize.
   The first drawing is to be held Nov. 4. It still might be
blocked by Home Secretary Douglas Hurd, who has threatened to
outlaw multiple lotteries.
   Loto UK plans to give 50 percent of its proceeds away as prizes,
35 percent to the National Health Service and the remainder will
cover its costs.
   The National Health Service, with an annual budget of about $37
billion, has been having financial difficulties for years. More
than 700,000 people are waiting for surgery at the 2,000 state-run
hospitals.

   Authorities in Laos have released a Roman Catholic
bishop and a priest who had been imprisoned since 1980, Keston
College said Friday.
   The London-based college, which monitors religious affairs in
communist countries, quoted reliable sources as saying that Bishop
Thomas Khamphan, 63, the apostolic vicar of the diocese of Pakse in
southern Laos, and a priest identified only as the Rev. Bounliep
were both freed in August.
   Their long-awaited release means that no Catholic priests are
known to be in detention in Laos, although one priest in the
capital Vientiane is reported to be under house arrest, the college
said.
   There are believed to be about 30,000 Roman Catholics in Laos,
organized into three apostolic regions, the college said. After the
communist takeover of Laos in 1975, all Catholic schools were taken
over by the state, the seminary was closed and foreign missionaries
were expelled.
   The three Laotian bishops have not been able to leave the
country to visit Rome although in recent years the Vatican
pro-nuncio in neighboring Thailand has been able to visit
Vientiane, the college said.

<TEXT>
   Democrat Michael Dukakis, trying to rally
inner-city black voters behind his underdog presidential campaign,
pledged today to wage a war against drugs that ``should know no
bounds.''
   In an appearance at the Bethel African Methodist Episcopal
Church in Harlem, Dukakis said that ``the streets of America don't
belong to the drug gangs and the crack gangs. They belong to us.
And in the Dukakis administration we're going to take them back.''
   Several hundred people turned out to hear the Democratic
presidential candidate, but there were many empty seats in the
church.
   Earlier in the day, Dukakis, attempting to widen the audience
for his message in the closing days of the campaign, appeared on
two television interview shows.
   In Harlem he referred to the drug-related shooting deaths this
week of two New York police officers.
   ``When a law enforcement officer is killed in the line of duty,
we all die a little bit. And when drugs are the cause, that grief
must be matched by determination. Determination to fight.
Determination to wage war. Determination to beat the drug peddlers
and thugs who are terrorizing our people and poisoning our kids.
   ``Our grief is above politics. And our determination to win this
war should know no bounds.
   ``But that isn't going to happen with an administration that has
fought and lost the war,'' he said.
   Dukakis has repeatedly attacked Republican rival George Bush as
ineffective at the head of the Reagan administration's effort to
reduce the flow of drugs into the United States.
   The Democrat's appearances on two morning interview shows were
part of an effort in the final days of the campaign to get him
greater exposure and trigger a presidential campaign comeback.
   ``The American people are not happy with this campaign,'' he
told ABC. On CBS a few minutes later he said ``this campaign has
been altogether too negative,'' contending, ``I've been subject to
attacks and distortion.''
   The Democratic nominee was forced to wrestle with a new
negative-campaign episode of his own, and criticized an aide's
remarks about his Republican opponent, George Bush, as ``a very
serious mistake in judgment.'' The aide, Donna Brazile, quit the
Dukakis campaign on Thursday and Dukakis apologized to Bush later
in the evening.
   Dukakis pronounced himself ``cautiosly optimistic'' about his
prospects Nov. 8, and said voters are only now ``beginning to focus
in.''
   ``In the next 18 days that will give me an opportunity and give
Senator Lloyd Bentsen an opportunity to take that message of hope
and opportunity and confidence about the best America to the people
of this country,'' he told ABC.
   Dukakis said his appearance on ``Good Morning America,'' was
``one opportunity to do that.'' He told ``CBS This Morning:'' ``I
hope through interviews like this, people will have a better sense
of who I am.''
   Following his morning TV appearances, Dukakis planned to deliver
a five-minute speech this weekend on network television. He
conceded that ``we're behind a little bit,'' but said a large
percentage of voters ``really haven't made up their minds.''
   Dukakis was asked about the remarks of Brazile, deputy field
director of his campaign, who resigned Thursday after telling
reporters that Bush ``owes it to the American people to fess up''
about rumors concerning his personal life.
   ``I don't approve of that kind of thing and she's left the
campaign,'' Dukakis told ABC. ``... I apologized to the vice
president.''
   Dukakis aides said the Massachusetts governor would deliver a
five-minute speech on the ABC television network at 9:55 p.m. EDT
on Saturday. He taped the speech along with new television
commercials at a studio in Manhattan.
   In recent days, Dukakis has struck back at Bush attacks on the
Massachusetts prison furlough program.
   He began by denouncing Republican campaign material as
``garbage'' and ``a pack of lies,'' then escalated his response on
Thursday by comparing the Bush campaign to the Watergate White
House under Richard M. Nixon.
   ``Above all, the truth should matter a lot in a presidential
campaign because as we learned in Watergate, it matters a lot in
the Oval Office,'' Dukakis said during an appearance in New Haven,
Conn.
   ``Truth was the first casualty in the Nixon White House and it
was the first casualty in the Bush campaign,'' said the Democratic
nominee.
   At New York's annual Al Smith charity dinner, Dukakis shared a
dais with Bush. Humor was the order of the evening, but Dukakis
couldn't resist mixing in a few political digs.
   He apologized for the fact his wife was not present.
   ``Kitt's in a hotel room in Dallas tonight,'' he said. ``Maybe
she qualifies as a Texan,'' a reference to the fact Bush's official
residence in Texas is a Houston hotel room.
   He also tried a few self-deprecating remarks aimed at his image.
   ``I've also been told that I lack passion,'' he said and then
deadpanned, ``but that doesn't affect me one way or the other.''

<HEAD>Man Suspected in 13 Robberies Mugs for Camera Just before Arrest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man sought as a suspect in five
bank robberies and eight other holdups mugged for a television
camera and taunted police two hours before his arrest.
   Milton Bradley Rogers, 22, who police identified last week as
their suspect, was arrested Thursday night as he sat in a car,
ending a two-month investigation by police and FBI agents.
   Rogers is accused in 13 holdups since Aug. 24. In each robbery,
the clerk or teller was handed a threatening note demanding money,
police said.
   Two hours before his arrest, Rogers spotted a WOTV film crew in
front of the Hall of Justice and asked a cameraman to take his
picture saying he was a sought-after suspect. Rogers proclaimed his
innocence on camera, identifying himself by a tattoo on his arm
that said ``Milton.'' He boasted that he had walked by the police
desk and no one recognized him.
   ``I've been around police, and they haven't got me,'' Rogers
said in the interview. ``So far they have said I've been doing all
the robberies. I don't know what they want from me, I haven't done
anything.''
   The skeptical photographers then walked into the police station
to report what happened, and police identified Rogers from film
shown them later at the station.
   Police spokesman Lt. Victor Gillis wasn't amused by Rogers'
footage.
   ``If in fact this was his attempt to be cute, I would suggest we
got the last laugh,'' Gillis said.
   It was a coincidence, Gillis said, that a vice officer spotted
Rogers sitting in a car. Gillis said the arresting officer quoted
Rogers as saying: ``Can't we wait until the cameras arrive?''
   Rogers was scheduled to be arraigned today in one of the bank
robberies while warrants are prepared charging him with other
heists, Gillis said.

<TEXT>
   The prime minister on Friday ordered an
investigation into reports that a computer hacker rummaged through
his electronic files and those of other Cabinet members.
   The newspaper De Standaard reported that a man, using a personal
computer, for three months looked through Prime Minister Wilfried
Martens' electronic mail and other items, including the agenda of
his weekly Cabinet meetings.
   While he awaits the outcome of the Brussels prosecutor's office
inquiry, Martens said he has ordered tighter security to protect
information in his computer.
   The newspaper said the man showed one of its reporters this week
how he broke into the computer ``to read the personal files of
about 10 government ministers,'' including those of Martens.
   It said the man identified himself as ``Wepuntem'' _ long-hand
in Dutch for the initials ``W.M.'' _ and used Martens' password
code of nine letters, ciphers and punctuation marks.
   ``What is more, during the demonstration, he ran into another
`burglar'... with whom he briefly conversed'' via computer, the
newspaper said.
   In recent months, the man said he read the prime minister's
electronic mail along with classified information about the killing
of a British soldier by the outlawed Irish Republican Army in
Ostend on Aug. 12, according to the newspaper.

it's ``as inevitable as the swallows returning to Capistrano'' that

But, says Arledge, ``This time I think he will.'' Donaldson, a

   Thousands of patches to be worn by U.S.
Customs Service employees commemorating the agency's 200th
anniversary were seized by the department's own inspectors as an
illegal shipment.
   The shipment of 5,000 patches was seized Thursday at a Peace
Bridge warehouse in Buffalo, N.Y., after agents noticed that the
packages violated federal regulations requiring a label specifying
the country of origin, said Robert Tobias, president of the
National Treasury Employees Union.
   ``It was then that our members, the inspectors, saw that the
packages contained Customs patches made outside the U.S. being
shipped from Canada,'' said Tobias, whose union represents some
13,000 Customs Service employees.
   Commissioner William van Raab had ordered the patches earlier
this year and issued directives that they be sewn on every Custom
employee's uniform to commemorate the agency's 1989 bicentennial,
Tobias said.
   ``We have buy-in-America in all our contracts and this
contractor inadvertently had some of the patches made in Toronto
rather than Buffalo,'' said David Hoover, a Customs Service
spokesman. ``The inspector who found it, doing his job, just
happens to be the president of the union local up there.''
   Hoover, a Customs Service spokesman, said a contractor, not the
agency, imported the items. He described the incident as ``a funny
little story.''
   But Tobias didn't see it that way.
   ``This is perhaps the most unpatriotic and stupid blunder the
commissioner has made in his blunder-ridden tenure as head of the
agency,'' he said.
   George King, a union spokesman, said Customs Service workers had
been told they would have to pay $2.50 for each patch but that a
bill of lading with the shipment listed their cost at 59 cents each.
   Hoover said, however, that the patches are being provided to
inspectors without charge as part of their uniform allowance.
   The bill of lading, King said, listed Grant Emblems Limited of
Toronto as the manufacturer-shipper and Voyage Emblems of New York
City as the importer. Included was an invoice to the Customs
Service.

   With 18 days till the election, Democrat Michael Dukakis said on
network talk shows today he is counting on more TV exposure to give
voters ``a better sense of who I am.'' Rival George Bush declared
he wants to be remembered as the president who helped ban chemical
weapons.
   Dukakis, who has been campaigning for more than a year and a
half, said today that voters are only now ``beginning to focus in''
and make their decisions. He said he was ``cautiously optimistic''
about his chances though ``we're behind a little bit.'' Polls have
shown him trailing Bush.

<HEAD>First School Dance Since Racial Integration is Big Success</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MERIDIAN, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Northeast Lauderdale High School's first
dance since racial integration two decades ago was a success, in
spite of a large force of chaperones and adult control of what
music could be played.
   ``I think it's about time for a dance ... It's been too long,''
15-year-old Michael Cozart said Thursday night as many of about 500
students paired off.
   ``It could have happened years ago, but there are old feelings
and old ideas,'' said Principal Roger Wright.
   Northeast Lauderdale's last school-sponsored dance was a
homecoming ball in the cafeteria in 1967, officials said.
   Many public schools in Mississippi discontinued school-sponsored
functions such as dances and proms with desegregation in 1969 and
1970, and only in recent years have some schools revived
sanctioning of such activities.
   Tracy Anderson, an 18-year-old 11th-grader, was one of the more
popular dance partners. Tracy, who is black, danced with both white
and black partners.
   ``If they want to dance with me, I'll dance,'' she said. ``I
think this is great. It's been 21 years. It's about time we got
something together.''
   Northeast Lauderdale High School, located about 10 miles
northeast of Meridian, has 1,176 students in grades seven through
12. About 60 percent of the students are white.
   Last week, the Lauderdale County School Board voted 3-0, with
two members absent, to approve Thursday night's dance.
   School board members set strict rules before approving the
function, including a requirement that music receive prior approval
from a committee of three adults.
   School board members also considered a ban on slow dancing. But
they relented after complaints from students.
   The music-review committee ruled out a number of records,
including those by such acid-rock groups as AC-DC, Def Leppard and
Molly Hatchet.
   ``We didn't want songs with objectionable lyrics,'' said
Lauderdale County School Superintendent Randy Hodges.
   ``We eliminated songs with the word sex and those about sex,''
said Harold White, president of the Northeast Parent-Teacher
Association.
   On watch during the dance were 36 adult chaperones _ 21 men and
15 women.
   There were no incidents, and no alcoholic beverages were in
evidence inside or outside of the gymnasium. A few students smoked
cigarettes outside.
   ``Teachers have said in the past that with desegregation there
could be problems,'' said Shawn Hannington, 16, an 11th-grader.
``But I think we all get along with everyone. There are no racial
problems.''

   Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd, usually a
formal and reserved man, danced on the Senate floor Friday in
celebration of the imminent adjournment of the 100th Congress.
   The West Virginia Democrat showed up for his usual morning
meeting with reporters sporting a fire-engine red vest and a blue
tie emblazoned with bright red and white stars.
   Byrd calls the flashy tie his ``sine die tie,'' in joking
reference to the adjournment of Congress, ``sine die,'' meaning
adjournment with no set date for return.
   Standing at his desk, Byrd grabbed the lapels of his dark suit
and pulled them back, exposing the red vest. He then did a little
dance, dipping and swaying from side to side in what one reporter
called the ``Vaudeville Two-Step.''
   Looking forward to what could be a long final day, Byrd also
sported a red badge, proclaiming, ``I've Got Trouble All Day Long.''
   Byrd is stepping down as Senate floor leader at year's end to
become chairman of the Appropriations Committee, assuming the
Democrats retain control of the Senate in the Nov. 8 election.

<TEXT>
   Vice President George Bush, stumping through
this key industrial state, today spelled out the steps he would
take to achieve his long-stated goal of a worldwide ban on
biological and chemical warfare.
   Bush, in an address before 1,200 people at the University of
Toledo, said he wants to be known as the president who dealt ``with
this terrible scourge,'' which has gained new urgency with the
recent use of chemical weapons in the Iran-Iraq war.
   The Dukakis campaign has accused Bush of being hypocritical on
the chemical warfare issue since in 1983 and 1986 he cast
tie-breaking votes in the Senate in support of chemical weapons.
   Bush also put in a pitch for the Strategic Defense Initiative,
saying that ``while doing all we can to stop or control missile and
chemical proliferation, we must also ... develop a defense against
this threat.''
   In a slap at his Democratic rival, Michael Dukakis, Bush said,
``The last thing we or our allies need at a time when ballistic
missiles are proliferating is someone who regards strategic defense
as a fraud or a fantasy.''
   Bush was also campaigning in Dayton, Troy and Lancaster, Ohio,
before returning to Washington tonight.
   Bush said, ``Just as we are making headway on the nuclear
problem the proliferation of chemical arms and ballistic missiles
challenges our security.''
   Recalling a recent picture of a mother trying to protect her
child ``against the invisible wind of death, I thought we had
relegated the horrors of chemical warfare to the history books.''
Bush was referring to photos of a Kurdish mother after Iraqis used
chemical weapons in an attack on a Kurdish village this summer.
   He proposed:
   _ On-site inspection on demand of suspicious facilities or
plants.
   _ Tightening controls on the transfer of chemical technology and
weapons.
   _ Including the Soviets and Chinese ``and perhaps others'' in a
proposed mandatory missile technology control regime. That regime,
set up in 1987, is now voluntary for the U.S. and its allies.
   ``If I'm elected president, if I'm remembered for anything, it
would be this: a complete and total ban on chemical weapons,'' Bush
said.
   Thursday evening, Bush shared a dais with his rival at the Al
Smith Dinner for Catholic charities in New York City, and the two
kept to the best tradition of the glittering event and traded
one-liners for political punches.
   Looking out at the tuxedoes and evening gowns, Bush quipped, ``I
haven't seen so many people so well dressed since I went to a
come-as-you-are party in Kennebunkport.''
   He said he had tried out several jokes on his wife Barbara,
telling her:, ``Bar, this sounds a little like Johnny Carson. She
looked at me and said, `George, I know Johnny Carson. Johnny Carson
is a friend of mine, and George you're no Johnny Carson.''
   Bush was also stumping today in Dayton and Lancaster, Ohio.
   Earlier Thursday, in appearances in normally Democratic
territory in the New York City borough of Queens and South River,
N.J., Bush pummeled Dukakis on crime and national defense.
   At an emotion-packed rally before 1,500 students and police at
Christ the King High School in Queens, Bush received the
endorsement of the New York City Police Benevolent Association and
other police groups, and the shield of the late Eddie Byrne, the
young New York officer killed last February as he guarded the home
of a witness in a drug case.
   His father, Matthew Byrne, a retired police lieutenant, said,
``We believe that he and his administration will stand up for us.''
He defended the Reagan administration against charges that it has
not done enough in the war on drugs, and attacked New York Gov.
Mario Cuomo and his predecessor, Hugh Carey, for repeatedly vetoing
death penalty bills.
   Bush, with hundreds of blue-uniformed officers lined up in the
bleachers at his back and a paralyzed officer, Steve McDonald, in a
wheelchair beside him, said, ``To all of my many statements about
crime, this key national endorsement is a great, big exclamation
point and I am proud of it.
   ``When a police officer is murdered, the killer should pay with
his life,'' Bush said to the cheering crowd.
   ``We've heard a lot of tough talk about drugs from my opponent.
... I challenge (him) to drop the rhetoric and stand up publicly''
for the drug bill pending in Congress, which includes the death
penalty for those who kill during drug crimes. Dukakis opposes
capital punishment.
   He also exhorted the Catholic school students, who had taken a
pledge beforehand to avoid drugs, to stand firm against drug abuse.
``Your middle-class money pays for the bullets in the guns that
kill the officers that we honor here today, and we've got to stop
it as a nation,'' said Bush.

   Shiite Moslem kidnappers holding at least
two American hostages threatened today to punish them in
retaliation for Israel's air attacks on Palestinian and pro-Iranian
guerrilla bases in Lebanon.
   The threat came in typewritten statements in Arabic signed by
the Islamic Jihad, the pro-Iranian faction holding American
journalist Terry Anderson and educator Thomas Sutherland.
   Israeli warplanes and helicopters attacked guerrilla strongholds
in Lebanon today in retaliation for a bombing that killed seven
Israeli soldiers. Fifteen people were killed and 35 wounded in the
air raids, police said.
   In Washington, State Department spokesman Charles Redman said:
   ``We deplore the loss of life and the needless suffering of
people on both sides, Lebanese and Israeli alike. We remain deeply
concerned about the tragic pattern of action and reaction in
Lebanon.''
   One of the two identical statements attributed to Islamic Jihad,
or Islamic Holy War, went to a Western news agency with an instant
color photograph of Anderson.
   The same statement without a photograph was delivered to
Beirut's independent An-Nahar newspaper.
   The statement paid tribute to the Shiite Moslem suicide bomber
who killed seven Israeli soldiers in Israel's self-designated
``security zone'' in south Lebanon on Wednesday, and it denounced
Israel's retaliatory air strikes.
   ``Committing this stupidity and this attack shall not pass
without a punishment. The criminal America must realize it will not
get away with what it has done, especially in connection with the
hostages we hold, so that will be a lesson to whoever strikes at
the dignity and glory of our people and mujahedeen (holy
fighters).''
   Anderson, 40, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated
Press, was kidnapped March 16, 1985. Sutherland, 57, acting dean of
agriculture at the American University of Beirut, was abducted June
9, 1985.
   In the photo, Anderson, with a bushy beard, was looking directly
into the camera. He was wearing a Commodore Hotel T-shirt, as he
wore when he was kidnapped.
   The photograph was similar to one released April 10, when
Islamic Jihad threatened to harm the hostages if a Kuwaiti jetliner
hijacked to Cyprus was stormed to free the passengers.
   The Israeli jets scored direct hits on ammunition dumps and
training bases of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God,
and Yasser Arafat's Palestine Liberation Organization, said a
police spokesman in Lebanon.
   On Thursday, Israel's leaders vowed to retaliate against
Hezbollah, which claimed responsibility for killing the Israeli
soldiers Wednesday. Hezbollah is an umbrella group for Shiite
groups believed holding most of the 14 foreign hostages, who
include nine Americans.
   The Lebanese police official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said 12 Israeli fighter-bombers were involved in
simultaneous air strikes near Sidon, provincial capital of south
Lebanon, and in the eastern town of Mashgara.
   Helicopter gunships later joined the attack on Mashgara, police
said.
   Eight people were killed and 15 wounded in the Sidon area, and
seven were killed and 20 wounded in Mashgara, the spokesman said.
   He said clouds of black smoke hung over the stricken bases on
the outskirts of Sidon, 25 miles south of Beirut, and Mashgara, 15
miles to the east.
   The Israeli military command said the raids occurred about 10
a.m. and were aimed at ``Palestinian targets in the Sidon area and
Hezbollah command posts in the villages of Mashgara and
Al-Luwayzah.''
   The village of Al-Luwayzah is about two miles southeast of
Metulla, where the car bombing occurred. The military statement
said at least six U.S.-made F-16's took part in the raids.
   Lebanese police said an ammunition depot belonging to Hezbollah
was hit near the Palestinian refugee camp of Mieh Mieh, on the
outskirts of Sidon, and set off a series of explosions.
   A Palestinian guerrilla training base was hit in Mieh Mieh. The
planes also blasted targets in the nearby Ein el-Hilweh refugee
camp.
   Shortly after the air attack, Israeli troops in the hills in
south Lebanon fired on Mieh Mieh and Al-Luwayzeh with long-range
howitzers.
   U.N. peacekeeping sources said Israeli helicopters also attacked
Meidoun, four miles south of Mashgara.
   The Lebanese police spokesman said warplanes also hit targets in
the Ein el-Hilweh refugee camps, also outside Sidon.
   The warplanes drew heavy anti-aircraft fire from Palestinian and
Hezbollah gunners. No hits were reported.
   Hezbollah, an umbrella for Shiite Moslem militants loyal to
Iran's Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, claimed responsibility for the
car bombing that also wounded eight Israeli soldiers and two
Lebanese women.
   Israeli officials often have charged that Arafat's PLO
guerrillas and Hezbollah cooperate in the guerrilla warfare against
Israeli troops and allied Lebanese militiamen in south Lebanon.
   The bombing was the deadliest attack against the Israelis since
March 1985, when a similar suicide car bomb killed 12 Israelis and
wounded 14.
   Israel withdrew from most of south Lebanon in June 1985, three
years after invading the country, and established a security zone,
about six to 10 miles deep, north of its border to prevent
guerrilla infiltrations from Lebanon.
   The air raid was the 16th on Lebanon this year. By police count,
68 people were killed and 108 wounded in the previous attacks since
Jan. 3.

   Hurricane Joan resumed its deadly trek
toward Central America with 110 mph winds today after heavy rains
pounded Venezuela and pushed the storm's death toll to at least 26.
   Costa Rica joined Nicaragua in declaring a national emergency.
The storm threatens ``devastation and death,'' said Manuel Obando,
president of Costa Rica's National Emergency Committee.
   Bob Sheets, director of the National Hurricane Center in Coral
Gables, Fla., said: ``There is going to be considerable loss of
life ... assuming it moves that way, and assuming those heavy rains
will hit there with mudslides.
   ``It is moving west. There is now a hurricane warning up the
coast of Nicaragua. ... In Costa Rica, flash floods, mudslides
(could hit) all over that whole area of Central America.''
   The rains unleashed mudslides Wednesday and Thursday that
swallowed wooden huts and left at least 11 people dead in the
poorest neighborhoods of Caracas, Venezuela.
   The storm killed 15 people in Colombia, injured 50, and left
tens of thousands homeless when it swept the Guajira peninsula on
Monday.
   A mudslide blocked the Pan-American Highway in Panama 100 miles
from the Costa Rican border, authorities said today. They said a
pile of mud more than 15 feet high dislodged by heavy rains before
the storm brought traffic to a standstill. Heavy rain continued to
fall in Panama.
   More than 37,000 people fled coastal areas of Nicaragua and
Costa Rica, which declared a hurricane watch. Hurricane warnings
were in effect for the Colombian islands of San Andres and
neighboring Albuquerque and Providencia.
   ``It's better to leave before we get killed,'' said Teresa
Wilson, who toted a plastic bag stuffed with clothes and fled the
Nicaraguan coastal village of Bluff with her seven children.
   The Nicaraguan government appealed to the international
community to be prepared to lend assistance.
   At 12 noon EDT today, Joan's center was about 60 miles south of
San Andres and about 150 miles east of Bluefields, Nicaragua, near
latitude 11.6 north and longitude 81.5 west.
   After stalling most of the day Thursday, the hurricane resumed
its drift westward and was expected to continue slowly in that
direction today. Maximum sustained winds were 110 mph.
   Nicaraguan officials worried about the readiness of government
agencies, relief organizations and coastal residents, some of whom
live in wooden homes on stilts.
   ``We make a formal call upon the international community to
respond in rapid fashion with its cooperation,'' said Alejandro
Martinez Cuenca, Nicaragua's planning minister.
   Cuenca said if Joan continued straight for Nicaragua, ``the
economic consequences would be enormously severe and would force
greater sacrifices upon the people.''
   About 7,000 people fled Nicaragua's remote Miskito Coast and two
small islands by boat, and schools were closed nationwide.
   Hundreds of people arrived by boat Thursday afternoon in Rama,
180 miles east of the capital, and were taken by military and
civilian trucks to a school in the provincial capital of Juigalpa,
85 miles east of Managua.
   ``We decided to bring our children and to leave our husbands to
guard our homes,'' said Johnny Hunter, a 29-year-old Bluefields
woman.
   President Daniel Ortega enacted an emergency law banning
communications media from reporting unauthorized news about Joan.
   The opposition daily La Prensa called the decree ``absurd and
illegal'' and said the law made it ``legally impossible to report
on the hurricane.''
   In Costa Rica, the National Emergency Council said at least
30,000 people were evacuated from Puerto Limon, a town of 20,000
about 100 miles southeast of the capital of San Jose, and 14 other
towns along the northeast coast.
   About 350 people decided to stay in Puerto Limon and ride out
the storm, said an official with the National Assistance Committee
who spoke on condition of anonymity. Police patrolled near-empty
streets to prevent looting.
   ``I will stay here, because I have faith in God,'' said Clifford
Pryes, 54, a sailor and lifetime resident of Puerto Limon.
   Education Minister Francisco Pacheco said schools and
universities throughout the country would close today until the
storm was over.
   Costa Rican officials feared Joan could destroy many of the
20,000 banana plantations along the coast.
   Officials said Costa Rica has never been hit by a hurricane in
recorded history, and the last one that hit Nicaragua was in 1911.

   President Reagan charged Friday that
Michael Dukakis, if elected, would choose liberal activists soft on
crime to fill Supreme Court vacancies.
   In a speech prepared for some 12,000 students and Republicans
gathered at Western Kentucky University, Reagan said, ``I've
appointed very different justices to the United States Supreme
Court, and so will George Bush.''
   Reagan cited unnamed ``legal authorities'' as saying that
Dukakis' appointments to the Massachusetts Supreme Court have been
``fervent proponents of the ... liberal social agenda, committed to
imposing it ... through judicial decree.''
   White House press spokesman Ben Jarrett, asked to identify the
authorities cited by Reagan, said the president got the quotation
from an article written in a recent Wall Street Journal op-ed piece
by Charles J. Cooper, a former Reagan administration assistant
attorney general who now is in private law practice in Washington.
   Dukakis said Friday he has appointed 130 judges in
Massachusetts. ``Some of them have been Republicans, some of them
have been Democrats. I don't put them through a political litmus
test,'' Dukakis said on CBS.
   During a campaign trip to North Carolina and Kentucky, Reagan
hammered away at a variety of familiar themes, including his
argument that Americans must elect more conservative candidates to
Congress.
   His trip into the South took Reagan off the course of recent
campaign outings that have been targeted on key battleground states
in the Midwest.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Reagan decided to
visit North Carolina and Kentucky because Vice President Bush is
``looking good in both states. We think we've got a good shot at
winning'' them.
   In a speech to 4,500 GOP activists at the civic arena in
Raleigh, N.C., Reagan noted the influx of high-technology companies
to nearby Research Triangle Park, proclaiming his planned Star Wars
missile defense system ``wildly successful.''
   ``SDI (Strategic Defense Initiative)is no fantasy,'' he said.
``It's a reality, and it's going to shape the future as long as
there is a Republican in the White House.''
   Reagan also said Bush has shown he can ``keep a cool head in hot
crises. ... I have given him some of the most sensitive and
difficult tasks that we've had, and he's never let me or the
country down.'' Reagan did not specify what situations had allowed
him to observe Bush's behavior in crisis situations.
   In the Western Kentucky University address, Reagan did not
invoke Dukakis' name. But he maintained that the seven-member state
supreme court in Massachusetts _ known there as Supreme Judicial
Court _ has issued a host of rulings slanted in favor of the
perpetrators of crime instead of its victims.
   ``They have opposed the death penalty and opposed mandatory
sentences for drug dealers,'' he said. ``They believe that
directing teachers to lead classes in the Pledge of Allegiance is
unconstitutional and have voted to strike down a ban on child
pornography.''
   Thomas F. Maffie, president of the 22,000-member Massachusetts
Bar association, said he thought Reagan overstated the liberal bent
of the high state court.
   In a telephone interview from his Boston law office, Maffie said
that Dukakis had appointed two of the seven judges on that court,
although the governor did elevate Edward F. Hennessey, appointed by
another governor, to the chief justice post.
   ``I don't think you can cast it (the court) as liberal or
conservative,'' Maffie said. ``I think you can cast it as a
particularly competent and respected court.''
   The three most liberal members of the U.S. Supreme Court _
justices Thurgood Marshall, William Brennan and Harry Blackmun _
will all be 80 or over by inauguration day, and the question of
filling vacancies surfaced during Bush's Oct. 13 debate with
Dukakis.
   Bush said he would not subject judicial prospects to an
ideological ``litmus test'' but said he would people dedicated to
interpreting the law instead of rewriting it.
   Dukakis rapped Bush for supporting Reagan's ill-fated nomination
of federal appellate judge Robert H. Bork, whose nomination was
defeated in the Senate.

   A special federal advisory committee today
tentatively reaffirmed its recommendation that fetal tissue from
induced abortions can be used for medical research.
   The 21-member panel was careful to avoid linking its
recommendation with the morality of abortion.
   ``It is of moral relevance that human fetal tissue for research
has been obtained from induced abortions,'' the draft language
said. ``However, in light of the fact that abortion is legal and
that the research in question is intended to achieve significant
medical goals, the panel concludes that the use of such tissure is
acceptable public policy.''
   The report will not become final until the written version
worked out over five days of meetings is circulated by mail to all
the panel's members for any minor editing changes.
   The vote on the key recommendation was 13-3. Five committee
members were absent.
   The National Institutes of Health committee hopes to give the
recommendation final approval by Nov. 30.
   A standing NIH advisory committee is scheduled to meet the
following day to begin another round of deliberations to be
completed Jan. 3.
   The detailed schedule laid out by NIH officials calls for NIH
Director James Wyngaarden to forward both reports, along with his
own recommendation, to superiors at the Department of Health and
Human Services on Jan. 13.
   The elaborate timetable suggests that no final decision on the
issue will be made during the final weeks of the Reagan
administration.
   Medical researchers are optimistic that implanting certain brain
cells from aborted fetuses can lead to effective treatments for a
number of diseases, with diabetes and Parkinson's the best
candidates.
   The advisory committee was formed after NIH researchers sought
permission to do such experimental transplants on Parkinson's
patients.
   The thorniest matter facing the special committee today in its
last scheduled face-to-face meeting was whether the report will say
fetal tissue transplant research is ``morally acceptable'' or
simply ``acceptable.''
   A number of committee members are philosophically opposed to
abortion and reluctant to agree to any recommendation on using
aborted fetal tissue that would imply a sanction of abortion.
   Daniel Robinson, chairman of the psychology department at
Georgetown University in Washington, is among the panelists who _
although opposed to abortion on principle _ has indicated a
willingness to back a recommendation that fetal tissue research
proceed if the final draft is narrowly couched not to imply a
sanction of abortion.
   ``This is one of the worrisome ethical issues of our age and no
government agency can proceed without acknowledging that fact,''
Robinson said Thursday.
   The chairman of the committee, retired federal appeals Judge
Arlin M. Adams of Philadelphia, said: ``It seems the mainstream
consensus is we're not taking a position on abortion as such. ...
   ``We must separate the issue of abortion from medical research
or we will be where we started'' when the panel convened initially
last month, Adams added.
   Father James T. Burtchaell, a professor of theology at the
University of Notre Dame and a committee member, was particularly
displeased with news accounts that said the panel's straw vote last
month to recommend going forward with fetal tissue research
amounted to finding it was ``morally acceptable.''
   However, Burtchaell did not dispute that a majority of the
committee clearly was inclined to recommend federal backing for
such research once it agrees on precise wording.
   The National Right to Life News has conceded that it is a
foregone conclusion the committee will recommend proceeding with
the research, probably with 17 of the 21 members eventually voting
in favor of it.

   The House approved legislation today
authorizing $1.5 billion in Corps of Engineers flood control and
navigation projects in 12 states.
   The bill was passed on a 355-2 vote and sent to President
Reagan, who was expectecd to sign it into law.
   The legislation _ approved by voice vote in the Senate _
authorizes construction of the various projects but does not
provide any federal money to do so. Money to pay the federal share
would have to be approved through separate appropriations
legislation.
   Exactly when the money would begin flowing to these projects is
unknown. This year, the water projects appropriations bill
contained no money for new construction starts.
   Following are the project authorizations proposed in the
legislation passed Thursday:
   _California: Lower Mission Creek, flood control, total cost,
$10.4 million; federal share, $5.9 million.
   _Florida: Ft. Pierce Harbor, upgrading existing harbor and
adding access channel, total cost, $6.7 million; federal share,
$4.3 million.
   _Florida: Nassau County, construction of jetties, total cost,
$5.8 million; federal share, $4.6 million.
   _Florida: Port Sutton Channel, construction of deeper channel,
total cost, $2.7 million; federal share, $1.6 million.
   _Illinois: Chicago land underflow, flood control reservoirs,
total cost, $419 million; federal share, $314.3 million.
   _Illinois and Kentucky: Lower Ohio River, Olmsted locks and dam
replacement, total cost, $775 million; federal share, $775 million.
   _Kentucky: Hazard, channel enlargement, total cost, $7.5
million; federal share, $5.6 million.

   An Iranian-born professor at the University of
Virginia on Friday described as ``absolutely false'' an Israeli
newspaper report that claimed he had served as a mediator in secret
U.S.-Iranian talks.
   R.K. Ramazani, a political science professor for 36 years at the
university in Charlottesville, Va., said he was particularly
disturbed by the report that mentioned the name of his school.
   ``Those key paragraphs are absolutely false,'' Ramazani said,
referring to a story in the The Nation, an English-language weekly
newspaper that began publishing in Israel last month.
   State Department spokesman Charles Redman has also criticized
reports that have appeared in the new paper, saying the publication
prints a ``steady diet of baloney.''
   In an unattributed report published Oct. 7, the paper claimed
the U.S. government agreed to pay $7 million in ransom to
pro-Iranian Lebanese Shiite Moslem extremists holding American
hostages in Lebanon.
   Both Secretary of State George Shultz and Iranian Foreign
Minister Akbar Velayati have categorically denied that the two
countries have opened talks on the hostages or other subjects.
   Ramazani, in a telephone interview, said that an Oct. 12 story
in the Israeli newspaper claimed that the professor visited Tehran
in the weeks before Iraq and Iran accepted a cease-fire in August
to end their eight-year old war.
   The paper, quoting unidentified sources, said Ramazani played an
``important role'' in convincing the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini,
Iran's leader, to accept a cease-fire.
   The story, entitled ``Khomeini Backs Hostage Contacts Mediated
by Iran-Born Professor,'' dealt broadly with alleged U.S.-Iranian
talks on hostages and other matters.
   Ramazani, a naturalized American who has taught at the
University of Virginia for 36 years, said he has not visited Tehran
since 1975 and has not ``had any contacts with U.S. or Iranian
officials at all'' recently. Ramazani is on leave from teaching
this year to write a book.
   From time to time over the past decade, Ramazani said he has
consulted with State Department officials soliciting his views on
Iran's foreign policy, his speciality.
   He said his last visit to the department came in 1987 when he
and other academics were invited to have lunch with Assistant
Secretary of State Richard Murphy.
   Hesh Kestin, the publisher of the Israeli newspaper, could not
be reached for comment; the paper's telephone number is not listed
in Tel Aviv or Jerusalem, an operator said.

   Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos said they were simple folks, but
they lived in an ornate citadel of self-glorification from which
they ruled the Philippines with a curious mixture of dictatorship
and flexibility, reform and stagnation.
   For most of his 20 years as president, Filipinos adored the
brilliant lawyer and shrewd politician, who by his own disputed
account was a great war hero.
   The end came in February 1986, when the military helped a
``people power'' uprising that put President Corazon Aquino in
power and forced the Marcoses to flee.
   In the presidential palace, they left behind luxuries ranging
from exquisite to garish, flattering paintings that included one
called ``Ferdinand the Brave,'' and Imelda's shoes in their fabled
thousands.
   She had a bulletproof boudoir with gold bathroom fixtures and
many religious artifacts, some of ivory, others embedded with
precious stones. A nun who saw the voluptuous realm soon after
Imelda left it said she threw up.
   Marcos, now 71, is accused of looting billions of dollars in
public funds and stashing it abroad.
   About those shoes, Mrs. Marcos said:
   ``I was governor of Metro Manila, an area of 1,000 shoemakers. .
.. They make millions of pairs of shoes. When I was seen in our
native products, I promoted them. If each maker over 20 years set
three new models to show off, it would be 3,000 pairs of shoes. I
would need that many shoes like a hole in my head, but ... I'd wear
each to please them.''
   The Marcoses live as exiles in Hawaii and the Aquino government
has turned their former palace suite into a sort of ``museum of
greed,'' where one employee's duty is keeping all the shoes shined.
   Filipinos still rally in his support, but their numbers dwindle.
Marcos said after more than two years in exile that he recognized
Mrs. Aquino as president and would not try to overthrow her, but
she has refused to allow him back even for the funeral of his
mother, who died last May.
   During his tenure, Marcos kept his Pacific archipelago
pro-American and in return enjoyed the support of five American
presidents.
   He built nearly 65,000 miles of roads and more than 3,300
schools, and made progress in rural electrification, but his
country remained poor. He also dismissed Congress, rewrote the
constitution, imposed martial law for eight years, jailed tens of
thousands of opponents and was accused of widespread human rights
abuses.
   Marcos rode to power in 1965 on the promise of social reform. He
initially was hailed as the standard bearer of a new class of Asian
leaders who did not come from the elite of the colonial era, but
his 20 years in power were marked by unprecedented graft and
corruption.
   He entered politics after World War II, during which he says he
was a hero. U.S. records show most of his medals were awarded after
the war when he was a powerful politician.
   In 1954, he married Imelda Romualdez, a 26-year-old beauty queen
from a poor branch of a prominent family in the central Philippines
family. She bore him three children: Imelda in 1955, Ferdinand Jr.
in 1958 and Irene in 1960.
   Some critics blamed Marcos' ultimate downfall on his wife's
flamboyance and exercise of power.
   She told interviews after they arrived in Hawaii: ``All those
I've been good to and I've helped over the years have disappeared .
.. and I'm not being cynical when I say you'd be surprised how few
friends you end up with.''
   Hawaiian Filipinos, she said, ``made life bearable ... the small
little ones in the Filipino community who gave us solace, comfort,
support, love, everything, even food.
   ``These were the kind of little people who came to the palace.
We gave them courtesy, said hello, had our pictures taken,'' she
said.

   Country music star Little Jimmy Dickens
and his wife won the praises of Gov. Ned McWherter for posting
$2,500 bond so an indigent woman could be released from jail.
   McWherter, in a letter to the couple, cited their ``compassion
and kindness'' for enabling Lydia Roberts to get out of jail in
Manchester.
   The couple posted her bond Oct. 12 after reading news accounts
about her. Ms. Roberts, a divorcee and mother of two, was jailed
for writing two worthless checks totaling $2,106. She had spent 99
days in jail.
   ``I always knew we had the best people in the world right here
in Tennessee,'' McWherter said.
   Dickens is a Grand Ole Opry star and member of the Country Music

   An upcoming auction of art and antiques will
feature the collection of Claus von Bulow and his wife, Sunny, whom
he was accused of trying to murder, The New York Times reported
Friday.
   ``Sotheby's lips are sealed, but mention its Oct. 28 and 29 sale
entitled `Property from a Private Collection' to any serious dealer
or collector and the reaction will immediately be nods or winks,''
the Times said.
   ``We have been asked by the consignor not to identify them,''
said Diana Levitt, spokeswoman for the auction house.
   Von Bulow has been living in Europe since he was acquitted in
1985 in a retrial of charges that he twice tried to murder his wife
with insulin injections. Mrs. von Bulow remains in an irreversible
coma.
   The offerings, which Sotheby's predicts will bring between $6
million and $7.5 million, reportedly include furnishings from
Clarendon Court, the von Bulows' mansion in Newport, R.I., and
pieces from their Manhattan apartment.

   Skid Row's Los Angeles Mission has a little
more money in the bank thanks to a celebrity benefit buffet at the
home of best-selling author Sidney Sheldon, who had actor Kirk
Douglas as a co-host.
   ``I feel strongly that, since I come from immigrant parents,
since I've been born in abject poverty, since I've been in the
Bowery in New York looking for a meal, that the work that the Los
Angeles Mission is doing to help the homeless is something that we
have to support,'' Douglas, 72, said Thursday.
   The guest list included Sidney Poitier, Jaclyn Smith, Zsa Zsa
Gabor and Red Buttons.
   Douglas detailed his struggle with poverty in his recently
published autobiography, ``The Ragman's Son.'' Sheldon's books
include ``The Other Side of Midnight'' and ``Windmills of the
Gods.''
   No immediate figure was available on how much money was raised.

but she added:
   ``I'm really happy to give women the courage to do the thing

<HEAD>Soviets May Request Extradition of War Crimes Suspect</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOAN FISCHER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former U.S. resident convicted
by a Soviet court of World War II atrocities could be extradited to
the Soviet Union if it waives the death penalty, a West German
official said Friday.
   A Soviet Embassy spokesman told a West German television network
that the Kremlin may request the extradition of Boleslav Maikovskis
from West Germany.
   The question of whether to extradite Maikovskis, 84, comes as
Chancellor Helmut Kohl prepares to travel to Moscow next week for
talks with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   The Soviet Union in 1965 sentenced Maikovskis to death in
absentia for his role in burning down a village and killing
civilians as a pro-Nazi police commander in his native country of
Latvia.
   West Germany has no death penalty, and would probably not agree
to extradite Maikovskis to a country where the death sentence
awaits him, a justice official said Friday.
   ``But an extradition could theoretically be possible if, for
example, the Soviet Union agreed to withhold the death penalty in
this case,'' said Dortmund Prosecutor Klaus Schacht in a telephone
interview.
   Maikovskis is being held in a West German prison while
authorities investigate the shooting deaths of at least 130 men,
women and children in the Latvian village of Audrine during World
War II.
   ``Maikovskis could well face a criminal trial here,'' Schacht
said, but he said he could not estimate how long investigations
would take.
   Schacht works out of Dortmund's war crimes prosecution office,
which is responsible for the Muenster district where Maikovskis was
taken into custody Wednesday.
   The Mainz-based ZDF television network broadcast an interview
Thursday in which a Soviet Embassy spokesman said the Kremlin may
request Maikovski's extradition.
   ``The Soviet Union is reserving the right to officially request
Maikovskis' extradition,'' Soviet Embassy spokesman Viktor Gutyev
said in the television interview. ``We take this problem very
seriously.''
   Both the Justice Ministry and the Foreign Ministry are
responsible for extradition requests, a Justice Ministry official
said Friday.
   ``The Soviet Union has not requested Maikovskis' extradition,''
Justice Ministry spokesman Juergen Schmid said, declining further
comment.
   West German authorities arrested Maikovskis at his Muenster
residence late Wednesday. He probably had been living in the
country at least since November 1987, when he applied to the West
German government for political asylum.
   The West German federal office responsible for granting asylum
is expected to decide on Maikovskis' request by the end of
November, authorities said.
   Before 1987, Maikovskis was a resident of Mineola, N.Y., where
he lived since 1951. He fled the United States at an undetermined
date while facing deportation. U.S. deportation proceedings began
in 1976, but the proceedings were held up by several appeals.
   The Supreme Court denied his last appeal in 1986.

   A sharp increase in lines of credit extended
by U.S. allies to the Soviet Union will not harm Western security
as long as any resulting loans are made at market rates and do not
enhance Soviet military capability, the State Department said
Friday.
   ``The United States does not oppose commercial lending at market
rates aimed at supporting an expansion of non-strategic trade with
the Soviet Union,'' department spokesman Charles Redman said.
   ``The U.S. does strongly oppose the notion of subsidized loans
to the Soviet Union,'' he added.
   Redman said that if and when the new lines of credit are drawn
on during the next several years, ``we would expect that whatever
lending actually transpires will be consistent'' with the allied
consensus against subsidizing loans to the Soviet Union.
   A New York Times account in Friday's editions said commercial
banks in West Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Japan have
signaled their intention to lend more than $9 billion to Moscow's
Bank for Foreign Economic Affairs.
   It said total new lending to the Soviet Union during the
three-year period from 1985-87 was $8 billion.
   But Redman pointed out that the recent transactions involve
``multiyear lines of credit, not actual loans.''
   ``It's by no means clear at this point that such lines of credit
would lead to a real increase in Soviet borrowing over the next few
years though, it is possible they might,'' he said.
   Redman said the allied consensus on the issue was expressed most
recently at the May economic summit.
   It was agreed that East-West economic relations can be expanded
``so long as the commercial basis is sound, they are conducted
within the basic principles and rules of the international trade
and payments system and are consistent with security interests of
each of our countries.''
   Redman said the allies have agreed specifically to lend only at
market rates to the Soviet Union.
   The Times account said the lines of credit to the Kremlin have
caused deep divisions within the administration and the Congress,
with the Pentagon countering State Department's arguments by
contending that Western loans enable the Soviets to maintain global
commitments.

   It might be just another Loch Ness
``Nessie'' or Lake Tahoe ``Tessie'' _ water beasts that catch the
imagination but somehow are never trapped themselves.
   But at least a couple of people near Wadsworth have reported
seeing an alligator in the Truckee River, and state game wardens
are taking the claim seriously enough to set baited traps for the
reptile.
   So far, however, the 'gator, described as 3-4 feet long and 3 or
4 years old, has given authorities the slip.
   Jim Curran, the state's regional fisheries supervisor, said the
reported alligator is too small to pose a threat and might not
survive the near-freezing winter waters anyway. The reptiles
normally live in tropical rivers and marshes.
   ``We figure this one must have been someone's pet,'' Curran
said. ``When it got too big, they dumped it in the river.''
   The first reported sighting came Oct. 14 when Jack Maughan said
he spotted the snub-nosed reptile in the river while taking his
daily walk along the bank. And Maughan's son, Bryan, says he saw
the animal Sunday.
   The story of the Wadsworth 'gator sightings isn't being ignored
by the town, located about 10 miles east of the Reno-Sparks area.
   Tom Peterson, the local fire chief and owner of the Wadsworth
Inn, has made T-shirts boasting the town is the state's 'gator
capital. And this weekend the fire department volunteers are
hosting an Indian taco feed featuring ``super-hot 'gator sauce.''
   Meanwhile, the story continues to grow.
   ``Yeah, it's 3 to 4 long, but at 11 o'clock, after a few beers,
that 'gator gets to be a 16-footer,'' claims Peterson.

   Veteran liars here saw a familiar fib
when they read a story this week about a liars club in Nebraska.
   A lie judged good enough to get the alleged author inducted into
a liars hall of fame in Nebraska in 1987 bears a striking
resemblance to a lie that won a Missouri man the title of World
Champion Liar in the Burlington Liar's Club 1979 contest.
   Robert Peterson Sr., of Dannebrog, Neb., claims one day in
February it was so cold that he saw a lawyer with his hands in his
own pockets.
   That tale got Peterson inducted into the National Liars Hall of
Fame in Dannebrog.
   But in 1979, C.A. Laurie of Eckland, Mo., was named World
Champion Liar by the Burlington Liar's Club for saying it was so
cold in Missouri one winter that he saw a politician standing on
the street corner with his hands in his own pockets.
   ``The lie we named a champion years ago was told with a
politician _ not a lawyer,'' said Don Reed, vice president and
20-year member of the Burlington Liar's Club.
   But Reed said he doesn't mind.
   ``I feel there should be nothing to stop anybody from telling a
tall tale,'' he said. ``We're dedicated to the perpetuation of the
American heritage of telling tall tales.''
   ``But we'll always be the granddaddy of them all,'' he added.
   The Burlington Liar's Club was founded in 1929 and chooses its
winner each New Year's Eve. Entries come from all over the country
and world. Last year, more than 200 lies were sent to the
Burlington club.
   At least, that's what they say.

   Republican Dan Quayle on Friday said
the Democrats will not stage a Harry Truman-style comeback this
year, copying a line used against him to devastating effect in the
vice presidential debate.
   ``I don't know Michael Dukakis, I never served with Michael
Dukakis, Michael Dukakis is not a good friend of mine,'' the GOP
vice presidential nominee said. ``But I know this: Michael Dukakis
is no Harry Truman.''
   Democratic vice presidential candidate Lloyd Bentsen had used a
similar cadence to declare Quayle ``no Jack Kennedy'' in the prime
sound bite of the vice presidential debate.
   Aides said it was the first time Quayle had made reference to
the put-down during a campaign speech.
   Quayle opened his campaign day at a noisy college rally where
backers and critics shouted for attention, interrupting his speech
at least four times with chants.
   ``They've always been negative and they always will be,'' Quayle
declared. ``They are the party of failure. We are the party of
success.''
   At one point when chanters interrupted his speech, Quayle paused
and asked ``Is that Sam Donaldson in the room?'' Donaldson is an
ABC News correspondent with a reputation for shouting questions.
   ``They can go ahead and yell,'' Quayle said. ``We're going to
talk about issues and ideas.''
   Quayle's stump speeches are routinely greeted by protesters, but
Friday's event was the first of the week where more than a handful
were on hand.
   Quayle launched his campaign day in a steady drizzle in eastern
Tennessee, donning a white laboratory coat to tour a hospital
research facility and then speak to thousands of cheering college
students at East Tennesee State University.
   He scheduled campaign stops in Tennessee and Georgia to hammer
Dukakis as being weak on defense issues, a strong selling point in
the generally conservative South.
   Also on Friday, Quayle was asked about Massachusetts Sen. Edward
Kennedy's comments that Quayle had been unfairly portrayed by the
media.
   Quayle said he has ``strong ideological differences'' with
Kennedy, but ``You'd be surprised at how many things we agree on.''

<HEAD>Appeals Court Upholds Use of DNA `Fingerprints' As Trial Evidence</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``Genetic fingerprints'' can be used
as evidence in Florida criminal trials, a state appeals court has
ruled in a rape case that prosecutors said was the nation's first
successful use of DNA tests.
   In a 15-page decision issued Thursday, the Florida 5th District
Court of Appeal found that DNA tests were properly admitted in the
rape trial of a man convicted in November 1987 and sentenced to 22
years.
   DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, is the substance that makes up
chromosomes and carries the genetic code that determine an
individual's personal characteristics, such as eye color, hair
texture and blood type.
   Assistant State Attorney Tim Berry noted during courtoom
arguments over the tests that they have proven effective for 10
years in paternity cases.
   The issue of DNA tests as evidence was a central element in the
case against Tommie Lee Andrews of Orlando, who was charged with
raping and slashing a woman in her home on Feb. 21, 1987.
   The victim could not identify her attacker. But police found
Andrews' fingerprints on the frame of a broken window screen at the
scene. Also admitted as evidence were DNA tests comparing the
rapist's semen with Andrews' blood.
   Experts testified the tests showed a perfect match and said the
chance the semen sample would identically match another person's
DNA code was about one in 840 million.
   Assistant Public Defender Kenneth Witts of Daytona Beach
appealed, arguing that DNA identification testing was only 10 years
old and scientifically unreliable.
   But Assistant Attorney General Kellie Nielan of Daytona Beach
countered by saying that DNA identification testing was widely
accepted as reliable within the scientific community and has been
successfully used in criminal cases in the United Kingdom.
   ``I know several states are putting together legislation in this
area,'' she said. ``It is nationally being recognized as a fairly
useful tool for law enforcement purposes.''
   The appeals court agreed.
   ``The trial court did not abuse its discretion in ruling the
test results admissible in this case,'' the opinion said. ``In
contrast to evidence derived from hypnosis, truth serum and
polygraph, evidence derived from DNA print identification appears
based on proven scientific principles.
   ``Indeed, there was testimony that such evidence has been used
to exonerate those suspected of criminal activity.''
   Witts said he would probably ask the Daytona Beach court to send
the case on to the state Supreme Court, which the appeal court can
do if it finds the case to have a constitutional question.
   Andrews was convicted in a separate Orlando rape case this past
February, and DNA tests were again used against him.

   Alexander A. Bessmertnykh, the deputy foreign

promoted to first deputy, the official news agency Tass reported
Friday.
   Bessmertnykh, 54, will be one of Foreign Minister Eduard

   He replaces Yuli Vorontsov, who was named ambassador to
Afghanistan in a surprise move last week. Such an assignment was
very unusual for a top diplomat, but the Soviet Union is in the
process of withdrawing 100,000 troops from Afghanistan and recently
pledged nearly $800 million in aid.
   Bessmertnykh previously had been an aide to Anatoly Dobrynin
when he was ambassador to Washington, and also served as an aide to
Shevardnadze's predecessor, Andrei A. Gromyko.

<TEXT>
   Embittered anti-Sandinista Nicaraguan exiles are
unlikely to participate in a relief drive aimed at helping their
homeland after the expected onslaught of Hurricane Joan, community
leaders said.
   While Nicaragua and other Central American nations braced for
the storm Friday by evacuating their Caribbean coastlines, Miami
exiles evaluated its potential impact by who gets hurt _
Sandinistas, Contra rebels or refugees.
   ``I haven't heard of any relief plans and don't think there will
be any organized here in Miami,'' said Roberto Arguello, founder
and director of the Nicaraguan American Bankers Association.
   He said most of those who live in the area expected to be
hardest hit have already been relocated. What remains are
Sandinista military operations posts on the Atlantic coast.
   ``We are certainly not going to help them,'' Arguello said.
``Let the Russians bail them out.''
   However, if Nicaraguan refugees in Honduras were affected or if
Managua's Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo asked for help, a relief
drive might be organized, he said. In the latter case, leaders said
they would want guarantees that the aid would not wind up helping
the Sandinistas.
   ``In the past, there have been misused resources in Nicaragua,''
said Contra spokesman Jorge Rosales. ``The most efficient way to
distribute help would probably be through the church. We are all
Nicaraguans, but unfortunately the Red Cross is under the control
of the Sandinista government,'' Rosales said.
   ``Let's just pray Joan doesn't hit,'' he added. ``There's too
much suffering in Nicaragua already.''
   Rosales said those likely to suffer the most are refugees and
the poor.
   ``The Sandinista commandantes are living very nicely in their
houses around Managua,'' he said.
   Speaking for the Nicaraguan Brotherhood, a leading volunteer
group for needy Nicaraguan exiles, Martha Cardenal said the group
had its hands full helping refugees in Miami.
   ``We're an apolitical group. We don't care if someone is a
former Sandinista or Contra. We just try to help them survive,''
she said.
   In Washington, Sarli Porta, spokeswoman for the Nicaraguan
Embassy, said the nation has not yet requested aid, but is
interested in whatever help is offered.
   ``This is a national emergency, a case of humanitarian needs of
all types,'' she said. ``We expect everyone to be involved in
relief activities. In this case, we're all Nicaraguans, and that's
the basis we're going to work on.''

<HEAD>Dukakis Campaigns in Harlem, Unveils Tough Ads Accusing Bush of
Lies</HEAD>

   Democrat Michael Dukakis campaigned among black
voters in Harlem Friday, accusing George Bush of being more
interested in posing for crime-fighter photos ``than in real
opportunities to get drugs off our streets.''
   Dukakis, in the first visit by a presidential nominee this fall
to the nation's most famous black community, also pointed to the
Supreme Court appointments the next president will likely make and
said, ``I don't have to tell you just how high the stakes are in
this election.''
   ``He's on their side. I'm on yours. And that's why I'm here
today,'' Dukakis said in a speech at a Harlem church.
   Meanwhile, the Dukakis campaign unveiled his toughest TV ads of
the campaign, with one showing the candidate himself turning off an
anti-Dukakis commercial and saying the Bush ad was ``full of lies
and he knows it.''
   Dukakis says in his own ad that the Bush commercial _ which
ridicules Dukakis' tank ride earlier in the campaign _ ``isn't
about defense issues; it's about dragging the truth into the
gutter. And I'm not going to let them do it.''
   The Democrat also says of Bush, ``I'm on the record for the very
weapons systems his ads say I'm against.''
   Bush is accused of ``false advertising'' in another new Dukakis
ad, which says, ``George Bush talks a lot about prison furloughs,
but he won't tell you that the Massachusetts program was started by
a Republican and stopped by Mike Dukakis.'' The ad also says the
``Bush administration'' has furloughed 7,015 drug dealers, one of
whom raped and murdered a pregnant mother of two.
   A third ad says cocaine traffic is up 300 percent and there are
``more drugs in our classrooms'' since President Reagan put Bush in
charge of a task force trying to stop the flow of drugs into the
country.
   In New York on Friday, the Democratic presidential nominee,
battling to come from behind just 18 days before the election,
cited his Republican rival's Thursday visit when Bush appeared with
city police grieving over the fatal shooting of two officers in
drug-related incidents.
   ``Our grief is above politics,'' Dukakis said. ``And our
determination to win this war (on drugs) should know no bounds.''
   He said the Reagan administration ``has fought and lost the
war'' on drugs.
   ``Yesterday George Bush was in New York claiming credit for his
leadership in the war against drugs,'' Dukakis said. ``What
leadership?''
   ``Mr. Bush is more interested in photo opportunities than in
real opportunities to get drugs off our streets,'' he said.
   ``In the last eight years, cocaine imports have tripled;
drug-related deaths have doubled; our neighborhoods have been
destroyed and our apartment houses have become battlegrounds. Drugs
are poisoning our children and destorying their lives.''
   Dukakis said drug use in the schools has been cut ``twice as
fast'' in Massachusetts, where he is governor, as in the rest of
the country.
   ``I'm pround of my record fighting drugs,'' he said. ``We've put
five times as many drug dealers behind bars.''
   Dukakis spoke at the Bethel African Methodist Episcopal Church,
which was filled only after the campaign brought in children from
the nearby schools.
   Dukakis clapped as a robed, female choir behind him sang and
swayed rhythmically. He was joined in the appearance by actor Danny
Glover.
   From New York, Dukakis was flying to McKeesport, Pa., for a
rally with former Pittsburgh Steeler football star Franco Harris.
He was flying on to New Orleans and later Beaumont, Texas, before
ending his campaign day.
   Dukakis began a battle for television exposure by making the
rounds of television networks and New York City television stations
for interviews earlier Friday.
   He complained on CBS that the campaign has been ``altogether too
negative'' and that he has been ``subject to attacks and
distortions.''
   ``I hope we can get beyond this now,'' he said on ABC. ``I think
the American people are not happy with this campaign generally.''
   Also on ABC, he said ``we're behind by a little bit.'' And in an
admission of how much he still needs to do, said he was using the
interviews to give people ``a better sense of who I am.''

   University of Massachusetts officials
launched a weeklong series of seminars, lectures and dances Friday
to promote civility and racial harmony at the school on the second
anniversary of a fight between black and white students.
   ``The idea is simply to get people to think about racism,'' said
Simone Nicholson, a black student who helped organize the event.
``There's still an uptight feeling around. It's just very quiet.
Nothing's gone away. It's just on hold.''
   At nearby Smith College, officials announced the hiring of the
school's first affirmative action officer after a 16-month search.
   E. Shelton Burden, who holds degrees in law and chemistry and is
currently director of affirmative action programs at Auburn
University in Alabama, said she plans to start work at the
2,722-student women's college in January. Her hiring came two weeks
after Smith administrators said notes containing racial slurs were
slipped under a student's door and more than a year after students
demonstrated and several black professors left the college after
complaining that the administration was dragging its heels on
affirmative action.
   At the University of Massachusetts, Chancellor Joseph Duffey and
the man he hired to investigate the problems blamed underlying
racial tensions for fights in 1986. Black Mets fans and white
Boston Red Sox rooters fought when hundreds of students poured out
of dormitories following the Mets victory in baseball's 1986 World
Series. A total of 10 students were treated for injuries at the
campus infirmary, although no one was hospitalized.
   The activities opened Friday with anti-racism workshops for
teaching assistants, a panel discussion on how to file harassment
complaints and a dance ``Rock Against Racism,'' sponsored by the
campus chapter of the Young Communist League.
   Among those scheduled to speak next Thursday, the anniversary of
the fracas, is Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young.
   Only about 2.5 percent of the 26,505 students at the state's
largest public university are black, including 329 out of 19,778
undergraduates and 210 out of 6,726 graduate students. In contrast,
the largest public universities in the Deep South have black
enrollments ranging from 4 percent at Auburn University in Alabama
to 11 percent at Mississippi State.
   And tensions have remained at the University of Massachusetts
despite two years of study groups and faculty reports.
   Earlier this week, the campus Distinguished Visitors Program
board narrowly approved a fraternity's request to sponsor a campus
speech by Louis Farrakhan next semester over heated protests by
Jewish student groups who called the black Muslim leader a ``rabid
anti-Semite.''
   And J. Roger Cherewatti, director of the physical plant,
launched an investigation into reports of racial slurs made over
walkie-talkies two weeks ago on a frequency reserved for department
foremen and supervisors.

   Emperor Hirohito received a blood transfusion
Friday after one earlier in the day caused him to break out in a
rash, palace officials said.
   Kenji Maeda, a spokesman for the Imperial Household Agency, said
the emperor received about a half-pint of blood.
   He said incompatible elements in the blood of the earlier
transfusion caused the 87-year-old emperor to develop the rash,
which disappeared after the transfusion was stopped.
   Since the emperor's internal bleeding began Sept. 19, doctors
have given him almost daily blood tranfusions, adding up to more
than 23 pints in the past month.
   Maeda said the repeated transfusions have been putting a strain
on the emperor's kidneys.
   News reports have said the emperor has cancer, but palace
officials have refused to confirm or deny the reports.
   An agency source who spoke on condition of anonymity said
Hirohito seemed to be in good spirits and conversed with several
family members who visited him during the day.
   He said the emperor often watches an afternoon drama series on
television, but added that palace officials have kept Hirohito from
watching television news or reading newspapers for fear the reports
on his health could be disheartening.

<TEXT>
   Residents displaced by a vast underground
coal mine fire are faced with a new fire of undetermined depth and
size burning in a coal seam in a surface mine.
   State and federal officials involved in the Centralia mine fire
project, which involved buying out and resettling more than 400
families, believe the newest outbreak recently ignited in a pile of
illegally dumped debris.
   The fire just north of Centralia is on land owned by Pagnotti
Coal Co. of Luzerne County, which planned to move excavating
equipment in to dig out the burning coal, officials said.
   ``We believe we'll be getting in there early enough to get it
all out, although we don't know how deep it is,'' said Jack Beadle,
a Pagnotti engineer.
   The new fire, detected Monday by a police officer, is about a
mile north of the more extensive underground fire that has been
burning in old mine tunnels and coal seams since 1962. It is only a
few hundred yards below a development where five Centralia families
built new homes to get away from the larger mine fire.
   Local fire crews were called twice this week to douse burning
refuse in the pit. But coal just below the surface continues to
burn, producing two plumes of smoke by day and visible at night as
dull, bluish flames.
   ``Right now, we just don't know what we have. Something ignited
there and coal has ignited. It presents a bad situation,'' said
state geologist Gary Greenfield.
   He said that if the fire is found to be more extensive than
Pagnotti alone is able to control, state officials will discuss
alternatives with federal mining officials.
   One of the nearby homeowners is Centralia Police Chief Tom
McGinley, who said Thursday he would worry only if nothing is done
soon to put the new fire out.
   ``It's definitely caught the coal burning in the bank. I'd be
concerned if they don't do something about it,'' McGinley said,
estimating the closest home to be about 250 yards away from the
burning pit.
   Centralia Mayor Anne Marie Devine said ``the voice of
experience'' should alert officials to act quickly in light of what
has happened in her town.
   ``It's very important that something be done before it gets out
of hand. What's so ironic about it is these people who moved up
there are now closer to an underground fire than they were when
they lived in Centralia,'' she said.
   Officials said it is important to deal with such a coal fire in
its early stages before it can expand and burn uncontrollably down
into the numerous coal veins and abandoned mines criss-crossing
these anthracite coal fields.
   ``With this type of fire you need to get at it pretty quick
because it easily gets out of control,'' said David Hamilton, a
program specialist with the U.S. Office of Surface Mining.

on Friday aimed at focusing the government's long-range aviation
research, boosting the commercial satellite industry and bringing
order to federal superconductivity efforts.
   On a voice vote, the House passed a measure directing the
Federal Aviation Administration to step up its research on aircraft
safety, including fire prevention and the problems faced by aging
planes.
   The bill requires the FAA to increase its research on post-crash
fire prevention, and directs the agency to consider writing a rule
that would require airlines to make aircraft fuel tanks that are
less prone to fire.
   The structural soundness of aging aircraft would be another
category of required research. The provision was inspired by the
April 28 accident in which the roof of an Aloha Airlines Boeing 737
peeled off in flight, sweeping a flight attendant to her death and
injuring 61 of 94 people on board before the plane landed safely.
   The bill would also require added research on the role human
performance plays in aircraft safety. Among the items the FAA would
have to examine would be the standards the agency uses to determine
how many air traffic controllers it believes are needed.
   Overall, the bill directs the FAA to reserve 15 percent of its
research budget, or about $21 million, for long-term research. The
Senate passed the measure on Thursday.
   On a 355-1 vote, the House approved legislation aimed at helping
private satellite launchers, who have been battered ever since the
Challenger space shuttle disaster of January 1986.
   The bill requires commercial launchers of satellites to obtain
insurance to cover potential losses by private companies and
individuals up to $500 million. The government's liability would be
limited to $1.5 billion beyond the insured level.
   Launchers would also have to obtain up to $100 million in
insurance to cover possible damage to government property.
   To help U.S. companies that had agreements with NASA to launch
satellites when the Challenger explosion occurred, the measure
would exempt those firms from having to obtain insurance against
damage to federal property.
   The sole vote against the measure was cast by Rep. Henry
Gonzalez, D-Texas, who said he was uncomfortable with what he said
would amount to government subsidies to private companies in the
bill.
   In August 1986, Reagan ordered NASA to halt launches of
commercial and foreign satellites. At that time, 44 companies had
agreements with NASA to launch satellites on the shuttle, and half
of them had space vehicles already under construction.
   The measure also bars the government from pre-empting private
launches, as it did after the Challenger catastrophe, except for
cases of ``imperative national need.'' The bill would prevent the
imposition of extra federal charges on companies if their launch is
pre-empted by the government. It would also require NASA to report
to Congress within a week on the reasons for the pre-emption and
providing a new launch schedule.
   The legislation passed the Senate on a voice vote on Oct. 14.
   On a 353-0 tally, the House also approved a measure ordering the
White House to draft a five-year plan for federal research on
superconductivity.
   Recent years have seen a dramatic growth in federal and private
efforts in the field, with scientists beginning to produce
materials allowing the transmission of electricity at levels of
efficiency that are now unattainable. Such advances could
revolutionize energy storage, electronics, transportation and other
industries.
   Critics, however, have said the government's work has been
unfocused. The bill would give the White House nine months to write
its research plan.
   The Senate passed the bill Oct. 5.

   A campaign to designate English as Arizona's
official language should be debated on its merits, not on the
political views of its supporters, the new head of a national
pro-English group says.
   Opponents of Arizona's Proposition 106 should ``climb out of the
gutter of their Big Lie techniques and character assassination and
debate the real issues,'' U.S. English chairman Stanley Diamond
said at a news conference Thursday. ``Our opponents know that they
cannot defeat us on the merits. So they are attempting to cloud the
issue by smearing our organization and motives.''
   Diamond, architect of a pro-English campaign in California two
years ago, took over Monday as chairman of U.S. English from
founding chairman John Tanton.
   Tanton resigned after former White House aide and U.S. Senate
candidate Linda Chavez announced she was quitting as president of
the group because of questions about some Tanton associates and
because of controversial racial and religious references in a memo
Tanton had written two years ago.
   ``We will not permit Dr. Tanton to become the issue,'' said
Diamond, a San Francisco businessman.
   The Arizona measure, similar to proposals on the ballot in
Florida and Colorado, would designate English as the state's
official language and require state and local governments to
transact business in English. Exceptions would be allowed in cases
where public health or safety was threatened and where federal laws
applied such as bilingual ballots and bilingual education for
children.
   Supporters of the measure say it would unify the state and
encourage minorities to join the mainstream faster. Opponents say
it would be divisive and could hurt efforts to attract foreign
business and tourism as well as harming ethnic minorities.
   Diamond challenged opponents of the Arizona measure to debate it
on statewide commercial television and offered to put up half the
money if time is not donated by the stations.
   The two sides are already slated to face off on public
television, and a spokesman for the measure's opponents said after
Diamond's news conference that his group would gladly engage in
other debates but could not afford to buy broadcast time.
   The Arizona opponents have raised $80,000 to $100,000 to date,
mostly from banks, utilities and other corporations.
   Proposition 106 supporters have raised $160,000, 97 percent of
it through a Tanton corporation that raised money by direct mail
and passed it on to U.S. English.
   U.S. English and its local supporters have refused to identify
their contributors but did say Thursday that U.S. English had about
7,500 Arizona members who contributed $315,000.
   Tanton's memo, written for a conference on immigration,
mentioned what he said was a potential for conflict if poorly
educated Hispanic and Asian Catholics enter the United States and
have more children than affluent, English-speaking citizens.
   Critics have also claimed that some of Tanton's associates in
other organizations have supported forced sterilizations and
eugenics research.
   ``I disown them,'' Diamond said of Tanton's ideas. ``I disavow
them, and he should have resigned.''
   Ms. Chavez served as a Reagan administration aide and was an
unsuccessful GOP candidate for the Senate in Maryland two years ago.

<HEAD>Bush Urges Sanctions Against Nations That Use Chemical Weapons</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOLEDO, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   George Bush, proposing to still ``the
invisible winds of death,'' on Friday advocated international
on-site inspections to enforce a ban on chemical weapons and urged
sanctions against nations that use them.
   Bush did not mention his tie-breaking votes in the Senate in
1983 and 1986 in favor of U.S. chemical weapon arsenals.
   Expanding on an earlier campaign pledge, Bush also said he would
seek to persuade the Soviet Union and China to join industrial
nations of the West in forging new restrictions on the sale of
missiles capable of carrying chemical weapons.
   ``The eventual combination of chemical weapons and ballistic
missiles could put new destructive power in the hands of
governments with terrorist records,'' Bush told an audience of
about 1,200 at the University of Toledo.
   Data released by the campaign said Israel and seven other
countries in the Middle East _ Egypt, Saudi Arabia, South Yemen,
Syria, Libya, Iran and Iraq _ do not have ballistic missiles.
   A campaign fact sheet singled out China, North Korea, Argentina
and Brazil as among the countries that ``continue to supply them.''
   Later, at an enthusiastic rally at a municipal ice skating arena
in Troy, Ohio, Bush told a capacity crowd of 6,000 that the state,
with its 23 electoral votes, was ``absolutely crucial'' to his
election. He vowed to run ``never letting up, right down to the
wire.'' Bush is scheduled to return to the state next Tuesday.
   Aides insisted the vice president's advocacy of a tough global
ban on chemical weapons does not conflict with his tie-breaking
Senate votes in 1983 and 1986 to continue U.S. production of such
weapons.
   After a second such vote in 1983, President Reagan called Bush's
mother to explain why the vote was necessary. ``George knows I
disapprove of it,'' Dorothy Bush said then.
   Bush said that barriers against the use of gas and other
chemical weapons, established after World War II but ``breached
during the Iran-Iraq war,'' must be ``repaired and raised even
higher.''
   ``I've seen a few things in my life but I thought we had
relegated the horrors of chemical warfare to the history books,''
Bush said.
   ``I thought we had banished forever what we saw only a few
months ago: a mother trying to protect her child, waving her arms
against the invisible winds of death.''
   It was a reference to news photographs last summer of a mother
and child in an Iran-occupied Kurdish village in Iraq.
   Bush said, if elected, he would back up his proposal to ban
chemical weapons with an international agreement to permit on-site
``inspections on demand'' of chemical plants.
   ``This will be an enormously difficult task. But the alternative
is much worse,'' Bush said.
   He also called for international sanctions against violators of
the ban. Aides said this might range from formal censure in an
international body like the United Nations to unspecified economic
or diplomatic sanctions.
   Outside the auditorium where Bush spoke at the University of
Toledo, about 200 protesters gathered, many of them union members
bearing pro-Dukakis signs and chanting ``Bush Go Home.''

   Excerpts from Islamic Jihad's statement
issued Friday as translated into English by The Associated Press:
   Once again, one of your grandchildren (the car bomber) burns the
earth under the feet of the usurpers, making them taste humiliation
and degradation.
   Once again the motto of ``Israel's security'' is in ridicule.
   Once again the slogan of Islamic unity is accomplished under the
banner of ``No God but God.''
   This is the era of Islam no matter how big the conspiracy grows.
It is the era of sacrifices, irrespective of the price of martyrdom.
   We bless and applaud the Islamic resistance for this suicide
operation. We pledge to God and his prophet to continue along the
same path until he brings us fast release and fills the earth with
justice.
   After the Israeli statements and the convening of the Israeli
Cabinet yesterday (Thursday) as well as America's advance approval
of a military retaliation against our people and nation, the
occupation forces attacked our Lebanese and Palestinian people in
the western Bekaa and Sidon today (Friday), challenging the will of
our oppressed people.
   Committing this stupidity and this attack shall not pass without
a punishment. The criminal America must realize it will not get
away with what it has done, especially in connection with the
hostages we hold, so that will be a lesson to whoever strikes at
the dignity and glory of our people and mujahedeen (holy fighters).
   We pledge to our Islamic nations and the oppressed in the world
that we shall remain the watching eye and the long arm to defend
their freedom, glory and dignity until victory or martyrdom.
   Islamic Jihad Organization,
   October 1988.

   President Reagan ``is saddened'' by
the indictment of former Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos and
his wife Imelda on racketeering charges, but he allowed the Justice
Department to proceed because ``no foreign policy considerations''
stood in the way, his spokesman said Friday.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, speaking with reporters
during Reagan's visit to Western Kentucky University, said the
president realizes ``now it's time for the justice system to take
its course.''
   Reagan ``is saddened that it happened, because he (Marcos) is an
old friend and a friend of the country,'' Fitzwater said.
   The spokesman also stressed, however, that Marcos has been
indicted over matters that allegedly took place since he arrived in
the United States in 1986.
   ``These are crimes that allegedly occurred since he (Marcos) got
here _ if he'd behaved himself ... he wouldn't be in this
position,'' Fitzwater said.
   Reagan had hinted Thursday that he would not interfere in the
Justice Department action, when he told reporters ``it would have
to be a matter of foreign policy to bring to my desk, and not just
something legal.''
   According to the indictment, Marcos transferred $103 million
into the United States to buy Manhattan real estate and also
defrauded banking institutions of more than $165 million in the
purchase and financing of those properties.
   The indictment charged that between 1972 and 1986, when Marcos
and his wife went into exile in Hawaii, they accumulated millions
of dollars through embezzlement, theft, bribes and kickbacks.
   Fitzwater said the State Department and the National Security
Council ``had advised the president that there were no foreign
policy considerations that would stand in the way of the Justice
Department action.''
   Fitzwater said he did not know the details of why those agencies
reached that decision.
   The president was aware that Marcos had been offered a plea
bargain, and that if Marcos had accepted the government's offer,
``there wouldn't have been an indictment,'' Fitzwater said.
   He said the White House ``went along'' with the plea bargain
approach, but he said it was ``strictly a Justice Department plan.''
   The spokesman added that after Marcos' attorneys notified the
Justice Department on Thursday night that he would not accept that
arrangement, ``on that basis Justice went ahead.''
   Asked how Reagan felt about the legal action against Marcos,
Fitzwater said, ``Obviously, the president knew it, had aided in
his departure from the Philippines and feels saddened by the need
for this.''
   ``But it's clear that the Justice Department has a very strong
case and it will proceed through the system,'' Fitzwater said.
   The spokesman said he could not comment on whether there had
been any contact between Reagan and Marcos because of the legal
nature of the matter.
   Asked if any other foreign leader might follow Marcos' example
and take refuge in the United States if he comes under pressure in
his own country, Fitzwater said, ``We didn't make any offers we
couldn't keep.''
   ``Any foreign leader can take our word on anything,'' he said.

<HEAD>Pinochet Shakes Up Cabinet In Response To Loss At Polls</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KEVIN NOBLET</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Augusto Pinochet replaced eight
members of his 16-man Cabinet Friday in a shake-up prompted by the
voters' rejection of a proposed new term.
   The presidential press office announced that Pinochet, the
72-year-old army commander, would swear in eight new ministers
Friday night, but did not identify them or rule out that Cabinet
members could be shifted into new positions.
   The press office also said Sergio Fernandez would remain as
interior minister, the most politically powerful post, despite
opposition calls for his ouster.
   Opposition political leaders were calling for his replacement
with someone more willing to accept their calls for democratic
reforms before Pinochet's term ends in March 1990.
   Pinochet and Fernandez have rejected any reforms to the
country's 1980 constitution, which the opposition maintains must be
amended to ensure democracy in the future.
   All 16 government ministers stepped down Thursday to allow
Pinochet to adjust policy after his Oct. 5 defeat in a referendum
on extending his rule to 1997.
   The new Cabinet is Pinochet's 40th since he seized power in a
bloody 1973 coup that toppled the elected leftist government of
President Salvador Allende and ended a long tradition of democratic
rule.
   According to the announcement, other Cabinet members confirmed
in their posts included retired navy Adm. Patricio Carvajal of
defense, Hernan Buchi of finance and army Gen. Manuel Concha of
economy.
   It said Pinochet also planned to swear in a new
secretary-general of the presidency, a Cabinet-level post, to
replace army Gen. Sergio Valenzuela.
   The replaced Cabinet members included Foreign Minister Ricardo
Garcia and Orlando Poblete, the government secretary-general,
according to the announcement.
   Fernandez and Poblete oversaw Pinochet's campaign for the Oct. 5
referendum. It was rejected by a margin of more than 800,000 votes,
or 55 percent to 43 percent with the remaining two percent blank or
annuled.
   An open election is planned for December 1989 to pick a
successor.
   While most legal experts say Pinochet cannot legally succeed
himself, he has not ruled out being a candidate.
   Pinochet was said to be furious with some Cabinet members,
including Fernandez and Poblete, accusing them of ``tricking'' him
into believing he would win the referendum.
   Poblete allegedly altered the results of a government-contracted
polls two days before the ballot to give the impression Pinochet
was leading.
   After the vote, Fernandez argued in a nationally broadcast
address that the results were actually positive for Pinochet, that
the 43 percent tally in his favor showed he was Chile's principal
political leader.
   But most right-wing political leaders who backed Pinochet's
campaign quickly began distancing themselves from him.
   Several declared that he had been given his chance and that it
was now the time for civilian politicians to pursue the presidency.

<HEAD>Panel Recommends Changes In AIDS Testing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Medical screening tests for the AIDS virus are
more accurate than two years ago, but a panel of experts said
Friday that confirmation of the disease requires at least two
positive tests before a patient is informed.
   ``The current tests are very, very good, but they are not 100
percent,'' said Thomas A. O'Brien, a Du Pont Co. expert on AIDS
testing. He said there still are medical people using only a single
test to determine if patients are infected with AIDS.
   In a report issued Friday after three days of discussion at the
National Bureau of Standards, O'Brien and other experts recommended
that AIDS testing should not be considered completed until both
screening and confirmatory tests are completed.
   He said the testing sequence should start with a screening test
called ELISA (for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay). For those
with a positive ELISA test, he added, there should then be a
confirmation test called a Western Blot.
   Both laboratory tests are based on the presence in the patient's
bloodstream of antibodies to the human immunodeficiency virus, or
HIV, which causes AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
   ``If you test 10,000 people for HIV, the current tests would
give an ELISA positive on .2 percent (or 20),'' said O'Brien. ``Out
of the 10,000, the Western Blot (confirming test) would be needed
only on those 20 samples.''
   O'Brien said that only about 10 percent of people testing
positive by the ELISA test are actually infected with AIDS. As a
result, he said, ``you don't tell someone that they are HIV
positive on ELISA alone.''
   Some samples, O'Brien said, cannot be confirmed as positive or
negative even with both ELISA and Western Blot. He said the expert
panel recommended that this ``indeterminate'' group undergo
additional and different tests before a final report is made to the
patient.
   AIDS is a contagious disease that attacks the body's immune
system and makes it incapable of defending against infection. The
disease is not now curable, and no one has been known to recover
from it. As of Monday, there have been 75,768 AIDS cases reported
in the United States, and 42,653 have died.
   AIDS testing was one of four subjects addressed in a unique
gathering of medical testing experts at the National Bureau of
Standards. The gathering included testing specialists from
government agencies, industry and hospitals. Officials said the
purpose of the three-day meeting was to draw up recommendations for
assuring that the nation's laboratories are providing accurate
testing.
   The group issued recommended ways to improve testing for AIDS,
for drug abuse, for cholesterol, and for the Pap smear cancer
screening test.
   Among the recommendations were:
   _Though testing for cholesterol was generally found to be
accurate in hospital laboratories, the group recommended that
cholesterol measurements made in a physician's office laboratory
should ``be studied,'' since these labs often are not part of a
routine quality control program.
   _A common system of measuring the presence and concentration of
drugs in urine tests should be established nationally. The experts
said that there now exists a common reference material (a sample
containing pure drugs at known concentrations) for marijuana, but
not for other controlled drugs such as cocaine, PCP or
amphetamines. The report said that such a common reference material
would increase the accuracy of drug testing.
   _The panel also said that the analysis of urine specimens can
identify an exposure to drugs, but it does not measure the level of
impairment. The experts recommended that research be conducted to
determine how such impairment can be accurately measured.
   _The experts said that false-negative findings in Pap smears, a
test for the presence of cervical cancer, are running as high as 4
to 8 percent, but that these errors often are a result of poor
technique in collecting specimen. The panel recommended that the
Pap specimen collection technique be standardized and that women
patients receive better instructions in how to prepare for this
test.
   Dr. Beverly B. Kraemer, a laboratory director at St. John's
Mercy Medical Center in St. Louis, Mo., said though there are
inaccuracies in Pap smear tests, the procedure is still ``a woman's
best friend'' in the war against cancer and ``one of the most
successful lifesaving laboratory procedures'' now commonly used.

   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir on Friday accused
Jordan's King Hussein of meddling in Israel's election campaign by
backing the peace plan of Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, Shamir's
main political rival.
   ``The results of the Israeli elections will be determined by the
Israeli people, not by foreign interference,'' Shamir said. The
elections are Nov. 1.
   Hussein spoke Thursday night in an interview on ABC-TV's
``Nightline'' program. Foreign Ministry spokesman Alon Liel said
Friday the appearance was engineered by Peres to show his ``peace
plan still has a partner.''
   Peres' plan calls for convening an international Middle East
peace conference that would launch direct talks between the parties
to end the conflict over the Israeli-occupied territories seized
during the 1967 Middle East War. Palestinians would be represented
by a joint Jordanian-Palestinian delegation.
   The proposal, initially accepted by Hussein, suffered a setback
when the monarch announced July 31 he was severing ties with the
occupied West Bank, thus removing himself from the peace process.
   On ``Nightline,'' Peres reiterated his peace plan. Hussein,
asked to respond, called Peres' proposal ``interesting'' and ``a
step forward.''
   Jordan is ``prepared, if the Palestinians seek it and ask us
categorically, to go to an international conference in a joint
(Palestinian-Jordanian) delegation,'' Hussein said.
   The monarch also said a Shamir victory would be an ``absolute
disaster'' and escalate Middle East tensions.
   Shamir, head of the right-wing Likud bloc, refuses to trade
territory for peace and proposes negotiations for limited
Palestinian autonomy, a plan rejected by Hussein.
   More than 300 Palestinians have died in a 10-month uprising
against Israeli rule in the occupied lands, home to 1.5 million
Palestinians. Six Israelis also have died.
   The ``Nightline'' program ``was an important move to explain to
the Israeli public that the international peace conference and the
territory-for-peace formula are realistic ideas,'' Liel told
reporters after screening the program for them.
   Liel acknowledged the move could cause a backlash among voters
who might resent attempts by foreign leaders to manipulate them,
but Peres ``wanted to show that his program still has a partner.''
   Shamir indicated that the ploy would harm Peres' chances in the
elections. ``Those responsible for this attempt will bear full
public responsibility for their actions,'' Shamir said in a
statement.
   Likud and Peres' left-of-center Labor Party, are running
neck-and-neck, according to the latest polls.
   Israeli commentators noted that in the ``Nightline'' interview,
Hussein did not deviate from his position announced July 31 _ that
he would return to the peace process upon request by the
Palestinians.
   However, said Israel army radio commenator Horst Frankel:
``There is importance in the fact that 10 days before the election,
Hussein is willing to come out ... and help Shimon Peres in the
campaign, even if this puts him in an unpleasant situation in the
Arab world.''
   Also Friday, Israeli troops shot and wounded 13 Palestinians
during clashes in Nablus and the Gaza Strip refugee camps of Shati,
Nusseirat and Deir Al Balah, hospital officials said.
   The wounded included a 12-year-old shot in the left arm with a
plastic bullet and two 17-year-olds in serious condition with
plastic bullet wounds to the chest and neck, the officials said.

   About 800 refugees from southern Vietnam have
refused to move from a delapidated factory to a new camp because
they're uneasy about living with refugees from northern Vietnam, a
government spokesman said Friday.
   Refugees from the north and south have been living in the San
Yick factory building, which was described as unsuitable for human
habitation, said the spokesman.
   He said 456 refugees from northern Vietnam moved Thursday to the
new camp.
   The spokesman, who requested anonymity, said officials of the
U.N. High Commission were trying to persuade the southern
Vietnamese to move also.
   The spokesman said there have been no reports of any clashes
between the north and south Vietnamese at San Yick. The building
was turned into a refugee camp in August because of the heavy
influx of boat people from Vietnam.
   He said the southerners merely expressed their unease at moving
to a camp of ``mixed population.''
   The Hong Kong government has decided to close the 12-story San
Yick building, where conditions have been described by U.N.
officials as comparable to a prison.

Leader</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tens of thousands of Serbs rallied
Friday to protest the outcome of a Communist Party meeting, and
Yugoslavia's Parliament debated a series of economic and
constitutional reforms.
   The state news agency Tanjug said at least 75,000 Serbs attended
three rallies held to support Slobodan Milosevic, the Communist
Party leader of Yugoslavia's largest republic, after he suffered a
setback at a party meeting that ended Wednesday.
   Tanjug's estimates of crowds have regularly proved excessive in
recent weeks. Telephone calls to local police and journalists
failed to yield an independent crowd estimate.
   One of the rallies was in Milosevic's native area of Pozerevac
in central Serbia, but the Serbian leader did not attend.
   A reporter for a local radio station, reached by telephone from
Belgrade, estimated the crowd at 50,000 and said it assembled in
pouring rain.
   Two other rallies were held at Ruma, 25 miles north of Belgrade
and Velika Plana, the same distance east of Belgrade. Tanjug said
25,000 people attended the latter rally.
   All three rallies were organized by the communist-dominated
Socialist Alliance in support of Milosevic.
   The Serbian leader has vowed to contest a Central Committee vote
of no confidence in ally Dusan Ckrebic, a Serbian member of the
Communist party's ruling Politburo.
   The vote was seen as a criticism of Milosevic, who has backed
months of Serbian nationalist protests that have combined with
economic unrest and culminated in calls for new national and
regional leadership.
   Squabbles between the rival regional party factions have
jeopardized economic and constitutional reforms that were proposed
to stimulate foreign investment, joint ventures and a
market-oriented economy.
   Milosevic's campaign for greater Serbian control over its two
provinces of Kosovo and Vojvodina has centered on reforming
Yugoslavia's 1974 Constitution.
   Milosevic argues that Serbia needs more say to protect the Serb
and Montenegrin minority in Kosovo from alleged harassment by the
ethnic Albanian majority.
   Parliament's president, Dusan Popovski, has threatened to resign
if the constitutional reforms are not approved by the
Communist-dominated legislature. He told deputies Friday the
amendments are designed to ``enhance'' Serbia's position in its two
provinces.
   Another squabble surrounding the constitutional reform is the
refusal of the liberal northern republic of Slovenia to endorse a
proposal to rearrange financing for Yugoslavia's armed forces.
   The army now is financed from the federal budget, but has
complained that triple-digit inflation is forcing it to solicit
loans from state banks to stave off financial collapse.
   Slovenia contends the new constitutional arrangements would
enable the army to tap the resources of Yugoslavia's six republics
and two provinces.
   The dispute could block adoption of the entire constitutional
package since such a decision must be adopted by unanimous consent.
The package is due to be adopted by Nov. 29.

<TEXT>
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., said Friday if he were the
Democratic presidential candidate, his campaign would be on
stronger ground than that of Michael Dukakis because he would not
have let the Republicans use him for ``a punching bag.''
   Nunn said it may not be too late for the Massachusetts governor
to stage a rally but that ``Dukakis has really got to take off the
gloves; he's got to defend himself.''
   Nunn commented in an interview before addressing a governmental
affairs seminar sponsored by the Georgia Press Association.
   The state's senior senator considered a bid for the Democratic
nomination last year but ultimately ruled it out. He said he has no
regrets about the decision.
   ``If I had been pining away to be president of the United States
and that had been a lifetime ambition, I guess I would have been in
the race to begin with. But not having had that ambition and still
not having that ambition in any kind of keen way, it doesn't bother
me,'' he said.
   Asked if he believed his campaign would have been in better
shape now than many polls show the Dukakis campaign to be, Nunn
said:
   ``If I had gotten the nomination, I would think so. But it's
very hard to speculate and the campaign would have been so totally
different. (Republican nominee George) Bush might have been running
against me for being too conservative.''
   Nunn continued, ``I wouldn't have been a punching bag on some of
these issues. There are some very unfair allegations going on, and
what I've been amazed at is how the Bush campaign has been able to
get away with it and to be fairly successful at it so far. Dukakis
has really got to take off the gloves; he's got to defend himself.''
   Nunn is to appear with Dukakis in Georgia on Saturday at a rally
in Hawkinsville. The senator said he is also making campaign
appearances in Florida, Mississippi and Louisiana for the
Democratic presidential nominee.
   He said that despite the polls it is not too late for Dukakis to
turn the race around.
   ``Right now the polls certainly mean something ... but they're
not firm. I think there's an awful lot of give and take in them. It
could end up like it is now but I think that would be a
coincidence. It's not because people have made up their minds.''

   Cattle feedlot inventories in the nation's 13
leading beef states totaled 8.58 million head as of Oct. 1, down 5
percent from a year ago but 5 percent more than two years ago, the
Agriculture Department said Friday.
   Only California, Idaho, Kansas, Oklahoma and Washington showed
increases from a year ago, while decreases were reported in
Arizona, Colorado, Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, South
Dakota and Texas. for Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Iowa,
Kansas, Minnesota, Nebraska, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas and
Washington.
   Marketings of fed cattle for slaughter during July, August and
September totaled 6.15 million head, a 2 percent increase from the
same period of 1987 and 5 percent more than in 1986, the report
said.
   The placement of new cattle and calves on feed during the third
quarter of the year totaled 5.96 million head, down 10 percent from
last year and 6 percent fewer than two years ago.
   Cattle feeders indicated they expect to market 5.56 million head
during October, November and December, up 2 percent from last
year's fourth quarter and 5 percent more than in 1986, the report
said.
   State feedlot cattle inventories are listed here for the 13
states, which account for about 85 percent of the nation's beef.
The first number is the number of cattle, in thousands, as of Oct.
1, and the second number is the percentage of a year earlier.

   Twelve firemen, four civilians and a police officer were treated
at Kettering Hospital and released, police said.
   The accident occurred at a plant operated by Txane Ltd. on the
outskirts of Market Harborough, about 80 miles northwest of London,
police said.
   The vat contained a chemical called naphthalene di-isocyanate,
which is used as a bonding agent in the manufacture of tires, said
Inspector Peter Goode.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Exporters have sold China an additional
400,000 metric tons of U.S. wheat at subsidized prices for shipment
in December, the Agriculture Department said Friday.
   The sales, equal to nearly 14.7 million bushels, were handled by
six companies: Cargill Inc., 100,000 tons; Louis Dreyfus Corp.,
70,000; Nichimem America Inc., 40,000; Entrade International Ltd.,
40,000; Continental Grain Co., 110,000; and Bunge Corp., 40,000.
   Melvin E. Sims, general manager for the department's Foreign
Agricultural Service, said the sales were part of an authorized 2
million tons of wheat announced on Aug. 18 under the Export
Enhancement Program, or EEP.
   Although no selling prices or other details were announced,
recent prices of wheat at farm points have averaged around $3.86
per bushel, indicating a U.S. farm value of about $57 million.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushels
of wheat.
   Under current and previous EEP arrangements, China as of Oct. 13
had already bought 3.74 million tons of subsidized U.S. wheat for
delivery in the 1988-89 marketing year that began last June 1, plus
further sales this week.
   The program enables exporters to sell wheat and other designated
commodities to specified countries at reduced prices in order to
meet foreign competition. The exporters then collect free
government surpluses of grain or other products as bonuses, or
subsidies.
   Sims said the bonuses due the six exporters for the latest deal
averaged $22.84 per ton of wheat, or about 62 cents per bushel.
   China has an additional 960,000 tons of U.S. wheat available
under the EEP initiative announced on Aug. 18, he said.

<HEAD>NBC Says It Pulled Miniseries Ad Before GOP Phone Call</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NBC has pulled an ad for the miniseries
``Favorite Son'' showing a character questioning the qualifications
of a senator being considered as a vice presidential candidate.
   However, a network official said Friday that the decision to
pull the promotion, which began being aired shortly after the first
debate between the presidential candidates Sept. 25, was made
before Republican officials contacted the network. The ad was
yanked Thursday.
   ``NBC Entertainment President Brandon Tartikoff made the
decision several weeks ago that the whole political approach of the
promos should be toned down,'' said Michael O'Hara, vice president
for media relations, West Coast.
   ``The decision to remove that promo was made independent of any
calls to us to consider removing it,'' O'Hara said in a call from
New York. ``NBC internally made the decision that we would be
better off going in another direction.''
   O'Hara said a Republican campaign official had telephoned Robert
Hynes, an NBC vice president for government relations, to express
his concern about the promos. He did not know the name of the
official.
   The promo, taken from a scene in the show, has the president
ask, ``You think a man should be vice president because he looks
good on television?''
   It could be seen as a reference to Sen. Daniel Quayle, the
Republican vice presidential candidate, who has been criticized by
some as lacking credentials.
   ``It's a coincidence,'' said O'Hara. ``Steve Sohmer wrote this
book two years ago, before anybody ever heard of Sen. Quayle. It's
a real coincidence, much like the movie `China Syndrome' coming out
at the time of the Three Mile Island accident.''
   ``Favorite Son'' is a three-part, six-hour miniseries based on
the best-selling political thriller by Sohmer. It is set for
telecast a week before the election, Oct. 30-Nov. 1.
   A major theme of both the book and the miniseries is how
television affects the selection and the election of candidates and
how the medium is vulnerable to manipulation.
   Sohmer is a former vice president for promotion at NBC and CBS.
He was noted for being the whiz kid whose adroit use of promos
helped make NBC No. 1.
   In ``Favorite Son,'' a relatively unknown senator becomes a hero
during the assassination of a Contra leader on the steps of the
Capitol. The senator suffers a minor wound, but staggers to the
microphone to make an impassioned speech as television cameras roll.
   It is a week before the party's presidential convention. The
polls show the incumbent could lose and the suddenly famous senator
looks like the choice to give the ticket the boost it needs.
   Sohmer said in an interview last spring that he thought many
people would think of presidential hopeful Gary Hart because of
certain sexual aspects of the book. He said the book was written
long before Hart became a candidate or was forced to withdraw.

<HEAD>Bouygues In Eye Clinic Venture In Soviet Union</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A French construction company signed an agreement
Friday with other French and Soviet partners to build a luxury
medical-hotel complex in Moscow to perform eye surgery on 4,000
foreign patients a year.
   The project by the Bouygues company represents the first time
such an ambitious project has been set up jointly by Western and
Soviet interests.
   The overall cost of the project will exceed $73 million and
Bouygues' share of the contract to build and develop the center is
$67 million, said Martin Bouygues, managing director of the public
works and construction group.
   He added that studies for similar eye clinic projects using an
eye surgery technique developed by Sviatoslav Fiodorov are at an
advanced stage in Abu Dhabi, Malaysia and West Berlin. There have
also been preliminary discussions on modernizing an expanding a
Swiss eye clinic.
   The move is a diversification for French group, Bouygues
officials said, since the joint venture has exclusive rights
outside the Soviet Union for the ``production line'' technique
developed by Fiodorov.
   The joint venture's Soviet partners are MNTK and Vnesheconombank
holding 57 percent. Bouygues will put up 25 percent of the capital,
while Pullman International Hotels, a unit of France's
Internationale des Wagons Lits, will have a 5 percent stake and
will operate the five-star hotel complex.
   Four French banks will together control the remaining 13
percent. They include state-owned Banque Nationale de Paris and
Credit Lyonnais, Banque de l'Union Europeenne and Banque
Commerciale de l'Europe du Nord.
   Bouygues said the venture was made possible by the perestroika
policy adopted by the Soviet Union. He said its success would be
reinforced if the Soviet Union fulfills its pledge to make the
ruble a convertible currency in the coming years.
   Bouygues officials said the contract has been worded in such a
way as to enable the Western partners to repatriate hard-currency
profits.

   Eight years after a Vietnamese man
left his homeland in a crowded fishing boat, he is helping organize
a benefit concert for Vietnamese boat people living in a refugee
camp in Thailand.
   ``(If) we as Vietnamese people (do) not help, then no one will
help,'' said Khanh Nguyen, 31, a technician for Honeywell Inc.
   Nguyen and seven other Vietnamese put together the concert of
traditional and modern Vietnamese music and dance by performers
from California, Michigan and Canada. The concert is Saturday in
this Minneapolis suburb.
   ``I don't want to devote all my life looking for food and just
survive,'' said Nguyen. ``I want to help and contribute to
society.''
   ``We have everything, they have nothing,'' said Tu Nguyen,
another organizer, who is not related to Khanh Nguyen.
   The group hopes to raise $3,000 and give it to the American Red
Cross to help 4,000 refugees in the Thai border camp of Ban Thad.
   The State Department estimates that 300 to 400 Vietnamese have
landed on Thai shores in the past several months. To discourage
other refugees, the Thai government is not allowing the Ban Thad
residents to resettle in another country, according to the
department.
   Thai officials are urging Vietnamese seeking to emigrate from
their homeland to join overseas relatives under a
U.S.-government-sponsored resettlement plan, rather than coming to
Thailand.
   Tong Nguyen, the group's chairman, called treatment of the Ban
Thad refugees ``an injustice. We know the people who become
refugees are those ... who risk their lives to be free.''
   Tong Nguyen came to the United States a day before South Vietnam
fell to the Communists in 1975 and is now a refugee resettlement
worker for Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of St. Paul and
Minneapolis.
   Minnesota has about 8,000 Vietnamese, most of them in the Twin
Cities, many of them with individual success stories like Khanh
Nguyen and his wife.
   Three days after leaving Vietnam, they landed in Thailand.
Attacked by pirates, the refugees had been robbed of their money
and gold. Nguyen lost the rosary that his mother gave him.
   The couple spent several months in a refugee camp and then came
to the United States.
   This is the second time local Vietnamese have been involved in a
benefit concert for refugees. In 1986, they raised $5,000 to help a
West German rescue mission of Vietnamese boat people, Tong Nguyen
said.

<TEXT>
   Authorities have banned
unauthorized public gatherings in Prague following recent
demonstratrations that were broken up by police, it was reported
Friday.
   The Prague National Committee ruled that ``the right to organize
public gatherings in the historical center of Prague is limited to
the organs of the National Front and organizations associated with
it,'' according to the daily newspaper Svobodne Slovo.
   The National Front is a communist-dominated organization
comprising officially recognized political and social groups.
   ``In view of frequent disturbances in this area, the decree
includes a ban on unauthorized actions and gatherings,'' the
Communist Party newspaper Rude Pravo said in a report on the
National Committee meeting.
   The report referred to recent unofficial demonstrations on
Wenceslas Square that were broken up by police and resulted in
arrests.
   The largest such rally took place Aug. 21, the 20th anniversary
of the Soviet-led invasion of Czechoslovakia.
   Unauthorized events had been tentatively scheduled Oct.28 to
commemorate 70 years of Czechoslovak independence and Oct.29, when
a discussion club was to convene. Both events were to take place
downtown in Wenceslas Square.

   The limpet mine exploded in the public toilets of the KwaThema
Civic Center, which is being used as a municipal voting station in
the township 25 miles east of Johannesburg, police said.
   One-year-old Bolakele Khubeka was killed, while her mother
Abigail, 31, and 4-year-old sister, Primrose, were injured by
shrapnel. Two men also were injured, police said.
   There have been about 80 bombings in South Africa this year,
killing 18 people and injuring 250.
   The government has blamed most on the outlawed African National
Congress, which supports a boycott in nationwide municipal
elections Wednesday.
   The ANC and other anti-apartheid groups oppose participation in
the elections for segregated town councils, and the government has
outlawed statements promoting a boycott and banned all reporting on
or advertisements by people who believe the elections should be
boycotted.
   The government, seeking to maximize the turnout, has allowed
voters to cast votes in advance during a 12-day period ending
Saturday.
   This is only the second time blacks have been allowed to vote
for councilmen in urban areas.

<HEAD>Police Chief's Wife Among 82 Protesters Arrested At Honeywell</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 80 anti-war protesters, including
the police chief's wife, were arrested Friday outside Honeywell
Inc. on the 20th anniversary of the Honeywell Project, a peace
activist organization.
   Minneapolis Police Chief Tony Bouza didn't seem embarrassed by
his wife's arrest, which he thought was her sixth.
   ``I think one would be upset if she was selling drugs to
children ... but an act of conscience is not something that's going
to get me too upset,'' Bouza said about his wife, Erica.
   When she left the house Friday, Bouza said, ``My last words to
her were `Are you going to get arrested?' and she said `I don't
know.'''
   He said his wife had made a promise after the last time she was
jailed, in 1986, that she wouldn't be arrested again during the
rest of his term. He plans to retire at the end of this year.
   ``I think her conscience overwhelmed her,'' he said.
   Mrs. Bouza was booked on trespassing charges, said Sgt. Patrick
Conboy. Seventy-six others also were charged with trespassing and
five who threw blood on the defense contractor's property were
charged with damage to property, said Deputy Chief Douglas Smith.
Both charges are misdemeanors. All 82 protesters were released,
Smith said.
   Police said Mrs. Bouza was the second person who climbed a
ladder over a brick wall surrounding the Honeywell facility.
   Bouza, who has repeatedly expressed a hands-off approach to his
wife's anti-war activity, joked about it Friday.
   ``If she goes to jail, I'm not going to insist on conjugal
rights,'' he said.
   But he quickly turned serious: ``She's been to jail before
twice. Of course, she worries about it. It's a very painful
business. Nobody likes to go to jail.''
   The Honeywell Project was founded in 1968 to protest the
company's manufacture of components for cluster bombs used in
Southeast Asia.
   With Friday's 20th anniversary protest, ``I think there was a
carrying forth of the idea that we will continue what we are
doing,'' said a Honeywell Project staffer, Sue Ann Martinson.
   Friday's demonstration to protest Honeywell's role in the
manufacture of weapons parts began with a candlelight vigil near
company headquarters.
   Eventually a crowd estimated at 300 gathered outside Honeywell,
Conboy said.
   The protesters poured a blood-like substance on the ground to
symbolize what they said was the blood Honeywell has on its hands
for its role in weapons manufacturing, said Martinson.
   Company officials issued a statement defending its role in
weapons production, without making a specific reference to the
protesters.
   ``We believe that free people, working together, should
determine the appropriate programs and expenditures to establish
and sustain their national security,'' the statement said. ``This
process requires public debate, including the democratic right to
disagree. Throughout history, this right itself has always had to
be defended.''

<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The city is preparing its toughest action yet
against its legendary traffic snarls.
   Mayor Pietro Giubilo said Thursday night the city wants to allow
cars on the streets only on alternate days, depending on odd or
even license plates, during the Christmas shopping season.
   The plan, which must be approved by a special City Council
commission, would be in force from Dec. 1 to Dec. 23. It could be
extended, depending on its success.
   ``We are in an emergency that needs crash therapy,'' Giubilo
said.
   In recent years, the city has barred areas of downtown to most
private cars, established special lanes for buses, and asked
commuters to use public transportation.
   The measures appear to have had little effect. There are 1.6
million cars registered in the city of some 3 million people.
   Merchants say the alternate plate idea would discourage
shoppers. They want the city to build parking lots and new subway
lines.
   Opponents on the City Council said the plan won't really cut
traffic because there aren't enough police to enforce it and many
families have two cars.

   California gray whales like the three
trapped by Arctic ice off the northern coast of Alaska have one of
the longest migration routes of all mammals and are among the last
of their species.
   The trapped whales didn't leave in time on the annual migration
from the Arctic to the warm water off Baja California, 6,000 to
8,000 miles.
   California gray whales must leave the Arctic before winter
because they are not adapted for icy conditions and have relatively
thin blubber for insulation, said Mark Palmer, executive director
of the Whale Center in Oakland.
   He said the whales also cannot break through ice and cannot dive
underneath ice for any great distance.
   The whales can only spend an average of 3 to 6 minutes
underwater at a time during their migration, he said.
   There used to be three distinct populations of gray whales,
including the California group, another group in the north Atlantic
Ocean and one on the Asian coast, said Steve Bailey, a marine
biologist with the California Academy of Sciences in San Francisco.
   However, the group in the north Atlantic became extinct hundreds
of years ago and the Asian group is almost extinct, said Bailey.
The California gray whales number about 20,000.
   The California gray whale averages about 35 feet in length and
weighs about 30 tons, marine biologists said.
   The gray whales, which may actually be black or dark gray, feed
on small animals that live on the ocean floor.

   When Adnan Khashoggi was still a boarding school
student in Egypt, he introduced the fathers of two classmates. One,
an Egyptian, made towels and sheets; the other, a Libyan, was in
the market for those items.
   Khashoggi pocketed 200 pounds from the deal, along with the
discovery that ``it's only (by) putting people together (that) you
make money.''
   With that knowledge, he set out on an extraordinary
entrepreneurial life dedicated to the accumulation of spectacular
wealth and the cultivation of contacts everywhere in the world.
   He has been well rewarded, but in recent years he has been
dogged by controversy, by financial problems and, on Friday, by his
indictment on racketeering charges along with Ferdinand and Imelda
Marcos.
   Until recently, the Saudi businessman's life was marked only by
opulence. He hopped from continent to continent in his own DC-8. He
reportedly had luxury homes in 10 cities. His yacht was fitted with
gold fixtures. He spent $250,000 a day and exhibited no rich-man's
angst.
   The balding, rotund Khashoggi, 53, is the son of a physician to
the Saudi royal family. He was educated in economics at California
State University at Chico. He had intended to study petroleum
engineering at the Colorado School of Mines, but encountered a
blizzard and turned westward, to warmer climes.
   While in California, he arranged for the exporting of American
goods to Saudi Arabia. When he returned to his native country, he
continued to act as broker between the West and Saudi Arabia, using
his royal connections.
   Khashoggi's bread-and-butter was guns. He served as a major
conduit for military materiel bound for Saudi Arabia.
   His Triad Holding Corp. branched out _ into Kenyan real estate,
Asian hotels, Indonesian shipping, French fashions, Lebanese
furniture, cattle raising in Arizona and an import company in the
Philippines.
   In the mid 1970s, Khashoggi became embroiled in the scandal
surrounding bribes by U.S. companies to foreign governments. It was
alleged that part of Khashoggi's commissions were funneled to
foreign officials. In 1977 he flew to Barbados to avoid a
Securities and Exchange Commission subpoena.
   Two years later he voluntarily gave a deposition to the SEC, and
he was never charged in connection with the bribery scandal.
   Khashoggi's name made headlines again in 1986 when it was
revealed that he had brokered the U.S.-Iran arms deal that was at
the heart of the Iran-Contra scandal. Khashoggi said he lost $10
million on the deal, but that he never expected to make a profit _
if the result was peace between Iran and Iraq, he said, he would
make money by helping to rebuild those two countries.
   Khashoggi's wealth, meanwhile, seemed to vanish. Triad America
Corp., his American holding company, filed for protection under
bankruptcy statutes. Work stopped on a $400 million office-shopping
complex in Salt Lake City. A British company, Lonrho PLC of London,
sued because Khashoggi defaulted on two $4 million loans;
authorities temporarily seized two Khashoggi jets and his two-story
duplex apartment on Manhattan's Fifth Avenue.
   Finally, Khashoggi defaulted on a loan to the Sultan of Brunei,
who claimed the collateral _ his yacht, the Nabila. The Sultan then
sold the boat for $30 million to a tycoon of a different sort, New
York developer Donald Trump.

   Thousands of copies of a tongue-in-cheek
newspaper front page with the banner headline, ``Quayle Becomes
President. `Uh-oh Says Worried Nation,'' were sent to news
organizations and congressional offices this week.
   The Washington Possible, funded by San Francisco millionaire
Jeremy Sherman, focuses on made-up details and reaction to the
ascendency of Sen. Dan Quayle to the presidency after the
hypothetical death of Republican President George Bush.
   Sherman put out the fake front page because he wanted to make a
statement about Bush's selection of Quayle as his running mate,
said Josh Baran, a Los Angeles consultant hired by Sherman to
publish the piece.
   The stories recount a plunge in the stock market, appalled
unionists and environmentalists, and Americans kneeling in prayer
after Quayle's rise. Unionists, seniors and environmentalists are
beside themselves with dismay.
   The newspapers, blown up into posters, are going up in New York,
Washington and Los Angeles and will be plastered around seven more
cities next week, Baran said.

   Kuwaiti naval experts have detonated a
mine found floating in the northern Persian Gulf, the official news
agency KUNA said Friday. It was at least the fifth mine found in
the area in the last two months.
   The news agency, quoting a Defense Ministry source, said the
mine was discovered by a Kuwaiti naval patrol boat and was
detonated. It did not say when the incident occurred or what type
of mine it was.
   U.S. officials say there are perhaps as many as 200 mines still
in the Persian Gulf, most of them in the northern waters where both
Iran and Iraq placed the contact explosives to protect or block
access to local ports.
   The U.S. officials say the menace of floating mines is
increasing because of winter storms that will cause them to break
loose from their underwater moorings and drift southward with
prevailing currents.
   Gen. George B. Crist, senior commander of U.S. military forces
in the region, said in a recent interview that discussions on the
mine problem were under way at the United Nations and in
Washington. But he said it was not yet clear who would eventually
take on the task of mine-clearing in the gulf.

   Habib Bourguiba, who has lived under house
arrest near the capital since his ouster from the presidency last
year, will be granted his request to move to a villa near his
birthplace, sources said Friday.
   The former president-for-life will be transferred in the coming
days to a house near his birthplace of Monastir, about 110 miles
from the capital, the sources said, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   The 85-year-old former leader suffers from failing eyesight but
was said to be in otherwise good health. Friends say he has been
increasingly unhappy over the conditions of his confinement.
   Bourguiba has been allowed few visitors under the house arrest
imposed since his ouster in a bloodless coup Nov. 7. He has been
kept at a villa in Mornag, a few miles from Tunis.
   The man whose word was law in Tunisia for more than 30 years has
become virtually a non-person since President Zine el Abidine Ben
Ali, his former prime minister, declared him too senile to rule and
replaced him.
   For months, streets, avenues and institutions that carry his
name have gradually been renamed and statues of Bouguiba are being
dismantled or moved.
   Bourguiba had written several times to Ben Ali, asking to be
allowed to spend his last days in Monastir. The government had
turned a deaf ear to the request, possibly because of the support
he still enjoys locally.

<HEAD>St. Paul Bank To Get Up To $133 Million In Federal Aid</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Farm Credit Bank of St. Paul, Minn., will
get up to $133 million in federal aid, the Farm Credit System
Assistance Board announced Friday.
   Eric P. Thor, the board's chief executive officer, said the St.
Paul bank is the system's largest, with assets worth nearly $7.7
billion and 91,000 borrowers in Michigan, Minnesota, North Dakota
and Wisconsin.
   Under 1987 law, Farm Credit System institutions with impaired
capital _ the book value of borrower stock being less than par
value _ may apply to the board to be certified for federal aid.
   ``The St. Paul Farm Credit Bank has a new management team that
came on board in 1986,'' Thor said. ``They have designed a
financial recovery plan that the assistance board believes will
strengthen their level of capital and assist the district's
financially stressed PCAs.''
   That referred to Production Credit Associations, the grassroots
units that make loans to farmers so they can meet production
schedules.
   ``Helping the PCAs to survive the financial strain brought on by
this year's drought is particularly important, because the
district's farmers and ranchers rely on their PCAs for short-term
credit,'' he said.
   The St. Paul bank will receive the cash assistance by selling up
to $133 million in preferred stock to the Farm Credit System
Financial Assistance Corp., which will fund that investment by
selling 15-year bonds.
   The U.S. Treasury will pay the interest on the bonds for the
first five years, and the Treasury and the Farm Credit System, or
FCS, will split the interest payments in the second five years. The
system will assume full responsibility for interest payments in the
final five years.
   The 1987 law created the board to work with troubled FCS
institutions. It was chartered last January and consists of
Agriculture Secretary Richard E. Lyng, Deputy Treasury Secretary M.
Peter McPherson, and Indiana farmer William W. Erwin.

<HEAD>Medical Student Suspended From University For Slapping Daughter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The University of Florida has suspended
a senior medical student for slapping his 15-year-old daughter. The
student said the slap was discipline, but the university said it
was unacceptable.
   ``The university sabotaged his whole career,'' said Horace
Moore, an attorney representing Fons Amaye-Obu, who said this week
he plans to seek a court injunction to get his client reinstated.
   Amaye-Obu, 34, a fourth-year medical student from Nigeria, was
suspended Aug. 25 until May 15, 1989, for slapping his daughter at
their home. He was scheduled to graduate next May, then start his
residency.
   The incident occurred Aug. 4 at a university-owned housing
coimplex.
   Amaye-Obu said he had asked his daughter to put dinner on the
table. The girl apparently shouted at him and he slapped her.
   ``I don't tolerate that kind of rudeness,'' Amaye-Obu said.
``Her behavior is intolerable.''
   The day after she was slapped, the girl reported it to the
University Police Department. Amaye-Obu was arrested for aggravated
child abuse, according to the police report.
   He was released the next day on his own recognizance.
   The girl's eyelids and lips were swollen and she had a bruised
nose, according to the police report. Amaye-Obu denied that the
girl was bruised and said she didn't require treatment when she was
taken by university police to Shands Hospital.
   The case was turned over to the Alachua County State Attorney's
Office and also is being investigated by the Department of Health
and Rehabilitative Services, which handles child welfare.
   Irene Stevens, the university's director of Student Judicial
Affairs, said in a letter dated Aug. 25 that Amaye-Obu was being
suspended for ``physically abusing'' his daughter.
   ``This is a matter the university should not be involved in,''
Amaye-Obu said.
   His attorney agreed.
   ``I think it's wrong for administrators at the University of
Florida to get involved in family matters, especially when you're
talking about parents raising their children,'' Moore said.
   ``The Student Code of Conduct says we will hold students
accountable for all matters,'' Ms. Stevens said Wednesday. ``We
have a right to have guidelines for students.''
   Both Dean of Students James Scott and President Marshall Criser
have refused to overturn Ms. Stevens' decision, although Scott has
agreed to review the case in December.
   Scott also required Amaye-Obu to seek counseling to help him
``develop more acceptable approaches in dealing with people,
including members of your family. Written documentation verifying
this counseling is required.''
   As a result of the suspension, Amaye-Obuu was evicted from
university housing and denied any financial aid. The 15-year-old is
temporarily living with Amaye-Obu's ex-wife, although he wants to
send his daughter back to Nigeria to live with his parents.

<TEXT>
   The Environmental Protection Agency
violated its own rules in approving the shipment of 47,000 tons of
toxic Texas soil to an Alabama landfill, a federal judge said
Friday as he temporarily blocked the transfer.
   U.S. District Judge Robert Varner said federal officials failed
to properly notify Alabama that the EPA had approved the shipment
of PCB-contaminated dirt from Houston to Chemical Waste Management
Inc.'s west Alabama disposal facility.
   Truck shipments from the Geneva Industries site in Texas to the
Emelle landfill were to begin Saturday.
   The Texas site, contaminated with polychlorinated biphenyls, is
part of the federal Superfund cleanup program. PCBs once were
commonly used in electrical transformers as a coolant but have
since been banned.
   The Alabama landfill is the nation's largest commercial
hazardous waste disposal site.
   Chris Grimshawe, a spokesman with Chemical Waste Management,
said the company had a $16.1 million contract to dispose of the
2,000 truckloads of dirt. He said the amount of PCBs actually
contained in the soil would fill one tractor-trailer rig.
   ``We have had bigger, but it's a pretty good size contract,'' he
said.
   Bradley Bridgewater, a Justice Department attorney representing
the EPA, argued Alabama was not included under EPA guidelines
governing the shipment of toxic wastes, and therefore, no warning
was needed.
   Varner dismissed the claim.
   ``Do you think that the split end who catches a forward pass is
an affected party? Certainly he is,'' Varner said. ``It seems to me
that Alabama ... is a receiving state to the toxic waste.''
   Varner did not rule on whether the PCB shipments posed an
environmental hazard. But, he said, ``With an EPA director who did
not follow the law (in approving the shipment), I'm afraid there
may be.''
   Varner said he would hear arguments as soon as next week on
whether to extend the prohibition, requested by Gov. Guy Hunt and
state Attorney General Don Siegelman.
   Siegelman, who attended the hearing, praised the ruling, while
Hunt, attending a trade meeting in South Carolina, had no immediate
comment.

<HEAD>British Airways to Order $1.78 Billion in Boeing Jets</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   British Airways PLC announced Friday it has agreed
to place orders for at least 31 Boeing Co. jets for $1.78 billion
to replace part of its aging fleet of commercial aircraft.
   British Airways said it chose Boeing over other contenders for
the orders, including the European consortium Airbus Industrie,
partly because of the compatibility of the new jets with the
airline's existing fleet of 170 planes, which already is dominated
by Boeing aircraft.
   British Airways said the two companies have so far signed a
memorandum of understanding. A purchase contract is to be signed
once British Airways obtains necessary financing, the airline said.
   British Airways has agreed to order 24 B737s, six B767-300s, and
one Boeing 757.
   The airline also has reserved options on a further 11 B737s, one
B757 and six B767s. The company said it plansto take up at least
nine of these options.
   The agreement also covers spare parts and spare engines.
   The B737s under order will be powered by the CFM 56-3 engine,
manufactured by General Electric Co. and France's Societe Nationale
d'Etude et de Construction de Moteurs d'Aviation, the airline said.
These jets are due to begin service in autumn 1991.
   The B767s and 757 will be powered by Rolls-Royce PLC engines.
   The new aircraft will replace British Airways' existing fleet of
39 BAC 1-11s and will be used mainly for destinations within
Britain and in Europe.
   The B737s have varying capacities ranging from 105 seats to 145
seats. The BAC 1-11 seats either 75 passengers or 99 passengers.
   British Airways said the decision to order the Boeing jets over
the Airbus A320 was taken ``on purely commercial grounds.'' The
Boeing package offered ``greater flexibility, compatibility with
our existing fleet and competitive economics,'' British Airways
said.

   Restaurateur Peter Langan suffered
serious burns Friday when fire swept through his home, and his
wife, Susan, broke her ankle when she jumped from a bedroom window.
   Rescue workers initially said the fire started after an argument
between the couple at their 10-bedroom home in Alphamstone, Essex,
about 50 miles northwest of London. But chef Richard Shepherd, one
of Langan's partners, said later it was ``a pure accident'' that
occurred when an oil heater in their bedroom caught fire.
   Langan, 47, suffered a head injury, severe burns to his back and
body and smoke inhalation, police said. He was transferred to the
burns unit at St. Andrew's Hospital in Billericay. Mrs. Langan, 46,
was treated at Colchester General Hospital.
   Langan's Brasserie, one of London's best-known show business
hangouts, is co-owned by Langan, Shepherd and actor Michael Caine.

   The State Department on Friday welcomed the
decision of Soviet authorities to allow dissident leader Andrei
Sakharov to visit the United States.
   It urged Moscow to give the same permission to all Soviets
wishing to travel abroad.
   Spokesman Charles Redman said Sakharov will be traveling in his
capacity as a trustee of the newly formed International Foundation
for the Survival and Development of Humanity. He has never traveled
to a foreign country before.
   Sakharov also will receive the $50,000 Albert Einstein
Foundation Peace Prize for 1988 in Washington on Nov. 15, the
foundation announced.
   The prize is designed ``to foster and advance prospects for
world peace and to demonstrate to the world that individuals can
and do make a difference,'' said Robert Swartz, a director of the
foundation.
   Norman Cousins, chairman of the selection board, said Sakharov
was chosen for his efforts to improve East-West relations and human
rights, particularly in the Soviet Union.
   While welcoming the Soviet decision concerning Sakharov, a
physicist who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1975 for his human
rights activities, Redman criticized the Soviets for refusing exit
visas for others.
   ``Soviet use of alleged knowledge of state secrets to deny many
other Soviet citizens the right to travel abroad is deplorable and
inconsistent with Soviet commitments under the Helsinki Accords,''
Redman said.
   ``We would welcome a change in policy by the Soviet authorities
in regard to all others who wish to travel abroad.

   Singer Dionne Warwick joined top federal
health officials Friday at a birthday celebration for Bill Travis
and other people suffering from AIDS.
   Travis, who turned 25 this week, emerged last year as a sort of
informal AIDS ``poster boy'' for the Public Health Service as one
of those appearing in a series of television public announcements.
   He subsequently became a favorite of television and newspaper
interviewers and has maintained an active speaking schedule,
frequently to student groups.
   Again Friday, Travis' role was as much symbolic as personal as
Miss Warwick, who donated the proceeds from her hit recording
``That's What Friends Are For'' to the fight against AIDS, led the
audience in singing ``Happy Birthday'' to him.
   About a dozen other people with acquired immune deficiency
syndrome were in the audience, along with a number of other
entertainers.
   ``It's really fabulous to see so many people come together today
_ without fear and in harmony _ to celebrate a simple but awesomely
meaningful occasion, a birthday, something most of us take quite
for granted,'' Miss Warwick said.
   ``To my special friends here who have AIDS, a birthday is a
wonderful milestone,'' Miss Warwick said. ``It's a major step, a
symbol of hope.
   Health and Human Services Secretary Otis R. Bowen recalled how
he and a number of other HHS officials signed a birthday card for
Travis last October.
   ``At the time, no one knew whether Bill would be able to join us
again this year,'' Bowen said. ``Celebrating another year of life _
and the joy that each new day brings _ gives hope to people with
AIDS and to those who are infected with the AIDS virus.
   The nation's top health officer said the birthday gathering for
Travis also serves as ``a reminder to health professionals that
their work in caring for people with AIDS is not without positive
results.''
   ``This celebration of life and hope stands as a goal _ like a
finish line in a race _ to those who toil in our nation's
laboratories to find a vaccine, more therapies and a cure,'' Bowen
said.
   The celebration was organized by Dr. Robert E. Windom, head of
the Public Health Service, and his staff.
   Surgeon General C. Everett Koop was among the other members of
the health hierarchy attending and wishing Travis a happy birthday.

   The World Series victory by the Dodgers may
be a boost to the Michael Dukakis campaign, with history showing
the Democrats with the clear edge in presidential elections when
the National League wins the baseball championship.
   Since 1908, the Democrats have won five of seven elections when
the National League finished on top, but have lost eight of 13
elections when the American League prevailed.
   ``The Republicans must be mourning the American League loss last
night since it foreshadows a Republican loss on Nov. 8 in the World
Series of Politics,'' said Steve Hopcraft, a Dukakis spokesman.
   But Republicans have recent history on their side. Ronald Reagan
bucked tradition to win the White House in 1980 after the
Philadelphia Phillies of the National League beat the Kansas City
Royals four games to two.
   The only other Republican to do that was William H. Taft, who
beat Democrat William J. Bryant in 1908 after the National League's
Chicago Cubs defeated the Detroit Tigers four games to one.
   The question, as usual, is whether Reagan's magic will rub off
on George Bush. The GOP thinks it already has.
   ``The bottom line is, so far in this game, we've pitched him
(Dukakis) a no-hitter consistently. He'd be mistaken to try to
steal home when he's still on first base,'' said Bush spokesman
Mark Goodin.

<TEXT>
   The judge in the Iran-Contra conspiracy case
on Friday cancelled a Nov. 3 hearing he had scheduled to hear
motions on a request to dismiss charges against former presidential
aide Oliver L. North.
   U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell gave no reason for
canceling the hearing, but he issued the order after both sides had
requested delays in meeting various deadlines previously set by the
court.
   Gesell granted independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh a brief
extension of time to respond to North's 37 pre-trial motions and
ordered the defense to advise him by Oct. 28 of how much time it
wanted to reply to the prosecution briefs, now due Oct. 26.
   Gesell also denied North's request for additional time to
compile a list of secret government documents he wants to make
public to defend charges he conspired to illegally divert proceeds
from the U.S.-Iran arms sales to the Nicaraguan rebels.
   North has until Nov. 14 to file the notice under the Classified
Information Procedures Act.
   Once the notice is filed, Gesell said he would schedule
``continuous hearings'' to conduct a ``document by document''
review of North's requests to disclose secrets when the case goes
to trial.
   Gesell ordered North to attend the hearings, which will be
closed to the public to protect the secret information under
discussion.
   The former National Security Council aide is charged along with
former national security adviser John M. Poindexter, and arms
dealers Albert Hakim and retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard V.
Secord.
   Separate trials have been ordered for each of the defendants.
North is set to be tried first but no date has been set for the
trial.

   A federal grand jury today indicted former
Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos and his wife on racketeering
charges, alleging they plundered their homeland of millions of
dollars and defrauded U.S. banks.
   According to the indictment, Marcos transferred $103 million
into the United States to buy Manhattan real estate and also
defrauded banking institutions of more than $165 million in the
purchase and financing of those properties.
   The indictment charged that between 1972 and 1986, when Marcos
and his wife Imelda fled to the United States, they accumulated
millions of dollars through embezzlement, theft, bribes and
kickbacks.
   ``This is a plan hatched and begun in the Phillipines to move
massive amounts of money illegally into the United States,'' said
U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani. ``Then the Marcoses came to the
United States and continued their illegal activities.''
   He said at least $250 million in property would be subject to
forfeiture.
   ``No one is above the law,'' Giuliani said.
   The Marcoses, who have spent their exile in Hawaii, were ordered
to appear in federal court Oct. 31.
   In Honolulu, Marcos remained in seclusion, but his
Washington-based attorney, Richard Hibey, told reporters he had
been offered a ``drop dead'' deal in which government attorneys
refused to negotiate a settlement.
   ``This was not a plea bargain ... it was a set of non-negotiable
demands,'' Hibey said.
   Marcos ``is well, he is alert and he's looking forward to
defending himself,'' Hibey said. ``Mrs. Marcos is as strong and as
resolute about defending herself as the president.''
   Hibey said the Marcoses will plead innocent.
   Marcos' health, however, will be a major factor in the case,
Hibey said.
   ``I am personally concerned...that he may not be physically able
to withstand the rigors of a criminal trial of this scope and
magnitude,'' said Hibey, who described Marcos' health as ``frail.''
   Also charged with racketeering were Saudi Arabian financier
Adnan Khashoggi; Bienvenido Tantoco Sr., former Philippine
ambassador to the Vatican; his wife, Gliceria, once the president
of Rustans, a Filipino department store; the Los Angeles-based
California Overseas Bank; its chairman, Roberto S. Benedicto; and
the bank's former president, Rodolfo T. Aranbulo.
   A spokesman for President Reagan, who was in Kentucky today,
said the president ``is saddened'' by the indictments because
Marcos ``is an old friend and a friend of the country.''
   ``But it's clear that the Justice Department has a very strong
case and it will proceed through the system,'' White House
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said.
   The grand jury charges are the culmination of a criminal
investigation launched nearly 2{ years ago by Giuliani.
   The six-count indictment charges the Marcoses engaged in a
``pattern of racketeering activities'' to divert Philippine
government funds and cash and stock garnered through bribes and
kickbacks to U.S. investments.
   From 1981 to 1983, the Marcoses transferred $103 million to buy
four valuable Manhattan properties, including commercial buildings
at Herald Square and on Fifth Avenue, Madison Avenue and Wall
Street, the indictments say.
   The Marcoses and their alleged co-racketeers were also accused
of obstucting justice in a civil lawsuit filed by the Filipino
government to reclaim the Manhattan properties.
   The Marcoses, the Tantocos and Khashoggi allegedly plotted to
conceal the true ownership of the four buildiungs through false
documents.
   The Marcoses are also accused of a scheme to buy $5.9 million in
art objects and also transporting money and certain works of art
they knew to be stolen.
   The indictment also charges that the Marcoses and Tantocos
defrauded two U.S. banks _ Citibank and Security Pacific National
Bank _ and the Security Pacific Mortgage Corp. of more than $165
million in order to buy one of the buildings and refinance others.
   Under the racketeering laws, the government is seeking
forfeiture of all the defendants' property obtained through illegal
activity. For the Marcoses, that includes the four New York
buildings, foreign bank accounts and other property interest they
hold.
   The government also is seeking forfeiture of Khashoggi's
condominium at the posh Olympic Towers in Manhattan, as well as
bank accounts and any interest he holds in the four buildings.
   The indictment charges Khashoggi joined a scheme to backdate his
interest in the Marcos-owned buildings to prevent the Philippines
from winning them in U.S. court.
   Khashoggi is also accused of submitting a false document to
French officials seeking evidence at U.S. request in the Marcos
investigation.
   All of those charged with racketeering and racketeering
conspiracy face a maximum of 20 years in prison and $250,000 in
fines on each count.
   The Marcoses, the Tantocos, their son Bienvenido Jr., Jaime
Alberto Arias _ a Panamanian attorney associated with the Tantocos
_ and Khashoggi associate Karl Bock Peterson were charged with one
count of obstructing justice and one count of mail fraud for their
part in the scheme to conceal the ownership of the buildings. They
would face up to five years in prison on each count if convicted.
   Khashoggi would face an additional 15-year penalty on each of
two obstruction of justice counts.
   Khashoggi, a central figure in the secret sale of arms to Iran
by the Reagan administration, posed as the owner of valuable
paintings and New York property secretly held by the Marcoses,
according to court documents filed earlier.
   The Justice Department decided to move against Marcos, 71, after
his lawyers, involved in plea bargaining negotiations with federal
prosecutors, missed a deadline Thursday afternoon to respond to a
demand that he plead guilty to a racketeering charge, according to
federal sources in Washington.
   Earlier Thursday, President Reagan indicated he would step aside
and not intervene to stop a Marcos indictment, saying that in order
to bring the matter to him, ``I would think that it would have to
be a matter of foreign policy.''
   Reagan said, ``It may not come to my desk at all.''
   Engaging in plea bargaining discussions prior to indictment was
a concession by the Justice Department to the State Department,
which urged such a course in an attempt to avoid indicting the
former head of state. Justice Department officials had wanted an
indictment to precede any plea bargaining negotiations.
   In Manila, Philippine officials today hailed reports of an
impending indictment of Marcos as a major breakthrough in efforts
to collect the billions he allegedly embezzled as president.
   The Philippine government has filed 39 civil suits against
Marcos seeking to collect $96.7 billion in damages. But no criminal
charges have been filed because officials fear Marcos would insist
on his constitutional right to return to the Philippines from
Hawaii to face his accusers in court since the Philippine
constitution forbids criminal trials in absentia.
   On Thursday, President Corazon Aquino said that a U.S.
indictment of Marcos would speed recovery of the embezzeled funds.
She said Marcos would still be subject to prosecution in the
Philippines regardless of American legal moves.
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater had indicated last week
that Reagan would be the ultimate arbiter on the delicate matter of
indicting a onetime U.S. ally, but on Thursday, Fitzwater backed
away from that.

   Eight months after the Reagan administration
decided it would rather have a smaller military than a ``hollow''
one, the armed services have met their assigned goals of slashing a
combined 36,000 positions.
   The Defense Department, in a routine monthly manpower strength
update, said Friday that 2,136,747 men and women were in uniform
and on active duty as of Sept. 30, the end of fiscal 1988.
   That represents a drop of 37,470 people under arms compared with
Sept. 30, 1987, exceeding the reduction goal of 35,890 that Defense
Secretary Frank C. Carlucci set last February.
   The decline also represents the largest swing in U.S. military
strength from one year to the next since 1976, when the American
armed forces lost 46,210 men and women in the wind-down after the
Vietnam War.
   Under Carlucci's directive, revealed in February when he sent
the Pentagon's fiscal 1989 budget proposal to Congress, the Army,
Navy, Air Force and Marine Corps now will be expected to maintain
their combined strength at roughly 2,138,000 for the next 12 months.
   The monthly totals are expected to vary, however, due to normal
swings in the arrival of new recruits and re-enlistment patterns.
Most of the reductions were made through changes in recruiting
goals, tighter re-enlistment standards and ``early out'' incentives.
   Friday's report showed the Air Force and Marine Corps began
fiscal 1989 still slightly above the target figures Carlucci gave
them, while the Army and Navy began the year below their assigned
targets.
   As of Sept. 30, the Air Force reported active-duty strength of
576,446, down 30,589 compared with Sept. 30, 1987, but still
slightly above the target of 575,603.
   The Marine Corps said it had 197,350 men and women on active
duty at the end of last month, down 2,175 compared with year-ago
levels but not quite down to the target of 197,224.
   The Army, meantime, had 771,847 men and women on active duty,
down 8,968 compared with year-ago levels. It had been given a
target of 772,300.
   And the Navy _ the only one of the four services authorized to
increase slightly in size in fiscal 1988 _ didn't grow quite as
fast as expected. As of Sept. 30, it had 591,104 on active duty, up
4,262 compared with Sept. 30, 1987, but still slightly below its
target of 593,200.
   Statistically, the cutbacks reported Friday amount to only 1.7
percent of the force that was on duty a year ago. The cuts,
however, are viewed on Capitol Hill and inside the Pentagon as a
clear sign of the difficult budget environment that will confront
the next president.
   Carlucci told Congress in February that he and President Reagan
thought the fiscal 1989 budget compromise failed to provide enough
money for defense and that the United States would face a higher
security risk as a result.
   In that environment, he said, the United States should maintain
a lean, well-equipped force and hope for the best rather than a
larger force that couldn't be equipped properly.
   ``We've made the hard choices here,'' Carlucci said at the time.
``We have traded off a smaller force in order to maintain a quality
force.''
   Congress ultimately accepted Carlucci's decision on the size of
the military in approving the fiscal 1989 defense authorization
bill, which totals $299.5 billion.

   A compromise anti-drug bill includes a
provision for warning labels on alcoholic beverages.
   The labels would be added a year after the bill's enactment.
   The message: ``According to the surgeon general, women should
not drink alcoholic beverages during pregnancy because of the risk
of birth defects. Consumption of alcoholic beverages impairs your
ability to drive a car or operate machinery, and may cause health
problems.''
   Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., the author of the language, has
been trying for 19 years to have Congress pass the warning label
provision.
   ``This has been a long, difficult fight to warn consumers of the
dangers associated with alcohol abuse,'' Thurmond said. ``However,
today I can say unquestionably that it was well worth the effort.
   ``What we are able to accomplish now is to provide information
so consumers of alcohol can make an informed decision.''
   Thurmond said it was not his intention ``to stop people from
drinking,'' but to ``better inform the public of the problems
associated with the abuse of alcohol.''

   A federal judge said Friday that a
``settlement in principle'' has been reached between plaintiffs and
defendants in litigation stemming from the collapse of L'Ambiance
Plaza apartment house.
   ``It's up to the lawyers to iron out the implementation,'' U.S.
District Judge Robert C. Zampano said. ``Not all of the obstacles
are resolved, but we don't see any insurmountable obstacles.''
   He declined to discuss any details of the settlement involving
the collapse during construction in Bridgeport, including any
monetary damages.
   Zampano and state Superior Court Judge Frank S. Meadow have been
mediating discussions among the lawyers for 44 plaintiffs _
families of the 28 men killed in the collapse and 16 injured
workers _ and 39 defendants, including builders and the city of
Bridgeport.
   The judges' aim was to settle the estimated 200 lawsuits that
experts said they expected to result from the collapse. It could
have taken 10 years to 15 years for all the suits to make their
ways through the court system.
   Ninety-two lawyers have been involved in the negotiations, which
began in February.
   L'Ambiance Plaza, being built in the ``lift slab'' method in
which concrete floor slabs are poured on the ground and then jacked
into place, collapsed while a floor was being hoisted on April 23,
1987.
   Zampano said he still must meet with some defendants ``to settle
their contractual disputes.''
   He said another matter still outstanding is $5.1 million total
in fines issued last year by the federal Occupational Safety and
Health Administration against five companies for violations of
safety regulations at the building site.
   Lawyers for the defendants had hoped to make the OSHA fines part
of the settlement.
   As part of a minimum settlement proposal already accepted by the
plaintiffs, L'Ambiance Plaza would be rebuilt under court
trusteeship. Part of the building's profits would go to annuities
set up for the injured and families of the men killed.
   Kevin Coles, a Bridgeport attorney who represents Texstar
Construction Co. of San Antonio, Texas, one of the L'Ambiance
contractors, said: ``These things are very sensitive, ... but I
agree a settlement in principle has been reached. There are a lot
of details to be worked out, but I'm optimistic about it.''
   Attorneys for the plaintiffs didn't immediately return telephone
calls seeking comment Friday.
   Zampano said plaintiffs' and defendants' attorneys will meet
Oct. 31 to discuss how to implement the settlement.
   ``The famous saying is `It ain't over till it's over,' but the
mere fact that the lawyers will sit down with a purpose of meeting
to discuss the appropriate paperwork is good,'' Zampano said.
   He also said details of reconstructing the building have not
been worked out.
   ``All I can do is commend parties on both sides for their
cooperation and dedication to the settlement process,'' he said.
   He said if all goes well, the deal will be completed within 30
days.

   A man who robbed a convenience store
and then sued it for injuries he got while fleeing had the tables
turned on him by a jury that awarded the clerk $25,000 in a
counterclaim.
   ``I can't believe someone would rob a store and then expect
people to pay for his doctor bills,'' said clerk Joseph Sheffield,
who was robbed at gunpoint in January 1987. ``It doesn't seem
right.''
   A Circuit Court jury decided Thursday it would not award Alvin
Charles Hampton any money for his injuries, and ordered him,
instead, to pay Sherffield $25,000.
   ``We wanted to send a message to criminals and potential
criminals that you're going to have to pay for your crime by
serving time, and you may have to pay money, too,'' said one
unidentified juror.
   Hampton's attorney, Henry Davis, argued that although his client
was fleeing from the scene of a crime, he should be paid for his
injuries.
   ``The crime was over. When the crime was over, he had the same
rights as anyone else injured on the highway,'' Davis said.
   But Lil' Champ convenience store's attorney, Nolan Winn, told
jurors, ``when you commit a crime, you assume a risk that you might
get hurt, especially when the crime involves a gun.''
   The jury deliberated 25 minutes before reaching its verdict.
   On Jan. 19, 1987, a gunman took $100 and a dozen cartons of
cigarettes from the store. Sheffield jumped into his pickup truck
and chased the robber for about 10 blocks.
   The clerk rammed his truck into the back of the getaway car,
forcing it to crash into a tree.
   Hampton, 34, who later pleaded guilty, suffered a broken hip.

<HEAD>Dukakis Turns Up Heat With New Ads; Bush Asks Chemical Weapon Ban</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Updates with Bush ad-man's comment, inserting 1 graf after
8th graf, He accuses</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By EILEEN PUTMAN</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Democrat Michael Dukakis charged in a tough new TV ad Friday
that George Bush is airing commercials that are ``full of lies and
he knows it.'' Bush, leading in the polls, turned to a condemnation
of chemical weapons.
   Trailing with just 17 days remaining until the election, the
Dukakis campaign unveiled its most pointed ads of the year,
accusing Bush of distorting Dukakis' record on crime and defense.
   The Massachusetts governor set the stage earlier Friday when he
said on network talk shows, ``I've been subject to attacks and
distortions'' and the ``American people are not happy with this
campaign'' because it had been too negative.
   He said Bush's attack on the Massachusetts prisoner-furlough
program was ``cynical and very hypocritical.'' The Bush camp has
made much of the fact that Willie Horton, a convicted murderer,
escaped while on furlough, raped a Maryland woman and assaulted her
fiance.
   ``To play politics with that kind of human tragedy, I think, is
one of the most cynical things you can do,'' Dukakis said.
   In one of the new TV spots, Dukakis is shown watching a Bush
campaign ad depicting Dukakis riding in an armored tank. Dukakis
snaps off the TV, turns to the viewer and says he is ``fed up''
with Bush's attacks.
   ``Haven't seen anything like it in 25 years of public life,
George Bush's negative TV ads: distorting my record, full of lies
and he knows it,'' Dukakis says in his own ad.
   He accuses Bush of ``dragging truth into the gutter'' and adds:
``I'm on the record for the very weapons systems his ads say I'm
against.''
   Sig Rogich, Bush's ad director, defended the Republican's
commercials, saying, ``There's nothing erroneous about any of those
ads or the truth of the matter is the networks wouldn't accept
them. ... We stand by everything we have in our ads.''
   The Republicans were on the attack, too.
   Bush, seeking Ohio's 23 electoral votes, said Dukakis'
opposition to the space-based missile defense system, known as Star
Wars, was bad for the country.
   ``The last thing we or our allies need at a time when ballistic
missiles are proliferating is someone who regards strategic defense
as a fraud or a fantasy,'' he said in an address at the University
of Toledo.
   In the main thrust of his speech, Bush said he wants to be known
as the president who helped achieve an effective ban on chemical
weapons, a subject he said had gained new urgency with their recent
use in the Iran-Iraq war.
   He said countries guilty of chemical warfare should face ``the
censure of all nations,'' and he proposed other measures such as
on-site inspection on demand of suspicious plants.
   The Dukakis campaign has accused Bush of being hypocritical on
the chemical warfare issue since he cast tie-breaking votes in the
Senate to continue stockpiling new germ and chemical weapons in
1983 and 1986. But a Bush aide said the Reagan administration felt
it was better to put the old deteriorating U.S. chemical weapons in
new, safer forms.
   Dukakis has been stepping up his counterattacks against Bush
allegations recently, as polls have indicated he's lagging in the
fight for the White House.
   Peace broke out briefly Thursday as the two presidential
candidates appeared jointly at the Alfred E. Smith charity dinner
in New York, where Republicans say Dukakis' once-strong support is
shaky. The two men are also scheduled to attend an Italian-American
dinner Saturday night in Washington.
   Dukakis on Friday tried to rally New York City voters by
pledging to wage an anti-drug war that ``should know no bounds.''
He said Bush was ``more interested in photo opportunities'' than in
waging a real fight against drugs. One of his new ads also attacks
Bush as ineffective on the drug issue and casts doubts on GOP vice
presidential candidate Dan Quayle's ability to take over the
administration's drug fight in a Bush presidency.
   Bush got a strong defense from President Reagan, campaigning in
Kentucky for the GOP ticket. Reagan said he had given Bush ``some
of the most sensitive and difficult tasks we've had, and he's never
let me or the country down.''
   Reagan also said that Dukakis, if elected, would choose liberal
activists soft on crime to fill Supreme Court vacancies. Dukakis,
in his morning TV interviews, defended his judicial appointments in
Massachusetts, saying ``I'm looking for people of independence,
intelligence, integrity.''
   The nominees' running mates were also on the campaign trail.
Democrat Lloyd Bentsen told nursing students in San Antonio, Texas,
that the Dukakis ticket stood for programs needed by working women,
including pay equity, day care, an increased minimum wage and the
Equal Rights Amendment.
   Quayle, in an attack on Dukakis, mocked Bentsen's stern
admonishment to him during their Oct. 5 debates. Bentsen had told
Quayle ``You're no Jack Kennedy,'' when Quayle tried to compare his
age and legislative experience to Kennedy's in 1960.
   Noting that some have suggested Dukakis will stage a late
comeback, similar to Truman's in 1948, Quayle said in a Johnson
City, Tenn., speech: ``I don't know Michael Dukakis, I never served
with Michael Dukakis. Michael Dukakis is not a good friend of mine.
But I know this: Michael Dukakis is no Harry Truman.''

   Democrat Michael Dukakis, whose television
commercials so far have drawn little more than criticism, unveiled
a series of fiery new ads Friday attacking his Republican opponents
by name and calling their TV spots ``full of lies.''
   ``I'm fed up with it,'' an angry Dukakis says in an ad titled
``Counterpunch.'' The governor is shown snapping off a television
set showing a ``negative'' commercial for Republican presidential
nominee George Bush.
   ``Haven't seen anything like it in 25 years in public life,''
Dukakis says. ``George Bush's negative TV ads _ distorting my
record, full of lies, and he knows it.''
   Dukakis goes on to assert that both candidates support a strong
defense. ``So this isn't about defense issues. It's about dragging
the truth into the gutter. And I'm not going to let them do it,''
Dukakis says, striking the pose of a fighter.
   Reflecting the candidate's underdog status after months of
broadcast pummeling by Vice President Bush, all four of the new
Dukakis ads make some mention of Bush or his running mate, Sen. Dan
Quayle.
   The ``Counterpunch'' ad and a similar spot titled
``Differences'' also try to build a closer connection between
Dukakis and the viewer than many of his previous advertisements,
some of which were faulted as too abstract.
   But even the most ``positive'' moments in the new advertisements
lack the balloons, flags and traditional Madison Ave. touches.
   There aren't any suit coats either. Instead, Dukakis is shown in
his shirtsleeves, speaking directly to the viewer as the camera
moves to a close-up shot of his face.
   Dukakis campaign aides said the messages would begin airing this
weekend in ``battleground states,'' but they would not say exactly
where or at what cost.
   ``These ads are about George Bush's hypocrisy and the campaign
of distortion George Bush has chosen to run,'' Dukakis spokesman
Mark Gearan said. ``George Bush doesn't want this campaign to be
about his record, so he's used lies and distortions and labels.''
   Sig Rogich, ad director for the Bush campaign, defended the GOP
commercials, saying: ``There's nothing erroneous about any of those
ads or the truth of the matter is the networks wouldn't accept
them. They check the facts and so do we. We stand by everything we
have in our ads.''
   In the final 2{ weeks, the Dukakis campaign hopes to lash back
at Bush and, at the same time, step out from the Bush onslaught and
talk directly to voters. Plans call for Dukakis to grant lengthy
television interviews and to buy chunks of prime time.
   The new Dukakis ads include two blistering, flat-out
``negative'' spots _ one aimed at Bush and Quayle, the other aimed
at Bush's advertising campaign.
   In a spot titled ``Effort,'' a narrator savages the Bush effort
to stop drugs from entering the United States while the screen
shows black-and-white images of bundles of cocaine, children buying
drugs and Bush meeting with Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega.
   Shifting the attack onto Quayle, the ad goes on to ask, ``If
George Bush couldn't handle the job, how do you think Quayle is
gonna do?''
   The fourth ad attempts to rebut a Bush ad that depicts a
revolving door in the Massachusetts prison system and reminds
viewers that a convicted murderer fled from a Massachusetts
furlough and terrorized a Maryland couple.
   The Dukakis advertisement asserts that the Massachusetts
furlough program was begun by a Republican governor, which is true,
and that it was ``stopped by Mike Dukakis.'' But it does not
mention that Dukakis bowed to public pressure and did not eliminate
the program until faced with a referendum campaign.
   Dukakis, who has called Bush ``cynical'' for making political
hay out of a human tragedy, uses the same technique, turning the
spotlight on the federal prison furlough system.
   ``Bush won't talk about this drug pusher _ one of his furloughed
heroin dealers _ who raped and murdered Patsy Pedrin, pregnant
mother of two,'' the ad says, as the victim's body is shown being
removed from a house on a stretcher.

<HEAD>UPI Lays Off 20-30 Employees</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   United Press International said Friday it has
laid off between 20 and 30 domestic employees and will place new
emphasis on state and regional news.
   Mark Estren, an executive vice president for the news service,
said the layoffs came from all areas, but he declined to provide
specifics. He said the layoffs were part of the company's plan,
announced last March, to save $5 million by reducing the staff by
150 employees around the world.
   ``The new focus of UPI's editorial product will be accomplished
through some streamlining of UPI's news staffs in areas other than
state and regional services,'' UPI President Paul Steinle said in a
statement. No bureaus will be closed, he said.
   Steinle, part of a new management team that took over the news
agency last February, said UPI plans changes to strengthen the
state and regional reports. He said UPI also will continue to
report national and international news.
   When Steinle and Earl W. Brian, UPI's chairman, took over the
company earlier this year, they vowed to make the company
profitable by the third quarter of 1989.
   To achieve the turnaround, Steinle said the company would save
$10 million by streamlining administrative overhead, $5 million in
staff reductions and obtain $15 million in financing from investors.
   In March, executives said the staff of 1,280 worldwide would be
reduced by layoffs, early retirements and attrition.

   The House on Friday approved a resolution
declaring next June 20 a national day of remembrance for political
prisoners in Iran.
   The measure, approved on a voice vote, applies to all such
prisoners in that country and makes no mention of specific groups
or political parties opposed to Iran's ruler, the Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini.
   The resolution was sponsored by Rep. Mervyn Dymally, D-Calif.,
who chairs the House subcommittee on census and population, the
panel that oversees all commemorative days considered by the House.
   Last August, Dymally collected the signatures of 170 of his
colleagues on a letter sent to U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez
de Cuellar, asking him to send a U.N. delegation to Iran to
investigate allegations of human rights abuses there.
   On June 20, 1981, a large protest rally in Tehran resulted in
the arrests of large numbers of demonstrators.
   The Senate would have to approve the resolution for it to take
effect.

<HEAD>Doctor Says Justice Planning `Remarkably Fast' Return to Work</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor's
plan to return to work just 10 days after breast cancer surgery is
``a remarkably fast recovery'' and may be good news for her
prognosis, a breast cancer expert said Friday.
   Dr. Robert S. Siegel, assistant professor of medicine and
director of a cancer treatment unit at George Washington University
Hospital, said the justice's announced plans to return to the bench
by Oct. 31 is ``a pretty quick return to work.''
   ``Ten days is on the swift side,'' Siegel said. ``That would be
a remarkably fast recovery.''
   Siegel was not involved in Mrs. O'Connor's case, and he was
commenting generally on conditions such as hers. But he said the
speed with which she plans to return to work may indicate the
cancer was caught at a very early time and that there is no
indication it has spread to other organs in the body.
   In a typical breast cancer case caught at a very early stage,
Siegel said, the patient can choose to have either a lumpectomy, in
which the tumor, and only the tumor, is removed from the breast, or
a modified radical mastectomy, in which the entire breast is
removed.
   Whichever procedure is used, however, it also typically involves
removal of the lymph glands under the arm.
   For a lumpectomy, patients usually are released from the
hospital in three days to four days, he said, but usually return in
two weeks to start radiation therapy.
   The radiation, in appropriate doses, usually is given once a
day, four to five days a week, for four to six weeks.
   For most patients, this is a difficult period because the
radiation causes fatigue.
   ``It would be difficult to maintain a full schedule'' while
receiving radiation, said Siegel, although he noted that some
patients handle it much more easily than others.
   Mrs. O'Connor said in a statement released by the court that the
cancer had been found in a very early form. However, neither her
statement nor the court indicated whether or not she would undergo
additional therapy.
   Patients receiving a modified radical mastectomy do not require
the radiation therapy and usually return to work within two weeks
to three weeks.
   Whichever procedure is used, Siegel said, the patient will go
through a full battery of diagnostic testing. This would include
special X-ray studies of the bone and the abdominal organs, and a
group of blood chemistry tests.
   If these tests reveal the presence of cancer elsewhere, then
there would be additional therapy or even more surgery.
   Siegel said the National Cancer Institute also has recommended
that those who had a lumpectomy also undergo ``adjuvant''
treatment. This could include chemotherpy, in which the patient is
given drugs designed to kill cancer cells, or hormonal treatment,
in which the patient is given hormones that discourage cancer cell
development.

<TEXT>
   Opposition leader Cuauhtemoc Cardenas said
Friday he will turn his democratic reform movement into a new
political party to challenge 60 years of domination by the
Institutional Revolutionary Party.
   ``We are once again on the border of history,'' said Cardenas,
who stunned the ruling party, known as by its Spanish initials PRI,
with his strong showing in the July 6 presidential election.
   Cardenas said his new Democratic Revolutionary Party will be
dedicated to electoral reforms that would assure the nation fair
and honest elections that would be open to all political parties.
   ``Thousands of citizens, women and men from throughout the
country have taken the initiative to create a new political
organization,'' Cardenas told a news conference Friday.
   Officially, Cardenas came in second with just over 38 percent of
the vote. He also carried Mexico City, home to a quarter of the
nation's estimated 80 million people.
   PRI candidate Carlos Salinas de Gortari, who won with just over
50 percent of vote, is scheduled to take the presidential oath on
Dec. 1.
   The PRI has dominated Mexican politics and government since the
early 1920s, winning every presidential election except the one on
July 6 with at least 70 percent of the vote.
   Cardenas and his leftist coalition says the RPI robbed him of
victory through ballot fraud. A citizen watchdog group agreed.
   ``On July 6, the Mexican people voted for equality, for justice,
for liberty and for democratic changes in the imperial political
regime,'' Cardenas said. ``This vote was ignored and made fun of by
fraud and by imposition.''
   Cardenas said Friday that the new party won't seek official
status from the government until a major organizational meeting on
Feb. 5.

<HEAD>Cox Retains Broker To Seek Buyer For Miami News</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cox Enterprises has retained a broker to find a
buyer for The Miami News, and several preliminary inquiries have
been made about the 92-year-old newspaper.
   ``Most were South Florida people not currently involved in
newspaper operations, some were acting as representatives of other
people,'' Lee Dirks of Lee Dirks & Associates of Birmingham, Mich.,
said Thursday.
   The names of prospective buyers will be kept confidential, and
David Easterly, president of the Cox Newspapers division, said a
price for the three-edition, afternoon paper is still being worked
out.
   Cox officials, citing declining circulation and continuing
financial losses, announced last week that The News will be closed
Dec. 31 if no buyer is found.
   The News' presses and advertising, circulation and promotion
departments are owned by The Miami Herald Publishing Co. Because of
that, Cox officials said they hold slim hope that a buyer for The
News can be found.
   The News has published under a joint operating agreement (JOA)
with The Herald, owned by Knight-Ridder Inc., since 1966.
   A continued JOA is not part of the sale, although Herald
officials have agreed to print The News for a year should anyone
buy it.
   The newspaper's daily circulation has declined from 112,000 in
1966, when the JOA with The Herald went into effect, to below
48,000 this summer, Cox officials said. It employs about 110 people.
   Cox owns several major newspapers, including the Atlanta Journal
and the Atlanta Constitution, The Palm Beach Post, the Dayton Daily
News and Journal Herald and the Austin (Texas) American-Statesman.

   Congress on Friday passed compromise
legislation that would further restrict lobbying by former
executive branch officials and apply lobbying restraints to former
members of Congress for the first time.
   The bill went to the president after the House approved it
347-7, and the Senate followed suit by voice vote.
   The legislation would bar departing members of Congress from
lobbying their former colleagues in either chamber for one year. An
earlier House version would have barred ex-lawmakers from lobbying
only in the branch where they served.
   The chief House sponsor, Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., said the
legislation would affect only former members who lobby for
compensation on behalf of others, not those who merely give advice.
   The bill would retain the current lifetime ban in current law
that prevents executive branch employees from lobbying on any issue
in which they had a ``personal and substantial'' involvement while
in government service.
   The legislation would bar former federal trade officials, for a
year after leaving, from lobbying for a foreign government or
foreign-controlled entity. The House bill, however, would allow the
former official to work for the foreign government or entity if he
or she does not lobby. An earlier Senate version would have banned
employment or lobbying for a year.
   Top congressional aides would be barred for a year from lobbying
their own member or the member's personal staff, and top committee
staff would be prohibited, for the same period, from lobbying the
committee's members or staff.
   Cabinet members and their top deputies would be prohibited from
lobbying their agency for one year after leaving, and top executive
branch staff could not lobby their agency for a year without
approval from the Office of Government Ethics.
   The bill provides for maximum penalties of $250,000 in fines and
five years in prison. Any proceeds received in violation of the law
would be subject to forfeiture in a civil action.
   Rep. Douglas H. Bosco, D-Calif., said there were only
``perceived abuses'' by former members of Congress, but no evidence
of actual wrongdoing.
   ``We're creating a reality here in the minds of the American
people,'' he said.
   Ann McBride, senior vice president of the Common Cause citizens
lobby, said that with its action, Congress ``began the long road to
restoring ethics and integrity in government.''
   ``Congressional passage of this legislation strengthens
revolving door restrictions on executive branch officials and ends
a double standard by covering members of Congress and senior
congressional staff for the first time,'' she said.

<TEXT>
   Investigators have disproved a dying
man's claim that he planted the bomb that killed four black girls
at a church in 1963, two prosecutors said Friday.
   The investigations, said U.S. Attorney Frank Donaldson, reveal
that Gary A. Tucker ``is the confessor of a crime he did not
commit.''
   Tucker, a 54-year-old man who is dying of cancer at a Veterans
Administration hospital in Tuscaloosa, told officers last week that
he and another person placed the bomb at the 16th Street Baptist
Church. The bomb exploded on Sunday, Sept. 15, 1963, killing the
four girls who were in a lounge preparing to take part in a youth
program.
   Donaldson said that Tucker ``made several statements. All of
them have been thoroughly investigated. There is no question about
it. Tucker's statements are not credible. Efforts were made to
corroborate his statements. This could not be done. In fact, they
were disproved.''
   Donaldson said he was disappointed because he had ``hoped this
horrible crime would be finally laid to rest.''
   Jefferson County District Attorney David Barber said that a
person Tucker named as an accomplice was in a state prison at the
time of the bombing.
   ``When compared with the knowledge gathered in previous
investigations, and the facts we learned in this investigation, his
story is simply not credible,'' Barber said at a news conference
with Donaldson.
   Relatives and friends of Tucker had said he suffers from
hallucinations and that they believed he was merely seeking
attention.
   A Ku Klux Klansman, Robert Chambliss, was convicted in 1977 of
murder in one of the bombing deaths and died in prison eight years
later while serving a life term.
   Donaldson and Barber said their files on the case are still
open, since there is no statute of limitations on murder, but they
said they have no leads.
   Barber said that several things in Tucker's statement were
inconsistent _ ``where the church is, descriptions of three
different automobiles he said he drove to the church, where he
lived, where he worked.
   ``Nothing he said was consistent with the facts other than
things he gleaned from newspapers.''
   Tucker, Barber said, ``said he realized he is dying, that he
doesn't have long to live and that he wanted to get this off his
conscience.''
   Donaldson said he hoped that news accounts of the investigations
into Tucker's statements will cause ``some people to come forth
with information that is helpful. We might get a deathbed statement
sometime. I had hoped that might have been the case this time.
   ``The crime was so horrendous, we have to follow up on anything,
especially so-called confessions.''
   Barber said he sympathized with ``the families of the victims of
this atrocity for having to relive their nightmare for the past
week.''

   Another round of handwritten, anonymous
letters harassing blacks, women and homosexuals at Dartmouth
College has students on edge and school officials looking for clues.
   ``Dartmouth is not going to permit that kind of intimidation,''
college spokesman Alex Huppe said Friday. ``It's not a situation
that we would allow to go unchecked.''
   About five letters sent in recent weeks to students and faculty
are similar to about 20 letters sent last spring to sorority house
residents, members of the Afro-American Society, the Dartmouth Gay
and Lesbian Organization and the Women's Issues League.
   Huppe said the Hanover police department is working with the
school. It appears most letters were sent through campus mail, not
the U.S. Postal Service, he said, which makes them even harder to
trace.
   After the spring mailing, Dartmouth hired specialists to analyze
the handwriting.
   In a letter sent to students last week, Dean Edward Shanahan
said officials believe the letters may have been written by someone
no longer enrolled at the Ivy League school.
   Shanahan also said some of the harassment may be generated by
more than one person.
   ``I'm disturbed about the behavior and what it's doing to the
students,'' Shanahan told the Valley News of West Lebanon. ``It's
certainly frightening some of the students and it worries me to
think it might not stop at the letters and other kinds of
harassment that have been present here.''
   ``It's been 15 years since Dartmouth became co-ed,'' said Robert
Lasser, a senior from Miami Beach, Fla. ``But the problem here is
there still is a male-dominated presence that really isn't willing
to allow women to equally participate on this campus.''
   ``It's been very frightening,'' said Kris Moller, a member of
the Women's Issues League, who has received three letters since
May, one of them last week. ``It's definitely had an effect on the
way I do things. It made me want to lay low for awhile but I
can't.''
   She said the latest letter had leaves glued to the paper with
chewed-up gum and the words ``leaf Dartmouth alone,'' and ``You
still disgust us.''
   ``I know this guy is targeting me for my feminist views. What is
really frightening is that there is really a kind of twisted
creativity at work here,'' she said.
   Allegra Burnette, another member of the Women's Issues League,
said she's seen many derogatory comments against women and blacks
etched into wooden desks.
   ``Stuff like this is all over school and I'm sure a lot of it
has been there for years,'' she said.

<HEAD>Survey Finds Older Consumers Unhappy, Willing to Complain</HEAD>

   Older consumers, who spend about $900 billion
annually, are unhappy with how they are portrayed by America's
advertisers and don't mind squawking about it, a researcher said.
   The mail survey of 1,000 people aged 55 and older also found 82
percent of them believe the products they buy don't work as
promised and 75 percent of those who are unhappy let others know.
   The survey by George P. Moschis also found about one-third of
the respondents had boycotted products or services because of what
they thought was ``inappropriate age stereotyping of their ads.''
   While part of the problems is Madison Avenue's youth-oriented
approach, Moschis said, ``most importantly is when older people are
portrayed in ads, they are not portrayed in a desirable fashion.
They are shown as senile, cranky, that kind of image.''
   ``The marketers and advertisers are not trained
gerontologists,'' Moschis, a professor of marketing and director of
the Center for Mature Consumer Studies at Georgia State University,
said Friday.
   ``On the other hand, gerontologists that know something about
older people have not been able to translate that knowledge into
marketing strategy.''
   That will become more important as the baby-boom generation ages.
   ``When the baby-boomers hit that 55-plus age bracket in about
10, 12 years or so, I think it's going to be amplified in terms of
importance,'' he said.
   Moschis, 44, said the over-55 population already controls more
than three-fourths of the country's wealth and has more than 50
percent of the country's discretionary income. In addition, he
said, people 55 and older control 80 percent of all deposits in the
nation's savings and loan institutions.
   A report to be published Sunday by the University of Southern
California and the National Institute of Aging indicates that clout
will only grow, with a quarter of the population over 65 years old
by 2040.
   Moschis categorized four kinds of consumers.
   _Healthy Hermits. He said 38 percent of the respondents fell
into this category, described as ``in good health, psychologically
withdrawn from society,'' with few social contacts and little
interest in staying active.
   _Ailing Outgoers. The other side of the coin accounts for 34
percent, the survey indicated. Described as ``in poor health,
unwilling to accept old age status, socially active, health
conscious, interest in learning to do new things.''
   _Frail Recluses. Fifteen percent of the respondents fell into
this category, identifies as ``in poor health, socially and
psychologically withdrawn, inactive, concerned with day-to-day
tasks, retired.''
   _Healthy Indulgers. These 13 percent are in very good health,
socially engaged, are self-satisfiers, independent, want the most
out of life and are relatively wealthy.
   The mail survey was conducted of a randomly selected sample
drawn from all 50 states. The margin of error is plus or minus 3
percent.

<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union has offered to break a path
to the stranded whales in Alaska with an icebreaking ship next week
if current rescue efforts don't succeed, Greenpeace said Friday.
   The ship, the Admiral Makarov, currently is 300 miles north of
Point Barrow, said Campbell Plowder of Greenpeace, quoting from a
teleprinter message received from the Soviet State Committee on
Hydrometeorology.
   The offer was made in the event the three gray whales still are
trapped by the gathering ice next Wednesday after the Soviet ship
completes its current missions of establishing a research station
on the ice and rescuing an ice-trapped Soviet ship.
   Plowder said that as a shot in the dark, he asked on Monday,
through scientific contacts in the Soviet Union, if any Soviet
icebreaker was in a position to help the whales. Friday's cable was
the answer.
   Plowder said he now has asked the State Department for immediate
clearance for the ship to enter U.S. waters and was told the
department would ``assess the technical aspects'' first.
   The State Department, meanwhile, said it has asked Soviet
authorities what assets they may have available to help free the
whales.
   The Soviets responded with information on where they have ice
breakers and how long it would take them to arrive at the scene,
said a State Department official who asked not to be identified.
   According to the official, U.S. authorities are evaluating the
Soviet information and are comparing it with other options for
rescuing the whales.

<TEXT>
   Waves of Israeli warplanes blasted
Palestinian and pro-Iranian guerrilla bases in south Lebanon on
Friday and killed 15 people to avenge seven Israeli soldiers who
died in a suicide car bombing.
   In Beirut, Shiite Moslem kidnappers holding at least two
American hostages threatened to punish their captives in
retaliation for the Israeli strikes.
   Police said 35 people were wounded in the half-hour Israeli
attacks, including civilians in a clinic. They said 12 Israeli
fighter-bombers and two helicopter gunships made seven bombing runs.
   The main targets of the attack were training bases and
ammunition dumps of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah and the Palestine
Liberation Organization near the port city of Sidon and the Bekaa
Valley town of Mashgara.
   Sidon, provincial capital of south Lebanon, is 25 miles south of
Beirut. Mashgara, which faces the forward lines of the Syrian army,
is 16 miles east of Sidon.
   The fundamentalist Shiite Moslem Hezbollah, or Party of God,
claimed responsibility for Wednesday's car bombing, which also
wounded eight Israeli soldiers and two Lebanese women.
   The air raids were Israel's 16th into Lebanon this year. A
police spokesman said on condition of anonymity that eight people
were killed and 15 wounded around Sidon and that seven were killed
and 20 wounded in Mashgara.
   The jets scored direct hits on a Hezbollah ammunition depot near
the Palestinian refugee camp of Mieh Mieh on the outskirts of Sidon
and set it ablaze, the spokesman said.
   Two of the rockets slammed into a Hezbollah clinic attached to
its main base in Mashgara, and two Lebanese physicians and three
nurses were injured, the spokesman said.
   ``Most of the wounded in Mashgara were civilians at the
clinic,'' he said.
   Wailing women beat their chests while workers pulled victims
from the rubble of Hezbollah's clinic. A child climbed on top of
the debris to plant the party's red, white and green flag.
   Ambulances with gunmen shooting into the air raced past, and
flames shot up from the smoking arms depot.
   Sheik Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah, Hezbollah's spiritual guide,
said the air raid targeted the clinic.
   ``Our mujahedeen (holy warriors) strike at soldiers and they
strike at civilians. ... Our arm is longer than Israel's,''
Fadlallah said in a sermon at a south Beirut mosque crowded with
Shiites.
   Hezbollah is an umbrella group for Shiite militants believed
holding most of the nine Americans and five other foreign hostages
in Lebanon.
   Friday's threat to the hostages came in typewritten statements
in Arabic signed by the Islamic Jihad, the faction holding
Associated Press Middle East correspondent Terry Anderson and
educator Thomas Sutherland.
   A statement delivered to a Western news agency included an
instant color photograph of Anderson in a beard and T-shirt.
   ``The criminal America must realize it will not get away with
what it has done, especially in connection with the hostages we
hold,'' the statement said.
   In Washington, State Department spokesman Charles Redman called
for an end to violence between Israel and Lebanon and urged
Lebanese kidnappers to free their hostages.
   The police spokesman said the warplanes fired 18 rockets into
two bases used by Hezbollah in Mashgara while the helicopters
strafed the town and its surroundings. He said Syrian troops were
not involved.
   Guerrilla defenders opened up with anti-aircraft fire as the
jets released scarlet balloons to deflect heat-seeking
surface-to-air missiles. No planes were hit, he said.
   The Israelis also hit two training bases run by PLO Chairman
Yasser Arafat's mainstream Fatah faction in Mieh Mieh and the
nearby camp of Ein el-Hilweh, he said.
   Fawzieh Mattar, 37, said she saw the first rocket slamming into
the depot near Sidon.
   ``The rocket shot straight through the gate. It caused a huge
explosion accompanied by a big ball of fire, and several explosions
followed,'' said Ms. Mattar, a Palestinian who lives at Mieh Mieh
with her parents.
   She said several refugees evacuated the camp after Wednesday's
car bombing in anticipation of Israeli retaliation, but her family
didn't have any place to go.
   Hiam Saleh, 18, said her father also refused to evacuate his
family of seven.
   ``We stayed in an air raid shelter in the camp, but occasionally
I came out to watch the planes attacking,'' Ms. Saleh said. ``Very
few civilians were wounded by shrapnel. Most of the casualties were
combatants manning the depot and Fatah base.''
   Israeli gunners in Israel's self-proclaimed security zone of
south Lebanon also hammered the town and the nearby village of
Luwayzeh with 155 mm howitzers.
   In Jerusalem, the military command said the raid was aimed at
``Palestinian targets in the Sidon area and Hezbollah command posts
in the villages of Mashgara and Luwayzeh.''
   Israeli officials often charge that Hezbollah and the PLO are
cooperating in guerrilla warfare against Israeli troops and allied
militiamen in south Lebanon.
   The Jewish state vowed to retaliate for Wednesday's bombing, the
deadliest attack against Israelis in south Lebanon in 2{ years. In
March 1985, a suicide driver detonated a car bomb, killing 12
Israelis and wounding 14.
   Israel pulled most of its army from south Lebanon in June 1985
after a three-year occupation and carved out the 6- to 10-mile
security zone to prevent guerrilla infiltration into its northern
settlements.
   Police say 26 people were killed and 108 wounded in the previous
Israeli air raids this year.

   Congress voted final approval Friday of a
memorial honoring women who served in Vietnam during the nation's
longest war.
   The measure, approved on voice votes and sent to President
Reagan, expresses the ``sense of Congress'' that the memorial be
built at the site of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, one of the
city's most popular memorials.
   But the legislation doesn't require the women's monument to be
built at that site.
   The measure which passed Friday was a compromise of earlier
bills, which has disagreed on whether the new monument should be at
the site of the Vietnam memorial. Critics said addition of another
statue would hurt the artistic integrity of the Vietnam memorial.
   The Vietnam Women's Memorial Project is proposing to honor women
with a statue of a nurse, representing the military nurses from
Vietnam.
   ``Recognition of the role of women during the Vietnam conflict
is long overdue,'' said Sen. David Durenberger, R-Minn., chief
sponsor of the Senate version.

<TEXT>
   Proposed amendments to the Soviet constitution
will concentrate power in the new presidency established by
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   But a summary of the amendments released Friday by the Tass news
agency said nothing about multiple candidates or multiple parties
in Soviet elections, which are controlled by the Communist Party.
   Earlier reports had indicated there could be a choice of
candidates in some electoral contests, but with all of the nominees
approved by the Communist Party.
   A draft of the amendments includes Gorbachev's proposal for a
limit of two five-year terms for every elected position. Gorbachev
was named president three weeks ago in an uncontested unanimous
vote by the Supreme Soviet, or parliament, and he is expected to
seek a second term.
   Under the proposals, the president will be elected by secret
ballot by the 2,250-member parliament that will meet just once a
year.
   The Tass summary reflected earlier reports and confirmed that
Gorbachev obtained the reforms he requested at the Communist Party
conference in June.
   It would give the president the power to head the defense
council, name the government's top officials and to sign laws.
   Gorbachev had requested the defense council chairmanship in his
speech at the party conference, but subsequent report made no
mention of that issue and there had been speculation it had been
dropped.
   Tass did not say if the president's authority to sign laws meant
he would have the veto power.
   Complete drafts of the constitutional and election reforms are
to be published in newspapers Saturday and Sunday.
   The official news media said the presidium of the Supreme Soviet
will review public opinion on the proposals until Nov. 25.
   No reason was given for the Nov. 25 date, but diplomats here
expect the parliament to hold a special session in November to
consider the amendments.

   The government and owners of a grounded
ship on Friday abandoned plans to sink the vessel and its cargo of
about 3,000 cars.
   The decison followed a protest by environmentalists claiming the
dumping would hurt marine life.
   The government said the plans were abandoned because bad weather
had damaged the 58,000-ton vessel, the Reijin, making it impossible
to float the ship far enough out to sea to dump the cars.
   ``Because of the weather, the Reijin's hull has fractured,''
Jose Macario Correia, secretary of state for the environment and
natural resources, told The Associated Press.
   ``The cars will probably be transported to the shore and
disposed of, and we are also looking into ways of dismantling the
ship totally to bring it to shore,'' he said.
   The announcement came after a group of environmentalists boarded
the ship early Friday and unfurled banners with message ``Not into
the sea!'' to protest the planned dumping.
   ``This is a victory for us,'' said Vitor Marques, spokesman for
the Portuguese environmentalist group Quercus. Earlier, marine
police detained three Quercus protesters after the police boarded
the ship to put out a small fire of unknown cause.
   The three were taken to the police court at Vila Nova de Gaia, a
suburb on the southern outskirts of Oporto, a police spokesman
said. He declined to say how long they would be detained.
   Marques earlier said the protesters would stay on the ship until
the Portuguese government took action to stop the dumping.
   The Panamanian-registered Reijin was on its maiden voyage from
Japan to Ireland when it ran aground April 27 off the northern city
of Oporto. It had stopped in Oporto to unload some of its cargo of
about 5,400 new Japanese cars. One sailor died in the accident.
   The ship's owner, Emerald Shipholding SA, a Japanese-owned,
Panamanian company, began dumping cars into the Atlantic Ocean in
September as part of a project to get rid of both the ship and its
cargo.
   Officials said the ship couldn't be recovered and the cars might
be unsafe for use after being stuck for six months so close to sea
water.
   Ecologists say the estimated total of 173 tons of copper and
lead, 115 tons of paint, 28 tons of oil and more than 1,000 tons of
rubber, plastics and textiles contained in the cars could also hurt
marine life.
   The navy issued a dumping permit August and installed observers
to ensure the cargo was sunk at least 40 miles from shore.
   Marques said the Greenpeace environmental group had sent an
official to give Quercus its support. The two groups issued a
statement Friday demanding that the Reijin be towed into a harbor
and that the cars be unloaded and disposed of on shore.

   Congress passed legislation on Friday ordering
the government to ban the sale of lawn darts, a game that is blamed
for the deaths of three children and injuries to thousands of
others.
   On a 304-51 vote, the House approved a bill ordering the
Consumer Product Safety Commission to prohibit sale of the darts
within 60 days unless it determines that the game cannot cause
puncture wounds. Hours later, the Senate approved it on a voice
vote and sent the legislation to President Reagan.
   The darts currently must carry warning labels stating that the
game is not for children. They also can be sold only in sporting
goods departments, and not in toy stores or toy departments.
   Last year, however, the Consumer Product Safety Commission said
that none of the 21 models of lawn darts complied with those
regulations.
   Three children have died from lawn dart injuries in the last
eight years and several have been blinded. An estimated 6,100
people have been treated for injuries from the game, of which 81
percent were children under age 15.
   The commission already is considering banning the darts.

<TEXT>
   Marion William Isbell, who founded
Ramada Inc. and built it into a 500-motel chain, has died at the
age of 83.
   Isbell died Thursday at Scottsdale Memorial Hospital-Osborn, the
same day that Ramada unveiled a restructuring plan that includes
selling off its hotel and restaurant businesses and focusing
instead on its more profitable gambling casinos.
   ``Marion Isbell was a pioneer in the hospitality industry and a
personal mentor to me, and a dynamic and caring man whose memory we
will cherish,'' Richard Snell, chairman and chief executive officer
of the Phoenix-based corporation, said in a statement.
   The company said the plan was devised partly in response to a
recent buyout offer from Chicago's Pritzker family, which controls
7.2 percent of Ramada's outstanding stock and is the company's
largest shareholder.
   Isbell conceived the idea of building comfortable roadside
hostelries during a cross-country trip with his wife in 1929 but it
was 25 years before his plan materialized.
   In 1954, Isbell and a group of Phoenix investors began buying
motels. In 1960 he decided to assemble the motels into a chain
owned by a publicly held company, and two years later became
chairman of a 63-motel chain known as Ramada Inns Inc.
   Under his leadership, Ramada Inns expanded to 500 motels in 45
states, and later into Canada, Mexico, Brazil and overseas.
   Born in Whitehaven, Tenn., in 1905, Isbell was orphaned before
he was 5. He and his brothers, James and Leon, were placed in an
orphanage in Memphis, Tenn., and later were raised by relatives.
   ``I was 8 years old when I first started work in the cotton
fields after school,'' he once said. He later worked as a
dishwasher, cook and soda jerk in Chicago before going into the
restaurant business there, where he ran a string of luncheonettes
before beginning his hotel business.
   Isbell ran the Ramada chain as president and chief executive
officer until 1973 and retired as chairman in 1979.
   He is survived by his wife, Ingrid; sons M. William and Robert
J.; daughter Elaine Cook; eleven grandchildren; and one
great-grandchild.
   Funeral services are scheduled for Saturday in Scottsdale.

<TEXT>
   A Greek cruise ship carrying 475 British
students and teachers collided with a freighter and sank near shore
Friday, officials reported. They said two Greek seamen were killed
and a 14-year-old girl was feared missing.
   Small boats picked up the high school students who jumped or
fell into the water from the Jupiter, a 6,300-ton cruise ship, as
it sank less than a mile from Piraeus harbor, said an official with
the Merchant Marine Ministry.
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said 64
people, including 30 students, were hospitalized with slight
injuries or for shock.
   A British Embassy official said that after a passenger count, a
14-year-old girl was the only person missing.
   He said officials were checking to see if ``she just got missed
in the count .... Some of the children are sleeping, some running
around in a state of post-shock excitement.'' He declined to give
the girl's name.
   Scores of teen-agers wrapped in blankets were crowded into the
coast guard headquarters at dockside in this port city. They later
were transferred to another cruise ship for the night.
   A spokesman for the Jupiter's owner, Epirotiki Lines, said the
Jupiter collided with the Adige, a container ship owned by the
Sicula Oceanica Spa of Palermo, Sicily.
   ``The Jupiter was coming out of harbor and had right of way but
the Adige came in at considerable speed and hit it amidships on the
lefthand side,'' said the spokesman, Spyros Mavrikis.
   A statement issued by Italian merchant marine officials said a
Greek pilot was aboard the Adige at the time of the collision. It
said there were no victims on the Italian vessel.
   Merchant Marine Minister Evangelos Yannopoulos issued a
statement saying the skipper of the Italian freighter, Capt. Flavio
Caminale, was being held on manslaughter charges.
   The ministry identified the dead seaman as Vassilis Psomas and
Athanasios Golemotis, both members of the Jupiter's 120-member crew.
   The Jupiter was headed for the Greek islands, Egypt, Israel and
Turkey on an 8-day voyage organized by Schools Abroad that is based
at Havering in the county of Essex, southern England.
   A total of 415 students, aged 12-16 from 30 different schools,
were on the cruise accompanied by 60 adults.
   The accident occurred as the passengers gathered for a meal in
the dining room.
   ``The lights went out and the ship went off to one side,'' said
Stephanie Stavrou, 16, from Romford, England. ``The girls were
screaming and crying and we couldn't see anything properly. It was
very frightening.''
   Fishing boats, tugs and coast guard launches raced to pluck the
youngsters from the oily water, filled with debris from the ship.
   Dozens of panicked passengers leaped overboard as the ship
started to sink.
   ``I jumped into the sea and swam for a rescue boat, but it went
away and I had to make for another,'' said a weeping, oil-spattered
14-year-old who refused to give her name.
   A crewmember from the Jupiter said others were swept overboard
by swells when the ship sank.
   ``They went down and popped up again after swallowing the dirty
water .... that's why so many people are in shock,'' said the
crewman, Pantelis Bougoyannis.
   The collision was the third fatal maritime incident near Piraeus
in the past four months.
   On July 11, Arab terrorists mounted a gun-and-grenade attack
aboard a Greek cruise ship, the City of Poros, as it returned from
a one-day island-hopping cruise. Nine people were killed and more
than 80 wounded.
   On Sept. 6, an explosion aboard a Greek oil tanker undergoing
repairs at a shipyard near Piraeus killed four workers and injured
another 16. The blast was caused by gas fumes igniting in a fuel
tank, possibly by a spark from a welder's torch.

   President Augusto Pinochet replaced half
of his 16-member Cabinet on Friday and indicated he will not run in
an open election for the presidency next year.
   Both actions were seen as a response to Pinonchet's defeat in an
Oct. 5 referendum. In that election, voters rejected the proposal
that Gen. Pinochet, also army commander, remain in the presidency
until 1997. Pinochet was the only candidate in the presidential
referendum.
   He has ruled Chile since September 1973, when he led the coup
that ousted the elected government of Marxist President Salvador
Allende. He died in the coup.
   ``I will hand over my post to the person that citizens elect
freely, secretly and in an informed fashion on Dec. 14, 1989,''
Pinochet said in a speech at the swearing-in ceremony for the new
ministers.
   It was the first time he had addressed the issue of whether he
would be a candidate in the balloting next year. However, he did
not elaborate.
   Pinochet named eight new Cabinet members, all civilians, and
shifted one minister to another post. The seven other ministers,
including some military officers, remained in their jobs.
   The most important change was the naming of Carlos Caceres, a
48-year-old technocrat, to replace Sergio Fernandez as interior
minister, the post with the most political power.
   Opposition leaders have called for the removal of Fernandez, who
had rejected appeals for negotiations on democratic reforms of the
8-year-old constitution drawn up by Pinochet's military government.
Pinochet had also rejected such changes.
   But Pinochet said he was not surrendering to the opposition's
demands. ``Sirs, the constitution will not be modified,'' he said.
``This issue is not at stake.''
   He named Hernan Errazuriz, who once served as ambassador to the
United States, as foreign minister, replacing Ricardo Garcia.
Miguel Poduje was moved from the housing ministry to replace
Orlando Poblete as government secretary-general, a post equivalent
to a chief of staff.
   Pinochet was reported to be furious with some Cabinet members,
including Fernandez and Poblete, accusing them of ``tricking'' him
into believing he would win the referendum.
   Pinochet, 72, lost the referendum by a vote of 3.9 million to
3.1 million, but under the constitution he will continue as head of
state until March 1990 when the winner of the l989 election will
take office.
   There had been speculation that Pinochet might run in the open
election. In any case, political observers expect him, as the army
commander, to have a strong voice in the naming the government's
candidate.
   Other new ministers are Jaime de la Sota in agriculture; Armando
Alvarez, national property; Guillermo Arthur, labor; Pablo
Barahona, mining; Gustavo Montero, housing, and Carlos Silva,
transportation.
   Remaining in the Cabinet are retired Adm. Patricio Carvajal,
defense; Hernan Buchi, finance; Gen. Manuel Concha, economy; Juan
Antonio Guzman, education; Hugo Rosende, justice; Gen. Bruno
Siebert, public works; and Juan Giaconi, health.
   It was the 40th Cabinet named by Pinochet since 1973.
   Fernandez and Poblete oversaw Pinochet's campaign in the
Octaober referendum.
   Poblete was accused of altering the results of
government-contracted polls two days before the election to give
the impression Pinochet was leading.
   After the vote, Fernandez said in a nationally broadcast address
that the results were positive for Pinochet. He said the ``yes''
votes showed Pinochet was Chile's principal political leader.
   But most right-wing political leaders who had backed Pinochet
quickly withdrew their support.
   Caceres, who received a masters' degree in business
administration from Cornell University and was a visiting professor
at Ohio State University, is considered more moderate than
Fernandez. He had served as finance minister under Pinochet in the
early 1980s.
   Jorge Burgos, assistant secretary-general of the opposition
Christian Democratic Party, said ``a change of names doesn't tell
us much. The important thing is to see what the new men will
actually do.''
   The Christian Democrats, Chile's largest party, led a 16-party
coalition that campaigned for Pinochet's defeat in the referendum.

<HEAD>Marcos Lawyer: Plea Bargain Was ``Drop Dead'' Deal</HEAD>
<HEAD>With US-Marcos, Bjt</HEAD>

<DATELINE>HONOLULU (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. government refused to negotiate with
former Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos, offering him a
``drop-dead deal'' that forced his indictment on racketeering
charges, Marcos' lawyer said Friday.
   ``This was not a plea bargain ... it was a set of non-negotiable
demands,'' Richard Hibey, Marcos' Washington-based attorney, said
at a news conference.
   Marcos and his wife, Imelda, were indicted on federal
racketeering charges Friday for allegedly looting more than $100
million from their homeland to buy art and real estate in Manhattan.
   They also were charged with defrauding three lending
institutions of more than $165 million in the purchase and
financing of the real estate.
   The Marcoses would plead innocent when arraigned Oct. 31, Hibey
said.
   ``They vigorously will defend the charges that have been laid
against them in this case,'' he said. ``The charges are false.''
   Neither Ferdinand nor Imelda Marcos spoke to reporters after the
indictments were handed down in New York City, and Hibey said they
were not expected to comment until after their arraignment.
   Hibey said Marcos had been given until Thursday to accept or
reject a deal which would have required him and his wife to plead
guilty to felony racketeering charges and testify against others _
including family members _ with no assurances they would not be
jailed, Hibey said.
   The U.S. government knew Marcos would reject the ``drop-dead
deal,'' Hibey said, adding that Marcos attorneys were still willing
to negotiate. ``A global settlement is not out of the question as
far as we're concerned,'' he said.
   Hibey refused to detail what settlement Marcos offered the U.S.
government, but said money was never discussed. ``We offered to
enter into meaningful negotiations with the United States and the
Philippines,'' he said.
   He also refused to outline Marcos' defense, but said the former
president's health and jurisdiction issues would figure prominently.
   ``I am personally concerned ... that he may not be physically
able to withstand the rigors of a criminal trial of this scope and
magnitude,'' said Hibey, who described the 71-year-old Marcos as
``frail.''
   ``The issue of his health is definitely going to permeate this
case,'' he said. In the 2{ years Marcos has lived in Hawaii, he has
been treated for a variety of illnesses, including chest pains and
an eye ailment.
   The United States recently renegotiated base agreements for U.S.
installations in the Philippines, paying far less than the
Philippine government first demanded.
   Hibey said those negotiations were tied to a U.S. promise to
indict Marcos and criticized the government of Philippine President
Corazon Aquino for deferring to the United States.
   ``The coincidence ... is too strong to ignore,'' he said. ``The
people of the Philippines, if not of the United States, know this
is part of a political vendetta against the Marcoses.''
   ``Hogwash,'' said Tomas Gomez, the Philippine Consul in
Honolulu, of Hibey's allegation. ``Mr. Hibey's comparing apples in
oranges. ``Mr. Marcos will face criminal indictments in the
Philippines eventually. The long road to retribution and
restitution has begun.''
   Asked whether Marcos felt betrayed by President Reagan, who
refused to intervene in the case, Hibey said, ``I can't speak for
Mr. Marcos, but the president was responsible for having him
brought to the United States.''
   Marcos fled to Hawaii in February 1986 after a civilian-military
revolt catapulted Philippine President Corazon Aquino to power.
Marcos has maintained since that he was tricked by U.S. officials
who told him he would be taken to his home province of Ilocos Norte.
   Marcos spokesman Arturo Aruiza said the Marcoses reacted calmly
to the indictments.
   ``He's been up since early this morning, reading his law
books,'' Aruiza said. ``Mrs. Marcos is a little bit upset, but
she's been expecting this.''

   A severe storm struck the Bay of Bengal
along the coast of Bangladesh, and news reports Friday said at
least 400 fishermen were missing and presumed drowned.
   The reports said the storm had 75-mph winds that piled up
15-foot waves when it hit Wednesday.
   Police reported more than 1,000 people were injured as the storm
destroyed thousands of mud-and-straw huts beside the bay.
   Officials at the coastal cities of Cox's Bazar and Patuakhali
said in a telephone interview that the bodies of 11 fishermen were
recovered Friday.
   They said 40 fishing trawlers were swept ashore but there was no
one aboard any of the vessels. A trawler typically carries a crew
of 10.

   Rain fell over much of the eastern United States on Friday, and
snow was reported in West Virginia.
   A storm system over the central Appalachian Mountains also
brought rain over the lower Great Lakes and the eastern parts of
the Ohio Valley. Colder air across the mountain areas changed the
rain to wet snow Friday morning.
   A snow advisory posted for southeastern West Virginia called for
accumlations of between 2 and 4 inches. The storm was to intensify
overnight and bring heavy rain to much of New England by Saturday.
   The rest of the nation, from the Mississippi Valley to the
Pacific coast, had pleasant weather Friday afternoon, with showers
and a few thunderstorms were developing over the Rio Grande Valley
of Texas.
   Temperatures around the nation Friday ranged from 35 degrees at
Louisburg, W.Va., to 91 degrees at Palm Springs, Calif. The
nation's low Friday morning was 12 degrees at Gunnison, Colo.
   The forecast for Saturday called for a low pressure system to
move slowly northward along the mid-Atlantic coast, bringing
widespread rain. Rainy and windy weather also was likely throughout
central and northern New England.
   A low in the atmosphere was to weaken over northwest mexico and
bring scattered rainshowers and a few thunderstorms over extreme
parts of the southern Rocky Moutains through the Rio Grande Valley
of Texas.
   Winds are to gust at times across the northern Rockies in the
wake of a cold front sweeping across the Northern Plains.
   Highs were to reach the 60s or 70s across much of the nation.
The highs in the Upper Mississippi Valley through the Great Lakes
and New England were to reach the 40s and 50s.
   High temperatures in the 80s were expected from the central high
plains through central Texas into the western Gulf Coast and across
the southern half of Florida. Highs were to reach the mid-90s
across the desert Southwest.

   The Senate voted Friday to end Calvin Graham's
painful and prideful struggle to be compensated for his World War
II service, agreeing to give him benefits the Navy said he did not
deserve because he lied about his age and enlisted at age 12.
   The bill awarding Graham back pay and disability benefits was
passed during the waning hours of the 100th Congress, and now goes
to President Reagan for his signature.
   ``It gives me a lot of pride back that I lost a long time ago,''
Graham said minutes after the legislation was approved. ``I've been
sitting here hanging by a string. I didn't know if they were going
to get to it before they quit. It's been 46 years. I'm just
thankful.''
   Under the legislation, Graham would get his 1943 mustering-out
benefits of $337 in 1988 dollars plus interest, for a total of
$4,917, as well as $18,000 for a mouth injury suffered on the deck
of the USS South Dakota during the battle of Guadalcanal.
   The military denied Graham his mustering-out benefits and gave
him disability for losing one tooth, although the Fort Worth man
says he has lost all of his teeth because of the shrapnel injury.
   ``Our legislation grants him the veterans' benefits he
deserves,'' said Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, a Texas Democrat. ``Calvin
Graham, at a very young age, made a great contribution to our
country, and I'm glad to see our country making this commitment to
him.''
   ``I'm happy that the Senate has taken this action to provide
Calvin Graham the compensation and benefits he deserves for his
service to our country during World War II _ at a time when he was
just 12 years old,'' said Bentsen, Senate sponsor of the bill.
   The bill was sponsored in the House by Rep. Martin Frost, a
Dallas Democrat. House Speaker Jim Wright, Graham's congressman,
testified in his behalf at a House hearing.
   Graham, who was discharged from the Navy in 1943 after officials
learned of his true age, was finally granted an honorable discharge
in 1978 and his medals were restored. But he has been ineligible
for full service-connected disability benefits, Bentsen said.
   His story was the topic of a CBS television movie, ``Too Young
the Hero.''

<HEAD>Nevada Politican Avoiding Arrest in Ecuador</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Former Lt. Gov. Clifford A. Jones of
Nevada has gone into hiding here to avoid arrest in connection with
a lawsuit brought by an ex-associate in city casino operations, his
attorney said Friday.
   Gil Vela, Jones' attorney, said Ecuadorean authorities tried to
arrest the 76-year-old Las Vegas lawyer and two-time Nevada
lieutenant governor on Oct. 11 but could not find him.
   ``Mr. Jones is avoiding being detained until the formal order of
detention is revoked,'' Vela told The Associated Press in a
telephone interview.
   He said the order stems from a countersuit, which alleges Jones
committed perjury during an earlier Quito stock fraud case.
   In the earlier case, Vela said Jones sued Ecuadorean Douglas
Albuja and others associates, accusing them of seizing his stock in
Catursa, a local casino and tourism company.
   Vela did not give the names or the numbers of others involved in
the Catursa suit nor when it occurred. He said Jones held 50
percent of the stock in the company, which owned the casinos at the
Hotel Quito, Hotel Colon and Hotel Alameda.
   Albuja countersued in 1987, accusing Jones of perjury in the
Catursa case, Vela said.
   A judge ordered Jones detained in March, but he entered Ecuador
a few months ago unaware of the court order, Vela said.
   ``My counsel has been that he should not circulate freely
because the arrest order still exists. We are trying to get it
dropped,'' Vela said.
   Vela said that next week the judge is likely to either drop the
case against Jones and revoke the detention order or call for the
case to go to a full trial.

   Lloyd Bentsen pulled on his blue jeans and
cowboy boots and rode on a hay wagon Friday as he tried to convince
Texans that Michael Dukakis is not soft on crime and anti-defense.
   ``The Republicans have preferred diatribe to dialogue ... they
mass market innuendo and camouflage the fact'' about Dukakis, he
said.
   The Texas senator said Democrats would spend just as much on
defense as the Republicans _ but they would crack down on the
kickbacks to contractors, and focus more on convention weapons than
nuclear missiles.
   ``I wouldn't be running on a ticket with a candidate who would
weaken America's defense,'' the Democratic vice presidential
nominee said at a barbecue for 600 people.
   The Republican ads attacking Dukakis on crime by highlighting
the Massachusetts prison furlough program were ``slander,'' he
said, and ignored the fact that Dukakis toughened a program he
inherited from the previous Republican governor. ``As it turns out,
the Massachusetts furlough is tougher than that in Texas,'' he said.
   The Republican assertion that Dukakis wants to take away
everyone's guns was ``crazy,'' he said. ``The truth is that Mike
Dukakis supports the right of Americans to own guns to protect
themselves, their homes, their business, he supports the right of
Americans to own guns for hunting,'' he said.
   Friday evening in Houston, he told a local meeting of the NAACP
that for Republican vice presidential nominee Dan Quayle, ``civil
rights does not rank high on his list of priorities.'' He cited
Quayle's votes against South Africa sanctions, against the 1988
civil rights restoration act, support for the Supreme Court
nomination of Robert Bork, and opposition to affirmative action.
   ``And let's also remember that George Bush can run from the
facts, but he can't hide from the truth,'' Bentsen said. ``After
all, he was vice president of the United States while this
administration was was waging its onslaught and trying to turn back
the tide of progress on civil rights,''
   ``I am not aware of any occasion when when the vice president
questioned or disagreed with the administration policies on civil
rights,'' he said.
   ``I can't recall a time when he stood up for what is right and
just in America,'' he said.
   ``They see no problems and offer no answers. In George Bush's
America, if you haven't made it, forget it,'' he said.
   At the barbecue in Abeline, Bentsen's speech was made from
behind a lectern with the initials ``LB'' burned into the front. A
pair of covered wagons were in the background and a band called
``Ray Peck and the Half Breeds'' provided entertainment, including
a song dedicated to the Democratic ticket.
   Usually seen in his Washington suits, Bentsen wore black cowboy
boots, blue jeans and a plaid shirt and string tie for the event.
He said was comfortable.
   Earlier, when he was still in his suit, Bentse told nursing
students Friday that the Democratic ticket stood for the programs
needed by working women, including pay equity, day care, an
increased minimum wage, and the Equal Rights amendment.
   ``We're with you. We're the party of progress for the working
women of America,'' said Bentsen.
   He accused the Republicans of trying to cut back on prenatal
care and health care for children, and he ridiculed the GOP
objection to federal standards for day care.
   ``We have stronger federal standards on dog food than we have on
day care protection for our children,'' he said.
   While the Reagan administration has opposed an increase in the
minimum wage and George Bush has waffled on the issue, he said,
``seven out of eight jobs filled by women since 1980 have been
paying at the poverty level.''
   ``We won't rest until American women have equal access to
opportunity and a fair share of the American dream,'' he said,
getting loud applause from the mostly-female audience at the San
Antonio Health Science Center.
   Democrats have in recent years been more popular with women than
the Republicans, a phenomenon known as the ``gender gap.'' But
recent polls have shown the gap has closed.
   Bentsen's press secretary, Mike McCurry, said the speech today
was aimed particularly at women in Texas. The campaign has found
that much of the deterioration in the ticket's standing in the
state, were it now trails in the polls, has been with young working
women, he said.

   A federal judge Friday held the state in
contempt of court for overcrowding in a section of the state prison
and threatened fines of $50 per extra inmate per day.
   ``This court has finally, regretfully, reached the end of its
Job-like patience'' with overcrowding at the Intake Service Center
of the Adult Correctional Institution, U.S. District Judge Raymond
J. Pettine wrote.
   Pettine said if the population at the intake unit in Cranston
exceeds 250 after Feb. 20, he will levy the fines. He gave the
state until Nov. 21 to come up with a new plan for reducing the
inmate population at the center, which holds prisoners awaiting
trail.
   As of Friday morning, the intake unit's population was 431
inmates, said Corrections Department spokesmen Joseph A. DiNitto.
At that level the daily fine would be $9,050.
   ``I can't foresee there's any possibility of meeting that
deadline since we've been at 450 in there in recent days,'' said
state Corrections Director John J. Moran.
   Inmates, with the help of the American Civil Liberties Union,
sued in 1977 to correct numerous problems they contended existed at
the prison.
   John Biafore, assistant legal counsel to Gov. Edward D. DiPrete,
blamed the overcrowding on more drug-related arrests and
legislation making bail harder to obtain. Biafore said the
governor's aides had met with judges to speed procedures for
releasing those eligible for bail.
   ``It was working, but no one can explain why over the last three
to four months there's been such a great amount of drug arrests,''
he said.

<HEAD>Avril Gives First Address, Pledges Democracy But Introduces No New
Policy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL NORTON</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ President Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril
said Friday that his military government would build the
foundations of democracy, but he said local elections should be
held before Haitians choose a new leader.
   The speech was the first by Avril since he assumed power a month
ago after a military coup ousted Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy.
   But the long-awaited address, broadcast live on state television
and radio, lasted only 10 minutes and announced no new government
policy. There was speculation before the speech that changes would
be announced.
   Avril said he would propose that an independent electoral
council be established in the next few days to prepare for county,
municipal and legislative elections ``to open the way for
presidential elections in a serene atmosphere.'' He gave no date
for the elections.
   Opposition leaders have been pushing for quick presidential
elections and a return to civilian rule.
   Avril also said,``The national interest demands that an end be
put to the violence and agitation which threaten national
stability.''
   Earlier Friday, about 2,000 demonstrators marched from the
charred ruins of a slum church to protest a church order to expel
an activist priest and called on the government to carry out army
reforms.
   It was the second week of protests against a decision by the
Roman Catholic Church's Salesian Order to force the Rev. Jean
Bertrand Aristide, Haiti's most popular priest, to leave the
country.
   The demonstrators waved banners hailing Aristide as a prophet
and asked Avril to put into effect promised reforms, including
bringing to justice any remaining Tonton Macoutes, the hated secret
police which served the Duvalier regime for 29 years.
   That regime ended when Jean-Claude ``Baby Doc'' Duvalier, son of
Francois ``Papa Doc'' Duvalier, was swept from power in a popular
uprising and fled to France in Feb. 1986. His father ruled from
1957.
   A massacre at Aristide's St. Jean Bosco church on Sept. 11 was
cited by soldiers as a reason for overthrowing Namphy. Thugs
stormed the church during Mass, killed 12 people, wounded more than
70 others and burned down the church.
   Aristide's superiors in Rome had ordered him to leave Haiti by
Oct. 17. Friends of the priest said he was still in Haiti Friday.

<HEAD>Study Finds Link Between Cancer and High Iron Levels</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iron pills may be unhealthy for people who don't
have anemia because of the possibility that excessive iron
increases the risk of cancer, a new study concludes.
   Too little iron is clearly hazardous, but the latest research
suggests that too much may also be bad. The study, based on a large
population survey, found links between high body levels of iron and
cancer of the colon, lungs, bladder and esophagus in men.
   ``Iron supplementation for those who are not amenic may be
unwise,'' the study concluded.
   Despite the statistical association, however, this research does
not actually prove that iron promotes cancer or that too much iron
in the diet is dangerous.
   Because the link is tentative, the study's chief author, Dr.
Richard G. Stevens, was reluctant to make specific health
recommendations. But he said, ``If it's true, it might be wise to
reconsider the iron supplementation of foods in our grocery
stores.''
   He cautioned that people with iron deficiency should continue to
take iron supplements. More study will be necessary to prove
whether high iron levels, and especially iron-rich food, increase
the risk of cancer.
   Stevens, an epidemiologist at Batelle, Pacific Northwest
Laboratories in Richland, Wash., conducted the study with doctors
from the National Cancer Institute. It was published in Thursday's
New England Journal of Medicine.
   His conclusions were based on blood samples taken from more than
14,000 people over the past two decades in the National Health and
Nutrition Survey.
   The latest study found that the overall cancer risk was 37
percent higher in men with high iron levels than in those with low
levels.
   In earlier research, Dr. Joseph Selby of Kaiser Hospital in
Oakland, Calif., found a similar association during a study of
45,000 people in northern California.
   ``There is a good deal of biological plausability to the
hypothesis'' that too much iron causes cancer, Selby said. ``On the
other hand, all of the evidence in humans to date is both very weak
and very indirect and about as far from conclusive as you can get.''
   Steven's study did not find any association between cancer and
iron levels in women, but the researchers could not rule out that
such a link exists.
   However, Selby said, ``If this (association) turns out to be
true, women who are premenopausal have little or nothing to worry
about, since most of them have little iron stores. Most are close
to iron deficiency because they lose iron each month through
menstruation.''
   Stevens said his study should not be used for recommendations
about what people should eat. In fact, he said that food could turn
out to have little effect on iron storage, because iron levels may
be largely under the control of the body's built-in regulators.
   Dr. Katherine McGlynn of the Fox Chase Cancer Center in
Philadelphia is organizing a study to see if giving blood, which
lowers iron levels, protects people against cancer.
   ``People have long studied the consequences of iron
deficiency,'' she said. ``It's only recently that people have
studied iron overloading and raised the possibility that we have
gone overboard in fortifying all the food in sight.''
   Stevens' study was based on blood levels of a protein called
transferrin, which picks up iron in the small intestines and
transports it throughout the body. Levels of this protein are
thought to mirror the amount of iron stored in the body.
   Experts theorize that too much iron may contribute to cancer by
promoting oxidation that damages the genes and by providing a
nutrient that cancerous cells need to grow.

   Gov. Edward DiPrete's policy director
has resigned amid a storm of controversy over the hiring and firing
of the ex-wife of a reputed mobster from a state job.
   Ronald DiOrio announced his resignation Thursday night, hours
after Francesca Coats went public with complaints about the way she
was dismissed from a job on the Governor's Justice Commission that
she held for two days. She also charged that DiOrio promised her
another job if she avoided speaking to the media.
   On Friday, the governor said he was aware when he hired Ronald
DiOrio as his policy director that DiOrio's brother also had
alleged mob ties.
   DiPrete told reporters that he hired DiOrio anyway because
DiOrio, a former teachers union leader, had a record of being
independent of his brother, Richard ``Moon'' DiOrio.
   The controversy comes at an awkward time for DiPrete, who is
running for re-election against a stiff challenge by Democrat Bruce
G. Sundlun. Polls show Sundlun, who lost to DiPrete by a 2-1 margin
in 1986, has pulled even in the race.
   Ms. Coats was divorced in 1986 from Nicholas L. Bianco, who has
been identified by law enforcement officials as a powerful member
of the New England organized crime family headed by the late
Raymond L.S. Patriarca.
   Ms. Coats, at a news conference and in subsequent interviews,
charged DiOrio knew about her background when she was hired May 25
to coordinate an interagency task force for the justice commission.
She said he did not object to her hiring until newspaper articles
this week raised questions about it. Ms. Coats began work for the
commission Monday.
   DiOrio and his top aide, William McCann, said they were not
aware of Ms. Coats' background until Tuesday, when McCann told her
she was fired.
   Ms. Coats, however, said DiOrio personally fired her Wednesday
in a meeting with her and her lawyer, William A. Dimitri Jr., at
which he told her, ``If I would take steps to avoid the media and
allow them to handle the situation the way they chose, that on Nov.
9 I would be taen care of.''
   DiOrio told The Providence Journal he offered to help Ms. Coats
find another job after the busy election season ended but that she
misunderstood his offer.
   Attempts to reach DiOrio for further comment Friday were
unsuccessful. He did not return telephone messages left at his home
or his former office or with DiPrete's press secretary.
   Richard DiOrio testified during 1986 hearings on the impeachment
of state Chief Justice Joseph Bevilacqua, who allegedly had
associated with organized crime figures.
   DiPrete said Ronald DiOrio had discussed his brother when he
became policy director in October 1985.
   ``I was absolutely convinced that there would be no influence or
connection in any way. I knew of the situation; he explained it to
me. He wanted to let me know that would have no bearing on his
personal relationship or professional relationship or anything to
do with state government, and history has shown that to be true,''
DiPrete said.
   Ms. Coats and DiOrio agreed that she was initially offered two
jobs, one with the justice commission and the other coordinating an
anti-drug project called the Teen Institute. She took the justice
commission position after the director of the agency running the
Teen Institute decided to hire someone else.
   DiPrete, in a statement issued Thursday night, said Ms. Coats
``does not in my judgment have the background and qualifications
necessary'' for the justice commission job.
   Sundlun, seeking to make political hay from the controversy,
said Friday he would give Ms. Coats a job if elected governor.
   ``There is no evidence that Mrs. Coats is herself an unfit
person or an unfit member of society,'' Sundlun replied. ``The
reason they fired Mrs. Coats was they felt the embarrassment that
her former husband had been a reputed mobster.''
   Ms. Coats said she will fight to be reinstated and is
considering a lawsuit. She said other potential employers had
clearly told her they would not hire her because of her marriage to
Bianco.
   ``If I was hired for a job that I am capable of doing ... then
why was I all of a sudden not qualified,'' she said in a telephone
interview. ``I want a job. I'm not looking for anyone to do me any
favors. I just want to earn a living.''
   Earlier this summer, news reports accused DiOrio of putting
pressure on the state Department of Environmental Management to
approve wetlands permits for development projects involving the
governor's son Dennis.
   DiOrio was not, however, directly involved in the land deal that
netted a $2 million profit for a DiPrete family business.

   Four Belgian leftists were sentenced
Friday to life in prison for a 14-month terror spree that included
28 bombings and left two people dead.
   Only one of the four members of the ultra-leftist Fighting
Communist Cells was in the court to hear the sentence. Three others
_ two men and a woman _ were too weak to leave their prison after
weeks on a hunger strike.
   A jury took more than 13 hours to reach a verdict, and
three-and-a-half more to agree on the penalties, ending a four-week
trial that was held amid unprecedented security measures.
   The four _ Pierre Carette, 36; Didier Chevolet, 32; Pascale
Vandegeerde, 30; and Bertrand Sassoye, 25 _ refused to cooperate at
the trial and held a hunger strike.
   They faced more than 300 charges, including the murder of two
firemen in a May 1985 blast at the Brussels building of the Belgian
Employers federation. The group, headed by Carette, carried out 21
bomb attacks between Oct. 2, 1984, and Dec. 6, 1985, in which 28
bombs were set off. In the most dramatic attack on Dec. 11, 1984,
bombs damaged a NATO fuel pipeline at six rural Belgian locations.

   Authorities have banned city
demonstrations on Sunday that would commemorate the 1956
anti-Communist revolt, an official report said.
   Several independent groups had notified police about plans to
hold a memorial procession in commemoration of the uprising, the
MTI news agency said.
   ``Budapest police headquarters state they will not permit any
public street meeting, procession or demonstration, and will take
the necessary measures to prevent occurrences that run counter to
the (Hungarian) constitution and violate public order,'' MTI said.
   In 1956, popular demands for the ousting of Communist Party
Secretary Erno Gero and for formation of a government by Imre Nagy
led to Nagy's appointment on Oct. 23.
   As demonstrations against Communist rule developed into open
revolt, Gero called in Soviet forces, who crushed the revolt in
November. Nagy was tried and executed in 1958.

   The nation's airlines are being told to
examine the takeoff warning horns on two of the industry's most
widely used jetliners after faulty alarms were found in 35 of the
aircraft.
   The inspections on nearly 1,800 Boeing 727s and 737s, which were
ordered Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration, comes as
federal accident investigators continue to try to determine whether
an alarm may have failed on a Delta Air Lines Boeing 727 that
crashed last August at the Dallas-Fort Worth airport.
   The alarm is designed to sound if a pilot has forgotten to
prepare an aircraft properly for takeoff, such as leaving wing
flaps, which help give a plane lift, in the wrong position.
   The National Transportation Safety Board has said there is
evidence, though not conclusively determined, that the flaps may
not have been in the proper position on the Delta jet, yet a
cockpit voice recorder tape shows the alarm did not sound. The NTSB
investigation into the crash, which killed 14 people, is not yet
completed.

   With little more than two weeks to go in a
presidential campaign marked by a made-for-TV mentality, Michael
Dukakis is fighting back with a television blitz of his own, hoping
that a foray into America's living rooms will revive his candidacy.
   The Democratic nominee is making himself available to network
and major-market television outlets and also plans to buy TV time
for direct appeals to voters, a costly venture that is drawing
mixed reviews from political analysts.
   ``It may be too little too late, but it's certainly better than
doing nothing,'' said Mark Siegel, a Democratic consultant. ``There
is still a large segment of the population that is undecided and
another segment that is recently decided and could be persuaded to
change their mind. This election is not over.''
   Republicans, not surprisingly, disagree.
   ``My guess is that people are not going to sit down and watch
this stuff,'' said GOP consultant Eddie Mahe. ``They have made
their decision.''

   Rescuers frustrated by a delayed

   ``A large, wide lead has opened four miles from the whales.
That's the closest open water there's been yet,'' Ron Morris of the
National Marine Fisheries Service said Thursday. ``I just want to

   Weather forecasts indicated that favorable winds would shift
over the weekend, probably shutting the pathways through the ice,
Morris said.
   Officials said they planned to have a giant Alaska Army National

from the construction of the trans-Alaska oil pipeline _ at first
light today. The trip was expected to take about two hours.

   Small parties, especially those

right-wing Likud bloc or the leftist Labor Party is the big winner
in Israel's Nov. 1 elections.
   The race is expected to be close, with the winner being the
major party that woos the most small parties into a coalition after
the balloting is over.
   There are 25 small parties, and pollsters predict they will
garner up to 40 percent of the votes cast and an unprecedented
number of seats in the 120-member Knesset, or parliament.
   The most sought after are the religious parties.
   Jews who vote primarily on the basis of religious questions make
up 10 percent of the 2.9 million eligible voters. Five religious
parties won 13 seats in 1984, and seven parties are contending this
time.

   Critics are denouncing the government's proposal
to scrap a crime suspect's right to remain silent, a legal maneuver
aimed at battling the IRA and other Northern Ireland guerrilla
groups.
   ``The government will not defeat terrorism by taking away one of
the few remaining safeguards in Northern Ireland's justice
system,'' said Sarah Spencer, general secretary of Britain's
National Council for Civil Liberties:
   The plan to remove the centuries-old right to silence was
announced Thursday in the House of Commons by Northern Ireland
Secretary Tom King, the Cabinet member responsible for the province.
   The government of the Republic of Ireland said in a statement
that it was worried at the implications of the move to end the
right to silence for the administration of justice in Northern
Ireland.
   Paddy McManus, legal affairs spokesman for the IRA's legal
political party Sinn Fein, said King's announcement moved Britain
closer into line with South Africa and Chile, both widely condemned
for human rights abuses.
   The government also hinted Thursday that it may make candidates
for elections in the province take an oath renouncing violence.

   Few regulations exist to prevent a preschool
child's frolic on playground equipment from turning into a
potentially fatal fall, even though many such hazards could be
avoided, federal health officials say.
   The Centers for Disease Control said Thursday that workers at
construction sites are protected by more safety precautions than
children under 4 years of age on playgrounds.
   A child could suffer severe head injuries or die if he fell
headfirst onto a concrete or asphalt surface from a height of one
foot or onto packed earth from four feet, the CDC said in its
weekly report.
   ``If you can crack your skull from a fall from one foot off the

his behavior, we're just saying make the environment more

   A comet striking Earth with the power of 300
million Hiroshima-sized atomic bombs may be the cause of mass
extinction 11 million years ago, say scientists who blame a bigger
blast for killing the dinosaurs eons earlier.
   The scientists' new study means that of nine mass extinction
episodes in Earth's history, three that occurred about 11 million,
38 million and 66 million years ago now have been linked to comets
or asteroids smacking into the planet.
   The highly controversial theory says such impacts kicked up dust
and triggered smoky fires that blocked enough sunlight to freeze
many creatures and deprive others of food supplies.
   Other new studies bolster support for rival theories that blame
mass extinctions on gigantic volcanic eruptions, on changes in sea
level or on global climate changes unrelated to objects smashing
into Earth.

   Roy Benjamin has a great idea for
companies seeking ways to establish themselves in the great Chinese
consumer market of the future. Give them books, he says.
   Benjamin already has spoken to officials of the Chinese
Publishers Association, who assured him that each title would get
at least 20 readings, since each book would be loaned to the reader
and then redistributed.
   ``Multiply a few million books by 20 exposures per book and you
see the impact the program would have,'' says Benjamin, who knows
what he's talking about. His company, based in this New York
suburb, pioneered the sponsored book concept.
   ``Sponsors are not altogether altruistic,'' he explains. ``Their
names, logos or messages would appear on the back covers of the
paperback books being distributed.'' The resulting good will, he
says, would be incalculable.
   Some of America's largest companies attest to that claim. Kraft
offers a cheese cookbook at a discount to show consumers ways to
use cheese in recipes. Toyota offered an Olympic guidebook to
potential buyers of automobiles.
   For the 100th anniversary of Upjohn, Benjamin published an
elaborate, coffee-table book that was distributed to all Upjohn
employees and retirees, and sent also to doctors, pharmacists,
colleges and libraries.
   Such promotions may not have the hyped-up, razzle-dazzle
gimmicks of the quick-sell advertising in vogue over the past two
decades or more. Benjamin concedes the medium ``is old as the
hills, or at least as old as Gutenberg.'' But, he says, while
hard-sell is ephemeral, book sponsorship is enduring.
   ``A book stays in the home or office, is constantly referred to,
and is a continuing reminder to the consumer of the sponsor's name
and product or service,'' says Benjamin.
   Ted Benjamin, the president, joins in.
   ``There is no distraction or competitive clutter of other
advertiser's message,'' he says. ``Books do not break, they can be
packed in, on or near the product, displayed dramatically, mailed
easily.''
   Books have been the Benjamin brothers' livelihood since they
founded the company 35 years ago, and their press runs have been in
the many millions. While most publishers only dream of such
numbers, the Benjamins' involvement in book creation is less
obvious than most. Instead, the sponsor takes the bows.
   Many volumes have large popular sales, such as ``Do's And Taboos
Around The World,'' a Parker Pen promotion translated into several
languages. But no matter how great the popular sales, they can't
compare with the corporate distribution, which often rises to well
above a million volumes per title.
   Some already are classics before being reproduced by Benjamin,
such as a series of children's illustrated titles (``Tom Sawyer,''
``The Wizard of Oz,'' ``A Christmas Carol,'' and others) offered
free by McDonald's restaurants.
   Many are cook books _ for Sears, Procter & Gamble, Holly Farms,
Lipton, Stokely Van-Camp, Jenn-Air, Oster, Martha White, Tupperware
and more.
   Health books, for institutions such as the American Cancer
Society and for companies seeking sensible health habits among
employees, are popular. Enthusiasm for volumes on money management
is probably as high.
   Corporate stories are forever popular. Typical: ``The Goodyear
Story,'' and ``A Century of Light,'' which traces the General
Electric company backs to Edison.
   In publishing circles, the association with business labels
Benjamin as corporate America's publisher or as a
publishing-marketing organization, but its interests range more
broadly.
   In the Benjamin brothers' concept, business makes useful,
valuable information available, and as a consequence earns
long-lasting goodwill. In many instances the idea for a book
originates with them, then a corporate sponsor is sought.
   It was this curiosity that brought the Benjamins to China where,
says Roy Benjamin, ``they want desperately to read about our way of
life, our historic lore, our literature.''
   He was surprised in China, he says, to find you couldn't give a
more appreciated gift than ``Gone With the Wind'' or other American
classics, and biographies, essays, humor and even self-help and
how-to books.
   The Benjamins say they have two other hot possibilities for
sponsors: Distribution of large-type books to the legally blind,
and low-cost, pocket-size paperbacks, such as illustrated classics,
to combat illiteracy.

<HEAD>Fewer Accidents Since Deregulation, But Concerns Persist</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If accidents are the barometer, there is no
doubt that air travel is safer today than a decade ago when
Congress deregulated the industry. But aviation safety experts say
those statistics don't tell the whole story.
   Concerns persist about the government's ability to keep airlines
honest when industry executives in a fiercely competitive
environment must face the twin challenges of safety and the bottom
line.
   The number of fatal accidents is down, as are accident rates.
But the safety experts say there are frightening signs of an
erosion in the safety cushion that air travelers traditionally have
come to expect.
   Example:
   _As Continental Airlines Flight 1713 rolled down a snow-covered
Denver runway last November, at the controls was a 26-year-old
pilot who had flown only 36 hours in a commercial jet and _ it was
later found _ had a history of control problems with even smaller
propeller aircraft.
   The McDonnell Douglas DC-9 crashed seconds after takeoff,
killing 28 of the 82 people aboard. Investigators blamed ice on the
wings and said the young pilot's handling of the plane on takeoff
was a contributing factor.
   _About the same time, Boeing Co. officials warned Alhoa Airlines
of dangerous corrosion on the skin of several of the airline's
oldest Boeing 737s and questioned their airworthiness. But the
planes kept flying and the Federal Aviation Administration was
unaware of Boeing's concerns.
   Five months later a 20-foot roof section of one of those
jetliners peeled away at 24,000 feet, sweeping a flight attendant
to her death. Although the plane miraculously landed safely, the
incident cast a shadow on Aloha's maintenance and inspection
programs and raised questions about the ability of the FAA to
adequately monitor aircraft maintenance.
   _Last August, a federal report warned that controllers at O'Hare
International Airport in Chicago were flirting with catastrophe
because of manpower shortages, high volumes of traffic and poor
training at the facility that handles traffic in some of the
country's most crowded and complex airspace.
   The FAA launched another investigation, only to learn last month
that controller errors were still increasing. The FAA ordered a
reduction in flights in and out of O'Hare after finding the
airlines had been exceeding federally imposed traffic curbs.
   ``One needs to be reminded that it is indeed possible to skate
successfully on thin ice,'' says John Enders, president of the
Flight Safety Foundation, a private consulting company specializing
in aviation safety matters. ``But it is much more desirable to
skate on thick ice.''
   ``We only know when the ice is too thin, when someone breaks
through,'' he adds.
   The airlines reject suggestions that air travel has become any
less safe during the decade of deregulation.
   A report earlier this year by a presidential commission agreed.
   ``Deregulation has not in itself made the industry less safe,''
declared the President's Aviation Safety Commission. It said
accident statistics based on rates before and after deregulation
showed accidents involving commercial jet aircraft down 55 percent,
fatal accidents down 51 percnet and passenger fatalities down 45
percent.
   John Lauber, a member of the National Transportation Safety
Board, says there is no ``hard data'' to show that airlines are
cutting corners on safety or that air travel has become less safe.
   He contends that one of the problems is that there is no
``safety indicator'' that can be relied upon to say one way or the
other. Nevertheless, he adds, ``to say there is no evidence that
deregulation has affected safety doesn't mean we should get
complacent about it.''
   ``I think we clearly have a safer aviation system today than we
did 10 years ago,'' says Jim Burnett, another NTSB member and its
former chairman.
   But both Burnett and Lauber, whose agency investigates aviation
accidents, suggest there are areas of concern: The continuing
growth in air traffic often concentrated near busy ``hub''
airports, continuing shortages of fully qualified air traffic
controllers, too few pilots to meet the demand, a general reduction
in pilot experience even at large airlines, and a shortage of
federal inspectors to make sure air safety regulations are followed.
   ``System safety is risk management and the question is how well
are we managing risks in the system,'' says Lauber.
   Nevertheless, flying remains one of the safest ways to travel
and the U.S. aviation industry has achieved a safety record that
continues to improve, according to a study of air safety under
deregulation by Congress' Office of Technology Assessment.
   That study also expressed doubt that all airlines always treat
safety issues as a top priority. While a successful airline might
focus more attention on safety, the same priority might not be
evident at a financial strapped airline that must choose between
discretionary maintenance spending or buying an additional slot at
a busy airport, the report said.
   It also raised concern about the dwindling experience level of
pilots. Today there are many more pilots with little or no jet
flying experience being hired by major airlines and commuter
airlines, which last year carried nearly 32 million passengers.
   At the same time, according to air safety and industry experts,
airlines are requiring pilots to fly longer hours, discretionary
maintenance is postponed longer than in the past to keep planes in
service, and many airlines have cut back on engineering, safety and
weather departments to save money.
   Increasingly, airlines flying abroad are relying on foreign
maintenance facilities which, according to some FAA officials, are
more difficult for the U.S. agency to monitor. And while modern jet
engines are exceedingly reliable, the increased use oftwin-engine
aircraft for trans-Atlantic flights _ instead of three or
four-engine jets _ puts new pressures on maintenance.
   It rests in the hands of the FAA to ensure that airlines adhere
to federal safety requirements both in maintenance and operational
procedures.
   But the congressional study, as well as others, have raised
questions about whether the FAA is up to the task. Faced with
budget pressures the FAA ``has been scrambling vainly to catch up
with the industry,'' concluded the report by the Office of
Technology Assessment earlier this year.
   Rep. James Oberstar, D-Minn., chairman of a House investigations
subcommittee, says: ``The FAA simply was unprepared. They had no
idea what deregulation was going to do to the economics of the
airline business and of the response that would be required.''

   At the heart of the FAA's ability to monitor the airlines is its
team of aviation inspectors. But at a time when the airlines were
expanding rapidly in the early l980s, the FAA was cutting its cadre
of inspectors.
   In 1983 when large airlines operated a fleet of 2,475 aircraft,
the FAA had 507 inspectors assigned to jet-operating airlines, 85
fewer than three years before. While its inspector force has
increased to 872, the the number of aircraft operated by these
airlines has jumped to nearly 3,500 and the agency continues its
struggle to catch up.
   Last month the General Accounting Office, the investigative arm
of Congress, reported that because of attrition the FAA ``loses ...
seven air carrier inspectors for every 10 it hires.''
   The FAA also has yet to get enough fully trained air traffic
controllers into some of its busiest facilities such as Chicago,
New York, Atlanta and Los Angeles, where controllers still work
more overtime than both the FAA and the controllers want.
   The airlines, meanwhile, contend that their interest in safety
goes unchallenged and cite statistics showing a nearly tripling of
airline maintenance budgets during the past 10 years.
   ``We are not cutting corners. We would never cut in the areas of
safety ... I don't really believe anybody in the industry is
cutting corners,'' says Hollis Harris, president of Delta Air Lines.
   The FAA has conducted a series of special ``in-depth''
inspections of major air carriers in recent years and levied fines
including one against Eastern Air Lines for a once unheard of $9.5
million for broad recordkeeping and maintenance violations.
   But, says John Nance, a former pilot and author who has been a
vocal critic of both the FAA and the airlines on safety matters:
``If the FAA had been able to do an adequate job of continuous
monitoring and surveillance of Eastern ... the violations would
have been caught (without a special inspection.)''

<DATELINE>HYDABURG, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Adrian LeCornu leaned against the stump
of a 400-year-old spruce and surveyed the remains of the ancient
forest on a hill near his Indian village.
   Where trees 6 feet in diameter once towered over the mossy
forest floor, acres of stumps and rotten wood now litter the
scarred earth.
   ``They say war is hell,'' said LeCornu, Hydaburg's city
administrator. ``Well, logging is not a pretty sight, either.''
   Timber-cutting is nothing new here. A 700-mile web of logging
roads connects this Haida Indian village to the rest of Alaska's
Prince of Wales Island.
   But LeCornu and others who depend on the region's dark forests
and cool waters for subsistence hunting and fishing find it ironic
that the region's most aggressive and destructive logging is being
done by the natives themselves. What is worse, LeCornu said, is
that it may be too late to do anything about it.
   National environmental groups have been crying foul for years
over logging in the old-growth spruce and hemlock forests of
Alaska's 16 million-acre Tongass National Forest, several islands
to the north of Prince of Wales.
   But little is heard about native logging, even though cutting on
native land in Alaska's panhandle has outstripped the Tongass
harvest in each of the last two years. This year, an estimated
15,000 acres of native lands will be cut, compared to about 9,000
acres in the Tongass.
   Leaders of the native corporations say the logging has boosted
the region's economy and caused little environmental damage _
claims disputed by other natives who say the logging provides
temporary profit and long-term harm.
   Commercial fishermen, environmentalists and state wildlife
biologists also voice concerns but say little can be done to
control native logging. The federal regulations that govern cutting
in the Tongass do not apply to native corporations, the panhandle's
major private landowners.
   Clearcutting, which fells all trees in an area, is the norm
here. But Tongass clearcuts are limited to 100 acres, while cuts on
native lands may stretch across thousands.
   In addition, native loggers are not required to leave buffer
strips of trees along salmon streams or to consider the effects of
logging on wildlife habitat. They may also cut on steeper slopes,
increasing the chance for stream-clogging silt and landslides, said
Jack Gustafson, a biologist for the Alaska Department of Fish and
Game.
   ``We've got a new kind of logging,'' Gustafson said. ``A lot of
the long-term effects are not fully known. We have concerns, but we
don't have the authority to change it.''
   The stage was set for native logging with passage of the 1971
Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, which awarded natives 44
million acres and nearly $1 billion to be managed by 12 regional
corporations and 200 village corporations.
   Logging began eight years ago as southeastern Alaska's one
regional corporation and 12 village corporations started receiving
the 470,000 acres promised them in the act.
   Even corporate leaders were surprised at how fast the trees fell.
   When the timber export market declined sharply in 1981, some
corporations had to log heavily to pay off start-up loans. When
timber prices rose in 1986, logging intensified as corporations
converted assets to cash. Perhaps the strongest incentive to keep
cutting down trees was the 1986 Tax Reform Act, under which native
corporations could sell their operating losses to profitable
corporations in need of tax write-offs.
   The results of accelerated logging are plain to see.
   Twenty miles south of Hydaburg, a 30,000-acre island is being
shaved of old-growth timber. Near the Chichagof Island village of
Hoonah, hillsides ``look like they've been nuked,'' according to
Ernestine Hanlon. The angry villager said logging had destroyed her
favorite spot for collecting the spruce roots she weaves into
baskets.
   The rush to cut has overwhelmed Gustafson and other state
inspectors, who enforce the state's Forest Practices Act and try to
protect salmon streams.
   This summer, in one of the most serious violations, Klukwan
Forest Products Inc. was fined $7,500 and ordered to restore a
500-foot stretch of a salmon stream it had buried under tons of
logs, branches and organic debris.
   Besides noting the potential damage to salmon runs by such
careless logging practices, environmentalists also say clearcuts _
and the young, same-height forests that follow _ threaten Sitka
black-tailed deer, which depend on old trees for protection from
deep snow.
   But the environmentalists have not pressed their concerns,
concentrating instead on the Tongass National Forest.
   ``You have to pick your fights,'' said Bart Koehler, director of
the Southeast Alaska Conservation Council. ``There is a better
chance of changing things on public lands than on native lands.''
   That's as it should be, said Richard Harris, a vice president
for Sealaska Corp., the regional native corporation and
southeastern Alaska's biggest private landowner. Private land
should not be subject to the same constraints as public land, he
said. Like any corporation, Sealaska has a responsibility to its
shareholders to maximize profits, he said.
   Not surprisingly, attitudes toward logging in native villages
depend at least partly on how much the villages have gained from
logging.
   Complaints are few in the Prince of Wales Island village of
Kasaan, whose corporation sold its timber rights, invested the
money and now pays an annual $10,000 dividend to each of its 119
shareholders.
   In Hydaburg, the rewards have been smaller, and the opposition
to logging has been greater. When land was being handed out, the
village's Haida Corp. received mostly scrub timber and is just now
struggling out of bankruptcy court.
   Meanwhile, Sealaska and Klukwan Corp., a village corporation
based 300 miles to the north, are heavily cutting more productive
lands near Hydaburg.
   When Sealaska sought to cut trees above Hydaburg's reservoir,
the city council forced one delay after another, worried that
logging would silt up streams and foul its water supply. Sealaska
had planned to cut up to 700 acres in the watershed. It stopped in
May 1987, after cutting only 100 acres.
   ``Sealaska probably will never touch the watershed again _ too
much trouble,'' said Hydaburg Mayor Robert Sanderson.
   Recent efforts to regulate native logging have concentrated on
putting more teeth in the state's Forest Practices Act. This
summer, Gov. Steve Cowper appointed a panel to review the law.
   But any changes will come too late to affect most native land.
Several village corporations have exhausted their commercial timber
stands, and the others are expected to run out of trees within
three years. Sealaska can log for eight to 10 more years.
   The forest will take 100 years to grow back to commercial size,
at least 300 years to become the old-growth forest that
environmentalists are now trying to protect.
   ``How do you manage the land now?'' asked Mayor Sanderson.
``It's already stripped. All you can do now is let the trees grow
back.''

<HEAD>Snake Blood Sold As Cure-all</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HARI S. MANIAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BIDOR, Malaysia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It's snake blood, not snake oil, but the
Bidor Snake Shop says it cures the same aches, arthritis, asthma,
acne and mysterious maladies of a sexual nature.
   The proprietor, Loi Chee Long, sells the blood of cobras and
other poisonous snakes to those who find his shop in this jungle
town 90 miles north of Kuala Lumpur and can pay the fee of up to
$120.
   Customers buy the snake, then Loi kills it and drains the blood,
mixing it with brandy for taste and wallop.
   Most of his customers are from Malaysia and Singapore, but some
tourists drop in from Korea, Japan, Taiwan and Hong Kong and there
is the occasional Western curiosity-seeker.
   ``The white man comes, but I think it is all too disgusting to
him,'' said Loi, 27. ``He inquires about the whole thing with great
enthusiasm, but when we ask him to have a drink he says `Not for
me, thanks.'''
   As he spoke, Loi had a firm grip on the neck of a cobra longer
than he was. Loi is about 5 ft. tall and the reptile's tail
thrashed the ground.
   The commotion continued while he explained calmly that people
drink snake blood because it can cure ``rheumatism, body aches and
skin diseases, improve the eyesight and increase your sexual
prowess, among other things.''
   He said a snake's venom is in its mouth and the blood contains
no poison.
   Loi explained the procedure like a surgeon conducting class:
   ``I hold the snake by the neck, find the main blood vessels on
the underside, slit them with a sharp knife and gather the blood in
the glass.
   ``Pieces of the snake's gallbladder are thrown in and an equal
amount of brandy is added. The brandy is to give the whole thing a
kick as you drink it. Beer and stout won't give that.
   ``This drinking cobra blood is nothing new. The Chinese have
been doing it for years.''
   With his free hand, he plucked a snake from another cage.
   ``Am I scared?'' he said. ``No. I have been catching snakes
since I left school at the age of 16.
   ``At first I used to creep quietly behind the snake, hold its
head with a stick and grab it by the neck and dump it into a cage.
Now I just grab it by the neck. After so many years, it would be
amateurish to use the stick.''
   He has never been bitten, Loi said, because he is a professional
snake catcher whose rule is: ``Your hand grabbing the neck has to
be quicker than the cobra's head to bite you.''
   Other professional catchers in Bidor include Wai Kwan Yang, his
partner in the shop, and Lim Ah Ha, who was listening to the
interview, Loi said.
   They take no antidote with them on hunting forays ``because the
doctor says it is illegal for us to carry such medicine around,''
he said, but ``we carry a small knife. If I am bitten I would cut
the area, drain the blood and rush to a doctor.
   ``We catch only poisonous snakes like the cobra, black cobra,
king cobra and pit vipers because only their blood will have the
proper effect.''
   About 30 to 50 people come to the shop for blood every month,
which Loi said was healthy traffic considering the price.
   ``To buy a cobra or some other poisonous snake ... would cost
between 100 and 300 ringgits ($40 to $120), and that is a lot of
money considering that a long snake would only yield about six to
eight tablespoons of blood,'' he said. ``One snake is enough only
for one drink.''

<HEAD>School Children Practice Occultism, Devil Worship</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOAN FISCHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The popularity of occultism,
including devil worship, is growing among West Germany's young and
a newspaper said some even engage in the practices during breaks at
school.
   Parents, public officials and church leaders say 10,000
teen-agers may be involved in occult practices ranging from seances
to ``black sabbaths'' in which animals are sacrificed at cemeteries.
   A front-page report Oct. 8 in the influential Frankfurter
Allgemeine Zeitung carried the headline, ``The Occult Is Spreading
in Our Schools.''
   It cited instances of pupils using breaks between classes for
occult practices and said: ``Participants withdraw from other
teen-agers. Their thoughts constantly revolve around the puzzling
world of the spirits.''
   In September, a meeting of the national parents' council issued
a statement declaring: ``The rise of occultism and magic practices
(among pupils) indicates spiritual and psychological deficits in
our society.''
   Hans-Joachim Neuser, spokesman for the North-Rhine Westphalia
state culture ministry, said: ``Teens are using occult beliefs as
they would a drug. This is more than just an individual case or a
passing fad.''
   He said officials the number of reports from schools was
growing, especially from religion teachers.
   ``Often the pupils themselves get scared they might have gone
too far in their occult practices and turn to their religion
teachers for help,'' Neuser told The Associated Press by telephone.
Religion is a subject in most West German public schools.
   Occult practices among teen-agers ``range from experimentation
with pendulums or glasses to devil-worship ceremonies calling for
animal sacrifice,'' Neuser said.
   The first practice mentioned involves calling on spirits to
guide a dangling pendulum to letters or words placed beneath it. In
other ceremonies, spirits of deceased friends or relatives are
asked to move a glass, coins, or a table in response to certain
questions.
   Among factors blamed for the turn to occultism are youth
unemployment, broken homes and pessimism about the future.
   Two teen-age members of a group practicing devil worship were
convicted of murder by a Muenster regional court in October 1987.
They slit the wrists and throat of another cult member in what was
to be a group suicide.
   Youngsters killed a cat during a ``black sabbath'' at a Dortmund
cemetery and ripped out its intestines, the Hamburg newspaper Welt
am Sonntag reported on Feb. 21.
   Spiegel, the weekly news magazine, published a photograph Oct.
12, 1987, of a note it said was written by a ninth-grader in
Lahnstein and intercepted by her teacher.
   ``I asked Lucifer yesterday who is possessed by the devil,'' it
said, and listed the names of 11 other pupils, the magazine
reported.
   The Rev. Walter Schmidt of the Lutheran Central Organization for
World Views in Stuttgart said: ``At least 10,000 teen-agers are
involved to one degree or another in various occult practices,''
   A Lutheran pastor in Stuttgart, the Rev. Hans-Juergen Ruppert,
said teen-age adherence to traditional religions is declining in
concert with occultism's rise.
   ``Teens are in increasing numbers turning away from traditional
religion and turning to the occult as a replacement,'' he said.
``We have to increase contact with them through church youth groups
and by strengthening their bonds to religion. The danger is that
these children may continue drifting away from society.''
   Neuser expressed fear of a deeper effect:
   ``This involvement happens while the youngster is still forming
a sense of values and responsibility. If distant powers are
supposedly controlling his behavior, he never has to take
responsibility for his actions.''

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Old dogs in the investment game are trying to
teach themselves some new tricks to use in the fast-approaching
season for yearend tax planning.
   Since tax reform took full effect, a lot of the traditional
rules in this annual exercise no longer apply.
   And with gains or losses from investments now treated as just
another form of income _ eligible for no special tax break _ there
is much less reason to worry about whether a given profit or loss
is long-term or short-term (held for one year or less).
   But experts on this subject say there is still a lot that
investors can do to try to minimize the taxes they will owe for
1988.
   One relatively simple example: If you have gains from
investments sold earlier in the year, and are sitting with a paper
loss on a security you still own, you might consider selling that
security to reduce or offset the tax you might otherwise have to
pay on your profitable transactions.
   Two major unknown factors go into any calculation involving
yearend tax maneuvers this time around.
   First of all, there is the distinct possibility that income tax
rates may be raised in 1989 and beyond.
   That would constitute an argument for reversing the usual
process and taking gains this year, while deferring losses into the
future when they would have greater value as a deduction.
   At the same time, proposals have been made to restore the tax
break for long-term capital gains, which before tax reform were 60
percent exempt from federal taxes.
   That possibility, though by no means a certainty, stands as a
point in favor of holding on to long-term investments that show a
profit until you can see what a new administration and a new
Congress are likely to do.
   On this point, ``long-term'' deserves special emphasis. While
there may be some sentiment in Washington for stimulating long-term
savings and investment, there is very little for encouraging
short-term trading.
   Along with these imponderables, there are still some
hard-and-fast rules to go by. Losses that exceed gains for
instance, are deductible only up to a limit of $3,000. Anything
more than that has to be carried forward to future years.
   If you sell a security to realize a loss, you cannot buy the
same security within 30 days before or after the sale without
creating a ``wash sale'' that invalidates the deduction for the
loss.
   There remain several strategies for ``freezing'' gains on
profitable investments so that the tax liability can be postponed
into 1989, and any broker will be more than pleased to explain them.
   These techniques do bring transaction costs, which should be
weighed carefully to determine whether the expense is worth the tax
saving.
   Taxpayers who use substantial amounts of borrowed money to
finance their investment activities also need to consider new rules
covering the deduction for investment interest.
   Suppose you owned two stocks financed with borrowed money. One
of them was a loser, and you dumped it not long ago. You are
hanging onto the other, which has risen sharply in price.
   To make sure you can get a deduction for all the interest you
pay this year on the borrowed money, it might prove advantageous to
sell your winner before yearend so that your investment income is
pretty much in line with you interest expense.
   You can buy the stock back immediately if you wish, since the
``wash sale'' rule does not apply to gains.

<HEAD>WASHN: Sweeney said.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   In at least one case this year, that approach has caused a major
rift between union's headquarters and local Teamster leaders.
   Teamster officials in Connecticut wanted the union to support
Democratic Attoney General Joseph I. Lieberman's bid to unseat
veteran Republican Sen. Lowell P. Weicker Jr.; national union
leaders preferred Weicker.
   ``You defeat the system and the whole purpose of a political
action committee if you work against a guy like Weicker who has a
100 percent pro-labor voting record,'' Sweeney said.
   Sweeney said officials in his office also try to dissuade
Teamster locals from ``going after a very conservative Republican
where you can't beat him.''
   He cited veteran conservative Republican Reps. James H. Quillen
of Tennessee, the ranking minority member on the House Rules
Committee, and Donald E. Lukens of Ohio. Both have large Teamster
locals in their districts.
   And both, according to Sweeney, were instrumental in getting
signatures from other ``pillars of the far right'' such as Rep.
Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., on letters from 264 House members condemning
a Justice Department suit to take over the union under the
Racketeer Influenced Corrupt Organizations Act.
   The suit has become an issue in some House campaigns.
   The campaign manager for incumbent Rep. Doug Bereuter, R-Neb.,
suggested that Democratic opponent, Warren Jones, return a $5,000
DRIVE contribution. The Teamsters gave Jones another $5,000.
   Thomas H. Fetzer Jr., the GOP opponent of Rep. David E. Price,
D-N.C., challenged Price's acceptance of $10,000 from the Teamsters
in light of the suit.
   Rep. James McClure Clark, D-N.C., was accused of accepting
``tainted'' Teamster money by his opponent, Republican Charles H.
Taylor.
   Clark responded that he has yet to hear Taylor or any Republican
``suggest that President Reagan return any contributions'' from the
Teamsters in the union's endorsement of him in 1980 and 1984.
   Sweeney said the attacks have stopped since the Teamsters
complained to Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, and Stevens talked to
former Republican Sen. Paul Laxalt of Nevada, now an adviser to the
Bush campaign.
   ``We think it was organized, they deny it,'' he said.
   Rep. Beryl Anthony of Arkansas, chairman of the Democratic
Congressional Campaign Committee, sent a letter to colleagues
suggesting they ``neutralize'' the attacks by pointing to the
Teamsters' $189,275 in contributions to Republicans.
   Among them, according to the FEC, are $8,000 to Sen. Phil Gramm
of Texas, $5,000 to House Republican Leader Robert Michel of
Illinois and $1,000 to House Republican Whip Trent Lott, who is
seeking the Senate seat of retiring Mississippi Democrat John
Stennis.

   The court ruled 4-3 on Thursday that California's 1907 antitrust
law does not apply to mergers.
   Van de Kamp had contended that the 1984 merger would eventually
lead to higher gasoline prices in the state by drying up oil
supplies to cut-rate independent refiners.

   Time Inc. agreed to pay an initial $185 million
for half-interest in Whittle Communications LP, a fast-growing
media company known for developing innovative ways for advertisers
to reach select audiences.
   Whittle founder Christopher Whittle, who is staying on as
chairman of the partnership, said Thursday he was selling half of
his $80 million stake to Time as part of the deal.
   The deal was seen as a low-risk way for Time to share in the
rewards of association with one of the feistiest players in the
media business.

   A state judge ruled that H. Ross Perot cannot

   A judge in the circuit court for Fairfax, Va., issued an

   Despite drought, the net cash income of
farmers in 1988 is expected to nearly match or exceed last year's
record $57.1 billion, unchanged from the outlook a month ago, the
Agriculture Department said.
   The department said Thursday that higher commodity prices,
inventory drawdowns and ``only moderate decreases'' in government
subsidies are the main reasons for forecasting 1988 net cash income
in a range of $55 billion to $60 billion.
   Net cash income is the amount of money farmers have to spend
during the year and represents the difference between gross cash
income and cash expenses.

<HEAD>Oil Prices Plunge as Traders Await Outcome of OPEC Committee
Meeting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pessimism about OPEC's ability to limit
production and stabilize prices has again gripped the oil futures
market, sending prices sharply lower in wildly volatile trading.
   The November contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark
U.S. crude, plunged 80 cents Thursday to close at $14.60 a
42-gallon barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   On Wednesday, the November contract soared 79 cents, following a
60-cent drop the previous session. During the course of Thursday's
trading, the contract traded as low as $14.25 and as high as $15.30.
   Analysts said the extreme volatility has reflected the waning
and waxing of traders' hopes that the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries can agree to cap its runaway overproduction and
stabilize the price of oil.
   ``The market lived and died completely on rumors of whether this
OPEC agreement will come together,'' said Peter Beutel, an
assistant director at Elders Futures Inc.
   OPEC's strategy and pricing committees were meeting Thursday in
Madrid, Spain, but the session had not begun by the close of
trading on the mercantile exchange.
   Rumors that Iran would refuse to join its fellow OPEC members in
an agreement sparked the heavy selling, Beutel said.
   Overproduction by the 13-nation cartel sent the price of oil
skidding below the $12.30-a-barrel mark recently, but prices
recovered somewhat as Thursday's session drew near.
   Estimates of the cartel's daily output have ranged as high as 22
million barrels of oil. Members of the six-nation Gulf Cooperation
Council, several of whom are OPEC members, have proposed an overall
ceiling of 18.5 million to 19 million barrels a day.
   Analysts expect trading to remain volatile even after the
conclusion of the Madrid conference because OPEC has scheduled a
full ministerial meeting on Nov. 21.
   Beutel called the market confused, adding, ``We're just waiting
to find out what OPEC's going to do.''
   Refined products traded on the Mercantile Exchange were mixed
Thursday. The November contract for home heating oil fell 0.79 cent
to close at 43.06 cents a gallon. However, the November contract
for wholesale unleaded gasoline rose 0.29 cent to settle at 49.35
cents a gallon.
   Beutel said gasoline futures were higher because of tight
supplies in the cash market.

   Here, at a glance, are recent buyout proposals made in the food
business:
   _RJR Nabisco Inc.: Top managers of the food and tobacco products
company said Thursday they were considering offering to take the
company private in a leveraged buyout at $75 a share, or nearly $17
billion. A higher bid was considered likely after investors bid the
company's stock above that price.
   _Kraft Inc.: Philip Morris Cos. Inc., the consumer and tobacco
products company, offered $90 a share, or $11 billion, for the
processed foods manufacturer. After the bid was announced on
Monday, Kraft said it was studying the offer and expected to
respond by Oct. 31.
   _Pillsbury Inc.: Grand Metropolitan PLC of Britain offered $60 a
share, or $5.23 billion, for the company that manufactures
Pillsbury and Green Giant foods and that also owns the Burger King,
Steak and Ale and Bennigans restaurant chains. Pillsbury rejected
the bid on Tuesday as inadequate and said it was exploring options
in response to Grand Metropolitan's offer.
   _Holly Farms Corp.: Tyson Foods Inc. offered $45 a share, or
about $900 million, for its rival poultry processor. Holly Farms
rejected the bid as inadequate on Wednesday. Tyson has not said

<HEAD>Appellate Court Temporarily Halts Drexel Proceedings</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK GLADSTONE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. has convinced a
federal appeals court to at least consider its request to
disqualify a lower-court judge presiding over the massive
civil-fraud case against the Wall Street giant.
   A one-page written order issued Thursday by the 2nd Circuit
Court of Appeals temporarily halted all proceedings in the
Securities and Exchange Commission's suit against Drexel while
weighing the request.
   The appellate order also halted proceedings in 13 related
insider-trading civil suits presided over by the U.S. district
judge in question, Milton Pollack.
   The order came three days after Pollack, an 82-year-old jurist
known for tough rulings against white-collar defendants in
securities-fraud cases, angrily rejected defense entreaties to quit
the case on grounds of a potential conflict of interest, calling
such requests nonsense.
   Defense attorneys immediately appealed his rejection by filing
an unusual petition requesting the higher court to intervene.
   The appellate order said ``a stay of all proceedings in district
court is granted, pending determination of the petition.''
   The immediate effect was to delay a hearing Pollack had
scheduled on pretrial fact-gathering by defense attorneys and the
SEC, which accused Drexel and four key employees of extensive
securities fraud in a 184-page civil suit filed last month.
   The order also delayed the expected completion of a partial
settlement in some of the related civil suits.
   It gave the SEC and attorneys for others that have sued Drexel
until Oct. 28 to respond to the defense request for Pollack to step
aside.
   Drexel spokesman Steven Anreder declined to comment on the
appellate order.
   The Washington office of Barry Goldsmith, the SEC deputy
litigation chief in charge of the case, said he was out of town and
unavailable for comment.
   Lawyers familiar with the case said the order represented at
least a recognition by the appellate court that Drexel's arguments
requesting Pollack to quit the case should be taken seriously.
   Attorneys for Drexel and the other defendants have alleged that
Pollack cannot rule fairly in the case because his wife, Moselle,
stands to gain about $30 million from her sale of stock in Palais
Royal Inc., a Houston-based concern going private in a transaction
Drexel is helping finance.
   Although the alleged conflict would appear to make Pollack
biased in Drexel's favor, the defense has argued that the firm is
entitled to a judge who can rule with absolute impartiality.
   Pollack ridiculed the defense argument, saying his wife had no
relationship with Drexel. He called the argument a time-wasting
ploy devised by the firm's attorneys to frustrate the SEC case.
   On Sept. 7 the SEC accused Drexel and the other defendants of
scheming with now-imprisoned insider trader Ivan Boesky to break a
litany of securities-fraud laws. The defendants have denied the
accusations.
   The Manhattan U.S. attorney's office, which also has been
investigating Drexel's relationship with Boesky since he turned
state's evidence almost two years ago, is widely expected to seek
indictments of the firm soon.
   Earlier this week it notified Drexel in a so-called ``target
letter'' that a grand jury was considering whether to charge the
firm with securities fraud under the Racketeering Influenced and
Corrupt Practices law, which carries devastating penalties. Drexel
has repeatedly denied wrongdoing.
   The Justice Department confirmed Thursday that it would meet
soon with attorneys for Drexel to discuss these possible charges.
   The meeting, expected to take place next Monday, gives Drexel an
opportunity to persuade federal prosecutors that a racketeering
indictment, which alleges a pattern of criminal activity and
originally was designed to battle gangsters, drug dealers and
pimps, is unwarranted and unfair.
   A pioneer in the so-called ``junk-bond'' high-yield securities
market, Drexel is one of the biggest and most profitable Wall
Street firms, with more than 10,000 employees, capital of about
$2.2 billion and assets of more than $30 billion.

<HEAD>Ramada Unveils Restructuring Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRIS GARIFO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ramada Inc., intent on focusing on its profitable
gambling operations, has unveiled a restructuring plan that
includes selling off its hotel and restaurant businesses and
distributing at least $278 million to shareholders.
   The plan, announced Thursday, was devised partly in response to
a recent buyout offer from Chicago's Pritzker family, which
controls 7.2 percent of Ramada's outstanding stock and is the
company's largest shareholder.
   Last month Ramada rejected as inadequate the Pritzkers' $368
million buyout offer. Shortly thereafter, the company said it was
reviewing various options to boost shareholder value, including the
sale of assets and a management-led buyout.
   Joe Cole, Ramada's vice president for corporate communications,
said the Pritzkers remain potential buyers for the company's hotel
business. Ramada owns, operates and franchises 800 hotels under the
Ramada and Rodeway names.
   Under terms of the restructuring plan approved by the Ramada
board, Cole said stockholders would be paid at least $7 a share in
cash, depending on the successful sale of the restaurant and hotel
businesses.
   Richard Snell, Ramada chairman and chief executive officer, said
in a statement that the restructuring ``will allow the company to
optimize its investment in the hotel business in the context of
recent prices paid for hotel operations sold as ongoing
businesses.'' A number of major hotel properties have sold for top
dollar recently.
   Cole noted that Ramada's hotel business ``has not been
performing well lately. It has not been producing the return on
equity that we expected from it.''
   Without the hotel and restaurant operations, Ramada said it
expects its ``overall performance (to) significantly improve.''
   Ramada, which also owns Marie Callender's restaurants, will
retain its gambling businesses, which include TropWorld in Atlantic
City, N.J., and Tropicana in Las Vegas.
   While the restructuring should be completed in the first half of
1989, Cole noted that Ramada could not offer any guarantees. He
also said there are no assurances of the exact amount of cash
shareholders would receive.
   The company retained the option of paying at least part of the
money in notes. In addition to selling off assets, Cole said Ramada
would have to refinance or renegotiate a substantial portion of the
company's debt.
   Thursday's move is the latest in a string of attempts to improve
the Phoenix-based hospitality company's financial position.
   A deal to sell its international hotels to BAA PLC of London
fell through last month. In July, Ramada sold its $60 million
Ramada Express Hotel and Casino in Laughlin, Nev., to Phoenix-based
H&M Station Inc. just one month after it opened the 406-room
facility.

<HEAD>Judge Restricts New Perot Company From Competing With EDS</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JENNIFER DIXON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Texas billionaire H. Ross Perot has been
barred from reaping profits in deals that compete with Electronic
Data Systems, the data-processing company he founded and once
headed, a judge has ruled.
   But Thursday's ruling in the circuit court of suburban Fairfax,
Va., stipulated that Perot can compete with EDS in ventures that
make no profits.
   After a 3{-day hearing, Judge William G. Plummer ordered Perot
and his new computer services company, Perot Systems Corp., to
immediately stop ``soliciting, negotiating for, entering into or
performing any contract or other business relationship that
contemplates or calls for any profitable return to the defendants
at any point in time.''
   Profitable ventures would violate an agreement Perot signed in
late 1986 not to compete with EDS until late 1989.
   Plummer said, however, that Perot Systems could sign contracts
for work, as long as they would not produce any profit, even after
Perot's agreement with EDS expried.
   The injunction is in force pending a hearing next April on EDS's
lawsuit that charges Perot violated the competition agreement.
   Perot seemed nonplussed by the ruling and noted that he could
still go head-to-head with EDS and hire EDS employees.
   ``I'd like to keep doing business,'' Perot said.
   But EDS claimed victory. EDS spokeswoman Penny Pasquesi said,
``EDS won the game and now we're trying to bicker over the score.
Perot thinks it's a tie and we think we won.''
   She said the judge's ruling did not address the hiring issue,
although it came up during the hearing.
   Perot founded EDS in 1962 and sold it to General Motors Corp. in
1984. The relationship between Perot and GM soon soured, and Perot
and three other top EDS executives left the firm in December 1986
when GM agreed to pay them about $850 million. Perot also stepped
down from GM's board in a bitter parting with the automaker.
   EDS in its lawsuit claimed Perot had violated an agreement to
refrain from competing with the data-processing company for at
least three years after the split.
   Perot has filed a countersuit in U.S. District Court in Dallas,
seeking an injunction to prevent EDS and GM from interfering in the
business activities of Perot Systems.
   A day after forming Perot Systems this spring, the Dallas
businessman revealed its first job was a no-bid, $500,000 contract
to automate the U.S. Postal Service. Perot said the contract would
be a non-profit agreement until the expiration date of his
agreement with GM.
   The General Administration Services then canceled the contract
after EDS, other competitors and Washington lawmakers complained
that the Perot Systems contract unfairly favored Perot.
   The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit
overturned the GSA's ruling, but the deal remains suspended under
an action by Postmaster General Anthony Frank. A decision has not
been made on whether the service will resume its dealings with
Perot's company.
   Perot, meanwhile, also is competing with EDS for the Texas
Medicaid contract that EDS has held since 1976 and helped the
company establish its reputation nationwide.
   In testimony Wednesday, Perot said he informed EDS executives in
November 1986 of his plans to start a new firm and eventually
compete with them.
   ``I explained I would have the right to form a new company and
provide a haven for EDS employees,'' Perot said, describing a
meeting he attended with top EDS officers around the 1986
Thanksgiving weekend. ``I answered every question I was asked fully
and directly because I wanted everyone fully informed.''
   Malcolm Guidis, an EDS senior vice president, denied in
testimony that the meeting with Perot took place.

<HEAD>GAF Agrees To Sweetened $1.5 Billion Offer From Management</HEAD>

<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   GAF Corp.'s board has accepted a $1.46
billion buyout offer spearheaded by Chairman Samuel J. Heyman more
than a year after reviewing his original bid that valued the
company at nearly $1 billion more.
   The Wayne, N.J.-based specialty chemicals and building products
concern said Thursday that the latest proposal was endorsed by a
special non-management board committee, and then the board itself,
with one dissenter.
   The board had made no recommendation to shareholders on a
previous $1.4 billion offer announced by a Heyman-led investment
group on March 1.
   Heyman made his first buyout offer more than a year ago, but he
shelved that bid after the stock market crashed last October. He
returned with a revised offer.
   GAF said the latest offer would pay stockholders $53 in cash and
securities for each share _ $46 in cash plus debt securities
intended to have a value of at least $7. The previous offer was
valued at $51 a share in cash and debt.
   GAF's stock rose $2 a share to $49 Thursday in consolidated New
York Stock Exchange trading.
   Robert L. Renck Jr. of the R.L. Renck & Co. brokerage firm in
New York, said he valued GAF's stock at about $60.
   ``I think that Heyman's getting a deal,'' he said.
   Heyman, who owns 2.8 million shares, or about 10 percent of
GAF's outstanding shares, offered to take the company private in
September 1987. That offer, of $64 in cash and about $2.50 in
securities, valued the company at about $2.3 billion.
   According to published reports last October, a four-member
special committee of directors rejected the bid as inadequate.
   After the stock market crash, Heyman halted the offer, citing
rising interest rates. GAF's stock also had plunged to around $31 a
share from $69.50 on the day Heyman's offer was announced.
   The bid was reactivated in December but at a total value of
about $1.35 billion.
   In a statement issued by GAF, Heyman said: ``We are delighted
with the agreement reached today with the special committee and
look forward to an early closing of the transaction.''
   Heyman, a 48-year-old takeover specialist who won control of GAF
in a proxy fight, has said he wanted to take GAF private with an
eye to future takeover bids.

<TEXT>
   Time Inc.'s decision to pay an initial $185
million for half-interest in Whittle Communications LP should prove
rewarding to both media companies, analysts say.
   It may also prove personally rewarding to Whittle founder
Christopher Whittle, who said he was selling half of his $80
million stake in the feisty media partnership to Time as part of
the deal.
   Analysts said the deal, announced Thursday, was a low-risk way
for Time to share in the rewards of association with a concern that
has made its reputation by developing innovative ways for
advertisers to reach select audiences.
   At the same time, they said it would give Whittle access to the
resources and experience of one the nation's biggest communications
companies.
   ``It looks like a good deal for both sides,'' said John Reidy,
media analyst for the investment firm Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
   Under terms of the deal, approved by the Time board but still
subject to negotiation of a definitive agreement, Time would make
unspecified additional payments tied to Whittle's earnings growth
over the next five years.
   Time also can boost its stake in Whittle to 80 percent in 1993
if certain earnings targets were met.
   Whittle was one of four college students who started Whittle
Communications in 1970. Another major owner of the privately held
concern is Associated Newspaper Holdings PLC, a British company.
   Whittle said he would receive about $40 million of Time's
initial payment in return for half of his 22 percent stake in
Whittle Communications.
   He declined to say how large Associated's stake was, and the
British company was closed for the day when the deal was announced.
   Reginald K. Brack, head of Time's magazine group, said Whittle
Communications' earnings have grown at a 20 percent annual rate
over the past five years. ``You have to be impressed with Whittle's
track record,'' he said.
   Whittle said his company decided about four months ago to seek
out a partner who could help it grow even more rapidly.
   The company publishes magazines targeted for special audiences
such as students, people in doctors' waiting rooms and parents as
well as posters with ads that are placed at well-traveled locations
such as school halls.
   Whittle Communications posted revenue of about $152 million this
year and projected operating income for 1989 at about $35 million
on revenue of $185 million.
   Whittle said Time's offer was not the highest but was selected
because Time had a breadth of experience and resources and would
give Whittle managers autonomy as they develop more magazines,
posters, book and video vehicles.
   Whittle, who is chairman of Whittle Communications, and his team
of managers will continue operating the business after the deal is
concluded.
   The deal was tinged with irony because Whittle has been making
inroads in the magazine field by making fun of the magazine
establishment.
   That was evident in the recent Whittle launch of Special
Reports, a six-magazine package that was designed specifically for
doctors' waiting rooms.
   Whittle sold $80 million in advertising for the magazines by
offering companies exclusivity in their product categories and
asking doctors who get the magazines to have no more than two other
magazines in their waiting rooms.
   The latter request to doctors infuriated magazine publishers,
including some at Time's publications.
   But Time's Brack downplayed the significance of the dispute,
saying that ``like any marriage, we're not going to agree on
everything.''
   Time has taken a stake in other magazine ventures. It is a
partner, for instance, in the concern that publishes McCall's and
Working Woman magazines.
   Analysts said some recent costly failures of startup magazines
have made Time more leery of trying to start magazines from scratch.
   But Brack said Time is taking both approaches, saying it has
some projects of its own that are nearing launch but refused to
discuss them.

   The Senate ended a century of hesitation by
giving its approval to a treaty giving American artists and writers
copyright protection in 76 nations around the world.
   The Senate's voice-vote approval of the treaty Thursday opens
the way for the United States to become the 77th member of the
Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works.
   President Reagan will take the final step by depositing the U.S.
ratification documents with the convention.
   Under the treaty, artists and writers from the convention's
other member nations will enjoy copyright protection in the United
States.
   The House and Senate earlier had approved implementing
legislation making minor adjustments to U.S. copyright law to
conform to the Berne Convention's requirements.
   The convention, signed in Berne, Switzerland on Sept. 9, 1886,
spells out minimum copyright standards, detailing exactly what is
protected and how long the protection lasts.
   The pact bars member nations from discriminating against
protected works from other member states.
   The implementing bill recognizes architectural plans as a
pictorial, sculptural or graphic work.
   It also exempts foreign artists and writers from the requirement
imposed on their American counterparts that their works must be
registered with the U.S. Copyright Office before a lawsuit claiming
copyright infringement can be filed.

   A federal court jury has acquitted Sasson Jeans
founder Paul Guez of threatening the life of a U.S. bankruptcy
judge.
   The jury deliberated less than two hours before finding Guez
innocent Thursday following a three-day trial in Manhattan.
   Guez was arrested in Manhattan last May 18 after reportedly
threatening the life of Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland, who was
presiding over the reorganization of Sasson Jeans Inc.
   Lifland later authorized the sale of the Sasson trademark as
part of the bankruptcy proceedings.
   Guez, who spent 28 days at a drug rehabilitation center in
California this past summer, said he was ``very much happy'' with
the verdict.

<HEAD>Nabisco Buyout A Defensive Move, Analysts Say</HEAD>

selling non-tobacco businesses.</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   RJR Nabisco Inc. managers dropped a $17 billion
bombshell by disclosing they are considering a buyout of the food
and tobacco company at that price, which would make it the largest
takeover in history.
   Analysts speculated the move was designed to dissuade unwanted
suitors from approaching Nabisco, maker of Winston and Camel
cigarettes, Oreo cookies and Ritz crackers.
   Thursday's announcement that a group led by president and chief
executive F. Ross Johnson is mulling a $75-a-share offer to take
Nabisco private sent the company's stock soaring. In heavy trading
on the New York Stock Exchange, Nabisco jumped $21.37{ a share to
$77.25, and observers predicted the price will go higher.
   Lawrence Adelman, an analyst at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.,
priced Nabisco at between $90 and $100 a share and said Johnson
``is trying to steal the company'' at $75 a share.
   Analysts viewed the move as a ``pre-emptive strike'' designed to
ward off other unwanted bidders at a time when the takeover
spotlight is shining brightly on major food companies.
   On Monday, Philip Morris Cos. Inc. offered more than $11 billion
for processed foods manufacturer Kraft Inc. The following day,
Pillsbury Co. rejected a $5.23 billion tender offer launched by
Britain's Grand Metropolitan PLC.
   Neal Kaplan, an analyst with Interstate-Johnson Lane in
Charlotte, N.C., said Nabisco ``may be recognizing that others may
be looking at them.''
   At the same time, he said, Nabisco executives see Philip Morris
paying ``20-odd times earnings for Kraft and say, `We can spend all
our money and buy ourselves, which we know is good.'''
   He viewed the buyout proposal as a continuation of Nabisco's
strategy of buying back its own stock. On July 31, the company had
225 million shares outstanding, down from 247 million at the end of
1987. At $75 a share, the buyout proposal currently is worth about
$16.88 billion.
   Nabisco said Johnson and Edward A. Horrigan Jr., chief executive
of the company's tobacco business, had notified the company they
``intend to seek to develop, with a financial partner, a proposal
to acquire RJR Nabisco in a leveraged buyout merger transaction.''
   Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., which is advising the management
group, would provide equity and financing for the deal.
   The company said late Thursday the offer will be reviewed by a
special committee of outside directors led by Chairman Charles E.
Hugel. Leaving the door open for a bidding war, the committee also
said it will review ``any other acquisition interest that may be
presented.''
   While some analysts suggested a buyout would have to reach at
least $85 a share to be successful, Kaplan said a $75 ``looks like
a darn good number.''
   At that level, he said, the company could pay off new debt
through revenues, a strategy that would be more difficult at a
higher price.
   In a leveraged buyout, the buyer borrows the money to buy the
company, then pays off the debt either through company revenue or
selling off parts of the operation.
   Today's editions of the Wall Street Journal quoted people
familiar with the management group's strategy as saying it intends
to utterly transform the tobacco-and-food conglomerate, largely by
divesting as much of its non-tobacco businesses as necessary to pay
off debt.
   Like other tobacco companies, Nabisco's stock has been driven
lower by worries over cigarette liability suits. `Valuing Nabisco
as a food company and discounting the tobacco operation, I arrive
at a value somewhere between $85 and $90'' a share, said Pavlos
Alexandrakis, an analyst with Argus Research Corp. in New York.
   If the deal were completed, it would be the biggest leveraged
buyout of an American corporation, widely surpassing the $6.1
billion buyout of Beatrice Cos. by an investment group led by
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. in 1986.
   It also would top the biggest corporate acquisition, the $13.4
billion purchase of Gulf Corp. by Chevron Corp. in 1984.
   In the quarter ended Sept. 30, Nabisco said it earned $355
million on sales of $4.16 billion, compared to $320 million in
profits and sales of $3.84 billion in the same quarter last year.
   Income from tobacco operations was $497 million in the quarter
on sales of $1.78 billion, while food income accounted for $276
million on $2.38 billion in sales.
   RJR Nabisco was formed when the tobacco company R.J. Reynolds
Industries Inc. bought Nabisco Brands Inc., the food and consumer
products giant, for $4.9 billion in 1985. Today the company ranks
as the nation's 19th largest industrial concern.
   Johnson came to the conglomerate from Nabisco and last year
shifted the company's headquarters from Winston-Salem, N.C., to
Atlanta in a move seen as an attempt to distance the company from
its tobacco beginnings.
   Among the company's major products are Salem cigarettes, Lorna
Doone and Mallomar cookies, Chuckles and Junior Mints candy, Del
Monte vegetables and Milk-Bone dog biscuits.
   Nabisco currently is test-marketing a smokeless cigarette,
Premier.
   In 1987, RJR Nabisco had profits of $1.18 billion on sales of
$15.77 billion. That level of sales would make RJR Nabisco the
third largest privately held company in the country according to
Forbes magazine, behind Cargill, a commodity trading company, and
Safeway Stores Inc., the grocery chain.
   In the past few years, the company has sold off divisions,
including Kentucky Fried Chicken, that did not fit with its
long-range plans.

   An unusual twist occurred in the most recent job
survey by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. It could be an
aberration, but if it isn't, it is worth watching.
   This is it:
   The civilian jobless rate fell from 5.6 percent in August to 5.4
percent in September, a move that at first glance might suggest the
economy was overheating.
   Overheating in this sense generally refers to two factors: The
rate of industrial production and the unemployment rate.
   As industrial production reaches capacity it means the least
productive plants are brought into service, thus forcing up costs.
And as the jobless rate falls it means a tighter labor pool,
perhaps leading to wage increases.
   This time, however, the falling jobless rate did not suggest
upward pressure on wages. In fact, there has been little
inflationary pressure from wages all year long. But it did scare up
a ghost that might require equal vigilance.
   The situation is described in Commissioner Janet L. Norwood's
statement to the Joint Economic Committee of Congress on Oct. 7:
   ``A large portion of the overall payroll employment increase _
nearly 40 percent _ was in state and local government, reflecting a
stronger than usual expansion in public school jobs at the
beginning of the new school year.
   ``In contrast, the private sector, which grew strongly earlier
in the year, exhibited relatively small gains.''
   That situation offers what could be good news and bad.
   The good news is that no further inflationary pressure was
placed on the economy by a tightening of labor supplies in the
private sector. The bad news is that government employment, which
can be very expensive, may be growing.
   Further figures are necessary to confirm the September
experience as a trend, but many analysts will be keeping an eye on
it. Less than a decade ago, you may recall, many state and local
governments were in bad financial shape.
   Controlling employment always has been one of the most difficult
tasks of government at all levels, in part because it takes
manpower to cut manpower. This is bureaucracy; like individuals, it
puts on weight while trying to diet.
   The rise still might turn out to be insignificant. It could be
nothing more than a methodological miscue. Moreover, there was some
very good news in the October report, that is, less inflationary
pressure on industry.
   That latter conclusion comes from a glance at the employment
breakdown, which shows the private sector had relatively small
employments gains, after growing strongly earlier in the year.
   Private-sector business employment grew at an average rate of
only 120,000 a month in August and September, compared with more
than 300,000 a month during the first seven months of the year.
   In short, the supply of workers was barely tapped in those two
months, which means that little further inflationary pressure was
added. At the same time, workers managed to keep their jobs,
another desirable outcome.
   But that big increase in state and local government workers
could be a source of future problems, especially in regard to taxes
and budgets.

   The stock market pulled back a bit today,
running into some resistance at its highest levels since last
year's crash.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 5.34 to 2,175.85
in the first half hour of trading.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by more than 5 to 4 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 392 up, 503
down and 525 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 30.68 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Analysts said ``buyout fever'' prompted heavy demand for stocks
on Thursday after several takeover and buyout proposals were
announced in recent days.
   But some observers question whether this is a sustainable
positive force for the market, noting that it draws speculative
buying in the hope of short-term gains rather than long-term
investment money.
   Brokers also said the market in general was weighed down by a
disappointing earnings report from Digital Equipment, a prominent
technology company.
   Digital, which said sales of its high-end computer systems were
below expectations, dropped 3{ to 87| in active trading.
   Among other leading computer and technology issues,
International Business Machines slipped ] to 124{ and
Hewlett-Packard was down { at 51\.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks lost
.20 to 158.81. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was off .37 at 306.00.
   On Thursday the Dow Jones industrial average jumped 43.92 to
2,181.19, surpassing the previous 1988 closing high of 2,159.85
reached on Tuesday.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 5 to 2 on the
NYSE, with 1,051 up, 418 down and 496 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 189.58 million shares, against 186.35
million in the previous session.

<TEXT>
   The eight oil ministers serving on OPEC's
pricing and strategy committees ended a second day of talks without
comment Friday, but sources said a third session was planned for
Saturday.
   No details of Friday's two-hour session would be made public,
the sources said.
   The committees of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries are trying to come up with the framework for a new
production control agreement that would end the current oversupply
of oil and help stabilize prices.
   Overproduction by OPEC members has had oil prices swerving in
recent weeks between $12 and $16 a barrel, far below the cartel's
target of $18.
   Current daily output by the cartel is estimated at close to 21
million barrels a day, substantially above the cartel's official
ceiling of 15.06 million barrels a day, a total that covers all but
one of its 13 members.
   Following Friday's session, the ministers were each expected to
meet with their staffs and hold separate bilateral meetings,
according to OPEC sources, who agreed to discuss the session only
if not identified.
   The pricing committee consists of the oil ministers of Algeria,
Saudi Arabia, Nigeria, Indonesia and Venezuela, while the strategy
committee includes the ministers of Iraq, Iran, Saudi Arabia,
Kuwait and Venezuela.
   OPEC Secretary-General Subroto told reporters Friday that more
meetings of the two committees were expected before the full OPEC
meeting scheduled for Nov. 21.
   Subroto also said he did not rule out the possibility of a full
OPEC meeting even before next month's planned gathering.
   Before the 90-minute meeting late Thursday, oil ministers of
Nigeria, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela all said they would accept a
new production agreement only if it included Iraq.
   Iraq has refused to be a part of the current production system
because it was not given a quota equal to Iran, its Persian Gulf
enemy in an eight-year war that was stopped by their cease-fire
agreement in August.
   However, Iranian Oil Minister Gholamreza Aqazadeh said Thursday
that his country would not accept production parity with Iraq.
   The oil ministers of Iran and Iraq sat down together Thursday
for the first time in an OPEC setting since the cease-fire.
   The remaining OPEC members are Ecuador, Gabon, Libya, Qatar and
the United Arab Emirates.

<HEAD>Fare Philosophy: Fly Most Passengers Possible at Highest Possible
Fares</HEAD>
<HEAD>With BC-Deregulation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Along with airline deregulation has come a
sometimes puzzling array of fares, but industry experts say there's
a reason to all this madness: ``yield management.''
   Simply put, says Barbara Amster, American Airlines' vice
president in charge of yield management, the objective ``is
maximize revenue by flying the most passengers possible at the
highest fares possible.''
   The computer driven art of yield management is a new phenomenon
in the airline industry, but one which industry experts say is
central to an airline's success in the free marketplace.
   But travelers paying up to 10 times as much for a seat as the
passenger next to them think it's unfair.
   Before the government stopped telling airlines how much to
charge, the system was simple: A coach seat cost one fare and first
class another. Prices were determined by a Civil Aeronautics Board
formula which was somewhat based on how much the flight cost the
airline, although airlines were allowed to charge more on some
routes to make up for losses in other markets.
   Today, said Ms. Amster, ``the actual cost of producing the
product and the fares paid by a customer actually have very little
to do with one another. That's very unfortunate, but that's the way
it is.''
   As a result, it is not unusual for a single flight to have more
than a dozen different fares, depending on the level of discount
which in turn depends largely on how flexible _ or inconvenienced _
a traveler is willing to be.
   The competing airline has a say as well.
   Pan American World Airways, trying to drum up business at Dulles
International Airport outside Washington, offered a $198 roundtrip
fare to Los Angeles, beginning next month. All of its competitors
have matched the fare, but are only making a limited number of
seats available at that price _ only enough to keep Pan Am from
stealing its customers.
   Meanwhile, an unrestricted fare from Washington to Los Angeles
still costs either $1,100 roundtrip if a traveler wants the luxury
of flying direct or less than half that _ $488 on United if flying
through Chicago or Denver _ if the passenger is willing to stop
over at an intermediary hub airport.
   ``Airline pricing has become more like gaming than anything
else,'' says Ms. Amster. If an airline decides to cut fares to
attract business along a particular route, the other carrier is
likely to match it _ but not always, only if it appears the price
cuts would result in a substantial loss of business or market share.
   The airlines treat a seat as a ``perishible'' commodity that
will be worthless once a plane takes to the air. It's better to
fill it with a customer paying $128 roundtrip on a flight from
Washington to Charleston, than have the seat go empty, say the
yield management experts. Unless, that is, you can get someone who
has to fly right away to pay $390, or somewhere in between with
only two days' notice.
   The art of yield management depends on sophisticated computers
that track how many people are likely to fly a particular route,
who can plan ahead and who can't, what the competition has
available and is charging; how much a traveler is willing to pay
for not flying nonstop instead of through a hub; and how much he is
likely to pay for departing from an airport closer to town instead
of in the countryside.
   ``What computers have allowed (the airlines) to do is price seat
by seat and flight by flight,'' says Patricia Bailey, who as a
former member of the Civil Aeronautics Board remembers the days
when the government controlled airline pricing.
   The new system has caused some intriguing fares.
   A person can fly from Washington to Chicago using the maximum
discount for $188 roundtrip. But for only $5 more he can continue
on to Green Bay, Wis.
   That same trip to Chicago can be taken sometime between 12:01
a.m. on a Saturday and midnight Saturday for $228 roundtrip without
any restrictions, but if some other day is chosen, the fare can be
as high as $635 _ that is if you fly into Chicago's O'Hare airport.
If you fly into Midway airport, which is closer to downtown, an
unrestricted ticket is $32 cheaper.
   And then there are these fares that have perplexed Jay Angoff, a
former antitrust lawyer at the Federal Trade Commission:
   He said Delta told him it would cost $395 to fly from Washington
to Denver, but only $278 from Washington to Los Angeles with a stop
in Denver. He found that it cost $395 to fly TWA from St. Louis to
Los Angeles and $305 to fly from St. Louis to Washington. But a TWA
flight from Washington to Los Angeles throught St. Louis was only
$278 when discounted.
   The fares even have confused Alfred Kahn, the former CAB
chairman who is widely considered the architect of airline
deregulation.
   He sought the help of his travel agent recenty and found two
fares for a flight from Buffalo to New York City on USAir. With
unrestricted travel it costs either $99 or $131, he said, but ``my
travel agent doesn't understand why there are two.''

<TEXT>
   It was 10 days before Christmas when Harold
``Hap'' Pareti discovered the airline world's version of the
800-pound gorilla was about to land on him.
   Pareti, chairman of Presidential Airways, a fledging carrier
that had carved a small niche at Dulles International Airport
outside Washington with hopes of growing larger, was about to get
an education into what competition is really like in a free-market
airline industry.
   United Airlines announced that day in mid-December 1985 that
within months it was putting a major hub at Dulles and expanding
its flights from 15 to 58 a day, and eventually to 87 a day.
   Pareti recalls his dreams being doomed.
   Presidential, 3 years old this month, today flies under the
marketing name of United Express and banks its future on feeding
passengers to United's jetliners. It remains independently owned,
but there is no doubt that United calls the shots.
   Pareti's rough-and-tumble experiences provide a unique insight
into the state of competition in today's deregulated airline
industry. While the government no longer bars an airline from
flying any route it chooses, economic realities often do.
   So powerful are the half-dozen major ``mega-airlines'' that many
aviation experts believe it would be folly to start a new airline
today. According to a Congressional Budget Office report, of the 22
airlines that began interstate service in the past 10 years, only
five survive. No new airline has been launched since l985.
   ``It would be extremely difficult to start something from
scratch today,'' said Pareti, who was among those who founded
People Express and later became its president before quitting and
starting Presidential. ``There was a window (of opportunity) and
the window closed a few years ago.''
   And Pareti bemoans the development.
   ``I think it's bad. There's got to be that threat of entry and
that threat of price competition. And I don't think that's the case
in the airline industry anymore.''
   United Express is not what Pareti had dreamed of for
Presidential Airways when he and a small group of investors started
the airline in October l985. They had hopes of building a regional
airline much as those who in earlier years had started Piedmont and
Allegheny (later USAir) ``by flying where the big boys didn't.''
   ``That was the plan,'' recalls Pareti in an interview in his
Presidential Airways office overlooking the main runway at Dulles.
   The Boeing 737 was Pareti's choice of a plane and he had leased
13 of them. In late l985 and early '86, the jets flew to such
cities as Indianapolis, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Boston, Hartford,
even Montreal, and south to Florida _ always through Dulles.
   The airline was not yet making money as 1986 began, but it was
on its way, he says.
   But early that year, United began its expansion at Dulles, New
York Air shifted 10 aircraft from New York to Dulles, and Pareti's
dream began to fall apart.
   Wherever Presidential flew, so did United, New York Air and
USAir, which also stepped up services to some of the cities
targeted by Pareti. Even worse, if Presidential shifted to a new
city and proved to be successful, it was sure to attract the same
larger, stronger competitors.
   Dulles, which once had been ignored because it was too far in
the Virginia suburbs from downtown Washington, became the fastest
growing airport in the country. But with the new competition,
Presidential's jets flew with too many empty seats.
   ``It was a great dream, but the reality was we were losing too
many bucks a month to realize that dream,'' Pareti recalls.
   So, he began dancing, weaving and skipping to survive. He
lowered the profile of Presidential, replaced its Boeing 737s with
new, quieter and smaller British Aerospace BAe-146 jets, and bought
a small commuter for its fleet of propeller planes.
   He abandoned ideas of beginning a charter jet service, primarily
to haul military personnel, although Presidential still has one
Boeing 737 being chartered to the presidential campaign of Michael
Dukakis. A $6 million mid-field terminal at Dulles, which
Presidential built, was put up for sale.
   In early 1987, Continental Airlines became its partner, but
within a year Continental, which had bought Newark-based People
Express, shifted most of its flights to Newark, leaving
Presidential to founder.
   The first weeks of l988 were the low point, Pareti says.
Presidential still was flying as Continental Express, but no longer
served as a connector. Two-thirds of its seats flew empty and
Presidential's stock, which had sold for $5 a share in 1985,
tumbled as low as 37 cents a share.
   The airline was losing $2.2 million a month and ``if everyone
had said `Pay cash on the barrelhead.' it could have put us
under,'' he recalls. But in January he reached agreement with
United and began flying as United Express in February.
   ``Presidential Airways survives!'' began Pareti's letter to
stockholders last April. After $88 million in losses, the airline
reported its first quarterly profit, $1.3 million, in the second
quarter of this year.
   But the airline is far from what Pareti had envisoned. Its
relationship with United is cordial. But, admits Geoffrey Crowley,
Presidential's senior vice president for marketing, ``Big Brother
calls the shots.''
   This summer one of Presidential's most profitable routes was
Washington to Portland, Maine. It was so profitable that United
took it over with its own jet service, forcing Presidential to
shift to Worchester, Mass., a city not nearly as desirable.
   But Pareti, who put $500,000 of his own money into starting
Presidential, does not look back: ``You see it starting to work
now. You're starting to make some money. And you know you're one of
the handful of survivors.''

   After falling sharply in Asian trading, the U.S.
dollar was trading steadily at lower levels in Europe Friday
against all major currencies except the British pound and Canadian
dollar.
   Foreign exchange dealers said there weren't any new fundamental
factors explaining the dollar's sharp slide to its lowest trading
level in five months against the West German mark and its lowest in
more than three months against the Swiss, French, Italian and Dutch
currencies.
   ``It's just the general bearishness that has been building up in
recent weeks,'' said a senior dealer at a large West German bank in
Frankfurt.
   Another dealer at a U.S. bank in Frankfurt said trading was
mostly dominated by technical factors.
   A trader with a major Italian commercial bank in Milan
predicted, ``The dollar's going to fall more next week, but not
much more today.''
   He said that as traders squared their positions ahead of the
weekend, the dollar could even recover strength.
   Dealers said the bearish dollar in Tokyo reflected the
currency's poor showing in London and New York on Thursday.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar fell 0.75 yen to a closing 126.40 yen. Later, in
London, it was quoted at 126.60 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Thursday's
rates: 1.7923 West German marks, down from 1.8005; 1.5155 Swiss
francs, down from 1.5210; 6.1215 French francs, down from 6.1630;
2.0160 Dutch guilders, down from 2.0320; 1,334.25 Italian lire,
down from 1,341.50; and 1.1998 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1982.
   In London, the dollar gained against the British pound. It cost
1.7575 dollars to buy one pound, cheaper than 1.7635 dollars late
Thursday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $411.00 a troy ounce and
at midmorning, the city's five major bullion dealers fixed a
recommended price of $410.55. Both were down from Thursday's late
bid of $412.00 an ounce.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $410.40 an ounce, down from $411.50
bid late Thursday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $1.34 an ounce to close at a
bid $413.15.
   Silver was quoted in London today at a bid price of $6.33 a troy
ounce, down from Thursday's $6.35.

   A rekindling of higher food costs brought on
by the drought sent retail prices up 0.3 percent last month, the
Labor Department said today. Nearly balancing the steeper grocery
prices was the sharpest drop in gasoline costs since February.
   The overall consumer price rise was considered moderate and was
down a notch from the 0.4 percent rises of July and August. The
good news was that gasoline prices dropped 1.7 percent; the bad
news was that food prices rose 0.8 percent.
   More significant than any of those numbers for some 38.4 million
Americans was the effect today's report will have on their Social
Security checks beginning in January.
   Those checks will be up 4.0 percent _ or $21 a month for the
average recipient. That will be the second highest boost in the
last 6{ years.
   Breaking down the new report, the department said two components
_ food and clothing _ accounted for 70 percent of the September
increase.
   On grocery store shelves, consumers saw fruit and vegetable
prices climb 4.5 percent, with most of that reflecting residual
effects from the summer's drought.
   Also rising were beef prices, up 1.1 percent, and poultry
prices, up 1.3 percent. Poultry is now 23.7 percent more costly
than at the beginning of 1988.
   The overall gain in food prices was up dramatically from a 0.5
percent August advance and was the sharpest since a 0.9 percent
July gain, which had also been blamed on the drought.
   The other bad news: Clothing costs shot up 2.2 percent as prices
for nearly all items of apparel reflected higher prices for fall
and winter lines.
   Drivers, however, found significant good news in today's report.
September's steep drop in gasoline prices sent pump prices 27.3
percent below their peak of March 1981.
   Home heating oil costs were down 2.1 percent while the price of
natural gas and electricity, taken together, rose 0.6 percent.
   The 0.3 percent rise in the overall Consumer Price Index, if it
persisted for 12 months, would amount to an annual inflation rate
of 4.1 percent. From January through September, prices rose at an
annual rate of 4.5 percent, up a notch from the 4.4 percent gain
posted for all of 1987.
   Economists expect this moderation in prices to continue for the
balance of 1988 as falling energy rices should counter further
drought-driven food price gains.
   Indeed, last week's report on wholesale prices for September
showed that food prices one step short of the retail level shot up
1.2 percent while energy prices plummeted 3.3 percent.
   Stacy Kottman, an economist at Georgia State University,
predicted that consumer prices for all of 1988 would rise by around
4.2 percent, even better than the 1987 performance. He said
consumers should continue seeing the benefits of lower world crude
oil prices, caused by the disarray among energy-exporting countries
who have been unable to stick to production quotas.
   ``We believe we will see rather stable consumer prices for the
near future,'' he said. ``We expect crude oil prices to stay at
levels below where they were at the beginning of the summer for the
next several months and that will more than offset the drought
influences on the food supply.''
   The September inflation data triggered an automatic 4.0 percent
cost-of-living benefit increase for Social Security recipients.
That was down slightly form the 4.2 percent increase paid to the
elderly, blind and disabled Americans who receive checks each month.
   The government calculates the benefit increase based on the
change in one portion of the Consumer Price Index _ wages paid to
urban workers _ from July through September of one year to the same
period of the following year.
   Benefits have risen automatically with the Consumer Price Index
since 1975, with the exception of six months in 1983 that were
skipped to help bail the Social Security System out of a financial
crisis.
   As for prices last month, the Labor Department offered these
specifics:
   _New cars, up 0.6 percent.
   _Used cars, up 0.1 percent.
   _Housing, up 0.3 percent.
   _Medical care, up 0.6 percent.
   Health care costs have risen 6.6 percent over the last 12
months, the largest increase for any of the major components of the
price calculation.
   The September gain, overall, left the Consumer Price Index for
all urban consumers at 119.8, meaning that a hypothetical selection
of goods and services costing $10 on average from 1982 through 1984
would have cost $11.98 last month.
   The index, unlike other data in the report, is not adjusted for
periodic, predictable seasonal variations.
   The index for urban wage earners, which is the number used in
the Social Security cost-of-living calculations, rose 4.0 percent
from the third quarter of 1987 to the same period this year.

<HEAD>Wheat, Soybean Futures Post Early Gains; Corn Down</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wheat and soybean futures posted slight early
gains today on the Chicago Board of Trade while corn prices were
marginally lower in quiet trading that contrasted sharply with the
heavy selling of Thursday afternoon.
   Soybean prices, which fell as much as 22 cents a bushel on
Thursday, steadied this morning in response to the government's
weekly export sales report showing soybean exports at their highest
level since summer, analysts said.
   Wheat drew support from confirmation of China's
400,000-metric-ton purchase of U.S. wheat, a sale that had been
expected for several days.
   The corn market, although slightly lower, apparently was mostly
recovered from the dismay caused by rumors Thursday that the Soviet
Union had spurned a shipment of U.S. corn due to the presence of
aflatoxin, a carcinogenic fungus.
   U.S. exporter Cargill Inc. denied the rumor but analysts said a
Soviet rejection of a grain shipment was not unlikely.
   ``The Russians tend to be fairly picky about the quality of the
stuff they're buying and since they are the major buyer in a
buyer's market, they can get away with it,'' said Walter Spilka,
grain analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co. in New York.
   In early trading, wheat was 1\ cents to 1} cents higher with the
contract for delivery in December at $4.24} a bushel; corn was \
cent to 1 cent lower with December at $2.85{ a bushel; oats were }
cent lower to { cent higher with December at $2.54 a bushel;
soybeans were 1 cent lower to 4 cents higher with November at
$7.86{ a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were mostly lower in early trading on
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .40 cent lower to .12 cent higher with December
at 74.37 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .15 cent lower to .10
cent higher with October at 81.70 cents a pound; live hogs were .05
cent to .37 cent lower with December at 41.80 cents a pound; frozen
pork bellies were .10 cent lower to .45 cent higher with February
at 48.97 cents a pound.
   Cattle futures settled mostly higher while pork futures were
mixed on Thursday.

<HEAD>Quaker Posts Gains in Its First Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Quaker Oats Co. said Friday its first-quarter
profit rose 18 percent over the same period last year due to strong
sales by all three major business units, especially International
Grocery Products.
   For the three-month fiscal 1989 quarter ended Sept. 30, Quaker's
net earnings totaled 48.7 million, or 61 cents a share, up from
$41.1 million, or 52 cents a share, for the same period a year ago.
Revenue for the period totaled $1.4 billion, up 13 percent from
$1.2 billion in the year-earlier quarter.
   ``The strong first quarter gets us off to an excellent start for
fiscal 1989,'' William D. Smithburg, chairman and chief executive
officer, said in a statement.
   Smithburg said all three major business units contributed to the
growth, most notably International Grocery Products. Its sales of
$273.3 million were up 12 percent in the first quarter compared
with last year, and its operating income rose 69 percent, to $24.9
million from $14.7 million.
   Both European and Latin American operations made strong gains,
with increased sales and lower advertising and merchandising
expenses, the company said.
   Quaker's other units are its U.S. and Canadian Grocery Products,
which make such items as Gatorade, Quaker cereals, and Celeste
pizza, all of which posted first-quarter gains; and Fisher-Price,
which makes toys. The company also said its Fun with Food line
showed impressive gains.

<HEAD>To Order $1.78 Billion Worth of Boeing Jets</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   British Airways PLC announced Friday it has agreed
to place orders for at least 31 Boeing Co. jets worth at least
$1.78 billion to replace part of its aging fleet of commercial
aircraft.
   British Airways said it chose Boeing over other contenders for
the orders, including the European consortium Airbus Industrie,
partly because of the compatibility of the new jets with the
airline's existing fleet of 170 planes, which already is dominated
by Boeing aircraft.
   British Airways said the two companies have so far signed a
memorandum of understanding. A purchase contract is to be signed
once British Airways obtains necessary financing, the airline said.
   British Airways has agreed to order 24 B737s, six B767-300s, and
one Boeing 757.
   The airline also has reserved options on an additional 11 B737s,
one B757 and six B767s. The company said it plans to exercise at
least nine of these options.
   The agreement also covers spare parts and spare engines, with
the minimum value of the deal estimated at $1.78 billion.
   The B737s under order will be powered by the CFM 56-3 engine,
manufactured by General Electric Co. and France's Societe Nationale
d'Etude et de Construction de Moteurs d'Aviation, the airline said.
These jets are due to begin service in the autumn of 1991.
   The B767s and 757 will be powered by Rolls-Royce PLC engines.
   The new aircraft will replace British Airways' existing fleet of
39 BAC 1-11s and will be used mainly for destinations within
Britain and in Europe.
   The B737s have varying capacities ranging from 105 seats to 145
seats. The BAC 1-11 seats either 75 passengers or 99 passengers.
   British Airways said the decision to order the Boeing jets over
the Airbus A320 was taken ``on purely commercial grounds.''
   The Boeing package offered ``greater flexibility, compatibility
with our existing fleet and competitive economics,'' British
Airways said.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar drifted steadily lower against
most major currencies in moderate European trading Friday amid
bearish sentiment and with a lack of economic news to change its
course.
   Gold prices fell.
   Foreign exchange dealers said the unit received some support
late in the day from fears of central bank intervention.
   Still, London dealers were surprised by the descent,
particularly since there has not been much of an expected technical
bounce-back since the dollar began its fall nearly three weeks ago.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar fell 0.75 yen to a closing 126.40 yen. Later, in
London, it was quoted at 126.70 yen.
   Other late dollar rates, compared with late Thursday's rates,
included: 1.7875 West German marks, down from 1.8005; 1.5135 Swiss
francs, down from 1.5210; 6.1115 French francs, down from 6.1630;
2.0170 Dutch guilders, down from 2.0320; 1,332.50 Italian lire,
down from 1,341.50; and 1.2022 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1982.
   In London, the dollar gained slightly against the British pound.
It cost $1.7620 to buy one pound, cheaper than $1.7635 late
Thursday.
   Gold fell in London to a bid price of $410.15 a troy ounce, down
from Thursday's late bid of $412.00.
   In Zurich, the late bid price was $409.40, down from $411.50 bid
late Thursday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $1.34 to close at a bid $413.15.
   Silver was quoted in London Friday at a late bid price of $6.28
a troy ounce, down from Thursday's $6.35.

   The stock market declined slightly today,
running into some resistance at its highest levels since last

   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which climbed 43.92

Holly would attract a higher bid.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
.02 to 159.03. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value

   Share prices on the London Stock Exchange ended
slightly lower after a mild day of trading Friday as players sought
to consolidate positions and contemplate the market's next move.
   Dealers said the healthy advances over the course of the week
exhausted many participants.
   ``We overbought the market this week, so what you're seeing
today is a bit of unwinding,'' one trader said.
   By the close, the FT-SE 100-share index was down 5.0 points, or
.27 percent, at 1859.3.
   Traders in London also mentioned that activity on Wall Street
weighed on London equities. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was
off 13.51 points at 2167.67 as the London session came to a close.
   One dealer said the annual Mansion House speech by Chancellor of
the Exchequer Nigel Lawson on Thursday night gave the market a
bearish tone.
   ``He's tring to talk the economy and the pound lower,'' the
dealer said.
   The main declining stock was Consolidated Gold Fields, which ran
up sharply late Thursday on various rumors affecting Minorco's 2.9
billion-pound bid. Consolidated Gold's shares lost 15 at 12.60
pounds as the market awaits the British government's decision,
which could be announced next week, on whether the bid should be
investigated by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.

   The stock market was mixed today, running into
some resistance at its highest levels since last year's crash.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which climbed 43.92
points Thursday, dropped back 2.85 to 2,178.34 by 3 p.m. today on
Wall Street.
   Gainers slightly outnumbered losers in nationwide trading of New
York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 710 up, 696 down and 523
unchanged.
   Analysts said ``buyout fever'' prompted heavy demand for stocks
on Thursday after several takeover and buyout proposals were
announced in recent days.
   But some observers question whether this is a sustainable
positive force for the market, noting that it draws speculative
buying in the hope of short-term gains rather than long-term
investment money.
   Brokers also said the market in general was weighed down by a
disappointing earnings report from Digital Equipment, a prominent
technology company.
   Digital, which said sales of its high-end computer systems were
below expectations, dropped 3} to 87] in active trading.
   Among other leading computer and technology issues,
International Business Machines fell ] to 124{ and Hewlett-Packard
was down ] at 51].
   Holly Farms climbed 3 to 53~. Tyson Foods began a hostile tender
offer for the company at $52 a share amid much speculation that
Holly would attract a higher bid.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
.18 to 159.19. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was off .67 at 305.70.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 150.39 million shares with an
hour to go.

   Grain and soybean futures closed moderately lower
Friday on the Chicago Board of Trade in a late sell-off linked to
beneficial rains in Brazil's soybean country and bearish chart
signals in the wheat market.
   Wheat prices were nearly unchanged at noon but closed 1\ hours
later as much as 5\ cents a bushel below Thursday's final prices. A
similar late drop occurred in the soybean market.
   Wheat prices ``looked toppy'' and were due for a technical
correction after climbing last week to $4.38 a bushel for December
delivery, said Walter Spilka, a grain analyst with Smith Barney,
Harris Upham & Co. in New York.
   ``The fact that winter wheat is being planted under good
conditions is also a negative and the export market, despite some
purchases this morning, does not look all that rosy,'' he said.
   News that heavy rains had relieved dry rowing conditions in
northern Brazil put pressure on the soybean market, Spilka said,
and corn futures retreated in a continuing reaction to Thursday's
rumor that the Soviet Union had spurned a shipment of U.S. corn due
to the presence of aflatoxin, a carcinogenic mold.
   At the close, wheat was 1 cent to 5\ cents lower with the
contract for delivery in December at $4.19{ a bushel; corn was }
cent to 3 cents lower with December at $2.83{ a bushel; oats were
4{ cents lower to 1\ cents higher with December at $2.50\ a bushel;
soybeans were unchanged to 10{ cents lower with November at $7.74 a
bushel.

<HEAD>Report: Eastern, Machinists Discuss Stock-Pay Swap</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Texas Air Corp. Chairman Frank Lorenzo and Eastern
Airlines Machinists union chief Charles Bryan met this week to
discuss a deal that would swap stock in ailing Eastern for employee
pay cuts, The Miami News reported Friday.
   The two adversaries in Eastern's bitter labor battles met
Tuesday in Houston, the News said.
   They had agreed earlier to meet if financier Carl Icahn, the
chairman of Trans World Airlines Inc., decided not to buy
Miami-based Eastern, Bryan said Thursday. On Monday, Icahn broke
off efforts to acquire Eastern, a subsidiary of Texas Air, after
failing to structure a deal that would satisfy the carrier's unions.
   Bryan, whose Machinists union represents about 8,500 Eastern
workers, would not confirm that he and Lorenzo committed themselves
to wage reductions or employee stock ownership, saying only that
``everything was very general in nature.''
   Bryan said no other potential Eastern buyers are on the horizon,
and added he probably will get together again with Lorenzo.
   There are ``a lot of tentative meetings set with different
people,'' Bryan said.
   Tuesday's meeting could have signaled a cooling in Eastern's
prolonged labor dispute. For nearly two years, Lorenzo and Bryan
have been at loggerheads over Lorenzo's efforts to lower
machinists' wages at Eastern.

<HEAD>Honeywell Posts Net Loss Of $22.2 Million In Its Third Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Honeywell Inc. said Friday it lost $22.2
million in the third quarter, mainly as a result of writeoffs in a
defense aviation electronics unit acquired from Unisys Corp.
   Honeywell last week announced it was suing Unisys for more than
$350 million in damages related to alleged misstatements in
financial statements of the Sperry Aerospace Group, which Honeywell
bought from Unisys in December 1986.
   Honeywell said it took pre-tax charges of $108 million in the
third quarter, mainly in the Defense Avionics Systems Division,
which is based in Albuquerque, N.M., and was bought from Unisys.
   The charges were to cover cost overruns that should have been
recognized earlier as well as losses caused by underbidding on
contracts, spokeswoman Susan Eich said.
   Honeywell makes controls for homes, buildings, industry, space
and aviation as well as defense and marine markets. It has 79,000
employees worldwide.
   In the third quarter of 1987, Honeywell posted a profit of $69.6
million, or $1.59 a share. Sales in the quarter rose to $1.73
billion from $1.64 billion. The quarter also included a one-time
gain of $12 million from real estate.
   Nine-month net income was $67.1 million, compared with $167.6
million in the first nine months of 1987. Nine-month earnings per
share were $1.58, compared with $3.76 last year. Total sales for
the first nine months of 1988 were $5.213 billion, compared with
$4.69 billion in 1987.
   Third-quarter operating profit was up substantially in the
Industrial Automation and Control business, with particular
strength in international markets.
   Home and Building Automation and Control operating profit
declined slightly in the quarter, but was well ahead for the
nine-month period.
   International Homes and Buildings operating profit was up for
both the quarter and nine months.
   Defense and Marine Systems operating profit was down in the
quarter, but was up year-to-date.

<HEAD>Social Security Checks Going Up Average $21 in January</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's 38.4 million Social Security
recipients can count on a 4 percent increase in their benefits
starting next January that will boost the average retired worker's
pension by $21 a month, the government announced Friday.
   The increase, the second largest in 6{ years, will mean the
typical benefit payment will go from $516 to $537 per month.
   Offsetting the good news on benefit increases was a $7.10 hike
in Medicare premiums, which will rise to $31.90 a month starting in
January. They are deducted directly from the monthly benefits.
   The exact size of the increase became official Friday when the
Labor Department announced the latest change in the Consumer Price
Index.
   Since 1975, Social Security benefits have risen automatically
each year with the CPI with the exception of six months in 1983
that were skipped to help bail the system out of a crisis.
   The 4 percent increase, which will show up in the Jan. 3 benefit
checks, followed a 4.2 percent increase which took effect last
January. The two increases were the largest since a 7.4 percent
rise in July 1982, back when high inflation rates translated into
bigger cost-of-living hikes.
   Social Security officials said the maximum monthly benefit for a
worker retiring in 1988 at age 65 will rise $61, from $838 to $899.
   The 4.5 million recipients of Supplemental Security Income, a
welfare program for the aged, blind or disabled, also will get a 4
percent increase in their benefit payments.
   The maximum federal SSI payment will rise by $14, from $354 to
$368, for an individual, and by $21, from $532 to $553, for a poor
couple.
   The change in Social Security benefits is calculated by taking
increases in the CPI for urban wage earners for the July-September
period, compared with the same period in the previous year.
   The agency gave the following examples of how the 4.0 percent
increase will affect average monthly benefits:
   _All retired workers, up $21, from $516 to $537.
   _Aged couple, both getting benefits, up $38, from $883 to $921.
   _Widowed mother and two children, up $42, from $1,070 to $1,112.
   _Disabled worker, spouse and children, up $41, from $902 to $943.
   _All disabled workers, up $20, from $509 to $529.
   The Social Security Administration also announced that the
maximum amount of wages subject to the payroll tax will climb from
the current $45,000 to $48,000 in 1989. The wage base, the amount
subject to the tax, has gone up every year since 1971.
   The latest change means the maximum annual Social Security tax
paid by high income workers will rise by $225.30 to $3,604.80.
Employers pay the same amount each worker pays.
   The change in the wage cap will affect about 9 million of the
130 million workers covered by Social Security.
   The payroll tax rate will remain unchanged at 7.51 percent
during 1989. But it will rise to 7.65 percent on Jan. 1, 1990, the
final increase planned at this time. Those changes were adopted by
Congress in 1983 as part of a bipartisan plan to bail the system
out of recurrent financing problems.
   Tax rates for the self-employed remain unchanged at 13.02
percent for 1989, but the amount subject to tax will rise to
$48,000.
   Social Security Commissioner Dorcas R. Hardy said the latest
benefit increase ``ensures that America's elderly and disabled are
able to maintain their purchasing power as the price of necessary
goods and services rise.''
   Officials said the cost-of-living increase will boost Social
Security payments by $8.7 billion in 1989.
   Here are some other changes for 1989 that the agency announced:
   _Retirees ages 65-69 will be able to earn $8,880 without losing
benefits, up from $8,400 currently.
   _Beneficiaries under 65 will be able to earn $6,480 without
penalty, up from $6,120.
   _Workers will need to earn $500 for a quarter of coverage, up
from $470.
   Benefits are rounded down to the next dollar, which means most
people wind up with an increase slightly smaller than the exact
inflation rate.
   In addition, most SSI beneficiaries also get regular Social
Security, and their entitlement to welfare benefits usually goes
down when their Social Security check goes up.
   Many economists contend that Social Security benefits will have
to be curbed next year as part of a renewed effort by the next
administration to reduce the country's huge budget deficits.
   However, both Michael Dukakis and George Bush have competed with
each other to assure voters that they will not touch Social
Security benefits.

<DATELINE>ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Postmaster General Anthony Frank on
Friday officially issued a 21-cent postage stamp commemorating
Chester Carlson, the inventor of the xerographic copying process.
   ``For me, a trip to Rochester is like a pilgrimage to the Holy
Land,'' he said, reminding the crowd at a downtown shopping mall
that copiers play a significant role in generating the 160 billion
pieces of mail the postal service delivers each year.
   Saturday marks the 50th anniversary of xerography, which Carlson
invented on Oct. 22, 1938.
   Rochester was the birthplace of the Xerox Corp. and remains the
home of the company's largest manufacturing plant. The headquarters
of the company left Rochester in 1969 and is located in Stamford,
Conn.
   The new stamp, one of about 70 introduced this year by the
postal service, will immediately become popular with Canadians on
vacation in this country.
   The new postal rate for sending a post card to Canada is 21
cents, up from 18 cents last year.
   ``These stamps will carry the likeness of the man who
revolutionized the business world,'' Frank said in a ceremony at
the temporary ``Chester Carlson Station'' where the new stamps were
being sold.
   Carlson is the 42nd person to be honored in the postal service's
``great American'' series of stams, which seeks to acknowledge
people who aren't famous, but who made famous contributions to the
country.
   The series includes such names as authors Pearl Buck and
Sinclair Lewis and environmentalists Rachel Carson and John
Audubon, along with doctors, politicians and scientists.
   Carlson, a patent attorney in New York City who noticed that
there never seemed to be enough carbon copies of patent
specifications, perfected his idea by tinkering in the kitchen sink.
   After his discovery, Carlson spent four years trying to interest
companies in making a machine that could use his innovative process
and finally talked the Haloid Co. of Rochester into using the
process.
   Haloid, which later changed its name to Xerox Corp., put out the
first office copier, the Xerox 914, in 1959, a machine that was the
size of an office desk.

<HEAD>Grocery Chain Joins Chavez Grape Boycott</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A chain of 26 New York City supermarkets
announced Thursday that it was joining the United Farm Workers'
boycott of California table grapes, becoming the first chain in the
nation to do so.
   However, the boycott by Red Apple supermarkets has largely
symbolic value, since the California grape season is nearly over.
   Company chairman John Catsimatides made the announcement inside
a Red Apple store in Manhattan, joined by local political leaders,
including City Council President Andrew Stein and Manhattan Borough
President David Dinkins, and two daughters of the late Sen. Robert
F. Kennedy.
   The United Farm Workers has been urging the public to boycott
California table grapes until growers stop using five controversial
pesticides that the union believes are dangerous to both workers
and consumers.
   ``I think there has to be more of an awareness by consumers of
what the growers are doing to the food supply,'' Catsimatides said
in a telephone interview. He said he decided to join the boycott
after meeting earlier this year with UFW leader Cesar Chavez.
   A spokeswoman for the farmworkers union, Trish Gunning, said Red
Apple was the first supermarket chain in the nation to join the
boycott, although 18 individual markets in California have removed
grapes from their shelves.
   She conceded that the summer grape season is nearly over,
meaning Red Apple would not have had California grapes on its
shelves much longer anyway. However, she said, ``It's a great
symbol. ... It's a tremendous victory for the boycott.''

<HEAD>Pernod-Ricard Wins Court Ruling in Fight for Irish Distillers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   French liquor company Pernod-Ricard SA won a
skirmish Friday in the long takeover battle for Irish Distillers
Group PLC, when an Irish court ruled that the friendly suitor could
retain a key block of Irish Distillers' shares.
   Irish Distillers, Ireland's leading whisky maker, also is the
target of a rival, hostile bid from Grand Metropolitan PLC of
Britain, which was not involved in the litigation.
   Grand Met said Pernod-Ricard could not claim control of Irish
Distillers because of pending investigations into the way
Pernod-Ricard originally obtained shareholders' promises to sell
their Irish Distillers shares and because the Irish court left open
the possibility for appeal.
   The Common Market's European Commission, Britain's Panel on
Takeovers and Mergers, and Ireland's Fair Trade Commission are
looking into the matter.
   Pernod-Ricard has offered 285 million Irish punts, or around
$428 million, for Irish Distillers. That is equivalent to 450 Irish
pence, or $6.75, a share. Grand Met's higher offer of 332 million
punts, or 525 Irish pence a share, was raised from 400 pence a
share in response to Pernod-Ricard's bid.
   Trading in Irish Distillers shares was suspended Friday
afternoon, at the company's request, at 414 British pence ($7.29)
on the London Stock Exchange.
   The Irish court decided that Dublin-based fruit merchant
FII-Fyffes PLC unconditionally sold its 20.04 percent block of
Irish Distillers shares to Pernod-Ricard
   Pernod-Ricard contended that it had made a binding oral
agreement to buy the shares from Fyffes the day before Grand Met
made the higher offer for Irish Distillers. Fyffes subsequently
sold the shares to Grand Met at the higher price.
   Pernod-Ricard said the Fyffes shares would give it 52.8 percent
of Irish Distillers, of which only 5 percent is owned outright by
Pernod-Ricard, with the remainder in shareholders' irrevocable
promises to sell their shares.
   Grand Met said it controls 25 percent of the Irish company.
   Irish Distillers said its board of directors noted the decision
``with satisfaction'' and that the board continues to recommend
that shareholders accept the Pernod-Ricard offer.
   Thierry Jacquillat, Pernod-Ricard's managing director, said the
court ruling ``augurs favorably for the success of Pernod-Ricard's
takeover bid.''

<DATELINE>NEW PALTZ, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Disapproval expressed by International
Business Machines Corp. over Big Blue wine has prompted winemaker
Jack Ransom to scale down his marketing plans.
   Ransom began last summer bottling red, white and rose wines at
his Chateau Georges winery under the Big Blue label. The wine, also
sold by Ranson under the Rivendell name, was promoted as the wine
of choice for an international organization of former IBM employees
called Big Blue.
   However IBM, which at first had said it had no formal
affiliation with the name Big Blue, in September voiced concern
over possible trademark infringement because the company
manufactures a typewriter ribbon called Big Blue.
   IBM spokeswoman Rita Black said the computer giant was also
concerned about the lettering on the Big Blue wine label because it
was similar to the letter style used in IBM's corporate logo. Black
said the firm would take ``appropriate action,'' if necessary.
   Ransom now says he won't add to the Big Blue label a Chardonnay
and Cabernet, as he had planned.
   ``Sales have been more than brisk,'' Ransom said.
``Nevertheless, we don't want to inflame the situation with IBM any
further by introducing new wines.''
   ``We do not believe that there is any infringement...,'' Ransom
said. ``Nevertheless, we do not have the resources or fight IBM,
and are therefore withdrawing the new products. We will continue to
market the present Big Blue products, however.''
   IBM spokesman Michael Shore on Friday said he wasn't permitted
to comment on the activities of any other companies.
   He refused to say whether IBM plans to take legal action against
the wine company.
   ``I think we were just continuing to look into the matter and
that's really about as far as we've gone,'' Shore said.

<HEAD>Continental Goes To Court To Block DOT Reconsideration Request</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LES BLUMENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Continental Airlines asked the U.S. Court of
Appeals on Friday to order the Department of Transportation to
comply with its earlier decision awarding the lucrative
Seattle-Tokyo air route to the Houston-based carrier.
   Earlier this week, the department had decided that despite the
earlier appeals court decision it was going to reconsider the
selection of Continental to fly the route.
   Elliott Seiden, associated general counsel for Texas Air Corp.
which is Continental's parent company, said the airline Friday also
asked the department to drop its plans to reconsider the case.
   Seiden said the airline feels that the official who made the
reconsideration decision, Acting Assistant Secretary Gregory Dole,
should be disqualified because he was asked questions about the
Seattle-Tokyo air route by Washington Democratic Sen. Brock Adams
during a Senate subcommittee hearing in late September.
   ``Senator Adams intruded into the Seattle-Tokyo route case by
urging Dole to have the department reconsider its decision and that
the route be awarded to United,'' said Seiden. ``By questions and
statements, Senator Adams has called into question Mr. Dole's
impartiality and given an appearance of bias on the part of Mr.
Dole.''
   Seiden said that Adams, as a member of the Senate Commerce
Committee, will consider Dole's nomination to be an assistant
secretary.
   Friday's developments were just the latest in the two-year
battle over the $100 million route sought by three of the nation's
major airlines _ United, American and Continental.
   At various times, administrative law judges and top department
officials have recommended that each of the three airlines fly the
route.
   Continental had filed a suit asking the appeals court to enforce
the initial decision by an administrative law judge in the case
which recommended that Continental be awarded the route.
   In August, the appeals court ruled that Continental should
receive the route because the department had violated its own
administrative procedures.
   But on Tuesday, the department said that it would take another
look at the case.
   ``We are very confident the DOT action is unlawful and the court
will view it as such,'' said Seiden. ``Given the nature of the
request, we believe the court will act promptly.''
   Seiden also said the department might rule as early as the end
of the month on Continental's request that it drop the review of
the case.
   ``We are going to use all available legal means to defend our
route order,'' said Seiden.
   The Seattle-Tokyo route in question had previously been flown by
Pan American World Airways, but United assumed the route
temporarily when it purchased Pan Am's Pacific Division in 1986.
   The department approved the purchase, but only on the condition
that the Seattle-Tokyo route be dealt with separately.

<HEAD>Lawmakers Call For Revived Timber Talks With Japan</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two Northwest lawmakers Friday urged the
Japanese ambassador to the United States to help revive talks aimed
at eliminating Japanese trade barriers to U.S. timber products.
   ``Representatives of our wood products industry are justifiably
frustrated by this apparent impasse, and are urging that some
aggressive corrective action be taken by our government,'' Rep. Ron
Wyden, D-Ore., and Rep. Sid Morrison, R-Wash., said in a letter to
Ambassador Nobuo Matsunaga.
   Wyden and Morrison said the United States had expected the talks
would resume after Secretary of State George Shultz and the
Japanese foreign minister signed an agreement in 1986. The
administration has been pressing for new talks since August.
   ``We are concerned that we have not yet received a favorable
response from the Japanese representatives,'' the letter said.
   The two lawmakers said that earlier negotiations had achieved
``important progress'' in resolving wood products trade disputes,
but ``specific barriers remains, impeding the free and open flow of
American forest products which are in great demand in the booming
Japanese residential and commercial construction industry.''
   Last year, Japan imported $1.8 billion worth of U.S. wood
products. About two-thirds of those U.S. imports were raw logs.
   Japan imports roughly half of the wood products shipped from the
United States to Pacific Rim countries.
   A recent congressional study found that U.S. wood products
manufacturers could lose up to $2 billion per year in potential
sales in Pacific Rim countries as a result of trade barriers such
as those imposed by the Japanese.
   Among the barriers Japan has imposed is a 20 percent tariff on
laminated lumber products, such as plywood.
   Wyden and Morrison said they hoped a ``spirit of cooperation''
would prevail, adding they preferred that ``this issue be settled
through negotiation rather than confrontation.''

   The stock market edged upward Friday, reaching
another post-crash high despite some resistance from sellers after
its recent gains.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 2.31 to 2,183.50,
setting a new 1988 high for the third time this week. For the week,
the average chalked up a net gain of 50.32 points.
   Advancing issues slightly outnumbered declines in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 757 up, 695
down and 524 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 195.41 million
shares, against 189.58 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 228.14 million shares.
   Analysts cited a continuation of the ``buyout fever'' that
prompted heavy demand for stocks on Thursday after several takeover
and buyout proposals were announced in recent days.
   But some observers question whether this is a sustainable
positive force for the market, noting that it draws speculative
buying in the hope of short-term gains rather than long-term
investment money.
   Brokers also said the market in general was weighed down by a
disappointing earnings report from Digital Equipment, a prominent
technology company.
   Digital, which said sales of its high-end computer systems were
below expectations, dropped 4[ to 87 in active trading.
   In addition, interest rates rose moderately in credit-market
activity, leaving stocks without support from the bond market.
   RJR Nabisco slipped back { to 76} on profit-taking after the
stock's 21]-point jump Thursday, when the company said is was
considering a management buyout at about $75 a share.
   But Kraft Inc., which is the target of a proposed takeover by
Philip Morris, gained 1} to 92.
   Heavy activity continued in other food and consumer products
stocks. Sara Lee, up 2~ at 50; Gerber Products, up 2[ at 59~; J.M.
Smucker, up { at 61[, and Campbell Soup, up { at 34}, all set new
52-week highs.
   Holly Farms climbed 2} to 53|. Tyson Foods began a hostile
tender offer for the company at $52 a share amid much speculation
that Holly would attract a higher bid.
   Sears Roebuck jumped 2\ to 42| on speculation about a possible
restructuring or other transaction.
   Union Carbide, which said it had a sharp increase in earnings
for the third quarter, rose | to 27~.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $5.91 billion, or 0.21
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
gained .41 to 159.42.
   Standard & Poor's industrial index rose .77 to 326.84, and S&P's
500-stock composite index was up .78 at 283.66.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
slipped .03 to 388.59. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index closed at 306.07, down .30.

<HEAD>Dollar and Gold Fall</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar mostly weakened in busy
foreign-exchange trading Friday, reflecting what money brokers
called growing pessimism about the U.S. currency.
   Gold also fell in reaction to sliding oil prices, which ease
prospects of inflation and make gold investments worth less as a
hedge. Republic National Bank of New York quoted bullion at $408.50
a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT, down $2.40 from the same time
Thursday.
   Some foreign-exchange brokers said the dollar's weakness
signaled increasing sentiment that the U.S. trade deficit remains a
stubborn political and economic problem, and likely means that the
currency will have to decline following a period of renewed
strength earlier this year.
   ``I'm not terribly surprised to see the dollar down,'' said
James Hohorst, director of foreign exchange operations at
Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. in New York. ``People are losing
faith.''
   Renato Strauss, a trader at the New York branch of Bank Julius
Baer & Co. of Switzerland, said the U.S. currency's weakness
reflected an underlying momentum of dollar selling that had
continued throughout the week.
   Trading was busy, largely due to the common practice of dealers
reducing their speculative positions prior to the weekend.
   In Tokyo, the dollar fell 0.75 yen to 126.40 yen. Later in
London it was quoted at 126.70 yen. By late afternoon in New York
the dollar fetched 126.27 yen, down from 127.10 yen Thursday.
   The pound weakened against the dollar, largely because of the
decline in oil prices. Britain is one of the largest petroleum
producers and its economy is dependent on oil revenue.
   In London the pound fetched $1.7620, vs. $1.7635 Thursday. In
New York, the pound fell further to $1.7615 vs. $1.7636 Thursday.
   Other late-dollar rates in New York vs. rates Thursday: 1.7777
West German marks, down from 1.8007; 1.5061 Swiss francs, down from
1.5233; 1.1992 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2010; 6.0900 French

<TEXT>
   Donald Ephlin, head of the United Auto Workers'
General Motors Department for the past five years, will not seek
re-election next June, union President Owen Bieber said Friday.
   Ephlin, 63, revealed no plans for his future, but said he may
follow in the footsteps of other UAW officers who have become
university professors and consultants.
   ``I'm thinking of changing careers,'' he said at a news
conference, ``but one thing's for sure, I'm not sure what I'll be
doing.
   ``But I have no intention of retiring.''
   Ephlin was first elected as a UAW vice president in 1980 and
took over its largest department, with about 350,000 members, three
years later. Since then, he has directed the union's efforts at the
nation's No. 1 automaker.
   ``Mr. Ephlin made numerous innovate contributions to General
Motors and its employees,'' GM Chairman Roger B. Smith said in a
statement Friday.
   The union and the company negotiated a three-year labor
agreement last year without setting a strike deadline. It contained
job-security language first set in talks between the union and Ford
Motor Co.
   Earlier this year, Chrysler Corp. also signed a contract with
the UAW, and that put all of the U.S. Big Three automakers'
contracts with the UAW on a Sept. 14, 1990, expiration date.
   A slate of UAW officers will be elected in June, including a
vice president to replace Ephlin, and one will be appointed to head
the GM Department.
   Ephlin headed the union's Ford Department during his first term
as a vice president.
   He became an active union member at the GM assembly plant in
Framingham, Mass., where he still holds the No. 1 position on the
seniority list. He rose to the presidency of Local 422 before
joining the international union staff in 1960 in the GM Department.
   Ten years later, he became an administrative assistant to
then-UAW President Leonard Woodcock and since 1971 has been active
in job security, employee involvement and quality of worklife
issues.

<HEAD>Tyson Ups Offer for Holly Farms</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS lead to CORRECT offer to $941.2 million sted billion</NOTE>
<DATELINE>SPRINGDALE, Ark. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tyson Foods Inc. began a sweetened and
hostile $941.2 million tender offer Friday for Holly Farms Corp.,
its biggest competitor in the poultry processing business.
   Holly Farms, which earlier this week rejected a $900 million bid
from Tyson, said it would study the $52-a-share offer. Securities
analysts said they expected Holly Farms to fight a takeover attempt.
   Investors apparently expected bidding for Holly Farms to
continue, although Tyson said it would not raise its offer any
further. Holly Farms stock rose $2.75 to $53.62{ a share in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday.
   Analysts said Tyson, the nation's biggest poultry producer,
would increase its market share from 18 percent to 28 percent if it
were successful in taking over second-ranked Holly Farms.
   ``I think that if (Holly Farms) weren't already out looking for
a white knight, that they will be now,'' said Napoleon Overton, a
securities analyst with Morgan Keegan at Memphis, Tenn., where
Holly Farms is headquartered. ``It's obvious that Tyson Foods is
dead serious about acquiring Holly Farms.''
   A white knight is a friendly suitor that rescues a target
company from a hostile takeover attempt.
   Overton called Holly Farms vulnerable.
   ``If you're a Holly Farms stockholder, you've got to think ...
just prior to the (first) offer, (the stock) was in the $40 area;
relatively speaking, $52 looks pretty good,'' he said.
   ``In today's environment of takeovers and acquisitions, if a
third party is willing to pay you more than the stock market or the
company, you've got to consider it,'' he said.
   Tyson's offer was scheduled to expire Nov. 18.
   The company's previous bid was for $45 a share plus a quarter
share of Tyson Class A common stock for each of Holly Farms' 18.1
million outstanding shares.
   The Memphis-based Holly Farms has 10 business days to respond to
Tyson's offer. Tyson attorney Jim Blair said he did not expect to
hear from Holly Farms until the end of that time.
   Overton expected Holly Farms to fight the Tyson bid.
   Albert Klein, director of research for Robyns Capital at New
York, said he did not know what defenses Holly Farms might be able
to mount, other than finding a white knight.
   After the first bid, Holly Farms activated a shareholder rights
plan, known as a ``poison pill'' takeover defense, aimed at making
a hostile takeover attempt prohibitively expensive.
   Blair said Tyson believed it could defeat that move in court.
   ``If enough shareholders tender their stock, then we think the
court will knock that poison pill out,'' Blair said. ``It will
depend on how many tender their stock.''
   The offer was advertised Friday in the Wall Street Journal and
the New York Times.
   Don Tyson, chairman and chief executive officer of Tyson, was
out of his office and unavailable for comment Friday, a spokesman
said.
   R. Lee Taylor, president and chief executive officer of Holly
Farms, said in a statement after the first offer, ``The board of
directors of Holly Farms believes the best long-term interests of
the company and its shareholders will be served by the company
continuing to operate as an independent entity.''
   Tyson's operations include hatcheries, feed mills, processing
plants and a sophisticated marketing arm. Tyson produces 14 million
pounds of chicken meat each week and sells chickens to
supermarkets, fast food chains and institutional customers.
   Last year, Tyson reported net income of $67 million on sales of
about $1.8 billion.
   About half of Holly Farms' sales are in chicken. The company
reported 1987 earnings of $36.2 million on sales of $1.6 billion.

<HEAD>Precious Metals Prices Plunge On Low Inflation Rate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Precious metals futures prices fell sharply Friday in a
disappointed reaction to the government's report of a moderate 0.3
percent rise in retail prices last month, analysts said.
   The inflation-sensitive metals market had been looking for a
slightly greater increase in the consumer price index.
   On other markets, cattle were lower while pork futures were
mixed; grains and soybeans posted moderate losses; energy futures
were mixed; and stock-index futures advanced.
   Gold, silver and platinum prices were due for a downward move
after the gains of the past two weeks, and the Labor Department's
report on consumer prices provided a catalyst, analysts said.
   Gold settled $3.80 to $3.90 lower on New York's Commodity
Exchange with the contract for delivery in December at $411.50 a
troy ounce; silver was 12.5 cents to 13.4 cents lower with December
at $6.285 a troy ounce.
   Platinum futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange settled
$10.90 to $12.60 lower with October at $528.90 a troy ounce.
   The sell-off began with orders from overseas customers to
liquidate their gold holdings in reaction to the
lower-than-expected inflation number, said Stephen Platt, metals
analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago.
   The overseas selling ``gave us our initial thrust down,'' Platt
said. ``There also was a lot of disappointment over the (gold)
market's inability to react to the recent dollar weakness and to
early strength in the crude-oil market.''
   Gold's failure to rally on those bullish signals sent the silver
and platinum markets into a tailspin, analysts said.
   The relatively low inflation number continued a trend that was
blamed for gold's plunge below $400 a troy ounce last month.
   ``It's difficult to make a case for large purchases of precious
metals at this time as a hedge against inflation. There's nothing
to suggest we're going to have a wild bout of inflation in the next
few months,'' said David Syphen, manager of metals futures trading
for Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Inc. in New York.
   Cattle futures finished mostly lower while pork futures settled
narrowly mixed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange ahead of some
Agriculture Department reports that pointed toward higher beef
prices and lower bacon prices.
   The quarterly cattle-on-feed report pegged the number of cattle
being fattened for slaughter on feedlots Oct. 1 in the 13 largest
cattle states at 8.6 million head, down 5 percent from a year
earlier.
   Feedlot placements dipped 10 percent in the third quarter
compared to the same period a year ago while marketings off of
feedlots increased 2 percent to 6.2 million, a record third-quarter
high.
   Cattle producers reduced their feedyard placements and the size
of their herds because of the summer drought, which dried up
pastures and raised the cost of feed grains, analysts said.
   In another report, the USDA said the amount of frozen pork
bellies in cold storage fell last month to 29.4 million pounds from
42.6 million pounds. The market had expected an even lower number,
so analysts predicted a drop in pork-belly futures prices next week.
   Live cattle settled .35 cent lower to .17 cent higher with
December at 74.42 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent to .22
cent lower with October at 81.70 cents a pound; live hogs were .30
cent lower to .15 cent higher with December at 41.87 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were .35 cent to .97 cent higher with February
at 49.62 cents a pound.
   Grain and soybean futures finished moderately lower on the
Chicago Board of Trade in late liquidation linked to beneficial
rains in Brazil's soybean country and bearish chart signals in the
wheat market.
   Corn prices retreated in a continuing reaction to Thursday's
rumor that the Soviet Union had spurned a shipment of U.S. corn due
to the presence of aflatoxin, a carcinogenic mold, analysts said.
   Wheat settled 1{ cents to 5\ cents lower with the contract for
delivery in December at $4.19{ a bushel; corn was { cent to 3 cents
lower with December at $2.83{ a bushel; oats were 4{ cents lower to
{ cent higher with December at $2.50\ a bushel; soybeans were \
cent to 10 cents lower with November at $7.74} a bushel.
   Crude oil futures were nearly unchanged and heating oil was
narrowly mixed on the New York Mercantile Exchange but gasoline
futures rose sharply on indications of continuing tight supplies.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil was unchanged to 9 cents lower
with December at $14.37 a barrel; heating oil was .35 cent lower to
.13 cent higher with November at 42.71 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .10 cent to 1.87 cents higher with November at 51.22
cents a gallon.
   Stock-index futures gained slightly on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange with the contract for December delivery of the Standard &
Poor's 500 up .25 point at 285.00.

<HEAD>Iran-Iraq Differences Key to New Production Agreement, OPEC Leader
Says</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Subroto, one name, is cq in 16th graf.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>MADRID, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The key to a new OPEC production agreement
rests on ironing out sharp differences between Iraq and Iran, the
cartel's president said Friday.
   Rilwanu Lukman spoke as the pricing and long-term strategy
committees of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries met
for a second day to discuss a new output ceiling for the 13-nation
group.
   Iraqi Oil Minister Issam Abdul-Raheem Al-Chalabi told reporters
late Friday the ministers had broken up into informal groups to try
to work out differences.
   He declined to say how the talks were progressing, although he
said he was optimistic.
   A third formal meeting of the two committees was scheduled for
Saturday, OPEC sources said.
   OPEC's current ceiling for 12 of it 13 member nations is 15.06
million barrels a day, but the cartel's current production is
estimated at close to 21 million barrels a day.
   The resulting oversupply of oil on international markets sent
crude prices plummeting recently to below $12 a barrel, far below
the official OPEC target of $18. The cartel scheduled the Madrid
meetings in hopes of moving toward a new agreement that would limit
output and stabilize prices.
   Lukman, who is also Nigeria's oil minister, said, ``We have to
get them (Iraqis) back into the quota fold and then we talk about
whether to go up or down'' on a new ceiling.
   Lukman and the oil ministers of Saudi Arabia and Venezuela say
they would reject a new production pact that excludes Iraq.
   Iraq has refused to abide by any OPEC-mandated production quota
since 1986, demanding it be given a quota equal to Iran's
2.369-million-barrel daily limit.
   Iran has rejected that condition. The two countries, who had
been at war since 1980, reached a cease-fire in August but remain
bitter enemies.
   Before the start of Thursday's meeting, Iranian Oil Minister
Gholamreza Aqazadeh reiterated his country's opposition to parity
with Iraq.
   Oil industry analysts say Iraq has been pumping at least 2.6
million barrels of crude a day, an amount that could be pushed to
3.7 million barrels a day by mid-1989 with the completion of a new
pipeline through Saudi Arabia to the Red Sea.
   Both Iraq and Iran, heavily dependent on crude exports for
revenue, need massive amounts of capital to rebuild their
war-battered economies.
   Saudi Arabia's oil minister, Hisham Nazer, indicated he believed
Iraq was willing to re-enter the OPEC quota system, but he did not
say at what production level.
   OPEC Secretary General Subroto said Friday the work needed to
hammer out a new agreement will require the cartel to call several
more committee meetings before its scheduled Nov. 21 full
ministerial conference in Vienna.
   The OPEC pricing committee includes oil ministers from Algeria,
Saudi Arabia, Nigeria, Indonesia and Venezuela, while the long-term
strategy committee comprises Iraq, Iran, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and
Venezuela.
   The remaining OPEC members are Ecuador, Gabon, Libya, Qatar and
the United Arab Emirates.

<TEXT>
   Consumer prices rose a moderate 0.3 percent in
September, the smallest gain in three months, as a steep drop in
gasoline costs offset higher food and clothing prices, the
government reported Friday.
   The increase in the Labor Department's Consumer Price Index
meant consumer prices were rising at a moderate annual rate of 4.1
percent last month, down from an annual rate of 5.2 percent in
August.
   The most recent inflation report triggered an automatic 4.0
percent cost-of-living increase for the nation's 38.4 million
Social Security recipients, the second highest boost in the last 6{
years.
   The increase, which will increase the average retired worker's
pension by $21 a month, will show up in January.
   Economists, who had been worried about a new inflationary spiral
fueled by tight labor markets and drought-driven food increases,
said the price slowdown in September was an encouraging sign.
   ``The September price report should allay a lot of the
inflationary fears that were in financial markets the past few
months,'' said David Bassett, an economist with the WEFA Group, an
economic consulting firm in Bala Cynwyd, Pa.
   In the financial markets, stock prices rose. The Dow Jones
average of 30 industrials edged up 2.31 points to 2,183.50, setting
a new 1988 high for the third time this week.
   Bond prices fell modestly, pushing yields on long-term Treasury
bonds toward 8.9 percent, while the dollar slipped in busy
foreign-exchange trading.
   In the oil futures market, prices edged lower as traders awaited
word on progress by two committees of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries that were meeting to discuss the cartel's
overproduction.
   The September report will be the last news on consumer prices
released before the November election, a fact that should help
George Bush, who has been citing the Reagan administration's
reduction of high inflation rates as one of its biggest economic
achievements.
   Richard Rahn, a Bush economic adviser and chief economist of the
U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said that despite dire warnings to the
contrary, inflation has remained remarkably steady.
   ``Crow, not turkey, should be on the Thanksgiving menus of the
many analysts who have been predicting accelerating inflation this
year,'' he said.
   For the first nine months of the year, inflation has been rising
at an annual rate of 4.5 percent, little changed from the 4.4
percent increase for all of 1987.
   Many economists believe that a significant drop in world oil
prices will more than offset expected increases in food costs to
hold inflation down for the rest of the year.
   ``We are getting some temporary luck because lower oil prices
are helping to balance the effects of the drought,'' said David
Wyss, an economist with Data Resources Inc. of Lexington, Mass.
   But Wyss warned that oil prices, which have fallen sharply
because of the inability of oil exporting countries to agree on
production quotas, could rebound just as suddenly if the members of
OPEC do reach agreement on supply limits.
   The 0.3 percent overall rise in consumer prices in September was
down slightly from increases of 0.4 percent in July and August as
gasoline prices fell by 1.7 percent, the biggest decline since
February.
   However, food prices climbed 0.8 percent and clothing costs shot
up 2.2 percent. These two components accounted for 70 percent of
the September price increase.
   Fruit and vegetable prices led the grocery store advance,
climbing by 4.5 percent, while beef prices were up 1.1 percent and
poultry prices rose 1.3 percent. Analysts said those gains
reflected the lingering effects from the summer's drought.
   The rise in clothing costs reflected higher prices for new fall
clothes. But analysts noted that a similar big boost in spring
apparel prices was rolled back in later months as retailers were
forced to offer steep discounts.
   The drop in gasoline prices, the largest since a similar 1.7
percent fall last February, sent pump prices 27.3 percent below
their peak of March 1981. Home heating oil costs were down as well,
falling by 2.1 percent. But the price of natural gas and
electricity, taken together, rose 0.6 percent.
   New car prices rose 0.6 percent in September, reflecting
smaller-than-usual sales incentives offered to clear out unsold
inventories.
   The September inflation data triggered the automatic 4 percent
cost-of-living increase for Social Security recipients. It will
mean the average monthly benefit will rise from $516 to $537.
   The government calculates the benefit increase based on the
change in one portion of the Consumer Price Index _ wages paid to
urban workers _ from July through September of one year to the same
period of the following year.
   Benefits have risen automatically with the Consumer Price Index
since 1975, with the exception of six months in 1983 that were
skipped to help bail the Social Security System out of a financial
crisis.
   In another government report, the Labor Department said
Americans' average weekly earnings, after adjusting for inflation,
rose a seasonally adjusted 0.5 percent in September, after falling
a sharp 1.3 percent in August, the worst drop in four years.
   The September increase stemmed from a rise in the number of
hours worked and in the earnings per hour, which more than offset
the increase in consumer prices.

   Bond prices fell Friday in spite of a drop in
oil prices and a report of lower-than-expected inflation.
   Canceling out the good news were dimming prospects in Congress
for passage of a major tax reform bill that has been awaiting
action for more than two years, said Jimmy Nogami, a vice president
in bond trading at Daiwa Securities Inc.
   The Treasury's 30-year bond fell 19-32 point, or $5.94 for every
$1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in the opposite
direction from its price and is often an indicator of interest rate
trends, rose to 8.90 percent from 8.84 percent late Thursday.
   ``It looks pretty ugly out there in Bondland,'' said Mitchell
Held, chief financial economist for Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co.
   The Labor Department reported that retail prices rose 0.3
percent last month. The price rise was considered moderate and was
down a notch from the 0.4 percent increases of July and August.
   On Capitol Hill, meanwhile, Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole of
Kansas said there was less than a 50 percent chance of getting a
tax bill. One House aide, who would not be quoted by name, said
there was only one chance in 10.
   After a week of deadlock, senior staff members suggested a
compromise between the Senate and the House with a 3-year price tag
of about $4 billion. That is higher than senators had favored, but
less than backed by the House.
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term
government issues slipped 1-16 point to 3-32 point, intermediate
maturities declined [ point to 3-16 point, and 20-year issues
dropped 11-32 point, according to figures provided by Telerate
Inc., a financial information service.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Daily Treasury Bond Index, which measures
price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities
of a year or longer, fell 1.67 to 1,149.78.
   Corporate bonds also declined. Moody's Investment Grade
Corporate Bond Index, which measures price movements on 80
corporate bonds with maturities of five years or longer, slipped
0.38 to 294.26.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills, meanwhile, rose to 7.67
percent as the discount edged up 1 basis point to 7.43 percent.
Yields on six-month bills rose to 7.98 percent as the discount
advanced 2 basis points to 7.58 percent. Yields on one-year bills
rose to 8.15 percent with the discount up 2 basis points at 7.58
percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, which is paid at maturity.
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, was quoted at 8 3-16 percent, down from 8] percent late
Thursday.

<HEAD>Minorco Raises Stake in Gold Fields to 29.57 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Minorco SA, the Luxembourg-based holding company
bidding for control of Consolidated Gold Fields, said Friday it had
obtained shareholder support for the terms of its offer.
   Minorco, whose $1.5 billion bid is due to close Tuesday, also
said it had raised its stake in the company to 29.57 percent with
the purchase of 1.32 million ordinary shares since Oct. 11.
   The purchases, representing 0.6 percent of Consolidated Gold
Fields' 213.4 million shares, were purchased after Consolidated
Gold Fields' share price declined below the level of the Minorco
bid. Minorco is offering $33 and one new Minorco share for every
two Consolidated Gold Fields shares.
   With Minorco shares closing unchanged at $11.70 in London on
Friday, the Minorco bid values each Consolidated Gold Fields share
at $12.56. Consolidated Gold Fields shares closed Friday at $22.17,
down 26 cents.
   Minorco said shareholders at a special general meeting gave
their approval to a resolution to increase the authorized share
capital, or the number of shares the shareholders will allow the
company to issue to cover the bid.
   If the bid is successful, Minorco expects to have to issue 79.7
million new shares, representing about 31.9 percent of the enlarged
share capital.
   Minorco owned 28.94 percent of Consolidated Gold Fields'
ordinary shares at the time it launched its bid Sept. 21.
Consolidated Gold Fields' share price quickly jumped above the
Minorco offering price, which then was valued at 23 cents a share.
   Concern that the bid would be disqualified by the British
government on competitive or national interest grounds subsequently
sent Consolidated Gold Fields' shares plunging. Their Friday
closing levels represent a drop of about $3.50 from their highs
shortly after the Minorco bid was announced.
   A decision on whether the bid should be investigated by the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission for those reasons is due out
early next week.
   In a separate action Wednesday, the government appointed
investigators to look into possible insider trading and
concert-party share ownership of stock in Consolidated Gold Fields.
The latter occurs when one company secretly agrees to buy stock for
another firm.
   Consolidated Gold Fields, which requested the investigation, has
alleged that insider dealing and share building by parties related
to Minorco occurred in the weeks before the Sept. 21 launch of the
Minorco bid, which it is fighting.
   The company claims that the activity affected its chances of
fending off the takeover attempt.
   The investigators have been asked to report to the Trade and
Industry Secretary Lord Young as soon as possible.

   Owners of the Seabrook nuclear plant on
Friday made their case for a quick low-power license as they told
federal regulators how they would pay to shut down the plant if it
ran at low power but never operated commercially.
   In a filing to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, New Hampshire
Yankee, which would operate the $5.6 billion plant, said it would
cost $21.1 million, and that owners are willing to foot the bill.
   The NRC ruled a month ago that before Seabrook could get a
low-power license, its owners must prove they can pay for
decommissioning the reactor if they receive the 5 percent testing
permit but never secure a full-power commercial license.
   According to the report, the $21.1 million is the cost to
completely decommission and dismantle the project: taking apart and
disposing of radioactive components, paying NRC fees,
decontaminating the plant, and paying overhead and accounting costs.
   New Hampshire Yankee spokesman Rob Williams said the NRC
required the owners to address only those four steps.
   Owners have agreed to pay the cost proportionate to their
ownership shares, the report said. The lead owner with 36 percent,
Public Service Co. of New Hampshire, would pay about $7.6 million.
Mired in its Seabrook debt, Public Service filed in January for
bankruptcy reorganization.
   Seabrook's fourth-largest owner with 11.6 percent, Massachusetts
Municipal Wholesale Electric Co., would pay about $2.4 million.
MMWEC decided in June to pull out of Seabrook, but the New
Hampshire Yankee report said MMWEC has up to $10 million set aside
for decommissioning costs.
   Another troubled Seabrook owner, Vermont Electric Generation and
Transmission Cooperative, owns less than one half of 1 percent and
would owe $8,400. The report said that portion would be paid by
sources that are paying for the cooperative's monthly operating
share.
   ``We feel the submission of the plan and the financing
arrangements further demonstrates that we are ready to begin
low-power testing as soon as possible,'' said New Hampshire Yankee
President Edward Brown.
   The report said it would cost between $320 million and $390
million in 1988 dollars to cancel the project as it stands now _
unlicensed and idle due to evacuation planning problems. The
figures were developed to assist the parties involved in Public
Service's bankrutpcy proceedings.
   However, that vastly higher figure includes costs for
demolishing Seabrook's completed first reactor and mothballed
second reactor; settling all contracts, taxes and claims; and
disposing of nuclear fuel already loaded in Unit 1.
   Williams said plant owners do not have estimates of how much it
would cost to cancel Seabrook if it conducted low-power testing but
never got a commercial license.

   Bargainers for Caterpillar Inc., one of
the world's biggest producers of construction equipment, negotiated
intensely Friday with United Auto Workers locals to reach agreement
on final issues keeping the two sides apart on a new contract.
   Union representatives planned to meet into the night with the
four locals to discuss a new proposal.
   UAW International bargainer Randy Arrington, speaking hours
before an 11 p.m. strike deadline, said only one issue remained
between the company and Pontiac, Ill., Local 2096. He declined to
elaborate.
   After months of bargaining and two contract extensions, both
sides announced Thursday that tentative agreement had been reached
on nearly every central issue, including provisions for substantial
pay raises and increases in both health and pension benefits.
   But as of late Friday, disagreement remained between the company
and four UAW locals over the special job classifications issue.
   Bargainers from both Peoria Local 974 and Decatur Local 751 had
said their memberships were willing to strike over that issue if it
wasn't resolved.
   The locals have objected to the company's insistence on
establishing special job classifications for highly technical jobs
because they said it threatened the union's traditional seniority
system.
   Workers trained to fill these high-tech positions could not be
bumped from their jobs by untrained workers with more seniority,
even if the senior worker faced layoff.
   Company officials maintain, however, that management cannot
afford to invest in new automated machinery and specialized job
training unless it can depend on having those workers remain on the
job.
   Larry Solomon, president of Decatur Local 751, said Friday that
his membership was firmly against any further extension of the
contract.
   ``The membership will support us in the strike,'' Solomon said.
``They've been itchy. They think we should have been on strike all
along.''
   But later in the day, Solomon said that some progress had been
made and that he was more optimistic a compromise could be reached
on the special job classification issue.
   Mark Polzin, a Caterpillar spokesman, confirmed that the company
had met with the Pontiac local Friday. The Decatur, Peoria and
Aurora locals met among themselves throughout the day.
   Polzin said the company also was holding its own meetings.
   ``As far as I know, they're just trying to figure out what
direction to take from here,'' he said.
   The four locals without agreement _ Decatur, Peoria, Aurora and
Pontiac _ have about 15,000 of Caterpillar's 18,000 UAW workers.
Denver, York, Pa., and Memphis, Tenn., locals already have
tentative agreements and the Davenport, Iowa, plant is being closed.
