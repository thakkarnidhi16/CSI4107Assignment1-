   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze and Foreign Secretary Raul Manglapus on Thursday
discussed offers to reduce Soviet troop strength in Asia and ways to
improve bilateral relations.
   Shevardnadze, who was to meet President Corazon Aquino later
Thursday, described the talks as ``very interesting'' and ``very
substantive.''
   Shevardnadze arrived Wednesday from Tokyo and was to depart later
Thursday for communist ally North Korea. He is the highest-ranking
Soviet official ever to visit this former American colony.
   During his visit to Japan the Soviet foreign minister
re-established dialogue on a peace treaty, although Japanese
officials said the two sides are still far apart over a territorial
dispute.
   That Shevardnadze agreed at all to discuss the dispute over a
cluster of islands marked progress, Japanese officials said.
   Kazuhiko Togo, head of the Japanese Foreign Ministry's Soviet
Union Division, said ``the positions taken by both sides differed
completely'' on a cluster of islands in the Kuril Islands that Japan
calls its northern territories.
   ``The fact that both sides presented their views in a fairly
comprehensive manner and also the fact that it was reflected in the
communique ... we evaluate as a positive phenomenon,'' he added.
   In a joint communique, the two nations allude to the islands as
``difficulties existing in their bilateral relations.''
   The Soviet Union seized the islands, off the northern coast of
Hokkaido, in the final days of World War II and later stationed some
10,000 troops there. Japan insists its claim to the islands must be
settled before the two sides conclude a peace treaty formally ending
that war.
   Japan and the Soviet Union have agreed, meanwhile, to form a
permanent working group ``in order to further promote the
negotiations on the conclusion of a peace treaty,'' the communique
said.
   Shevardnadze told a news conference before his departure that
while he and Japanese Foreign Minister Sousuke Uno fell short of
forging a major agreement, they succeeded in laying a basis for
further talks.
   ``We have attained a degree of mutual understanding that allows
us to speak of a new chapter in Japan-Soviet relations ... (with)
good prospects for Soviet-Japanese political dialogue and for a
practical development of our relations,'' said Shevardnadze, who
first visited Japan in 1986.
   Shevardnadze also told his news conference that the two sides
agreed to prepare for a summit between Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev and Japanese Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita.
   He said he will meet Uno in Paris in early January while
attending a conference on chemical weapons, and that Uno will visit
Moscow in the spring to prepare a concrete summit timetable and
agenda.
   Uno later told reporters that by taking up the issue of the
islands, ``historic talks'' were made possible.
   He described the Soviet position regarding the islands as ``just
as severe as before.'' But he added that ``we agreed on talks to
conclude a peace treaty.''
   Takeshita, commenting on the first Japan-Soviet foreign ministers
meeting in three years, said the talks ``marked a major first step
in furthering bilateral relations,'' according to Japanese news
reports.

   A highway maintenance crew has found a
way to turn motorists' snarls into smiles, even at work sites where
traffic must slow to a near halt.
   ``I was getting cussed out 10 to 15 times an hour last week,''
said Ernest Nava, a supervisor for the Florida Department of
Transportation.
   But after his crew began wearing red-and-white Santa Claus hats
this week, ``we did not hear a sour word,'' Nava said.
   He said he got the idea from his 14-year-old son, Shawn, who also
wears one of the furry hats.

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After nearly four years without a
brand-by-brand analysis, American cigarette devotees are once again
confronted by The List.
   The List _ which itemizes tar, nicotine and carbon monoxide
content in cigarette smoke _ is back, released Tuesday by the
Federal Trade Commission for the first time since January 1985.
   The new compilation, based on tobacco-industry tests of 272
varieties of cigarettes, showed that varieties of Carlton and Now
scored lowest in all three categories, exactly where they ranked in
the 1985 list.
   At the other end of the spectrum, Old Gold Straights produced the
highest amounts of tar and nicotine and varieties of Century 25s,
More 120s and Tall 120s produced the most carbon monoxide in the
tests, the consumer agency said.
   The list was formerly done annually, with the testing done by an
FTC laboratory. After the release of the 1985 list, the agency
halted the testing program it began in 1966 in the wake of the U.S.
surgeon general's finding that cigarettes are dangerous to human
health.
   In dropping its tests, the FTC cited budgetary constraints and
said such scientific sampling was not consistent with the chief
functions of an agency dominated by lawyers and economists.
   The new test results were produced by the industry-supported
Tobacco Industry Testing Laboratory under FTC oversight and using
the same procedures previously employed by the agency, according to
Judith Wilkenfeld of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Affairs.
   She said that Harold Pillsbury, former director of the FTC
laboratory, worked under contract to the agency to monitor the
industry testing procedures and review its data.
   ``We feel very confident the results are consistent with the
results we were generating when we did the tests,'' Ms. Wilkenfeld
said.
   An FTC statement said the 272 varieties of cigarettes were
obtained by a company hired by the industry laboratory. It said the
company purchased two packages of each variety in 50 different
locations around the nation.
   The tests measured each variety's smoke content of tar, which is
particulate matter exclusive of nicotine; of nicotine, an addictive
substance; and of carbon monoxide, a toxic gas.
   Lowest in all three categories were Carlton's and Now's filter
kings marketed in hard packs. Each produced tar, nicotine and carbon
monoxide readings below the measurement sensitivity of the test
equipment.
   The lowest measurable readings in the three categories were also
produced by these two brands: Carlton filter king regular and
menthol in soft packs, 100s in regular and menthol in hard packs and
100s in soft packs; and Now filter kings, regular and menthol, in
soft packs, and 100s, regular and menthol, in soft packs.
   Their tar readings ranged from 1 to 3 milligrams per cigarette,
with nicotine ranging from 0.1 milligram to 0.3 milligram and carbon
monoxide ranging from 1 milligram to 4 milligrams.
   Among high-tar cigarettes, Old Gold Straights and Philip Morris
Commanders each produced 27 milligrams. The Old Golds also had the
highest nicotine reading, 1.9 milligrams, trailed by English Ovals
with 1.8 milligrams.
   The highest carbon monoxide results came from Century 25 100s in
the soft pack; More 120s, regular and menthol, in soft packs; and
Tall 120 filters in the soft pack. Each produced 21 milligrams per
cigarette.
   The latest list showed that Americans have a choice of 184
varieties of cigarettes producing less than 15 milligrams of tar, up
from 152 in the list released in 1985. There were 190 varieties with
1 milligram or less of nicotine, up from 159 in 1985.
   But they are finding less choice in the cigarette racks when it
comes to varieties with less than 10 milligrams of carbon monoxide.
In 1985, there were 80 varieties in this category, but the latest
list has only 49.

   Israel's relationship with the United States is
in for a bumpy ride in the months ahead, and the sudden resignation
of one of its chief lobbyists in Washington is not helping any.
   Douglas Bloomfield, the legislative director of the American
Israel Public Affairs Committee, resigned several days ago after
nine years at one of the best organized and most influential lobbies
in Washington.
   In keeping with their dislike of publicity, AIPAC officials
including Bloomfield declined to discuss his departure publicly.
Privately, some contended that it was prompted by personality
clashes rather than policy disagreements.
   But congressional supporters of AIPAC, as well as some Jewish
leaders, warned that Bloomfield's departure reflects a dangerous
crack in the traditionally close relationship between Congress and
the powerful lobby.
   ``It's the worst possible timing,'' said Morris Amitay, a lawyer
who served as AIPAC's executive director from 1974 to 1980. Amitay,
whose office directly overlooks AIPAC's and who still acts as a
father confessor to some of its staffers, said Bloomfield's
departure reflects a shift in the group's lobbying tactics.
   The organization, which until recent years concentrated all its
efforts on lobbying Capitol Hill, has in recent years also reached
out to the administration _ too much so, said Amitay.
   ``They feel, erroneously, that they can lobby the administration
the same way as Congress and get what they want. That's not very
sophisticated,'' he said.
   Rep. Lawrence Smith, D-Fla., who has fought strenuously against
administration requests for arms sales to Arab countries, said he
has worked closely with AIPAC in the past but ``if this trend goes
on, I'm going to have a problem with them.''
   ``They have to understand that the real bedrock of support for
Israel is the Congress. Administrations come and go. We're pretty
constant and reliable,'' Smith said.
   AIPAC's reputation as one of Washington's most powerful lobbies
is due in large part to the $3 billion in annual U.S. aid to Israel,
the most received by any nation. The organization also has fought
successfully against arms sales to moderate Arab states.
   Several new arms sale proposals are likely to surface in the
coming months and add to the strains in U.S.-Israeli ties.
   Israel and the United States already are at odds over last week's
decision by President Reagan to reverse a 13-year ban on U.S. talks
with the Palestine Liberation Organization, which Israel views as an
enemy committed to its destruction.
   Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and his top lieutenants
expressed a sense of betrayal and shock over the decision. Israel's
former U.N. envoy, Binyamin Netanyahu, said the decision had eroded
U.S. credibility in Israel's eyes.
   But President-elect Bush has indicated he plans to continue the
dialogue with the PLO in an effort to advance peace talks in the
Middle East. Officials on his transition team also have indicated
they will consider a new Saudi Arabian weapons shopping list worth
millions of dollars.
   The Saudis, weary of fighting Congress over previous arms
requests, recently signed $30 billion worth of weapons contracts
with British companies. Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci chastised
``various interest groups and many in Congress'' for costing the
United States the lucrative deal.
   Unrest within AIPAC and the strains with Congress also appear due
in part to a perception that the organization's leadership is
pro-Republican.
   This does not sit well with the predominantly Democratic Congress
nor with some in the Jewish community, which traditionally has
tended to vote Democratic.
   ``The partisanship that is perceived as creeping into AIPAC's
decision-making will hurt them in the long run,'' said Smith. ``They
can't afford to be seen as siding with one side or another. They
need support on both sides of the aisle for Israel.''
   AIPAC, which prefers to keep a low profile and work behind the
scenes, also was hit by news reports earlier this year saying that
it had begun actively supporting specific candidates, in violation
of its mandate.
   The lobbying group denied the allegations, some of which were
based on memos leaked by disaffected employees.

   If the millions of holiday travelers who will go
through O'Hare International Airport fly before noon, the neighbors
of the nation's busiest airport may be able _ for once _ to hear
Christmas Eve carols.
   The roar of arriving and departing airliners has grated on the
residents' nerves for years, but a federal court decision last week
permitting them to sue the city of Chicago, which operates O'Hare,
for damages may help.
   The noise problem is especially intense at Christmas time, the
busiest travel period of the year at O'Hare.
   From Friday through Jan. 2, 2.6 million people are expected to
fly through O'Hare, said Cynthia-Val Jones, a spokeswoman for the
Chicago Department of Aviation.
   Departing jets passing overhead disrupt conversations,
televisions, and radios and generally force everyday life to stop
momentarily, residents say.
   ``It's called the `Bensenville Pause.' Everything comes to a
halt,'' said Glenn Hahn, who has lived for five years in
Bensenville, a northwest Chicago suburb located under an O'Hare
takeoff pattern.
   The decision by the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals returned a
lawsuit over O'Hare noise and air pollution to DuPage County Circuit
Court, where it may be consolidated with similar cases, said Joseph
Karaganis, attorney for plaintiff Lawrence C. Bieneman.
   The court ruling is another one of the issues that has made
O'Hare a symbol of troubles in the nation's crowded skies.
   After a startling 150 percent increase in the number of errors by
air traffic controllers this year, the Federal Aviation
Administration in October ordered the airport to cut the number of
arrivals from 96 per hour to 80 during peak-travel times from 4:45
p.m. to 9:15 p.m.
   Just after Thanksgiving, the restriction was eased to 85 arrivals
an hour, said Fred Farrar, a spokesman for the agency in Washington.
   The FAA limitations were imposed after the number of controller
errors reached 30, including four in one week. There were 12 errors
in all of 1987 and to date, there have been 35 in 1988, said Donald
Zochert, an FAA spokesman in Chicago.
   ``If you're flying in the morning, there probably won't be much
trouble, but people should expect delays,'' Farrar said. ``If you
get a snowy day, it's going to be worse. If it's a good weather day,
it might not be as bad.''
   The FAA restrictions should mean 15-minute to 30-minute delays
over the Christmas weekend, said Tom Stack, spokesman for American
Airlines, second largest carrier at O'Hare.
   ``We're projecting handling 218,500 people through O'Hare on the
Friday before Christmas and on the Monday afterward it gets ugly
again with 215,600,'' Ms. Jones said.
   Normally, 120,000 people go through the airport on a daily basis,
she said.
   O'Hare handled 203,494 people Dec. 23, 1987, and 152,292 fliers
the day after Christmas last year, she said. On Jan. 2, 1988,
147,574 traveled through the airport.
   The three dates are the heaviest travel dates of the year at
O'Hare, she said.
   ``We're not operating any more flights than we normally do. We're
just putting more people on each plane,'' said Charles Novak, a
spokesman for United Airlines, the largest carrier at O'Hare.
   Judy Hoffenkamp, who is co-chairwoman of the Bensenville
Environmental Protection Coalition, a grass roots organization
battling noise from O'Hare, urged holiday travelers to fly in the
morning.
   ``If they do that and the airport cuts the number of evening
flights, I might be able to hear Christmas carols and even be able
to watch the news on TV and hear it,'' she said.

<HEAD>Latest Counterfeit Problem Is Bogus Valve Parts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bogus valve parts are the latest counterfeit
equipment problem to strike the nuclear power industry, which
earlier was hit with faulty bolts and circuit breakers.
   The utility that discovered what the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission called counterfeit valve parts says they were found and
weeded out before being put to use.
   The parts were meant for valves controlling the steam supply to
the turbines at the Palisades Plant of Consumers Power Co. near
South Haven, Mich., said Brian Grimes of the commission's Office of
Nuclear Reactor Regulation.
   Palisades is currently shut down to repair steam generator leaks
but Consumers hopes to restart it before the end of the year.
   Some of the questionable valve parts were installed after they
passed special tests that showed they met specifications, said Paul
Knopick, a company spokesman in Jackson, Mich.
   A bad parts failure might cause a valve to remain shut or open,
not responding to commands, and that might cause an automatic
reactor shutdown but would not mean a nuclear accident, said Grimes.
   The commission staff last week issued a special notice to
utilities asking them to be on the lookout for bogus valve parts of
all kinds. This could be difficult, because a large nuclear plant
might have 40,000 valves, 10 times as many as a coal plant of the
same power.
   ``Valves are quite frequently refurbished,'' said Grimes.
   The notice said counterfeiting ``may extend to other
manufacturers'' besides the company whose parts were misrepresented,
Masoneilan-Dresser Co.
   Consumers Power discovered the faulty parts when a repaired valve
leaked, Grimes said. ``Some of the parts they had procured turned
out to be misrepresented and counterfeit,'' and an investigation by
the manufacturer concluded ``there appeared to be a counterfeit
market,'' he said.
   Knopick would not go as far as Grimes and say the parts had been
misrepresented: ``It's too early to conclude that. That's still
under investigation.''
   Counterfeit bolts and other fasteners were found in several
places two years ago. The commission staff has concluded that there
is enough margin for error in plant designs so that no safety
problem should arise. More bolts than necessary are used and they
are not stressed to the limit, the commission staff says.
   Following the discovery of counterfeit circuit breakers in
California earlier this year, the commission staff ordered utilities
to inspect breakers, replacing those that didn't meet
specifications, with reports of findings by March. Utilities would
have to justify retaining any that couldn't be inspected.
   Some instances of counterfeiting appear to be the relabeling of
normal commercial equipment as having been manufactured under the
stricter controls that are supposed to apply to items meant for
nuclear plants, officials said.
   Grimes said Tuesday a different form of counterfeiting was
recently found at the Quad Cities plant of Commonwealth Edison Co.
in Illinois. A bigger circuit breaker than those involved in
California had been put through a ``substandard refurbishment'' in
which parts were used that were ``non-genuine and non-conforming
dimensionally,'' Grimes said.
   ``A number of activities are under way to identify the source of
the refurbishment,'' he said.
   Victor Stello, executive director for operations at the NRC, said
the staff expects to propose new regulations that would tighten
requirements for inspection of equipment when it arrives from
suppliers.

   C R - - - - - - D.
   Depending on your outlook, it's a nine-letter word for either
frustration or fun. The crossword puzzle, which turned 75 today,
thrives because of those elements, experts say.
   It can be frustrating, for instance, to ponder what four-letter
word matches the clue ``wedding-cake artisan,'' but fun to find that
``icer'' fits perfectly.
   ``Most of the problems we have in everyday life don't have
clear-cut solutions,'' said Will Shortz, editor of Games magazine.
``Crossword puzzles have definitive answers, and when you get that
answer, it's a very satisfying feeling.''
   Surveys show that 27 million people across _ and down _ the
country do crosswords regularly, and more than twice that many do
them occasionally.
   Crosswords are descended from the ancient word square game;
elementary forms appeared in children's books in England during the
19th century. But the modern crossword was invented, out of
necessity, by Arthur Wynne, editor of the ``Fun'' supplement of the
New York World.
   ``It was the Sunday before Christmas, and he had a page to
fill,'' Shortz said. The diamond-shaped, 31-clue ``Word-Cross''
puzzle ran on Dec. 21, 1913, and was an immediate hit.
   A typesetter transposed the words four weeks later, and the name
crossword stuck. A crossword cult formed among readers of the World,
other papers began running puzzles, and by 1924, it was a
full-fledged craze.
   The black-and-white crossword design showed up in jewelry and on
dresses; trains carried dictionaries and printed crosswords on the
backs of menus; the New York Graphic magazine ran a contest with
$25,000 in prize money.
   Simon & Schuster's first publication was a book of crossword
puzzles that sold half a million copies in a single year.
   More and more newspapers printed puzzles, with the notable
exception of The New York Times, which dismissed them as ``a
primitive sort of mental exercise'' that would soon fade.
   The craze faded, but the puzzles persisted. By 1942, even the
Times had relented, hiring Simon & Schuster editor Margaret
Petherbridge Farrar to edit its crossword puzzle. The influential
``grand lady of crosswords,'' as Shortz calls her, stayed in that
position until 1969.
   Mrs. Farrar helped bring themes, humor and ``modern playfulness''
to crosswords, Shortz said. Currently, a new school of puzzle makers
favors even more puns, jokes, fresh definitions or clues, pop
culture references and the living language, or non-dictionary
phrases, Shortz said.
   Virtually all of the puzzles printed today are written by about
200 writers, or ``constructors,'' according to Shortz, with another
1,000 or 2,000 people doing it occasionally.
   ``It takes a lot of patience,'' said Maura Jacobson, who got her
start under Mrs. Farrar's tutelage and now creates puzzles for New
York magazine.
   Mrs. Jacobson, a former kindergarten teacher, one-time
``Jeopardy!'' contestant and ``trivia nut,'' said it takes her about
25 hours to write a typical puzzle, somewhat longer than other
constructors, she said.
   Mrs. Jacobson starts with her theme, then lists theme-related
words, two of each length _ a true crossword is symmetrical. Then
she crosses the theme words, puts a black square where they end and
fills in the rest.
   ``Sometimes you get to the point where you have a great corner,
everything crossing nicely, and you find there's no such word,''
said Mrs. Jacobson, who lives in Hartsdale. ``Then you have to start
over.
   ``I go through more erasers than pencils,'' she said with a laugh.
   Her 25 hours of work can be polished off in mere minutes by a
world-class solver like Doug Hoylman, 45, an actuary from Chevy
Chase, Md., who won the American Crossword Puzzle Tournament in
August. He does the Washington Post daily puzzle in about five
minutes. The New York Times' puzzle takes maybe 10.
   ``I prefer to use pencils,'' he said. ``I make mistakes like
everyone else, and I have no need to impress anybody.''
   Good solvers, Hoylman said, have a broad range of knowledge and,
of course, are good with words.
   ``It takes the kind of mind more oriented to print than speech _
someone who thinks of a word as a group of letters rather than a
sound,'' he said.
   Rebecca Kornbluh, a 38-year-old weaver who lives in Mundelein,
Ill., won the U.S. Open crossword championship for three straight
years, but has retired from competition. The Brooklyn native still
buys The New York Times on Sunday, however.
   ``There's not too much of a challenge anymore,'' she said. ``It's
only how fast you can do it, and that's a way to miss the fun and
subtlety of modern-day crosswords _ the puns, the wordplay, the
off-the-wall definitions.''
   According to these experts, the most challenging puzzles can be
found in Games magazine, the Dell ``Champion'' series, and the
Sunday puzzles of Newsday, the San Francisco Examiner, The Boston
Globe, The Washington Post and The New York Times.
   ``Crosswords are popular because of the appeal of playing with
words, the humor in the clues and themes, and because of the
aesthetic appeal of the black and white squares,'' Shortz said.
``There's something very attractive about those empty squares _ they
just beg to be filled in.''

<TEXT>
   The Federal Aviation Administration should
quickly require commuter airlines to upgrade their passenger seats,
a sister government agency says.
   The National Transportation Safety Board made the recommendation
on Tuesday as part of its final report on last year's fatal crash of
a Ryan Air Service plane in Homer, Alaska, that killed 18 people.
   The report said the accident was ``partially survivable,'' but
found that none of the passenger seats withstood impact when the
Beech 1900-C twin-engine turboprop skidded to the ground just short
of the Homer Airport runway. There were only three survivors.
   Although the seats on the Ryan Air flight met current FAA
standards, NTSB staff investigators and board members said there
could have been fewer casualties if the aircraft's seats were
designed better. For years, board member Jim Burnett said, the NTSB
has been urging the FAA to adopt the tougher standards.
   ``Adding to the severity of the accident was the failure of the
FAA to adopt adequate standards for seat design,'' Burnett said.
   The FAA already requires new commuter airliners to have improved
passenger seats, and is considering a rule that would require
existing commuter planes to have older seats replaced with the
better models, FAA spokeswoman Theresa Greco said.
   The NTSB blamed the Nov. 23, 1987, crash on the flight crew's
inadequate supervision of cargo loading before takeoff. The 2,100
pounds of cargo was loaded too far to the aircraft's rear, causing
the pilot to lose control when he attempted to land, the board said.
   ``The captain should have known,'' said acting NTSB Chairman
James L. Kolstad.
   The board's report concluded that the crew members, who were
killed, ``employed improper procedures to determine the airplane's
weight and balance.''
   Te plane had a crew of two and 19 passengers _ many of them
hunters traveling with guns and boxes of frozen venison _ when it
plummeted to the ground short of the runway.
   Investigators had believed that ice on the plane may have caused
the crash, but the board said the ice ``did not cause but may have
exacerbated the loss of control.''
   Ryan Air had served more than 80 communities in Alaska, making it
the state's biggest commuter airliner. But the carrier has suffered
10 accidents in the last eight years, including four fatal crashes,
and was facing fines from the FAA for poor record-keeping and other
deficiencies.
   The airline has sought protection from creditors under Chapter 11
of federal bankruptcy laws, and in January its planes were grounded
as part of a consent agreement with the FAA. It resumed flying in
July, with 11 planes serving 36 cities.
   The staff report was adopted on a 4-1 vote, with Burnett voting
no because he first wanted to see changes in wording that were
agreed to in the board's meeting.

   When Sam Lieberman was a boy in Minneapolis, he
spent many nightmarish nights crying at the bedside of his mother as
she recounted the horrors of the Auschwitz death camp.
   ``I really had no choice but to listen, because my father
wouldn't,'' said Lieberman, one of more than 300 people from 15
countries attending the six-day First International Jerusalem
Conference of Children of Holocaust Survivors.
   The gathering, which ends Friday, offered lectures on issues such
as the pursuit of Nazi war criminals and creative responses to the
Holocaust, as well as tours of the Yad Vashem Holocaust Memorial and
the Western Wall, Judaism's holiest site.
   Lieberman, 40, said he attended the gathering to ``hear what
others are doing with the baggage their parents left them.''
   His own childhood, Lieberman said, was overshadowed by the
suffering of his late mother, Fraida, who spent nearly four years in
Auschwitz, a death camp in Nazi-occupied Poland.
   ``When I heard my mother crying at night, I would wake up and cry
along with her. She unloaded everything on me. I was 8 when I first
heard about Auschwitz,'' Lieberman said, holding back tears several
times during an interview Tuesday.
   Whenever a siren sounded in the neighborhood, his Polish-born
mother would jump up and drag her children into the basement,
thinking it was an air raid, said Lieberman, who works for a
brokerage firm.
   He and other children of Holocaust survivors felt isolated from
the rest of the Jewish community because ``our parents were just so
peculiar and crazy,'' he said.
   The feeling is shared by many of the about 900,000 children of
the world's 1.5 million Holocaust survivors, said Rabbi Abraham
Cooper, an associate dean of the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los
Angeles, one of the co-sponsors of the conference.
   In the past decade, support groups have sprung up in the United
States, helping about 2,500 people, Cooper said.
   Cooper noted that Lieberman's case was not typical because the
vast majority of Holocaust survivors would not talk to their
children about their experiences.
   ``Most children of survivors don't know a lot about their
parents,'' said Dulce Moche, 39, of San Francisco. ``We never asked
questions because it generated too much pain.''
   Ms. Moche's parents were raised in the Greek city of Salonika
where 95 percent of the 60,000 Jewish residents were killed by the
Nazis. Most of her parents' relatives were killed.
   Her mother, Lena, was sent to a prisoner of war camp instead of a
death camp because she held an American passport.
   ``My mother was a romantic person and, for her, the relatives
never died. She needed to maintain that illusion,'' said Ms. Moche,
an employee at a Jewish community center.
   The parents' suffering had a profound effect on her, Ms. Moche
said. ``They made me feel that the world is a precarious and
unstable place. Their fear shaped every aspect of their lives. For
example, my parents were terrified of authority,'' she said.
   The refusal to confront the past is not only common among
survivors, but also among Jewish communities overseas and in Israel,
said Yehuda Bauer, a professor of Holocaust studies at the Hebrew
University of Jerusalem.
   ``Those who came to Israel after the Holocaust were suppressed by
those who already lived there,'' Bauer told the conference. ``The
Israeli public couldn't comprehend what happened.''
   He argued that even though the Holocaust is frequently at the
center of state commemorations and public speeches, it is usually
misinterpreted to avoid painful questions.
   ``Our society is suffering from a collective trauma,'' he said.
``The only way to get out of this is to confront these problems.''
   Bauer also said the Holocaust is often used for political
purposes. ``Every politician today is using the Holocaust to back
his political agenda,'' Bauer said.
   He cited as examples claims by right-wingers that the PLO is a
Nazi organization, and charges by left-wingers that Israeli troops
crushing the Palestinian uprising behave like Nazis.

<HEAD>Japanese Food Self-Sufficiency Drops Below 50 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Last year, imported food accounted for the first
time for more than half the calories consumed by Japanese people,
the Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Ministry says in an annual
report.
   The report says the country's food self-sufficiency rate dropped
2 percentage points to 49 percent on a calorie basis during the
fiscal year that ended in March, Japanese newspapers said today.
   It was the largest one-year drop in the rate since 1973, when it
also declined 2 percent, the report said.
   The ministry attributed the drop to rising consumption of dairy
products, meat and other imported goods, accompanied by a gradual
decline in the amount of rice in the Japanese diet.
   The United States and other trading partners have pressured Japan
to open its market wider to agricultural imports, particularly rice.
Japan has maintained a policy of self-sufficiency in that grain,
which it says is necessary for national security as a basic
foodstuff.
   Japan is the biggest importer of agricultural products among
developed nations, and the largest purchaser of U.S. farm products.

<HEAD>EPA Says It Can't Stop Plant From Violating Consent Decree</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BARKER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Environmental Protection Agency says it is
powerless to stop Sharon Steel Corp. from operating a coke
production plant without required anti-pollution controls.
   ``We don't have EPA troops. We can't go out there and surround
the place,'' said Lee Blackburn of EPA's regional office in
Philadelphia.
   Blackburn said in interviews this week that Sharon Steel is
risking possible fines by operating its Monessen, Pa., plant without
anti-sulfur emission controls that are required by a federal court
consent decree.
   Each day the plant continues to run without the controls exposes
it to possible fines of up to $50,000 _ a maximum of $25,000 per day
for each of two operating coke oven batteries, Blackburn said.
   Sharon was the nation's 12th largest steel producer before it
filed for reorganization under Chapter 11 of federal bankruptcy laws
in April 1987. It now ranks No. 17.
   The Monessen plant is seen as a key to helping the company get
back on its feet by providing a reliable source of coke for the
company's steelmaking operations in Farrell, 75 miles northwest of
Pittsburgh. Coke is a raw material of steel.
   The coke plant began operating after the Pennsylvania Department
of Environmental Resources granted a temporary operating permit in
the middle of last month.
   The permit and an air quality assurance plan were approved by the
state on Nov. 14, even though a required inspection of the plant had
not yet taken place. The inspection by state and EPA officials
occurred four days later.
   The inspection was ``to make sure all the equipment is there. It
was a procedural thing. The plant had already been in operation
before,'' said Susan Woods, a spokeswoman for the Pennsylvania
Department of Environmental Resources.
   The EPA contends that the plant should not have begun operating
without the pollution equipment, regardless of what the state agency
did.

<HEAD>Shanghai Issues Rabies Alert, Instructs Owners To Kill Dogs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Shanghai, China's largest city, has issued its
first rabies alert in 30 years and instructed people to kill their
dogs, an official newspaper reported today.
   More than a dozen people have contracted rabies after being
bitten by dogs this year, the China Daily quoted Zhao Chonghe,
director of Shanghai's division of health and epidemic prevention,
as saying.
   He said none of the victims has died.
   The report said 100 people died of rabies in Shanghai in 1950,
but the city of 12 million has had no reported cases since 1958.
   Shanghai, like Beijing and other Chinese cities, prohibits the
keeping of dogs as pets, and there are only about 500 legally
registered dogs in the city for use by police and for other special
purposes, the daily said.
   However, it said there is a large underground market for dogs,
with one market selling 100 dogs a day, and that 2,000 people have
been injured by dogs in Shanghai this year.
   Zhao was quoted as saying authorities have issued a public alert
on the rabies threat and instructed owners to kill their dogs. The
dogs of those people who do not obey the instructions will be
confiscated, he said.

<HEAD>Study Says Navy Still Discriminates Against Minorities</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Navy has made gains against racial bias but
it still discriminates against blacks and other minorities in
recruitment and other areas, an internal Navy report says.
   ``Minorities are succeeding in the Navy. But in spite of this
progress and the realization of significant growth in career
opportunity, shortfalls continue for minorities in accessions,
promotions, advancements and distribution,'' the report said.
   ``The Navy must strongly reinforce its continuing commitment to
equal opportunity programs and efforts,'' the report said. ``Much
remains to be done.''
   The inch-thick report, which summarizes a special internal
analysis of Navy personnel policies ordered by the chief of naval
operations, was released earlier this week. The study was performed
by a naval group of 24 men and women and offers some candid advice
to Adm. Carlisle A.H. Trost, the chief of naval operations.
   The panel recommended 75 different changes or new initiatives to
Trost, and the Navy's top admiral has accepted all 75, the service
said Tuesday.
   The study group reported that black and Hispanic sailors and
officers are more likely to receive lower marks on their evaluation
reports; that ``a majority'' of sailors say they have ``heard racial
jokes or slurs at their commands,'' and that the Navy has not done
enough to educate officers on their responsibility to promote racial
equality.
   The Navy also has failed to direct its recruiting advertisements
to minority neighborhoods and to direct minorities into the
technical specialities or ratings where they have the best shot at
promotion, the group found.
   The group recommended more funds for recruiting minority
officers, and new initiatives at Navy training centers around the
country to guide minorities into technical ratings.
   And it also concluded that all officers on the way to executive
officer or commanding officer assignments ``receive training
covering the Navy's equal opportunity goals, significant minority
issues, results of the fitness report studies, promotion and
screening board results and the CNO's annual equal opportunity
report.''

   A 27-year-old teacher won top honors and $400 in an
annual shouting contest by bellowing a plea to a popular singer at
116.7 decibels, organizers said.
   ``Seiko Matsuda, give it to us straight when you will get
divorced!'' Ryuta Sasahara of Tokyo hollered Tuesday. Rumors that
Miss Matsuda's marriage to an actor is on the rocks abound in
Japan's tabloid press.
   Masahiro Shoda, 20, a student from neighboring Chiba prefecture,
took the ``fighting spirit'' award with the shout, ``Tokyo Giants,
try harder!'' _ a 115.0-decibel yell aimed at the third-place
finisher in Japanese professional baseball's Central League.
   Eighteen-year-old Noboru Takahashi, a student from Kanagawa
prefecture, screamed an insult at Tamori, the one-eyed Japanese
comedian: ``Tamori, you idiot!'' at 114.8 decibels to snare him the
``good performance prize.''
   The sound of a ringing telephone registers about 70 decibels,
while traffic noises reach 100 decibels, according to the
organizers. One's hearing can become damaged at 150 decibels.

   An investment adviser who disappeared last August
after allegedly taking more than $20 million of his clients' money
was extradited back here Tuesday night to face fraud and
embezzlement charges.
   Henry Gherman, 52, vanished from South Florida days before about
50 of his investors, including several doctors and nurses, received
a letter apologizing for the alleged theft.
   Gherman has been jailed since October in Tokyo, where he was
arrested after some American tourists recognized him in a Taiwan
hotel.
   Gherman arrived aboard a commercial flight at Miami International
Airport Tuesday, trying to hide his handcuffs with a trench coast as
he was escorted through the packed terminal by a dozen police
officers, FBI agents and U.S. Marshals.
   A Tokyo court had approved his extradition from Japan earlier
this month based on an Aug. 29 criminal complaint charging him with
two counts of fraud and five counts of embezzlement.
   He managed to share only a strained smile with family members
before being rushed off to jail pending a hearing Wednesday before
U.S. Magistrate Linnea Johnson in Miami federal court.
   ``I hurt for him,'' said Gherman's daughter, Shari Gherman Rance,
who refused to condemn her father despite his four-month
disappearance. ``He's still my father ... running off was wrong. He
should have stayed and faced the music, but he chose not to.''
   Gherman, whose North Miami Beach business handled investments and
pension funds for an assortment of Miami-area doctors, may have been
embezzling funds from clients for his own use since as early as
1978, said FBI spokesman Paul Miller, adding that an investigation
by the U.S. Attorney's office is continuing.
   ``We've located $2.2 million so far,'' Miller said. ``They're
still checking into further records.''

   A 46-year-old transient was arrested Tuesday in
connection with a woman's strangulation, the latest of 40 slayings
under investigation by a task force trying to determine if the
deaths are linked.
   Alan Michael Stevens was taken into custody Tuesday morning by
members of the Metropolitan Homicide Task Force in his van in San
Marcos, 38 miles north of San Diego, said San Diego sheriff's Sgt.
Liz Foster.
   Stevens, who was living in the van, was arrested for
investigation of the murder of Cynthia Lou McVey, 26, of Livermore,
Calif., whose nude body was found dumped Nov. 29 near a highway in
northern San Diego County.
   ``The task force will look at him to see if there's any
possibility he's linked to any other cases,'' said Foster.
   A connection between the deaths of the 40 slain women remains
under investigation, as does a possible connection to the 40 ``Green
River'' serial killings and eight disappearances in the Pacific
Northwest.
   There are similarities between the killings in San Diego and in
Washington and Oregon: Most of the victims were strangled and their
bodies dumped outside cities, and the killer or killers targeted
prostitutes or street people.
   But Lt. Dan Nolan of the Kings County Police Department in
Seattle, Wash., told the Times-Advocate of Escondido, Calif., that
there was apparently no connection between Stevens and the Green
River killings.
   Nolan said investigators were given Stevens' name some time ago
by San Diego investigators and do not believe he is the person they
are seeking.
   Foster said Stevens' arrest was the result of evidence obtained
after the discovery of McVey's body, but couldn't release details.
The sergeant did not know Stevens' occupation or hometown.
   McVey's death was caused by asphyxiation due to strangulation,
according to the coroner's report. She was a transient from the San
Francisco area and, according to her husband, she was a drug user.

   Martin Sheen declared a victory after
state Supreme Court justices questioned whether a judge could make
the actor post a $5,000 bond to keep him from trespassing at the
Nevada Test Site.
   ``We can't do that in America,'' Justice John Mowbray said
Tuesday of Sheen's January 1987 protest. Although a ruling wasn't
issued immediately, two other justices on the five-member court also
spoke in favor of Sheen.
   The actor was arrested as he arrived at the nuclear test site 65
miles northwest of Las Vegas for a protest after stating on ``Good
Morning America'' that he would ``hopefully commit civil
disobedience.''
   Justice of the Peace Bill Sullivan gave Sheen 48 hours to post a
$5,000 peace bond, and released him. Under state law, the threat of
a criminal act is enough to require the bond.
   Justice Tom Steffen said he couldn't see how Sheen's advance
statements could be construed as a threat of imminent criminal
behavior.
   ``This is a tremendous victory for all of us who speak out
against the arms race,'' Sheen said, adding that he plans to
continue his protests.

   This northeastern Wisconsin city is laying
claim to national fame as the birthplace of the hamburger, and it's
prepared for a beef with any city that thinks otherwise.
   ``We're going to establish Seymour as the national home of the
hamburger,'' vowed Thomas Duffey, a member of the Home of the
Hamburger Steering Committee.
   The group was formed about two years ago to look into promoting
the city as the 1885 birthplace of the hamburger.
   Committee members think potential challenges to the title could
come from St. Louis and New York City.
   ``We would welcome another city if they want to debate this,''
said Dick Tepp, committee chairman. ``It would only help us.''
   He said no other city could match Seymour's research of the
origins of the hamburger. The group even has asked the daughter of
the supposed hamburger-founder Charles R. Nagreen to help.
   Nagreen's sole survivor, Violet Gauerke, of Appleton, said her
father was 15 years old when he coined the name of the hamburger to
refer to the fried ground beef patties served at the Outagamie
County Fair in Seymour on Aug. 14, 1885.
   ``He was well known as Hamburger Charley,'' she said.
   Seymour expects to stake its claim as the hamburger capital next
August during its annual Seymour Celebration Days.

   A Christmas party spawned a little gorilla
warfare, but there were plenty of popcorn balls, cranberries and
hibiscus blossoms to go around when the Los Angeles Zoo held a
holiday party to toast their apes.
   It was definitely an adult party, though, said zoo spokeswoman
Lora LaMarca. ``They were not quick to share with their children,''
she said of the adult gorillas.
   The zoo staged the party for its 12 gorillas _ who range in age
from 18 months to 26 years and weigh 40 pounds to 450 pounds.
   The gorilla families were showered with gifts, including lengths
of fire hose, heavy duty tubs, rag dolls and burlap sacks, Ms.
LaMarca said.
   Tuesday's celebration for the apes was a first at the zoo, but it
was so successful, a party probably will be staged next year for the
orangutans and the year after for the chimpanzees, she said.

prophetic 10-year-old note from a high school chum who placed the ad.
   Ms. Hamburger and Marc Meltzer will be married in May.
   ``I think it was fate,'' she said. ``I really do believe that
things happen for a reason. ... I think that there was a definite
reason why the one ad I answered was his.
   In 1978, when they were seniors at Fair Lawn High School, Meltzer
wrote on the back of his wallet-size yearbook picture: ``Jenna,
let's make a pact to meet again in 10 years,'' and gave it to her.
They lost touch after graduation.
   In January, Meltzer's sister suggested he place a personal ad in
New York Magazine, which he said was the first and last ad he ever
placed. Ms. Hamburger wound up answering the ad.
   ``It's the weirdest thing that's ever happened. It certainly
gives you a reason to pause and ponder about fate,'' said Meltzer,
who lives in Basking Ridge. ``Jenna wasn't just someone who went to
my high school. She was someone I liked when I was in seventh
grade.''
   They had their first date earlier this year, and announced their
engagement in November.
   ``I think somebody, somehow was watching over us,'' said Ms.
Hamburger, of Clementon. ``There's some reason why we met the way we
did.''

<HEAD>Writer and Ex-head of Publishing House Dies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PUTNEY, Vt. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Edward H. Dodd Jr., a publisher and an author
of books about the South Seas, is dead at the age of 83.
   Dodd, who was the great-great-grandson of Moses Woodruff Dodd who
founded the publishing house of Dodd, Mead in 1839 in New York, died
at his home here on Monday.
   After graduating from Yale University in 1928, Dodd sailed a
76-foot schooner to the South Seas with four classmates and later
wrote about the adventure in ``Great Dipper to Southern Cross.''
   That journey was the beginning of his love affair with the
Pacific islands. He owned a house on one of the Society Islands, 200
miles from Tahiti, and divided his time between there and his home
in Vermont.
   Dodd wrote five books about Polynesia: ``Tales of Maui,''
``Polynesian Art,'' ``Polynesian Seafaring,'' ``Polynesia's Sacred
Isle,'' and ``The Rape of Tahiti.''
   Born in Manhattan, he went to work in the Dodd, Mead shipping
room in 1929, and the next year became a book salesman. He joined
the editorial staff in 1935 and became its head two years later. He
was president of the house from 1953 to 1957, when he semi-retired
to write full time.
   Dodd and his siblings approved the sale of Dodd, Mead in 1981 to
Thomas Nelson Inc., a Nashville-based religious publisher. Nelson
sold the company to private investors in 1984, and the firm is now
in liquidation.
   Dodd is survived by his three children. A memorial service will
be held Wednesday at 3 p.m. at River Valley Playhouse in Putney.

<HEAD>Pipe Cracking Problem May Date Back 30 Years, Energy Official Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pipes in the Savannah River nuclear material
production plant's cooling system may have been cracked when they
were installed 30 years ago, a federal energy official says.
   Richard Starostecki, the Energy Department's deputy assistant
secretary for safety, health and quality assurance, said Tuesday a
team of department and private industry experts has been formed to
determine the cause of the cracks and when they occurred.
   The pipes may have been cracked when many of them arrived at the
plant to be installed during the 1950s, he said. However, he also
said they may have been damaged during the installation itself or
later, during plant operations.
   All three Savannah River reactors have been shut down since
summer for safety upgrades and maintenance. They are the nation's
only source of tritium, a radioactive gas used to boost the power of
nuclear weapons.
   Officials at the Du Pont Co., operators of the plant, have said
they hope to have at least one of the reactors operating by late
spring or summer. The 300-square-mile facility is near Aiken, S.C.
   The Energy Department learned Dec. 8 of cracks in a main cooling
line that had been found months earlier by engineers for Du Pont.
The cracks were found in a section of pipe removed last year.
   Another crack was found Friday in the auxiliary cooling line of
another Savannah River reactor.
   Pipes in the plant's cooling systems are periodically replaced as
needed following inspections, Starostecki said.
   Du Pont officials were quoted in Wednesday's editions of the
Augusta (Ga.) Chronicle as saying the defective material wasn't
pipe, but components such as cast stainless steel nozzles or parts
of valves used to join cooling pipe to the reactor vessel.
   Starostecki was quoted by the Georgia newspaper as saying that an
internal Du Pont memo dated April 19 indicated that stainless steel
replacement pipe was found to contain cracks, which Du Pont
employees tried to mend themselves.
   Dr. Joseph Spencer, Du Pont program manager for reactor
technology and scientific computations, told the newspaper, ``Yes,
there were cracks (in plant components) ... but they were carefully
examined and repaired before being put in. There is no safety hazard
to the reactor.''
   ``Several of the components had surface cracks ... that were
formed during the manufacturing process,'' Spencer told the
newspaper. ``These cracks have been continually monitored and no
growth has occurred.''
   ``The cracks may not have been there when they were installed,
but (the problem may be) the things that were done in the
installation ... or water chemistry control,'' Starostecki said.
   Another problem may have been Du Pont's timing in notifying
federal officials, Starostecki said, adding that the plant's
operators knew in March about the cracks that were reported to the
Energy Department in December.
   Starostecki said he did not know how soon the team would present
its findings.

   A 368-pound woman and her 338-pound son
shed a combined 253 pounds under a judge's threat to place the
teen-ager in a foster home unless he lost weight and stopped
skipping school.
   ``It's like a miracle, because I was near death,'' said Nancy
Gray, 48, who along with her 16-year-old son, Joseph, enrolled in a
diet program in upstate New York and in Fort Walton Beach, Fla.
   ``I was so close to 400 pounds it was ridiculous, and by staying
in bed I thought nobody would notice it,'' said Ms. Gray, who lost
102 pounds.
   Joseph Gray, who lost 151 pounds, said he frequently skipped
school to take care of his mother and because he was embarrassed
about his weight.
   ``When lunch time came around I was so hungry I would ask one of
my friends to get me a double lunch, and I would take it to the
bathroom and eat it there.''
   After a judge said Gray could be sent to a foster home, Ms. Gray
enlisted the care of diet expert Dick Gregory of Plymouth and in
June, the two joined 11 others under Gregory's care.
   ``They told us when we first got here that within seven days our
appetite would be gone,'' Gray said Monday. ``I had a lot of doubts
about that, because I ate a lot of food. Then came the third day,
and my appetite was totally gone.''
   Ms. Gray, whose weight complicated her respiratory problems, said
she has gone from using a wheelchair to walking for three hours
every day.
   The Grays, who live in Duxbury, are leaving Gregory's supervised
care six months early so that Joseph can return to school, but they
don't expect to revert to their old habits.
   ``I know it's going to be different,'' Gray said. ``I used to
just sit around and eat. Now I'm going to be going out, going to
school and doing all kinds of things.''

   The Mortgage Bankers Association of America said Tuesday that
4.73 percent of the payments on the 10.8 million mortgages surveyed
in the July-September period were at least 30 days late.
   It was the lowest rate since the third quarter of 1987, when 4.71
percent of the mortgage payers were behind. The delinquency rate was
4.9 percent in the second quarter of 1988.
   The foreclosure rate also edged down to 0.26 percent in the third

   President-elect George Bush's inaugural

   Billed as the most open inaugural celebration ever, the
Presidential Inaugural Committee said the minimum contribution had
been instituted because of time and administrative difficulties in

   Committee spokesman Ed Cassidy said Tuesday the requirement was
dropped because organizers ``never anticipated the number of people

   By the end of a 13-day trade fair, Soviet
officials found the American business world a bit baffling, but the
more than $300 million worth of contracts signed at the exhibition
left them eager to learn more.
   And along with the contracts, they believe the fair made a great
advance in reducing misconceptions about Soviet goods.
   ``There was a myth that (U.S.) tariffs should not be reduced
because the Soviets didn't have anything worth selling. The myth is
dead,'' said Vladimir N. Cheklin, senior vice president of the
US-U.S.S.R. Trade and Economic Council.
   The contracts signed at the fair, which ended Tuesday, included
export-import and joint venture agreements for products ranging from
chemical equipment to sweatshirts, said Bagrat Arutyunov, foreign
exhibitions chief of the Soviet Chamber of Commerce. But the Soviets
admitted there were some segments of the market they had misjudged.
   They had expected Americans' love of home appliances to spark
strong interest in their high-fidelity equipment and proudly
displayed their best turntables. However, Cheklin said, they found
out that phonographs are losing ground to cassette and compact-disc
players.
   ``Now we know better where to concentrate our efforts,'' he said.
   And computer software teaching high school chemistry was designed
with the assumption that American students have a better grounding
in sciences than they actually do, said Alexy Botcharov of the
Soviet Academy of Sciences.
   The fair, which opened on the day Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev cut short his New York visit, was the first in which the
cost was borne entirely by the Soviet companies involved, rather
than relying in part on government support. It also was a departure
from previous exhibitions in terms of style.
   There was little political or nationalist propaganda _ just a few
flags, a slide show and a photograph of Gorbachev. Aside from some
displays of books and art objects, the products on display showed
few overt indications of where they were made; few trade names were
in the Cyrillic alphabet.
   Such Westernizing of Soviet products was seen as a paradox by
some people at the fair. On one hand, it may be necessary to
overcome Soviet goods' reputation of shoddiness, said Greg Rohn, of
Canada's Winchester Co., which distributes Soviet products there.
   But, he added, ``it seems that Russian products are starting to
become almost trendy'' as relations with the West improve.
   The Soviet Simvol cooperative hopes to capitalize on that aspect
with its line of T-shirts and sweatshirts emblazoned with Russian
slogans and the logo of Moscow State University. John Odoxta of
Sanctuary Music, a U.S. company involved in a joint venture with the
cooperative, said the shirts were popular souvenirs among fair
visitors.
   That was a heartening sign for future business, but current U.S.
tariffs plus manufacturing costs meant that selling the shirts at
U.S. market prices brought him a $20-per-shirt loss.
   Arutyunov said one of the most important aspects of the contracts
signed at the fair was the guidance that Western firms would be able
to provide in marketing and advertising because communism had long
eschewed such capitalist techniques.
   ``I can honestly say we're in the Stone Age in advertising,'' he
said.

   A judge has again squelched a pirate rock 'n' roll
radio ship, saying the right to free speech does not include the
right to radio broadcasts without a license from the Federal
Communications Commission.
   But the engineer of the unlicensed station aboard the Sarah,
moored off New York, said Tuesday he hasn't given up the seagoing
enterprise even though it has broadcast for only two brief periods
since 1987.
   ``Everybody in the project is absolutely frustrated,'' Al Weiner,
former owner of the old fishing vessel, said Tuesday. ``We could go
on the air and not harm or create one single problem. It's just that
we've got a hysterical FCC.''
   Weiner had asked U.S. District Judge John J. McNaught to lift a
temporary restraining order stopping broadcasts. But McNaught ruled
that the FCC was right to shut the Sarah down.
   Weiner's attorney, Jeremiah Gutman of the New York Civil
Liberties Union, argued that the Sarah was a foreign-registered ship
in international waters and didn't come under the FCC's
jurisdiction. He also maintained that since the station, Radio New
York International, was broadcasting on an unassigned AM frequency,
the FCC was violating First Amendment rights to free speech.
   McNaught rejected those arguments, noting that the government
said numerous stations could be subject to interference if the Sarah
broadcast.
   ``The First Amendment does not guarantee anyone the right to
broadcast by radio,'' the judge wrote.
   The judge also said international agreements ban the
establishment of radio stations aboard ships outside national
territories.
   Weiner maintained that the Sarah is an international ship because
it is registered in Sealand, a self-proclaimed principality in the
North Sea off the coast of Britain. But prosecutors argued that
Britain does not recognize Sealand.
   ``The FCC's licensing requirements guarantee orderly use of the
airwaves. The defendants cannot hope to evade these requirements by
taking to the ocean waves,'' U.S. Attorney Frank McNamara said after
the judge's decision issued Dec. 13.
   Gutman said he is studying the ruling, and probably will file an
appeal.
   The Sarah has broadcast only twice, from more than three miles
off shore. In July 1987, Radio New York International operated off
Long Island for about four days before agents of the FCC and the
Coast Guard boarded the ship and stopped broadcasts.
   This fall, the Sarah was registered as a Maine pleasure boat and
headed back to the waters off Long Island, broadcasting for another
four days before the temporary restraining order was issued.
   Weiner has since sold the ship to a British company, but has a
five-year option to repurchase.

<TEXT>
   Vendors in the souvenir
stalls around the Church of the Nativity are keeping their Christmas
lights and ornaments in packing boxes this year.
   In honor of the Palestinian uprising, city officials are refusing
to sponsor holiday celebrations in the birthplace of Christ.
   Israeli soldiers stood guard Tuesday as Israeli civilians
employed by the army built a platform for a choir concert to
entertain the hundreds of pilgrims who officials hope will come to
worship in Bethlehem on Christmas Eve.
   But Arab officials in this West Bank city have decreed that there
will be no municipal decorations this year and no traditional
holiday reception for diplomats or Boy Scouts on parade.
   ``It is a protest for those killed, injured and detained,'' said
the town's Palestinian Christian mayor, Elias Freij. ``The people
are not in a mood to celebrate or rejoice.''
   More than 330 Palestinians have died in clashes with the Israeli
army since they launched their ``intefadeh,'' or uprising, against
Israel's 21-year occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Thirteen Israelis also have died in the 12 months of unrest.
   The underground leadership of the uprising has declared Dec. 24
``a national day of mourning,'', calling a general strike to close
shops and restaurants on the normally busy holiday eve.
   For its part, Israel's Tourism Ministry has tried to maintain
some semblance of Christmases past.
   ``Nothing has changed in the intrinsic meaning of Christmas in
Bethlehem,'' it said in a statement. ``No secular municipal action
will either dampen the religious fervor of pilgrims or mar their
freedom of worship in Bethlehem.''
   To this end, the ministry is sponsoring Christmas Eve
performances by choirs from Switzerland, Spain and the Shiloh
Baptist Church in Washington, D.C.
   Roman Catholics, Anglicans and other Christian denominations have
put out pamphlets publicizing events ranging from the Catholic
patriarch's procession Saturday afternoon to midnight Masses in
Bethlehem chapels.
   Just how many pilgrims will travel to Bethlehem for Christmas
rites is uncertain. Tourism for the year is down 14 percent, and
Israel admits many potential visitors have been frightened away by
the daily reports of clashes.
   Peace and joy were not part of the mood Tuesday on Manger Square
outside the Church of the Nativity, which covers the grotto where
the Bible says Christ was born.
   Israeli soldiers lounging near the undecorated municipal tree
were pelted with stones by Palestinian youths, who then fled up a
narrow street in the Arab market. Street hawkers complained of bad
business.
   The holiday sadness extends deep into the Palestinian community,
including among its Christians.
   There are an estimated 35,000 Christian Arabs in the occupied
territories and about 100,000 within Israeli borders, according to
Geries S. Khoury, director of the Al-Liqa Center for Religious
Studies and chairman of the religion program at Bethlehem University.
   Khoury, a Greek Catholic, says there will be no Christmas
presents for his wife and four children, no festive dinner at his
home.
   ``The only present I would like to give them is the story of the
suffering of my people,'' Khoury said.
   Nicholas Canavati, owner of a large Bethlehem souvenir store,
said he and other businessmen were called in by Israeli officials
this week for what he described as ``a gentlemanly talk.''
   He said the officials asked if it wouldn't be better for business
if stores got out their decorations.
   ``I said yes,'' Canavati says. ``But I told them there are more
important things than business.''
   His store remains unadorned, and he is unconvinced flashing
lights and colored ornaments would be a lure.
   ``Why should anyone come to Bethlehem when the town is full of
arms and soldiers rather than peace, which is the symbol after all
of the man born here,'' Canavati said.

   The U.S. dollar fell Wednesday against the Japanese
yen, while share prices advanced on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
   The dollar closed at 124.22 yen, down 0.48 yen from Tuesday's
close of 124.70 yen. Despite its higher opening at 125.48 yen, the
currency fell sharply while moving in a range of 124.10 to 125.50
yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which gained
97.86 points the previous day, added another 130.25 points, or 0.44
percent, closing at 29,698.19.
   The U.S. currency's firmness in early Tokyo trading followed
similar trends in overseas markets, dealers said.
   But the dollar fell quickly as speculative investors and trading
companies began selling the currency to cash in gains made when the
dollar neared the mid 125-yen level, said one dealer with Bank of
Tokyo. Other investors were buying the dollar when it fell back to
around 124.50 yen, the dealer said, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   The dollar's strength in early trading and prospects for lower
Japanese interest rates contributed to the rise in the Nikkei, said
an analyst with Nomura Securities, Japan's largest brokerage.
   ``Investors are interested in export- and real estate-related
issues because of the higher dollar,'' he said, speaking on
condition of anonymity. Trading otherwise was inactive because of
the year end, the analyst said.

   Linda Van Eaton of Kansas City had been awarded $8,500 after her
appaloosa ``Velvet'' was punched by Roland Thon. The Missouri Court

improper because there was no expert testimony.
   Ms. Van Eaton also was awarded damages for her claims of assault

   Thon said he punched the horse in self-defense when it charged
him as Ms. Van Eaton rode along a road near his home.
   Besides punching the horse, Thon yelled at Ms. Van Eaton and
threw gravel at her, according to court papers.
   Ms. Van Eaton, who had sought $99,000, said the horse became shy
after it was punched and would buck, fidget or bolt when people
approached.

<TEXT>
   The government released 281 political
prisoners today as part of a sweeping amnesty and the freed
dissidents vowed to topple President Roh Tae-woo and drive U.S.
forces out of South Korea.
   Roh ordered the amnesty involving 2,015 ``politically motivated
offenders'' as part of efforts to defuse nationwide furor over
demands for the punishment of former president Chun Doo-hwan for
human rights abuses and corruption under his authoritarian regime.
   In addition to the releases, the Justice Ministry said the civil
rights of 1,581 dissidents had been restored, the sentences of 92
people reduced and 61 fugitive radical students dropped from police
wanted lists.
   Dissident leaders charged that 300 political prisoners remained
in jail and dismissed the amnesty as a government trick to
perpetuate its control.
   Released prisoners and supporters called for Roh's fall and the
expulsion of the 42,000 U.S. troops based in the country.
   Park Suk-yook, a dissident freed from a prison in the southern
city of Kwangju, told supporters, ``All prisoners of conscience must
be freed to realize democracy ... I will fight, together with my
comrades, until the military dictatorship is terminated in this
land.''
   ``Drive out the Yankees,'' dozens of protesters chanted in
Chongju south of Seoul as they greeted Moon Boo-shik, who was
serving a 20-year sentence for his part in a 1982 attack on a U.S.
cultural center in the southern port of Pusan.
   Kim Hyun-jang, also involved in the Pusan attack, ridiculed the
amnesty. ``I am sorry to be released when many comrades are still
held in prison,'' he said.
   One person died and three others were injured when the Pusan
center was set on fire in an anti-U.S. protest. Dissidents contend
Washington supports authoritarian rule in South Korea and demand the
withdrawal of U.S. forces based in the country under a defense
treaty.
   A government spokesman, who declined to be named, warned the
released dissidents not to engage in violent anti-government
protests.
   ``The government will deal sternly with radicals' future actions
which are seen as defying the nation's free democratic system,'' he
said.
   Justice Ministry officials said 224 ``anti-state criminals''
remained in jail, but said nearly all were communist North Korean
spies.
   Roh appealed to the nation last month to forgive Chun and
promised to free political prisoners as part of a series of measures
to wipe out vestiges of the Chun government.
   Many South Koreans still identify Roh with his predecessor,
although the new government has dismantled Chun's authoritarian
controls and helped introduce widespread political reforms.
   Chun, a former general who took power with military backing in
1980, went into voluntary internal exile last month after
apologizing to the nation for abuses under his rule.
   The opposition parties are demanding Chun appear before a
National Assembly probe before the question of the pardon proposed
by Roh is addressed. Roh wants Chun pardoned without further action.
   Dissidents and some mainline opposition leaders hope to use
controversy over Chun to generate opposition to Roh, a former
general who won presidential elections last December. Dissidents
have little public support, but many Koreans are angry about Chun
and want some kind of action.
   Prime Minister Kang Young-hoon said in a statement Tuesday the
amnesty ``is aimed at completely resolving the political controversy
that has been going on for months over the question of politically
motivated offenders.''
   Among those having his civil rights restored was Kim Tae-kun, a
leading dissident who won the Robert Kennedy Human Rights Award.
Kim, released in June, drew five years in 1986 on charges of
attempting to overthrow the government and spreading pro-North
Korean propaganda.
   Kim claims he was forced to make a false confession under torture.

<HEAD>Elderly, Ill Couple Die in Pact</HEAD>

   An elderly couple chose to die with
dignity in a murder-suicide pact rather than face life in a nursing
home, according to a letter they wrote to a newspaper columnist
before their deaths.
   Bernard and Frances Sheingold, both in their 80s, were found dead
in their bedroom last week. Both were shot in the temple apparently
with a pistol found between them, said Detective Sgt. Tom Weschler.
   ``I have a choice of going into a living cemetery, but I do not
have a choice to be put to sleep peacefully as my pet has,'' Mrs.
Sheingold wrote columnist Charles Whited of The Miami Herald. ``Why
do we treat our pets better than we do our seniors?''
   Whited wrote in the newspaper Tuesday that he had never met the
couple.
   Their letter, apparently written just before their deaths, told
of the problems they faced as Mrs. Steingold's cancer worsened and
her husband's health deteriorated, and of their fears of entering a
nursing home.
   ``I have been in one of the so-called best homes in Miami ... and
it was a horror,'' she wrote. ``All the seniors I have talked to opt
for the pets' solution.''
   She bitterly criticized the medical system for passing them
around from specialist to specialist without being able to help them.
   ``The doctors treat us as if we were money machines,'' her letter
complained.
   Sheingold's 55-year-old son, Earl, also received a letter, saying
the couple could not take the strain of living any more.
   He described his parents as ``the above average, intelligent,
all-American people next door,'' and said they had been together for
60 years.
   Sheingold said the weekend before their deaths, his father, who
had tended to his wife's health but refused to go to the doctor
himself, had begun speaking of an obituary.
   Some months earlier they had asked Earl Sheingold to buy a gun.
Although he at first resisted, he gave in, knowing they would
eventually buy it themselves, he said.
   They planned their deaths carefully, laying out keys, notes and
special instructions, he said.
   They then got into bed, and Bernard Sheingold apparently fired a
shot into his wife's head.
   ``I think he waited until she had dozed off,'' the son said.
``She looked like she was sleeping when it ended. My father was in a
half-sitting position, very peaceful, like somebody who was going to
watch TV.''
   He said he did not hate his parents for what they did.
   ``It's hard to accept, but I know they're better off,'' the son
said. ``I love them more now than I ever did.''

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi of India and Chinese
leader Deng Xiaoping agreed today to restore friendly ties between
the world's most populous countries despite a long-standing border
dispute.
   ``Welcome, my young friend,'' the 84-year-old senior Chinese
leader said to Gandhi, 44, as the two leaders met in the Great Hall
of the People.
   ``Beginning with your visit we can restore our relationship as
friends,'' Deng said. ``The two countries' leaders will become
friends, the countries will become friends, the people will become
friends.''
   ``I agree and would like to thank you for your warm welcome,''
Gandhi said.
   Deng said he knew Gandhi's grandfather, Jawaharlal Nehru, who
came to China in 1954, the last Indian prime minister to do so.
   ``In the considerable period of time in between, there was
unpleasantness with each other,'' Deng said. ``But let us forget it.
We should be looking forward.''
   Later at a speech at presitigious Qinghua University, Gandhi
summed up the goal of his five-day trip.
   ``I have every hope that during this visit we will, together with
our Chinese friends, build a better political climate for the
solution of the border issue,'' he said.
   In the past, India has said it would only improve bilateral ties
once progress was made on the border.
   ``I am heartened that the Chinese leadership is more than
prepared to put behind us past rancor and past prejudices,'' Gandhi
said. ``I am heartened that we are both prepared not to be mired in
the past.''
   Chinese-Indian relations were good in the 1950s but a boundary
dispute led the two countries into war in 1962.
   China claims 36,000 square miles of Indian land. India rejects
the claim and demands China return the 15,200 square miles it took
in the 1962 war.
   During Gandhi's visit, China and India are expected to sign
agreements on civil aviation, border trade and science and
technology. Consular offices in Shanghai and Bombay may also be
established.
   Little progress is expected on the border.
   Gandhi arrived in Beijing on Monday and spent most of the day
meeting with Premier Li Peng. His visit marked the first time Indian
and Chinese leaders have met since 1960, when then-Premier Chou
Enlai went to New Delhi.
   Gandhi and Li discussed the border problem and Gandhi called for
a renewal of friendship between the two nations.
   ``It is now time to look beyond the past,'' Gandhi said at a
banquet Monday night. ``It is now time to look forward to the
future. It is now time to restore the relationship between our two
countries.''
   In the past, India has said it would only improve bilateral ties
once progress was made on the border.
   Gandhi also discussed Tibet, trade and the Cambodian conflict
with his Chinese hosts in talks his official spokesman described as
``warm, cordial and very friendly.''
   On Tuesday, Gandhi met with China's president, Yang Shangkun, and
again talked about China's troubled region of Tibet.
   Gandhi said his country will not interfere in China's internal
affairs. The issue is sensitive because Tibet's spiritual leader,
the Dalai Lama, fled to India in 1959 after an abortive,
anti-Chinese uprising.
   Gandhi was to meet tonight with Zhao Ziyang, general secretary of
the Chinese Communist Party. On Thursday, he is to fly to the
ancient city of Xian and Friday he will go to Shanghai.
   India was one of the first non-socialist countries to recognize
Communist China soon after Beijing's 1949 revolution. In the early
1960s, relations deteriorated over the border question and political
disagreements.
   Relations began to improve in the late 1979s but the border
remains heavily guarded. The two countries began border talks in
1981 but have made little progress in eight rounds, the last of
which was held in November 1987.
   China has more than 1 billion people. India, the world's largest
democracy, has a population of about 800 million.

   U.S. Customs Service agents using blowtorches spent
30 hours ripping apart the belly of a Panamanian freighter before
finding their version of a white Christmas: 4,792 pounds of cocaine
hidden in a secret compartment.
   The shipment, which was destined for holiday consumers, brought a
five-day total of cocaine seized on two arriving freighters to 6,733
pounds, according to authorities, who said the shipments were from
the same organization.
   The amount confiscated made it one of the largest cocaine busts
in U.S. history, said authorities, who estimated the drugs' street
value at $50 million.
   ``We had a little Christmas party,'' Customs spokesman Michael
Sheehan said.
   The latest bust came Tuesday after Customs agents, acting on a
tip, spent the weekend staking out the Panamanian-registered
freighter Santo Domingo Express, authorities said. The 300-foot
ship, originating from northern Colombia, docked at the Miami River,
Sheehan said.
   No one appeared to unload the vessel, and agents boarded and
seized the ship after the captain tried to leave port Monday,
Sheehan said.
   Agents were forced to open sealed compartments in the empty
vessel's hold, where they found nothing, then spent 30 hours cutting
through a ballast tank holding the cocaine, which was numbered,
marked and stuffed into duffel bags, authorities said.
   ``This shipment was designed to be brought in during the holiday
season,'' Woodrow Kirk, a Customs agent, told NBC News.
   Initial evidence suggests the two shipments are related, said
Sheehan, who did not elaborate on the theory.
   ``I don't care what anyone says, if you take 7,000 pounds out of
any drug organization it's going to make a big dent,'' said Sheehan.
The investigation was continuing, authorities said.
   The captain, who was the only person aboard at the time of the
seizure, was arrested on smuggling charges. His name was not
immediately available, said Sheehan.
   Last Thursday, Customs agents making a similar surveillance on
the Miami River boarded a Haitian freighter and discovered 1,941
pounds of cocaine concealed inside a fuel tank.
   Three Colombians seen driving away from the freighter Cha Cha
were arrested, as well as a Colombian member of the ship's crew,
Sheehan said.
   The Customs Service's Riverwatch initiative, an intensive effort
to slow the flow of drugs into Miami ports, has resulted in seven
seizures totaling 10,982 pounds during the past three months,
Sheehan said.
   Cocaine has turned up in a shipment of kidney beans on a
Colombian freighter, in a load of wicker furniture from Chile and
inside cans of glue from Venezuela, federal agents said.
   The largest previous single cocaine seizure in the United States
was 9,230 pounds found inside a shipment of lumber at the Port of
Tampa last April 28. Previously, the largest seizure was 8,700
pounds found stuffed inside hollowed wooden boards delivered to Port
Everglades near Fort Lauderdale in November 1987.

   Richard VanDeBoe quit his meatpacking job
and planned to buy a house with his girlfriend when he won a $13.6
million lottery. But then, his debts, his ex-wife and his estranged
wife caught up with him.
   VanDeBoe and his girlfriend, Kelly Elsinga, received their first
$510,750 lottery payment Tuesday, but most of VanDeBoe's $255,375
share was withheld under a court order.
   And he'll need more than the $21,000 he was left with just to pay
taxes next spring, his lawyer says.
   VanDeBoe bought the winning $1 ticket for Lotto America's Dec. 3
drawing. When he claimed the jackpot two days later, he told a news
conference he gave the ticket to Ms. Elsinga as a Christmas present
after he knew it was a winner.
   ``I'm scared, happy _ everything all at once,'' said Ms. Elsinga
at the news conference. ``We're just one big happy family, happier
now.''
   She said they would buy a house and Christmas presents for her
two children.
   ``I'm supposed to work tomorrow but I'm not going back,''
VanDeBoe, who lives in suburban Norwalk with Ms. Elsinga and her
children, said at the time.
   But soon, the estranged wife came forward, claiming he gave the
ticket to Ms. Elsinga to avoid having to pay her a cut of the
winnings. They were married in 1981, separated three months later
and never got divorced because ``we could never afford one,'' said
Kandy McCullough VanDeBoe.
   Then, the former wife showed up, also questioning his motives,
saying VanDeBoe was years behind in child support payments for their
three children.
   The state also made a child support claim.
   The Internal Revenue Service joined in, declaring that if a gift
had been made, VanDeBoe could owe millions of dollars in gift taxes.
   A breakthrough came at a court hearing last week when VanDeBoe,
through his lawyer, agreed to pay his child support debt and to
clear up claims the state had against him.
   VanDeBoe, 37, and Ms. Elsinga, 27, entered into a joint-winner
agreement to settle the gift tax issue. It also permitted Ms.
Elsinga to get her half of the money while the courts sort through
the claims against VanDeBoe.
   Two orders signed Tuesday by Judge Luther Glanton dissolved prior
injunctions and ordered VanDeBoe's lawyer, William Wimer, to make
agreements with the two other women, with $100,000 held back for
each.
   Wimer also was ordered to pay VanDeBoe's debts, including $22,348
in child support and thousands of dollars in debts to retailers and
hospitals.
   Wimer picked up the check at Lotto America headquarters in Des
Moines on Tuesday. The $13.6 million jackpot was the largest offered
by Lotto America since the weekly multistate lottery began in
February. Tickets are sold in Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Rhode Island,
Oregon, West Virginia and the District of Columbia.
   The $510,750 check was the first of 20 annual payments for
VanDeBoe and Ms. Elsinga. Already deducted from their winnings was
$170,000 for state and federal taxes, and Wimer said they will each
owe $25,000 more in taxes.
   Wimer said he'll recommend to VanDeBoe that he not spend the
$21,000 he was left with. ``I'm going to say, `Get your bills paid.
You've got 19 years to get ahead,''' said Wimer. ``I think he'll
agree with that.''
   Wimer said Ms. Elsinga can spend her half, $255,375, any way she
wants.
   ``We're just going to spend it and be happy,'' Ms. Elsinga said
last week after Lotto America approved the joint-owner agreement.
   Neither of the winners showed up Tuesday when Wimer picked up the
check.
   ``Richard is shy,'' said Wimer. ``He wanted me to do this.''

<HEAD>Jackson Calls For More Minority Hiring, Cites Ford As an Example</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ford Motor Co. and Operation PUSH culminated six
years of negotiations by signing an agreement to promote ``mutual
affirmative action goals'' that will target $541 million to minority
businesses next year.
   Peter J. Pestillo, vice president of employee and external
affairs for Ford, said Tuesday's agreement formalizes a process that
began in 1982.
   ``Ford has been working hard to help open doors for minorities,''
Pestillo said. ``Today we are pledging to continue to seek
improvements for blacks in all functional areas of the company.''
   While the signed agreement itself does not specify amounts that
Ford will direct to minority businesses, it pledges to ``set
quantifiable benchmarks wherever feasible, and ... measure progress
in all affected areas.''
   Ford has ``set the pace'' for hiring, promoting and doing
business with minority companies, the Rev. Jesse Jackson, the
founder of Operation PUSH, said Tuesday at a joint news conference
to announce the agreement.
   ``Multiply it times Forbes 500 and you would have a radical
assault on poverty, illness, disease, despair in this country,'' he
said.
   The agreement commits Ford and Operation PUSH to a ``continuing,
cooperative arrangement ... with the goal of achieving mutual
affirmative action goals.''
   Operation PUSH _ People United to Serve Humanity _ is aimed at
improving economic opportunities for minorities.
   Blacks sold $240 million worth of goods and services to Ford in
1987, a 100 percent increase over 1985, the automaker said.
   Goods and services bought from all minorities last year totaled
$341 million. That figure increased to $421 million this year, and
Ford said it has a goal of buying $541 million worth of goods and
services from minority suppliers in 1989.
   PUSH officials said the number of the Ford dealerships owned by
blacks increased from 20 in 1982 to 245 this year _ a total more
than that of the other U.S. automakers combined. They said the
company hopes to have 75 more black-owned dealerships by the end of
next year.
   Pestillo also said blacks occupy 3 percent of the management jobs
at Ford, an increase of 50 percent since 1982. He said the company
is doing more business with companies owned by blacks to purchase
such things as supplies, insurance and advertising.

<HEAD>Dollar Finishes Lower Against Yen, Shares Up</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar reversed direction and finished
lower against the Japanese yen today, while share prices rose
sharply on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
   The dollar finished at 124.22 yen, down 0.48 yen from Tuesday's
close of 124.70 yen. It opened at 125.48 yen but then fell sharply,
moving in a wide range between 124.10 and 125.50 yen.
   The currency's higher opening in Tokyo after a 0.68-yen gain on
Tuesday was attributed to similar trends on overseas markets. But at
the higher rates, speculators and trading companies began selling
dollars, dealers said.
   Daiwa Bank's Takamasa Yamasaki said concerted dollar-selling by
speculative dealers and investment banks resulted in the currency's
sharp drop from the mid-125-yen level in early trading.
   ``But the majority of traders were sitting on the sidelines since
the Christmas holidays are approaching on overseas markets,'' he
said.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, a 97.86-point
gainer Tuesday, added another 130.25 points, or 0.44 percent,
closing at 29,689.19. The index gained 41.02 points in the morning
session and rose sharply in the afternoon.
   Dealers said stock investors were in a cautious mood because of
the fluctuation of the dollar-yen rate in the currency market.
   ``Market players were wondering why the dollar was so high this
morning, but as it began falling, participants' uncertainties were
erased, which helped the Nikkei's rise,'' said a dealer with a major
securities firm in Tokyo.
   The Nikkei's afternoon gain also resulted from some foreign
securities firms aggressively buying in the spot market and selling
future issues priced higher in the SIMEX market to make profits, he
said. SIMEX is a futures market in Singapore, where the Nikkei's 225
issues are listed. Wednesday was SIMEX's settlement day for December
trading.

   Workers inspecting space shuttle
Atlantis have found a tiny crack on a bearing part in one of the
shuttle's high-pressure liquid-oxygen pumps, officials said.
   The crack was found Sunday on a pump in main engine No. 3 during
normal inspections at the Kennedy Space Center, said Conrad Nagel,
who is in charge of preparing Atlantis for launch.
   Nagel said officials already had planned to replace the pumps,
which send liquid oxygen to the main engines.
   The pumps will be shipped to the manufacturer, Rockwell
International's Rocketdyne division in California, to determine the
cause of the crack.
   Nagel said Tuesday it was too early to say how the crack would
affect future launches. Atlantis' next launch is scheduled for late
April.
   Atlantis completed a secret four-day military mission on Dec. 6.

   A stranded woman was able to return home to her
injured husband after a police officer called on his colleagues for
help and they chipped in to pay for her bus ticket to South Carolina.
   ``It's people like all of you that make life every day worth it!
Have a Merry Christmas! And thanks again!,'' Samantha Reed wrote in
a tear-stained letter she gave an officer before boarding the bus
recently.
   Lt. Mike Hibbs, who was working off-duty at the Greyhound bus
station, was the first to notice Mrs. Reed. ``She looked like she
had a problem,'' he said.
   Mrs. Reed told police she was en route to Nevada to visit her
mother, who has cancer, when she learned that her husband had been
seriously injured in an automobile accident back home in
Spartansburg, S.C.
   But even after she turned in the unused portion of her ticket to
Nevada, Mrs. Reed did not have the $81 she needed to return to South
Carolina. Hibbs called local charities, but couldn't find one open
on the weekend.
   Sgt. Drew Roberts took over when he relieved Hibbs.
   ``She was desperate and I was desperate,'' Roberts said.
   Roberts called his colleagues at the traffic division and asked
that they donate $1 each to help the woman get home. A dispatcher
sent Roberts' message to patrol officers via the police mobile
computer system.
   ``It just ballooned and within minutes there were police cars
parked up and down the road around the bus station,'' Roberts said.
``I got a lot of money real fast. Even off-duty officers in their
personal cars were coming by.''
   Roberts ended up with $138.
   ``The whole thing gave me a lump in my throat,'' Roberts said.
   Mrs. Reed cried when he gave her the money, and offered to repay
the officers, Roberts said. Before she boarded the bus, Mrs. Reed
hugged Roberts and handed him the letter thanking the officers ``for
providing me with the money to take me back home to be with the one
who needs me most.''

   A malfunctioning on-board computer delayed the
return to Earth today of a Soyuz TM-6 capsule carrying a French
cosmonaut and two Soviets who had spent a year in orbit aboard the
Mir space station.
   ``Automated telemetry showed an overload in the computing
complex,'' Soviet television said in a report from Mission Control.
   A landing scheduled for 9:50 a.m. Moscow time (1:50 a.m. EST) had
been scrubbed and scientists were sending new commands to the
computer in hopes of making a new landing attempt at 1 p.m., the
television reported.
   If the computer failed to respond, the cosmonauts could also
switch over to manual control to guide the ship back to Earth, the
report said, adding that the crew could safely spend another day in
orbit.
   There was no immediate word on the exact function of the
computer, or the nature of the overload.
   The craft was carrying cosmonauts Vladimir Titov and Musa
Manarov, who marked one year in orbit on Tuesday, and Frenchman
Jean-Loup Chretien. It separated from the Mir orbiting complex on
schedule at 6:33 a.m. (10:33 p.m. EST Tuesday).
   On Sept. 7, another Soyuz capsule's landing was delayed when a
system malfunction twice aborted the craft's re-entry.
   In that incident, the crew of the Soyuz TM-5 craft returned to
Earth later that day, but only after the life support systems on
board were in danger of running out, Soviet media reported. That
flight carried the first Afghan in to space and had similarly
separated from Mir.
   Wednesday's landing was scheduled to occur in the republic of
Kazakhstan in Soviet Central Asia.
   Titov and Manarov are holders of the space endurance record. The
U.S. mark for the longest manned mission is 84 days, set in 1973 by
astronauts Gerald Carr, Edward Gibson and William Pogue aboard the
Skylab space station.
   Soviet space officials have said in the past that their endurance
efforts are an important part of preparations for a manned flight to
Mars that they hope will take place shortly after the turn of the
century.
   Chretien rocketed into space Nov. 26 along with cosmonauts
Alexander Volkov and Sergei Krikalev, who remained aboard the space
station. Valery Polyakov, sent to the space station in the fall to
monitor the health of Titov and Manarov, also will remain behind.
   While aboard the space station, Chretien and Volkov made a space
walk to deploy an experimental framework to help plan the
construction of scientific equipment.
   They also conducted a series of medical and biologial experiments.

   An investment adviser who lived for weeks in plush
hotels in the Far East after fleeing Florida in August returned in
handcuffs to face charges of embezzling up to $20 million from his
clients, authorities said.
   Henry Gherman, 52, was scheduled to appear at a preliminary
hearing this afternoon on fraud and embezzlement charges before U.S.
Magistrate Linnea Johnson.
   Gherman was extradited Tuesday after being jailed since October
in Tokyo. He was arrested and sent to Japan by FBI agents after some
American tourists recognized him in a Taiwan hotel.
   The fugitive, who mailed written apologies to about 50 clients
before he disappeared, arrived aboard a commercial flight at Miami
International Airport Tuesday night, escorted by a dozen police
officers, FBI agents and federal marshals.
   Family members waiting for the plane said they were hoping to
talk with Gherman for the first time in four months, but he managed
to share only a strained smile with them as he was led into a car
and driven to Miami's Metropolitan Correctional Center.
   Gherman's extradition from Japan was approved earler this month
by a Tokyo court after FBI agents presented a criminal complaint
charging him with two counts of fraud and five counts of
embezzlement.
   ``I hurt for him,'' said Gherman's daughter, Shari Gherman Rance.
``I can't believe he would intentionally hurt me or anybody.''
   In his letters of apology, Gherman blamed his disappearance on
the impending collapse of one of his company, Financial and
Investment Planning Inc.
   ``I have been unable to come up with any solution other than
running,'' Gherman wrote, adding that he would try to return the
money eventually. ``I am truly sorry.''
   According to the complaint, Gherman may have been making
unauthorized transfers from his client's pension plans to his North
Miami Beach business since as early as 1978.
   Authorities said up to $20 million was embezzled from his
clients, many of whom were Miami Beach doctors.
   ``We've located $2.2 million so far,'' said Paul Miller, an FBI
spokesman, adding that an investigation by the U.S. Attorney's
office is continuing. ``They're still checking into further
records.''
   A court-appointed receiver now oversees Gherman's finances and
that of his family and companies. Gherman also faces civil action
from 12 of his former clients in addition to an expected grand jury
investigation.

   A moderate earthquake jolted Kodiak Island,
but there were no reports of damage or injury, officials said.
   The temblor, which registered about 4.3 on the Richter scale,
struck at 10:49 p.m. Tuesday and was centered about 10 miles north
of the town of Kodiak, said Alec Medbery of the Alaska Tsunami
Warning Center.
   ``It was felt very strongly in Kodiak'' but was not intense
enough to knock objects from shelves, he said.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion in which every
increase of one number means a tenfold increase in magnitude. Thus a
reading of 7.5 reflects an earthquake 10 times stronger than one of
6.5.
   An earthquake of 4 on the Richter scale can cause moderate damage
and 5 considerable damage. The quake in which 131 people died in
Alaska in 1964 measured 8.4 on the Richter scale.

   Mayor Raymond L. Flynn tried to douse a burning car
with a fire extinguisher, then directed traffic at a busy downtown
intersection when firefighters arrived to finish the job.
   Flynn and his wife, Catherine, were leaving a bookstore around
noon Tuesday after they had made a donation to The Boston Globe's
Santa Fund when he saw the burning car.
   Flynn grabbed the extinguisher from a merchant, sprayed the car
until the extinguisher was empty, then directed traffic to make room
for fire trucks.
   ``Where did he come from?'' asked Sarah Weatherwax, who sells
items from a pushcart across the street. ``He always seems to show
up at these things.''
   ``People may think I did this for publicity,'' Flynn said later.
   In 1987, Flynn rescued a handicapped person from a burning
building, and intervened in a hostage crisis in Roxbury. His wife
said she once saw him pull three people from a burning car.

   The Security Council has voted unanimously
to send 70 military observers to Angola to monitor the withdrawal of
50,000 Cuban troops as part of a plan that would also bring
independence to South-West Africa.
   The 15 members of the Security Council met Tuesday night and
approved Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar's request for the
military observers for the Cuban pullout, to be called the U.N.
Angola Verification Mission.
   The mission is estimated to cost $20.4 million during its
31-month mandate.
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz and the foreign ministers of
South Africa, Cuba and Angola are scheduled to sign accords Thursday
at the United Nations declaring the independence process for
South-West Africa will begin on April 1 after 73 years' rule by
Pretoria.
   At the same time, Cuba and Angola will sign an agreement with the
United Nations to have the military observers monitor the withdrawal
of Cuban troops over a 30-month period beginning next month.
   Cuban troops went to Angola in 1975 to help the Marxist
government fight invading South African troops and U.S.-backed
rebels of the National Union for the Total Liberation of Angola, or
UNITA.
   UNITA is not a party to the accords to be signed Thursday.
   South Africa insisted on the Cuban withdrawal from Angola in
exchange for its cooperation with a plan for granting peace to
South-West Africa, or Namibia.
   Pretoria has ruled mineral-rich Namibia since capturing it from
Germany during World War I. In 1920, the League of Nations granted
South Africa a mandate to administer Namibia; the United Nations
revoked that mandate in 1966.

<HEAD>Leaders Say Blacks Want To Be Called `African-Americans'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some national black leaders, including the Rev.
Jesse Jackson, say it's time the term ``black'' was replaced by
``African-American.''
   ``Just as we were called colored, but were not that, and then
Negro, but not that, to be called black is just as baseless,''
Jackson said after Monday's meeting of the black leaders.
   The leaders met to discuss national goals and objectives and said
they would meet in March to try to set a national black agenda,
Jackson said.
   ``To be called African-Americans has cultural integrity,'' he
said. ``It puts us in our proper historical context. Every ethnic
group in this country has a reference to some land base, some
historical cultural base. African-Americans have hit that level of
cultural maturity.''
   ``There are Armenian-Americans and Jewish-Americans and
Arab-Americans and Italian-Americans,'' Jackson said. ``And with a
degree of accepted and reasonable pride, they connect their heritage
to their mother country and where they are now.''
   Many of the leaders at the meeting, including representatives of
the National Black Republicans Council, the National Black County
Officials and the National Association for the Advancement of
Colored People, said the term African-Americans would be a
psychological lift.
   But some said the change was merely verbal.
   ``We must have really reached a zenith in the civil rights
struggle that we have to now busy ourselves with semantics,'' said
the Rev. B. Herbert Martin, head of Chicago's Human Relations
Commission.
   Among the other leader at the meeting were: Richard Hatcher, the
former mayor of Gary, Ind.; National Urban Coalition President
Ramona Edelin, and Gloria Toote, former assistant secretary of the
U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.

<HEAD>Japan, Soviet Union Agree To Resume Talks On WWII Peace Treaty</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELAINE KURTENBACH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan and the Soviet Union today agreed to resume
talks on a peace treaty formally ending World War II, despite their
failure to overcome a territorial dispute that has chilled relations
for decades.
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze said the two sides
had also agreed to prepare for a summit.
   During the last summit meeting in October 1973, peace treaty
negotiations stalled on a 43-year-old dispute over a group of
Soviet-held islands that Tokyo wants returned to Japan.
   Tokyo and Moscow have rival claims to the Kuril islands off
northern Japan, from which 17,000 Japanese residents were ousted by
the Soviets at the end of World War II. Japan asserts a long
historical right to the islands, which now are fortified by 10,000
Soviet troops.
   Shevardnadze gave an upbeat assessment of his two days of
meetings with his Japanese counterpart Sousuke Uno before flying on
to Manila today, becoming the highest-ranking Soviet official to
visit the Philippines since the two countries established diplomatic
relations in 1976.
   ``We have attained a degree of mutual understanding that allows
us to speak of a new chapter in Japan-Soviet relations,'' said
Shevardnadze, speaking Russian that was translated into English.
   ``An important step forward ... has been made that opens up good
prospects for Soviet-Japanese political dialogue and for a practical
development of our relations,'' the Soviet envoy said.
   Later, however, Uno told a news conference ``there can be no
peace treaty without a resolution of the territorial issue.''
   After Shevardnadze's departure, the two nations released a
nine-page joint communique that made no direct reference to the
territorial dispute but vaguely mentions ``difficulties existing in
their bilateral relations.''
   Citing the agreement on further meetings leading to a possible
summit between Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and Prime
Minister Noboru Takeshita, Shevardnadze said the talks had won ``a
victory for reason, for balance of interests, and for a realistic
policy.''
   He said he would meet Uno in Paris next month while attending a
conference on chemical weapons, and that Uno would visit Moscow in
the spring.
   Japan has repeatedly invited Gorbachev to visit this country, but
no date emerged from Shevardnadze's visit.
   Asked about the territorial issue, Shevardnadze said the two
sides had ``agreed to consider the historical and political aspects
related to removal of difficulties pending in bilateral relations.''
   He did not directly mention the islands, but did say the Soviets
had agreed on humanitarian grounds to consider ``increasing in 1989
the number of locations where Japanese can visit burial grounds of
their relatives on Soviet territory.''
   Shevardnadze also said no concrete agreements had been reached on
economic matters, ``but we hope to promote economic cooperation.''
   He said the tentative agenda for a Japan-Soviet summit would
include agreements on protecting investments, principles of economic
cooperation and establishment of banking offices, as well as treaty
issues and other matters.
   In 1987, two-way trade between Tokyo and Moscow totaled $4.9
billion and accounted for just 1.8 percent of Japan's total trade.
It is expected to climb slightly to $4.98 billion this year.
   Shevardnadze, who will visit North Korea after the Philippines,
said Moscow had established trade and other unofficial relations
with South Korea but would not establish governmental relations with
Seoul, an action that would further isolate its ally North Korea.

<HEAD>Energy Department to Negotiate Legally Binding Agreement</HEAD>

<DATELINE>COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.S. Department of Energy decision to
negotiate a legally binding agreement with Ohio to clean up a
federal uranium refinery does not obligate the agency to do the same
elsewhere, a spokesman said.
   The Energy Department decided Tuesday to accept a consent decree
that would enforce a $50 million federal agreement made Nov. 22 to
clean up the Portsmouth Gaseous Diffusion Plant in Piketon, said
spokesman Doug Elmets in Washington.
   A day earlier, news reports indicating the Energy Department was
backing away from a consent decree prompted state Attorney General
Anthony Celebrezze to insist that Ohio had a commitment that federal
officials should honor.
   Elmets said the department reached its decision after discussions
with Ohio officials and consultations with the Justice Department
and the Energy Department's operations office in Oak Ridge, Tenn.
   ``This decision was based on the same factors that influenced our
decision on two earlier consent decrees in regard to Fernald
litigation,'' Elmets read from a statement.
   He was referring to the announcement earlier this month of a
court-approved agreement that gave Ohio authority to regulate the
Energy Department's $1 billion cleanup of the Feed Materials
Production Center, a weapons-grade uranium processing plant in
Fernald, 20 miles northwest of Cincinnati.
   At that plant, company documents released Tuesday revealed that
the former operator of Fernald mistakenly donated a ``slightly
contaminated'' dump truck to a local school board in 1950.
   When officials at National Lead of Ohio realized the mistake,
they decided not to alert the school board because they didn't think
the contamination level posed a health threat, the documents
indicate. The whereabouts of the truck today is unknown.
   The documents were released to the U.S. House Subcommittee on
Transportation, Tourism and Hazardous Materials, which is
investigating radioactive pollution at such plants for more than
three decades.
   Elmets said the Energy Department's latest decision on the
Piketon cleanup does not mean the government will pursue similar
agreements with other states that claim federal nuclear
installations have polluted the environment.
   ``The only precedential value to this decision is that we will
continue to analyze lawsuits of this kind on a case-by-case basis,
and if any state makes a similarly attractive and fair settlement,
we will give it the same serious consideration. Otherwise we will
litigate,'' Elmets said.
   Ohio officials said they were satisified with the department's
decision.
   ``I'm happy we're back at the negotiating table and are not going
to waste our efforts on legal maneuvering,'' Celebrezze said, adding
that he would settle only for a consent decree because ``I want
something that's enforceable in court. I'll settle for nothing
less.''
   The Piketon plant processes uranium for fuel for commercial
nuclear power reactors. It generates toxic wastes such as
polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs, solvents and metals, as well as
radioactive materials.

<HEAD>Three Cabinet Ministers Resign Over French-Language Row</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SOLL SUSSMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three Quebec Cabinet ministers have resigned over
their premier's defiance of a Supreme Court ruling that the
predominantly French-speaking province allow the posting of signs in
English.
   The country's highest court said last week that Quebec may make
sure that French predominates on outdoor signs but barred the
province from preventing the use of other languages.
   Robert Bourassa, the provincial premier, angered both English
speakers and francophone militants on Sunday with what he termed a
compromise: French must remain the only language on outdoor signs
but other languages can be used indoors so long as French
predominates.
   Environment Minister Clifford Lincoln, one of four English
speakers in Bourassa's Cabinet, resigned Tuesday and said he
considered the so-called compromise a violation of individual rights.
   ``In my beliefs, rights are rights are rights. There are no
partial rights. There are no indoor-outdoor rights,'' he said.
   Two of the other English speakers _ Public Security Minister
Herbert Marx and Communications Minister Richard French _ quit later
Tuesday.
   Bourassa based his decision on a clause put into the constitution
by Western provinces as a protection against federal power that
allows provinces or the national government to override a court
decision.
   The resumption of linguistic divisiveness in Canada followed four
years of general calm that made possible the 1987 Meech Lake
constitutional agreement recognizing Quebec as a ``distinct
society.''
   Only eight of the 10 provinces have ratified the accord, named
for the place in Quebec where it was signed. New Brunswick and
Quebec have not.
   Premier Gary Filmon of Manitoba described the Quebec decision as
a ``national tragedy'' and called for a national conference of
provincial leaders to persuade the French-speaking province to
accept the court decision.
   Which language can be used on signs is a volatile and symbolic
issue Quebec's French speakers _ 81 percent of the population _
consider essential to preserving their linguistic and cultural
heritage.
   Bourassa's plan prohibits languages other than French on signs
both outdoors and in such places as shopping malls and interiors of
public transportation facilities.
   A crowd of 10,000 attended a rally Sunday in Montreal demanding
no changes in the language law, which was passed in 1977 by the
separatist Parti Quebecois government.
   Power in the province shifted from the English-speaking minority
to the French speakers in the 1970s. Separatist sentiment abated
after the language law was passed and Quebec's voters rejected
sovereignty in a 1980 referendum.

<HEAD>Report: Farmers Home Administration Has $36 Billion in Losses</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal audit found that the Farmers Home
Administration, which makes loans to struggling farmers, has
accumulated losses of at least $36 billion, a newspaper reported
today.
   The General Accounting Office said the agency would be ``unable
to meet its outstanding debt obligations without additional
borrowings or congressional appropriations,'' according to The New
York Times.
   ``People just don't realize how much money we are lending to
farmers in this country,'' said Frederick D. Wolf, director of the
GAO's Accounting and Financial Management Division. ``Congress is
clearly going to have to deal with this problem next year.''
   The agency was created more than 40 years ago to provide
low-interest loans for farmers who have difficulty finding credit in
the private sector.
   The GAO audit, the first in the agency's history, found that the
agency had total liabilities of about $91 billion, but the value of
its outstanding loans was only about $55 billion, leaving a
shortfall of $36 billion.
   The audit was for the fiscal year ended Sept. 30, 1987.
   ``We've seen nothing in the past year that would reverse the loss
trend,'' Wolf said.
   Some of the loans are backed by land, but others made to help
farmers buy seed and equipment are not, making recovery of those
loans nearly impossible.
   Farmers who can't qualify for a bank loan or a loan from the
Federal Farm Credit System can come to the Farmers Home
Administration as a last resort.
   ``By definition the borrowers are the least credit-worthy, and
you better expect some losses,'' Wolf said.
   Farm loans under the program went from $60 billion in 1982 to
almost $90 billion in 1987, due to the depression in the agriculture
economy. In 1987, losses grew by $22 billion.
   Last year, Congress approved a $4 billion bailout for the other
major farm-lending agency, the Farm Credit System. The government is
under pressure to bail out insolvent savings and loan associations
at a cost of about $50 billion.

   A teen-ager says he will drop the assault and
battery charges he filed against Rep. Joseph Kennedy II after the
congressman allegedly shoved him after a near traffic accident.
   Victor H. Avila, 17, said Kennedy, D-Mass., grabbed his sweater
and pushed him against his car following the incident Tuesday. Avila
said he was unhurt.
   ``I did not hit him but I made myself very clear,'' Kennedy, 36,
told WBZ-TV on Tuesday night, adding that Avila was speeding. ``The
fact is that people drive too fast in these city neighborhoods.''
   Avila said he would go to Brighton District Court today to drop
the charges because Kennedy had come to his home Tuesday evening to
apologize.
   Jim Mahoney, a spokesman for Kennedy, said Kennedy had not
apologized but had met with Avila and his father ``just to clarify
things.''
   Mahoney said Avila's car forced the congressman off the road.
   ``Joe gave a very stern reprimand to the young man driving the
other vehicle and then later in the day, the young man and his
father came over to Joe's house about 4 or 5 p.m. where they
discussed the whole incident,'' Mahoney said.
   According to the complaint Avila filed with Boston police on
Tuesday, Avila was driving up a hill and passed Kennedy's car, which
was traveling in the opposite direction, a police spokesman said.
Avila and Kennedy each veered off the road to avoid a collision, the
complaint said.
   ``We had a little misunderstanding, a little feud, and tempers
were really mad, both of us,'' Avila said. ``It's all over.''

<TEXT>
   The start of former Rep. Mario Biaggi's
eight-year prison term was delayed by an appellate court pending his
appeal of his Wedtech racketeering conviction.
   ``We're very happy,'' said James LaRossa, Biaggi's attorney,
after Tuesday's decision by the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Biaggi, who will remain free on bail, did not attend the hearing.
   A three-judge panel ruled unanimously in favor of Biaggi, who had
been scheduled to start his sentence on Jan. 9. The 10-term
Democratic congressman was forced to resign from the House of
Representatives on Aug. 5 following his conviction.
   ``There are substantial questions which affect (Biaggi) alone,''
said Judge Wilfred Feinberg, the chief judge of the 2nd Circuit,
after the panel heard arguments and briefly recessed.
   Biaggi was convicted with ex-Bronx Borough President Stanley
Simon, Wedtech Corp. founder John Mariotta and two other people of
turning the South Bronx military contractor into a racketeering
enterprise for their personal gain. Simon and Mariotta still face a
Jan. 9 surrender date.
   Convicted of lesser charges stemming from the scandal was
Biaggi's son Richard, 39, who received a two-year prison term
despite a tearful plea from his father asking the trial judge for
mercy.
   The elder Biaggi, who represented the Bronx, was convicted of 15
counts of racketeering, conspiracy, extortion and receiving bribes
for squeezing $1.8 million in stocks and cash from Wedtech.
   LaRossa said the main issue in the appeal concerns U.S. District
Judge Constance Baker Motley's refusal to allow certain testimony by
Richard Biaggi's wife, Toni, about a conversation in which she and
Richard agreed to give the elder Biaggi a percentage of Wedtech
stock.
   According to LaRossa, Toni Biaggi had quoted her father-in-law as
saying he would only take the stock if it was deemed to be within
congressional ethical guidelines.
   The eight-year term for Biaggi is to run concurrently with the
2{-year sentence imposed following his November 1987 conviction for
taking an illegal gratuity and obstruction of justice in a case
involving ex-Brooklyn Democratic boss Meade Esposito.

<HEAD>Cranberry Fined $400,000 in Waste Dumping Plea Bargain</HEAD>

   Ocean Spray Cranberries Inc. has agreed to buy new
wastewater treatment equipment for its host community and pay a
$400,000 fine as part of a plea bargain for polluting a local sewer
system emptying into a river.
   Federal officials said Tuesday the case was one of the first in
which a municipality damaged by pollution has been considered the
victim of a crime and granted a monetary settlement.
   Ocean Spray President John S. Llewellyn Jr. said the settlement
was ``tough and costly, but fair and a warning to all conscientious
corporations of the need to comply with environmental regulations.''
   The company pleaded guilty to 21 misdemeanor charges and was
fined $400,000 for releasing highly acidic waste into municipal
sewers near its fruit-processing plant in Middleboro.
   Under a plea agreement with the U.S. attorney's office in which
more than 50 charges were dropped, the Plymouth-based cooperative
also promised to buy the town wastewater treatment equipment worth
more than $100,000.
   Ocean Spray had pleaded innocent in February to six felony
charges and 72 misdemeanor charges that it released cranberry
peelings and acids into municipal sewers and the Nemasket River from
1983 to 1987 despite fines and reprimands from the town.
   Ocean Spray had faced up to $2.1 million in fines from all the
charges.
   ``The United States was very keen on insuring the town received a
restitution payment, and a plea agreement was one way to insure that
the town recover as a result of the pollution inflicted on it,''
said Assistant U.S. Attorney Richard E. Welch III.
   The grower-owned cooperative earlier this month decided to switch
its plea to guilty in an agreement under which the felony charges
were dropped. It was the first time the federal government had
charged a company with a felony under the Clean Water Act.
   The act was amended in 1987 to make it a felony to knowingly
discharge raw refuse into sewers. The felony violations charged
against Ocean Spray all occurred after the act was amended.
   Ocean Spray said in a statement that the company had spent $3.2
million to meet environmental requirements, including upgrading its
industrial waste pretreatment facility and adopting measures to keep
cranberries out of storm water runoff.
   Ocean Spray, a $781 million company, employs 400 people full time
and up to 575 people part time in Middleboro, a town of 20,000
people south of Boston.

<HEAD>New Regulations Will Allow Poles To Keep Passports</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Under new government regulations, Poles
returning from abroad will no longer have to return their passports
to police and re-apply when they wish to travel again.
   Also, the government will end its current practice of issuing one
passport for travel to East bloc countries and one for travel
elsewhere, government spokesman Jerzy Urban said in announcing the
regulations Tuesday.
   The passport will be valid two to 10 years, its holder entitled
to an unlimited number of trips abroad, Urban said at his weekly
news conference.
   Under current regulations, a Pole must apply to local police
authorities for a passport for each trip abroad and surrender the
document after returning to Poland. Now, Poles can keep their
passports at home.
   The new regulations are scheduled to take effect Jan. 1.
   Poles often use a trip abroad to earn hard currency so they may
live more comfortably upon their return. The country's centralized
economy is in crisis and most Poles who must live on wages earned in
the national currency find themselves struggling to get by.
   During the summer months, long lines of visa applicants form
before the consulates of Western countries.

<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Edward Kennedy, Texas Treasurer Ann Richards
and other elected officials joined gay rights activists in attacking
a state judge who said he gave a killer lighter punishment because
his victims were homosexuals.
   ``The recent actions of the state judge in Dallas County violate
the fundamental principal that everyone stands equal before the law.
The suggestion that those who kill homosexuals deserve shorter
sentences is bigotry at its worst,'' said a statement from Kennedy,
D-Mass., read at a Tuesday night rally.
   About 500 protesters, many chanting ``No more Hampton'' and
others carrying signs that said ``Bigot Resign,'' gathered at City
Hall to demand the resignation of District Judge Jack Hampton.
   ``Dallas bears the shame for every day that he sits there, and
the world is watching,'' William Waybourn, president of the Dallas
Gay Alliance, told the protesters. ``Dallas cannot afford the image
of hate for as long as he sits on the bench.
   Hampton told the Dallas Times Herald in an interview published
last week that he sentenced Richard Lee Bednarski, 18, to 30 years
in prison instead of a maximum life sentence on Nov. 28 because, in
part, the two men Bednarski was convicted of killing were
homosexuals.
   ``These two guys that got killed wouldn't have been killed if
they hadn't been cruising the streets picking up teen-age boys,''
Judge Hampton said. ``I don't much care for queers cruising the
streets picking up teen-age boys. I've got a teen-age boy.''
   Richards, who gave the keynote address at the Democratic National
Convention in Atlanta last summer and is considered a likely
gubernatorial candidate in 1990, also issued a statement that was
read at the rally.
   ``The constitution guarantees that when we come before our courts
seeking justice, our lives will not be given less or more value than
the lives of others,'' it said.
   A statement from U.S. Rep. John Bryant, D-Texas, said: ``This
manifestation of hatred in the midst of the Christmas season cannot
be met with silence. It must be met with outrage.''
   Hampton's remarks have mobilized the Dallas gay community more
than anything in years, Waybourn said before the rally.
   ``The change is we're not sitting on our hands. We're fighting
back,'' he said. ``It's the first time we've taken the initiative in
this manner in getting rid of a bigot.''
   The Texas Human Rights Foundation and the Dallas Gay Alliance
have filed complaints with the State Commission on Judicial Conduct
seeking Hampton's removal from the bench.
   Robert Flowers, executive director of the judicial conduct
commission, said there will be a general inquiry into the complaints
and that the commission probably will hear a preliminary report on
them at its Jan. 13 meeting.
   The commission can dismiss the complaints or impose sanctions
against the judge. It also could begin the procedure by which a
judge is removed.
   One Texas group, however, the Christian Voting Bloc, has
supported Hampton.
   ``We'd work to keep him in office,'' said Joe Seay, chairman of
the Odessa-based organization. ``We need more like him.''

   The dollar was little changed in light European
trading early today. Gold prices were mixed.
   Dealers said they expected sustained corporate demand to support
the dollar through the end of the year, but they said fears of
central bank intervention could impede the dollar's advance.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar fell 0.48 Japanese yen to a closing 124.22 yen. Later, in
London, it edged back up to 124.60 yen.
   Other dollar rates at mid-morning, compared with late Tuesday:
   _1.7750 West German marks, unchanged
   _1.4990 Swiss francs, down from 1.4995

   In London, the British pound fell to $1.8035 from $1.8070 late
Tuesday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $414.40 a troy ounce, up
from $414.25 bid late Tuesday. At midmorning today, the city's five
major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $413.85.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $414, up from $413.50 bid late
Tuesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose 27 cents to close at a bid
$415.94.
   Silver bullion rose in London to a bid price of $6.13 a troy

on Drugs</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Congressmen just returned from Central American
and Caribbean countries said today the incoming Bush administration
should move quickly to take advantage of a ``new spirit of
cooperation'' in the region to fight drug trafficking.
   Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., chairman of the House Select
Committee on Narcotics, said a 12-day trip to 10 nations was
highlighted by a ``breakthrough'' in Cuba, where President Fidel
Castro offered to work in the effort. The 10-member congressional
delegation returned Tuesday.
   Rangel, interviewed on NBC-TV's ``Today'', said that political
leaders in the region now see drug trafficking ``as a threat to
their national security, and they're asking their friends in the
United States to become partners in fighting against this drug
epidemic.
   ``There is an entirely different attitude we've seen in the
leadership of these countries,'' he said.
   Rangel said Castro promised to provide the United States with
intelligence on potential drug planes flying over Cuba, even if the
aircraft do not land on that island country.
   Rep. Benjamin Gilman, R-N.Y., also interviewed by NBC, said the
next step would be a summit meeting of regional leaders, which was
called for in a massive anti-drug bill Congress passed earlier this
year.
   ``We found there is a willingness and a desire to work
cooperatively,'' Gilman said.
   Rangel said congressmen would meet with members of the new Bush
administration to help coordinate an anti-drug policy.
   ``We're meeting, Republicans and Democrats, asking for a meeting
with President Bush, the attorney general, and the members of the
Cabinet, to take advantage of this new spirit of cooperation,'' he
said.
   In addition to Cuba, the congressional delegation visited Mexico,
Belize, Jamaica, the Dominican Republican, Guyana, Trinidad and
Tobago, meeting with heads of state at every stop.
   ``If there is a common thread running through what we have
learned at our various stops, it is that there is a growing concern
on the part of the various governments to come up with effective
measures to fight the drug problem,'' said Rangel, chairman of the
House Select Committee on Narcotics Abuse and Control.
   The 1988 anti-drug abuse legislation urges the assistant
secretary of state for international narcotics matters to seek
establishment of a regional anti-narcotics center in the Caribbean.
   ``Such a center would go a long way in helping to more
effectively combat narcotics trafficking and drug abuse in the
region,'' said Gilman.
   Rangel said the countries visited were willing to attend a
hemispheric summit on drug trafficking and narcotics abuse, but
there was no indication when such a summit might take place.
   The delegation also made these points:
   _Mexico's newly installed President Carlos Salinas de Gortari
promised to ``make life miserable for the drug traffickers,'' Rangel
said.
   _Officials in Belize revealed that crack cocaine had been
introduced into the country.
   _Trinidad and Tobago authorities said they wanted to launch a
national anti-drug initiative, while officials in Guyana and the
Dominican Republic pointed out that those countries recently passed
anti-drug legislation.
   Rangel and Rep. Guy Vander Jagt, R-Mich., said they hoped the
delegation could discuss their findings with President-elect Bush,
but there was no scheduled meeting yet.
   In addition to Rangel, Gilman and Vander Jagt, the other members
of the delegation were Reps. Frank J. Guarini, D-N.J., William J.
Hughes, D-N.J., Solomon P. Ortiz, D-Texas; George W. Crockett Jr.,
D-Mich.; Kweisi Mfume, D-Md.; and Delegates Walter E. Fauntroy,
D-District of Columbia, and Ron de Lugo, D-Virgin Islands.

   A bank robber who said ``please'' may be
the same one who said ``thank you'' in pulling off an earlier heist,
police say.
   A holdup Monday at a Great Western Savings Bank branch resembled
robberies Nov. 16 at a bank in Shadle Center and Nov. 30 at another
Great Western branch, Lt. John Goldman said.
   In each case, the robber entered shortly before closing time and
did not display a weapon, although he indicated he had one, Goldman
said.
   Police did not disclose the amount of money taken.
   On Monday, a hooded robber told a teller to ``please'' put all of
her money onto the counter, Goldman said. In one of the earlier
holdups, he said, the robber thanked the teller after getting the
cash.

<HEAD>Losing Candidate Claims Government Fraud In Presidential Election</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PATRICK CRUEZ</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The main opposition candidate for
president said today she lost the election because of widespread
fraud by the governing party.
   The candidate, former Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike, vowed
to challenge the results of Monday's contest.
   ``The election results are something I cannot accept,'' she told
reporters at her Colombo home. ``There was a number of violations of
election law.''
   Mrs. Bandaranaike lost to Prime Minister Ranasinghe Premadasa by
50.9 percent to 44.9 percent, according to election results
announced by the government. A third candidate finished well back.
   Mrs. Bandaranaike said her lawyers told her there was enough
evidence to have the election result voided and said that her party
would take the case to the Supreme Court.
   She accused her opponents of taking ballot boxes to police
stations instead of official counting centers and stuffing them with
ballots.
   During the news conference, she waved about 700 blank ballots she
claimed were found outside a police station.
   Ranjan Wijeratne, chairman of the governing United National
Party, dismissed the charges. ``The people have given a verdict.
Everybody must bow down to the collective decision of the people,''
he said.
   A 10-member election observer group from countries in the region
issued a report today saying ``the electoral process, even though it
may have been flawed ... did in fact take its course, should be
viewed positively.''
   Mrs. Bandaranaike said the Central Committee of her Sri Lanka
Freedom Party would decide whether to call for demonstrations
against the election result.
   Activity in the capital of Colombo appeared returning to normal
today after tension caused by ethnic extremists who waged a campaign
of intimidation to disrupt the election.
   Commuter train service and other forms of public transportation
that ran sporadically the past month were normal in the morning.
   The violence that has plagued this strife-torn Indian Ocean
island had not stopped, however.
   Tamil Tigers, an ethnic insurgency seeking independence for
minority Tamils, blew up a truck this morning with remote-controlled
explosives, killing four special task force policemen in Pullumalai,
20 miles southwest of the eastern port of Batticoloa, the military
said.
   The current cycle of violence in Sri Lanka, formerly a popular
tourist resort, dates from 1983, when Tamils began an uprising
against the majority Sinhalese. Nearly 10,000 people have been
killed on this island of 16 million people.
   Under a 1987 pact with New Delhi, 47,000 Indian troops are
deployed in northeastern Sri Lanka to suppress the rebellion. In
return, the government has granted the Tamils some autonomy.
   The Sinhalese extremist People's Liberation Front that vehemently
opposes the government, in part because of the pact, killed about
650 people during the campaign, officials claim.
   Premadasa, in a nationally televised address immediately after
being declared the winner, urged ethnic subersives to stop fighting
and join the political process.
   ``I have an appeal to make to those who have still to join the
democratic process,'' he said. ``Your participation will enable us
to eradicate fear and poverty with greater speed.''
   He said they had a chance to participate in Feb. 15 parliamentary
elections called by outgoing President Junius R. Jayewardene.

<HEAD>Audit Says Navy Overpaid Phoenix Missile Contract</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Defense Department audit says the Navy may
have paid as much as $27.2 million more than necessary during
1985-86 to its prime contractors for the Phoenix air-to-air missiles.
   The audit also warns that the Navy is set to award a contract to
a second manufacturer without prior testing of its version of the
missile. It also says the service could save about $35.4 million in
the next three years if it directly purchased 10 of the missile
components it now buys through subcontractors.
   The Aug. 22 audit, performed by the Defense Department's
independent inspector general and bearing the low-level security
classification ``For Official Use Only,'' was disclosed Tuesday by
the Project on Military Procurement, a defense watchdog group based
in Washington.
   The document focuses on contracts worth $684 million awarded
between March 1985 and July 1987 for Phoenix missiles, the Navy's
premiere missile for aerial dog-fighting.
   The latest model of the long-range, supersonic missile is known
as the AIM-54C and is carried by the Navy's F-14 Tomcat jet fighters.
   The Hughes Aircraft Co. developed the missile and is the prime
contractor, but in 1984 the Navy decided to bring on a second
producer and competitor for Hughes. The Raytheon Co., the second
contractor is now fighting for annual production work.
   According to the audit, the Navy overpaid Hughes between $18.1
million and $27.2 million in fiscal 1985 and fiscal 1986 by allowing
the company's production line workers to take more than triple the
amount of time Hughes' own internal labor efficiency standards would
have allowed to fabricate each missile.
   Even if industry averages were used for labor efficiency instead
of internal Hughes standards, Hughes was given about twice as much
time to build each missile as would normally be the case, suggesting
much inefficiency, the audit says.
   Because the audit focuses on the Navy's handling of the contract
rather than the company's performance, Hughes spokeswoman Fran
Slimmer said the company would had no comment.
   Hughes, a division of General Motors Corp., designed the Phoenix
at its missile systems group headquarters in the Los Angeles suburb
of Canoga Park and builds it in Tucson, Ariz.
   Before awarding any more contracts, the document suggests that
the Navy examine Hughes' assembly line labor efficiency. But the
Navy refused in a written response, saying such an analysis wasn't
needed because future contracts would be based on competitive
bidding.
   The auditors countered that the Navy really wasn't in the proper
position to begin significant competitive bidding between Hughes and
Raytheon, because it hasn't conducted ``verification testing of
Raytheon's missile (to) demonstrate its operational suitability.''

<TEXT>
   A jobs-center director who claimed that he was
a priest and generated public sympathy after he offered to sell
valuable lithographs to pay the center's bills admits he faked some
of his credentials.
   The man, John DaeCheck, also acknowledged he has had some brushes
with authorities, including an investigation of his publishing
company by the U.S. Postal Service and the state attorney general.
   But DaeCheck, 42, who also claimed to have led a congregation,
said he remains committed to helping the unemployed through his
non-profit New Times Service Center in suburban Glassport.
   Neal Holmes, owner of Allied Security of Pittsburgh, said Monday
he dropped plans to organize business people interested in giving at
least $10,000 to the center because of questions about DaeCheck's
credentials.
   In addition, Jack Katona, manager of Union National Bank in
Glassport, said Tuesday he would close the account DaeCheck opened
Monday with $500 he received from the sale of a lithograph.
   Katona initially agreed to DaeCheck's request that the bank
manager oversee all transactions in the account, but decided to
sever any connections with DaeCheck.
   DaeCheck generated sympathy when he placed a classified ad to
sell two 19th-century lithographs, saying he needed the money to pay
an overdue phone bill at the center. Dozens of people offered to buy
the lithographs or contribute to the center.
   DaeCheck had told The Associated Press he was the pastor of an
independent Russian Orthodox Church called St. Paul's in Washington,
Pa., and said the job center was a mission of the church.
   But when pressed for details Monday, DaeCheck said he doesn't
have a congregation or conduct services. He further explained that
St. Paul's Church is actually St. Paul's Mission, part of All-Faith
Church Mission Inc. in Washington, founded by the Revs. Harry and
Helen Harrington.
   The Harringtons said they ordained DaeCheck and hundreds of other
people based on the applicants' knowledge of the Bible and their
belief in God.
   The couple said their non-denominational church is licensed by a
Bible college, but neither could remember which college.
   DaeCheck said he briefly attended but did not graduate from
Savanarolo Theological Seminary in Scranton. He said he was ordained
in Washington, D.C., in 1981 by Bishop James Miller of the Orthodox
Church of America. That church was based in Anderson, S.C., and is
separate from the more commonly known Orthodox Church in America,
DaeCheck said.
   But the rector of the Scranton seminary, the Very Rev. Edward
Brzostowski, said Monday he had no records of DaeCheck's attendance.
   Directory assistance in Anderson, S.C., had no listing for the
church or Miller.
   Caren Mariani, a deputy state attorney general, said DaeCheck's
publishing company failed to publish manuscripts, make refunds on
time or register itself as a business with the state.
   In June 1985, DaeCheck agreed to reimburse seven authors a total
of $5,354, to be paid over a 20-month period. The agreement does not
constitute an admission of guilt, Mariani said. Records indicate
DaeCheck has not completed the payments.
   The postal service investigated DaeCheck but never charged him
with any crime, said Postal Inspector Bruce Stutzman.

   President-elect Bush's transition aides are
soliciting advice from professional ``headhunters'' in determining
how best to recruit people for hundreds of high-ranking jobs.
   Transition personnel director Chase Untermeyer said Tuesday that
employees of leading executive search firms have advised Bush aides
on things such as ``finding sources, finding references and
interviewing.''
   Untermeyer's office is charged with sifting through thousands of
resumes that have been submitted for jobs in the new administration.
He said it is easy to learn the recruiting techniques used by
private industry recruiters, who are commonly called ``headhunters.''
   But while government and industry both aim to fill jobs with the
most qualified people, he said, Bush's nominees also ``must have a
feel for te politics of the situation, ... what the president's
programs are, what the mandate of the election was.''
   The No. 1 priority so far has been choosing Cabinet members who
will have a say in filling the sub-Cabinet jobs, Untermeyer said.
Several Cabinet vacancies remain including the secretaries of Health
and Human Services, Transportation, Energy, Interior and Labor.
   Key sub-Cabinet jobs number several hundred. They include the
assistant secretaries and undersecretaries at the agencies,
commission members, ambassadorships and judgeships.
   The new administration will have about 4,300 full-time patronage
jobs out of a federal bureaucracy of about 3 million, Untermeyer
said.
   In selecting nominees to high positions that require Senate
confirmation, Untermeyer said he and his six assistants pore over
resumes and perform preliminary background checks before selecting a
``good grouping'' of about three people for each job.
   Those people will be interviewed by John Sununu, the designated
White House chief of staff.
   ``When he is satisfied that we have a good package, off it will
go to what will be a regular meeting with the president,''
Untermeyer said. Bush, who will be inaugurated on Jan. 20, will make
the selections, he said.
   Those selected will be subject to various congressional and FBI
examinations and will have to provide financial information before
the president submits the nominations to the Senate. An appointment
is final only after Senate confirmation.
   Untermeyer made his comments at a briefing on the transition
sponsored by the National Press Foundation.
   John Trattner of the non-profit Center for Excellence in
Government approved of using management techniques similar to those
employed by business in recruiting.
   He said that by using such methods, the Bush administration
should cut down on inappropriate hirings based solely on friendships
and other non-professional criteria.

   Authorities say animal rights groups claimed
responsibility for firebomb attacks on some of Britain's leading
department stores.
   The attacks late Monday and early Tuesday gutted Dingles, the
largest department store in Plymouth, England; started fires at
Selfridges and Harrods in London and at Howell's in Cardiff, Wales;
and forced evacuation of Rackhams in Birmingham, England, police
said.
   Bombs found at Rackhams and at the House of Fraser in London, a
department store on Oxford Street, were defused.
   There were no injuries. The fires, in the busy final days of the
Christmas shopping season, occurred when the stores were closed. But
authorities said the Dingles fire caused millions of dollars in
damage.
   Police in Manchester said a newspaper there received a telephone
call Tuesday from the Animal Liberation Front claiming
responsibility for the bombings. The caller was quoted as saying,
``These incidents are part of our ongoing war against the fur
trade.''
   ``The caller claimed his group had carried out the wave of
bombings which wrecked a House of Fraser store (Dingles) in Plymouth
and caused minor damage at Harrods and Selfridges in London,'' said
a spokesman for the paper, commenting on condition he was not
identified.
   ``Among the bombs he warned about was one at Rackhams store in
Birmingham, where a suspect package was found this afternoon, many
hours after the call.''
   Press Association, the domestic news agency, received a
telephoned claim of responsibility for the Plymouth fire from the
Angry Brigade, a radical militant group active in the 1970s. It said
the anonymous caller called the fire ``an attack against big
business.''
   Meanwhile, a package containing an incendiary device was found
Tuesday night at the offices of a fur trade publication in London,
police said.
   Police also said they think animal rights extremists may have
sent a package containing an incendiary device to Professor Ian
Glynn, head of Cambridge University's physiological laboratories.
   Glynn became suspicious and called police when the package
arrived at his home on Monday. He said his work does not involve the
use of live animals, a principal complaint of animal rights
protesters.
   All the stores involved in this week's firebomb attacks, except
Selfridges, belong to House of Fraser, a retail group owned by the
Al-Fayed brothers of Egypt.
   Incendiary devices stuffed behind sofa cushions ignited shortly
after midnight in Selfridges and Harrods, but damaged only the
sofas, store officials said. Fire damage at Howell's also was
reported minor.
   Officers said the firebombs had no clear link with letter bombs
sent to prominent people with police connections.
   A letter bomb addressed to the West Midlands chief constable
burst into flames in a postal sorting office in Coventry, police
said. A local councilor and a member of a police oversight committee
called police after becoming suspicious of padded envelopes sent to
them, they added.

   President Corazon Aquino today
declared a unilateral cease-fire with communist rebels for Christmas
and New Year's and called for a peaceful solution to the nearly
20-year-old insurgency.
   Mrs. Aquino said in a statement that government forces will
suspend offensive military operations from midnight Friday until
midnight Sunday, Christmas Day, and again from midnight Dec. 30
until midnight Jan. 1.
   ``All military and police forces shall maintain a state of
readiness for security action and hot pursuit in the event of any
attack or breach of the peace by any hostile group,'' she said.
   ``Let this gesture be seen for what it is _ an earnest (sign) of
our sincere desire for peace throughout our land not only in this
gentle season but throughout the year that is coming, and hopefully
for all times.''
   Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos said the decision had been endorsed
by Chief of Staff Gen. Renato de Villa and the Department of
National Defense.
   Mrs. Aquino also said the government ``remains committed to the
search for a peaceful resolution of the insurgency problem'' despite
the breakdown of peace talks with the rebels last year.
   ``We remain convinced that, in the reformation of society, and
the improvement of the economy, there is a congruence of objectives
between the government and those rebels who are sincere about
helping our people,'' she said.
   She blamed ``terrorist elements in the insurgency'' for the
continued fighting but added that her government ``remained
committed to the eventual reconciliation of all Filipinos and the
attainment of permanent peace throughout our country.''
   There was no immediate response from the 24,000-strong New
People's Army, the armed wing of the outlawed Communist Party of the
Philippines.
   In a statement to news organizations last week, the New People's
Army said it traditionally observed a unilateral Christmas
cease-fire ``in areas where the fascist AFP (Armed Forces of the
Philippines) does not attack the revolutionary forces and the
masses.''
   The rebels said government offers of unilateral cease-fires were
``a hollow call devoid of sincerity'' because of stepped up military
operations against them.

   The state Court of Appeals has struck down
an ordinance adopted three years ago by voters in an overwhelmingly
white Detroit suburb that barred non-residents from using city parks.
   ``We are grateful this very racially divisive conflict may be
brought to an end ... as we approach the season of peace,'' said
Howard Simon, executive director of the American Civil Liberties
Union in Michigan.
   The ruling made public Tuesday agreed with the ACLU and the
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People that the
ordinance adopted by voters in the Detroit suburb of Dearborn in
November 1985 singled out blacks.
   Dearborn City Attorney William Hultgren said city officials are
studying the ruling and probably won't decide whether to appeal for
a couple of months.
   ``There have been comments in the past by elected officials that
it would be carried to the highest court,'' Hultgren said.
   ``The ball is in the city's court because it could appeal, but it
would be my hope they would put this behind them and realize the
interdependence of southeastern Michigan,'' Simon said. ``No
community is going to be able to build walls around itself. We are
all interdependent and intertwined.''
   Arthur Johnson, president of the Detroit branch of the NAACP,
said he was elated at the decision.
   The decision upheld a Wayne County Circuit Court ruling
overturning the ordinance. Non-residents have been free to use
Dearborn parks since the court fight began.
   ``We really haven't had any major problems. We really had fewer
problems after the court decision opened up the parks than before
the court decision,'' said Doyne Jackson, director of citizen
resources for Dearborn.
   The ordinance was approved after residents of Dearborn complained
that parks, swimming pools and ball diamonds along the city's border
with Detroit were being used by non-residents.
   About two-thirds of Detroit's 1.1 million residents are black;
fewer than 100 of Dearborn's 90,000 residents are black.
   Besides restricting use of parks to Dearborn residents, the
ordinance required park users to produce driver's licenses or other
identification proving their residency if stopped by police.
   Banning non-residents, the appeals court said, violated a
provision in the Michigan Constitution prohibiting discrimination on
the basis of race.
   The court said in order to be discriminatory under that part of
the constitution, an ordinance need only have a negative effect on
members of one race. Whether city officials intended to discriminate
was irrelevant, the court said.
   The provision allowing police to stop park users violated
portions of both the state and U.S. constitutions barring
unreasonable search and seizure because it gave police unfettered
discretion, the ruling said.

   PLO chairman Yasser Arafat accused
Israel today of undermining the ``very positive'' talks between the
United States and the Palestine Liberation Organization.
   ``Israel is using all available means to undermine the
dialogue,'' Arafat told a news conference during a one-day trip to
Yugoslavia.
   ``No doubt that the dialogue with the U.S. is very important, and
we are hoping that in the future it will have constructive results.
Its initial results are very positive,'' he said.
   Arafat's explicit recognition of Israel's right to exist and his
renunciation of terrorism led the United States to open talks with
the PLO in Tunisia on Friday for the first time since the United
States banned PLO contacts 13 years ago.
   Arafat said that Israel ``is using iron-fist policies'' and
charged it is preparing large-scale retaliation against Palestinians
in the Israeli-occupied territories, where Palestinians have been
staging an uprising.
   ``It is not by chance that on the day of the dialogue (with the
U.S.) the Israelis staged a massacre in Nablus,'' Arafat said. Five
Arab demonstrators were shot and killed by Israeli troops in the
West Bank town on Friday, and a sixth wounded protester died today.
   The agreement between Likud and Labor to form a coalition
government in Israel ``represents an agreement for war and not
peace,'' Arafat said.
   The coalition agreement between the two main Israeli political
parties bars peace talks with the PLO and the establishment of a
Palestinian state. It calls instead for negotiations with Jordan and
the Palestinians on the basis of the U.S.-brokered Camp David
Accords signed in 1978.
   The coalition agreement also calls for the expansion of Jewish
settlements in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Arafat said the accord between the two Israeli parties does not
provide for an international peace conference on the Middle East,
does not recognize independent Palestinian state, and envisages no
negotiations with the PLO.
   Arafat's visit to Yugoslavia, one of a series that followed
Washington's decision to open the dialogue with the PLO, comes as
part of an apparent campaign to drum up support for an international
Middle East conference under United Nations auspices.
   His trip follows visits to East Germany, Romania and Austria in
the past week. Arafat is to meet Premier Ciriaco De Mita in Rome on
Friday, De Mita's office said today.
   The Italian news agency AGI also reported that Arafat has
requested a meeting with Pope John Paul II. Arafat last met with the
pope in 1982. Vatican spokesmen could not be immediately reached to
comment on the report.

<TEXT>
   Parliamentary debate on a tax reform plan that would
give Japan a sales tax turned into a raucous shouting match today
when the governing party pushed the measures through a key committee
session.
   Opposition legislators stormed from their seats after the upper
house Tax System Committee chairman, Matazo Kajiki, interrupted nine
hours of deliberations to call a vote.
   The bills, which would cut corporate and income taxes while
introducing the new 3 percent sales tax, already have been approved
by the majority Liberal Democrats in the lower house. Passage in the
upper house, where the governing party also holds a commanding
majority, is expected Friday.
   The voting was carried live on national television.
   Viewers saw orderly rows of Liberal Democrats standing at their
desks in a stoic ``yes'' vote, while opposition members swarmed
around Kajiki's podium roaring their disapproval.
   Committee members stood on nearby desks and grabbed at Kajiki's
collar before security guards escorted the chairman out of the room.
   Earlier today, opposition parties, business groups and labor
unions rallied in Tokyo's Hibiya Park to denounce the sales tax,
which would go into effect on April 1. Police said 7,000 people took
part, but estimates on news reports ran as high as 12,000.
   ``We have fought our hardest to get the tax bills withdrawn,''
said Takako Doi, chairwoman of the largest opposition Japan
Socialist Party. ``We will continue to fight alongside you until the
last.''
   News reports said opposition legislators would introduce
no-confidence motions against Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita and
other leaders before the upper house votes on the bills Friday.
   Today's approval in the committee session was a key step toward
effecting the first major overhaul of Japan's postwar tax system.
Tax reform, a top goal of Takeshita's administration, has eluded
previous governments.
   Boycotts by a stubborn opposition derailed parliamentary debate
on the measures after disclosures last summer that Liberal
Democratic politicians, including Takeshita and former Finance
Minister Kiichi Miyazawa, profited from questionable stock dealings.
   The scandal resulted in amendments to introduce taxes on capital
gains, a large source of political funds. The government also is
considering opposition demands to boost aid to Japan's growing
elderly population.
   The current extraordinary session of parliament ends next week.
   The Shimouma Consumers' Cooperative Association, a Tokyo
consumers cooperative, says its study indicates that under the new
tax plan, a typical four-member household with an annual income of
$53,225 would pay $1,305 less in income and residents' taxes, but
the new sales tax would cost it an additional $500.

   Palestinians in the occupied
lands staged a general strike today to urge their Arab brethren in
Israel to show more support for their uprising.
   Arab sources said four Palestinians were wounded by Israeli
troops.
   In Israel, a military court sentenced four soldiers, including a
woman, to jail terms of up to nine months for beating Palestinians
at the Dhahiriya detention camp in the West Bank, the army said.
   Also today, a Nablus resident died of gunshot wounds suffered
during clashes in the city Friday, raising the death toll from those
clashes to six.
   Witnesses told the Jaffa military court that beatings were the
norm at Dhahiriya, a camp made up of tents and old stables in the
southwestern corner of the West Bank, the Haaretz newspaper
reported. Palestinian human rights activists say detainees are
frequently abused.
   The army denied beatings are a policy. ``I flatly deny any
allegations of a policy of torture or misconduct,'' said army
spokesman Col. Raanan Gissin. ``Some deviations did occur, and we
took the necessary measures.''
   The indictment against the four soldiers listed 22 beating
incidents at Dhahiriya in March.
   The defendants ``shared in a common desire to take vengeance on
Arab prisoners suspected of hostile actions against the army,'' the
Maariv newspaper quoted the judgment as saying. ``They did not
choose their victims, but beat any prisoner that came along.''
   Lt. Uzi Saadon on several occasions kicked prisoners and punched
them with his elbows, said an army spokeswoman.
   The court Tuesday convicted Saadon of aggravated assault and
conduct unbecoming of an officer. He was given a five-month jail
term, a seven-month suspended sentence and was demoted to private.
   Private Ronit Melnick, a clerk at the jail, beat prisoners
several times with a nightstick, Maariv said. She was given one
month in jail and a two-month suspended sentence.
   The newspaper quoted Ms. Melnick as saying the beatings were
prompted by an incident in which Arabs tried to attack her while she
was hitchhiking in southern Israel.
   Cpl. Victor Mesika was given nine months, with a nine-month
suspended sentence and demoted to private, the army spokeswoman
said. Cpl. Roman Goldstein got a three-month jail term and a
four-month suspended sentence.
   A military spokeswoman said the army was considering a request by
military court judges to investigate senior officers running
Dhahiriya.
   Nablus, the West Bank's largest city with 120,000 people,
remained under curfew for a sixth day today. Arab reports said
troops went from house to house, ordering residents to remove stone
roadblocks and paint over anti-Israeli slogans.
   The army also imposed curfews on the Gaza Strip's eight refugee
camps, confining 250,000 Palestinians to their home.
   Four Palestinians were shot and wounded in stone-throwing clashes
with soldiers in the village of Tubas, near Nablus, and the Tulkarem
refugee camp, Arab hospital officials said. An army spokeswoman said
she was not aware of the shootings but was checking the reports.
   The one-day strike shut down the occupied West Bank and Gaza
Strip as Palestinians closed down their shops and stayed home from
their jobs.
   The strike was called by the pro-PLO Unified National Leadership
of the Uprising to urge Arabs in Israel to show greater support for
the uprising.
   At Ramallah Hospital, Abdul Rahman Kadura of Nablus died today
after being shot in the chest last Friday, doctors said. The army
said it was checking the report. The death brough to 333 the number
of Palestinians killed since the uprising began Dec. 8, 1987.
Thirteen Israelis also have been killed.

   A jury asked to rehear testimony by the
prosecution's chief witness at Bess Myerson's divorce-fixing trial,
then sent the former Miss America and her co-defendants home for a
second day without a verdict.
   The U.S. District Court jury, which on Monday began deliberating
the conspiracy case, asked Tuesday to rehear Sukhreet Gabel's
testimony about a secret June 1986 meeting with Miss Myerson. The
jury also asked to rehear Judge John Keenan's instructions on the
law governing circumstantial evidence.
   The jurors then returned to their deliberations, recessing for
the night. They resumed deliberations this morning.
   Miss Myerson, who was Miss America in 1945; her lover, Carl
``Andy'' Capasso, 43; and former state Supreme Court Justice
Hortense Gabel, 76, are charged with plotting to cut Capasso's
temporary support payments to his estranged wife.
   The three were charged with conspiracy, mail fraud and aiding the
violation of state bribery laws. Miss Myerson, 64, also was charged
with obstruction of justice.
   If convicted on all counts, Miss Myerson could be sentenced to 30
years in prison and fined $513,000; her co-defendants up to 25 years
in prison and $263,000 in fines.
   Miss Myerson, once the city's cultural affairs commissioner, is
accused of giving a $19,000-a-year city job to Mrs. Gabel's
daughter, Sukhreet, to influence the judge, who was making interim
rulings in Capasso's bitter divorce from his wife, Nancy.
   The obstruction of justice charge against Miss Myerson stemmed
from an alleged attempt to influence Ms. Gabel's grand jury
testimony.
   According to Ms. Gabel, Miss Myerson, her former boss, arrived
unannounced to her apartment building in June 1986 while the grand
jury was investigating her hiring.
   Ms. Gabel testified that Miss Myerson told her during a nighttime
walk around the block that ``you could be dangerous,'' and that she
should ``keep your mouth shut.''
   The prosecution's case against Miss Myerson, Capasso and Mrs.
Gabel consisted of mainly circumstantial evidence because there were
no witnesses to the alleged bribe scheme.
   The government presented more than 30 witnesses and 100 pieces of
evidence to back up what they claimed were the illegal links between
the two undisputed facts in the case: Ms. Gabel was hired as Miss
Myerson's special assistant in August 1983 and a few weeks later,
Mrs. Gabel slashed Capasso's temporary support payments to his
estranged wife, Nancy, from $1,850 to $850 a week.

   Four gunmen who held up a Swiss
express train got away with $1.67 million in cash, police said today.
   Police said the ``Italian or French-speaking'' robbers were still
at large despite a large-scale manhunt mounted immediately after the
holdup Monday.
   The men boarded the intercity train shortly after 9 p.m. when it
stopped at the Zurich airport station. They made their way to the
baggage car at the end of the train, tied up two post office
employees and cut up the mailbags.
   A passenger from the adjoining first-class car happened to
witness the holdup and was sprayed with tear gas and subdued.
   Two men armed with a machine gun and a revolver then entered the
first-class car and held up about 20 passengers while the other two
collected the parcels.
   All four rushed off the train 15 minutes later during a stop at
Winterthur, north of Zurich, and fled on foot carrying their haul
and their weapons in blue canvas bags, police said.
   To determine the value of the haul, police had to contact the
senders of all insured parcels shipped on the train. The police
communique did not say who mailed the parcels, but a police
spokesman said earlier that investigators had been in touch with
several banks.

   The Labor Party today approved joining a
coalition with the rival Likud bloc, virtually assuring the
formation of a national unity government to run Israel for the next
four years.
   Earlier today, the right-wing Likud voted to approve the
government after an overnight session marked by shouting and heated
debate. Israel army radio said the two parties would formally sign
their agreement Thursday morning and the new government could be
installed by parliament immediately.
   At a meeting of the center-left Labor's 1,275-member central
committee, party head Foreign Minister Shimon Peres urged the
delegates to vote for the accord, saying it was the only chance to
stem Israel's growing isolation and conflict with its Western allies.
   The delegates voted yes by an overwhelming show of hands.
   ``If a joint government with Likud and Labor had not been
established, this process of isolation and conflict with the world
would have persisted,'' Peres said. ``By building such a government,
such a process will be halted.''
   Although Peres was expected to win approval to join a Likud-led
Cabinet, younger legislators argued heatedly against the proposed
government, saying it would be deadlocked over the peace process.
   ``You once called (Likud's Prime Minister) Yitzhak Shamir the
murderer of peace. Now he has three lawyers on his team so he can
murder it again,'' legislator Chaim Ramon was quoted by Israel radio
as saying.
   Peres also said the joint government was needed to curtail the
influence of ultra-Orthodox religious parties and would effectively
bar passage of a controversial ``Who is a Jew'' amendment.
   ``We didn't understand the extent of sensitivity among U.S. Jews
about the Law of Return. I believe that now this law will remain as
it is,'' Peres said.
   He referred to anger by American Jews, most of whom are
non-Orthodox, over the proposal to accept only Orthodox conversions
to Judaism.
   Peres also vowed that although he would become finance minister
in the new government, he would continue to work toward reviving
peace talks with Arab states. ``The flag of the peace process
remains in our hands. It has nothing to do with a ministry, he said.
   The daily Haaretz reported today that although Peres will be
finance minister, a secret addition to the coalition agreement
requires that he be consulted on all sensitive defense and foreign
policy decisions.
   The new Cabinet, expected to number between 23 and 25 ministers,
could be installed by a vote of confidence in a special meeting of
parliament as early as Thursday, Israel radio reported.
   The government will resemble the current broad-based coalition
that has ruled Israel since 1984. One major difference is that
Shamir will be prime minister for all four years, instead of
switching after two years with Peres.
   It was unclear how many of the four religious parties would join
the new government. Two of the parties, Shas and Degel Hatorah, have
said they would not join. The Agudat Israel and National Religious
Party also threatened to remain outside. None of the extremist
right-wing factions were expected to join the coalition.
   The new coalition agreement, a text of which was published by
Haaretz, also bars both large parties from pulling out and forming a
narrow coalition with smaller factions in the event of disagreements.
   New elections would have to be held if the government is toppled
by a no-confidence vote, the newspaper said.
   The coalition agreement bars peace talks with the PLO and the
establishment of a Palestinian state. It calls instead for
negotiations with Jordan and the Palestinians on the basis of the
U.S.-brokered Camp David Accords signed in 1978.
   The agreement also calls for the expansion of Jewish settlements
in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip and for the building of
five to eight new settlements in the next year. U.S. officials have
called such settlements an obstacle to peace.
   Likud's approval of the accord came just after 2 a.m. in secret
balloting by 1,445 party central committee members after a 4-hour
meeting in which opponents fiercely denounced the agreement.
   Some 796 delegates, or 55.1 percent, voted for the accord, with
642 delegates, or 44.4 percent, voting against and three abstaining.
   At the meeting, many members questioned whether joining a
government with Labor would not blur Likud's right-wing ideological
stance.
   Shamir declared that a unity government had a common enemy to
fight: the PLO-proclaimed independent Palestinian state.
   ``Despite the differences, we must be united against the danger
of a Palestinian state...and the international effort to push us
back to the ill-famed 1967 borders,'' Shamir shouted. Israel
captured the West Bank and Gaza in 1967.
   Hecklers interrupted his speech with shouts of ``boo,'' and
former Defense Minister Ariel Sharon led the opposition in demanding
a government without Labor.
   ``We need a government in which one party has a majority,''
Sharon said. ``Labor is a danger to Israel's future and security.''

   Fire engulfed a house early today,
killing four children and their mother, authorities said. The
woman's husband was critically burned.
   The fire in the 1{-story frame house in this Indianapolis suburb
broke out about 3 a.m. State police believed a new gas furnace was
installed in the home recently and might have caused the fire,
Trooper Shelli Jones said.
   Resident Roy Westcott, 34, was reported to have installed the
furnace himself last weekend.
   A next-door neighbor, Hal Ford, 51, said the blaze broke out soon
after he returned home from work.
   Ford said he heard an explosion and saw through a large picture
window in the Westcott home that one of the rooms was engulfed in
flames.
   However, Sugar Creek Township Fire Chief Jerry Nulliner said
there was no evidence of an explosion.
   Ford said he and his family rushed to the Westcott home.
   ``We got a window open, but we couldn't get in,'' Ford said.
``There was black smoke just pouring out of it. We knew it was too
late at that time.''
   The family said Westcott was running around outside the house,
yelling, ``Get the gas turned off, get the gas turned off!''
   Killed were Westcott's wife, Julia M. Kennedy Westcott, 34, and
her daughters Brandi Kay Neal, 16, Holli Ann Neal, 14, and Vernonica
Marie ``Vonnie'' Westcott, 6, said Hancock County Sheriff Nick
Gulling.
   The couple's son, Joshua Andrew Westcott, 4, was pronounced dead
at a hospital, authorities said.
   Mrs. Westcott and the children were found in the home's three
bedrooms. Two were found in their beds, two on the floor and one in
a closet, Gulling said.
   Westcott was flown to Methodist Hospital in Indianapolis, where
officials said he was listed in critical condition with burns over
27 percent of his body.
   New Palestine is about four miles east of Indianapolis.

   An earthquake damaged houses in a mountain village
of Soviet Kirghizia today, but apparently caused no injuries, Tass
reported.
   The official Soviet news agency said the quake in the small
Soviet republic bordering China registered 6 on the 12-point Soviet
scale that measures visible effects.
   An earthquake with a magnitude of 6 is listed by Soviet
references as a ``strong'' quake capable of knocking pictures from
walls and causing light damage to buildings.
   The quake that struck the republic of Armenia on Dec. 7, killing
an estimated 55,000 people, was reported to have had an intensity of
10.5 on the Soviet scale near its epicenter.
   Tass said the epicenter of the earthquake in Kirghizia, 1,300
miles south of Armenia, was on the southwest slopes of the Fergana
mountain range in the southern part of the republic near the village
of Shamaldy Sai.
   ``According to preliminary data, the tremors damaged houses in
the village, but there were no casualties,'' Tass said.
   Tremors also were felt in neighboring Uzbekistan, including in
that republic's capital of Tashkent which was heavily damaged by a
quake in 1966. There was no damage in Tashkent or any other city of
Uzbekistan, Tass said.
   In Denver, John Minsch of the National Earthquake Information
Service said the agency's seismology equipment had no reading on the
temblor.
   ``So far, I haven't found anything on the records. I'm still
searching, but it possibly is too small for us to see,'' he said.

<HEAD>15th Judge Convicted on Greylord Charges</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge convicted of tax evasion has become the
15th judge from the Cook County Circuit Court to be convicted or
plead guilty on charges stemming from the Operation Greylord probe.
   A U.S. District Court jury found Judge John J. McDonnell guilty
Tuesday on three counts of tax evasion, but could not reach a
verdict on two counts of extortion and one count apiece of
racketeering and obstructing justice.
   U.S. District Judge James H. Alesia declared a mistrial on those
counts, and U.S. Attorney Anton Valukas said he would seek a retrial.
   At a brief news conference after the verdict was announced,
Valukas said he was convinced his staff had enough evidence to
obtain McDonnell's conviction on the remaining charges.
   Valukas personally prosecuted McDonnell, with the aid of
Assistant U.S. Attorney Tom Durkin.
   ``There is no question in my mind,'' said Valukas, when asked if
he thought it was worth prosecuting McDonnell again.
   The jurors deliberated one hour Monday and most of the day
Tuesday before returning the verdict against McDonnell, 53, a former
federal prosecutor.
   McDonnell, who was appointed to the bench in 1971, faces a
maximum sentence of nine years in prison on the three tax evasion
counts.
   Since his indictment nine months ago, McDonnell has not sat as a
judge, but has received his full judicial salary.
   McDonnell was indicted by a federal grand jury March 16, along
with retired Cook County Circuit Court Judge Francis J. Maher, Sr.
The indictment accused the two of taking cash bribes to fix minor
traffic, drugs and weapons cases, and of having steered such cases
to certain lawyers.
   McDonnell was also accused of extorting bribes from attorneys and
telling them not to disclose the extortion to authorities, as well
as of failing to report the alleged bribe money in his income tax
returns.
   Defense attorney Patrick Tuite said after the verdict that the
government built its case on the testimony of three admitted
bribe-paying former attorneys, whom he called ``sleazebags.''
   The three, Bernard Mann, Cyrus Yonan and Karl Canavan, have all
pleaded guilty to paying bribes to judges.
   Operation Greylord, an undercover investigation of alleged
corruption in the Cook County court system, was first made public by
federal authorities in December 1983.

   Police raided a south London apartment today and
seized a cache of machine guns, explosives and equipment used to
build bombs, authorities said.
   They said the equipment was similar to that used in bombs by the
Irish Republican Army in its drive to oust the British from Northern
Ireland.
   Commander George Churchill-Coleman, head of Scotland Yard's
anti-terrorist branch, said it ``cannot be discounted'' that some
bombs have already been planted, and said two ``extremely
dangerous'' men are being hunted. Police appealed to the public to
be vigilant for suspicious objects.
   The haul included ``a substantial amount'' of Czechoslovak-made
Semtex, the explosive often used by the IRA, as well as an
unspecified number of machine guns and other firearms, bomb-making
equipment and photographs of two men believed to have fled the
apartment, police said.
   The cache was uncovered late Tuesday when an 18-year-old thief
tried to break into a car outside an apartment block in Clapham,
police said. He disturbed a man asleep on the back seat who pulled
out a gun and shot him in the stomach. The youth was hospitalized in
stable condition, police said.
   Police issued a nationwide alert to find two men believed to have
fled in a red car and searched the apartments near the car.

   Residents near the polluted Rocky
Mountain Arsenal claim the cleanup of a chemical dumping pond has
caused respiratory ailments and other health problems, and they want
the state to evacuate them.
   Gov. Roy Romer on Tuesday promised medical examinations for
families worried about their health but said the evidence so far
from the Army, the Environmental Protection Agency and the state
Health Department does not justify an evacuation.
   He said the Army, under the cleanup begun last spring, will put a
foot-thick clay cap over contaminated soil by Dec. 30 to prevent
blowing dust and fumes.
   The group Poisoned Arsenal Neighborhood of Irondale Community
claims residents of a six-mile area suffer from ailments caused by
chemicals stirred up during the cleanup at the site, situated in a
sparsely populated rural area.
   ``If somebody brought me information at 4 p.m. today that those
citizens are in danger, I'd order an evacuation immediately,'' Romer
said.
   Twice this month, the Army has evacuated workers during the $4.5
million cleanup of Basin F because of fumes from the 93-acre dumping
pond, which was used by the Army and Shell Oil for more than 30
years to dispose of pesticides and byproducts from the manufacture
of nerve gas.
   The Army did not notify the state or nearby residents of the
evacuations, saying monitors indicated the contamination did not
reach residential areas.
   More than 80 residents on the arsenal's western border have
signed a petition asking the state to buy their homes so they can
move, said Ira Daigle, owner of a 95-resident trailer park about a
mile from the basin.
   ``Nobody complained about being sick before April and May,'' he
said. ``When you talk to your neighbors, and they say `I've been
sick, I've been rundown and tired,' pretty soon we just got two and
two together and we thought this smell must be doing something.''
   Documents released under the federal Superfund cleanup process
say 150 chemicals were dumped in Basin F.
   Adrienne Anderson, Western director of the citizens group
National Toxic Campaign, said at least half the 80 chemicals she has
analyzed are known or suspected carcinogens, and the bulk are toxic
if inhaled.
   ``I have worked with evacuation-level situations before, and this
certainly is one of the most serious situations I have seen. It is
certainly my opinion these people are being poisoned,'' said
Anderson. ``We have the position that the agents there are so
dangerous that the governor should evacuate them as a precautionary
measure.''
   Symptoms reported by residents include headaches, nausea,
dizziness, severe skin irritation, spitting up blood and severe
upper respiratory tract irritation, Anderson said.
   ``The symptoms residents are reporting correlate perfectly with
the cheicals that have been identified by the Army at the site,''
Anderson said.

<HEAD>Santa Barbara Officials Revoke Permit For Offshore Oil, Gas Pumping</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTA BARBARA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The county Planning Commission has
nullified a permit allowing two oil companies to begin pumping crude
oil and natural gas from three recently completed offshore platforms.
   The commission invalidated the permit because the companies _
Chevron USA and Texaco Inc. _ underestimated concentrations of
poisonous hydrogen sulfide in the natural gas, county officials said.
   Tuesday's decision could delay production from the offshore oil
platforms for as long as a year, assuming a new permit is issued.
   The oil companies will appeal the commission's ruling to the
county Board of Supervisors, Chevron lawyer Ralph Mayo said. A
Chevron official estimated each day's delay in opening the platforms
could cost both companies a combined $500,000.
   Chevron and Texaco have invested a combined $2 billion on the
platforms, pipelines leading onshore near Point Conception and oil
and gas processing plants at nearby Gaviota.
   At the processing plants, impurities would be removed from the
crude oil and hydrogen sulfide would be removed from the natural gas
before shipment to a refinery.
   Two of the platforms were to be operated by Chevron and one by
Texaco.
   The permit for pumping oil and gas was issued in 1985 based on
findings that average concentrations of hydrogen sulfide in the gas
would run about 7,000 parts per million.
   But it was later determined that the actual number is closer to
15,000 parts per million. That finding led to Tuesday's 5-0 vote by
the planning commission to nullify the permit.
   The finding means a considerably larger area would be exposed to
lethal levels of the gas during a leak, according to Diane Guzman,
director of the county's Resource Management Department.
   The companies had planned to process eventually up to 200,000
barrels of crude oil a day and 120 million standard cubic feet of
natural gas.

   A crackdown on furloughs for inmates
convicted of violent crimes means fewer Texas prisoners will be
allowed to go home for Christmas.
   Texas Department of Corrections officials said they will release
only 45 inmates for seven-day Christmas furloughs, compared with 160
freed for the holiday last year.
   Of the 160, 37 were convicted either of murder or involuntary
manslaughter. Others included prisoners serving time for aggravated
assault on a peace officer.
   The furlough crackdown began after the presidential candidates
this year traded accusations about violent prisoners given prison
leave.
   President-elect George Bush criticized his Democratic challenger,
Massachusetts Gov. Michael S. Dukakis, for allowing violent
prisoners in Massachusetts to be released on furlough, including
Willie Horton, a murderer who was charged with raping a woman after
he failed to return from a weekend leave.
   Texas Gov. Bill Clements, a Republican, joined in the criticism
until he was forced to admit that similar policies were in effect in
his state. Nearly 900 prisoners, including 500 murderers, were
granted furloughs during Clements' administration.
   The Texas Board of Correction responded by narrowing the
eligibility for furlough. Among those excluded were inmates with
histories of sex offenses and those convicted of capital murder.
   Prison board Chairman Charles Terrell said Tuesday it was the
board's intention to tighten up, but not destroy, the furlough
program.

   President Raul Alfonsin today
called for unity among soldiers and civilians after the armed forces
chief and two generals resigned in an apparent concession to leaders
of a military revolt.
   Gen. Jose Dante Caridi, the army chief of staff, and Gens. Miguel
Abbate and Enrique Bianchi requested retirement Tuesday for
undisclosed reasons.
   Their ouster had been demanded by officers who led a four-day
rebellion early this month, the third army insurrection in 20 months.
   Gen. Francisco Gassino, 57, was named to replace Caridi. Gassino
has been loyal to Alfonsin during military insurrections in April
1987, January 1988 and Dec. 1-4.
   In his address to Congress this morning Alfonsin made no direct
references to the resignations or to allegations that the government
struck a deal with the rebels. But he made indirect references to
the rebellion and called for unity among civilians and the military.
   ``We are trying, nothing more and nothing less, to consolidate
the transition of a united people toward dignity. May God illuminate
the way to do that,'' Alfonsin said during a 35-minute speech to a
packed, special session of Congress.
   Sen. Eduardo Menem, leader of the opposition Peronist Party bloc,
criticized Alfonsin for not dealing directly with the cause of the
insurrection and what the government did to end it.
   ``The message of Dr. Alfonsin contains a declaration of
principles in which we all coincide, but nothing was said about what
happened,'' he said.
   The military ceded power to Alfonsin's elected government in
1983, and there have been four different armed forces chiefs since.
   Alfonsin's press secretary, Jose Ignacio Lopez, said the
president would meet after the speech with Caridi and Gassino.
   It was unclear if Alfonsin had demanded the resignations or
intended to promote Gassino to replace Caridi.
   The public view of Alfonsin's handling of the restive military
could affect his party's chances in the presidential elections set
for May 14.
   The insurrection began Dec. 1 and was declared over by Alfonsin
on Dec. 4. But ``loyalist'' troops were reluctant to fight the
estimated 800 rebels who had occupied part of a suburban army base,
the rebels were not immediately disarmed and most mutineers were
allowed to return to their units.
   In addition to the ouster of Caridi and other top generals, the
rebels had demanded an increased military budget including pay
increases and an end to the prosecution of officers for human rights
abuses during the eight years of military rule that ended in 1983.
   The opposition accused Alfonsin of cutting a deal with the
rebels, who were led by Col. Mohamed Ali Seineldin.
   Alfonsin denied making any deal. Nevertheless, a 20 percent pay
increase was granted to soldiers along with a $100 bonus.
   The rebels insisted they had no intention of toppling the
government, but politicians and labor and business leaders said that
by so severely undermining it, that would be the result.
   On Saturday, Defense Minister Horacio Jaunarena said in a speech
that the so-called ``dirty war'' against leftist subversion in the
late 1970s was necessary _ effectively endorsing the army's position
and infuriating human rights groups.
   At least 9,000 suspected leftist subversives were abducted during
the ``dirty war'' by Argentine security forces and vanished without
a trace, according to a government panel.
   Caridi's predecessor, Gen. Hector Rios Erenu, departed after the
first insurrection of Alfonsin's term, in April 1987. That revolt
was also touched off by the trials of officers for rights abuses.
   The selection of Caridi's successor has political overtones. If
he is replaced by an open supporter of Seineldin, that would damage
the credibility of Alfonsin and of the government's claim the
military is subordinate to it.
   In a television interview Friday, Caridi acknowledged he made a
deal with Seineldin, saying the insurrection ended when both
``realized that our aspirations coincided ... And so the question:
why confront one another to produce bloodshed if what they (rebels)
were asking, the army was (also) trying to achieve.''
   Caridi warned, too, that if rebels demands were not met, there
might soon be another insurrection.

<TEXT>
   Gov. Mario Cuomo today endorsed Ron Brown, a
former top campaign aide to Jesse Jackson, to become national
chairman of the Democratic Party.
   Because of Cuomo's stature within the party, the endorsement is
almost certain to strenghten Brown's campaign for the post.
   The governor made the endorsement in a letter to the state party
chairman and telephoned Brown to inform him of the action, said
press secretary Gary Fryer.
   Brown ``would make a superb national chair and if I had a vote to
cast at this moment, it would go to him,'' the governor wrote.
   The party's new leader is to be chosen at a meeting of the nearly
400 voting members of the Democratic National Committee in
Washington on Feb. 9 and 10. Chairman Paul Kirk has announced he
will not seek re-election.
   Other contenders for the post are Richard Wiener, Michigan party
chairman, and former Reps. James Jones of Oklahoma, Michael Barnes
of Maryland and James V. Stanton of Ohio.
   In his letter, Cuomo noted that of the announced candidates, he
knows Brown best. ``He was my student in law school and we have
stayed in touch over the years,'' said Cuomo, a former professor at
St. John's University Law School.
   Cuomo was considered a contender for the 1988 Democratic
presidential nomination but announced in 1987 that he would not run
and later said he wouldn't accept a draft if there were a deadlocked
national convention.

   An armored car company offered a
$70,000 reward for a gun-wielding Santa Claus and helper who robbed
two guards of more than $700,000, the FBI said today.
   Police and the FBI said the straight-faced Santa took two sacks
of cash from Dunbar Armored Security Inc. guards outside a United
Bank branch in a shopping plaza Tuesday morning.
   No shots were fired and neither guard was injured, police said.
One guard was apparently inside the bank, while the other was
carrying the sacks to a van.
   ``This is not a joke. Get up against the wall. Give me the bags
of money,'' the robber, between 35 and 40 years old, told the
guards, according to Detective Capt. Russell Hughes.
   The white-bearded robber, dressed in a Santa hat and trench coat
and bearing a silver revolver, hopped into a car with a male
accomplice and drove off, Hughes said.
   Authorities suspect that the robbers tailed the armored car to
the bank, said Terry Shumard, an FBI spokesman. He said the two bags
held more than $700,000 in cash.
   Shumard said Dunbar has authorized a $70,000 reward for
information leading to the arrests of the robbers.
   ``It's too bad people have to use Santa Claus like that because
kids look up to him,'' said a teller at the bank who would only
identify herself as Miss Mroz. ``This was really strange.''
   A Farmington resident who witnessed the robbery followed the
suspects' car in his van for about a mile on Interstate 84 and
provided investigators with descriptions of the robbers, Lt. Anthony
Duffy said.
   Employees and the two or three customers inside the bank at the
time were unaware the theft was taking place, according to teller
Jane E. Neveu.
   It was the third robbery of an armored car company in five years
in the suburban Hartford community of 60,000, including the 1983
theft of $7.1 million from a Wells Fargo depot, the second-largest
cash robbery in U.S. history.

   The government confirmed today that it
thwarted an attempt to overthrow Prime Minister Sadek Mahdi last
week and arrested 25 civilians and retired soldiers.
   Defense Minister Abdul-Maguid Khalil told reporters that the
situation has been brought under control. He gave no other details.
   Khalil was confirming a report in the newspaper Al-Siyassa.
   The independent paper reported that security men had crushed an
attempted coup on Saturday and arrested 25 retired military officers
and civilian officials from the former government of President
Gaafar Nimeiri, who was ousted in an April 6, 1985, coup. It was the
third newspaper report of an attempted coup in Sudan in the past two
weeks.
   After the Al-Siyassa report appeared today, about 300
demonstrators defied an emergency order and gathered in Khartoum's
Liberty square to demand government approval of a tentative
agreement to stop Sudan's civil war.
   The demonstrators in Khartoum's Liberty Square also ignored a
decision by rally organizers to call off the protest because Mahdi's
government declared a special emergency in the Khartoum area.
   Mohammed Osman Mirghani, spiritual leader of the Democratic
Unionist Party and the negotiator of the peace agreement with rebel
leader John Garang, reportedly urged that the peace march be
postponed.
   Garang, head of the Sudan People's Liberation Army, began his
civil rebellion in early 1983 to press demands for what he considers
fairer economic, political and administrative treatment for southern
Sudan.
   Mirghani told demonstration organizers that ``new developments in
the picture'' made a postponement of the rally necessary ``in the
interests of peace,'' the independent newspaper Al-Ayam reported.
   Riot police and plainclothes security men ringed the square as
protestors chanted ``No, no to war'' and ``Yes, yes to peace.''
   Witnesses said police confiscated several placards before the
demonstration began but did not intervene at the gathering itself.
   An officer told the gathering through a bullhorn that the
demonstration was called off and that people should disperse.
   The crowd finally broke up only after they were asked to leave by
Abbas Awad, a member of the organizing committee representing 54
political parties and labor groups supporting the peace agreement.
   ``We have specific information about plots aimed at jeopardizing
democracy in the country and that the demonstration of today would
have been used as a springboard for this purpose,'' Abbas told the
crowd.
   Interviewed later, he said the Democratic Unionists canceled the
demonstration because a ``group was planning to counter (it) ... to
spread chaos so that the army would intervene.''
   The Nov. 16 agreement calls for a cease-fire, a conference to
negotiate a permanent peace and to draft a new constitution and a
freeze on implementing Sudan's Islam-based legal code.
   It has caused deep splits in Mahdi's government. Mirghani's
party, junior partner in the coalition behind the premier's Umma,
wants the government officially to approve the pact. Mahdi refuses
to submit it for discussion, partly because to do so would drive out
the coalition's third major party, the fundamentalist National
Islamic Front.

   Gunmen slaughtered a rural family of
seven in the 80th massacre in Colombia this year, the national
police said today.
   Government investigators have said right-wing death squads are
suspected in most of the 640 killings so far this year.
   There was no immediate indication of who killed the family of
seven Tuesday night, the national police said in a news release.
   The reported killings were near the village of Patia, 120 miles
southwest of the capital of Bogota.
   The attorney general's office has said there are at least 140
right-wing death squads operating in Colombia.
   Leftist party leaders say the army operates the death squads, an
accusation denied by the Defense Ministry.

   Eleven Red Cross officials who were
evacuated from Lebanon after they received death threats arrived in
Cyprus today on their way home to Switzerland.
   The International Committee for the Red Cross said in Geneva on
Tuesday that it was suspending its humanitarian operations in
Lebanon because of ``serious threats against its delegates on
mission in Lebanon, placing their lives in acute danger.''
   The evacuees, eight men and three women, left five hours later
for Zurich. Six Red Cross officials remained in Lebanon and were due
to leave today.
   ``We're disappointed,'' said Francis Junot, deputy chief of the
Red Cross delegation in Lebanon. ``We received a communication from
Geneva and were ordered to leave ... I can't comment on the nature
of the threat.''
   ``This has never happened before,'' he said. ``We expect the
situation won't last and we'll be able to return after studying the
situation. We hope to return.''
   Junot, who has served in Lebanon on five separate ICRC missions
since 1981, said he had not felt in danger.
   Later today, the two largest Moslem militias in south Lebanon
appealed to the Red Cross to return, blaming a spate of terrorist
attacks on humanitarian workers on a ``criminal minority.''
   The appeals came in separate statements by the Sunni Moslem
Nasserite leftist militia that governs the southern port city of
Sidon and the mainstream Shiite Moslem Amal militia in Tyre.
   Both factions called for concerted action against terrorist
groups in south Lebanon in order to guarantee the safety of foreign
humanitarian agencies.
   The suspension of operations in Lebanon, torn by civil war and
factional violence for 13 years, was the first time the Red Cross
has withdrawn its workers from any country in its 125-year history
because of death threats.
   ``I came to Lebanon one year ago ... I didn't feel threatened and
I'm ready to go back anytime,'' said one of the evacuees who refused
to identify himself.
   The announcement Tuesday came four days after the release of
Peter Winkler, a Red Cross delegate who was held hostage for nearly
a month.
   After Winkler was kidnapped Nov. 17 in the southern port city of
Sidon, the Red Coss withdrew 10 of its 27 workers in Lebanon.
   Swiss authorities said Winkler's kidnappers, believed to be
pro-Iranian Shiite Moslems, sought a more lenient sentence for a
Lebanese Shiite, Hussein Hariri, who goes on trial in Switzerland
soon on charges of hijacking an Air Afrique airliner in June and
killing a French passenger.
   The Swiss were the largest Western community remaining in west
Beirut after waves of kidnappings, assassinations and civil war had
forced tens of thousands of foreigners to flee Lebanon in the last
13 years.
   The Red Cross workers were doing humanitarian work, including
fitting artificial limbs and visiting Palestinian and Lebanese
prisoners in jails in the Israeli-controlled section of south
Lebanon.
   About 150 Lebanese employees of the Red Cross have been told to
``go home for a week'' and await further word from Geneva on whether
a total shutdown will be ordered.
   The ICRC operates in about 80 countries, providing food and
medical relief to civilians trapped in wars, conflicts and disasters.
   Fifteen foreigners are currently being held in Lebanon, including
nine Americans, three Britons, an Irishman, an Italian and a Belgian.
   The longest held is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press, who was abducted March 16,
1985.

   A man shouldn't have been convicted of a
crime and sentenced to 32 years in prison after he tried to get a
refund for an electric razor for which he didn't have a receipt, the
Indiana Supreme Court ruled.
   The court Tuesday struck down the attempted theft and habitual
criminal convictions of Richard Allen Smith and ordered the
49-year-old Indianapolis man discharged from prison.
   In 1985, Smith received a 2-year sentence on the theft conviction
and 30 years for the habitual offender charge, which was supported
by earlier auto theft and drug convictions.
   ``It's the kind of case that could happen to anybody,'' said M.E.
Tuke, the public defender who handled Smith's appeal.
   Smith's problem began in November 1978, when he took a $42.96
Remington razor to a Hook's Drug store in Mooresville and later to
another outlet of the chain in Martinsville to get a refund. The
package he presented had a Hook's price tag on it, but employees
refused to give Smith a refund, citing store policy requiring a
receipt for a refund.
   He then went to a Danner's department store in Martinsville and
presented the razor, without a price tag, for a refund. Hook's
employees, suspicious about Smith's behavior, had alerted Danner's
employees of his earlier attempt to get a refund.
   Danner's employees called police when Smith showed up and stalled
until police arrived to arrest Smith, court records show.
   The long gap betwen his arrest and sentencing occurred because
Smith left the courtroom during his trial and remained at large for
four years, according to court records.
   Prosecutors argued at his trial that Smith attempted ``to exert
unauthorized control'' over Danner's profit margin by creating the
false impression he had purchased the razor at the store.
   However, the Supreme Court concluded that to prove Smith was
trying to create a false impression, the state needed to prove Smith
hadn't purchased the razor at Danner's. There was no evidence to
demonstrate where the razor was purchased, the court said.
   ``Without that crucial element of proof, every citizen engaging
in a simple refund transaction would risk criminal penalties,''
Chief Justice Randall T. Shepard wrote for the court. ``Some
citizens such as those seeking to return gifts simply do not know
where the item was originally purchased.''

   A couple who wrote columnist Ann Landers
saying they've kept their teen-age daughter chained in their
basement for several months should seek help, the state's top social
services official said.
   Social Services Director Patrick Babcock appealed on Tuesday to
the unidentified couple to call a state child abuse hotline for
help, saying the state's first objective would be to help the
family, not prosecute them.
   State officials tried to determine the identity of the couple
after reading the letter Tuesday in the Landers advice column, which
is syndicated and carried by 1,200 newspapers, but found it
impossible to determine whether the letter is authentic or a prank,
Babcock said.
   ``I'm not sure we will ever be able to trace it back,'' he said.
   Ann Landers was on vacation, but an assistant in her Chicago
office, Laurie Solomon, said today the anonymous letter was received
about two months ago. Miss Landers is about six to eight weeks ahead
on her column, Ms. Solomon said.
   ``All we had was a Detroit postmark,'' she said.
   ``Miss Landers did not question the authenticity of the letter,''
Ms. Solomon said. ``She's been doing this for so long, she generally
can tell when a letter is a fake letter.''
   The column ``doesn't always appear on the same day in every
paper, but this letter ran the day it was scheduled to appear,'' she
said.
   Ms. Solomon said the office has not heard from anyone claiming to
be the man who wrote the letter, but was contacted by Michigan
officials for help in tracking down the family.
   The letter was from a man who said he and his wife had punished
their 17-year-old daughter for her drug and alcohol abuse by
chaining her to a bed frame in the basement of their Detroit home,
initially for 24-hour periods.
   ``Our daughter has been chained to her bed frame in our basement
for three months now and we are afraid to let her out for fear of
getting into trouble with the law,'' said the letter.
   The man said the daughter was becoming hostile and had cut her
arm badly when she broke a bathroom window during her once-a-week
shower. He said he feared the arm might be infected, but he was
afraid to seek medical attention for her for fear of arousing
suspicion.
   The writer did not identify himself, signing the letter ``Needing
Guidance in Detroit.''
   Landers advised the writer to unchain his daughter and take her
to a hospital emergency room and to seek legal help.

   Immigration officials say they want the Justice
Department to eliminate a unit that may be contributing to the large
numbers of asylum applications they receive each day from Nicaraguan
and other Central American immigrants.
   A memo obtained by The Associated Press shows that immigration
commissioner Alan Nelson has asked Attorney General Dick Thornburgh
to dismantle the Asylum Policy and Review Unit in the Justice
Department.
   The Dec. 13 memo says the unit has cost too much _ $750,000 _ and
that its reviews of asylum rejections are ``just plain financially
wasteful.''
   The review unit has persuaded INS to reconsider denials in 35
cases and has referred another 35 cases to Justice Department
officials who then directed reversals, said department sources,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Nelson's memo also asked Thornburgh to modify a regulatory
proposal that would set up a centralized system of skilled officers
who consider asylum applications.
   The commissioner wants the asylum officers placed under the
control of district immigration directors around the country.
   Several advocacy groups have denounced new INS policies that
require asylum cases, which are mostly from Nicaraguans, to be
handled more aggressively.
   Because it acts as a law enforcement agency, INS ``promotes
immigration restriction,'' said Arthur Helton, an attorney for the
Lawyers Committee for Human Rights. ``Asylum is a humanitarian act
that is fundamentally incompatible with this law enforcement
mentality.''
   INS spokesman Duke Austin said Tuesday that 200 asylum
applications were handled in just three days in south Texas. More
aggressive handling of applicants has also been implemented in Miami
and Los Angeles, where huge backlogs had built up.
   Some 150 Nicaraguans were among the group whose applications were
processed Thursday, Friday and Monday in Harlingen, Texas, according
to the INS.
   The Central Americans are no longer being granted work permits
during a 30-day period in which decisions are to be made on whether
to approve or reject their asylum requests, said Austin.
   Following a directive from then-Attorney General Edwin Meese III
in July 1987, work authorization had been virtually automatic for
Nicaraguans once they presented themselves to immigration officials
saying they feared persecution from their country's leftist
Sandinista government.
   The Meese directive was in line with the Reagan administration's
overall opposition to the Sandinista regime. But INS now is facing a
nearly threefold increase in the number of Central Americans pouring
across the border illegally in south Texas and then seeking asylum.
   Some 60,700 people applied for asylum in fiscal 1988, up from
26,100 the previous year.
   INS has begun assigning additional personnel in an effort to
handle asylum applications more quickly and clear up an extensive
backlog.
   Those whose claims are found by INS to fall short of the standard
of ``well-founded'' fear of persecution may demand hearings before
immigration judges. But if INS declares their claims to be
frivolous, they won't be eligible for work permits while they await
a final decision. If their claims are rejected by the judges, they
could face deportation if they refuse to leave the country.
   INS wants additional steps taken that could make it more
difficult for asylum-seekers to have their applications approved.

   Dec. 18
   The Press-Enterprise, Riverside, Calif., on federal pay raises:
   It's said, by those urging federal pay increases, that the
current congressional salary of $89,500 may sound like a lot to the
average citizen, but the average citizen doesn't understand the
problem. ...
   A member of Congress, for instance, often has to support two
households on a salary that has lost purchasing power over the
years; that, and the high cost of D.C. living, is cited by the
advisory commission urging a raise in Senate and House salaries to
$135,000.
   Then again, average citizens may have trouble getting into one
home. ... And the average family _ $30,200 a year _ sustains its
purchasing power by relying on two incomes.
   All of which is to say that if it's sympathy the members of
Congress are looking for, they aren't going to get it. Except from
their own, of course. ...
   A case can be made that, considering their responsibilities, that
(salaries) can go up a turn or two, perhaps to the $100,000 level,
as long as it is tied to a ban on outside honoraria. But most
members of Congress still won't think they're getting what they
deserve. Few people do.

   Portland (Maine) Press Herald on the federal budget deficit:
   Bringing the government's annual deficits under control remains
our biggest domestic challenge. One of the easiest ways of raising
money for deficit reduction would be to increase the gasoline tax.
...
   The advantages of a boost in the present 9-cent-a-gallon federal
tax are numerous. Analysts estimate that each penny increase would
generate $1 billion a year in additional revenue. ...
   A couple of arguments make it difficult. First, ... the United
States is virtually without any mass transportation for much of the
public. ...
   Second, a gasoline tax increase would fall more heavily upon
lower-income groups than on the weathly. And the regressive nature
of the gasoline tax would be magnified since many of the nation's
poorer families operate older, less fuel-efficient cars.
   Nevertheless, America confronts the coming New Year one year
older and deeper in debt. The federal deficits simply have to be
reduced significantly. An increase in the gasoline tax offers a
partial solution. No one should reject it out of hand.

   The Albuquerque (N.M.) Tribune on the National Economic
Commission's stand on open meetings:
   The National Economic Commission, established by Congress last
February under a mandate to come up with a way to shrink the huge
federal deficit, displayed an unsettling arrogance the other day
when it canceled a meeting rather than comply with a court order to
open its discussions to the public.
   In response to a court suit filed by three news organizations and
Ralph Nader's group, Public Citizen, federal Judge Joyce Hens Green
told the commission that government ``sunshine'' laws require that
its meetings be open to the public.
   Rather than comply, the commission canceled its next scheduled
meeting, and its general counsel reportedly is looking for ways to
get around the judge's ruling.
   What are members afraid of? If the commission wants public
support for whatever it recommends, it stands a better chance of
getting it if the people who pay the bills are let in on the
decision-making process.

   Fort Lauderdale (Fla.) Sun-Sentinel on John Tower as defense
secretary:
   John Tower may have been the best friend the Pentagon ever had
during his days as chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee,
but the diminutive Texan is going to have to trade his sword for a
scissors as George Bush's secretary of defense.
   His old committee, now chaired by Democrat Sam Nunn of Georgia,
should make certain in confirmation hearings that Tower's conversion
from screeching hawk to eagle-eyed overseer is genuine. ...
   The Senate, which tends to handle alumni such as Tower with
excessive courtesy during confirmation hearings, should put aside
the kid gloves in its inquiry into Tower's fitness to head the
Defense Department.
   Only the most vigorous personal and philosophical investigation
of Tower's credentials is in order when the position is so important
and the candidate is so controversial.

   The Evening Sun, Baltimore, on Jack Kemp as HUD secretary:
   The ... appointment of Rep. Jack Kemp to be secretary of Housing
and Urban Development in the Bush administration strikes us as an
imaginative choice.
   That may sound surprising, coming from a newspaper which has
criticized the Kemp-Roth supply-side economic theories which have
brought the nation to grief during the past eight years.
   Rest assured, if Kemp had been appointed Treasury secretary or
chairman of the economic advisers, it would have been time to sound
the sirens throughout the land.
   But as HUD secretary, Kemp will not be applying his crackpot
economic theories; rather, he will be putting his considerable
energy and determination behind revitalization of America's cities.
   Throughout the Reagan administration, urban policy has been based
on a fantasy called enterprise zones to encourage inner city
development through tax relief. The policy wasn't thought out
clearly to begin with and was administered with such cavalier
indifference that the General Accounting Office only last week
pronounced the enterprise zones program in Maryland a waste of time
and money.
   Now Kemp will have a chance to make the promise good, if it can
be done.

   St. Louis Post-Dispatch on Bush's Cabinet choices:
   President-elect George Bush has made two disappointing choices in
naming Sen. John Tower defense secretary and ... settling on Rep.
Jack Kemp as secretary of Housing and Urban Development. ...
   Bush apparently was trying to mollify the party's right wing, but
there was no need to. Any debt he owed the far right was paid when
he selected J. Danforth Quayle as his running mate. ...
   Tower's selection as defense secretary could cause the new
president serious political problems. The former Texas senator has
pledged that he will work to control the Pentagon's budget and to
reform the military's wasteful and fraud-ridden procurement system.
But to do so, ... Tower will have to go completely against his own
hawkish track record.
   While in the Senate, he fought hard for every useless or
overpriced Pentagon program that came along and he resisted
procurement reform proposals. In a deficit-tight era, with the
Pentagon facing unavoidable cuts, ... Tower is the wrong man. By
picking him, ... Bush is practically guaranteeing confrontation with
Congress over military spending. ...
   Kemp is well known for his strong ideological commitment to
supply-side economics and a return to the gold standard. He can be
expected to advocate a laissez-faire approach to housing for the
poor that won't meet their needs.

   The Times, Trenton, N.J., on federal pay raises:
   Some citizens will look at the 50 percent pay raises recommended
for members of Congress ... and recoil in horror.
   Senators and representatives already receive $89,500 a year. How
can another $45,000 ... possibly be justified?
   Well, read the fine print.
   The congressional raises (would be linked) to a ban on honoraria,
... fees paid to members of Congress by special interest groups for
giving a speech, or writing a blurb, or just showing up at an event.
   Getting rid of that kind of hidden payola would constitute an
investment in good government.
   And, as Common Cause President Fred Wertheimer warns, make sure
that the door is also closed on other, roundabout ways by which
special interest might provide financial benefits to members of
Congress. Not doing this, as ... Wertheimer says, ``will only lead
to the honoraria problem surfacing in new forms.''

   Statesman-Journal, Salem, Ore., on federal pay raises:
   After we get over the initial shock of a 50 percent increase in
pay for our congressmen, federal judges and top government
officials, the raise will look like a good deal for them and for us.
...
   We get what we pay for. If we don't pay senators and
representatives enough to maintain a home in Washington, D.C., and
afford the normal duties of a federal lawmaker, then the average man
and woman won't be able to serve in Congress. ...
   When the dentist bill or the tuition payment comes due, a
congressman who is supporting one household at home and another in
D.C. may do what he has to. He or she will accept money from special
interest groups. The payment is called an honorarium. ...
   The proposed pay increase would abolish the honorarium. ...
   The average (pay) for all of us should be higher. ... The effort
should be on giving the low-paid a decent salary, not on denying pay
that is adequate for men and women filling our most important public
offices.

   The Morning News Tribune, Tacoma, Wash., on U.S.-PLO talks:
   The difference between what Yasser Arafat said in English at a
news conference (Dec. 14) and what he said in Arabic before the
United Nations (Dec. 13) in Geneva was so small as to be almost
invisible to the naked eye.
   But it was important enough to matter _ and to pave the way for
the first direct talks in 13 years between the U.S. and Palestine
Liberation Organization. ...
   Arafat and the State Department thought they had worked out .. .
precisely what Arafat had to say in Geneva to meet the three
conditions the U.S. has set for dealing with the PLO on the
Palestinian issue. But his speech came up short, in the U.S.
estimation, and again the U.S. declared Arafat had not gone far
enough. ...
   In his press conference, Arafat specifically renounced without
qualification ``all forms'' of terrorism. He also dropped the
qualifiers he had previously attached to the PLO's acceptance of
U.N. resolutions outlining Israel's right to exist.
   That was enough. Now, the U.S. has properly shifted the onus to
Israel, which must demonstrate it is serious about pursuing
realistic options for a settlement. It cannot pretend there's a
solution to the Palestinian question that does not involve the PLO.

   The Honolulu Star-Bulletin on U.S.-PLO talks:
   What (PLO Leader Yasser) Arafat's statement means, however, is
far from certain. He does not speak for everyone in the PLO, much
less the entire Arab world. And he is notorius for changing his
position to suit his circumstances.
   Israel doesn't believe either Arafat or the PLO has changed, and
wants nothing to do with them.
   It may be no coincidence that this initiative was taken by an
outgoing administration at a time when the political fallout can be
minimized. President-elect Bush was undoubtedly involved in the
decision.
   It will now be up to the incoming Bush administration to make
what it can of this breakthrough.

   Daily Journal, Fergus Falls, Minn., on federal pay raises:
   ``Underpaid'' is not generally a term used to describe those who
earn $89,500 a year, so it's hard for most people to feel much
sympathy for members of Congress.
   Thus, Americans ... are not likely to passionately embrace the
idea of raising lawmakers' salaries by 50 percent. Yet it's true
that a pay raise for Congress is in order. ...
   A presidential advisory commission recommended that members of
Congress, along with federal judges and other top government
officials, receive pay raises of 50 percent. The panel attached one
stipulation to its recommendation, though, and that is the reason
this pay raise should be adopted: Members said members of Congress
should get the raise IF they could no longer collect speaking fees.
   It's those speaking fees that leave Americans with the impression
that their lawmakers are being bought and sold by the monied
interests of the nation.
   No one is suggesting that government officials should get rich
off their public service. But it isn't unreasonable for the
government to pay enough so that public service isn't an enormous
financial sacrifice; if that's the case, only the rich can afford to
run for office, and, in the end, it's the country that ends up
poorer.

   The Janesville (Wis.) Gazette on the shortage of registered
nurses:
   A federal commission studying ways to resolve the nationwide
shortage of registered nurses called for higher pay.
   That's no surprise. But the panel said attention also must be
given to increasing professional representation of nurses on
policymaking. The latter may hold just as much a key to the solution
as the pay.
   The 19-member commission convened by the Department of Health and
Human Services noted that with increasing frequency, nurses provide
services that should be carried out by other health care workers.
   In the past five years, the commission said, the nation's
hospitals had laid off 100,000 staff employees and added their
duties to those of other nurses.
   The panel also reported that nurses were being asked to render
more care typically performed by such higher-priced personnel as
respiratory and physical therapists.
   Giving employees increased input on policy-making matters has
become more common in many lines of work in the past decade as
companies seek ways to improve quality, increase competitiveness and
contain costs. Nurses on the front lines of the exploding medical
care field should have plenty to offer in that continued search for
excellence.

   The Times-News, Hendersonville, N.C., on the governor's right to
veto:
   North Carolina's governor is the only governor in the union who
can't veto legislation. ...
   Now state Rep. Al Lineberry, D-Guilford, has said that he's
preparing a bill for the 1989 legislature that would, among other
things, give the governor veto power and limit the number of terms
top legislative leaders could serve.
   Sounds good, but it's not, principally because the veto as
envisoned by Lineberry and House Speaker Liston Ramsey, D-Madison,
largely would be symbolic.
   A simple majority in the legislature would be required to
override it. Because a simple majority is required (on three
readings) to pass legislation to begin with, what's the point?

   The Decatur (Ill.) Herald and Review, on recruiting violations:
   Nevada-Las Vegas basketball Coach Jerry Tarkanian'a case against
NCAA investigators has been winding its way through the courts for
more than a decade.
   When it began, the Nevada Supreme Court and a U.S. district court
agreed that NCAA probers had exceeded the bounds of procedural good
taste during an investigation of recruiting improprieties at
Nevada-Las Vegas under Tarkanian from 1975 to 1977.
   At the time, courts were inclined to protect individuals from the
wrath of private as well as governmental bodies, insisting that
private investigative bodies follow proper rules of due process. . ..
   Tarkanian might well have won his dispute had his lawyers gotten
to the Supreme Court by the mid-1980s.
   Alas, in the late 1980s, the courts, following the lead of the
Reagan administration, seem more than willing to let private bodies
act in ways that would bring sharp censure to government bodies.
   In effect, the court argued, in a 5-4 decision, that the NCAA,
being a non-government, had no obligation to observe constitutional
decorum during its probe of Tarkanian.

<HEAD>Former ABC News Anchorman Dies of AIDS Complications</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 15th graf to correct Bernstein as ABC bureau chief in
Washington in 1980 and 1981</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Max Robinson, who became the first black to
anchor a U.S. network news show but soon was beset with personal and
career problems, has died at 49.
   Robinson succumbed to complications of AIDS, said Tonya Swanson,
a spokeswoman for Howard University Hospital. A family spokesman,
Roger Wilkins, said Robinson had been ill for more than a year and
had been bedridden for a month.
   Robinson had hoped that his death would highlight the urgency of
the AIDS problem, Wilkins said in a statement issued Tuesday on
behalf of the family.
   ``During his battle with the disease, Mr. Robinson expressed the
desire that his death be the occasion for emphasizing the
importance, particularly to the black community, of education about
AIDS and methods of its prevention,'' the statement said.
   AIDS is a contagious disease that attacks the body's immune
system, rendering it incapable of resisting other diseases and
infections. The chief victims of the incurable disease have been
homosexual men and intravenous drug abusers. Health officials
estimate that heterosexual contact is responsible for 4 percent of
cases.
   Robinson in 1978 left Washington television station WTOP, where
he had won top ratings as an anchorman for a decade, to join ABC as
the first black to anchor a network news show. He co-anchored the
ABC Evening News from Chicago with Peter Jennings in London and
Frank Reynolds in Washington.
   ``He made an important contribution to ABC News for which we will
always be grateful,'' Roone Arledge, president of ABC News in New
York, said in a statement. ``It is tragic to see his life end at
such a young age.''
   Ronald Townsend, president and general manager of WUSA-TV,
successor to WTOP, said: ``Broadcast journalism has lost a strong
voice for fairness, equality and human rights.''
   ``He had great presence on the air,'' said James Snyder, vice
president for news for Post-Newsweek Stations, who worked with
Robinson.
   Snyder and others said pressures on Robinson, a moody man, as a
pioneer worked against him.
   ``When Max went to the network, he was not as successful as he
was here,'' said Snyder. ``He had a lot of pressure, pressure from
his friends. But he had the opportunity to be the first black
network anchorma. He had to take it.''
   ``There were personal demons he was wrestling with,'' said Gordon
Peterson, his former co-anchor here. ``I kind of wish he had stayed
here. I don't think it (working at the network) worked well for
him.''
   Robinson spoke out frequently on behalf of better treatment and
more visibilty for blacks in the media.
   In February 1981 he told an audience at Smith College in
Northampton, Mass., that the news media was a ``crooked mirror''
through which ``white America views itself.'' He said that ``only by
talking about racism, by taking a professinal risk, will I take
myself out of the mean, racist trap all black Americans find
themselves in.'' Later, he said he did not mean to single out ABC
for critcism.
   Carl Bernstein, ABC's Washington bureau chief in 1980 and 1981,
said Robinson was deliberately excluded from any decision-making
related to the newscast.
   ``There are those, I believe, in the industry, who were either
jealous or had problems with Max,'' agreed Dwight Ellis, head of the
National Association of Broadcasters. ``He was a really outspoken
man.''
   A frustrated Robinson often complained publicly about the network
and charged it with racism in a speech at Smith College in February
1981.
   After Reynolds' death in 1983, Jennings was made sole anchor of
the newscasts, and Robinson was relegated to weekend anchor stints
and news briefs.
   In 1984, he joined Chicago television station WMAQ. The following
June he entered a hospital specializing in alcohol rehabilitation,
suffering from ``emotional and physical exhaustion,'' according to
Nick Aronson, director of communications for WMAQ. He never returned
to the station and did sporadic free-lance work after that.
   ``I think one of my basic flaws has been the lack of esteem, not
really feeling great about myself, always feeling like I had to do
more,'' Robinson said in an interview with The Washington Post last
May.
   Robinson started his broadcasting career as a disc jockey in his
hometown of Richmond, Va. He moved to Washington in 1965.
   He is survived by his mother, Doris Robinson Griffin, and
stepfather, the Rev. James Griffin, of Norfolk, Va.; four children,
Mark, Maureen, Michael and Malik Robinson; two sisters and a
brother. Robinson's marriages to Eleanor Booker and Beverly Hamilton
ended in divorce, and a third marriage was annulled.

<TEXT>
   U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell today set
Jan. 31 as the starting date for the trial of former National
Security Council aide Oliver North in the Iran-Contra affair.
   Gesell's decision came at the end of an hour-long hearing in
which one of North's lawyers, Barry Simon, pressed the judge to set
a trial date.
   Simon said the defense ``would like to get subpoenas out'' to a
number of people, including some in the Reagan administration who
will be leaving government next month ``for the four corners of the
earth.''
   ``We certainly hope we can meet that date,'' John Keker, who will
head the prosecution team appointed by independent counsel Lawrence
Walsh, said after the hearing.
   During the hearing, Keker revealed that the government is trying
to obtain notebooks which North compiled while he was the NSC.
Portions of the notebooks were disclosed at congressional hearings
last year which looked into the sale of arms to Iran and the
transfer of profits to Nicaraguan rebels.
   During the hearing, Simon, who has clashed repeatedly with
Gesell, complained that North's lawyers should be told which
portions are classified among some 30,000 pages of documents it has
in its possession. Simon has said the documents are relevant to the
defense of the former White House aide and that in some cases
perhaps only a single word or sentence in a document of several
pages is classified.
   Prosecutors said it would take several weeks to identify which
portions of all the documents are classified.
   North's lawyers have until Jan. 3 to identify 300 classified
documents they plan to use at trial.
   There are legal obstacles that could scuttle a trial of North
before it gets started, particularly the question of using
classified documents.
   Experts from the U.S. intelligence community are meeting with
aides to Walsh in sessions dealing with deletions of sensitive
information from classified documents.
   Gesell ruled Dec. 12 that too much material relevant to the case
had been excised from some classified documents Walsh wants to use
as evidence at trial.
   Material had been blacked out from portions of 300 classified
documents he is planning to use at trial. Gesell said that while the
documents had all been properly classified, too much had been held
back, especially if a jury was to understand the facts of the case.
   Gesell said that all references to eight countries involved in
the Iran-Contra affair must be restored and made public at trial.
The countries included Israel, Iran and Nicaragua.
   The judge also said that the text of information obtained by
intelligence must for the most part be presented verbatim. He said,
however, the methods and techniques used to obtain intelligence
reports should remain secret.

   A Soyuz space capsule carrying two Soviets who set
a one-year space endurance record and a Frenchman landed safely
today after a three-hour re-entry delay caused by an overloaded
computer, Tass said.
   The official Soviet news agency said the craft, which separated
on schedule from the Mir space station earlier today, touched down
at 12:57 p.m. Moscow time 60 miles from the Baikonur space center in
Soviet Central Asia.
   Vladimir Titov and and Musa Manarov were joined for the descent
by a French astronaut, Jean-Loup Chretien of France, who spent
nearly a month on Mir.
   ``Immediate medical check-ups showed the cosmonauts are feeling
well,'' Radio Moscow said.
   The landing ended mankind's longest space mission. Titov and
Manarov had been in space for 365 days, 22 hours and 39 minutes.
   The cosmonauts left the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan at 2:18
p.m. on Dec. 21, 1987.
   Radio Moscow said Titov and Manarov were undergoing tests to
determine how well they had endured their lengthy flight. Soviet
officials have said the ability of cosmonauts to endure long periods
in space is a key to a manned flight to Mars they hope will take
place shortly after the turn of the century.
   Titov and Manarov replaced a crew including cosmonaut Yuri
Romanenko last December and went on to break Romanenko's record of
326 days in space.
   The official Tass news agency said the crew switched to a back-up
computer program after a fault developed in the operation of the
on-board computer. The main engine fired to slow the capsule at
12:08 p.m., and the living quarters and instrument module were
jetisoned, Tass said.
   As expected, radio contact with the craft was lost between a
height of 90 miles to 50 miles because the craft was enveloped by a
plasma cloud. The capsule's parachutes opened at a height of about
six miles.
   Soviet television reported before today's touchdwon that
``automated telementry showed an overload in the computing
complex,'' of a system aboard the Soyuz TM-6 capsule. It provided no
details.
   It was not clear whether re-entry was computer-guided or if the
cosmonauts switched over to manual control to guide the ship to
Earth as Tass had said they might. There also was no immediate word
on the exact function of the computer, or the nature of the overload.
   On Sept. 7, equipment and human error delayed by a full day the
landing of another Soyuz capsule that had separated from Mir. In
that incident, veteran cosmonaut Vladimir Lyakhov and Afghan Abdul
Ahad Mohmand ran dangerously low on food and air before landing
safely.
   At the time, Soviet media reported the capsule's life-support
system could hold out for two days but space officials said the
cosmonauts could make it stretch to a week. But today's mission
carried three cosmonauts instead of the two on board the September
mission.
   The U.S. mark for the longest manned mission is 84 days, set in
1973 by astronauts Gerald Carr, Edward Gibson and William Pogue
aboard the Skylab space station.
   Chretien rocketed into space Nov. 26 along with cosmonauts
Alexander Volkov and Sergei Krikalev, who remained aboard the space
station. Valery Polyakov, sent to the Mir orbiting complex in the
fall to monitor the health of Titov and Manarov, also remained
behind.
   While aboard the space station, Chretien and Volkov made a space
walk to deploy an experimental framework to help plan the
construction of scientific equipment. They also conducted a series
of medical and biologial experiments.

   Vietnamese boat people protesting a shortage of

is serving as their shelter, police said.
   The 162 refugees have been forced to live on the vessel in Hong
Kong harbor because a refugee center on the outlying Green Island
was overcrowded, authorities said.
   The refugees calmed down after talking to United Nations
representatives and authorities who promised to look for other
accommodations, police said.
   It was the third protest in as many days by the refugees, who
also complained of a lack of warm clothing. Until Friday, the vessel
housed 472 Vietnamese, but more than 300 have moved to the Green
Island center.
   About 600 Vietnamese refugees, many of whom fled by boat from
their homeland, have arrived in Hong Kong in the past month.

   Americans' personal income declined 0.2 percent
in November, falling from unusually high October levels caused by
bonuses to auto workers and a surge in farm subsidy payments, the
government said today.
   The Commerce Department said income fell $8.2 billion to a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of $4.18 trillion last month,
following a gain of 1.7 percent in October, which had been the
largest in a year. November's decline was the first since January,
when incomes dropped 0.4 percent.
   Excluding the distorting effects of the two special factors,
personal income rose 0.6 percent in November and 0.8 percent in
October, both fairly strong gains.
   Meanwhile, personal consumption spending, which includes
everything except interest payments on debt, rose 0.6 percent to a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of $3.32 trillion last month after a
robust 1.0 percent gain a month earlier.
   The biggest increase in spending last month was for durable goods
_ ``big ticket'' items expected to last three or more years. The
category rose 1.5 percent, followed by a 0.6 percent increase for
non-durable goods and a 0.3 percent rise in spending for services.
   With spending rising faster than income in November, the personal
savings rate _ savings as a percentage of after-tax income _ was 4.3
percent, down from 5.2 percent in October.
   Disposable, or after-tax income, declined 0.3 percent in November
following a 1.7 percent gain a month earlier. It was the first
decline since April, when annual income tax payments depressed
personal income by 1.4 percent.
   Wages and salaries, a key component of personal income, was up
0.4 percent to $2.52 trillion in November following a large 1.5
percent increase caused by bonuses to auto workers. Manufacturing
salaries edged down 0.5 percent after a 2.2 percent increase a month
earlier.
   Farm income, usually a volatile category, plunged 64.6 percent to
$15.7 billion after soaring 62.9 percent in October.
   White House deputy press secretary Roman Popadiuk said,
``Personal income continues to rise at a healthy pace and in line
with gains reported over the past 12 months.''

<TEXT>
   A prosecutor said today that two
West German companies are being investigated in connection with the
suspected illegal sale to Pakistan of material that can be used in
the production of atomic weapons.
   The prosecutor also said officials have evidence that atomic
reactor equipment was illegally sold to Pakistan, India and South
Africa.
   State prosecutor Albert Farwick said the investigation began in
mid-November with a search at the Neue Technologie GmbH company in
Gelnhausen, 15 miles east of Frankfurt.
   The offices of NTG's sister company, Physikalisch Technische
Beratung in Ortenberg 25 miles northeast of Frankfurt also were
searched, Farwick said in a telephone interview.
   Records at both companies were confiscated, he said.
   Farwick said the companies are under investigation for possible
violation of West German laws governing the export of nuclear
industry equipment. He would not comment on whether the
international Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty might have been
violated.
   Pakistan has not signed the treaty and reportedly has invested
vast sums of money in development of its own nuclear bomb.
   Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto of Pakistan said in an interview
Sunday that Pakistan has no plans to make nuclear weapons but won't
sign the non-proliferation treaty unless India does.
   In a statement released to the news media, Farwick said NTG
officials have admitted delivering technical equipment to Pakistan
as recently as the summer.
   ``We know that they delivered equipment for processing tritium
and that they delivered tritium gas,'' he said. Atomic experts say
tritium gas is used to boost the effectiveness of atomic weapons.
   ``Further investigation revealed that technical nuclear items
were also delivered to India and South Africa,'' he said.
   Farwick said those items included ``reflector material and
cadmium pipes for India, and a test device to measure burn elements
for South Africa.''
   A West German atomic expert, Jens Scheer, said the nuclear
equipment in question is ``crucial in the construction of
conventional reactors ... but is not ideal for military ends.''
   According to Farwick, NTG's firing of a former technical manager
for misuse of company funds without pressing charges against him led
to officials opening the investigation.
   The company apparently decided not to press charges or demand
return of the money from the former manager in an attempt to cover
up the alleged illegal nuclear deals, said Farwick.
   Farwick said the investigation thus far indicates that the former
NTG manager and a manager from PTB had close contact with
representatives of Pakistani nuclear officials since 1982.
   The prosecutor also said the former technical manager of NTG, who
was initially arrested in connection with the case, has since been
released pending further investigation.
   Farwick declined to identify by name the company officials under
investigation in the case.

   A bottlenose dolphin today eluded
rescuers who tried four times to snare it and move it to warmer
waters for the winter.
   By late morning, the rescuers suspended their efforts to try to
decide what to do next.
   As many as nine boats and about 30 people were involved in the
risky rescue attempt that began this morning about 8 a.m. on Broad
Bay, but the animal swam away after each attempt.
   The rescuers also were faced with a leaking inflatable boat and a
strong current that at one point wrapped a net around one boat's
propeller.
   After one attempt to snare the dolphin, one radio transmission
called out, ``Hold off, hold off. He got through us.''
   The effort was coordinated by a dolphin expert from New Jersey
and was authorized Monday by the National Marine Fisheries Service.
   The male dolphin, nicknamed Rascal, failed to migrate south for
the winter. Rescuers hoped to capture the mammal in nets and fly it
to North Carolina's Outer Banks.
   The dolphin's plight rallied residents of this coastal community.
   ``Anything we can do to help, we want to help,'' said Josiah
Woodington, a resident assisting in the rescue effort. ``I think
that it's great that we can come together and catch this fish. ''
   The Virginia Institute of Marine Science in Gloucester Point had
opposed an attempt to capture the dolphin, saying it could drown in
the net or take in water and develop pneumonia.
   Robert Schoelkopf, director of the Marine Mammal Stranding Center
in Brigantine, N.J., who was to coordinate the rescue, agreed it was
risky.
   ``You weigh that against the ultimate fate of the animal if
nothing's done,'' he said. ``That animal would die in the area if we
didn't do anything.''
   The dolphin was in Broad Bay on Tuesday, said Kathy Read, a
diving instructor who worked on the rescue plans.
   ``He still circles the boat and stays right with you. Hopefully,
he'll be ready to move south,'' she said.
   Residents had been lobbying for the rescue since the dolphin was
noticed in the bay in early October. Since then, it has become thin
and slowed down, probably because of a lack of food, Ms. Read said.
Water temperature in the bay has dipped to 42 degrees.
   Residents believe the dolphin stayed in the bay because it was
frightened of bridge construction in a narrow channel that links the
bay and open water.

<HEAD>Jewish, Catholic Leaders Meet To Monitor Auschwitz Nuns</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Jewish leader said today that Roman Catholic
officials have renewed their pledge to move a convent of Carmelite
sisters out of Auschwitz, the former Nazi concentration camp where
millions died.
   The monastery was established by a dozen nuns in 1984, setting
off protests by European Jews who believe the death camp should
remain an undisturbed memorial to its victims.
   Jewish leaders met Tuesday in Paris with four Roman Catholic
cardinals to discuss progress toward moving the convent to another
location by Feb. 22, 1989, a deadline set in previous meetings.
   Theo Klein, president of the Council of French Jewish
Institutions, denied that Jewish leaders were dissatisfied with the
talks.
   Reports in the French and U.S. press quoted Elan Steinberg,
executive director of the World Jewish Congress, as saying, ``After
the Carmelite affair and Pope John Paul's visit with (Austrian
President) Kurt Waldheim, we are questioning the Vatican's attitude
toward the Holocaust.''
   Klein said Steinberg had not attended any of the meetings and was
uninformed. He said there was no problem between Christians and Jews
but rather between the Vatican and the Polish Catholics, many of
whom wish the convent to remain at the Polish concentration camp.
   In 1987, the Polish government officially agreed to move the
convent, over objections by the nuns.
   Delegations of Jews and Catholics were to meet again in late
January to evaluate progress.

   A judge today dismissed charges against 13
civil rights leaders arrested during a protest of the city's housing
program after prosecutors reduced the charges and all 13 pleaded no
contest.
   The city prosecutor called the arrangement a compromise. An
attorney for the defendants said city officials agreed to meet with
them next month to try to resolve differences.
   The 13 were arrested for trying to block a City Council meeting
in June. They were protesting the firing of a black community
development official, the reassignment of another, the retirement of
a third and the resignation of a fourth because of alleged
mismanagement of the housing program.
   Jury selection in a trial for five of the 13 was scheduled to
resume today in Municipal Court, but Judge John Patterson dismissed
the jury pool and went into his chambers with defense attorneys and
prosecutors.
   ``While the case only involved a second-degree misdemeanor, there
were other important issues involved, but they were not a matter for
this court,'' Patterson said.
   Patterson had warned the defendants that he would not allow the
trial to be used as a forum on problems between the city
administration and blacks.
   The Revs. Issac Johnson, Rudolph May, Reece Barbour, Ronald
Barnett and John Reese each were charged with one count of
obstructing official business, a second-degree misdemeanor. The
charge carries a maximum sentence of three months in jail and a $750
fine.
   Under the agreement, the city reduced the charge to failure to
disperse. The ministers pleaded no contest; the judge dismissed the
case and ordered their records expunged.
   A trial for the eight other defendants was scheduled for next
month, but the charges of obstructing official business were dropped
under the agreement. In addition, two faced charges of resisting
arrest that also were dismissed.
   City Prosecutor John Madigan, who called the agreement a
compromise, said: ``Sometimes it takes a court trial to figure out
this isn't the way to go.''
   Jay B. Simmons, an attorney for the ministers, said the city
``extended a fair offer.'' City officials, he said, agreed to meet
with the ministers by the second week in January in an attempt to
resolve their differences.
   ``At this point, major differences have not been resolved. They
(city officials) must learn to consult with us before taking action
or they will continue to have problems,'' he said.
   The 13 ministers and civil rights leaders were arrested after
they refused to leave City Council chambers during a protest of the
city's handling of problems in its Community Development Department.
   The management shuffle in the department followed an
investigation by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development that said the city's housing rehabilitation program was
deficient.
   The civil rights leaders wanted to know why the men were
reprimanded without being consulted about problems in the
department. They also asked for a public hearing into the
allegations.
   City officials rejected their requests, sparking months of
protests by civil rights leaders, who claim there is a conspiracy
against black officials in Toledo.
   Racial tensions were heightened in July, when Police Chief Martin
Felker ordered police to randomly stop and question groups of black
teen-agers in an attempt to end racial violence in the city's Old
West End. Felker rescinded the order in August after protests.
   Blacks comprise about 17 percent of Toledo's 340,000 residents.

   Authorities in Czechoslovakia have freed
four political prisoners, including a Roman Catholic activist who
was detained in a psychiatric hospital after leading a petition
drive for religious freedom.
   A Vienna emigre source said authorities apparently gave the
activist, Augustin Navratil, permission to spend his 60th birthday
on Dec. 22 and Christmas at home because they feared a throng of
visitors at the hospital.
   Navratil, the author of a petition for religious freedom that
garnered about 600,000 signatures this year, was hospitalized in
Kromeriz on Oct. 28 because of alleged insanity.
   Swiss psychiatrists who examined him earlier this year declared
him sane.
   About 1,000 people demonstrated on his behalf earlier this month
and hundreds were expected to visit him in Kromeriz during the next
few days, the emigre source said. Navratil must return to Kromeriz
on Sunday.
   The source, who asked not to be identified, said Ivan Polansky, a
publisher of underground literature who was sentenced in June to
four years in jail, was released Dec. 15 for health reasons.
   Polansky, 52, suffers from a heart condition, the source said.
   His sentence was reduced to two years under an amnesty issued by
the authorities Oct. 28 to mark the 70th anniversary of Czechoslovak
independence, and was lifted completely after an appeal hearing in
Polansky's jail in central Slovakia this month, the source said.
   Meanwhile, authorities in Prague have released from detention one
of four independent peace activists arrested in October and under
investigation on charges of incitement.
   The emigre source said Lubomir Vydra had been released but
authorities are still investigating him on the incitement charge.
   Activist Jiri Tichy was released Dec. 18 but authorities are
continuing to press charges against him, another emigre source, the
publishing house Palach Press, reported later from London.
   Also today, Keston College, a center in London for monitoring
religious affairs in the Soviet bloc, said Roman Catholic priest
Frantisek Lizna had had his two-month jail sentence confirmed by an
appeals court in Brno.
   Lizna, who is banned by Czechoslovak authorities from preaching,
was sentenced Oct. 26 to two months in jail on charges of disrupting
public order. He is due to be released Monday.

<HEAD>Man Arraigned In Rapes In Areas Where Bodies Found Off Highways</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW BEDFORD, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An unemployed man pleaded innocent
today to all charges in two rapes that occurred in areas where the
bodies of six women were found along highways.
   Neil Anderson, 35, of New Bedford was indicted Tuesday by a
Bristol County grand jury. Anderson _ who has not been named as a
suspect in the murders _ was charged with aggravated rape,
kidnapping and assault with a dangerous weapon, a knife, in
connection with the Aug. 20, 1987, rape of a woman in nearby
Dartmouth. He also was charged with a July 22, 1988, rape in the
same town.
   Bristol County Superior Court Judge John Sheehan denied a request
to lower Anderson's $20,000 cash bail.
   Anderson's court-appointed attorney, James Quinn, argued that
bail should be reduced to $1,000 cash, saying his client was not a
serious risk.
   ``He has not what I would call a serious criminal record. He's
never been convicted of a crime requiring incarceration,'' Quinn
said. ``He has been unemployed since August and lives at home with
his elderly grandmother and his mother.''
   First Assistant District Attorney Raymond Veary argued against
lowering bail, saying that an investigation into a possible third
rape charge from a case in nearby Fall River was pending.
   After the hearing, Veary declined to say whether Anderson is a
suspect in the murders.
   ``He has been questioned. As to how extensively, I'm not willing
to comment,'' Veary said.
   Quinn said he believed Anderson has been unfairly linked to the
unsolved killings.
   ``As far as I know, the list of suspects is from the telephone
directory. I don't think that he's been singled out,'' Quinn said.
   Anderson declined to talk to reporters.
   The 1987 rape allegedly took place along Interstate 195 in
Dartmouth, the same general area of southeastern Massachusetts where
four of the six bodies were found. The victim was reportedly a
prostitute, but the Bristol County district attorney office has
declined to confirm the report.
   Anderson was arrested last week at his home, about a mile from
the Weld Square section of New Bedford, a neighborhood known for
drugs and prostitution that three of the four identified murder
victims were known to frequent.
   At Anderson's arraignment, prosecutors said the 1987 incident
involved the abduction of a woman from the Weld Square area. The
victim said she was driven to the wooded area and raped at
knifepoint.

<HEAD>President Of Vanuatu Arrested, Charged With Mutiny</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PORT VILA, Vanuatu (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President George Sokomanu was arrested
today and charged with inciting mutiny during his abortive attempt
to install an interim government in this South Pacific island nation.
   The Vanuatu Supreme Court refused to consider bail and ordered
him held in police custody until Jan. 4, his next court appearance.
If convicted, Sokomanu faces a maximum of ife imprisonment.
   Australian diplomats said they were monitoring developments
closely and praised the government of Prime Minister Walter Lini,
whom Sokomanu tried to oust, for its handling of the case.
   Sokomanu's appearance before Chief Justice Frederick Cooke
followed a brief hearing at the Port Vila Magistrate's court soon
after he was arrested during a police raid on his official residence
and office.
   The president also was charged with administering unlawful oaths
and being present when they were taken.
   Sokomanu, 56, became president in 1980 when Vanuatu, then known
as the New Hebrides, achieved independence from France and Britain.
He tried to form an interim government on Sunday headed by his
nephew Barak Sope in the hope of calling new elections in February.
   He said he took the action because of the failing economy and
outbreaks of violence during a year-long power struggle between Lini
and Sope.
   Earlier this week, the Vanuatu Supreme Court ruled the
president's action was unlawful and unconstitutional.
   Australian news reports said both the prosecution and defense
counsels suggested the possibility of house arrest, but Cooke said
the seriousness of the charges gave him no alternative but to deny
bail.
   Public Prosecuter John Baxter-Wright told the court the charge of
inciting mutiny related to the alleged drafting and distribution of
an open letter to Vanautu's police and paramilitary forces late on
Sunday after the president swore in Sope and four others as an
interim government.
   Baxter-Wright said the letter urged members of the security
forces to switch their loyalty from Lini to the Sope administration,
or risk losing their jobs. It also allegedly said military
intervention could be used in Vanuatu to disarm and dismantle the
police force and the Vanuatu Mobile Force.
   Baxter-Wright likened this to an act of treason.
   In his ruling Cooke said it was ``a sad day'' for him to have to
deal with a case against the president. The judge said the charges
were among the most serious possible in Vanautu. ``I cannot flinch
from doing my duty, otherwise I should not be here.''
   The rebel politicians also have been ordered held in police
custody for the next two weeks. The parliament on Tuesday moved to
dismiss Sokomanu as head of state, accusing him of gross misconduct.
   Vanuatu has a population of 130,000 and is 1,200 miles northeast
of Brisbane, Australia.

<HEAD>Study Says Diabetic Women Can Avoid Miscarriages</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: For release 6 p.m. EST</NOTE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pregnant women with diabetes can reduce their high
risk of miscarriages by keeping their blood sugar levels under
control, a study shows.
   The study tried to settle a long-running debate over whether
diabetes increases a woman's risk of miscarriage.
   It found that the higher the blood sugar level in diabetic women,
the higher the risk of miscarriage. However, women who keep their
sugar levels in the normal range have no higher risk of this than
women without diabetes.
   ``Diabetic women can be reassured that if they achieve reasonably
good metabolic control during pregnancy,'' the researchers wrote,
``their risk of spontaneous abortion is no higher than that among
non-diabetic women.''
   The study was based on a comparison of 386 pregnant women who
took insulin for diabetes and 432 without diabetes. Overall, 16
percent of the women in both groups had pregnancy losses. However,
blood sugar levels were higher in the diabetic women who had
miscarriages.
   The study was directed by Dr. James L. Mills of the National
Institute of Child Health and Human Development. It was published in
Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine.
   In an accompanying editorial, Dr. Donald R. Coustan of Brown
University said counseling diabetic women who want to have babies is
the single most important thing doctors can do to prevent
miscarriages and birth defects.
   ``Diabetic women must be made aware that the time to prevent
birth defects and spontaneous abortion is before conception, and
contraceptive advice should be offered so that every pregnancy can
be planned in advance,'' he wrote. ``Rarely do we encounter such a
simple and compelling opportunity to prevent human suffering.''

$100,000.
   Tommie Willard of Grand Forks contends Beatrice-Hunt-Wesson Inc.
was negligent in producing the bag of seeds. The complaint seeks
$50,000 each for Willard and his wife, Laura Kay.
   Originally, the complaint was filed in Grand Forks County
District Court, but lawyers for Beatrice this week requested the
lawsuit be transferred to U.S. District Court in Fargo.
   The complaint alleges Willard bit into the beetle Aug. 12 while
eating Fisher Salted in the Shell sunflower seeds. It contends
Willard suffered emotional, mental and physical trauma and
difficulty in sleeping as a result.
   Harlan Fuglesten, a lawyer for Beatrice, said Tuesday the company

<HEAD>Record-Breaking Cosmonauts Return to Earth After Year in Space</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANDREW KATELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two cosmonauts ended history's longest space flight
Wednesday after a year in orbit, returning to Earth three hours
later than planned because of a problem with an overloaded computer
chip, Soviet media said.
   Riding with record-setting cosmonauts Vladimir Titov and Musa
Manarov was Frenchman Jean-Loup Chretien, who has been in space less
than a month.
   Their Soyuz TM-6 capsule parachuted safely to Soviet Central Asia
at 12:57 p.m. Moscow time (4:57 a.m. EST). The Soviets had blasted
off at 2:18 p.m. on Dec. 21, 1987.
   Doctors met the cosmonauts at the landing site, and they were
flown to the Star City space training center north of Moscow, where
Titov and Manarov will undergo rehabilitation from the effects of
nearly a year in weightlessness, the official Tass news agency
reported.
   ``Immediate medical check-ups showed the cosmonauts are feeling
well,'' Radio Moscow said.
   The flight by Titov and Manarov lasted 365 days, 22 hours, and 39
minutes, breaking the 326-day endurance mark set by fellow Soviet
spaceman Yuri Romanenko in 1987. Titov and Manarov had replaced a
crew including Romanenko aboard the Mir.
   The U.S. mark for the longest manned mission is 84 days, set in
1973 by astronauts Gerald Carr, Edward Gibson and William Pogue
aboard the Skylab space station.
   The mission by Manarov and Titov gave the Soviets valuable
experience as they prepare for a three-year journey to Mars. Soviet
officials have said a manned mission to Mars will be launched around
the turn of the century.
   The foulup that delayed the Soyuz capsule's landing _ a computer
chip whose memory overloaded _ was the second major problem in the
Soviet manned space program this year. In September, equipment
malfunctions and crew error delayed the landing of a Soviet and an
Afghan spaceman as they ran dangerously low on food and air.
   ``It's nothing, boys. You flew for a year, so you can wait
another two orbits,'' flight director Valery Ryumin had told Titov
and Manarov after the first landing attempt was aborted. ``Let
Jean-Loup look at Paris from above one more time.''
   The problem began shortly after the Soyuz TM-6 separated from the
Mir orbiting complex, where Titov and Manarov spent most of their
time in space.
   An on-board computer that controls landing signaled that its
memory was overloaded, and automatically stopped preparations for
descent.
   ``The Mission Control Center decided to take a `time-out' to
figure out the situation,'' the newspaper Izvestia said.
   Tass said the computer's memory became overloaded because of new
software installed to prevent a repetition of the problems that
plagued the Afghan-Soviet mission.
   The problem was traced to ``the faulty interaction of some of the
new software with the old package of programs,'' Tass said,
paraphrasing deputy flight director Viktor Blagov.
   The new computer programs were designed to ensure smooth
operation of an infrared sensor that orients the capsule for its
return to Earth. On Sept. 7, veteran cosmonaut Vladimir Lyakhov and
Afghan space rookie Abdul Ahad Mohmand delayed their landing a full
day because the infrared sensor did not lock onto the proper target.
   After Wednesday's failure, the crew switched to a backup computer
program. The main engine fired to slow the capsule, and the living
quarters and instrument module were jettisoned, Tass said.
   Manarov, Titov and Chretien had been scheduled to land near
Arkalyk in Soviet Kazakhstan, but because of the delay the
trajectory was changed and they touched down about 110 miles
southeast of the Kazakhstan city of Dzhezkazgan, where the
temperature was 3 degrees Fahrenheit.
   Izvestia said Manarov, 37, and Titov, 40, exercised twice a day
aboard Mir to keep in shape and wore a special spacesuit that forced
blood to concentrate in the lower part of their bodies, simulating
the effects of gravity. They ran on a treadmill and rode an exercise
bicycle, according to flight medical director O.D. Anashkin.
   The strategy was ``not allowing the cosmonauts to become too
accustomed to weightlessness,'' Izvestia said.
   The vigorous exercise limited calcium loss common on long space
flights, but the cosmonauts' shins shrank 15 percent, Sovietskaya
Rossiya reported. In the days before their return to Earth's
gravity, Titov and Manarov took vitamin supplements to increase
blood circulation, the paper said.
   Chretien rocketed into space Nov. 26 along with cosmonauts
Alexander Volkov and Sergei Krikalev, who are still aboard Mir. Dr.
Valery Polyakov, who was sent to the space station in the fall to
monitor the health of Titov and Manarov, also remained behind.
   In a post-flight tradition, Soviet officials awarded Titov,
Manarov and Chretien medals for courage and heroism, Tass said.
   In Paris, Defense Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement praised
Chretien, who also took part in a 1982 space mission with the
Soviets.
   ``Your scientific and technical competence, your intellectual and
physical mastery, the endeavors you have undertaken and
accomplished, inspire in each of us the greatest respect,'' the
minister said.
   Tass had reported Titov and Manarov had completed one year in
orbit on Tuesday, but the news agency's editors said Wednesday they
had received incorrect information from Mission Control about the
length of the flight.

   Toyota Motor Corp., Japan's largest automaker, said
Wednesday it will begin exporting U.S.-made Toyota passenger cars to
Taiwan in January.
   The company will send 300 Camry sedans a month to Taiwan from the
Toyota plant in Georgetown, Ky., said a Toyota official.
   He said Toyota also will export 100 Corolla sedans a month to
Taiwan starting in March. The Corollas are made in Fremont, Calif.
by the New United Motor Manufacturing Inc., a Toyota joint venture
with General Motors Corp.
   Taiwan banned imports of passenger cars from Japan in 1974 to
reduce its trade deficit with Japan, which was $4.8 billion last
year.
   The Toyota official said the Georgetown plant produces 5,500 cars
a month and the Fremont plant 10,000 cars a month.

   A Colombian judge who said he was kidnapped, shot
at and threatened with death for prosecuting members of the
country's powerful drug cartels has been granted political asylum in
the United States after a three-year struggle.
   In a case that suggested that ``narcotraficantes,'' or drug
traffickers, are controlling Colombia's judicial system through
intimidation, the judge last month received asylum after maintaining
he would be killed if he returned.
   State Department officials said they could not recall another
case in which a judge from an American ally was granted political
asylum in the United States.
   ``Any judge that has come into contact with anything having to do
with drugs is in danger,'' the judge said in an interview granted on
condition that his name, his whereabouts and specifics about his
past not be disclosed. He now is working at unskilled jobs, in part
to keep his whereabouts a secret.
   In the last seven years, drug traffickers in the South American
nation have killed more than 50 judges, including a dozen Supreme
Court justices, as well as a justice minister, an attorney general,
several journalists and scores of police officers and soldiers.
   The reprisals against those who challenge the drug barons, led by
the infamous Medellin cartel believed responsible for most of the
cocaine brought into the United States, have hamstrung the justice
system, the judge said.
   Few drug cases are prosecuted, he said, and Colombia's Supreme
Court last year ruled that a 1979 extradition treaty with the United
States could no longer be applied. Many judges and lawyers have
resigned and fled.
   ``Two things could be happening. Either magistrates are too
afraid or they are being bought off,'' he said through a translator.
   ``There's no question but that the narcotraficantes have tried to
bring the judicial system to a halt over the years through
intimidation and assassination,'' said a State Department official,
speaking on condition of anonymity. ``Judges, newspapermen _ it's a
broad-spectrum campaign to try to step on anyone who tries to crank
the society against narcotics.''
   The judge _ who handled cases in various cities as a ``roving''
magistrate with power to investigate, prosecute and adjudicate
crimes _ said he was hounded and threatened from his first drug
prosecution in Medellin.
   He said he was shot at twice, received repeated telephone death
threats and was abducted by a terrorist group. At one point, he
received government protection but suspected his bodyguards had
connections to drug traffickers.
   According to documents from his asylum proceedings, the judge
contacted the U.S. consulate in Bogota, the Colombian capital, and
came to the United States in early 1986.
   The Immigration and Naturalization Service rejected his initial
application for political asylum under the 1980 Refugee Act because
he failed to demonstrate persecution based on politics, religion,
ethnicity, membership in a social group, nationality or race.
   But in deportation hearings, a U.S. immigration judge ruled that
the Colombian judge was in danger from two leftist guerrilla
movements _ including M-19 _ with ties to drug traffickers. M-19 has
been linked to a 1985 attack on the Palace of Justice in which more
than 100 people, including 11 Supreme Court justices, were killed.
   He also ruled that the judge was persecuted as a member of a
social group _ namely, judges who prosecute drug cases _ and granted
asylum.
   ``The government can't protect its own citizens from its own
people,'' said Fernando Colon, directing attorney of the Harvard Law
School Student Practice Clinic, who handled the case. ``What it says
is drug traffickers are in control.''
   ``At least this says this is a political issue and judges are
politically persecuted for abiding by the law,'' Colon said.
   The judge said he guards his identity for fear of Colombian drug
agents in this country.
   According to the State Department, several Colombian judges,
witnesses and their families who have been involved in drug cases
have been paroled into the United States, meaning they have special
admission that can be revoked at any time.
   But government officials said most of the thousands of cases of
refugees seeking asylum because of alleged threats to their safety,
many from Central American nations such as El Salvador, are denied.
   ``All these things are matters of evidence,'' the State
Department official said. ``Otherwise everybody who ever wanted to
short-circuit the normal immigration process would be able to get in
under political asylum claims.''

   A judge has barred attorneys in a malpractice
lawsuit from questioning a doctor they allege was a member of
Germany's Nazi party about his World War II activities.
   Cook County Circuit Judge Dean Sodaro ruled Tuesday that lawyers
for the plaintiff, Rahman Sheriff, may not ask Dr. Karl Siedentop,
69, about his activities before 1952.
   ``He (Sodaro) just didn't believe it was relevant to the case,''
said David Novoselsky, one of the attorneys for Sheriff.
   ``It's a reasoned ruling,'' said Neil Quinn, the attorney for
Siedentop. ``The judge made the right decision.''
   Last week, while Sodaro was on vacation, another judge issued a
gag order barring lawyers from talking about the case and sealed the
court record after Sheriff's chief lawyer, David De Jong, accused
Siedentop of being a Nazi.
   ``We've learned Dr. Siedentop joined the Hitler Youth movement in
1931 and joined the Nazi Party in 1939 and in his petition for
naturalization (as an American citizen) did not disclose he was a
Nazi,'' De Jong said before the gag order was imposed.
   De Jong said attorneys should be allowed to question Siedentop
about his past because the doctor's credibility was at issue in the
case.
   The lawsuit filed by Sheriff contends an experimental drug used
by Siedentop during an ear operation in November 1985 caused the
patient to have a series of strokes that left him virtually unable
to function.
   The lawsuit seeks damages ``in excess of $15,000,'' De Jong said.
   Under court rules, Sodaro's decision may not be appealed unless
the judge grants his permission, Novoselsky said.
   The judge Tuesday denied permission to appeal the ruling.

   Authorities in the republic of
Croatia are demanding the government lift a 15-year-old ban that has
kept foreigners away from two islands in the Adriatic Sea, an
official report said Wednesday.
   Vis and Lastovo, located on a militarily strategic route off the
Croatian coast, were declared off-limits when the navy started
fortifying them in the 1970s, the Tanjug news agency said.
   The ban has irked inhabitants, whose tourism trade suffered.
   The population of Vis, which was a base for Allied forces in
World War II, fell to about 4,500 people, or half the population
before the ban.
   Parliament last month proposed to grant the islands the status of
underdeveloped areas, which would entitle them to federal economic
assistance.

   Educator Louis Sullivan, a leading candidate to
head the Department of Health and Human Services, met today with
conservative Republican congressmen who said their concerns about
his views on abortion had been calmed.
   Minnesota Rep. Vin Weber said after the three-hour meeting at
Bush's transition office that Sullivan still appeared to be in line
for the post. The possibility of the nomination has been
controversial since Sullivan made comments in a newspaper interview
in favor of a woman's right to an abortion _ comments not in line
with President-elect Bush's stated views.
   ``He's not used to dealing with the press and he stumbled
badly,'' Weber told reporters. He said he was sure Sullivan could
win the support of anti-abortion groups.
   Bush was said by transition aides to be determined to move ahead
with the appointment, although no announcements were scheduled today.
   Bush advisers told Chicago transit official Samuel Skinner to
return home because announcement of his nomination as transportation
secretary was being delayed yet again while decisions on prospects
for other posts were being made.
   Sullivan met with Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch, Weber and New Jersey
Rep. Christopher H. Smith, all outspoken abortion opponents, as well
as transition co-directors Robert Teeter and Craig Fuller.
   Smith, a member of the congressional Pro Life Caucus, said that
he was favorably impressed by Sullivan.
   ``We do have a man here who has said, on the record, that he
believes life begins at conception, that the taking of a human life
is wrong. And he also made the point, significantly, that he
supports a human life amendement. That to the pro-life community is
the most significant issue,'' Smith said.
   The session was part of a damage control operation mounted by the
Bush team to salvage the nomination of the man who would be the
first black named to the incoming Bush Cabinet.
   Sullivan and Bush's top aides spent much of Tuesday in talks with
anti-abortion leaders, assuring them that the medical educator's
views were in line with those held by the president-elect.
   Bush opposes abortions except in cases of incest, or rape or when
the life of the mother would be endangered by a full-term pregnancy,
and he opposes federal funding for abortions.
   Sullivan was quoted in a newspaper interview several days ago as
saying he supports the right of a woman to seek an abortion _ a
position at odds with Bush's _ but opposes the use of federal funds
to pay for it.
   The article set off an instant protest by abortion foes, but
transition officials indicated on Tuesday night they thought the
nomination was back on track.
   Moreover, a transition source noted that Sullivan has strong
backing from Bush's wife, Barbara, a friend of Sullivan and a member
of the board of Morehouse College where he is medical school
president.
   Meanwhile, congressional sources said they had been told that
Texas Air executive Fred McClure would be the new administration's
chief lobbyist in Congress. McClure worked in the White House
liaison office earlier in the Reagan administration.
   Skinner, chairman of the Northeastern Illinois Mass Transit
Authority, was called to Washington last week for an expected
announcement that was then postponed by Bush. He returned to Chicago
for the weekend, then was summoned back on Monday, then told by
transition officials his appointment would come on Tuesday.
   Transition staffers were privately joking that Skinner's trips
back and forth were giving him loads of experience with problems in
the airline industry, plus paying a dividend of frequent-flyer
mileage.
   Amid the controversy over Sullivan, Bush canceled a planned
afternoon appearance for personnel announcements, avoiding questions
from reporters about the abortion dispute.
   Instead, he issued a written statement saying he was putting
former Nevada Sen. Paul Laxalt and former Ohio Rep. Thomas Ashley on
the National Economic Commission, a panel created by Congress to
find a bipartisan strategy for cutting the huge budget deficit.
   The appointments put the commission at its full strength of 14
people. Bush emphasized Tuesday his opposition to raising taxes to
erase the red ink.
   In another development, a Reagan administration source said
Patricia Diaz Dennis, a member of the Federal Communications
Commission, appeared to be emerging as the No. 1 contender for the
job of labor secretary.
   With a self-imposed Christmas deadline for naming his Cabinet,
Bush has filled eight seats and still has six to go. If he is
selected, Sullivan would be the first black in Bush's Cabinet.
   Bush has yet to name a woman to a Cabinet post, although he has
nominated Carla Hills to be chief trade negotiator, a job that
carries Cabinet rank.
   While Bush's aides insisted that Sullivan was still the top
candidate for health and human services, anti-abortion leaders
worked furiously to derail his expected nomination.
   Rep. Bob Dornan, R-Calif., said Bush ``will rue the day'' he
picks Sullivan. Gary Bauer, a conservative leader who was President
Reagan's domestic policy adviser, said the appointment of Sullivan
would be ``politically stupid'' because it would alienate a bloc of
voters that had supported Bush.
   One anti-abortion group, the Ad Hoc Committee in Defense of Life,
issued a statement saying Sullivan's appointment would be a ``slap
in the face.''
   Sullivan's congressional supporters on Tuesday were circulating a
letter in which he said, ``I am opposed to abortion except in cases
of rape, incest and where the life of the mother is threatened. ...
My position on abortion is entirely consistent with President-elect
Bush's position.''

<TEXT>
   A doctor who illegally placed a 2-day-old boy in
the home of Joel Steinberg, accused of murdering another illegally
adopted child, was sentenced Wednesday to 100 hours of community
service, fined $1,000 and put on probation for three years.
   Peter Sarosi, 35, pleaded guilty to ``unlawfully placing out a
child for adoption'' and was sentenced by Manhattan Criminal Court
Judge John Stackhouse, who could have jailed him for a year.
   Sarosi, an obstetrician and gynecologist, was arrested May 31.
Shortly afterward, he admitted that in June 1986 he arranged to have
a boy born to an unwed teen-ager placed with Steinberg and his
companion, Hedda Nussbaum.
   Police found the boy tied to a playpen and drinking spoiled milk
in Steinberg's apartment Nov. 2, 1987. They had gone there after an
emergency call to help an unconscious 6-year-old girl, Lisa
Steinberg, who died of head injuries three days later.
   Steinberg, a 47-year-old disbarred lawyer, was charged with
second-degree murder for allegedly beating Lisa to death. He denied
he hit her, but Ms. Nussbaum has testified at his trial that he told
her he ``knocked Lisa down and she didn't want to get up.''
   The boy, called Mitchell by Steinberg, was returned to his
biological mother, Nicole Smigiel, and was renamed Travis Christian
Smigiel.
   Graceann Smigiel, Nicole's mother, called the sentence
``ridiculous.''
   ``They should put him in a cell with Joel so they can renew their
friendship,'' Mrs. Smigiel said.
   Stackhouse noted in his decision that the court received two
probation reports on Sarosi. One recommended jail time and the other
suggested a sentence split between jail and probation, even though
both reports predicted that Sarosi was unlikely to be involved in
crime again.
   Paul Schechtman, counsel to Manhattan District Attorney Robert
Morgenthau, said his office had agreed to take no position on
Sarosi's sentencing. But he indicated later that prosecutors were
unhappy when Sarosi, Ms. Nussbaum's physician and a friend and
client of Steinberg's, refused to cooperate in Steinberg's
prosecution.

   Pakistan has no plans to make nuclear
weapons but won't sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty unless
India does, Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto said.
   Negotiations are under way with India on an agreement not to
attack each other's nuclear facilities, she said. The two countries
have fought three wars since independence in 1947. India has tested
nuclear explosives, and Pakistan is believed capable of producing
them.
   Ending corruption and tax evasion and increasing foreign
investment are domestic priorities, the first woman to lead a Moslem
nation in modern times said in an interview Sunday night. She spoke
while traveling to her home in Rawalpindi from Islamabad where she
attended a parliamentary committee meeting.
   In West Germany, a prosecutor said today that two companies in
that country are being investigated in connection with the suspected
illegal sale to Pakistan of material that can be used in the
production of atomic weapons.
   The prosecutor also said officials have evidence that atomic
reactor equipment was illegally sold to Pakistan, India and South
Africa.
   The prosecutor, Albert Farwick, said the companies' officials
have admitted delivering technical equipment to Pakistan as recently
as the summer.
   ``We know that they delivered equipment for processing tritium
and that they delivered tritium gas,'' he said. Atomic experts say
tritium gas is used to boost the effectiveness of atomic weapons.
   Until Ms. Bhutto's populist Pakistan People's Party won the
election last month, Pakistanis had been unable to choose their
government since 1977.
   The 1977 election kept Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, her
father, in power by a landslide. Gen. Mohammed Zia ul-Haq overthrew
him soon afterward. Bhutto was convicted in a murder conspiracy and
hanged in 1979.
   Zia, a staunch U.S. ally, died in a plane crash Aug. 17, after
setting the election date. After winning that election, Ms. Bhutto
said she will continue good relations with Washington.
   On Dec. 29, Ms. Bhutto and Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi of India
will meet at a summit in Islamabad of the South Asian Association
for Regional Cooperation. ``We have certain talks going on with
India whereby an agreement can be brought up on non-attack on each
other's nuclear facilities,'' she said.
   Pakistan will not sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, thus
opening its nuclear facilities to inspection, unless India also
accepts the document, she said. Some of Pakistan's facilities are
believed to be producing weapons-grade enriched uranium,
particularly the Kahuta uranium enrichment plant 20 miles east of
Islamabad.
   Ms. Bhutto said Pakistan does not have ``a nuclear device ... has
no intention of making a nuclear device, and that's what I can tell
you categorically.''
   India rejected several previous Pakistani offers of comprehensive
nuclear agreements, but Ms. Bhutto said the situation is changing.
``I think we're looking toward, in general, an expression worldwide
of a yearning for a rest,'' she said. ``Pakistan and India are both
a part of the world. The people of both our countries would prefer
to have an honorable peace.''
   Serious economic problems beset Pakistan, including a $12.5
billion foreign debt and hard terms from the International Monetary
Fund for help in reducing it, low foreign exchange reserves and
rampant tax evasion.
   ``At the moment we want to ... concentrate on economic growth,''
Ms. Bhutto said. ``We'd like to get (other countries) interested in
our economic growth.''
   The IMF agreement provides $1 billion of new money over three
years but requires austerity measures to reduce the foreign debt.
   Military spending takes 39 percent of the budget and Ms. Bhutto
has promised no defense cuts, so options are limited.
   IMF loans will help pay immediate bills and the government will
try to renegotiate terms of the other debt, said V.A. Jafarey, the
prime minister's financial adviser.

   The Reagan administration said today it will
pay up to $500,000 for information that leads to the ``prevention,
frustration or favorable resolution'' of terrorist acts against U.S.
persons or property overseas.
   The program represents an expansion of a plan in effect since
1984 under which rewards have been offered for information leading
to the arrest and conviction of the perpetrators of specific
terrorist acts.
   Rewards have been offered for six such incidents but no payments
have been made.
   State Department deputy spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said the
department is distributing posters advertising the program. The
posters are printed in English, French, German, Spanish and Arabic
and will be sent to all U.S. diplomatic posts overseas.
   Persons with terrorism information should notify the nearest U.S.
embassy or consulate, Ms. Oakley said. Information received will be
handled confidentially and the identities of informants will be
protected.

   President Reagan, who will meet on Thursday
with the man he recognizes as president of Panama, said today he
does not know if there will be a change in the Panamanian government
before he leaves office although ``it would be nice.''
   The White House said Eric Arturo Delvalle, recognized by the
United States as the Panamanian president, was flying to Washington
for meetings with Reagan, President-elect Bush and Secretary of
State George Shultz.
   Deputy White House Press Secretary Roman Popadiuk said Delvalle
was to meet with Reagan and Bush on Thursday. He was to arrive later
today for a meeting with Shultz.
   Popadiuk said the meeting at the White House was designed ``to
show visibly the U.S. support for the Delvalle government and for
the people of Panama.'' Delvalle has been living in hiding in Panama
since he was ousted by supporters of military strongman Manuel
Antonio Noriega and replaced by Manuel Solis Palma in February.
   Reagan, asked by a reporter if he foresaw any change in the
Noriega government before his term ends Jan. 20, said, ``I don't
have an answer to that. There is only a limited time left, and it's
quite a problem as you all know, so I don't know. It would be nice
if it could happen.''
   Asked if anything could push Noriega out, Reagan grinned at Bush,
who was sitting across the table from him at a Cabinet meeting, and
joked, ``You said Bush Noriega out?''
   When he was asked what the United States would do to help
Panamanians facing confiscation of their property by the Noriega
regime, the president replied, ``All I can tell you is that we
continue to be involved in that problem and to try to find answers
for the things that are happening. and I can't go beyond that.''
   Popadiuk said he did not know who initiated Thursday's meeting.
   The spokesman was asked about reports that Panamanians working
for United States companies in Panama were disgruntled over U.S.
economic sanctions designed to end the Noriega regime.
   ``We regret any hardship imposed on these long-term loyal
employes,'' he said. ``Noriega's actions demonstrate the great
lengths he is willing to go to find money to shore up his illegal
regime.''
   ``The United States sanctions remain in place,'' Popadiuk said.
``They were undertaken in response to the call by the Delvalle
government for economic pressure against Noriega. The sanctions will
remain in place until the Panamanian people enjoy the full benefits
of democracy.''
   ``Panama's economic problems preceded the economic sanctions,''
he said. ``The Panamanian economy was already deteriorating due to
the Noriega regime's policies.''
   When asked whether Delvalle was considering resigning, Popadiuk
said, ``That is not my understanding of it. We support his efforts
to achieve democracy in Panama, and those efforts will be
continuing.''
   ``We expect President Delvalle to come to the White House some
time tomorrow, and we expect that he will have a brief meeting with
the president,'' he said.
   He said the meeting would probably take place during the
president's regular morning briefing by his national security
adviser, Lt. Gen. Colin L. Powell, and Bush would attend.
   He said that as far as he knew it would be the first meeting
between Reagan and Delvalle.
   Popadiuk declined to ``characterize efforts that we may or may
not be undertaking'' to bring about Noriega's ouster but asserted
that ``our policy remains intact and that policy will continue.''
   The sanctions were modified on June 15 to authorize payment of
taxes and fees for health, maternity and retirement benefits for
Panamanians employed by U.S. companies and U.S.-controlled
Panamanian companies.
   On Aug. 24, another amendment authorized payment of import duties
and port fees to facilitate U.S. exports to Panama.
   Popadiuk said he did not foresee any further exceptions.
   He said that as far as he was aware Delvalle was not bringing any
new proposals.
   The U.S. sanctions have been in effect since February.
   Noriega has been indicted on drug trafficking charges by two
federal grand juries in Florida.

   A prosecutor said today that authorities have
dropped an investigation of two suspects in the 1986 bombing of
nightclub that killed two U.S. soldiers and led to an American
retaliatory strike against Libya.
   The U.S. soldiers were among three people killed and more than
200 injured in the April 5, 1986 attack at the La Belle discotheque,
a popular haunt of American soldiers in West Berlin.A Turkish woman
also was killed.
   Detlev Achamer, West Berlin Justice Ministry spokesman, said the
investigation of Christiane Endrigkeit and Ahmed Nawaf Hasi was
dropped because of lack of evidence. ``The participation of the
suspects in the bombing could not be determined with sufficient
certainty,'' Achamer said.
   At the time of ther arrests, Endrigkeit, 28, and Hasi, 38, were
considered prime suspects in the bombing.
   The United States charged that Libya was behind the attack. Ten
days afterward, U.S. warplanes bombed Tripoli and Benghazi in Libya
in a retaliatory raid Western diplomats say killed 100 people.
   Prosecutors originally said they suspected Endrigkeit and an
accomplice had planted the bomb at the disco for Hasi. Hasi, a
Palestinian, is serving a 14-year sentence for another terrorist
attack in West Berlin.
   Achamer said the investigation showed that Endrigkeit was in the
vicinity of where the bomb was planted shortly before it went off.
But he said authorities could not establish conclusive links betwen
her and Hasi.
   Achamer said he did not know if Endrigkeit would be freed soon.
Court records indicate she faces other, unrelated charges.
   Achamer said police suspected Hasi because the explosives used in
the La Belle attack were similar to those he used to bomb the
German-Arab Friendship Society in West Berlin in 1985 and in a
failed attack against an Israeli jetliner in London in 1986.
   Hasi's brother was convicted in the London incident.
   Some West German authorities had raised the possibility that
Syria had been behind the attack at La Belle.

   North Korea on Wednesday urged South
Korea to hold talks on sending a team made up of athletes from both
countries to the 1990 Asian Games in Beijing.
   The proposal came a day after North Korea called for talks with
the South and the United States on ending confrontation on the
divided Korean peninsula.
   Kim Jong-ha, the president of the South Korean Olympic Committee,
said the proposal was outlined in a letter Wednesday from his North
Korean counterpart, Kim Yu Sun.
   North Korea called for talks in the truce village of Panmunjom in
February to discuss forming a joint team for the Asian Games,
scheduled for September 1990.
   ``The people of North Korea ardently want to see both Koreas
participate together as a single team in the games, which are
intended to promote peace and goodwill among various Asian
peoples,'' the letter said.
   South Korean officials said they were studying the proposal and
had no immediate response, but indicated they had favored such ideas
in the past.
   The two Koreas are bitter foes, with hundreds of thousands of
troops stationed along their border.
   North Korea boycotted the 1988 Olympics in Seoul because its
demand to be a co-host was rejected. The communist nation also
boycotted the 1986 Asian Games in Seoul on the grounds that Seoul
refused to form a joint team.
   Talks on clearing the way for joint parliamentary sessions to
negotiate a non-aggression pact are to resume Dec. 29.
   U.S. and Soviet forces divided the Korean peninsula when they
ended the Japanese occupation at the end of World War II in 1945.
The North invaded the south in 1950, beginning the three-year Korean
War.
   The United States, which supported the South, has about 42,000
troops stationed in the country under a mutual defense treaty. North
Korea is seeking the withdrawal of U.S. forces as part of its
proposals.

<HEAD>596 Contractors Barred From Pentagon Business</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A record 596 firms were barred in fiscal 1988
from doing business with the military, and more than 4,000 people,
most in uniform, were convicted of contracting misdeeds in just the
last half of the year, according to the Pentagon's inspector general.
   The semiannual report, ordered by Congress, suggests the Defense
Department's auditors are becoming increasing effective at rooting
out waste, fraud and mismanagement, saving billions in tax dollars.
But it also indicates that industry wrongdoing remains a pervasive,
boggling problem.
   Inspector General June Gibbs Brown, said the fiscal year saw
``improved performance in every category'' by auditors and
investigators.
   In the last half of the year, according to the report:
   _Pentagon and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers auditors saved the
government an estimated $6.6 billion by challenging contracts or
plans. Overall, in 35,000 new reports, they initiated challenges of
$12.7 billion in contract costs, but many of those disputes won't be
resolved until later.
   _An additional $913 million was saved through follow-up
investigations of previous cases where managers had balked at
auditors' recommendations.
   _Investigations led to the recovery of $195.6 million in
overcharges, plus $50.5 million in fines and penalties and $64.2
million in civil settlements and judgments.
   _Nearly 3,400 people were indicted, including 464 by the Justice
Department on the Pentagon's behalf, 236 by local, state or foreign
authorities and 2,664, via recommendations for courts-martial,
within the military. There were 4,014 convictions, counting cases
where charges were lodged earlier, and 3,294 were through
courts-martial.
   Also during the six-month period, the Pentagon stripped a record
312 contractors of their opportunity to bid for defense work. The
terms of such debarments, though set on a case-by-case basis,
typically last a minimum of three years. Coupled with the 284
debarments in the first half of the year, the 1988 total of 596 is
the most since the independent inspector general's post was
established in 1983.
   In addition, the bidding rights of another 259 contractors were
suspended temporarily in the last half of the year.
   Among the more significant actions cited during the period were
the conviction of former Rep. Mario Biaggi, D-N.Y., in the Wedtech
contract and bribery scandal; a mischarging case involving Todd
Pacific Shipyards that resulted in a $5 million recovery, and
defective pricing cases against the McDonnell Douglas Electronics
Co. and the Ford Aerospace Corp. that resulted in settlements of
$3.6 million and $7 million, respectively.
   The report also noted a defective pricing and theft case
involving the Aero Corp. that ended with fines and restitution
totaling $473,740 and the recovery of property worth $2.5 million.
   The Pentagon's Fraud Hotline, meantime, fielded 5,381 reports
during the period, about the same as during the first half of the
year. Of the total received, 2,118 were judged to be ``substantive
complaints'' and were referred for investigation or other follow-up
action, an increase over the first six months, the report states.
   The inspector general by law maintains a staff of auditors and
investigators who operate independently, outside the control of top
Pentagon executives. The latest report is dated Nov. 29 but was not
released until Wednesday.

   A Vietnam veteran who is director of the American
Legion's National Economic Commission was named Wednesday to
administer a $52 million social service fund created by the
settlement of the Agent Orange litigation.
   Dennis Rhoades, 44, was named executive director of the Agent
Orange Class Assistance Program by U.S. District Judge Jack B.
Weinstein, who has presided over the Agent Orange class-action
lawsuit.
   The $52 million will be distributed in grants to social service
organizations that help Vietnam veterans and their families,
including children with birth defects.
   It is part of a $240 million settlement of the lawsuit brought by
veterans exposed to the defoliant during the Vietnam War against the
chemical's makers. A portion of the settlement, $170 million, has
been allocated to the Agent Orange Veteran Payment Program, which
will provide cash payments to totally disabled Vietnam veterans and
to the wives or children of veterans who died.
   Agent Orange was sprayed over Southeast Asia during the 1960s by
the U.S. military, which hoped to deprive communist troops of crops
and cover.
   The herbicide contains the highly toxic dioxin, and veterans
contended exposure to Agent Orange caused cancer and other illnesses.
   Rhoades served in Vietnam in the Army for 15 months in 1968 and
1969. He later worked for many years on veterans issues in
government agencies including the Department of Labor, the Veterans
Administration and the White House.
   He also was executive director of the Vietnam Veterans of America
before he took his current job at the American Legion.
   Weinstein said he expects the $52 million, plus interest, to be
distributed within seven to 10 years.
   To date, the court has received more than 140 proposals from
social service organizations, which will serve as a starting point
for the program's allocation process, Weinstein said.

   Prince Charles will make a private visit to the
United States in late February but is expected to carry out some
official engagements, Buckingham Palace said Wednesday.
   The prince's itinerary includes stops in New York and Washington,
but the palace said no dates or details were available.
   The 40-year-old heir to the British throne will be traveling
alone, the palace said. His wife, Diana, will remain in Britain with
their sons, Prince William, 6, and Prince Harry, 4.
   Shortly after he returns to London, Charles will be off again for
a skiing vacation at the Swiss resort of Klosters, the palace said.
   Last March, an avalanche hit the prince's skiing party at
Klosters, killing his close friend, Maj. Hugh Lindsay, 36, and
seriously injuring another friend, Patty Palmer-Tompkinson, who
continues to walk on crutches.
   Diana will skip the Klosters trip as well, the palace said, but
she will join Charles for an official tour of Kuwait and the United
Arab Emirates from March 12-17.

   Comedian Bob Hope singled out his favorite targets
_ U.S. presidents _ as he warmed up the audience at a 1940s-era,
USO-style show that raised $101,000 for a Colorado veterans memorial.
   ``Ronald Reagan wears a hearing aid,'' deadpanned Hope. ``He
wears it in his right ear because he doesn't want to hear from the
Left.''
   Then there was former President Gerald Ford, ``the most thrilling
golfer I've ever played with. We have 73 golf courses in Palm
Desert. He doessn't know which one he'll be playing until after his
tee shot,'' quipped Hope.
   Hope, 85, was joined onstage Tuesday night at a Lowry Air Force
Base hangar by his wife, Dolores, who sang ``I'm Dreaming of a White
Christmas.''
   About 500 people paid $250 for the dinner and show. The rest _
military personnel and veterans _ paid $25 for just the show.
   ``I saw Bob Hope in 1952 in Korea,'' said Air Force Senior Master
Sgt. George Erickson. ``It's a memory to see him again.''
   The show, held in lieu of Hope's traditional holiday tour of
armed forces bases, was designed to honor Colorado's war veterans.

   A city councilman accused the state of
``pandering to the weird obsession'' of an ``obscenely rich woman''
by allowing tobacco heiress Doris Duke to keep pet camels at her
estate.
   ``I am outraged by the special treatment accorded this wealthy
family,'' Councilman Neil Abercrombie said in a letter Tuesday to
John Whalen, the director of the city Department of Land Utilization.
   Last week, the state Board of Agriculture unanimously agreed to
allow Duke, 75, and her adopted daughter, Charlene Gail ``Chandi''
Heffner, 35, bring pet camels from New Jersey to Hawaii for the
winter. The two-hump camels would live at Duke's ocean-front estate.
   The camels would not be subject to the 120-day state quarantine
for household pets but would be treated as cattle, allowing Duke to
keep them under a 65-day ``provisional'' quarantine, officials said.
   Abercrombie said he was especially angry because as a state
legislator he had lobbied to have guide dogs for the blind be exempt
from Hawaii's quarantine laws, but the agriculture board rejected
that.
   ``Something like that they fight, but now they're pandering to
the weird obsession of this obscenely rich woman,'' he said.
   Whalen said he would look into Abercrombie's complaints.
   Ronald Leong, Duke's attorney, said he was not familiar with
Abercrombie's letter.

   Mayor Raymond L. Flynn rushed to douse a burning
car with a fire extinguisher and helped direct traffic when
firefighters arrived.
   Flynn and his wife, Catherine, were leaving the Globe Corner
Bookstore, where they had made a donation to The Boston Globe Santa
Fund, when the car caught fire Tuesday.
   Grabbing a fire extinguisher from a merchant, Flynn sprayed the
car until the extinguisher was empty, then directed traffic to the
side of the street to make room for the fire trucks.
   ``Where did he come from?'' asked Sarah Weatherwax, who sells
items from a cart across the street. ``He always seems to show up at
these things.''
   ``People may think I did this for publicity,'' Flynn said later,
denying the assertion.
   Last year, Flynn rescued a handicapped person from a burning
building and intervened in a hostage crisis. And his wife said she
once saw him pull three people from a burning car.

   Iceland expanded its ambassadorial
corps by 5 percent and insured a higher public profile for its
diplomacy by declaring Miss World Linda Petursdottir its
``ambassador extraordinaire.''
   Miss Petursdottir, 18, who won the title in November, was given
the additional honor Tuesday by Foreign Minister Jon Hannibalsson,
along with a red diplomatic passport.
   Iceland has just 21 ambassadors, counting Miss Petursdottir, and
10 of them work in Iceland at the Foreign Ministry.
   The new ambassador, however, should be doing some traveling. The
nation's major airline, Flugleider, presented her with a year's pass
for first-class travel.
   After the ceremony in the capital, Miss Petursdottir flew to her
home village of Vopnafjordur, a fishing town of 600 residents, where
she will spend the holidays.

<HEAD>State Supreme Court Upholds Hendricks' Murder Convictions</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Illinois Supreme Court on Wednesday
upheld the murder convictions of David Hendricks, a former back
brace salesman sentenced to life in prison for the ax and knife
slayings of his wife and three children.
   Hendricks' parents said they have private investigators working
on the case to find the ``real killer.''
   ``We're going to continue to do all in our power to prove David's
innocence,'' said Hendricks' father, Charles Hendricks, of
Allendale. ``We know he's innocent.''
   In a 4-2 decision, the Supreme Court rejected Hendricks'
arguments that he was wrongly convicted in 1984 because jurors were
prejudiced by testimony about his membership in a fundamentalist
Christian religion and sexual promiscuity.
   Justice William Clark issued a strong dissent, asserting the
testimony should not have been allowed and a new trial should have
been ordered. ``The case against Hendricks was circumstantial; no
direct evidence linked the defendant in any way to the crime,''
Clark wrote.
   Justice Joseph Cunningham, writing for the majority, said,
however, the admission of evidence about Hendricks' character or
likelihood to commit illegal or immoral acts was proper, to
establish a motive.
   Cunningham added that testimony about Hendricks' membership in
the Plymouth Brethren religious group strengthened the evidence
against him, implying he had a motive to murder his family because
divorce was not easily acceptable to his religion.
   Hendricks, 34, was convicted in November 1984 after a 10-week
trial that included gruesome testimony about the killings of his
wife, Susan, 30, and their children _ Rebekah, 9, Grace, 7, and
Benjamin, 5, in their Bloomington home.
   Hendricks' trial, moved to Rockford because of media coverage in
the Bloomington-Normal area, included two night sessions, held so
jurors could not watch ``Fatal Vision,'' a television movie about a
similar case.
   Much of the trial testimony centered on Hendricks' alleged sexual
advances toward models he hired for advertising brochures for his
braces. Some models testified that Hendricks asked them to disrobe
unnecessarily, fondled them and made other advances.
   The prosecution contended Hendricks' real target was his wife,
and that he killed his children and tried to create the appearance
of a burglary to conceal his role in the crime.
   Presiding Judge Richard Baner declined to impose a death
sentence, saying he wasn't convinced Hendricks had been proved
guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.
   The Supreme Court ruling came just a day after Hendricks married
Pat Miller at the Menard Correctional Center. The new Mrs.
Hendricks, 37, of Toledo, Ohio, said she met her husband last year
through the mother of another prisoner.
   Among those at the wedding was Susan Hendricks' mother, Nadine
Palmer, 55, of Delavan, who also believes in Hendricks' innocence.
   ``We'll do whatever we can to work on his release and show his
innocence,'' she said, after hearing of the high court's decision.
``The whole thing is a travesty of the justice system.''

<HEAD>Health Contractor Seen As Pentagon Reformer Has Its Own Problems</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The firm selected by the Pentagon to
demonstrate a model for overhauling the military's troubled health
insurance system is itself having problems and is in danger of
seeing its contract canceled, officials say.
   The Foundation Health Corp. of Sacramento, Calif., has received
two formal ``deficiency and cure notices'' _ the most recent dated
Dec. 13 _ and been given a deadline of Jan. 3 to convince the
Pentagon it can correct its problems, officials say.
   Defense Department health officials say they remain hopeful the
program can be salvaged. They express frustration because the
contractor's difficulties can be traced ``to plain old claims
processing and not to the innovative changes we made.''
   ``The contractor is having trouble processing the claims of
doctors and health professionals on a timely basis,'' adds David
Newhall, the Pentagon's principal deputy assistant secretary for
health affairs.
   Phone calls to Dr. James Schubert, the head of Foundation, were
not returned on either Tuesday or Wednesday.
   Newhall said ``The innovative changes appear to be working. We're
seeing strong doctor acceptance, strong beneficiary acceptance and
early evidence that we can save money. But we've got to correct this
other problem.''
   The award of the health contract to Foundation was announced with
great ballyhoo last January, both because of its potential size and
the sweeping nature of its terms.
   The contract was described as being worth up to $3 billion over
the next five years, and as representing the best hope yet of
reforming CHAMPUS _ the Civilian Health And Medical Program of the
Uniformed Services.
   CHAMPUS is an insurance plan that covers military dependents and
retirees when they turn to the civilian sector for care, either
because they want to use a private physician or because space is not
available in military hospitals.
   The cost of CHAMPUS has been skyrocketing in recent years and now
approaches $2.5 billion a year. To rein in those costs, the Pentagon
asked Foundation to set up a demonstration project in California and
Hawaii to prove that dependents and retirees would take advantage of
a Health Maintenance Organization, or HMO, if it were available.
   There are roughly 125,000 military dependents and retirees living
in the two states who use CHAMPUS each year. In return for agreeing
to use the doctors and hospitals specified by Foundation, those
retirees and dependents are being offered additional medical
services at lower cost.
   At the same time, the Defense Department expects to save millions
because Foundation has signed fixed-price contracts for the delivery
of care with groups of doctors, instead of continuing to pay
whatever bills are submitted by private doctors.
   Newhall says there has been much interest in the new program.
   ``CHAMPUS Prime enrollment exceeds expectations by 50 percent;
there are over 18,000 enrollees and growing,'' he says.
   ``Unfortunately, however, about 40 percent of the total claims
from providers are more than a month old. And when your doctors
don't get paid on time, you have a problem.''
   According to the latest ``cure notice,'' the Pentagon views the
company's ``lack of responsiveness ... (as) an extremely grave
situation for the government.''
   ``In other words, you have not provided the government concrete
or adequate evidence that you can deliver a technical solution to
correcting your contract deficiencies ... we believe it is
imperative that real, measureable and verifiable progress be made ...
   ``This simply means that the existing claims backlog must be
reduced and processing improved. Your failure to adequately respond
to this letter by Jan. 3, 1989, could result in the termination of
this contract for default.''
   ``It is fair to say we think the contractor understands the
seriousness of the Pentagon's stance,'' Newhall said.
   ``And the contractor appears to be moving in directions that
suggest the possibility of a continuing relationship, although that
is still by no means certain.''
   Newhall declined to speculate on what the Pentagon would do if it
ended up canceling Foundation's contract.
   ``Every attempt would be made, given the substantial successes in
all areas except claims processing, to protect the reform
initiative,'' he said. ``But it's still unclear exactly how the
department would proceed.''

   Israeli troops shot and wounded at least seven
Palestinians on Wednesday during a strike by residents of the
occupied territories demanding more support from their Israeli Arab
brethren.
   The Roman Catholic Patriarch in Jerusalem called for nine days of
prayer and fasting this Christmas in solidarity with those suffering
in the year-old Palestinian uprising.
   In the West Bank, a 20-year-old Palestinian died of a gunshot
wound in the chest suffered during bitter clashes with troops in the
city of Nablus last Friday, doctors said.
   Abdul Rahman Kadura was the sixth victim of the confrontations
Friday and the 333rd Palestinian to die since the Arab uprising
began. Thirteen Israelis also have been killed.
   Three Palestinians were wounded in the village of Tubas, near
Nablus, when soldiers opened fire after they were met with a barrage
of stones and bottles upon entering the village, Arab reporters said.
   A military spokeswoman confirmed the three woundings, and said
four other Palestinian stone-throwers were shot and wounded in three
other West Bank villages.
   Arab doctors said an 18-year-old Palestinian was in serious
condition at Ahli Arab Hospital in Gaza City after he was shot in
the stomach in a clash in Nusseirat refugee camp. The report could
not immediately be confirmed by the army.
   The Christmas statement issued by Michel Sabbah, the first Arab
named as Roman Catholic patriarch of Jerusalem, spoke of ``prisons
full of suffering men, lack of peace and the entrenchment of
violence and hatred.''
   In a reference to the occupied West Bank, Sabbah noted that the
problems were occurring in the area where Christ was born. He urged
Catholics ``to accompany these sufferings with our prayers and to
focus our attention on the current situation and the political
problem itself.''
   It was the strongest public statement on the uprising by Sabbah,
who was appointed by Pope John Paul II in December.
   Sabbah is responsible for some 110,000 Roman Catholics in Israel,
the occupied territories, Jordan and Cyprus.
   Wednesday's general strike, the third this week, was called by
the pro-PLO Unified National Leadership of the Uprising to urge
Arabs living within Israel to show greater support for the revolt in
the territories.
   ``We call on them to declare a day of Palestinian peace like that
of last year,'' said a leaflet signed by the underground leadership.
On Dec. 21, 1987, thousands of Israeli Arabs demonstrated in support
of the revolt in the territories.
   Underground leaders also have called for strikes on Christmas Eve
and on the Orthodox Feast of the Epiphany Jan. 6 to oppose Israel's
continued occupation.
   Israel authorities, meanwhile, were going ahead with plans for
normal Christmas celebrations in Bethlehem despite calls by
Palestinian leaders in the city for a quiet Christmas in respect for
the uprising.
   A hotelkeeper, Michel Kratim, said that only one-third of the 120
beds in his Star Hotel were booked for Christmas this year. He said
some of Bethlehem's nine hotels and guest houses have no bookings at
all for the holidays.
   Also Wednesday, four Israeli soldiers including a woman were
sentenced to jail terms of up to nine months for beating
Palestinians at the Dhahiriya detention camp in the occupied West
Bank, the army said.
   The indictment against the four listed 22 beating incidents at
Dhahiriya in March.

<HEAD>Aquarium Officials Trying to Save Stranded Newborn Whale</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Veterinarians at the New York Aquarium said
Wednesday that a baby female pilot whale found stranded in shallow
water near a marina has little chance of surviving.
   Aquarium spokesman Rick Miller said the animal _ which may be as
young as 2 weeks _ was under constant care and being fed a rich
mixture of infant formula, heavy cream, cottage cheese and vitamins.
   He said aquarium officials knew of no baby long-finned pilot
whale surviving after being separated from its mother. The mammals
often nurse for 14 to 16 months, meaning veterinarians must force
feed the young whale through a tube.
   ``In this case, the newborn whale is showing signs of pneumonia
and weight loss,'' said aquarium director Louis Garibaldi.
   Should the whale survive and recover, Miller said, experts would
try to return it to the ocean.
   The young animal was found Tuesday morning stranded in shallow
water at the Barren Island Marina in Marine Park in Brooklyn, about
a mile from the open ocean.
   Marina owner Ted Sunday, who waded into the knee-deep cold water
to help the whale, said, ``It was making a very, very sad sound like
a weeping, like a whining sound. That's what prodded me to stay in
the water a little longer.''
   Sunday said he urged the whale into slightly deeper water and
stayed with it until an aquarium crew arrived.
   Whale experts at the aquarium had no way of knowing what happened
to the whale's mother, but speculated she may have rejected her
offspring or perhaps gotten sick and died. It was also possible the
baby whale had become ill and was unable to keep up with other
whales.
   Pilot whales are common along the East Coast and range as far
north as Greenland and south to North Carolina, Miller said. The
young whale found Tuesday was about 6 feet long, but fully grown
females grow to as much as 20 feet. A fully grown male may reach 28
feet in length, Miller said.

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Ranasinghe Premadasa,
facing two rebellions at home and an uneasy relationship with
regional superpower India, will be an embattled president from the
moment he takes office on Jan. 2.
   Opposition accusations that he won the presidency by fraud could
make his task to reunify a nation split by deep political and ethnic
rivalries even more difficult.
   If the opposition gets its way, the election will be nullified.
   Former Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike, who won 44.9 percent
of the vote, compared with 50.4 percent for Premadasa, claimed she
was denied the presidency by government fraud.
   ``I would have been the winner if it would have been done fair,''
she said, adding that her party would challenge the results in the
Supreme Court.
   But Premadasa's main task will be to end the ethnic bloodshed
that has killed nearly 10,000 people on this tropical Indian Ocean
island since 1983, when Tamil minority extremists began an
insurgency to win independence from the majority Sinhalese.
   Sinhalese extremists belonging to the People's Liberation Front
have since launched their own violent campaign to undermine the
government.
   They abhor the 1987 accord with New Delhi that provides limited
autonomy to Tamils and places 47,000 Indian peacekeeping troops on
Sri Lankan soil.
   Premadasa, the candidate of the ruling United National Party, won
Monday's election with 50.4 percent of the vote. He immediately
appealed to the front to join the democratic process by contesting
February parliamentary elections, the first in 11 years.
   He had laid the groundwork for such an appeal during the
campaign, when he took pains not to blame the front for violence
widely attributed to the group.
   If the extremists decline, the new president could decide a
relentless crackdown is the only solution, hoping the bulk of Sri
Lanka's 16 million people would support such a move as the best
alternative to restore law and order.
   A rebuff of the overture by the extremists, said one Western
diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity, would make people
``more likely to back him if he decides to go out and do some
bashing.''
   The front, which nearly toppled the government in November with a
boycott that has since lost steam, has given no indication of its
next move.
   It remains to be seen whether the front's power was diminished by
the presidential elections, which the group had vowed to undermine.
   The insurgency of Tamil separatists in the northeast, meanwhile,
has yet to be quelled despite the positioning of Indian troops to
enforce the 1987 accord that grants some autonomy to the minority
group that comprises 18 percent of the population.
   Premadasa says he wants the Indian soldiers out of his country,
but reality might require they stay.
   India, which has become more active as regional superpower under
Prime MInister Rajiv Gandhi, remains dedicated to keeping its troops
in place until the separatist insurgency is quashed.
   And if the Indian troops were to withdraw from the north while
Sinhalese extremists remained active in the south, the Sri Lankan
armed forces would be drawn impossibly thin to deal with both
uprisings.
   One possible solution would be a token withdrawal of some Indian
troops that Premadasa could use as proof of progress on his pledge.
   Quelling the insurgencies could help Premadasa tackle the other
huge problem he faces _ a national economy in shambles.
   The fighting not only has devastated the island's crucial tourism
industry but has cut into agricultural production as well.
   In 1987, for example, adverse weather and civil disturbances were
largely responsible for an 11 percent decline in rubber production
and 25 percent drop in coconut production, the two top crops after
tea.
   Premadasa comes from a humble background and has vowed to better
living standards in this impoverished country, where the annual per
capita income is $360.
   He has proposed a welfare program under which many Sri Lankan
families would qualify for $75 monthly in benefits for two years.
   Where the government would come up with the money, however, he
has not outlined.
   Still, the president-elect's populist pitch, upcoming
parliamentary elections that many political parties have long
demanded and the widespread desire for law and order all could work
in Premadasa's favor as he grapples with the daunting task of
resurrecting Sri Lanka.

<HEAD>Parents Grieve For Son Who Died Alone On Street Bench</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A reporter chose at random to tell what he
could about the death of a homeless man, broken and alone, on a San
Francisco street. A few miles away, a couple couldn't believe what
they were hearing.
   Reed Galin of KPIX television on Friday was talking about their
son, 39-year-old Gregory Rivenbark, an honorably discharged Vietnam
veteran Marine who never got over the shock of his experience.
   His parents, Mal and Mary Ann Rivenbark of South San Francisco,
learned that Gregory was the 91st homeless person to die in San
Francisco. He was found dead Oct. 13.
   ``I thought someone had made a mistake,'' his mother said. ``A
terrible mistake.''
   The Rivenbarks waited through the weekend to learn whether the
report was true that, as Mrs. Rivenbark said, ``He died alone ...
when I saw that bench on televison, I thought, `He just sat down
there and he died.'''
   She said they are hoping for a memorial service with a Marine
color guard at Golden Gate National Cemetery.
   They last saw their son a week before he died. In the interim
they were occupied with Mal Rivenbark's quadruple-bypass surgery.
Birthdays and an anniversary passed, and Gregory didn't telephone.
They wondered why.
   Mrs. Rivenbark said their son suffered mental problems and
alcoholism after his discharge. She said he had been traumatized by
the death of another Marine in the war.
   After Gregory died, his body went unclaimed, and was finally sent
to a mortuary school that contracts for the indigent dead. The
coroner's office tried unsuccessfully to find next of kin.
   Rivenbark was identified through fingerprints. The coroners tried
to find next of kin by checking a police rap sheet, hospital
records, and Veteran's Administration files.
   ``There is only so much we can do,'' administrative coroner
Joseph Surdyka. ``And then we have to move on to the next death.''
   His mother recalled her last conversation with her son, a phone
call from a Redwood City hospital where he was in recovery.
   ``He called, it was 1 a.m., I was sleepy,'' she said. ``I said,
`Gregory, I wish you all the luck.' He said, `Thanks, mom.' Those
were the last words he ever said to me.''

<HEAD>Ortega Hands Out Christmas Toys to Children</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYNA BRENNAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Daniel Ortega on Wednesday
handed out thousands of Christmas toys to poor children in
shantytowns.
   In the neighborhood of Acalhualinca, some 2,000 children, many of
them in tattered shorts and barefoot, waited in long lines on a dirt
field for the gifts. The girls received dolls or a plastic tea set,
while the boys grabbed for plastic rifles and trucks.
   The $1 million in toys came from profits from government-run hard
currency stores, officials said. The 14 stores nationwide sell goods
ranging from basic foods to stereos for dollars only. Most items
sold are rarely found in the common markets.
   The toys, wrapped in plastic with writing in English, were made
in Taiwan, a country that does not maintain diplomatic relations
with Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government.
   The Sandinistas, who came to power almost a decade ago, have been
making a push this year to show there is no contradiction between
leftist revolution and Christianity.
   The opposition newspaper La Prensa on Tuesday printed a headline
saying, ``Sad Christmas; Cardinal Asks For Faith.''
   The Nicaraguan economy has never been worse. Private estimates
put the annual inflation at more than 20,000 percent, highest in the
world. Ortega recently acknowledged that figure could be correct.
   New economic measures were expected to be announced in the next
two weeks. A series of plans designed to right the situation failed
to pull the bankrupt nation out the mire.
   Despite up to $500 million in Soviet bloc aid, the average worker
earns only about $10 a month. A Christmas dinner of chicken and rice
for a family would be a day's pay.
   The government blames the economic crisis on the seven-year war
with U.S.-backed Contra rebels. Little is said about corruption and
mismanagement.
   The war activity diminished substantially after the March 23
cease-fire talks, but fighting continues in the countryside.
   ``Until we solve the political problems we can't solve the
economic ones,'' Francisco Taboada, a leader of the Social Christian
Party, said in an interview Tuesday night. ``People need guarantees
their land won't be confiscated. There's no confidence.''
   Taboada, a neurologlist, said Christmas would be sad for the tens
of thousands of Nicarguans whose families fled to the United States.
   ``No matter how much money they send back home, that can't
compensate for the saddness,'' he said.
   On Wednesday, few of the children receiving gifts appeared to
think about such sadness. About 14,500 were to be handed presents by
Ortega, who wore a green military uniform.
   ``This is so nice,'' said Lester Enrique Lopez, eyeing his new
plastic rifle.
   Socorro Mejia, 27, held her 2-year-old son and walked with her
five other children, all carrying toys.
   ``This is happiness for the children,'' she said.
   Blanca Rosa Cuba Dias held her gift of doll dishes tightly and
caressed the plastic wrapping.
   ``I never had anything so nice,'' she sighed.

   Mother Teresa said Wednesday she will send eight
nuns to Moscow and Armenia to care for earthquake victims in a
country where charitable work by religious organizations has been
illegal for about 60 years.
   The nuns will work with victims of the Dec. 7 Armenian earthquake
and other severely injured hospital patients under a six-month trial
agreement, under which they will keep their religious services to
themselves.
   ``If all goes well, I hope we shall be able to prolong (the
agreement),'' said Genrikh Borovik, president of the Soviet Peace
Commitee, which along with the Ministry of Health concluded an
agreement with Mother Teresa, the 1979 Nobel Peace Prize winner.
   The 78-year-old Roman Catholic nun told a Moscow news conference
that her year-old offer to send her sisters to the Soviet Union was
suddenly accepted Wednesday, when an emissary from President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev showed up on her doorstep.
   She was in the Soviet capital on her way back from visiting
earthquake victims in Armenia.
   ``We have no gold and silver to give,'' said Mother Teresa,
referring to the more than $100 million in international aid that
has poured into the Soviet Union since the quake killed an estimated
55,000 people.
   ``But we are very happy to give tender love and care to the
people, to the sick, the dying, the lonely, to anybody who needs
love,'' said the nun, who has spent her life serving the destitute
of Calcutta.
   The Russian Orthodox Church, which has been banned from
charitable work for decades, has in the past year begun reaching
out, financing a rehabilitation hospital for Soviet veterans of the
war in Afghanistan. The few Orthodox nuns in the Soviet Union have
been limited to working with other nuns and priests.
   Religious organizations have been banned from charitable
activities in the Soviet Union since strict rules were imposed under
Josef Stalin in 1929. Officials have been saying for more than a
year they are rewriting laws to make religion freer, but the new
legislation has not yet been published.
   Four of Mother Teresa's nuns will be given three rooms at the
Institute of Neurosurgery in Moscow, where they will live and work
with victims of spinal injuries and other severe trauma ``who need
both physical rehabilitation and spiritual assistance,'' said Arkady
V. Lifshitz, a professor with the institute.
   ``We have agreed that any religious services would be for
themselves and not for the patients or the public,'' he said.
   The other four nuns will work with quake victims in Armenia. No
more specific location was given.
   Mother Teresa offered her order's services to the Soviet Union in
August 1987, when she was visiting victims of the Chernobyl nuclear
power plant accident. She said the Soviet Peace Committee has been
working on the idea since that time.
   Borovik said Mother Teresa's offer was treated ``cautiously at
first, because it was a new idea; there had never been anything like
that before.'' The nuns' role first had to be explained to doctors
at the hospital, he said, but he added that the radical changes
sweeping through the Soviet Union also played a role.
   ``This society is growing increasingly open and that has had some
effect,'' Borovik said.
   Mother Teresa heads the Missionaries of Charity, a worldwide
order of 3,000 nuns of 35 nationalities, with houses in 87
countries. She said the eight nuns coming to the Soviet Union were
from India, Yugoslavia, Poland and Italy, and she would welcome any
young Soviet women who would like to join her order.
   The nun said she already has nuns working in Cuba, Yugoslavia,
East Germany and Poland, and she has discussed the idea with
officials in China.
   While in Beijing, she said, she was asked, ``What is a Communist
to you?'' and she replied, ``A child of God.''
   Soon, newspapers were headlining, ``Mother Teresa says Communists
are children of God,'' she said, smiling.
   The nun said the suffering she saw in Armenia was ``very
terrible,'' but she was surprised to see that despite the suffering,
every victim was able to smile back at her.
   ``I think it helped a lot that the whole world is sharing and
helping,'' she said.

<HEAD>US Expands Program To Reward Informants on Terrorists</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Anyone who helps prevent terrorist acts against
American citizens or property abroad will be eligible for payments
of up to $500,000 under an expanded rewards program announced
Wednesday by the State Department.
   Since 1984, the State Department has offered rewards for
information leading to the arrest and conviction of perpetrators of
specific terrorist acts.
   The expanded program includes payment for information that leads
to the ``prevention, frustration or favorable resolution'' of
terrorist acts against American citizens or property overseas, State
Department deputy spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said.
   She said the department is distributing to all U.S. diplomatic
missions overseas posters advertising the program. The posters are
printed in English, French, German, Spanish and Arabic.
   Anyone with terrorism information should notify the nearest U.S.
embassy or consulate, Mrs. Oakley said. Information received will be
handled confidentially and the identities of informants will be
protected.
   Rewards have been offered for information on six terrorist
incidents since the program began, but no payments have been made.
   ``We hope that the broader approach to the program will produce
more information and more potential rewards recipients,'' Mrs.
Oakley said.
   Offers of rewards have been made for information on two airline
hijackings and one involving a ship, the bombing of a TWA flight and
the assassinations of Americans in Greece and El Salvador.
   The largest reward offer _ $500,000 _ was made concerning the
assassination of U.S. Navy Capt. William Nordeen last June 28 in
Greece.
   Mrs. Oakley emphasized that no money under the rewards program is
payable for the release of American hostages.
   ``Actual payment under this program would only be made after the
arrest of those responsible for the taking or holding of hostages or
if the information is provided subsequent to the arrest that
contributes to a successful prosecution after their conviction,''
she said.
   She said the rewards program is one of the several tools used to
prevent and investigate incidents of terrorism.
   ``Publicity surrounding awards for terrorism information is
designed to create uncertainty among the terrorists, increase
mistrust among their ranks and emphasize to them and to the public
that they are personally at risk,'' she said.
   She said the expansion of the program is not the result of any
particular event.

   The White House has been accredited officially
as a museum.
   The American Association of Museums, whose 2,300 member
institutions include art museums, zoos and historic homes, said the
White House had met ``the highest standards of management and
operations'' to qualify for accreditation.
   Only 673 of the more than 6,500 museums across the country meet
the association's stringent, detailed criteria for this recognition,
said association executive director Edward Able.
   Able said the White House was honored for its conservation,
interpretation and management of its historic collection of fine
arts, including paintings, sculpture, furnishings and decorative
pieces by American and European artists.
   The museum areas of the Executive Mansion consist mainly of the
ground-floor corridor and first-floor state rooms open to public
tours, Able said, but also include the diplomatic reception room and
other private areas.
   Official recognition of the president's home as a museum followed
a two-year process involving evaluation of thousands of objects in
the collection by the White House staff, a visit by an AAM
accreditation team and a review by an AAM committee of leading
museum professionals.

   William F. Kessler said he was worried about
underwater stumps and the size of the foundering truck driver below
him when he leaped 40 feet from a highway bridge into a Louisiana
swamp to save the trucker.
   Not until the incident was ending did Kessler learn the
Atchafalaya Swamp was infested with alligators and poisonous water
moccasins.
   ``I really didn't want to jump,'' Kessler, of Houston, said after
he and Fred James Lalumandier, 23, of Bryan, Texas, were honored
Wednesday by the Carnegie Hero Fund Commission of Pittsburgh for
saving Robert H. Fordham, 40, of Columbia, S.C.
   The men, strangers until leaving their vehicles and preparing to
leap from Interstate 10 near Grosse Tete, La., on Aug. 11, were
among 20 people from nine states and Ontario named Wednesday for
heroism. Five people died in their efforts.
   ``There were a lot of stumps in there. We didn't know how deep it
was,'' Kessler said in a telephone interview. ``That was my main
concern besides the size of Mr. Fordham. He's a big old boy.''
   Fordham, 274 pounds, could barely keep his face above water due
to the back, hip and head injuries he suffered when his
tractor-trailer jackknifed in a rain storm. He was catapulted
through the windshield.
   ``He kind of flailed when I first reached him. I said `Relax,
we're here to help you,' and he totally relaxed,'' Kessler said.
   Kessler and Lalumandier towed Fordham about 40 feet to a steep
bank, where they waited an hour with him until a man arrived in a
small fishing boat.
   ``He says, `You boys are crazy for being in this water.' He says,
`There's alligators in here,''' Kessler said.
   The commission distributed $50,000 in awards to the 20 latest
heroes or their survivors. They are among 7,294 people honored in
the 84 years since the fund was established by industrialist Andrew
Carnegie. The commission has distributed more than $17.6 million in
one-time payments and pensions in recognition of acts of heroism.
   The other acts honored were:
   _ Stephen Douglas Gragg, 8, and Chad Eugene Gragg, 12, of
Buckner, Mo., fell through ice and drowned Feb. 4 along with their
brother, Aaron, 11, who fell through ice on a small pond and called
to them for help.
   _ Robert L. Merrifield, 22, of Corpus Christi, Texas, and Miguel
Rodriguez Jr., 38, of Bay City, Texas, entered a tank and like the
co-worker they were trying to save were overcome and died. The
accident occurred Aug. 26, 1987, on a drilling rig platform at
Sabine Pass, Texas.
   _ Everett H. Williamson, 32, of Cleveland died in a house fire
along with Jeremy Williamson, 9, his nephew, after rousing Jeremy,
his two brothers and their father. The others escaped.
   _ Ranger Mark Padgett, 30, of Hartwell, Ga., dove into the Darien
River near Darien, Ga., April 17, to help save Roy M. Smith, 37,
from drowning.
   _ Four people: Lionel E. Hicks, 32, of Picton, Ontario; Lawrence
A. White, 27, of Toronto; R. Paul Vidito, 31, of Picton; and Paul
Nelson Bartlett, 28, of Consecon, Ontario, entered the basement of a
building in Picton Jan. 11, 1986, to rescue patrons of a restaurant
who were trapped by debris following a gas explosion. All survived.
   _ Craig Irwin Cronin, 38, of Hyattsville, Md., stepped between a
co-worker at a College Park, Md., motel office and a man who
splashed gasoline on both workers, setting them aflame on Sept. 29,
1987. Cronin extinguished the flames on Carla Scott. Both were
hospitalized for serious burns.
   _ Thomas M. Millard, 35, of Lincoln, Neb., saved police officers
David M. Beggs and Lee R. Volkner from possibly being shot by a
suspect who drew Begg's gun from its holster as the offers were
arresting him. Millard joined the struggle and grabbed the suspect's
wrist.
   _ Joseph F. Clemente, 45, of McKeesport, Pa., and Edward Opatrny,
41, of Port Vue, Pa., freed Gregory D. Kuhns, 18, from his burning,
overturned car after an accident July 8, in Harrison City, Pa.
   _ Merle Edward Watkins, 65, of Pittsburgh entered the burning
home of a neighbor, Fred D. Wood, 80, pushed open a barricaded
interior door and dragged Wood, who greatly outweighed him, to
safety.
   _ John Phillip Goucher, 34, of Oakdale, Calif., and Ken L.
Jenkins, 30, of La Habra, Calif., entered a burning automobile,
freed Gary S. Franklin, 36, and pulled him out March 23, at Dublin,
Calif.
   _ Roger Dale Jackson, 16, of Joanna, S.C., stopped his vehicle on
a highway in Joanna Feb. 12 and freed Frank G. Trotter, 21, who was
unconscious, from Trotter's pickup truck after it crashed on a
railroad track. A freight train smashed the pickup seconds after
Jackson pulled Trotter free.

<HEAD>Reagan Orders Faster Action To Remove Duties on Cedar Imports</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan on Wednesday ordered a
stepped-up schedule of reductions in import duties on Western red
cedar shingles and shakes, saying recent market trends have impaired
the effectiveness of the import relief he put into effect 2{ years
ago.
   Reagan imposed import duties on June 6, 1986, on a schedule
calling for their gradual reduction over five years, with a review
after 30 months.
   The International Trade Commission, meanwhile, was directed to
study what would be the probable economic effect on the domestic
industry if the import relief were terminated at the end of the
30-month period.
   Reagan said the commission was equally divided on whether
continuing the duties would spur adjustments that would make the
domestic industry more competitive.
   ``On the basis of the advice that I have received, I have
determined that the industry has undertaken positive adjustment
efforts to improve competitiveness during the 30-month period of
relief,'' he said. ``However, the additional duties have burdened
consumers and have encouraged substitution of alternative non-wood
roofing materials.''
   ``I have determined that recent market trends have impaired the
effectiveness of import relief provided to the domestic industry,''
he said. ``Accordingly, I have determined that is is in the national
interest to accelerate the reduction of import duties.''
   Reagan's order means the duties will remain in effect, but will
be reduced more rapidly than the original schedule called for. The
new schedule is effective Jan. 1.

<HEAD>New Biological Product Seen As Boon For Corn Crops</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Field trials this year proved the safety of a
new biological product that would enable corn to grow its own
pesticide, its developer said Wednesday.
   The bioinsecticide, or Cxc-Bt, was developed by Crop Genetics
International Corp. of Hanover, Md., and is aimed at controlling the
European corn borer, a pest estimated to cost $400 million in losses
annually to the nation's corn crop.
   A series of tests was performed in Maryland this year and Crop
Genetics said it will seek further approval from the Agriculture
Department and the Environmental Protection Agency to carry out
additional field trials in 1989 at various locations, including
major corn areas of the Midwest.
   ``The scientific data from our field trials in Maryland confirms
the environmental safety of our bioinsecticide,'' said Peter S.
Carlson, chief scientist and co-founder of the company.
   Some environmentalists had feared the bioinsecticide might spread
to other plants or to humans and other animal species.
   But Crop Genetics said the Maryland tests showed that Cxc-Bt does
not multiply or survive outside its host plant. The Cxc part of the
``vaccine'' was described as a naturally occurring microorganism
which can live only inside a plant's vascular system.
   The Bt part ``is lethal to the borer but harmless to humans,
animals, birds and non-target insects,'' the company said. The
product, which the firm calls InCide, is inserted in corn seed and
then enables corn plants to grow their own biopesticide against the
borer.
   Company officials said the 1989 field tests will include yield
and production information to see how well the biopesticide performs.

   The right-wing Likud bloc and the center-left
Labor Party voted at separate meetings Wednesday to approve a joint
coalition, assuring a new national unity government after seven
weeks of inter-party haggling.
   Both Likud's Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and Labor's Foreign
Minister Shimon Peres faced opposition from within their parties
before winning approval for the accord. Shamir's opponents accused
him of selling out Israel's security, and some Labor members told
Peres he was dealing a death blow to the peace process.
   Both leaders told their parties that a unity government was
crucial to withstand the challenges facing Israel, especially the
PLO's recent declaration of an independent Palestinian state and the
U.S. decision to open a dialogue with the organization.
   ``If a joint government with Likud and Labor had not been
established, this process of isolation and conflict with the world
would have persisted,'' Peres told his supporters. ``By building
such a government, such a process will be halted.''
   The government announced a special session on Thursday of the
Knesset, or parliament, for installation of the new government. The
two parties will formally sign the pact before the ceremony, Likud
officials said.
   Three of Israel's four religious parties, the Orthodox Agudat
Israel, the Torah Flag, and the National Religious Party, said late
Wednesday they would join the new government. But they will be
secondary to the major parties and will lack the influence they
sought _ and thought they had won _ in a narrow coalition with Likud.
   Under the new agreement, worked out after seven weeks of haggling
among all parties who won votes in Nov. 1 elections, Shamir will
retain his post for the next four years. Peres, the current foreign
minister, will serve as finance minister.
   Moshe Arens, a close Shamir ally and former defense minister as
well as former ambassador in Washington, will be foreign minister.
   Other key portfolios will remain the same, including Labor's
Yitzhak Rabin as defense minister and Likud's Ariel Sharon as
industry minister.
   Each of the two large parties will have 11 ministers, but the
Cabinet could number up to 25 if the religious parties join.
   Labor and Likud have ruled Israel in an uneasy coalition since
1984, when stalemated elections gave neither party a mandate. A
similar stalemate resulted from the latest elections but Likud
gained a slight edge, winning 40 seats to Labor's 39. The rest of
the votes were split among smaller parties.
   In a decision certain to create friction with Washington, the two
parties agreed specifically to ban contacts with the Palestine
Liberation Organization, which Israel views as a terrorist group.
Israeli leaders were stunned last week when the United States
reversed a 13-year ban on talking to the group.
   Other government policies are expected to resemble those of the
old coalition as well.
   The Labor Party's 1,275-member Central Committee voted by an
overwhelming show of hands in favor of the coalition at a meeting in
the Tel Aviv suburb of Givatayim.
   Peres vowed he would try to revive the Middle East peace process
although he would no longer be foreign minister.
   ``The flag of the peace process remains in our hands, it has
nothing to do with a ministry,'' Peres said. He indicated he would
strive for a territorial compromise with Palestinians in the
occupied lands, which Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East War.
Likud strongly opposes trading land for peace.
   ``The Labor party prefers a Jewish majority to territories,'' he
said. ``We prefer peace.''
   Younger legislators countered that Labor, in its weakened
position, would be unnable to overcome Likud's objections to its
peace initiatives.
   ``You once called Yitzhak Shamir the murderer of peace, now he
has three lawyers on his team so he can murder it again,'' Labor
legislator Chaim Ramon was quoted by Israel radio as saying.
   The Haaretz newspaper said that according to the pact, Peres
would have to be consulted on all major foreign policy issues.
   Likud approved the new pact in secret balloting at an all-night
meeting in Tel Aviv. The party said 55.1 percent of 1,445 party
delegates voted for the agreement.
   Leading the opposition in Likud was Sharon, who argued that
Israel needed a tougher government to quell the year-long uprising
by Palestinians in the occupied territories, in which more than 330
Palestinians and 13 Israelis have been killed.
   Sharon argued that Labor's conciliatory policies were ``a danger
to Israel's future and security.''
   The new coalition agreement, as published by the Haaretz daily
newspaper, contains a new feature that would bar either Labor of
Likud from pulling out and forming a narrow coaliton with smaller
factions.
   New elections would have to be held if the government were
toppled by a no-confidence motion in parliament, the paper quoted
the agreement as saying.
   Shamir said on Israel Television that the includes a secret
amendment ``regulating the relations between two party heads,'' but
would not elaborate.
   Likud officials have accused Peres of acting behind Shamir's back
in the outgoing government to push his own peace proposals.

<HEAD>Minister Blames Moslem Extremists for More Than 100 Attacks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Moslem extremists fighting for strict
adherence to Islamic laws were responsible for more than 100 violent
attacks recently, the interior minister said Wednesday.
   The minister, Zaki Badr, said the religious extremists have
desecrated mosques by using them as arms depots and centers of drug
trafficking, according to the state-run Middle East New Agency.
   Police in Cairo killed three extremists in a shootout Monday,
including the suspected assassin of a police officer in Cairo's Ein
Shams district earlier this month.
   At a mosque in Ein Shams, security sources said 32 bottles of
incendiary materials were found last week. There also have been
reports of firecracker explosions at two Coptic Christian churches
in Cairo.
   ``The security apparatus has monitored more than 100 attacks by
religious extremists throughout the republic,'' the agency quoted
Badr as saying. He said they set fire to shops, pharmacies and cars
and attacked Moslem and Christian houses of worship. The interior
minister gave no dates for the attacks.
   Badr's remarks followed a recent crackdown on Moslem extremists
in Ein Shams, where two police officers and three civilians have
been killed since August in unrest linked to the fundamentalists.
Since then, more than 300 extremists have been detained.
   The government said most were affiliated with the Jihad
underground group blamed for the assassination of President Anwar
Sadat on Oct. 6, 1981, and a subsequent coup attempt.
   Badr said security forces are ``mopping up all criminal dens and
have been able to clean the Ein Shams district of the extremists who
tried to control it and to prevent wedding and death observances.''
   The Moslem groups consider wedding festivities and traditional
funeral ceremonies as anti-Islamic.
   Moslem extremists are using violence to demand the strict
implementation of Sharia, Islam's legal and ethical code.
   ``They have turned mosques into storehouses for arms and
ammunition and used them for attacks and for trading in narcotics of
all kinds for the benefit of those who use religion as a screen,''
said Badr.
   In the southern city of Assiut, a center of fundamentalist
activity, clashes have been reported at mosques in recent months.
The Assiut University campus has been the site of many clashes
between police and fundamentalist students. Badr estimated there
were more than 800 extremists among the more than 45,000 students.
   ``The extremists have turned some mosques _ no more than 25 out
of 70,000 mosques nationwide _ into dens from which to mount their
crimes against the people,'' Badr said, according to the news agency.
   Badr was quoted as saying he has the legal power to order the
demolition of buildings used as centers of crime. But he ruled out
such action against mosques ``because we are a devout Moslem
nation.''
   Mosques also have been used as battlegrounds between the
extremists and moderate fundamentalists from the Moslem Brotherhood,
which has 35 seats in parliament and is using peaceful methods to
insist on the observance of Sharia. The government says more than 90
percent of Egyptian laws already conform to Sharia and the rest will
be implemented gradually.
   Badr made his remarks in a speech to a committee of the Shura
Council, a consultative body of elders that works alongside the
People's Assembly, or parliament, but has no legislative powers.

<HEAD>Letters By Boys Town Residents Recall Dark Christmases</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SCOTT SONNER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOYS TOWN, Neb. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One boy said his worst Christmas present
was a packet of cocaine and a bottle of Jack Daniels. A second said
he never received a Christmas gift from his family.
   The letters are often poignant, sometimes disturbing. When
youngsters at Boys Town were asked to describe their best and worst
Christmases, some recalled physical abuse, alcoholism and turmoil,
while others reminisced about happy family holidays long past.
   A teen-age resident recalled the time he got an empty box. A girl
said that on her worst holiday all she got was bruises.
   The Rev. Val J. Peter, executive director of Boys Town, asked
more than 500 students at the residential treatment center to
describe their best and worst holidays as part of a religion class
assignment.
   ``My worst was when I got nothing because my mother had the money
and she spent it on alcohol,'' one high school girl wrote.
   ``My saddest Christmas was a few years ago on Christmas Eve,
because Santa forgot to come,'' another youngster said.
   Peter, a Roman Catholic priest, said the exercise was designed to
help the youths get in touch with bad experiences and begin to look
to a brighter future. The letters were provided Wednesday to The
Associated Press on the condition that the youngsters' names not be
revealed.
   ``Christmas is the most difficult time of the year for our boys
and girls because Christmas is a family time, and their families are
in shambles,'' Peter said in an interview.
   The letters express ``times of darkness, tears and loneliness,''
he said. ``I think all the children in America ought to read these
letters. When they read them, some gratitude ought to swell up in
their hearts and they will say, `Thank you, Lord, for everything I
have.'''
   Boys Town, founded in 1917 and made famous by the 1938 movie of
the same name about the Rev. Edward Flanagan's boys home, provides
treatment in a foster-home setting to children sent by courts,
social service agencies and church leaders. The 1,300-acre campus,
which is an incorporated community, is located on the outskirts of
Omaha.
   Most of the 550 residents are victims of abuse, neglect and
abandonment, said Tom Schuyler, a Boys Town spokesman. Many have
been in trouble with the law.
   ``We call them throw-away kids. Nobody else wants them. A lot of
them are from failed foster home placements. Some have failed in 15
or 20 previous placements,'' he said.
   Not all of the letters were sad. Some expressed unhappiness over
unwanted presents familiar to many households, including ``a Michael
Jackson doll,'' ``three pair of Wrangler bell-bottom jeans,'' and
``a plaid V-neck sweater that mom insisted I wear.''
   But most students related tales of family turmoil, abuse and
alcoholism.
   One boy said his saddest memory was when his father left the
family on Christmas Eve.
   Here are some excerpts:
   _``When I was real little, my father was an alcoholic and beat my
mother on Christmas morning. The police were called by the neighbors
and my father was thrown in jail. My mom was bloody and bruised.''
   _``(The worst gift I ever got at Christmas was) cocaine and a
fifth of Jack Daniels.'' Schuyler explained the boy received those
gifts while trying to recover from drug and alcohol dependency.
   _``My saddest Christmas was in Las Vegas when I didn't get
anything but bruises. I was with my Grandma ... and she was drunk on
Christmas so she beat on the kids, saying we were bad.''
   _``My saddest Christmas was last Christmas because I lost my
closest family member, my dad. He killed himself.''
   Likewise, the memories of happiest Christmases focused almost
exclusively on good experiences tied to family gatherings.
   _``My happiest Christmas was the Christmas all of my family was
getting along and everyone was all together.''
   _``My happiest was when my real dad came and saw all of us.''
   Schuyler said he took the letters home and read them to his four
children, ages 8 to 16. He said they ``seemed to get a clue that
getting three or four presents isn't the only thing in life.''
   ``Kids wouldn't take their family life for granted if they read
these letters,'' he said.

<HEAD>Kremlin Expert Likens Gorbachev's Reforms to Bolshevik Revolution</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A noted expert on the Soviet Union, George
Kennan, said in an interview broadcast Wednesday that Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's reforms mark ``the greatest turning point'' in Russia
since the Bolshevik Revolution and are a big help to the United
States.
   ``I think it is greatly in our interest, when he is doing all the
things that we have always wanted someone to do in Russia,'' said
Kennan, who as U.S. ambassador to Moscow was declared persona non
grata in 1952 under Kremlin strongman Josef Stalin.
   ``In my opinion, Gorbachev's reforms in concept were sound and
correct and if carried through will lead to a very important
improvement in Soviet life,'' Kennan said on the ``MacNeil@Lehrer
NewsHour.''
   Kennan, 84, called Gorbachev's reforms ``the greatest turning
point, really, not only since the Second World War but since the
Russian Revolution'' in 1917.
   The ideological basis of Soviet foreign policy, he said, has
``entirely disappeared. No one in Russia today dreams of trying to
implement world revolution in our time, or even to stage any
communist revolutions in any of the Western countries.''
   Kennan said he hoped the Bush administration would recognize that
Moscow was less threatening than in the past.
   ``I would like to hope, of course, that the men around Mr. Bush
and Mr. Bush himself saw things this way, too, and realized that the
Cold War is, really has been left in the past,'' he said.
   Gorbachev's reforms thus far have not improved living conditions
for the Soviet people and as a result, the Soviet leader's
``position today is very precarious because he has had hard luck and
a lot of things have gone adversely and he is being blamed for
them.''
   One of the biggest obstacles to successful reforms in Russia,
said Kennan, was the ``moral damage'' inflicted on most Soviet
people during the Stalinist years of terror and the period of
stagnation under Leonid I. Brezhnev, 1964-82.
   ``You have a deplorable and pathetic situation (with) these
people, for they've lived all their lives under authoritarian
discipline and control. They've been deprived of even the idea that
they could ever change their situation by their own indiviual
initiative and now while they are confronted with the possibility of
what you might call freedom, they have no ide how to take advantage
of it.''
   Kennan said he was unable to explain how such a daring leader as
Gorbachev rose through the ranks of the highly disciplined Soviet
Communist Party during the Brezhnev years to carry out sweeping
reforms of the system.
   ``Numbers of us who have known that country for a long time
simply stand without explanation as to how a man with those
qualities could have emerged from a provincial party apparatus,''
Kennan said.
   The main impetus for change, said Kennan, was ``the realization
on the part of many intelligent people in the Soviet Union in these
recent years of the fact that the whole system was going downhill,
that it was no longer competitive, that the capitalist countries
were going far beyond it.''
   ``The change, after all, has been a change inspired and carried
out from the top, from the upper reaches of the political society
and not really from the bottom. It is these people who saw how
inadequate the system was and who have tried to take action to
change it.''

<NOTE>Eds: LEADS with 5 grafs to UPDATE with 3 religious parties joining
govt. Pick up 6th pvs, ``Likud won...''; DELETES 17th graf.</NOTE>

   The decision by Israel's two major parties to
join a coalition has edged the ultra-Orthodox parties from a
posiiton of influence and effectively killed the chances of the
``Who is a Jew'' law that incensed U.S. Jews.
   Although the religious parties emerged from Nov. 1 elections as
kingmakers with control of a crucial bloc of parliament seats, they
drove themselves out of the market by setting too high a price for
their support.
   The price _ a package that included the legislation _ threatened
to alienate Jews abroad, who are Israel's mainstay of support.
   Three of Israel's four religious parties decided to join the
government led by the center-left Labor and the right-wing Likud.
But experts said the new coalition essentially counts religious
parties out of major policy decisions.
   ``This is a revolution,'' said Shmuel Sandler of the Jerusalem
Center for Public Affairs.
   Likud won 40 members in the 120-member parliament, while Labor
won 39. The 18 seats won by the religious parties gave them a
powerful swing vote.
   In the seven weeks of squabbling following the stalemated
elections, the religious parties ran back and forth between the
major blocs, often arguing between themselves over the same
government posts.
   Finally, Likud and Labor settled their differences, leaving room
for the Orthodox to join but not requiring their support.
   The most controversial demand made by the religious parties was a
change in the definition of who is eligible for automatic
citizenship under Israel's unique Law of Return, which opens the
country's doors to any Jew.
   The Orthodox wanted to exclude any person who converted to the
faith under a non-Orthodox rabbi. Most U.S. Jews are not Orthodox.
   Jews overseas launched what many called an unprecedented campaign
to convey their anger to leaders of Likud and Labor, who were wooing
the religious parties with a promise to pass the law.
   ``The pressure from the diaspora made political leaders in Israel
recognize ... that diaspora Jews care deeply about what Israel
does,'' said Rabbi Richard G. Hirsch, executive director of the
World Union for Progressive Judaism.
   ``It also made them recognize that there is no Jewish people
without the Jewish state, and no Jewish state without the Jewish
people, and the Law of Return is symbolic of that.''
   The turning point came when the United States reversed its
position against talks with the Palestine Liberation Organization,
which is banned in Israel as a terrorist group.
   Analysts say Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir realized he needed a
broad and unified government to withstand international pressure to
make concessions to the Palestinians.
   ``Shamir couldn't wage a war on two fronts,'' said Prof. Menachem
Friedman, a Bar Ilan University sociologist specializing in
religious affairs. ``It would not be smart to get into a fight, or
even cause tension with U.S. Jewry and reduce their motivation to
support Israel.''
   Labor leader Shimon Peres said the new pact ``brings an end to
the change in the Law of Return.'' The new government will ``keep
the Jewish people united,'' he said.
   Religious party leaders reacted with anger when they were
informed Likud would not keep its commitments because of the broad
government with Labor.
   ``Even the Mafia keeps its promises,'' Rabbi Yitzhak Peretz, of
the Orthodox Shas party told the Maariv newspaper.
   Some analysts said they hope Labor and Likud, free of the
religious parties, will pass a bill reforming the country's complex
elections system that often leaves small parties in positions of
power.
   The religious parties already have expressed vehement opposition,
however, and the tradition of their participation in the government
may not disappear so easily.

   People scalp tickets all the time, reasoned
Susan Stein, so why not scalp a place in class?
   The graduate student at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln did
just that to get into a class she needed.
   During early registration she discovered a seminar's 12 positions
were filled. That's when she ran an advertisement in the Daily
Nebraskan, the university newspaper.
   ``If you got in this class next semester,'' the ad read, ``I'll
buy your place.''
   ``State your price.''
   Ms. Stein struck a deal with an unidentified person and she's in
the class. She didn't divulge details of the transaction.
   While her ad raised a few eyebrows, Ms. Stein said she had heard
that the practice went on at other colleges.
   ``I think I took everybody off guard. No one (here) had heard of
paying for a class space before,'' she said.
   Ted Pfeiffer, director of registration and records at the
university, said buying a spot isn't illegal and there isn't any
regulation that prohibits it.
   Pfeifer said instructors usually set the size of a class and many
times agree to add students, particularly if the student's need
appears to be urgent.
   ``I guess it says a lot about the power of advertising,'' Ms.
Stein said.

<HEAD>7-Year-Old Joins City Youth Commission</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BERKELEY, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 7-year-old whiz kid who worked for the
re-election of a city councilman has learned how the spoils system
works, receiving an appointment to the city Youth Commission.
   Teddy Andrews still has a ways to go in the political world,
however. At his swearing-in Tuesday, he was asked how he liked the
press conference.
   ``What's a press conference?'' responded the youngest of some 400
people who serve Berkeley on 43 boards and commissions.
   The boy, who has attended one year of school but became bored and
is now studying subjects such as physics and paleontology at home.
He learned Chinese from a University of California-Berkeley physics
student, an ability he put to work on behalf of Councilman Don
Jelinek.
   ``He gave speeches in Chinese, he went door to door. He ended up
being `Don's campaign manager.' He devoted 10-12 hours a day,'' said
the boy's mother, Alexandra Andrews. ``They told me I could get
lost, just as long as I left them Teddy.''
   ``I originally thought that would be a pain we'd have to
tolerate. Was I ever wrong,'' said Jelinek. ``He did everything. He
was a very dedicated worker, then after the campaign he wrote
thank-you notes in Chinese and Korean to non-English speakers who
helped us.''
   The nine-member Youth Commission, appointed by City Council,
meets monthly and advises the council on youth issues.
   ``I decided it would make a great appointment,'' Jelinek said.
``Here's a rare opportunity to have the wisdom of someone who is
physically 7 years old but has a mental and intellectual age of
someone 10 years older.''
   Teddy hasn't made any major promises but said he wants to work to
fix the bathrooms at a park a few blocks from his home in a
residential hotel where he lives with his mother, a single parent
who works several part-time jobs.
   He said he also wants to make it easier for homeless children to
go to school.

<HEAD>NRC Clears Way For Seabrook Test License, OKs Restart Of Pilgrim</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CALLAHAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Nuclear Regulatory Commission on Wednesday
cleared the way for the $5.7 billion Seabrook, N.H., plant to
receive a low-power testing license and ruled that the Pilgrim
reactor in Massachusetts can resume operations after a shutdown of
nearly three years.
   Massachusetts Gov. Michael S. Dukakis called the moves
``irrational'' and ``irresponsible'' on ground that communities
surrounding the New England plants cannot be quickly evacuated in
case of a nuclear accident.
   The former Democratic presidential nominee immediately filed suit
in federal appeals court in Boston in an effort to block the restart
of Pilgrim. And the governor reiterated his pledge to fight a
Seabrook license in court if one is issued.
   NRC Chairman Lando W. Zech Jr. said Seabrook could get its
low-power license, which permits testing at 5 percent power, as
early as Jan. 6 if it can set aside $72.1 million. The NRC said the
owners must have that money on hand for decommissioning costs in
case Seabrook receives the testing permit but never gets a
full-power commercial license.
   Seabrook also cannot receive the license, which it has sought for
more than two years, until the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board
rules on a request by Massachusetts officials to review alleged
problems with the operators' response during a June exercise of the
plant's emergency plans.
   But Seabrook officials said the commission's staff has already
recommended that the licensing board reject the state's request and
that they expected the issue to be resolved shortly.
   Ted G. Feigenbaum, vice president at New Hampshire Yankee,
operator of the plant, also said that while Seabrook officials
estimated possible decommissioning costs at $21.1 million, he did
not view the larger fund demanded by the NRC as a stumbling block.
He predicted low-power testing would be under way next month.
   The NRC also rejected unanimously an appeal by opponents to
review the financial qualifications of Seabrook's owners. The
plant's lead owner, Public Service Company of New Hampshire, filed
for bankruptcy reorganization in January. In June, the project's
fourth largest shareholder, the Massachusetts Municipal Wholesale
Electric Co., withdrew from the project and halted its $2 million
monthly payments.
   In Boston, Dukakis said that ``In the case of Seabrook, it is
unconscionable that the NRC continues to discuss ways to advance
low-power testing, because it is impossible to adequately evacuate
the area.''
   The vote to restart the Pilgrim plant, which was shut down in
April 1986 because of several management and safety problems, also
was unanimous.
   Zech said the commission was convinced that an estimated $35
million in safety improvements and a sweeping management overhaul by
Boston Edison Co. has made the 16-year-old plant ready to resume
operations.
   But Dukakis leads a legion of critics who point to a 1987 report
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which found that the
plans to evacuate suburban residents around Pilgrim were inadequate.
The plant is 40 miles south of Boston in Plymouth, Mass.
   ``Today's vote is an insult to the local officials and South
Shore residents who have shown convincingly that no emergency
evacuation plan can safely protect the public,'' said Sen. Edward M.
Kennedy, D-Mass. ``The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has again
demonstrated its disregard for public safety.''
   Zech, speaking to reporters after the brief votes, said ``great
improvements'' have been made on the emergency evacuation plans.
   ``The commission has acted in a very difficult situation. I think
we have acted appropriately ... we are the one responsible for
deciding whether or not the public will be protected in the remote
possibility of a radiological accident,'' he said.
   Zech said Pilgrim officials will resume operations slowly, and
that NRC investigators must approve operations at each of six levels
of power.
   Pilgrim officials said they expected the restart to take four
months, beginning before Jan. 1.
   The state's lawsuit calls the NRC action on Pilgrim ``arbitrary
and capricious'' and urges an immediate injunction to halt the plant
from getting up to 25 percent power.
   Meanwhile, Zech said the commission will not rule until next year
on whether the state and local governments in New York have legal
standing in the licensing procedure for the Shoreham nuclear plant
on Long Island, under fire for reasons similar to those cited by
critics of Seabrook.

<HEAD>FmHa Accumulated Losses of $36 Billion Over 40 Years, Report Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The General Accounting Office says the Farmers
Home Administration has built a 40-year loss record of at least $36
billion, of which about $22 billion occurred last year.
   An audit by GAO, an investigating agency of Congress, showed that
since FmHA's revolving credit accounts began in 1946, cumulative
losses have amounted to about $59 billion, of which Congress
reimbursed the Agriculture Department agency $23 billion.
   Frederick D. Wolf, director of GAO's accounting and financial
management division, said:
   ``Our opinion on FmHA's statement of financial position reflects
our concerns over the agency's inability to repay its borrowings and
to meet its current operations without incurring additional debt and
the magnitude of its accumulated $36 billion deficit, which includes
$22 billion for losses recognized in fiscal year 1987.''
   FmHA has its roots in the mid-1930s during the Depression and is
often called the government's lender of last resort for hard-pressed
farmers who cannot get credit from banks and other commercial
lenderers.
   Although farm loans are a key element of FmHA operations, rural
housing and rural development also are involved.
   The GAO audit was for the fiscal year that ended on Sept. 30,
1987, and was the first in the agency's history. It was submitted on
Tuesday to Agriculture Secretary Richard E. Lyng, who is required by
law to respond to Congress within 60 days.
   Marlyn Aycock, a spokesman for FmHA, said Wednesday that as of
Sept. 30, 1988, the agency had total loans outstanding of about $62
billion. Less than half _ $25.5 billion _ was owed under the farm
lending programs. The balance was loans for rural housing and
community development.
   Of the total $62 billion in loans, about $9.2 billion were
delinquent. The farm delinquencies represented $8.3 billion of that
amount, Aycock said.
   ``Every loan we make is subsidized to one extent or another,'' he
said. ``Over half of $62 billion loans we've got are made at
interest rates below 5 percent.''
   As to GAO's finding that the agency lost $22 billion last year,
Aycock said much of that was bookkeeping that the GAO itself had
insisted upon.
   For example, he said, the FmHA at the GAO's insistence included a
budget item for about $15 billion as a ``loss allowance'' whether
the agency actually lost that much or not.
   Aycock said the entire $15 billion for 1987 was included as a
loss by the auditors, although the final accounting by FmHA has not
been done.
   Besides the loss allowance, Aycock said there was more than $6
billion in interest subsidies in 1987, plus about $1 billion in
grants and other items, which added up to the $22 billion cited in
the report.
   ``Farmers Home was created by the Congress to do specific
things,'' Aycock said in an interview. ``I don't think it was
created to make a profit, or else they wouldn't have said we have to
lend to people who can't get money elsewhere.''
   The GAO audit was first reported by The New York Times in
Wednesday editions.

<HEAD>Companies Suspected of Illegal Nuclear Deals with Pakistan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE BOEHMER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A state prosecutor said Wednesday
he is investigating two West German companies for the alleged
illegal sale to Pakistan of material that can be used in the
production of atomic weapons.
   A nuclear expert said the deliveries may have violated the
international Nuclear Non-Proliferation treaty.
   Albert Farwick, a prosecutor for Hesse state, also said he was
investigating possible illegal sales of nuclear-related equipment to
India and South Africa.
   Farwick said the firms under investigation were the Neue
Technologie GmbH (NTG) company of Gelnhausen, 15 miles east of
Frankfurt and its sister company Physikalisch Technische Beratung
(PTB) of Ortenberg, about 24 miles northeast of Frankfurt.
   ``We know that they delivered (to Pakistan) equipment for
processing tritium and that they also delivered tritium gas,''
Farwick told The Associated Press in a telephone interview.
   Experts say tritium gas can be used to enhance the effectiveness
of an atomic bomb.
   Farwick said the investigation of the two companies began last
month after NTG fired one of its technical managers for allegedly
misusing company funds. He said NTG aroused investigators'
suspicions after it decided not to press charges or demand return of
the money from the former manager, apparently in an attempt to cover
up the illegal nuclear deals.
   He said the investigation thus far indicated that the former NTG
manager and a manager from PTB had close contact with
representatives of Pakistani nuclear officials since 1982.
   Pakistan has not signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and
reportedly has invested vast sums of money in developing its own
nuclear bomb. West Germany is a signatory of the treaty.
   Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto of Pakistan said in an interview
Sunday that Pakistan has no plans to make nuclear weapons but won't
sign the non-proliferation treaty unless India does.
   Farwick, in a statement Wednesday, also said NTG company
officials have admitted to providing technical equipment to Pakistan
as late as this past summer. He did not say if the officials also
admitted delivering the tritium gas, or when it was provided.
   The transactions were made without obtaining approval from the
West German Economics Ministry, which controls sales of technical
material to foreign countries. West German Minister of Environment
Klaus Toepfer has ordered a check of records to determine if any
requests for approval of the sales were pending.
   Farwick said the equipment in the alleged sales included
``components for building burn elements, equipment for processing
tritium, tritium gas, and transport and storage containers for
uranium hexafloride.''
   He said other items were special hull pipes, lead and zircaloy
rods, melting ovens and a pellet press.
   The material allegedly delivered to India and South Africa, he
said, included ``reflector material and cadmium pipes for India, and
a test device to measure burn elements for South Africa.''
   He said the former technical manager of NTG, who was initially
arrested in the case, has since been released pending further
investigation.
   Farwick declined to identify by name those company officials
under investigation.
   Records from both companies have been confiscated, he said.
   Jens Scheer, a nuclear physics expert in Bremen, said most of the
equipment mentioned in the sales were only important for bringing
into operation a nuclear power plant.
   ``But I am alarmed when I hear that equipment for processing
tritium and tritium gas were delivered,'' Scheer said in a telephone
interview. ``Tritium is exactly what is needed by them (countries
trying to develop atomic weapons) to enhance the effectiveness of
the (atomic) bomb.''
   ``This would violate the spirit of the non-proliferation
treaty,'' he added.

<HEAD>CARE, Junior Chamber Boost Earthquake Relief</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   CARE and the Junior Chamber of Commerce are
boosting efforts to assist survivors of the earthquake that
devastated Soviet Armenia, the groups announced at the Soviet
Embassy on Wednesday.
   ``By Christmas Day, 30,100 CARE packages will have reached
earthquake-effected areas,'' said Philip Johnston, executive
director of CARE. The relief agency has already shipped 20,000 CARE
packages to the Soviet Armenia and plans to send a total of 50,000,
he said.
   To help fund the CARE effort, Junior Chamber International has
asked its worldwide organization to raise $1 million, with half that
amount to come from its U.S. affiliate, known as the Jaycees.
   ``During the holidays, almost 5,000 Jaycee chapters across
America are running food, toy and clothing drives to assist those
less fortunate,'' Jaycee President Andy Tobin told the embassy news
conference.
   ``It is in the spirit of Christmas cooperation, not charity, that
I'm asking all Jaycee chapters to donate a minumum of $90 to $150
immediately to CARE,'' he said.
   Soviet Ambassador Yuri Dubinin said the Soviet people ``are
deeply moved by the assistance rendered by the Americans ... I am
sure a new kind of internationalism is being born.''
   The Armenian earthquake has shown that it may be ``necessary to
create an international organization to provide assistance'' to the
victims of major disasters, he said.
   The Soviet government plans to discuss such a new organization in
bilateral talks with the United States and also in the United
Nations, said Dubinin, but ``it is too early for me to specify what
would be the concrete ideas.''
   In the past, the Soviets have played a minor role in providing
aid to natural disaster victims. But Johnston, who has spent 26
years in CARE, said that in recent years the Soviets have helped
provide famine relief in the African nations of Ethiopia and Chad.
   Dubinin denied accusations by some Soviet newspapers that
confusion in the Armenian assistance effort showed that the Kremlin
learned little from relief efforts following the partial meltdown of
a nuclear reactor at Chernobyl in the Ukraine in 1986.
   ``I think that the differences (between Chernobyl and Armenia)
are much more important than the similarities,'' said Dubinin.
   U.S. aid to victims of the earthquake has topped $10 million,
according to figures kept by the Office of Foreign Disaster
Assistance in the Agency for International Development.
   As of Wednesday, the U.S. government had sent $1,909,451 worth of
aid, in the form of medicine, rescue teams, hard hats, work gloves,
plastic sheeting, tents and other goods, said Faye Henderson, a
spokeswoman for OFDA.
   Additionally, American volunteer agencies had reported sending
$8,249,439 worth of goods and services, she said, estimating that
the total would climb as further assistance is reported.

   Their belongings lost at sea, the
captain and 20 crewmen of a Greek cargo ship awaited travel
arrangements home Wednesday after being rescued in lifeboats 400
miles south of Bermuda.
   ``I feel very bad,'' said Chionis Gerasimos, a 30-year sailor and
captain of the Stark, which was abandoned Saturday after it began
sinking. ``I try again. I am seaman.''
   The Sea Merchant, a German ship bound for Philadelphia, rescued
the crew in 10-foot waves.
   The German vessel docked in Philadelphia on Tuesday, and the
rescued sailors spent the night at a motel here. Fifteen were
scheduled to leave Wednesday, with officers staying behind for a few
days to talk with lawyers.
   ``I have to say thanks to my captain,'' said Mihalis Vranas, the
ship's cook. ``He was the last one to leave the ship. A big thanks
to the German ship and to all the crew, who was very kind to us.''
   The Stark, loaded with 7,850 metric tons of dry beans, was en
route from Pensacola, Fla., to Algeria when a cargo hold began
taking on water, officials said.
   Gerasimos said the crew tried to pump the water out but could not
save the ship. He said he did not know what caused the leak.
   James Young, agent for the ship, said said he knew of no salvage
plans and that he heard the ship was sinking. The Coast Guard
stopped monitoring the ship, said Lt. Cmdr. Paul Milligan.
   Young had no overall loss estimate but said the ship probably was
worth about $1.5 million.
   The crew members _ 15 Greeks, two Ghanians and one each from
Yugoslavia, Peru, Ecuador and Syria _ left the ship with only the
clothes on their backs, in some cases without jackets.
   ``We lost everything,'' said Gerasimos. ``Most of my crew had all
bought things for their homes.''

   The Soviet Union has canceled a further 102,500
metric tons of U.S. soybean meal that had been scheduled for
delivery under a recently extended supply agreement between the two
countries, the Agriculture Department said Wednesday.
   On Tuesday, USDA announced the cancellation of 200,000 tons that
had been bought for 1988-89 delivery to the Soviet Union.
   No explanation was given, but officials say that conflicts in
shipping schedules or price disagreements have been behind such
cancellations in the past.
   The United States and the Soviet Union on Nov. 28 signed an
extension of the previous five-year grain agreement, which had
expired on Sept. 30. The extension of the previous pact will run
through Dec. 31, 1990.
   Under terms of the agreement, the Soviet Union is committed to
buy at least 9 million tons of U.S. grain annually, including a
minimum of 4 million tons each of wheat and corn.
   The Soviets have the option of buying the remaining 1 million
tons as wheat, corn or soybeans, with every ton of beans counting as
two tons of grain _ up to a maximum of 1 million tons of grain
equivalent.
   With the cancellations, the Soviets still have on order 532,500
tons of soybean meal and 500,000 tons of soybeans.

   Pop dynamo George Michael and heavy
metal leaders Def Leppard were the top nominees Wednesday in the
16th annual American Music Awards, which choses winners by popular
vote.
   Michael, whose crossover album, ``Faith,'' has spawned six hit
singles over the last year and scored on both pop and soul charts,
was nominated as favorite male vocalist in the pop-rock and
soul-rhythm and blues categories and received favorite album
nominations in those same categories.
   Def Leppard was nominated in the pop-rock category for favorite
duo or group and favorite album for their ``Hysteria'' LP. They also
received the favorite artist and favorite album nominations in the
heavy metal category.
   Earning three nominations each for the awards were heavy metal
bands Guns N' Roses and Van Halen. Country music star Randy Travis
also earned three nominations.
   The awards show, set for broadcast Jan. 30 on ABC-TV, added heavy
metal and rap music to categories for this year while eliminating
video music awards.
   ``We did it several years ago with the disco era. We just added
the category. It seemed logical,'' producer Dick Clark said.
   Clark, who this year took over production of the annual MTV Video
Awards show, said videos had been eliminated because ``There are
other awards shows that seem to take care of that category.''
   The American Music Awards nomination categories this year include
pop-rock, soul-rhythm and blues, country, heavy metal and rap.
   Among the groups and performers receiving at least two
nominations were Alabama, Rick Astley, Tracy Chapman, D.J. Jazzy
Jeff & The Fresh Prince, Whitney Houston, Michael Jackson, Gladys
Knight & The Pips, Run D.M.C., Salt-N-Pepa, George Strait, Al B.
Sure! and Steve Winwood.
   Nominees were announced by Jermaine Jackson and Rita Coolidge
during a morning news conference.
   Clark said this year's show will include tributes to Roy Orbison,
soul singer Brook Benton and pop singer Andy Gibb. All three died in
the last year. The show will also present an award of merit to an
artist yet to be announced for outstanding contributions to musical
entertainment.
   Hosts for this year's show will be Kenny Rogers, Anita Baker, Rod
Stewart and Debbie Gibson. They also will perform, along with Rick
Astley, Fleetwood Mac, Gloria Estefan and the Miami Sound Machine,
Guns N' Roses, K.T. Oslin, Randy Travis, and D.J. Jazzy Jeff & The
Fresh Prince.
   Clark noted the American Music Awards show is traditionally the
second-highest rated awards show on television, next to the Oscars.
   Names of nominees are compiled from year-end sales charts of the
music industry trade publication Cash Box.
   Winners are selected by a public polling of 20,000 people who
receive ballots sent by Herbert Altman Communications Research Inc.
The ballots are counted by the Peat, Marwick, Mitchell and Co.
accounting firm.
   The Grammy Awards of the National Academy of Recording Arts and
Sciences are determined by votes of artists and technicians in the
music industry. Nominees for those awards will be made Jan. 12.

<HEAD>French Company to Set Up Operation in Former De Lorean Plant</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELFAST, Nothern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A French auto parts maker is to
set up operations in the former De Lorean Motor Car Co. plant, in
what is the biggest foreign investment in Northern Ireland, it was
announced Wednesday.
   The French company, Montupet, is to invest $164 million and
create about 1,000 jobs in the next five years at the west Belfast
plant, which has been vacant since 1982, the Industrial Development
Board said.
   Montupet is to set up a state-of-the-art aluminum casting
operation in the 500,000-square-foot factory, the board said.
   ``The investment is the biggest ever secured by the IDB and the
largest initial investment yet made by an overseas company in
Northern Ireland,'' said Tony Hopkins, the board's chief executive.
   The aluminum foundry is expected to come on line in 1990 and
employ 920 workers, the board said.
   Montupet also is to employ 110 workers at a tool room to be built
at another site, yet to be determined.
   Much of the production will be cylinder heads for Ford Motor Co.,
Montupet's major customer, the board said.
   Montupet, which had sales of $182 million in 1987, has plants in
France, Canada and Spain and also supplies European car makers.
   The plant has been mothballed by the industrial board since 1982,
after U.S. automaker John Z. De Lorean, a former General Motors Co.
executive, encountered financial difficulties.
   The De Lorean car plant, which was established in 1978 and built
with backing from the British government, turned out more than 8,500
gull-winged sports cars and it employed more than 2,600 workers at
its peak.
   Last month, Daewoo Electronics Ltd. announced plans to establish
a $33 million video cassette recorder plant 20 miles northwest of
Belfast.
   The secretary of state for Northern Ireland, Tom King, called it
``more good news for jobs in Northern Ireland at the end of a year
that has seen a substantial fall in unemployment,'' King said.
   Unemployment in Northern Ireland stands at 15.9 percent against
an average for the whole of Britain of 7.5 percent. The higher
figure in Northern Ireland is due partly to the Irish Republican
Army's bomb and bullet war to end British rule in the province.
   The loss of the government's stake of about $140 million in the
De Lorean enterprise in Northern Ireland when it went broke in 1982
prompted widespread criticism of the British officials responsible
for overseeing the investment.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>

   A court Wednesday rejected an appeal by two Japanese
convicted of stealing and selling U.S. military documents to Soviet
and Chinese officials, a court official said.
   Masateru Tachibana, 61, and Hiromi Date, 64, were found guilty
March 22 of taking the documents from the U.S. Air Force base in
Yokota, west of Tokyo. The Tokyo District Court sentenced them to 2{
years in prison each, and fined Date $8,000.
   On Wednesday, High Court Judge Takashi Sakamoto upheld the
sentences, said the court official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   The documents dealing with aircraft maintenance were
declassified, ``but the value of the information is high and the
previous ruling is justified,'' the high court said.
   Tachibana and Date can appeal to the Supreme Court within 14
days, the court official said.
   Tachibana and Date were arrested in May 1987, along with Hiroshi
Osumi and Sadao Gotoh.
   Osumi, 67, was charged with stealing the documents from the
Yokota base library, where he worked, and selling them to Tachibana
for $74,400 between April 1986 and May 1987. Osumi was convicteed by
the District Court and sentenced to two years in prison.
   Tachibana, a military writer and former employee at another U.S.
air base in Japan, sold the documents to Date and Gotoh for $560,000.
   Date, who worked for a Chinese technical center, and Gotoh,
president of Sanko Ltd., a trading company doing business with
China, were charged with selling the information in the documents to
a Soviet official in Japan and a Chinese official in China.
   The District Court convicted Gotoh, 62, sentenced him to 18
months in prison and fined him $1,600. Osumi and Gotoh did not
appeal.
   Japan has no anti-espionage laws. The maximum penalty for theft
in Japan is 10 years in prison, and for purchase of stolen goods 10
years and a $1,600 fine.

   A bottlenose dolphin slipped away from
more than four dozen rescuers Wednesday when they tried to snare the
animal in a net and take it to warmer water.
   Rescuers in 13 boats, foiled by the dolphin a half-dozen times in
seven hours, decided to wait until Thursday to make another attempt.
   Robert Schoelkopf, who is heading the operation, said rescuers
were thwarted by strong currents and a frisky dolphin. ``He's not
weak at all. He's very robust, very spirited,'' said Schoelkopf,
director of the Marine Mammal Stranding Center in Brigantine, N.J.
   But he said the 6-foot animal, which weighs 200 pounds to 300
pounds, is still threatened by the chilly waters.
   It apparently was upset by a net thrown in the water to catch it,
he said.
   ``This is like a semisolid wall under water to this animal,'' he
said.
   Dozens of spectators watched the rescue effort from shore and
others looked on from private boats. Despite the repeated failures,
the dolphin cooperatively swam among the rescue boats.
   The rescue attempt took place on the picturesque Broad Bay in a
narrow channel that is near the Great Neck Bridge, one of two
bridges separating Broad Bay from the Chesapeake Bay. The area is
surrounded by luxury homes.
   Mayor Meyera Oberndorf watched from a boat. Four men in business
suits watched from another boat while talking, laughing and sipping
drinks from plastic cups.
   Josiah Woodington, a Broad Bay resident assisting in the rescue
effort, said, ``Anything we can do to help, we want to help. I think
that it's great that we can come together and catch this fish. ''
   The rescue effort, which included about 50 people, was authorized
Monday by the National Marine Fisheries Service. Rescuers hope to
capture the dolphin in the net and fly it to warmer waters off North
Carolina's Outer Banks.
   Residents have been lobbying for the rescue since the dolphin was
first noticed in the bay in early October.
   The dolphin, nicknamed ``Rascal'' by residents, was spotted again
in the bay Dec. 13, said Kathy Read, a diving instructor who has
worked on the rescue plans. The dolphin failed to join other
dolphins migrating south.
   Residents believe he stayed in the bay because he was frightened
of bridge construction in a narrow channel that links the bay and
open water.
   Schoelkopf said a rescue is risky, but the dolphin is certain to
die if left in the bay, where the water temperature has dipped to 42
degrees.

<HEAD>Woman Again Charged With Violating Order To Avoid Michael Jackson</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former legal secretary who claims to be
married to Michael Jackson pleaded innocent to violating a court
order to stay away from the pop singer's home.
   Lavon Muhammad, 40, who calls herself Billie Jean Jackson, has
been harassing Jackson for five years by loitering near his home and
misrepresenting herself as his wife, said Deputy City Attorney Davis
Kestenbaum.
   Miss Muhammad was arrested Friday for violating a restraining
order issued last year prohibiting her from loitering outside
Jackson's home in suburban Encino. She pleaded innocent to the
charge Tuesday, the prosecutor said.
   The woman was released on $5,000 bail and faces a Jan. 10 trial.
If convicted, she could be sentenced to up to one year in jail and
fined $1,000.
   Jackson secured the restraining order against Miss Muhammad, who
has been convicted three times of trespassing on Jackson's property.
   She was carrying a bottle of champagne when arrested in February
after scaling a backyard fence at 3 a.m. Miss Muhammad's most recent
arrest came Dec. 7 as she stood near Jackson's home, court records
show.
   The woman claims she was the inspiration for the singer's hit
song ``Billie Jean,'' about a woman of that name who claims she bore
Jackson's child. Miss Muhammad says Jackson, 30, fathered her
6-year-old twins.

   The night sky rained fire over a Scottish village
Wednesday after a Pan Am jumbo jet crashed with 258 people aboard,
setting buildings and cars ablaze.
   ``There was a terrible explosion and the whole sky lit up and the
sky was actually raining fire. It was just like liquid,'' said Mike
Carnahan, who was a few hundred yards from the scene.
   Witnesses said the plane hit a gasoline station.
   ``All I could see was flames and fire,'' Carnahan told British
Broadcasting Corp. television in a telephone interview. ``I could
see several houses on the skyline whose roofs were totally off, and
all you could see was flaming timbers and what was left of the
houses.''
   Another eyewitness, hotelier Graham Byerley, told the BBC:
   ``We initially heard a rumbling over the hotel. We thought the
roof was falling in, and then we heard a tremendous shudder on the
ground as though it were an earthquake, and then we saw sparks and
this enormous flame going 200 or 300 feet into the air. There was
debris flying everywhere.''
   Rescue helicopters buzzed overhead and firefighters fought the
flames.
   Police and rescue vehicles were held up by traffic as roads
leading to the site became jammed with motorists trying to get a
glimpse of the disaster.
   ``There's a lot of rescue services trying to get to the area but
the roads are blocked solid with cars and sightseers going over
toward the scene of the crash,'' Cranahan said.
   He said he believed the plane was on fire before it crashed
because ``it was trailing flames when it went over the village.''
   Witness John Glasgow said the crash and explosion littered
streets with debris.
   ``The whole road was ablaze. Two houses were blazing. The road
was completely covered with masonry, garden gates and apparently
parts of the plane, but not very big parts,'' Glasgow told
Independent Radio News. ``There was a lot of smoking debris on fire.
It looked as if the road as burning.''
   ``We tried to get near the plane but it was completely on fire.
There were no bodies about. I don't think there would be any chance
... It went up in a fireball.''
   Glasgow said the aircraft hit a road, kept going for about 1,500
yards and then exploded.
   The plane was bound from London to New York when it crashed.

   Atlanta educator Louis Sullivan sought to mend
fences with anti-abortion activists Wednesday in an effort to save
his expected nomination as President-elect Bush's health and human
services secretary.
   In a three-hour meeting with Bush advisers and Republican
anti-abortion leaders in Congress, Sullivan said he was an abortion
foe _ even favoring a constitutional amendment banning them _ rather
than a supporter of women's right to choose abortion, participants
in the meeting said.
   Sullivan's possible nomination drew protests from anti-abortion
groups after he was quoted last weekend in an interview with the
Atlanta Journal and Constitution as saying of abortion, ``There
should be that right.''
   But the senator and two congressmen he met with Wednesday liked
most of the answers he gave in their private meeting.
   Minnesota Rep. Vin Weber said he had asked Sullivan about the
interview, ``and he simply said that he was not used to dealing with
the press, and he stumbled badly in his own words in handling that
question. But I am convinced of his sincerity on that issue.''
   Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah, said in a statement that Sullivan
``would make a fine secretary of health and human services if he is
nominated. ... I believe he was misunderstood concerning his views
on abortion.''
   The third congressmen in the meeting, Rep. Christopher Smith of
New Jersey, said he was favorably impressed by Sullivan's answers.
But he added later, ``I'm encouraged but not fully convinced.''
   He said, for instance, that Sullivan did not seem ready to pledge
that he would oppose the use of government funds to pay for research
by the National Institutes of Health on fetal tissues.
   ``He was not fully square with our position on that,'' Smith said.
   Bush transition aides privately said that Sullivan remains the
vice president's top choice for the post.
   The aides, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said one
reason Bush has not been able to go ahead with an announcement on
Sullivan was that the FBI background check on him had not yet been
completed.
   Transition spokeswoman Sheila Tate said Sullivan's position, as
he outlined it Wednesday, ``is entirely consistent with and
compatible with that of the vice president on the issue of
abortion.''
   Sullivan, president of the Morehouse School of Medicine, would be
the first black in Bush's Cabinet. He left the meeting without
speaking to reporters.
   The vice president maintained a relatively low profile for the
second day in a row.
   He did meet with more than 40 prominent Republican Hispanics,
telling them there will be no ``radical shift in direction'' from
Reagan administration policies toward Cuba and Nicaragua.
   Marta San Martin, a member of New Jersey's ethnic advisory
council from Union, N.J., said Bush told the group in private that
he would ``not abandon the Contras,'' the U.S.-backed rebels in
Nicaragua.
   In his public remarks, Bush said the government in Cuba should
``take a lesson from (Soviet leader Mikhail) Gorbachev and start
lightening up.''
   Transition aides said Bush is likely to name a group of Cabinet
officials in one batch either Thursday or Friday, waiting until
after Christmas to complete the list. He has named eight Cabinet
members and has six to go: HHS, transportation, interior, energy,
labor and veterans affairs.
   Meanwhile, Bush advisers told Chicago transit official Samuel
Skinner to return home because announcement of his nomination as
transportation secretary was being delayed yet again while decisions
on prospects for other posts were being made.
   Skinner has been back and forth between Chicago and Washington
three times awaiting the formal announcement. Aides said his
nomination was not hung up, but that Bush did not want to announce
it separately.
   Skinner did draw fire from Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio,
concerning his conduct as a federal prosecutor in Chicago in the
late 1970s.
   Metzenbaum said in a statement that the Senate should not vote to
confirm Skinner without investigating ``why (he) failed to pursue
allegations of fraudulent testing of NutraSweet'' against G.D.
Searle Co. and later joined the law firm that defended Searle in the
case.
   When Metzenbaum first raised the issue in 1986, Skinner was
quoted as saying he had withdrawn from participating in the case
shortly after his office received a formal Food and Drug
Administration request for a grand jury investigation of Searle. He
said his actions were consistent with Justice Department
conflict-of-interest policies.
   A transition source said Patricia Diaz Dennis is a leading
candidate for the labor post but that Bush aides don't know her
positions on various labor issues. The source said members of the
transition team have been speaking with those who have worked with
her and will probably call her in Australia, where she is
vacationing.
   As for Sullivan, Rep. Weber said, ``I am convinced his position
is fully consistent with Vice President Bush's: that he believes
life begins at conception, that he is opposed to abortion except in
cases of rape, incest and where the mother's life in in danger, and
that he supports a human life amendment to overturn the Roe vs. Wade
decison.''
   It was that 1973 decision that prohibited states from banning
abortion in the first trimester of pregnancy.
   During the campaign, Bush said he supported a constitutional
amendment to ban abortion except in cases of rape, incest or to save
the life of the mother.
   Bush's transition office also announced several top White House
staff jobs on Wednesday. David Demarest, former Labor Department
spokesman and Bush campaign communications chief, will serve as
White House communications director. Texas Air executive Frederick
McClure, who worked in the Reagan congressional liaison office, was
named legislative affairs liaison. Retired Air Force Col. Antonio
Lopez will serve as director of the White House military office, and
Rose Zamaria will be director of White House operations.

   President-elect Bush told a group of prominent
Hispanic-Americans Wednesday there would be no ``radical shift in
direction'' as his new administration takes office.
   Bush, in a meeting with more than 40 Republicans of Hispanic
origin, also said Nicaragua ``continues to plague me.'' One of the
group's participants said Bush promised that he would not abandon
the Nicaraguan Contras, the U.S.-backed rebels seeking to overthrow
the leftist government there.
   The group cheered Bush when he said he would place ``a lot of
Hispanic-Americans in high office'' in the new administration. So
far, Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos, a holdover appointee, is the
only member of the ethnic group to be named to a top-level job.
   On foreign policy, Bush said, ``There is no anticipated surprise.
... There will not be under a Bush administration a radical shift in
direction in terms of one of our neighboring countries to the south
that concerns many people in this room.'' That was a reference to
Cuba.
   Taking a hard line, Bush said he wanted to have ``some solid
proof not some rhetoric'' that Cuba intends to promote democracy. He
called for an end to surrogacy by the Soviet Union.
   Cuba's government should ``take a lesson from (Soviet leader
Mikhail) Gorbachev and start lightening up,'' Bush said. Gorbachev
has recently promoted policies of openness and restructuring in his
country.
   Bush praised Cuba for allowing human rights officials to visit
the island recently, but he said the country has a ``long way to
go'' before the principles of democracy are in place.
   Marta San Martin, a member of New Jersey's ethnic advisory
council from Union, N.J., said Bush told the group in private that
he would ``not abandon the Contras.''
   Members of Congress have hinted that James A. Baker III, the
designated secretary of state, has told them the new administration
will not seek aid for the Contras immediately in 1989, but will
first explore other options to achieve peace in Nicaragua.
   Among the others in the group were Hugo Menendez, Florida's
secretary of state; Rep. Manuel Lujan, R-N.Mex., and Katherine
Ortega, the U.S. treasurer.

   Democratic Party activist Ron Brown pocketed
endorsements Wednesday from New York Gov. Mario Cuomo and New Jersey
Sen. Bill Bradley in his bid to become the party's next national
chairman.
   Cuomo, who once taught Brown at St. John's University Law School,
said his former student would be ``superb'' as head of the
Democrats. Bradley said Brown would bring ``even-handed, fair and
strong leadership in the years ahead.''
   Neither Cuomo nor Bradley has a vote in the election to choose a
new party leader next February, but both are influential with
Democratic National Committee members from their own states and are
well-known nationally.
   Shortly after Cuomo issued his endorsement, New York Democratic
chairman Laurence J. Kirwan, an ally of the governor, said he would
vote for Brown.
   ``These endorsements, and the support I have received from other
leaders of the party, also indicate that the next generation of
Democratic leaders see my candidacy as a commitment to the future of
the party as well as to its traditional values,'' Brown said in a
statement after getting backing from Cuomo and Bradley.
   Brown is one of five contenders in the race to replace outgoing
party chairman Paul Kirk. The others include Michigan Democratic
chairman Richard Wiener and former Reps. Jim Jones of Oklahoma, Mike
Barnes of Maryland and Jim Stanton of Ohio.
   Jones also announced several endorsements Wednesday.
   Scott Widmeyer, aide to Jones, said he received the backing of
Reps. John Lewis of Georgia and Ike Skelton of Missouri and also
Louisiana Gov. Buddy Roemer.
   Brown is best known for serving as Jesse Jackson's top aide at
last summer's Democratic National Convention, but he has also worked
for Sen. Edward M. Kennedy and was active in Michael Dukakis'
presidential campaign this fall after Jackson was defeated for the
nomination. He served as deputy chairman of the Democratic National
Committee from 1981 to 1985.
   He earlier was endorsed by Kennedy and former Arizona Gov. Bruce
Babbitt, and his strategy of emphasizing support by prominent
Democrats is in contrast to the approach taken by Wiener.
   The Michigan chairman has made public the names of party chairs
and vice chairs from several states in the West and Midwest who have
endorsed him. Few if any of them are known outside their states, but
all will have a vote in the election to pick the next chairman, and
they reflect Wiener's natural base among state party leaders. He is
the head of the Association of State Democratic Chairs.
   The Democratic National Committee will meet on Feb. 9-10 to pick
a successor to Kirk.

<HEAD>Reagan's Final Budget Said To Be Better Than Gramm-Rudman Target</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan's final budget would reduce
the deficit to $92.5 billion for the next fiscal year, even lower
than the target set by law, through a combination of spending cuts,
higher user fees and sales of government assets, administration
officials said Wednesday.
   Officials said all of the decisions have now been made on the
budget, which the administration will send to Congress on Jan. 9.
   Reagan and members of his Cabinet, including President-elect
Bush, were briefed on the budget details at the White House.
   ``We are going to have a budget that we will be presenting to the
Congress very shortly and it will be in keeping with the
Gramm-Rudman program for leading toward a balanced budget,'' Reagan
told reporters as the meeting opened.
   Joseph Wright, head of the White House Office of Management and
Budget, told reporters at a briefing that the administration had
succeeded in trimming the deficit below the $100 billion target
established by the Gramm-Rudman balanced budget law.
   While Wright would not reveal the actual deficit figure, an
administration source, who spoke on condition that his name not be
used, said Reagan's final budget would show a deficit of $92.5
billion.
   This figure includes $6 billion in asset sales, the source said.
These sales do not count toward meeting the Gramm-Rudman target.
However, even with the asset sales discounted, the administration's
budget would still be below the $100 billion target.
   In the past, Reagan's budgets often have been labeled ``dead on
arrival'' when they were submitted to Congress because they proposed
spending cuts that Congress repeatedly had refused to accept in the
past.
   But Wright defended the final Reagan budget, saying it would
serve as a good starting point for the new Bush administration in
its negotiations with Congress.
   ``We did not have to do a slash and burn budget,'' he said. ``It
is reasonable, responsible and conservative.''
   The budget calls for spending $1.15 trillion, an increase of 4.7
percent over projected spending of $1.097 trillion in the current
fiscal year. The administration is projecting that government
revenues will increase by $82 billion in 1990 to $1.056 trillion.
   The administration unveiled new budget estimates that will make
its job of reaching the deficit target a bit easier. The
administration had been forecasting a deficit of $135 billion if no
changes were made from the current level of government services.
   However, Wright told reporters that revised assumptions on how
the economy will perform and various changes in spending projections
had lowered that estimated deficit to $127 billion.
   But Wright said the administration would call for $2.6 billion in
increased defense spending because of its insistence that the
military be funded at 2 percent above the rate of inflation. He said
the administration also would seek $1.8 billion in higher spending
for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, in part for
spending on the space station project, and $5 billion in higher
outlays for such programs as research on a cure for AIDS.
   To achieve the increased spending will require the administration
to make cuts in other programs of $38 billion.
   It has been reported previously that the administration would
seek to cut Medicare by $5 billion by reducing payments to doctors
and hospitals. In addition, the administration is seeking savings of
$2 billion in the Medicaid program which pays the health costs of
poor patients.
   Wright also has said other savings would be achieved through
cutting farm subsidy payments and in reducing government pension
benefits.
   However, the administration has insisted that Social Security,
the government's largest benefit program, will not be touched in
efforts to trim the budget deficit.
   In addition to coming in lower than the Gramm-Rudman deficit
target for 1990, the spending plan projects the deficit will decline
significantly in coming years until it reaches a balance between
spending and revenues in 1993, nine years later than the 1984 target
for a balanced budget that Reagan had promised to reach during his
1980 campaign for the presidency.
   Bush has promised to begin immediate negotiations with Congress
over ways to reduce the budget deficit once he takes office on Jan.
20. He has said he also will submit his own spending blueprint to
Congress, although he has left open the question of whether he will
submit a completely revised budget request or just make
modifications to Reagan's 1990 budget.

   Chicago transit official Samuel Skinner,
reported to be in line for transportation secretary, is getting a
closeup look at the nation's air traffic system as he awaits formal
announcement from President-elect Bush.
   In less than two weeks, Skinner has been summoned three times to
the nation's capital by Bush transition aides. Three times he has
gone home empty-handed. Though Skinner has been told he has the job
of running the Transportation Department, sources said, the official
announcement from the president-elect has not yet been made.
   ``Poor Sam,'' said one Bush transition aide, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   Sheila Tate, the transition's spokeswoman, said Wednesday she did
not know when Bush would made additional personnel announcements.
   The latest snafu involving Skinner occurred Tuesday after
transition aides had put out the word that Bush would make an
announcement, which was expected to involve Skinner.
   Skinner, 50, a private attorney who worked in Bush's presidential
campaigns in 1980 and 1988, had been in the capital since Monday
awaiting a summons from Bush.
   A few hours before Bush was expected to make an announcement, it
was cancelled. Transition aides said Bush wanted to make a batch of
appointments at the same time, but his choice for secretary of
health and human services was mired in a debate over his views on
abortion.
   So Skinner flew back to Chicago Tuesday night _ empty-handed
again.
   Skinner's spokesman in Chicago, Ed Murnane, said his boss is
unperturbed by the situation. ``Sam Skinner is a very patient and
understanding friend of President-elect Bush's,'' he said.
   Another source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
situation has been somewhat anxiety-producing for Skinner. ``He
hasn't had any chance to do any Christmas shopping yet,'' this
person said.
   But Skinner has been assured he has the job, the source said,
adding: ``I don't think he is being Tower-ized.''
   That was a reference to former Sen. John Tower who was rumored to
have the defense secretary's job but was left dangling for weeks
while the FBI investigated allegations of drinking and womanizing.
Bush finally appointed Tower last Friday.
   Skinner also traveled to Washington on Dec. 8 to meet with
transition aides, and flew in for a face-to-face session with Bush
on Dec. 14.
   Skinner is chairman of the Regional Transportation Authority of
Northeastern Illinois, the nation's second largest transportation
system.
   Meanwhile, Skinner's expected nomination drew fire from Sen.
Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, concerning his conduct as a former
federal prosecutor in Chicago.
   Metzenbaum said in a statement that the Senate should look into
why the U.S. attorney's office in Chicago decided against
prosecuting the maker of NutraSweet, G.D. Searle Co., for
``allegations of fraudulent testing.'' Skinner, then the U.S.
attorney, later joined the law firm that defended Searle in the case.
   Metzenbaum, who first raised the issue in 1986, said there were
``serious questions about Mr. Skinner's conduct of the case that
must be answered.'' At the time, Skinner said he withdrew from
participating in the case after his office received the formal Food
and Drug Administration request for a grand jury because he was
discussing a job with the law firm in question.
   Skinner's office issued a statement saying he ``conducted himself
in accordance with Department of Justice guidelines in the matter
mentioned by Senator Metzenbaum.'' Skinner will be happy to answer
any questions senators have about the case, the statement said.

   Three distributors are voluntarily recalling
several small toys because of the potential choking and other
hazards they pose to young children, the Consumer Product Safety
Commission said Wednesday.
   The recalled toys are a safety pin rattle sold by Fiber-Craft
Materials Corp. of Niles, Ill.; plastic racing cars, planes and
cycles from Acme Premium Supply Corp. of St. Louis, and wind-up
puppies, planes, trains, helicopters, turtles, frogs and ``Klacker
Balls'' from Lil Mort Sales of Chicago.
   The commission said adults should take the toys away from
children and destroy the toys or return them to the stores where
they were bought for a refund.
   The commission's announcement did not mention any reports of
injuries.
   Here are some details on each item:

   The four-inch-long rattle was made of blue, pink or yellow
plastic and shaped like a safety pin. Bearing model No. 4642, the
rattles were sold in craft stores as decorations.
   The commission said the rattles are small enough to fit into an
infant's mouth and long enough possibly to reach into the back of
the throat and possibly cause choking.

   The toys are made of plastic in red, blue, yellow, green, orange
or purple. They were distributed as prizes at carnivals and fairs,
in packages indicating they were not suitable for children under age
3. All have small black single or double wheels on axles that snap
into underside slots. The commission said the wheel might present a
choking hazard.
   _``Racing Car'' bears model No. C805 and is 3 inches long.
   _``Supersonic Jetplane'' bears model No. C822 and is 4} inches

   The toys all have small parts that could come off and become a
choking hazard, the commission said.
   _``Stretch Tail Puppies,'' Model 3228DB, are 8 inches long of
brown and white plastic on small red wheels, with the tail attached
to a string that activates the wheels. The ears could come off, the
commission said.
   _``Whistling Funny Action'' toys, 3 inches long, are multicolored
plastic wind-up airplanes, helicopters and railroad engines. Wheels,
propellers and wind-up keys could come off, the commission said.
   _``Busy Animals'' are frogs and turtles standing 5 inches tall,
made of green, orange and yellow plastic. The frog's arm and key may
dislodge; the turtle's feet may break off, the commission said.
   _``Klacker Balls'' are pairs of colored, solid plastic balls.
each 1 1@3 inch in diameter, attached to each end of a braided
cord. They make a loud noise when clapped together. The balls could
come off the string and hurt bystanders, the commission said.

<HEAD>Congression Panel To Investigate RJR Nabisco Takeover</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A congressional panel on Wednesday revealed it
has launched a broad investigation into the multibillion-dollar
leveraged buyout of RJR Nabisco Inc.
   Rep. John D. Dingell, D-Mich., chairman of the House Energy and
Commerce Committee, asked RJR Nabisco President F. Ross Johnson and
nine members of the company's board of directors to supply documents
and submit to interviews.
   A management group headed by Johnson lost out to the investment
firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co., which bid a record $24.5 billion
for RJR Nabisco, a diversified food and tobacco products firm.
   Dingell, in letters dated Wednesday, asked for voluntary
cooperation with the investigation into the leveraged buyout, or
LBO, but said his oversight and investigations subcommittee could
issue subpoenas.
   The subcommittee ``is conducting an investigation into the
application and adequacy of the federal securities laws in
connection with the recent offers to purchase RJR Nabisco Inc.,''
Dingell wrote.
   He asked for information ``pertaining to any discussion,
consideration or analysis regarding a possible or actual offer''
from Johnson and RJR Nabisco management and ``regarding other
alternatives for raising the value or market price of the company's
stock.''
   He asked for copies of documents by Jan. 13 and requested that
the executives travel to Washington to be interviewed by
congressional aides by Feb. 3.
   Dennis Fitzgibbons, a spokesman for Dingell, declined to discuss
the subcommittee's reasons for examining the transaction, but said
Dingell ``has been concerned with LBOs for quite some time. This is
part of an effort to find out what is going on, not just with RJR
Nabisco, but with LBOs in general and what, if anything, Congress
can or should do about it.''
   In a leveraged buyout, an investment group borrows heavily in
order to buy out stockholders and take over the company. Often
leveraged buyouts are proposed by managers seeking to thwart a
hostile takeover from another firm.
   The company's new owners either cut costs or sell off pieces of
the company to pay back the loans. Critics of the practice fear the
high debt levels, in an economic downturn, would endanger both the
company and the banks and investment firms making the loans. They
also say the transactions are unfair because they dilute the
potential claims of existing bondholders.
   Meanwhile, Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman David S.
Ruder, in a letter to the Energy and Commerce finance subcommittee,
chaired by Rep. Edward J. Markey, D-Mass., said the SEC has begun
``a broad fact gathering effort ... including a study of some of the
largest leveraged buyouts of recent years.''
   ``In particular, the staff will focus on the exposure of
broker-dealers and investment banking firms providing bridge
financing in leveraged acquisitions,'' he said.
   The agency also will examine the adequacy of its disclosure
rules, designed to warn existing bondholders and other investors of
any risks in LBOs.
   Ruder is scheduled to testify regarding LBOs to Markey's
subcommittee on Thursday.

   A judge who said he gave a killer a lesser sentence
in part because the victims were homosexual has divided the city's
religious leaders, with one group Wednesday demanding a retraction
and another planning a rally of support.
   Ken Coulter, pastor of Grace Fellowship Church and part of a
coalition of leaders of churches with large numbers of gay
congregants, said they fear that state District Judge Jack Hampton's
remarks may mean ``open season'' on homosexuals.
   Meanwhile, the Rev. Don Skelton, pastor at Fountain of The Living
Word, said at least seven pastors have agreed to take part in a
rally in support of Hampton on Thursday outside the courthouse. He
said he expected 100 to 150 people.
   ``We're very much opposed to sodomy,'' Skelton said. ``It's
against Texas law for one thing and God's law for another thing.''
Sodomy carries up to a $200 fine. The law was thrown out in 1982 but
reinstated by a federal appeals court three years later.
   Hampton, in an interview last week in the Dallas Times Herald,
said he sentenced 18-year-old Richard Lee Bednarski to 30 years in
prison instead of the maximum life sentence on Nov. 28 in part
because the two murder victims were ``queers.''
   He was quoted as saying he ``put prostitutes and gays at about
the same level'' and would be ``hard put to give somebody life for
killing a prostitute.''
   The remarks have stirred the gay community and equal rights
activists to protest and to seek Hampton's removal from the bench.
On Tuesday, state Treasurer Ann Richards and Sen. Edward Kennedy,
D-Mass., criticized him in statements read at a rally.
   The Texas Human Rights Foundation has filed an ethics complaint
with the Commission on Judicial Conduct. The panel can, among other
things, censure him or initiate a drawn-out procedure that could
result in his removal.
   The church coalition deploring Hampton's remarks on Wednesday
called on other religious leaders, judges and lawyers to join them
in criticizing the judge.
   ``We ... deplore the mentality recently expressed by Judge Jack
Hampton in the press, which suggest that all human beings are not of
equal value and are not entitled to equal protection under the
law,'' said the Rev. Howard Tyas, pastor of Bethany Presbyterian
Church, reading from the group's statement.
   The church leaders said they were asking him to retract his
comments. They said any further action would be up to ``the system.''
   ``If this is not what he means, we are asking him to speak up and
say this is not what I mean,'' said the Rev. Lou Arceneaux, pastor
at Holy Trinity Catholic Church.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz told a
delegation of American Jewish leaders Wednesday he believes the
formation of a new coalition government in Israel could provide
momementum to the Middle East peace process, a participant in the
meeting said.
   Reporting on the meeting, Morris Abram, chairman of the
Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations,
said the secretary feels that the newly formed Likud-Labor coalition
was better for the peace process than a ``narrowly based
government.''
   Much of the meeting, which lasted more than an hour, focused on
Shultz's decision last week to open a dialogue with the Palestine
Liberation Organization.
   Abram said the meeting was held to express the ``very deep
concerns'' of American Jewish leaders about recent administration
moves in the Middle East.
   He indicated that the delegation came away reassured by what
Shultz had to say.
   Abram said Shultz told the delegation that the initial contacts
last week with the PLO did not constitute negotiations but ``a very
low level dialogue.''
   He added that Shultz is not pressing Israel to undertake any
dealings with the PLO.
   Abram indicated he disagreed with suggestions by some State
Department officials that the statement last week by PLO Chairman
Yasser Arafat recognizing Israel's right to exist, in effect,
superceded the policy enshrined in the PLO covenant calling for
Israel's destruction.
   Abram said the only way the PLO could legitimately retreat from
that policy would be for the Palestine National Council to amend the
charter.
   Shultz agreed, Abram said, that he ``would like to see that
done.''
   ``The secretary was extremely firm in his statement that nothing
whatsoever had changed with respect to American policy with respect
to the Middle East and the state of Israel,'' Abram said.
   ``He reaffirmed the following: this government does not want an
independent Palestinian state and he laid out the reasons, saying
that such a state would be unstable and would be a threat not only
to Israel but to the whole area.
   ``He stated, furthermore, that the policy of the United States
government remained very firm that Jerusalem should remain a united
city. He spoke passionately of his abhorrence of terrorism, and his
determination that terrorism must cease.''

<HEAD>Rehnquist Reinstates Contempt Citation Against Maryland Woman</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist on Wednesday
reinstated a contempt citation against a Maryland woman jailed for
refusing to disclose the whereabouts of her young son, who
prosecutors fear may be dead.
   Rehnquist, acting on an emergency request by state prosecutors,
negated the effect of a ruling by Maryland's highest court that
Jacqueline Bouknight's jailing for contempt is unconstitutional.
   But Ms. Bouknight was destined to remain behind bars no matter
what action Rehnquist took.
   Prosecutors disclosed Tuesday they had independent grounds for
keeping Ms. Bouknight incarcerated. They told the chief justice she
was convicted on Nov. 28 of theft, and sentenced to 18 months in
jail.
   Ms. Bouknight, 21, was cited for contempt last April after
refusing to tell social workers in Baltimore where they could find
her 27-month-old son, Maurice.
   A judge ordered her jailed until she was willing to provide that
information.
   The child earlier had been placed in foster care after being
hospitalized for treatment of a broken leg and several partially
healed fractures.
   Maurice was returned to Ms. Bouknight, who has a history of drug
abuse, after she agreed not to physically punish him and to undergo
training in how to be a parent.
   Social workers say Maurice has not been seen since September 1987.
   The boy's father has been killed.
   The Maryland Court of Appeals earlier this week ruled, by a 5-2
vote, that Ms. Bouknight's jailing on the contempt citation violated
her constitutional protection against self-incrimination.
   ``The state readily acknowledges that Bouknight's risk of
incriminating herself is a substantial one, encompassing among other
possible crimes the felony of child abuse or even murder,'' the
state court said.
   Prosecutors contend that protecting the child outweighs Ms.
Bouknight's right against self-incrimination, and that she should
remain jailed until she cooperates with authorities.
   Rehnquist, in an order accompanied by a four-page opinion, set
aside the state court ruling pending full Supreme Court action on a
formal appeal to be filed by Maryland prosecutors.
   The case is Baltimore City Department of Social Services vs.
Bouknight, A-494.

   A terrified 8-year-old girl who called a
911 operator watched a burglar stab her father and initially refused
to unlock the front door for police, a tape recording of the
conversation shows.
   Police said the 11-minute conversation between dispatcher Valerie
Nelson and the girl, Laura Hollingsworth, allowed the operator to
get help to the family quickly.
   Laura, who was taught in school to call 911 in an emergency,
spoke to Mrs. Nelson as the family tried to fight off the
knife-wielding stranger Dec. 14.
   ``She was very clear considering the emotional state she was
in,'' Mrs. Nelson said. ``She was not hysterical.''
   The intruder, Douglas Spencer Collins, 19, died of a shot from a
hunting rifle, police said.
   Dale Hollingsworth, 36, Laura's father, was stabbed in the head,
arms and hands and was listed in good condition Wednesday at
Arlington Memorial Hospital. Laura's 14-year-old brother, Buddy, was
treated for stab wounds on a hand.
   Laura, according to the tape played on Monday, told Mrs. Nelson
where she lived and that the intruder was demanding to know where to
find a wallet.
   According to the tape, Laura told Mrs. Nelson the intruder ``just
broke in with a gun,'' apparently mistaking the knife for a gun.
   When the child saw that her father was ``covered with blood,''
her voice took on an additional urgency as she pleaded, ``Hurry, I'm
scared.''
   The tape continued:
   Mrs. Nelson: ``OK. I have an ambulance, honey, don't worry. We
have people on the way.''
   Laura, suddenly whispering: ``I think he's got the guy.''
   Mrs. Nelson: ``Who's got the guy?''
   The only response was screaming and sobbing in the background.
   Mrs. Nelson: ``Honey? It's OK. What's going on?''
   Laura: ``He's got a knife!''
   Mrs. Nelson: ``Who does? Your brother?''
   Laura, sobbing: ``No! The guy. Pleeeaaase! Oh, God! Buddy!''
   The conversation was cut of by the sound of a rifle shot, and
then Laura could be heard whispering: ``Oh. Oh, he killed the guy.''
   Mrs. Nelson: ``OK, who got shot? Your father got shot? Honey! Can
you tell me who got shot?''
   Laura: ``He (Buddy) shot the guy that came in here.''
   During several minutes of painstaking conversation, Mrs. Nelson
confirmed that the intruder was dead or dying and that the child's
father and Buddy were injured. Mrs. Nelson also realized the
children thought police officers outside the home were more burglars.
   The exchange went on several more minutes, with Buddy and Laura
distrusting what they were being told because they could not see any
police cars and because one officer had a youthful voice.
   Several minutes later, though, the officers were allowed into the
house.
   Mrs. Nelson said she is used to handling dramatic situations, but
the exchange with Laura was by far the most compelling.

<HEAD>Poliburo Shaken Up, Ban on Solidarity To Be Reviewed</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: UPDATES throughout with Jaruzelski and Rakowski speeches,
party told to reconsider Solidarity. No pickup</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DANISZEWSKI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Polish leader Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski made
sweeping changes in the ruling Politburo Wednesday, and Communist
authorities gave their clearest signal yet they are considering
ending a seven-year ban on Solidarity.
   Prime Minister Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski announced that the
Communist Party will reevaluate its attitude toward the outlawed
trade union federation.
   Rakowski told Central Committee members to return to local party
units and poll members on the subject of Solidarity and on its
leader, Lech Walesa.
   Members were ordered to return to Warsaw in mid-January with
their answers at the next session of the 230-member Central
Committee.
   ``We must decide together about what to do,'' Rakowski said.
``Your answer ... will decide about what we will do. And what we do
will decide the future of socialism in Poland,'' he said.
   In the Communist Party shakeup, Jaruzelski removed six hardliners
and veteran members from the Politburo in favor of younger
pragmatists.
   Among those promoted to full Politburo membership was Stanislaw
Ciosek, a party activist known as a liberal who has been active in
conducting talks with Walesa. Ciosek was also given an important
additional post of full party secretary, where he was expected to
assume responsibility for propaganda.
   In all, eight new Politburo members were appointed to replace six
who were removed, increasing the Politburo's overall size from 15 to
17 members. Four new party secretaries were named, replacing four
who were removed.
   The plenum was capped by Jaruzelski's plea to the opposition to
accept the party's offer for talks.
   Referring to the opposition's formation on Sunday of a Citizens
Committee intended to gather mainstream anti-government forces in
one structure under Walesa's leadership, Jaruzelski said:
   ``One can freely create governments in exile or shadow Cabinets,
... but the real reconcilation of Poles is the cause of supreme
importance. Our party opts for it decisively and honestly.''
   The offer for talks is ``unchangeably'' open, he said.
   Walesa refuses to enter talks with the government until
authorities clearly indicate they are willing to make Solidarity
legal again.
   The labor movement was crushed when martial law was imposed here
in 1981 and was later outlawed.
   Rakowski defended the idea of holding talks with Walesa in his
address to the plenum, and said _ in an evident overture to
Solidarity _ that the party is willing to change the structure of
trade unions. When, and under what terms must yet be negotiated.
   He repeated calls for the opposition to begin talks without
preconditions.
   ``We are saying clearly that we desire to discuss the future
model of the trade union movement _ different from the present _
together with the OPZZ (official unions) and moderate leaders of
former Solidarity,'' he said.
   ``The realization of (union) pluralism depends, however, on
reaching agreement about its principles, forms and time.''
   Whether Rakowski's statement would be enough to bring Solidarity
activists to the negotiating table was not clear. No immediate
reaction came from Walesa, whose telephone in Gdansk was not being
answered Wednesday night.
   Ciosek, the new Politburo member, met three times with Walesa
this year in failed attempts to launch formal roundtable talks with
the opposition.
   During Solidarity's legal existence in 1980-81, he was the
government minister in charge of cooperating with trade unions.
   Three people were named candidate members of the Politburo in
voting at the end of the plenum.
   Besides Ciosek, the new party secretaries were Zygmunt Czarzasty,
the Slupsk province party chief who had developed a reputation as a
strong advocate of pragmatic reforms; Leszek Miller, a young party
chief from the province of Skierniewice; and Marian Stepien, a
high-ranking party ideologist.
   Ousted from the Politburo were former Prime Minister Zbigniew
Messner, who had to resign from the government in September amid
criticism of his handling of the economy; Gen. Jozef Baryla, an army
colleague of Jaruzelski; Jan Glowczyk, a former propaganda chief
with a reputation as a hardliner; and three lesser known Politburo
members: Tadeusz Porebski, Zofia Stepien and Zygmunt Muranski.
   The new Politburo members, besides Ciosek, were Gabriela Rebisz,
Kazimierz Cypryniak, Iwona Lubowska, Zdzidlaw Swiatek, Viktor
Pyrkosz, Janusz Reykowski and Zbigniew Michalek. Aside from Ciosek,
the new appointees are little known and two of them _ Pyrkosz and
Reykowski _ had not even been members of the Central Committee
before.
   But Jaruzelski suggested they represented a new generation of
activists.
   ``Life itself, its needs and challenges dictate unavoidable and
necessary changes,'' he said.
   Jaruzelski had said personnel changes were necessary for the
success of party reforms.
   He said in opening the plenum Tuesday that the party should be
open to unconventional compromises with the opposition but it must
remain Poland's ``key political force.''

   President Raul Alfonsin appealed
on Wednesday for an end to the animosities between the military and
the civilian government that underlay three insurrections in the
last 20 months.
   Speaking forcefully and at times with passion, Alfonsin spoke
before a packed, special session of Congress in a nationally
broadcast speech.
   ``The tensions between the armed forces and the powers of the
state are a problem that had to be presented,'' he said. ``The
military transition is everyone's task.''
   Later, Alfonsin named Gen. Francisco Gassino as army chief to
replace Lt. Gen. Jose Dante Caridi, who resigned Tuesday along with
the next two ranking army generals, Miguel Abbate and Enrique
Bianchi.
   Gassino's promotion forced into retirement four generals who
outranked him in seniority, bringing to eight the number of generals
who resigned or were retired after the latest military rebellion
ended on Dec. 4. Gassino, 57, played a major role in quashing that
uprising and strongly sided with Alfonsin during the April 1987 and
January 1988 garrison revolts.
   Alfonsin said military-civilian stresses in Argentine society
stem largely from harsh actions to end terrorist subversion in the
late 1970s, and for that all society is to blame, not just its
soldiers.
   However, in a reference to the 1976-83 military dictatorship
which ended with his inauguration in December 1983, Alfonsin said,
``That which neither the government nor the people are disposed to
grant is the vindication of state terrorism.''
   Both the governing Radical Civic Union and the opposition
Peronist Party have stressed that they would not propose or allow
Congress to pass amnesty legislation for crimes dating from the
``dirty war'' against subversion.
   The president said Argentines need to create a new, democratic
future, not rehash violent incidents of the past. Toward that end,
citizens should accept the necessity of the armed forces, and the
military should accept their subordination to civilian rule.
   He said the question of blame ``should be the task ... of
historians.''
   Alfonsin made little direct reference to the Dec. 1-4
insurrection of up to 800 army troops, to Caridi's departure or to
charges that the government made a deal with rebels.
   Congressmen of various political parties described the speech as
positive, though some grumbled it failed to address such specific
questions as how extensive was support among loyal troops for rebel
demands and whether a deal was in fact struck to end the revolt.
   ``The message ... contains a declaration of principles in which
we all coincide, but nothing was said about what happened,''
complained Sen. Eduardo Menem, the Peronist leader in the upper
house and brother of Carlos Menem, the Peronist presidential nominee
in elections next May.
   Sen. Leopoldo Bravo of the small, conservative Bloquista Party,
who has publicly called for a military amnesty, said Alfonsin ``did
not come up with solutions that would permit a vision of hope for
the future.''
   Rebels led by Col. Mohamed Ali Seineldin demanded a halt to the
prosecution of officers for human rights abuses committed in the
late 1970s during what they refer to as the civil war against
subversion.
   Human rights groups say the arrest and presumed execution of at
least 8,900 Argentines, by government count, amounted to organized
murder. Other estimates put the number of ``disappeared'' at up to
30,000.
   Rebels also demanded a shakeup of the military high command,
including Caridi's ouster; higher salaries and a bigger military
budget.
   Alfonsin insists he made no deal. Nevertheless, soldiers were
granted a 20 percent pay increase this month and a $100 bonus.
   Eight generals have been ousted, and high government officials
have spoken publicly of the ``dirty war'' as necessary, lending
credence to military arguments that human rights trials should stop.
   The trials in civilian court of about a dozen officers, including
former President and army Commander-in-Chief Leopoldo Galtieri, are
due to resume soon after a lapse of about a year.

   A New York-bound jumbo jet carrying 258 Christmas
travelers crashed in a Scottish village Wednesday night, sending up
a towering ball of flame and raining burning debris on houses and
cars.
   Four hours after the Pan Am Boeing 747 crashed at Lockerbie in
southwest Scotland, there was no word of survivors among the
passengers, some of them U.S. servicemen according to unconfirmed
reports.
   ``We understand that there were no survivors from the aircraft,''
said Bill Robson, chief ambulance officer for greater Glasgow. The
Royal Air Force and the Department of Transport also had no reports
of survivors.
   Nine or 10 bodies were recovered about two miles from the scene,
according to a reporter for the British news agency, Press
Association.
   Les Callaghan, spokesman for Dumfries and Galloway Royal
Infirmary, said the hospital treated about 12 casualties, apparently
all local people injured when the plane plunged into the village of
2,500.
   The cause of the crash was not immediately known. The Civil
Aviation Authority said Scottish air controllers talked to the
cockpit minutes before the crash and got no indication of any
problems.
   Pan Am Flight 103 took off from Heathrow Airport outside London
at 1:25 p.m. EST and disappeared off radar screens an hour later,
said Pat Coffey, spokesman for the RAF Rescue Coordination Center
near Edinburgh.
   One witness said the plane may have been on fire before it
crashed, and others said the plane hit a gas station and several
houses in the southern Scotland village, which is 275 miles
northwest of London.
   Independent Television News said witnesses reported seeing two
separate fireballs about three miles apart, but there was no report
from aviation authorities that another aircraft was involved in the
crash.
   ``There was a terrible explosion,'' said Mike Carnahan, who was a
few hundred yards from the scene. ``It was literally raining fire,''
he told British Broadcasting Corp. TV. ``I don't think there is any
chance of survivors. The way it exploded was just beyond
description.''
   Coffey also said there were no reports of any survivors. He
estimated 15 RAF helicopters with burn specialists were sent to the
scene.
   ``We tried to get near the plane but it was completely on fire,
witness John Glasglow told Independent Radio News. ``There were no
bodies about. I don't think there would be any chance of anyone
getting out of it.''
   Lef Callaghan, spokesman at Dumfries Hospital, told Cable News
Network there were 12 casualties on the ground.
   Wallace Trail, a BBC producer who was in the village when the
plane crashed, said it was ``in chaos at the moment. All the roads
in and out of the town are blocked and telephones are down and there
are a string of burning houses along the south end of the town.
   ``I counted at least seven and there is a large crater at the
edge of the main dual carriageway, the A74, the Glasgow-Carlisle
road.''
   Ian Fisher, a reporter for Independent Television News, said:
``The south side of the town near to the main road has been wiped
out. Houses have been gutted ... There is a huge pall of smoke
hanging over the sky which is lit from the burning houses below.''
   Syracuse University officials confirmed an undetermined number of
its studennts were on the flight. A U.N. spokesman said the U.N.
commissioner for Namibia, Bernt Carlsson of Sweden, 50, also was
aboard.
   TV networks broadcast emergency telephone numbers in London and
New York for relatives' inquiries. The House of Commons convened for
a late-night emergency statement by Transport Secretary Paul Channon.
   ``There is no speculation at this point in time as to the cause
of the accident,'' said Pan Am spokeswoman Pamela Hanlon in New
York, who confirmed the crash and said that 243 people and 15 crew
members were aboard.
   She said no passenger list was immediately available for the
flight, which originated in Frankfurt, West Germany, and was due to
arrive at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York at 9:19
p.m. EST.
   Another eyewitness, hotelier Graham Byerley, told the BBC:
   ``We initially heard a rumbling over the hotel. We thought the
roof was falling in, and then we heard a tremendous shudder on the
ground as though it were an earthquake, and then we saw sparks and
this enormous flame going 200 or 300 feet into the air. There was
debris flying everywhere.''
   Carnahan said: ``All I could see was flames and fire. I could see
several houses on the skyline whose roofswere totally off, and all
you could see was flaming timbers and what was left of the houses.''
   Cars could be seen burning on the road, and traffic jams quickly
developed, slowing the rush of ambulances and police to the scene.
   Carnahan, who lives two miles south of Lockerbie, said after
getting home: ``I was driving past the filling station when the
plane crashed. There was a terrible explosion ... The crash was very
close to the center of the town, in a residential area.
   He said: ``There was a terrible explosion and the whole sky lit
up and the sky was actually raining fire. It was just like liquid.
We have actually found an aluminum rivet embedded in the metal of my
car.''
   ``There's a lot of rescue services trying to get to the area but
the roads are blocked solid with cars and sightseers going over
toward the scene of the crash,'' he said. Carnahan said he believed
the plane was on fire before it crashed because ``it was trailing
flames when it went over the village.''
   Flight 103 had taken off 25 minutes late, many of its passengers
laden with Christmas gifts, and was at 31,000 feet when contact was
lost, the Heathrow Airport Authority said. The Boeing 747 has 412
passenger seats, meaning that Flight 103 was more than half full.
   Glasgow said the ``sky lit up'' when the jumbo crashed.
   ``The whole road was ablaze. Two houses were blazing. The road
was completely covered with masonry, garden gates and apparently
parts of the plane, but not very big parts,'' he told Independent
Radio News. ``There was a lot of smoking debris on fire. It looked
as if the road as burning.''
   ``We tried to get near the plane but it was completely on fire.
There were no bodies about. I don't think there would be any
chance... It went up in a fireball.'' Glasgow said the aircraft hit
a road, carried on for about 1,500 yards and then exploded.
   The last fatal Boeing 747 accident occurred Nov. 28, 1987, when a
South African 747-Combi _ configured to carry both passengers and
freight on the passenger level _ crashed in the Indian Ocean near
Mauritius, with approximately 160 deaths, according to Boeing.
   On Aug. 12, 1985, a Boeing 747 flown by Japan Air Lines crashed
into a mountain on a domestic flight, killing 520 people.
   The Japan Air Lines crash was the worst single-plane aircraft
accident in history. Boeing later admitted its faulty repairs were
one of the causes of the crash, which was attributed to a crack in
the rear cabin wall that caused a sudden loss of pressure. The force
of the air tore the plane's tail apart.
   The Federal Aviation Administration in 1986 ordered a
modification of all Boeing 747s as a result of that crash.
   David Jimenez of Boeing Commercial Airplanes in Seattle said the
jet was a a 747-100. He said it was the 15th 747 ever built and that
it was delivered to Pan Am in February 1970.
   It had approximately 33,000 cycles, with one cycle representing a
takeoff and landing. Even though the jet was relatively old in terms
of 747s, that is not considered a high number of cycles, he said. A
high number is 50,000-plus.

   The American Red Cross president said Wednesday
that Soviet authorities were unprepared for the devastation caused
by the Armenian earthquake, but are doing their best to properly use
$100 million in foreign aid for the victims.
   ``I'm satisified that every attempt is being made to properly
utilize the assistance, and to provide accountability for it,''
Richard Schubert said in a telephone interview after returning to
Moscow from Armenia.
   The Dec. 7 earthquake leveled cities and up to 100 rural
settlements in northwest Armenia, and official Soviet sources have
put the death toll as high as 55,000.
   The quake prompted an outpouring of government and private aid
from 77 countries that the Soviets say has totaled at least $100
million.
   Schubert, who arrived in the Soviet Union Saturday, said the
American Red Cross contributed $4 million in aid in kind, from
syringes and bags for storing blood to ultrasound and dialysis
machines.
   He said the Soviets abandoned their customary restraint on
foreign entries to let quake aid be flown into Armenia, which may
have contributed to chaos.
   ``The logistics of all this stuff coming in at the same time,
without the right prioritization from the owners, has made it
difficult for them,'' he said.
   The Soviet Red Cross never included planning for domestic
disasters in its program, he said.
   ``One of the problems was that they were totally open to people
coming in and bringing things, and didn't organize it into a proper
pipeline,'' he said.
   He said such an earthquake would have posed a challenge even in
the United States, where there have long been contingency plans for
disasters.
   ``Here, neither the government nor private organizations had
experience in dealing with the logistics of anything like this,'' he
said.
   Schubert said the Soviets ``are committed to tracking down every
piece of equipment that's been donated. If it's not needed because
they already have it, they'll offer to return it.''
   He said his organization had also received at least $1 million in
cash donations for victims, and that he and Soviet Red Cross
officials discussed how to spend the money. He said suggestions
include building a plant to make artificial limbs for people who
lost arms or legs; a hospital center for paraplegics, and drawing up
a disaster preparedness plan for Armenia.
   ``We'll take the projects home and discuss them,'' said Schubert,
who plans to return home Thursday.
   On Wednesday night, he visited the Vishnevsky Surgical Institute
in Moscow to meet with badly injured earthquake victims and with
institute director Vladimir Fedorov.

<TEXT>
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz met
Wednesday with ousted Panamanian President Eric Arturo Delvalle as
part of a high-level show of support for a leader whom the United
States continues to regard as Panama's legitimate authority.
   Neither Shultz nor Delvalle spoke after their late afternoon
meeting, but State Department deputy spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley had
reaffirmed earlier that U.S. backing for Delvalle remains unchanged
10 months after his ouster by forces loyal to Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega.
   Mrs. Oakley appeared to rule out U.S. use of force to depose
Noriega, saying that ``Panama's political crisis can be resolved
only by Panamanians.''
   Delvalle will meet Thursday with President Reagan, who said
Wednesday that ``it would be nice'' if there were a change in
government in Panama before he leaves office next month but doesn't
know if there will be one.
   Panama's Ambassador Juan B. Sosa, a Delvalle loyalist, said the
deposed president is here to discuss several options with
administration officials and his supporters here.
   Sosa said the Panamanian opposition must decide whether to
contest presidential elections set for May.
   He said one option is to boycott the election on grounds that
Noriega is likely to rig the outcome. Alternatively, he said, the
anti-Noriega forces could field a candidate whose entry into the
race would demonstrate beyond doubt the breadth of the opposition to
the military leader.
   Delvalle has been living in hiding in Panama since he was deposed
and was flown to the United States aboard a U.S. military aircraft.
   Deputy White House Press Secretary Roman Popadiuk said the
Thursday meeting at the White House was designed ``to show visibly
the U.S. support for the Delvalle government and for the people of
Panama.''
   The spokesman was asked about reports that Panamanians working
for United States companies in Panama were disgruntled over U.S.
economic sanctions designed to end the Noriega regime.
   ``We regret any hardship imposed on these long-term loyal
employes,'' he said. ``Noriega's actions demonstrate the great
lengths he is willing to go to find money to shore up his illegal
regime.''
   ``The United States sanctions remain in place,'' Popadiuk said.
``They were undertaken in response to the call by the Delvalle
government for economic pressure against Noriega. The sanctions will
remain in place until the Panamanian people enjoy the full benefits
of democracy. ...
   ``Panama's economic problems preceded the economic sanctions,''
he said. ``The Panamanian economy was already deteriorating due to
the Noriega regime's policies.''

   John Mulroy, 59, director of international
communications for The Associated Press, was aboard the New
York-bound Pan Am jetliner that crashed and exploded Wednesday in
Scotland.
   Mulroy's son Sean, 25, and Sean's wife, Ingrid, also were
passengers on Pan Am Flight 103 when it crashed in the village of
Lockerbie in southern Scotland, about an hour after takeoff from
London.
   There was no word that any of the 258 people on board had
survived. ``We have not heard of any survivors off the aircraft,''
said Jeffrey Kriendler, Pan Am vice president for corporate
communications, in New York.
   Mulroy joined the AP four years ago after 25 years with Pan Am,
where he had been director of communications. He was a native of
County Mayo, Ireland, and maintained a second home in the land of
his birth.
   He and his wife, Josephine, of East Northport, on New York's Long
Island, also are the parents of a daughter, Siobhan, 26, and a
second son, Brendan, 23.
   Mulroy joined the AP in August 1984 as staff executive for
international communications. He was named deputy director of
communications in 1986 and director of international communications
in 1988. In that position, he was responsible for all AP technical
operations outside the United States.
   He was born April 1, 1929, and held an associate degree in
electrical engineering from Birmingham University in England.

Wednesday the United States won't give diplomatic recognition to
Angola unless it holds peace talks with rebels fighting to topple
the Marxist government.
   Angola's deputy foreign minister told reporters his country
absolutely refuses to talk with the U.S.- and South African-backed
UNITA rebels, led by Jonas Savimbi.
   ``With or without Savimbi, we will not talk with UNITA,'' said
the Angolan, Venancio de Moura.
   Taken together, the comments indicated no peace is imminent
between Angola and UNITA, despite the conclusion of a peace
settlement for southwest Africa.
   The foreign ministers of Cuba, Angola, and South Africa were
scheduled to sign final documents Thursday for the withdrawal of
50,000 Cuban troops fron Angola, and for Pretoria to begin granting
independence to Namibia, Africa's last colony.
   De Moura said Angolan officials had been told by Chester A.
Crocker, the assistant U.S. secretary of state, that Washington will
drop its opposition to Angola's joining the World Bank and
International Monetary Fund and extend diplomatic recognition once
the accords were signed.
   But Crocker, who mediated the African accords, stressed the
United States will not cease supplying weapons to UNITA.
   ``Our attitude toward UNITA is unchanged,'' Crocker told
reporters. ``We have no intention of disengaging unilaterally from
the Angolan situation at a time when others continue to provide
large amounts of hardware to the other Angolan parties.''
   Crocker was evidently referring to the Soviet Union, the source
of the Angolan government's weapons.
   When asked if diplomatic recognition of Angola will follow
Thursday's signing of the accords, Crocker said: ``I don't have any
prediction to make on that. Clearly the signing is a very important
step.''
   On U.S. opposition to Angola's joining the IMF and World Bank,
Crocker said ``that is primarily between the Angolans and the IMF to
work out the economic terms of such membership. That has not yet
been done, and so that's what constitutes the principle obstacle.''
   Crocker and the Angolan officials, along with Secretary of State
George P. Shultz and the foreign ministers of Cuba and South Africa,
were to attend Thursday's signing at the United Nations of two
accords on southwest Africa.
   One diplomat who had been expected to attend was Bernt Carlsson,
the Swedish U.N. commissioner for Namibia, who was aboard a Pan Am
jumbo jet that crashed in Scotland Wednesday night. Carlsson, 50,
was flying from London to New York when the jet crashed. His absence
would not delay the meeting.
   The foreign ministers of South Africa, Cuba and Angola are
scheduled to sign accords declaring the independence process for
Namibia will begin April 1, after 73 years of South African rule.
   At the same time, Cuba and Angola will sign an agreement with the
United Nations to have 70 U.N. military observers monitor withdrawal
of 50,000 Cuban troops from Angola over a 30-month period, beginning
in January.
   A much larger peacekeeping force is planned for monitoring South
Africa's withdrawal from Namibia, also known as South-West Africa.
   A decade-old Security Council plan for Namibia's independence
calls for about 2,000 civilian administrators and military police to
back about 7,500 U.N. peacekeepers as South African troops withdraw
and a civilian government is organized.
   The Namibian elections are scheduled for Nov. 1.
   Cuban troops went to Angola in 1975 to help the Marxist
government fight invading South African troops and U.S.-backed
rebels of the National Union for the Total Liberation of Angola,
more commonly called UNITA.
   South Africa insisted on the Cuban withdrawal from Angola in
exchange for its cooperation with the Namibia independence plan.
   Pretoria has ruled the mineral-rich territory of Namibia since
capturing it from Germany during World War I. In 1920 the League of
Nations granted South Africa a mandate to administer Namibia; the
United Nations revoked that mandate in 1966.

   Brent Carlsson of Sweden, the U.N.
commissioner for Namibia, was one of the passengers aboard the Pan
Am jetliner that crashed in Scotland on Wednesday, U.N officials
said.
   Carlsson, 50, was to have been a witness Thursday when the accord
is signed that granting the African colony of Namibia its
independence.
   Flight 103 crashed about an hour after Carlsson's assistant,
Malti Ramen, said the commissioner called her to say he was boarding
the plane.
   On Thursday, the foreign ministers of South Africa, Cuba and
Angola are to sign an accord guaranteeing Pretoria will end its
73-year rule over Namibia, and that 50,000 Cuban troops will
withdraw from Angola.
   South African Foreign Minister R.F. Botha told The Associated
Press he arrived in New York on the Pan Am flight just before the
ill-fated Flight 103.
   Botha, contacted at his hotel, said he was saddened to learn of
the crash.
   Carlsson had been commissioner for Namibia since July 1987. The
United Nations in 1966 revoked a League of Nations mandate giving
South Africa the right to govern Namibia, and asserted its own
authority over the territory.
   South Africa, however, defied the U.N. declaration until this
month, when it finally signed a preliminary agreement that linked
its withdrawal from Namibia with the Cuban pullout from Angola.
   The United Nations considered Carlsson the chief official of
Namibia, also known as South-West Africa. Thursday's accord would
have been its first step toward coming under his control during its
transition to an independent government.
   Carlsson was formerly a special emissary for Swedish Prime
Minister Olaf Palme to Middle East and African nations from 1983-85.
From 1976-83, he was general secretary of the Socialist
International.

<HEAD>Winter Storm Belts Utah, California</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A fierce storm heralded the first day of winter Wednesday,
dumping up to 15 inches of snow through the mountains of Utah,
triggering dozens of traffic accidents and bringing strong winds and
high surf to the California coast.
   A low pressure system and a cold front moving across the
Intermountain region spawned snow throughout the mountainous areas
of the central and southern Plateau west of the Rockies and to the
central Rockies.
   Winter arrived at 10:28 a.m. EST Wednesday.
   The mountains and ski resorts of Utah reported between 10 and 15
inches of snow, with heavy snow continuing to fall through the
areas. Total snow accumulation in valley areas of Utah was expected
to be 3 to 5 inches.
   The fast-moving storm snarled traffic for northern Utah
motorists. The Utah Highway Patrol reported more than 40 accidents
in the Salt Lake Valley by mid-afternoon. No major injuries were
reported.
   Light snow also fell over western Wyoming with the heaviest
accumulations occurring in the mountains. Between 4 and 8 inches of
snow was received in Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Park.
Grant Village in Yellowstone National Park and the ski area near
Teton Village, Wyo., had almost a foot of new snow.
   High wind watches were posted Wednesday night for southeast
Wyoming, as well as for the Colorado eastern foothills, where winds
were expected to gust as high as 60 mph.
   High winds also buffeted the California coast and dangerously
high surf was reported, with wave heights expected to reach 15 to 20
feet.
   Elsewhere, rain was scattered along a cold front that stretched
from southern New England to southeast Texas.
   The Atlantic Coast states enjoyed mild weather on Wednesday, with
record high temperatures set in Binghamton, N.Y., with 52 degrees,
and Syracuse, with 58.
   Temperatures early Wednesday afternoon were in the teens and 20s
over parts of the northern and central Rockies, eastern parts of the
Great Basin, North Dakota, northern Minnesota and the northern half
of the upper Great Lakes; in the 30s and 40s extended through the
Pacific Coast across the central Intermountain region, the southern
Rockies, South Dakota and the central Plains, the middle Mississippi
Valley, the remainder of the Great Lakes and the Ohio Valley to the
central and northern Appalachians; in the 70s and 80s were over
south, central and southeast Texas, along the Gulf Coast, Florida
and along the southern Atlantic Coast; in the 50s and 60s throughout
the rest of the nation.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 15
degrees at Havre, Mont., to 82 degrees at McAllen and Harlingen
Texas and Fort Myers, Fla.
   The forecast for Thursday called for showers and thunderstorms
from eastern Texas across the lower Mississippi Valley, eastern
parts of Kansas and Oklahoma, much of the middle Mississippi Valley
and lower Ohio Valley to southern parts of the upper Great Lakes;
snow through much of the northern Plains, the upper Mississippi
Valley and the rest of the upper Great Lakes; and rain through the
Pacific Coast area and snow through the northern Intermountain
region, the Sierra Nevadas of California and northern Nevada.
   High temperatures in the teens and 20s were forecast over the
northern Rockies, North Dakota, northern Minnesota, upper Michigan,
northeast New York and northern New England; in the 30s and 40s from
the northern Pacific Coast across much of the central and southern
Plateau region, the central Rockies, the central Plains and South
Dakota, Iowa and Minnesota, the southern half of the upper Great
Lakes, the lower Great Lakes and the upper Ohio Valley to southern
New England and the middle Atlantic Coast; the 70s through most of
Texas, the Gulf Coast region, southern Georgia and most of Florida;
in the 80s over the southern tip of the Florida Peninsula; and in
the 50s and 60s throughout the rest of the nation.

   Scottish reporter Bert Houston was one of the
first journalists to get into Lockerbie after the village was hit by
a crashing Pan Am jumbo jet Wednesday night. He wrote this report
for The Associated Press.

<DATELINE>LOCKERBIE, Scotland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soon after the Pan Am Boeing 747
plowed into Lockerbie on Wednesday evening, its council hall became
a makeshift clinic. Within hours, it was a morgue.
   Nobody knows how many of the 2,500 villagers have lost their
lives, but up to half a dozen houses were flattened, and others
caught fire and were gutted.
   Mayor Frank Park stood in the street, dazed and in tears, too
distraught to talk. Pleasant village lanes were littered with
debris, masonry, ripped up fences and shrubbery.
   Royal Air Force rescue authorities say two rows of houses were
demolished and no survivors have been found in the wreckage.
   Sherwood Crescent, the village center that bore the brunt of the
crash, was sealed off, and accumulated traffic blocked the accesses
to Lockerbie, so that rescuers had to fly in and out by helicopter.
There were fears that a gas station hit by the wreckage might blow
up.
   According to initial accounts from authorities, the aircraft
apparently hit a hillside near the tiny hamlet of Corrie, about six
miles from Lockerbie, and left a trail of debris and bodies across
the countryside.
   Along a country road leading to Lockerbie, rescue parties could
be seen examining pieces of smoking wreckage, and there were what
looked like blanket-covered bodies.
   Some of the wreckage also landed on cars on the four-lane bypass
around Lockerbie and they went up in flames.
   A former police inspector, Archie Smith, ran out of his house
with his son when he heard the crash.
   ``I didn't know what it was at first. It was just a mighty bang.
Where the houses were seems to be just a black hole. The fire spread
quickly and my home soon caught alight and it is now destroyed as
well.''
   Smith, who was a policeman for 30 years, said: ``Never, ever have
I seen anything so appalling, so horrific as this.''
   The flames sent up a pall of thick, choking smoke and the streets
were littered with rocks and twisted pieces of metal.
   Sheila McDonald was delivering Christmas presents to a friend's
home on a hillside overlooking the town when she heard ``a horrible
droniong sound.''
   She said: ``This V-shaped object just seemed to come flying
through the air ... it was the wings and front section of an
aircraft ... another part came just behind and all around seemed to
be red dots like sparks.
   ``It hit some houses in the town and there was a mass of flame
and everything just started to shake.''

   Everard Whitehouse joined a small group of shaken
relatives of passengers who boarded Pan Am Flight 103 at Heathrow
Airport Wednesday night and voiced the frail hope his young cousin
had missed the plane.
   ``People change their minds,'' he said.
   Whitehouse had taken Julian Bennello, 25, of Boston, to the
airport in the afternoon to catch the flight. He returned to the
airport after hearing the news that it crashed in the village of
Lockerbie in southern Scotland.
   ``He's a post-graduate at Cambridge University and is quite
brilliant,'' said Whitehouse. ``He delayed his flight by one day
because he wanted to see a friend of his who was ill in Cambridge.
   ``I've come here because I couldn't get through on the phones.
... His brother rang me from the States and I told him I was going
to the airport. I wanted to make sure he was on the plane as things
changed at the last moment _ people change their minds.''
   Police officers escorted one elderly couple who walked down the
airport's corridor holding hands, tears in their eyes.
   Two tearful women who would not reveal their names said, ``We've
been ringing all the time. We've been trying to phone New York and
the London numbers and they are just engaged. We've come here
because we think a friend of ours is on the plane.''
   Heathrow staff members appeared pale and stunned by the news
about the flight, which had left Terminal Three.
   ``They were the usual mix of holidaymakers and businessmen,'' an
airport security man said. ``Many of them going back home for the
holidays.
   ``They seemed in a pre-Christmas spirit, carrying presents among
their luggage. There appeared to be a lot of women and children
among the passengers,'' he said.

<HEAD>Woman Convicted In Latest Phone Harassment Dispute</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROCKVILLE, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Maryland woman faces up to three years in
prison on her conviction for making repeated telephone calls to
harass another woman while both were dating the same man.
   Carolyn Foote, 28, of Germantown, also faces a possible $500
fine, according to her attorney, John P. Kudel. She was convicted of
telephone harassment by Montgomery County District Court Judge Paul
McGuckian after a three-hour trial Tuesday. No sentencing date was
set.
   The two-year dispute was the subject of an ``Oprah Winfrey Show''
broadcast in September.
   The victim, Lorraine Goldstein, of Gaithersburg, burst into tears
when McGuckian announced his verdict. Ms. Goldstein, who has changed
her surname to avoid further harassment, said she changed her
unlisted telephone number seven times to escape Ms. Foote's threats.
She asked that her new surname not be disclosed.
   ``This is obviously a tragic and unfortunate case,'' said
McGuckian, who noted Ms. Foote's ``obsessive behavior'' before
reading the verdict. ``Why it's gone on this long, I'll never
understand.''
   Kudel described Ms. Goldstein as ``an insecure person'' with a
``desire to be recognized'' and suggested she fabricated her story
and pressed charges against Ms. Foote because she enjoyed the
publicity her case had received.
   Ms. Goldstein said she dated Jeffrey Dorsey casually for abou two
years when she received the first threatening call in December 1986
from a woman who told her to leave him alone ``or I will kill you.''
   The calls reached a peak of 60 per hour, she said.
   Chesapeake and Potomac Telephone Co. traced numerous calls to
Foote's home and to the Rockville law firm where she worked, Ms.
Goldstein said.
   Ms. Goldstein, who told police she was 45 in September, said she
discontinued her relationship with Dorsey in April 1988. The
harassment eased this year, but the calls resumed in early
September, shortly after her unlisted number was printed in an
advertisement for a roommate in a local newspaper, she said.
   Ms. Foote denied harassing Ms. Goldstein and said the
Gaithersburg woman threatened her on several occasions.
   Dorsey testified on Ms. Foote's behalf. He also said he had filed
trespassing and other charges against both women because of disputes
he had with them.
   Ms. Foote was given probation before judgment in 1987 on an
earlier harassment conviction.

   Leftist rebels clad as
soldiers briefly occupied a town near the capital, where they killed
a soldier and destroyed a telecommunications office, witnesses said
Wednesday.
   Elsewhere guerrillas blew up a military truck, killing two police
officers and wounding 12, and they killed two guardsmen when they
seized a National Guard post, the military reported.
   A soldier, Jose Alfredo Sanchez, told The Associated Press about
30 members of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front took
over San Jose Villanueva for about three hours Tuesday night.
   The town of 4,000 inhabitants is 15 miles southeast of San
Salvador, in La Libertad province.
   Sanchez said the rebels, led by a man in a lieutenant's uniform,
tried to pass themselves off as soldiers of the Atlacatl Battalion,
a unit specializing in anti-guerrilla operations.
   He said the rebels killed Sgt. Jose Donis Rivera, the local civil
defense chief, when he refused to let them enter the command station
with their weapons. They then blew up a telecommunications office.
   Sanchez said he escaped when the rebels were burning military
documents.
   Townspeople told the AP the guerrillas ran through the town
shouting revolutionary slogans and inviting inhabitants to join
their fight.
   The Liberation Front is an umbrella organization of five
guerrilla groups, all committed to overthrowing the U.S.-supported
government.
   Army officials found a military truck that rebels destroyed early
Wednesday.
   A soldier guarding the wrecked truck said rebels blew it up with
a mine as it patrolled the highway between San Salvador and El
Puerto de La Libertad, about eight miles to the southeast. The
soldier spoke on condition of anonymity. Two national police were
killed and 12 injured.
   An army search for the attackers proved unavailing.
   Armed Forces spokesmen said rebels occupied the National Guard
post in Mercedes Umana on Tuesday night and killed two guardsman.
Merces Umana is in Usulutan province, 77 miles east of the capital.

   Boeing's 747 jumbo jetliner has an average
safety record, but it's been involved in several of the world's
worst aviation disasters over the course of its nearly 20-year
history because of its large capacity.
   The worst single-plane aircraft accident in history involved a
Japan Air Lines 747 that smashed into a mountain northwest of Tokyo
on Aug. 12, 1985, killing 520 of 524 people aboard.
   In March 1977, two 747s _ one a Pan Am jet, the other a KLM _
collided on a fog-shrouded runway in the Canary Islands, killing
more than 582 people. The blame was put on a mis-communication that
resulted in one pilot taking off when another was on the runway.
   Aviation expert John Galipault of the Aviation Safety Institute
in Ohio said the 747 aircraft has a safety record about average for
the early wide-body jetliners, according to statistical summaries of
jet aircraft accidents.
   The Pan Am 747 that crashed in Scotland on Wednesday was the 15th
747 ever built and it was delivered to Pan Am in February 1970.
   The aviation industry recently has focused on aging aircraft, due
in part to the in-flight damage sustained by an Aloha Airline Boeing
737 airplane in Hawaii this year. Boeing has undertaking a series of
studies of its older airplanes to determine what effect age and use
have on airworthiness.
   A Boeing 747 military version is being outfitted to become the
new Air Force One presidential aircraft.
   David Jimenez, of Boeing Commercial Airplanes division in
Seattle, Wash., said the plane that crashed was a 747-100 model with
approximately 16,500 takeoff and landings.
   The 747-100 was the initial model of the aircraft and is no
longer manufactured. It was capable of seating up to 385 passengers.
   The plane also was produced in other models and configurations,
including the high capacity type involved in the Japan crash that
could carry 550 passengers for short range flights.
   The 1985 Japan Air Lines crash was attributed to a crack in the
rear cabin wall opened, sending a rush of pressurized air into the
tail section, blowing the tail apart and severing hydraulic lines
used to control the aircraft.
   After that crash, the Federal Aviation Administration ordered
modification of all 747s aimed at preventing such a rush of
pressurized air if the rear cabin wall fails.
   The Boeing Co. admitted that its faulty repairs were one of the
causes.
   According to Boeing, 18 of the 883 747s produced have crashed or
been otherwise destroyed.
   Among them was the Korean Air Lines 747 that was shot down by a
Soviet jet fighter Sept. 1, 1983, after flying through Soviet
airspace near Sakhalin Island.
   Others included an Air India 747 that crashed June 23, 1985 off
the coast of Ireland, killing 329 people.

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lebanon bade a bitter goodbye Wednesday to
the Red Cross, one of the few sources of care and comfort in this
violence-scarred country.
   The agency's pullout, prompted by terrorist death threats, means
an end to what often has been the only humanitarian aid for
thousands of people during 13 years of civil war and factional
violence.
   ``Lebanon is the only loser,'' Beirut's leftist As-Safir daily
lamented Wednesday as the International Committee of the Red Cross
evacuated its Swiss workers.
   The last ferry headed for Larnaca, Cyprus included Michael
Dufour, the chief Red Cross delegate, Swiss Ambassador Dino Sciolli
and 12 other Swiss nationals, boarded the boat, police said.
   Sciolli, based in the Cypriot capital Nicosia, told an official
of the Lebanese Foreign Ministry that his government was recalling
him to Switzerland to discuss the Red Cross' pullout.
   Eleven Red Cross workers who left Tuesday completed the same
route and arrived in Switzerland on Wednesday. On Tuesday, Red Cross
officials in Geneva had said all had left.
   With the collapse of government authority over the years, U.N.
organizations and humanitarian groups have been the saviors of
countless victims of the bloodletting.
   The Red Cross worked closely with the Lebanese Red Cross, whose
rescue crews have braved bombs and bullets to carry out their
mission in Christian and Moslem areas.
   The departure left hundreds of Lebanese and Palestinian prisoners
in Israel and the Khiam detention camp run by the Israeli-backed
South Lebanon Army with no way to correspond with their families.
   Red Cross officials visited the detainees regularly to deliver
messages and to try to improve living conditions.
   The agency also had been instrumental in arranging prisoner
exchanges between Palestinian guerrillas and Israel.
   Another casualty of the departure is an orthopedic center in
south Lebanon's provincial capital of Sidon. For five years it has
cared for disabled victims of Lebanon's violence and provided them
with artifical limbs.
   The Red Cross' 150 Lebanese employees face losing their jobs if
the withdrawal becomes permanent.
   ``One minute we were happily going about our work. The next I was
told to go home for a week, pending the (Red Cross') final decision
on whether to shut down its operations in Lebanon or not,'' one
Lebanese worker said.
   In Geneva, Andre Pasquier, the Red Cross chief of operations,
said all the delegates were ready to go back to Lebanon as soon as
conditions would permit, ``even tomorrow.'' He said the fact that
they stayed on their posts after one of them, Peter Winkler, was
kidnapped last month, ``demonstrated their determination to
continue.''
   Until the last year, humanitarian workers were generally
considered immune from kidnappings and death threats by Lebanon's
extremists because they gave help regardless of political or
religious affiliations.
   They remained when thousands of other foreigners fled
kidnap-plagued Moslem areas in recent years. They treated the sick
and wounded, provided relief aid and even food, often in highly
dangerous conditions.
   The evacuation was ordered Tuesday by international Red Cross
headquarters in Geneva following the release Friday of Winkler, 32,
a Swiss national.
   He was abducted Nov. 17 in south Lebanon by unidentified gunmen.
They were believed linked to pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem extremists
apparently seeking to trade Winkler for alleged Shiite hijacker
Hussein Hariri, who goes on trial in Switzerland in February.
   It was not clear why the kidnappers released Winkler, or whether
the subsequent death threats made against the all-Swiss Red Cross
officials came from the same group.
   The two largest Moslem militias in south Lebanon on Wednesday
urged the Red Cross to return.
   The appeals came in separate statements by the Sunni Moslem
Nasserite leftist militia that governs Sidon and the Shiite Moslem
mainstream Amal militia in Tyre.
   ``The kidnapping of humanitarian activists has tarnished our
national image,'' said the Nasserite statement issued by the group's
chief of staff, Usama Saad.
   He said the pullout was ``strange, especially after the intense
national efforts that were exerted to gain the release of Peter
Winkler.''
   Amal's statement in Tyre said ``criminal gangs here and there''
were behind the terrorist attacks aimed at ``emptying Lebanon of all
humanitarian organizations.
   Five other humanitarian activists have been kidnapped in south
Lebanon this year. Four _ a Briton, a Swede, a Norwegian and a
Syrian _ were freed.
   But Belgian physician Jan Cools, who disappeared May 21, remains
missing. A previously unknown group calling itself ``the Soldiers of
Justice,'' said Sunday it was holding Cools and accused him of
spying for Israel.
   Cools, 32, had worked for the Norwegian humanitarian organization
Norwac near Tyre for three months before he disappeared.
   There was no word whether Norwac and other humanitarian groups,
such as the French-based Medecin Sans Frontiers and Britain's Oxfam
charity, will follow the Red Cross' example.

   John Mulroy, 59, director of international
communications for The Associated Press, was killed Wednesday in the
crash of a New York-bound Pan Am jetliner.
   Mulroy's son Sean, 25, and Sean's wife, Ingrid, also were aboard
Pan Am Flight 103 when it crashed in the village of Lockerbie in
southern Scotland, about an hour after takeoff from London.
   Local authorities said no survivors were found from among the 258
people aboard.
   Mulroy joined the AP four years ago after 25 years with Pan Am,
where he had been director of communications. He was a native of
County Mayo, Ireland, and maintained a second home in the land of
his birth.
   He is survived by his wife, Josephine, of East Northport, on New
York's Long Island, a daughter, Siobhan, 26, and a son, Brendan, 23.
   Mulroy joined the AP in August 1984 as staff executive for
international communications. He was named deputy director of
communications in 1986 and director of international communications
in 1988. In that position, he was responsible for all AP technical
operations outside the United States.
   He was born April 1, 1929, and held an associate degree in
electrical engineering from Birmingham University in England.
   Louis D. Boccardi, AP president and general manager, said, ``John
Mulroy had been with us only four years but his contributions were
immense.
   ``He guided the streamlining of our international news and
picture communications systems during a time of accelerated
modernization. He did that with a wit and warmth that made him a
treasured member of our team.
   ``To say that we will miss him does not begin to describe our
sense of loss.''

   A federal jury on Wednesday worked its way
through a third day of deliberations at the divorce-fixing
conspiracy trial of former Miss America Bess Myerson without
reaching a verdict.
   The panel already had deliberated 15 hours over two days when it
resumed work Wednesday morning in the case against Miss Myerson; her
lover, Carl ``Andy'' Capasso and the judge who made interim
decisions in Capasso's divorce. The jury broke for the night shortly
before 7 p.m.
   More testimony was read back to the jury, which also requested
and received several exhibits relating to the Capasso divorce action.
   Miss Myerson, who was Miss America in 1945; Capasso, 43, a
one-time city contractor; and former state Supreme Court Justice
Hortense Gabel, 76, are charged with plotting to cut Capasso's
temporary support payments to his estranged wife.
   All three are charged with conspiracy, mail fraud and promoting
bribery. Miss Myerson also is charged with obstruction of justice
for allegedly trying to influence the grand jury testimony of the
prosecution's star witness.
   Miss Myerson, 64, faces a maximum of 30 years in prison and
$513,000 in fines if convicted on all counts. Her two co-defendants
face up to 25 years and $263,000 in fines if convicted.
   Once the city's cultural affairs commissioner, Miss Myerson is
accused of giving a $19,000-a-year city job to Mrs. Gabel's
daughter, Sukhreet Gabel, to influence her mother, who was making
interim rulings in Capasso's bitter divorce from his wife, Nancy.
   Miss Myerson also is accused of trying to influence Ms. Gabel's
grand jury testimony.
   The prosecution's case consisted of mainly circumstantial
evidence because there were no witnesses to the alleged bribe scheme.

<TEXT>
   Two bald eagles are nesting in a well-trodden city
park overlooking Puget Sound despite the birds' usual intolerance
for human activity, and the prospects of their raising a brood are
considered good.
   Their 7-foot wingspans casting immense shadows as they play in
the thermal currents above the bluffs and feed in the sound, the
eagles arrived at wild Discovery Park early this year and began
building a nest near the top of an 80-foot fir.
   Jim Watson, state Department of Wildlife biologist, on Tuesday
said the birds _ the first known eagle pair to settle in the
710-acre park _ are adding to the nest as the January mating season
approaches.
   The eagles could be from a generation that grew up near human
activity and thus has a higher tolerance for it, Watson said.
   The park is in a residential neighborhood on the city's western
edge. The nesting tree is 500 feet from a maintenance building used
by dozens of people and 15 trucks, said Allissa Beebe, recreation
attendant.
   ``They don't seem to be bothered at all,'' she said. ``Once we
had five hang gliders out and tons of people in the park, and they
were out sailing around. It was really neat.''
   The park, which averages 1,000 visitors a week and has dirt
hiking and running trails, also contains dozens of Army and Navy
residences and Army Reserve barracks, said Les McMillan, park ranger.
   Watson said the birds' prospects of raising a brood are good.
   He said there are fewer than 10 year-round eagle pairs in King
and Pierce counties, the state's most populous, in parks that, like
Discovery Park, are relatively protected and border on Puget Sound
or major lakes.
   Eagles are listed as threatened in the region and are protected
by state and federal law.
   The newcomers don't necessarily indicate a trend toward more
urban eagles, said Watson. Pairs need very tall old-growth or
second-growth trees for a nest, an isolated territory of four square
miles and water containing a generous food supply.
   Populated areas around Puget Sound and lakes in northwest
Washington rarely have that combination, Watson said.
   Statewide, there are 302 nesting pairs that produced 285 young
this year, In 1975, 113 nesting pairs were counted, but part of the
increase is attributed to better surveying, said Jim Michaels, a
U.S. Fish and Wildlife biologist.
   Bald eagle population numbers are up across the country, chiefly
because the pesticide DDT has banned since 1972, officials siad. DDT
weakened egg shells, reducing the survival rate.
   The bald eagle will remain listed as threatened in the region
that encompasses Washington, Oregon, California, Nevada, Idaho,
Montana and Wyoming until 800 nesting pairs are counted. The count
last year was 627, said Kelly McAllister, researcher for the state
Department of Wildlife.
   During 1988 in the Chespeake Bay region, which consists of
Virginia, Maryland, Delaware, West Virginia and eastern
Pennsylvania, 186 nesting pairs produced 258 chicks that left the
nest, said Glenn Therres, head of Maryland's bald eagle project.
   In 1986, 138 nesting pairs were counted and 192 chicks survived
to fly, he said.
   The rapid recovery may mean the bald eagle will be downgraded
from an endangered to a threatened species regionally within five
years, he said. The eagle is listed as an endangered species in 43
states, Therres said.

   Security men foiled an attempt to topple
the fragile coalition government of Prime Minister Sadek Mahdi and
arrested more than two dozen members of a previous administration,
officials said.
   Defense Minister Abdul-Maguid Khalil said the coup was attempted
on Saturday against the Moslem government, whose factions are
quarreling over a proposed peace agreement with Christian and
animist rebels.
   He confirmed a report in the newspaper Al-Siyassa, which said
security personnel arrested 25 retired military officers and former
civilian officials from the former government of President Gaafar
Nimeiri.
   Nimeiri was ousted in a coup April 6, 1985.
   The Al-Siyassa report was the third newspaper report of an
attempted coup in Sudan in the past two weeks.
   After the report appeared, about 300 demonstrators ignored an
emergency government order, gathering in Khartoum's Liberty Square
to demand government approval of a tentative agreement to stop
Sudan's civil war.
   Relief officials estimate at least 500,000 people died this year
from famine due to drought and civil war.
   Riot police and plainclothes security men ringed the square as
protestors chanted ``No, no to war'' and ``Yes, yes to peace.''
   The Democratic Union Party, the second-largest member of the
government coalition led by Mahdi's Umma Party, signed the peace
agreement with the Sudan People's Liberation Army on Nov. 16.
   The tentative pact calls for a cease-fire, a conference to
negotiate a permanent peace, a new constitution and a freeze on
implementing Sudan's Islam-based legal code.
   Rebel leader John Garang began his civil rebellion in early 1983
to press demands for what he considers fairer economic, political
and administrative treatment for southern Sudan.
   The crowd broke up only after they were asked to leave by Abbas
Awad, a member of the organizing committee representing 54 political
parties and labor groups supporting the peace agreement.
   ``We have specific information about plots aimed at jeopardizing
democracy in the country and that the demonstration of today would
have been used as a springboard for this purpose,'' Abbas told the
crowd.
   Interviewed later, he said the Democratic Union Party canceled
the demonstration because a ``group was planning to counter (it) .
.. to spread chaos so that the army would intervene.''
   Parliament voted 136-78 Wednesday to authorize Mahdi to convene a
constitutional peace conference Dec. 31 and invite the rebels to
attend, according to the Egyptian state-run Middle East News Agency.
   The conference is a key clause of the peace agreement, but the
Democratic Unionist Party and Garang have been insisting that the
entire accord be approved before convening the conference.
   The vote in effect overruled the Democratic Unionist Party
demand, prompting some of its members to threaten to withdraw from
the coalition that also includes the Moslem Fundamentalist National
Islamic Front.
   The front oppposes the peace plan because it calls for freezing
Sudan's Islamic legal code until an alternative was reached.

   President Hafez Assad opened the door
Wednesday to re-establishing ties with two of Syria's bitter foes,
Egypt and Iraq, a presidential spokesman said.
   Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak was quoted Wednesday as saying
he invited Assad to visit Egypt in an attempt to improve relations.
   Assad, during a meeting with a delegation from the Federation of
Arab Lawyers, said ``cooperation between Syria and Egypt on a
national basis has always been favored by both countries and would
benefit the Arab nation,'' presidential spokesman Jibran Kourieh
said.
   The president also told the lawyers, including the chairman of
the Egyptian bar association, that although past attempts at
Syrian-Iraqi reconciliation did not work, ``Syria supports any Arab
solidarity action,'' said Kourieh.
   Mubarak made the invitation to Assad in an interview with the
Saudi newspaper Al-Shark al-Awsat, which was published in Cairo
Wednesday by the state-run Middle East News Agency. Mubarak also
said he earlier offered to go to Syria, but Assad snubbed the idea.
   Political observers, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
statements by Assad were a new overture to two of its longstanding
foes.
   Egypt and Syria have been at odds since the late Egyptian
President Anwar Sadat flew to Jerusalem in 1977, an event that
culminated with Egypt's peace treaty with Israel in 1979.
   Syria led the drive to expel Egypt from the Arab League as well
as other regional and Islamic organizations.
   Arab leaders have been trying to organize a summit of the
22-member Arab League, which has not met in regular session since
1982 because of rifts between member governments. Saudi Arabia, the
scheduled venue for the summit, has indicated it wants Egypt to
attend.
   The feud between Syria and Iraq, one of the most bitter
inter-Arab vendettas, was rekindled following the Aug. 20 cease-fire
in the Iran-Iraq war. Assad allied himself with Persian Iran against
Arab Iraq. Syria and Iraq are ruled by rival wings of the Baath Arab
Socialist Party.
   Syria has faced growing political isolation in the region. Arab
states condemned it for its alliance with Iran. Presidential
elections in Lebanon in August and September collapsed after
Christian deputies refused to attend the parliamentary sessions
where Syrian-supported candidates were expected to win. Syria keeps
40,000 troops in Lebanon, which it considers under its sphere of
influence.
   Assad has also waged a campaign since 1983 to depose Yasser
Arafat as chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization. Arafat
has gained unprecedented recognition in the past month for leading
the PLO through the declaration of a Palestinian state and talks
with the United States for the first time in 13 years.

   An English teacher from the United
States has been found slain in her apartment, her throat slashed,
and police said they were questioning people Thursday.
   The police officials, who declined to be identified in keeping
with Korean practice, said a motive had not been established for the
killing of Carolyn J. Abel of Lafayette, Ind.
   The body was found Tuesday by friends who went to her 15th floor
apartment after Ms. Abel, 26, failed to appear at work at English
Language Services in southern Seoul.
   Ms. Abel, one of about 25 English-language instructors at the
private school, came to Korea in October after working as an English
teacher in Japan.
   Police said it appeared she was killed shortly after midnight
Tuesday, because a resident in the apartment building reported
hearing several loud screams.
   The officials also said earlier reports that there were no signs
of a struggle were not correct. They said it looked like Ms. Abel
resisted the attacker and there were 10 cuts on her body, including
wounds on her face and arms. She had a 9-inch cut across her throat.
   Police, reversing earlier statements, said it now appeared a
number of items, including a camera and a tape recorder, had been
removed from Ms. Abel's apartment and there were signs of ransacking.
   On Wednesday police had said there were no signs of a robbery.
However on Thursday they said they were still not convinced that
robbery was a motive because some jewelry was left behind.
   Police quoted friends from the language institute as saying Ms.
Abel was last seen Monday night at a subway station with six other
teachers. Police quoted friends as saying her apartment was
frequented by students and she shared her home with a roommate who
was on vacation in the United States.
   Several Korean students of the slain teacher were being
questioned because the students visited Ms. Abel late at night.
Several sets of fingerprints taken from the apartment were being
checked, officials said.
   Ms. Abel and two other American teachers reportedly went on a
trip to the east coast tourist area of Mount Sorak last weekend with
three male Korean students who were being questioned, police said.
   The Korea Herald reported in its Thursday editions that police
were also checking on a Japanese man thought to be Ms. Abel's
boyfriend. The paper quoted police as saying the unidentified man
left Seoul before the killing.

   A short circuit in wiring under a
bathtub sparked a fire that killed a woman and her four children in
their home early Wednesday, authorities said.
   Authorities at first believed a newly installed furnace might
have caused the blaze after neighbors reported hearing an explosion,
but later in the day State Fire Marshal Larry Bosell eliminated the
furnace as a possible cause.
   ``The cause is electrical,'' Bosell said. ``It appears the wiring
was underneath the floor. It shorted out underneath the bathtub.''
   In Fort Pierce, Fla., another early-morning fire engulfed a
downstairs apartment in a two-story building, killing three young
children while a passerby rescued a fourth child from the house,
investigators said.
   The mother of the four children, Dany Matheu, told police she was
home when the fire started, but witnesses said she was not. The fire
and the causes of the deaths of Janet Matheu, 8; Loune Bieneme, 4;
and their brother Louisena Bieneme, 3, were under investigation.
   In New Palestine, the dead were identified as Julia M. Kennedy
Westcott, a 34-year-old anti-abortion activist; her daughters from
another marriage, Brandi Kay Neal, 16, Holli Ann Neal, 14; and the
Westcotts' children, Veronica Marie ``Vonni'' Westcott, 6; and
Joshua Andrew Westcott, 4.
   Karen Ford, who lives next door, said she and her husband heard
an explosion and called the fire department. They went outside and
found Mrs. Westcott's husband, Roy Andrew Westcott, in the yard in
his bathrobe.
   ``He was running around the yard trying to get back in,'' Mrs.
Ford said.
   Mrs. Ford said Westcott was screaming for someone to shut off the
natural gas line. Westcott had installed a gas furnace in the home
last weekend, she said.
   Westcott, 34, had leaped through a bedroom window and was
hospitalized in critical condition with third-degree burns,
officials said.
   But authorities said any explosions heard at the fire most likely
came from small propane or acetylene tanks stored in the house. Four
or five of the tanks, which are used to thaw out frozen water pipes,
most likely were on premises, said a spokesman for the Hancock
County Sheriff's Department.
   County Sheriff Nick Gulling said some of the more than 50
firefighters who responded to the alarm were relatives of the
Westcotts and many others were friends.
   A crisis intervention team from Indianapolis was at a nearby
church later in the morning, counseling firefighters and others in
the town of 760 people.
   ``This is the first fire with multiple fatalities in the
township,'' said Jerry Nulliner, Sugar Creek Township fire chief.
``Several firefighters, they're experiencing quite a bit of stress.''
   Westcott, an assistant manager in clinical engineering at the
Indiana University Medical Center in Indianapolis, and his wife were
active in church congregations in Indianapolis. They were youth
leaders at Harvestime Assembly of God Church and also attended the
Calvary Temple.
   Mrs. Westcott operated a pro-life telephone counseling service
from her home.

<TEXT>
   An Army soldier stationed in Europe three
times in the last 11 years was arrested Wednesday on suspicion of
espionage for allegedly passing defense secrets to East German
agents, officials said.
   A civilian, Huseyin Yildirim, who lives in the St. Petersburg,
Fla., area was charged with conspiracy to commit espionage by giving
agents of a foreign government national defense secrets, said FBI
spokesman Ed Dutko.
   Warrant Officer James William Hall III, an analyst in the Army's
G-2 intelligence section, was being held at the Fort Stewart
detention facility but was not formally charged, said Lt. Col. John
Chapla, an Army spokesman in Washington.
   Chapla said he had no information ``on the classification or
nature of the information allegedly provided by Hall, or to whom it
went.''
   But Dutko said Hall, 30, is accused of dealing with the East
Germans in an operation involving ``national defense secrets.''
   Federal affidavits filed with U.S. Magistrate G.R. Smith in
Savannah said Hall met Tuesday night at a hotel with an FBI agent
posing as an officer of the Soviet intelligence service.
   ``Hall boasted of the important signal intelligence information
he had passed and admitted his motivation to be greed,'' the court
documents stated.
   Officials said it was unknown how much money allegedly passed
hands.
   The documents said Hall told the FBI agent he began passing
secrets in 1982 while stationed in Germany and continued until
January 1988 when he was reassigned to the United States.
   An affidavit filed in Savannah by FBI agent Charles B. Youmans
Jr. said Hall told the undercover FBI agent that Yildirim, a
60-year-old Turkish national, ``actively participated with him in
the reproduction and transmittal of classified national defense
documents to the East Germans.''
   Hall's home in Richmond Hill, Ga., and Yildirim's home in Florida
were searched Wednesday by FBI and Army intelligence officers, the
FBI said.
   Hall has spent most of his career working as a signals
intelligence-electronics warfare analyst, responsible for helping to
analyze intercepted enemy radio traffic, telephone conversations and
coded messages.
   Hall had three assignments in Europe, the first in June 1977 with
an Army security agency company in Schneeberg, West Germany, Chapla
said. In January 1981, he went to West Berlin, again working in a
signals intelligence assignment.
   Hall returned to the United States in March 1985 and was assigned
to a Fort Monmouth, N.J., military intelligence group, Chapla said.
He went to Frankfurt, West Germany, in January 1986 with a military
intelligence battalion, Chapla said.
   He was sent back to this country in May 1987 and was assigned to
the 24th Infantry Division at Fort Stewart, west of Savannah, in
July of this year.
   Hall is a native of New York City who joined the Army in
September 1976, Chapla said.
   Army officials said Hall's commanding officer will determine how
his case is handled under the Uniform Code of Military Justice.

   Two 11-year-old boys accused of ordering pit
bulls to attack a schoolyard full of children surrendered to police
Wednesday, while another young man faces assault charges in a second
pit bull attack.
   The Dec. 15 school attack left five children with bites on their
feet and legs, authorities said.
   The boys, who live in the school's north Philadelphia
neighborhood, face aggravated and simple assault charges, said Capt.
Jim Boyle of the Police Department's juvenile division.
   Meanwhile, a 20-year-old southwest Philadelphia man faces assault
charges in a pit bull attack on two teen-age girls. Police said the
man, Dwayne Vinson, ordered his dog to attack the girls after they
refused to talk with him Tuesday afternoon.
   The two pit bulls involved in the Dec. 15 schoolyard attack,
which were among six picked up since Friday by police and officials
of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, have been
identified by neighborhood residents.
   The dogs had been kept in vacant houses not far from St. Edwards
Parochial School, police said.
   In the attack, police said, the two boys walked into the
schoolyard and ordered the dogs to ``sic'' the children, about 100
of whom were on recess.
   The children, ages 10 to 12, began screaming and running. Some
tried to scale a fence, some climbed a wall and others grabbed
sticks to fight off the dogs.
   Five youngsters were bitten on the ankles and feet, including one
who suffered more than 30 cuts.
   School officials did not know what prompted the attack but said
they were thankful it had not occurred minutes earlier, when younger
children _ first-, second- and third-graders _ were in the yard for
their recess.

   Rockwell International, operator of the Rocky Flats
nuclear weapons plant, agreed to pay $47,500 to the Environmental
Protection Agency in an agreement the federal agency said Wednesday
confirmed its jurisdiction over the plant.
   Rockwell officials said the Department of Energy, which operates
the plant about 17 miles northwest of Denver, would foot the bill,
reimbursing the company if necessary. They denied the payment was a
civil penalty.
   Rockwell also said the payment was just a ``monetary payment'' to
avoid litigation costs.
   But the EPA said it was the largest civil penalty the agency ever
has assessed against a contractor at a federal facility, and the
first it has assessed for environmental problems at Rocky Flats.
   The payment stems from two enforcement actions _ one in 1986 and
the other this year _ brought against Rockwell by EPA for alleged
PCB, or polychlorinated biphenyl, contamination at the plant.
   ``By agreeing to the terms of this settlement, Rockwell admits
that the agency had the jurisdiction to bring the enforcement
actions against them,'' said David J. Janik, the EPA attorney on the
case.
   The energy department and Rockwell argued that Rockwell cannot be
fined by the EPA because Rocky Flats is a federal facility and EPA
doesn't fine other federal agencies.
   ``It was Rockwell's position that the case should have been one
between EPA and DOE,'' said company spokesman Pat Etchart, adding
that the agreement ``does not set a precedent because we do reserve
our right to contest any future actions the EPA might take.''
   Janik said Rockwell's argument that the payment wasn't a civil
penalty ``is completely incorrect.''
   At Rockwell's request, Janik said, EPA agreed to leave the word
``penalty'' out of the agreement, ``but they know the only authority
the agency (EPA) has for taking money from anybody is through a
civil penalty.''
   Janik said it was ``beyond (EPA's) powers'' to determine whether
DOE can give Rockwell the money to pay the penalty. ``As a taxpayer,
it doesn't sound very good,'' he said.
   Workers at Rocky Flats use plutonium to make triggers for the
nation's nuclear bombs.
   The main plutonium processing building at Rocky Flats has been
closed since early October following a safety violation in which
three people were exposed to plutonium, but production at the plant
has continued.

   India and China signed a civil aviation agreement
and two other accords Thursday during a summit that Indian Prime
Minister Rajiv Gandhi said marks a new beginning in Chinese-Indian
relations.
   The agreements gave some concrete substance to a trip by the
Indian leader intended mainly as a symbolic restoration of good
relations between two nations representing a third of the world's
population.
   The two sides agreed in principle to establish direct air links
between New Delhi and Beijing. They also signed a three-year
cultural exchange program agreement and a science and technology
accord calling for contacts between the scientific communities of
the two countries.
   After meeting with elder statesman Deng Xiaoping, Gandhi said New
Delhi's troubled relations with Beijing seemed but a memory.
   ``We agreed on almost everything that was spoken of,'' Gandhi
said.
   The comment was a bit surprising from a man who has come to power
under the shadow of bad relations with Beijing. But it made sense in
the light of Gandhi's goals in China.
   Gandhi is the first Indian prime minister to come to China since
his grandfather, Prime Minister Jawaharal Nehru, journeyed here in
1954 to celebrate the two countries' close ties.
   Gandhi's five-day trip, which began Monday, marks the first time
Chinese and Indian leaders have met since 1960 when the late Premier
Chou Enlai went to New Dehli.
   Relations turned sour in the early 1960s because of personal and
political disputes between Nehru and Chinese leader Mao Tse-tung. A
border war broke out in 1962.
   In the past 26 years, relations have improved slightly. Border
negotiations started in 1981 as has a small amount of trade. But
little has really changed and the border today remains tense.
   It was to break this political logjam that Gandhi came to China.
He sought, as he said, to rekindle the spirit of ``peace and
goodwill'' between the two most populous nations of the world.
   His first two days were filled with talks on the border, China's
troubled province of Tibet, which lies just north of India, and
trade. But it was his discussion with Deng that seemingly interested
Gandhi the most.
   The meeting began shortly after 10:30 a.m.
   ``Welcome, my young friend,'' the 84-year-old Chinese leader said
to Gandhi, 44, as he took the prime minister's hand.
   ``Beginning with your visit we can restore our relationship as
friends,'' Deng said. ``The two countries' leaders will become
friends, the countries will become friends, the people will become
friends.''
   And then, as if he was talking to a schoolboy, Deng added: ``You
agree, don't you?''
   ``I agree,'' Gandhi replied.
   Deng told Gandhi that he had met Nehru during his visit to
Beijing in 1954.
   ``In the considerable period of time in between there was
unpleasantness with each other,'' Deng said.
   With a sudden wave of his arm, the Chinese leader commanded,
``But let us forget all that. We should be looking forward.''
   Deng said he had sent messages to Gandhi's mother, Indira Gandhi,
in the 1980s when she was prime minister.
   ``At that time our countries had some contact,'' Deng said. ``But
the genuine start in the improvement of our relations is your visit,
so I wish to thank you.''
   Sitting back in the overstuffed chairs in Fujian Hall in the
cavernous Great Hall of the People, the two embarked upon an
analysis of international political and economic affairs.
   ``The difference between the countries of the North and South are
getting bigger and bigger,`` Deng was quoted as saying by the
nationally televised news. ``True development won't be achieved
until all of mankind has achieved a certain level.''
   Gandhi said Deng impressed him.
   ``I found that almost everything he spoke of was what we have
been working for for these last 40 years,'' Gandhi said later at a
news conference. ``Working for a new political order that doesn't
look to blocs, that doesn't look to confrontation as a solution,
working for a new economic order more equitable and just.''
   For Gandhi, his visit with Deng marked the highlight of his trip
because he was seeking symbols and not substance.
   Indeed, the tangible ``achievements'' _ agreements on civil
aviation, science and technology, and cultural exchanges _ are small.
   But for Gandhi, a friendly meeting with Deng was apparently the
sign he had wanted. The political logjam is broken.
   ``We have agreed that we can and should move ahead,'' the young
leader said at the news conference after meeting Deng. ``We have
laid the foundation for a peaceful, stable and cooperative
relationship between our two countries.''

   After hours of acrimonious debate, the
conservative Likud bloc's governing body today narrowly approved an
agreement that would again wed it with the left-wing Labor party in
a coalition government.
   Labor's central committee was expected to endorse the agreement
later today, and a unity Cabinet could be presented to Parliament on
Thursday.
   Many Likud members had been worried their movement would lose its
ideological stance and a chance to rule Israel according to its own
vision by joining with its rival.
   Party leader and Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, however, stressed
to delegates that the unity government had a common enemy: the
PLO-proclaimed state in the Israeli-occupied territories.

   After nearly four years without a
brand-by-brand analysis, American cigarette devotees are once again
confronted by The List.
   The List _ which itemizes tar, nicotine and carbon monoxide
content in cigarette smoke _ is back, released Tuesday by the
Federal Trade Commission for the first time since January 1985.
   The new compilation, based on tobacco-industry tests of 272
varieties of cigarettes, showed that varieties of Carlton and Now
scored lowest in all three categories, exactly where they ranked in
the 1985 list.
   At the other end of the spectrum, Old Gold Straights produced the
highest amounts of tar and nicotine and varieties of Century 25s,
More 120s and Tall 120s produced the most carbon monoxide in the
tests, the consumer agency said.

   Immigration officials are adopting an
aggressive, new approach in dealing with Nicaraguans and other
Central Americans seeking asylum in the United States, and have
handled more than 200 applications in just three days in south Texas.
   The Central Americans aren't being granted work permits during a
30-day period in which decisions are to be made on whether to
approve or reject their asylum requests, Immigration and
Naturalization Service spokesman Duke Austin said Tuesday.
   Following a directive from then-Attorney General Edwin Meese III
in July 1987, work authorization had been virtually automatic for
Nicaraguans once they presented themselves to immigration officials
saying they feared persecution from their country's leftist
Sandinista government.
   The Meese directive was in line with the Reagan administration's
overall opposition to the Sandinista regime. But INS now is facing a
nearly threefold increase in the number of Central Americans pouring
across the border illegally in south Texas and then seeking asylum.

   U.S. Customs Service agents using blowtorches spent
30 hours ripping apart the belly of a Panamanian freighter before
finding their version of a white Christmas: 4,792 pounds of cocaine
hidden in a secret compartment.
   The shipment, which was destined for holiday consumers, brought a
five-day total of cocaine seized on two arriving freighters to 6,733
pounds, according to authorities, who said the shipments were from
the same organization.
   The amount confiscated made it one of the largest cocaine busts
in U.S. history, said authorities, who estimated the drugs' street

   President-elect Bush has made his appointments
for the final two spots on the National Economic Commission, but
doubts persist over how successful the panel will be in breaking a
seven-year deadlock over the budget deficit.
   The high-level commission was created to help the new president
deal with President Reagan's biggest economic failure, huge budget
deficits that have more than doubled the national debt.
   On Tuesday, Bush announced he was choosing former Sen. Paul
Laxalt, R-Nev., and former Ohio Congressman Thomas ``Lud'' Ashley, a
Democrat and one of Bush's closest friends.
   Under law, Bush was required to pick one Democrat and one
Republican to complete the 14-member commission, which is headed by
Democrat Robert Strauss and Republican Drew Lewis.

<HEAD>Resort Recovers From Hurricane but Parts of Beach Still Missing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRIS ANGELO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CANCUN, Mexico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hotels have repaired hurricane damage,
palms sway and discos throb, but fine stretches of beach were blown
away and the tourists, without whom Cancun has no purpose, are slow
to return.
   ``We have to erase the image that exists abroad about the damage
caused by the hurricane,'' said Carlos Constandse, who owns a hotel
in this resort on Mexico's Caribbean coast.
   Hurricane Gilbert struck Cancun on Sept. 14 with 160 mph winds
that snapped power poles like toothpicks, uprooted trees and rammed
a 240-ton fishing boat into one of the hotels.
   Gilbert tore at the hotels first from one side, then the other.
It left them a shambles of shattered glass, soaked furniture and
sand-filled rooms, but caused little structural damage.
   The storm killed more than 300 people on its destructive tour of
the Caribbean, but only 14 of them in this state, Quintana Roo. It
caused $61 million in damage to the Cancun airport, telephones and
other services and $90 million to hotels, the government tourism
agency said.
   When Gilbert was gone, the resort began a feverish repair program
to get ready for the winter season, which means healthy profits for
hotel and shop owners and millions of dollars in foreign exchange
for Mexico's struggling economy.
   ``I'm amazed at how well they got it back together already,''
said George Weist of Lancaster, Pa., who also visited Cancun a year
ago. ``The only thing we wanted to do that we couldn't do was walk
the beach.''
   Fine white Caribbean sand has been shoveled out of hotel lobbies
and rooms, bars and kitchens, but still isn't all back where it came
from.
   The Cancun hotel strip runs for 15 miles, in the shape of a 7,
along a ribbon of sand that sits off the Yucatan Peninsula like a
bracket.
   Beaches are the same as ever along the top of the 7, perhaps even
broader, but not along the vertical stretch, where 100 feet of sand
used to slope gently toward the turquoise surf.
   Some hotels on the northern third lost their beaches entirely and
others have them only at low tide. The beach remains farther south,
but is much narrower than before.
   Residents say the beach changes with the seasons under normal
conditions, shrinking with the north winds of winter and growing
when they shift to the southeast.
   Sand is returning naturally, according to hotel managers and
scientists, and the beach already has widened, but no one knows how
long full recovery will take.
   Because of high repair costs and low income, most hotel
managements will wait until after the four-month peak season to
decide whether to speed up the beach recovery, probably with suction
dredging.
   Several major hotels will not be ready until January or later but
others have reopened in stages, renting some rooms while repairs
continue on others. New discos are opening, but a few old ones
remain closed.
   ``A lot of people aren't here,'' said Craig Debano of Anaheim,
Calif. ``It takes away from it for the single people.''
   A well-known nightclub at his hotel still is being repaired.
   Cancun brings in about 20 percent of all the foreign exchange
Mexico earns from tourism, collecting $500 million a year from 1
million visitors. The tourism agency said the 1988 total would be
about $30 million less.
   Hotels in the resort offered discounts when they reopened, but
some said they would raise prices to last year's levels for the peak
season _ more than $180 a night in some cases.
   The Cancun Chamber of Commerce said 10 percent to 15 percent of
non-tourist businesses closed because of the storm, in part because
hotel and restaurant employees had to live without tips.
   One manager, Giovanni Ronghi, said his hotel would be full for
the Christmas-New Year holiday and was heavily booked for the
February-April period.
   He expects business to be down 7 percent overall from last year,
``but that could change depending on how cold the United States
gets.''
   Hundreds of travel agents were brought in before the peak season.
   Gerda Vandyck of Syracuse, N.Y., said she would recommend Cancun
to clients who ``wanted to see the Yucatan and be on the beach.''
   If they ``just want to go to the beach and have peace and
quiet,'' she will send them somewhere else, Mrs. Vandyck said as a
smoke-belching bulldozer clanked by.

   When a researcher interpreting long-closed
documents concluded recently that the legendary Robert E. Peary was
not the first explorer to cross the shifting arctic ice to the North
Pole, it came as no surprise to Ralph Plaisted.
   ``We knew Peary didn't do it. All the members of our expedition
knew it,'' said Plaisted, who led a group of nine do-it-yourself
snowmobile explorers to the pole in April 1968 in the first
``indisputable'' conquest by surface.
   Still, Plaisted was an asterisk in the record books behind Peary
until this fall, when original navigational records, uncovered from
Peary's 1909 dog-sled voyage, indicated the renowned explorer
probably never got closer than 121 miles from the pole.
   Though Peary's record has been in doubt from the day he returned,
a Senate committee and the influential National Geographic Society,
which co-sponsored the Peary expedition, certified his claim in
1911. Peary was promoted to rear admiral in the Navy and retired on
a comfortable pension.
   ``He became wealthy from books and lecture fees, but I didn't,''
said Plaisted, now 61, sitting in a study adorned with clothing,
photographs and memorabilia from his expedition in the large mobile
home he shares with his wife.
   Plaisted said his own difficulties in the arctic, including a
failed expedition in 1967, convinced him that Peary's claim was only
wishful.
   ``He said he went to the North Pole in 37 days and came back over
the same trail in 16, and we knew that couldn't happen because the
roads we built were gone in a few hours,'' said Plaisted. ``Up
there, there're 5{ million square miles of ocean and it's moving
constantly.''
   His own expedition took ``43 days, 2 hours and 30 minutes.''
   For 20 years, Plaisted and his crew, which included a
schoolteacher, a lawyer, a doctor and a movie cameraman, had to
content themselves with knowing inside that they were first.
   Meanwhile, Plaisted ran his own insurance agency until 1971, when
he and his family built a log cabin near a remote lake in
Saskatchewan and lived for a year on moose and caribou meat, fish
and canned food. He and his wife now run a small fishing camp at the
site for spring and summer vacationers.
   ``If I had started 20 years ago and tried to promote myself and
say, `I know Peary didn't do it and I know I did and I should be in
the history books instead of Peary,' they would have said, `It's
just sour grapes. He doesn't have any proof,''' Plaisted said.
   Proof that Peary never reached the pole came when Baltimore
astronomer Dennis Rawlins unearthed and analyzed Peary's
navigational observations from the day he claimed to have been at
the pole.
   The notes, sealed for 50 years, didn't jibe with real
observations, according to Rawlins.
   ``The sun is virtually steady at the North Pole, whereas here we
have it rising rapidly,'' he said. ``The position I've calculated
from the data is 88 degrees and 15 minutes latitude, 14 degrees
longitude, if his clock was correct.
   ``It means he was 105 nautical miles (or 121 statute miles) from
the pole.''
   Even National Geographic, a champion of the Peary legacy for
nearly 80 years, has published an article indicating that Peary
faked his greatest achievement.
   Wally Herbert, a British polar explorer, wrote in the magazine's
September issue that Peary apparently inserted after his return the
page in his diary where he celebrated reaching ``The Pole at last.''
   Though evidence suggests Peary perpetrated a hoax, Plaisted,
Rawlins and Herbert all say he was a great navigator with a noble
goal and shouldn't be judged too harshly.
   ``He's 53 years old, his feet are frozen and he knows he's never
going to do it again, and he's 121 miles from the North Pole,'' said
Plaisted, referring to Peary's loss of eight toes in six
expeditions. ``With his supplies, he knew, `I can get there, but I
can't get back.'
   ``I know he didn't want to lie.''
   Because of the dangers, Plaisted says he ``wouldn't go back there
if you put a million dollars on my desk right now.''
   His group spent months in northern Minnesota training on
snowmobiles, which had just been invented. They wore $1,000
synthetic outfits based on Eskimo designs, and signed up 89
financial backers.
   When the expedition reached the pole _ ``one mass of jumbled ice
not any different from anywhere else up there'' _ Plaisted's group
spent the night waiting for a U.S. Air Force plane to fly over and
document their achievement.
   ``The next morning at 10 o'clock we had to move our tents some 2{
miles so we could be in the same position as the night before,'' he
said.
   Three types of Air Force navigational instruments confirmed the
90 degrees North position and the Plaisted Expedition became known
in the Guinness Book of World Records as ``the earliest indisputable
attainment of the North Pole over sea ice.''
   The discrediting of Peary's claim means Plaisted will take his
place beside such polar record holders as Roald Amundsen of Norway,
who in 1911 was the first person to reach the South Pole and in 1926
reached the North Pole by airboat, and Joseph Fletcher, the first
person to stand at the North Pole after flying there in 1925.
   ``I've been called and told they're going to change the history
books,'' Plaisted said, laughing. ``I said that and 50 cents will
get me a cup of coffee.''
   But he acknowledges the recognition is better late than never.
   ``Now I can write the book I want to write'' about the
expedition, he said. ``To write it before, it would just be sour
grapes to the National Geographic and they'd shoot me down.
   ``I should be very grateful that people created this hoax long
enough for me to be born, grow up and raise enough money to make the
expedition,'' Plaisted said.
   ``If they had said Peary didn't do it, then there would have been
someone who would have before me.''

<HEAD>In Northeast, Farm Laborers Much in Demand</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL ARABAS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ORWELL, Vt. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Joe Wedge only makes $4 an hour, but the
benefits are good. He gets a house, free heat, electricity, beef and
all the milk his family can drink.
   His employers say it's the least they can do to make sure he
stays on the job.
   Wedge is a farm laborer.
   That makes him hot property in a part of the country where a
booming economy and low unemployment have forced up wages and
created a severe labor shortage for the dairy farmer. Some experts
say the labor crunch ranks second only to development pressures in
pushing Northeast farmers out of business.
   Those farmers who are staying in business are cutting back
operations, simplifying chores, turning to employment agencies or
increasing worker benefits, such as housing, health insurance,
pension funds, paid vacation, holidays, livestock and even pizza.
   ``One of the most important things is creating an environment
where people really have fun in the workplace,'' says Gary Maas, who
advises farmers on labor problems and runs an agricultural
headhunting service from his home in Massena, Iowa.
   ``Every once in a while, do something wild. Bring in a pizza or
something.''
   Farm experts say the labor problem has become acute in the last
few years, due to a dwindling pool of workers in the 16 to 24 age
group and the bustling Northeast economy. This fall, Vermont's
unemployment rate dropped to 1.9 percent, setting a nationwide low.
   Apple orchardists overcome the problem by hiring migrant
laborers. But dairy farms are year-round businesses, and it's hard
to keep workers when the competition is a construction firm or a
Burger King.
   Maas, who was in New England recently conducting seminars on farm
labor management, took note of competing fast-food wages. ``I think
in Manchester (N.H.) I saw they were paying $6.79 an hour,'' he said.
   Wedge works for Tom and Mike Audet, brothers who have worked more
than 15 years on their 250-head dairy farm two miles from the New
York state line.
   ``The first eight years, we tried to do it by ourselves with a
high school kid,'' Tom says in the barn's maternity ward, where a
pregnant Holstein is about to calve.
   But the pool of high school students dwindled and the farm
expanded to 1,000 acres, 250 cows and 3,300 maple sugar taps. Over
the next six years, the Audets hired and lost 11 full-time workers.
   They added a house this year after their 11th worker showed up
one day in damp clothing. His tent had blown down in an ice storm.
   ``The house payment is $225 a month for 30 years,'' Tom says as
he keeps an eye on the pregnant cow. ``So we can afford to pay a
full-time man and not pay a lot of interest on the money we
borrowed.''
   ``We decided if we're going to hire someone, let's give them a
break and let them walk to work,'' Mike says.
   Wedge, a thin man with glasses, red hair and a beard, says the
house was a major reason he came to work on the Audets' farm 3{
months ago. He'd been working in construction.
   ``I get to play with the tractors,'' the 28-year-old Wedge says
with a smile. ``I like machinery and cows. We get a house provided,
lights, heat, all the milk you can drink. They give so much beef a
year. The hours are shorter than any other farm I've worked on.''
   But while the Audets are ahead in the benefits game, many farmers
have a ways to go to learn it, says Tom Maloney, an agricultural
extension associate at Cornell University in Ithaca, N.Y. He
recently conducted a survey of 122 New York dairy farms and found
most employers were not keeping pace with health, retirement and
other benefits such as sick days and paid holidays.
   ``We found out of 88 employees, for example, that on average they
received two paid vacation days per year, and the average work week
was 60 hours,'' Maloney says.
   The Audets and others point out that extra benefits will only
help if farmers can still find workers.
   ``I think we may have to be looking at Mexicans, Jamaicans,''
Mike says. ``Maybe these are the things we have to be thinking of
because the labor just isn't here.''
   ``Part of it is the image of agricultural jobs, which is long
hours, hard work and low pay, and I don't think we've done nearly
enough in emphasizing some of the positive aspects of farm work,''
Maloney says. ``However, if you don't fix some of those things like
the low pay issue, you don't really stand a chance of turning the
image around.''
   Wedge drives a tractor down the Audets' road as the brothers
stand on a hillside gazing at the land between their home and Lake
Champlain. Acres of golden hayfields lie beneath the slate-blue sky,
separated only by stands of trees, an occasional fence, or a barn
and silos.
   Tom points to one of four farms the eye can see. It's up for
development, and the one just beyond it has already been sold and
split into 10-acre strips.
   The brothers depart for lunch, while Wedge returns to the
cowbarn. He opens a door and the milkers stream inside and head for
their respective stalls.
   ``Time flies on a farm. That's another good thing about it,''
Wedge says. ``And I like to be with the animals.
   ``I've tried other jobs and I always go back to farming because
it keeps you healthy.''

<HEAD>New Year Looms As Challenge For Investors</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Savers and investors need an extra dose of
foresight as they try to plan how to manage their money in 1989.
   In addition to the usual imponderables _ the likely direction of
the economy, interest rates and stock prices _ they are faced with
the first change of occupancy at the White House in eight years.
   President-elect George Bush and a Democratic Congress are under
mounting pressure to shrink the federal budget deficit. The
decisions they make, or don't make, are likely to influence the
outlook for investments of many kinds.
   ``Expert'' opinion isn't much help in sorting out prospects for
the new year. A sampling of about a dozen financial forecasts for
1989 yields these conclusions:
   The economy either will, or will not, slip into recession.
Interest rates probably will come down if the economy slows, but
they may rise further before the decline starts. And the stock
market _ well, it will fluctuate.
   But there still are ways to plot a reasonable plan of action,
based on what is known now and on educated guesses you can make
about the future.
   The unusual pattern of interest rates that prevails as 1988 draws
to a close makes some income-producing investments look appealing
and others chancy.
   Rates on many relatively short-term investments, with lives of
two to 10 years or so, are now as high as, or higher than, what you
can get with a longer-term commitment.
   For example, as of mid-December 30-year Treasury bonds were
yielding 9.02 percent, while three-year Treasury notes offered a
9.17 percent yield.
   In these circumstances, known to investment professionals as an
``inverted yield curve,'' there isn't much incentive to take the
extra risks involved with a long maturity.
   Or consider a five-year certificate of deposit yielding somewhere
around 10.29 percent _ the national average at banks and savings
institutions reported by Bank Rate Monitor as of Dec. 7.
   Like Treasury securities, CDs are available with the backing of
the federal government, in the form of deposit insurance.
   There's no overlooking the much-publicized threat to the deposit
insurance system of insolvent savings institutions, with an unpaid
bill that grows larger by the day.
   Among the government's possible options in dealing with this
problem, however, reneging on its promise to depositors does not
seem workable, even if someone thought it was a desirable choice.
Discrediting deposit insurance would likely create havoc in all the
markets.
   If you are convinced that interest rates are headed higher in
early 1989, a logical choice would be to keep your nest egg in a
money-market investment with a very short maturity.
   The average yield of money-market mutual funds, as reported by
Donoghue's Moneyletter of Holliston, Mass., recently stood at 7.75
percent. It would quickly move up further if short-term rates
continue their recent rise.
   The newsletter's current view: ``Long-term bond funds are not
attractive now compared to money funds or even short-term bond
funds. Investors just are not being paid to be in more volatile
long-term bond funds.
   ``We think the time for a switch to long-term bond funds will
come, but it hasn't yet.''
   Prospects for stocks and stock mutual funds continue to confound
a lot of very sharp minds. Many experienced investors have been
waiting since early in 1988 for a market decline and a recession to
make stocks available at bargain prices.
   So far the market has refused to accommodate them.
   As Thomas Bailey, chairman of the Janus Group of mutual funds,
put it in a recent note to shareholders, ``Today's stock market is
`OK.' But it does not represent any real bargain.''

<HEAD>`Very Special Christmas' Emphasizes Network Economics</HEAD>

   Television networks aren't exactly Scrooges _
they'll jump headfirst down a chimney with a bagful of toys if it'll
pull an audience.
   ``A Very Special Christmas Party,'' tonight on ABC, is an example
of a holiday variety program that rings with good will. It's a
one-hour celebration of the triumphs of the mentally retarded.
   Yet, ultimately, the show must also deliver viewers to ABC, and
toward that end, it's filled with the kind of celebrities _ Barbara
Mandrell, Danny De Vito, Randy Travis, Susan Saint James and Mike
Tyson, to name a few _ to whom television fans are drawn.
   ``We have more star power than any other Christmas special,''
said John Hamlin, ABC's vice president of special programs.
   In the end, both ABC and Special Olympics, the show's host, hope
to realize separate goals: ABC gets a low-cost _ about $650,000 _
holiday special to compete with NBC's ``The Cosby Show.'' And
Special Olympics, which organizes athletic competitions for the
mentally retarded, receives the kind of free publicity that drives
charitable organizations skyward.
   ``The show will make the abilities of people with mental
retardation real and apparent to millions of people,'' said Sargent
Shriver, who joins his wife, Eunice Kennedy Shriver, in heading
Special Olympics. ``People (who watch the show) can see that
mentally retarded people can do things in sports that ... 90 percent
of us can't do.
   ``We live with and struggle with the mentally retarded every step
of the way (in the program). ... Nothing can do that as well as
television.''
   But almost as soon as television becomes ``well-intentioned,'' it
grows dull, too. Thus, the difficulty in assembling ``A Very Special
Christmas'' was to create a program that could be both entertaining
and educational, engaging but not maudlin, and all on a shoestring
budget.
   ``There is a challenge to maintain a certain tone of commercial
interest,'' acknowledged Gary Smith, the director. ``We will need to
have celebrities for a good, long time because that's part of the
integration.''
   ABC realizes that ``A Very Special Christmas Party'' is unlikely
to be a ratings hit. Nor will it bolster the network's corporate
image. It's a programming move and nothing more.
   ``This is not something where we sat down and said, `Let's do
something for charity,''' said ABC's Hamlin. ``Nobody at ABC is . ..
committed to Special Olympics more than anything else.''
   At the same time, ABC senses that the drama and emotion of the
mentally retarded becoming part of mainstream society has inherent
commercial appeal.
   Who wouldn't want to watch a mentally retarded person execute a
flawless ice skating routine with gold-medal winner Scott Hamilton?
And isn't there some widespread appeal in Arnold Schwarzenegger
helping a Special Olympian lift weights?
   Hamlin, who once volunteered for Special Olympics, in the summer
of 1987 in South Bend, Ind., said the organization's sports
activities produce ``a positive feeling'' that can't be described.
   ``When I went to the Special Olympics, that was a tremendous
experience,'' Hamlin said. ``Watching the athletes coming into the
stadium ... it's very hard to explain.''
   Bobby Shriver, the show's executive producer and son of Sargent
Shriver, said: ``The charge is a hard thing to put into words. It's
a feeling you get at a very sweet Christmas moment.''
   But such poignancy has been ignored by most of the media for
years. Sargent Shriver said that 15 years ago, Special Olympics
approached Life magazine about a photographic spread. ``They said,
`We don't want to drive our readers away.'''
   He said he had similar difficulty persuading Sports Illustrated
to cover the Special Olympics. Then, after years of saying no, the
magazine published a comprehensive report on last summer's games.
   Still, last summer's Special Olympics, covered in a two-hour
special by ABC, were a difficult sell. ``ABC felt that they could
not sell it to their regular customers,'' said Bobby Shriver, who
volunteered to line up advertisers on his own.
   This year, though, the advertisers have come without urging _
Procter & Gamble and RJR Nabisco will split the commercials during
``A Very Special Christmas.''
   Procter & Gamble, for one, says it's not looking to position
itself as the maker of, say, some philanthropic toothpaste. Said a
company spokeswoman: ``(The ads) were purchased for media value
only.''

<HEAD>To Some People, A Crisis Would Be Just The Thing For U.S. Economy</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: John Cunniff is on vacation.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   If the economy were a good book, there would be a
crisis one of these days.
   The stock market would crash and stay crashed, or inflation would
shoot up, or unemployment would soar.
   Things would get bad. But there would be a silver lining.
Everybody would realize that something had to be done about the
problems that caused the crisis.
   The crisis would galvanize the country into action.
   ``Great crises produce great men and great deeds of courage,''
John F. Kennedy wrote in 1956 in ``Profiles in Courage.''
   In a good book, the stock market crash on Oct. 19, 1987, would
have been the perfect crisis to climax a tale of greed,
short-sightedness and easy living.
   Unfortunately, at least from a literary point of view, the
recalcitrant economy kept chugging along and the moral of the story
got lost.
   The economy, it seems, is not a good book. It's kind of a bad
book, actually.
   Realizing this, some people who believe the economy really does
have serious problems have stopped waiting for a crisis to galvanize
the country into action.
   These people are starting to say there may never be a crisis.
Instead, they say, there could be gradual, imperceptible decay _
what is sometimes known as ``the British disease.''
   They're reaching for a literary device again to explain their
ideas, but this time it's the metaphor.
   ``A failure to move quickly on the (federal budget) deficit
doesn't necessarily mean a recession of the kind people like to
write about,'' Paul Samuelson of Massachusetts Institute of
Technology said in an interview this week in the Wall Street Journal.
   ``It's more like the radon problem in the basement of the new
house I'm building,'' Samuelson said, coining a memorable phrase.
``The clock is ticking all the time, but nothing big happens that
you can suddenly write about in the Wall Street Journal.''
   Samuelson is not alone in the metaphor concoction business:
   ``It's like one more pack of cigarettes. It isn't a wolf at the
door; it's termites in the basement,'' says Charles Schultze, a
Brookings Institution scholar who is the former chairman of
President Carter's Council of Economic Advisers.
   Schultze is of two minds about the new metaphorical approach. He
is not so sure, he said, that talk of cigarettes, radon and termites
will galvanize the American public as effectively as a good,
old-fashioned crisis would.
   ``The real tragedy of the budget deficit is it's never been a
tragedy,'' Schultze said in an AP interview this week, using yet
another literary device, the paradox.
   The United States has in recent years become the world's largest
debtor, obliging future generations to pay a fat chunk of the
national income to foreigners in the form of rents, dividends and
interest.
   But as long as the economy keeps perking along, it has been hard
to focus attention on the underlying deterioration in the U.S.
investment accounts.
   Come to think of it, T.S. Eliot may have seen it coming six
decades ago in this economic forecast:
   ``This is the way the world ends
   ``Not with a bang but a whimper.''

<HEAD>Family, Health Issues to Be Aired Anew in 101st Congress</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dozens of health care, child care and family
bills that died this year with the 100th Congress are bound for
resuscitation in 1989, their prospects at once better and worse than
before.
   On the plus side, President-elect Bush repeatedly called for ``a
kinder, gentler nation'' during his campaign and proposed to spend
more on child care, health care, education and homeless aid.
   Lawmakers are seizing on Bush's interest to promote their own
versions of child care and other social initiatives, taking heart in
what they view as a consensus on ends if not means.
   On the other side of the coin is Bush's pledge of ``no new
taxes.'' If he keeps that vow, says one key lawmaker, no social
projects are likely to make it into the blueprint for fiscal 1990
spending.
   ``If the president-elect will move on his position on (tax)
revenues, we can make room for some of these initiatives,'' said
Rep. Leon Panetta, D-Calif., incoming chairman of the House Budget
Committee. ``If we could pick up half of a deficit reduction package
in revenues (as opposed to cuts), we would make room.'' He said that
would amount to about $15 billion in new taxes.
   ``The worst consequence of the deficit problem is that we are
losing resources that could be devoted to (social) priorities,''
Panetta added. ``We're paying $166 billion in interest on the debt.
That's money that's not going for hunger, housing, nutrition and day
care.''
   Panetta's Senate counterpart, Tennessee Democrat Jim Sasser,
stopped short of giving Bush an ultimatum but indicated that without
new tax revenues, domestic spending increases will have to wait.
   ``It may be possible to redirect some resources to some domestic
needs,'' Sasser said, speculating that dollars could be shifted from
defense to education, health care and infrastructure. ``Maybe not
this year, maybe not next year, maybe the year after.''
   Budget woes and philosophical splits over the last two years
buried proposals to expand child care, guarantee parental leave,
provide nursing home and home health care benefits, increase the
minimum wage, require employer-sponsored worker health benefits and
offer tax breaks to families with children.
   All are certain to be back this year, along with Bush's campaign
proposals. And most will come through the House Education and Labor
Committee chaired by Augustus Hawkins, D-Calif., who has a pledge of
his own: to promote anything his committee thinks will be good for
the country _ cost be damned.
   ``We're just going to pass them and allow them (the budget
architects) to adjust the budget in such a way as to pay for them,''
Hawkins said in an interview. ``We're not advocating anything we
can't justify. ... We think they will create earnings and reduce
social costs'' in the long run.
   But Hawkins' attitude is increasingly rare on Capitol Hill.
   ``Pay as you go is the rule. We crossed that threshold with
catastrophic health care,'' said Panetta, referring to the 100th
Congress' expansion of Medicare coverage. The program is being paid
for by beneficiaries.
   Along the same lines, House Ways and Means Chairman Dan
Rostenkowski, D-Ill., said this month that members of his
tax-writing committee ``are not going to endorse any new spending or
revenue-losing proposal, however meritorious, unless it is included
in a package that is self-financing.''
   Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, the senior Republican on the Labor and
Human Resources Committee, said a tax hike at least for some
segments of society will be necessary to finance new social programs
if Bush and Congress do not cut spending.
   ``What we've got to do is find offsets,'' he said. ``We're going
to have to make priority choices between competing programs. We're
going to have to get the money from some that aren't really that
important.''
   But Hatch, who chaired his committee when the GOP controlled the
Senate, conceded most programs are well-intentioned and many work
well. Short of cuts to offset new spending, he suggested that a
multi-billion dollar child-care program might, for example, be
financed by a new tax on major corporations.
   The tax would be imposed ``on the theory that they should be
leading out in this area,'' Hatch said. ``We could alleviate the tax
if they do something for child care. The workforce is diminishing.
It's in their best interest to get involved.''
   Among the major social initiatives expected in the 101st Congress:
   CHILD CARE. Democrats will reintroduce their $2.5 billion Act for
Better Child Care, designed to subsidize day care for lower income
people and bring care up to minimum federal health, safety and
staffing standards. Bush has proposed a $2.2 billion plan to expand
Head Start, make the dependent care credit available in the form of
a refund to those who owe no taxes, and give a tax break to
low-income families with young children, whether or not they are in
day care. A middle-ground, bipartisan proposal may be forthcoming
from the Senate Finance Committee.
   HEALTH CARE. Competing needs include long-term nursing home care,
a pet project of new Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell,
D-Maine; long-term home care, pushed by Rep. Claude Pepper, D-Fla.,
and health insurance for the 37 million Americans who don't have it.
On the last, Bush has proposed letting people ``buy into Medicaid.''
But some congressional heavyweights including Sen. Edward Kennedy,
D-Mass., and Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., want all employers to
provide coverage _ which would help two-thirds of those now
uncovered. Rostenkowski, for his part, has said there is no way
Congress can take care of long-term care and the uninsured in one
session.
   FAMILY LEAVE. Bush has said women shouldn't have to worry about
losing their jobs if they take time off to care for new babies.
That's far short of congressional proposals that would require
businesses to give leave to both parents to care for newborn, newly
adopted or seriously ill children, to employees with serious medical
problems themselves, and in one case to employees to care for ailing
relatives. But some lawmakers are optimistic about a compromise,
given Bush's interest in the issue.
   MINIMUM WAGE. Efforts to raise the minimum wage stalled in the
100th Congress over President Reagan's insistence on linking any
hike to the creation of a subminimum training wage. Bush also favors
a subminimum wage, but has not been specific about to whom it would
apply. Kennedy, a prime mover on the issue, believes there may be
room for negotiation and a chance for early passage.
   EDUCATION. Bush has proposed a $500 million merit schools program
to reward schools that get good results from largely disadvantaged
student bodies. He also has proposed a $50 million fund to spur the
establishment of magnet schools.
   HOMELESS. Bush said in the campaign that the McKinney Act
designed to help the homeless should be fully funded. For the first
two years of the act, Congress released only $713 million of an
authorized $1.1 billion. This year Congress appropriated $378
million for the homeless act, considerably less than the auhorized
ceiling of $634 million.

   On a spring night in 1987, the bright, musically
talented wife of a prominent Methodist minister was brutally
attacked at her home. There were no arrests, no suspects and only
the darkest hint of a motive, and a shattering series of events and
revelations after the attempted murder only deepened the mystery.
The first of three parts on the mystery of Walker and Peggy Railey
begins with the attack.

<TEXT>
   Bewildered friends and followers would recall he
looked tired and depressed, still grief-stricken and mystified over
the savage assault on his wife.
   Little more than a week had passed since he found her comatose on
the garage floor, choked senseless and left for dead.
   She had not regained consciousness.
   Now, in the early evening hours of April 30, 1987, the intense,
balding young man excused himself and disappeared into a private
hospital suite.
   He locked and chained the door, sat down with pen and paper and
began composing a chilling letter.
   ``There is a demon inside my soul,'' he wrote. ``It has always
been there. My demon tries to lead me down paths I do not want to
follow. At times that demon has lured me into doing things I do not
want to do.
   ``... My demon has finally gotten the upper hand.''
   When security officers broke in the next morning, they found him
sprawled across the bed. He was alive but unconscious and in
critical condition.
   Nearby were empty bottles of prescription drugs and his rambling
letter, which began with instructions for his funeral and ended
thusly:
   ``I have finally made the decision to take care of myself. I have
grown weak. God has remained strong. Therein lies your hope. I have
none.
   ``Walker L. Railey.''

   The vicious attack on Walker Railey's wife and his ensuing
suicide attempt devastated three families, split a church and
outraged a city.
   For Peggy Railey was by no means an ordinary homemaker, and her
husband was perhaps Dallas' most dynamic and socially conscious
young minister. At 39, Walker Railey reigned as the senior pastor of
the city's 6,000-member First United Methodist Church and loomed as
a rising star in his mainstream Protestant denomination.
   The news of the suicide attempt swept through town, nowhere more
devastatingly than at First Methodist, where Railey's flock was
already reeling from the attempted murder.
   His chief assistant, the Rev. Gordon Casad, told the congregation
the next Sunday, ``We must remember our pastor and the troubling of
his mind and spirit and keep him in our prayers.''
   Asked if Railey was now a suspect, Park Stearns, supervisor in
the Dallas FBI office, replied: ``This is a big no comment.''
   Although police refused to reveal the contents of Railey's
letter, they described it as an apparent suicide note. And they
redoubled their efforts to review with the convalescing minister
what happened the night his wife was attacked.
   A fellow pastor, the Rev. David Shawyer of Plymouth Park
Methodist Church, said, ``I'm praying that it is not what it looks
like. I'm praying that what the police are suggesting could never be
true.
   ``I'm praying this will all come out some other way.''

<TEXT>
   Railey's attempt on his own life was only the latest twist in
what would be called Dallas' most haunting and sensational mystery
in a decade. One unrestrained commentator called the attempted
murder the city's most extraordinary crime since the assassination
of President Kennedy.
   Peggy Railey survived but only barely so. Comatose, she could not
identify her assailant.
   Several anonymous, typewritten death threats preceded the attack,
apparently provoked by Railey's strong sermons and public statements
against racial prejudice and injustice. But friends said Mrs. Railey
did not frighten easily, and she had encouraged her husband not to
soften his stand.
   The last letter was slipped under the door of a church office
just prior to Easter Sunday services. It said: ``EASTER IS WHEN
CHRIST AROSE, BUT YOU ARE GOING DOWN.''
   Under the stern scrutiny of security officers, Railey delivered
his Easter sermon wearing a bulletproof vest beneath his robes.
   It would be his last appearance in the pulpit of First
Methodist's historic old sanctuary. He hammered the congregation
with a theme of death and resurrection that morning.
   ``You're going to die,'' he said, pointing his finger at
parishioners.
   ``You're going to die,'' he repeated.
   ``I'm going to die.''

   Police and church officials first theorized that the attempt on
Peggy Railey's life was some kind of grotesque retaliation for her
husband's outspokenness.
   With his wife in critical condition, Railey stationed himself
outside her hospital room, interrupting his vigil only for a trip
downtown to give investigators an account of his activities the
night of April 21.
   He said he'd spent the evening doing research at Southern
Methodist University libraries. Returning home about 12:40 a.m., he
said, he noticed that a door to the darkened two-car garage was
partly open.
   Driving inside with his headlights on, he found his wife lying on
the floor, writhing in convulsions. Her face was puffy and
discolored and she was frothing at the mouth.
   He said the children, Ryan, 5, and Megan, 2, were inside the
house and unharmed.
   Following the interview, Capt. John Holt, 37, the tall,
sandy-haired supervisor of crimes against persons, told reporters
the questioning was routine.
   ``We don't have any indicators that would point to him as a
suspect,'' he said.
   Railey returned to the hospital to arrange for a suite near his
wife. He spent the day greeting a parade of visitors who expressed
shock, sorrow and support.
   Among those who came to share their grief that day was a striking
frosted blonde who carried a single red rose and disappeared into
Railey's hospital suite.

   ``He's just numb. ... He's overwhelmed by it,'' said Ralph
Shannon, a longtime church member.
   If Railey was silent, his ministerial colleagues were not.
   Rabbi Joseph Ofseyer of Congregation Shearith Israel said Railey
had suffered for his message of justice and equality but that the
religious community would not ``be cowed into silence'' and ``permit
such a person to stand alone.''
   Almost lost or overlooked in the outcry was an observation by
Police Lt. Ron Waldrop that the abusive letters appeared to be the
work of one individual and not the concerted effort of a white
supremacist group.
   ``There's no central theme,'' he added.
   A short time later, the FBI determined that the death threats had
been written on an office typewriter at First Methodist.

   Walker Railey's rise to clerical prominence seemed almost
preordained from his turbulent childhood days in Owensboro, Ky., a
coal mining town on the south bank of the Ohio River.
   The oldest of three children, Railey grew up a non-smoker and
non-drinker who delivered his first sermon at age 17 and became
something of a circuit preacher while a history major at Western
Kentucky University.
   He attended Vanderbilt Divinity School for a year, then headed to
Dallas and the Perkins Theological Seminary at SMU.
   It was there, in 1970, that he met Margaret Nicolai, an equally
talented, intelligent and religiously dedicated young musician whom
everyone called Peggy. She had arrived at SMU from Wisconsin to
pursue a master's degree in organ music.
   Acquaintances say Peggy recognized early on that young Walker was
a man with great ambition and potential but that she was not much
taken with him romantically. His persistence won her over and the
couple was married in August 1971.
   After obtaining a doctor of ministry in 1973, Railey ministered
to several rural churches in Oklahoma and then was appointed an
associate pastor at First Methodist in Dallas. In 1980, after a
stint as a senior minister at a suburban Dallas church, he returned
to First Methodist as senior pastor at age 33.
   The appointment was the most dramatic step in a meteoric rise.
While not even the largest Methodist church in Dallas, First
Methodist had the reputation as the nation's mother church of
Methodism, in no small part because eight of its ministers had gone
on to become bishops.
   Under Railey's leadership, First Methodist grew and prospered,
its membership approaching 6,000 and its annual budget doubling to
$2 million. And while Railey himself was short, balding and
physically unimposing, his radiant ministry served as a magnet for
the young, energetic and socially conscious while not alienating
older, more conservative parishioners.
   He spoke out boldly against those who practiced or condoned
racial intolerance. He clashed with a City Council member over what
he perceived to be a racist stance on illegal aliens.
   He challenged President Reagan to take a ``more visible and
articulate stand'' for peace and he once said of fundamentalist
Jerry Falwell, ``I guarantee he doesn't speak for the Kingdom of
God, let alone the people in it.''
   When the threats came, the Raileys seemed to take them in stride.
The FBI encouraged Mrs. Railey and the children to leave town for a
while. Although she went to her parents' home for four days, she did
not seem overly concerned.
   Diane Yarrington, wife of First Methodist's minister of music and
one of Peggy Railey's closest friends, said Peggy told her she and
Walker were taking precautions but that they refused to be
intimidated.
   Long before the attack, the Yarringtons and Raileys pledged to
care for one another's children in the event of tragedy.
   That pledge would soon come due.

<TEXT>
   As Railey and his wife lay near death in the same intensive care
unit, police were anxious to talk again with First Methodist's
senior pastor. After his first interview, police found unspecified
``inconsistencies'' in Railey's account of April 21.
   Friends in the church hired a tough, no-nonsense criminal defense
attorney named Doug Mulder to advise Railey, and as the minister
recovered, he wasn't talking to police.
   He did, however, speak with reporters.
   ``To be honest with you ... I just don't know anything,'' he told
a veteran religion reporter.
   Later, he told The Associated Press:
   ``I didn't attack my wife. I didn't plan to have someone attack
my wife. I didn't orchestrate a plan to attack my wife. And if I had
written the letters, I wouldn't have written them on a typewriter in
the church.
   ``But I didn't write them.''
   He could not rationalize his suicide attempt, which he knew was
construed by some as an admission of guilt.
   ``I don't understand why I did it, anymore than I understand why
I lived beyond it.''
   By this time, doctors had removed Mrs. Railey's respirator and
she was now breathing on her own. She was not comatose as such but
in what doctors described as a ``vegetative state'' _ appearing to
have sleep-and-wake cycles and respond to sound and pain.
   In fact, she was oblivious to her surroundings.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Mulder arranged for a private polygraph test, which indicated
Railey did not try to kill his wife. Presumably because of those
results, Mulder approved a police-administered examination the next
day. That exercise was described as ``inconclusive.''
   ``The results showed that he didn't have anything to do with the
attack, nor did he conspire with anyone,'' said Mulder.
   Though Railey's followers took new heart, investigators were
unimpressed and restated the ongoing request to interview him.
   Holt accused Mulder of misrepresenting the outcome of the
police-administered examination. He suggested that some of Railey's
responses were ``untruthful,'' but refused to elaborate.
   All but overlooked in the flap over the polygraphs was an
unattributed police statement that Railey's account of his
activities the night of April 21 was ``in direct conflict with
indisputable evidence.''
   The key word was ``indisputable.''

   With Peggy Railey unresponsive to treatment and
unable to identify her assailant, the Rev. Walker Railey played a
cat-and-mouse game with police who wanted to question him further
about the April 1987 attempted murder of his wife. As summer began,
a third figure emerged, the same one who carried a single rose into
the minister's hospital suite. In this second of three parts, a web
of ``indisputable evidence'' leads Railey and the other woman to a
showdown with an angry prosecutor.

   The frosted blonde with the sparkling eyes was no
stranger to the congregation at First United Methodist Church. Lucy
Papillon grew up in the magnificent sanctuary, the daughter of the
Rev. Robert E. Goodrich Jr., a former senior pastor and later a
Methodist bishop.
   A portrait of Goodrich, who died in 1985, hangs in the First
Methodist foyer.
   ``She had that knotted Goodrich chin, his thin, drawn smile, and
the dark eyes that were his most distinctive feature _ eyes that
seemed remote but also searching and intelligent,'' journalist Larry
Wright, a childhood acquaintance, wrote in Texas Monthly.
   ``It was a strong face, like her father's, and if in some lights
it appeared hard, in others you could detect a vulnerable and even
wounded soul who had lived past the point where life surprised her.''
   As a youngster, Lucy played the piano in Sunday school and was a
cheerleader at an exclusive girls' school. She entered Southern
Methodist University in 1959 to pursue a degree in music education
and, four years later, married a Methodist preacher.
   They were divorced in 1973 after she bore two sons.
   Friends say she worked at a variety of jobs, including a stint as
a part-time model. Somewhere along the way she became enamored with
psychology. She married and divorced again and, in 1982, received a
doctorate in psychology and moved to California to complete her
training. She found various jobs in her new field there and
reportedly began to visit the Esalen commune.
   And it was there that Lucy decided to take on her identity as
``Papillon,'' French for butterfly. In 1986 she opened a private
psychology practice in Dallas and legally changed her name to Lucy
Papillon.

   On July 14, 1987, Dallas County's chief prosecutor sat down with
police and the FBI and heard for the first time all the facts of the
case.
   His face flushed with anger, his thick mustache almost bristling,
Norm Kinne, 53, stormed from the meeting room into a cluster of
reporters and challenged Walker Railey, as one headline proclaimed,
to ``talk or walk.''
   Eyes flashing and his finger jabbing at the nearest of four
television cameras, Kinne declared:
   ``I'm tired of this man fooling with the justice system and the
life of his wife. ... I'm going to tell you, Walker Railey, I'm
tired of you messing with the Dallas Police Department, and you're
going to come before the Dallas County grand jury and you're going
to clear up these discrepancies, or you're going to leave the
country!''
   Kinne could subpoena Railey to appear before grand jurors, but he
had no way to compel him to answer questions if he invoked the
constitutional protection against self-incrimination. Nor was it in
the fiery prosecutor's domain to order a reticent Railey out of the
country.
   But at that moment, nobody was foolhardy enough to argue the
issue with Kinne.
   Later that evening, a vaguely contrite Kinne said it was the
photographs of Peggy Railey after the attack that so outraged him
and triggered the outburst.
   ``I got irritated because we have a lady here who is a loving
wife and mother and who is lying in a hospital more dead than
alive,'' he said. ``And we have an alleged pillar of the community
who will not talk to us about this.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Six days before Kinne's outburst, a Dallas Morning News story
linked Lucy Papillon to the Railey case, calling her a potential
``reluctant witness.''
   The article said mobile telephone records revealed that Railey
called Papillon twice the night of the attack. Railey had neglected
to mention those calls in his lengthy interview with police the
morning after April 21.
   Phone records also showed Railey placed two calls to his own home
between midnight and 12:30 a.m., the last one about 10 minutes
before he reported finding his wife near death on the garage floor.
   Investigators refused to discuss the significance of the mobile
phone records but it seemed safe to assume they somehow represented
the ``indisputable evidence'' of inconsistencies in Railey's story.
   Later, on the eve of a grand jury meeting on the Railey case, the
Morning News reported that Railey had visited Papillon the night his
wife was attacked.
   Inside the jury room, Kinne was eager to confront Railey,
although he was certain the embattled minister would refuse to
answer questions and invoke his Fifth Amendment rights.
   He did take the Fifth, 43 times.
   ``I have followed the advice of my lawyer consistently and will
consistently do that,'' Railey remarked brusquely when he emerged
from the closed-door session.
   Papillon spent an hour before the panel and, according to her
attorney, Phil Burleson, answered every question. She knew nothing
about the attack, Burleson said, and then cautioned reporters
against drawing conclusions that his client was romantically linked
with Railey.
   But it made no difference. Leaks poured out of the grand jury
room. The whispered rumors were true.
   Lucy Papillon was Walker Railey's mistress.
   According to those present, Papillon told grand jurors she first
met Railey on a religious television show and they became
romantically involved in June 1986, about the same time she changed
her name. She said she had accompanied Railey on several ministerial
trips and had vacationed with him in California.
   Nor were their liaisons confined to this country. Papillon
revealed that Railey stopped over for a prearranged rendezvous in
London while returning from a World Methodist Council meeting in
Nairobi, Kenya, in July 1986.
   In one particularly chilling disclosure, Lucy said they embraced
and kissed in Walker's hospital suite while Peggy lay near death
nearby.

   Despite the sensational revelations, the grand jury testimony
raised almost as many questions as it answered. And the
``indisputable evidence'' remained cloaked in secrecy.
   ``We still have a lot of discrepancies, but we're not going to
discuss them,'' said Police Lt. Ron Waldrop. ``There is no statue of
limitations on attempted murder, and that's how long we'll be
working on it.''

   ar at church expense only hours
earlier as a security measure because of anonymous threats. A phone
company computer recorded the times.
   Railey called home at 5:55 p.m. to say he was leaving the office.
At 5:58 p.m., he telephoned Papillon and talked for one minute.
   Arriving home shortly before 6:30 p.m., Railey said he found his
wife working on a faulty garage door lock with a bar of soap.
Investigators later found no trace of soap on the lock, which was
working fine.
   Railey said he sat on the hood of his wife's Chrysler and talked
with her for several minutes. He wasn't hungry, he said, and the two
shared a glass of wine in lieu of dinner.
   He told her he intended to spend the evening on a research
project at the SMU libraries. He did not change from his business
suit and left the house a little after 6:30.
   At 6:38 p.m., Railey, who never wore a watch, called on the car
phone for the time.
   He said he spent half an hour or so at SMU's Bridwell Library and
was back in his car by 7:26 p.m., at which time he phoned the family
babysitter and discussed plans for a trip to San Antonio the Raileys
planned later in the week.
   At 7:32 p.m., he phoned Papillon at her home near SMU. He drove
directly to her house, where he spent the next 40 minutes.
   Railey told a friend later he went there to get some relaxation
tapes to help relieve stress.
   From 8 p.m. to 8:30 p.m., Railey was back at Bridwell, where he
asked a librarian what time the library closed. At 8:30, Railey,
using a pay phone, called home on a private line. Peggy Railey told
him she was putting the children to bed. She then called her parents
long distance in Tyler and talked from 8:49 p.m. until 9:14 p.m.
   At 8:53 p.m., Raily bought gas at a Texaco station near campus.
After drinking a wine cooler, he said, he returned to Fondren
Library, SMU's main library. But no one saw him there until after 11
p.m.
   At 9:30 p.m., a jogger in the Raileys' neighborhood spotted a man
in a business suit and street shoes running through a yard south of
the Railey home. Between 10:15 p.m. and 10:30 p.m., a neighbor heard
rustling sounds in the alley behind the home.
   Sometime after 11 p.m., a librarian saw Railey at Fondren. Upon
leaving at midnight, he attempted to give his business card to a
student at the checkout desk. On the back of the card was a message
requesting help in finding research information. Railey also noted
the time, 10:30 p.m., when in fact it was midnight, the student told
police.
   At 12:03 a.m., Railey called home on the car phone, but this time
he used the public line. According to friends, the family seldom
answered the public line, which was connected to an answering
machine.
   ``Hi, Babe,'' he said. ``I'm calling you from my mobile phone.
Peg, it's about, oh, I don't know. I don't have a watch. It's
somewhere between 10:30 and 10:45, somewhere along in there. I
worked at Bridwell until they closed and now I'm going to Fondren.''
   This could not have been true. He had in fact just left Fondren,
according to other accounts.
   ``I'll be in about 1. If you want to, go ahead and lock the
garage door and I'll park out front. It really doesn't matter to me
at this point. My concern is that you're safe. ...''
   This portion of the tape might explain why Peggy Railey would
enter the garage that night. Even so, Railey would still have to
explain why, if he really intended to speak with his wife, he had
called on the public line and left a message.
   Twenty-three minutes later, Railey phoned the answering machine
again, and on this occasion gave the correct time: 12:29.
   ``Hi, Babe,'' he began. ``It's 12:29 and I'm on the way home from
SMU. ... Everything really went well. I got a lot accomplished. I
had to leave my card with the reference librarian because there was
one deal that I couldn't quite work out. I'm not calling on the
private line because I know you're already asleep, but in case you
get up with the kids, I just wanted you to know that I'm on my way
home. It's 12:30. I'll be home about 12:45.
   ``Love you. Bye-bye.''
   At just past 12:40, Railey drove into his driveway and found his
wife.
   There was no sign of a struggle. There was no skin under her
fingernails to indicate she had either fought her assailant or
scratched herself when grasping at whatever was pulled around her
throat.
   Railey said he determined that the children were safe and
notified police.
   ``Dallas Emergency, Ms. ...,'' the dispatcher answered.
   ``This is Walker Railey,'' he interrupted. ``Send the paramedics
and police, please.''
   An ambulance arrived, along with neighbors. Inside the house,
both children were in the living room, Megan watching a silent
television screen and Ryan staring blankly ahead.
   Months later, Kinne told a reporter he thought it possible that
Ryan witnessed the attack, but he said the youngster gave
investigators inconsistent accounts of what might have happened that
night.
   ``Maybe Daddy did it,'' the boy told investigators once.

   Police say Peggy Railey was attacked between 9:30
and 11 p.m. on April 21, 1987; no one can account for her husband's
whereabouts at that time. Walker Railey did leave a message that
night on the household answering machine. He said it was 10:30 p.m.,
but a phone company computer showed it was after midnight. That
merely proved he was a liar, police said, not a strangler. The final
of three parts examines how Railey fled, leaving behind his
brain-crippled wife, two children and a compelling, unsolved mystery.

   Doctors transferred Peggy Railey, her body alive
but her brain barely functioning, from a Dallas hospital to a
nursing home in east Texas so she could be near her parents.
   Bill and Billie Jo Nicolai live in Tyler, but they had spent
almost all day every day in Dallas, about 60 miles away, attending
to Peggy's needs. Though a full-service hospital was no longer
required, she remained in a vegetative state from which she might
never awaken.
   Back in Dallas, no sign was posted, but the Raileys' home was
quietly put on the market and sold.
   Walker Railey voluntarily surrendered his credentials as a
minister in the United Methodist Church, and then surrendered
control of his wife's legal affairs to her parents. He granted
temporary custody of his children to the friends who had kept them
since April 22, John and Diane Yarrington.
   Mrs. Nicolai requested a court grant her guardianship of her
daughter, and Railey waived his right to continue in that
traditionally spousal role.
   And then, after the stunning developments and disclosures of
mid-November, Railey vanished from sight.
   ``I know he has some job prospects,'' said Yarrington.
   Over the next few months, Railey and Dallas reporters played a
game of hide-and-seek.
   In early December, Railey told religion reporter Helen Parmley of
The Dallas Morning News in a telephone interview from California
that he fled despair, not speculation. And he maintained he was not
abandoning his children.
   ``In this case, while I am relocating, looking for work,
financially strapped, not knowing where I'm going to end up or what
I'm going to be doing, everybody involved in this drama believes ...
the most stable, loving, Christian environment they can be in is
where they are,'' he said.
   But before anybody could get themselves too lathered up over
Railey's plight, Dallas Times Herald columnist Laura Miller put a
new slant on the case by telling a tale of the anger and indignation
of Peggy Railey's family _ her father and her grandmother.
   Both believe Railey was behind the attack.
   The motive? ``A divorced man doesn't get to be bishop,'' said the
grandmother, Ella Renfro.

<TEXT>
   Larry Wright, a contributing editor at Texas Monthly magazine,
grew up in the First United Methodist Church in Dallas. His
childhood pastor was Robert Goodrich Jr., Lucy Papillon's father.
   He left the church once in disenchantment but had been drawn back
by Railey's socially contemporary ministry. Then he had seen the
devastation at First Methodist after the attack on Peggy, Walker's
suicide attempt and the minister's affair with Lucy.
   So Wright was less a journalist than a confused and angry member
of the congregation when he confronted Railey.
   Did Peggy know about his affair with Lucy?
   ``We _ that never came up,'' Railey stammered.
   She didn't know?
   ``I can only say it never emerged.''
   Did she suspect?
   ``I have no way of knowing, regarding that, that she suspected at
all, about anything.''
   Changing the subject, Railey revealed he had slipped into the
First Methodist sanctuary to attend funeral services for a family
friend. Some of his former parishioners avoided him but most
embraced him.
   ``They could feel my pain,'' Railey said, crying. He said he also
felt love.
   Did you feel a sense of shame? Wright asked.
   ``I felt a great need to be forgiven, if that's what you're
talking about.''
   Wright decided that was as much of a concession as he was likely
to get. But before departing, he said he could not construct an
innocent man out of Railey's behavior. The journalist recounted
Railey's misleading testimony to the police, his avoidance of the
grand jury and his inexplicable actions on the night of the attack.
   ``I think you are a guilty person,'' said Wright.
   ``I hear what you're saying,'' Railey replied.
   Wright did not know what to think. Railey failed to absorb his
blunt accusation, choosing instead to analyze it with detachment.
   ``I'm aware that nobody can sit down with all the facts that are
supposedly known ... and just make it all fit. That's a frustration
that everyone has felt, including me,'' Railey said.
   ``Confess,'' Wright urged him. ``It will haunt you forever, it
will drive you crazy.''
   ``I don't know if that's a word of advice, a backhand comfort or
what,'' said Railey. ``I'm not guilty. I didn't do it. I don't feel
tormented by the guilt of what I didn't do.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   On Feb. 2, Billie Jo Nicolai filed a legal bombshell in civil
court, accusing Railey of ``maliciously'' attempting to kill his
wife and orchestrating a ``clumsy attempt'' to cover his actions
with a phony alibi.
   The lawsuit sought damages for ``physical and mental pain,
disfigurement, anguish and physical impairment'' on behalf of Mrs.
Nicolai's comatose daughter.
   Concern over the cost of Peggy Railey's medical expenses was the
overriding reason for the action, but the family's decision was also
emotional, said Mrs. Nicolai's attorney, Bill Arnold.
   ``They are bitter,'' he said. ``They are angry.''
   Ted Nicolai, Peggy's younger brother, revealed that Railey had
visited his wife no more than three times and that after a Christmas
visit with his two children, Ryan had suffered severe emotional
problems.
   Norm Kinne, Dallas' chief prosecutor, had sent an investigator to
question Ryan about the night of April 21, and the youngster talked
freely about almost everything. But whenever she asked about the
attack, Ryan would tune her out. He would turn his back and try to
leave the room.

   Precisely one year after the events of April 1987, a state
district judge ruled that Walker Railey ``intentionally, knowingly,
maliciously and brutally attempted to strangle his wife'' and cover
up his actions with a ``false alibi.''
   Judge John Whittington issued a preliminary civil judgment on
April 22, 1988, holding Railey financially liable for the injuries
to his wife. The extent of damages would be determined later by a
jury.
   The ruling, while significant, had no bearing on the criminal
investigation.
   Whittington's action came after Railey failed to respond to legal
notices of the suit. The judge said Railey, by his technical
default, had admitted all the allegations.
   Railey could no longer be found. Under siege from the media, he
broke the lease on the San Francisco ``love nest'' he shared with
Papillon on her visits from Dallas. It appeared he had fled the Bay
area altogether.
   ``The court can issue a subpoena that compels him to come answer
my questions,'' said Arnold. ``But today, I have less of an idea
where he is than at any time since this case started.''

   In June, doctors reported a slight improvement in Peggy Railey's
condition and she was returned to Dallas and placed in the Baylor
Institute for Rehabilitation.
   Dr. William Parker, the institute's medical director, said she
could turn her head and hear, but could not process what she heard.
   ``If we can establish anything that seems to stimulate a response
that could be interpreted as functional, then we would continue to
try, through repetition, to improve on that,'' he said.
   Parker said he didn't think his team of specialists would be able
to determine whether Peggy Railey would ever communicate again.
   ``I think the odds are probably going to be against it, but time
is the only thing that's going to tell,'' he said.
   After more than a year in a vegetative state, doctors downgraded
her condition to a ``persistent vegetative state,'' meaning, as a
neurosurgeon explained, that her chances for recovery were ``nil.''
   After two months in Dallas, she was quietly returned to the
nursing home in Tyler where her parents resumed their tender, but
apparently hopeless, daily care.

   Norm Kinne sat puffing his pipe in the district attorney's office
and reflecting on the Railey case, his opinions no less candid than
when he first viewed the terrible pictures of Peggy Railey's wounds.
   ``This guy's a liar,'' said Kinne. ``He's trying to cover his
tracks. He wasn't where he was at the time he says he was. Now the
question is, if he wasn't there, where was he?
   ``The conclusion that everybody's drawn is that he was home
choking out his wife.
   ``But that doesn't necessarily follow. There's no proof he was at
the scene at the time she was strangled. There's no evidence that he
strangled her or that he knew who strangled her or that he arranged
or participated in any way.''
   That's not to say Kinne didn't think about prosecuting Walker
Railey. He visualized presenting all the evidence that showed Railey
lied, that he contrived an alibi and that he told no one of visiting
his girlfriend that night.
   But with a defense move for an instructed verdict of innocent,
the judge might ask, ``Where is the evidence that he choked his
wife?'' Kinne said.
   The trial would probably be over before it began.
   As 1988 drew to an end, Kinne had not surrendered hope the case
might some day be solved but any possibility was a long shot. Peggy
Railey might miraculously recover and identify her assailant, or
even young Ryan Railey might have seen something and be able to talk
about it.
   Lucy Papillon might eventually shed light on the case, but Kinne
once pointed out that she had said nothing incriminating ``since we
don't have adultery laws anymore.''
   For Kinne, Walker Railey remained the ultimate enigma.
   ``The last thing you'd expect from a guy like him would be to
give up his wife and kids and flit off to California. Just say to
hell with it and take off. It's just not what you'd expect from a
man of his stature.
   ``It gives every indication of guilt, whether he is guilty or
not.''

   On Dec. 5, Judge Whittington heard testimony in a one-day trial
to determine if Walker Railey should pay damages to the Nicolai
family. Railey didn't show up.
   The family was awarded $16 million _ half to cover her care, half
to punish Railey. It was a ruling more of symbolism than substance,
a hollow victory.
   Arnold said he didn't know where Railey was, or how much money he
had. He doubted his wife's family would ever collect the $16 million.
   On videotape, the court watched therapists treating Peggy Railey,
who has virtually no body control and a haunting, lifeless look in
her eyes.
   Still, her sister-in-law, Linda Nicolai, told of an experience at
the hospital one day that suggested the depth of Peggy Railey's
anguish.
   As they guided her wheelchair down the hall, they passed a man
exercising with a cord similar to what police believe was used to
choke Peggy.
   The witness said Peggy Railey began sweating, hyperventilating
and rubbing her arms together. Mrs. Nicolai added:
   ``She kept looking at me ... with this wild look on her face and
trying to tell me something.''

<HEAD>Economist Says Farm Self-Sufficiency a Myth in Today's World</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If any farmers believed at the beginning of the
year that they were standing alone against the elements and
marauding wolves, they might have had some change of opinion by now.
   Weather, along with time, is the great leveler in agriculture
When it's good, bellies are full and prosperity reigns. And when
it's bad, there is hunger, and moneylenders start knocking at the
door.
   The 1988 drought hurt thousands of farmers but helped thousands
of others by draining off surpluses and driving up commodity prices.
Grain bins full of corn and soybeans from previous crops were sudden
treasures.
   But there were farmers whose crops were destroyed and who were
left with nothing, not even last year's inventories to sell at the
higher prices, the Agriculture Department has said repeatedly. Some
have failed.
   Congress ordered vast federal aid to drought-stricken farmers,
and existing USDA programs were swollen by those seeking relief.
Effects of the drought, particularly its impact on the livestock
sector, may continue for years, to some degree.
   The drought, as with any weather pattern, was beyond the control
of farmers.
   Clark Edwards of the department's Economic Research Service says
farmers continue to move away from that ancient ideal of
self-sufficiency that once epitomized American agriculture or at
least was a dream of many.
   Edwards, writing in the December issue of Agricultural Outlook
magazine, said farmers today buy most of the items they need to
produce crops and livestock. They buy these ``inputs'' and sell what
they produce.
   ``This makes them dependent on the economic decisions of
others,'' he said. ``And the opening of the export markets over the
last two decades makes farms more dependent on public and private
decisions made around the world. Farms nowadays are far from
self-sufficient.''
   Take the transportation systems _ barge, rail and truck _ that
move inputs to the farm and products to the marketplace. Those rely
heavily on the federal government.
   ``This summer, when barge traffic came to a standstill on the
Mississippi, the Army Corps of Engineers helped keep products moving
by dredging the river,'' Edwards said. ``One result was that prices
at the farm were higher and prices at ports were lower than they
would have been if the river had stayed unnavigable.''
   Another example of forces beyond the control of farmers was the
Soviet Union's decision to increase the protein content of livestock
feed by importing more soybean meal. That expanded the market for
U.S. soybean producers.
   ``But decisions by South American soybean farmers to increase
plantings after the U.S. drought keep prices from rising as much as
they would have,'' Edwards said. ``Decisions by governments to
promote exports and control imports through trade regulations,
tariffs, quotas, subsidies, embargoes and other border policies have
made world trade a labyrinth.''
   He added: ``Easy money policies by the government keep the cost
of borrowing lower and, by keeping exchange rates lower, expand the
market for farm products. But they do so at the risk of faster
inflation.''
   Other credit policies by the government also directly or
indirectly affect farm income. Prices received by farmers are
affected by federal price support programs, marketing orders,
contracts and other arrangements between farmers and public or
private agencies.
   ``Farmers often taken for granted institutional arrangements
affecting their incomes, including the availability of resources
such as grazing rights or irrigation water, utilities such as
electricity, public schools for their children, public research on
new technology, private property rights, and even such amenities as
clean air and a million-dollar view,'' Edwards said.
   The success of a farmer may depend on the individual's choices
and actions, although circumstances can dictate failure, he said. On
the other hand, unforeseen circumstances may bring windfall gains.
   ``This is not to say the farmer is passive,'' Edwards said.
``Success depends on plans made and action taken, on the
availability of resources and management. The problem is one of
balance; how much outside influence does a farmer need or want?
Producers can't make it by being completely self-contained, nor by
putting all their trust in neighbors and the country.''

   The Christmas tree lay toppled on its
side, lights still strung through brown and brittle needles almost a
year later.
   Blood still stains the floor and walls, and a grave, its earthen
bed littered with leaves, gapes in the yard.
   The desolate house on Broomfield Road, its windows broken and
door swinging in the wind, still testifies to a murder rampage that
wiped out a family.
   On Dec. 28, 1987, authorities arrested R. Gene Simmons after a
45-minute shooting spree that killed two people and wounded four in
nearby Russellville. Officers then uncovered 14 bodies in and around
Simmons' house.
   ``One or two cars stop every week and the folks ask for
directions to the Simmons place,'' said William Brown, who runs a
grocery store. ``People want to see it. Lots of people come by.
Other than that, life is still just about the same as before.''
   But a family is gone. Found dead at the house were Simmons' wife,
Becky, 46, his three sons and four daughters, two of their spouses,
and four grandchildren, including a 6-year-old girl authorities said
he probably fathered through his daughter Sheila.
   Simmons, 48, still faces trial in the slayings of his family, but
was sentenced to death last May for the killings in Russellville. He
stunned the courtroom by renouncing any appeals and requesting a
speedy execution.
   ``Let the torture and suffering in me end,'' he pleaded. ``Please
allow me to be at peace.''
   Even now, the authorities say they have not determined Simmons'
motive.
   The unopened Christmas presents found under the tree indicated
the slayings probably started Dec. 24 or even earlier, Pope County
Sheriff Jim Bolin says.
   Five bodies _ some in overcoats _ were found in the house,
probably killed as they arrived for the holidays. Seven others, some
clad in nightclothes, were splashed with kerosene and covered with
dirt in a grave authorities believe was dug before the killings. The
bodies of two grandsons, both 1 year old, lay in dark green plastic
garbage bags in the trunks of abandoned cars.
   Six had been shot with a .22-caliber pistol, one of them seven
times, and eight were strangled with cord.
   Simmons has never indicated a motive, but before he was taken
into custody at a trucking company where he wounded his former
supervisor he told a hostage, ``I've gotten everybody who wanted to
hurt me.''
   One of the people killed in Russellville was a 24-year-old law
office receptionist who reportedly rejected Simmons' romantic
overtures.
   Investigators also point to a four-page letter written by his
wife and sent the summer before to their son, William H. Simmons II,
who was slain along with his wife, Renata, and their year-old son.
   ``I am a prisoner here and the kids too,'' she wrote.``I don't
want to live the rest of my life with Dad. ... I know it would be
great, having my children visit me anytime, having a telephone,
going shopping if I want, going to church. Everytime I think of
freedom I want out as soon as possible.''
   Simmons attempted to control family members by censoring their
mail, restricting visitors and discouraging his wife and daughters
from wearing makeup, authorities say. The telephone, heat and air
conditioning never worked and the family apparently used two nearby
outhouses because the toilet was broken.
   Simmons' 17-year-old daughter, Loretta, confided to friends she
was depressed about living there, and relatives said Mrs. Simmons
wanted to leave but feared financial problems and retaliation from
her husband.
   After receiving the death sentence, Simmons urged that no one try
to ``delay, deny, defer or denounce this very correct and proper
death sentence.''
   But the Rev. Louis Franz, a Roman Catholic priest from Star City
and a foe of the death penalty, intervened on his own.
   Judge John S. Patterson had set a June 27 execution date and the
Arkansas courts ruled Simmons was competent to waive his appeals,
but Franz's intervention has tied the case up in federal court.
   That disappoints prosecutor John Bynum, survivors of the
shootings _ and even Simmons' court-appointed attorneys.
   ``I believe in the death penalty without any apology in certain
cases,'' Bynum said. ``This is one of them. Mr. Simmons doesn't
deserve to live. ''
   Simmons' lawyers, John C. Harris and Robert E. Irwin, said their
client wanted the death penalty from the start and restricted the
defense they could present.
   ``Every lawyer's goal should be to get what a client wants, so
long as it's legal and ethical to do so,'' Harris said. ``Had it
been carried out June 27 at 11 a.m., we would have been on to doing
other things, which would have been better for our client, the
alleged victims in these crimes, this community, the taxpayers, and
everybody involved in this case.''
   David Salyer, whose forehead bears a thin horizontal seam where
he was hit by a bullet from one of Simmons' two 9-shot, .22-caliber
revolvers, is bitter about the delay.
   ``For the lawyers, it's all a game,'' said Salyer, who runs the
Sinclair Mini-Mart, where Simmons worked until 10 days before the
shootings and one of his stops during the rampage.
   Salyer says he ran up $15,000 in medical bills and lost business
because he had to close the store for two weeks.
   Since the slayings, the house and the almost 14 acres Simmons was
buying have gone into foreclosure and reverted to the former owners.
   The house is strewn with clothes, books, food and other articles,
furniture is turned topsy-turvy, and blood still stains the walls,
floor and a mattress. A handmade sign reading ``Knock Before
Entering'' and a dozen Smurfs decals decorate the door to the one of
the children's rooms.
   The Christmas tree lay in a corner of the living room until
someone took it about a week ago.
   The walls are scarred by the writings of vandals. At Halloween, a
group of area teen-agers held a seance there, sheriff's deputy Jim
Hollabaugh said.
   ``They didn't need a lot of encouragement to leave,'' he said.
``They were trying to scare each other and they were looking for a
reason to leave.''
   Irwin has handled the disposition of the family possessions, some
of which the lawyers have taken as part of their compensation. The
unopened Christmas presents were given to the few remaining
relatives.
   At the Pleasant Grove Assembly of God Church, the congregation
rejoices each Sunday to music played on the Simmons family piano. A
member of the church bought the piano and some dishware for $250,
said the church's pastor, the Rev. L.B. French.
   ``We got it tuned,'' he said. ``It plays real good. This suits
the purpose as well as a new one.''
   In Dover, the small town between Pleasant Grove and Russellville
where the Simmons children attended school, Mayor George Boyd said
the town hasn't been affected much by the slayings.
   ``The children talk about it some, but it hasn't basically
changed anything about Dover,'' Boyd said. ``This fellow just kept
to himself. Nobody really knew those folks.''

   Guns fell silent on several battlefronts in 1988,
and hope emerged that mankind stood at the dawn of a more peaceful
age. It seemed as though the world had decided it had enough of war.
   Blood was still being shed in some parts of the globe. But Iran
opted for a cease-fire in its 8-year-old war with Iraq, the Soviets
began to withdraw troops from Afghanistan, and Cuba, Angola and
South Africa chose to work towards peace in southwestern Africa.
   The year began with the ink barely dry on the first superpower
treaty to eliminate a class of nuclear weapons. Before the year was
out, many missiles were destroyed. U.N. truce troops won the Nobel
Peace Prize. President Reagan met not once, but twice, with Soviet
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who announced unilateral reductions in
military strength.
   ``Forces have already emerged in the world that in one way or
another stimulate the arrival of a period of peace,'' Gorbachev said
in a speech to the U.N. General Assembly.
   Among other developments, Olympic athletes from both East and
West met in the Summer Games for the first time in 12 years in
Seoul. Fears of North Korean sabotage of the Games proved unfounded,
and the two Koreas took steps toward reconciliation.
   The United Nations also mediated peace talks on the Western
Sahara between Morocco, which occupies most of the northwest African
territory, and the Polisario independence movement.
   Southeast Asia's non-communist nations, Japan, and the
U.N.-recognized Cambodian government-in-exile worked toward getting
Vietnamese occupying forces to withdraw from Cambodia.
   Greek and Turkish Cypriot leaders met to discuss the possibility
of reuniting the divided Mediterranean island. Rajiv Gandhi became
the first Indian prime minister in 34 years to visit China, long at
odds with India over a border dispute and other issues.
   The PLO said it recognized Israel's right to exist, and the
United States agreed to talks with Yasser Arafat's group for the
first time in hopes of peace in the Middle East. Meanwhile,
Palestinians died at the rate of almost one a day in their
anti-Israeli uprising in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   And conflicts raged on in many other parts of the globe:
   _Burma struggled through political turmoil.
   _Central America simmered with continued fighting in El Salvador
and an uneasy truce in Nicaragua.
   _Moslem guerrillas continued their fight in Afghanistan against
the Soviet-allied government.
   _The Sikhs still struggled for an independent homeland in India,
as did the Tamils in Sri Lanka, and other rebel groups in the Sudan
and Ethiopia.
   _Five thousand died in ethnic violence in Burundi.
   _Dozens died and thousands were forced to leave their homes
because of domestic unrest in Armenia and Azerbaijan in the southern
Soviet Union.
   _And in Lebanon, the streets of Beirut remained a battleground.
The nation came closer than ever to formal partitioning into
Christian and Moslem sectors, and Israeli raiders struck repeatedly
against the south in retaliation for anti-Israel guerrilla activity.
   Still, the year wound to a close with a sense of hope.
   ``There is a new mood of understanding and common sense,'' U.N.
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar said in accepting the
peace prize Dec. 10.
   ``We can, and must, achieve what we have dreamed of for so long,
that is to make the rule of law the standard rather than the
exception in world affairs.''

<TEXT>
   For Israel, 1988 began with the surprise of a
spreading Palestinian revolt against occupation and ended with the
shock of seeing its best friend, the United States, start a dialogue
with the PLO, its most hated enemy.
   The Parliament elections Nov. 1 gave Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir's right-wing Likud bloc a slight edge, but neither Shamir nor
Foreign Minister Shimon Peres' Labor Party won a clear mandate for
dealing with the Palestinian problem.
   By Dec. 21, the two rival groups were driven back into each
other's arms, agreeing to form a national unity government under
Shamir, a broad-based coalition similar to the one that had governed
Israel since 1984.
   But critics contended the Likud-Labor union would deadlock over
the peace process.
   Peres had supported Arab calls for an international peace
conference at which Israel would be prepared to give up occupied
land in exchange for a peace agreement.
   Shamir opposed both ideas and instead supported a new campaign of
Jewish settlement building in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip,
where 70,000 Jews live with 1.7 million Arabs.
   Israel's relations with Jews in Europe and the United States were
also weakened by a sudden upsurge of fundamentalist religious
parties. They won 18 seats in the 120-seat Knesset, or parliament,
and held a balance of power between Labor and Likud.
   Delegation after delegation of Jews arrived to tell Shamir that
Israel could suffer the loss of aid and political support if he gave
in to extremist demands for so-called ``Who is a Jew?'' legislation.
   The legislation, which would give Orthodox rabbis exclusive
control over conversions to Judaism, was seen as a slap in the face
to the non-Orthodox who constitute the vast majority of Jews abroad.
   The threatened loss of support couldn't have come at a worse time.
   The United States, which gives Israel $3 billion a year in
economic and military aid, ended a 13-year boycott and opened a
dialogue with the Palestine Liberation Organization on Dec. 16,
after Chairman Yasser Arafat said the PLO had renounced terrorism
and recognized Israel's right to exist.
   ``The American decision to seek a dialogue with the PLO is seen
here as some sort of betrayal,'' said Eytan Gilboa, an international
relations expert at Hebrew University in Jerusalem.
   In the occupied territories, it was a year of bloodshed. More
than 330 Palestinians and 13 Israelis were killed in the continuing
uprising, which shook Israel out of complacency with the status quo
in the occupied lands.
   It prepared the ground for mainstream politicians in the Labor
Party to join leftists in proposing talks with the PLO. Among the
supporters were Ezer Weizman, former defense minister and ex-head of
Israel's air force, and Mordechai Gur, a former armed forces chief
of staff.
   ``The Israeli consensus on whether to negotiate with the PLO has
been broken by the U.S. decision. Some in Israel are demanding a
rethinking of policy regarding negotiations with the PLO,'' said
Shlomo Avineri, ex-director general of Israel's foreign ministry.
   The uprising also changed the lives of Palestinians, upsetting a
traditional system in which major decisions were taken by village
elders and the heads of clans or extended families.
   Sons defied fathers and underground committees of young
Palestinian activists bypassed Arab mayors, village chiefs and even
PLO-backed associations to set the agenda for the uprising.

   Inflation slowed to an annual rate of 3 percent
last month and economic growth did the same in the third quarter,
the government says.
   The Labor Department report released Tuesday eased fears among
many economists and market watchers that an overheating economy was
about to trigger a wage-price spiral.
   Seasonally-adjusted consumer prices rose just 0.25 percent in
November compared with a 0.4 percent increase in October, the Labor
Department said. Before the seasonal adjustments, prices rose only
0.1 percent.

   The economy expanded at a moderate 2.5 percent
pace during the July-September quarter, the government reported, but
analysts said growth was rebounding and the Federal Reserve probably
would nudge interest rates higher as a result.
   The Commerce Department said Tuesday that growth of the gross
national product, the broadest measure of economic health, slowed
during the third quarter from 3.0 percent in the second quarter.
   The GNP, after adjusting for inflation, rose $24.2 billion to an
annual rate of $4.01 trillion in the third quarter.

   The Labor Department's encouraging report on
inflation added a spark of life to some financial markets and eased
concerns about higher interest rates, but most analysts remained
wary about the economy's direction.
   The dollar rallied Tuesday against most major currencies in
foreign-exchange trading in the United States and abroad, while bond
prices headed sharply higher.
   But on Wall Street, stocks declined. The Dow Jones average of 30
industrials closed 6.61 points lower at 2,166.07.

``There are a lot of people around saying I can't do that.''

Zenith's chairman says.
   The comments Tuesday by Jerry Pearlman in a wide-ranging
telephone interview were the first public disclosure of a key

   Corporations reported a 3.9 percent rise in
after-tax profits for the third quarter, down from an 8.9 percent
surge in the previous quarter but substantially above the
preliminary estimate last month, the government says.
   The Commerce Department said Tuesday that profits rose $6.4
billion to a seasonally-adjusted annual level of $169.1 billion for
the third quarter.
   That compares with the slight 0.2 percent rise reported a month
ago, but the department noted almost all of the improvement came
from profits earned by foreign subsidiaries of U.S. companies.

   Pillsbury Co. said its profit fell 38 percent
in its second quarter and 10 percent for the first half of its
fiscal year due partly to the costs of its unsuccessful battle
against hostile suitor Grand Metropolitan PLC.

   The 1988 drought cut deeply into U.S. and
global grain stockpiles, but the Agriculture Department says normal
weather could improve things significantly by this time next year.
   Drought in the United States and Canada lowered world crop
production by more than 6 percent, the department's Economic
Research Service said Tuesday.
   Meanwhile, world supplies of animal products will remain large
enough to dampen increases in livestock prices, the department said.

   A squeeze on a futures trader who was caught
short sent an expiring contract for West Texas Intermediate crude
oil sharply higher, although other energy futures rose only modestly
at the same time.
   The January contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark
grade of U.S. crude, shot up $1.42 on Tuesday to settle at $17.73 a
barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It had fallen 41 cents
the previous session.
   One major trader who was caught short had to buy January
contracts on the final day to close out a position, said Peter
Beutel, assistant director of the energy group at Elders Futures Inc.
   Traders who are short have sold borrowed contracts as a bet that
the price will fall, and they will be able to repay their debt with
contracts bought at the cheaper price.
   But in a classic short squeeze Tuesday, the trader was forced to
pay exorbitant prices to get anyone to sell, said another trader,
Jack Unger of Merrill Lynch Energy Futures.
   There were conflicting reports about the identity of the trader
or traders who were caught short. Any trader who is still short when
the contract expires must make delivery of actual oil to the holder
of the contract, something most oil traders are scarcely prepared to
do.
   Reflecting the unusual circumstances of the short squeeze,
contracts for delivery in later months rose by far smaller amounts.
The February contract rose 33 cents to $16.15 a barrel and the March
contract rose 32 cents to $15.75 a barrel.
   Crude oil got some support from a report that the Saudis were
cutting back their allocation of oil to Japan, forcing the Japanese
to buy oil elsewhere, Beutel said.
   There also are some long-term reasons for an increase in oil
prices, said James L. Carroll, an analyst at PaineWebber Inc.
   ``The OPEC agreement that was struck shortly before Thanksgiving
was met initially with a great amount of skepticism in the crude
trading community. But it's been accepted so far by all the cartel
members to a degree that was not expected,'' Carroll said.
   Among refined petroleum products traded on the exchange Tuesday,
January wholesale home heating oil rose 0.72 cent to 51.47 cents a
gallon.
   The January contract for unleaded gasoline settled at 45.55 cents
a gallon Tuesday, up 0.13 cent from the close Monday.

<HEAD>Zenith To Ask Government For New Help On TV Competition</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Zenith Electronics Corp.'s chairman says the
company soon will ask the government to invoke a never-used law to
monitor imports of televisions from countries suspected of
``dumping'' the sets in the United States at unfairly low prices.
   Jerry Pearlman, Zenith's chairman and president, unveiled the
plan Tuesday in a telephone interview. He called it a major part of
the company's plan for getting back to steady profitability.
   A New York-based investment partnership earlier this month
dropped its efforts to throw Pearlman off the board of directors and
get the Glenview, Ill.-based company to sell its money-losing
television business.
   Zenith's request to the government will be aimed at cutting off
illegal ``dumping'' of inexpensive TVs from Malaysia, Hong Kong,
China, Mexico, Singapore, Thailand, and the Philippines, not just
the traditional sources of Japan, Taiwan and South Korea, Pearlman
said.
   Zenith, the last major U.S.-based television manufacturer, has
not had an annual profit since 1984, largely because of fierce
competition from cheap imports.
   Zenith will seek protection under 1984 legislation that allows
the Commerce Department to monitor imports of products from new
countries where dumping is suspected. It can only do so if there is
an anti-dumping order in place against more than one country already.
   Dumping is the sale of products in foreign markets at unfairly
low prices to get rid of excess production or to force competitors
out of business.
   The legislation permits the Commerce Department to initiate its
own anti-dumping action against the new countries if the agency
finds evidence of dumping.
   ``I hope to file it (the petition) soon,'' Pearlman said.
   In Washington, Commerce Department spokeswoman Claire Buchan said
the department had received only one request for protection under
the 1984 legislation, and action on it had been deferred until next
year. That concerned imports of brass sheets and strips.
   She said she could not comment on Zenith's petition before it had
been received and studied.
   Brookhurst Partners, the New York-based challenger to Pearlman,
had sought shareholder support for its proposal to force Zenith to
sell its money-losing consumer electronics business or, if that
proved impossible, to find a buyer for the whole company.
   It dropped the shareholder solicitation on Dec. 2, shortly before
votes were to be counted, saying it was satisfied Zenith was headed
in the right direction.
   Although the pressure from Brookhurst is off, Pearlman said,
``we're not going to relax'' in efforts to improve Zenith's
profitability. The company has a profitable line of personal
computers, but its overall results have been depressed by losses in
televisions.
   Pearlman said he expected the company to meet the goal, stated in
October, of a pretax profit for 1988. But he indicated it would be
close and said taxes could push net results into the red.
   Pearlman said he is optimistic about Zenith's chances in the
field of high-definition television, the next generation of TVs that
will have sharper, brighter pictures. Zenith has proposed a standard
for HDTV transmission that, if selected by the government, would
produce royalties for Zenith.
   Also, Zenith has developed a sharp, rugged kind of picture tube
called flat tension mask that Pearlman said would be ideally suited
for commercial or military use. But he said the cash-strapped
company needs government money to make the screens bigger and build
a plant to make them.
   In a sign that money for Zenith may be forthcoming, the Pentagon
on Monday said it would solicit proposals in the next two or three
weeks ``in the areas of high-definition, low-cost display technology
....''
   On other issues, Pearlman said:
   _The company is benefiting from strong demand and tight supplies
of televisions and picture tubes. Zenith is turning down some orders
for picture tubes from other TV makers even while running its
picture tube plant around the clock, seven days a week.
   _TV prices remain depressed, but Zenith recently announced
increases of 1 percent to 2 percent to its wholesalers effective
Jan. 1. If Zenith and other companies can make the new prices stick,
there will be further increases in 1989.
   Pearlman said the new problem in dumping is that traditional
competitors blocked from dumping TVs shipped from their home
countries are opening plants in other countries and dumping TVs made
there.
   In 1984, he said, about 80 percent of imported TVs came from
Japan, South Korea or Taiwan. In 1988, that was down to 47 percent,
he said.
   ``What you've got here is the classic water balloon. The
government has stepped down in one part and it's popped up in
another part because the foot hasn't been as big as the balloon,''
he said.
   There are anti-dumping provisions for TV sets in place against
Japan, South Korea and Taiwan and anti-dumping provisions for
picture tubes against those three countries plus Singapore and
Canada.

<HEAD>Foreign Companies Dumping Phone Systems, AT&T Says</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Companies in Japan, Taiwan and South Korea are
taking over the U.S. market for small business phone equipment by
charging unfairly low prices for phone gear shipped here, American
Telephone & Telegraph Co. says.
   Unfair competition has allowed the foreign companies to increase
their share of the $4 billion-a-year U.S. market to 60 percent from
40 percent over three years, AT&T said Tuesday as it announced its
first-ever ``dumping'' accusation.
   ``Our investigation showed a very clear picture of not just
small-scale dumping, but massive dumping,'' J.A. Blanchard, an AT&T
executive, said in a telephone interview.
   The companies' prices in their home markets averaged more than 75
percent higher and in one case were 170 percent higher than in the
United States, AT&T said.
   The equipment at issue is for small businesses with two to 80
phone lines and consists of phones and switches. The two major types
are known as key systems and private branch exchanges, or PBXs.
   It is illegal under U.S. law for foreign companies to sell
products in the U.S. market for less than they sell them at home,
regardless of the motivation.
   ``One obvious possible explanation (for the dumping) is if you
can sell it for twice as much in the home market, then you can grow
your market share abroad,'' Blanchard said.
   AT&T accused more than a dozen manufacturers that sell products
under more than 17 brand names. Among those accused were giants such
as Japan's Toshiba Corp. and Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. Ltd.
Spokesmen in the United States for both of those companies declined
to comment, saying they did not have enough information about the
allegations.
   Blanchard said that while the foreign companies were increasing
their market share over the past three years, the share of U.S.
manufacturers fll to 35 percent from 55 percent.
   ``We decided we were simply not going to let that continue,''
Blanchard said.
   The petition will be filed Dec. 28 with the Commerce Department,
AT&T said.
   The Commerce Department has 20 days from the filing date to
decide whether AT&T's dumping claims merit investigation. If it
does, the International Trade Commission will begin a separate
investigation to determine whether the alleged dumping has harmed
the U.S. industry. It should make its preliminary determination
within 45 days.
   Final determinations and the possible imposition of dumping
duties would occur in about a year.
   In addition to Matsushita and Toshiba, the other Japanese
companies named by AT&T were Hasegawa, Iwatsu, Meisei, Nakayo,
Nitsuko and Tamura.
   Also named were South Korea's Goldstar, OPC and Samsung, and
Taiwan's Sun Moon Star.

<HEAD>Honeywell To Lose About $400 Million In 1988; Picks New Chairman</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TONY KENNEDY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Although it posted a $67.1 million profit for
the first nine months of 1988, Honeywell Inc. says it faces a
surprise loss of more than $400 million for the full year, largely
due to charges for tax expenses and streamlining costs.
   Honeywell on Tuesday also said it would cut 1,200 of its
79,000-employee worldwide workforce, as part of a plan to trim costs
and increase the defense contractor and building controls maker's
competitiveness.
   Unusual tax expenses are responsible for about $300 million of
the projected annual loss, Honeywell said Tuesday.
   ``There had been no indication earlier there would be a loss for
the year,'' said Susan Eich, a Honeywell spokeswoman.
   Honeywell posted a profit of $254 million on sales of $6.7
billion last year.
   Honeywell announced the expected 1988 loss after the stock market
closed Tuesday. In composite New York Stock Exchange trading,
Honeywell stock was down 62{ cents Tuesday to $59.62{.
   Honeywell also said Tuesday that James J. Renier, president and
chief executive officer, will replace retiring Chairman Edson W.
Spencer. Renier, 58, who joined Honeywell in 1956 as a senior
research scientist, was appointed president and chief executive in
October 1987.
   Spencer, 62, will remain on the company's board of directors.
   Mike Hamilton, an analyst for Piper Jaffray & Hopwood in
Minneapolis said he had been projecting a break-even fourth quarter
for Honeywell after the company posted its nine-month profit of
$1.58 a share. But after Tuesday's announcement he has revised his
projection to a fourth quarter loss of $480 million.
   ``It's obviously a fairly messy situation at this stage to put it
mildly,'' Hamilton said. ``It's clear from Renier's comments that
they have just taken the posture of blowing all ballast here in
1988. They're taking charges wherever they can do so.''
   Tax expenses will account for about $300 million in losses for
the fourth quarter, the company said. Other charges are related to a
restructuring of its Solid State Electronics Division, a loss of
some defense contracts and early retirement and severance costs
related to the 1,200-person workforce reduction.
   In a news release, Renier said the company had a core of
profitable businesses where earnings had been exceeded by a series
of unusual charges. However, ``Achieving our long-term financial
goals would have been unacceptably delayed without these aggressive
actions to improve operations,'' he said.
   The principal tax expense results from Honeywell's inability to
assume tax benefits this year for operational writeoffs where actual
expenses will occur in the future, the company said. For example,
Honeywell won't be able to realize a tax benefit for a
fourth-quarter restructuring of its integrated computer circuits
business.
   The restructuring, which included the November sale of its
Colorado Springs, Colo., merchant semiconductor operation, reflects
Honeywell's retreat from computer manufacturing. That strategy
includes an anticipated reduction of Honeywell's interest in
Honeywell Bull Inc., the information systems company it formed with
Japan's NEC Corp. and France's Bull group, Renier said.
   Eich said the job cuts were part of a program to reduce costs and
enhance competitiveness. About 60 percent of the reduction will be
made through early retirements and severance agreements that will
add to fourth quarter costs, she said.
   ``It's very decentralized and its being implemented now,'' Eich
said of the cuts, which will include involuntary layoffs.
   Other factors in the huge fourth-quarter loss will be the loss of
military contracts in certain space and aviation businesses that
Honeywell will sell, Eich said.
   Other factors in the huge fourth-quarter loss will be the loss of

   Honeywell said its projection of a $400 million annual loss for
the year was unaudited and could change.

<HEAD>Universal Foods Board Rejects Sweetened Takeover Offer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MILWAUKEE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A sweetened $577.5 million takeover bid by High
Voltage Engineering Corp. failed to win support of the Universal
Foods Inc. directors, who have rejected the offer and urged
shareholders to do the same.
   A news release issued by the Milwaukee-based Universal Foods said
the board concluded Tuesday that ``it is not in the best long-term
interests of the shareholders or the company's other constituencies
to sell or dismember this growing enterprise.''
   The $35 a share offer by High Voltage expires at midnight Dec. 30.
   Universal's stock declined 37{ cents to $35.62{ a share Tuesday
on the New York Stock Exchange.
   High Voltage, based in Burlington, Mass., is jointly owned by New
York-based investors Clifford Press and Laurence Levy and S&W
Berisford PLC, a British food conglomerate.
   The group sweetened the offer last week from its initial $30.50 a
share bid that Universal rejected earlier this month. The sweetened
bid values Universal's 16.5 million outstanding common shares at
$577.5 million.
   John L. Murray, Universal chairman, said the latest offer
involved too many financial risks.
   ``The highly leveraged transaction proposed by High Voltage
Engineering risks crippling the company's expansion and causing
drastic cuts in our research expenditures and capital investment
program,'' he said.
   Murray said that High Voltage, which ``is already highly
leveraged,'' was proposing to finance the offer through a newly
created subsidiary with less than $10 million of its own funds.
   Levy said Murray was incorrect, and that his group was committing
a total of $195 million to the buyout of Universal Foods. Levy also
argued that Universal's stock ``would at best be trading in the
mid-$20 range'' if High Voltage had not made the tender offer.
   ``We believe we have created for shareholders of Universal value
of approximately $170 million,'' Levy said.
   Guy A. Osborne, president and chief executive officer of
Universal, said he expected upcoming results for the first quarter
of 1989 to confirm his company's accelerating growth rate.
   Universal is a maker of food colors and flavors, yeast products,
frozen potatoes and Italian-style cheeses.
   The company announced Monday it was acquiring Imperial Flavors
Inc. of Winter Haven, Fla., a Borden Inc. subsidiary which
manufactures and sells flavorings and other ingredients to the
dairy, ice cream, cultured products and bakery industries.

<HEAD>Ag Department Says Drought Cut World Crop Output By Six Percent</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Farmers will not be able to shrug off quickly
the fierce effects of the 1988 drought that cut deeply into U.S. and
global stockpiles, although the Agriculture Department says the
situation may be improved a year from now.
   But that depends on the weather returning to normal and providing
enough precipitation in the next few months to replenish the deep
soil moisture losses of 1988.
   Drought in the United States and Canada lowered world crop
production by more than 6 percent, the department's Economic
Research Service said Tuesday.
   ``Crop prices will continue to reflect these smaller supplies
early in 1989,'' the agency said in a new outlook report. ``But
expanded output is likely in the second half, stopping the drawdown
in stocks.''
   Meanwhile, world supplies of animal products will remain large
enough to dampen increases in livestock prices. However, the demand
for both crop and animal products is expected to be bolstered by
continued world economic expansion and population growth.
   The agency stuck to an earlier estimate that the net cash income
of U.S. farmers in 1989 is likely to be in the range of $48 billion
to $52 billion, down from this year's record-tying estimate of $57
billion.
   ``Firm prices for most commodities and larger production will
mean total farm receipts slightly above the 1988 record,'' the
report said. ``Cash expenses are expected to rise moderately with
expanded acreage and costlier inputs (production items). Direct
government payments to farmers are likely to fall one-fifth.''
   As used by the agency, net cash income is the amount of money
farmers have to spend during a calendar year and is the difference
between gross cash income and cash expenses. For example, 1988 sales
of grain stored from harvests in earlier years are counted as part
of the current gross.
   In another method of bookkeeping, the agency measures ``net farm
income'' for the year, not simply the cash-in, cash-out system
involved in ``net cash income.''
   This method includes changes in the value of farm inventories,
and allowances are made for ``non-money'' items such as
depreciation, the family consumption of farm-grown food and the net
rental value of dwellings.
   Net farm income for 1989 is forecast at $44 billion to $48
billion, compared with the estimate of $39 billion this year.

   The Agriculture Department says the Soviet
Union has bought an additional 750,000 metric tons of U.S. corn for
delivery under a recently extended supply agreement between the two
countries, but it has backed out of a soybean deal.
   The corn purchase announced Tuesday was the second this week,
matching an order for 750,000 tons disclosed Monday.
   But the news was tempered by USDA's announcement of the
cancellation of the sale of 200,000 tons of soybean meal that had
been scheduled for delivery to the Soviet Union in 1988-89. No
explanation was given, but officials said conflicts in shipping
schedules or price disagreements have been behind such cancellations
in the past.
   The latest sales brought total corn sold to the Soviets to more
than 7.03 million tons in the agreement's sixth year, which began
Oct. 1. Last year, U.S. corn sales to the Soviet Union totaled
slightly less than 5.2 million tons.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 39.4 bushels
of corn or 36.7 bushels of wheat or soybeans. The 750,000 tons of
corn would be about 29.5 million bushels.
   Corn prices have been averaging about $2.58 per bushel at the
farm level, according to USDA estimates, meaning that the latest
sale could have a farm value of around $76 million.
   Although no wheat has yet been sold for 1988-89 delivery under
the pact, the Soviets have ordered 500,000 tons of soybeans and
635,000 tons of soybean meal, plus 500,000 tons of grain sorghum.
   The United States and the Soviet Union on Nov. 28 signed an
extension of the previous five-year grain agreement, which had
expired Sept. 30. The extension of the previous pact will run
through Dec. 31, 1990.
   Under terms of the agreement, the Soviet Union is committed to
buy at least 9 million tons of U.S. grain annually, including a
minimum of 4 million tons each of wheat and corn.
   The Soviets have the option of buying the remaining 1 million
tons as wheat, corn or soybeans, with every ton of beans counting as
two tons of grain _ up to a maximum of 1 million tons of grain
equivalent.

   Farmers have contracted with the Agriculture
Department to take an additional 2.6 million acres of highly
erodible cropland out of production under the 10-year Conservation
Reserve Program.
   Vern Neppl, an official of the department's Commodity Credit
Corp., said Tuesday the last contracts were accepted from more than
3.4 million acres offered during the program's seventh sign-up
period held July 18 through Aug. 31. The total now under CRP, as the
program is called, is more than 28.2 million acres.
   Neppl said the eighth sign-up for the program has been scheduled
for Feb. 6-24.
   Under the program, farmers agree to take land from production for
10 years. In return, based on bids they submit, farmers who are
accepted get annual rental payments from the government and one-time
assistance to pay for half the cost of planting trees, shrubs and
grass to guard against erosion.
   Neppl said the bids accepted for annual payments in the latest
round averaged $49.71 per acre. The average for the first six
sign-ups was $48.38 per acre, he said.
   The goal of the CRP as set by Congress in the 1985 farm law is to
take 40 million to 45 million acres of highly erodible cropland from
production by 1990.

<HEAD>Hit By Huge Libel Bills, Newspapers Face New Privacy Law</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Britain's racy tabloids, hit by huge libel awards
to pop star Elton John, novelist Jeffrey Archer and Prince Andrew's
ex-girlfriend Koo Stark, face a new hazard: a proposed law to curb
intrusions into private lives.
   But even those who believe the Protection of Privacy Bill is
unworkable or undermines press freedom acknowledge that some
newspapers have gone a headline too far with some of their stories.
   The bill, sponsored as a non-government measure by a legislator
John Browne of the governing Conservative Party, is likely to be
debated in January.
   It would copy some Western European countries in giving all
citizens a legal right to privacy, and complement libel laws by
allowing actions for damages for breaches. A newspaper will have to
show its disclosures were ``for the public benefit.''
   ``An Englishman's home is his castle,'' said Browne, 50. ``I'm
seeking to put some water in the moat.''
   Similar bills put forward without government support have failed
to get to the vote. But in today's seemingly more hostile climate
toward the press, experts say Browne's bill stands a reasonable
chance of becoming law.
   Another measure that may come before Parliament would oblige
newspapers to publish a wronged person's rebuttal.
   ``Politicians, by and large, are always very happy to legislate
against the press because they like to control it,'' said Tony
Loynes, editor of UK Press Gazette, a trade weekly. ``But we've
played into their hands, there's no question of that.''
   Loynes said Browne's bill may place yet another impediment before
journalists on top of the official secrecy shrouding many matters of
state.
   ``Journalists already suffer enough inhibitions to proper
journalistic inquiry,'' Loynes added in an interview. ``It is going
to be extremely costly in the future.''
   It already is.
   The 4.2 million circulation Sun, Britain's top-selling daily,
this month paid a $1.82 million to pop star Elton John who sued it
for publishing allegations about his private life. They settled out
of court, with The Sun admitting the allegations were wholly false.
   Last month, a jury ordered another newspaper, The People, to pay
American actress Koo Stark about $546,000 for falsely implying she
had resumed her relationship with Prince Andrew in 1985, a year
after she married.
   She also collected apologies and undisclosed damages from the
News of the World, Daily Mirror and Sunday Mirror _ all tabloids
that repeated the story.
   The previous biggest libel award was about $800,000 against the
tabloid Star over a story last year that novelist Jeffrey Archer
gave money to a prostitute. He said he had never met her.
   ``We've gone too far, and I include myself in that,'' Lloyd
Turner, Star editor at the time, said recently.
   Turner edited a new daily tabloid, The Post, which publisher Eddy
Shah billed as the one with ``breeze without sleaze.'' It went bust
this month after just 33 issues and sales that seldom topped 100,000.
   The six daily tabloids circulating nationally sell a total of
12.3 million copies.
   Critics see a disproportion between libel awards and accident
awards. The big libel sums usually go to the rich who can afford the
legal costs, while a recent award to a schoolboy run over by a bus
and confined to a wheelchair came to only about $105,600.
   Browne acknowledged difficulties in defining privacy. But recent
cases frequently cited by pro-privacy advocates include English
cricket captain Mike Gatting, dismissed after tabloid revelations
that he met a barmaid in his hotel room; and Prince Andrew's
father-in-law, Maj. Ronald Ferguson, who had to quit as secretary of
Prince Charles' polo club over stories that he frequented a massage
parlor.
   The watchdog Press Council, which hears complaints, orders
newspapers to publish adverse judgments, and they usually comply.
But it has no powers of punishment.
   Browne himself has made headlines by successfully suing his
wealthy ex-wife for a huge alimony settlement, but he insists that
isn't the motivation for his bill.
   He says his primary concern is to protect such people as families
of hostages from the glare of the media. ``Given rough guidelines,''
he says, ``courts ... will decide on a case by case basis.''

<HEAD>UAW Official Says Kenosha Could Get New Engine Work</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KENOSHA, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Kenosha is under consideration from Chrysler
Corp. as a possible site for producing the new V-10 engine the
company plans to develop over the next several years, a union
official said.
   Ed Steagall, president of United Auto Workers Local 72 at
Kenosha, said Tuesday that he was told by Ronald W. Lightcap,
manager of Chrysler's engine plant, ``Kenosha was putting in a bid
to bring new engine work to Kenosha, the V-10.''
   But Steagall said Lightcap told him there was no guarantee that
Kenosha would get the work.
   Chrysler this week is ending auto production at Kenosha,
eliminating more than 5,000 jobs, but will continue operating an
engine plant with about 1,200 workers.
   Metalworking News, a weekly trade publication, also reported this
week that Kenosha was being considered as an alternative site for
making the V-10 engines.
   The report said the likely target date for production of the
engines was 1993, and they were expected to be used initially in
light-duty trucks, vans and motor homes.
   ``We don't comment on future products or what engine work goes
into what plant,'' Chrysler spokesman Lloyd Northard said when asked
about the report.

   Iraq has pledged to srictly abide by OPEC's
recent production agreement and is asking other members to do the
same, OPEC President Rilwanu Lukman says.
   The government-owned Lagos Times reported Wednesday that Lukman
had received a letter from Iraqi Oil Minister Issam Al Chalabi
promising strict adherence to the production agreement reached last
month by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
   The cartel agreed to cut daily production to 18.5 million barrels
to help drive up sagging worldwide oil prices.
   In the letter to Lukman, the Iraqi minister said compliance was
necessary ``so that the objectives of our organization are fulfilled
and the interest of all member countries served.''
   The minister also said that Kuwait and Saudi Arabia would stop
sending war relief crude oil to Iraq from Jan. 1.

<TEXT>
   The Chinese government has uncovered about $1.2
billion in illegal profits through a nationwide crackdown against
rampant profiteering, tax evasion and unauthorized price hikes among
China's business community, a report published Wednesday said.
   The official Economic Daily (Jingji Ribao) said the state
campaign, which began in October, made ``great achievements.'' But
it said results were uneven because some local leaders lacked
authority to expose illegal activities and some companies either
refused to audit their books or underestimated their illegal profits.
   Eighty percent of companies and government offices have checked
their own books for irregularities, while another 470,000 officials
have been dispatched to screen company finances, the newspaper said.
   The State Council, China's cabinet, ordered the investigation
into such practices as profiteering from sales of scarce basic
materials, unauthorized price rises, unlicensed reselling of imports
and tax evasion.
   The campaign followed the government's decision last September to
reinstate central controls over pricing and other aspects of the
economy and slow down the pace of market-oriented reforms. The
measures were taken to combat a badly overheated economy and an
inflation rate of about 26 percent.

   Toyota Motor Corp., Japan's largest automaker, said
Wednesday its sales arm in the United States will begin exporting
U.S.-made Toyota passenger cars to Taiwan in January.
   A Toyota official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A. will export 300 four-door Camry sedans a
month to Taiwan from Toyota Motor Manufacturing U.S.A., Toyota's
U.S. subsidiary, in Georgetown, Kentucky.
   Toyota Motort Sales also will export 100 four-door Corolla sedans
a month to Taiwan from New United Motor Manufacturing Inc., a joint
venture with General Motors Corp. of the United States, in Fremont,
California, beginning in March, the official said.
   Taiwan has banned imports of passenger cars from Japan since 1974
to reduce its trade deficit with Japan, which totaled $4.8 billion
last year.
   The official said Toyota Motor Manufacturing now produces 5,500
cars and New United Motor Manufacturing 10,000 cars a month.

   The stock market declined slightly today in a
carryover of selling from late in Tuesday's session.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 1.25 to 2,164.82
in the first half hour of trading.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 6 to 5 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 410 up, 486 down and
579 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 20.38 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Analysts said traders began to sell Tuesday when the Dow Jones
industrials made a run past their 1988 closing high of 2,183.50,
reached on Oct. 21, but failed to hold that gain.
   That was widely regarded as a disappointing performance,
especially since the dollar and bonds both turned in strong showings.
   Since late November, the market has enjoyed a yearend rally led
by blue chips and stocks involved or rumored to be involved in
takeover plays.
   But many smaller ``secondary'' stocks have lagged behind,
apparently depressed by a lack of enthusiasm among individual
investors and selling for yearend tax purposes.
   Honeywell fell 2{ to 57{. Late Tuesday the company said a series
of writedowns might leave it with a loss of more than $400 million
for the year.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
slipped .02 to 155.72. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was up .06 at 299.73.
   On Tuesday, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 6.61 to
2,166.07.
   Declining issues outnumbered gainers by about 4 to 3 in
nationwide trading of NYSE-listed stocks, with 652 up, 845 down and
515 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 161.09 million
shares, down from 162.25 million Monday. Nationwide, consolidated
volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those stocks on
regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market, totaled
196.92 million shares.

<HEAD>Personal Income Up; Inflation Report Boosts Financial Markets</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: CORRECTS personal consumption figure in 4th to $3.32 trillion.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By VIVIAN MARINO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nationwide personal income dipped 0.2 percent in
November, down from unusually high October levels caused by bonuses
to auto workers and a surge in farm subsidy payments, the government
reported today.
   The Commerce Department said income declined $8.2 billion to a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of $4.18 trillion last month. That
followed a gain of 1.7 percent in October, which had been the
largest in a year.
   November's decline was the first since January, when incomes
dropped 0.4 percent.
   Meanwhile, the department said that personal consumption
spending, which includes everything except interest payments on
debt, rose 0.6 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $3.32
trillion last month after a robust 1.0 percent gain a month earlier.
   With spending rising faster than income in November, the personal
savings rate _ savings as a percentage of after-tax income _ was 4.3
percent, down from 5.2 percent in October.
   On Tuesday, the government released an encouraging report on
inflation, and that helped some of the financial markets.
   The dollar rallied Tuesday against most major currencies in
foreign-exchange trading, while bond prices rose sharply.
   The Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond rose nearly $10 per $1,000
face amount, while its yield, which moves inversely to price, fell
below 9 percent for the first time in a week.
   But on Wall Street, stocks declined. The Dow Jones average of 30
industrials, which was about 14 points higher at the opening, closed
down 6.61 at 2,166.07.
   Economists said the markets were encouraged by a Labor Department
report that showed inflation on the consumer level slowed in
November to an annual rate of just 3 percent. A drop in clothing
prices and stabilized prices for food contributed to the decline,
the department said.
   With only December left, another month similar to November could
enable the Reagan administration to finish its last year in office
meeting its inflation target of 4.3 percent for 1988, down slightly
from 1987's 4.4 percent.
   Also easing inflation worries was a Commerce Department report
that the gross national product _ the broadest measure of economic
health _ expanded at a moderate annual rate of 2.5 percent in the
third quarter due to the summer drought.
   For the same period, the department reported that after-tax
corporate profits rose 3.9 percent, down from a robust 8.9 percent
increase the previous quarter.
   ``Low inflation is good for all the markets. It means the
(economic) recovery was sustainable and long-lived,'' said Maury
Harris, chief economist for PaineWebber Inc.
   It also eases the pressure on interest rates, which have risen
sharply in recent weeks partly on inflationary fears.
   Inflation is considered the nemesis of financial markets,
particularly the credit markets, because it erodes the value of
fixed-income securities, sending yields higher to compensate for the
loss.
   That depresses the stock market, which competes for investor
money. And it often hurts the dollar because as prices of stocks and
bonds slip, foreigners become less willing to exchange their
currencies for dollars to buy U.S. securities.
   Wall Street speculation lately had centered on whether the
Federal Reserve will raise its discount rate, a key short-term
interest rate, to prevent the economy from overheating and inflation
from increasing.
   The discount rate is the interest the Fed charges on loans to
commercial banks and savings institutions, and is considered the
most direct vehicle for the central bank to express its credit
policies. Most economists had predicted the rate soon will be raised
0.5 percentage point to 7 percent.
   But Tuesday's inflation and GNP reports put some of those
discussions to rest, at least temporarily.
   ``Some people who jumped on the interest-rates-going-up,
fed-tightening bandwagon found out they were going on it
prematurely,'' said Robert A. Brusca, chief financial economist for
Nikko Securities Co. International. ``That's what the markets are
telling you.''

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures opened lower today on
the Chicago Board of Trade, reflecting disappointment over the
cancellation of some large export sales of U.S. soybeans and soybean
meal.
   Late Tuesday, the Agriculture Department announced the
cancellation of a sale of 200,000 metric tons of soybeans to the
Soviet Union.
   The USDA also announced cancellation of a sale of 200,000 metric
tons of soybean meal to an unknown destination, which was believed
to have been the Soviet Union.
   Analysts said such cancellations were not unheard of when dealing
with the Soviet Union, which has very limited port capacity.
   ``The bottom line is that they sometimes buy more than can
physically take and they probably have a clause that allows them to
get out of the commmitment,'' said Walter Spilka, a grain market
analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co. in New York.
   ``More than likely, they want the stuff but can't take it now,''
he said. ``More than likely, they'll be back to take it.''
   In early trading, wheat was 1} cents to 2} cents lower with the
contract for delivery in March at $4.34{ a bushel; corn was 1\ cents
to 1} cents lower with March at $2.78{ a bushel; oats were 2} cents
to 3{ cents lower with March at $2.24} a bushel; soybeans were }
cent to 7{ cents lower with January at $7.79 a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were mostly lower in early trading on
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were unchanged to .28 cent lower with February at
73.10 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .25 cent lower to .03 cent
higher with January at 83.85 cents a pound; live hogs were .10 cent
to .37 cent lower with February at 46.05 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .55 cent to .92 cent lower with February at 44.60 cents

   The Internal Revenue Service today previewed
the new tax forms that 101 million Americans should begin receiving
in the mail next week.
   The IRS traditionally mails out the 101 million tax packages
after Christmas in order to avoid the holiday crush but allow
taxpayers plenty of time to begin preparing their returns, which are
due on April 15.
   However, some taxpayers report they have already received the new
forms.
   In presenting the 1988 tax packages, IRS officials emphasized
that they contained few changes from the forms taxpayers used last
year.
   Last year, taxpayers for the first time filed returns that
reflected the more than 2,000 changes made by the Tax Reform Act of
1986.
   Despite the many changes on those forms the IRS said most
taxpayers were able to file accurate forms promptly and received
their returns on time. The IRS said that most of the changes this
year would be so subtle that they would likely go unnoticed by
taxpayers.
   The change with the biggest impact reflects the final reduction
in personal tax rates mandated by the sweeping 1986 tax overhaul law.
   However, those reductions are incorporated in the tax tables and
do not show up in the forms at all.
   IRS officials said that other changes had been made to clear up
confusion raised by last year's forms. One area where clarifying
changes were made involves the standard deduction. Because of
confusion, some taxpayers last year failed to enter their correct
standard deduction, thus lowering the refund they should have
received.
   IRS officials said those mistakes were caught when the IRS
returns were processed but the errors slowed down the mailing of the
taxpayers' refunds.
   In addition to mailing the tax packages, the IRS will make the
forms available at many banks, post offices and libraries.
   In a letter to taxpayers printed in the new tax package, IRS
Commissioner Lawrence Gibbs promised to search for new and better
ways to reduce the burden placed on the public.

<HEAD>Report: Pillsbury's Departing CEO Could Get Nearly $8 Million-plus</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Philip L. Smith, departing chief executive
officer of the Pillsbury Co., stands to reap nearly $8 million from
his five-month stint with the food and restaurant company, according
to a published report Wednesday.
   That doesn't include a pledge Smith won from Pillsbury this
month, guaranteeing the equity in his $1.53 million house, said the
Wall Street Journal report gleaned from merger documents and other
filings.
   During Smith's time at Pillsbury, the company waged an
unsuccessful battle against a hostile takeover bid by Grand
Metropolitan PLC and, on Tuesday, reported a 38 percent decline in
second-quarter earnings, a continuation of its long-standing
financial problems.
   Smith, 54, said Monday that he planned to leave Pillsbury early
next year when Grand Met takes over. He joined Pillsbury Aug. 1,
giving up the job of chairman and chief executive at Philip Morris
Co.'s General Foods Corp. unit. To woo him, Pillsbury made an offer
that included $1 million in annual pay and substantial stock
options, the Journal said.
   Pillsbury's agreement Sunday to accept a sweetened $5.68 billion,
or $66 per share, takeover bid from the British conglomerate, means
Smith will get even more.
   As a Pillsbury stockholder, Smith will be able to tender 75,000
shares for Grand Met, the Journal reported. At $66 apiece, that
holding would gross $4.95 million.
   Company documents indicate that Smith had purchased 3,000 of
those shares before joining the company, the Journal said. Upon the
acquisition, Smith will be able to sell the other 72,000 shares,
which had been awarded as long-term incentives, the Journal said,
quoting an unidentified Pillsbury spokesman. The merger agreement
provides that restrictions on stock options for all Pillsbury
executives would lapse.
   Smith, through the spokesman, on Tuesday declined to respond to
inquiries about his compensation arrangements, the Journal said. He
has said he expects to leave Pillsbury early next year, when Grand
Met takes control.
   When he became Pillsbury chairman, Smith was guaranteed $625,000
base pay, plus a bonus of $375,000 for the year ending next May 31.
Under an agreement that Pillsbury modified in November with Grand
Met in pursuit, senior executives would receive double their salary
and bonus as ``liquidated damages'' in any change of control. Thus,
Smith would be entitled to an additional $2 million. He also would
receive annual retirement benefits of at least $200,000, the Journal
reported.
   On Dec. 2, Pillsbury guaranteed that Smith wouldn't lose money on
the $1.53 million house he and his wife recently bought in
Deephaven, the newspaper said. If Smith can't sell the house within
six months of his termination following a change of control,
Pillsbury would buy the residence for what he paid, the Journal
reported.
   When Smith arrived at Pillsbury, the company's restaurants were
in financial trouble and the company was a rumored takeover
candidate. The battle with Grand Met occupied much of his energies
and gave him little opportunity to focus on operating problems.
   Pillsbury attributed its earnings decline for the second quarter
ended Nov. 30 to ``a substantial one-time investment in the Burger
King advertising fund and the cost of responding'' to Grand Met's
takeover bid.

<HEAD>Signing Delayed Over New Offer</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The troubled small-appliance maker Allegheny
International Inc. said it is weighing a new takeover offer while
continuing to negotiate with a previous bidder, Donaldson Lufkin &
Jenrette.
   Meanwhile, stockholders were awaiting U.S. Bankruptcy Judge
Joseph Cosetti's ruling on their recent request that they and
creditors be allowed to vote on the latest offer, from merchant
bankers led by Paul Levy, Angus Littlejohn and Peter Joseph.
   Gary Blum, attorney for the shareholders committee, said the
bankers' offer appears to be better for shareholders than the $811
million takeover proposal from Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette.
   Allegheny International's board signed a letter of intent to sign
the Donaldson offer, and said in papers filed in bankruptcy court
that it planned to sign the agreement at a meeting Friday.
   The signing was postponed, however, to consider the new offer,
company spokesman Edward Romanoff said Tuesday. The board plans to
meet again in early January.
   The company has not valued the latest offer.
   The bankers' offer would leave shareholders owning 49 percent of
the reorganized company, according to court papers. The Donaldson,
Lufkin and Jenrette plan would leave shareholders with 40 percent.
   Both plans would pay creditors in full, Blum said. The Donaldson
offer would leave the company intact with debts of around $400
million, while the bankers would sell the Sunbeam and Oster
appliance divisions, cutting the company and its long-term debts in
half.

   The stock market drifted lower today, struggling
to rebound from Tuesday's late decline.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 6.61 points on
Tuesday, slipped another 1.61 to 2,164.46 by noontime today on Wall
Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 4 to 3 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 536 up, 696 down and
627 unchanged.
   Analysts said traders began to sell Tuesday when the Dow Jones
industrials made a run past their 1988 closing high of 2,183.50,
reached on Oct. 21, but failed to hold the gain.
   That was widely regarded as a disappointing performance,
especially since the dollar and bonds both turned in strong showings.
   Since late November, the market has enjoyed a yearend rally led
by blue chips and stocks involved or rumored to be involved in
takeover plays.
   But many smaller ``secondary'' stocks have lagged behind,
apparently depressed by a lack of enthusiasm among individual
investors and selling for yearend tax purposes.
   Honeywell fell 2\ to 57}. Late Tuesday the company said a series
of writedowns might leave it with a loss of more than $400 million
for the year.
   Among the volume leaders, International Business Machines rose [
to 123]; General Electric was unchanged at 45}; Coca-Cola slipped [
to 44], and American Telephone & Telegraph lost \ to 29\.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dropped .03 to 155.71. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was up .34 at 300.01.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 65.30 million shares at noontime,
down from 82.05 million at the same point Tuesday.

   American steelmakers are dancing into what is
expected to be their third consecutive profitable year, and the
workers whose sacrifices helped make that possible say it's time for
them to get some of the wealth.
   ``Employees in the steel industry have done much more than their
share to save the industry and to build a foundation for its
future,'' the United Steelworkers of America union said in a policy
statement adopted in December.
   Profits are back, but not the corpulence that made easy pickings
of wage and benefit increases for the Steelworkers union in the two
decades before the 1982 collapse in steel.
   ``I think there's going to be great efforts made to depict what
the union does as a strategy. But my own hunch is there's going to
be a whole lot of improvising,'' said Ben Fischer, Carnegie Mellon
University labor specialist and former USW presidential assistant.
   The USW already has signaled its low regard for profit-sharing in
lieu of raises. It rejected such an offer from Alcoa and Reynolds
and held out for a 50 cent-per-hour wage increase along with profit
sharing, bonuses and pension increases from the aluminum industry
leaders in December.
   In addition, union leaders say privately that their relations
with LTV Corp., once unsurpassed among the major producers, have
been soured by a dispute over $100 million in profit-sharing
payments the union claims.
   Coordinated bargaining disintegrated in the industry's five-year
depression, leaving the union to negotiate separately with each
company and in some cases with individual plants. Like their
corporate-manager counterparts, USW officials are fewer and busier
these days.
   USX Corp., the nation's largest steelmaker, is sitting out this
round with a contract valid through January 1991, by which it can
only benefit if the competition has to endure a strike or increase
labor costs.
   LTV, Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel Corp. and the less influential
Sharon Steel Corp. are still in reorganization under federal
bankruptcy laws, and USW delegations there are standing in line
along with numerous other creditors for their piece of the
restructured companies.
   Fischer points out that steelmakers are developing close new
relations with customers, which force steel executives to represent
a new constituency when negotiating new labor contracts.
   ``To the extent this is so, this is a tremendous pressure in the
direction of decentralization'' of labor relations, he said.
   Moreover, maintaining lean new profiles will be high on the
agenda of Bethlehem Steel Corp., Inland Steel Co., Armco Inc. and
National Steel Corp. the four producers that will enter talks to
replace contracts expiring July 31 for 45,900 USW members.
   ``The steel companies have made good profits in 1988. They'll
make less in '89 in all likelihood...and of course what they do not
want to do is give away labor costs,'' said Donald F. Barnette, an
independent industry analyst.
   ``Whatever you give away this year becomes a base for future
years,'' he said.
   President-elect George Bush has already said, without giving
precise details, that he will extend the steel import quotas
limiting foreign metal to roughly 20 percent of the U.S. market.
Some economists see a consumer-led recession in 1988 that could work
its way back up the production chain to basic manufacturing.
   Barnett, for one, sees little more than a downturn in the steel
market.
   The consensus outlook, bright by comparison to the early 1980s,
gives the USW the hope of negotiating its first raises in six years.
   ``In economic terms, the industry is profitable. Our people have
contributed a great deal to that success and are entitled to share
in it,'' USW President Lynn Williams said.
   USW members accepted back-to-back three-year contracts starting
in 1983 that reduced wages and benefits by nearly $1.9 billion, as
estimated by the USW using American Iron and Steel Institute data.
The sacrifices amount to $4.5 billion when adjusted for inflation,
according to the union.
   Blue-collar employment plunged from around 175,000 workers in
1983 to less than 126,000 by 1987, a period in which production
capacity shrunk from 150 million tons to 112 million tons.
   The 25 top producers that report to the American Iron and Steel
Institute, an industry trade group, expect 1988 operating profits of
$2 billion or more.
   ``Those numbers are not as big as they seem,'' said Thomas
Graham, institute chairman and president of the steelmaking division
of USX. ``The steel industry in 1988 earned a little under 10
percent return on assets, below the average for other major
industries.''
   Steelmakers made $1 billion in 1987, after having lost $12
billion in the industry's 1982-86 depression.
   ``We proved from 1982 to 1986 that modernization investments,
together with major cost-cutting programs, would pay off in terms of
higher productivity, lower average production costs and improved
quality,'' Graham said.
   ``Now our task is to consolidate those gains, to continue
upgrading investments, (and) to repair the damage which those huge
losses have done to our companies through further improved
profitability,'' he said.

<HEAD>Auto Industry At Peace With Labor, Enjoying Bigger Profits</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Automakers received some pleasant surprises in
1988 _ higher sales, fatter profits and, for the most part, labor
peace.
   One Japanese company began shipping U.S.-made cars back home,
another began building cars in the United States, and General Motors
Corp. began flexing anew its muscle as No. 1 carmaker.
   In the fall of 1987, analysts fretted about flat sales in the
1988 model year, and less than two weeks into the model year the
stock market crashed, increasing gloomy predictions.
   But the 1988 model year ended Sept. 30 with automakers posting
the third-best sales year on record. Buyers drove 15.6 million cars
and light trucks off showroom floors.
   The calendar year promised an impressive performance as well,
depending on December sales.
   Financially, it was a good year for the Big Three automakers,
with analysts predicting at yearend that GM, Ford Motor Co. and
Chrysler Corp. would combine for a record $11 billion in earnings.
   Ford posted industry-record quarterly earnings during the first
and second three-month periods of the year, taking in $1.62 billion
and $1.66 billion, respectively.
   In the third quarter, historically a period of lower earnings, GM
surprised analysts by outearning Ford for the first time in five
quarters with $859.2 million.
   Moves designed to strengthen GM's position that started as far
back as 1982 were beginning to show results, GM Chairman Roger Smith
said in a yearend interview. ``Quality has come up, our new plants
are on stream...A lot of the investments we made are paying off.''
   While GM was streamlining, Ford and some overseas carmakers
snatched some of the market that had put GM at the top.
   Securities analyst Charles Brady of Oppenheimer & Co. said Wall
Street is beginning to take GM officials' promises of economic
improvement more seriously.
   ``That's what they've been trying to indicate for the better part
of six to seven months,'' he said. ``The skepticism regarding the
turnaround was phenomenal. But you're seeing the vast majority of
the people beginning to believe.''
   In labor relations, 1988 was relatively smooth for GM and Ford,
rougher for Chrysler. The year was headlined by an early contract
agreement between Chrysler and the United Auto Workers.
   That contract ratified in May brings the UAW's contracts with
each of the Big Three to a common expiration date _ Sept. 14, 1990.
The UAW agreed to three-year contracts with GM and Ford in 1987.
   The path to the Chrysler-UAW contract was rocky.
   The company faced noisy protest demonstrations after Chairman Lee
Iacocca announced Chrysler may sell its Acustar Inc. parts
subsidiary. Chrysler later scrapped that idea.
   The company announced in April, three days after negotiations
began, that it would move production of its K-cars to Mexico from
the United States. Chrysler backed down on that temporarily.
   But in Kenosha, Wis., Chrysler remained committed to close an
aging former American Motors Corp. assembly plant Dec. 23,
eliminating 5,500 jobs.
   Other notable auto industry events during 1988 included:
   _Toyota Motor Manufacturing U.S.A. Inc. began building cars at a
new plant in Georgetown, Ky., and Diamond-Star Motors, a
collaboration between Mitsubishi Motors Corp. of Japan and Chrysler
in Illinois, started production.
   _Offers of cash rebates moved in and out, Oldsmobile offered free
gasoline and airplane tickets, and Chrysler experimented with money
back or exchange guarantees in new-car purchases in two markets.
   _In March, American Honda Motor Co. began shipping two-door
Accords from its plant in Marysville, Ohio, to Japan.
   _Iacocca gave a clear indication about his choice for a successor
in mid-November when he announced a restructuring in the company's
executive office suites. Chrysler Motors Chairman Gerald Greenwald
was named vice chairman of the parent corporation, to share the
office of chairman with Iacocca, who has three years left on his
contract.
   _In Washington, the Transportation Department in October set
fuel-economy standards at 26.5 miles per gallon for 1989 cars. GM
and Ford had said a higher corporate average fuel economy standard
could cause layoffs and production cuts.
   Chrysler said it could meet the original target of 27.5 mpg for
1989 models.

   Slowly a colorful batch of sugar is twisted
into tasty sticks in the tiny factory of a candy-making family
dynasty.
   Hatcher's Candy Co. has no use for advertising. No signs mark the
converted white house where the clan has carefully created candy for
40 years.
   ``It's just word of mouth,'' C.M. Hatcher explains. ``We're
small.''
   The company telephone number isn't listed in the book, but the
tourists come. They drive past the lumber yards on their way south
for Christmas to pick up a peppermint bowl or two at the corner
house.
   The old-timers follow their noses and neighborhood children
sometimes show up for free tastes until Hatcher's son, Tony, sends
them on their way.
   ``It started with my granddaddy,'' the younger Hatcher said. ``My
daddy's been making candy since he was 13. My mamma and daddy raised
me under that table over there.''
   The process is slow, even at Christmas when the family's special
edible bowls and baskets are most in demand. Father and son, with
help from a few relatives and others hired for the holiday rush,
mold more than 4,000 of their trademarks for Christmas.
   ``I've just been in it about 15 years,'' said Tony Hatcher, who
took over when his father formally retired. ``If it has to do with
sugar, daddy can make it.''
   The hard candy starts at two open furnaces, the same ones
Hatcher's grandfather used before he died. Sugar and water are mixed
together in vats and cooked over open flame. The caramel-colored
liquid is poured onto a cooling slab, where Hatcher and Doug Thomas
fold it as it crusts and thickens.
   ``You gotta like it to stay in it, especially this time of
year,'' said Thomas, who's been making candy with Hatcher's father
for 30 years.
   A pulling machine is the next step. Hatcher's grandfather pulled
his own, but the machine helps. Like taffy, the sugar turns until
the mixture becomes milky white and Hatcher adds a liquid flavoring.
The batch is then kneaded like bread dough on a warm, cloth-covered
table.
   Red coloring is added to a chunk that is carefully pulled and
intertwined with white to make stripes. The stripes are wrapped
around the batch before it's carried over to the twisting table and
fed into a simple shaping and cutting machine for candy sticks.
   Bowls are hand-molded, cooled, filled with sticks and wrapped in
plastic. Baskets, with braided handles, are packed in cardboard
boxes. The sticks are hand-packaged and heat-sealed under the family
label that has remained the same over the years: ``Delicious
Hatcher's Assorted Candy.''
   The Hatchers add hand-turned green and red candy flowers with wax
candles to make some baskets into table centerpieces. Solid, striped
sugar is molded into the shape of vases and intricate red candy
roses with green leaves are added for special customers.
   The Hatchers sell to a couple of grocery chains. Their candy also
can be found in tourist shops throughout the region. Hatcher, 39,
makes candy five days a week and delivers it the other two.
   ``A lot of your factories use liquid sugar, and it's vacuum
cooked. They're into quantity. I kind of like quality,'' he said.
   From Nov. 1 until Christmas, the company used about 6,000 pounds
of sugar a week, about double the ordinary volume, to make about 30,
75-pound batches a day. One batch yields about 2,500 sticks or 65
bowls.
   Hatcher's father, who worked in candy factories before he struck
out on his own, remembers when sugar cost 5 cents a pound, compared
with up to 40 cents now. The family used to sell to country markets
and commissary stores in the coalfields of southwest Virginia, but
those days are gone.
   ``We sold plenty of candy in the coalfields. They were goin'
pretty good back then,'' the elder Hatcher said. ``All the mom and
pop stores are gone.''
   There are four younger Hatchers who have expressed an interest in
the family business after they complete college.
   ``It's just enough to get by,'' Tony Hatcher said of the
company's profit. ``I hope they get into it.''

   A Manhattan federal grand jury today indicted
Singer Co. Chairman and corporate takeover investor Paul A.
Bilzerian on securities and tax fraud charges.
   The 12 count indictment charged Bilzerian, 38, of St. Petersburg,
Fla., with allegedly engaging in a variety of fraudulent and
deceptive practices in connection with four different multimillion
dollar securities transactions in 1985 and 1986. Bilzerian quickly
issued a statement asserting his innocence.
   A one-time real estate investor who has made runs on several big
companies, Bilzerian took control of Singer, a major defense
contractor, in a $1.06 billion takeover struggle that began after
the October 1987 stock market crash.
   The indictment today followed several reports that federal
investigators were probing Bilzerian's activities in at least two
big takeover situations.
   The transactions specified in the indictment involved Bilzerian's
attempted takeover of Cluett, Peabody & Co.; Bilzerian's alleged
ownership of 58,000 shares of H.H. Robertson Co.; Bilzerian's
attempted takeover of Hammermill Paper Co. and his alleged ownership
of 306,600 shares of Armco Steel.
   In addition to fraud, Bilzerian is also charged with conspiracy
and making false statements to the government.
   Each count carries a maximum five years in prison and $250,000 in
fines upon conviction. He is scheduled to be arraigned at federal
court in Manhattan Dec. 29.
   Bilzerian said in a statement released through his Washington
attorney Arthur F. Mathews:
   ``I intend to fight this indictment and I expect to be
vindicated,'' Bilzerian said in a statement released through his
Washington attorney Arthur F. Mathews. ``This indictment is unfair,
unprecedented and unwarranted.''
   Bilzerian said further that he believed the indictment ``is the
price I'm paying with having publicly becomed identified with
takeovers _ a business activity concerning which the prosecutors in
New York appear to have lost all perspective.''

   The Nuclear Regulatory Commission today ruled
that the Seabrook, N.H., nuclear power plant is financially
qualified to run low-power tests and said that the plant could
receive its low-power license by Jan. 6.
   The commission also ruled unanimously that the Pilgrim plant in
Plymouth, Mass., could resume full-power operations after being shut
down for nearly 3 years.
   Pilgrim spokeswoman Elaine Robinson said Tuesday that if the
Plymouth plant got the go-ahead today, it would begin startup
procedures before Jan. 1, although it would take four months to get
the reactor back up to full production.
   In the Seabrook case, the commissioners said that Seabrook
officials must set aside $72.1 million for decommissioning costs in
case the plant receives the low-power license, but never secures a
full-power commercial license.
   Deputy general counsel Martin Malsch also said that the
commission's licensing board must rule on another Seabrook matter
before the low-power permit is issued.
   Seabrook spokesman Sean O'Neill said the ruling ``appears to be
good news for Seabrook Station,'' although plant officials had not
yet seen the order and could not comment further.
   Ted C. Feigenbaum, a vice president with New Hampshire Yankee,
said predicted that the pending Atomic Safety and Licensing Board
issue would be quickly resolved and that testing would begin in
January.
   Robert Backus, lawyer for the Seacoast Anti-Pollution League,
criticized the ruling, saying, ``It's going to be hard for them to
justify a decision to let a bankrupt company run a nuclear plant,
with the other associated financial problems'' Seabrook owners face.
He said plant opponents would appeal once the commission grants the
low-power license.
   Roy Morrison, spokesman for the anti-nuclear Clamshell Alliance,
called the decision a ``dangerous and irresponsible step that would
be met by non-violent citizen protests.''
   Critics led by Massachusetts Gov. Michael S. Dukakis have vowed
to fight the Seabrook permit in federal court and have hinted at
challenging a Pilgrim restart.
   Emergency evacuation planning is at the center of both
controversies.
   Massachusetts officials are opposed to opening the Sabrook plant
at all, arguing that narrow roads in seacoast towns in the northeast
of their state near the plant make it impossible to quickly evacuate
the area in the case of an atomic emergency.
   And they say Pilgrim should not reopen until an approved
evacuation plan is in place. The Federal Emergency Management Agency
ruled last year that the current plan is inadequate.
   The commission ordered Seabrook officials in September to prove
that they could cover the costs of decommissioning the reactor if
the plant received a testing license but never obtained the
full-power permit.
   In addition, the commissioners were asked by plant opponents to
lift an agency rule and consider the overall financial qualification
of the plant owners.
   Public Service Company of New Hampshire, the plant's lead owner,
filed for bankruptcy reorganization in January. And in June, the
fourth-largest shareholder, Massachusetts Municipal Wholesale
Electric Co., withdrew from the project and halted its payments of
$2 million a month.
   ``Creditors are currently in court trying to protect their
assets,'' Sen. John F. Kerry, D-Mass., a leading Seabrook critic,
said Tuesday. ``If the NRC goes ahead with the low-level licensing
procedure before the asset question is finalized, the NRC could
jeopardize the situation and make the ongoing financial instability
even greater.''
   The Pilgrim plant, a 670-megawatt plant 40 miles south of Boston,
was shut down for management and safety problems on April 12, 1986.
Only the Browns Ferry reactors in Alabama, run by the beleaguered
Tennessee Valley Authority, have been idle longer.
   Officials at Boston Edison Co., operator of Pilgrim, said the
16-year-old plant is ready to be restarted after $35 million in
safety improvements and a sweeping management reorganization. The
commission's staff agreed that the plant is ready to resume
operations.
   But opponents said an approved evacuation plan must be in place
before the plant starts up.
   ``If the NRC chooses to turn on Pilgrim they will in effect be
saying that, in their view, the issue of evacuation is
meaningless,'' Kerry said Tuesday.
   ``If the NRC takes the callous approach and restarts Pilgrim, the
message is clear: the NRC is more concerned with the economic health
of the nuclear industry than with the health and well being of the
people it is supposed to be protecting,'' he added.
   The Pilgrim shutdown has cost Boston Edison an estimated $600
million, including $230,000 a day in replacement energy costs,
company officials said.

   Roger B. Smith sits in a corner office of
industrial America, looking over his desk filled with model cars and
trucks, trying to drive the nation's largest corporation off the
shoulder and back into the passing lane.
   The General Motors Corp. chairman, a one-time accountant who
never worked an assembly line, says things are getting better for
the company, which has faced lower profits in the past few years
while domestic and foreign rivals have lured customers with snazzier
and more innovative vehicles.
   During that time, GM has been streamlining layers of management
and outfitting plants with new equipment to introduce a few
innovations of its own.
   It has closed more than a dozen plants and cut more than 130,000
people from the payroll, including a 25 percent reduction in its
white-collar work force.
   It was under Smith's auspices that the symbol of U.S. industrial
might took a back seat to Ford Motor Co. in earnings and watched its
share of the U.S. market slip 10 percentage points from mid-1986 to
48.6 percent now.
   GM has been rebounding lately, the 63-year-old chairman is proud
to say.
   ``A lot of the things we did dating back to 1982 are starting to
pay off now, that's the big thing,'' he said in a yearend interview
in his 14th floor office of the GM Building. ``Our quality has come
up, our new plants are on stream, a lot of the things in the old
plants aren't even done yet...
   ``A lot of the (plant and equipment) investments we made are
paying off,'' he said. ``It's just a slow steady grinding of the
progress we've been working on.''
   Smith pointed to surprisingly strong third-quarter earnings, a
resurgence in sales and, most visibly for employees, an announcement
earlier this month of profit-sharing _ the first since 1985 _
amounting to about $200 per worker.
   The GM chairman is well versed in the finances of the
corporation, an attribute for which he has been both praised and
rebuked. He began his career with the automaker as a general
accounting senior clerk in 1949, and rose through the company's
finance arm before winning a director's seat in 1974.
   Some critics have said Smith is so preoccupied with numbers and
let style slip to the point where it was hard to tell a Buick from a
Chevy from an Olds, giving all GM cars that boxy look. The automaker
is trying to change that perception with its 1989 models.
   Smith himself is fond of the classic styles GM pioneered. He owns
two Corvettes _ a 1960 and a '67 _ a '64 Corvair and a muted yellow
1936 Cadillac convertible sedan.
   ``It's the big old long wheelbase, one with a divider windshield
and a hood that runs from here to down there and back again,'' he
said gesturing toward the other side of his office.
   ``They're great cars,'' he said. ``The only problem is that the
engine is so big and the pistons are so small I have trouble knowing
when the engine's running.''
   Smith keeps the Caddy at his summer home near Burt Lake in the
extreme northern part of Michigan's Lower Peninsula. He takes it out
frequently there.
   ``People wave at you, they think it's nice. The people are waving
at the car, I think.''
   Smith plans to retire in 1990, a decade after he was elected
chairman and chief executive officer amid one of the toughest times
for the automobile industry.
   During the 1980s, the industry as a whole has recovered and is
approaching the second-best sales year on record. U.S. sales
estimates for 1988 are running at more than 15.5 million cars and
light trucks, second only to the 1986 record of 16.3 million.
   Smith sees pretty good times ahead.
   ``If you flatten at 15 (million),'' he said, ``I don't have any
problem with that. I think General Motors is particularly
well-positioned. We've got a lot of our new plants that were in the
startup phase last year.''
   Smith holds out great hope for Saturn Corp., a subsidiary
building a plant outside Nashville, Tenn. Little news about the car
has been released, other than it will be a compact or subcompact,
marketed via a new dealer network.
   ``I think Saturn is going to be a colossal success,'' Smith said.
``Under budget and ahead of schedule, that's what we like.''
   Production is to begin in 1990 for the 1991 model year.
   One potential unknown for the industry will be the policy of the
Bush administration. Smith, like other automobile company
executives, is cautious about forecasting Washington's policy shifts.
   ``A little tiny stroke of a pen down there can shatter our
industry,'' he said. ``Look what they're talking about on a
15-cent-a-gallon gas tax that can take 150,000 jobs out of this
industry. That's crazy.''
   Smith reacts strongly when he feel the industry or GM is
threatened. But he has spent his time in the bullseye too.
   Besides taking criticism that he is too finance-conscious, Smith
came under sharp attack by former GM board member H. Ross Perot for
executive excesses. Perot was severed from the board with a $750
million buyout after his Electronic Data Systems computer company
was bought by GM in December 1986.
   Through all the controversy, Smith has tried to keep the lid on _
something he dislikes in automobiles.
   All the cars in Smith's garages are soft tops.
   ``I like convertibles,'' he said, ``and I like fast cars and I
like to drive.''

   One of the tighest-held secrets around General
Motors Corp. is just what its new Saturn Corp. car will look like
when it's introduced in late 1990.
   The secrecy has carried over to this year's holiday card from the
GM subsidiary.
   ``After months of exhaustive effort,'' reads the card's cover,
``the Saturn Corporation has developed a beautiful and economical
holiday greeting card.''
   And inside:
   ``But we've decided not to show it until sometime in 1990.''
   Saturn spokesman Mark Tanner said the card's text was a team
effort.

   The stock market lost ground today in a carryover
of selling from Tuesday's late decline.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 6.61 points on
Tuesday, slipped another 5.18 to 2,160.89 by 2 p.m. today on Wall
Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 4 to 3 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 572 up, 791 down and
588 unchanged.
   Analysts said traders began to sell Tuesday when the Dow Jones
industrials made a run past their 1988 closing high of 2,183.50,
reached on Oct. 21, but failed to hold the gain.
   That was widely regarded as a disappointing performance,
especially since the dollar and bonds both turned in strong showings.
   Since late November, the market has enjoyed a yearend rally led
by blue chips and stocks involved or rumored to be involved in
takeover plays.
   But many smaller ``secondary'' stocks have lagged behind,
apparently depressed by a lack of enthusiasm among individual
investors and selling for yearend tax purposes.
   Honeywell fell 2[ to 57~. Late Tuesday the company said a series
of writedowns might leave it with a loss of more than $400 million
for the year.
   Bolt Beranek & Newman, which said it expects to post a loss for
the fiscal quarter that ends Dec. 31, dropped 2~ to 10{.
   Fairchild Industries jumped 2] to 15}. An investment partnership
offered to acquire the company for $15.50 a share.
   Among the blue chips, International Business Machines was
unchanged at 123\; General Electric dropped ] to 45]; Coca-Cola
slipped \ to 44\, and American Telephone & Telegraph lost \ to 29\.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dropped .24 to 155.50. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was up .40 at 300.07.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 97.17 million shares with two
hours to go.

<HEAD>Southland Sells Chunk to Outside Investors, Hires Drexel as Banker</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Southland Corp., parent company of 7-Eleven
convenience stores, has sold part of the company to a group of
outside investors and switched investment bankers, documents
outlining the company's $4.9 billion debt-financed restructuring
show.
   The documents disclose that Southland, which struggled to
complete financing for the deal last December, dumped the investment
banking firms of Goldman, Sachs & Co. and Salomon Brothers Inc., in
favor of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., the leading underwriter of
high-yield ``junk bond'' securities that play an important role in
many debt-restructurings.
   The documents, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission
on Tuesday, show Southland seeks to reduce interest expenses by
exchanging new debt securities for nearly $1 billion in existing
securities with yields of 18 percent.
   To compensate debtholders for a yield that could average 3.5
percentage points less than the existing securities, Southland has
agreed to make the new notes senior to other debt, meaning that
holders would have priority in getting repaid.
   The new Southland debt, which could repay investors in either
cash or more debt securities, will shorten the repayment schedule to
June 1997 from a December 2007 deadline specified for the existing
issue.
   The company indicated that to gain approval of the new
arrangement from banks holding $2 billion in term loans, Southland
has pledged to accelerate a $100 million repayment and will pledge
as collateral 800 of the firm's approximately 7,200 7-Eleven stores.
   In addition, the documents show Drexel helped Southland sell
about 25 percent of the company to an unidentified group of
investors for an undisclosed price.
   Spokeswoman Cecilia Norwood said the emergence of Drexel in no
way reflects a dissatisfaction with Southland's former investment
bankers. Instead, Drexel presents the company with its best
alternative for reducing its costs of its obligations to lenders,
she said.
   ``Since we went private, it's been fairly well known that we have
been searching for ways of reducing the size and cost of our debt.''

<HEAD>Barry Minkow Praises Prosecutors in Holiday Wishes</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: Misspellings in quoted material cq.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Barry Minkow, who convinced Wall Street he was
a business genius before his ZZZZ Best rug-shampooing company turned
out to be a fraud, gave his prosecutors a Christmas card.
   ``Just a brief note to wish you both a wonderful holiday
season,'' Minkow wrote to assistant U.S. attorneys Gordon Greenberg
and James Asperger, who convinced a jury he was guilty of 57 counts
in the securities fraud case.
   ``You guys truely are the best at what you do,'' wrote Minkow,
22, who is facing a prison term of up to 403 years.
   There were numerous misspellings in the card, hand-delivered to
the attorneys last week during jury deliberations. ``I'm too cheap
to send this card,'' Minkow said in a P.S.
   ``I wouldn't have wanted anyone else up there making me look
soooo bad,'' the hand-printed message continued. ``I am really sorry
for all the trouble I've caused you and your staff. But the real
tragidy would of been if I haven't learned anything through all of
this. But I have! God bless you both and I wish you all the best in
the future.
   ``All my best wishes, Barry.''
   The stamped message on the card read: ``Remembering you is one of
the special joys of the season.''
   Minkow became familiar to millions of people through appearances
in television ads and talk shows, portraying himself as a
clean-living, hard-working super-salesman who began his company in
his parents' garage.
   He was convicted last week of 57 counts of conspiracy, securities
fraud, mail fraud and credit card fraud and is to be sentenced Feb.
21.

<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices closed higher
Wednesday on the Chicago Board of Trade with corn and soybeans
posting strong gains amid a generally bullish outlook for export
sales.
   The markets had opened lower in reaction to the Agriculture
Department's announcement late Tuesday of some cancelled export
sales, including a sale of 200,000 metric tons of soybeans to the
Soviet Union.
   But the disappointment quickly faded amid news of strong export
sales of corn and ``inherent bullishness in the market,'' said
Walter Spilka, a grain-market analyst with Smith Barney, Harris
Upham & Co. in New York.
   ``I suspect traders would argue that although the Soviets have
canceled these purchases, they will make some purchases further down
the road,'' he said. ``It's inevitable that some new business will
filter back in.''
   Wheat futures prices rose shortly before the close on a report
that China was bidding for 400,000 metric tons of subsidized U.S.
wheat under the USDA's Export Enhancement Program, analysts said.
   At the close, wheat was unchanged to 3{ cents higher with the
contract for delivery in March at $4.38} a bushel; corn was 4{ cents
to 6} cents higher with March at $2.84{ a bushel; oats were 3{ cents
to 4\ cents higher with March at $2.32 a bushel; soybeans were 5

   Martin Marietta Commercial Titan Inc. on Wednesday
announced it has signed a contract with Hughes Aircraft Co. to
launch two communications satellites on Commercial Titan launch
vehicles.
   Terms of the contract were not announced.
   Richard E. Brackeen, president of Commercial Titan, a wholly
owned subsidiary of Martin Marietta Corp., said the Hughes contract
brings to six the number of satellites to be launched on the
Commercial Titan, according to a Martin Marietta news statement.
   Two Hughes HS 601-class communications satellites will be
launched under the contract. The Hughes HS 601 has been selected for
the Navy's next-generation ultra-high-frequency communications
satellite program. Hughes also will employ the satellites for direct
broadcast use during the early 1990s, according to the news
statement.
   The first launch of a Commercial Titan is scheduled for the
summer of 1989 from Cape Canaveral, Fla., when communications
satellites for the Japan Communication Satellite Co. and the British
Ministry of Defense will be taken into space.

<HEAD>Paper Mills Plan 3.3 Percent Annual Capacity Expansion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. paper mills plan to expand capacity for
making paper and paperboard by an average of 3.3 percent a year over
the next three years, reflecting growing U.S. demand and healthy
exports, the American Paper Institute said Wednesday.
   The capacity to produce wood pulp, the raw material for paper,
will grow a smaller 2.6 percent a year over the same 1989-91 period,
the institute said. The difference will be made up by increasing use
of recyclable paper, it said.
   The institute's forecast is based on a survey of producers'
expansion plans. This marks the second year in which producers
raised their plans for capacity expansion, the institute said.
   Last year the institute predicted total capacity in 1990 would
reach 84.1 million tons of paper and paperboard and 64.4 million
tons of wood pulp.
   This year it predicted capacity would exceed those figures in
1990 and in 1991 would total 88.6 million tons of paper and
paperboard and 67.8 million tons of wood pulp.
   Paper output is closely tied to the health of the overall economy
because paper is used in all areas of business. Paperboard is used
in boxes, so its use grows when production and shipments increase.
   Improved productivity and the decline in the dollar also put
American producers in a better position to increase exports, said
Richard Storat, the institute's vice president for economic and
financial services.
   The producers predicted annual capacity growth of 3.9 percent for
printing and writing papers; 5.2 percent for newsprint; 2.7 percent
for tissue papers; 2.1 percent for solid bleached paperboard; and
1.8 percent for recycled paperboard. Capacity for unbleached kraft
packaging papers, the kind used in grocery bags, should rise
slightly after two years of decline, they predicted.

   The New York Stock Exchange said Wednesday a seat
on the exchange sold for $620,000, down $30,000 from the last sale
on Dec. 8.
   The lowest sale price of 1988 was $580,000 on Aug. 31. The

the stock market crash.
   Following the deal, the current highest bid for an NYSE seat is

   The bid is what someone is willing to pay for a seat, while the
offer is what a seller is willing to accept.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The largest undeveloped plot of land in the city,
a 76-acre, riverfront rail yard on Manhattan's West Side, will
remain the private domain of Donald Trump, the developer announced
Wednesday.
   He intends to proceed with plans to build the world's tallest
building on the site as part of his ``Trump City'' project, a
mixed-use development that would include apartments, retail and
office space.
   A Trump spokesman, noting that teams of bidders from four
continents were interested in the parcel, said all discussions with
potential buyers have been terminated.
   ``Now that all talk of sale is behind us, we hope to be certified
to begin the ULURP (Uniform Land Use Review Procedure) and zoning
processes in the next several months,'' Trump said in a prepared
statement.
   Trump bought the 15-block site, then called Lincoln West, four
years ago at the fire sale price of $95 million from Argentine
businessman Francisco Macri and Abraham Hirschfeld, who ran into
financial problems trying to develop the property.
   When asked at a news conference two months ago about reports that
he had been offered more than $500 million for the site, Trump
replied: ``I don't believe anyone has enough money to pay me for
this piece of land.''
   He used a different tone in his statement Wednesday, saying:
``Building a great city for New York and New Yorkers is more
important to me than selling this unique and wonderful site for a
very substantial, short-term profit.''
   The mammoth project would include a 150-story apartment tower,
eight 60-story residential towers, three smaller towers, shopping
mall, marina and 20 acres of parks between 59th and 72nd Streets.
   Trump's plans have met with almost universal criticism from
environmentalists, preservationists and community groups.

   Takeover guru Henry Kravis has asked the Japanese
for help in financing his firm's record $24.53 billion buyout of RJR
Nabisco Inc., and on Wednesday made a sales pitch for the ``junko
bondos'' to be issued as part of the deal.
   Kravis, principal of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co., and
representatives from Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. met for about two
hours with 240 investment bankers and institutional investors in
Tokyo, according to spokesmen for Kravis and Drexel. It was one of a
reported series of meetings.
   They said the two groups discussed the $5 billion in high-yield,
high-risk ``junk bonds'' _ or ``junko bondos,'' as they're often
called in Japan _ that will be sold to finance KKR's $109-a-share
RJR takeover.
   KKR also will be borrowing $14 billion from a syndicate of banks,
and it hopes to have significant Japanese representation there as
well. Kravis met with about a dozen large Japanese banks earlier
this week in Tokyo.
   Steven S. Anreder, a senior vice president at Drexel, said
Wednesday's Tokyo meeting ``went very well.''
   ``I'm told the investors were very enthusiastic'' about buying
bonds, he said.
   Drexel and Merrill Lynch & Co., KKR's two main Wall Street
financial brokers, will be underwriting the debt securities.
   Neither they nor KKR would say how many bonds they hoped to sell
to the typically conservative Japanese investors, although analysts
noted that Japanese interest in these bonds has increased
signficantly in recent years.
   The foreign market share now totals around 3 percent, with a
large portion made up of Japanese investors, compared to just a
small fraction a few years ago, according to a recent General
Accounting Office report and analysts.
   The volume of junk bonds also has increased over the years, as
more and more companies find use for them in acquisitions. They're
called junk only because they're issued by companies whose credit
ratings are below investment grade. That's the case with RJR Nabisco
due to the huge debt load from the buyout.
   While junk bonds will play an important role in KKR's financing,
the majority of RJR Nabisco's resulting debt will come from bank
loans.
   Before meeting with the Japanese banks, Kravis met with
representatives from 40 big international banks in New York to seek
commitments of at least $500 million by Jan. 17. About 100 smaller
U.S. banks will be asked for $100 million to $500 million at a
meeting in early January.
   Banks that commit loan money by Jan. 6 ``will be paid a modest
incentive,'' said James P. Ferguson, a managing director for
acquisition finance at Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co., one of four
lead banks on the transaction.
   Ferguson said the Japanese are expected to put up about one-third
of the $14 billion in bank loans.

   The stock market posted a small loss today in a
carryover of selling from Tuesday's late decline.
   Analysts said traders began to sell Tuesday when the Dow Jones
industrials made a run past their 1988 closing high of 2,183.50,
reached on Oct. 21, but failed to hold the gain.
   That was widely regarded as a disappointing performance,
especially since the dollar and bonds both turned in strong showings.
   Since late November, the market has enjoyed a yearend rally led
by blue chips and stocks involved or rumored to be involved in
takeover plays.
   But many smaller ``secondary'' stocks have lagged behind,
apparently depressed by a lack of enthusiasm among individual
investors and selling for yearend tax purposes.

<NOTE>Eds: RETRANSMITTING to restore cycle designator.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The European Economic Community's
executive body disclosed a plan Wednesday to open up the life
insurance market in the 12-nation trade bloc.
   The plan by the EEC Commission would allow individuals to shop
around the bloc for life insurance policies and would permit
insurance companies to offer their services throughout the trade
bloc without having to set up a branch or subsidiary.
   It is part of the EEC's drive to create a single market of trade,
goods and investment by the end of 1992.
   The plan contains a controversial reciprocity clause which would
allow foreign insurers to offer their services in all EEC nations,
to the extent that their home countries give EEC insurers reciprocal
market access.
   The clause has been used already in draft EEC legislation
liberalizing banking and investment services.
   Under the terms of the plan, which needs approval by the 12
member states, insurers from one country selling services in another
would be bound by the rules governing domestic sales.

<HEAD>Pillsbury's Departing CEO Could Get Nearly $8 Million</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TONY KENNEDY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pillsbury Co. Chairman Philip L. Smith, who
arrived at the food and restaurant company less than four months
ago, could depart nearly $8 million richer under the pending
takeover by Grand Metropolitan PLC, according to documents reviewed
Wednesday.
   The British liquor, gambling, food and specialty products
conglomerate is expected to take control of Pillsbury in late
January or early February and say goodbye to Smith, who had been
hired to replace William H. Spoor as chairman and chief executive
officer.
   Smith's tenure was dominated by Pillsbury's unsuccessful battle
against Grand Met's hostile takeover attempt, which ended Sunday
with Pillsbury accepting a negotiated offer of $5.7 billion, or $66
a share.
   In Smith's only full quarter with the company, Pillsbury
experienced a 38 percent decline in quarterly earnings compared with
the same period a year ago. Chiefly because the company took a $21.5
million charge to pay expenses related to the takeover battle,
Pillsbury's profits for the three months ended Nov. 30 were $44.8
million, or 52 cents a share, compared with $72.5 million, or 84
cents a share, from the same quarter a year ago.
   Smith, 54, left his job as chairman and chief executive at
General Foods Corp. to replace Spoor, who had come out of retirement
briefly in February to replace John M. Stafford.
   As part of Smith's employment agreement, he received 30,000
shares of Pillsbury stock worth $2.17 million under the buyout,
according to Pillsbury's 1988 proxy statement. He had purchased
3,000 shares before joining Pillsbury and will receive under the
terms of his contract an additional 30,000 shares because of the
change in control, according to the proxy statement.
   That would give Smith 63,000 shares to tender at $66 a share for
$4.15 million. And that doesn't take into account additional shares
that Smith will earn under the company's four-year management
incentive plan. The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday that
Smith will be able to tender 75,000 Pillsbury shares for a total of
$4.95 million in all.
   In addition, Smith's base salary at Pillsbury is $625,000 a year
plus a minimum annual bonus of $375,000 for the year ended May 31,
1989, according to the proxy statement. He would be entitled under
the takeover to an additional $2 million because of a modified
agreement approved in November by Pillsbury's board of directors
that gives Smith and 10 other top executives the right to
``liquidated damages equal to two times the executive's base salary
and targeted annual bonus.''
   The damages are triggered ``upon the company's termination of the
executive's employment or the voluntary termination by the executive
for `good reason,''' according to the agreement.
   Another clause in Smith's employment contract says his retirement
benefits ``will not be less than $200,000 per year in the event of a
change in control of the company,'' the proxy statement said.
   The Wall Street Journal also reported Wednesday that Pillsbury on
Dec. 2 guaranteed that Smith wouldn't lose money on the $1.53
million house he and his wife recently bought in Deephaven, an
exclusive Minneapolis suburb. If Smith can't sell the house within
six months of his termination following a change of control,
Pillsbury would buy the residence for what he paid, the Journal
reported.
   Pillsbury spokesman Larry Haeg said the company had no comment on
Smith's compensation package or the Journal story.

<HEAD>US Plans No New Efforts to Delay European Ban on American Meat</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SALLY JACOBSEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States plans no new efforts
to try to delay a European ban scheduled to go into effect in less
than two weeks on imports of hormone-treated meat from America, a
U.S. official said Wednesday.
   ``As near as I can tell we are now on a collision course set for
Jan. 1,'' said Alfred Kingon, the U.S. ambassador to the 12-nation
European Economic Community.
   He said in an interview he didn't know what new proposals could
be made to the trading bloc to try to resolve the dispute.
   ``I honestly don't know what they could be ...,'' he said.
``We've given them any number of suggestions on how to resolve this
and they've turned them down.''
   At issue is a decision by the EEC to prohibit for health reasons
all meat from animals treated with growth hormones. The United
States contends the use of certain hormones to fatten animals, a
common practice among American farmers, does not pose a health risk.
   The ban was to have taken effect Jan. 1, 1988, but the trading
bloc agreed to a one-year delay. It has refused U.S. appeals for
another, however brief, postponement.
   Kingon said that last week he formally requested a delay of a few
months to give new administrations coming into office in the United
States and at the community's executive body in Brussels a chance to
tackle the issue.
   ``It's a terrible inheritance to leave to them,'' he said.
   Moreover, he said, the European Parliament, the community's
legislative arm, is taking a look at the issue and expected to
release a report early next year.
   The EEC, also known as the Common Market, earlier in the week
denied the U.S. request but did narrow the ban to exclude pet food.
   U.S. officials estimated 140 million to 150 million dollars of
American meat would be kept out of the community. Pet food accounts
for about 20 to 25 percent of that sum, according to U.S. estimates,
although European officials place the amount at about half the total.
   Total trade between the United States and the EEC is estimated to
reach 166 billion dollars this year.
   Kingon reiterated the United States' intention to respond to the
ban by applying tariffs on certain products imported from European
countries.
   ``If they implement (the prohibition) on Jan. 1 as they say they
are going to do, then we will retaliate on Jan. 1,'' he said.
   The EEC has, in turn, vowed to counter the measures by slapping
duties on such U.S. imports as unshelled nuts, natural honey, dried
fruit and canned corn.
   Kingon told a news conference on Monday that the United States
was drawing up plans to strike back at those threats.
   In the interview, he denied that such actions would signal a
trade war between the trading partners.

<TEXT>
   The dollar fell Wednesday, giving back some of
the gains of recent days in light, uneventful trading.
   Gold prices rose slightly.
   The dollar's recent rise had been fueled partly by speculation
about strong demand by U.S. corporations that were repatriating
profits at the end of the year. The dollar dipped as that
speculation faded, said Heinz Bingelli of Merrill Lynch Capital
Markets.
   The market showed little reaction to a Commerce Department report
that U.S. personal income rose 0.6 percent in November and 0.8
percent in October after exclusion of special factors, about in line
with its recent trend.
   ``Fundamentally there was absolutely no news to push the market
one way or the other,'' said Hubert Pedroli, manager of corporate
foreign exchange for Credit Suisse in New York.
   In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 124.22 Japanese yen, down from
124.70 late Tuesday. In London late Wednesday, the dollar traded at
124.45 yen. Later in New York, the dollar fell to 124.55 yen from
125.33 yen late Tuesday.
   In London, the British pound fell to $1.8065 from $1.8070 on
Tuesday. But in New York, the pound's value of $1.8065 in late
trading was up from $1.7957 late Tuesday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Tuesday's late
rates, included: 1.7690 West German marks, down from 1.7803; 1.4945
Swiss francs, down from 1.5035; 1.1986 Canadian dollars, down from
1.2025; 6.0390 French francs, down from 6.0813; and 1,300.50 Italian
lire, down from 1,310.75.
   Other late rates in Europe, compared with Tuesday's late rates,
included: 1.7720 West German marks, down from 1.7750; 1.4980 Swiss
francs, down from 1.4995; 6.0500 French francs, down from 6.0675;
1.9920 Dutch guilders, down from 2.0080; 1,302.00 Italian lire, down
from 1,309.32; and 1.2012 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2000.
   Gold bullion prices rose after a series of falls linked to the
recent decline in platinum prices. One Swiss dealer said the price
rose as buying orders came in from U.S. customers.
   Gold closed in Hong Kong at a bid of $415.94 a troy ounce, up
from $415.67 an ounce on Tuesday.
   In London, the late bid for gold was $415.75 a troy ounce, up
from Tuesday's $414.25. The Zurich late bid was $414.60 an ounce, up
from $413.50.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery rose to $415.30 a troy ounce from $414 an ounce Tuesday.
   Later, Republic National Bank of New York said gold bullion was
bid at $415 an ounce as of 4 p.m. EST, up from $413.90 an ounce late
Tuesday.
   Silver bullion traded late in London at a bid of $6.14 a troy
ounce, up from Tesday's $6.11. On New York's Comex, silver bullion
for current delivery rose to $6.116 a troy ounce from $6.093 Tuesday.

   The stock market declined slightly in slackened
trading Wednesday as Wall Street's yearend rally sputtered for a
second straight session.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 6.61 on Tuesday,
slipped another 1.43 points to 2,164.64.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 6 to 5 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
659 up, 798 down and 556 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 147.25 million
shares, down from 161.09 million in the previous session.
Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 175.08 million shares.
   Analysts said traders began to sell Tuesday when the Dow Jones
industrials made a run past their 1988 closing high of 2,183.50,
reached on Oct. 21, but failed to hold the gain.
   That was widely regarded as a disappointing performance,
especially since the dollar and bonds both turned in strong showings.
   Since late November, the market has enjoyed a yearend rally led
by blue chips and stocks involved or rumored to be involved in
takeover plays.
   But many smaller ``secondary'' stocks have lagged behind,
apparently depressed by a lack of enthusiasm among individual
investors and selling for yearend tax purposes.
   Activity in the market is expected to dwindle further Thursday
and Friday as more and more participants get an early start on the
long Christmas weekend.
   Cummins Engine jumped 6 to 57] on intense takeover rumors and
speculation. The company declined comment on the activity.
   Fairchild Industries jumped 2] to 15}. An investment partnership
offered to acquire the company for $15.50 a share.
   Damon Corp. gained 3 to 25}. The company, which had previously
said it was talking merger with Nomad Partners L.P., disclosed that

   Americans' personal income rose strongly in
both November and October after adjusting to exclude distortions
from surges in farm subsidies and auto workers' bonuses, the
government said Wednesday.
   The Commerce Department said income fell a slight 0.2 percent in
November to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $4.18 trillion,
following a jump of 1.7 percent in October, the biggest in a year.
   But, excluding the two special factors that occurred in October,
personal income rose 0.6 percent in November and 0.8 percent in
October, both significantly stronger than the inflation rate.
   White House spokesman Roman Popadiuk said, ``Personal income
continues to rise at a healthy pace and in line with gains reported
over the past 12 months.''
   Personal consumption spending, which includes everything except
interest payments on debt, rose 0.6 percent to a seasonally adjusted
annual rate of $3.32 trillion last month after a robust 1.0 percent
gain in October.
   The numbers were in line with expectations and had little effect
on the financial markets. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones average of
30 industrials, down 6.61 on Tuesday, slipped another 1.43 points to
2,164.64. Bond prices and interest rates were little changed.
   ``It looks like 1988 is going out with a bang,'' said Robert
Brusca, an economist with Nikko Securities Co. International Inc. in
reference to the income and spending report.
   However, Brusca said the new statistics are likely to displease
the Federal Reserve Board, which has been raising interest rates in
an attempt to slow the economy. The Fed's goals are to slow
inflation and to ease domestic consumer demand so manufacturers can
produce enough exports to whittle the U.S. trade deficit.
   ``We are living beyond our means and in order to put that thing
(the trade deficit) back in place we're going to have to do much
better at living within our means,'' Brusca said. ``... Mr. Bush's
campaign song _ `Don't Worry, Be Happy' _ is still well in place.''
   With spending rising faster than income in November, the personal
savings rate _ savings as a percentage of after-tax income _ dipped
to 4.3 percent from 5.2 percent in October. Economists say one way
to curb the trade deficit is to increase Americans' saving.
   Disposable, or after-tax, income declined 0.3 percent in November
following a 1.7 percent gain a month earlier. It was the first
decline since April, when annual income tax payments depressed
personal income by 1.4 percent.
   Wages and salaries, key components of personal income, were up
0.4 percent to a $2.52 trillion annual rate in November following a
large 1.5 percent increase caused by bonuses to auto workers.
Manufacturing salaries edged down 0.5 percent after a 2.2 percent
increase in October.
   Sandra Shaber, an economist with the Futures Group, a Washington
consulting firm, said growth in the number of jobs rather than in
inflation-adjusted income accounts for most of the rising income.
   ``We've had a miraculous job-creation machine ... but on a
per-worker basis, the picture is not as bright. Many people in many
parts of the country are earning less in real terms,'' she said.
   Farm income, usually a volatile category, plunged 64.6 percent to
a yearly pace of $15.7 billion after soaring 62.9 percent in October.
   Personal interest income rose a strong 1.0 percent to an annual
rate of $601.1 billion in November, following an identical increase
a month earlier. Rising interest rates since this spring have cut
into the buying power of young families who borrow heavily, but
they've added to the income of older families saving for retirement.
   The biggest increase in spending last month was for durable goods
_ ``big ticket'' items expected to last three or more years. The
category rose 1.5 percent, followed by a 0.6 percent increase for
non-durable goods and a 0.3 percent rise in spending for services.
   John Hagens, an economist with The Wefa Group, a Bala Cynwyd,
Pa., forecasting firm, said the seasonally adjusted rise in spending
for services was unexpectedly weak. He speculated that the
government was not adjusting the figures sufficiently to exclude
normal shifts in buying patterns before the holidays.
   ``About this time of the year people are focusing attention on
purchases of goods because they can be distributed as Christmas
presents. You can't really give a service as a Christmas present,''
Hagens said.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   I.C.H. Corp. will spend $176 million to buy about
55 percent of Integrated Resources Inc., a financial services
company that owns Learjet Corp., under an agreement announced
Wednesday.
   I.C.H., of Louisville, Ky., is an insurance holding company with
$9 billion in assets. New York-based Integrated Resources is a
diversified financial services company whose businesses include
insurance.
   Under the deal, I.C.H. will buy 7.5 million shares in Integrated
Resources that are authorized but unissued, at a price of $21 a
share.
   I.C.H. also will buy 900,000 shares owned by three brothers of
the Zises family who run Integrated Resources: Selig, Jay and
Seymour. That price will also be $21 a share.
   None of the Integrated Resources stock held by general
shareholders is being bought. Integrated Resources stock fell $1 to
$13.50 a share on the New York Stock Exchange, while I.C.H. fell 37{
cents to $4.50 a share on the American Stock Exchange.
   Integrated Resources bought Learjet last year, acquiring a 65
percent stake from Gates Corp. for $57 million and obtaining the
rest of the Tucson, Ariz.-based maker of business jets through a
tender offer.
   Integrated Resources specializes in buying companies and then
syndicating them as private limited partnerships. Pieces of the
partnerships are sold to wealthy individuals and institutions in
minimum amounts of $50,000 to $100,000.
   Integrated Resources usually serves as the general partner in the
limited partnerships. After a few years the companies often are sold
again or taken public. Among other companies it has bought are
Viewmaster and Steve's Ice Cream.
   Selig Zises is board chairman and chief executive of Integrated
Resources; Jay Zises is chairman of the executive committee; and
Seymour Zises is a managing executive with Integrated's
broker-dealer subsidiary.
   The closing of the transaction is subject to a definitive
agreement and certain regulatory approvals.

<HEAD>Platinum Futures Rise Again; Further Gains Expected</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Platinum futures prices rose for a second straight day Wednesday
amid growing confidence that Ford Motor Co.'s new catalytic
converter will not substantially reduce demand for platinum for at
least the next several years.
   On other markets, coffee futures gained for the sixth consecutive
session; grains and soybeans were higher; cattle futures advanced
while pork futures were mixed; energy futures were mixed; and
stock-index futures retreated.
   Platinum settled $6.60 to $8.10 higher on the New York Mercantile
Exchange with the spot December contract at $542.40 a troy ounce and
the more active contract for delivery in January at $538.40 a troy
ounce.
   Spot platinum plunged from more than $600 to $510 an ounce last
Thursday after Ford announced it had developed an automobile
catalytic converter that did not use platinum. The use of platinum
as a catalyst in the pollution-control devices accounts for about
one-third of platinum consumption worldwide.
   Analysts linked Wednesday's rally to buying by bargain hunters
whose confidence was bolstered by statements from the London-based
platinum refiner Johnson Matthey PLC.
   Johnson Matthey, which helped Ford develop the new converter,
stood by its early-November projection of platinum supply shortfalls
in 1988 and ``over the next few years.''
   The world's largest platinum refiner cited the global tightening
of exhaust emission standards and the widespread use outside the
United States of leaded gasoline. Platinum is better than other
catalyst metals at cleaning up the exhaust produced by leaded
gasoline, Johnson Matthey said in a statement.
   Analysts expressed skepticism about the degree to which Ford has
developed its new technology for practical use.
   ``The impression I'm getting ... is that there are still a lot of
unanswered questions and it doesn't look like the technology is
going to be applied on a widespread basis anytime soon,'' said
Bernard Savaiko, metals analyst with PaineWebber Inc. in New York.
   He said January platinum probably could climb another $15 to $20
before encountering significant resistance.
   Peter Cardillo, commodities trading adviser with Josephthal & Co.
in New York, predicted platinum would rally even further, to $565 or
$570 an ounce.
   ``The market was obviously grossly oversold on the announcement
by Ford,'' he said. ``The supply situation has not changed and will
not change.''
   On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold settled $1.30 higher
across the board with February at $418.80 a troy ounce; silver was
1.8 cents to 2.3 cents higher with March at $6.23 a troy ounce.
   Coffee futures prices rose to new two-year highs on New York's
Coffee, Sugar & Cocoa Exchange but the gains were slight due to
heavy profit-taking earlier in the session.
   The bullish impact of poor weather in South America and Central
America has been exacerbated by a dockworkers' strike since Dec. 13
in Brazil, the world's largest coffee producer.
   ``We saw profit-taking today but the trend from here on out is
probably up,'' said Kim Badenhop, an analyst in New York with
Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.
   Coffee settled .07 cent to 5.06 cents higher with March at
$1.5594 a pound.
   Corn and soybean futures posted strong gains on the Chicago Board
of Trade amid a generally bullish outlook for export sales.
   After the close, the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced it
had targeted Morocco for sales of 1 million metric tons of U.S.
wheat at subsidized prices, a bullish development.
   But the USDA also said the Soviet Union had canceled a sale of
102,500 metric tons of U.S. soybean meal, a bearish development.
   Wheat settled } cent lower to 3\ cents higher with March at
$4.38} a bushel; corn was 4} cents to 6} cents higher with March at
$2.84} a bushel; oats were 4 cents to 4} cents higher with March at
$2.32{ a bushel; soybeans were 4 cents to 11 cents higher with
January at $7.95{ a bushel.
   Cattle futures advanced on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange in a
technically inspired rally while pork futures finished mixed.
   After the close, the USDA released its monthly cold-storage
report pegging supplies of frozen pork bellies on Nov. 30 at a
record-high 95.75 million pounds. Pork belly futures were expected
to open sharply lower Thursday in reaction to the report.
   Live cattle settled .25 cent to .50 cent higher with February at
73.80 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .20 cent to .45 cent higher
with January at 84.17 cents a pound; live hogs were .35 cent lower
to .35 cent higher with February at 46.62 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .03 cent to .35 cent lower with February at 45.17 cents

   In energy futures trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange,
West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 2 cents to 15 cents higher
with February at $16.30 a barrel; heating oil was .06 cent to .45

was .10 cent lower to .15 cent higher with January at 45.70 cents a

   Stock-index futures dipped on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange,
where the contract for March delivery of the Standard & Poor's 500
settled .85 point lower at 280.45. Each point is worth $500.

   Cummins Engine Co. Inc. suspended trading
in its stock nearly an hour early Wednesday amid heavy speculation
about a possible buyout attempt sent its stock surging higher.
   Cummins was up $6 to $57.37{ a share on the New York Stock
Exchange in unusually heavy trading of more than 1.15 million
shares. The jump came on top of a $2.25 a share gain during
Tuesday's session.
   In a generally light market Wednesday, nearly 10 percent of
Cummins outstanding shares were traded.
   Cummins said it had been notified by a representative of
Rothschild Inc. of New York that a client of that firm has acquired
more than 5 percent of the company's stock and that a formal
announcement of the purchase will be made late next week.
   The identity of the shareholder was not disclosed, the company
said. Cummins also said it was told the shares had been acquired for
investment only and that it could not account for the unusually
heavy trading volume and rise in its stock price.
   There have been unconfirmed market rumors that West Germany's
Daimler-Benz AG might be interested in acquiring Cummins, which is
based in Columbus.
   After trading was halted 57 minutes early, the diesel engine
maker also announced it would take a fourth-quarter charge against
earnings of about $50 million. The charge will relate mainly to
discontinuation and write-down of assets of unprofitable operations.
   In its fourth quarter last year, Cummins posted a loss of $4.4
million on sales of $754.3 million.

<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court has ordered the
Transportation Department to award the Seattle-Tokyo air route to
Continental Airlines in the latest round of a 2-year-old battle
among three of the nation's largest airlines over the lucrative
route.
   A little more than a month ago, the department decided to ignore
an earlier appeals court decision and award the route to United
Airlines.
   The U.S. Court of Appeals, in a brief decision late Tuesday,
again ruled that the department had violated various deadlines in
awarding the route and overstepped its authority in giving the route
to United.
   ``We cannot countenance the creative use of procedural mechanisms
to evade either our order or the FAA's (Federal Aviation
Administration) review deadlines,'' the court said, adding that the
department had engaged in a ``thinly disguised attempt to circumvent
the decision of this court.''
   The court had found in September that Continental should receive
the route, but the department had decided to once again review the
case.
   At various times over the past two years, administrative law
judges and top department officials have awarded the route to
Continental, United and American Airlines.
   The route generates more than $100 million in revenue annually.
   Hal Paris, a DOT spokesman, said the department would have no
immediate comment on the latest court order.
   ``We haven't seen the decision yet and will have to review it
before commenting,'' said Paris.
   Art Kent, a Continental spokesman in Houston, said his airline
was ``delighted'' with the ruling.
   ``As far as we are concerned, the Court of Appeals ruling brings
this matter to a close and we will begin our planning to institute
our service on the route sometime next year,'' said Kent.
   Kent said it was too soon to say when Continental may begin
actual flights between Seattle and Tokyo.
   The airline has said previously it would offer one-way
Seattle-Tokyo fares as low as $299.
   A United spokesman in Chicago said the court's decision was based
on ``what amounts to a legal technicality'' and that an appeal was
possible.
   ``United will act swiftly to review all options available and
will take prompt action to protect the interests of our customers,
the communities we serve, the traveling public and our own
employees,'' said Rob Doughty.
   United has been flying the route since 1986 when it purchased Pan
American World Airways' Pacific division, but DOT approved the
purchase only on the condition that the route be dealt with in a
separate proceeding.
   Both Northwest Airlines and Japan Air Lines also fly non-stop
between Seattle and Tokyo.

<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Mario Cuomo on Wednesday signed into law
a bill allowing New York corporations to use ``poison pill''
takeover defenses to fight hostile takeover bids.
   The new law is designed to undo, until April 1, 1989, the state
Supreme Court's ruling earlier this year that a poison pill Irving
Bank Corp. tried to use to thwart a hostile takeover by Bank of New
York Co. was illegal.
   The court decided New York state law prohibits the inequitable
treatment of shareholders, and ruled the Irving pill created such a
condition. The decision cleared the way for Bank of New York's
acquisition.
   A typical poison pill gives existing shareholders the right to
buy additional stock in a company once an outside concern acquires a
certain amount of the company's shares. That increases the number of
shares a hostile buyer must to acquire to take over the company,
making a hostile bid prohibitively expensive.
   A special task force is studying the use of such defensive
measures and will report to the state Legislature in early spring.
At that point, the Legislature and Cuomo either can make the new law
permanent or let it expire.
   Both houses of the Legislature approved the bill unanimously last
week.

   Duncan said borrowers should continue making loan payments to the

<TEXT>
   The 74-year-old maker of Heath
chocolate-toffee bars is being sold to a Finnish-owned candy company
that markets Milk Duds and Clark bars, a spokesman announced
Wednesday.
   Leaf Inc., which also markets Whoppers and other candy and
chewing gum products, will purchase L.S. Heath & Sons Candy Co. in
January, Leaf announced. Terms of the sale were not disclosed.
   Joel Feldstein of the N.W. Ayer public relations company in
Chicago said Leaf bought 49 percent of Robinson-based Heath's stock
a year ago and would complete the purchase next month. Leaf is based
in Bannockburn, Ill., in suburban Chicago.
   Heath, a family-operated company, produced the first Heath bar in
1914, although the candy did not become a national product until
1938, said Feldstein. Today, Heath is one of the 25 biggest-selling
candy bars in the United States, he said.
   James A. Hanlon, president of Leaf's North American operations,
said the purchase of Heath reflected Leaf's strategy of acquiring
and building strong, well-known candy and gum brands, according to
Feldstein.
   He said the Heath plant employs about 350 people. It also makes
Heath ice cream bars, the Bit O' Brickle candybar and baking toffee.
   Leaf is owned by Huhtamaki of Helsinki, Finland. It has 3,000
employees in 12 plants in North America as well as 1,500 in
factories in Europe and China, said Feldstein.

<HEAD>Fruehauf Plans Restructuring After Inconclusive Sales Talks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM S. BERGSTROM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fruehauf Corp. said Wednesday it would propose a
restructuring after talks on the sale of all or part of the
truck-trailer and auto parts manufacturer proved inconclusive.
   Fruehauf will file documents with the Securities and Exchange
Commission within the next two weeks detailing a recapitalization
proposal that would defer some debt and increase cash available for
operations, spokesman David A. Hladik said.
   Fruehauf has battled large debts, high interest payments and
operating losses since its managers dodged a hostile takeover
attempt by taking control of the company in a leveraged buyout in
December 1986.
   The firm employs 15,800 people and manufactures truck trailers,
auto parts and maritime refinishing products. Its Kelsey Hayes
subsidiary is a leading supplier of antilock braking systems.
   ``The goal is to make it a stronger company at this point,''
Hladik said. ``We're still in debt and we're still pursuing trying
to sell off the Kelsey Hayes operation.''
   In October, Toronto-based Varity Corp. ended talks to buy
Fruehauf, saying only that the halt followed a review of Fruehauf's
records and assets.
   Fruehauf said in a news release Wednesday it would continue to
explore any alternatives presented to it, but that there was no
assurance any would be presented.
   The company said it has $200 million worth of 13.5 percent senior
subordinated notes due in 1996 and $310 million in 13.75 percent
senior subordinated debentures due in 2001.
   It proposes to exchange for those a package of securities
including 15.5 percent discount debentures due in 2001, 14.5 percent
priority senior subordinated debentures due in 2001, and its Class B
common stock.
   The 1986 buyout, arranged to dodge a takeover bid by New York
investor Asher Edelman, resulted in more than $1 billion in new debt.
   To help cut the debt, Fruehauf since has sold assets such as its
U.S. and European trailer rental operations, a finance subsidiary
and aerospace and other operations. In 1987, it reduced overall debt
from $1.4 billion to $870 million.

<TEXT>
   ``Drexel is like a god,'' an awed competitor said
in 1986.
   At the height of its power, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. bestrode
the financial world like a colossus, using its money-raising power
to finance everything from nursery school chains to corporate
takeovers.
   On Wednesday, the colossus dropped to its knees, legally if not
financially. Drexel agreed to plead guilty to six federal felony
counts and pay a record $650 million fine to settle the biggest Wall
Street securities fraud case in history.
   The deal requires approval of the Securities and Exchange
Commission and senior Justice Department officials.
   Drexel's power came from its exploitation of an area of finance
that other investment bankers had ignored, either because of lack of
imagination or lack of appetite for risk.
   Drexel helped clients raise large amounts of money quickly by
issuing bonds that were riskier than investment-grade securities and
hence paid higher yields.
   The securities quickly became known as junk bonds, to the dismay
of Drexel and Michael Milken, the brilliant strategist who helped
pioneer them.
   In spite of its upstart image, Drexel was not a newcomer to Wall
Street. It traces its roots to the founding of Burnham & Co. in
1935. Drexel Firestone, which Burnham acquired in 1973, goes back to
the 1830s and once counted J.P. Morgan among its partners.
   Drexel was a second-tier investment bank, though, until the
mid-1970s, when it came up with the concept of selling junk bonds as
original issues.
   Until then, the only junk bonds were securities that had
originally been issued with a higher rating but whose issuers had
fallen on hard times.
   Drexel worked both sides of the deal, lining up investors who
were attracted by the bonds' attractive yields and grateful issuers
who had never before been able to raise money in the bond market.
   Frederick H. Joseph, now Drexel's chief executive, was then head
of corporate finance, leading underwriting efforts.
   Milken led Drexel's junk-bond trading operation and moved it to
Beverly Hills, Calif., from New York in 1977.
   Drexel's biggest break came in the early 1980s, when it hit on
the idea of using junk bonds to finance corporate takeovers. That
idea vaulted it to the front ranks of investment banks and
revolutionized the mergers and acquisitions business.
   Corporate raiders such as Carl Icahn, Sir James Goldsmith, Saul
Steinberg and T. Boone Pickens Jr. established close relations with
Drexel, as did stock speculators such as Ivan Boesky.
   Among the companies taken over with the help of junk bonds
floated by Drexel were TWA Inc. and Crown Zellerbach Corp. Drexel is
also playing a major role in financing Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &
Co.'s $24.5 billion buyout of RJR Nabisco Inc.
   ``Drexel is like a god in that end of the business and a god can
to anything it wants. ... They are awesome. You hate to do business
against them,'' Michael Boylan, the president of Macfadden Holdings,
told Barron's magazine in 1986.
   Drexel liked the quote so much that one of its investment bankers
framed it, Connie Bruck recounts in a book published this year,
``The Predators' Ball.''
   Drexel earned enormous fees for underwriting and trading junk
bonds and for its takeover advice.
   Drexel's capital as of Dec. 31, 1987, totaled nearly $2.2
billion, up from $1.8 billion the previous year and up more than
tenfold from 1981. That made the privately held company the fifth
largest firm on Wall Street.
   Although Drexel still is the dominant player in junk bonds, the
market's rapid growth has drawn competition from other investment
banks.
   Drexel's influence in the takeover game began to diminish
somewhat amid the insider-trading scandal on Wall Street, which
erupted with the arrest of a Drexel investment banker, Dennis R.
Levine, and then led to a government investigation of Drexel's
tactics.
   Still, Drexel has denied suggestions that the probe severely
impaired the firm, claiming its junk bond business and its other
investment banking operations remained strong.
   As recently as Wednesday, before Drexel's agreement to plead
guilty, Southland Corp., the parent company of 7-Eleven convenience
stores, announced it had switched its investment banking business to
Drexel, dumping the prestigious investment banking firms of Goldman,
Sachs & Co. and Salomon Brothers Inc.

<HEAD>President Accepts Resignation of State Oil Company Head</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of Brazil's state-run oil
monopoly Petrobras resigned Wednesday, the day after the resignation
of the Mines and Energy minister.
   Armando Guedes Coelho, who had headed Petrobras since June, said
in a letter to President Jose Sarney that his resignation was
unrelated to an internal financial scandal rocking the oil concern.
   Guedes' resignation from the presidency of the Petrobras oil
company had been expected since late last week.
   No substitute has yet been named to replace Guedes, who was
personally chosen to head the oil monopoly by Mines and Energy
minister Aureliano Chaves, the presidential palace said. Chaves
resigned Tuesday amid press reports speculating that he hoped to
become a full-time presidential candidate for the 1989 elections.
   ``I never expected to continue in my post through the end of
Sarney's mandate,'' Guedes told the Gazeta Mercantil newspaper
earlier this week. ``I was chosen by Chaves and I will leave with
him. It is unfortunate the two events must coincide''
   Petrobras has been rocked by financial scandal in which two
directors last week were removed from their jobs after allegedly
receiving kickbacks from banks in return for company accounts in
those financial institutions.
   Federal police were to decide later this week whether to open a
police enquiry based upon a Petrobras report that discovered
``evidences'' and ``indications'' of wrongdoing by the Petrobras
officials.

<TEXT>
   Tenneco Inc. said Wednesday it closed the $590
million sale of its Chalmette, La., refinery to Mobil Corp.,
completing the sale of its Tenneco Oil Co. holdings.
   The refinery sale, which includes $30 million in working capital,
is part of a $7.3 billion divestiture designed to pay for Tenneco's
repurchase of 20.9 million shares of its stock and pay down the
company's outstanding debt.
   Net proceeds from all oil company sales after taxes and expenses
are expected to total $6.4 billion, Tenneco said.
   ``When we announced the sale in October, we had expected to close
all the parts of the total package by the end of the year, and we
have accomplished that goal,'' said Tenneco spokeswoman M.A. Shute.
``The overall sale has gone well and according to expectations.''
   Tenneco, a diversified corporation with major interests in
natural gas pipelines, farm and construction equipment, automotive
parts and chemicals, was the nation's 10th largest oil company when
it announced the results of bidding two months ago.
   The success of that sale at a time the industry is suffering
depressed oil prices surprised many analysts, who had predicted the
holdings would fetch between $5 billion and $7 billion.
   Analysts said the ability to package the oil company holdings
apparently helped boost the price for Tenneco, which had about $8.5
billion in outstanding debt when it announced the sale.
   Other companies that have bought chunks of Tenneco Oil included
Chevron Corp., which purchased Tenneco's Gulf of Mexico oil and
natural gas reserves, production facilities and lease interests for
nearly $2.6 billion.
   Texas oilman T. Boone Pickens' Mesa Limited Partnership bought
the mid-continent division oil and gas subsidiary for $715 million
cash.
   Shell Petroleum Co. Ltd., part of the Royal Dutch-Shell Group,
bought Tenneco's Colombian operations for $500 million, and British
Gas PLC spent $194.5 million on a variety of Tenneco's international
oil and gas interests.
   In a separate move, Tenneco has put its 1,900-mile Louisiana
Intrastate Gas Corp. pipeline and related facilities up for sale.
Ms. Shute said Wednesday that sale is pending.
   The pipeline was purchased from Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. for
$456 million in 1985.

<TEXT>
   South Korea's trade policy council has
agreed to plan and implement by early next year detailed measures
for slashing the nation's trade surplus with the United States and
easing trade friction, according to news reports Thursday.
   The South Korean news agency Yonhap said the International

actions'' to avoid being designated an unfair trading partner under
the new U.S. trade act.
   It did not say by how much the council hoped to reduce the
surplus.
   South Korea's trade surplus with the United States was $10
billion in 1987 and was expected to fall to between $8 billion and
$9 billion this year.
   Yonhap said the council, chaired by Deputy Prime Minister and
Economic Planning Minister Cho Soon, also decided to expedite
resolution of trade issues still pending between the two countries.
   Issues pending include imports of U.S. wine, direct distribution
of movies and protection of U.S. intellectual property rights.
Yonhap said the council agreed to complete a plan for the
unrestricted import of U.S. agricultural products by the end of the
year.
