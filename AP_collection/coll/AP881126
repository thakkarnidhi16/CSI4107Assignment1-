<HEAD>Research Group Urges Bush To Sharply Cut Farm Aid</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President-elect George Bush should make a top
priority of slashing aid to farmers, particularly those subsidies
that reward farmers for high production, the conservative Heritage
Foundation think tank said.
   The report said farmers are generally better off than commonly
believed and should be forced to operate in a more competitive
environment with fewer government handouts.
   The Bush administration should develop a farm policy that would
``help American farmers break out (of a) cycle of dependence'' on
federal subsidies, Charles Grizzle wrote in the Heritage
Foundation's forthcoming policy guidebook.
   Grizzle, a former senior official in the Agriculture Department,
said the key to weaning farmers from government aid is to
``decouple'' subsidy programs from production requirements.
   The idea of decoupling has been around for a while but has not
taken hold on Capitol Hill. As Grizzle sees it, government payments
to farmers would be based on a flat rate and targeted to those most
in need of help.
   Congress and the next administration will have no choice but to
deal with the subsidy issue, since the 1985 farm law will expire in
1990. According to Agriculture Department finance officers, farm
subsidies rose to a record $25.8 billion in 1986, the first year of
the new law, from $17.7 billion in 1985.
   ``Despite the media portrayal of the typical farmer as
hard-pressed, farm families have had higher incomes than the median
American family in every year since 1980,'' Grizzle said. ``More
important, the net worth of farm families far exceeds that of the
American family.''
   With few exceptions, he said, the farmers and rural bankers who
went broke during the hard times of the early 1980s, or who remain
under financial stress today, are those who borrowed and invested
heavily in ``get-rich-quick speculative fever'' of the 1970s.
   ``They bet on rapidly inflating land values _ and bet wrong,''
Grizzle said. ``It is unfair to force the taxpayers to pick up the
tab.''
   Earlier this week, outgoing Budget Director Joseph R. Wright said
in an interview that farm subsidies will be a principal place that
President Reagan will look for savings in his effort to avert tax
and deficit increases.
   Bush, vacationing in Kennebunkport, Maine, turned aside
reporters' questions about areas where he will seek budget cuts.
   Robert A. Denman, director of international and public affairs of
the National Farmers Union, said he wasn't surprised by the Heritage
Foundation's blueprint because ``it's the same thing they're always
talking about'' when it comes to farm policy.
   ``If George Bush is really thinking about running a kinder,
gentler administration, I have an idea he'll probably reject a lot
that's in that report,'' Denman said in an interview. ``Now, if he
doesn't, I think it could be just exactly like what happened to the
last report (by the foundation) _ the Congress will probably reject
most of it.''
   But if lawmakers accept the Heritage Foundation's view, there
would be ``a period of economic and social chaos for rural
America,'' he said.
   Grizzle's chapter on agriculture is just part of the 953-page
volume, ``Mandate for Leadership III,'' scheduled for publication on
Jan. 2, the third in a series of policy guidebooks published by the
foundation. Others were published after Reagan's election in 1980
and again in 1984.
   For more than half a century, the principle of farm subsidies has
been pegged to production _ the larger the farm, the larger the
payments.
   ``Planting decisions would then be based on market signals _
consumer demand for a product _ rather than on what is required by
Washington,'' said Grizzle, a former deputy assistant secretary for
administration at the Agriculture Department.
   Grizzle wrote also that the incoming administration should wean
farmers from dependence on disaster aid by requiring them to take
out federally guaranteed or entirely private crop insurance in order
to qualify for federal subsidy programs or loans.
   When natural disasters struck in the past, including this year's
heat and drought, farmers turned to the U.S. Treasury, making
taxpayers foot the bill, Grizzle said.

   A man who assumed multiple
personalities under hypnosis while on trial for the slaying of his
19-year-old daughter was convicted Friday of first-degree murder.
   Thomas Lee Bonney pleaded innocent by reason of insanity in the
death of Kathy Carol Bonney, whose nude body was shot 27 times and
dumped last November at the Dismal Swamp Canal, just inside North
Carolina's border with Virginia.
   Bonney, 45, of Chesapeake, Va., revealed the personas of
``Satan,'' his dead grandmother and three other of his 10
personalities in videotaped interviews with Dr. Paul F. Dell, a
psyuchiatrist retained by the defense.
   ``You're just a mortal,'' Bonney growled during one session under
hypnosis with Dell, a professor at Norfolk's Eastern Virginia
Medical School. ``You don't know nothing.''
   
   The jury began deliberations at late Friday afternoon after
hearing six hours of closing arguments and three weeks of testimony.

<TEXT>
   Former Mayor Jack Reardon, who underwent
a heart transplant nearly two years ago, died Friday of heart
failure. He was 45.
   Reardon entered the University of Kansas Medical Center
complaining of dizziness and shortness of breath early Friday, and
doctors implanted a pacemaker, said Mary Harrison, a hospital
spokeswoman. Reardon died about 6:50 p.m., she said, adding that
doctors hope to learn more through tests about the underlying cause
of death.
   Reardon was serving as mayor when he received a new heart on Feb.
18, 1987, at the medical center. He had suffered from
cardiomyopathy, which results in inadequate pumping ability.
   Reardon, a Democrat, served 12 years as mayor before losing the
general election in April 1987 to Joseph Steineger. Reardon said he
believed his health was a factor in his loss.
   Earlier this month, Reardon was elected to the Wyandotte County
Commission after being unopposed in the general election.
   Except for the 1987 mayoral election, Reardon's only election
defeat occurred during an ill-fated bid for Congress in 1984. He
lost to Jan Meyers.
   As mayor, the often-controversial Reardon worked diligently to
bring new economic development to Kansas City, Kan., a largely
blue-collar town with an aging and declining industrial base.
   One of Reardon's biggest accomplishments was the years of
negotiations he held with General Motors, which eventually led to
the carmaker's commitment to build a new auto plant in the city.
   In an interview one year after receiving his new heart, Reardon
described the transplant as ``a humbling experience in many ways.
It's not something you think about constantly, but it is something
you're aware of on a daily basis and it is amazing.''
   Reardon is survived by his wife, Helen, and a son and a daughter.

<TEXT>
   A love letter that a soldier wrote to his
wife while he was being shipped overseas during World War II was
finally opened 44 years later by his daughter.
   ``It was a love letter from my father to my mother,'' said Karan
Johnson of Fresno, who opened the letter Thursday at the family's
Thanksgiving celebration.
   Because of a careless crew member, the letter Master Sgt. Morris
Johnson penned in May 1944 never reached his wife, Roberta. The
couple has since died.
   ``There are some fun things about the letter,'' said Ms. Johnson.
``His handwriting was so much better then. And opening it was
emotional.''
   ``It was very sweet. My father asked about the baby _ my older
brother Warren, had been born a month before _ and my father said
how much he missed the baby and how much he missed my mother,'' she
said.
   Johnson wrote the letter while aboard the USS Caleb Strong, which
was taking him and other servicemen to Algeria. A crew member was
supposed to mail 235 letters written by 92 soldiers when he got back
to the United States.
   But in 1986, a pest exterminator found the duffel bag full of
letters in an attic in Raleigh, N.C.
   James Althoff, president of the 781st Bomb Squadron Association,
spent two years trying to match the wayward letters with their
recipients. The association delivered all but eight of the letters.
   Finding Johnson's relatives was difficult because there was no
forwarding address for the family's San Francisco address. Althoff
finally learned from the Veterans Administration that Johnson, a
pharmacist, had died in 1966 and his death certificate listed a
Fresno address. Further digging led to the discovery of Karan
Johnson and delivery of the letter on Sept. 27.
   Ms. Johnson said her brother, who was on hand for the letter
opening, was excited about the contents.
   ``When my brother was in Vietnam, he was about the same age as my
father when he wrote the letter to my mother,'' she said. ``He said
he remembered writing the same type of letter to his wife.''
   ``It had a very sweet P.S. It said, `Dear Warren: Take care of
your mommy and I'll be around to check on you when I can.' ''

<TEXT>
   The next space shuttle
landing in California could take place a week from Sunday, but there
will be no public viewing because Atlantis' military mission is
classified, NASA said.
   ``This is pretty standard policy on Department of Defense
flights,'' said Nancy Lovato, a spokeswoman for the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration at this Mojave Desert military
base 70 miles north of Los Angeles.
   But she noted Friday that NASA and the Air Force may reconsider
the policy for subsequent classified shuttle flights. More than
400,000 spectators gathered on the dry lake bed in October to see
the landing of shuttle Discovery, the first shuttle flight since the
1986 Challenger explosion.
   Atlantis is scheduled to blast off from Cape Canaveral, Fla.,
sometime between 6:32 a.m. and 9:32 a.m. EST on Dec. 1, although the
precise time won't be announced until nine minutes before the
launch. Sources have said the launch is set for 7 a.m. EST.
   The mission is expected to last three or four days, which would
mean Atlantis would land on the hard-packed clay surface of Rogers
Dry Lake on Dec. 4 or 5, assuming rain doesn't turn the lake bed to
mud and force a landing at Cape Canaveral, Fla., or White Sands,
N.M. But NASA won't announce the landing time until 24 hours
beforehand.
   While the mission's purpose is secret, sources have said Atlantis
and its five astronauts will place into orbit a satellite to spy on
the Soviet Union.
   ``Access to Edwards Air Force Base will be restricted to official
business only during landing operations,'' a NASA statement said.
``There will be no guest access, nor will usual NASA tours be held
during that period.''
   Lovato said that while reporters and photographers will be
allowed to cover the landing if they obtain NASA credentials, news
briefings customarily held on the day of and after the landing will
not be conducted.

<HEAD>Hormone Found in Diabetics May Play Role in Disease, Researcher
Says</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Further study of a newly isolated hormone found
in the pancreases of diabetics may lead to new treatments for the
most common form of the disease, a scientist says.
   ``We have a lot of evidence that this is likely to be, if not the
final cause, at least a major part of the disease process,'' said
New Zealand biochemist Garth Cooper.
   The research ``opens the door to the scientific study of the
disease at a level that wasn't possible before and potentially the
mechanisms that we uncover may be very wide ranging,'' he said.
   Cooper, who has been working with scientists at Oxford
University, described the hormone research this week at the 13th
International Diabetes Federation Congress in Sydney, Australia.
   In his presentation, Cooper said the hormone, dubbed ``amylin,''
was normally undetectable but found in high levels in the pancreases
of diabetics.
   Amylin appears to be responsible for the obesity, reduced insulin
secretion and the reduced effectiveness of insulin observed in Type
II diabetes, he said. Currently, obesity is considered a major
contributor to the disease rather than a result of it.
   Insulin normally controls the level of blood sugar. In Type II
diabetes, also called non-insulin-dependent diabetes, the body's
insulin is not effective and blood sugar levels rise too high.
   Complications can include kidney disease, blindness, and gangrene
that requires amputations.
   Type II diabetes afflicts the majority of the nation's estimated
11 million diabetics, according to the American Diabetes
Association. It often can be controlled through diet and exercise.
   Cooper said researchers hope to develop substances that block
amylin's secretion or action, opening the possibility of treatment.
He also said reseachers hope to develop a test to detect diabetes
very early in its development.
   The new work is ``a very important finding'' if amylin truly
blocks insulin and appears in abnormal amounts in diabetics, F.
Xavier Pi-Sunyer, an authority on Type II diabetes, said Friday.
   Scientists already knew of another pancreatic hormone that blocks
insulin, but it is not found in abnormal levels in diabetics, said
Pi-Sunyer, director of the endocrinology, diabetes and nutrition
division at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center in New York.

<TEXT>
   A newborn girl found wrapped in
newspapers in a hotel lobby received a new home for the Thanksgiving
holidays on Friday, but officials said the move might only be
temporary.
   A state social worker picked up the infant at the hospital Friday
morning to take her to unidentified foster parents, Bluefield
Community Hospital nursing supervisor Lisa Williams said.
   Callers from as far away as Georgia and New York, wanting to
adopt the baby or to donate gifts, continued to telephone the
hospital even after she was gone, Williams said.
   Publicity about the infant's ordeal led to such intense reation
that hospital officials did their best to transfer the girl to her
foster parents without the accompaniment of television cameras and
reporters.
   ``We kept it very, very quiet,'' Williams said.
   The abandoned child was called ``Baby Girl Doe'' by police, but
hospital workers renamed her ``Emily Robin'' or ``Holly Lynn,''
after the Holiday Inn where she was discovered Nov. 19.
   The Department of Human Services this week got court permission
to transfer the baby to a foster home. Hospital social services
director Jane Hood said the infant won't have a legal name until she
is adopted.
   The 6-pound, 9-ounce infant was less than two hours old when a
hotel worker who heard crying found her in a cardboard box tucked
beneath a hallway heating unit.
   The child, bleeding from her umbilical cord, was taken to the
hospital where she was treated for hypothermia.
   Bluefield Police Chief James Dent said his department has several
leads but still has not located the child's mother.
   ``We're not on a witch hunt for the mother to crucify her,'' Dent
said. He said it would be up to the Mercer County prosecutor to
decide whether charges should be filed, depending upon the mother's
reasons for abandoning the infant.
   One of the newspapers the infant was wrapped in came from
Christianburg, Va., Dent said. Bluefield sits on southern West
Virginia's border with Virginia.

   Hungary has agreed to exchange
ambassadors with Albania for the first time since Albania and the
Soviet bloc scaled back diplomatic ties in the 1960s, Hungary's
official news agency said.
   The MTI agency made the announcement Friday in a one-sentence
report.
   Albania agreed in May to exchange ambassadors with East Germany
and in August to exchange ambassadors with Bulgaria.
   In New York for the U.N. General Assembly last month, Albanian
Foreign Minister Reis Malile met his counterparts from Hungary,
Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, East Germany, Poland and China.
   The Albanian rapprochement with the Soviet bloc has occurred
without any apparent change of attitude to the Soviet Union, with
which Albania severed all ties in 1961.
   Albania has had ties on the charge d'affaires level with most
other Soviet bloc nations.

<HEAD>FCC Delays Decision On Proposed Change In Phone Rate Rules</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government has postponed until January
consideration of a plan to stop regulating long-distance telephone
profits in favor of capping rate increases, a Federal Communications
Commission official said.
   James Schlichting, an aide to FCC chairman Dennis R. Patrick,
said Patrick had hoped for a vote on the proposal next month, but a
consensus among the commissioners eluded him.
   ``There are so many complex issues and a long draft order, we
wanted to give commissioners an additional opportunity to study the
issues and consider it in January,'' said Schlichting.
   That meeting is scheduled for Jan. 19.
   The decision to delay consideration of the proposal also
recognizes opposition in Congress, he said. Key members have said
the already bad relations between Congress and the FCC will be
worsened considerably if the agency adopts the proposal before
lawmakers return to Capitol Hill in early January.
   On Wednesday, the Democratic staff of the House Energy and
Commerce telecommunications subcommittee sent the FCC a report
concluding that the agency is without legal authority to switch from
profit regulation to price caps. The report claims the law requires
that phone rates be based on the cost of providing service.
   The proposal would lift limits on the profits that American
Telephone & Telegraph Co. and the regional Bell phone companies can
earn on the interstate long-distance portions of their businesses.
Instead, the commission would set a ceiling on rates, limiting
increases to 3 percentage points less than annual inflation. Under
the plan, phone companies could choose to stay with the current
rate-of-return regulation or switch to price caps.
   A 380-page revision of the plan is being circulated among
commissioners. It proposes to implement the plan in April only for
AT&T and to submit the issue of rate caps for the Bell operating
companies to further study, according to sources who spoke on
condition of anonymity.

<HEAD>Home Sales Down In October Despite Falling Loan Rates</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Home sales fell in October for the second
straight month even though lenders were offering lower mortgage
rates, a real estate trade group said.
   Sales of existing single-family homes fell to a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of 3.63 million units last month, down 1.1
percent from the September sales rate, the National Association of
Realtors said Friday.
   It was the third month out of the last four in which sales
declined. They dropped an identical 1.1 percent in September and a
striking 4.5 percent in July.
   ``The summer rush is over and despite the window of opportunity
afforded by low mortgage rates in October, the surge of home sales
we saw earlier has run its course,'' said John Tuccillo, the group's
chief economist. ``But the good news is that the sales rate has
settled in at a strong level.''
   Fixed-rate mortgages in some parts of the country edged below 10
percent in October.
   Analysts said the latest drop in sales of existing homes, coupled
with a 7.8 percent September drop in new home sales, reflected a
slowing of the national economy.
   While they did not predict a severe slump in the housing
industry, economists said the downward trend is likely to continue,
especially in view of forecasts that mortgage rates will turn higher.
   The rate on 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages rose to 10.39 percent
this week, the highest level since early October, the Federal Home
Loan Mortgage Corp. reported Friday.
   Many economists believe fixed-rate mortgages will top 11 percent
by early next year.
   David Wyss, chief financial economist with Data Resources Inc.,
said that while rising mortgages would continue to dampen demand,
the market for single-family homes should hold steady through the
next year.
   The decline in sales was accompanied by a small drop in prices.
The median cost of an existing home sold in October was $88,100,
down $100 from the September level. However, the price was still 4.1
percent higher than a year ago, when the median home price was
$84,600.

<TEXT>
   Researchers say Holocaust survivors who
suppressed their memories of Nazi death camps handled the trauma
better than those who talked openly about the experience.
   ``Many survivors feel obligated to remember the Holocaust,'' said
Peretz Lavie, a psychologist at the Haifa institution and supervisor
of a new study. ``We're saying it may be better to help them forget
about it.''
   Lavie said the findings challenge current treatment practices for
Holocaust survivors and other trauma victims.
   The study conducted by the Israel Institute of Technology's sleep
laboratory suggests that pressure on Holocaust survivors to recall
their experiences frequently contributed to postwar emotional
problems.
   The 23 participants were divided into two groups, one including
survivors who suffered emotional problems and the other of those who
adjusted well.
   Lavie said better-adjusted survivors did not talk about the
Holocaust during waking hours and suffered fewer nightmares and
sleep disturbances than the group with more severe problems.
   He noted that in Israel there is constant pressure not to forget
the 6 million Jews who died in Nazi death camps.
   ``We don't want to suppress what happened in the Holocaust,''
Lavie told The Associated Press. ``But for these people it was
essential not to think about it in the face of the constant
reminders. They simply cut themselves off from the memories.''
   He said some participants told him the importance Israelis place
on remembering the Holocaust often made them feel guilty about
denying their bad experiences.
   Hanna Kaminer, a doctoral student who devised the study, said
``Denial seems to have been a better way for these people to adjust
in the long run. The more adjusted the individuals were, the more
they suppressed their memories.
   Ms. Kaminer said some survivors would not tell even close friends
and relatives of their concentration camp experiences. One subject
waited until his son's 21st birthday to tell him he was a death camp
prisoner.
   The study questions theories that trauma victims who do not talk
about their bad experiences likely will suffer from sleep disorders,
including nightmares and insomnia.
   Participants spent five nights in the sleep lab, where
researchers repeatedly woke them to question them about their dreams.
   Kaminer said better-adjusted survivors reported dreaming about
routine experiences, while the ill-coping subjects more often
dreamed of the camps.
   One reported vivid dreams of the selection process at the
Auschwitz concentration camp, where Nazi guards decided who would go
to the gas chambers.
   ``Until now, treatment has concentrated on talking about the
things that frightened survivors,'' Ms. Kaminer said. ``Now we see
it's probably better to do the opposite.''
   Lavie said, ``There probably is a time when they will feel more
comfortable talking about it. But for some, 40 years isn't enough
time.''

   The State Department is welcoming the decision
of the South African government not to send African National
Congress Leader Nelson Mandela back to prison after his treatment
for tuberculosis at a private clinic is concluded.
   The government said that Mandela, who has spent 26 years in
prison, will be transferred to some form of house arrest.
   ``From a humanitarian standpoint, this is a commendable
gesture,'' State Department spokesman Charles Redman said Friday.
   ``We continue to believe that the unconditional release from
detention of Mr. Mandela and other representatives of opposition
opinion is essential to the search for peaceful solutions to South
Africa's severe internal problems,'' Redman said.
   ``We hope the South African government's decision to ease the
terms of Mr. Mandela's detention may be taken as a step in this
direction.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A team of U.S. negotiators is heading for
Moscow this weekend for another try at reaching a new long-term
grain agreement, the White House says.
   The announcement by the U.S. trade representative's office Friday
said the next negotiating session is scheduled for Monday. Alan F.
Holmer, deputy U.S. trade representative, will lead the delegation.
   Reports have circulated in recent days that an agreement may soon
be reached to replace the five-year pact that expired on Sept. 30.
It called for minimum annual purchases by the Soviet Union of U.S.
corn and wheat.
   Though the old agreement has run out, the Soviets have continued
to buy U.S. grain, including more than 5.9 million metric tons of
corn, along with some sorghum grain, soybeans and soybean meal, for
delivery in 1988-89.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   The State Department has condemned what it
described as the forced relocation by Khmer Rouge rebels of innocent
Cambodian civilians out of Thai-based refugee camps to areas close
to the Cambodian border.
   About 8,000 Cambodians were moved out of the Ta Luan camp,
controlled by the Khmer Rouge, in July and August and there have
been similar forced movements of additional Cambodians from other
camps more recently, State Department spokesman Charles Redman said
Friday.
   Most of the remaining 2,000 or so refugees still at the Ta Luan
camp are aged or infirm, he said.
   ``We condemn this forced relocation of innocent civilians from
the relative safety of U.N.-assisted camps to more remote areas
subject to cross border shelling and lacking the necessary
facilities for the provision of essential services,'' Redman said.
   The United States has urged the Thai government to use its
influence to encourage more responsible, humane actions on the part
of the Khmer Rouge and it has done so, Redman added.

   Emmy Award-winning actress Mare Winningham
continues to pull off a balancing act between family and career with
the fifth child she's borne in the past seven years.
   She is co-starring on stage with Sean Penn and Danny Aiello in
David Rabe's ``Hurlyburly'' and nursing a 2-month-old son.
   ``It's an ideal play for a breast-feeding mother,'' she said of
the new production directed by playwright Rabe, which opened Nov. 16
for a 10-week run at the Westwood Playhouse. ``It's a three-act play
and I'm in the second act (only), so I feed him before I go on and
after I come off.''
   Winningham plays ``a naked balloon dancer _ you never see her at
work,'' in the story of six people caught up in the Hollywood drug
scene.
   In the past few years, between babies, Winningham has attracted a
number of serious roles in TV movies, including ``Love Is Never
Silent,'' which earned an Emmy nomination, and ``Amber Waves,'' for
which she won a Best Supporting Actress Emmy. She is also known for
her portrayal of the daughter in the miniseries ``The Thorn Birds.''

   Larry Harmon, television's original Bozo the
clown, has released his list of 1988's notable no-nos, otherwise
known as the winners of the 6th annual Bozo awards.
   Top winners of the dubious awards named after the famous TV clown
were letter lady Vanna White, disgraced preacher Jimmy Swaggart,
dethroned Olympian Ben Johnson, boxer Mike Tyson and talk-show melee
victim Geraldo Rivera.
   Miss White, of ``Wheel of Fortune'' fame, took the showbiz award
for ``exposing herself to the letter'' in a men's magazine layout,
Harmon said Friday.
   Swaggart, the evangelist who acknowledged consorting with a
prostitute, revealed that ``old-time religion and another old-time
profession just don't mix.'' Johnson took the sports division
because his 100-meter gold medal at the Seoul Olympics was yanked
because of a positive test for steroids.
   Tyson's well publicized marriage problems won him the newsmaker
Bozo, and Rivera, whose nose was broken by a thrown chair during a
brawl on the set of ``Geraldo,'' took the journalism honor ``for
showing us that he has a nose for news after all,'' Harmon said.
   Other winners in 11 different categories included actress Cher
for endorsing yet another celebrity scent and Jimmy the Greek, who
took the public speaking award for ``his dubious analysis of black
athletes.''
   This year the actual award is a Bozo telephone, which will be
sent to each winner.

   A plan by soul singer James Brown to put on a
show featuring wrestling and rock 'n' roll has drawn protests from
an Augusta police group, but a law enforcement group across the
border in Aiken, S.C., is happy. Brown, 55, is not on the bill for
the Dec. 4 charity event, which he is donating as part of his
probation. But the event's promoter, Jacque Daughtry, said Friday
that Brown will be present and might join the performers for one
song.
   The Police Benevolent Association in Augusta called for a police
boycott after members received complaints about police participation
in the show.
   But Ed Kaney, head of the Fraternal Order of Police's Aiken
chapter, said: ``My lodge has agreed to use the funds from this
event to purchase food and gifts for needy families within the CSRA
(Central Savannah River Area).''
   Last summer, Circuit Judge James E. Moore designated the Aiken
FOP to arrange the benefit concert ``for benefit of FOP and Helping
Hands,'' an Aiken shelter for abused children.
   The order was part of a sentence Brown, 55, received after
entering a plea of no contest to a charge of possession of the drug
PCP, and pleading guilty to resisting arrest and carrying a pistol.

   The highest-ranking woman in the
Bush presidential transition entourage has served notice that she
doesn't want to be considered for the job of White House press
secretary.
   Sheila Tate, who held that position during the last six months of
Bush's campaign and has served in the same capacity as he prepares
to succeed Ronald Reagan on Jan. 20, said she concluded the job
would be too demanding.
   ``It's the total inability to ever have your own schedule,''
Tate, 47, said in a telephone interview Friday from the transition
office in Washington. ``I found myself in almost a permanent bad
mood, thinking about what did I want to do.''
   As press secretary to the transition, Tate had one of the
highest-ranking jobs and one with a high profile, and there had been
speculation that the former public relations executive was in line
to become the first woman to become press secretary to a president.
   ``I have no idea what he'll do at this point,'' Tate said, when
asked to speculate on where Bush would turn for a press secretary.
   There has been little public speculation about that position,
although the names of former Bush press secretary Peter Teeley,
Newsweek correspondent Thomas DeFrank and Cable News Network
anchorman Bernard Shaw have been mentioned.
   Meanwhile, Bush's transition office released a list Friday of its
109 paid staffers as well as transition volunteers, who include
Bush's eldest son, George, and John Sununu, the designated White
House chief of staff.
   Tate was listed as a paid staffer.
   Tate said she informed Bush of her decision on Wednesday, just
before the president-elect left Washington for a short vacation at
his compound in Kennebunkport, Maine.
   Bush has said that he wants to bring more women and minorities
into important positions in government and in his administration.
   Tate said Friday that she did not think taking her name out of
competition for the press secretary's job would necessarily lessen
the chance that it would be given to a woman.
   ``There are plenty of qualified women,'' she said, `` ... (so) I
don't take it upon myself that it is less likely.''
   ``He'll find the best people for the jobs,'' said Tate, who
served as Nancy Reagan's press secretary in the White House East
Wing from 1981-1985.
   ``I know that a lot of them (Bush appointments) will be women and
a lot of them will be minorities,'' she said.
   Tate said that the job of press secretary is particularly
grueling, and said, ``I just have so much going on. I've worked in
the White House. ... I do not want to go back.''
   She said she had no immediate career plans after she completes
her assignment as chief spokeswoman for the transition, but said she
wants to spend more time with her family.
   Tate said her son, Hager, is in his last year of high school and
that she and her husband, William, are building a new home in
McLean, Va.
   She said that Bush ``asked me my thought processes'' in deciding
to withdraw as a candidate for the press secretary's job and said
``he understood my concerns and we left it at that.''

<DATELINE>PORT ELIZABETH, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nowhere has the government's
counterattack against black militancy been more intense than in
once-embattled townships ringing this industrial port city.
   Bannings, detentions and deployment of army troops have enabled
the government to regain control of what some activists viewed two
years ago as the first ``liberated territory'' in South Africa.
   Monitoring groups estimate one-third of 30,000 activists detained
without charge since mid-1986 were from the Eastern Cape region
around Port Elizabeth. More so than in other areas, prominent
detainees remain in custody. About 55 local leaders are in their
third year of detention.
   The crackdown has been so effective that even underground
opposition activity is minimal, township residents say. But a spirit
of resistance remains, despite a government campaign to win good
will by upgrading services.
   Less than 10 percent of eligible voters here disregarded a call
by anti-apartheid groups to boycott recent local elections. Surveys
show overwhelming support for the outlawed African National Congress
guerrilla movement, which has many leaders from the region's Xhosa
people.
   ``This area has had the most resilient resistance to apartheid,''
said the Rev. Mcebisi Xundu, an Anglican minister. ``On the surface
it does seem the people have been made to lose their spirit. I don't
think they have.''
   In 1985, the peak of nationwide black unrest, Port Elizabeth's
anti-apartheid groups organized one of the most potent consumer
boycotts in South African history, prompting white business leaders
to open negotiations. Militant street committees held sway in many
black areas, sustained student boycotts closed schools, even the
security forces sometimes could not move freely.
   In June 1986, the government declared a national state of
emergency: activists were jailed, the townships sealed off with
barbed wire and checkpoints.
   ``When they (the security forces) moved in, they assisted the
community to identify the government not as a savior but as an
enemy,'' said Mike Mjekula, staff member of a regional human rights
organization.
   ``The people decided to be quiet _ they were not able to fight
this overwhelming force,'' he said. ``Instead they adopted a more
subtle form of resistance _ they would not comply with the
government's wishes.''
   Like other areas where black militancy was strong, parts of the
Eastern Cape are targets of a ``hearts and minds'' campaign to
realize government hopes that better housing and services will give
blacks a stake in preserving the status quo.
   ``The government has done sterling work, building new suburbs,
trying to uplift people,'' said Sakkie Louw, a Port Elizabeth
legislator from the governing National Party. ``Once a man has a
good home, a good roof over his head, he will be a different man
from the one living under plastic bags, not having basic things like
water and electricity.''
   In two new townships for middle-class blacks, the government
seems to have won over some residents, mostly civil servants.
   ``They now have something to lose,'' said Judy Chalmers, regional
coordinator of the Black Sash civil rights group. ``They're not
going to want to be involved in the next wave of unrest if they can
possibly avoid it.''
   In older, larger townships, she said, ``There's a feeling of
waiting.''
   ``Everybody is quite relieved to have a respite from the horrors
of 1985-86. The kids are back in school, the leaders are in
detention. But the hearts and minds have not been won.''
   For the moment, the new middle-class developments are a
phenomenon. Nearly half of the half-million blacks around Port
Elizabeth live in shacks. Most others inhabit aging, overcrowded
box-like houses.
   Some shantytowns _ Red Location and Soweto-by-the-Sea, for
example _ are among the most squalid in the country. Tens of
thousands of squatters live under threat of forced removal.
   A recent study calculated more than half of Port Elizabeth's
blacks are unemployed, the highest number for any major South
African city.
   The automobile industry, for decades Port Elizabeth's major
employer, has suffered hard times lately as sales were slowed by
rising prices. Thousands of jobs were lost two years ago when Ford
Motor Co. sold its operation to South African owners who moved the
plant to Pretoria.
   ``In many grim respects, the Eastern Cape is a mirror image of an
unacceptable future other South Africans will have to face unless
timeous action is taken,'' wrote Rory Riordan, director of the Port
Elizabeth-based Human Rights Trust.
   Referring to other experts' warnings that South Africa faces
recession and worsening racial tension, Riordan writes: ``We have
seen the future (in Port Elizabeth) and it doesn't work.''
   Bobby Stephenson, a city councilor representing the
anti-apartheid Progressive Federal Party, said there are limits to
what Port Elizabeth's whites are able and willing to do to help
their black neighbors.
   ``Security is the first priority in the minds of most whites,''
he said. ``They were very frightened in 1985.''

   A 32-year-old Coptic priest was shot and
killed by masked gunmen believed to be Moslem fundamentalists,
authorities say.
   A security source said on condition of anonymity that the
shooting took place Thursday night as the priest left his church, 25
miles south of Assiut, for home.
   He said the priest previously clashed with Moslem fundamentalists
in the village. He said the extremists had asked the priest to limit
his gatherings and activities in the church to Sundays, but that he
refused.
   The source said two or three masked gunmen ambushed the priest
and shot him several times in the head. He was moved to a hospital
but died there. He was buried in a funeral Friday under heavy
security.
   The source said that Interior Minister Zaki Badr has ordered an
investigation.

<HEAD>Says Eastern Caribbean Must Form Single Nation to Survive</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CASTRIES, St. Lucia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The prime minister of St. Lucia says
seven Eastern Caribbean countries should unite as one nation to
increase their economic clout and decrease the likelihood of coups.
   John Compton, citing the proposed U.S.-Canada free trade
agreement and the success of the Common Market, said, ``The longer
we hesitate (to form a political union), the more difficult the task
becomes as the determination of some of our members appears to
flag.''
   Compton, speaking at a meeting of leaders of the seven-nation
Organization of Eastern Caribbean States, is the strongest supporter
for combining St. Lucia, St. Vincent, Grenada, Dominica, St. Kitts,
the British colony of Montserrat and Antigua, which opposes
unification.
   The six supporting nations of the Caribbean organization signed
an agreement in July 1987 for political union, but there has been no
time set and little real action.
   Compton said the individual island-states cannot survive alone.
He said the vulnerability of tiny states was demonstrated this month
by a coup attempt in the Maldives off southern India, ``which
indicates the steps we should take if our countries are not to be
the next target of mercenary adventure.''
   Compton said the open market planned for 1992 by the European
Economic Community and a trade agreement between Canada and the
United States, to become law Jan. 1, ``should be an encouragement to
those who dare advance the cause of unity.''
   The two-day summit focused on political unity, proposals for
unifying the islands' police and customs, and an end to the use of
passports for inter-island travel.
   Excluding Antigua's 100,000 citizens, the six pro-unity countries
have a combined population of about 450,000. The seven
English-speaking islands already have an integrated economy,
including a common central bank and a common currency, the Eastern
Caribbean dollar.
   Compton said this week that even without a consensus on unity,
``those of us who are ready to go will move on and allow the others
to join along the way.''
   Of the six supporting members, the Leeward islands of St. Kitts
and Montserrat have been the most hesitant. The four Windward
islands, which share the region with the French-owned islands of
Martinique and Guadeloupe, have been the strongest supporters of
unification.

   A strong earthquake jolted an uninhabited area of
western China this morning, the State Seismological Bureau said.
   The quake, measuring 6.0 on the Richter scale, was the second
this month to hit the area of the Tanggula Mountains, a 19,680-foot
snow-clad range in Qinghai province north of Tibet.
   On Nov. 5 the bureau registered a quake of 7.0 on the Richter
scale in the barren area.
   That was followed a day later by China's most devastating quake
of this decade, a tremor of 7.6 on the Richter scale that by the
latest official count killed 730 people in southwest China's Yunnan
province.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded by
seismographs. A quake of 6.0 can cause substantial damage if it
occurs directly below an urban area, and a tremor of 7.0 is 10 times
as powerful.
   Today's quake struck at 6:29 a.m., the bureau said, according to
a report of the official Xinhua News Agency.

<TEXT>
   Iran, accused of executing 1,140
dissidents, says it will allow U.N. human rights inspectors into the
country before year's end.
   Reynaldo Galindo Pohl, the U.N.'s special reporter on human
rights in Iran, issued a report three weeks ago accusing Iran of
ordering ``a wave of executions'' of opposition members in July,
August and September.
   Iranian U.N. Ambassador Mohammad Ja'afar Mahallati said Friday
that Galindo Pohl and his investigators would receive the ``full
cooperation of the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran in all
respects before the end of 1988, for the purpose of carrying out his
mandate.''
   Australian Ambassador Michael Costello this week asked Iran to
``give a clear, unconditional and public indication of its readiness
to allow a visit (by human rights investigators) within a specified
period.''
   Galindo Pohl and the U.N. Special Commission on Human Rights have
never been allowed to visit Iran to check reports of abuses, and
instead have had to rely mainly on reports in Iranian and Western
media.
   Mahallati said Galindo Pohl's previous report relied on the
People's Mujahedeen opposition group, which he described as ``a
terrorist organization ... filled with the bogus allegations leveled
against the Islamic Republic of Iran with clear malice, purely
political and propaganda objectives.''
   ``It would be far-fetched to logically expect to find any truth
in their allegations concerning a regime against which they have
sworn enmity,'' he said.
   ``Therefore, we consider our call for full cooperation with the
special representative as a healthy challenge to him,'' Mahallati
said.
   Galindo Pohl's interim report cited mass executions in Iran from
July through September that included 1,140 political prisoners, as
well as other common criminals.
   The executions followed a July 25-28 raid into Iran by the
National Liberation Army, the armed wing of the People's Mujahedeen,
and Iran's accepted in mid-July of a cease-fire with Iraq. The truce
took effect Aug. 20.
   His report also said persecution of Bahai worshipers continues,
although some Bahais have been released from jail in recent months.
   Bahais are a 19th century offshoot of Islam viewed by most
Moslems as a heretic sect. The estimated 300,000 Bahais in Iran are
denied the right to practice their faith and cannot obtain higher
education or work for the government.

   Twelve villagers and 10 rebels were
killed when guerrillas with automatic rifles and grenades battled
local defense forces at a remote hamlet, the government said.
   The Defense Ministry said Friday the attack shows the rebels do
not really want a cease-fire.
   A ministry communique said the rebels attacked El Guabo, 137
miles east of Managua, at 2 a.m. Wednesday. The rebels also wounded
four villagers and kidnapped a woman, it added.
   ``Contrary to accusations by spokesmen from the Reagan
administration blaming the Sandinista Popular Army for breaking the
agreement to halt offensive military operations ... the facts show
the contrary. Those truly responsible for systematically violating
the cease-fire are the counterrevolutionary forces,'' the ministry
said.
   Washington cut off military aid last February to the Nicaraguan
rebels, known as Contras, but continued supplying them with
humanitarian aid.
   The government and the Contras agreed to a cease-fire in March,
but talks aimed at a more comprehensive peace broke off in
September. Each side accused the other of violating the truce.

   Top advisers to President-elect
George Bush remain deeply divided over whether former Sen. John
Tower should be named secretary of defense, sources have said.
   Bush also sidestepped questions Friday about reports he would
back $3.5 billion to $5 billion in Medicare cuts, but he pledged to
zero in quickly on the problem of cutting the U.S. budget deficit.
   ``I keep reading in the papers a lot of things I'm supposed to be
doing that I don't know anything about,'' Bush told reporters on
Friday.
   Bush suggested he had made no decisions yet on budget cuts.
   ``Don't make judgments based on stories that don't really have
any authority behind them,'' he said.
   Sources close to the vice president, who spoke only on the
condition of anonymity, said the issue of selecting a defense
secretary remained up in the air. The sources said top advisers
remain sharply divided on earlier plans to fill the post with Tower,
the former Senate Armed Services chairman from Texas.
   Bush himself has given no clues on whom he might select, but in
recent days has appeared to discourage suggestions that it would be
Tower. In any event, Bush has said that he has not yet made up his
mind _ and that the decision will be his alone.
   Bush, visiting his family's vacation home, worked for several
hours on Friday in the small cabin he uses as an office but told
reporters he had no appointments scheduled during his Thanksgiving
holiday.
   Bush on Friday swooped into town to visit a wine and cheese
store, then went to a video store where he rented the movie
``Broadcast News.'' He also stopped in at a hardware store and a
golf equipment shop at a local country club.
   Spokesman Stephen Hart said suggestions on Medicare cuts were
``completely speculative. It's premature for anyone to speculate
about the budget.''
   Bush declined to comment further on news accounts, including one
in Friday's editions of the Washington Post, that his administration
would go along with some $3.5 to $5 billion in proposed Medicare
cuts expected to be recommended by outgoing President Reagan in his
final budget submission to Congress in January.
   Asked whether he would advocate chops in Medicare funding, Bush
said: ``My view is I'll address the whole budget problem very soon.''
   Bush pledged earlier this week to send negotiators to meet with
members of Congress on the first day of his presidency.
   That strategy was in keeping with a proposal by the man Bush
picked to be budget director, Richard Darman, that Bush not submit
his own rewrite of the Reagan budget, but instead work behind the
scenes with Congress to forge a compromise.
   Bush has insisted he will not support any form of tax increase,
and would seek to reduce the nation's $150 billion a year budget
deficit with a ``flexible freeze.''
   Such a freeze would hold overall spending at the level of
inflation, pairing additional spending in new areas with new
cutbacks in others.
   Bush aides have said that the only item not on the table for such
cuts is Social Security benefits, remarks that made it all but
certain that the new administration would advocate cuts in other
so-called ``entitlement' programs, like Medicare.
   Meanwhile, Bush aides said a meeting this weekend with defeated
Democratic rival Michael Dukakis would not occur. They said it will
probably happen next week in Washington.
   The Bushes had dinner Friday night at their home with Cardinal
Bernard Law, the archbishop of Boston.

<DATELINE>CONDON, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pat Wolke sat at a new soda fountain eating
frozen yogurt. That may be no great shakes in other towns, but it's
a triumph for once-desolate Condon, which not long ago advertised
for ``a few good residents.''
   ``I love frozen yogurt,'' said Wolke, the district attorney and
the only lawyer in Gilliam County. ``I'm so glad this place opened.''
   About 60 new residents have arrived to help fill Condon's empty
houses and storefronts, and next year a landfill expected to bring
$1 million a year to the county will open.
   ``It's the `Condon Comeback,' they're calling it,'' said Gretchen
Larue, Wolke's secretary, who came here with her Condon-native
husband to get away from big-city life in Portland.
   Two years ago, Condon, a town of 715 people east of the Cascades,
had no frozen yogurt and not much of a future. This town in northern
Oregon lived and died on how much rain fell on the surrounding wheat
fields.
   Wolke, real estate agent Boyd Harris, Home Telephone Co. manager
Bill Berray and Times-Journal newspaper Editor Mac Stinchfield
decided they had had enough of watching their town die.
   They ran a little ad in the Los Angeles Times touting the town as
having lots of clean air and cheap houses but practically no jobs or
crime.
   When they placed the newspaper advertisement, they never dreamed
they would soon be watching themselves on the evening news.
   ``When it hit national TV, it went nuts,'' Harris recalled
recently. ``Over $2 million worth of advertising we got for free.''
   They have sent about 4,000 replies to inquiries about Condon.
   ``We analyzed the letters to see why people were looking at
Condon,'' Harris said. ``The biggest reason was safety. People are
scared out in those cities.''
   But with no jobs available, most of the new residents have been
retired people with enough money to go south for the winter.
   Among the few new Condonites able to make a living here are Ed
and Priscilla Cathcart, who moved from Los Angeles and bought the
local Texaco station.
   ``The lack of people, really, I think, is what we like the
most,'' said Cathcart. ``But it's funny. We know more people here
than we did in L.A.''
   Stinchfield conceded no new jobs exist for young families.
   But that's where the new dump comes in.
   ``We don't say dump,'' corrected Harris. ``We say landfill.''
   Whatever you call it, the 2,000-acre plot that Oregon Waste
Systems Inc. is developing outside Arlington _ on the
Washington-Oregon border and about 20 miles north of Condon _ will
mean about 30 new jobs when the landfill opens next summer, said
Harris.
   Charging a fee tied to the amount of garbage dumped, Gilliam
County expects to bring in $1 million a year.
   Wolke would like to see the money used to give homeowners a break
by cutting in half property taxes that are among the highest in the
state. Others want to see the money used for economic development. A
task force is working out a plan.
   With garbage dumps filling up across the nation and many towns
uneasy about burying it in their back yards, Condon sees a great
future in waste disposal. There's even talk of taking garbage from
Seattle and Spokane, Wash.
   ``It's honest capitalistic enterprise,'' said Harris. ``There's a
labor force of young people who have lived here and who would move
back here if there was a job.''

   Alphaeus Philemon Cole, a portraitist, has died
of heart failure at the age of 112.
   Cole, born in Jersey City, N.J., died Friday at his home in the
Chelsea Hotel in Manhattan.
   Cole became a member of the Salmagundi Club, the nation's oldest
professional art club, in 1918 and was elected to the National
Academy of Design in 1930.
   His work is in the permanent collections of London's National
Portrait Gallery, the Brooklyn Museum and several universities.
   He expressed little admiration for Modernism and its progeny,
preferring the work of 19th century salon painters.
   Cole studied in Paris at the Academie Julian and the Ecole des
Beaux Arts.
   His father was Timothy Cole, a noted 19th century engraver of Old
Master paintings.

<TEXT>
   Northeast Iowa is hog and cattle
country, but Raleigh Buckmaster makes his bucks by raising deer for
the dinner table.
   Buckmaster gave up his veterinary practice three years ago to
enter deer farming, which he says is a fledgling industry in the
United States but a major economic force in New Zealand and a
growing business in Canada.
   ``Last year the gross national product of New Zealand venison
exceeded the sheep industry,'' a mainstay of the island nation,
Buckmaster said recently. ``There's 600,000 deer being farmed in New
Zealand.''
   At Buckmaster's Capoli Ranch, about 400 head of deer graze behind
a wire fence on forested bluffs overlooking the Mississippi River.
   He protects his herd from dogs and coyotes with three llamas that
patrol behind the fence. The llamas provide more than adequate
protection, Buckmaster said, but he has guns just in case.
   Otherwise, Buckmaster runs his deer farm like a cattle ranch.
``The does are the cows. The fawns are the calves and the bucks are
the bulls,'' he said.
   His stock aren't the white-tailed deer of the American woods, but
fallow deer, a breed of European origin that's 30 percent smaller
than its U.S. cousin.
   The deer graze during the spring, summer and fall, and are fed
hay and shelled corn during winter.
   That diet and the lack of stress white-tailed deer experience in
the wild means that fallow deer venison doesn't have the sometime
gamey taste of white-tailed venison, he said.
   ``Fallow deer is considered the world's finest venison,''
Buckmaster said.
   ``Nutritionally, venison is better for you than any other red
meat and some white meat, including chicken,'' he said, claiming
that his product is ``practically cholesterol-free, with one-third
the calories of beef and less than 8 percent fat.''
   Capoli Ranch has its own slaughterhouse, freezer and other
facilities for processing and packaging venison. Buckmaster and his
wife, JoEllyn, sell summer sausages and other deer meat products
through catalogs.
   Most of Buckmaster's customers are from out of state, with the
bulk of his sales coming from Arkansas, Colorado and Montana.
   He said he's always been interested in deer, and began
researching the prospects of operating a deer farm after hearing of
similar ventures in New Zealand.
   ``They started 15 years ago raising deer,'' Buckmaster said.
``They have developed a technology for raising deer intensively.
They are the pros.
   ``Deer farming in Canada is picking up and deer farming in Texas
is picking up in a big way,'' he said. ``In the United States, deer
farming is in an absolutely embryonic state.''
   Buckmaster is convinced the market for fallow deer venison in
this country is growing.
   ``In California, in the last six months, they've increased their
venison imports 300 percent,'' he said. ``In New York, you can go
into a restaurant and find fresh fallow venison at any good menu.''

<TEXT>
   Gov. Michael S. Dukakis says he hopes to meet with
President-elect George Bush in Washington some time before he leaves
on vacation early next month.
   ``He has asked to meet with me (and) I am pleased to do that,''
the former Democratic presidential candidate said Friday.
``Obviously, I want to do everything I can to make this country the
very best country it can be, and that is true regardless of
partisanship.''
   Asked if he planned to give Bush some advice, Dukakis said:
``Well, I offered a good deal of advice during the campaign. He is
aware of that.''
   He added that Bush ``faces some very formidable challenges, the
most important of which is how to deal with some very, very tough
budget and trade deficits.''
   In an impromptu news conference at the Statehouse, Dukakis said
Democrats would be prepared to support Bush if he takes ``bold and
decisive action'' in social and economic policy.
   ``On the other hand, we are also concerned about our children's
future, about education and health care and housing, the environment
and the future of this country, and we want to make sure that those
important priorities remain important priorities.''
   There is concern, Dukakis said, that ``we don't begin balancing
budgets with cuts in Medicare and Medicaid and health care and the
kinds of things that, unfortunately, some people who are part of the
transition, are talking about.''
   Bush sidestepped questions Friday about reports he would back
$3.5 billion to $5 billion in Medicare cuts. The cuts are expected
to be recommended by outgoing President Reagan in his final budget
submission to Congress.
   ``I keep reading in the papers a lot of things I'm supposed to be
doing that I don't know anything about,'' Bush told reporters Friday
at his family's home in Kennebunkport, Maine.

   Eastern Canada's strongest earthquake in 53 years
knocked out power and telephone service, buckled railroad tracks,
shook buildings and sent tremors from Michigan to Washington.
   About 50 people near the quake's epicenter at Chicoutimi, Quebec,
suffered minor cuts and bruises, but no serious injuries were
reported in Canada or in the United States. One American said he was
knocked out of his seat; others said windows rattled, dishes fell
from shelves and ceilings cracked.
   Seismologists said the quake registered 6.0 on the Richter scale,
enough to cause severe damage, but damage was relatively minor.
   Janet Drysdale of the Geological Survey of Canada placed the
epicenter about 90 miles northwest of Quebec City and just east of
the St. Lawrence River along a minor fault zone.
   ``It was pretty dreadful,'' said Irene Bouchard in Chicoutimi.
``Some of our picture frames crashed to the floor, our animals
started running about and then they hid themselves.''
   A shopper at a Chicoutimi shopping center said, ``Windows broke,
bits of ceiling fell. It created a real panic, people crying. It was
unbelievable.''
   The tremors knocked out power in Montreal and Quebec City and
elsewhere in the province but apparently caused more fear than
damage.
   ``We're on the seventh floor and I thought we were going to be on
the first,'' said Charlie Popejoy, 80, of the central Ontario city
of Orillia.
   In the United States, the quake was felt from the Great Lakes to
the Atlantic Coast and from Maine to Washington, but there were no
reports of damage.
   ``I was sitting watching TV and all at once I started feeling
dizzy,'' said Roy Tabikha of Cambridge, Mass. ``I thought there was
something wrong with me.''
   Peter Dehlinger, professor of geophysics at the University of
Connecticut, said the quake generated 1,000 times more energy than
anything previously recorded in that state. He said Connecticut had
an earthquake measuring 3.5 to 4 in the late 1960s in Long Island
Sound.
   Michael Luongo Jr. of Litchfield, Conn., was watching television
when the tremor hit, and thought he had a visitor.
   ``I was convinced there was someone behind my couch shaking it
for five, six seconds,'' said Luongo. ``I peeked over the top of it
(the couch) to actually look and shook my head in disbelief.''
   Gary Wilson was sitting in a chair on the second floor of his
Otisville, N.Y., home when the chair started to move.
   ``It was like sitting on top of a bowl of jello,'' he said.
   In Albany, New York Gov. Mario Cuomo was in the Executive
Mansion. ``I did feel it, very definitely. The chandelier shook. The
floor moved. It lasted about 10 seconds but it was something I'll
remember for much longer than that,'' Cuomo said.
   Clifford Williams of the Pennsylvania State Police said, ``One
lady called us and said she had whitecaps in her fish tank and her
chandelier was shaking.''
   Added Warwick, R.I., police Lt. Raymond Savoie, ``One guy had
complained that he had literally been knocked out of his chair.''
   The quake rattled Boston's Top of the Hub restaurant on the 52nd
floor of the Prudential Center while about 120 people were dining,
said maitre d' Stephen Brown.
   ``The entire dining room felt it. Everyone felt they were
becoming dizzy or faint. They all sort of smiled and looked at each
other,'' he said.
   Tremors began at 6:46 p.m. EST and lasted 15 seconds to two
minutes, Canadian Press reported.
   John Adams of the Geological Survey of Canada in Ottawa said it
was the largest earthquake in eastern Canada since 1935, when a
quake registering 6.4 on the Richter scale hit.
   Canadian Press said traffic lights were out in Quebec City and
that electricity was cut off to Montreal's central train station and
major hotels. Telephone lines also were down.
   Canadian Press said the quake caused the ground to cave in
beneath a railway track just west of Montreal at the approach to a
railway bridge. It said the damage forced Canadian National railroad
officials to shut down the major east-west rail line from Montreal
to Senneterre, 220 miles to the west.
   The tremors caused a fluorine gas leak at the Alcan aluminum
smelter in Jonquiere, Quebec, 25 miles west of Chicoutimi, but the
leak was repaired shortly afterward, the agency said.
   A foreshock was felt Wednesday and in the same southeastern
section of Quebec, the Charlevoix region, said Adams. That quake
measured 4.5 to 4.9 on the Richter scale. No serious damage was
reported.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude.
   An earthquake measuring 5 on the Richter scale can cause
considerable damage; a 6 severe damage, and a 7 is a major
earthquake.

   Thirty-five cars of an 89-car freight
train derailed during a heavy thunderstorm, and about 50 residents
were evacuated when anhydrous ammonia leaked from one of the cars,
officials said.
   Two people who were driving near the derailment were overcome by
ammonia fumes and were taken to a hospital in Terrell, about 30
miles away.
   The Union Pacific train derailed about 7:30 p.m. Friday shortly
before the National Weather Service issued a tornado warning for the
rural area. One witness said the train might have been hit by a
small tornado, but authorities were unsure what caused the accident.
   One car was spilling anhydrous ammonia, which is poisonous,
officials said.
   ``This is a hazardous material in a concentrated form. It's
pretty unhealthy,'' said Alex Tice, the railroad's regional director
for public relations in Omaha, Neb.
   A second car carrying anhydrous ammonia and one carrying
chlorine, which is also hazardous, were not leaking, he said. Three
empty cars of the 89-car train bound for Fort Worth last carried
sulphuric acid, another hazardous material.
   The train's four-member crew was not injured, Tice said.
   An emergency room supervisor at the Terrell Community Hospital
said the two people brought to the hospital would stay there
overnight, but were not seriously injured.
   The train derailed about a half-mile west of this northeast Texas
community of 400, about 70 miles east of Dallas. Authorities closed
the two roads in the vicinity of the wreck and evacuated nearby
residents.
   Lodean Tennison, dispatcher for the Tyler Fire Department, said
an estimated 50 to 75 people were evacuated. Tyler is 30 miles from
Fruitvale.
   ``We have about 45 or 50 over here,'' said Rev. Tom Pesnell,
pastor of the Main Street Baptist Church in Grand Saline, where many
of the evacuees went. ``There are some that have gone to stay with
their various families. There are some staying in motels.''

<TEXT>
   A Greek banking and publishing tycoon embroiled in
a multimillion-dollar scandal that has rocked the Greek government
fled his homeland in fear of his life, his lawyer says.
   George Koskotas knew he probably would face extradition
proceedings in the United States, but came here from Brazil for
safety, Washington attorney Ron Liebman said at a bail hearing for
Koskotas Friday.
   The 34-year-old banker fled Greece on Nov. 6 after being indicted
on five counts of fraud and embezzlement alleging he siphoned more
than $135 million from the Bank of Crete, of which he was chairman.
   ``The facts under which Mr. Koskotas came here indicate that the
very last place on earth Mr. Koskotas wants to leave is the United
States,'' he said at the U.S. District Court hearing.
   ``Mr. Koskotas, in imminent fear of his life, came to the one
place in this world where he felt that he and his family would be
safe from murder,'' Liebman said.
   But U.S. Magistrate Joyce Alexander denied bail after Assistant
U.S. Attorney Victor A. Wild argued that bail should not be set in
an extradition case and that any flight by Koskotas would have
international repercussions.
   Koskotas was being held in a federal facility in Massachusetts
and a review hearing was tentatively set for Wednesday.
   The scandal has embarrassed the government of Premier Andreas
Papandreou and prompted the resignations of two government ministers.
   Koskotas had been ordered to remain in Greece while officials
investigated alleged irregularities at the Bank of Crete.
   In Athens, Spyros Papadatos, temporary commissioner appointed by
the Greek government to investigate the case, said in a report that
Koskotas used bank money for $200 million in loans without
collateral and gifts to soccer clubs, athletes, business associates,
journalists and friends.
   Koskotas was suspended Oct. 20 as chairman of Bank of Crete. He
had acquired a controlling interest in the bank in 1984 after
working in its central Athens branch for two years as an accountant.
He also built a publishing empire and bought a controlling interest
in a Athens soccer club.
   Koskotas was arrested Wednesday night by FBI agents at Hanscom
Field in Bedford, about 15 miles west of Boston, after he arrived in
a private jet. The arrest was made after the Justice Department
received information from Greek authorities, department spokesman
Thomas Stewart said in Washington.

   Soldiers used tractors today to excavate
villages buried in mud and search for survivors of floods that
killed more than 200 people and left 300 missing, an official said.
   Four army helicopters brought food and medicine to villages in
Nakhon Sri Thammarat, the worst hit province, said Saim Kaewsinual,
spokesman for the Fourth Army Region. Twelve southern provinces were
battered by a week of heavy rains.
   Saim said that by this evening, authorities recovered the bodies
of 236 people, mostly victims of mudslides that swept through Nakhon
Sri Thammarat starting Tuesday. He said 688 people were injured and
305 were reported missing.
   Mudslides destroyed 4,952 houses, 28 government offices, 221
roads and 69 bridges, he said.
   Water levels have returned to normal in many areas of the
province, Saim said.
   He said about 500 soldiers used tractors and other equipment in
the rescue effort in Nakhon Sri Thammarat's Phipoon district, where
mud and logs had charged down hillsides, slamming into houses and
crushing people. The hills were barren because of uncontrolled
logging and mining, officials said.
   Saim said about 1,000 villagers greeted Prime Minister Chatichai
Choonhavan as he inspected the damage at Phipoon district today.
   Chatichai promised food, medicine and new land for the victims,
he said.
   In neighboring northern Malaysia, the death toll from heavy
monsoon rains and flooding rose to 30 today with the discovery of
three more bodies, said the country's national news agency, Bernama.
   A total of 22,730 victims of the floods were receiving care in
emergency relief centers, down from an original 47,000, it said.
   The report also said life was beginning to return to normal in
the flood-affected regions. The northeastern state of Kelantan was
the worst hit.
   The Meteorological Department issued a strong wind and rough seas
warning for the next two days for the states of Sabah and Sarawak on
the island of Borneo, east of peninsular Malaysia.

   Iran's first health minister after the

Islamic Republic News Agency reported today.
   Dr. Kazem Sami, 54, will be buried today, said the official news
agency, monitored in Cyprus.
   The assailant, posing as a patient at the doctor's clinic,
stabbed Sami in the head, chest and arms on Wednesday, IRNA said.
The doctor was unconscious after the attack and rushed to a hospital
where doctors operated for six hours.
   IRNA said the attacker has not been captured. It did not report
any suspected motive in the attack.
   Sami was born in the northeastern provincial capital of Mashad in
1934.
   He was imprisoned several times for his political activism under
the late shah, according an official Islamic Republic Who's Who. In
addition to his medical degree, he held degrees in psychiatry,
introductory theology and a master's in sociology.
   He was a professor at Tehran University and head of the
psychotherapy department at Raazi Mental Hospital.
   After the revolution, in addition to running the health ministry,
he was head of the Red Crescent Association, the Moslem equivalent
of the Red Cross.
   Sami was also an unsuccessful candidate in the first
post-revolutionary presidential election, the Who's Who said.

   Thousands of animal rights activists including TV celebrities
staged anti-fur protests from Beverly Hills to Fifth Avenue, urging
fur owners to return their pricey garments and end animal suffering.
   ``Fur coats are worn by beautiful animals and ugly people,''
declared T-shirts worn by some of the 50 protesters who turned out
in San Francisco for the nationwide ``Fur-Free Friday'' organized by
Trans-Species Unlimited. Among the demonstrators was Amanda Blake of
``Gunsmoke'' TV series fame.
   In New York City, television game show host Bob Barker led about
2,000 demonstrators chanting, ``Fur is murder! Don't buy fur!'' as
they marched down Fifth Avenue.
   About 40 people picketed outside Saks Fifth Avenue and
Neiman-Marcus department stores in Beverly Hills; 25 each
demonstrated at a Boston fur store and a shopping center in
Harrisburg, Pa.
   In New York, some protesters occasionally spat on fur-clad
passers-by.
   Barker said a woman admonished him, ``Shame on you, one of your
people spit on me.''
   ``I said, `Only one?''' Barker said.
   Dozens of shoppers stopped along the sidewalk to stare and point.
One couple, sporting his and her furs, beat a hasty retreat across
the street.
   ``My fur is beautiful. Please don't kill me or my friends,'' read
a sandwich sign worn by a Labrador retriever.
   Racoon pelts dangled from one man's outstretched fists; another
carried a realistic-looking human skeleton. One woman trudged along
in a beaver costume and another wore bunny ears.
   Barker, who quit his job as host of the Miss USA and Miss
Universe beauty contests last year to protest the awarding of fur
coats as prizes, said the demonstration had been ``successful beyond
our wildest expectations.''
   San Francisco organizers estimated they received 30 to 50 furs in
a ``fur drop'' intended to get the items out of circulation.
Organizers said the collected furs would be defaced and used for
educational purposes.
   Demonstrators wore paper masks and carried signs as they marched
around San Francisco's elegant Union Square shopping area. Some
carried traps while others dressed up as a reindeer, a panda bear
and a fox.
   Blake, best known for her role as Miss Kitty in ``Gunsmoke,''
wore a fake-fur trimmed hat.
   Explaining her decision 25 years ago to stop wearing real fur,
she said, ``It's agony for the animals and I don't believe that
animals should have to suffer for some dumb broad's vanity _ or for
some stupid man's vanity.''
   Blake defended the leather boots she was wearing, saying
producers ``use the whole cow ... That's important. It's not a trash
animal.''
   Protesters objected to the conditions in which animals raised for
fur are kept, alleging they are kept in isolation in cramped,
wire-bottomed cages. They also object to the ways animals are killed
to protect their pelts, which they said included trapping, gassing,
suffocation and electrocution.
   Belkin's Furs owner Alan Belkin, whose business is one block away
from Union Square, rejected protesters' claims.
   ``All the furs we use today are raised; they're not wild,'' he
said.
   Animals are raised well in clean environments partly because
mistreatment would make their pelts valueless, he added, calling
animal rights activists extremists who will not be satisfied until
furs are not used at all.
   Among those handing over their furs in San Francisco were Palo
Alto Humane Society President Patricia Elson and her daughter, Kate,
who turned in two coats.
   ``I'm ashamed to wear it,'' said Elson, holding a brown nutria
coat she valued at something under $1,000. ``I'm ashamed to have it
in my closet. Every time I see it in my closet, I feel sick ... You
realize you can't wear them for fashion anymore.''

<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   On a campus where basketball players are courted
with a religious zeal, Nevada's brightest students are getting a
second look, thanks to a university chief who resolved to reverse
this state's ``brain drain.''
   Shortly after his arrival four years ago, Robert Maxson initiated
a program that makes the University of Nevada-Las Vegas the only
university in the country offering a four-year scholarship to the
valedictorian of every high school in the state.
   ``We've always offered full scholarships to athletically talented
youngsters,'' he said in an interview this week. ``I think that's
OK. But it made sense to me that if we were going to offer full
scholarships to athletically talented youngsters, we ought to be
able to offer the same to academically talented youngsters.''
   A one-liner often heard in this basketball-crazy entertainment
capital is that someday someone would build a great university
befitting the stature of the Nevada-Las Vegas Runnin' Rebels, a
perennial college basketball power.
   Maxson, a gregarious, 50-year-old Texas transplant took the
challenge seriously when he came to UNLV from the University of
Houston in 1984.
   He has guided the university through its greatest period of
growth, increasing enrollment from 10,000 to 15,000.
   He has coaxed millions out of the state's casino owners and
corporate giants for scholarships and educational programs. He sold
the Summa Corp. on helping to fund an engineering school named for
the company's founder, Howard Hughes.
   Maxson launched the scholarship program after arriving in this
glitter city and learning that the gaming industry can be a major
resource for educating Nevada's young people. At the time, 46
percent of Nevada's high school graduates were leaving the state to
continue their education.
   ``We were ranked 49th in the country, second only to Alaska in
the number of young people we were losing,'' Maxson recalled. ``We
knew if we were going to build a great university, we were going to
have to keep the best and brightest in Nevada.''
   Maxson's answer: Offer the valedictorian of each of Nevada's 53
high schools a $10,000, four-year scholarship to UNLV, ``no
questions asked, major in anything you want.'' Recipients are still
free to receive other scholarships.
   The one-time $10,000 scholarship is more than enough to cover
tuition, at less than $1,000 a year, with the rest going toward
room, board and other expenses.
   Maxson went searching for the dollars to make it work. He
recalled touting the program at a luncheon meeting and being
approached by Margaret Elardi, owner of the Frontier Hotel and
Casino, who told Maxson she wanted to ``give something back to the
state'' by investing in the young people of Nevada.
   Maxson told her it would take $1 million. Four days later the
Margaret Elardi Nevada Scholarship Program for Valedictorians at
UNLV was launched.
   In the four years since the program began, 101 Nevada high school
valedictorians have received Elardi scholarships. Previously, UNLV
never had more than a half-dozen valedictorians enrolled at one
time, Maxson said.
   He said the program has resulted in a ``substantial turnaround''
in the percentage of Nevada high school students who continue their
education in state, but he had no figures Friday.
   ``Because of this program, not only are we getting the top
graduates, but we've found that other good students follow these
scholastic leaders to UNLV,'' Maxson said. ``We think we've helped
stop the brain drain.''
   ``There are always going to be students who want to go away from
home for various reasons; unique programs at other schools,
maturing, a lot of reasons,'' he said. ``But our philosophy has
always been that we don't want a single student to leave Nevada
because they feel they have to to get a good education.
   Mrs. Elardi shuns publicity and did not return calls for an
interview. But she remains close to the students she helps educate,
meeting with them three times a year at dinners and writing to
remind them ``Home is Nevada.''
   The program is providing a full ride for people like Janet
Pachano, 20, a Hopi Indian who finished top among the 15 graduates
of her high school on the Owyhee Indian Reservation, and RaChelle
Reiersgord, 19, the second graduate in the history of the tiny high
school at Jackpot (population 500) to go to college.
   Ms. Reiersgord, valedictorian of her 13-member class and now a
sophomore at UNLV, plans to become a doctor.
   Without the Elardi scholarship?
   ``I would probably be doing what most kids in town do when they
get out of high school, work for one of the casinos,'' she said.

<HEAD>NATO Says Warsaw Pact Has Many More Conventional Arms</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT J. WIELAARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Warsaw Pact has a massive numerical
superiority over NATO in conventional arms on the ground and in the
air, a NATO report said.
   NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner said the report, issued
Friday, does not show a more defensive posture on Moscow's part
despite recent statements from President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   ``I appeal to Mr. Gorbachev to match his words by deeds,''
Woerner said. The report also aims to challenge Moscow to issue its
own data, he said.
   The report, ``Conventional Forces in Europe: The Facts,'' does
not touch on the quality of weapons, only their numbers. Woerner
said the numbers indicate Moscow has the potential to launch a
surprise attack.
   The study is not the basis for NATO negotiators at the
Conventional Stability Talks, expected to begin in Vienna early next
year, he said.
   ``These negotiations will have their own counting rules'' for
conventional arms systems, that are more detailed and address not
just quantity of arms but also their relative quality, he said.
   The report cites East bloc arms systems Western allies will
likely want reduced, including tanks and other armored vehicles,
artillery, anti-tank weapons, air defense systems, helicopters _ as
well as overall troop strength.
   The study says the Warsaw Pact nations have a large superiority
in 11 major arms systems and that in eight of these the Soviet Union
alone outguns all NATO nations and its Warsaw Pact allies combined.
   The report cites these figures for individual arms systems for
the Warsaw Pact nations with comparable figures for NATO in brackets:
   Main battle tanks, 51,500 (16,424); armored infantry fighting
vehicles, 22,400 (4,153); other armored vehicles, 71,000 (35,351);
artillery, 43,400 (13,857); anti-tank weapons, 44,200 (18,240); air
defense systems, 24,400 (10,109); helicopters, 3,700 (2,419)
personnel, 3 million (2.2 million) and combat aircraft 8,250 (3,977).
   Rozanne Ridgway, assistant secretary of state for European
affairs, told a Washington news conference the report demonstrates
the Warsaw Pact has ``a substantial superiority'' in conventional
forces on the ground.
   She cited the ``massive forward deployment of armored forces''
organized and equipped for rapid and offensive operations.
   Alton Keel, U.S. envoy to NATO, said the report shows East bloc
nations maintain forces bigger ``than those of NATO in all heavy
weapons systems and that the Soviet Union retains forces all out of
proportion to those of any other European state.''
   The NATO study focuses on ground and air forces, since naval
forces will not be subject to the talks.
   Keel said he expected the 16 NATO and seven Warsaw Pact nations
to begin the conventional arms talks ``very early next year'' in the
Austrian capital.
   The talks will cover the territory between the Atlantic Ocean and
the Ural Mountains.
   They are to replace the Mutual and Balanced Force Reduction Talks
on force levels in seven NATO and four Warsaw Pact nations in
central Europe which have remained fruitless after almost 15 years.
   Steven Ledogar, the chief U.S. negotiator in Vienna, said Friday
that preliminary meetings on the Conventional Stability Talks were
deadlocked over procedural concerns by France. A new meeting will be
held next week.
   At issue is how to link the talks to the 35-nation Conference on
Security and Cooperation in Europe, which comprises the NATO and
Warsaw Pact nations and 12 neutral countries, officials said.
   France wants to link the talks more firmly to the Conference on
Security and Cooperation in Europe than the United States, which
wants the neutrals to stay away from East-West arms talks.

<HEAD>U.S. Justice Department Sues New Jersey Over `Discriminatory'
Police Tests</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TODD RICHISSIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal government's lawsuit alleging New
Jersey police examinations were discriminatory could result in jobs
with back pay and seniority for thousands of blacks, Hispanics and
women who failed the tests.
   The lawsuit against New Jersey announced Friday by the Justice
Department could lead to personnel changes in hundreds of local
police departments and cost the state millions of dollars.
   It followed months of negotiations between the Justice Department
and the state personnel department, which designed and administered
the test. The Justice Department filed the lawsuit Wednesday after
talks broke down, agency spokesman Mark Weaver said in Washington.
   ``We realize there could be a substantial cost to the state, but
that's the price you pay when you discriminate,'' Weaver said.
``These people need to be held accountable.''
   ``The Justice Department is running true to form in discussing
things with the press before they let the principals know,'' said
Eugene McCaffrey Jr., the state commissioner of personnel who
oversees New Jersey civil service positions. ``It's a non-biased,
valid test.'' McCaffrey was named in the lawsuit.
   According to the action, federal officials have sought to change
the test because it discriminates against blacks, Hispanics and
women. The three groups have failed at a higher rate than white
males, the lawsuit said.
   Parts of the physical and written test have no bearing on
measuring qualifications to be a police officer, the action alleged.
   Weaver declined to provide statistics to support the claims, and
would not cite specific examples from the test because of the
pending litigation.
   The state's police examination is used to select candidates for
appointment to entry-level police positions by the state and more
than 250 municipalities.
   Deputy Personnel Commissioner Robert J. Hartman, the former
director of examinations for the department, denied the test is
discriminatory but said state officials have been working with the
Justice Department to change it. He said the lawsuit surprised him
because he thought negotiations were going smoothly.
   ``If there's any way I could accept anything they have to offer,
without lowering our standards, I'd grab it,'' Hartman said. ``But I
couldn't afford to just go out and sign the first consent order they
gave me. That's why we've been negotiating.''
   He said the stumbling blocks to a settlement included the Justice
Department's insistence on invalidating all examinations since 1984.
Hartman suggested that would hurt minority group members who already
are on lists of those who have passed the test, since police
departments hire from those lists.
   The examination has remained largely the same for about five
years, and 5,000 to 6,000 people have taken it each year, Hartman
said. About half that number failed.
   The Justice Department is pressing for reinstatement of people
who would have been hired had they passed the test since 1984, with
full back pay and seniority.
   Settlement cost could run into millions of dollars, mostly paid
by local police departments, Hartman said.
   ``I don't think for a minute this thing's ever going to get to
trial. We're too close,'' he said. ``But we're going to have big
problems if it does go and we lose.''

   President Roh Tae-woo today asked the
nation to forgive his predecessor, Chun Doo-hwan, and promised
amnesty and compensation for political prisoners jailed under Chun's
rule.
   ``I will liquidate past wrongdoings and carry out bold reforms in
the government and governing party in the quest of a new era,'' Roh
said in a nationwide television address.
   Roh pledged a major shuffle of the government and governing
Democratic Justice Party and a revision of undemocratic laws to
prevent more abuses.
   But opponents immediately rejected Roh's appeal and said Chun
must fully account for abuses during his seven-year term. Both major
opposition parties called for a full investigation.
   Thousands of dissidents and radical students braved freezing
temperatures and staged street protests in Seoul to demand that Chun
be arrested and punished.
   Students hurling firebombs and rocks clashed with riot police in
central Seoul. Police armored vans fired volleys of tear gas to
drive back students.
   ``Arrest Chun Doo-hwan. Punish Roh Tae-woo,'' protesters yelled.
   KBS, the state broadcasting system, said about 5,000 people took
part in the protests. Thousands of riot police blocked the students
as they tried to march through the center of the city.
   Police had no immediate word on injuries or arrests. Several
police officers were set on fire by firebombs.
   Roh stopped short of granting Chun a pardon, but he said any
prosecution of the former ruler would be unfair political
retribution.
   ``When he himself apologized deeply, how can we stone the former
president alone on the grounds that there were many mistakes in the
past?'' Roh said.
   Chun, a former general who took power with military backing in
1980, went into internal exile Wednesday after apologizing to the
nation for corruption and other abuses under his government. He
stepped down in February at the end of a seven-year term.
   Chun said he took full responsibility for misdeeds under his
government. He said he was surrendering all his property, including
about $24 million, in efforts to atone.
   Chun, living in a remote Buddhist monastery on the east coast,
listened to Roh's speech on radio but had no comment, an aide said.
   Roh, a former general and once close ally of Chun, is trying to
defuse public anger against Chun without damaging his own
administration.
   The Roh government is closely identified with Chun's
administration. The president took office in February after a split
in the opposition enabled him to win elections in December.
   Roh said the government would take the lead in exposing past
abuses and a special unit would be set up for that purpose. But he
also said he wanted the sensational hearings by the National
Assembly into Chun's government to end by the end of the year.
   The hearings have galvanized South Korea and helped fuel
anti-government protests.
   Roh said he would grant amnesty to political prisoners jailed
under Chun and restore the civil rights of those already freed. He
said ``generosity'' would be shown to opponents arrested under his
government.
   Government officials said the cases of 266 prisoners convicted of
political offenses or facing trial were being reviewed and as many
as possible would be freed around Dec. 10. Opposition parties
contend about 1,000 political prisoners are held.
   Roh also promised compensation for victims of the 1980 uprising
in the southern city of Kwangju, which was suppressed by the army
with the deaths of about 200 people. He also promised compensation
and exoneration for people killed or dismissed for political reasons
under Chun.
   He said political party funds would be put under open supervision
to prevent abuses, officials and politicians would not be allowed to
force businesses to make political contributions, special favors for
businesses would be ended, and undemocratic laws would be revised or
removed, including the harsh national security laws.
   Chun has denied any personal corruption, but some of his
associates and relatives have been convicted or charged with
misappropriating millions of dollars in government funds. Many of
the charges involve raising secret political funds, often by forcing
businesses to make donations.
   Roh said he would enforce law and order and said the violent
activities of radical students and labor activists will not be
tolerated.
   Radical students and dissidents calling for the arrest of Chun
have clashed several times with riot police in Seoul and other
cities in recent days. The radicals contend Roh is a continued front
for military rule and have called for his fall.

<HEAD>Man Found Guilty In Shooting Death Of Daughter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ELIZABETH CITY, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man who a psychologist testified
has multiple personalities has been found guilty of first-degree
murder in the shooting death of his 19-year-old daughter a year ago.
   A Camden County jury returned its verdict against Thomas Lee
Bonney on Friday. His daughter, Kathy Carol Bonney was found dead
last November along the Dismal Swamp Canal, just south of the North
Carolina-Virginia border.
   Bonney, 45, of Chesapeake, Va., pleaded innocent by reason of
insanity, saying he suffered from a multiple personality disorder
and that one of his nine other personalities was in control at the
time of the shooting.
   Bonney revealed the personas of ``Satan,'' his dead grandmother
and three other of his 10 personalities in videotaped interviews
with Dr. Paul F. Dell, a psyuchiatrist retained by the defense.
   ``You're just a mortal,'' Bonney growled during one session under
hypnosis with Dell, a professor at Norfolk's Eastern Virginia
Medical School. ``You don't know nothing.''
   The jury will return Monday to consider whether Bonney should
receive the death penalty or life imprisonment.
   ``I'm pleased with the jury's verdict,'' District Attorney H.P.
Williams said. ``It shows we did our work, although we've got a lot
more work to do before next week's hearing.''
   Bonney's court-appointed defense attorneys left the courthouse
without comment.
   Williams had argued that Bonney deliberately killed his daughter
out of a possessive anger over her relationship with a married man.
   Hours before the verdict was announced, Bonney tried to escape
while deputies were taking him to the jail. Bonney jumped from the
car and fled about 50 feet before he was grabbed by the deputies,
said Pasquotank County Sheriff Davis Sawyer.

<HEAD>Thunderstorms In Mississippi Valley; Snow in West</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Thunderstorms spread into the lower Mississippi Valley today
after unleashing a twister and hail as big as baseballs in Texas.
Light snow fell in the West.
   Showers and thunderstorms prevailed from eastern Texas to much of
Arkansas and Missouri and Iowa and Illinois. Strong thunderstorms
extended across western Arkansas and eastern Texas.
   A tornado watch was in effect this morning for parts of Texas,
Arkansas, and Louisiana after a twister was reported in northeast
Texas Friday evening.
   Thunderstorms produced baseball-sized hail at Wills Point, Texas,
as well as large hail in eastern Oklahoma and high winds which
downed trees and power lines in western Arkansas.
   The storms produced locally heavy rains. Flooding was reported in
New Boston, Texas, which was drenched by 3 inches.
   The low-pressure system over eastern Kansas this morning that was
largely responsible for the severe weather in the south central
United States was also generating snow and gusty winds in the upper
Midwest.
   Winter storm warnings were in effect for much of Minnesota
through Sunday. Up to 10 inches of snow were forecast, as were winds
of 20 to 40 mph, which could reduce visibility and cause
considerable drifting of snow.
   Winter storm warnings or watches were in effect for parts of the
Dakotas and Wisconsin for today and tonight, and snow advisories
were in effect for parts of Iowa, Nebraska and Kansas.
   Snow advisories were in effect this morning for the western
plains of Montana, the mountains and western valleys of Utah, the
northern and central mountains of Arizona, and the mountains and
northwest plateau of New Mexico.
   Today's forecast called for severe thunderstorms and tornadoes
from eastern Texas to the central Gulf Coast states, with a lesser
threat of severe weather in Tennessee and the lower Ohio Valley;
rain across much of the Great Lakes region; snow from the upper
Mississippi Valley to the middle Missouri Valley, with the heaviest
snow expected in central and southern Minnesota; and scattered snow
from the northern Rockies to the Arizona mountains.
   High temperatures were predicted in the 60s or 70s across much of
the nation east of the Mississippi River; 30s or 40s generally west
of the Mississippi; 40s and 50s from New England into the lower
Great Lakes; 80s in southern Florida and southern Texas; 20s in the
northern Rockies and Wyoming; 50s to 70s from northwest Texas into
south central and eastern Texas, and the lower two-thirds of the
lower Mississippi Valley; 60s from the central and Southern

   Barbara Moore is hoping the showmanship that
earned her the nickname ``Squeek'' will help put her in the record
books.
   And she wants it to be under ``The Greatest Number of Songs
Played from Memory'' in the next Guinness Book of World Records.
   After three weeks of monitored piano playing in Philadelphia, Ms.
Moore had fallen a little short of her goal: to play 2,000 songs
from memory. The effort began Oct. 25 and ended Nov. 13.
   ``I only got to 1,852, but as far as I know, I'm the first person
to ever try to set a record (for Guinness) in this category,'' she
said.
   Ms. Moore, a 49-year-old elementary school music teacher, made up
a computer printout listing 2,000 songs she knew by heart. Judges
for the event called out those songs and critiqued her playing,
determining whether she knew each song down to the last note.
   Ms. Moore graduated from Ashland High School in 1957 and went on
to Oberlin College, then earned a master's at Catholic University in
Washington, D.C. She has performed throughout the world, ranging
from the Grand Teton Music Festival to accompanying the New Zealand
Ballet to playing in restaurants and private homes in the
Philadelphia area.
   Now on sabbatical from her teaching job, Ms. Moore is studying
computer-assisted electronic music at West Chester University in
Pennsylvania.
   ``I was glad to get it over with. My brain was tired of
remembering. My hands weren't tired, but after two weeks, and with
all the good songs gone, it got harder,'' she said.

<DATELINE>PEORIA, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   House Minority Leader Robert H. Michel gave a
tearful apology to black ministers for racial remarks he made on
television and one clergyman says his conciliatory tone was genuine.
   ``He was very heartfelt in saying he made a mistake,'' said the
Rev. Harold Dawson, president of the Southside Pastors Association.
   ``I don't think those tears were phony,'' Dawson said. ``I think
Congressman Michel will make a sincere effort to do things
differently.''
   In an interview two weeks ago on the ``USA Today'' television
show, Michel reminisced about his days as an amateur singer in
Peoria. He imitated the Amos and Andy comedy team and sang a few
bars of ``Old Man River,'' saying he still wanted to use the song's
original lyrics which referred to blacks as ``niggers.''
   In the interview, Michel, R-Ill., went on to say, ``It's too bad
that ... we can't do some of the things that were part of our
heritage.''
   After Friday's meeting, Michel told reporters that the ministers
had given him a list of problems and concerns facing the black
community.
   ``We're going to turn a negative into a positive for the
community,'' he said.
   Michel first apologized for his remarks shortly after the show
aired.
   ``When I saw the tape I felt, oh brother, why did I do that?'' he
said. ``My remarks were completely wrong and insensitive.''
   Friday's two-hour meeting was open only to the ministers, Michel,
his aide Ray Lahood, and Michel's son, Scott.

   Officials were trying to determine what
was wrong with a Thanksgiving-style eaten by a 61-year-old
psychiatric patient who died, another who was in intensive care and
nearly 100 other people who fell ill.
   The victims were part of a group of about 200 outpatients from
Rockland Psychiatric Center in Nyack, Westchester County Health
Department spokeswoman Nancy McPartlin said Friday.
   The meals were prepared by a caterer and served Wednesday at
facilities in Mount Vernon, Yonkers and Tuckahoe, all north of New
York City.
   The 61-year-old woman, an outpatient at the center's Mount Vernon
facility who was not identified, died early Friday at Mount Vernon
Hospital after suffering food poisoning symptoms, including vomiting
and diarrhea, Ms. McPartlin said.
   The woman also suffered a heart attack, the spokeswoman said.
``We're not sure if it was brought on by the food poisoning.''
   Nearly 100 people were stricken, including 26 who required
hospitalization, according to Ms. McPartlin.
   The meals were prepared at an Iona College cafeteria in New
Rochelle that the Health Department closed and was inspecting, she
said.
   More than two dozen Iona students ate leftovers Wednesday from
the meal of turkey, stuffing and other traditional items, then went
home for the holiday weekend, Ms. McPartlin said.
   ``We want students who may suffer any symptoms to go immediately
to a doctor or an emergency room and to notify us,'' she said.
   ``So far we haven't heard from any of them,'' said Joseph Cullen,
a college spokesman.
   The food was prepared by Flik International of Mamaroneck.
   ``We will do everything we can to get to the bottom of this and
we are investigating every aspect,'' said company President Ruediger
Flik.

<HEAD>Israeli Soldier Wounded In Bomb Attack, Four Arabs Shot</HEAD>

   A Palestinian hurled a homemade bomb today at an
Israeli army patrol in the occupied West Bank town of Ramallah,
slightly injuring one soldier, the military command said.
   Arab witnesses said up to 150 Palestinians were detained after
the attack.
   Clashes today between stone-throwing Palestinians and troops in
the occupied Gaza Strip left three 14-year-old youths with shotgun
wounds to the legs at the Nuseirat refugee camp and Gaza Strip
village of Zawaydah, officials at Gaza's Ahli Arab Hospital said.
   A 16-year-old Palestinian who was seriously wounded in the head
was transferred from Shifa Hospital to an Israeli hospital, the
doctors said.
   An Arab reporter in Gaza said Palestinians clashed with troops in
Nuseirat and at an open-air market in Rafah. He said soldiers fired
tear gas and rubber bullets and that seven girls and women aged 15
to 25 suffered slight injuries. That report could be immediately
confirmed.
   After the bombing, patrols opened fire on the assailant. Troops
closed the area and conducted searches, arresting several suspects,
the army said.
   The bomb was thrown at an army jeep near several other military
vehicles in the central square, they said. The residents said troops
fired about 50 rounds of ammunition, mostly in the air.
   They said troops closed the area and grabbed 100 to 150
Palestinians, making them sit on the ground close to the site of the
attack.
   In a related development, a U.N. report released Friday decried
what it termed growing human rights abuses and frequent use of
violence by Israeli soldiers fighting the Palestinian rebellion.
   Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar wrote, ``The overall
situation in the occupied Palestinian territories has worsened.
Civilian deaths and injuries continue to be widespread and so do
other serious violations of human rights.''
   He said he was ``deeply distressed'' by the high number of
casualties and by Israeli measures such as deportation,
administrative detention, curfews and razing of houses. He said such
measures can only aggravate tension.
   At least 315 Palestinians and 11 Israelis have been killed and
more than 7,000 wounded since the uprising against the 21-year
Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip began Dec. 8.

Accord</HEAD>

   Oil prices soared more than 10 percent as
OPEC ministers awaited word from Iran on whether it would ratify a
proposed six-month oil reduction accord.
   The ministers of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries planned to return tonight to Vienna to resume their winter
conference in hopes of formally approving a pact to slash the
cartel's rampant oil production from more than 22 million barrels a
day estimated now to 18.5 million barrels daily.
   In response to the tentative accord, futures price for January
delivery of Brent, the benchmark North Sea crude, jumped $1.65 a
barrel to $14.42 Friday in London trading.
   U.S. petroleum exchanges closed early Wednesday for the four-day
Thanksgiving holiday, but analysts said U.S. markets would match the
European gains if the OPEC ministers signed a final accord over the
weekend.
   Futures prices on the New York Mercantile Exchange closed
slightly higher Wednesday in anticipation OPEC would reach some sort
of agreement. The contract for January delivery of West Texas
Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude, closed 11 cents
higher at $13.97 a barrel.
   One of the key provisions of the pact would grant Iraq production
parity with its Persian Gulf enemy Iran, something Iran had fought
bitterly. However, the proposal also reportedly would allow Iran to
increase its production and maintain its 14 percent share of OPEC
production.
   Analysts said they expect an agreement to bolster prices in the
short term, but said they doubted the accord would last long enough
to boost prices to OPEC's target of $18 a barrel.
   Iranian Oil Minister Gholamreza Aghazadeh flew Friday to Tehran
to consult with his government, which signed a cease-fire with Iraq
in August to halt their eight-year war.
   Aghazadeh said in Tehran today that he will consult with Iran's
Cabinet on Sunday about how to respond to the proposed OPEC
production ceiling, Tehran Radio said in a report monitored in
Cyprus.
   Even if the 13 nations sign the plan, analysts are uncertain it
could hold.
   Recent cheating on cartel quotas has added to the glut of oil on
the market, driving down prices.
   William Byers, an analyst at Bear, Stearns & Co. in New York,
said, ``We don't know if OPEC nations are going to adhere to an
agreement.''
   ``If so,'' he said, ``prices could go higher, but that's an
assumption that's premature to make.''
   Steve Hanke, economics professor at Johns Hopkins University in
Baltimore, said, ``Cheating could occur right from day one. And in
fact, there's every reason to believe it will.''
   Fergus MacLeod, an oil analyst with Barclays de Zoete Wedd in
London, said he doubted whether the price of West Texas Intermediate
would climb beyond $17 a barrel.
   Each rise of $1 in the price of crude oil theoretically means a
pickup of 2.5 cents a gallon in retail gasoline prices, although oil
companies do not always pass along the full increase.
   MacLeod said, ``In terms of its impact on prices at the gas pump,
you may not get a direct feedthrough from the increase in oil
prices. It's difficult to pass on the full increase,'' he said.
   Ian Graham, an analyst at the London brokerage County NatWest,
noted companies had not reduced gasoline prices when oil prices
slumped.
   ``There seems little justification for increasing them on the way
back up,'' he said.
   The ministers began their winter meeting Monday and then recessed
for closed-door negotiations to try to end a bitter dispute between
rivals Iran and Iraq.
   Iraq had been demanding an equal production quota in any new
accord with Iran, but Aghazadeh had said no.
   It appears that the production agreement will give each country
the same quota at 2.64 million barrels a day.
   Iran now has a cap of 2.4 million barrels a day.
   Iraq was given a ceiling of 1.5 million barrels in the current
pact, but has ignored it. Analysts estimate its production at 2.7
million barrels a day.
   To cut the deal, the ministers agreed to let Iran pump more oil,
while paring other countries' output levels to meet the new quotas.
   The other countries agreed to give up some of their production
share to make up Iraq's quota, but details were not disclosed.
   OPEC members are Algeria, Ecuador, Gabon, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq,
Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates
and Venezuela.

   A fire broke out today aboard a North
Sea oil rig supply ship, but all 10 crew members were rescued by a
helicopter, officials said. No injuries were reported.
   The crew of the 2,750-ton Felderntor sent a distress signal to
the coast guard at 5:20 a.m., after discovering the fire in the
engine room, according to officials of the Offshore Supply
Association, the ship's owner.
   The ship was 80 miles northeast of Peterhead, in northern
Scotland, when the fire started.
   The crew members, including four West Germans and six Britons,
were rescued from the ship by a helicopter, said the
British-registered company, which is owned by the West German firm
Offshore Marine Service GMBH.
   The fire was brought under control as the ship was towed toward
Aberdeen, where it was to arrive Sunday, the company said.

<HEAD>Iraq and Iran Exchange More POWs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iraq and Iran exchanged 69 disabled soldiers
today, but both countries returned fewer prisoners of war than
promised under an agreement worked out by the International Red
Cross.
   Red Cross officials in Baghdad told The Associated Press Iran
sent only 51 Iraqi prisoners and Iraq reciprocated by returning just
18 Iranians.
   The Red Cross refused to comment on why the Tehran government
repatriated 51 prisoners, at least 34 less than promised in the
agreement on a 10-day exchange covering up to 1,570 prisoners.
   The first group of the sick and disabled POWs was repatriated
Thursday. Both nations returned fewer prisoners than promised on
that day, too.
   Tehran Radio, monitored in Nicosia, said that some prisoners it
had intended to return were no longer sick or wounded, some had to
be kept back for further medical examinations and others chose not
to be repatriated.
   The official Iraqi News Agency said Iraq repatriated just 18
prisoners instead of the promised 41 because of the Iranian action.
   With the prisoners sent back Thursday, 103 Iraqis and 37 Iranians
have been repatriated, flown back aboard a plane specially chartered
by the Red Cross.
   Before the latest round of repatriations, the two sides had
exchanged 765 Iraqi sick and wounded POWs and 613 Iranians since
1981. The Red Cross has registered 50,182 Iraqi POWs and 19,284
Iranians, but the total number of POWs is estimated at 100,000.
   Iran and Iraq started peace talks under United Nations auspices
five days after an Aug. 20 cease-fire went into effect in their
eight-year war. The talks have made no progress. The agreement with
the Red Cross on exchanging disabled POWs, signed earlier this
month, came outside the framework of the peace talks.
   In Iraq, the head of the legal department of the foreign
ministry, Akram Al-Witri, said that Iraq will continue repatriating
Iranian sick and wounded POWs, but insisted the exchange will be
based on reciprocity. ``We will send them the same proportion of the
number they will send us,'' he said.
   He said Iraq is not convinced by claims that some of the
prisoners have opted to stay in Iran or have been cured of their
illness.
   ``The Red Cross did not provide us with authentiticated papers
that they have asked to stay in Iran or not to return back home,''
he said.
   Al-Witri said it is doubtful the sick Iraqi POWs that Iran
claimed were cured have been treated because all were listed with
chronic disabilities in previous reports given to Iraq.

<HEAD>Bodies Of Missing Bar Hostesses In Aquino Assassination Exhumed</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: New thruout to UPDATE with eight arrested in massacre. No
pickup.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>CAPAS, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Authorities today exhumed the skeletons
of two bar hostesses allegedly killed in a military cover-up of the
1983 assassination of Benigno Aquino, the husband of President
Corazon Aquino.
   Also today, the military said the massacre this week of 17 people
in a remote mountain village was caused in part by a dispute over a
local cult.
   The remains of the two hostesses were taken to Manila for further
tests to determine if they really are those of two sisters closely
identified with the man originally thought to be the killer of
former Sen. Aquino, according to officials of the National Bureau of
Investigation.
   Aquino was shot to death on Aug. 21, 1983, at the Manila
International Airport as soldiers escorted him out of a plane that
flew him home from three years of self-imposed exile in the United
States.
   The slaying triggered protests leading to the February 1986
civilian-military uprising that toppled Ferdinand Marcos' 20-year
regime and swept Aquino's widow to power.
   Marcos and his military claimed Aquino was killed by Rolando
Galman, an alleged communist agent whom soldiers shot dead at the
airport immediately after Aquino was shot.
   But a civilian board that investigated the slaying concluded
Aquino was killed by one of his military escorts and that Galman was
simply used as a scapegoat. It described Galman as an underworld
character who was in and out of jail because of his links to some
military officials.
   The bodies were exhumed from a sugarcane field just outside
Capas,60 miles north of Manila. The burial pit was pinpointed by
five militiamen who claimed unidentified military officers ordered
them to bury the women in December 1986.
   The sisters, Anna and Catherine Oliva, were hostesses at a bar
frequented by Galman. They disappeared in September 1986.
   Officials said the five unidentified militiamen also pointed to
an area nearby as the place where they buried Galman's wife Lina and
cousin Rogelio Taruc in January 1984. The two were last seen being
led away from their homes by suspected soldiers wearing civilian
clothes.
   Galman's daughter Rosalinda said her mother told her as she was
led away that she was being ``invited'' by Gen. Fabian Ver, then the
military chief of staff and Marcos' most trusted general.
   Prosecutor Raul Gonzales said all four people were silenced
because they knew Galman intimately and were aware of his ties to
some military officers.
   Ver and 25 others were acquitted of murder charges in December
1975. But a new Supreme Court constituted after Mrs. Aquino came to
power ruled the first trial was manipulated by Marcos and ordered a
new trial. The number of defendants has increased to 40, most of
them soldiers.
   The military held a news conference in Cebu City today to present
nine people accused of participating in a massacre Tuesday in Bagtik
village. Gunmen killed 17 people and wounded 12 in an attack on the
chapel of a religious cult known as ``Katoliko Largo'' or ``Straight
Catholics.''
   The confessed leader of the attack said a cultist's refusal to
have sex with her husband led to the massacre, but the military
insisted that communist rebels also took part in the attack.
   ``I regret what I have done,'' Pelagio Caro said when he and the
eight other suspects were presented in Cebu City, 360 miles
southeast of Manila. The suspects, arrested Friday, will be charged
with murder, the military said.
   The military said Caro told investigators he resented his wife's
rejection of his sexual advances after she joined the cult and
``planned to do something about it.'' He said sex was forbidden by
the cult unless approved by its priest, Gervasio Sarita, a man in
his late 60s who was killed.
   The military said Caro and other villagers who opposed the cult
sought the help of a ``Commander Bador'' of the communist New
People's Army, who provided the arms and some of men for the attack
on the cult.
   Caro said the group wanted to punish only Gervasio and cult
founder and leader Cresencia Hermosilia, who was wounded in the
thigh. Caro said the group didn't intend a massacre and only fired
when cultists pelted them with stones.

   Four people were killed and a fifth was

   Killed were a woman, believed to be in her early 40s, her two
sons, ages 12 and 22, and a visitor, a 21-year-old man, said Gary
Kaldun, a Hennepin County medical examiner's investigator. Another
visitor, the 21-year-old man's twin brother, was critically injured.
   Names were being withheld pending notification of relatives.
   The two young men were pronounced dead at the scene, Kaldun said.
The 12-year-old boy was dead on arrival at Hennepin County Medical
Center and his mother died after arriving at the hospital, an
emergency room nurse said.
   The woman and child appeared to have died from smoke inhalation,
said the nurse, who declined to be identified. She said doctors were
working on the fifth person in the emergency room.
   The fire at the two-story, wood-frame duplex, which is two blocks
from a fire station, was reported about 4:30 a.m. and brought under
control within an hour.
   The second floor, where the victims were found, was gutted and
the stairway charred.

<HEAD>Gorbachev Convenes Presidium To Discuss Estonia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev today convened a
meeting of the country's highest executive body to consider
Estonia's challenge to centralized Kremlin controls, Tass reported.
   The official news agency said the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet
was to discuss proposed constitutional amendments that have drawn
strong opposition in the Baltic republic of Estonia and other Soviet
republics. Gorbachev is chairman of the executive body.
   The Supreme Soviet, the national parliament, is to meet Tuesday
to consider amendments that would establish a Council of People's
Deputies, which would elect a legislature and a president with
enhanced powers.
   On Nov. 16, Estonia's Supreme Soviet denounced the changes that
would centralize power and passed a ``declaration of sovereignty''
in all areas but defense and foreign policy. It also approved an
amendment to the republic's constitution requiring Estonian approval
of all new Soviet laws.
   Official Radio Moscow said today's session will consider the
constitutionality of Estonia's action.
   On Nov. 19, two national parliamentary commissions found the
declarations to be at odds with the Soviet Constitution, and passed
its recommendations on to the Presidium.
   The policy-making Communist Party Central Committee is to meet
Monday to consider the issue in preparation for the Soviet Supreme
session, Tass said.
   The constitutional amendments proposed by Gorbachev face strong
opposition not only in Estonia, but also in the two other Baltic
republics of Latvia and Lithuania.
   Baltic activists, who are pushing for greater political, cultural
and economic autonomy under the banner of Gorbachev's reforms, say
the constitutional amendments would take away some of their power
rather than grant them greater local control.
   Activists in the southern republics of Georgia and Armenia say
the legislatures there also have rejected the amendments.
   The Kremlin has expressed a willingness to compromise on the
issue.
   Earlier this week, a legislative panel recommended that the
proposed Council of People's Deputies not be given power to throw
out laws adopted by the republics. On Thursday, the ruling Communist
Party Politburo noted that the bills could be ``substantially
improved.''
   Radio Moscow said the Presidium received 200,000 letters about
the amendments. It said most exprssed approval, but many suggested
changes.
   ``As a result, many provisions have been improved,'' Radio Moscow
said.

   Rival Shiite militiamen fought fierce
street battles today for control of Moslem districts in west Beirut.
   Amal, the pro-Syrian militia, pushed the Iranian-backed
fundamentalist Hezbollah, or Party of God, out of most of west
Beirut on the second day of street fighting, police reported.
   A police spokesman said 25 people were killed and 54 wounded in
the last 24 hours in the fighting between Hezbollah and Amal, Arabic
for hope.
   That raised the overall toll to 35 dead and 74 wounded since the
confrontation began in Beirut's southern slums on Wednesday. The
conflict for dominance of Lebanon's 1 million Shiites moved into the
central city Friday.
   Also today, the International Committee of the Red Cross began
withdrawing its Swiss staff from Lebanon, 10 days after a delegate
was kidnapped in south Lebanon. Red Cross sources, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, said the organization will shut down the
all-Swiss organization's operation throughout Lebanon if Peter
Winkler is not released by Dec. 3.
   Syrian troops moved into the city's Moslem sector Feb. 22, 1987,
to end militia chaos. But the 12,000 Syrian troops have done little
to interfere in the Shiite rivalry since it spilled out of the
city's southern slums Friday.
   ``We have no orders to intervene and put an end to the
fighting,'' a Syrian officer in Hamra said.
   Syrian soldiers manned their sandbagged checkpoints as usual. A
group in the Zokak Blatt area _ where the militias were fighting _
sat eating breakfast, drinking tea and smoking early today.
   A car filled with gunmen approached the checkpoint and quietly
crossed it. The Syrian soldiers watched and said nothing.
   The Christian Voice of Lebanon radio lashed out at the Syrians,
saying ``the whole justification for Syria's military presence in
west Beirut has collapsed. The Syrians cannot keep peace.''
   Both sides deployed mortars, rocket-propelled grenade-launchers
and .50-caliber machine guns across west Beirut's neighborhoods,
police said.
   Amal-Hezbollah clashes were particularly fierce in the gutted
hotel district of central Beirut and the adjacent former Jewish
quarter that has been taken over by Shiite squatters since the start
of the 13-year civil war.
   Stray shells hit several residential apartments, setting them on
fire and forcing panic-stricken residents to take cover in basements
and bomb shelters.
   Fires raged out of control in several buildings and cars as
firefighters could not reach the confrontation areas due to
intensity of the clashes, the police spokesman said.
   Smoke billowed from the Arab Academy, a private secondary school
in Zokak Blatt district, as Amal militiamen hammered it with dozens
of mortar rounds.
   The Amal-Hezbollah clashes broke out in Beirut a few days after
Hezbollah held Amal responsible for an abortive attempt to
assassinate four senior Hezbollah leaders with a car bomb in east
Lebanon.
   Amal had accused Hezbollah of assassinating its three militia
commanders for south Lebanon in an ambush in south Beirut two months
ago.
   Three International Committee of the Red Cross left Lebanon today
for Geneva, leaving about 28 in the country. The three had worked in
the Red Cross' Sidon office, which was closed Wednesday to protest
Winkler's abduction there.
   The office helped the war disabled and visited detainees held by
Israel. The Red Cross staffers are the only group of foreigners that
has stayed on in Moslem west Beirut and south Lebanon despite the
waves of kidnappings that forced all foreigners out of the country
in the last four years.
   Winkler, 32, was kidnapped by three unidentified gunmen Nov. 17.
No group claimed responsibility.

   The government on Saturday barred new
foreign missionaries, saying the country has enough religious
workers.
   A spokesman for the Ministry of Religious Affairs said the action
exempts foreign theologians who would train Indonesians.
   Foreign missionaries working in Indonesia for the last 10 years
will be allowed to stay another year, the spokesman added.
   ``If they decide to stay, the opportunity will be opened to them
to become Indonesian citizens through naturalization,'' he said.
   About 700 foreign missionaries now work in Indonesia, down from
1,000 in 1982.
   About 78 percent of Indonesians are Moslem; 11 percent are
Christian and smaller percentages are Buddhist and Hindu.

   A fire aboard a Soviet cruise liner that killed 11
people in May has been traced to a passenger's use of a heater to
make a cup of coffee, the official news agency Tass reported.
   Y. Dubinin ``decided to make coffee, put an immersion heater into
a glass of water, switched it on and fell asleep,'' Tass said in a
brief dispatch without elaborating.
   The news agency said Friday that Dubinin faces criminal charges
and could be sent to prison for up to three years.
   The fire broke out May 17 on the cruise liner Priamurye while the
ship was on a stopover in the Japanese port of Osaka.
   The liner was carrying 295 Soviet tourists on a youth cruise
around Japan, and 129 crew members. Tass said the fire caused nearly
$1.6 million in damage.

   Riot police fired barrages of tear gas
Saturday to stop thousands of protesters who tried to march to the
presidential palace after President Roh Tae-woo asked forgiveness
for his disgraced predecessor.
   About 5,000 radical students and dissidents marched in freezing
weather, calling for the arrest and punishment of ex-president Chun
Doo-hwan for abuses under his authoritarian rule.
   Protesters hurled firebombs and rocks in clashes with some of the
15,000 riot police who flooded the city.
   ``Arrest Chun Doo-hwan! Punish Roh Tae-woo!'' enraged protesters
yelled.
   Several police officers were set on fire by firebombs, but police
had no word on casualties or arrests.
   Radical groups, which have little public backing, have been
trying to use the Chun issue to generate opposition to the Roh
government. Onlookers showed few signs of support for the radicals
Saturday and the march appeared smaller than protests last week.
   Roh appealed on television for an end to the crisis surrounding
Chun and asked for mercy for the former president, who went into
internal exile Wednesday after apologizing for corruption and other
abuses under his government.
   Chun, a former general who stepped down in February after a
seven-year term, said he was surrendering all his property,
including about $24 million. But he has denied any personal
corruption.
   Roh, also an ex-general and former ally of Chun, promised to
correct past government abuses and shake up the administration to
remove vestiges of the Chun era.
   ``I will liquidate past wrongdoings and carry out bold reforms in
the government and governing party in the quest of a new era,'' he
said.
   Roh stopped short of granting Chun a pardon but said any
prosecution of the former ruler would be unfair political
retribution.
   ``When he himself apologized deeply, how can we stone the former
president alone on the grounds that there were many mistakes in the
past?'' Roh said.
   Opposition parties immediately rejected Roh's appeal, saying Chun
should be investigated by the National Assembly and a special
prosecutor. Radical groups called for Roh's removal from office and
some demanded Chun commit suicide.
   ``Chun Doo-hwan is a coward who asks for forgiveness instead of
taking his own life to atone for his crimes,'' dissident leader Paik
Ki-wan told a rally.
   Paik urged people to march on the Blue House presidential
mansion. Riot police, dressed in green combat fatigues and black
visored helmets, blocked the way. Students hurled scores of
firebombs and rocks before being driven off by police armored vans
firing volleys of tear gas.
   Protesters burned an effigy draped in the U.S. flag. Speakers
said Roh and Chun were American puppets and demanded an end to U.S.
ties.
   ``Drive out Yankees!'' protesters chanted.
   Small, peaceful anti-Chun protests were also reported in the
provincial cities of Pusan, Chunchon, Taegu, Taejon and Andong.
   Roh said he will grant amnesty to political prisoners jailed
under Chun, who took power in 1980 with military backing. Roh also
promised to restore the civil rights of prisoners already freed.
   Government officials said the cases of 266 prisoners convicted of
political offenses or facing trial were being reviewed and many
would be freed around Dec. 10. Opposition parties contend there are
about 1,000 political prisoners.
   Roh also promised compensation for victims of the 1980 uprising
in the southern city of Kwangju and other people killed or dismissed
for political reasons under Chun. About 200 people died when the
army suppressed the uprising.

<BYLINE>Central Town, Embattled and Revived, is Symbol of Salvadoran War

<DATELINE>TENANCINGO, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If there is a battlefront in El
Salvador's unconventional civil war, it runs through this
successively bombed-out, deserted and revived town.
   Tenancingo has become a symbol of neutralism and a model for
broader resolution of nine years of strife that has claimed an
estmated 65,000 lives.
   An experimental European Economic Community program has funded
more than $200,000 and spent three years trying to revive the town.
But as one phase of the program ends next month, Tenancingo's
political direction and economic survival remain an object of
speculation and contention.
   ``I'm afraid,'' admitted Mayor Blanca Paz Vasquez, who was
abducted by rebels earlier this year.
   In 1983, the Tenancingo area was one of the most embattled
sectors in the country. That September, the guerrillas took the town.
   The air force bombed and strafed Tenancingo for several hours,
killing at least 50 people and destroying 60 percent of the town.
Its nearly 10,000 people _ mostly peasant farmers _ fled.
   With the backing of Fundasal, the European-funded private
foundation, about 2,000 residents returned in February 1986. Nearly
1,000 have joined them since.
   As part of the return, the U.S.-backed government and the
Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front reached an unprecedented
church-mediated accord under which neither side would establish a
permanent presence in or near the town.
   The objective was to ensure Tenancingo's neutrality to allow it
to rebuild and prosper.
   Fundasal oversaw the election of local authorities and, with
them, has run the town's services and administration.
   The power lines are back up, drinking water runs into homes and
the few shops. Many tile-roofed one-story buildings lining the
cobbled streets have been painted, though most still exhibit
pockmarks from bullets and sharpnel.
   Mrs. Paz Vasquez, who in May became the town's first mayor since
1983, is the focus of a dispute that has divided the nearly 3,000
residents. She recognizes the work the foundation has done, but says
the foundation's community council no longer has a reason to exist.
   She alleged that it maintains an alliance with the insurgents.
She claimed its supporters spread false rumors, such as her
purported intention to lobby for establishment of a permanent
military presence in town.
   Danilo Cabrera, the local director of Fundasal, rejects the
charges. He accused the mayor of arrogance and inability to work out
a smooth transition and acknowledges that the accord is eroding
daily.
   Army troops regularly patrol the town's outskirts. Though they do
not usually enter, on Wednesday about 30 government soldiers walked
through downtown or sat in the tree-shaded central plaza.
   The previous night, guerrillas entered to buy bread, fruit and
vegetables. Neither side's fighters spend the night, and clashes
around the town have been rare and brief.
   The townspeople's hearts and minds are the new battlefield.
   The soldiers wore black baseball-style caps with the word
``Opsic'' (Psychological operations) across the front. They were
inviting the people to a gathering where the military would
distribute medicine, seed and clothing.
   Since February, the guerrillas also have entered town with
increasing frequency to distribute leaflets and talk to residents.
   The rebels abducted Mrs. Paz Vasquez three days after she took
office May 1 and presented her to ``Comandante Ramiro.'' She and
Ramiro came to an agreement under which she would be allowed to
continue in office.
   ``He accompanied me back to the town and called a meeting in the
square. He said I would be allowed to work because I genuinely
wanted to help the people,'' said the 33-year-old mayor.
   The guerrilla front forbids mayoralties in areas it deems ``zones
of control.'' The guerrillas have assassinated five mayors during
the past two years.
   In June, another guerrilla chief visited the mayor, ordering her
to close her office and leave town. In July, the rebels distributed
leaflets saying they ``have nothing against any honest individual,''
but that once such a person takes up a government post, they become
an enemy.
   During a midday interview, they mayor's secretary stuck her head
through the office door and said: ``Here they come.''
   The mayor blanched, repeating incredulously, ``They're coming?''
   ``No, no. It's not that,'' the secretary assure her. Friends were
coming for lunch.
   In August, the mayor moved with her five children to San
Salvador, and now commutes nearly three hours each way from the
capital.
   ``I don't know how much longer I can keep this up,'' she said.
``If they give me a final warning, I guess I'll just pack up'' and
move the office.
   Despite the feuding between the town leaders and Fundasal,
everyone interviewed expressed the desire to maintain Tenancingo's
neutrality.
   Mercedes Franco, a 28-year-old farmworker, said: ``Seeing either
soldiers or guerrillas in town makes us afraid. Because we're the
ones who get caught in between.''

<HEAD>Robert Byrd Steps Down After Decades in Power</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE GOULD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Robert Carlyle Byrd, former butcher, grocer and
shipyard welder, quietly relinquishes one of the most powerful
elective offices in the nation this week.
   Byrd is stepping down as majority leader of the Senate, the 15th
person to hold that position. He leaves confident he has revitalized
the Senate's role in American government, but doubtful his successor
can stem growing complaints that life in the chamber isn't what it
should be.
   Tempered by poverty in the West Virginia coal fields where he was
raised early in the century, Byrd, who turned 71 last week, has
little sympathy for the complaints of younger men who see the Senate
as a cumbersome body that works too late, too often.
   ``We can't operate on a punch-the-clock basis,'' says Byrd, who
was elected to his sixth, 6-year term on Election Day. ``I did that
once _ when I was a welder in a shipyard.''
   His successor as leader of the Senate will be elected Tuesday
when the 55 Democratic senators of the 101st Congress gather for an
organizational meeting in the Capitol.
   The majority leader, a position formally recognized in 1911,
controls the Senate's schedule, including which bills are considered
and when they are debated.
   For the first time since his election as majority whip in 1971,
Byrd won't be running for a leadership role. But he won't be without
power, as he assumes the chairmanship of the Senate Appropriations
Committee and becomes president pro tempore _ the senior statesman _
of the Senate. That also puts him third in line for the presidency,
behind the vice president and the speaker of the House of
Representatives.
   ``I look back on my years as leader with satisfaction,'' the
silver-haired senator said in an interview in his Capitol office
suite last week. He has served as leader of his party in the Senate
since 1976, half that time as majority leader.
   ``I have brought the Senate back to where it is now a stronger
voice than it had been for a while,'' Byrd said. ``I have insisted
on checks and balances with the executive branch to make it a potent
and strong force.''
   In explaining how he ``revitalized the Senate's unique role,''
Byrd refers to the Senate's exhaustive work in approving President
Reagan's missile treaty with the Soviet Union and its rejection of
Robert Bork and subsequent approval of Anthony Kennedy for the
Supreme Court.
   Looking ahead, Byrd is skeptical about the election promises of
those seeking to replace him as majority leader.
   ``I don't intend to offer advice,'' Byrd says. ``They're all
three capable and expert on legislation and each has his own special
talents.''
   The three, Daniel Inouye of Hawaii, Bennett Johnston of Louisiana
and George Mitchell of Maine, each are promising to improve the
``quality of life'' in the Senate. By ``quality of life,'' they mean
to shorten a grueling regime of long hours and unpredictable
schedules.
   ``I believe first in the quality of work,'' Byrd said. ``One
can't adjust the needs of the nation to one's comfort.''
   He believes the task facing his replacement, and Congress in
general, is daunting.
   ``The hangover will soon be felt,'' Byrd said of the budget
deficit and national debt crises facing the Bush administration and
the Democratic-controlled 101st Congress.
   ``We've got a very terrible problem that will be overriding,''
Byrd says. ``Congress will work with Mr. Bush. But he has to show
leadership.
   ``He comes to the presidency a more knowledgable man, with a
respect for the federal government,'' Byrd says of the
president-elect.
   Byrd grimaces at the mention of the outgoing administration and
offers two observations of Ronald Reagan, who he has criticized
often for his confrontational approach to the Congress.
   ``One, he's a very charming and likable man. Second, he's going
to leave a legacy our children and grandchildren will pay for _ a
national debt. We were the world's greatest creditor eight years
ago, now we're the world's biggest debtor nation.''
   Looking back _ to before Reagan came on the Washington scene and
to his own beginnings in Congress _ Byrd says he holds two former
presidents in highest regard:
   ``My favorite Democratic president was Truman. I served under him
for 17 days,'' Byrd says, referring to the brief transition period
when he was taking his seat in the House of Representatives in 1953
and Harry Truman was turning the White House over to Dwight
Eisenhower.
   The Republican president he holds in highest regard was Richard
M. Nixon, a man he describes as ``very, very able, equipped to be
president. He understood government and he knew how to work with
Congress.''
   Byrd puts his retirement as majority leader in historic
perspective.
   A man who often takes to the Senate floor to quote poetry and
read history, Byrd says he is retiring, like Cincinnatus, the 5th
century B.C. Roman farmer-statesman who twice left his fields to
save Rome in crisis, only to return to the farm.
   Byrd isn't returning to any farm. But, he says with a smile:
   ``Like Cincinnatus, I'm going back to the plow.''

   Soldiers shot to death three Azerbaijanis for
violating a curfew in the city of Kirovabad, raising the death toll
from ethnic violence in the city this week to six, an official said
today.
   Chingiz Sadykhov, officer in charge of the Azerbaijani city's
Communist Party headquarters, said in a telephone interview that the
three were shot Friday for violating a strict, overnight curfew
imposed to quell disturbances between Azerbaijanis and Armenians in
the southern Soviet Union.
   Soldiers in tanks and personnel carriers continued to patrol the
streets, even though there had been no protests for the past two
days, he said.
   Three soldiers were killed in Kirovabad on Tuesday, after being
called in to protect the city's Armenian population from mobs of
Azerbaijanis.
   The Defense Ministry newspaper Krasnaya Zvezda said today they
were killed by a hand grenade thrown from a crowd.
   Sadykhov said about 120 people had been injured in the unrest.
   Protests ground to a halt today in the capital of Armenia under a
ban imposed by soldiers who were reported to be on nearly every
street corner and breaking up gatherings of even two or three people.
   ``There are soldiers patrolling everywhere, especially in the
center of the city,'' said Arpenay Popoyan, wife of activist Rafael
Popoyan in a telephone interview from the Armenian capital, Yerevan.
   ``If two or three people gather, the soldiers come and break them
up,'' she said. ``The patrols are very strict.''
   Mrs. Popoyan and correspondent Yuri Kankanyan of the official
Armenian news agency Armenpress said there were no protests or
meetings, which were banned by the military commandant under an
order establishing an overnight curfew.
   Most public transportation and stores were open, and ``no
excesses are evident,'' said Kankanyan.
   Musa Mamedov, information director for the Azerbaijani Foreign
Ministry in Baku, said in a telephone interview that demonstrations
continued in Baku but that there was no violence.
   Official Radio Moscow said the situation was ``relatively calm,''
despite attempts ``to provoke riots in several areas.''
   It said transport and shops were operating there as well. A
curfew remained in effect in Baku.
   Kankanyan said 500 Armenians, mostly women and children had
arrived in Yerevan from the Azerbaijani region of Nakhichevan, a
small enclave situated between Iran and Armenia, but that Armenians
were waiting for the first refugees to arrive from Kirovabad, site
of the worst violence this week.
   Mamedov denied reports of much higher death tolls from the
fighting in Armenia and Azerbaijan, including one cited by Soviet
human rights activist Andrei D. Sakharov, who said in the United
States that more than 130 Armenians had been killed. Sakharov, who
did not give the source for his figures, urged the Soviet government
to take measures to protect Armenians.
   Reports of high casualty tolls are rife in the Armenian community
in Yerevan and in Moscow, but they have not been confirmed. Mrs.
Popoyan said activists in Yerevan also could not confirm reports of
more than 100 deaths.
   Mamedov said the figure of 130 included injuries and deaths.
   He said the majority of those injured in Kirovabad were
Azerbaijanis hurt in clashes with soldiers.
   The latest fighting between Armenians and Azerbaijanis has
challenged President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reform efforts.
   Gorbachev, speaking in a joint interview with visiting President
Francois Mitterrand of France broadcast Friday night on French
television, said the unrest was part of ``perestroika,'' his
campaign to reform Soviet society.
   Animosity between Armenians, who are mostly Christian, and
Azerbaijanis, mostly Moslem, dates back hundreds of years in the
Caucasus region that now forms part of the Soviet border with Turkey
and Iran.
   Gorbachev said Soviet leaders would meet soon with delegations of
Armenians and Azerbaijanis seeking a ``solution that would conform
to the best interests of these two peoples and our country.''
   Ethnic conflict in the two Caucasus republics escalated in
February in a dispute over Nagorno-Karabakh, a territory with a
predominantly Armenian population that has been part of Azerbaijan
since 1923.
   Armenians held general strikes and mass demonstrations demanding
that the territory be annexed to Armenia, although they do not have
a common border, but Moscow did not approve it. A riot Feb. 28 in
the Azerbaijani city of Sumgait killed 32 people, 26 of them
Armenians.

<HEAD>Modern-Day Untouchables, After Court Triumph, Like Elliot Ness
Resemblance</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE LINDER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prosecutors are proud to be compared to
crime-busting Elliot Ness and his team of ``Untouchables'' following
a courtroom triumph that has gutted the leadership of organized
crime in Pennsylvania and southern New Jersey.
   They don't run around with machine guns and axes like Ness and
his men while fighting Chicago gangsters like Al Capone and busting
up monshine stills a half-century ago.
   And, says Joel Friedman, chief of the federal Organized Crime
Strike Force here: ``Elliot Ness was more a Lone Ranger against the
world, and that's not exactly what we are.''
   But they got a lot of satisfaction from the Nov. 19 jury
convictions of mob boss Nicodemo ``Little Nicky'' Scarfo and 16 La
Cosa Nostra associates on all charges in a racketeering conspiracy
that included nine murders, four attempted murders, drug dealing,
loan-sharking and illegal gambling.
   No sentencing date has been set, but Scarfo and his codefendants
all face possible sentences of 40 to 55 years in prison. Scarfo is
already serving a 14-year sentence for a 1987 extortion and
conspiracy conviction.
   Lead prosecutor Louis Pichini, 43, a grandson of Italian
immigrants, and his colleagues enjoy it if someone wants to link
them to Ness.
   ``It is a dream come true, especially for an Italian-Amerian
working in organized crime. Everybody has a dream to run for a
touchdown, or score the winning run, and this is what I've wanted
most in 15 years as a career prosecutor,'' he said.
   ``This is the pinnacle,'' Pichini said. ``I don't think we are
ever going to get any better than this.''
   ``We told the public, just like Ness, that the Mafia, and the
mystique of the Mafia, is penetrable and we also sent a signal loud
and clear to the La Cosa Nostra, and any other other organized
criminal group, that they can and will be prosecuted,'' said Joseph
Peters, chief deputy Pennsylvania attorney general assigned to the
federal unit.
   What's next?
   ``We have to see where the mob is going to go before we know we
will go,'' said Pichini. ``There is a vacuum, a substantial hole in
the mob left by this conviction, but sooner or later the void is
going to be filled. Then we'll go after them again.''
   La Cosa Nostra, or Mafia, first grew in the United States near
the end of the 19th century, imported from Sicily and southern Italy.
   By the late 1920s the gangster era was in full swing, including
the Philadelphia area, where until Angelo Bruno took control in 1959
there were seven bosses and many gang killings.
   Bruno reigned until he was shot in 1980. His successor, Philip
``Chicken Man'' Testa, was assassinated by a bomb a year later.
   Then Scarfo, whom prosecutors called ``a paranoid, cold-blooded
killer,'' took over and more than a dozen murders followed in the
bloody struggle for mob power.
   The prosecutors were glad the jurors were protected by keeping
their names and addresses secret.
   A year earlier, Scarfo and other mobsters were acquitted on drug
trafficking charges by a jury that wasn't anonymous. Pichini said he
believed those jurors were a little frightened and intimidated.
   ``Not this jury,'' he said. ``It was an appropriate setting to
hear all the charges proved against each defendant. It came back
with convictions for everything. It was as thorough a victory as you
could have against organized crime.''
   Friedman, 43, a native of Chicago, said ``the equilibrium has
shifted to the public's favor'' because of a series of successful
prosecutions, ``but whether we can completely eradicate the La Cosa
Nostra is up for debate.''
   ``As long as there is greed there will be organized crime,'' he
said. ``I don't think we will ever have sufficient resources to
bring organized crime down to zero.''

   Shipping heiress Christina Onassis was
buried on the family's island Saturday, outside the chapel where her
father, Aristotle, married Jacqueline Kennedy 20 years ago.
   About 100 relatives and friends, including Ms. Onassis' fourth
ex-husband, Thierry Roussel, attended a private Greek Orthodox
ceremony followed by her burial next to her father and brother in
the family mausoleum.
   Ms. Onassis, 37, died in Buenos Aires, Argentina, Nov. 19 from an
apparent heart attack, but the cause of death is still under
investigation.
   Roussel wept as the silver lined brown mahogany casket was placed
by pallbearers in the white, marble mausoleum.
   The burial service ended with a procession from the chapel to the
main house on the lush green Ionian island.
   The chapel was the site of her father's celebrated 1968 wedding
to Jacqueline Kennedy, widow of assassinated President John F.
Kennedy.
   The mourners arrived on the 400-acre island aboard fishing skiffs
and a ferry.
   Ms. Onassis' brother Alexander was killed in a 1973 air crash and
her father, Aristotle, founder of the giant shipping and business
empire, died two years later. He left a fortune estimated at $1
billion, half of which went to a charitable foundation and the
remainder to Christina.
   Her mother Athena, daughter of a shipping magnate, died under
mysterious circumstances in Paris in 1974. A coroner's report at the
time said she had died of a heart attack apparently brought on by an
overdose of barbituates.
   Christina's 3-year-old daughter Athena is her sole heir. The
estate will be held in trust until she turns 18.
   Athena was not present at her mother's funeral in Athens on
Friday or at the burial.
   Born Dec. 11, 1950, in New York City, Ms. Onassis was the subject
of gossip in society circles.
   Her first marriage in 1971 to Joseph Bolker, a Los Angeles real
estate broker 20 years her senior, ended nine months later at the
insistence of her strong-willed father. Later she married Alexander
Andreadis, son of a wealthy Greek banker-shipowner, which also ended
in divorce in 1976.
   Ms. Onassis wed Russian bureaucrat Sergei Kauzov in 1978 but
dissolved the marriage two years later.
   Roussel, heir to a French pharmaceutical fortune, divorced her in
October 1987 after two years of marriage. She had her only child
with him.
   Ms. Onassis' death is still surrounded by controversy after she
was found lying on the floor of her bedroom in the Buenos Aires
suburban villa owned by friends.
   An Argentine coroner in a preliminary report said she had died
from a pulmonary edema or fluid in the lungs. But Argentine
authorities said they were uncertain because unidentified pills were
found in her bedroom, raising doubts she died of natural causes.
Another autopsy was performed but the results were not released.

   A supervisor at a religious center
facing trial in the beating death of an 8-year-old girl has been
charged with beating nine other children at the camp with an
extension cord.
   Constance Z. Jackson was arraigned Friday in Clackamas County
Circuit Court on nine counts each of second-degree assault and
first-degree criminal mistreatment.
   According to indictments issued by a Clackamas County grand jury,
Jackson is alleged to have injured children under her care or
supervision ``by means of a dangerous weapon'' _ hitting them with
an extension cord.
   Judge Patrick D. Gilroy scheduled a Jan. 30 trial on the combined
additional charges. Jackson, 37, was allowed to remain free pending
trial next month on the first-degree manslaughter charge she faces
in connection with the death of Dayna Lorea Broussard.
   Dayna was the daughter of Eldridge Broussard Jr., founder of the
Ecclesia Athletic Association, which ran the camp at a rural house
east of Sandy where she was fatally beaten Oct. 14.
   Four people, all associated with Ecclesia and the Broussard-led
Watts Christian Center in Los Angeles, from which Ecclesia evolved,
were charged with manslaughter. Two, including Jackson, were
released from custody earlier this month while two others remain in
the Clackamas County jail.
   After the girl's death, Oregon officials took custody of 53
children found at the Sandy house. All remain in state custody,
although one has been allowed to stay with her grandparents, who
live in Oregon.
   Officials alleged the children were subjected to systematic
beatings and other abuse.
   Broussard has said his group relies on strict discipline and
athletic training to held children endure the rigors of ghetto
living, but he denies charges that the children were abused.
Broussard has not been charged in the case.

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cooperation among Latin, Caribbean and U.S.
officials _ even those at odds politically _ kept the loss of life
to ``probably one-tenth'' of what it might have been during this
year's hurricane season, the nation's chief hurricane forecaster
says.
   The six-month Atlantic hurricane season, which officially ends
Wednesday, produced 11 named storms and six hurricanes, including
the record-breaking Gilbert, and Tropical Storm Keith, which blew
across Florida last week but caused little damage except beach
erosion and minor flooding. Forecasters called it an average storm
season.
   There were 505 deaths recorded this year, but in the past, major
hurricanes have killed thousands when they hit Latin and Caribbean
nations where many houses are unable to stand up to hurricane winds
and flooding, said Bob Sheets, director of the National Hurricane
Center in nearby Coral Gables.
   ``I'm pleased to say I think everything went very well,'' Sheets
said. ``Even with the destruction we're talking about, loss of life
was relatively small. The governments, I think, did an excellent job
in getting their people prepared.''
   During the rise of Hurricane Joan last month, for example, the
center was in constant contact with the Nicaraguan Embassy in
Washington and the Colombian meteorological service, Sheets said.
Forecasters spoke regularly with concerned parties in Panama and
Costa Rica.
   During Joan, Sheets said, Costa Rican President Oscar Arias
``himself called four times here to this office.'' A week after the
storm, he sent his vice president to visit and thank employees for
their help.
   ``I know there are political differences that exist between the
U.S., Nicaragua and Cuba,'' Sheets said, ``but those differences
aren't felt in the meteorological community.''
   The sharing of information helped governments order evacuations
and take necessary precautions, Sheets said.
   Sheets recalled that Hurricane Fifi, a 1974 storm that struck
Honduras, killed 8,000 people. By contrast, 184 people died as a
result of Hurricane Joan's encounter with Central America.
   Hal Gerrish, another hurricane center forecaster, said the
international cooperation has been fostered by workshops the
hurricane center has held, for at least the past six years, for
officials from other nations.
   ``We have a 10-day course in both Spanish and English for the
Caribbean forecasters,'' Gerrish said Saturday. ``Their lead
forecasters will come up for refreshers and to get the latest on
forecasting. This has created a pretty close fraternity among us.''
   This year's season produced a record hurricane, Gilbert. There
was talk of adding a new top rank to the Saffir-Simpson scale, a
sort of Richter scale for hurricanes, just to accommodate it, Sheets
said.
   He added that Gilbert will probably be recorded as one of the
costliest storms ever. Gil Clark of the hurricane center said
figures are still preliminary, but he estimated the September storm
did $1 billion to $2 billion worth of damage, primarily in Jamaica
and Mexico.
   Sheets noted that Gilbert ``was the lowest pressure ever recorded
in this hemisphere.'' As a rule, the lower a hurricane's barometric
pressure, the stronger its winds. Gilbert registered sustained winds
as high as 175 mph.
   Sheets compared Gilbert to the 1935 hurricane that hit the
Florida Keys, killing more than 400 people. Its winds were clocked
at up to 200 mph; its pressure was the lowest recorded in the
hemisphere before Gilbert.
   Gilbert also ``was one of the largest hurricanes we've ever
seen,'' Sheets said.
   The storm's eye measured 8 miles across. At one point, he said,
Gilbert stretched across the Florida Keys, Cuba, the Florida
Straits, all of the western Caribbean and part of the Gulf of
Mexico. It killed more than 300 people and did significant damage in
Mexico, Jamaica, Haiti and the Dominican Republic.
   While Gilbert was ranked a 5 on the Saffir-Simpson scale, the
scale's top rank, Joan rated a 4.
   Sheets said that in the century the service has kept records,
there has been no mention of a Category 4 storm in Central America.
   Joan menaced Central America for days before blasting it with top
winds of 135 mph, causing mudslides, floods and other damage in
Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Colombia and Panama.
   Even after crossing land, Joan had sufficient strength to be
renamed Miriam as a Pacific storm.
   There are a lot of mysteries associated with hurricanes, and the
season's two biggest storms, which followed unusual paths for major
hurricanes, only added to them.
   ``As far as understanding why we have a Gilbert or a Joan, indeed
we know what are the necessary conditions, but we don't know what
the trigger mechanisms are,'' Sheets said.

   Urban guerrillas boarded a city
bus and shot to death two soldiers and wounded a third, authorities
said. One passenger was killed and three were seriously wounded in a
firefight aboard the bus, a hospital spokesman said.
   Shortly before the bus attack Friday night, a bomb went off at
the house of the mayor of the working-class suburb of Mejicanos, who
was not home at the time. Three passers-by were wounded by the
blast, said the mayor, Daniel Rivera.
   No group claimed responsibility for the bomb, which damaged
Rivera's garage.
   Violence is on the rise in this country, wracked by nine years of
civil war between leftist guerrillas and the U.S.-backed government.
   Urban leftist guerrillas killed a soldier on a bus and wounded
another Wednesday in the same kind of attack.
   A decapitated body was found Friday in the San Ramon
neighborhood. The body showed signs of torture. A watchman was
gunned down at midday Friday in the Centroamerica neighborhood.
   A third body was discovered just south of the capital. The
unidentified man had been shot through the head. His wrists were
marked as if he had been tightly bound.
   Local and international human rights groups have noted a sharp
rise this year in politically motivated killings by right-wing death
squads believed to be linked to the military. It was not immediately
known if the latest slayings were politically motivated.
   In the bus attack, two guerrillas opened fire on three army
soldiers on guard duty aboard the vehicle as it passed through
Libertad neighborhood, bus driver Ramon Jimenez told The Associated
Press.
   Two soldiers were killed, and a third soldier was wounded in the
shootout, authorities said.
   Jimenez said about 50 people were aboard the bus at the time.
   ``There was great panic. Women and children were crying,'' he
said.
   Jose Figueroa, spokesman at Rosales Hospital, said one male
passenger died en route to the hospital. He said three women
suffered serious' bullet wounds.

<HEAD>Moderate Catholic Leader Calls on IRA to Drop Violence</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The leader of a moderate Roman
Catholic political party accused the outlawed the IRA on Saturday of
``moral cowardice'' for using violence in their fight to end British
rule in the province.
   Social Democratic and Labor Party leader John Hume called on the
Irish Republican Army to put down guns and bombs and try to work for
talks to heal differences in the region.
   ``If they were to do so, then the atmosphere in this whole island
... would be transformed, and the nightmare of all our people would
be truly at an end,'' said Hume, whose party also wants to end
British rule peacefully and unite the mainly Protestant province
with the Irish republic.
   The IRA's choice of violence showed ``extreme moral cowardice and
a deeply partitionist attitude,'' Hume said at the opening of an
annual party conference. ``In their minds it is blood that is the
essential qualification for a patriot, not sweat.''
   He said the IRA had killed more than twice as many Catholics as
their real targets, the security forces, but did not give figures.
   Talks on Northern Ireland's future between his party and Sinn
Fein, the legal political wing of the IRA, broke down in September.
Hume's party blamed the impasse on Sinn Fein's refusal to renounce
IRA violence.

<DATELINE>ANN ARBOR, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A sickly premature baby snatched from a
hospital room was found 16 hours later in apparent good health,
officials said today.
   Catherine Cureton of the University of Michigan Medical Center
said two people were in custody in connection with the theft of
2{-month-old Debra Lynn Moore. She said the baby, who was taken
Friday evening, was found near Howell in Livingston County, but had
no other details.
   The baby had been hooked up to monitoring equipment at C.S. Mott
Children's Hospital, which is affiliated with the university. An
alarm went off when she was removed from a bassinet Friday evening,
but the baby was gone when hospital workers reached the room, said
police Sgt. Mark Jones.
   Sgt. Jim Tieman said an anonymous tip led Ann Arbor police to the
child, who was found about 11:15 a.m. today. She disappeared about
6:35 p.m. Friday.
   He had no immediate detail on the identity of the suspects or the
motive for the kidnapping.
   Earlier, Tieman had said said police were looking for a woman
seen acting suspiciously just before the baby was reported stolen.
He described her as a white female, about 30, with a heavy build.
   Debra's twin brother, in a nearby bassinet and receiving oxygen,
was unharmed, he said. Breathing difficulties are not uncommon in
premature babies, whose lungs may not have matured before birth.
   The 17-year-old mother was not at the hospital when her baby was
taken.
   ``She's quite upset,'' said Jones before the child was found.
Police, while releasing the baby's name, declined to give the
mother's name.
   Police early today ruled out as a suspect a woman who once worked
at the hospital as a security guard and who was seen in the vicinity
before the infant disappeared.
   ``We have chased that lead down and found out she was not
involved,'' said Staff Sgt. Harry Jinkerson.
   Police did not know how premature the twins were when they were
born.
   Debra was being taken to McPherson Community Health Center in
Howell, which is about 25 miles from Ann Arbor.

   The captain of the American Olympic chess
team secretly married a Soviet woman ranked second among the world's
female chess players and left with her for the United States on
Saturday.
   John Donaldson, 31, and Elena Akhmilovskaya, 32, were wed in this
northern port city during a major tournament Friday, according to
American players.
   ``It's a real love match. A marriage, not a defection,'' said
Inna Izrailov, a Soviet who plays for the American women's team.
   The couple's elopement deprived the U.S. men's team of its
captain at a crucial stage in the Olympiad, a biennial world team
championship that began in Salonica earlier this month. With three
rounds remaining, the men's team is placed fourth and is expected to
press hard for a medal.
   ``We really do mind losing our team captain, but we couldn't
think of a finer reason why we should,'' said Yasser Sierawan of
Seattle, America's top player and Donaldson's closest friend.
   Sierawan said the couple hoped Ms. Akhmilovskaya's daughter would
eventually be allowed to join them in the United States. The
7-year-old girl is staying with her grandmother in the Soviet Union.
   Donaldson, an international master also from Seattle, and Ms.
Akmilovskaya first met three years ago at a world championship
qualifying tournament in Havana, Cuba.
   The loss of Ms. Akhmilovskaya, a grandmaster, in the women's
championship may make an even bigger difference in that event.
   The Soviets are slightly ahead of Hungary, whose remarkable trio
of sisters _ including Judit Polgar, the highest-ranked 12-year-old
player in history _ threatens to break three decades of Soviet
domination.
   Donaldson and Ms. Akmilovskaya were married at noon Friday in a
civil ceremony at City Hall, then returned to the playing hall to
watch the United States women's team hold the Soviets to a draw.
   The couple spent a sleepless Friday night with the American
players, who escorted the couple to Salonica airport early Saturday.
   Later in the morning, after the plane took off, Izrailov informed
the Soviet team that Ms. Akhmilovskaya would not be playing in the
12th round on Saturday.
   Besides Izrailov, the Americans have Soviet emigre Anna
Akshumarova on their women's team, whose captain is 22-year-old
Maxim Dlugy, also a Soviet emigre.
   Ms. Akshumarova is the wife of Boris Gulko, one of two former
Soviets playing on the six-member U.S. men's team. Gulko's
seven-year campaign for an exit visa from the Soviet Union included
three hunger strikes.

<TEXT>
   President Reagan said today that the
re-election of Prime Minister Brian Mulroney by the voters of Canada
sent a strong message rejecting trade protectionist sentiments.
   In his weekly radio address, delivered from Reagan's mountaintop
ranch retreat near this Southern California resort city, the
president said that ``one of the key factors behind our nation's
great prosperity is the open trade policy.''
   Reagan had said earlier in the week that the victory by
Mulroney's Progressive Conservative Party will go a long way toward
sealing the U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement.
   When nations move toward protectionism, as the United States did
in 1930, Reagan said, it has resulted in ``disaster for the working
men and women.'' He said that in the wake of passage of the
Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act, one out of four Americans lost their jobs,
leading to the Great Depression.
   He urged Americans to ``reject the siren song of protectionism''
and said that, in the meantime, the administration would work hard
to see to it that U.S. trading partners ``play by the rules'' of
international competition.

   Soldiers killed three Azerbaijanis for violating a
curfew in the southern city of Kirovabad, raising the death toll in
ethnic disturbances in this city to six, a official said Saturday.
   Reports from official media said at least 120 people were injured
and 150 arrested in violence in the Azerbaijani city. The violence
has been sparked by a territorial dispute between mainly Christian
Armenians and Moslem Azerbaijanis.
   Authorities also imposed curfews in the Armenian capital of
Yerevan and the Azerbaijani capital of Baku as they tried to quell
the largest outbreak of violence since early spring in the adjacent
southern Soviet republics.
   Chingiz Sadykhov, officer in charge of Kirovabad's Communist
Party headquarters, said in a telephone interview the three
Azerbaijanis were shot Friday for violating the overnight curfew.
   Soldiers in tanks and personnel carriers continued to patrol
Kirovabad even though there had been no protests for the past two
days, Sadykhov said.
   Three soldiers were killed in Kirovabad on Tuesday after being
called in to protect the city's Armenian population from mobs of
Azerbaijanis. The Defense Ministry newspaper Krasnaya Zvezda said
Saturday that they had been killed by a grenade thrown from a crowd.
   The newspaper reported more than 70 attempts to attack Armenian
homes and apartments in Kirovabad, and said more than 150 people
were arrested. Several firearms were confiscated, it said.
   Sadykhov said about 120 people were injured in the unrest.
   Armenians and Azerbaijanis are disputing control of the
Nagorno-Karabakh region of Azerbaijan, which has a predominantly
Armenian population. Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh, backed by
Armenians in Yerevan and other cities, have been agitating since
February to annex the region.
   In late February and early March ethnic rioting broke out in the
Azerbaijani city of Sumgait. At least 26 Armenians and six
Azerbaijanis died.
   Musa Mamedov, information director for the Azerbaijani Foreign
Ministry in Baku, said in a telephone interview that demonstrations
continued in Baku but there was no violence.
   Official Radio Moscow said the situation was ``relatively calm''
despite attempts ``to provoke riots in several areas.'' It said
transport and shops were operating.
   Protests ground to a halt Saturday in Yerevan under a ban imposed
by soldiers who were reported to be on nearly every street corner.
   ``There are soldiers patrolling everywhere, especially in the
center of the city,'' said Arpenay Popoyan, wife of activist Rafael
Popoyan.
   ``If two or three people gather, the soldiers come and break them
up,'' she said in a telephone interview from the Armenian capital.
``The patrols are very strict.''
   Mrs. Popoyan and correspondent Yuri Kankanyan of the official
Armenian news agency Armenpress said there were no demonstrations or
meetings, which had been prohibited by the military under an order
establishing a 10 p.m.-6 a.m. curfew.
   Most public transportation and stores were open.
   Mamedov denied reports of high death tolls in Azerbaijan,
including one cited by Soviet human rights activist Andrei D.
Sakharov, who said in the United States that more than 130 Armenians
had been killed. Sakharov, who did not give the source for his
figures, urged the Soviet government to take measures to protect
Armenians.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said Soviet leaders will
meet soon with delegations of Armenians and Azerbaijanis seeking a
``solution that would conform to the best interests of these two
peoples and our country.''
   Gorbachev made the comment in a interview with visiting President
Francois Mitterrand of France broadcast Friday on the French
television network Antenne-2.

<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Militants shot and stabbed passengers
aboard a bus and fired on troops rushing to the scene Saturday,
killing six people and prompting a weekend curfew, news reports said.
   The curfew banned civilian movement on the streets around Colombo
from Saturday night until Monday morning.
   It followed the attack in Pannipitiya, a suburban neighborhood
four miles southeast of the capital, said Lankapuwath, the national
news agency.
   The news agency said the militants, suspected Sinhalese
extremists, launched the attack after boarding the bus.
   A woman passenger died after being injured in the gunfire, news
reports said. Three soldiers were killed aboard the bus and two
others died when they approached the bus after hearing the gunfire,
Lankapuwath said. The militants then fled.
   Soldiers have been escorting passenger buses in Colombo and its
outskirts after a series of strike calls by the People's Liberation
Front, a militant Sinhalese group, earlier this month.
   The front stepped up its 16-month anti-government campaign
earlier this month demanding the resignation of President Junius R.
Jayewardene.
   The front opposes an India-sponsored peace plan signed by the
government that was aimed at ending the 5-year-old war by minority
Tamil rebels for an independent homeland.
   The Sinhalese group says the July 1987 plan gives too many
concessions to the minority Tamils. The front has been blamed by the
government for about 875 killings since the plan was signed.
   At least 325 of the killings have taken place since Oct. 15, the
government says.
   India became involved in the ethnic strife in Sri Lanka because
of the sympathies of its own 60 million Tamils for the rebel cause.
It sent in at least 47,000 soldiers to quell the Tamil insurgency
after the rebels rejected the 1987 peace accord.
   Tamil rebels have been fighting for an independent homeland on
the island's north and east since 1983. The separatist war has
claimed at least 8,500 lives.
   Tamils form 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people and claim
they are discriminated against by the Sinhalese, who make up 75
percent of the population.

   A new OPEC production agreement hinged
Saturday on whether Iran's oil minister could persuade his
government to approve it.
   Iraq's oil minister, Issam Abdul Raheem Chalabi, crossed his
fingers when reporters asked him to describe the prospects of the
accord worked out by the 13-nation Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries.
   Gholamreza Aghazadeh, the Iranian official, made a quick trip to
Tehran to consult with government leaders before accepting the
package.
   ``He is still optimistic,'' said an Iranian delegate, who was in
contact with Aghazadeh on Saturday morning. The delegate demanded
anonymity.
   The other oil ministers postponed resumption of their winter
meeting from Saturday evening to Sunday to give Iran time to
consider the plan.
   IRNA, the official Islamic Republic News Agency, reported from
Tehran that Aghazadeh said the nation's response will be announced
Sunday.
   The news agency quoted the minister as saying he would talk
Saturday to the heads of the executive, legislative and judiciary
branches of government. The report said he would discuss the matter
in a Cabinet session Sunday.
   ``Then we will inform OPEC of Iran's decision,'' he was quoted as
saying.
   The proposed deal would trim current production by about 4
million barrels a day from the present 22.5 million barrels to 18.5
million barrels in the first six months of 1989.
   It also would retain the cartel's benchmark of $18 a barrel.
   Prices have been running $4 or so below that because of a market
glut. The new accord is aimed at curbing overproduction and raising
prices.
   IRNA quoted Aghazadeh as saying the new production ceiling would
boost prices to a range of $16 to $18 a barrel.
   Each one dollar rise in the price of crude oil theoretically
means an increase of 2.5 cents a gallon in retail gasoline prices,
although oil companies do not always pass along the full increase.
   The ministers began their winter meeting Monday, then adjourned
for closed-door talks to try to end a bitter dispute between rivals
Iran and Iraq. The two nations signed a cease-fire in August that
ended their 8-year-old war, a conflict both paid for with revenues
from oil exports.
   Iraq had been demanding an equal production ceiling with Iran in
any new accord. Aghazadeh had repeatedly said no.
   But under the new accord Iran and Iraq would get the same quota
of 2.64 million barrels a day.
   Iran would retain its production share at 14.27 percent of total
output. Other countries would give up some of their share to bring
Iraq up to the same level as Iran.
   Saudi Arabia maintains the largest share at about a quarter of
the cartel's total output.
   Under the current accord, Iran has a cap of 2.4 million barrels a
day. Iraq was given a ceiling of 1.5 million barrels butignored it.
Analysts estimate its production at 2.7 million barrels a day.
   OPEC members are Algeria, Ecuador, Gabon, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq,
Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates
and Venezuela.

<TEXT>
   The man this small town knows as
Santa Claus will miss his annual appearance in the park, his visits
to shut-ins and other Yuletide duties this year, forced by an
accident at his job to spend a month in the hospital.
   Despite the accident, Elmer Buller, 60, had hoped to be able to
don his red suit and attach a white beard for his Christmastime
activities for the local chamber of commerce, said a son, Walter
Buller.
   But doctors at St. Paul Ramsey Medical Center's burn unit have
told him he will be hospitalized for a month because of the burns he
sustained when he fell into a pit of burning wooden pallets at his
workplace, Balzer Manufacturing.
   The son said that in Mountain Lake, a southern Minnesota
community of about 2,000, ``Elmer IS Santa.
   ``He's always visited people who are shut in,'' he said. ``He's
always had a concern for others and a soft heart. He's going to be
missed around here for the next month.''
   In years past, Buller has made four or five appearances as Santa
during the Christmas season for the chamber of commerce, posing for
pictures and handing out candy. He also has portrayed the jolly old
elf informally at other gatherings, his son said.
   For his annual appearance in the city park, Walter Buller said,
``He came on a sleigh if there was snow, and on a fire truck if
there wasn't.''
   ``If he had a free evening, he would put on his (Santa) suit and
go to the Good Samaritan Village where the old folks are and visit
with them,'' said the son, 36.
   The elder Buller, a custodian at the farm equipment maker, was
preparing to add more pallets to the fire Monday when he slipped and
his left foot entered the flames, family members said. When he
pulled his foot out, his shoe had been burned off.
   Buller suffered burns over 25 percent of his body, mostly on his
legs and hands.
   ``People who know Elmer say they're praying for him,'' said
Walter Buller. ``That's what keeps him from having pain worse than
he's having.''
   When he was hospitalized, Buller's first thoughts were on keeping
a Dec. 3 appearance for the chamber of commerce, his son said.
   ``He said right away ... `Don't cancel it. Maybe I can make
it,''' Walter Buller said.
   But a replacement had to be found.
   ``He's had a tremendous amount of pain. But he's a fighter,'' his
son said.

   Once again, high school economics teacher
Dick Gastler is fighting hunger with the mightiest weapon in his
arsenal _ a tacky old leisure suit.
   Four years ago, Gastler let his students at Denfeld High School
burn his tacky green leisure suit in exchange for their leading a
drive that raised $3,300 to help fight hunger in Duluth and Ethiopia.
   This year, he's asking students to gather aluminum cans for
recycling. The proceeds will go to Project Heifer, an international
organization that provides livestock for families in developing
countries.
   If students bring in 40 pounds or more of aluminum on a given
day, Gastler says, he will wear a less-than-fashionable rust-colored
suit with white stitching the next day _ ``or I won't wear it,
whichever way they want it.''
   The rust leisure suit, he promises, is just as tacky as the old
green one and just as sure to offend his students.
   He said a friend sold it to him. ``He tried to talk me out of it,
but I went ahead anyway,'' he said.

   Mayor Freda Poundstone has a
reputation for being a tough and even ruthless political opponent,
but she also is known to be a pushover when it comes to children and
pets.
   Thanks to her friendly persuasion, 18 beagle puppies that were
used as experimental subjects have gone to new homes.
   ``I think you would be surprised how easily people take to such
darling little puppies,'' the mayor said as the last eight to be
adopted were picked up on Thanksgiving Day at the mayor's home.
   Poundstone first heard of the homeless pups from her daughter, a
student at Colorado State University's School of Veterinary Medicine
at Fort Collins.
   The puppies, now 8 to 10 weeks old, got their start in life as
test subjects for puppy formula at the veterinary school.
   When the program ended, Poundstone asked permission to find homes
for the pups. For two years, she almost single-handedly has led the
Colorado Animal Rescue program to save unclaimed pets from
euthanasia in local pounds and kept them in a private kennel until
owners could be found.

   The Kaserman family's 1,168-strong fleet
of trucks makes no deliveries and earns no income. But the vehicles
also consume no fuel.
   Massillon Health Commissioner Rick Kaserman and his sons Randy,
13, and Kevin, 8, have a collection of 1,168 models, which trace
nearly four decades of changes in trucks.
   Kaserman says his fascination with the vehicles began when he was
a boy and watched his father go to work as an agent for a moving
company.
   He cherished the promotional truck models from his father's
company, and still prizes one of his earliest models.
   When Randy showed an interest in the hobby, the family renewed
its effort to collect tiny trucks and this year they have added 300
vehicles to their collection.
   Through correspondence, the Kasermans have made friends with
officials of many trucking companies. Several companies have offered
Randy a job when he grows up because of the exceptional knowledge of
trucks he shows in his letters.

   Here is the text of President
Reagan's weekly radio address given from his ranch in the Santa Ynze
Mountains near here:
   My fellow Americans, this week as we prepared for Thanksgiving,
Canada held an important election and I'm pleased to again send my
congratulations to Prime Minister Mulroney.
   One of the important issues in the Canadian election was trade,
and like our own citizens earler this month, our neighbors have sent
a strong message rejecting protectionism and reaffirming that more
trade, not less, is the wave of the future.
   Here in America, as we reflect on the many things we have to be
grateful for, we should take a moment to recognize that one of the
key factors behind our nation's great prosperity is the open trade
policy that allows the American people to freely exchange goods and
services with free people around the world.
   The freedom to trade is not a new issue for America. In 1776, our
founding fathers signed the Declaration of Independence charging the
British with a number of offenses, among them, and I quote,
``cutting off our trade with all parts of the world.''
   In that same year, a Scottish economist named Adam Smith launched
another revolution with a book entitled, ``The Wealth of Nations''
which exposed for all time the folly of protectionism.
   Over the past 200 years, not only has the argument against
tariffs and trade barriers won nearly universal agreement among
economists, but it has also proven itself in the real world where we
have seen free trading nations prosper, while protectionist
countries fall behind.
   America's most recent experiment with protectionism was a
disaster for the working men and women of this country. When
Congress passed the Smoot-Hawley tariff in 1930, we were told that
it would protect America from foreign competition and save jobs in
this country; the same line we hear today.
   The actual result was the Great Depression, the worst economic
catastrophe in our history. One out of four Americans were thrown
out of work. Two years later, when I cast my first ballot for
president, I voted for Franklin Delano Roosevelt who opposed
protectionism and called for the repeal of that disastrous tariff.
   Ever since that time, the American people have stayed true to our
heritage by rejecting the siren song of protectionism. In recent
years the trade deficit led some misguided politicians to call for
protectionism, warning that otherwise we would lose jobs; but they
were wrong again. In fact, the United States not only didn't lose
jobs, we created more jobs than all the countries of Western Europe,
Canada and Japan combined.
   The record is clear that when America's total trade is increased,
American jobs have also increased. And when our total trade has
declined, so have the number of jobs. Part of the difficulty in
accepting the good news about trade is in our words. We too often
talk about trade while using the vocabulary of war. In war, for one
side to win the other must lose. But commerce is not warfare. Trade
is an economic alliance that benefits both countries. There are no
losers, only winners and trade helps strengthen the free world.
   Yet, today protectionism is being used by some American
politicians as a cheap form of nationalism, a fig leaf for those
unwilling to maintain America's military strength and who lack the
resolve to stand up to real enemies; countries that would use
violence against us or our allies.
   Our peaceful trading partners are not our enemies; they are our
allies. We should beware of the demagogues who are ready to declare
a trade war against our friends, weakening our economy on national
security and the entire free world, all while cynically waving the
American flag.
   The expansion of the international economy is not a foreign
invasion. It is an American triumph, one we worked hard to achieve
and something central to our vision of a peaceful and prosperous
world of freedom. After the second world war, America led the way to
dismantle trade barriers and create a world trading system that set
the stage for decades of unparalleled economic growth. And in one
week, when important multi-lateral trade talks are held in Montreal,
we will be in the forefront of efforts to improve this system.
   We want to open more markets for our products, to see to it that
all nations play by the rules, and to seek improvement in such areas
as dispute resolution and agriculture. We also want to bring the
benefits of free trade to new areas, including services, investment
and the protection of intellectual property. Our negotiators will be
working hard for all of us.
   Yes, back in 1776 our founding fathers believed that free trade
was worth fighting for and we can celebrate their victory, because
today trade is at the core of the alliances that secure the peace
and guarantee our freedom. It is the source of our prosperity and
the path to an even brighter future for America.
   Until next week, thanks for listening and God bless you.

   A team of Soviet and French astronauts blasted off
from Central Asia on Saturday and headed for the Soviets' orbiting
space station Mir.
   The three cosmonauts aboard the Soyuz TM-7 were scheduled to
rendezvous aboard the Mir with three men already in orbit for what
Tass called the first practical preparations of an international
team for a manned expedition to Mars.
   French President Francois Mitterrand, wearing a coat and scarf,
peered through binoculars from a viewing stand at the Baikonur
Cosmodrome as the rocket lifted off in the darkness.
   Also present at the launch were two members of the British rock
group Pink Floyd, a favorite of French astronaut Jean-Loup Chretien.
   The launch was carried live by Soviet and French national
television.
   An hour after takeoff, the Soviet space center said all systems
were operating normally.
   Chretien is to remain aboard the Mir until Dec. 21, when he is
scheduled to return to Earth with two Soviet cosmonauts who will
have spent 365 days in orbit.
   With him in the launch vehicle were mission commander Alexander
Volkov and flight engineer Sergei Krikalev, who are expected to
spend about six months in space.
   Soviet television showed the cosmonauts in their space capsule
before the launch and apparently during the initial ascent.
   Volkov said in a prepared statement he read minutes before launch
that all equipment on board was in order.
   Chretien expressed his pride at being included as his country's
representative on the flight and told Mitterrand he appreciated the
Socialist president's presence at the launch.
   Chretien, a music lover, took with him a portable organ to play
aboard the Mir space station.
   ``It will be interesting to see how a man can accomplish delicate
tasks in weightlessness, and music is delicate,'' said Patrick
Baudry, who flew on a U.S. space shuttle mission in 1985. Baudry was
interviewed on French television.
   Because Chretien told a recent news conference that he liked the
rock group Pink Floyd, the crew was carrying one of the group's
albums into space, and two members of the band watched the launch at
Baikonur.
   During his mission, Chretien is to become the first West European
to make a walk in space.
   He is also planning to carry out scientific experiments prepared
by experts at France's National Center for Space Studies.
   Mitterrand and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev met Saturday
morning in Moscow for a final round of talks before the French
president left for the launch site.
   In his first meetings with Gorbachev on Friday, Mitterrand and
the Soviet leader talked about disarmament and improving economic
ties, according to Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I.
Gerasimov and Mitterrand spokesman Hubert Vedrine.
   France has harshly criticized the Soviet Union in the past for
alleged human rights violations, but its spokesman refrained from
commenting on that issue at Friday's news briefing.
   Officials also announced that French banks led by Credit Lyonnais
are extending a $2 billion credit line to the Soviet Union.
   The Soviets also signed a joint venture agreement with the French
government-owned Pechiney SA metals group to build a $172.4 million
factory in Armenia for manufacturing aluminum packaging.

   Cosmonauts aboard the Soviet space station are
dining on compote of pigeon and oxtail fondue after the French made
their most sumptuous effort to put haute cuisine into outer space.
   Only wine and those famous French sauces _ which would float away
in the gravity-free atmosphere _ are missing from the menu.
   Twenty-three products ranging from bread rolls to ham and fruit
pates are stocked aboard the Soyuz-TM-7 space module, which blasted
off Saturday from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Soviet Central Asia.
The spacecraft is headed for the Mir space station, where five
Soviet cosmonauts and French astronaut Jean-Loup Chretien will live
until Dec. 21.
   ``We looked for difficult things to make, things that are out of
the ordinary, that give some pleasure,'' said chef Lucien Vanel, who
prepared four gourmet dishes for the astronauts.
   Vanel's creations, made with the help of chef Pierre Roudge,
include compote of pigeon with dates and dried raisins, duck with
artichokes and oxtail fondue with tomatoes and pickles. The food is
all canned, ``to be opened like you open fois gras,'' Vanel said.
   ``This is not food to be eaten every day,'' the chef said. ``It's
not to survive on, just to give them a little pleasure.''
   But he said he regretted a good bottle of wine could not make the
journey into space.
   ``French cuisine is inconceivable without wine,'' he said.
   Saute de veau Marengo and cheeses also are making the trip, along
with high-energy bars made of nuts, coffee and chocolate.
   The project was sponsored by several French food companies.
   The chefs worked under three limitations: the dishes had to be
small and contain neither bones nor sauce.
   Sauce would be transformed into flying droplets, Vanel said, so
the meat was made to absorb the sauce during cooking.
   This is not the first time French cuisine has gone into orbit. In
1982, Chretien shared his country's dishes with Soviet colleagues in
space, and in 1985 French astronaut Patrick Baudry treated fellow
astronauts aboard the U.S. shuttle Discovery to a meal ``a la
francaise.''
   Vanel said his dishes closely resemble those prepared in his
Toulouse restaurant. ``Only here at the restaurant we serve the
entire pigeon.
   ``In a couple years, we'll see sauce and bones and wine go up
there.''

   Emergency shelters house a growing throng of
homeless Americans, but the need now, in the words of a National
Academy of Sciences study, is for ``a stable residence'' for those
who have none _ in other words, permanent housing. Noting that
federal funds for low-income housing have been cut by more than
three-quarters since 1981, advocates say the need for lasting
shelter is critical. Some see potential in unused government-owned
houses and in the shells of once-sturdy buildings that stand vacant
in inner cities.

   Taxpayers around the nation own tens of thousands of houses
standing empty. At the same time, tens of thousands of American
families with nowhere to live overflow shelters and haunt the
streets.
   Now the homeless and some of the publicly owned vacant homes are
being brought together _ in a project that is housing families from
the Minnesota cold, in a clandestine effort to renovate and occupy a
dwelling in Chicago, in New York City's restoration of entire
tumbledown blocks.
   Activists, while encouraged, are pressing housing officials to do
more, and a major decision could come in federal court next week.
They say the government is skirting a law that pledges available
space to those without homes.
   ``I think thousands of buildings could and should be usable,''
said Robert Hayes, counsel for the National Coalition for the
Homeless in New York, a city that owns, mostly through tax default,
5,000 empty apartment buildings with many times that number of
apartments and has an estimated 60,000 homeless people.
   One of the abandoned buildings was on Leggett Street in a sorry
corner of the South Bronx, a national symbol of blight.
   One of the homeless was Susan Thomas, placed in a shabby welfare
hotel room in Manhattan a few years ago with her two sons, then 6
months and 2{ years old, after she split from their father and ended
up on the street.
   ``I used to cry 'cause I didn't want to be there,'' she says.
Their hotel room was broken into, and drug dealing and fear were all
around.
   After 18 months, she boarded a city van for Leggett Street, to
look at an apartment in a building that had been restored.
   ``I wasn't expecting anything like this,'' the 24-year-old woman
said, talking to a reporter in her tidy, bright two-bedroom
apartment, her boys playing across a room that's still mostly bare
of furnishings. It was Ms. Thomas' day off; she's a clerk in a
nearby store.
   Her building, whose tiled entrance foyer smelled of cleaning
fluid, had been a ruin not long before.
   Another Bronx site still is _ but not for long. Workers there are
gutting five buildings that occupy a whole block, to create 220
apartments for families like the Thomases.
   Vince Campisi, construction supervisor, outgrowled the demolition
equipment as he described getting started: ``You literally couldn't
get in for the junkies. ... Crack? Vials by the garbage-pailful.''
   Leading a reporter on a tour, Campisi crunched up rubble-strewn
steps to the remains of what? a parlor? Its ceiling was burned
through to the sky. A green upholstered sofa stood upended in a
corner. The windows let in a drizzle. ``No air-conditioning
needed,'' he deadpanned.
   Still, he and others said fixing up buildings that landlords have
abandoned is often cheaper than new construction in places like New
York. The gutting-and-rehab job that Campisi is overseeing is to
cost the city $15 million. How much would comparable new buildings
cost? ``Maybe $50 million,'' he guessed.
   Halfway across the country, in Minnesota, the vacant, publicly
owned houses being readied for the homeless look different.
   In Duluth, a three-bedroom ranch house that had reverted to the
Department of Housing and Urban Development when its owners failed
to make payments on a federally backed loan is being readied for a
family that has been on the streets.
   ``We're offering properties that are in good condition,'' said
Patricia Mack of the HUD office in Minneapolis, which hopes by next
spring to lease 15 houses rent-free to non-profit groups that house
the homeless.
   Such efforts have strong support, according to a survey earlier
this year by the National Housing Institute, a non-profit think tank
based in Orange, N.J. One thousand adults were surveyed by phone.
   Eight in 10 favored rehabilitating old and vacant buildings for
homeless Americans, who number 450,000 to 3 million, estimated by
the government and advocacy groups, respectively. Sixty percent said
they'd willingly pay an extra $120 apiece in taxes each year to
expand housing efforts.
   ``The need for permanent housing cannot be met,'' says a
September report by the National Coalition for the Homeless, without
an increase in the federal budget for low-income housing _ $7.538
billion this year, down 77 percent from 1981's budget of $32.2
billion.

   The kitchen where tainted food was
cooked passed an inspection for cleanliness Saturday as
investigators tried to learn why one person died and nearly 100
others became ill after a pre-Thanksgiving dinner.
   ``The plant was clean. There were no violations,'' said Dr. Anita
Curran, Westchester County health commissioner.
   ``Hopefully, we'll have an answer by the end of the weekend to
what the possible problem was, whether the turkeys were held at an
inappropriate temperature'' or whether something else went wrong,
she said.
   About 100 patients and staff members from the Rockland
Psychiatric Center in Orangeburg became ill after eating the meal
Wednesday at outpatient facilities in Mount Vernon, Yonkers and
Tuckahoe.
   Ina Duncan, 61, of Mount Vernon died early Friday at Mount Vernon
Hospital after suffering food poisoning symptoms, including vomiting
and diarrhea. She also suffered a heart attack, but it was not
immediately clear whether that was brought on by food poisoning,
said Nancy McPartlin, a Health Department spokeswoman.
   Another victim whose name was not released was in stable
condition in the intensive care unit at Mount Vernon Hospital on
Saturday, said Curran.
   The meals were delivered after being cooked in a kitchen at Iona
College by a caterer, Flik International of Mamaroneck.
   More than two dozen Iona students ate leftovers from the meal
before leaving the campus for the holiday weekend. Officials didn't
know who they were, and officials said none of them of them had
contacted the department by midday Saturday.
   Although the cause of the food poisoning was not immediately
identified, turkey is ``obviously the first thing you would
suspect,'' Curran said. ``Poultry is a very, very common source of
salmonella.''
   While proper cooking destroys the bacteria, food service workers
who handle a lot of poultry can carry salmonella in their intestinal
tracts, and can transmit it to food if they don't wash their hands.

   The government today released
two aging and ailing black leaders who are colleagues of Nelson
Mandela and had been imprisoned for more than a decade.
   Harry Gwala, 69, a longtime member of the outlawed African
National Congress, and Zephania Mothopeng, 75, president of the Pan
Africanist Congress ``were released unconditionally on
medical-humanitarian grounds,'' the Prisons Service said in a brief
statement.
   Gwala was freed from Westville Prison in the Indian Ocean city of
Durban, and Mothopeng was freed from Diepkloof Prison outside
Johannesburg.
   Gwala spent more than 20 years in prison and was serving a life
sentence for his involvement with the ANC guerrilla movement, headed
by Mandela.
   He is suffering from a degenerative neurological disorder with no
known cure. He said the illness has left his arms paralyzed, but his
mind is clear.
   Mothopeng, who has been seriously ill for several months, was
imprisoned in 1976 and had been detained several times prior to that.
   He was a longtime member of the ANC but broke from the
organization in 1959 to help establish the Pan Africanist Congress,
which favors black self-sufficiency in the struggle for political
rights.
   The decision to free Gwala and Mothopeng is the latest in a
series of moves by the government that appear aimed at reducing
domestic and international pressure on South Africa. In the past
week, the government has:
   _Endorsed a regional peace plan that would require South Africa
to grant independence to South-West Africa, also known as Namibia.
   _Granted clemency to the ``Sharpville Six,'' a group of blacks
sentenced to death for complicity in a 1984 mob killing. The death
sentences, replaced with lengthy jail terms, had provoked
international protest.
   _Said Mandela, the country's best known black leader, would not
return to prison when he recovers from tuberculosis at a Cape Town
hospital. Mandela will remain in custody at a ``suitable'' location,
the government said.
   Gwala's daughter, Lulu, said earlier today that her father
remained a member of the ANC and the South African Communist Party,
which also is outlawed. She said she was not aware of any
restrictions placed on Gwala, but did not know if he intened to
publicly resume his political activities.
   Gwala served eight years in prison from 1964-72 following a
conviction on sabotage. He was arrested in 1975 and detained for two
years. In 1977, he was sentenced to life in prison for involvement
with the ANC, the main black group attempting to overthrow the
white-led government.
   Lawyers for Gwala wrote President P.W. Botha in July and pleaded
that Gwala be released because of his illness.

<TEXT>
   As George Bush focused on his national security
team, job-seekers eyed the remaining top positions with some
speculating the president-elect would soon turn his attention to
vacancies at Commerce and Health and Human Services.
   John Sununu, Bush's designated White House chief of staff, said
in an interview broadcast Saturday, ``I think next week you'll see
action in a couple of areas associated with defense.''
   Aides at Bush's transition office did not have a schedule for
when the president-elect would make his next appointments. Bush
returns to the nation's capital Sunday after a Thanksgiving vacation
at Kennebunkport, Maine.
   Sununu, appearing on CNN's ``Evans & Novak'' show, also said he
has asked Robert M. Teeter, co-director of Bush's transition office,
to serve as his deputy chief of staff. ``He's considering it and ...
I would hope that he says yes,'' said Sununu.
   Teeter's co-director, Craig Fuller, has been asked ``to make
suggestions as to how he can make a contribution'' in the Bush
administration, said Sununu, the retiring governor of New Hampshire.
   While there has been talk that Fuller might head the
Transportation Department, Sununu said Fuller ``probably has a
higher likelihood of not being in...'' the administration.
   After Fuller lost out to Sununu in the competition to become
chief of staff, he said he would return to private business next
year.
   Teeter was out of town and could not be reached. His office
assistant said she did not know whether he had reached any decision
on Sununu's offer.
   There has been widespread speculation that former Sen. John Tower
of Texas is the front-runner to become the Pentagon chief, despite
questions about his personal life and his commitment to procurement
reform. Tower was divorced from his wife last year.
   Rep. Nicholas Mavroules, D-Mass., a member of the House Armed
Services Committee and a supporter of eliminating Pentagon waste,
recalled Tower as ``strident'' in the Senate. Tower chaired the
Senate Armed Services Committee during the massive defense build-up
in the early years of the Reagan administration.
   Bush's choice must be someone ``dedicated to cleaning up that
mess at the Pentagon,'' Mavroules said in an interview.
   Before he left for the Thanksgiving holiday last week, Bush named
retired Air Force Gen. Brent Scowcroft as his national security
adviser. There is some thinking that Bush may keep CIA Director
William Webster on the job in an interim appointment.
   Once he fixes his national security team, Bush is likely to set
his sights on two other big agencies, Commerce and HHS, according to
one source close to the transition. The source spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   Bush's aides have said there is no set timetable for having a
government in place. ``We have about 60 days between now and
inauguration and I think the vice president is wise to use as much
of that clock to his own benefit,'' Sununu said.
   At Commerce, Robert Mosbacher, a Houston oilman and Bush's old
friend, is thought to have the edge over the other candidates. If
both he and Tower are picked, Bush would have at least four Texans
in high-ranking jobs. Others are James A. Baker III, the designated
secretary of state and Lauro Cavazos, the education secretary.
   Here is the scuttlebutt on some other agencies.
   _ HHS. Rep. Willis D. Gradison Jr., R-Ohio, has emerged as a
leading candidate to head the huge federal agency that runs the
costly Medicare and Medicaid health insurance programs as well as
Social Security, the Food and Drug Administration and the National
Institutes of Health.
   Gradison, a classmate of Bush's at Yale, is ranking Republican on
the Ways and Means health subcommittee that deals with Medicare, an
$80 billion program expected to expand at more than double the rate
of overall inflation over the next few years without spending cuts.
   Another serious candidate is Monroe Trout, who runs a chain of
non-profit hospitals in California and serves with Barbara Bush on
the board of directors of Morehouse College, a black institution in
Atlanta. A physician and lawyer, he headed a major pharmaceutical
company and was active in Republican politics in Connecticut before
moving to California and has been in Washington this month talking
with various people about his interest in the job.
   Among other names bandied about the the job are Rep. Lynn Martin,
R-Ill, Surgeon General C. Everett Koop and Dorcas Hardy, the Social
Security commissioner.
   _ Labor. A name that has been given serious attention recently is
that of Constance Horner, head of the Office of Personnel
Management. Martin is another candidate for this job, as is Rep.
Thomas Ridge, R-Pa.
   _ Energy. Former Rep. Henson Moore of Louisiana says he is under
consideration for this job. ``From the best we can tell, it's
getting serious,'' he said in an interview. Another possible
candidate if Frederick Khedouri, a former aide to Bush. Sen. James
McClure, a Republican on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee,
is publicly backing Peter Johnson, a former administrator at the
Bonneville Power Administration, for the job.
   _ Interior. The talk is that Sen. Dan Evans, R-Wash., who is
retiring from the Senate at the end of the year, is still in the
running for this position. Others are Rep. Dick Cheney, R-Wyo.,
William Ruckelhaus, former head of the Environmental Protection
Agency, and Nathaniel Reed, a former assistant secretary.
   _ Transportation. Besides Fuller, others who might fit the bill
are Gov. Thomas Kean of New Jersey and Rep. Guy Molinari, R-N.Y.
   While jockeying continues at other places, such as the
agriculture department and the EPA, no front-runners seem to have
emerged.

   Rival Shiite militiamen fought fierce
street battles on Saturday, and the pro-Syrian forces drove the
Iranian-backed fighters out of most of west Beirut. Police said 25
people were killed and 54 wounded.
   Also Saturday, the International Red Cross began pulling out its
Swiss staff from Lebanon, 10 days after one of its employees was
kidnapped in Sidon.
   Sources at the International Committee for the Red Cross in
Beirut said the all-Swiss organization will close its operation
throughout Lebanon if Peter Winkler, head of the Sidon office, is
not freed by Dec. 3.
   The ultimatum came as fighting intensified between the rival
militias. The pro-Syrian Amal militia drove out the fundamentalist
Hezbollah, backed by Iran, from most of west Beirut on the second
day of street battles, police reported.
   ``We've finished them. We killed all 11 Hezbollahis who were
terrorizing the whole neighborhood by sniper fire,'' said the local
Amal commander who identified himself only as Bahij.
   A police spokesman said 25 people were killed and 54 wounded in
the last 24 hours in the fighting between Hezbollah, or Party of
God, and Amal, Arabic for hope. That raised the overall toll to 35
dead and 74 wounded since the conflict began in Beirut's southern
slums Wednesday.
   The fighting moved into central city districts Friday.
   Winkler, 32, was kidnapped from his car by three unidentified
gunmen on Nov. 17. No group claimed responsibility.
   The Sidon Red Cross office shut down on Wednesday to protest
Winkler's abduction. Three of its staff left Saturday for Geneva,
leaving about 28 in the country, said the Red Cross sources, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Police believe the Fatah-Revolutionary Council faction led by
Palestinian terrorist mastermind Abu Nidal carried out the
kidnapping on behalf of Hezbollah, which has no presence in Sidon.
   Abu Nidal's organization has claimed responsibility for scores of
terrorist attacks, including those at Rome and Vienna airports in
December 1985.
   The Fatah-Revolutionary Council has long been allied with
Hezbollah, which is believed to be the umbrella for fundamentalist
Shiite factions holding most of the foreign hostages, including nine
Americans.
   In Sidon, a southern port city, Lebanese and foreign humanitarian
organizations went on strike Saturday to protest Winkler's abduction
and the apparent kidnapping of Belgian doctor Jan Cools.
   Cools, 32, disappeared May 21 after leaving his apartment in a
Palestinian refugee camp near the southern port of Tyre, 25 miles
south of Sidon.
   He worked at the camp for Norwac, a Norwegian humanitarian group,
for three months before he vanished. No group has claimed
responsibility.
   Gilbert Holleufer, International Red Cross spokesman in Lebanon,
said the suspension of activities in Sidon will cut back assistance
for war-disabled people at a Red Cross orthopedic center there. The
Swiss technicians have left.
   In Beirut, the estimated 12,000 Syrian troops in charge of
security in the city's Moslem sector offered safe conduct for
surrendering Hezbollahis but made no serious effort to stop the
fighting.
   The new clashes between Hezbollah and Amal, struggling for
dominance of the 1 million Shiites, Lebanon's largest sect, also
appeared to reflect growing strain between Syria and Iran. The
Syria-Iran alliance has weakened since the Aug. 20 cease-fire in the
eight-year war between Iran and Iraq.
   Police said that by Saturday afternoon Amal had evicted Hezbollah
from eight west Beirut districts and was closing in on their
militants in the three other neighborhoods.
   About 25 Hezbollah gunmen were seen surrendering to Syrian troops
in the Zokak Blatt district after Amal fighters surrounded them in a
high school.
   The Hezbollah fighters handed over their weapons to a Syrian army
captain, who sent them off in seven private cars. The officer
refused to talk to reporters.
   The Amal leader in Zokak Blatt, Ayman Shirri, said the Hezbollah
fighters were being taken to the Iranian Embassy ``where they
belong.''

   WASHINGTON _ Democratic lawmakers want more from President-elect
George Bush than his promise to start bargaining over the federal
deficit his first day in office. They'd like a detailed budget,
spelling out how he would cut spending and honor his pledge of no
new taxes.
   ``How do you negotiate with someone who has no position?'' askedd
Rep. William H. Gray III, D-Pa., the outgoing House Budget Committee
chairman who may be a member of the chamber's Democratic leadership
next year.
   The start of the fiscal 1990 budget wars is just weeks away, yet
Bush has declined to provide details of his ``flexible freeze.'' The
vice president touted the proposal for balancing the budget
frequently during his election campaign, but he has revealed few
specifics.
   Gray, in the Democratic radio address Saturday, called on Reagan
and Bush to join together in putting together a budget that includes
Bush's economic plans.
   ``This would be the single most effective way to reassure the
nation and the world that we are on a responsible fiscal course,''
Gray said.
   He said a failure of Bush to present his plan would be ``a
terrible mistake'' and send the wrong signal to financial markets
and Congress.
   ``That is the road to dissension and stalemate, not to a
solution,'' Gray said.
   Some Republicans, however, are urging Bush not to produce a
detailed budget of his own next year. That would let him avoid
revealing his positions until he begins negotiations with Congress,
and could allow him to blame Democrats if taxes are included in
whatever budget package emerges.
   ``Congress would like to take very few positions, if any, until
they have completely destroyed Reagan's budget or the
president-elect's budget,'' said Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., ranking
Republican on the Senate Budget Committee. ``He shouldn't give them
that opportunity.''
   Domenici met for an hour last Tuesday with Richard Darman, whom
Bush has named as his budget director. The senator said he urged
Darman not to introduce detailed budget revisions and said, ``He's
leaning in that direction.''
   Bush himself said last week that he had not decided whether to
introduce a spending plan of his own.
   With the transition under way, lawmakers and others are searching
for indications of how Bush intends to chop the deficit for fiscal
1990, which begins next Oct. 1, to $100 billion, the target required
by law. To reach that goal, administration officials believe $35
billion in deficit reduction will be needed.
   Early indications are that clues to Bush's intentions won't be
revealed on Jan. 9, when President Reagan presents his last budget
to Congress. Reagan leaves office 11 days later.
   Reagan administration officials said last week they would soon
finish a spending plan reflecting the priorities of Reagan, not
Bush. So far, they said, they have kept Bush aides apprised of their
work, but the transition team has not helped shape the final product.
   ``We're not going to be proposing a quote flexible freeze concept
as part of Ronald Reagan's last budget,'' said Joseph R. Wright, the
outgoing director of the president's Office of Management and
Budget. ``Are there any specific George Bush proposals from the
election? No, there are not.''
   Bush could, if he chooses, submit revisions to Reagan's
blueprint, a practice that has been routine for incoming chief
executives since President Eisenhower took office in 1953.
   But this time it may be different.
   Democrats want to force Bush to release details on how he will
fulfill his campaign promises of reducing the deficit and increasing
spending for anti-drug, environment and other programs without
raising taxes.
   A strategy of bargaining rather than laying out a program might
be ``very smart politics,'' as House Democratic Whip Tony Coelho,
D-Calif., conceded last week. But it has angered Democrats and could
backfire in the long-run by creating a bitter climate that could
prolong the always difficult budget negotiations.
   ``It's a total copout,'' said Coelho. ``He said he'd be specific
after the election. He campaigned on a falsehood.''
   Bush has said his flexible freeze would balance the budget in a
few years by limiting overall federal spending increases to the rate
of inflation. Under the economic projections he has used, federal
revenues would grow faster than that and would soon overtake
spending.
   He has promised no new taxes, no Social Security cuts, no lagging
of defense spending behind inflation, and no slowdown in the growth
of priority programs.
   Critics have said his economic assumptions are much too
optimistic, and that by exempting defense and Social Security from
cuts _ along with the $150 billion annual interest payments on the
debt _ his spending slashes would have to come from only one-third
of the $1.1 trillion budget.

   President Reagan urged Americans on
Saturday to reject ``the siren song'' of trade protectionism and
vowed to push in December for greater U.S. access to overseas
markets.
   In his last nationally broadcast radio address from the
presidential ranch in the Santa Ynez Mountains near here, Reagan
pledged to have U.S. trade negotiators fight in Montreal next month
for more protection for U.S. intellectual property rights,
investments and trade in services, as well as goods.
   The president was referring to a mid-term review of the so-called
Uruguay Round of negotiations under the auspices of the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, a multilateral pact in which the
United States and some 95 other countries meet and discuss problems
sin the field of international trade and competition.
   Reagan used Saturday's adddres to again hail the election victory
of Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney early last week, saying
the voters of Canada sent a message to the world rejecting
protectionist sentiment.
   In this country, he said, the multimillion-dollar trade deficits
of recent years had ``led some misguided politicians to call for
protectionism, warning that, otherwise, we would lose jobs. But they
were wrong again. In fact, the United States not only didn't lose
jobs, we created more jobs than all the countries of Western Europe,
Canada and Japan combined.
   ``We too often talk about trade while using the vocabulary of
war. In war, for one side to win, the other must lose,'' he said.
``But commerce is not warfare. Trade is an economic alliance that
benefits both countries. There are no losers, only winners.''
   Reagan argued that ``today, protectionism is being used by some
American politicians as a cheap form of nationalism. ... Our
peaceful trading partners are not our enemies. They are our allies.
We should be beware of the demigogues who are ready to declare a
trade war against our friends.''
   He said the expansion of the international economy ``is not a
foreign invasion. It is an American triumph.''
   Reagan said that when the multilateral trade talks open Dec. 5 in
Montreal, ``we will be in the forefront of efforts to improve this
system.''
   ``We want to open more markets for our markets, to see to it that
all nations play by the rules, and to seek improvement in such areas
as dispute resolution and agriculture,'' he said.
   ``Our negotiators will be working hard for all of us,'' the
president promised.
   Reagan, as he has in the past, raised the ghost of the
Smoot-Hawley Act of 1930, a tariff law which he said had led to the
Great Depression, in which one out of four Americans lost their jobs.
   ``Ever since that time, Americans have stayed true to our
heritage by rejecting the siren song of protectionism,'' Reagan said.
   The five-minute radio address, broadcast from a make-shift studio
step up in a house-trailer on Reagan's 688-acre property, was
Reagan's last from the ranch.
   The president concludes a six-day vacation Sunday and flies back
to Washington. No more visits are scheduled to Rancho del Cielo
before Reagan's term ends on Jan. 20, although the president and his
wife, Nancy, will spend about 10 days around Christmas and New
Year's Day attending parties and visiting friends in Los Angeles and
Palm Springs, Calif.

   Here is the text of the Democrats' response to
President Reagan's weekly radio address, given by Rep. William H.
Gray III of Pennsylvania:
   Thanksgiving is a uniquely American holiday when we make a point
of giving thanks to the Lord for our material blessings. President
Reagan is understandably proud of the way that much of the American
economy has performed in this sixth year of continued growth.
   The president has spoken about international trade and the need
to avoid protectionism. All of us agree that protectionism is not
the answer to our trade deficit. We need open trade, but we also
need fair trade and a level playing field. Our international balance
_ which turned from a surplus in 1980 to a huge $154 billion deficit
last year _ illustrates how we can misuse our bountiful resources
with the wrong policies. The trade deficit has destroyed jobs and
eroded our industrial base. But the trade deficit fundamentally
means that we spend more than we produce, and that basic imbalance
results from the budget deficit.
   Everyone knows that it is now time to deal with the budget
deficit. The plunge of the dollar and the tremors in the financial
markets right after the election gave a clear signal. The world is
waiting impatiently for U.S. leadership.
   The nation and President-elect Bush now have a unique and
unprecedented opportunity. For the first time in 132 years we have a
vice president moving up to become president. We have a continuity
of administration, already reflected in Mr. Bush's reappointment of
some of President Reagan's most important Cabinet officers. In some
areas Mr. Bush is actively governing. He has met with major foreign
leaders and with the speaker of the House.
   President-elect Bush and President Reagan can take advantage of
this unique opportunity to push the nation rapidly towards a fiscal
solution. All they need to do is have Mr. Bush resent his budget
program when the president's budget is submitted to the Congress, as
required by law, in January. That is what the nation and the world
are waiting for _ the new president's vision and program, which is
the essential basis for budget deliberations and action by the
Congress.
   I am therefore asking President Reagan and President-elect Bush
to join together and begin work now on a budget embodying Mr. Bush's
program, to be presented to Congress in January. To accomplish this,
President Reagan should make available the resources of the Office
of Management and Budget to President-elect Bush, his OMB
Director-designate Mr. Darman, and his transition team.
   This would be the single most effective way to reassure the
nation and the world that we are on a responsible fiscal course.
Democrats in Congress want to join the new administration in solving
the deficit problem and solving it quickly. This year we passed all
the budget legislation before the beginning of the fiscal year. If
we push ahead now, we can do the same next year.
   Mr. Bush told the American people during the election campaign
that he had a plan to reduce the deficit. It was called a ``flexible
freeze.'' He said ti would reduce the deficit without raising taxes,
protect social security, provide the resources for a sound defense,
and allow increased funding for education, protection of the
environment, and other vital national priorities. These are all
admirable goals. If they are mutually attainable, they will have
great appeal and support in Congress. That's why the Reagan-Bush
budget should be ready in January, not sometime much later in the
spring.
   Lately there have been disturbing reports in the press that
President-elect Bush is being advised not to present a budget plan
that shows his own vision and program, but instead to sit down and
negotiate with Congress without a plan. I hope that these reports
are wrong. A failure to present a fiscal plan for the nation would
be a terrible mistake. It would send the wrong signal to the
financial markets _ that we will continue to delay rather than to
act. It would send the wrong signal to the Congress _ that a new
administration will not be responsible and accountable for its
policies. that is the road to dissension and stalemate, not to a
solution.
   It is essential to move ahead now to solve the budget problem, to
bring the trade deficit down, and to solidify our economic future.
The American people, the new Congress and the world are waiting for
some good, old-fashioned leadership and vision. The opportunity is
here, and the time is now.

   Former ``Adam 12'' stars Martin Milner
and Kent McCord aim to become television partners again, playing
1980s cops in a tentative new cable TV production, ``Nashville
Beat.''
   The 26 half-hour episodes under consideration would feature
Milner as Nashville's old-fashioned chief of detectives and McCord
as a hip, undercover cop from Los Angeles who has been recruited to
Nashville by Milner, said Michael Marcovsky, chairman of NAC
Productions.
   ``This series will be filmed entirely on location in Nashville
and will reflect the energy and excitement of the city's legendary
country and rock music scene,'' Marcovsky said Friday.
   NAC plans to produce the series with Buck Productions, headed by
McCord. Production hinges on negotiations with cable networks to
schedule the series, which would open with a two-hour movie,
Marcovsky said.

   Spanish opera tenor Jose Carreras says his charity
concert at the Vatican will be part of a continuing struggle against
leukemia, the disease that struck him last year.
   All proceeds from the Dec. 9 concert will be donated to the
Italian Association Against Leukemia and will go toward building
hospitality centers in Italy for families of leukemia patients, said
Gian Franco Imperatori, chairman of the association.
   Organizers did not say how much they expect to raise from the
concert, which will feature the South American Creole Mass, a
combination of Argentine composer Ariel Ramirez's melodies and
traditional Argentine and Hispanic-American regional songs.
   ``I thought in this spirit of the year, in December, that to do a
Mass is very appropriate,'' Carreras said at a news conference
Friday. ``Of course I am doing it in Rome for obvious reasons _ the
head office of the Italian Association Against Leukemia is here and
Italy is a place I consider my second country. And to do a Mass in
Rome, it has to be at the Vatican.''
   Carreras, 42, has become an internationally renowned operatic
tenor since his debut in 1970.
   He was treated last year in Spain and the United States for
leukemia, and his doctors said he no longer has symptoms of the
disease, according to a spokeswoman.

   A post-wedding gift for hockey star Wayne Gretzky
_ a stick once used by the legendary Gordie Howe _ was stolen
shortly before its intended delivery.
   Dr. Murray Howe, Gordie Howe's son, planned to give Gretzky the
hockey stick after the Los Angeles Kings of the National Hockey
League played the Detroit Red Wings here Wednesday.
   ``I took so many precautions to hand-deliver it so it wouldn't
get lost in the mail or something like that. It was one of my dad's
old sticks that he used in the playoffs during the 1950s,'' said
Howe, who played with Gretzky when they were teens in the mid-1970s.
   ``I didn't know how much Janet would appreciate it, but I knew
Wayne would,'' he said. ``My dad was Wayne's idol, so I thought I
would bring it ... and surprise him with it.''
   As Howe watched the Kings defeat Detroit 8-3, the stick was at
his feet. But when the game ended, it was gone.
   ``My feet were right on top of it. I don't know how they got
it,'' Howe said.
   Gretzky, former star of the Edmonton Oilers, married actress
Janet Jones in August. He was traded to the Kings later that month.

   Barbara Walters, whose 50th television special
will feature a compilation of interviews from a dozen years of her
programs, says she's never delved into sensationalism.
   ``Nobody sits and describes their perversions,'' she said of her
specials in a recent interview. ``In all our interviews over 12
years, there isn't one that's prurient.''
   The 50th show, to be broadcast Tuesday, will feature interviews
with personalities ranging from the Shah of Iran to Cher.
   With flying chairs, fisticuffs, shouting and discussion of
unusual sexual practices appearing on talk shows, Walters was asked
her opinion of other interviewers.
   She said ``The Morton Downey Jr. Show,'' on which verbal and
sometimes physical sparring is common, is entertaining but not a
show she would watch every week ``because I really don't believe
it.''
   Walters said she hasn't seen ``Geraldo,'' though she worked with
its host, Geraldo Rivera, on ABC's ``20@20.'' ``I only saw the
clips of it when the chair hit him in the nose,'' she said,
referring to the highly publicized melee that erupted earlier this
month during a show on white supremacists.
   Walters said she believes both Phil Donahue's ``Donahue'' and
Oprah Winfrey's ``Oprah'' are trying to compete with the sometimes
sensational content of ``Geraldo.''
   ``In a way, that's unfortunate,'' she said.

<HEAD>Gov't Releases Two Black Leaders On Medical, Humanitarian Grounds</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GREG MYRE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government released two
aging and ailing black leaders Saturday, both colleagues of African
National Congress chief Nelson Mandela and prisoners for more than a
decade.
   Harry Gwala, 69, a longtime member of the outlawed ANC, and
Zephania Mothopeng, 75, president of the Pan Africanist Congress
``were released unconditionally on medical-humanitarian grounds,''
the Prisons Service said in a brief statement.
   Gwala was freed from Westville Prison in the Indian Ocean city of
Durban and Mothopeng was released from Diepkloof Prison in the
Soweto township outside Johannesburg.
   Gwala has spent more than 20 years in prison and was serving a
life sentence for his involvement with the ANC guerrilla movement.
   ``I'm very much excited, this came unexpectedly,'' Gwala said in
a telephone interview from his home in the southeastern city of
Pietermaritzburg.
   Gwala is suffering from ``motor-neuron disease,'' a degenerative
neurological disorder with no known cure. Gwala said the illness has
left his arms paralyzed, but his mind is clear.
   Mothopeng, who has been seriously ill for several months, was a
member of the ANC during the 1940s and 1950s. He broke from the
organization in 1959 to help establish the Pan Africanist Congress.
   Both organizations are engaged in armed resistance against the
white-led government. However, the Pan Africanist Congress favors
black self-sufficiency in the struggle for political rights, while
the ANC supports a multiracial approach.
   Mothopeng was arrested in 1976 and sentenced to 15 years in
prison for his involvement with the outlawed organization. He was
elected president of the Pan Africanist Congress in 1986 despite his
imprisonment.
   Gwala and Mothopeng became friends when they were both imprisoned
on Robben Island off Cape Town in the early 1980s, Gwala said.
   The releases are likely to further fuel speculation that Mandela
will be freed in coming months.
   The government's decision also is the latest move apparently
aimed at reducing domestic and international pressure on South
Africa. In the past week, the government has:
   _Announced that Mandela, the country's best known black leader,
would not return to prison when he completes his recovery from
tuberculosis at a Cape Town hospital. However, Mandela will remain
in custody at a ``suitable'' location, the government added.
   _Endorsed a regional peace plan under which South Africa would
grant independence to South-West Africa, also known as Namibia.
   _Granted clemency to the ``Sharpville Six,'' a group of blacks
sentenced to death for complicity in a 1984 mob killing. The death
sentences, replaced with lengthy jail terms, had provoked
international protest.
   ``One is thankful that it looks like the milk of human kindness
is not running dry with our government,'' Anglican Archbishop
Desmond Tutu said of Gwala's release.
   However, Tutu added: ``The track record of our government does
not give us too much hope that they are likely to act on only
humanitarian grounds. They take political considerations into
account much more than acting on humanitarian grounds.''
   Gwala said he still ``fully supported the goals of the ANC,'' the
largest black guerrilla movement in South Africa. He said he did not
know if he would resume his political activities due to the ``tough
conditions under the state of emergency.''
   State-of-emergency regulations in effect since 1986 restrict
reporting about unrest, security force actions, treatment of
detainees, some forms of protest, and a broad range of statements
the government considers subversive. Enforcement of the regulations
has not been comprehensive.
   Gwala joined the then-legal ANC in 1944 and helped organize
anti-apartheid protests during the following decade. He served in
prison from 1964-72 following a conviction on sabotage. He was
arrested in 1975 and detained for two years. In 1977, he was
sentenced to life in prison for involvement with the ANC.
   Mothopeng was a member of the ANC Youth League in the 1940s and
helped organize anti-apartheid protests. In 1960, a year after he
helped found the Pan Africanist Congress, he was arrested and
sentenced to two years in prison for his political activities.
   Mothopeng was a teacher and education administrator in the Soweto
township outside Johannesburg and was detained for varying lengths
of time in the 1960s and 1970s.
   Under apartheid, the 26 million blacks have no vote in national
affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain
separate districts.

   Many of the 15 inmates of the federal
prison near Talladega who are slated for return to Cuba say they
worry about bad times and possible reprisals on the island they fled.
   ``All you need to know about Cuba you can learn by looking at the
number of Cubans who have come here,'' said Mario Sosa Hernandez,
who has been in prison since being caught in San Francisco in 1984
with $25 worth of heroin he insists wasn't his. ``I could get hurt a
lot if I have to go back there.''
   Sosa said his record in Cuba was clean before Fidel Castro's
communist takeover in 1959. ``After the victory of the revolution I
had a problem with some violence, and with marijuana,'' he mused,
his hands cuffed behind his back in a tiny locked interview room.
   Sosa, 50, and the other 14 were among the 125,000 Cubans who
arrived on the five-month ``Freedom Flotilla'' boatlift from the
Cuban port of Mariel in 1980.
   In the wake of U.S. charges that Castro had used the boatlift as
an opportunity to rid Cuba of some prison and mental hospital
inmates, the Cuban leader agreed in 1984 to take 2,700 of the
boatlift people back. But after taking only a fraction of that
number, Castro rescinded the agreement in 1985.
   When Cuba announced a year ago that it would resume the
agreement, Cubans fearing deportation grabbed guards as hostages at
federal prisons in Atlanta and Oakdale, La., holding the prisons for
nearly two weeks.
   The 15 inmates in prison here are among 114 who are in
Immigration and Naturalization Service custody because of past
crimes and have been denied parole. Many others among the original
list of 2,700 are either paroled or are in state custody.
   The U.S. Justice Department so far has reviewed 28 of the 114
cases and decided on deportation for the 15.
   Federal courts have ruled that Cubans classified as ``excludable
aliens'' can be held indefinitely until they are deemed ready for
parole or are accepted by Cuba or another country.
   Lawyers for the Cubans are seeking an administrative review, and
the government has delayed deportations until the issue is decided.
   Meanwhile, the 15 wait with 99 countrymen at Talladega, two to an
85-square-foot cell with five hours of exercise and three showers a
week. When they leave the cells, they are in cuffs and chains.
   They say it beats Cuban jails. The Justice Department panels
consider, among other things, the inmate's behavior in Cuba and in
American prisons, his potential for violence, job prospects and
personal harm that might follow a return to Cuba.
   Renato Oliva-Sanchez, arrested for selling cocaine in 1983, said
he had a clean record in Cuba until he got in trouble with the army
for refusing to serve in a special services unit.
   Oliva, who had a string of lesser arrests before his last one,
said his contact with family members here and in Cuba has been
``very sporadic.''
   Most of his family, he said, is in the Cuban military or
otherwise close to the government. ``When I write, I have to send
the letters to another family and they give them to my family. I
can't write directly.''
   The United States sent 201 Cubans back before Cuba suspended the
1984 repatriation agreement in 1985. Of the 201, about 156 are free
after spending six weeks in quarantine. A few have died. Those with
time left on their American sentences are serving it.

<HEAD>Winner Of $14.3 Million Lottery Moved To U.S. In Search Of Riches</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LAGUNA HILLS, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 23-year-old man who moved to the
United States from Turkey seven months ago in search of riches found
them last week when he won $14.3 million in the California Lottery.
   ``I told my family I would be a millionaire by the age of 25,''
said Zafer Altintas. ``I didn't think I would win the millions. I
thought I would have to earn it myself.''
   Altintas made his fortune with a $3 investment, buying three
tickets in Wednesday's ``Lotto 6-49'' game and picking all six
winning numbers on one of the tickets. One of the winning numbers,
39, was picked by mistake; Altintas said he meant to mark 38 on the
card.
   Since learning he will be a millionaire, Altintas quit his
$6.50-an-hour job as a hotel housekeeper, treated his friends to a
champagne brunch and bought a new car.
   ``I was planning to buy the car anyway, but I was just waiting
until March to get my income tax return to make the down payment,''
he said. ``I went there and the salesman recognized me from
television, and they gave me the car.''
   He said he plans to use some of his winnings, which will be paid
in 20 annual installments, to build a luxury hotel on Turkey's west
coast, buy a home for himself, another for his mother in Istanbul
and a car for his brother.
   Altintas, an American citizen, was born in St. Louis but reared
in Turkey.

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The latest appointee to the city's Emergency
Shelter Commission has plenty of experience dealing with the
problems of people who have no place to go _ he's been homeless
himself for the past two years.
   Michael McGuire, 71, who immigrated from Northern Ireland to the
United States 37 years ago and worked as a house painter for much of
his life, was appointed to the commission by Mayor Raymond Flynn.
The mayor announced the appointment at a Thanksgiving dinner at the
Long Island Hospital Shelter, where McGuire has lived for the past
year.
   City officials had decided to appoint a homeless person to the
panel and McGuire impressed the mayor with his ability to get along
with people and his concern on the issue of homelessness, said
commission director Ann Maguire.
   ``He is someone who had been working his whole life and, all of a
sudden, he became homeless. That is a perspective that is a little
different than other people we're dealing with,'' she said.
   McGuire said he hopes to make the most of his new position.
   ``I'll try to do what I can,'' he told The Boston Globe in a
story published Saturday. ``I'm not a politician. ... I'm a nice guy
and I'm not trouble. Maybe I can help people.''
   McGuire said he is content at the shelter: ``Everybody is
friendly, the nurses are lovely and they don't holler at you.''
However, he said the menu could use a little revision. ``You get a
lot of macaroni here,'' he said. ``Let's see a hamburger once in a
while.''
   He also would like to see things like a pool table, table tennis,
shuffleboard and card tables at the shelter.
   And he would like to move into an apartment of his own.
   McGuire, who was divorced about 25 years ago and has four
children living in Florida, said in a telephone interview Saturday
that he moved from Florida to New Jersey in the 1970s, and retired
in 1977. He wouldn't say where he lived in New Jersey.
   He said trouble began two years ago when he came to Boston by
train with a casual acquaintance he met in Penn Station in New York
City. After he got off the train, his friend disappeared and he
found himself stranded in a city where he knew no one.
   He said he started drinking and hanging out in the street.
   Police referred him to Boston City Hospital where he was directed
to the Long Island Hospital shelter.
   The other commission members are a minister and representatives
of the city Department of Health and Hospitals, the city Public
Facilities Department and the Pine Street Inn shelter.

<TEXT>
   One hundred and sixty-three years of collective
experience will be missing from the Senate floor when the 101st
Congress convenes in January.
   Seven senators are departing by their own choice, including the
one elected vice president who gives up his seat and vote on the
floor to move to the status of presiding officer.
   Four were shown the door by voters.
   The departures will force a reshuffling of several key positions
inside the 200-year old lawmaking body, including the chairmanships
of its Appropriations, Budget and Banking committees. All are
important players in a year in which the federal budget deficit is
expected to dominate legislative scorecards.
   Six of those leaving the Senate have served a dozen or more years.
   The list includes the Senate's oldest and most senior member,
Sen. John Stennis, D-Miss., 87, who, after 41 years of service, is
perhaps the chamber's most revered member.
   Stennis, who for years had pledged to ``plough my row to the
end,'' is leaving somewhat reluctantly, his decision spurred by his
advanced age and uncertain health. He was severely wounded in a
robbery attempt in 1973 and has been confined to a wheelchair since
he lost a leg to cancer several years ago.
   The senator's departure opens up the chairmanship of the Senate
Appropriations Committee as well as the position of president pro
tempore, the Senate's highest constitutional office.
   Under the law, Stennis was third in line of succession to the
presidency, following the vice president and the Speaker of the
House.
   Stennis almost certainly will be replaced both in the
Appropriations chairmanship and as president pro tem by Sen. Robert
C. Byrd, D-W.Va., who is stepping down as Senate majority leader.
   Another retiree, Sen. William Proxmire, D-Wis., 73, is ending a
31-year career that began when he won a special 1957 election to
succeed the controversial Sen. Joseph R. McCarthy.
   Proxmire missed only 18 roll call votes in his more than three
decades of service and none in the last 22 years. He cast 10,261
consecutive votes from April 1966 until the 100th Congress adjourned
last month. A total 12,152 roll calls were taken in the Senate since
Proxmire arrived in 1957. Proxmire was present and voting for 99.85
percent of them.
   He delivered more than 3,300 consecutive daily speeches on the
U.S. failure to ratify the 1948 treaty making genocide a crime and
persisted until the Senate ratified the pace and passed implementing
legislation making genocide a crime under U.S. law.
   For this, Proxmire was hailed by B'Nai B'rith as one whose name
``will be forever enshrined in the Pantheon of heroes who have
fought so gallantly on behalf of man's humanity to man.''
   Proxmire is perhaps best known by the public at large as father
of the monthly ``Golden Fleece'' awards which, since March of 1975,
targeted Proxmire's choices for ``the biggest example of ridiculous,
ironic or wasteful spending.''
   One example: a federal grant for a study of why prisoners want to
escape from jail.
   He has announced that the award of the Golden Fleece will
continue after his Senate tenure ends. He will continue to issue it
as a member of the board of directors of the National Taxpayers
Union.
   Proxmire was chairman of the Senate Banking Committee and
responsible for significant legislation in the field. He was a
senior member of the Appropriations Committee. He often called being
a member of the Senate ``the best job in the country, bar none,''
better even than being president.
   While Stennis and Proxmire went to the sidelines voluntarily,
Sen. Lowell Weicker, R-Conn., was shoved there by Connecticut's
voters, losing a tight race to state Atty. Gen. Joseph Lieberman.
   Weicker, heir to a Squibb pharmaceutical fortune, was the
Senate's most liberal and independent Republican, an outspoken
advocate who loudly and vigorously opposed the social agenda of
conservatives.
   He gained national attention in 1973 as a member of the Senate
Watergate Committee which he used as a forum to denounce the
activities of President Nixon and his staff.
   Also ending careers as senators this year are:
   _Sen. Daniel Quayle, R-Ind., 41, who, by virtue of his election
to the vice presidency, will become president of the Senate and,
when he chooses, preside over its deliberations. But he can only
vote to break a tie. Quayle's selection as George Bush's vice
presidential running mate touched off a storm of criticism over his
alleged lack of credentials to succeed to the nation's highest
office and his alleged use of family influence to win him a place in
the Indiana National Guard, thus avoiding combat service in Vietnam.
Quayle was elected to the Senate in 1980.
   _Sen. Lawton Chiles, D-Fla., 58, chairman of the Senate Budget
Committee, and a major figure in the congressional battles over the
massive federal budget deficit. Chiles first won election in 1970
after walking his state and earning the nickname, ``Walkin'
Lawton.'' Chiles was heavily favored to win re-election and his
decision to skip the race was a surprise. He said he had lost his
enthusiasm for the job. ``At some stage, maybe there is a burnout,''
he said.
   _Sen. Daniel Evans, R-Wash., 58, a 12-year governor of Washington
was appointed to his seat after the death of Sen. Henry Jackson,
D-Wash., in September 1983. Evans, a member of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, also expressed frustration with the job,
complaining of a lack of substantive debate and said the Senate's
eratic schedule had often denied him a personal life.
   _Sen. Robert T. Stafford, R-Vt., 75, a former Vermont governor,
was a member of the House when he was appointed in 1971 to fill the
unexpired term of Sen. Winston Prouty, D-Vt., who had died. He had
previously served as a prosecutor, state attorney general and
lieutenant governor. His Senate career focused on the environment
and education.
   _Paul Trible, R-Va., 42, said he was quitting the Senate after
one term because he wanted to spend more time with his family. He is
widely expected to become a candidate for governor of Virginia. In
the Senate, Trible was a member of the Senate Iran-Contra
investigating committee and compiled a conservative voting record.
   _John Melcher, D-Mont., 64, by profession a veternarian, lost the
Senate seat he had held since 1976 in an upset to Republican Conrad
Burns, a farm broadcaster. In the Senate, Melcher concentrated on
farm issues. During the Iran-Contra affair he complained about those
who described members of the National Security Council staff as
freewheeling ``White House cowboys.'' That was demeaning to cowboys,
Melcher said.
   _Chic Hecht, R-Nev., 59, a conservative clothing store owner who
was almost invisible in the Senate, was beaten in his bid for a
second term by Democratic Gov. Richard Bryan. Hecht was known for
slips of the tongue and once refered to a proposed nuclear dump site
in his state as a ``nuclear supository.''
   _David K. Karnes, R-Neb., at 39 the youngest of the departing
senators, was appointed to his seat in March 1987 to fill the
vacancy created by the death of Sen. Edward Zorinsky, a Democrat. He
was defeated by former Democratic Gov. Robert Kerrey after a
campaign in which Karnes, in a major gaffe, told his Farm Belt
voters that ``we need fewer farmers.''

   Clustered around television sets, South
Koreans have been watching the first political hearings in the
nation's history with a mix of fascination, indignation and pride.
   The National Assembly has been conducting extensive public
hearings into corruption, human rights violations and other abuses
under the authoritarian government of former president Chun Doo-hwan.
   The hearings, which began early this month and could go into
1989, have bewitched millions of South Koreans. The live broadcasts
have set new viewing records and life has noticeably slowed in Seoul
and other cities as people have flocked around TV sets to catch
latest developments.
   ``What was seen (on television) was so shocking, although it had
vaguely been guessed at, that people lost even the strength to speak
out,'' said Chong Un-bung, an editor of The Korea Times newspaper.
   Koreans have witnessed once powerful former generals and
ministers questioned, berated and denounced by lawmakers demanding
answers about the repressive Chun years. People who endured the
restraints of the Chun government shake their heads in wonder at how
the political situation has changed.
   ``Everyone is watching,'' said Cho Jin-sun, an office worker.
``What is happening is unbelievable.''
   Office employees routinely gather around televisions at work to
watch the hearings; televisions in train and bus stations and
airports are thronged by watchers; and shops and restaurants show
the hearings to attract customers.
   Some colleges delayed examinations because many students were too
busy watching the hearings to study.
   Police report that traffic has dipped when major figures have
appeared at the hearings. People say they rearrange their work and
social schedules to accomodate the hearings, the first ever
televised.
   The National Assembly had limited powers to hold hearings in the
past, but a 1987 constitution empowered the legislature to
investigate government affairs.
   South Koreans, accustomed to decades of censorship and
authoritarian governments, have been astonished by the flood of
revelations. It has fueled even more anger and resentment against
Chun.
   ``All misdeeds and corruption must be exposed,'' said Lee
Kyung-jai, a journalist.
   The revelations played a major role in forcing Chun to apologize
to the nation Wednesday for abuses, surrender his property and go
into rural exile at a Buddhist monastery. Some of his relatives and
associates have been convicted or charged with embezzlement and
other crimes.
   In his televised apology, Chun said to the nation, ``How much
have you been enraged by a flood of unsavory TV, radio, magazine and
newspaper reports about me?''
   Chun, a former general who took power with military backing in
1980, left office at the end of a seven-year term in February.
President Roh Tae-woo, who took over after winning last December's
presidential election, has pledged to introduce full democracy.
   Roh on Saturday urged an end to the hearings by Dec. 31 and said
his administration would actively investigate any unanswered
questions, but the opposition lawmakers who dominate the National
Assembly have pledged a thorough probe.
   Political analysts say the hearings are part of a shift toward an
enduring democratic system for the first time since the nation's
creation in 1948.
   ``It probably will change the style and quality of Korea's
politics for good,'' said analyst Rhee Chong-ik.
   But South Koreans have also discovered that public hearings do
not necessarily get to the truth and that witnesses and legislators
can be uncooperative or misguided.
   Television stations and newspapers say they have been flooded
with complaints that some witnesses have given vague or misleading
answers. People also complain that legislators are using the
hearings to seek national fame.
   ``One obvious negative fact is many politicians' overreactions
and emotional outbursts,'' said Rhee, the political analyst.
   Kim Sang-ho, a businessman who intently follows the hearings,
said the revelations were teaching Koreans what politics and
democracy really are. Others hope the hearings become a fixed part
of Korean politics to ensure officials are accountable.
   ``I believe parliamentary hearings are necessary to cultivate
democracy,'' he said.

<HEAD>Tighter Oil Market Could Spur Temporary Boost In Inflation,
Economists Say</HEAD>

   The new effort by OPEC to limit oil production,
if successful, will worsen inflationary pressures in the United
States at least temporarily and put more upward pressure on interest
rates, many economists believe.
   That would mean slower growth next year and make President-elect
George Bush's effort to trim the federal deficit without tax
increases even harder, these analysts said.
   Falling energy prices have been a key factor helping offset
drought-induced increases in food prices over the past several
months.
   But that fall apparently is about to be reversed. Instead of
declining, gasoline and heating oil costs will be rising, just as
the worst impact of the summer drought will be hitting grocery
stores, economists believe.
   These forecasts are being made even though analysts are skeptical
that the 13 nations of OPEC will be able to reach their target of
pushing oil prices up to $18 per barrel.
   Instead, a more likely outcome is that oil prices will rise to
between $15 and $16 per barrel, up from lows of $12 per barrel this
year.
   If that occurs, David Wyss, an economist at Data Resources Inc.,
predicted that consumer prices will climb at an annual rate
approaching 6 percent in the early months of 1989.
   That would be up from an expected rise in consumer prices of just
4.5 percent this year.
   However, economists predict this inflationary spike won't last
long because of their belief the new OPEC accord will fall apart as
various countries cheat on their quotas.
   ``The production cuts will soak up some of the excess inventories
and prices will firm,'' said Donald Ratajczak, director of the
economic forecasting project at Georgia State University. ``That
will last until the heating season tapers off at the end of February
when I believe energy prices will start falling again.''
   Because of his belief that cheating will keep OPEC from ever
reaching the 18.5 million-per-day production limit, Ratajczak said
he sees overall consumer prices climbing by about 4.5 percent next
year, essentially the same as for 1988.
   Wyss agreed that inflationary preassures should be at their worst
in the first three months of next year and then begin to ease.
However, he said if OPEC is more successful at limiting production
than analysts now believe, that could spell trouble, especially with
the United States already operating at near full-employment and with
U.S. factories producing at high operating rates.
   ``There is a danger that this inflationary spurt could set off a
wage-price spiral,'' Wyss said. In such an occurrence, higher energy
prices would be translated into higher costs for other goods, which
would prompt workers to demand bigger pay increases to keep up with
the rising costs.
   That would force the Federal Reserve to squeeze down on the
growth of the money supply and push up interest rates in an effort
to dampen an overheating economy.
   ``If the oil scenario went the worst way, then we are talking
about much higher interest rates and a probable recession in late
1989 or 1990,'' Wyss said.
   Even with just the small blip in inflation now expected, the Fed
is likely to be nudging interest rates higher in the months ahead,
which will mean slower growth next year, analysts said.
   Wyss said DRI is forecasting that the overall economy, as
measured by the gross national product, will expand at a sluggish
rate of 2.3 percent next year.
   That forecast is in line with the consensus view of 51 top
economists surveyed each month by Blue Chip Economic Indicators. But
it is far below the 3.5 percent GNP projection the Reagan
administration announced last Tuesday.
   Using more optimistic assumptions about overall growth, inflation
and interest rates, the administration says it only needs $35
billion in spending cuts to meet a target of $100 billion for the
federal deficit in the 1990 fiscal year, which begins next Oct. 1.
   However, Wyss said his firm's more pessimistic assumptions put
the total deficit cuts that will be needed next year at $55 billion,
a target that would virtually rule out the use of spending cuts
alone to meet the Gramm-Rudman $100 billion deficit reduction target.
   However, Bush, who must negotiate with Congress over the 1990
budget once Reagan leaves office, has consistently maintained that
he has no intention of going back on his campaign pledge not to
raise taxes, an assertion that has made financial markets jittery
since the election.

   Four men have been arrested in connection
with the vandalism of a 98-year-old Jewish cemetery and police
officers are giving varying accounts of what their motivation might
have been.
   Swastikas and anti-Jewish slurs were discovered at the B'nai
Israel Cemetery on Nov. 8, the day before the 50th anniversary of
Kristallnacht, the night of Nazi violence against Jews across
Germany that marked the start of the Nazi Holocaust. Germans called
it ``crystal night'' because of all the windows broken from Jewish
businesses and synagogues.
   Police have not officially determined if the desecration of about
a half-dozen tombstones and the entrance road was related to
Kristallnacht or an act of satanic worship, Sgt. Richard Flood said
Friday.
   But Lt. Gordon D. Tempest told The Woonsocket Call that police
believe as many as five individuals were involved in the attack as
part of a satanic-like cult.
   ``We've had conflicting reports, but we do believe that it is (a
cult),'' Tempest said. Tempest gave no details on what might suggest
cult involvement.
   The attorney general's office will review the case on Dec. 5,
said Sgt. Mario Andreoni.
   Police said they didn't believe the vandalism was connected to a
similar act at the Precious Blood Cemetery, a Roman Catholic
graveyard, which was discovered Nov. 18.
   Police arrested Steven S. Coutcher, 18, of Woonsocket, on
Wednesday and Bertrand C. Cabana, 23, of Providence, on Friday,
Flood said. Later Friday, George M. Neves, 19, of Central Falls, and
Thomas P. Elefsiades Jr., 18, of Pawtucket, were arrested, police
said.
   Coutcher admitted to his role in the vandalism and implicated two
others, said Detective William J. Shea.
   All four were charged with vandalism and desecration of a
cemetery and have been arraigned, police said. Two were released on
bail Friday and the other two on Saturday.
   If convicted, they face up to five years in jail and fines of up
to $10,000.

   Eastern Canada's strongest earthquake in 53 years,
which caused minor damage and no serious injuries, produced banner
headlines Saturday, from ``All Quebec Trembles'' to ``Shake, Rattle
'n Roll.''
   The jolt in Montreal disrupted the filming of a syndicated
television show during an earthquake scene and in Toronto, and a man
blamed his strange sensations on too much drinking.
   The earthquake at 6:48 p.m. EST Friday lasted more than two
minutes and measured 6 on the Richter scale, said John Adams of the
Ottawa-based Geological Survey of Canada. Its epicenter was in
Quebec's Charlevoix region, about 95 miles north of Quebec City, he
said.
   The quake cut power and telephone lines in some cities and shook
buildings from Nova Scotia on the Atlantic coast to the western
Ontario city of Sault Ste. Marie. The tremor was felt in the
northeastern United States from Michigan to Washington, D.C.
   ``This is the largest earthquake in Eastern Canada since 1935,''
Adams said.
   The quake buckled railroad tracks, triggered burglar alarms and
swept objects from tables and shelves throughout the affected area.
   The Canadian Press news agency reported that about 50 people were
treated for cuts and bruises or shock in Chicoutimi, about 90 miles
northwest of Quebec City.
   Publicist Jonathan Holiff of ``Starting from Scratch,'' a
syndicated comedy starring Connie Stevens and Bill Daly, told The
Gazette of Montreal that several props were set up to fall during
the show's earthquake scene, ``but a few more things fell off the
wall than were expected.''
   The show is being filmed at Tele-Metropole studios in Montreal.
   The Montreal newspaper Le Devoir, which headlined, ``All Quebec
Trembles,'' added, ``The Earthquake Sows Fear but Causes Nothing
More than Light Damage.''
   The tabloid Toronto Sun headlined ``Earthquake!'' and the
Montreal Daily News said ``Shake, Rattle 'n Roll.''
   ``I just thought I was drinking too much,'' Charles Miles, a
66-year-old downtown Toronto resident told the Toronto Star. ``The
landlord was fixing my sink but he didn't notice anything. That's
why I called (the newspaper) to find out if it was me or an
earthquake.''
   In the United States, where there were no reports of damage,
maitre d' Stephen Brown of Boston's Top of the Hub restaurant on the
52nd floor of the Prudential Center said 120 people were dining at
the time of the tremor.
   ``The entire dining room felt it. Everyone felt they were
becoming dizzy or faint. They all sort of smiled and looked at each
other,'' he said.
   New York Gov. Mario Cuomo said he was in the Executive Mansion in
Albany when ``the chandelier shook. The floor moved. It lasted about
10 seconds but it was something I'll remember for much longer than
that.''
   Canadian Press said the most severe power outages, which lasted
up to an hour, affected 250,000 people in the city of Quebec and
50,000 in Montreal. Quebec City police said a pedestrian was hit and
killed by a car in an intersection during the blackout.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude. An earthquake measuring 5 on the Richter scale can
cause considerable damage, a 6 reading severe damage, and a 7 is a
major earthquake.
   The strongest earthquake in Canada this century was recorded off
the coast of British Columbia in 1949 and measured 8 on the Richter
scale.

<HEAD>Rescuer Says Prognosis Bad For Stranded Whale</HEAD>

   Marine mammal rescuers tried to feed a young
brydes whale Saturday but it was in critical condition a day after
being rescued from a sandbar.
   A biologist at Sea World, where the 4,200-pound female whale was
taken late Friday, said the whale might have become separated from
its mother and then blown farther away by Tropical Storm Keith,
which swept through the Gulf of Mexico early last week. Brydes
whales are native to offshore tropical water.
   Dr. Dan Odell, also the scientific coordinator for the Southeast
U.S. Marine Mammal Stranding Network, gave a dim prognosis for the
whale's survival, but said the 22-foot, 9-inch mammal was resting
and started making sounds.
   ``That's about as good as you can expect from a beached whale at
this point,'' said Odell. ``It's been in a very stressful set of
circumstances probably for some days.''
   Squid were placed in the whale's mouth every three or four hours,
but the whale did not respond well to the food. Odell said they
hoped to ``get it feeding on whole food like that, rather than
resorting to a stomach tube.''
   The whale was rescued Friday night after it beached itself in the
Intercoastal Waterway near Honeymoon Island in the Gulf of Mexico.
Scientists loaded it onto a stretcher between two boats, then drove
it by truck to the marine animal park.
   The whale was estimated to be between 1 and 2 years old.
   Brydes whales, not an endangered species, grow to 40 feet in
length.
   They are a species of baleen whale, which have no teeth but use a
series of flexible fibrous plates that act as sieves to feed on a
wide range of sea life from plankton to shrimp and squid.

<HEAD>REA Orders State To Give Up Wabash Valley Rate-Setting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>INDIANAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Rural Electrification
Administration says it is taking control of rates charged by an
Indiana power association to pay back a loan, but state officials
say the federal agency can't do that.
   REA officials said it is the first time the agency has tried to
take over rate-setting powers by a utility that owes it money.
   The REA contends the Wabash Valley Power Association, which filed
for bankruptcy reorganization in 1985, owes it nearly $900 million,
mostly in interest and original debt it borrowed to invest in the
Marble Hill nuclear power plant.
   Marble Hill was abandoned and never finished. An attempt by
Wabash Valley to recover the Marble Hill loan through increased
rates was denied in 1987 by the state Utility Regulatory Commission.
Regulators said state law bars raising rates to pay for a power
plant never placed in service.
   Wabash Valley, which serves 24 member rural electric distribution
cooperatives with 400,000 customers in northern Indiana, is involved
in negotiations with Public Service Indiana, which it sued to
recover nearly $500 million invested in Marble Hill.
   The rate takeover was announced in letters mailed from Jack Van
Mark, the REA's acting administrator, to Edward P. Martin, Wabash
Valley's general manager, and to the Indiana Utility Regulatory
Commission, the Indianapolis Star reported Saturday.
   Van Mark proposed a 6 percent annual increase for retail
customers over three years and a 9 percent annual increase for the
same period for the rural cooperatives served by Wabash.
   ``We believe that Wabash is capable of repaying its debt, and
calculate that the required rate increases are the minimum
necessary,'' he said in the letter.
   But Leslie Duvall, chairman of the Indiana Utility Regulatory
Commission, said he does not believe a federal agency head has the
authority to supercede a state commission.
   ``The commission position for many years has been that the IURC
is the only legal entity for setting retail rates of the utilities
under our jurisdiction. I am very confident that position will not
be changed because we absolutely are convinced it is correct,''
Duvall said.
   REA officials said the action is necessary because the state
commission did not approve rates high enough for Wabash Valley to
repay its debt.
   The REA will file a debt restructuring proposal for Wabash Valley
and an elaboration of a rate takeover plan with federal bankruptcy
court in Indianapolis on Tuesday.
   ``We are going to continue talking and looking for some sort of
agreement,'' said Ruth Ann Mason, spokeswoman for the REA. ``But the
bottom line is that the federal government is entitled to the money
it loaned.''
   ``It's unfortunate the plant didn't get built, but somebody has
to pay for it (the debt),'' said Mason. ``The federal government
already has enough of a deficit.''
   In his letter, Van Mark expressed concern that taxpayers and the
other rural electric cooperatives who borrow from the REA Revolving
Fund will bear the burden of the Wabash obligation.
   ``We cannot allow federal interests to be so seriously
compromised,'' he wrote.
   Van Mark said higher rates should go into effect as soon as
bankruptcy proceedings are completed or a reorganization plan is
confirmed by the bankruptcy court.
   John W. Samples, Wabash Valley spokesman, said the cooperative is
aware the letter has been sent but he would not comment until it is
received.
   Wabash Valley buys electricity from power generating companies
and resells it to the rural cooperatives.

   Israeli troops shot to death a 16-year-old Arab,
and a soldier was slightly wounded Saturday when a Palestinian
hurled a homemade bomb at an Israeli army patrol in the occupied
West Bank, the military command said.
   Palestinian witnesses said 100 to 150 Palestinians were detained
after the bomb attack in Ramallah, 10 miles north of Jerusalem.
   Clashes between stone-throwing Palestinians and soldiers occurred
Saturday in the occupied Gaza Strip, where Palestinians staged a
partial commercial strike. Arab doctors said nine Palestinians were
wounded.
   Seven Palestinian teen-agers were shot in their legs or arms at
the Nuseirat refugee camp and the village of Zawaydah, said
officials at Gaza's Ahli Arab and Shifa hospitals.
   Farid Rajab Ilmaghari, the 16-year-old wounded in the head in
Nuseirat, died in Israel's Tel Hashomer Hospital, the army and Arab
reports said.
   Doctors at Ahli and Shifa hospitals said they treated two other
Palestinians for wounds in their limbs.
   The army confirmed two wounded and said it was checking reports
of other casualties. It said a curfew was imposed on Shajaiya
quarter in Gaza City following clashes there.
   An Arab reporter said Palestinians also confronted troops at an
open-air market in Rafah. He said soldiers fired tear gas and rubber
bullets and that seven girls and women aged 15 to 25 suffered slight
rubber bullet injuries.
   In Ramallah, troops opened fire at the assailant after the bomb
attack but missed. Soldiers closed the area and conducted searches,
arresting several suspects, the army said.
   Palestinian witnesses in Ramallah told The Associated Press the
bomb was thrown at an army jeep close to several other military cars
parked at the city's central Manara Square. The residents said
troops fired about 50 rounds of ammunition, mostly in the air.
   Dozens of soldiers sealed off the area and detained 100-150
Palestinians, making them sit on the ground near the site of the
attack, they said.
   At least 316 Palestinians have been killed and more than 7,000
wounded since an uprising against 21-year Israeli occupation of the
West Bank and Gaza Strip began on Dec. 8, 1987. Eleven Israelis have
been slain.

   George Bush went fishing Saturday,
but he had no more luck hooking trout than reporters had in getting
him to bite on questions about upcoming Cabinet appointments.
   ``Hey, look, you guys, you're scaring the fish away. There aren't
any here anyway. The more you talk, the further away they go,'' Bush
said as he fished for in the nearby Kennebunk River.
   However, Bush told reporters he would turn his attention to
defense appointments and defense policy next week in Washington.
   Bush will also meet on Monday with Senate Republican Leader Bob
Dole, according to aide Stephen Hart.
   Bush and his onetime rival for the Republican presidential
nomination had wanted to meet for some time, Hart said.
   ``It's of mutual interest,'' he added.
   Hart said Bush has yet to make a decision on either defense
policy or on naming a secretary of defense.
   Commenting on a story in Saturday's editions of the Washington
Post that Bush would consider a wide array of possible defense cuts
next week, Hart said:
   ``During the transition process, the vice president is welcoming
discussion on a wide variety on policy considerations and on people.
   ``Simply because options are being given to him and being
discussed and raised, doesn't mean they're going to be accepted.''
   The story also said former Armed Services Chairman John Tower of
Texas remains the front-runner for the job, and that Bush had
decided to keep on CIA Director William Webster, at least for the
time being.
   Bush worked for several hours in the small cottage he uses as an
office on the grounds of his family compound here, then went fishing
with two old friends.
   Asked by reporters what he was fishing for, Bush said, ``basic
brown trout.'' However, he added, ``We usually catch nothing right
here, nothing at all.''
   Why then, he was asked, was he fishing?
   ``Because I like casting,'' the vice president replied.
   Asked if he had thought about his defense team, Bush said: ``I'm
thinking mainly about fishing. Haven't gotten into the defense team
up here. Will as soon as we get back, though.'' Asked specifically
about whether he will name former Sen. John Tower to the post, Bush
said, ``hey gang, c'mon,'' then warned about scaring away the fish.
   Bush fished for about half an hour.
   Hart, meanwhile, told reporters that Robert Teeter, co-director
of Bush's transition team, would not announce his decision until
after Dec. 1 on whether he will accept an offer to be deputy White
House chief of staff.
   The offer was disclosed by New Hampshire Gov. John Sununu, who
will be Bush's staff chief.
   Hart said that Bush has no plans to meet with either Teeter or
Sununu during his vacation here; nor had he spoken to Tower.

   Iran, Turkey and Pakistan have announced a
plan to launch a satellite to boost communications between the three
countries, Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency reported
Saturday.
   The satellite will be launched under the auspices of the Economic
Cooperation Organization, formed by the three countries in 1964 to
coordinate joint economic activities, said IRNA.
   The news agency, monitored in Nicosia, provided no further
details on the project.
   The plan was announced during a meeting in the Iranian capital,
Tehran, between Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati, members
of the organization's secretariat in Tehran and the ambassadors of
Pakistan and Turkey.
   IRNA said the organization also is studying expansion and
improvement of roads, railroads and ports in the three countries and
is examining plans for a joint shipping line and a joint bank.

   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's easing of the
tight reins that have kept the 15 republics under Moscow's strict
control for decades has released long pent-up ethnic anger from the
Baltics to the Caucasus.
   The central government's new tolerance has resulted in
demonstrations, strikes and political moves unheard of before
Gorbachev came to power in 1985.
   In a period of less than two weeks, ethnic tensions have broken
out in the country's southern and western fringes.
   The Baltic republic of Estonia on Nov. 16 issued a ``declaration
of sovereignty'' from the central government in all areas but
defense and foreign policy. It also approved an amendment to the
republic's constitution requiring Estonian approval of all new
Soviet laws.
   Officials in the Baltic republics of Latvia and Lithuania blunted
similar moves. But the latter declared Lithuanian its official
language and restored the flag of the state that was independent
before World War II.
   In the southern republic of Azerbaijan, ethnic fighting broke out
between Moslem Azerbaijanis and Christian Armenians, who dominate
the Nagorno-Karabakh region and want it to be annexed to neighboring
Armenia.
   The ethnic tensions have culminated in massive demonstrations and
strikes that first began in February. Last week, in the largest
outbreak of violence in Azerbaijan since early spring, at least six
people were killed and more than 100 injured.
   Following the Kremlin's rejection in July of the Armenians'
demands, many activists said they had lost faith in Gorbachev.
   In the adjacent republic of Georgia, thousands of protesters
proposed changes that would strengthen the authority of the
republics.
   Such widespread assertion of local demands would have been
inconceivable before Gorbachev's policy of ``glasnost,'' or
openness, encouraged people to express themselves more freely.
   Gorbachev has praised citizens' increased interest in politics as
a sign that his reforms are taking hold.
   ``What's happening in Estonia is perestroika,'' or restructuring,
Gorbachev told reporters during his visit to India earlier this
month.
   On Saturday, the Soviet Union's highest executive body convened,
calling Estonia's effort to declare greater autonomy from Moscow
unconstitutional and invalid, official media said.
   But President Mikhail S. Gorbachev acknowledged before the
Presidium of the Supreme Soviet that national constitutional
amendments that he proposed may have angered Estonians and others by
reducing local rule.
   The Soviet leader's call for reforms has stirred ethnic feelings
submerged for years _ but the new voice of local activists has also
created new problems for the Kremlin.
   The proposed consitutional amendments would strengthen the
central government by establishing a Council of People's Deputies,
which would elect a legislature and a president with enhanced powers.
   Baltic activists, who are seeking greater cultural, political and
economic autonomy under the banner of Gorbachev's reforms, are
angered by the proposed amendments. They say the changes would take
away some of the local powers of the republics.
   In the Baltics, ``national self-consciousness is the essence of
our restructuring, relating to our language, culture and, of course,
our own government,'' said Algirdas Kaushidas, a member of the
governing board of the Lithuanian Movement for Perestroika.
   ``The Baltics are Gorbachev's biggest stronghold. We're the
biggest army he has,'' Kaushidas said in an interview from Vilnius.
   But V.N. Kudryatsev, head of the Soviet Academy of Sciences'
Institute of State and Law, said in an interview published Friday by
Tass that people were getting carried away.
   ``Here's a paradox: people, ruled by the best of intentions,
wishing to democraticize our society propose, it seems to them, a
more perfect system,'' he said. ``I don't see the logic. It seems to
me that most of all emotion and haste are acting here.''
   There seems to be little or no fear of Moscow in many of the
republican capitals. ``If all the small peoples join together, we
can win,'' an Estonian who traveled to the Armenian capital of
Yerevan recently told a crowd there.
   Under current law, republics have the theoretical right to secede
from the Soviet Union, but Moscow's control has been so strong that
such a move was inconceivable. The proposed amendments, aimed at
controlling the republics' demands for more autonomy, would
eliminate the right to secede.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here is the text of the State Department
statement on the rejection of an application for a visa to visit the
United States from PLO leader Yasser Arafat:
   The 1947 United Nations Headquarters Agreement obligates the
United States to provide certain rights of entry, transit and
residence to persons invited to the United Nations headquarters
district in New York City.
   The Congress of the United States conditioned the entry of the
U.S. into the U.N. Headquarters Agreement on the retention by the
U.S. government of the authority to bar the entry of aliens
associated with or invited by the United Nations ``in order to
safeguard its own security.''
   In this regard, U.S. law excludes members of the PLO from entry
into the United States by virtue of their affiliation in an
organization which engages in terrorism. The secretary of state is
vested by law with the discretion to recommend to the attorney
general that the prohibition against a particular PLO member be
waived.
   The United Nations General Assembly in l974 invited the Palestine
Liberation Organization to participate as an observer at the General
Assembly. The United Stats acknowledged that this UN invitation
obligates the U.S. to accord PLO observers entry, transit, and
residence; therefore, visa waivers have been issued to such
individuals as a routine practice. As a result, a PLO Observer
Mission has been in operation at the U.N. since l975. The PLO,
therefore, has had, and continues to have, ample opportunity to make
its positions known to the membership of the United Nations.
   On November 24, l988, we received an application from Mr. Yasser
Arafat, chairman of the PLO, for a visa to attend the United Nations
General Assembly session in New York City as an invitee. The
secretary of state has decided not to recommend a waiver of
ineligibility in this case; the visa application, therefore, is not
approved.
   The U.S. government has convincing evidence that PLO elements
have engaged in terrorism against Americans and others. This
evidence includes a series of operations undertaken by the Force 17
and the Hawari organizations since the PLO claimed to forswear the
use of terrorism in the Cairo Declaration of November, l985.
   As chairman of the PLO, Mr. Arafat is responsible for actions of
these organizations which are units of Fatah, an element of the PLO
of which he also is chairman and which is under his control. The
most recent sign of Mr. Arafat's associations with terrorism was the
presence at the Algiers session of the Palestine National Council
(PNC) this month of Abu Abbas, a member of the executive committee
of the PLO who has been convicted by the Italian judicial system of
the murder of an American citizen, Mr. Leon Klinghoffer.
   In summary, we find that:
   _ The PLO through certain of its elements has employed terrorism
against Americans.
   _ Mr. Arafat, as chairman of the PLO, knows of, condones, and
lends support to such acts; he, therefore, is an accessory to such
terrorism.
   _ Terrorism and those involved in it are a serious threat to our
national security and to the lives of American citizens.
   _ The Headquarters Agreement, contained in Public Law 80-357,
reserves to us the right to bar the entry of those who represent a
threat to our security.
   The United States firmly believes that Palestinian political
rights must be recognized and addressed. A comprehensive settlement
of the Arab-Israeli conflict is achievable through the peace process
that already has brought significant progress.
   Palestinian participation is required at every stage of the
negotiations required to achieve peace, justice and security.
Participation requires responsibilities, however. All parties must
demonstrate their desire to make peace; they must adhere to
internationally accepted principles and norms. No participant in a
peace process can wave the flag of justice in one hand and brandish
the weapon of terrorism in the other. All participants must
renounced violence and terrorism.
   The outcome of the PNC session in Algiers produced signs that
there are Palestinians who are trying to move the PLO in a
constructive way. That is encouraging and should continue. It is
unfortunate that the blight of terrorism still afflicts the
Palestinian cause and leaves no alternative to decisions such as the
secretary has taken today.

<HEAD>Congress Of Ruling Party To Consider Major Reforms</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFFREY ULBRICH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Chadli Bendjedid's moves to
loosen his ruling party's grip on the country and avoid further
unrest face opposition in the army and political elite as the party
congress begins Sunday.
   The 5,000 delegates to the sixth National Liberation Front
congress, in addition to considering reform, will choose a
secretary-general during the two-day meeting.
   Bendjedid proposed reform after rising prices, unemployment and
food shortages sparked riots in October that by official count
killed 176 people. Unofficial reports put the figure at up to 500.
   The president wants to revamp the party by bringing in new and
younger faces, a party source said. He wants to get a solid majority
behind his new premier, Kasdi Merbah, and begin revitalizing the
economy.
   Algeria faces a $23 billion foreign debt, a 22 percent
unemployment rate and shrinking oil revenues due to a world oil glut.
   But Bendjedid is faced with opposition from an old guard
comfortable with the monopoly of power built up over the 26 years
since independence from France.
   The source, a party Central Committee member close to Bendjedid,
said the president will have to slow down proposed reforms to win
agreement to the changes. The sources spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   A move toward a multiparty democracy, discussed a month ago,
seems on a back burner. The political program says the front ``does
not exclude that political action developed at grassroots level
could lead eventually to political pluralism.''
   But the Central Committee source, and many other observers, agree
that a multiparty system is not coming in the near future.
   According to the constitution, the secretary-general, now
Bendjedid, becomes the sole candidate in the presidential elections.
The elections are scheduled for February.
   Bendjedid has not announced whether he will seek a third
five-year term, but he is widely expected to.
   Bendjedid's speech Oct. 10 promising the reforms has led to
heightened expectations among many Algerians and the question most
asked by political observers is whether the president will deliver
enough change fast enough to avert new riots.
   The exact form the changes will take is not clear. The reform
program, as published in the official press, is more of a
philosophical statement than a concrete plan of action.
   The National Liberation Front began as a military organization
leading the revolution that began Nov. 1, 1954 and emerged as a
party in the late 1970s.
   Bendjedid, a military man, tried to minimize the role of the army
and has been trying since 1985 to overcome resistance to
liberalization.
   Since the riots, the president has appointed Merbah and a new
government of technocrats, removed the No. 2 man in the party and
made changes in the top army command.
   On Nov. 3, voters approved a referendum that changed 14 articles
of the constitution. One measure granted wider powers to the premier
and making him directly responsible to the National Assembly.

   A load of ammunition slated to be

soldiers and one civilian in a southeastern town, officials said.
   Army Lt. Col. Jorge Jesus Ezcurra, commander of the 602nd arsenal
batallion, said in a statement that the explosion occurred near the
town of Pigue, 450 kilometers southeast of Buenos Aires.
   The cause of the accident was unclear, but the Army indicated the
explosion occurred in a truck that was being used to transport the
munitions.
   Pieces of shrapnel and munitions casings were scattered over a
wide area and guards were posted to prevent further accidents, the
Army said.
   The batallion, in charge of the ammunition dump, stored
explosives that were to be dismantled.
   The dead included a first lieutenant, three corporals and an Army
civilian employee.

   Communist Party leader Milos Jakes
said the 70,000 Soviet troops in Czechoslovakia could be withdrawn
if East and West agree to cut forces on both sides, the party daily
Rude Pravo reported Saturday.
   Jakes said his country is interested in ``taking concrete steps
to limit conventional weaponry and military troops'' between the
NATO and Warsaw Pact, but he failed to elaborate on what measures he
had in mind, the newspaper quoted him as saying.
   ``While preserving military balance on a much lower level it
would be possible, according to our opinion, to solve the question
of Soviet troops' presence in Czechoslovakia,'' Jakes said, without
elaborating.
   A senior Hungarian official said in September that some of the
65,000 Soviet troops in Hungary could be pulled back under an
East-West agreement, but said it was likely the Hungarians would
continue to need Soviet air defense.
   Thirty-five nations who signed the 1975 Helsinki Act, including
the United States, Canada, the Soviet Union and all European nations
except Albania, are meeting in Vienna and expect to endorse a
mandate for new talks on conventional force reduction in Europe.

<TEXT>
   Lawmakers of 33 countries from East and
West began a conference Saturday, with some Western leaders
endorsing free trade unions and objecting to one-party rule, the
official PAP news agency reported.
   Organizers say the three-day meeting of about 150 leaders from
Europe, Canada and the United States is the first to assemble
parliament leaders from both the East and West blocs.
   ``Freedom is our right and it is our obligation, when need be, to
criticize others. But this does not mean interference in the
internal affairs of others,'' PAP quoted Netherlands parliamentary
leader Dirk Dolman as saying.
   ``There is one law of East European states to which Western
Europe objects principally: That is the special role, laid down in
the constitution, of one party _ the Communist Party,'' he said.
   Swedish Parliament Speaker Thage Peterson told the conference:
``One important factor in the democratic process is an open dialogue
with free and independent trade union organizations,'' PAP reported.
   It appeared to be a reference to Polish authorities' ban on
Solidarity, the East bloc's first independent trade union outlawed
after Poland's 1981 martial-law crackdown.
   Gudrun Helgadottir, president of Iceland's Parliament, called for
breaking down the divisions in Europe, including dismantling
military alliances.
   Roman Malinowski, Polish Parliament speaker, said he hopes the
conference ``will become the beginning of a new practice of
cooperation between parliaments of the East and West.''

   The government has signed an agreement
with Costa Rica to set up border patrols and to return several
hundred refugees to Nicaragua, officials announced.
   According to an official statement, the agreement commits both
governments to patrol the border in order to ``guarantee frontier
normality, prevent unlawful acts such as smuggling and cattle
rustling ... and fight drug trafficking.''
   The accords were signed Thursday in the Nicaraguan port of San
Juan del Sur, officials said in Managua Friday.
   Costa Rican and Nicaraguan troops will patrol separately, said
Hernan Garron, Costa Rica's minister of public security.
   Tomas Borge, Nicaragua's interior minister, said Costa Rica
``reaffirmed its neutrality with all that that implies.''
   Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government has frequently accused
Costa Rica of harboring anti-Sandinista guerrillas, known as Contras.
   The U.S.-backed rebels have been fighting the leftist government
for seven years. A temporary cease-fire remains in effect, but each
side accuses the other of violating it and progress on a permanent
truce has been stalled.
   Radio Liberation, a clandestine radio station operated by
anti-Sandinista guerrillas, denounced the border agreement on
Friday, calling it a ``crime against the people of Nicaragua.''
   Costa Rican patrols will try to locate Radio Liberation's
broadcast facilities, which Nicaragua says are in Costa Rica,
according to Costa Rican police minister Antonio Alvarez.
   Several hundred refugees who fled Nicaragua after Hurricane Joan
hit last month will be repatriated under the agreement, officials
said.

   Pope John Paul II plans to visit
communist East Germany in 1991, a West German newspaper said
Saturday.
   There was no official confirmation from the Vatican on the report
in the paper Welt am Sonntag.
   The conservative newspaper, quoting unidentified Roman Catholic
Church officials in the East German city of Dresden, said the pope
is to visit the East bloc country for the first time in May 1991.
   Details of the pope's visit were worked out by Berlin Cardinal
Joachim Meisner and East German Secretary of State Kurt Loeffler,
who is responsible for church affairs.
   The focal point of the trip would be the beatification of
Bernhard Lichtenberg, a Roman Catholic priest who died in November
1943 while being transported to the Nazi death camp of Dachau, now
in southern West Germany, Welt am Sonntag said.
   Lichtenberg was arrested in 1941 because of his open opposition
to the Nazi persecution of Jews.

   Nearly 4 billion feet of baling twine _ enough
to encircle Earth more than 95 times and worth as much as $6 million
_ was ruined after the ship transporting it took on water during a
North Atlantic storm.
   The 12,000 tons of sisal twine was bound for Duluth and then to
upper Midwest farmers to tie bales of hay, an executive said. It was
aboard a Greek-owned ship carrying the load from Brazil when the
storm struck Thursday.
   ``It's a tremendous loss to us,'' said Joseph Urista, director
and part owner of United Rope Distributors of Minneapolis. The
company is a subsidiary of Sisalana Inc., a Brazilian company that
makes twine from sisal, a tropical fiber.
   Urista said the twine was valued at $5 million to $6 million. It
was insured, but he said his company will have to buy replacement
twine from competitors and increase its own production in order to
meet the Midwestern farm demand.
   The 316,000 bales of twine could have tied 79 million small bales
of hay and well over 11 million large ones, he said.
   The ship's 27 Filipino crewmen and East Indian officers were
rescued by a Canadian Coast Guard helicopter about 400 miles south
of Sable Island, an island off Nova Scotia. None was injured.
   The rescue took place in 25- to 35-knot winds and 22-foot seas as
the remains of Tropical Storm Keith approached the area.

   Forms asking for information on suspected
drug activity have been included in bills mailed to the city's water
customers to give people a chance to snitch in private about
possible criminal activity.
   ``There's a number of people in the community who are fearful for
their own safety _ whether real or imagined _ and this provides a
way ... we can look at it,'' Police Chief Darrell Pepper said.
   The forms state that they are not official complaints and ask for
as many details as possible. They also carry this message: ``Your
help is very important, but do not take unnecessary risks or actions
on your own.''
   The forms have spaces for license numbers of suspicious cars,
locations of suspicious activity, and ask questions that include:
``Have you seen apparent drug transactions or drug paraphernalia at
or near the vicinity of the residence? (Exchange of money or goods
for small packages.)
   ``Do you know what kind of drugs are being sold? How do you
know?''
   Pepper said returned forms come directly to him. He destroys any
that seem inappropriate or vindictive.
   ``We're only interested in things that are of a criminal
nature,'' Pepper said.
   So far, about a half dozen forms have been returned. None has
contained information about suspected criminal activity the police
didn't already know about, Pepper said.
   Some people have written notes on the forms comparing the mailing
to the Nazis asking people to spy on their neighbors, Pepper said.
   ``I guess where I'm at is that we're providing the citizenry an
opportunity to inform us of any of their suspected problems,'' he
said. He said other cities have done similar mailings.
   The police prepared similar report forms more than a year ago and
have distributed them at several community meetings.

   A pillow salesman wants to help singer John
Denver pay for a trip into outer space. But Lyle George has only a
one-way ticket in mind.
   George said his goal is to raise $5 million, or half the $10
million Denver has said he would need to spend one week aboard the
Soviet space station Mir.
   Denver, who approached the Soviets about a space trip, has said
it would be inappropriate for him personally to pay the Soviet space
program. The singer said he hoped individual and corporate
sponsorships will enable him to go into space by December 1989.
   George decided to respond by opening the fund at State National
Bank in Wayne, which is 90 miles northwest of Omaha. He donated $10
and said he's received some pledges.
   ``I thought it was kind of bizarre when he wanted people to chip
in,'' George said. ``But I decided I'd be willing to chip in if I
could be guaranteed that none of the money would be spent to bring
him back.''
   George said he's not worried about how Denver would return to
Earth.
   ``If he finds a way back, more power to him,'' said George,
adding that he once was a John Denver fan.
   ``My first album was a John Denver album ...,'' George said.
``The first song I listened to on the radio that I remember was
`Rocky Mountain High.' But I feel John Denver has drifted off of
that since then.''

<HEAD>Severe Weather Over The Mississippi Valley</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   An area of low pressure and a cold front trailing southward
produced severe weather with tornadoes Saturday over the lower
Mississippi Valley and snow in the upper Mississippi Valley.
   A line of thunderstorms moved from eastern Texas into western
Mississippi during the morning and early afternoon.
   A tornado destroyed at least four houses and damaged an estimated
25 others at Ruleville, Miss., but no serious injuries were
reported, officials said. The twister, reported to be about 100
yards wide, also caused extensive damage to the high school, the
junior high and a service station in the town of about 3,500.
   Another tornado was spawned by a thunderstorm near Mound, La.,
the National Weather Service said.
   Strong thunderstorm wind damaged a church and a store at
Carthage, Texas, the weather service said. Hail as big as golf balls
fell near Fruitvale and Mexia, Texas.
   Rain from the thunderstorms was heavy over the lower Mississippi
Valley and fell on already soaked ground in Arkansas and Louisiana.
Overnight totals included 6.11 inches at Hope, Ark.; 4.94 inches at
Fulta, Ark.; 3.55 inches at Nashville, Ark.; and 3.13 inches at
Plain Dealing, La.
   In the six hours up to 1 p.m. EST, 2.41 inches of rain fell at
Barksdale Air Force Base at Shreveport, La.; 1.95 inches fell at
Pine Bluff, Ark.; and 1.81 inches fell at Memphis, Tenn.
   Nearly 3 inches fell in western Tennessee and a flash flood
warning was posted.
   Throughout eastern Texas, rivers were reported at or near flood
stage and many towns reported losing power for several hours.
   Snow fell in the upper Mississippi Valley and eastern parts of
the northern Plains where cold, moist air blew counterclockwise
around the low pressure area.
   Two to 5 inches of snow fell in southwestern Minnesota during the
morning, before the snow moved north. By midday, 6 inches of snow
had fallen at Brainerd and Cross Lake, with 2 to 3 inches at
Minneapolis-St.Paul.
   Two to 5 inches of snow fell in southeastern South Dakota and the
snow was expected to move into southeastern North Dakota. Two to 4
inches of snow fell in northwestern Wisconsin.
   Light snow also fell as far south as the Texas Panhandle.
   In the West, snow showers were scattered over mountainous areas
of the central and northern so-called Intermountain region between
the Rockies and the Sierra Nevada.
   Parts of Utah got heavy snow overnight. The Alta ski area
reported 30 inches of snow from Friday afternoon to Saturday
morning. The Spruces area in Big Cottonwood Canyon reported 18
inches of snow and the Brighton area had 13 inches.
   Temperatures were freezing in the northern and central Rockies,
the northern Plains, northern Minnesota and western Nebraska and
Kansas.
   But Brownsville, Texas, reported a record high of 93 degrees, and
Portland, Maine, tied its record of 58.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 7
degrees at Cut Bank, Mont., to 92 at Brownsville. Saturday morning's
low was 6 degrees below zero at West Yellowstone, Mont.
   For Sunday, showers and thunderstorms were forecast from the
central and eastern Gulf Coast across the Tennessee and middle
Mississippi valleys, the Ohio Valley and the Appalachians to the
Great Lakes and western New England. Snow was forecast over the
upper Mississippi Valley, western parts of the upper Great Lakes,
and eastern sections of the northern Plains. Widespread rain was
forecast across the Pacific Northwest, with snow at higher
elevations.
   Highs only in the teens and 20s were predicted over the northern
Rockies, northern Plains, Nebraska and much of the upper Mississippi
Valley; in the 30s and 40s from the Pacific Northwest across the
central and southern Rockies, Oklahoma, Kansas and much of the
middle Mississippi Valley to the upper Great Lakes; in the 40s over
northern Maine; in the 70s over southern California and parts of the
desert Southwest; in the 70s and 80s from south-central Texas across
the Gulf Coast and Florida to eastern parts of the middle and
southern Atlantic Coast states; and in the 50s and 60s over much of
the remainder of the nation.

   The Canadian earthquake felt over a wide area of
the northeastern United States should get people to pay more
attention to making essential buildings in the region
earthquake-proof, a geologist said Saturday.
   ``Earthquakes in New England are relatively infrequent but they
do occur,'' said Dr. John Ebel, a seismologist at the Weston
Observatory at Boston College in Newton. ``With that in mind, we
need to be sure that critical facilities are made to stand up to
earthquakes.
   Ebel said Massachusetts is one of the few states in New England
that have a seismic provision required in the construction of major
structures like tall buildings and hospitals. New York state
recently required that some structures meet earthquake codes, Ebel
said.
   Nuclear power plants in the region are constructed to withstand
earthquakes, Ebel said.
   Friday's quake, centered 95 miles north of Quebec City,
registered 6.0 on the Richter scale, according to U.S. and Canadian
seismic monitors.
   Less than 12 hours later, two aftershocks had been recorded and
more were expected, although no damage was reported, state officials
said Saturday.
   Geophysicist Dick Holt at the Weston Geophysical Laboratory said
aftershocks could register up to 5.0 on the Richter scale.
   The main tremor was felt in the northeastern United States from
Michigan to Washington, D.C.
   ``One lady called us and said she had whitecaps in her fish tank
and her chandelier was shaking,'' said Pennsylvania state police
Cpl. Clifford Williams, near Erie, Pa.
   There was no structural damage reported, although authorities
were told of broken windows in Maine, shelves and dishes falling in
Rhode Island, and several intravenous bottles knocked over and
broken at a Wilkes-Barre, Pa., hospital.
   Police in some areas were swamped with calls while other people
never felt a thing. In Ohio, as an example, police in Columbus,
about in the center of the state, said several people called to
report feeling the tremor, but officials in Youngstown, closer to
the quake epicenter, were not aware of the quake.
   People in Cleveland reported feeling buildings move. But a few
miles away, seismic monitoring equipment at the Perry nuclear power
plant did not detect the quake, said Todd Schneider, a spokesman for
Cleveland Electric Illuminating Co.
   In New York City, firefighters were sent to 40 separate locations
in Manhattan where tremors were reported but no damage was found,
said fire Lt. Kenneth Murphy. People in other buildings on the
granite island didn't notice the quake.
   In Massachusetts, several people felt the tremor Friday night.
   ``We ran out of our house. Our lampshade was shaking. We were
shaking,'' said Carol Dalessandro, 40, of Wakefield.
   At the Top of the Hub restaurant on the 52nd floor of the
Prudential Center in Boston, about 120 people were dining when the
earthquake struck.
   ``It was enough to make you feel queasy,'' said maitre d' Stephen
Brown. ``The entire dining room felt it. Everyone felt they were
becoming dizzy or faint. They all sort of smiled and looked at each
other. No one felt panicked or anything.''
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude. An earthquake measuring 5 on the Richter scale can
cause considerable damage, a 6 reading severe damage, and a 7 is a
major earthquake.
   The strongest earthquake in Canada this century was recorded off
the coast of British Columbia in 1949 and measured 8 on the Richter
scale.

   Eight people were arrested Saturday
during an anti-abortion protest outside a Planned Parenthood clinic
where hundreds of demonstrators heckled women arriving to have
abortions.
   Six men and two women were arrested on charges of disorderly
conduct during the early-morning confrontation, said Brookline
police Officer William Ellis.
   Police refused to identify those who were arrested but said they
were members of Operation Rescue, a national anti-abortion group
which has staged several protests in the Greater Boston area and
around the country in recent months.
   About 125 protesters blocked the sidewalk and stairs leading to
the clinic. Some of them clasped hands and sat down along the
sidewalk while others prayed loudly and carried signs depicting
aborted fetuses.
   ``I'm praying for the women who are going in for abortions,''
said anti-abortion activist Charlene Lister. ``They'll have the
guilt and the torment.''
   The anti-abortion activists were often drowned out by about 250
supporters of choice on abortion, who chanted slogans and carried
their own signs.
   Planned Parenthood spokeswoman Susan Newsom said the group heard
Friday that Operation Rescue was planning a protest and mobilized
the counterdemonstration by telephoning supporters.
   ``They think they have the answer for everyone but they don't,''
said Newsom. ``They're not persuading anyone. If anything, I think
they alienate mainstream anti-abortionists.''
   Newsom said Planned Parenthood told the women scheduled to have
abortions Saturday that they could reschedule appointments. But she
said all chose to come despite the protest.
   Planned Parenthood counselor Nancy Drooker said 12 women came for
abortions at the clinic Saturday.
   Anti-abortion activist Kenneth Berthiaume said he would continue
to attend demonstrations ``because we have to keep them from killing
babies. They kill more babies every year than they killed all the
men in World War II.''
   Recent Operation Rescue demonstrations stem from an abortion
protest in Atlanta that began when the Democratic National
Convention was held there in July and has resulted in more than
1,200 arrests over several weeks.

   Vandals on an interstate highway overpass
tossed a foot-square chunk of concrete into the windshield of a
pickup truck, killing a man, authorities said.
   Police said the death Friday was the first casualty to result
from more than two dozen similar rock-dropping incidents in the area
south of Chicago.
   There were no arrests and no suspects, police said.
   Charles Layfield, 57, of Chicago was sitting between the driver
and a sleeping passenger in the truck's cab when the concrete
slammed through the windshield and struck his head, killing him,
said state police Sgt. Tom Watson. The two other men were not
injured.
   The driver said he noticed two people leaning over the Interstate
57 overpass before the windshield shattered, Watson said.

   Nebraskans for Peace members say they hope
their newly published cookbook, ``Give Peas A Chance,'' will provide
food for thought, laughter as well as tasty dishes.
   Imagine a meal beginning with a cocktail, ``Tequila Communist.''
Then some ``Chile con carnage,'' ``Pentagon leeks,'' ``wild Donna
Rice,'' and ``quick and sleazy Nori-eggas.''
   The 186-page book, subtitled ``A Nuclear Family Cookbook,''
contains about 250 recipes and is arranged in sections. For example,
breakfast is called ``First strike'' and precedes a section called
``SAC lunches.''
   Robin Carter, co-director of Nebraskans for Peace for the 2nd
Congressional District, said the group decided to approach its
loathing of war and opposition to defense buildups through humor.
   ``They're real recipes. And they're great,'' Ms. Carter said.
``We also hope it will educate.''
   The book is peppered with statistics and quotations, such as the
number of bombs built during certain periods and Henry Ford's
statement: ``Show me who makes a profit from war, and I'll show you
how to stop war.''
   A newspaper ad touting the cookbook included an order coupon
under a picture of the late Soviet dictator Josef Stalin and the
words, ``9 Out of 10 Dictators Agree _ Don't Buy This Cookbook.''
   Ms. Carter said members had discussed a cookbook for a couple of
years.
   ``People started talking about recipes at one of our meetings,''
she said.
   About 20 Nebraskans for Peace volunteers submitted recipes, and
several staff members edited the book. It took six months to produce
and was assembled by General Publishing and Binding in Iowa Falls,
Iowa, she said.
   The 1,500-member group has sold 300 of the 500 cookbooks it
ordered, she said. The book sells for $7 plus shipping costs. The
group hopes to net about $2,000 and will use proceeds for
educational projects, Ms. Carter said.

   The Soviet Union's top executive body on Saturday
threw out Estonia's declaration of limited sovereignty, ruling that
the Baltic republic's bid to set its own course was a violation of
the constitution.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said the Estonian legislature's
attempt to take charge of all matters but defense and foreign policy
and to review all new Soviet laws was ``in deep contradiction with
the Constitution of the U.S.S.R. and must be rejected as mistaken,
not having any legal force.''
   Gorbachev's remarks, made to the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet,
were reported by the official Tass news agency. But a rare film
report of the session led the evening television news program
Vremya, indicating its importance to the Soviet leadership.
   The Kremlin's action, three days before the nation's parliament
votes on a controversial rewrite of the national constitution, dealt
a blow to recent efforts in Estonia, two other Baltic republics, and
other Soviet regions to loosen Moscow's grip on their affairs.
   But Gorbachev, who convened the Presidium, acknowledged that
national constitutional amendments that he has proposed have angered
Estonians and people in other republics by restricting rather than
expanding local autonomy.
   Meanwhile, in the capital cities of the two other Baltic
republics on Saturday, grassroots political organizations organized
protests against the proposed constitutional amendments.
   Tass reported that in Riga, Latvia, members of the People's Front
waved the red-and-white flag of the formerly independent Latvian
republic. They were protesting their legislature's failure Tuesday
to follow Estonia's path and challenge Moscow's authority.
   In Lithuania, where legislators also backed away from a direct
challenge to the Kremlin, protesters rallied to demand that the
national amendments be withdrawn, Tass said. It did not give details.
   The Vremya report on the Presidium's action said, ``In connection
with the non-correspondence with the Soviet Constitution of several
statements and declarations adopted by the Estonian Supreme Soviet
on Nov. 16, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the U.S.S.R.
declared them invalid.''
   A week ago, legislative commissions of the Supreme Soviet found
Estonia's constitutional amendment reserving the right to review
Soviet law at odds with the constitution and passed its
recommendation to the Supreme Soviet.
   A day after Estonia took its action, Tass reported it would be
considered by the Presidium and that Estonian officials would be
invited to attend the meeting.
   Tass said the Presidium heard a commission report as well as from
Estonian President Arnold Rutel.
   The Presidium ordered development of a system by which the Soviet
of Nationalities, one of two chambers of the national Supreme
Soviet, and a constitutional review committee would widen and
protect the rights of the 15 republics that make up the Soviet Union.
   Baltic activists pushing for greater autonomy under the banner of
Gorbachev's reforms say the constitutional amendments would take
away some of their power rather than grant greater local control.
   The Kremlin has expressed some willingness to compromise on the
issue.
   Gorbachev told the Presidium, ``As a result of democratic
discussion of these documents, we have today drafts of laws which
significantly differ from published and presented for discussion
earlier.''
   ``I believe that those changes improve these drafts, and what is
most significant they express the mood of the dominant majority of
the working people of the country,'' he said.
   ``They include many corrections and exclude some points which
caused anxiety and misunderstandings,'' he said.
   Earlier this week, a legislative panel recommended that the new
Council of People's Deputies to be created under the amendments not
be given power to throw out laws adopted by the republics.
   On Thursday, the ruling Communist Party Politburo noted
complaints that the bills could be ``substantially improved.''
   Radio Moscow said the Presidium received about 200,000 letters
about the project. It said most approved it but many offered
suggested improvements.
   ``As a result, many provisions have been improved,'' Radio Moscow
said.

   The Soviet Union defeated Denmark 3-1 in
the 12th round of the Chess Olympiad on Saturday to retain their
overwhelming three-point lead with only two rounds left.
   England scored a decisive 3-1 win over Hungary to take strong
hold of second place with 31 points.
   The United States, the Netherlands and Yugoslavia shared third
with 29.5 points.
   The Soviets have 34 points of a possible 48.
   In the separate women's championship, the Soviet Union maintained
its half-point lead over Hungary despite losing an important player
to international romance.
   The Soviets' second board, Elena Akhmilovskaya, eloped Saturday
morning with John Donaldson, the non-playing captain of the American
men's team. They left for the United States.
   The Soviets, forced to field their three remaining players, only
defeated Czechoslovakia 2.5-0.5. But the Hungarians also ceded a
draw in their 2.5-0.5 win over England. A win scores a point, and a
draw earns a half point.
   Although the Soviet men are brilliantly poised to win the gold
medals, they almost suffered a setback against Denmark when Curt
Hansen, a 23-year-old Danish grandmaster, appeared to gain a winning
position against world champion Garri Kasparov.
   ``At one stage, Hansen was totally winning with Kasparov in time
trouble too,'' said Danish International Master Bjarke Kristensen.
``But he went wrong, missed several (chances for) wins, and Kasparov
went on to draw.''
   England, the second seeds and 1986 silver medalists, made a
strong play for second place with impressive wins from Grandmasters
Jonathan Speelman and John Nunn.
   The United States, which has won the bronze medals in the last
three Olympiads, only drew 2-2 with the outranked Netherlands.
   U.S. players seemed tired after most rose early to escort their
eloping captain to the airport.
   Following his departure, the United States appointed a new
captain, Natasha Us, a 26-year-old chess expert from New York.
   The Philippines, seeded 29th but now in sixth place, continued
their remarkable run Saturday by going 1.5-0.5 ahead against China
with two games adjourned. Experts said the match would probably
finish 2.5-1.5 in favor of the Filipinos and push them into third
place.
   Organized by the 127-member World Chess Federation, the Olympiad
is a biennial world team championship featuring teams from 106
countries.
   The adjourned games and the 13th round are scheduled for Sunday.
The final round will be played Tuesday.

   A magician made toy guns disappear
here Saturday while activists demonstrated at a Rhode Island toy
factory in pre-Christmas protests against violent playthings.
   Jerry Rubin, director of the Los Angeles Alliance for Survival,
said the events were held for the fourth annual International Days
of Protest Against War Toys.
   At a child care center in Santa Monica, Rubin was joined by
magician Charles Peters, who turned Rambo and G.I. Joe dolls into
teddy bears, which he tossed to a small crowd.
   For his finale, Peters made realistic toy guns vanish and two
white doves appear in their place.
   ``I think people can participate in making their own magic this
holiday season and all year round. They can stop buying war toys and
make them disappear from store shelves,'' said Rubin, who has been
involved with Alliance for Survival for nine years and is not
related to the 1960's anti-war activist also named Jerry Rubin.
   In Pawtucket, R.I., a demonstration was held outside Hasbro Inc.,
which makes G.I. Joe, said protest spokeswoman Karen Nyer.
   ``Santa Claus was there telling the kids he wasn't giving out war
toys this year,'' Ms. Nyer said.
   ``We are trying to convince Hasbro to make toys which encourage
and teach cooperation and peace-making skills to our children,''
said Carol Hanley, of the Rhode Island Mobilization for Survival.
   In a radio address, California state Senate leader David Roberti
urged parents not to give violent toys to their children this
holiday season.
   A Roberti bill passed this year by the Legislature bans the
manufacture, sale and distribution of imitation firearms in
California after Dec. 31.
   ``Let's not turn our gifts of love into instruments of death,''
he said.

   Fasi was ``doing fine,'' in the intensive care unit at The

   Firefighters, police and animal-loving passers-by
rescued about 40 purebred kittens and puppies from a smoke-filled
pet store after an electrical fire on Saturday, authorities said.
   Six puppies and two cats died in the fire, which began in the
basement of the International Kennel Club on Manhattan's East Side
and sent smoke through a four-story building, said Sgt. Maurice
Howard, a police spokesman.
   Two people living above the store were treated at New York
Hospital for smoke inhalation and released, said firefighter John
Pitacco.
   The store was full of smoke when firefighters arrived and began
the hectic effort to rescue the animals from cages, Pitacco said.
   ``As the firefighters and officers got them out, they were
handing them over to the civilians,'' he said.
   Jason Flanders, 11, said he helped rescue two kittens.
   ``I was scared and I was kind of sad ... I was crying,'' he said.
``I'm glad everybody worked together.''
   Dr. Lawrence Zola of the nearby New York Veterinary Hospital said
one firefighter came in holding an oxygen mask over a kitten's
mouth, ``a pretty amazing sight.''
   Zola said the animals saved were all under 4 months old and
probably sold for $400 to $1,000. The puppies ranged from small
breeds such as Lhasa apsos and corgis to Old English sheepdogs; the
cats were various breeds.
   ``Most have done very well and begun to recover,'' he said. The
fact that the veterinary hospital was so close ``probably saved a
lot of them.''

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sitting in an Elizabethan chamber where William
Shakespeare's ``Twelfth Night'' was first performed, three British
judges on Saturday ruled unanimously that the Bard was truly the
author of the plays that bear his name.
   An audience of 350 crowded into Middle Temple Hall in London's
court district to watch lawyers and witnesses argue whether the wool
merchant's son from Stratford-upon-Avon or Edward de Vere, the 17th
Earl of Oxford, actually wrote Shakespeare's plays and poems.
   Lord Templeman, one of the judges, declared, ``It's ... said that
Shakespeare received very little education.
   ``Well, it is a proven fact that Abraham Lincoln didn't go to
school for more than a year, and no one suggests that the Gettysburg
Address was written by ... one of those ghostwriters who now haunt
the White House.''
   The tongue-in-cheek case was decided by Templeman and two other
members of the Law Lords, Britain's highest court. The seven-hour
hearing, with breaks for lunch and tea, was marked by scholarship
and bursts of humor.
   Novelist Jeffrey Archer, who planned the daylong hearing, opened
it with a quote from American actor and Shakespeare enthusiast Sam
Wanamaker _ ``I am fascinated by the authorship question, but the
play's the thing.''
   An estimated $36,000 in ticket sales from the hearing will help
fund Wanamaker's project to rebuild the Globe Theater, where
Shakespeare's plays were performed for London audiences, on its
original 16th-century site by the Thames River.
   With judges, witnesses and lawyers behaving as they would in a
real-life court of law, the hearing was being filmed for a possible
TV production.
   Charles Vere, 23-year-old descendant of the earl and an Oxford
University student, made the case for his ancestor after three U.S.
Supreme Court justices found the evidence wanting in a similar
hearing 14 months ago in Washington.
   The U.S. justices _ William J. Brennan Jr., Harry A. Blackmun and
John Paul Stevens _ expressed unease about the authorship of
Shakespeare's works, but ruled the evidence insufficient to ascribe
them to de Vere.
   ``It's important to get people to understand, people who are
prepared to take up the cudgels,'' said Vere, whose full name is
Charles Francis Topham de Vere Beauclerk. He was speaking in an
interview before the hearing.
   De Vere advocates are rehashing more than 200-year-old argument
that Shakespeare lacked the knowledge of foreign travel and court
life that features in the works.
   They say de Vere, a dandy and poet familiar with Elizabethan
court life, wrote the plays and poems but that conventions of the
day stopped him putting his name to them. They say he therefore used
the pseudonym Shakespeare or paid Shakespeare to be his ``front.''
   The judges ruled after hearing the arguments of witnesses and two
senior lawyers, Robert Alexander for de Vere and Sydney Kentridge
for Shakespeare.
   Kentridge, 66, who was born in Johannesburg, South Africa, is
better known for his work in such South African causes as the
inquest on black activist Steve Biko and the trial of the
Sharpeville Six.
   ``This whole thing is worthwhile because it makes people think
about Shakespeare,'' Kentridge said.
   Opinions wondered whether the proceedings were needed.
   ``In my view, people would be far better off reading his work,''
said Anne Barton, a Cambridge University English professor.

   A ship finally unloaded its toxic ash from
Philadelphia after wandering the world's seas for more than two
years in search of a place to dump its unwanted cargo, a port
official said Saturday.
   No one disclosed where the Pelicano, a 19-year-old freighter,
left the poisonous waste. The environmental group Greenpeace earlier
charged that it had been dropped somewhere in the Indian Ocean.
   The ship remained anchored Saturday in international waters off
Singapore, police here and in neighboring Malaysia said. It arrived
in the area earlier this week.
   A spokesman for the Port of Singapore Authority said on condition
of anonymity that the vessel had unloaded its cargo but would not be
allowed to enter port anyway. The Immigration Department says it
wants to change crews.
   Reporters who visited the ship Thursday confirmed that its four
holds looked empty.
   While many ships are involved in carrying poisonous wastes, the
epic voyage of the Pelicano has come to symbolize the problems of
toxic dumping, particularly in the Third World.
   The ship, formerly called the Khian Sea, left Philadelphia on
Aug. 31, 1986, with 14,000 tons of the city's municipal and
industrial incinerator ash. It was renamed the Felicia last July and
recast as the Pelicano last week, according to published reports and
shipping sources.
   At least 11 countries on four continents have spurned the toxic
waste. The boat initially wandered the Caribbean for 18 months,
reportedly leaving up to 4,500 tons of ash in Haiti before making an
unsuccessful attempt to enter Delaware Bay. Its later travels took
it across the Atlantic to West Africa, the Mediterranean, and the
Indian Ocean.
   It is said to have been registered in Liberia, Bahama and
Honduras at various times.
   A report by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said the
cargo contained aluminum, arsenic, chromium, copper, lead, mercury,
nickel, zinc and toxic dioxins contained in ash from a Philadelphia
city incinerator.
   Greenpeace spokeswoman Uta Bellion has said her group learned
from shipping sources that the vessel dropped its remaining ash into
the Indian Ocean. She gave no details.
   A man who identified himself as Capt. Arturo Fuentes denied that
the ash, which he said was non-toxic, was dumped at sea. He told
reporters who visited the ship Thursday that the Pelican unloaded it
in port but refused to say in what country.
   ``I do not know what they did with the ash,'' said Fuentes.
   Greenpeace estimates that at least 11 developing countries have
accepted waste from the United States and Europe since 1986. The EPA
says about 2.2 million tons of toxic garbage cross international
borders each year.

   The United States has rejected Palestine
Liberation Organization chairman Yasser Arafat's application for a
visa to visit the United States to address the United Nations, the
State Department announced Saturday.
   Secretary of State George Shultz revealed his decision in a
two-page statement issued to reporters.
   The PLO applied for a visa so Arafat could travel to New York to
address the U.N. General Assembly on Dec. 1 when it opens its debate
on the Palestine questions.
   Shultz said he could not recommend granting the visa to Arafat
because of the PLO's positions.
   ``The U.S. government has convincing evidence that PLO elements
have engaged in terrorism against Americans and others,'' the
statement said. Moreover, Arafat, as PLO chairman, ``knows of,
condones, and lends support to such acts,'' and is ``an accessory to
such terrorism.''
   Arafat, visiting Amman, Jordan on a Middle East tour, would have
no comment until after he read the text of the State Department's
statement, said Bassam Abu Sharif, a spokesman with the PLO leader.
   But Abu Sharif told reporters the United States had made ``a big
mistake by breaching the agreement ... between the United Nations as
an institution and the United States government.''
   In New York, Nasser al-Kidwa, the PLO's second top representative
to the U.N., called the decision ``another clear violation'' of the
1947 Host Country Headquarters Agreement to allow U.N. diplomats and
guests to come and go freely.
   He said he thinks virtually all U.N. member nations will support
the PLO position to hold a special session of the General Assembly
in another place such as Geneva or Vienna in order to give Arafat a
chance to address it.
   In Jerusalem, Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres praised the
U.S. decision, sending a telegram of ``appreciation'' to Shultz,
according to a spokesman for Peres.
   A spokeswoman for U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar
said he would not comment on Shultz' decision until after reading a
text of the State Department statement.
   When the PLO applied for the visa earlier this week, State
Department spokesman Charles Redman said the United States would
``severely scrutinize Arafat's application.''
   The U.S. government has been under intense domestic pressure from
Jewish leaders and others to deny a visa to Arafat. Jewish groups
praised the department's decision, but Arab-Americans condemned it.
   ``The whole civilized world was shocked when he wore a gun upon
last addressing the United Nations, and we see no reason to think
that he is any less supportive of terrorism or any less an enemy of
Israel than he was then,'' said Ira Silverman, executive vice
president of the American Jewish Committee.
   James Abourezk, chairman of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination
Committee, said it is ``embarrassing'' and ``shameful'' that Shultz
``would allow Israel to dictate whom the American people can or
cannot hear.''
   President-elect George Bush, asked about the visa while jogging
in Kennebunkport, Maine, said, ``No comment.''
   White House spokesman Ben Jarrett, in Santa Barbara, Calif.,
where President Reagan is vacationing, said Reagan was aware of the
State Department's decision, but ``had no role in it.''
   Shortly before Shultz announced his decision, Arafat said in
Kuwait that he would call for the U.N. debate on Palestinian issues
to be moved to Geneva if the United States rejected his visa to
visit New York.
   There was no immediate indication from U.N. officials on Arafat's
call to move the proceedings. Arafat, who is on a tour of the Arab
nations to gain support for an independent Palestinian state, last
addressed the United Nations in 1974.
   Shultz' statement spelled out the relationship between the United
States and the New York-based United Nations. The United States is
obligated by the 1947 U.N. Headquarters Agreement to allow people to
enter the United States on U.N. business.
   But Congress has stipulated that the United States has the right
to bar entry to aliens to safeguard the nation's security. In this
regard, U.S. law excludes members of the PLO from entering the
United States because the organization engages in terrorism.
   However, the PLO has observer status at the U.N. and some of its
members have routinely been granted visa waivers, the department
said.
   ``The PLO therefore has had, and continues to have, ample
opportunity to make its positions known to the membership of the
United Nations'' it said.
   Earlier this year, Congress passed legislation to close the PLO's
observer mission at the U.N., but the measure was overturned by a
federal court.
   Lawrence Schilling, an attorney who represented the PLO in the
observer mission case, called Shultz' decision unwise and said he
would not rule out a similar court challenge on the denial of a visa
to Arafat.
   ``There can be no reasonable claim that Mr. Arafat represents any
kind of security problem and his visit to the United Nations is very
much in the interest of peace,'' Schilling said in an interview from
his New York office.
   Clovis Maksoud, the League of Arab States' ambassador to the
United States, said his organization would join Arafat's call to
move the U.N. debate on Palestine issues to a ``more accomodating
venue.''
   Maksoud said the reasoning offered by Shultz ``renders U.S.
policy on the Palestinian question hostage to Israeli idocyncricies,
responsive to Israeli false allegations and in tandem with Israel's
priorities and annexationist designs.''
   ``It is now for the U.N. to salvage the credibility of its
resolutions, the integrity of its deliberations and the reputation
of its enhanced stature,'' he said.
   The State Department listed terrorist incidents linked to the
PLO, but said the United States ``firmly believes that Palestinian
political rights must be recognized and addressed.''
   It also praised the outcome of the recent Palestine National
Council meeting in Algiers in which the PNC, the PLO's
parliament-in-exile, for the first time implicitly recognized
Israel's right to exist.
   However, Barukh Binah, a spokesman for the Israeli U.N. Mission,
maintains that the PLO's convenant still calls for the destruction
of Israel and that the PLO has never accepted U.N. resolutions 242
and 338 which recognize Israel's right to exist.
   The State Department statement on the visa denial said the PNC
session produced signs that there are Palestinians trying to move
the PLO in a ``constructive way.''
   ``This is encouraging and should continue,'' it said. ``It is
unfortunate that the blight of terrorism still afflicts the
Palestinian cause and leaves no alternative to decisions such as the
secretary has taken today.''
   As evidence of the PLO's ties to terrorism, the department cited
the presence at the PNC session in Algiers of Abu Abbas, a member of
the PLO's executive committee who has been convicted in Italy of
murdering Leon Klinghoffer, an American tourist killed aboard the
cruise ship Achille Lauro in the Mediterranean in 1985.
   It also said that Force 17 and the Hawari organizations,
offshoots of the PLO, have engaged in terrorist operations since the
PLO renounced terrorism in Cairo in November 1985.
   As for long-term prospects in the Middle East, the department
said Palestinian participation is required at every stage to bring
about a settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict. ``Significant
progress'' has already been achieved, it said. ``All participants
must renounce violence and terrorism.''
   The PNC has proclaimed the Palestinian state in the
Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip and at least 20 nations,
but not the United States, have subsequently recognized that claim.

   A court sentenced a man to five
years in prison for continuing to have sexual relations after he was
diagnosed as having AIDS, a newspaper reported Saturday.
   The Municipal Court of Prague, hearing the case on appeal, added
an additional two years to the man's original three-year sentence
that was handed down by the court in October, Slobodne Slovo
reported.
   The report said the man tested positive for AIDS in December 1986
and was the first such reported victim of the disease in
Czechoslovakia.
   The daily newspaper said the man continued to have homosexual
relations ``not with one, but with 16 partners (and) did not use
condoms.''
   The 26-year-old student was reported as saying that he failed to
use condoms ``out of fear that he would lose his partners.'' The
report did not say when the verdict was handed down.
   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome is caused by a virus that
damages the body's immune system, leaving victims susceptible to
infections and cancer.
   The fatal disease is spread most often through sexual contact,
needles or syringes shared by drug abusers, infected blood or blood
products, and from pregnant women to their offspring.

   Palestine Liberation Organization officials
on Saturday accused the United States of violating international law
by forbidding PLO leader Yasser Arafat to visit the United Nations
headquarters in New York.
   Bassam Abu Sharif, chief spokesman for Arafat, told reporters the
United States had made ``a big mistake by breaching the agreement
... Between the United Nations as an institution and the United
States government.''
   Abu Sharif made the statement a few hours after Arafat arrived in
Amman from Baghdad on a Middle East tour.
   Abu Sharif said Arafat would not comment on the U.S. move until
he had read a text of the State Department refusal to issue him a
visa to enter the United States.
   Abu Sharif said the PLO has ``a lot of friends in the U.N.'' and
would take ``all steps necessary to address the United Nations
session.''
   Prime Minister Zaid Rifai met Arafat on arrival in Amman and
later visited him for about 30 minutes at the heavily guarded
government guest palace in the capital.
   PLO officials filed the visa request on Friday with the U.S.
Consulate in Tunis, Tunisia, where the PLO has its headquarters. On
Saturday, Secretary of State George P. Shultz announced in
Washington that Arafat's application was rejected because of the
PLO's positions.
   The PLO had requested the visa so Arafat could travel to New York
to address the United Nations on Dec. 1 during its debate on
Palestinian issues.
   ``The U.S. government has convincing evidence that PLO elements
have engaged in terrorism against Americans and others,'' said a
statement issued by Shultz. Moreover, Arafat, as PLO chairman,
``knows of, condones, and lends support to such acts,'' and is ``an
accessory to such terrorism.''
   When the PLO applied for the visa, State Department spokesman
Charles Redman said the United States would ``severely scrutinize
Arafat's application.'' The U.S. government has been under intense
domestic pressure from Jewish leaders and others to deny the visa.
   In Jerusalem, Foreign Minister Shimon Peres praised the U.S.
decision. A spokesman said Peres sent a telegram to Shultz
expressing Israel's ``appreciation of this decision.''
   Nadia Younes, spokeswoman for U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez
de Cuellar, said there would be no immediate comment until U.N.
officials read the State Department's statement.
   Nasser Kidwa, alternate permanent representative of the PLO at
the United Nations, said: ``Such a U.S. position constitutes a
direct strike against the peace process in the Middle East, and
against any attempt to achieve peace.''
   Arafat's aides have been referring to the upcoming address as a
matter of fact. Earlier this week, a PLO spokesman said Arafat would
use the speech to ask the General Assembly to grant the new
Palestinian state U.N. membership.
   The PLO was granted U.N. observer status in 1974, following
Arafat's last address before the assembly. In August, the Reagan
administration lost a legal battle to close the PLO's U.N.missionon
grounds the PLO endorses terrorism.
   Shortly before Shultz announced his decision, Arafat said in
Kuwait that he would call for the U.N. debate on Palestinian issues
to be moved to Geneva if the United States rejected his visa to
visit New York.
   There was no immediate reaction from U.N. officials on Arafat's
call for the proceedings to be moved.
   Arafat later stopped Jordan after visiting Kuwait and Iraq. He is
touring 22 Arab League countries to gain support for the independent
Palestinian state declared by the Palestine National Council, the
PLO's parliament-in-exile.
   The council proclaimed the Palestinian state in the
Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip at a meeting in Algiers,
Algeria, on Nov. 15. The declaration implicitly recognized the right
of Israel to exist.
   The United States has said it will not negotiate with the PLO
until Arafat explicitly recognizes the right of Israel to exist and
renounces terrorism.

   A tornado destroyed at least four homes,
damaged 38 others and did more than $1 million damage to just one of
three schools it hit Saturday morning, but no serious injuries were
reported, officials said.
   The twister, reported to be about 100 yards wide, caused
extensive damage to the high school, the junior high, the elementary
school, a cotton gin and a service station in this town of about
3,500.
   ``We were scared, and we hoped the Lord wasn't angry with his
people here in the house,'' 29-year-old Joe Brown said of her
13-member family whose house had windows blown out and the roof
partly blown off.
   Jim Maher, director of the Mississippi Emergency Management
Agency, said Saturday that one mobile home and three other homes
were no longer habitable. He said seven other homes had major damage
and 31 had minor damage.
   He said the Red Cross had set up a temporary shelter at the
Ruleville Community Center, but people apparently were staying with
relatives and friends instead.
   Mayor Harvey Springer said several looters were seen at the high
school, which had extensive damage to classrooms and the gymnasium.
   Jimmy Smith, principal of Ruleville Central High School, set what
he called a ``conservative'' damage estimate of $1 million to the
school. The building was filled with about an inch of water.
   The Sunflower County School Board was scheduled to meet Monday to
review the disaster damage, and decide when and where classes may
resume for students at the three Ruleville schools.
   Police officer Otis Abron said he was monitoring his radio when
the window of his patrol car was blown out by hail. The tornado
touched down moments later about 200 yards away.
   ``I can't describe much of it,'' he said. ``It just looked like a
dark spot coming through.''
   ``The best thing about this whole thing is that there were no
injuries reported,'' he said.
   Sharron Gary, 25, said she jumped into a closet after she saw the
family car rolling down the street. The roof of the Garys' house was
blown off and the living room was destroyed.
   ``If anybody had been in the living room, it would have been
death,'' she said. Five other people, including three children, were
in the house when the tornado hit. No one was injured.
   ``We fell into the closet,'' said Arlicia Gary, 18. ``Everything
was shaking, glass was falling, tables slamming up against the door.
It seemed like it just came down on top of us.''
   One woman was sitting in her kitchen when the tornado hit.
   ``All of a sudden it got dark,'' said Emma Bankston, 55. ``I ran
into a hall and I was scared to death. I didn't hear nothing but
noise.''
   ``It was just terrible,'' she said. ``I couldn't do nothing but
just cry.''
   Her house had only minor damage, but the house next door was
destroyed.
   Red Cross volunteers were called in, and 120 inmates from the
state penitentiary in Parchman, about 15 miles away, were sent to
help clean up the town. The Ruleville Community Center was set up as
a shelter for victims.
   The mayor said he would ask that the town be declared a disaster
area.
   In Bolivar County, sheriff's officials reported a twister that
touched down about the same time destroyed a metal shed. No injuries
were reported.

   The wedding was a success but the video
was a flop, so Claire Lockett and Michael Narramore reassembled the
cast of hundreds, put their wedding finery back and staged a remake
of the big moment on Saturday.
   Despite five hours of shooting, the videotape of the original
wedding two months ago amounted to only eight usable minutes of
distinctly patchy quality.
   Rita Lockett was so disappointed not to have a video record of
her daughter's big day that she spent $18,500 for a repeat
performance, skipping only the ceremony itself.
   A fleet of limousines took family and friends from the church in
the south coast resort town to the five-star Imperial Hotel for a
glittering reception for 200 guests, just as before.
   Everyone wore exactly the same outfits, sat in precisely the same
positions, and made identical speeches.
   This time they entrusted the filming to an expert and were
counting on a better result.
   There were several TV cameras there as well.
   ``So we will be ending up with the best wedding video of all
time,'' said Mrs. Lockett.

   Two mothers tipped police to drugs in their
sons' bedrooms, leading to the arrest of one of the teen-agers and
confiscation of cocaine from both, police said.
   The recent arrest of a 14-year-old Landover boy came after his
mother told police that she had found the drug in the youth's room,
said Carol Landrum, a spokesman for the police department.
   The son was charged with possession of a controlled dangerous
substance with intent to distribute and was being held at Boys
Village in Cheltenham, Landrum said. Police said they seized 19
grams of cocaine, which officers said could sell for $4,700 if
divided into smaller amounts.
   Only one day earlier, another Landover woman told police she
found nearly seven ounces of cocaine, with a street value police
placed at about $47,000, under her son's bed and a handgun in his
dresser drawer. Police did not immediately make an arrest in that
case, Landrum said.
   Police declined to identify either woman.
   Police Chief Robert Zidek in neighboring Bladensburg, whose
department offers parents a videotape showing how to search for
drugs, said the mothers probably did the right thing to help their
sons.
   ``They may have tried everything else, and nothing worked,''
Zidek said.
   He advises parents who think their child is using drugs to talk
to the child first, get the child professional counseling and save
calling the police as a last resort.

   President Saddam Hussein on Saturday refused
to grant clemency for his son, who is accused of killing one of his
father's bodyguards.
   In an address to an Arab youth meeting, Saddam said the case has
been referred to judicial authorities and they would make a decision
in accordance with the law.
   The Iraqi president was responding to a petition submitted by the
meeting's participants seeking a pardon for his 25-year-old son,
Odai, who is under indictment in the Oct. 18 death of Kamel Hana
Gegeo.
   ``I will not make use of my constitutional right to pardon this
man,'' he told the youth meeting.
   ``Rather, if you had asked me to give you my house, I would
immediately collect my belongings and leave,'' he said.
   Other calls for a pardon _ including one from Gegeo's father,
Hana, reportedly a cook for the president _ have appeared in
state-run newspapers over the past few days.
   In a letter published in state-run newspapers earlier this week,
Saddam ordered Justice Minister Akram Abdul Qader Al-Douri to
investigate the killing. Al-Douri appointed a three-member committee
of judges to carry out the investigation.
   His letter said Gegeo was slain during a dispute with Odai as
Gegeo was firing his gun in a villa near the presidential palace.
When Gegeo refused to stop, Odai struck him in the head with a bat.
The letter said Gegeo died in the hospital.
   The Iraqi leader said Odai, the eldest of his five children,
tried to commit suicide after hearing of the death. Informed sources
in Nicosia said the bodyguard was the son of the governess who
raised Saddam's three daughters.

   A swarm of killer bees apparently
roused by a workman cutting tree branches attacked seven people on
the outskirts of the city, a newspaper reported Saturday.
   A health center treated the victims of the attack Friday for
nausea, dizziness, swelling and pain, but none became seriously ill,
the newspaper Barricada said.
   Callers to a radio talk show of the government's Voice of
Nicaragua criticized Barricada's report, which ran under an
eight-column headline. One of them said it ``could generate hysteria
in the population.''
   An electrical worker cutting tree branches apparently provoked
the attack, the newspaper said.
   Barricada, the newspaper of the ruling Sandinista party, did not
say how it was known that the bees were killer or Africanized bees.
   However, one radio caller said such attacks are frequent in the
countryside, especially in the western part of this Central American
country.
   The bees, descended from South African bees that escaped from a
Brazilian researcher in 1956, are an especially aggressive strain
that produces less honey. In Central and South America, Africanized
bees have largely displaced European bees, which are used for
commercial honeymaking.
   The killer bees have reached southern Mexico and are moving north
at about 200 to 300 miles a year, experts say.

<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II met Saturday with Libya's
second-in-command and said he prays every day for Libyan leader Col.
Moammar Gadhafi.
   The pope met for 30 minutes in his private library with
Staff-Maj. Abdulsalam Jalloud, who is on an official visit to Italy.
The meeting was listed as a private audience and the Vatican
released no details of the talks.
   A Lebanese prelate from the Vatican's Secretariat of State acted
as interpreter for the talks. Afterwards, the pope posed for
photographs with Jalloud and Libya's ambassador to Italy, Abdel
Rahman Shalgam, and presented the Libyans with pontifical medals.
   ``Every day I pray for Libya, especially for President Gadhafi,''
John Paul told his guests. ``Thank you for coming. I bless the
Libyan people.''
   The Libyan official, who arrived a few minutes late, received a
low-key welcome. The pope did not come out of his study to greet him
as he often does with visitors.
   It was the pope's third meeting with Jalloud at the Vatican after
previous visits in May 1982 and December 1984.
   The Holy See does not have formal diplomatic relations with
Libya. But since 1986 the pope has had a representative for Libya
based in Algiers, Archbishop Giovanni De Andrea.
   Jalloud is the highest-ranking Libyan official to make an
official visit to Italy since Libya fired a missile at the tiny
Italian island of Lampedusa in April 1986.
   The missile, which fell harmlessly in the sea, was launched a few
hours after the U.S. bombing raids on two Libyan cities.
   Jalloud met Thursday and Friday with several high-ranking
offficials, including Premier Ciriaco De Mita, President Francesco
Cossiga and Foreign Minister Giulio Andreotti.
   His trip is seen as part of a Libyan effort to break out of
international isolation, improve relations with the West and expand
economic ties with European countries.
   Italy, which depends greatly on Libya oil, is Libya's largest
trading partner.

   The new reality-based crime shows on U.S.
television are reaping some benefits north of the border, where
Canadian viewers have helped police track down at least four
fugitives in less than three months.
   Canadian Press reported Saturday that the latest fugitive to
learn that television signals cross borders was Michael Cooper, 40,
wanted on an Oregon warrant for rape, kidnapping and robbery.
   Cooper had been living in the Vancouver area for more than a year
under an assumed name, CP said.
   Police were tipped off to his whereabouts by a viewer who saw his
picture beamed into Canada by a Tacoma, Wash., television station
showing Fox Broadcasting's syndicated show ``America's Most
Wanted,'' the news agency said.
   A week ago, a man wanted in connection with the rape and murder
of two teen-aged girls in Tennessee was arrested in London, Ontario.
CP said Joseph Shepherd, 35, was detained after a local resident
watched an episode of the NBC's ``Unsolved Mysteries.''
   Shepherd had been on the run since a 1978 shootout with U.S.
marshals, and had been living and working in London under a false
name for at least four years, along with his wife and three
children, Canadian Press said.
   On Sept. 22, ``America's Most Wanted'' chalked up the arrest of
Frederick Merrill. The 41-year-old Connecticut prison escapee and
rape suspect had been living in Toronto but fled to New Brunswick
after a Toronto-area resident recognized him on the program, CP said.
   Two weeks earlier, convicted Philadelphia killer Joseph Kindler
also was recaptured in New Brunswick, it said.
   The subject of a protracted extradition tussle before he escaped
custody in Montreal, Kindler had also been living in Toronto and was
found after a broadcast of America's Most Wanted, the agency said.
   The closest Canadian version of the genre is the Crimestoppers TV
series, which has resulted in more than 14,000 arrests across Canada
since its inception in 1982.
   Typically, ``America's Most Wanted'' screens re-enactments of
particular crimes, together with pertinent details of the fugitives.
Viewers are invited to phone police if they have information.
``Unsolved Mysteries'' follows a similar format.

<HEAD>Britain Seeks Extradition of Irish Priest for IRA Crimes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Britain is asking the Republic of Ireland to
extradite a Roman Catholic priest suspected of IRA crimes, police
said Saturday, a day after Belgium freed him to fly home to Dublin.
   Patrick Ryan was freed from a Belgian jail Friday after a
three-week hunger strike in a decision that stirred anger among
British officials.
   In London, legislator Terry Dicks of the governing Conservative
Party said, ``It is ... shameful that the Belgian government should
behave in this way.''
   In the British-ruled province of Northern Ireland, however,
supporters of the outlawed Irish Republican Army cheered the
priest's freedom.
   In Belfast, Gerry Adams, president of the IRA's political wing
known as Sinn Fein, told a rally: ``Father Ryan, like countless
other Irish nationals before him, had been found guilty by the
British media before he had even set foot in an English court. Being
Irish meant he was guilty.''
   Belgian authorities arrested Ryan on June 30 during a raid on a
Brussels apartment. City police were quoted as saying the apartment
contained manuals on bomb-making.
   Ryan was said to have traveled from Spain to Belgium on a false
passport. He initially asked for political asylum in Belgium.
   British authorities initiated moves to extradite Ryan from
Belgium, accusing him of conspiracy to murder and causing bomb
attacks in crimes dating back to 1975.
   The IRA is fighting to end British rule in mostly Protestant
Northern Ireland and unite it with the Republic of Ireland, which is
95 percent Catholic.
   Belgian Prime Minister Wilfried Martens' government, announcing
its decision to free Ryan, said the facts provided by British
authorities were imprecise and lacked ``the elements of the
punishable offense of gang-forming'' required by Belgian law. He was
flown to Dublin aboard a Belgian military airplane.
   In London on Saturday, police at Scotland Yard headquarters said
magistrates granted a warrant Friday evening for Ryan's extradition.
   Ryan was in Dublin's Blackrock clinic, a hospital, after being
reunited with his family. There was no word on whether his hunger
strike may have damaged his health.
   After Ryan arrived at Dublin airport, Prime Minister Charles
Haughey's socialist government issued a statement referring to
``Father Ryan's right as an Irish citizen to enter this country at
any time.''
   Ryan joined the Catholic Pallotine order in Ireland and became a
priest in 1949. He worked in Tanzania and the United States before
London.
   Britain has tried before to persuade Ireland to extradite
suspects charged with IRA crimes. Irish authorities have repeatedly
refused on technical grounds, creating a sore point in British-Irish
relations.

   Authorities worked Saturday to clean up a
freight train derailment that released a poisonous fertilizer,
forcing the evacuation of more than 250 residents and sending two
motorists to a hospital.
   One witness said the 89-car Union Pacific train might have been
hit by a tornado, causing 35 of its cars to derail. Though a tornado
was reported to have landed in this tiny east Texas town at the
time, authorities said they were uncertain what caused the accident
about 7:30 p.m. Friday during a heavy thunderstorm.
   More than three-quarters of one tank car's 30,000 gallons of
anhydrous ammonia spilled, and the cleanup was continuing 24 hours
later, officials said.
   Anhydrous ammonia is shipped as a liquid, but a puncture would
cause a gas cloud, John Bromley, a spokesman at the railroad's
Omaha, Neb., headquarters, said.
   ``It's a fertilizer, what farmers put on their fields,'' Bromley
said.
   Capt. David Schlottach of the Tyler Fire Department Hazardous
Materials Response Team estimated 6,000 to 7,000 gallons had to be
drained from the car before the cleanup could begin.
   Environmental workers and hazardous waste handlers drained the
ammonia into a pit they dug near the wreckage. There they planned to
neutralize it, pumping in air and then water to create ammonium
hydroxide, which could be vacuumed into storage trucks, Schlottach
said.
   Another car carrying the fertilizer and one carrying chlorine,
which also is hazardous, were not leaking, said Alex Tice, the
railroad's regional director for public relations.
   The train derailed about one-half mile west of the community of
400, which is about 70 miles east of Dallas. Authorities closed two
nearby roads and evacuated residents within one mile to the north
and three-fourths of a mile to the south as a precaution, said
Schlottach.
   The train's four-member crew was not injured, said Tice. However,
two people who were driving near the derailment were overcome by
ammonia fumes and taken to Terrell Community Hospital. An emergency
room supervisor said the two were kept overnight, but were not
seriously injured.
   The Rev. Tom Pesnell said 45 to 50 of the evacuees were staying
at his Main Street Baptist Church in nearby Grand Saline.
   ``There are some that have gone to stay with their various
families. There are some staying in motels,'' he added.
   James Boyd, whose home is about a third of a mile from the
derailment, said what he believed was a tornado ``toppled 15 to 20
cars'' on Highway 80.
   ``It knocked down trees, toppled our TV antenna,'' he said.
   Don Travis, superintendent of the Fruitvale school district, said
he was driving along Highway 80 when he saw a train on the tracks
and his eyes began to burn.
   ``We were driving and could smell the ammonia really well,'' he
said.
   ``The weather was real bad,'' said Travis. ``While I was driving,
there was real strong wind and some hail. I had to move a tree out
of the road at one point.''

<DATELINE>BRAGADO, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 3,000 people marched silently at
a Roman Catholic church Saturday to demand the ouster of a new
pastor that the town council has accused of ignoring human rights
abuses.
   ``I'm not going to send any of my kids to that church for
confession before someone who is capable of crucifying Christ,''
said Marta de la Torre, a 40-year-old housewife.
   The Rev. Christian von Wernich was leading a Mass for about 300
people inside while the protesters marched outside.
   The 16-member council that governs this town of 40,000 declared
von Wernich unwelcome and last week asked the church to remove him.
   ``The community of Bragado is not confronting the wise and
ancient church, only one of its priests who, by action or inaction,
lost his good reputation during the dark years of repression,'' the
council said in a statement issued Saturday.
   Von Wernich, a 50-year-old, balding man with a stern demeanor,
drove into this prosperous farm community about 125 miles west of
Buenos Aires on Nov. 17.
   He was met at the door of Santa Rosa de Lima church by about 500
people. Some shouted, ``Murderer! Murderer!'' and others carried
placards that said, ``We don't want torturers.''
   The heart of the complaints against von Wernich is that, as
chaplain for the Buenos Aires provincial police during the late
1970s, he visited detention centers where hundreds of young
Argentines were tortured and killed. Yet his critics say he never
denounced the police.
   The military and security forces at that time were trying to
stamp out an urban guerrilla movement.
   During the dictatorship that followed the overthrow of President
Isabel Peron in 1976, an estimated 9,000 Argentines disappeared and
were presumed executed, according to a government commission
appointed by President Raul Alfonsin.
   Argentina was ruled by three military juntas between Mrs. Peron's
ouster and Alfonsin's election in October 1983.
   Von Wernich until earlier this month served in the smaller
community of Norberto de la Riestra north of Bragado.
   He has in the past denied the accusations of his detractors.
During the past week, he has refused to comment to reporters.
   Von Wernich has his supporters. Attorney Sergio Tente said he
thinks the priest is being unfairly persecuted and those doing so
``should be excommunicated from the Catholic Church.''
   But many others side with Jose Idiart, 57, whose daughter was
arrested by security forces and never seen again.
   Idiart said von Wernich told the family on several occasions that
their daughter was well and would return. She never did.
   ``It's clear that von Wernich shielded himself behind his cassock
to collaborate with murderers,'' Idiart said.
   So far, the church has backed the priest. However, Bishop
Jeronimo Podesta hinted that it might transfer him, saying, ``A
priest repudiated by his flock cannot be their pastor.''

<TEXT>
   Troops battled leftist guerrillas in a
remote area east of Bogota on Saturday, and 19 rebels and a soldier
were killed, a military commander said.
   The battle broke out after soldiers discovered the guerrilla camp
in the Sierra de la Mararena region in the remote eastern plains,
150 miles east of Bogota, Gen. Rafael Padilla Vergara, commander of
the army's 2nd Division, said on the RCN radio.
   He said the army found a clandestine landing strip and coca
plants, from which cocaine is cultivated, a sign the Colombian
Revolutionary Armed Forces guerrillas and cocaine traffickers were
working together in the area.
   He said the soldiers also found an arms cache that had once
belonged to the Colombian army. He did not say whether the weapons
had been stolen or captured.
   Colombian guerrillas often forge alliances with drug traffickers,
providing protection to the drug runners for a share of the huge
profits.
   ``Probably the landing strip is used for the transport of arms
with the destination to guerrillas and the export of cocaine grown
in this region,'' Padilla Vergara said.
   The attack was the first since President Virgilio Barco announced
emergency measures Friday to fight leftist rebels, right-wing
paramilitary groups and drug traffickers.
   Barco promised to increase the security forces and stiffen
penalties for terrorist-related killings.
   Colombian rebel armies have an estimated 10,000 members, and are
blamed for more than 2,000 deaths and nearly 500 kidnappings this
year alone.

   A sickly infant snatched from her
hospital bassinet was found in apparent good health Saturday after a
woman went to a bar to show off a baby she claimed was born only
hours earlier, police said.
   Two people were held Saturday on kidnapping charges in Washtenaw
County Jail in connection with the incident, Ann Arbor Police Sgt.
Jim Tieman said.
   The 4-pound, 8-ounce girl was reported taken at 6:35 p.m. Friday
from C.S. Mott Children's Hospital in Ann Arbor. She was recovered
about 11 a.m. Saturday at the suspects' apartment in Howell, about
20 miles away, Tieman said.
   Tieman would not release the suspects' names, but described the
woman as being in her 30s and the man as in his 40s. He said they
were not related to the baby's 17-year-old mother.
   The 2{-month-old infant, Debra Lynn Moore, was receiving
medication at the hospital for breathing problems when she was
taken. The premature infant also was hooked up to electronic
monitoring equipment and required feeding every three hours to
prevent dehydration.
   An alarm went off when she was removed from a bassinet Friday
evening, but the baby was gone when hospital workers reached the
room, said police Sgt. Mark Jones.
   ``She seems to be in good condition,'' said Catherine Cureton, a
spokeswoman for the University of Michigan Medical Center, which
operates Mott Hospital. ``She was doing remarkably well before this
happened and is doing well now.''
   Tieman said a caller Saturday morning notified the department
that the suspects showed up in Howell with the baby at 9:30 p.m.
Friday saying she had given birth to the baby at a hospital only
hours earlier.
   ``Everybody said who ... would bring a two-hour-old baby in the
bar,'' said John Cleary of Cleary's Pub, where the infant was taken
Friday night.
   Police investigating the tip went to the apartment and while
there, the suspects drove up with the baby sitting in a car seat.
   Tieman said he did not know the motive for the kidnapping.
   The baby's mother, Kimberly Sue Moore of Monroe, who was not at
the hospital when the baby was taken, said Saturday she thought she
saw the suspects Tuesday in the baby's ward.
   ``People have been following me around the hospital, and people
had been seeing my baby at the hospital that I didn't know,'' she
said. ``I've seen them up here. I believe they were the people who
were up here Tuesday asking to see my baby.''
   She said she notified hospital employees of the strangers.
   Debra was returned to the hospital about 1 p.m. Saturday, and it
was not known when the baby would be released, Cureton said.
   Debra's twin brother, in a nearby bassinet and receiving oxygen,
was unharmed, Tieman said. Breathing difficulties are not uncommon
in premature babies, whose lungs may not have matured before birth.
   The suspects were to appear in 15th District Court in Ann Arbor
on Monday.

   Eastern Canada's strongest earthquake in 53 years
knocked out power and telephone service, buckled railroad tracks,
shook buildings and sent tremors from Michigan to Washington.
   About 50 people near the quake's epicenter at Chicoutimi, Quebec,
suffered minor cuts and bruises, but no serious injuries were
reported in Canada or in the United States. One American said he was
knocked out of his seat; others said windows rattled, dishes fell
from shelves and ceilings cracked.
   Seismologists said the quake registered 6.0 on the Richter scale,
enough to cause severe damage, but damage was relatively minor.
Janet Drysdale of the Geological Survey of Canada placed the
epicenter about 90 miles northwest of Quebec City and just east of
the St. Lawrence River along a minor fault zone.

   President Roh Tae-woo today asked the
nation to forgive his predecessor, Chun Doo-hwan, and promised
amnesty and compensation for political prisoners jailed under Chun's
rule.
   ``I will liquidate past wrongdoings and carry out bold reforms in
the government and governing party in the quest of a new era,'' Roh
said in a nationwide television address.
   Roh pledged a major shuffle of the government and governing
Democratic Justice Party and a revision of undemocratic laws to
prevent more abuses. Opposition parties immediately rejected Roh's
appeal and said Chun had to account fully for corruption and human
rights abuses under his seven-year rule. Opposition leaders said
Chun should be investigated by the National Assembly and a special
prosecutor.

   President-elect George Bush should make a top
priority of slashing aid to farmers, particularly those subsidies
that reward farmers for high production, the conservative Heritage
Foundation think tank said.
   The report said farmers are generally better off than commonly
believed and should be forced to operate in a more competitive
environment with fewer government handouts.
   The Bush administration should develop a farm policy that would
``help American farmers break out (of a) cycle of dependence'' on
federal subsidies, Charles Grizzle wrote in the Heritage
Foundation's forthcoming policy guidebook. Grizzle, a former senior
official in the Agriculture Department, said the key to weaning
farmers from government aid is to ``decouple'' subsidy programs from
production requirements.

will have at least one brief, shining moment to recall from 1988.
   Christmas shoppers crowded stores around the country Friday in a
post-Thanksgiving rush worthy of its traditional billing as the

   Malls and downtowns were crowded early with people racing to snap
