   A British citizen who was captured in Rome last
May after five years as a fugitive was fined $25,000 Tuesday after
pleading guilty to violating export controls by selling computer
equipment to Eastern Bloc countries.
   In an arrangement with the U.S. Justice Department, Brian Moller
Butcher of London pleaded guilty to five counts of violating the
Commodities Control Act by funneling computer and laboratory
equipment through Britain to Poland, Bulgaria and Romania. Fourteen
other counts were dropped.
   In addition to the fines, Butcher was sentenced to time already
served. He had been held since his arrest.
   The Justice Department contended the items were computer
processors that had military applications, but Butcher said the
equipment was ``low-tech'' Hewlett-Packard test lab equipment that
could have been purchased in a number of countries but was cheaper
in the United States.
   ``They're of dual use, they had commercial and military uses,''
Assistant U.S. Attorney Kevin F. Driscoll said in recommending
Butcher be sentenced to two years in prison and fined $150,000.
   But U.S. District Judge Rya Zobel said she did not see the need
for so severe a sentence. ``I may be obtuse, but I don't see it,''
she said.
   ``There was no breach of security to the NATO countries or the
United States,'' defense attorney Paul F. Markham said. ``The only
way these could have hurt someone is if they had dropped out of an
airplane and hit them on the head.''
   Butcher and Paul Carlson, a U.S. citizen, were indicted in 1981
for the scheme. Carlson pleaded guilty and was fined $5,000 when
the case came to trial in 1983. Butcher, 55, said after appearing
in court Tuesday that he had fled the United States because of the
nation's political climate.
   ``Things got rather hot politically in the early days of
(President Ronald) Reagan,'' he said. ``I think things have cooled
off now and reason has returned.''
   Sources told The Associated Press an associate of Butcher's
indicted on similar charges in Phoenix became a government
informant and lured Butcher to his arrest in Rome under the pretext
of another illegal export scheme.

   The Cabinet on Thursday put Crown Prince Akihito
temporarily in charge of all imperial affairs, and Emperor Hirohito
remained in serious but stable condition four days after falling
ill, officials said.
   Hirohito's chief doctor said the 87-year-old monarch's condition
``clearly stabilized'' Wednesday after an intestinal hemorrhage
made the emperor vomit blood. But the doctor said he wasn't sure
the bleeding had stopped.
   The world's longest-reigning monarch was given oxygen and
intravenous feeding, officials and news reports said. But palace
officials, widely quoted in press reports, said the emperor on
Wednesday requested food and a television in order to watch his
favorite sport, sumo wrestling.
   Chief Cabinet Secretary Keizo Obuchi, the government's main
spokesman, said the Cabinet on Thursday morning agreed to appoint
Crown Prince Akihito, 54, in charge of all imperial duties.
   ``Taking into consideration the emperor's illness and (the time
required for) medical treatment, we have asked the crown prince to
temporarily assume (imperial) responsibilities,'' Obuchi said in a
nationally televised news conference.
   One year ago, when Hirohito underwent an intestinal bypass
operation, the prince took charge of all duties for three months.
Last December, Hirohito resumed seven of the 12 designated imperial
functions, which include placing an official seal on government
appointments and new laws, and convocation of Parliament.
   Tokyo's stock market plunged and then recovered on news of
Hirohito's condition Wednesday but remained calm in morning trading
Thursday following upbeat reports in local newspapers.
   News reports said government officials also began the process of
selecting a name for the next emperor's reign. Japanese normally
use the name and year of the emperor's reign in giving dates,
rather than the system generally used in the rest of the world.
   The emperor's chief physician, Akira Takagi, said the emperor
showed signs of jaundice and anemia, but his condition had
stabilized since he began vomiting blood late Monday night.
   On Tuesday, the emperor, in bed in the Imperial Palace, received
a total of 2.55 pints of blood in three transfusions.
   But Takagi said he ``couldn't say with confidence'' that
Hirohito's internal bleeding stopped. He said the emperor's
pancreas was even more inflamed than last September, when pressure
from the organ on the upper intestine forced doctors to perform the
intestinal bypass.
   At the Imperial Palace in central Tokyo, government officials
and diplomats continued to pay their respects while hundreds of
people gathered outside of the gates to bow and pray.
   The crowd included people of all ages, some having arrived by
chartered bus from more than 500 miles away.
   ``When I read newspapers reporting (the emperor) was in critical
condition, I felt like my grandfather was dying,'' said Aya Kitade,
a 22-year-old college student from Kyoto, 230 miles away.
   Each of the palace's seven gates was surrounded by people, some
weeping, some kneeling.
   ``I could not bear staying home and watching the emperor suffer
on television,'' said Eiyoshi Kiguchi, a 71-year-old Tokyo resident
who served in the navy in World War II.
   Kiguchi sat on the curb in front of the main palace gate and
rubbed tears from his eyes.
   ``I adore the emperor and always prayed for his well-being,'' he
said. ``He has been through a lot, and his life was full of
hardships. No emperor had such a wild life as him.''
   A middle-aged man said this may be the last chance for the
Japanese to express honest feelings about the emperor.
   ``If you make sympathetic remarks about the emperor or the
imperial family itself when the emperor is well, people will see
you as an imperialist or even a right-winger,'' he said. ``But now
that the emperor is visibly suffering, no one can attack you if you
express sympathy toward him.''
   Across Japan, Shinto shrines held services to pray for the
ailing monarch. Before he was forced to renounce his divinity by
U.S. occupation officials after World War II, the emperor was
considered a living god and a direct descendent of the sun goddess,
Amaterasu.
   Many older people still hold Hirohito in high regard, but
younger Japanese typically have given little thought to the
emperor. A minority strongly oppose the imperial system, calling it
a vestige of the militarism that dominated wartime Japan.
   Officials said Foreign Minister Sosuke Uno canceled a planned
trip Thursday to Washington for talks with Secretary of State
George Shultz. Although the Foreign Ministry did not give a reason
for the cancellation, it was known that the emperor's illness
threatened the visit.
   The government also asked Italian Prime Minister Ciriaco De Mita
to postpone a scheduled visit beginning Sunday, Kyodo News Service
reported.

   Cruz Ayala Marroquin has spent his
working life for the past quarter century standing knee deep in the
Las Canas river shoveling sand onto the bank.
   He is an ``arenero,'' a sand-digger, and ekes out a meager
existence supplying sand for construction sites in San Salvador,
the capital 10 miles to the south.
   Manuel de Jesus spends his time pulling an iron-wheeled wagon
loaded with 800 pounds of bananas from the eastern bus terminal to
San Salvador's central market.
   Neither has anything to show for his work except the sinewy
muscle of his arms and back. What they earn with their toil is not
so much a living as another day's survival.
   The hard life is harder for the poor in El Salvador.
   Though there is no official parameter such as a ``poverty
line,'' it is clear that the great majority of El Salvador's 5.5
million people are poor.
   The U.S. Agency for International Development says 27 percent of
children under 5 are malnourished. Infant mortality is 91 per 1,000
live births, the highest rate in Central America.
   Half the population lacks safe drinking water, and the leading
cause of death is intestinal infection, according to the Ministry
of Health. Only four out of 10 people can read and write.
   ``With this you make enough to eat, that's it,'' says the
grizzled Ayala, 55, pausing to lean on his shovel. He and his wife
reared seven children in a two-room adobe house. Three of the six
boys became sand-diggers.
   Ayala rises every day, including Sunday, at 3 a.m. so as to be
at the river by 4. The first trucks arrive at dawn, by which time
Ayala has shoveled a ton of sand.
   On a good day he'll dig three or four one-ton truckloads and
make 15 to 20 colones ($3 to $4). With that his wife will buy rice,
beans, tortillas, perhaps a few eggs and some cheese _ enough for
the couple and their one remaining dependent child.
   ``You can't save a colon,'' he says. ``The few cents you set
aside go up in smoke with an illness, something like that.''
   He says he feels strong and plans on working at least five more
years. He'll depend on help from his sons when he can no longer
work.
   Ramon Aristedes Najarro, who digs about 50 yards downriver from
Ayala, is 48 years old and feels his strength draining. He doesn't
even want to think about how he'll get by when his back gives out.
   ``I'll just have to find something else. Selling newspapers, or
maybe I'll have to beg.''
   At the San Salvador's central market, Manuel de Jesus takes a
break with three other ``carretoneros,'' or cart-pullers, seated on
their sturdy wagons. A sweet, slightly nauseating odor wafts across
the narrow street from a pile of rotten or mashed bananas.
   A middle-aged woman searches through the pile for still edible
fruit.
   The cart-pullers, like the sand-diggers, make about $3 on an
average day. De Jesus, 28, and Granadeno Perez, 29, sleep in a
nearby flophouse that charges $2 a night for a piece of cardboard
on the floor and water for bathing. That leaves them a dollar for
food _ and for booze.
   ``Sometimes we go without eating to buy guaro,'' says Perez,
already in a semi-stupor from the cane liquor by 10 a.m. All four
cart-pullers readily admitted they try to maintain a constant
alcoholic haze.
   Several times a day they come up with the five colones to buy a
half-liter of Muneco, the cheapest guaro.
   ``It's very hard, this life,'' said de Jesus. ``There's no
future in it. It damages your body. The only thing you're left with
are the knocks.'' He motioned to Perez's bandaged hand, sprained
from the strain of hauling.
   Asked his feelings about leftist guerrillas who say they are
fighting for the poor, Ayala said: ``I understand nothing of
politics. But some say they (the guerrillas) would make this
another Nicaragua. I don't want that.''
   None of the sand-diggers or cart-pullers interviewed could read
and none has ever voted. Democracy, which returned to El Salvador
in 1982 after decades of military rule, means little to them.
   ``Democracy has done nothing,'' says Najarro. ``It hasn't
created jobs. You look out for yourself and get by as best you
can.''
   ``I doubt the country can progress,'' says Ayala. ``I don't have
faith.''

<TEXT>
   Premier Andreas Papandreou has taken the
Greeks by surprise again; but this time the focus is on his
personal life and not his politics.
   The 69-year-old premier, who is awaiting open-heart surgery in
London, last week announced he intends to divorce his American-born
wife Margaret after 37 years of marriage.
   The announcement came after Papandreou was pictured in Greek
newspapers strolling hand-in-hand through hospital grounds with his
companion Dimitra Liani, a 34-year-old flight attendant.
   In a country where politicians' private lives usually attract
little media attention, the socialist premier took the
unprecedented step of disclosing his relationship with the tall,
blonde Ms. Liani.
   Opinion is divided about the possible effects on his
government's popularity.
   A parliamentarian with Papandreou's governing Panhellenic
Socialist Movement, who spoke on condition of anonymity said: ``My
constituents are farmers with old-fashioned views about family
life, and I'll have a hard time explaining this (the planned
divorce) away.''
   But political analysts point out that previous disclosures about
Papandreou's private life failed to affect his approval rating.
   The analysts say the premier's refusal to appoint a stand-in
during his hospitalization in England is much more likely to erode
support for his party.
   ``Papandreou has a history of womanizing that never dented his
political appeal. But his absence leaves a power vacuum that makes
it clear PASOK is unlikely to survive unless he makes a miraculous
recovery,'' said Stratis Stratigis, a lawmaker with the liberal
opposition Democratic Renewal party.
   During seven years in power, Papandreou has skillfully
stage-managed abrupt changes in economic and foreign policy without
endangering his government's popularity. But his Panhellenic
Socialist Movement now faces the prospect of fighting national
elections due by mid-1989 with a weakened leader.
   Papandreou flew to London on August 25 for treatment of a
narrowing of the aorta, the main blood vessel carrying blood from
the heart.
   The premier's planned surgery at Harefield Hospital to replace a
heart valve has been postponed several times because of a liver
problem.
   The operation now is expected to take place in late September at
the earliest, according to his doctors.
   In the meantime, Papandreou is advising the government by
telephone, and senior Cabinet ministers take turns flying to London
for instructions.
   Mrs. Papandreou, 65, who runs a socialist feminist organization
in Greece, has not visited her husband in the hospital.
   She has not made any public statement on the divorce, and said
in a letter to an English-language Athens newspaper over the past
weekend, ``I will not do so until the health of Andreas is
assured.''
   The couple married in a civil ceremony in the United States in
1951, when Papandreou was an economics professor at the University
of Minnesota. Both had recently divorced.
   When Papandreou's relationship with Ms. Liani became public
knowledge a year ago, Mrs Papandreou said she did not intend to
seek a divorce.
   Ms. Liani, who studied at the Sorbonne University in Paris and
works for Olympic Airways, the Greek state carrier, met the premier
through his wife in 1986, and later was assigned to his official
plane.
   At that time, Mrs. Papandreou was seeking better media promotion
for feminism in Greece and chose Ms. Liani to host a Greek
television talk show on sexual equality called ``Miso-Miso'' (Half
and Half). The premier was one of the first guests interviewed by
Ms. Liani.
   Ms. Liani is divorcing her husband, Alexis Kapopoulos, 48, an
architect who works for state-run television.
   The Papandreous have four children and two grandchildren. Their
marriage has weathered difficulties in the past, but this time the
premier's attitude has markedly changed, as Greek commentators
pointed out.
   ``In the past, when a serious love affair produced his
(Papandreou's) child, the issue of his marriage never surfaced,''
Helen Vlachos wrote Sunday in her column in the Athens daily
Kathimerini.
   ``But he seems to have lost a sense of reality ... he acts as
though he's overlooked one detail: that he is the premier of
Greece,'' she wrote.
   She was referring to Papandreou's illegitimate daughter, born
after an affair he had with a Swedish actress while his family was
exiled in Stockholm during the 1967-74 military dictatorship that
ruled Greece.
   That affair was revealed a few days before a general election in
June 1985 in which Papandreou was re-elected by a comfortable
majority.
   Papandreou's meeting with his 18-year-old daughter Emilia Nyblom
at the end of an official visit to Sweden in January was widely
reported in Greek newspapers, but opinion polls showed no related
decline in his popularity.
   According to political pollster Panayote Dimitras, the lack of
electoral reaction is due to the fact that ``to many Greeks,
Papandreou and the other politicians are like Hollywood actors, so
you don't expect them to be perfect, and you certainly don't judge
them by your own domestic standards.''

   Bill Emerson went blind nine years ago,
but has used computers, a guide dog and determination to keep his
job as chief censor for KNBC-TV, where he reviews more than 8,000
commercials and hundreds of shows and movies each year.
   Emerson, 45, became the station's manager of broadcast standards
and practices in 1971, started losing his sight because of diabetes
in 1976 and was completely blind by February 1979, he recalled.
   The general manager of KNBC at the time offered him training and
union membership as an audio engineer, but Emerson declined the
offer.
   ``I had this job for nine years before I went blind. I have a
good memory and I am able to visualize quite well,'' he said in a
telephone interview Tuesday. ``And most of the people have been
with me a good number of years.''
   His staff of three watches shows for him and reports anything
questionable, and he can derive from the audio portion of a film or
tape that something objectionable might be showing.
   ``When I have a question I go to them,'' he said of the staff.
``I ask them, `What does this look like?'
   ``I probably am more aware of the audio track than others, so I
do catch some things that others don't,'' he said. In addition to
tape reviews, Emerson's wife reads scripts to him at home.
   He learned Braille, but said reading raised dots with his
fingers is too slow-paced.
   ``If I had to read a book in Braille, I would be asleep by the
fourth page,'' he said. ``I listen to all my books on audio tape on
double speed. You can train yourself to listen fast. And you get
twice the information in half the amount of time.''
   Emerson also listens to double-speed playbacks of audio tapes of
shows, such as ``Family Feud.''
   ``They sound like Donald Duck, but you can understand them,'' he
said.
   Emerson navigates the halls and offices at KNBC with the help of
his yellow Labrador retriever Niles and a light-sensitive sounding
device.
   His workday also is made easier with help from a keyboard
plugged into a computer that's equipped with a voice synthesizer
and program to run it. The computer announces screening
appointments and keeps Emerson abreast of time schedules for
commercials and other matters.
   The dog also gets to help in other ways.
   ``I once did an editorial about nude beaches and we filmed it at
a nude beach location with long-distance shots of nude bodies. It
was nothing salacious or anything,' recalled former KNBC editorial
director Jim Foy.
   Emerson was responsible for reviewing the tape for broadcast,
Foy said.
   ``He had it reviewed, he said, by his dog. The dog said it was
all right, so we put it on the air _ and nobody complained. We did
not get one call on it,'' Foy said.

   British Airways says it is resuming flights to
Iran and Iraq this winter because of the cease-fire in the gulf war.
   Flights to the Iraqi capital of Baghdad, suspended in the spring
of 1987, will resume once a week via Cairo, Egypt, on Nov. 2, the
airline said Tuesday.
   A twice-weekly service to Tehran with a stopover in Cyprus will
begin again after a three-year break on Dec. 15, it said.
   The carrier said the services were expected to be used mainly by
business travelers.
   After a series of battlefield defeats, Tehran accepted a
cease-fire in the nearly eight-year-long gulf war on July 18.

   Pro-Palestinian and Israeli forces are
clashing in this highbrow academic enclave over ballot questions
addressing the turbulent politics of the occupied West Bank.
   The Cambridge referendum calls for support in ``demanding that
Israel end its violations of Palestinian human rights and its
occupation of the West Bank and Gaza.'' The referendum also calls
for cutting off ``U.S. taxpayers' money for Israel's occupation of
the West Bank and Gaza,'' and for creating an independent
Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza, ``with peace for all
states in the region, including Israel.''
   Cambridge, home to Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, is a frequent forum for vigorous political debate. The
city, with a population of 90,000 people, also has many
working-class neighborhoods, and members of Jewish organizations
said they expected the majority of voters would not support the
referendum.
   Similar questions are on ballots in San Francisco and Berkeley,
Calif.
   ``Only Cambridge and Berkeley would have the chutzpah to think
that they can determine national and international policy by a
local ballot on as complicated an issue,'' said Harvard Law School
Professor Alan Dershowitz.
   ``Clearly it is simply designed as a strident anti-Israel,
unbalanced message,'' he said.
   But supporters say they are providing an outlet for what they
perceive as a growing disenchantment with U.S. policy in the Middle
East, stoked by the recent uprisings on the West Bank.
   ``We feel the status quo simply is intolerable,'' said Matthew
Gordon, spokesman for the Coalition for Palestinian Rights, which
gathered signatures to put the questions on the ballot.
   Gordon said his group opposes Israeli policies, not Israel, and
realizes ``you can't tackle the entire problem in just one
referendum.''
   ``We don't hope ourselves to change it, (U.S. policy) but we
feel that we're part of a movement,'' he said.
   Diane Steinman, New England director of the American Jewish
Committee, said the national office of the organization is opposing
the referendum in Cambridge and also a separate ballot question in
Newton, just across the Charles River.
   The Newton question asks voters to support creation of a
separate Palestinian state in the occupied territories and
``security for Israel and the Palestinian state.''
   ``We believe in general that ballot referenda like these are not
an effective mechanism for addressing the complexity of the issues
in the Middle East,'' Steinman said.
   In Newton, which has a substantial Jewish-American population
among its 82,000 residents, the National Committee for Arab and
Israeli Peace is preparing for a different campaign. Andrea Barron,
chairwoman of the organization, said the commitee is not related to
the Cambridge group.
   ``We deliberately chose Newton because an increasing number of
Jewish-Americans are willing to support a Palestinian state,'' said
Barron, noting that she is Jewish.
   Opponents and proponents said they intend to wage a full-fledged
campaign on the referendums.
   ``I think it's a serious issue,'' Dershowitz said. ``If only a
few people show up (and) vote on this ballot, you can always get a
``Yes'' pushed through.''
   Gordon said the coalition is distributing fliers, mailing out
letters and has so far raised at least $2,000.
   The Jewish Community Relations Council, which includes 34
organizations, plans to stay within a modest budget in its
opposition campaign, details of which are still being discussed,
said group President Joel Reck.
   ``We intend to coordinate efforts to defeat these referenda
which we consider inimicable to the peace process,'' he said.
   ``No one, least of all Israel, likes the present situation of
occupied territories,'' Reck said. ``The question is how do we
support Israel and be supportive of Israel and having referenda on
what Israel ought to do is an absurd and inappropriate way to
address what are the very serious problems in the Middle East.''

   Emperor Hirohito, placed under intensive care after
repeatedly vomiting blood, was in stable condition Wednesday
morning and appeared to be improving, officials said.
   The 87-year-old leader, the world's longest-reigning monarch,
was ``headed in a favorable direction,'' the Imperial Household
Agency said.
   Takenori Sugawara, an imperial household spokesman, said
Hirohito was still receiving intravenous care but was fully
conscious after a sound sleep overnight.
   Quoting Iwao Miyao, vice grand steward of the Imperial Household
Agency, Sugawara said the emperor's condition appeared to be
improving and palace doctors were not planning any further blood
transfusions.
   Miyao, in a briefing to palace reporters, said that as of 9 a.m.
Wednesday (8 p.m. EDT Tuesday) the emperor's temperature was 98.6
degrees, slightly above the 98.4 degrees of the previous night,
according to Sugawara.
   The Tokyo Stock Exchange dropped more than 250 points in
Wednesday's morning session as concern continued over the emperor's
condition.
   Imperial Household Agency officials said doctors gave the
emperor three blood transfusions Tuesday after he began vomiting
blood Monday evening. The vomiting continued through the night, but
stopped Tuesday morning, they said.
   Word of Hirohito's deteriorating health shocked many Japanese,
who remember the emperor's past robust health and active life.
   In recent years, Japan's mass media have often avoided making
negative comments about the emperor's growing frailty. But, in a
typical newspaper report Wednesday morning, the nationally
circulated Asahi Shimbun said in a headline, ``Seriousness of
Emperor's Condition Deepens.''
   Television stations also stayed on the air late at night to
carry updates on the emperor's health.
   People passing by the Imperial Palace in central Tokyo paused
Tuesday in the rain to bow and pray for Hirohito's health.
   Throughout the day, imperial family members and government
officials visited the palace to wish Hirohito good health. Most
left without seeing the emperor personally, but Crown Prince
Akihito and Crown Princess Michiko said he greeted them with a
strong ``Thank you for visiting me.''
   Japan's Cabinet was expected at its next meeting Thursday to
shift Hirohito's state responsibilities to Akihito, 54, heir to the
throne.
   Among those paying respects were Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita
and U.S. Ambassador Mike Mansfield, 85, who had a coronary bypass
operation in January.
   About 100 reporters remained camped outside the palace late
Tuesday night, watching for any activity in the emperor's
second-floor bedroom or any sudden arrivals of officials.
   News reports said former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone,
traveling in Britain, ended his trip early to return to Japan.
   Imperial Household Agency officials said doctors suspected there
was bleeding in the emperor's intestine near the site of an
intestinal bypass performed last September. In that procedure,
doctors circumvented an intestinal blockage caused by an enlarged
pancreas.
   Three times in recent weeks, the emperor has been bedridden with
a fever. After a fever earlier this month, Hirohito took the
unusual step of calling reporters together to tell them he was
feeling fine and not to worry.
   A news report last week said he had lost 20 pounds of the 130
pounds he carried before his surgery.
   In a briefing Tuesday night for Japanese reporters, Iwao Miyao,
vice grand steward of the Imperial Household Agency, said doctors
gave Hirohito three transfusions, one of 1.6 pints of blood and two
of 0.4 pints.
   An agency official quoted Miyao as saying in the briefing, ``I
don't think the emperor's condition is becoming worse, but rather
that it is stabilizing.''
   Miyao said the emperor was continuing to receive intravenous
feeding and was unable to eat.
   Hirohito has occupied Japan's Chrysanthemum Throne since 1926.
For the first 20 years of his reign, he was considered a ``living
god'' and a direct decendant of Amaterasu, the sun goddess.
   But after World War II, U.S. occupation officials forced him to
renounce his divinity. Under Japan's postwar constitution, he
became a symbol of Japan's unity but with no real power.
   It was a choice that enabled Hirohito to remain as symbolic head
of Japan and assured that he would not face charges as a war
criminal.It also was an act that seemed to relieve no one as much
as this gentle, shy and retiring man who was more comfortable
working as a marine biologist that playing the role of a ``living
god.''
   Indeed, the emperor was a widely respected authority on marine
biology, having written or co-authored at least 12 books on
hydrozoa, or sea animals, his specialty.
   Many older Japanese still feel deep affection for Hirohito, but
younger people tend to have less interest in the imperial family.
   Still, Hirohito and the imperial system remain important to
Japan.
   The Japanese measure years according to the reign of their
regent _ 1988 in Japanese is referred to as Showa 63.
   And a nationwide survey by the daily newspaper Mainichi Shimbun
in March 1987 showed more than 80 percent of 2,184 people polled
supported the imperial system, while only 11 percent said it should
be abolished. Five percent said the emperor should have more power.
   Opposition comes mostly from leftists who link the emperor with
past militarism. Hirohito's death would plunge Japan into a period
of official mourning which could last up to two years and involve
dozens of elaborate ceremonies and religious rites.

   A spat is turning nasty on a tree-lined
street in this affluent Chicago suburb, where television commercial
crews at Ken Kessler's house are keeping neighbors awake with
late-night shoots.
   Kessler's next-door neighbors on Forest Avenue complain the
crews are too noisy, block their driveways with trucks and vans,
and have shooting sessions as late as 11 p.m.
   Kessler said Tuesday he believes his neighbors are just miffed
because their homes aren't being used as sets for TV commercials.
   ``To me it's pure and simple _ a problem of money and
jealousy,'' says the 45-year-old institutional stockbroker, who
rents his home to film crews for between $300 and $1,000 a day.
   ``Somehow I think it grates them that someone next door is
making money off their house. Really, I think that's the bottom
line,'' Kessler said.
   ``That's ludicrous,'' retorted Robert Fisher, who lives next
door and wants the city to restrict the Kesslers to just one
commercial a year at their home.
   ``After the second time I complained, the next day I got a call
from an agent saying, `Hey, do you want to use your house for a
commercial?'
   ``I said, `Absolutely not!' I have a beautiful home. I don't
want people tramping all through it. ...I bought my house to live
in _ not to use it as a filming location,'' said Fisher, 40, a
group controller for Zenith Electronics.
   The dispute in this suburb north of Chicago along Lake Michigan
has been brewing since Kessler and his wife, Ann, began renting
their three-story, 12-room home to film crews about three years ago.
   Their home has appeared since in commercials for McDonald's,
Illinois Bell, Kraft and Allstate and in an hourlong made-for-TV
film called, ``Thinking Big.''
   Fisher and Bob Bonges, who lives on the other side of the
Kesslers, have lobbied the Evanston City Council to enact an
ordinance restricting commercial filming.
   Fisher contends Kessler is violating zoning laws by operating a
commercial enterprise in his home.
   Kessler disagrees, saying he doesn't employ anyone.
   A council committee decided last week the dispute was too
limited to warrant a citywide law. But City Manager Joel Asprooth
took administrative steps to restrict film shootings to three per
year at the Kesslers.
   In the meantime, Kessler said he has asked the Neighborhood
Justice Center, an agency that mediates such spats, to try to
resolve the fight.
   ``We feel we're just defending our right to do in our house what
we want to,'' he said.
   Fisher said Kessler rejected his appeal to work out a neighborly
compromise and now he's not optimistic for an amicable resolution.
   ``We really don't speak to them. We don't like what they're
doing and they won't cut it out,'' he said.

<HEAD>New General Assembly President Says Third World Debt Must Be
Tackled</HEAD>

   Argentina's Dante Captuo, the new General
Assembly president, wasted no time in telling the 159-nation body
it must close the economic gulf between rich and poor nations.
   As the Argentine foreign minister took the gavel after his
election Tuesday, he noted ``the remarkable difference between all
the progress made toward ensuring world peace, and the little or
nothing we have done to prevent the widening of the gap between
rich countries and a large part of the developing world.''
   Caputo, a 47-year-old former political science professor,
defeated the only other candidate for the presidency of the
159-member General Assembly, Barbados' U.N. Ambassador Dame Nita
Barrow, by 91-66, with one abstention during a single secret ballot.
   The election, the first order of business in the assembly's 43rd
session, was portrayed as a showdown between Britain, which backed
Mrs. Barrow, and Argentina, its defeated foe in the 1982 Falklands
War.
   Caputo won the presidency with strong support from the Soviet
bloc, the developing world, Japan, and the non-aligned movement,
including India and Pakistan, said diplomats and observers.
   Dame Nita also was backed by the Caribbean nations and numerous
Commonwealth countries. The United States was believed to have
voted for her, said observers.
   Although the presidency is largely ceremonial, it has the power
to set the tone of debate. Caputo took advantage of that provision
in his opening speech, in which he said the world body has been
remiss in redressing economic imbalances.
   ``One of the clearest examples of this impotence is probably the
question of the external (foreign) debt of the developing
countries,'' he said.
   ``These very high interest rates, together with the pitiless
system of successive refinancing plans and the perverse outflow of
financial resources of the indebted countries to the creditors,
will end up eliminating the possibilities of investment for the
developing world,'' he said.
   Caputo helped bring Argentina out of the international isolation
it suffered under a series of military juntas from 1976-1983, and
his speech reflected his alliance with the developing world.
   As assembly president, Caputo can cut short speeches and arrange
their order, and has important informal powers to set up backstage
meetings and compromises among delegates.He replaces outgoing
president Peter Florin of East Germany.
   In his speech, Caputo cited recent U.N. strides in addressing
regional conflicts, including the Iran-Iraq truce, the Afghan
accords, a settlement in the Western Sahara, and promoting dialogue
between Cypriot factions and warring Cambodian parties.
   But he added: ``The situation in Central America appears as a
particularly painful contrast within the pattern of evolution of
regional conflicts.''
   He also hailed the U.S.-Soviet arms agreement to destroy all
intermediate nuclear missiles and called for the implementation of
U.N. resolutions that would grant a Palestinian homeland and
guarantee Israel's right to exist in peace with its Arab neighbors.
   He singled out South Africa's ``infamous practice of apartheid''
as an intransigent problem that ``constitutes a true affront to the
moral conscience of mankind.''
   For the second year in a row, Secretary-General Javier Perez de
Cuellar missed the session's start. He left Tuesday for a trip to
South Africa _ his first in five years _ for talks on a regional
peace settlement. Last year, he was holding talks on ending the
Iran-Iraq war.
   The assembly begins its three-week General Debate on Monday when
President Reagan addresses the body.

   The new General Assembly president,
Foreign Minister Dante Caputo of Argentina, has a reputation as a
canny and ambitious diplomat with empathy for the Third World.
   The U.S.-educated envoy has become known for bringing Argentina
back into world diplomacy and out of its pariah status under
military juntas that ruled from 1976-83.
   Caputo, 47, is a former professor of political science who was
virtually unknown before President Raul Alfonsin, elected in
October 1983, named him foreign minister. He had supported Alfonsin
in a magazine he edited until 1983.
   As Alfonsin promoted democracy and human rights at home, Caputo
promoted Argentina's image as a liberal, independent, activist
Latin American nation.
   Alfonsin and Caputo resolved a century-old dispute with Chile
over the Beagle Channel in 1985. Six years earlier, the neighboring
countries almost went to war over the three uninhabited islands in
the South Atlantic.
   Argentina has cut its military spending deeply. It joined one
group that demands international nuclear disarmament and a second
group that is promoting a peaceful political solution to the wars
in Central America.
   Under Caputo, Argentina has become active in the non-aligned
movement, denouncing apartheid in South Africa, criticizing Britain
for staying in Northern Ireland, and supporting Palestinians in
their quest for a homeland.
   Argentina broke diplomatic relations with South Africa in 1986.
   In his own country, Caputo inspires strong reactions.
   University students, the opposition Peronist Party and leftist
elements in his own Radical Civic Union party enthusiastically
support him. The right despises him, seeng him as an opportunist
using the General Assembly presidency as a stepping stone to
Argentina's presidency.
   Caputo offered himself as a presidential candidate for the
Radical Civic Union in 1983, but Alfonsin won the nomination.
   Caputo has shown himself to be a shrewd survivor in domestic
politics; he is the only remaining member of Alfonsin's original
Cabinet.
   He speaks French, English and Spanish, and studied international
relations at Harvard and Tufts in the Boston area, where he met his
French-born wife.
   Caputo earned a degree in political science from the University
of El Salvador in Buenos Aires and a doctorate in that field at the
University of Paris.

   Human rights will get high priority when
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze meets Thursday and
Friday with Secretary of State George Shultz, a State Department
official told a congressional panel Tuesday.
   But little hope remains for finalizing the planned superpower
treaty cutting stocks of long-range nuclear ballistic missiles by
50 percent, Assistant Secretary of State Rozanne Ridgway told the
House Foreign Affairs subcommittee on European and Middle Eastern
affairs.
   Shevardnadze is to arrive Wednesday for his 28th meeting with
Shultz.
   ``We will press the Soviets to clear the books of the remaining
human rights cases,'' Ms. Ridgway said. Among the U.S. concerns to
be addressed, she said, are exit permission for members of divided
families, separated spouses, dual nationals and persons punished
for religious activity, including people jailed for trying to
monitor human rights under the Helsinki process.
   ``We will push on emigration'' and positive progress would
improve the prospects for concluding the review meeting at Vienna,
she said. ``We will also underscore the importance of the Soviets
pressing on with legal and other changes affecting the human rights
environment in the Soviet Union.''
   Ms. Ridgway said Shultz hopes ``to tie down'' with the Soviet
foreign minister some of the complicated, unresolved issues in the
ongoing U.S.-Soviet negotiations on the START, or strategic
long-range arms treaty.
   It is also hoped that Shultz and Shevardnadze will ``give a
push'' to agreement on verification procedures for the unratified
peaceful nuclear explosion and threshhold test ban treaties of the
1970s, she said.
   If that happens, the Reagan administration would submit the
pacts to the Senate ``for ratification early in the next
Congress,'' she said.
   Ms. Ridgway said the get together is the 28th for Shultz and
Shevardnadze.
   ``It may be their last (meeting) in Washington, but is not
expected to be their last meeting,'' she said, mentioning the U.N.
General Assembly both will attend next week in New York.
   Other occasions could follow, she said, noting that prospects
for East-West agreement at the current Vienna review of the 1975
Helsinki conference ``may fall into place'' later this year.

   The U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency on Sunday plans to blow up a mystery container it believes
contains cyanide if it can evacuate enough houses around a plant in
Nitro, officials said late Tuesday.
   ``They plan to explode and burn a 30-pound container of what may
be filled with hydrogen cyanide. They don't know if it's full,
empty, partly full or unstable. If there's a problem it would
spread up to 3,000 feet,'' said Nitro Mayor Don Karnes.
   Karnes said he was skeptical that there was much danger, but
said he would recommend residents heed the government agency's call
for a voluntary evacuation around the closed Artel Chemical Co.
   Nitro, with about 8,000 residents, is about 12 miles west of
Charleston.
   ``I'd rather err on the side of safety,'' he said.
   Hydrogen cyanide is poisonous and can be fatal if inhaled or
absorbed directly, but it can be burned and its vapors contained.
   Federal officials took over the chemical plant after a roof
collapsed on already leaking drums whose contents were not all
identified.
   The EPA in July said the Artel site was a ``potential
emergency'' and a spokesman initially said that dangerous
substances such as methyl mercaptan, a chemical mixed in with
natural gas to give it an odor, stored at the plant could explode
at any time. Officials later played down any danger.
   A third EPA emergency town meeting is scheduled for Thursday
evening at Nitro Junior High School, 500 yards from the Artel plant.
   ``That tells me it's probably not all that dangerous. If it
were, they would have their meeting in Beckley or Parkersburg,''
Karnes said.
   Meanwhile, area schools are to conduct a practice evacuation
Wednesday morning.
   Three schools in Kanawha County and one in Putnam County are to
participate in the drill, officials said.
   County school officials said 28 buses would be sent to the
schools to determine how long it would take to get students out of
the area in the event there would be an explosion at the Artel site.

<HEAD>House Passes Railroad Drug Testing Bill, But Senate Prospects
Gloomy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An election-year bill requiring random drug
and alcohol testing for railroad workers seems to be headed for a
roadblock in the Senate, even though it has breezed through the
House.
   The chairman of the Senate committee that oversees the
transportation industry made that clear Tuesday, shortly after the
House approved the testing legislation on an unopposed voice vote.
   A spokesman for Senate Commerce Committee chairman Sen. Ernest
Hollings, D-S.C., said Hollings prefers a Senate version of the
bill that would also extend a wide-ranging testing program to
airline and trucking industry workers.
   Spokesman Emilio Pardo said Hollings would block the legislation
unless he was able to expand it ``to get all three modes
protected'' _ railroads, trucking and airlines.
   Time is also working against the drug-testing bill. The
congressional leadership is hoping lawmakers can adjourn for the
year by mid-October.
   Congress began working on drug testing legislation shortly after
the Jan. 4, 1987, collision between a loaded Amtrak passenger train
and three-linked Conrail engines in Chase, Md. After the disaster _
in which 16 people were killed and 175 injured _ two Conrail
crewmen admitted they had been smoking marijuana shortly before
their train ran through stop signals and into the path of the
Amtrak train.
   The legislation was held up for months because rail unions and
their supporters in Congress argued that the tests could be
inaccurate, might be used to harass workers and would be an
invasion of privacy.
   Labor leaders finally dropped their opposition this summer,
saying they were satisfied with provisions designed to protect
workers from erroneous laboratory results.
   ``This bill will make sure we don't have another Chase crash,''
the bill's sponsor, Rep. Thomas A. Luken, D-Ohio, said after the
vote.
   Another sponsor, Rep. Bob Whittaker, R-Kan., called the measure
a ``comprehensive, preventive and humane program.''
   Supporters say random testing would deter the consumption of
alcohol and illegal drugs by rail employees. The bill also would
require testing after accidents, for reasonable cause, before
hiring and as a part of annual physical examinations.
   Workers who test positive would be suspended without pay. They
would have their jobs restored to them if they successfully
complete a rehabilitation program.
   Shortly before the House approved the drug testing bill, the
Senate Commerce Committee rejected legislation that would have made
it easier for shippers who believe the rates they are charged by
railroads are too high to appeal to the government for help.
   On a 10-9 vote, the panel rejected a bipartisan bill that would
have revised the 1980 Staggers Rail Act, which deregulated the
railroad industry. The committee's action effectively killed the
legislation until Congress returns next year.
   Large segments of the coal, agriculture, utilities, chemical and
other industries _ which often have no alternative to rail shipping
_ have been complaining since 1980 that the Interstate Commerce
Commission has been doing little to protect shippers against
excessive prices charged by railroads.
   ``Captive shippers are being done wrong,'' said one of the
sponsors, Sen. John D. Rockefeller, D-W.Va., referring to
industries that must use railroads.
   Rockefeller's bill would have changed the complex formula the
ICC uses to decide whether rates are fair. In some cases, for
example, the burden of proof would be shifted to the railroads for
demonstrating that their rates are fair.
   Some opponents _ mainly Republicans _ argued that the ICC was
doing a good job of deciding rate cases, while others said the
legislation would be unlikely to be enacted this year because of
opposition in the House and by President Reagan.
   In other congressional action:
   _The Senate Commerce Committee approved a bill providing extra
federal aid to states that adopt several programs aimed at reducing
drunken driving. Among the initiatives the bill would encourage is
the immediate confiscation of a driver's license if he or she fails
a chemical test for intoxication, or refuses to take such a test.
   _The House voiced approval for legislation requiring the Federal
Aviation Administration to devote 15 percent of its research budget
to the study of airplane fire safety, aircraft maintenance, human
performance and the use of computer simulation models.
   _The House, also on a voice vote, directed the FAA to conduct
research on how new equipment has effected the performance of air
traffic controllers.

<HEAD>Educators Say Many Teachers Lack Understanding Of King</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Education leaders have held the first national
conference on how to improve teaching about the life of slain civil
rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr.
   Participants on Tuesday said many schools suffer from a lack of
teacher understanding about King's political and philosophical
record, as well as a shortage of course materials.
   ``You cannot simply go out and say `I'm going to teach about the
life of Dr. King' unless you know about his life, unless you
understand and have resources available,'' said Mary Futrell,
president of the National Education Association.
   Other speakers at the three-day conference conceded they did not
know enough about King and his campaign for non-violent social
change to instruct on the topic.
   ``One problem is that no one has ever been really taught about
King,'' said Gordon Ambach of the Council of Chief State School
Officers. ``That curriculum was certainly before my time.''
   Added Manya Ungar, president of the National Parents and
Teachers Association:
   ``You have to recognize that an association like mine is
predominantly white, Anglo-Saxon, Protestant, middle class and
suburban. The board members with which I deal with ... are not
reflective of the greater society _ particularly that portion of
society which increasingly has problems getting their voices heard
and their agenda addressed.''
   ``... Parents have got to educate themselves and find out who
Martin Luther King was,'' Ms. Unger said. She noted that her group
was in touch with other organizations, such as the Anti-Defamation
League, to help with producing literature by next June.
   ``We hope to have literature aimed at the parents _ talking
about how we either overtly or covertly teach prejudice, teach
racism or perpetuate this cycle of hatred and violence,'' she said.
   The Washington conference was sponsored by the Education
Committee of the Federal Holiday Commission and the Martin Luther
King, Jr., Center for Non-Violent Social Change.
   Futrell said she hoped the conference would be ``the first of
many'' to focus on the question of how to better prepare courses on
King and his accomplishments.

<TEXT>
   Plans to set an eight-year deadline for
finishing safety reviews of hundreds of pesticides sprayed on crops
are on their way to the Senate after gaining easy approval in the
House.
   ``Getting this bill to the president's desk is my top priority
as we wrap up this congressional session,'' E. ``Kika'' de la
Garza, D-Texas, chairman of the House Agriculture Committee, said
Tuesday as the House approved the measure on a voice vote.
   The Environmental Protection Agency would be required to
complete safety reviews of some 600 pesticides within eight years
under the bill. The research is designed to end use of the most
hazardous chemicals and limit use of others that present health
dangers.
   Not until the year 2024 would the agency finish the reviews at
the present pace, according to the General Accounting Office. Thus
far no deadline has been set for the research which began in the
mid-1970s.
   Business and government would share storage and disposal costs,
and a program under which the agency has paid $20 million to
manufacturers to buy up stocks of banned pesticides would be
largely ended under the three-year reauthorization of the Federal
Insecticide, Fungidice and Rodenticide Act.
   The Senate already has passed a similar bill and appeared likely
to act on the House version in the three to four weeks remaining
before lawmakers adjourn to campaign full time at home.
   Most envirionmentalists, however, are at most lukewarm to the
bill, a bare-bones measure without a number of provisions they
support, such as stepped up federal monitoring of groundwater,
which represents the basic drinking supply for millions of
Americans.
   Government research has shown some pesticides can lead to cancer
in laboratory animals and other severe health problems.
   Pesticides, an outgrowth of World War II chemical warfare
research, are now found in residue form in many fruits and
vegetables and even animal tissues that find their way onto the
American dinner table every day.
   Environmentalists have been campaigning with minimal success to
tighten pesticide regulation since 1962 when naturalist Rachel
Carson spotlighted the problem with her bestselling ``Silent
Spring.''
   Some environmentalists ripped into the House on Tuesday for
approving the three-year measure. They said it would take the issue
off the agenda without addressing some of the most serious problems.
   ``We're not willing to put pesticide regulation on the back
burner for three to four years,'' said Jay Feldman of the National
Coalition Against the Misuse of Pesticides. ``That's not any kind
of message to be sending out ... to people who are facing chemicals
in their drinking water, chemicals in their workplace and chemicals
in their food.''
   ``We think the bill is meaningless,'' said Dave Baker, political
director of the Friends of the Earth. He said the measure would
guarantee inaction until 1992.
   But Janet S. Hathaway, senior projects attorney of the Natural
Resources Defense Council, said the bill represents a plus for the
environmental cause because it guarantees that key issues such as
groundwater monitoring will have the spotlight to themselves next
year.
   De la Garza acknowledged that the measure did not go as far as
some would have liked.
   ``This is the art of the possible, this will not satisfy hardly
anyone but this is what we can do at this point,'' he said.
   Farmers have been highly suspicious of legislation they fear
would ban or raise the cost of pesticides, which are a fundamental
part of their business.

<HEAD>Report Says TWA Fares At Hub Airport Rose Faster After Merger</HEAD>

   A congressional study says Trans World
Airlines fares rose sharply at its St. Louis hub after it became
the airport's dominant carrier through a government-approved merger.
   The report on Tuesday by the General Accounting Office, the
investigative arm of Congress, found that TWA fares at St. Louis
increased more than twice the national average after the company's
1986 merger with Ozark Air Lines.
   In addition, the GAO said travelers from Lambert-St. Louis
International Airport had fewer choices of competing airlines to
many destinations after the merger.
   The report is expected to add new fuel to the debate over
deregulation and criticism that it has given airline industry
survivors near-monopoly powers, producing higher fares and
restricted service in some areas.
   Don Morrison, a spokesman for TWA in St. Louis, said he had not
seen a copy of the report and could not comment on its contents.
   Sen. John Danforth, R-Mo., who requested the study, said
lawmakers need to consider the possiblity of some type of air fare
regulation in light of the GAO findings.
   ``At a minimum, Congress should consider steps to foster
competition at concentrated airports, by removing obstacles to new
carriers and boosting airport expansion to make room for new
carriers,'' said Danforth.
   The Commerce Committee is to hold a hearing on Thursday on the
issue of airline concentration at hub airports, and Danforth vowed
to raise the subject of air fare regulation.
   TWA handled 56 percent of the passengers at the St. Louis
airport before the merger but that grew to 82 percent in 1987,
according to GAO. No other airline has more than 3 percent of the
airport market.
   After the merger, TWA provided service to more cities than it
and Ozark combined had served before the acquisition. However, GAO
said the total number of destinations for St. Louis travelers
dropped and more routes were served by single carriers after the
merger.
   The report found:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _TWA's average fares rose between 13 percent and 18 percent in
1987 for 67 non-stop routes served by TWA and Ozark at the time of
the merger. During that same period, the air fare portion of the
Consumer Price Index increased 5 percent to 6 percent nationally.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _TWA's average fares increased 13 percent to 19 percent on 53
non-stop routes from St. Louis in which it competed with other
airlines while the competitors raised their rates by no more 8
percent.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _Smaller increases for TWA's fares from Kansas City to those
same 53 cities than the company's flights out of its St. Louis hub.
Although TWA's Kansas City fares rose no more than 13 percent,
competitors generally had falling ticket prices during the period,
6 percent to 8 percent less.
   GAO said Kansas City was used for the comparison because ``TWA's
market share there was not affected appreciably by its acquisition
of Ozark'' and travel distances to the cities were similar to those
from St. Louis.
   TWA, according to the report, attributed the increases to
``unusually low fares'' in 1986, when it was engaged in a price
competition with Ozark and was trying to bounce back from an
employee strike. In addition, the company said rates rose last year
because it served more business travelers, who generally pay higher
fares.

<HEAD>Drought Slows Farmland Price Recovery, But Next Year Should Be
Better</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Although this year's drought apparently has
slowed the recovery in U.S. farmland prices, the Agriculture
Department says appraisers are optimistic for a healthy increase in
1989.
   Rural appraisers surveyed in August by the department's Economic
Research Service reported only a 1.2 percent increase nationally in
farmland values for May, June and July, compared with a 1.8 percent
gain in the first quarter of the year.
   ``While the appreciation rate for farmland could continue to
slow in coming months, the appraisers were more bullish for the
year ahead, expecting a 4.6 percent rise in values,'' the agency
said Tuesday. ``Last May, surveyed appraisers anticipated only a
3.6 percent gain for the coming year.''
   Farmland prices began rising in 1987, ending a six-year decline
that was part of the worst financial crunch in U.S. agriculture
since the Depression.
   One of the reasons for optimism about land prices is the
improvement in farm income the last year or so. In a related
report, the agency released new 1987 farm income statistics which
showed last year's state rankings for the first time. California,
as usual, headed the list.
   Nine of the top 10 states for net farm income in 1987 were there
in 1986, the Economic Research Service said. North Carolina
replaced Washington in 1987.
   The top 10 states accounted for 54 percent of total U.S. net
farm income in 1987, compared with 54.5 percent in 1986.
   The new preliminary state estimates for 1987 showed net farm
income nationally at $46.3 billion, up more than 23 percent from
calendar 1986.
   Economists said the largest percentage increases were in
Wyoming, South Carolina, Maine, Louisiana, Mississippi and Nevada.
   ``The Wyoming and Nevada gains were due largely to increased
value of livestock product marketings,'' the report said. Higher
cattle prices and livestock inventory reductions contributed.
   Improved farm income in South Carolina, Maine, Louisiana and
Mississippi resulted from increased production and higher prices
for tobacco, potatoes, cotton and cottonseed. Generally, production
increased from a relatively poor year in 1986.
   Net farm income is the difference between gross farm income and
total expenses during a calendar year and measures the profit or
loss associated with production in a given year.
   Additions to inventories are treated as income, and allowances
are made for ``non-money '' items such as depreciation, the
consumption of farm-grown food and the net rental value of
dwellings.
   The agency also uses a method of accounting for ``net cash
income,'' which is the difference between gross cash income and
cash expenses. Current sales from inventories produced in other
years are counted as gross income.
   Net cash income is often preferred by some economists since it
shows how much actual money farmers have to spend during a year. In
1987, net cash income was estimated at a record $57.1 billion,
compared with the net income of $46.3 billion.
   The USDA has forecast 1988 net farm income may be in the range
of $38 billion to $43 billion and that net cash income could be $55
billion to $60 billion.
   ``Net farm income is typically much more volatile than net cash
income because weather often causes sharp changes in production
that lead to swings in inventory values,'' the report said.
   Here are the leading states for net farm income as reported
Tuesday by the Agriculture Department, ranked in order for 1987,
with 1987 income in the first column and 1986 income in the second,
in millions of dollars:

<HEAD>Walsh Wants To Move CIA Agent's Iran-Contra Trial Out of
Washington</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prosecutors are seeking dismissal of charges
against former CIA agent Joseph Fernandez that he lied about his
role in the Iran-Contra arms and money affair so they can move his
trial out of Washington.
   Independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh filed the motion Tuesday
in response to the refusal by Fernandez to stand trial in the
nation's capital for offenses that allegedly occurred in Virginia.
   Walsh said he planned to seek to indict Fernandez in Alexandria,
Va., on all the charges against Fernandez, including the allegation
that he conspired to deliver arms illegally to the Nicaraguan
Contra rebels and later lied about the clandestine supply network.
   The indictment says the alleged conspiracy took place in
Washington and elsewhere.
   But Fernandez, the CIA's former station chief in Costa Rica,
also is accused of four counts of lying about the operation to his
superiors and the presidential commission headed by former Sen.
John Tower, R-Texas, that investigated the Iran-Contra affair.
Those offenses allegedly occurred in Langley, Va., at CIA
headquarters.
   Prosecutors asked U.S. District Judge Aubrey E. Robinson Jr. to
dismiss all five counts, saying that ``the interest of judicial
economy and fundamental fairness dictate that the case should not
be splintered into unwieldy separate proceedings.''
   ``Rather, the case should be dismissed as a whole; at that
point, the government will re-present the case to a grand jury in
the Eastern District of Virginia, a forum to which the defendant
has no colorable objection,'' prosecutors said in their brief.
   The indictment returned June 20 accused Fernandez, 51, of
conspiring in 1985 and 1986 with former National Security Council
aide Oliver L. North and arms dealer Richard V. Secord to ship arms
to the Contras.
   Fernandez, who operated in Central America under the CIA
pseudonym Tomas Castillo, was accused of overseeing the
construction of an airstrip in Costa Rica from which planes flew to
drop supplies to the Nicaraguan rebels.
   To obtain a new indictment from a federal grand jury in
Alexandria, prosecutors would be able to summarize their case and
present transcripts of the original grand jury testimony of
witnesses against Fernandez.

<HEAD>Senate Considering Citizen Financing Of Organ Transplants</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BARKER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A pioneering surgeon wants Congress to enact
legislation to spare families the pain of making emotional public
appeals for money to pay for organ transplants.
   Transplant surgeon Thomas E. Starzl joined the wife of a heart
transplant patient in testifying before a Senate Finance
subcommittee Tuesday on behalf of legislation to create a
taxpayer-financed fund for organ transplants.
   The trust fund would draw from a checkoff on federal tax
returns, enabling citizens to direct portions of their tax refund
to help needy patients in their state pay for operations to receive
new hearts, livers, kidneys or other organs.
   The idea, Starzl told the subcommittee on taxation, is to end
the need for families to ``go public'' as a last resort to saving
family members who will die without organ transplants.
   ``I can tell you from direct experience that these are desperate
ventures which take a frightful psychological toll on families and
patients,'' said Starzl, a professor of surgery at the University
of Pittsburgh who is regarded as the leader of the flourishing
transplant field.
   ``They are literally forced to advertise a dying child or adult
to the public in hopes that out of compassion, the public will
respond,'' he said.
   Rep. Doug Walgren, D-Pa., told the panel that patients' survival
``should not depend on their political connections, where they
live, or the generosity of their friends, family and neighbors.''
   In one well-publicized case, well-wishers from around the
country donated more than $350,000 and President Reagan pitched in
$1,000 to help pay the medical expenses of 3-year-old Tabatha
Foster. She died last May after undergoing a rare, five-organ
transplant.
   Sherry Clifton of Silver Spring, Md., told the panel she
contacted the United Way, the Red Cross, news organizations and
even Washington Redskins football players to try to raise $30,000
for a deposit on her 49-year-old husband's heart transplant in 1984.
   Finally, she said she called the White House and was directed to
a public liaison who was able to secure financing from the State of
Maryland and other sources to help pay hospital bills for Hardie
Clifton amounting to more than $200,000.
   The liaison, Michael Batten, was in the hearing room Tuesday and
said in an interview that Mrs. Clifton has not forgotten his
efforts. ``She sends me a Christmas card every year,'' said Batten,
now a private health consultant.
   But Mrs. Clifton said her husband received his new heart only
because ``I was strong enough to fight. Everyone does not have the
same strength.
   ``I cannot see how the leaders of our country can approve a
$500,000 renovation project to house two pandas and be willing to
allow human beings to die because there is no money available for
transplants,'' she said.
   In 1972, the government renovated a rhinoceros facility at the
National Zoo to accommodate pandas Ling-Ling and Hsing-Hsing, who
were gifts from China. Zoo spokesman Robert Hoage said he was not
certain the renovation amounted to $500,000, but that it probably
cost ``several hundred thousand'' dollars.
   Walgren is the author of the House bill, whose companion is
being sponsored by Sen. Dale Bumpers, D-Ark., in the Senate.
   The bill is needed because the financing of transplants is ``a
crazy quilt'' of insurance coverage, Bumpers said.
   Medicare pays for all kidney transplants, but the health
program's support for other transplants is limited, witnesses said.
Medicaid coverage varies widely from state to state.

<HEAD>Panel To Decide In January On Hastings Trial</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Senate panel says it will meet next January
to recommend whether a committee or the full Senate will hear
evidence in the impeachment trial of U.S. District Judge Alcee L.
Hastings of Miami.
   In a report approved 9-0 Tuesday, the Senate Rules Committee
said the chamber ``has clear authority'' to appoint an impeachment
committee for the second time in the nation's history, and to
continue proceedings that began this year into the next Congress.
   The report, which went to the Senate leadership, said the Rules
panel would conduct a hearing the week of Jan. 23 and issue a
report the following week on whether the committee approach was
proper for the Hastings case.
   Hastings wants the full Senate to hear testimony on allegations
that he conspired with a Washington, D.C., attorney to arrange a
bribe from two racketeers.
   ``If only 12 senators were receiving the testimony, by
definition, 88 would be unmindful of what transpired,'' Hastings
said after the report was issued. ``I don't want my trial decided
at the Press Club or the George Washington Hotel. I want them all
there seeing it and judging it for themselves.''
   Hastings said the decision to defer his trial, which he
estimated would last 21 days, until next year showed how little
appetite Congress has for impeachments.
   ``The bottom line is political. Everybody knows that the
business of the Senate is complex and sizable, and that impeachment
is not political fun,'' said Hastings.
   ``My case is a classic test case to let the American people know
that a constitutional amendment needs to be circulated to determine
if judicial accountability should be handled by something other
than Congress,'' he said.
   The House, in an action tantamount to an indictment, voted 413-3
to approve 17 articles of impeachment on Aug. 3. The case then went
to the Senate for trial, where conviction by a two-thirds majority
would remove Hastings from his lifetime job that now pays
$89,500-a-year.
   The main impeachment article accuses Hastings of conspiring with
Washington attorney William Borders in 1981 to obtain a $150,000
payment from two convicted racketeers in exchange for lenient
sentencing and return of forfeited assets.
   The Rules panel said, ``There are numerous impeachment cases in
which Congress carried over proceedings from one Congress to the
next, most involving cases in which the House continued its
inquiries from Congress to Congress,'' the Rules Committee said.
   ``In two cases ... Senate proceedings were continued from one
Congress to the next.''
   The full Senate sat as an impeachment jury and as judges for all
impeachment cases until the trial of former U.S. District Judge
Harry E. Claiborne in 1986.
   In Claiborne's case, a 12-member committee heard testimony for
seven days in September 1986 before the full Senate convened as a
jury in October and convicted the then-Las Vegas, Nev., judge.
   Hastings is the first U.S. government official to face
impeachment after winning acquittal in a criminal trial based on
the same charges. He also is the first black to go through the
impeachment process in which Congress determines whether an
official should be removed from office.
   Hastings' lawyer, Terence J. Anderson, has filed legal papers
that agree with the committee's recommendation to hold the
proceedings next year.
   The Rules Committee also recommended that House managers of the
case, who function as prosecutors, and Hastings be prepared to
proceed with witnesses by March 1.

<HEAD>Burger Chain's History Campaign Goofs on Presidents</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Patrons reading Burger King's paper tray liners are
finding the fast-food chain has served up U.S. history its way _
but not necessarily the right way.
   Promotional material for the Miami-based company's ``Education
Enriches Everyone'' campaign incorrectly credits Thomas Jefferson
with writing the U.S. Constitution. It also lists the wrong birth
year for President Lyndon Johnson _ 1903 instead of 1908.
   The information was published on millions of tray liners and is
part of a promotion that includes bookmarks and about 35,000
posters to be mailed to classrooms across the nation.
   According to the tray liners, ``before Thomas Jefferson could
pen our Constitution, he was schooled in history.''
   Actually, Jefferson didn't even attend the Constitutional
Convention. He did, however, write the Declaration of Independence,
and initially objected to the Constitution's lack of protection for
human rights.
   When the misinformation was brought to Burger King's attention
Monday, company officials conferred with The Block Group of New
York, the public relations firm that created the promotional
material.
   Barbara Gothard, the Burger King executive in charge of the
campaign, called Johnson's birth date ``a genuine typographical
error'' but held fast to the notion that Jefferson did ``pen'' the
Constitution.
   ``Our research shows us that in 1787, Madison actually sent a
copy of the Constitution to Jefferson in France, so that in a sense
Jefferson penned the Constitution,'' said Ms. Gothard, who, as
director of corporate affairs, was among the last to review the
advertising material before publication.
   Use of the term ``pen'' is a ``play on words,'' Ms. Gothard said.
   Ms. Gothard said Burger King will contact store managers
regarding Johnson's incorrect birth date, but will leave the
Constitution among Jefferson's credits.

<HEAD>US Praises Iraqi Pledge on Chemical Weapons</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Department is praising as a
``positive step'' an Iraqi pledge that appears to rule out future
use of chemical weapons either against foreign adversaries or the
country's rebellious Kurdish minority population.
   U.S. officials expressed hope Tuesday that the promise, made by
Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz, will head off the possibility of
congressional approval of economic sanctions against Iraq.
   Following what the State Department said was convincing evidence
that Iraq had used chemical weapons against its Kurdish population,
the Senate two weeks ago approved comprehensive sanctions against
Iraq, including a ban on agricultural and export credits.
   The State Department called the Senate action premature and
pressured Iraq to issue a firm statement declaring that it would no
longer engage in chemical warfare.
   Officials complained that the legislation could hurt American
exporters more than the Iraqis and said it was taken up without
prior consultation with the executive branch.
   Aziz's statement asserted that Iraq ``respects and abides by all
the provisions of international law'' concerning use of chemical
weapons, State Department spokesman Charles Redman said.
   The House Foreign Affairs Committee is expected to take up Iraqi
sanctions legislation on Thursday. It is not clear what impact
Aziz's statement will have on committee members.
   ``This is a positive step,'' Redman said. ``We take it to mean
that Iraq forswears the use of chemical weapons in internal as well
as international conflict. We will be watching closely to see that
this commitment is carried out.''
   On Sept. 8, Secretary of State George P. Shultz accused Iraq of
``unjustifiable and abhorrent'' behavior in using chemical weapons
against its Kurdish minority.
   Iraq has denied the U.S. charges, calling them ``absolutely
baseless'' but American officials contend that chemical warfare
contributed to the exodus of tens of thousands of Kurds from Iraq
to Turkey.
   Redman said the Iraqi statement referred to the 1925 Geneva
protocol barring chemical weapons use in international conflicts
and to other agreements that carry the weight of international law.
   He indicated that Iraqi use of chemical weapons against the
Kurds would not violate the Geneva agreement because of the
domestic nature of that conflict.
   He said use of chemical weapons during a civil conflict is
barred by a 1949 protocol that deals with war victims, and Aziz's
statement appeared to cover that agreement.
   Aziz said on Monday he would not agree to hold peace talks with
Iran in New York because ``I can't go to a town where there is a
campaign against the Arabs,'' an apparent reference to U.S.
hostility against his country.
   He agreed to one face-to-face meeting with Iran's foreign
minister in New York in early October but he ruled out additional
discussions there ``for political, security and practical reasons.''

   Six international treaties designed to help
U.S. investigators prosecute drug traffickers are being blocked by
Republican senators despite administration support, the Democratic
chairman of a Senate narcotics subcommittee charged.
   ``You don't fight a war on drugs by depriving the soldiers of
the weapons they need to fight the war. There's a lot of rhetoric
and not a lot of action,'' said Sen. John F. Kerry, chairman of the
Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee on terrorism, narcotics and
international communications.
   But the Massachusetts Democrat on Tuesday refused to identify
the Republicans he believes have held up the mutual legal
assistance treaties, saying only that they ``know who they are.''
   Deborah DeMoss, a Republican aide on the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, called the Democrat's charge ``absolutely
false'' and ``a fantasy.''
   She said Sen. Jesse Helms of North Carolina, the top committee
Republican, has concerns about the pacts and plans to offer
amendments, but said that he has been prepared to discuss the
proposals all along. Ms. DeMoss said only Kerry and Helms have
shown interest in the treaties, and she blamed the delay in action
on a general lack of interest by other senators on both sides of
the aisle.
   A committee vote on ratification of the six treaties is
scheduled for Thursday.
   The treaties are with the Bahamas, Mexico, the Cayman Islands,
Thailand, Belgium and Canada.
   Under the agreements, the United States would receive
information such as bank documents, criminal records and
depositions directly from those nations, making it easier for
investigators to follow money-laundering paper trails.
   Ms. DeMoss said Helms is worried that nations such as the
Bahamas, which has had political figures linked to drug
trafficking, cannot be trusted with information provided by the
United States. She declined to provided specifics about his planned
amendments.
   Kerry said he too is skeptical about the Bahamas and other
nations, but said the treaties are needed to see if they have
changed and are willing to cooperate.
   ``I don't think this nation can be critical of the governments
of other countries ... for their lack of cooperation when we turn
around and refuse to cooperate,'' he said at a Capitol news
conference.

<HEAD>Congress Readying Final Action On Energy Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID GOELLER</BYLINE>

   Congress is nearing final action on a plan
designed to reduce U.S. dependence on foreign oil, foster a cleaner
environment and cause motorists to say fill-er-up _ with corn, coal
or natural gas.
   By a voice vote, the Senate on Tuesday gave its blessing to
legislation its 64 co-sponsors hope will promote commercial
development and production of cars, trucks and buses that run on
alternative fuels.
   The vote, capping four years of hearings and negotiations, left
the alternative fuels proposal, a blending of similar House and
Senate bills, just a perfunctory House vote away from going to
President Reagan's desk.
   The bill, sponsored principally on the Senate side by Jay
Rockefeller, D-W.Va., seeks to spur the wide commercial development
of cars, trucks and buses that can operate on such fuels as
methanol, ethanol and natural gas.
   ``This is a landmark piece of legislation and represents the
first major step toward a national energy policy in nearly a
decade,'' Rockefeller said. ``This legislation increases energy
security options and provides for a cleaner environment.''
   The bill provides that for each alternative-fuel car produced
and sold, the manufacturer would get large credits that would make
it easier to meet the government's minimum fuel economy
requirements for the manufacturer's entire fleet.
   As a further incentive, the Department of Energy would be
authorized to begin spending $18 million in late 1989 to buy and
test alternative fuel cars, trucks and buses offered by
manufacturers.
   Backers say that widespread use of alternative fuels would not
only help combat urban air pollution but also aid in the
still-infant response to the so-called greenhouse effect, or the
warming of the Earth's climate.
   Supporters say the United States has abundant supplies of
natural gas, the coal that is used to produce methanol and the
grains that are the roots of ethanol.
   Currently, methanol and ethanol are available as fuels in some
parts of the country, but most vehicles experience problems if more
than 5 percent to 10 percent is blended into gasoline.
   All three alternative fuels produce less of the carbon and other
greenhouse pollutants that scientists say are collecting in the
atmosphere and trapping heat from the sun.
   Sen. Jack Danforth, R-Mo., who introduced similar legislation in
1984 and cosponsored Rockefeller's bill, said that ``the
legislation is a grand slam for energy independence...''
   ``Increased use of alternative fuels will reduce our dangerous
dependence on foreign oil,'' he said. ``Alternative fuels will help
clean up our environment by reducing harmful auto emissions.''

<HEAD>Panel Looking at Social Security, Military Cuts To Balance Budget</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Out of the glare of the presidential campaign,
a bipartisan commission is quietly crafting a proposed solution to
the federal budget deficit that would include cuts in Social
Security and defense spending as well as possible increases in
consumption taxes.
   That is the word from Democrat Robert Strauss, who is
co-chairman of the 12-member commission along with Republican Drew
Lewis.
   Strauss provided a tantalizing glimpse Tuesday of what options
the panel is considering recommending to the new president. The
panel, concerned about becoming embroiled in the presidential
campaign, has purposely kept out of the public eye since July.
   Strauss indicated that work has been going on behind the scenes
and he said the commission will resume holding public hearings
immediately after the Nov. 8 election. The commission would like to
finish its work by Dec. 21.
   The commission, which is split evenly between Democrats and
Republicans, was created by Congress last year in an attempt to
break the impasse between President Reagan's refusal to increase
taxes and the refusal of the Democratic-controlled Congress to cut
government spending enough to bring the deficit under control.
   Strauss said the group probably will recommend a four- or
five-year plan to eliminate the deficit, which this year is
expected to total about $152 billion.
   Social Security benefits, Medicare and other entitlement
programs and defense spending will have to be cut, Strauss said,
since they account for 68 percent of total spending.
   Strauss said the commission was aware of the political firestorm
likely to be triggered by such suggestions.
   ``That means you are withholding money from the sick, the
elderly and the defense of the nation,'' he said.
   Strauss said top priority will be given to spending cuts and
only after they are exhausted would the commission look at possible
tax increases as a way of balancing the budget.
   His comments marked the most detailed discussion yet of where
the commission is headed. The panel has been criticized for not
holding public meetings in the past several months, opting instead
to hold informal discussions with less than a quorum present in
order to avoid requirements of the Government in the Sunshine Law.
   But Strauss defended this approach, saying the commission's
chances of success would be doomed if the presidential candidates
were forced to take a stand now on every proposal the panel was
considering.
   Democrat Michael Dukakis has indicated a willingness to listen
to the group's recommendations, but Republican George Bush has
vowed to ignore any calls for a tax increase.
   On the revenue side, Strauss said the commission was examining
boosting so-called sin taxes such as federal levies on cigarettes
and alcohol. Strauss said that other types of consumption taxes
also would be considered.
   While Strauss did not talk about gasoline taxes in his
presentation, there have been published reports that a hike in the
gasoline tax of up to 50 cents is among the tax options the
commission is studying.
   Strauss said the panel probably will make some recommendations
on reforming the budget process, examining such issues as two-year
instead of annual budgets and a presidential line item veto.
   Strauss conceded that Bush's hard line stance against taxes
could jeopardize chances for success. The president-elect will
nominate the final two members of the panel after the election and
those two officials are expected to be crucial to reaching an
agreement.
   ``I would hope that after November 8 (Bush) would take a closer
look,'' Strauss said. ``Certainly (former Treasury Secretary James)
Baker, one of his principal economic advisers, knows we have to do
something about the deficit.''
   Strauss' comments came during a two-day conference on the
economic problems which will face the next president. The top
economic advisers to both Bush and Dukakis were participants in the
program.
   Lawrence Summers, a Harvard economics professor who is advising
Dukakis, said it will be critical for the next president to deal
quickly with the twin budget and trade deficits as well as the
Third World debt problem.
   However, some Republicans at the conference said they were not
convinced that the deficit problem would be a critical issue for
the next president.
   Richard Rahn, chief economist of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce
and an economic adviser to Bush, said the vice president's proposal
for a flexible freeze on government spending would bring the
deficit very close to balance within five years through growth in
federal revenues.
   Rep. Jack Kemp, R-N.Y., said it was his fervent hope that the
recommendations of the National Economic Commission will be
``routinely delivered into the dustbin of history.''
   Other members of the commission include Chrysler Corp. Chairman
Lee Iacocca, AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland and former Defense
Secretary Casper Weinberger.

<HEAD>Studies Say Mammograms Reduce Cancer Deaths Among
40-to-49-Year-Olds</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A study by National Cancer Institute
scientists shows that mammogram examinations every one to two years
can reduce breast cancer deaths by 24 percent among women aged 40
to 49.
   The conclusion came from a detailed analysis of data from a
clinical trial begun 18 years ago by the Health Insurance Plan of
Greater New York. Researchers said it is the first comprehensive
study to prove that mammograms can be an important lifesaving
screening technique for women under the age of 50.
   ``This is the first statistically significant evidence of the
benefits'' for this age group, said Kenneth Chu, lead author of the
NCI analysis.
   Evidence has been clear for some time, he said, that there is a
significant benefit in mammographic screening among women aged 50
and above. But whether these benefits apply to women between the
ages 40 and 50 has been a matter of controversy, Chu said.
   ``Perhaps the new data will encourage those people who do not
currently advocate mammography for women under 50 to reassess their
position,'' he said.
   By analyzing the Health Insurance Plan data over a longer
follow-up period, Chu said, it becomes clear that consistent
screening among the younger women can lead to ``significant
reductions in breast cancer mortality.''
   Of 742 patients followed for at least 18 years, the NCI
researchers found there were 24 percent fewer breast cancer deaths
among women who had been screened at ages 40 to 49 when compared
with those in a non-screened group.
   Though mammography for the younger women has been recommended
for some time by the American Cancer Society and others, Chu said a
number of experts have said it was not cost effective for women in
their 40s to use the screening procedures. He said it takes time to
develop breast cancer and that the disease is much more frequent
among those over 50. As a result, said Chu, some experts felt that
not enough cancer would be found among women in their 40s to
justify mammographic examinations.
   Charles Smart, another NCI researcher, said the Health Insurance
Plan data is based on the results of mammograms that used the
technology of the 1960s. He said benefits may be even greater when
more modern cancer detection technology is used.
   He said the Health Insurance Plan studies showed that
mammography in the 1960s could detect only about 39 percent of the
breast cancers in women aged 40 to 49. Another study shows that the
improved mammographic technologies of the 1970s could detect 91
percent of the breast cancers, he said.
   ``With the 1980s technology, that benefit could be much
greater,'' perhaps even doubled, when compared with 1960s
technology, Smart said.
   He said the newer mammographic procedures use less radiation and
have a greater sensitivity than the procedures used in the 1960s.
   Mammography uses an X-ray technique to detect the presence of
lesions, such as tumors, within the breast.

Preppiness</HEAD>

   Something about George Bush drives his
political opponents to wage class warfare against him.
   Democrat Geraldine Ferraro tried it in 1984 and Republican Bob
Dole used that approach during the 1988 GOP primaries.
   Now it's Michael Dukakis' turn.
   Here is how the Democratic presidential candidate describes the
difference between Bush and himself on education:
   ``Between those who believe that good education ought to be the
property of a few and those who believe it is the birthright of
every American, no matter who they are or where they come from or
what the color of their skin.''
   In a text of that speech distributed to reporters, the words
``property'' and ``few'' are underlined.
   Bush took note of the Dukakis approach when he accused his
Democratic opponent of pursuing ``a strategy of emphasizing
differences between rich and poor, between one region of the
country and another.''
   By now, Bush should be accustomed to that kind of attack.
   A product of privilege who grew up in the moneyed confines of
Greenwich, Conn., the son of a banker and U.S. senator, Bush became
the butt of jibes about his gee-whiz preppiness during the 1980
campaign for the Republican presidential nomination, a contest in
which his very Eastern image didn't stand up well against Westerner
Ronald Reagan.
   So often during the past eight years, Bush was seen publicly
struggling to shuck that image.
   ``This is the real me,'' he told reporters at Cuzzin Richie's
truckstop in Greenland, N.H., as he climbed into the cab of an
18-wheeler. ``This is my home turf.''
   Moments earlier, inside the wood-frame, single-story restaurant,
this patrician trucker had prepared to hit the road by ordering ``a
splash of tea.''
   Bush was in political trouble back then. The New Hampshire
primary was fast approaching and the vice president had just been
soundly whipped in Iowa by Republican rival Dole who relished
reminding crowds that ``I'm from Russell, Kan., and proud of it.''
   Then the senator would say, ``Getting where I've gotten wasn't
because of any wealth in my family or because I had a powerful
father or mother.''
   Ferraro also liked to cite her humble beginnings, her Italian
immigrant parents, and going to law school at night.
   Not long before she would debate Bush, the Democratic vice
presidential nominee joked that she'd seen his briefing book and
found the following lines: ``Gosh, gee whiz, zippidy doo dah, and
let's win, win, win.''
   Of course, Bush often provided the best material for his
opponents.
   He explained his defeat in a GOP straw poll one Saturday in
October 1987, this way:
   ``A lot of people that support me, they were off at the air
show, they were off at their daughter's coming-out party, or they
were off teeing up on the golf course.''
   Democratic strategists are convinced the Bush preppy image is a
good point of attack.
   ``The more he is viewed as this guy from a privileged background
from Yale, the better off we are,'' said Kam Kawata, a Democratic
consultant in California.
   ``Keep pounding away,'' was his advice.
   But so far, those who have attacked Bush on class grounds have
not had much success.
   Reagan whipped Bush in the GOP primaries in 1980, and to a
degree that was a contest between the dying Eastern Establishment
wing of the party and the conservative populists, personified first
by Barry Goldwater and then by Reagan.
   But once Reagan hit his stride in New Hampshire, that contest
was never in doubt. Reagan's hold on the hearts of Republican
rank-and-file voters was too strong for Bush to break. The issue
wasn't class, it was heartstrings.
   Ferraro, of course, was on the losing end of a 49-state
landslide.
   Dole hammered away at Bush's background to the very end of the
GOP campaign, but to no avail.
   It worked in Iowa, but not in New Hampshire, nor in the South,
where Bush swept the Super Tuesday primaries.

   Republican George Bush today is closeted with
his debate coaches, practicing how to ``be presidential'' when he
meets Democratic opponent Michael Dukakis for their first
face-to-face encounter on Sunday.
   The GOP presidential nominee will engage in a mock debate today,
with former deputy Treasury Secretary Richard G. Darman playing the
role of Dukakis, said a Bush campaign source.
   Senior staff to the vice president were asked to submit
questions on a variety of topics that might come up in the debate,
and several top advisers are involved in briefing Bush on the
answers, said Rich Bond, the campaign's national political director.
   Talking to reporters Tuesday aboard the campaign plane, Bond
described the debate preparation as ``diligent'' and said ``it will
be used for sharpening him up.''
   He declined to be specific about the rehearsals, but said: ``You
want to avoid costly mistakes and you want to come across as
presidential.
   ``What you've got to do at a debate at this level is be
presidential.''
   Bush has mentioned his own distaste for learning statistics but
said he needs to review that kind of material.
   But Bond commented: ``I don't think viewers will be
overimpressed with a mechanical recitation of facts and figures.
They'll be more impressed with whether the candidates have a grasp
of subjects.''
   The top aide made the comments as Bush took a quick trip into
New Jersey where he put on a patriotic show by touring a flag
manufacturing company and said, ``Flag sales are doing well and
America is doing well.''
   Bush, who has sought to turn the Pledge of Allegiance into an
election issue, addressed a rally outside the Annin Flag Co. of
Bloomfield flanked by enormous American flag banners.
   ``The flags you make fly over an America that today is stronger
and more prosperous than at any time in its proud history,'' Bush
told a group of several hundred people.
   He made some references to the economic record of his opponent
as governor of Massachusetts but without the same verve as he has
used to attack Dukakis' resume over the past several days.
   ``It's important to put all his (Dukakis) claims into
perspective before the debate,'' Bond said. ``Michael Dukakis is
not running away with the assertion that the `Massachusetts
miracle' is the best thing since sliced bread.''
   Dukakis officials have heatedly denied most of the allegations
raised by Bush about the state of the Massachusetts economy,
employement and taxation and have countered the Bush figures with
statistics of their own.
   Leading the Bush debate strategy sessions are media adviser
Roger Ailes, campaign chairman James A. Baker III, and pollster
Robert Teeter, Bond said.
   After the New Jersey speech, Bush got some debate pointers from
patrons at the Glenwood Diner when he stopped for a cup of coffee
and a slice of crumb cake.
   Several women in the diner told Bush he looked better in person
than on television. He asked them why they thought so.
   ``Because you're relaxed,'' suggested Lucie Galioto.
   ``You may have something there,'' the vice president said. Bush
said he would have to work on appearing more relaxed in front of
the cameras.
   Bond said New Jersey is one of nine states the campaign sees as
critical battlegrounds within the grasp of either candidate. The
other states Bond cited are California, Ohio, Pennsylvania,
Illinois, Missouri, Texas, Michigan and Wisconsin.

   At a U.S.-Soviet forum on human rights,
local people saved some of their sharpest barbs for their own
government.
   Participants from the southern Soviet republic of Georgia, where
a six-day friendship conference is being held, accused their own
officials of everything from treading on a local language to
destroying a historic monastery.
   ``The civil rights of my mother are being violated. She is being
forced out of her apartment with her daughter and her
granddaughter,'' one woman, her voice trembling, told the 500
people packed into the screening room at the Georgian Filmmakers'
Union building on Tuesday.
   The comment came on the second day of the annual conference that
brings together Soviet and American citizens. It is sponsored by
the Chautauqua (N.Y.) Institution and the Soviet
government-sanctioned Friendship Society.
   Tuesday's forum echoed the sharp exchanges that often embitter
superpower negotiations on human rights.
   ``American freedom rests on the bones of the Indians,'' said one
Soviet member of the audience in a comment to American panelists
Mark Palmer, U.S. ambassador to Hungary, and Spencer Oliver, chief
counsel to the House Foreign Affairs Committee.
   Some Georgians, however, used the forum to call on authorities
in Moscow to redress their complaints.
   Guram Mamoulia of Tbilisi accused the Soviet army of slowly
destroying a historic Georgian monastery by creating an artillery
firing range nearby.
   ``Two of my comrades came here today wanting to show fragments
of the shells that are destroying the monastery,'' the stocky man
said. ``But they were barred from entering.''
   Mamoulia appealed to Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev to
intervene personally.
   A complaint by another a Georgian member of the audience was
read aloud by Levan A. Alexidze, vice president of Tbilisi State
University:
   ``Why does the military continue to destroy major Georgian
monuments? Why are expelled Moslem Georgians denied their right of
regaining citizenship? Why is there no factory for
Georgian-language typewriters?''
   Soviet panelist Igor F. Blishchenko, one of his country's
experts on international law, expressed irritation with the
questions, saying there were more important matters to discuss.
   But Palmer said: ``We don't see anything small about a woman
being deprived of her apartment.''
   Only one of the Georgians' complaints was answered in detail. An
official from Georgia's agency for historic preservation said he
had received a letter from Defense Minister Dmitri T. Yazov saying
the artillery range had been shortened and the direction of fire
changed.
   The most emotional exchanges between Soviets and Americans came
during a discussion of Soviet Jews, many of whom have been trying
to leave the country for years.
   Oliver cited an Israeli government figure that 350,000 official
invitations have been issued to Soviet Jews so they can leave the
country.
   Samuel L. Zivs, first deputy chairman of the state-sanctioned
Soviet Anti-Zionist Committee, said Jewish emigration this year had
already topped 10,000 and would reach 15,000 by year's end.
   In contrast, only 917 Jews were allowed out in 1986, Zivs said.
   Soviet officials indicated they thought the tone of the meetings
had improved somewhat over the past two years, but not enough.
   Leonid I. Dobrokhotov, an official in the propaganda department
in the Communist Party Central Committee, said, ``If American
speakers in the past adopted the tone and spirit of a prosecutor,
here we have felt the tone of a teacher speaking to small children
...
   ``I share the attitude expressed by a number of Soviet speakers
that the best way to proceed would be to act as though we were all
students, and could learn from each other.''

   A Senate panel has approved a bill requiring
warning labels on alcoholic beverages. One lawmaker said the
measure was an attempt to counter the alcohol industry's $2
billion-a-year effort to ``glamorize'' their products.
   The bill approved unanimously Tuesday by the Senate Commerce
Committee would require labels stating that alcohol could impair
driving abilities and cause birth defects and other health problems.
   ``Labeling is realistic, it will work, and I think we can move
this bill through Congress this year,'' said Sen. Ernest F.
Hollings, D-S.C., chairman of the committee.
   Hollings said the bill was the first in the history of Congress
to call for labeling on alcohol.
   The measure is a result of a compromise by Sen. Strom Thurmond,
R-S.C., who has sought it for the past 19 years, and Sen. Wendell
Ford, D-Ky., whose state is a major producer of whiskey. It would
require a single warning on bottles and cans of distilled spirits,
beer and wine and prohibit states from requiring additional warning
labels.
   ``This compromise boils it down to the two warnings that are
most critical,'' said Sen. Albert Gore, D-Tenn., referring to
pregnancies and driving.
   The measure was approved by the committee on a voice vote, with
no member objecting.
   ``The public is entitled to the facts, and they are not getting
them from the alcohol industry,'' Thurmond said. ``Warning labels
represent a modest attempt to counter the $2 billion spent each
year by the alcohol industry to glamorize their product.''
   Thurmond added: ``I anticipate the bill's passage by both houses
of Congress before we adjourn in October.''
   The required label would read, ``Government Warning: According
to the Surgeon General, women should not drink alcohol during
pregnancy because of the risk of birth defects. Consumption of
alcoholic beverages impairs your ability to drive a car or operate
machinery, and may cause other health problems.''
   A similar bill has been introduced in the House by Rep. John
Conyers, D-Mich. It was understood that Conyers will ask the House
to accept the compromise language, assuming the bill gets through
the Senate.

   George Bush used an American Bar Association
questionnaire to criticize Michael Dukakis for his Massachusetts
prison furlough program, while Dukakis accused the Reagan
administration of eviscerating a program to provide legal services
for the poor.
   The two presidential contenders got in the digs while giving
statements on law-related issues to be published in the ABA
Journal. The responses were released Tuesday.
   ``Our No. 1 priority should be to ensure that those convicted of
violent crimes remain behind bars,'' Bush said when asked about the
nation's prisons. ``I strongly condemn the concept of placing such
felons on furloughs _ an idea embraced by Gov. Dukakis _ or putting
them in minimum security facilities.''
   Dukakis, the Democratic nominee, has come under repeated
criticism for a Massachusetts prison furlough program. A convicted
killer escaped while on furlough and raped and killed a woman in
another state. The program has since been changed.
   ``As a partial solution (to prison overcrowding) I favor
converting unnecessary military bases and other federal
installations to prison use,'' added Bush, the Republican nominee.
   Dukakis praised his state's ``intensive and highly successful
probation and parole supervision project to reduce overcrowding in
our prisons.''
   Both men said the long-term solution to overcrowded prisons is
construction of new prisons.
   The candidates also were asked their views of the Legal Services
Corp., the federally funded organization providing legal help to
the poor.
   President Reagan actively has sought to abolish the organization
but Congress has refused.
   Bush said the agency ``plays an important role'' in providing
legal services to the poor but said private attorneys also should
offer free help to those who cannot afford to pay.
   Dukakis said: ``While a Dukakis administration will encourage
private attorney involvement programs, it is clear that pro bono
work alone cannot meet the legal needs of the poor.
   ``The budget of the Legal Services Corp. has been savaged over
the past seven years and I will do all I can _ within the
constraints of a massive federal budget deficit _ to strengthen our
commitment to this vital program.''
   On affirmative action, Bush voiced opposition to racial quotas
but added, ``I do strongly support affirmative action programs
designed to remedy past discrimination and intend to by taking
aggressive steps to recruit minorities and other groups which
because of past discrimination have not yet been able join fully
the American mainstream.''
   The Reagan administration has opposed broad use of affirmative
action, seeking to limit it as a legal remedy for only those people
who themselves have been subjected to discriminatory treatment.
   Dukakis said that ``courts, appropriate public institutions and
local communities must have the ability to take whatever
affirmative steps are necessary to wipe out the lingering effects
of past discrimination.''

   A Bush administration will guarantee
access to college for anybody who wants to go, Sen. Dan Quayle told
a university audience in pitching the Republicans as ``the party of
hopes and dreams.''
   At the University of Nevada-Las Vegas, the Republican vice
presidential nominee told 600 students and others Tuesday, ``We
understand the importance of higher education, and we're going to
make sure that anybody who wants to go to higher education will
have access to higher education, no matter what.''
   He did not elaborate, but George Bush has proposed allowing
parents to earn interest tax-free on savings bonds for college, and
pledged his support of the Pell Grant program, which President
Reagan once tried to curtail sharply.
   Quayle said, ``People want to see change and I can say we are
the party of change.'' He repeatedly compared Michael Dukakis to
former president Jimmy Carter.
   ``Gambling on another liberal sounding governor coming out of
nowhere would be a far greater gamble than anything you find on Las
Vegas Strip,'' he said.
   Quayle was flying to Arizona today to visit an award-winning
elementary school in Chandler and then to address the Rotary Club
in Phoenix, the city where he spent eight years of his youth.
   Later, he was headed to California and stops in Fresno,
Bakersfield and Los Angeles, where he was reuniting with his wife,
Marilyn, after her first solo campaign swing.
   The Indiana senator, at rallies in Boise, Idaho, and this
gambling capital, kept up his drumbeat of criticisms of Michael
Dukakis.
   In both Idaho and Nevada, he accused Dukakis of favoring broader
federal control over water on public lands. He charged that Dukakis
would let ``some Washington bureaucracy'' make decisions that could
adversely affect ranchers and farmers throughout the arid West.
   But Tom Herman, domestic policy adviser to the Dukakis campaign,
said Quayle is misrepresenting Dukakis' position.
   ``Once again, Dan Quayle simply has his facts wrong,'' Herman
said in Boston. ``But that's no surprise because he makes a habit
of misunderstanding and misstating the facts.
   ``Mike Dukakis believes that the federal government must
recognize the primacy of state water laws, particularly in the
West, that we must insure a steady and high quality water system as
a backbone of the Western economy.''
   Quayle, who once opposed raising the minimum wage, said he now
supports raising it from $3.35 to $4 an hour over the next two
years, coupled with a youth wage that would pay 80 percent of the
minimum.
   But Quayle said even the $4.55 minimum wage that Senate
Democrats are pressing for isn't enough for a single parent to
raise a family on. The answer is better training and education, as
well as an expanded earned income tax credit for the working poor,
he said.
   On the plight of the 37 million Americans with no health
insurance, Quayle suggested experimenting with letting small
businesses ``buy into the Medicaid program'' to cover their workers.
   Quayle got a warm reception from the crowd of more than 1,000 at
the Idaho capital. He encountered some heckling at the Las Vegas
campus, but many in the audience joined in a chant of ``Dukakis is
a wimp.''

   People say they would be better off
financially if Republican George Bush rather than Democrat Michael
Dukakis were elected president, according to a Washington Post-ABC
News poll.
   The poll also found Bush more capable of holding down taxes and
keeping the country out of war, while Dukakis was seen as clearly
better at protecting the Social Security system.
   The two were close on such personal characteristics as
experience, honesty, ability to be trusted in a crisis and ability
to get things done.
   Results of the survey of 1,271 likely voters were published in
today's editions of the Post. The survey, begun a week ago today
and finished Monday, found Bush leading Dukakis 50 percent to 46
percent if the election were being held today.
   Last week, a Washington Post-ABC News poll showed Dukakis
leading 48-45. The 3-point margin of error in both surveys meant
the candidates were essentially tied.
   Fifty percent of the respondents said they would be personally
better off financially under a Bush administration, compared with
38 percent saying they would benefit under a Dukakis administration.
   Forty-five percent said Bush would do better at keeping the
country out of war, compared with 38 percent for Dukakis.
Fifty-five percent said Bush would do a better job of holding taxes
down, compared with 31 percent for Dukakis. And 50 percent said
Bush would do a better job of controlling inflation, compared with
37 percent for Dukakis.
   However, Dukakis would do a better job than Bush of protecting
Social Security, according to 48 percent of the respondents,
compared with 38 percent who said Bush would do a better job.
   The survey also examined which issues were important to voters
and how strong they considered each candidate on those issues.
   According to the survey, six out of 10 respondents considered
holding down taxes to be a very important issue, two-thirds of the
respondents thought preserving American family values was a very
important issue and two-thirds found creating new jobs to be very
important.
   Bush had a slight lead in preserving American family values,
while Dukakis was seen as better able to create new jobs.
   The survey indicated that Dukakis still had trouble making
himself known among voters: 54 percent said they did not know
enough about the Massachusetts governor to judge whether he would
be a good president.
   Dukakis continued to benefit from his choice of Sen. Lloyd
Bentsen as a running mate, with 37 percent saying he would be more
qualified than his Republican counterpart, Sen. Dan Quayle of
Indiana, to assume the presidency. Only 9 percent said Quayle would
be more qualified.

<HEAD>President Signs Bill Providing Funds For AIDS Fight</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan has signed a major spending
bill that includes $1.2 billion to combat AIDS, while calling on
Congress to speed up action on its remaining money bills.
   ``I want those seven bills on my desk and in shape to sign by
Oct. 1,'' Reagan said Tuesday in an appearance before the U.S.
Junior Chamber of Commerce in the Old Executive Office Building.
   Reagan has urged Congress repeatedly to complete action on its
13 appropriations bills before the 1989 budget year begins Oct. 1.
   ``Now, they're working on what I asked for _ 13 separate
spending bills,'' the president said. ``The new fiscal year begins
in 11 days, and seven of these (bills) are still under
negotiation.''
   Reagan also urged Congress to amend a defense appropriations
bill which contains some features similar to a $299.5 billion
defense authorization bill that he vetoed earlier this year.
   ``I want defense legislation to continue the policies of the
last eight years _ the policies that led the Soviets to the
bargaining table and out of Afghanistan,'' he said. ``I want
defense legislation that will advance national security, not
sacrifice it on the altar of congressional pork barrel.''
   Reagan has signed three appropriations bills, and spending plans
for covering the Treasury Department and Postal Service, Interior
Department and military construction are awaiting his approval.
Congress is still working on seven.
   Earlier Tuesday, Reagan had signed a $39.4 billion
appropriations bill for the departments of Labor and Health and
Human Services during a private Oval Office ceremony attended by
some of the principal sponsors of the bill.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the president used
the occasion to thank those lawmakers who had removed a provision
from the bill that would have authorized expansion of federal
Medicaid payments for abortions.
   This would have allowed use of federal funds for abortions in
cases of incest and rape. Current law permits such payments only
when the mother's life is endangered.
   Among the provisions of the Labor-HHS bill is one which
allocates $1.2 billion for the fight against AIDS _ acquired immune
deficiency syndrome _ about $100 million less than Reagan sought.
   Congress last year was unable to complete work on the separate
spending bills and had to resort to passing a catchall ``continuing
resolution.'' Reagan reluctantly signed it, rather than shut down
the government, even though it restricted his ability to veto
spending plans he did not like.
   Reagan has said he will not sign another such spending bill and
he repeated that vow Tuesday in a meeting with the heads of the
congressional appropriations committees, Fitzwater said.

   The Reagan administration has used the CIA to
foment civil unrest in Nicaragua and in the process has damaged
efforts at a long-term peace accord between the leftist government
and the Contra rebels, House Speaker Jim Wright says.
   In a highly unusual disclosure, Wright told reporters Tuesday
that the CIA has employed agents covertly in Nicaragua to organize
and promote anti-government rallies and protests.
   Wright, speaking at his regular daily news conference, said
Congress has received ``clear testimony'' that the CIA has sought
``to provoke an overreaction'' by the Managua government.
   Elaborating later in an interview, the speaker added: ``Agents
of our government have assisted in organizing the kinds of
anti-government demonstrations that have been calculated to
stimulate and provoke arrests.''
   Wright said the CIA had made the admission under questioning
from members of Congress. Presumably, the disclosure would have
come in closed-door oversight sessions of the congressional
intelligence committees, most of whose work is classified.
   A CIA spokeswoman, Sharon Basso, said, ``There isn't anything
the agency would say publicly about that to confirm or deny it. We
do brief Congress, but wouldn't discuss that publicly.''
   Wright said he opposed the CIA activity as detrimental to
regional peace efforts because it has led to government crackdowns
on the opposition and complicated already hostile relations.
   ``I do not believe it is the proper role of our government to
try to provoke riots ... or deliberately to try to antagonize
governing officials into foolish overreactions,'' he said. ``We
should be using the influence of the United States to encourage the
peace process, not discourage it.''
   But he also said the Sandinista regime was ``foolish'' to
respond to the protests with crackdowns such as the closing of
opposition media outlets like the newspaper La Prensa and Radio
Catolica, a church-run radio station.
   ``I've made that unmistakably clear to people in Nicaragua. They
have to demonstrate their commitment to the democratization they
have announced'' in earlier peace agreements, he said.
   Wright said he did not know which specific anti-government
actions were due to CIA-sponsored agitation.
   But a spokesman for the Senate Intelligence Committee, David
Holliday, said the panel was confident that 40 people arrested at a
July 10 anti-government demonstration at Nandaime, south of
Managua, were not linked to the CIA.
   The committee held two days of hearings July 13-14 that included
testimony from U.S. Ambassador Richard Melton, who was expelled
along with seven other embassy personnel following the Nandaime
protest.
   ``We were satisfied ... there was no U.S. government
involvement'' in that particular demonstration, Holliday said.
   Wright's disclosure raised fears in the Reagan administration
that the Sandinistas might take the comment as evidence that the
jailed protesters were CIA-sponsored subversives, according to an
administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The Contras are asking for release of the Nandaime prisoners as
a gesture of good faith before resuming high-level peace talks with
the government.
   The two sides broke off talks Monday in Guatemala City after
failing to agree on a new site for resuming peace negotiations, and
Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega accused the rebels of seeking to
avoid negotiations in hopes of receiving new U.S. military aid.
   The use of agitators to stir up protests is a common method of
intelligence operatives seeking to destabilize regimes deemed
unfriendly. It was understood that the U.S. action in Nicaragua was
authorized by a presidential ``finding'' required by law for any
covert action. Such findings must be reported to the House and
Senate intelligence committees which oversee the CIA.

<HEAD>Former PTL Official Alleges Sexual Encounter With Bakker</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former PTL official said he told a
federal grand jury that he had sex with former PTL leader Jim
Bakker, but Bakker has denied the allegation in court.
   Jay Babcock, the former director of creative television for the
troubled ministry, commented Tuesday after being asked questions by
the grand jury apparently designed to determine whether PTL money
was paid for sexual favors.
   Babcock was the first man to publicly acknowledge telling the
grand jury of a sexual encounter with Bakker.
   Calls by The Associated Press to Bakker's phone number in Fort
Mill, S.C., went unanswered Tuesday night.
   In August, Bakker denied under oath that he had ever had a
homosexual relationship.
   Told by a reporter Tuesday outside the federal courthouse that
Bakker had denied ever having a homosexual relationship with
anyone, Babcock replied: ``I'm saying he's a liar.''
   Babcock told reporters Monday that he expected to be questioned
by prosecutors about ``whether I had sex with the boss.''
   On Tuesday, after testifying much of the afternoon, Babcock was
asked by a reporter, ``What did you say regarding sex with Jim
Bakker?''
   His response: ``I commented that `yes, it happened _ a long time
ago.'''
   Babcock said prosecutors also wanted to know about the
circumstances surrounding that encounter. ``I'm not willing to talk
about those,'' he told reporters.
   Babcock also told reporters that prosecutors asked him whether
Bakker and his personal aide, David Taggart, had a sexual
relationship.
   ``I have no first-hand knowledge of that,'' Babcock said.
   PTL records show that Taggart drew more than $620,000 from PTL
in a 15-month period that ended in March 1987 _ the same month
Bakker resigned as PTL's president after acknowledging that he had
a 1980 sexual encounter with Jessica Hahn and that money had been
paid to silence her.
   Bakker and his top aides are under investigation for possible
mail, wire and tax fraud.
   The grand jury probe, now in its second year, is focusing and
whether Bakker and other ministry leaders violated federal laws by
raising money through the mails or on television for one purpose
and then spending it for another.
   Bakker was dismissed by the Assemblies of God denomination in
May 1987 for unbecoming conduct related to his sexual encounter
with Ms. Hahn and because of ``alleged misconduct involving
bisexual activity.''
   In May 1987, the Rev. Jerry Falwell told reporters that Gary
Smith, PTL's former general manager, was the target of one of
Bakker's alleged homosexual advances.
   Smith testified before the grand jury for about six hours
Monday, but refused to discuss what he said. He acknowledged,
however, that the subject of homosexuality was discussed.
   John Wesley Fletcher, the evangelist who introduced Ms. Hahn, a
former church secretary, to Bakker, testified for about three hours
Tuesday. He also refused to tell reporters what happened inside the
grand jury room.
   Asked whether he had ever had a sexual relationship with Bakker,
Fletcher replied: ``No comment.''
   Fletcher's attorney, Allen Bailey, told reporters: ``His failure
to comment doesn't indicate anything, gentlemen. His failure to
comment is simply that he cannot discuss what went on in the grand
jury room.''
   PTL filed for protection under the federal bankruptcy code in
June 1987. A bankruptcy trustee has been attempting to find a buyer
for the Fort Mill, S.C., ministry, which includes a Christian theme
park and real estate.
   A bid by Bakker for PTL apparently fell apart when Bakker
couldn't prove he had the necessary financial backing.

<HEAD>Shultz to Press Human Rights As Hope Fades For START Deal This
Year</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of State George Shultz plans to
press human rights issues in new talks with his Soviet counterpart
amid signs the Reagan administration has given up hopes of
completing a major nuclear arms accord this year.
   Shultz, in possibly his last full-scale meeting with Soviet
Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze, hopes to ``tie down some
unresolved issues'' in the stalled superpower negotiations to cut
long-range nuclear arsenals by 50 percent, Assistant Secretary of
State Rozanne L. Ridgway told a congressional panel.
   ``We certainly know we can't finish the START (Strategic Arms
Reduction Talks) treaty this year,'' Ms. Ridgway said Tuesday.
   Shevardnadze was scheduled to arrive here this evening and hold
talks with Shultz on Thursday and Friday, Ms. Ridgway said. The
Soviet foreign minister also was expected to call on President
Reagan.
   Although this week's meetings may be the final major talks
between Shultz and Schevardnadze on U.S-Soviet topics, ``it
certainly does not signal the end of the administration's
commitment to press forward'' on improving relations, Ms. Ridgway
said.
   ``We believe there is good work that can yet be done, and we
hope also to set the stage for the next administration _ of
whichever party it may be,'' she told the House subcommittee on
Europe and the Middle East.
   ``We will press the Soviets to clear the books of the remaining
human rights cases ... we will push on (freer) emigration,'' Ms.
Ridgway said. She mentioned exit for members of divided families,
separated spouses, dual nationals and people punished for religious
or political activity and said ``it would appear'' the exodus of
Soviet Jews may again reach 2,000 monthly, its level of the late
1970s. The August figure was 1,900.
   Progress on human rights in the Soviet Union is ``the key as far
as we are concerned'' to other pending issues, starting with a
successful conclusion to the current review conference in Vienna,
Austria, of the 1975 Helsinki East-West accords on security and
human rights, Ms. Ridgway said.
   ``We and our allies have been working very hard to bringing it
about _ but on our terms ... we are prepared to stay as long as it
takes to achieve it,'' she said, and ``there are prospects that the
final agreement pieces we insist upon at Vienna may fall into
place.''
   Negotiators in Vienna must agree on mandates for a new 35-nation
conference on confidence and security-building in Europe and on
negotiations on conventional arms by the NATO and Warsaw Pact
countries, Ms. Ridgway said.
   The Soviets have settled more divided family cases and lowered
emigration barriers, she said, but ``we still have problems in the
areas of freedom of assembly and speech.''
   Ms. Ridgway said the U.S. is satisfied with implementation of
the treaty concluded eliminating land-based intermediate-range
nuclear missiles. She also said Moscow appears to be keeping to its
schedule to withdraw its forces from Afghanistan by Feb. 15.

<HEAD>Olympics Start Disappointing For NBC</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHRYN BAKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It's too early to tell how NBC's 179 hours of
prime-time Summer Olympics coverage will score in the ratings, but
the first three nights started far off the ratings record set by
the 1984 games on ABC.
   Nevertheless, the first three nights of coverage did land in the
top 10 in the Nielsens last week, the final week of the broadcast
year.
   Sunday night's Olympics coverage was No. 2 among all prime-time
shows, according to the A.C. Nielsen Co., with a rating of 17.7 and
a 30 share. Saturday's coverage came in ninth, with a rating of
16.1 and a 31 share. The opening ceremonies Friday ranked 10th,
with a 15.2 and 29.
   The rating is a percentage of the nation's estimated 88.6
million households with televisions. The share is a percentage of
sets in use.
   The 1984 games averaged a 23.5 rating.
   People meters, the new viewer-measuring devices that have shown
overall lower numbers for network shows, combined with a decline in
network viewing may contribute to a depression in Olympics ratings
this year.
   The first three nights of the Olympics averaged about a 30
share, somewhat lower than the third of the viewing audience NBC
had predicted. NBC analyst Jeff Boehme said it was too early to
tell if there's a trend in the Olympics ratings.
   Monday night's Olympics broadcast continued to score
disappointingly in the ratings, though it won the night for NBC.
The coverage during prime time rated 18.0 with a 28 share. CBS had
a 14.5 for the night, and ABC a 12.9.
   CBS effectively programmed against the Olympics on Sunday night
with a repeat of the Valerie Bertinelli movie ``Rockabye'' that
ranked fourth in the Nielsens.
   CBS also scored with its timely ``48 Hours'' on the approach of
Hurricane Gilbert, getting the highest rating yet for the weekly
news program. It ranked 12th with a 14.1 rating and 24 share.
   NBC won the week ending Sept. 18 with an average rating of 14.0.
CBS and ABC tied with 11.5 each.
   The week marked the 52nd since the 1987-88 fall season began, so
NBC claimed its fourth broadcast-year win in a row with an average
rating of 14.5. Although CBS finished third for the regular season
that ended in April, based on yearlong figures, CBS edged ABC for
the broadcast year with an average rating of 12.2 to ABC's 12.1.
   The top 10 shows last week were: ``A Different World'' NBC,
``Summer Olympics _ Sunday'' NBC, ``The Cosby Show'' NBC,
``Rockabye'' CBS, ``Monday Night Football'' ABC, ``60 Minutes''
CBS, ``Barbara Walters'' ABC, ``Murder, She Wrote'' CBS, ``Summer
Olympics _ Saturday'' and ``Summer Olympics _ Opening'' NBC.
   The lowest-rated prime-time shows of the week were: ``Live! Dick
Clark Presents,'' ``The Flintstones _ Just Say No,'' ``The `Slap'
Maxwell Story,'' ``Cowboy Joe,'' ``California Girls Special,''
``Lily Tomlin _ Sold Out,'' ``West 57th,'' ``Live from the Hard
Rock Cafe,'' ``Space _ Beyond the Shuttle'' and ``Decision '88
Countdown.''
   Despite a move to a half-hour earlier in New York, where its
ratings dropped, the ``CBS Evening News'' rebounded into first
place in the national news ratings after tying with ABC's ``World
News Tonight'' the previous week.
   The news race last week continued to be a virtual dead heat,
with less than a point separating the three network newscasts. CBS
had a 10.8 rating and 22 share, ABC had 10.3 and 21, and ``NBC
Nightly News'' had a rating of 10.1 and a 20 share.

<HEAD>Ailing Japanese Emperor Reported Improving, But Officials On Alert</HEAD>

   The palace said today that the ailing Emperor
Hirohito's condition was improving, but Cabinet ministers stayed
near telephones for fear of the worst and members of the imperial
family canceled scheduled activities.
   The frail 87-year-old, who began vomiting blood Monday and has
since had three transfusions, was in serious but stable condition
and under constant medical surveillance, palace and press reports
said.
   A chapter in Japan's modern history will close with the passing
of Hirohito, the world's oldest and longest reigning monarch. The
Japanese media monitored the emperor's condition round-the-clock.
   Takenori Sugawara, a spokesman for the Imperial Household
Agency, said today that Hirohito was still receiving intravenous
care but was fully conscious. He said the emperor appeared ``headed
in a favorable direction.''
   He said palace doctors were not planning any more blood
transfusions.
   Two doctors, three nurses and two palace stewards were keeping
close watch over Hirohito in his bedroom, the palace also
announced, adding that there were no plans to hospitalize the
emperor.
   Crown Prince Akihito and Princess Michiko visited the emperor
today in their fourth visit since he fell ill. The 54-year-old
crown prince is the first in line to follow Hirohito.
   Doctors began administering emergency care after the emperor
vomited blood repeatedly from Monday night through Tuesday morning,
the imperial agency said.
   The nationally circulated daily Yomiuri Shimbun, quoting palace
medical sources, said doctors acted after Hirohito initially
vomited about 1 pint of blood. Court physicians suspected an
enlarged pancreas was causing hemorrhaging of the emperor's
duodenum, part of the small intestine, according to the sources.
   In September, doctors performed an intestinal bypass operation
in the same area, circumventing a blockage caused by the enlarged
pancreas.
   Major Japanese dailies carried front-page headlines today
reporting that the emperor remained in serious condition, while
about 100 reporters maintained close watch over the Imperial
Palace, a green oasis in the center of Tokyo.
   A small group of about 20 well-wishers gathered in the large
square in front of the palace _ kneeling down in prayer, according
to television reports.
   But strollers in Tokyo's Ginza, a popular shopping and nightlife
district, appeared unaffected by news of the emperor's failing
health.
   Many older Japanese still feel deep affection for Hirohito, but
younger people tend to have less interest in the imperial family.
   Hirohito has occupied the throne since 1926, considered a living
god for the first 20 years of his reign. After World War II, U.S.
occupation officials forced him publicly to renounce his divinity.
Under Japan's postwar constitution, he became a symbol of Japan's
unity but exercised no real power.
   As the vigil over the emperor continued, members of the imperial
family cancelled all scheduled events, news reports said.
   Prince Hiro, 28, the crown prince's eldest son and second in
line to the throne, canceled an appearance today at a performance
of the visiting Milano Scala opera. Prince Mikasa, the emperor's
younger brother, called off a two-day trip outside Tokyo.
   Prince Aya, 22, the crown prince's second son, who is studying
in Britain, was to return to Japan later today with former Prime
Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone, who cut short his visit to Britain,
according to press reports.
   The government on Tuesday instructed all Cabinet members to
remain within calling distance of the capital in the event the
emperor died.
   The Cabinet was expected to meet Thursday to shift Hirohito's
state responsibilities to the crown prince.
   Three times in recent weeks, the emperor has been bedridden with
a fever. A news report last week said he had lost 20 pounds of the
130 pounds he weighed before his surgery.

   President Reagan probably will not hold a
formal news conference until after his successor is chosen in the
Nov. 8 election.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, speaking Tuesday, did
not say why no news conference is foreseen in the next six weeks.
Reagan has an ambitious schedule of campaign trips on behalf of
Republican presidential nominee George Bush and GOP congressional
candidates before the election.
   The president's last news conference was at the seven-nation

</TEXT>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Criminals, especially drug traffickers, are
increasingly arming themselves with powerful semiautomatic and
automatic assault weapons, an anti-gun group said.
   ``The number of assault weapons in civilian hands _ both
criminal and law abiding _ is estimated to be in the hundreds of
thousands, perhaps millions,'' the Education Fund to End Handgun
Violence said in a report released Tuesday.
   The group said police organizations, government agencies and
pro-gun control groups agree the number of such weapons has
increased dramatically in recent years, although no nationwide
statistics were available.
   Assault weapons have the capability of firing a large number of
rounds on a single magazine, great muzzle velocity and compact
design often including folding stocks that make it easier for the
weapon to be concealed.

   Television actor Ted Danson is leading a
coalition of environmental groups in a campaign to get the next
administration and Congress to toughen laws against pollution of
the oceans.
   ``Saving the oceans will take more than election-year
rhetoric,'' Danson said at a news conference on Tuesday.
   Danson, co-star of the ``Cheers'' situation comedy, is president
and a founder of the year-old American Oceans Campaign based in
Santa Monica, Calif.
   Robert Sulnick, executive director of the campaign, said
supporters of next year's lobbying effort would try to win, among
other things, a ban on all dumping in the ocean and establishment
of a fund to tax companies and industries for cleanups.

   Republican Slade Gorton, attempting a Senate
comeback, coasted to a easy primary victory in Washington state
Tuesday while U.S. Rep. Don Bonker led fellow Democrat Mike Lowry
for their party's Senate nomination.
   As expected, Gov. Booth Gardner easily won renomination for a
second term in the Democratic primary.
   Gorton, a former state attorney general who swept into the
Senate on the Reagan landslide of 1980, demolished his lesser known
GOP challengers, former state Supreme Court Justice William Goodloe
of Seattle and Doug Smith, an Everett attorney and former White
House aide.
   With 32 percent of the state's 6,655 precincts reporting, Gorton
had 86 percent of the GOP vote, or 96,450 votes. Smith was a
distant second with 7 percent, or 8,297 votes, and Goodloe had 6
percent, or 6,810 votes.
   Lowry, the front-runner throughout the Democratic Senate primary
campaign, jumped to an early lead over Bonker, but then fell behind.
   ``It's gonna be a rollercoaster night,'' Bonker said.
   Bonker, who campaigned as a moderate who could regain the Senate
seat for the Democrats, had 53 percent of the Democratic vote, or
84,542 votes.
   Lowry, a self-described liberal who lost to Republican Sen. Dan
Evans in 1983, trailed with 47 percent, or 74,921 votes. It was
Evans' decision not to seek re-election that set off the state's
most exciting primary.
   Gardner, a popular Democrat who was one of Michael Dukakis'
earliest backers for the White House, enjoyed a whopping 90 percent
of the Democratic vote.
   Gardner had 146,805 votes, to 9,808 for political unknown Jeanne
Dixon of Bellevue, 4,738 for Richard Short of Grayland and 3,135
for Ted Parker Fix of Tacoma.
   State Rep. Bob Williams of Longview trailed King County
prosecutor Norm Maleng for the GOP gubernatorial nomination.
   With 30 percent of precincts reporting, Williams had 57,653
votes, or 61 percent, to Maleng's 34,017 votes, or 36 percent. Paul
Dean Santos of Port Orchard was a distant third with 2,256 votes,
or 2 percent.
   Maleng refused to concede, saying he would await further votes
from his political base, King County, which encompasses Seattle,
where 80 percent of the precincts had yet to be counted.
   In a hot race for Bonker's 3rd District congressional seat,
state Rep. Jolene Unsoeld, an Olympia liberal, won over John
McKibbin, a moderate Clark County commissioner.
   Unsoeld had 56 percent of the vote, with 30,006 votes to
McKibbin's 21,347, or 39 percent. John Libby Sr. of Olympia, an
adherent of the political extremist Lyndon LaRouche, trailed with 5
percent, or 2,697 votes.
   Bill Wight of Toledo won the Republican nomination in the 3rd,
with 14,366 votes. Bill Hughes of Vancouver was second with 8,757
votes.
   In Lowry's 7th district, former state Sen. Jim McDermott of
Seattle appeared headed for the Democratic nomination, which is
considered tantamount to election in the state's most Democratic
district.
   McDermott had 48 percent, or 6,727 votes, to lead Seattle City
Councilman Norm Rice, who was seeking to become the state's first
black congressman. Rice had 28 percent, or 3,882 votes. King County
Assessor Ruthe Ridder had 23 percent, or 3,263 votes.
   Robert Edwards of Renton led the GOP nomination, with 1,167
votes to Robert Blake's 1,009 votes.

   In the Senate race, Lowry, 49, staked out the liberal ground,
and Bonker, 51, claimed the moderate stance. On the Republican
side, Gorton billed himself as the conservative choice despite
opponents' claims he wasn't conservative enough.
   Bonker, who has represented the 3rd District in southwestern
Washington since 1975, spent the early part of his campaign trying
to improve his name recognition. Lowry, whose 7th District included
the media center of Seattle, had no such problem. He's been in
Congress since 1979.
   Although they have similar voting records, the two disagreed on
several issues, chiefly those of interest to regional voters, and
Bonker hammered on those differences as the campaign wore on.
   Bonker criticized Lowry for not supporting his proposed ban on
exporting raw logs, an issue of keen interest in the Northwest.
While Bonker argued such exports cost mill jobs, Lowry said a ban
would hurt small logging companies.
   The two also disagreed over the Navy's proposed home port in
Everett, with Lowry calling it the ``home pork'' and siding with
environmentalists against the project. Bonker said it would be
vital to the Everett economy.
   Gorton lost his Senate seat to Democrat Brock Adams. Many felt
the upset lay partly in Gorton's icy image and perception that he
had stopped listening to voters.
   This time, Gorton vowed to ``hear better, to listen better.''
Among other things, he opposes higher taxes and favors efforts to
control crime and illegal drugs.

   Photographer Sue Bennett says her
poster of a nude woman strategically covered by a pile of
artichokes portrays the ``quintessential artichoke lover,'' but the
shot has drawn a prickly reaction from some other women.
   Bennett says she and her friend and model, Joanne Gallaher, made
the poster as a tribute to the vegetable and to Marilyn Monroe, who
before achieving Hollywood stardom was queen of the 1947
Castroville Artichoke Festival.
   They hawked copies of the poster, titled ``Be An Artichoke
Lover,'' for $10 and $15, depending on the version, each at this
year's festival, held last weekend. Castroville, a farm town about
50 miles south of San Jose, bills itself as the artichoke capital
of the world.
   Darleen Dunham, chairwoman of the Monterey County Commission on
the Status of Women, said Monday she relayed several complaints
about the poster to festival officials.
   ``I'm not out to put other women down,'' Dunham said. ``But what
does a naked woman have to do with eating artichokes?''
   Bennett defended the poster, in which Gallaher is covered by
artichokes from her chest to her thighs.
   The photographer said an unscientific survey the two women took
last year showed female artichoke lovers outnumber their male
counterparts 10-1.
   ``The artichoke is probably the most feminist vegetable,'' she
said.

   It was well over 40 years since Jewel
Endsley carved his initials on the shell of a box turtle, so
understandably he was startled when the terrapin turned up in his
tomato patch.
   ``My brother-in-law's son was picking tomatoes in the garden,''
Endsley said. ``He saw a box turtle and picked it up. He turned it
over and saw my initials and the date.''
   Endsley, 60, said his uncle taught him as a child how to carve
on a turtle's shell without hurting the animal. One day on the farm
where he grew up, he marked a box turtle with his initials and the
date _ 1941.
   After retiring, Endsley started a garden on a patch of land that
had been part of that farm and noticed that ``something was eating
my tomatoes'' before his nephew found the tortoise.
   ``I've been feeding him some tomatoes,'' Endsley says. ``I'm
going to turn him loose as soon as I take a picture. I'll turn him
loose back in the same area, right there in my garden.''

<TEXT>
   Share prices rebounded sharply on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange today, and the dollar moved up against the Japanese yen
after fluctuations throughout the session.
   The dollar, which opened at 134.05 yen, ended trading at 134.18
yen, up 0.03 yen from Tuesday's close of 134.15 yen. The currency
was traded in a narrow range of 134.00-134.19 yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which fell
sharply in the morning session by losing 253.02 points, regained
164.08 points or 0.6 percent to rise back up to 27,712.66.
   A dealer with Daiwa Securities said traders started to buy
issues after they saw share prices fall sharply after Tuesday and
Wednesday morning amid reports of Emperor Hirohito's failing health.
   ``News about the emperor's serious condition was a negative
factor that affected investors psychologically,'' he said, speaking
on condition of anonymity.
   Mitsuhiko Kinugasa of the Daiwa Bank said the dollar-yen rate
fluctuated because of two opposing forces in the market.
   Those who were attracted by the higher European interest rates
tended to sell the yen to invest in the European currencies, mainly
the West German mark, but others tended to buy the yen in
anticipation of a stronger currency, he said.

<HEAD>Government Defends Refusal To Allow Opposition Rally</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Interior Minister Tomas Borge says
Nicaragua will not allow a planned opposition march because it
could end in violence, providing a pretext for new U.S. aid to
Contra rebels.
   Also Tuesday, the government and rebels blamed each other for
the breakdown of talks aimed at forging a lasting peace in the
7-year-old civil war.
   Borge told a news conference that the march planned for Sunday _
the first since a July 10 rally in which 40 opposition figures were
arrested _ was intended ``to create disturbances.''
   He acknowledged that the denial of the opposition Democratic
Coordinate's petition Tuesday leaves the leftist Sandinista
government open to criticism, but added:
   ``It would be worse and would be a larger political cost and a
greater pretext for our enemy and more of an argument for aid to
the Contras if there were provocations here that led to bloodshed
in the streets of Managua.''
   The Sandinistas claimed the U.S. Embassy backed the June 10
protest, which ended in a clash between protesters and police.
Nicaragua charged the embassy was seeking a plan to undermine the
government. The following day, the U.S. ambassador, Richard Melton,
was expelled from the country.
   In Washington on Tuesday, House Speaker Jim Wright said the CIA
had acknowledged in congressional testimony that it used undercover
agents in Nicaragua to stir up public protest, hoping the
government would overreact.
   Wright, D-Texas, said he did not know if the July 10
demonstration in Nandaime, south of Managua, was the result of U.S.
provocations.
   The Democratic Coordinate protested the government's decision to
ban Sunday's march.
   ``Political groups should have access to the means of
communication, take part in the right of association and the
ability to hold public demonstrations,'' the newspaper La Prensa
quoted Duilio Baltodano, an opposition leader, as saying.
   Government and rebel negotiators held talks Monday in Guatemala
City in an attempt to reopen peace negotiations to end the war,
which the government says has claimed more than 28,000 lives.
   ``The interest of Managua is to agree on a definitive
cease-fire, which the Contras have rejected,'' Victor Tinoco,
deputy foreign minister and Sandinista negotiator, was quoted as
telling the pro-goverment newspaper El Nuevo Diario.
   The rebels have said they would enter formal negotiations only
after Nicaragua frees the 40 opposition leaders.
   The government and rebels signed a pact on March 23 providing
for a temporary truce and talks in Managua. But the Contras say
they will participate only if they are held anywhere but the
Nicaraguan capital, where they say their movement is restricted.
   The Sandinistas insist Managua be the site of negotiations.
   ``This is a clear demonstration of the lack of Sandinista desire
to establish or take measures and set up reforms that permit a
democratic opening,'' said Roberto Ferrey, one of seven Contra
leaders. He spoke Tuesday on the rebels' clandestine Radio
Liberation.
   Negotiations to set a timetable for the rebels to lay down their
arms and for the Sandinistas to institute democratic reforms ended
in stalemate June 9.
   The U.S. Congress cut off military aid to the rebels Feb. 29.
The Contras claim they need such aid to act as a bargaining chip in
negotiations.

   Elizabeth Taylor's sixth husband, who happens
to be a member of a key Senate committee, is getting Congress to

conviction 14 years ago.
   Without dissent, the Senate late Tuesday approved a waiver

his late father, from a law that prohibits permanent resident visas
for aliens convicted of drug violations.
   The private relief bill was sought by Sen. John Warner, R-Va.,
Miss Taylor's sixth husband and the 34-year-old Wilding's
stepfather for six years until Warner and Miss Taylor divorced in
1982.
   Michael Wilding was born to Miss Taylor during her second
marriage, to the late British actor Michael Wilding.
   Now living in New York City and an actor on the television soap
opera ``The Guiding Light,'' Wilding was convicted in Wales in 1974
of possessing marijuana and cultivating marijuana plants in a house
he shared with six other people.
   He renounced his U.S. citizenship in 1971, but returned to the
United States 10 years later. Because of the marijuana conviction
in Great Britain, however, the Immigration and Naturalization
Service has refused to grant him a permanent resident visa.
   ``My knowledge and respect for this man developed during my
marriage to his mother, Elizabeth Taylor,'' Warner said in a letter
to the Senate Judiciary Committee. ``So far as I know, and his
mother knows, Mr. Wilding has lived a drug-free, law-abiding
existence since the occurrence of the offenses during his very
early life.''
   Warner said the INS has taken no definite steps to expel Wilding
but said the actor's attorneys anticipate the government will
commence deportation proceedings in the near future.
   ``I can attest from my personal knowledge, and that of his
mother, that Mr. Wilding would continue to be a law-abiding
resident of the United States,'' the senator said.

   An 8-year-old boy with AIDS-related
symptoms, whose family fled one city after protests over his
admittance to school, dreads another struggle because ``the ugly
people are going to be back,'' his mother says.
   ``Our big problem right now is that we just want to be a normal
family,'' Jason Robertson's mother, Tammie, said Tuesday. ``We
don't want to be in the spotlight. I don't want to be a civil
rights activist.
   ``All I want to be is a housewife,'' Mrs. Robertson said. ``All
my kids want is a mother.''
   Jason's family left the St. Louis suburb of Granite City, about
15 miles south of here, last month, saying they'd been harassed for
their efforts to enroll him in regular classes there.
   Last week, as many as two dozen parents began picketing South
Roxana Elementary School in this town of 2,000 to protest Jason's
application for admission, which officials are considering.
   At Tuesday's protest, parents carried hand-lettered signs
reading ``AIDS Kills'' and ``Help Keep AIDS Out of Our Schools.''
   ``If that kid comes here, my daughter will go to a private
school,'' Roseann Hayes said in an interview.
   Charles Conner, superintendent of Roxana's schools, said the
objections to Jason's attendance come mainly from ``a minority
group of parents ... in need of further education'' about AIDS.
   The boy became infected with the AIDS virus after a transfusion
of tainted blood products to treat his hemophilia.
   Jason has AIDS-related complex, a disease that often precedes
full-blown acquired immune deficiency syndrome. AIDS cripples the
body's defenses against disease, leaving the victim prey to
infections and cancer.
   The disease is spread through sexual contact, needles or
syringes shared by drug abusers, infected blood or blood products,
and from pregnant women to their offspring. It cannot be spread
casually.
   Because of his illness, Jason was the lone first-grade student
in a trailer on the Granite City schoolgrounds through most of last
school year.
   His isolation ended in May, when U.S. District Judge James L.
Foreman ordered Jason back in the classroom with his peers. But the
ruling did not end the protests, and the family fled Granite City.
   Mrs. Robertson said the family has been left alone in their new
home except for a recent harassing phone call to her mother-in-law
telling her to keep Jason out of school.
   The boy hasn't attended school since it began Aug. 29. His
mother said he's eager to be back in class, but dreads further
protests over his attendance.
   ``He said, `Oh brother, not that again. We're going to have to
go back to court again _ the ugly people are going to be back,'''
Mrs. Robertson said.
   Despite the protests, Mrs. Robertson said she's glad the family
relocated, and that they have received support from neighbors,
churches and a county AIDS-support group.
   ``My daughter plays with him (Jason),'' said Fredia Shimchick.
Schoolchildren ``are not going to be using his toothbrush. They're
not going to be having sex with him. They're going to be sitting in
a classroom with him. So what's the harm?''
   Conner said a review group, including himself, a school nurse
and a doctor, will decide Thursday night on Jason's placement.
   Based on Jason's medical and school records, the group could
decide to put the boy in a regular classroom or a special education
program, or offer him home or hospital instruction, Conner said.
   The superintendent said the school system will stay within the
law. ``This school district is not,'' he said, ``interested in a
legal battle over placement of this child.''

   Radical students hurled firebombs and
rocks at riot police today and defaced an Olympic flag during a
protest near a soccer camp used by Olympic teams.
   Riot police blocked about 300 students when they tried to march
out of Kyunghee University in Suwon, 25 miles south of Seoul.
   Protesters pelted the police with scores of firebombs and rocks
but did not break through the lines of troopers. The school is next
to a soccer training camp used by some Olympic teams, but it did
not appear to be in use at the time.
   ``Oppose the dictator's Olympics!'' the students shouted.
   Police said there were no arrests and no reports of injuries.
   Protesters marched to the school gate after a rally to denounce
the Games in Seoul. They scrawled slogans on an Olympic flag with
the five-ring symbol that had been torn down in a nearby street.
   The students then attacked the troopers blocking the way with
shields, pelting police with firebombs and rocks for about 10
minutes. Police hurled back some rocks, but did not counterattack.
   Riot police are under orders not to use tear gas during the
Olympics, especially near any of the Games' venues or facilities.
The Games run through Oct. 2.
   Radical students have mounted anti-Olympic protests to demand
the Games be shared with communist North Korea to help reunite the
divided Korean peninsula. The radicals also claim the Olympics are
being used to cement authoritarian rule in the South.
   Only a handful of hardliners have taken part in the protests and
support for them has dwindled in recent days. Most South Koreans
want the Olympics to be a success and have been critical of the
radicals' protests.
   North Korea is boycotting the Olympics because its demand to be
a co-host of the Games was rejected. The International Olympic
Committee said the Games are awarded to a single city and cannot be
shared.

   A Red Cross DC-3 transport plane
carrying relief supplies for Mozambique crashed on a farm near
Harare, injuring all three people aboard, police said today.
   The white DC-3 plowed through trees on the farm at Epworth
outside Harare on Tuesday.
   Police said one of the plane's two engines failed and the pilot
was looking for a place for an emergency landing when the aircraft
crashed.
   The three crew members who were injured and rushed to hospital
were not immediately identified.
   The Red Cross and other relief agencies often launch flights
containing food relief from Zimbabwe into Mozambique, its eastern
neighbor. Hundreds of thousands of Mozambicans face starvation as a
result of drought and civil war.

<HEAD>Bitterness And Civil Suits Linger After Federal Move Case Closed</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The decision to close a federal probe into
the fatal 1985 MOVE confrontation without indictments ends the
criminal investigation, but bitterness and civil suits linger in
the case.
   The U.S. Justice Department announced Tuesday that a grand jury
cleared Mayor W. Wilson Goode, other city officials and police of
criminal wrongdoing in the bombing of a west Philadelphia rowhouse.
   The police bombing _ approved by Goode _ and resulting fire that
officials allowed to rage out of control left 11 members of the
radical group MOVE dead and 61 homes destroyed.
   ``There's always going to be some nagging doubts about whether
justice prevailed in this case,'' said William H. Brown III, the
chairman of the mayor's special investigative commission, which
found Goode ``grossly negligent'' for his role in the events of May
13, 1985.
   Assistant Attorney General William Bradford Reynolds, head of
the Justice Department's civil rights division, said in Washington
that evidence was insufficient to seek indictments on any civil
rights violations.
   In a three-paragraph statement, the department said no report
will be issued by the federal grand jury that convened in
Philadelphia in April 1987. The panel based its inquiry on the work
of an FBI investigation launched in July 1985.
   A Philadelphia County grand jury in May strongly criticized city
officials for their handling of the confrontation but found no
reason to pursue criminal charges.
   District Attorney Ronald Castille, whose office presided over
the local investigation, said the federal decision ``confirms what
we said last May, that it was a series of tragic mistakes by
elected and appointed officials.''
   Goode was happy the investigation was completed.
   ``Two grand juries have fully investigated this matter and have
reached a point of no criminality involved. For that I am
pleased,'' Goode said.
   But others were angered by the federal grand jury's conclusion
and its decision not to release a report.
   Louise James, sister of MOVE founder John Africa, who died in
the blaze, said the investigations were prejudiced against MOVE.
   ``I said over and over that he (Goode) is a murderer and I'll
stick by that,'' said Ms. James, whose son also was killed in the
rowhouse.
   Added Brown: ``(To) deliberately place a bomb on that house ...
and having done that then make a decision to not put the fire out
and let it burn while children are in the house, if that's not
sufficient grounds to find that their civil rights were violated, I
don't what is.
   ``And to compound that by not even issuing a report to tell the
people how they came to their decision, I think is the height of
arrogance,'' he said.
   Five children and six adults died inside the barricaded rowhouse
when police bombed the dwelling to evict MOVE followers. The bomb,
dropped from a helicopter, contained the powerful military
explosive C-4.
   The bomb touched off a fire that raged out of control while
fireman held back, afraid they would be hit by gunfire that had
echoed through the poor neighborhood.
   Only two people escaped from the house: a woman known as Ramona
Africa and Michael Moses Ward, then 13 and known to MOVE members as
Birdie Africa. All MOVE members adopted the surname Africa and most
were black.
   Members of MOVE, whose name did not stand for anything in
particular, championed back-to-nature rituals, lived in filth,
refused to send their children to school and openly disobeyed
health and safety laws.
   Brown and Castille said civil lawsuits filed against city
officials by survivors and relatives of those who died would keep
the controversy alive.
   ``They all are going to have to face up to the very substantial
civil lawsuits,'' Brown said.
   Andino Ward, Michael Ward's father, said the federal decision
could strengthen the lawsuit filed on behalf of his son ``simply
because it may be the only viable alternative that will allow this
entire fiasco to come to the forefront and really name those who
should be named and held accountable for their actions in this.''

   Senate Republicans are stalling action on a
Democratic plan to raise the $3.35 minimum wage in high-stakes
parliamentary manuevering being played out against a backdrop of
presidential politics.
   The Republicans want a chance to add a lower pay rate for
unskilled workers and action on President Reagan's nominees to the
federal bench before Democrats can move on the first hike in the
minimum wage in eight years.
   ``Unless we see progress with the judges and keep our ability to
amend, we're going to be on the minimum wage a long time,'' Senate
GOP Whip Alan Simpson of Wyoming said Tuesday.
   Simpson made the comment following separate party strategy
luncheons after Democratic Leader Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia
filed a second cloture motion in as many days to limit further
debate on the bill by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass.
   According to the Senate Judiciary Committee, 25 nominations by
Reagan for federal judgeships are now pending before the panel and
four other nominations are on the calendar for Senate floor action.
   Kennedy's bill would raise the minimum wage by 40 cents an hour
each of the next three years _ to $3.75 in January, to $4.15 in
1990 and to $4.55 in 1991.
   Vice President George Bush's presidential campaign said Tuesday
that Bush likely would not unveil any specific minimum wage
proposal until after his debate this Sunday with Democratic nominee
Michael Dukakis.
   ``We're exploring a modest increase so long as it's tied to a
subminimum or training wage,'' said David Sandor, a Bush campaign
spokesman. ``But there's nothing scheduled for this week.''
   Bush's vice presidential running mate, Sen. Dan Quayle, R-Ind.,
offered an amendment in the Senate Labor Committee in July for
raising the minimum wage over two years to $4 an hour and coupling
it with an 80 percent subminimum for new hires.
   The minimum wage has been stuck at $3.35 since 1981, with the
Reagan administration contending for the past three years that any
increase would have to be coupled with a subminimum standard.
   The White House reiterated that position Tuesday, saying its
senior advisers would recommend that Reagan veto any minimum wage
increase that does not include a ``training wage at a rate
approximately four-fifths of the minimum wage for a specified
period of time.''
   ``The training wage would permit the administration to consider
a reasonable increase in the minimum wage that would not bring
about the unacceptable adverse economic effects'' of Kennedy's
bill, the White House said in a statement of administration policy.
   The White House listed the primary adverse effects as fewer new
job opportunities and higher inflation.
   Byrd stopped short of accusing Republicans of filibustering the
minimum wage bill, saying his cloture petitions were aimed only at
curbing unrelated amendments.
   The cloture motions, if approved by 60 senators in votes
scheduled for Thursday and Friday, would effectively require an
up-or-down vote on the minimum wage package.
   Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., complained that Byrd's parliamentary
maneuvers to force a vote would preclude consideration of
Republican amendments.
   The Senate Republican Policy Committee listed at least 14
possible amendments that GOP members had ready _ including removing
a 46-year-old government ban on apparel industry homework and
repealing the Davis-Bacon law requiring prevailing, union-scale
wages on government construction projects.
   ``We're ready to vote on amendments but we're not willing to let
them run all of their amendments and ignore ours,'' said Sen.
William Armstrong, R-Colo. ``That's the issue.''
   But the biggest GOP amendment _ to provide a 90-day, 80 percent
subminimum wage for new hires _ already is on the Senate floor,
although Democrats are blocking consideration of it through a
substitute by Kennedy to slightly expand a little-used 85 percent
subminimum for full-time students.
   Under the Senate's rules, if Kennedy's amendment is approved _
and he claims to have enough votes for passage _ the wider
subminimum proposal by Hatch would never come to a vote.
   ``If his passes, mine would be gone,'' Hatch said.
   Hatch, Quayle and Bush at various times have referred to the
Republican subminimum proposals as a ``training wage'' or a ``youth
training wage.''
   Kennedy, however, called Hatch's subminimum proposal a ``wolf in
sheep's clothing,'' saying it nowhere mentions nor requires any
training during the 90 days, nor does it make any age distinctions
in its application.
   He said the subminimum proposal effectively would eliminate any
immediate increase in the minimum wage, allowing employers to pay
the 80 percent subminimum indefinitely as long as there is high
employee turnover, such as exists in many fast-food jobs.
   ``The working poor ... who get caught up in the coils of the
so-called training wage get pushed 20 percent closer to poverty on
Day One and Bush-push into the unemployment lines on Day 91,''
Kennedy said. ``They'll get trained all right _ in destitution and
desperation.''

<HEAD>Jesse Jackson's Half Brother Charged With Murder For Hire</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GREENVILLE, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A prosecutor plans to seek the death
penalty against Jesse Jackson's half brother for allegedly hiring
members of a Chicago street gang to kill a man two years ago, a
newspaper reported today.
   Noah Robinson, a 45-year-old Chicago businessman and Greenville
native, was charged with murder Tuesday for the 1986 slaying of
Leroy ``Hambone'' Barber, who was shot outside a downtown building
owned by Robinson.
   Robinson turned himself in to police Tuesday evening and was in
the Greenville County Detention Center awaiting a bond hearing
today, Solictor Joseph Watson said.
   Although Robinson and Jackson share relatives in Greenville, the
former Democratic presidential hopeful has said he has had no
recent contact with his half brother.
   Robinson was the sixth person charged with murder for Barber's
slaying. Barber once worked for Robinson in Chicago and the two men
had had several altercations over the years, Greenville police have
said.
   Murder warrants were issued previously against five Chicago men:
Edgar Cooksey, Alan Earl Knox, Eugene Cleo Hunter, Henry Leon
Harris and Jackie Early Clay. Clay is a fugitive and the other four
are in police custody. Their ages were unavailable.
   Authorities have alleged that a five-member team from Chicago's
El Rukn street gang shot Barber in the head Jan. 2, 1986, after he
was called to a pay telephone outside a lounge in the Greenville
building.
   A former gang member, Tramell Davis, told authorities that the
leader of the El Rukns ordered Barber killed for harassing Robinson.
   ``Robinson's alleged involvement is he basically hired an El
Rukn hit team to come to downtown Greenville to kill Barber,''
Watson told The Associated Press on Tuesday.
   Watson would not comment further about the case and said police
were continuing their investigation along with the federal Bureau
of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms office in Chicago.
   The Greenville News quoted Watson today as saying he expected to
file in the near future notice of intent to seek the death penalty
against Robinson and ``other principal co-defendants'' because it
was a murder for hire.
   Calls by The Associated Press to Watson's home late Tuesday were
not answered.
   In a statement distributed Tuesday by the Rev. J.M. Flemming,
who accompanied him to the jail, Robinson said, ``I had no role in
or no knowledge of that killing prior to it happening.''
   In the statement, Robinson said the case against him was based
on statements by gang members with criminal records who were
offered cash and lenient sentences in exchange for testifying
against him.
   Flemming said Robinson was being treated unfairly.
   ``This ought not be taking place and would not be taking place
if Mr. Robinson was not a wealthy individual and a black individual
in the community,'' Flemming said.
   Robinson was charged in June with conspiring to kill Janice D.
Rosemond, who told a Chicago grand jury last fall that she
witnessed the 1986 slaying of Barber.
   Within weeks of her testimony, Ms. Rosemond was attacked in her
Greenville apartment. She survived five stab wounds and later
recanted her testimony about the Barber slaying, saying she had
been intimidated by police.
   Freddie E. Sweeney, who once worked as a janitor in one of
Robinson's companies, has been charged with assault and battery
with intent to kill Ms. Rosemond.
   Robinson and a former employee, Jake H. Oliver, are charged with
criminal conspiracy, intimidation of a witness, obstruction of
justice and accessory to a felony in connection with the stabbing,
and Robinson had been free on a $500,000 bond.

<TEXT>
   Authorities scouring a dry riverbed
discovered a fifth bus that was washed away in a flash flood
triggered by Hurricane Gilbert, and the confirmed death toll in the
disaster rose to 140.
   A ranching settlement of 100 families remained cut off from help
Tuesday by flooding and landslides in the mountains surrounding
this northern industrial center, said Nuevo Leon state government
spokesman Daniel Dimas.
   ``We're trying to find out what we can do to get supplies to
these people,'' he said.
   Authorities said the death toll from the flash flood in the
normally dry bed of the Santa Catarina River could go higher.
   ``We have recovered 140 cadavers. It's difficult to say how many
more there could be. It could be very terrible,'' Dimas said
Tuesday.
   He said most of the bodies were being found about 20 miles
downstream, and that wreckage of the fifth passenger bus was found
30 miles downstream.
   Earlier, authorities said they had recovered about 100 bodies
and estimated that 200 people were killed in the Saturday's
flooding.
   At least 31 people also died when Gilbert, the most intense
storm on record, ripped through the Yucatan Peninsula last week
with winds of up to 200 mph. The storm killed 30 people in Haiti,
26 in Jamaica, eight in Honduras and five in the Dominican Republic.
   Hurricane Gilbert dumped a foot of rain on Monterrey on Friday
and Saturday, sending a torrent through the Santa Catarina's
riverbed. The flash flood swept away four intercity buses and one
local bus traveling on roads built in the riverbed.
   Hundreds of homes were destroyed and thousands more flooded with
water and mud. About 30,000 people remained in shelters Tuesday,
and authorities estimated damage at $90 million.
   Some neighborhoods around the Monterrey area remained without
water due to damage to pumps. Health authorities recommended that
citizens boil water because of increased risk of viral and
bacterial infections in contaminated water.

<HEAD>Scientist Hints Of Medieval Origin Of Shroud Of Turin</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Laboratory tests of pieces from the Shroud of
Turin have dated it within a span of 200 years, a scientist told a
newspaper, hinting that reports in London that the revered relic's
origin was medieval were correct.
   Chemist Robert Dinegar refused to say directly whether tests
showed the cloth was as old as the first century, and thus possibly
the burial cloth of Jesus Christ, or dated from the Middle Ages,
which would make it a fake.
   The 14-foot-long shroud kept in Italy's Turin cathedral has long
been the object of devotion because it bears the image of a
bloodied, bearded man, suggestive of Jesus' crucifixion.
   In an interview published today by the Los Angeles Times,
Dinegar said he was told the date of the shroud by an authoritative
source but said he could not reveal it.
   Dinegar, an Episcopal priest and chemistry professor at the
University of New Mexico's Los Alamos campus, has taken part in
past research on the shroud but was not involved in the more recent
radiocarbon tests to date the relic.
   Asked to comment on British newspaper reports that the shroud
was medieval, Dinegar replied, ``I am ticked off with Oxford. These
leaks always come out of Oxford and they are always correct.''
   The radiocarbon tests on tiny pieces of the shroud were
conducted by separate teams of researchers at Oxford University,
the Federal Polytechnic in Zurich and the University of Arizona in
Tucson.
   Dinegar said all three laboratories obtained about the same
date, within a 200-year range, which had been the predetermined
limit for a valid finding.
   ``I assumed we would get three out of three because they are
excellent scientists,'' he added.
   A Roman Catholic Church-approved announcement of the results is
expected in the next few weeks.
   The Sunday Times of London, citing unidentified sources, said
this week that the tests revealed a date between 1100 and 1500.
   Another British newspaper said late last month that the tests
showed the shroud was made about 1350, the oldest known period of
references to the shroud, which was owned then by a French knight.
   Thomas F. D'Muhala, president of The Shroud of Turin Research
Project Inc. based in Hebron, Conn., said Tuesday that no one in
his group of more than 80 scientists has commented publicly on the
shroud's age or origin.

   Amateur astronomers in the Northern
Hemisphere are getting their best look at Mars in over a century as
the red planet makes its closest approach to Earth in years.
   ``This is a rare chance for people to take a look at a world
where humans may one day walk,'' said Susan Lendroth, spokeswoman
for the Pasadena-based Planetary Society, which is sponsoring
dozens of Mars Watch '88 public viewing parties and a formal
observation program by amateur astronomers.
   Mars will be at its closest to Earth at 11:18 p.m. EDT tonight,
when the two planets will be 36.54 million miles apart, said
astronomer Ed Krupp, director of Los Angeles' Griffith Observatory.
   That's the closest the two planets have been since they were
34.92 million miles apart in August 1971 and closer than they will
get until they approach within 34.65 million miles of each other on
Aug. 27, 2003. They sometimes are as many as 248 million miles
apart.
   Because Mars now appears much farther north in Earth's skies
than usual during such close encounters, views for Northern
Hemisphere observers will be better than at any time since 1875 or
until 2025, astronomers said.
   Telescope views are very good for more than a month on either
side of tonight's close approach, and Mars will rise earlier in the
evening in future weeks.
   Many viewing parties already have been held _ such as last
week's Mars Mania Star Party in Roseburg, Ore., and a Mars
Extravaganza in Birmingham, Ala., and others are scheduled through
October. Some 2,000 people have attended viewing parties throughout
Northern California.
   About 100 of the 500 amateur astronomers participating in the
worldwide Mars Watch '88 observation program have sent more than
1,500 photographs and sketches of the planet to Jeff Beish and Dr.
Donald Parker, official ``Mars recorders'' for a group named the
International Mars Patrol.
   It's now summer in Mars' southern hemisphere, and the southern
ice cap extends only to 81 degrees south latitude, much smaller
than during winter, when it sometimes stretches almost halfway
toward the equator, Beish said by phone from Miami, where he is an
Eastern Airlines flight simulator technician.
   ``The largest volcanoes can be identified by very experienced
telescopic observers using large instruments,'' Beish said.
``Sometimes I see Olympus Mons. That's the biggest one,'' three
times taller than Mount Everest.
   He said observers also ``are now seeing mountainous clouds. They
are round or oval-shaped white puffs. They're around the known
volcanoes.''
   Backyard astronomers in places such as Japan, Italy, New Zealand
and New Guinea also are seeing other Martian surface features now
that dust has settled from a June dust storm that measured 4,800
miles long by 2,500 miles wide, Beish added.
   ``They are seeing features that they've never seen before,''
including several long, dark streaks that appeared recently, he
said. ``Mars changes from minute to minute. There's always
something to discover.''
   Mars also can be seen with the naked eye, although surface
features aren't visible. For Northern Hemisphere residents, it
appears as a reddish-orange spot _ the brightest object in evening
skies _ low to the east-southeast after dark, about 45 degrees
above the southern horizon at midnight, and low in the
west-southwest before dawn.

   Hundreds of people spilled into the
streets of this capital to celebrate Costa Rica's first Olympic
Games medal _ the silver won by swimmer Sylvia Poll in the women's
200-meter freestyle.
   President Oscar Arias, winner of the 1987 Nobel Peace Prize,
told reporters before Tuesday's race that he would be glued to his
television set, cheering on the 6-foot-3 Costa Rican.
   Just before the race, the streets of San Jose appeared deserted,
and one television commentator asked viewers watching the
competition in Seoul, South Korea, to cross their fingers and wish
Poll luck.
   The silver medal in hand, hundreds rushed into the streets and
drivers honked their car horns to celebrate Poll's achievement.
   ``I was sure that Sylvia would win one of the three medals ....
It's like she said before she left Costa Rica: `I'll fight for my
country and all of Latin America,' and she did it tonight,'' said
Cristina Valvelde Vargas, 18, wiping tears from her eyes.
   ``Long live Costa Rica!,'' shouted one driver between blasts of
his car horn. ``They'll know who we are now,'' he said, alluding to
this democratic country's population of 2.5 million.
   Other celebrants embraced and shouted in San Jose's downtown
Cultural Park.
   Poll, 17, emerged as a world contender during the 1987 Pan
American Games in Indianapolis, where she won eight medals, three
of them gold.

   The last full day of summer saw the beginnings of blustery fall
weather with thunderstorms and showers sweeping through New England
and another storm system rumbling through the Southwest.
   Today is the last day of summer; autumn officially begins
Thursday with the autumnal equinox. The equinox occurs when
daylight hours nearly equal the hours of darkness. The moment the
sun appears to cross the Equator on its annual journey south occurs
at 3:29 p.m. EDT.
   Showers and a few thunderstorms this morning moved over New
England just ahead of a cold front extending from Vermont into the
southeastern part of the nation. Thunderstorms also rumbled through
New York City as well as Boston.
   A developing storm system over southern Nevada scattered showers
and thunderstorms over the southern Plateau and the southern
Plains. Thunderstorms delivered heavy rain to Carlsbad, N.M., late
Tuesday and early this morning.
   As much as 3 inches of rain was reported near Muleshoe, Texas.
Over 2 inches fell across Curry and Roosevelt counties in
east-central New Mexico. Street flooding was reported in Clovis and
Portales, N.M., as well as Elida and Artesia. Other showers and
thunderstorms were isolated over eastern Arizona and southern
Nevada.
   Today's forecast called for scattered showers and thunderstorms
through Utah and northern Arizona, Southern California, the
Colorado Rockies, New Mexico and southwest Texas; lingering showers
in New England; mostly cloudy skies covering the northern Plains,
the upper Mississippi Valley and most of Texas; and mostly sunny
skies over the rest of the nation.
   High temperatures were forecast for the 70s or 80s across much
of the nation; in the 50s over northern Minnesota and North Dakota;
the 60s over Nevada, northern parts of the Pacific Northwest, the
northern Rockies and from the northern Great Lakes into northern
New England; the 90s from eastern Texas through the lower
Mississippi Valley into the southern Atlantic region and Florida;
and the 90s over parts of the desert Southwest.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 35
degrees at Malmstrom Air Force Base near Great Falls, Mont., to 83
degrees at Phoenix.

   The dollar was trading steadily against major
currencies on quiet European markets today as players awaited U.S.
inflation figures and a Group of Seven meeting.
   Gold prices fell sharply, toward $400 an ounce, after a steep
decline in New York on Tuesday.
   Foreign exchange dealers said the dollar was expected to trade
in a narrow range in advance of the release at 11:30 a.m. (8:30
a.m. EDT) of U.S. consumer price index figures for August.
   Still, they said the market was unlikely to be much affected by
the figures, which were expected to show a small increase.
   Traders also were looking for some, but not much, guidance from
the meeting of finance ministers and central bankers from the Group
of Seven industrial countries in West Berlin on Saturday.
   Most players do not expect any change in present international
coordination policies, however, dealers said.
   In Tokyo, where the business day ends before Europe's begins,
the dollar edged up 0.03 yen to a closing 134.18 yen. Later, in
London, it was quoted at 134.15 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Tuesday:
   _1.8717 West German marks, up from 1.8641
   _1.5810 Swiss francs, up from 1.5740
   _6.3617 French francs, up from 6.3385
   _2.1069 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1075
   _1,391.25 Italian lire, down from 1,391.50
   _1.2180 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2203
   In London, the British pound was quoted at $1.679 dollars,
cheaper for buyers than late Tuesday's $1.6865.
   On the precious metals market, gold prices continued to slide
following the Tuesday drop in New York, which traders attributed to
a growing investor disillusionment with gold.
   They said there was sentiment against gold as a long-term
investment and as a hedge against inflation.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $402 a troy ounce,
sharply down from $410 bid late Tuesday. At midmorning today, the
city's five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of
$401.60.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $402.50, down from $410.50 bid late
Tuesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold dropped $7.74 to close at a bid
$405.38.
   Silver was quoted in London today at a bid price of $6.20 a troy
ounce, down from $6.36 bid late Tuesday.

<TEXT>
   The father of an 11-year-old
university graduate, who once said he wanted his son to win the
Nobel Prize by age 20, has been booked for investigation of felony
child endangerment, authorities said.
   The young scholar, Adragon De Mello, has been placed in
protective custody, police said Tuesday.
   Officers in this city 80 miles south of San Francisco searched
the home of Agustin De Mello on Monday after the boy's mother
reported that his father had made threats of violence. Police said
they found five loaded handguns and suitcases filled with
ammunition.
   In an affidavit with the search warrant, the mother, Cathy Gunn,
said De Mello had ``a suicide pact with his son in the past'' when
Adragon's academic career seemed to be in jeopardy, the Santa Cruz
Sentinel reported.
   But De Mello, free on $5,000 bail, was quoted in today's
Sentinel as calling the suicide-pact charge ``ridiculous'' and
dismissing allegations that he is a danger to his son as ``total
fiction.''
   ``I would never consider a death pact with my son. I love him. I
live for him,'' De Mello said in a telephone interview with the
Sentinel.
   De Mello does not have a listed telephone number and The
Associated Press could not reach him for comment.
   De Mello also said the guns seized from his house posed no
danger.
   After the search of his home, De Mello was taken to Dominican
Hospital for psychiatric examination. He was released Tuesday,
arrested and booked at Santa Cruz County jail, said police Sgt. Joe
Haebe.
   Adragon has received national attention since entering Cabrillo
College at the age of 9 and earning a bachelor's degree in
mathematics at the University of California at Santa Cruz last
spring.
   His father has boasted that his son spoke his first words at the
age of 2 months and began doing complex science and math as a
toddler. The 59-year-old unemployed father has said he wanted
Adragon to have two doctoral degrees by the age of 16 and a Nobel
Prize by 20.
   De Mello was quoted in today's Sentinel as saying his son had
been accepted to attend a graduate program on a scholarship at the
Florida Institute of Technology.
   The newspaper reported Tuesday that Monday's search followed
extensive police interviews with Gunn.
   Gunn said that she and De Mello never married, but she lived
with him and their son until being forced to leave last year, the
Sentinel reported.
   According to a police report cited by the paper, the 36-year-old
Gunn said she recently started legal proceedings against De Mello
over visitation rights to the boy. She said she feared De Mello
might try to harm her when he received the court papers.
   UC Santa Cruz math professor Ralph Abraham, a supporter of
Adragon, said De Mello loves his son too much to hurt the boy. ``I
have no fears about his care of Adragon,'' he said, although he
added that ``enormous stress has affected the father's stability.''

   Hurricane Helene formed early today in the central
Atlantic and forecasters say the ocean's fourth hurricane this year
has already begun to strengthen as it churns across open water.
   Helene, packing sustained winds of 85 mph, is the first
hurricane to form since Gilbert went on a rampage last week through
the Caribbean, Mexico and the Texas Gulf Coast.
   At 6 a.m. EDT, the center of Helene was located near latitude
12.1 north, longitude 39.3 west, or about 1,450 miles east of the
Lesser Antilles, a group of islands southeast of Puerto Rico,
according to an advisory from the National Hurricane Center.
   The storm, which registered 75 mph when it became a hurricane
early today, was moving west at 15 mph and maintain that course for
the next day or two with a good chance for further strengthening,
the advisory said.
   ``Conditions are quite favorable for it to pick up strength.
There's nothing to stop it way out there in the middle of the
ocean,'' said Stanley Wright, a meteorologist at the hurricane
center. ``But it's still way too early to tell if it will get as
big as Gilbert.''
   Meteorologist Randy Lascody said the path of Helene, the eighth
named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, cannot be projected
until it moves closer to the Caribbean.
   ``It's going across the warmest water of the year now, which is
perfect to fuel its growth,'' Lascody said. ``But it really would
be very premature to give a guess on what may happen. It still has
a long way to go.''
   Storms that form this month near the Cape Verde Islands off
Africa's coast are often the season's strongest because of ideal
hurricane-spawning conditions, forecasters say.
   Factors such as low-pressure zones in the Caribbean and
high-level winds will affect the storm's path, said Lascody.
   ``It looks like it will reach its make-or-break point sometime
later this week,'' he said.
   The depression that became Helene seemed disorganized when it
formed two days ago, but satellite photos showed circulation
improved.
   It will take about four days for Helene to get close enough to
the Caribbean to allow an Air Force reconnaissance plane to fly
over it. Until then, hurricane forecasters will have to rely on
satellite reports, said forecaster Miles Lawrence.
   Tropical storms are upgraded to hurricanes when sustained winds
reach 74 mph. In addition to Gilbert, which had top winds of 175
mph, two other much smaller hurricanes formed this season: Debbie,
which brushed the Mexican coast, and Florence, which moved over
Louisiana.
   The Atlantic hurricane season runs from June through November,
with September traditionally the most active month.

   The Soviet government has barred foreign
journalists from Armenia, where another rally was reported today
following the renewal of ethnic unrest and violence in the troubled
southern region.
   Andrei Silantiev, the Foreign Ministry official who informed The
Associated Press its correspondent was being barred from making a
scheduled visit to the region, would say only that the city ``is
closed for temporary reasons.''
   He refused to be more specific or to say that the resurgence of
ethnic unrest was behind the government's action. He said a group
of foreign journalists waiting in the nearby Georgian capital of
Tbilisi waiting for a flight to the Armenian capital of Yerevan
would be stopped.
   An Armenian activist reached by telephone in Yerevan described
the situation there as ``very, very tense.''
   Telephone operators meanwhile told the AP in Moscow that calls
to Stepanakert, the main city in a predominantly Armenian enclave
of Nagorno-Karabakh in neighboring Azerbaijan, would not be put
through for several hours. Some numbers reportedly were cut off at
a central switchboard.
   Rafael Popoyan, an activist reached at his home in Yerevan, said
a crowd of thousands had gathered in the town square to await an
announcement on the convening of the republic's parliament, which
repeatedly has demanded annexation of Nagorno-Karabakh, a move
rebuffed by the national legislature, the Supreme Soviet.
   Popoyan said a strict curfew continues in Nagorno-Karabakh. He
said some reports from the area say that water has been cut off,
but he has been unable to get telephone calls through for details
on the situation.
   He and Dmitri Volchek, an editor of the unofficial Moscow
journal Glasnost, reported that a bomb exploded Monday at a
dormitory housing Armenian construction workers in the town of
Abovyan, a few miles from Stepanakert.
   Popoyan said no one was was hurt, but a leaflet was found at the
site, saying the explosion was ``a present to residents of
Karabakh.''
   He said Soviet troops are in Yerevan, but ``they aren't very
visible, and they don't interfere.'' Police also have not attempted
to break up crowds or meetings, he said.
   But ``the situation is very, very tense,'' Popoyan said.
   Meanwhile, thousands of Yerevan residents who walked off their
jobs this weekend apparently continued their strike.
   When telephone calls were placed to the state-owned television
station in Yerevan and the local newspaper, Communist, a Yerevan
operator told a Moscow operator no one answered because everyone
was on strike.
   The troubled region was closed to foreign journalists for
several months following the outbreak of demonstrations and rioting
in February, but calm returned after the national Supreme Soviet on
July 18 formally rejected any redrawing of boundaries and announced
a crackdown on continued agitation.
   A few foreign journalists were permitted to visit the region
earlier this month.
   Last weekend, renewed ethnic violence reportedly broke out, with
Azerbaijanis and Armenians trading shots in a village inside
Nagorno-Karabakh.
   The official news agency Tass said 25 were injured, but Popoyan
said reports in Yerevan claimed as many as 70 were hurt.
   An editor of the official news agency Azerinform in Azerbaijan
said one man had died as a result of injuries suffered in the
weekend clash. The editor spoke on condition of anonymity.
   In February, at least 32 people were killed in ethnic riots in
Sumgait, an industrial city in Azerbaijan.

<HEAD>Earliest Equinox of the Century</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The date when daylight hours nearly equal
those of darkness occurs Thursday, as the autumnal equinox makes
its earliest appearance so far in this century.
   The moment of equinox, when the sun appears to cross the Equator
on its annual journey south, occurs at 19:29 universal time, which
is 3:29 p.m. EDT.
   Not since 1897 has the equinox come this early, reports LeRoy
Doggett, head of the Nautical Almanac Office at the U.S. Naval
Observatory.
   The equinox will occur even earlier in four years, when it comes
at 18:44 universal time on Sept. 22, 1992, and also at 18:01 on
Sept. 22, 1996.
   And in 2000, the equinox will edge all the way back to 17:29
universal time on Sept. 22 of that year.
   The tendency of the equinox to occur earlier will continue,
Doggett said, at least until the year 2100, when the absence of a
leap year will shift it to later dates again.
   The equinoxes are the days of approximately equal amounts of
daylight and darkness. Many people, including calendar makers,
arbitrarily consider the autumnal equinox the start of fall, and
the spring equinox the start of spring, although there are no
official definitions of those seasons.
   The four-year cycle of inserting an extra day in leap years
tends to cause back-and-forth shifts in the calendar dates of
natural phenomena such as the equinoxes and solstices.
   All this equinox shifting occurs because the Earth's actual year
doesn't come out to an even number of days.
   The Gregorian calendar, now in use, is 365 days long _ 366 in
leap years. The leap day added every four years means the calendar
year averages out to 365 days, 6 hours.
   But it takes 365 days, 5 hours, 48 minutes and 46 seconds to go
from one equinox to the next.
   That means there is a difference of 11 minutes and 14 seconds.
   That doesn't sound like much, but over the centuries it adds up.
   To compensate, the calendar skips leap days in most century
years. The year 1900, for example, was not a leap year.
   But there's an exception: Century years that can be divided by
the number 400 are leap years. So, the year 2000 will be a leap
year, getting an extra day.
   And that means the calendar year will be a little longer,
causing the equinox to occur a little earlier that year.
   Thus the equinox won't be able to head back to its later dates
until after the year 2100, which won't be a leap year since it
can't be divided by 400.
   Universal time is also known as Greenwich time. It is five hours
later than Eastern Standard Time and four hours ahead of Eastern
Daylight Time. Thus 3:29 p.m. EDT Thursday _ 15:29 on a 24-hour
clock _ is 19:29 universal time.

<HEAD>Backfire Helps Firefighters Divert Vacaville Blaze</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A backfire and favorable weather helped hundreds of firefighters
divert a 5-day-old blaze away from expensive northern California
homes. Near Yellowstone National Park, a pilot survived the crash
of his firefighting helicopter.
   Although the fire west and north of Vacaville, Calif., continued
to burn over a 32-mile area today, about 500 residents who had been
evacuated were allowed back into their homes Tuesday.
   The only uncontained portion of the blaze was in rugged terrain
in an unpopulated area, firefighters said Tuesday after completing
a 10-mile-long fire break just west of Vacaville and setting fire
to brush west of the break.
   ``The backfire operation was pretty darn successful,'' said Kirk
Landuyt, a California Department of Forestry spokesman. ``The wind
has cooperated,'' pushing the controlled fire into the blaze and
keeping it from reaching homes on the edge of Vacaville, he said.
   Elsewhere across the West on Tuesday, the situation was improved
as the worst summer for fires in three decades wound to a close. In
all, nearly 70,000 fires have been tallied, blackening more than
4.1 million acres, about half of them in Alaska.
   ``I think fire season is just about over here,'' spokeswoman
Madelyn Kempf said as crews broke camp and began departing from the
34,500-acre Red Bench fire in Montana's Glacier National Park. Some
200 firefighters also left Oregon's Willamette National Forest on
Tuesday, although others remained behind to finish firefighting
efforts there.
   In the Yellowstone National Park area, only three of 13 blazes
that charred 1.6 million acres remained uncontained, said park
spokeswoman Amy Vanderbilt.
   ``It's been a fairly quiet day in terms of fire activity,'' she
said. ``We've still got crews out there working on (fire) line
construction and mop-up efforts.
   A helicopter pilot trying to fill a water bucket from a pond
while working on a fire burning in Shoshone National Forest just
east of Yellowstone crashed upside down, but climbed safely out of
his aircraft, said fire information officer Chris Thompson.
   A rescue team found the pilot sitting on the bank of the pond,
Thompson said.
   The Vacaville-area blaze destroyed seven homes Sunday and did an
estimated $7 million damage Monday to a cluster of military,
government and private communications towers and facilities on a
hilltop within fire lines.
   As of Tuesday night, the fire near the city some 45 miles
northeast of San Francisco had burned 22,000 acres and was 60
percent contained by a force of 1,882 firefighters. Backfires were
expected to increase the amount burned to 28,000 acres, said
Forestry Department spokeswoman Lori Lippitt.
   Firefighters were optimistic about two other major northern
California fires Tuesday night.
   One blaze, about 20 miles east of Redding, was reported 80
percent contained by a force of nearly 1,200 firefighters. Since
the weekend, it had blackened 7,790 acres and destroyed 24 homes
and 34 other buildings.
   The other fire was being fought by about 600 firefighters in
steep hills on the eastern side of Lake Berryessa. It had burned
4,800 acres by Tuesday evening, but the only threatened structures
were scattered ranch buildings.
   ``We're really optimistic. The fire is beginning to die down,''
said Forestry Department spokesman Bruce Hagen.
   Gov. George Deukmejian on Tuesday proclaimed states of emergency
for Shasta County around Redding, and Solano County around
Vacaville, the first step in making state and federal aid available
to wildfire victims.

   Cartoonist F.O. Alexander, who created ``Joe
Doakes,'' the everyday citizen bearing a heavy tax burden, is
having a retrospective of his works just in time for the fall
elections.
   The late Hubert Humphrey and astronaut-turned-senator John Glenn
are just two of the politicians depicted in ``Off and Running:
Election Cartoons 1952-1967,'' at Temple University.
   But readers of the Bulletin newspaper, which stopped publishing
in 1982, may best remember the short, balding, ordinary Joe Doakes,
an extra-pleasant, super-modest common citizen who was usually
being squeezed by the tax man.
   Alexander drew a cartoon for the Bulletin's editorial page from
1941 until his retirement in 1967. His work was syndicated to
newspapers across the nation.
   Alexander said he tended to be more liberal than many of his
colleagues.
   ``I wanted to attack Joe McCarthy for a long time,'' he said.
``He frightened everyone.''
   After his first anti-McCarthy cartoon was published, ``I was
thought to be a pinko and Commie.''

   Flight attendant Uli Derickson
sobbed uncontrollably today as she recalled the 1985 hijacking of a
TWA jetliner, saying she is still haunted by the ordeal.
   Mrs. Derickson, the chief flight attendant aboard the airliner,
was testifying for a second day at the trial of Mohammed Ali
Hamadi, who is charged with hijacking the plane and murdering a
U.S. Navy diver.
   At least two hijackers held 39 Americans captive for 17 days.
   ``I suffered deep psychological effects, and I am still under
therapy,'' the German-born Mrs. Derickson testified, her shoulders
shaking with sobs.
   ``I can imagine everyone on that flight is suffering,'' Mrs.
Derickson told the court in German.
   Mrs. Derickson began crying as as she was cross-examined on
earlier testimony in which she described Hamadi pointing a gun at
her head.
   On Tuesday, Mrs. Derickson told how U.S. Navy diver Robert
Stethem ``never made a sound,'' as he bravely withstood the savage
beating of the hijackers before he was shot and killed in Beirut.
   She also described how passenger Kurt Carlson, a U.S. Army
reserve officer, was attacked by both hijackers. Although he was
severely beaten, Carlson survived.
   ``I was convinced he was dead, because I had to step over him
several times'' near the plane's cockpit, Mrs. Derickson said of
Carlson. ``But then I touched him and he moved.''
   The 44-year-old flight attendant said she told Hamadi about
Carlson's family, and Hamadi apologized to the beaten man, saying:
``I didn't mean to kill you.''
   Mrs. Derickson testified Tuesday that Hamadi held a gun to her
head to gain access to the cockpit when the jetliner was hijacked
June 14, 1985 on an Athens to Rome flight.
   Mrs. Derickson, a naturalized American citizen, told the court
Stethem was singled out because he carried a military
identification card.
   The hijackers ``took him up to the cockpit and started to
brutally beat him. They beat on him as long as he stood,'' Mrs.
Derickson said Tuesday.
   ``When Mr. Stethem collapsed, one of the hijackers took the
armrest of a seat _ it still had the screws sticking out of it _
and beat on him.''
   Mrs. Derickson said that after the beating, Hamadi turned to her
and said: ``Look at him now, he thinks he's so strong.''
   Recalling the beating Tuesday, Mrs. Derickson choked back sobs
and said: ``Mr. Stethem was a very courageous man. He never made a
sound.''
   She said Hamadi, who lived in West Germany from 1982 to 1984,
asked her to translate for him, because he spoke little English.
   Mrs. Derickson told the court that shortly after Stethem was
slain, Hamadi had a pistol in his hand and began beating another
U.S. Navy diver, Clinton Suggs. ``I pushed Suggs down between the
seats in first class and told him to stay there. Then I told the
hijackers to stop _ they had done enough.''
   John Testrake, the pilot of TWA flight 847, testified last week
that he believed Hamadi was the hijacker who shot and killed
Stethem. Hamadi has admitted taking part in the hijacking, but has
denied killing Stethem.
   During the hijacking, the plane was forced to land at Beirut
three times, and twice in Algiers. Stethem was slain when the plane
landed in Beirut the second time.
   Hamadi was arrested at Frankfurt airport on Jan. 13, 1987, after
customs officials found liquid explosives in his luggage. In the
week after his arrest, two West Germans were kidnapped in Beirut in
a failed scheme to win his release. Both captives have since been
freed.
   Hamadi's brother, Abbas, was convicted by a Duesseldorf court of
taking part in the kidnappings in an effort to free Mohammed.

<TEXT>
   Tawana Brawley, the black teen-ager whose
allegations of abduction and rape by a gang of white men sparked
months of controversy, has moved with her family to Virginia,
according to published reports today.
   The family has stayed out of New York for the past several weeks
to avoid the arrest of Tawana's mother, Glenda Brawley, who was
sentenced to 30 days in prison for refusing to testify before a
grand jury investigating her daughter's case. They were reported to
be living in a luxury apartment in Virginia Beach, Va.
   Following the advice of the Rev. Al Sharpton and lawyers C.
Vernon Mason and Alton Maddox, family members have refused to
cooperate with investigators. They maintain that minorities are
discriminated against in the criminal justice system.
   Ralph King, who lives with Mrs. Brawley, answered the phone at
the Virginia residence on Tuesday, The New York Times reported.
When asked if the family had relocated South, he replied: ``I'm
here, ain't I?''
   When asked if Miss Brawley had transferred to high school there,
King responded, ``I don't know. You'll have to find out. Come over
here and find out.'' According to the New York Daily News, Miss
Brawley is attending Floyd E. Kellam High School.
   The Brawleys' new home includes free racquetball, pool,
whirlpool, sun deck, jogging trail, volleyball and clubhouse, the
Daily News said. Apartments run from $550 to $600 monthly.
   Miss Brawley was found inside a plastic garbage bag last
November in Dutchess County with excrement smeared and racial
epithets written on her body.
   State Attorney General Robert Abrams was named special
prosecutor and a grand jury began investigating her charges, but it
has been thwarted by the family's refusal to appear before it.
   The grand jury is expected to issue a report on its seven-month
investigation within the next several weeks, but Abrams has said it
has not been able to substantiate Miss Brawley's claims. The jury
reportedly voted to subpoena the girl, but she has stayed out of
state to avoid being served with a summons to testify.
   Timothy Gilles, Abrams' spokesman, said the 30-day jail sentence
against Mrs. Brawley ``will continue to hang over her'' and the
state may consider extradition proceedings.

<TEXT>
   A first-grade boy who allegedly pulled a
gun and waved it around classmates will undergo a series of
psychological tests, officials said.
   The 7-year-old boy, who told investigators he brought the
.38-caliber handgun from home, was suspended immediately after the
Sept. 12 incident and was to have a disciplinary hearing today,
said John A. Stewart, superintendent of Polk County Schools.
   ``Expulsion may not be the best approach with a boy this age. He
wouldn't learn anything by expulsion,'' said Stewart, adding that
the normal punishment for bringing a gun to school would be
expulsion for more than a year.
   Stewart said the psychological tests will determine whether the
boy should be transferred to a school for children with emotional
problems.
   Polk Sheriff's Office spokeswoman Lynne Breidenbach said the gun
was apparently not loaded when he brought it to Crystal Lake
Elementary School in his knapsack.
   The boy showed the weapon to two other boys after gym class and
again displayed it while walking home with other students after
school, she said.
   Bill Duncan, who is in charge of discipline for the Polk County
school district, said that initial reports indicated that the boy
demanded a sexual favor from two girls.
   But sheriff's detective Paul Baggett said that did not appear to
be the case. He said the boy may have made a derogatory sexual
statement to a girl while the children were walking home, but his
statement was not a demand for sexual favors as school officials
first reported.
   Duncan said earlier: ``He did have a weapon there at the school
and he did threaten some girls with it. We know for a fact that he
had it because he admitted that he had it.''
   Baggett said he would not comment on whether the boy pointed the
gun at any of the children until he had discussed the case with a
prosecutor at the state attorney's office in Bartow.
   ``At this point, we have not charged him. We have not determined
that any violations have occurred,'' Ms. Breidenbach said.
``There's a big `if' about whether charges will be filed.''
   Crystal Lake Elementary School Principal W. James Pace refused
to comment.
   Don Woods, who supervises alternative education for the county,
cautioned against drawing conclusions before a hearing is held.
   ``Sometimes the stories come out quite different,'' he said.
``It might come out that it wasn't as serious as it sounded.''

<TEXT>
   Saw Maung, the general who seized power in
a weekend coup, was named prime minister today by the new
military-dominated government. Hundreds of people were reported
dead in a ruthless crackdown on dissent.
   The crackdown kept demonstrators off the streets for a second
day today. Pro-democracy activists were reported going underground.
   Government spokesman Kyaw San said troops killed 67 people,
wounded 34 and arrested 100 ``in the course of the government's law
and order restoration work'' in Rangoon and three other areas
Tuesday and today.
   That brought the official death toll to at least 144 people
killed since Saw Maung seized power Sunday to quell a countrywide
uprising against 26 years of authoritarian rule.
   But independent accounts say more than 200 people have been
killed. And some Western diplomats in Rangoon put the number dead
at up to 400.
   ``At Rangoon General Hospital, there were 200 corpses on Monday
night and that was only one hospital,'' said one diplomat, who
estimated there had been as many as 400 deaths in all.
   He said trucks loaded with bodies were seen after the height of
the shooting earlier in the week.
   In the heart of Rangoon today, troops conducted house-to-house
searches following a rocket attack against two key government
buildings.
   Gunfire was heard throughout the night but there were no
protests _ almost daily occurrences in Rangoon in recent weeks _ as
soldiers patrolled the city.
   ``They seem to have subdued the protesters pretty much,'' said a
Bangkok-based diplomat. ``It's a peasant army ... Their attitude is
that they have to follow orders. They trust their officers.''
   The diplomat said students, who have spearheaded the uprising,
were going underground and might resort to guerrilla tactics
against the 186,000-member military.
   One opposition leader, a student, said street protests had been
called off to avoid bloodshed. He and the diplomats spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   Open confronation between the army and protesters would be like
``a peashooter against a tank,'' another diplomat in Bangkok said.
   The authorities have been ``incredibly ruthless when you look
over the past month. It's breathtakingly, breathtakingly callous
behavior,'' the diplomat said.
   State-run Radio Rangoon said Saw Maung was chosen prime minister
by the nine-member government, or State Law and Order Restoration
Council, which he named on Tuesday. He also holds the posts of
defense and foreign minister.
   Only Minister of Health Pe Thein was a civilian, and at least
six ministers were among the 18 senior officers who mounted
Sunday's coup with Saw Maung. The broadcast also said local
military leaders will serve as top government officials in their
areas.
   Saw Maung is considered a right-hand man of toppled president
Sein Lwin, who was widely blamed for earlier suppression of dissent.
   Bloody rioting forced an end to Sein Lwin's presidency, which
lasted 16 days until Aug. 12. He had replaced Ne Win, who ruled
Burma since a 1962 military coup but stepped down in July.
   Ne Win is widely believed to be the power behind Burma's
government.
   Saw Maung said he mounted his coup, unseating civilian President
Maung Maung, to halt the country's social chaos and ensure
democratic elections.
   Maung Maung, Burma's first civilian leader in 26 years, had
given in to opposition demands to hold elections and to the
establishment of a multiparty system.
   A sticking point was the opposition's demand for an an interim
government before the elections.
   Today, the government spokesman cited more than a dozen
incidents in Rangoon involving bloody confrontations between
looters and troops. A Japanese Embassy official quoted a Rangoon
television report saying citizens had attacked at least three
police stations in the city and taken away more than 10 guns.
   Similar incidents were also reportedly occuring in other areas
of Burma, the official said.
   Radio Rangoon reported five separate incidents Tuesday in which
security forces killed 59 people, including looters, and injured
several others.
   In one case, troops killed 14 people when civilians assaulted a
military truck in an eastern section of Rangoon, the radio said.
   Troops on Monday killed at least 100 people protesting the coup.
   Senior opposition leaders issued a statement Tuesday appealing
for talks with Saw Maung to resolve the country's deepening crisis
and criticizing the military's crackdown on dissent.
   Burma has been in turmoil since students rioted last September
against isolationist government policies that have crippled the
economy.

<TEXT>
   The Red Army Faction, West Germany's
most notorious leftist terrorist gang, claimed responsibility for a
shotgun attack on a senior government official, authorities said
today.
   In a letter to a news agency in Bonn, the group said one of its
``commando squads'' attacked Hans Tietmeyer, one of Chancellor
Helmut Kohl's key advisers, on Tuesday for involvement in what the
group called ``imperialistic'' finance policies.
   Tietmeyer was not injured when his car was fired on near his
home in the Bonn suburb of Bad Godesberg. Officials said the attack
was apparently aimed at disrupting international finance talks that
begin this week in West Berlin.
   Government sources, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said
there were indications the attackers planned to kidnap Tietmeyer.
   Hans-Juergen Foerster, spokesman for the Federal Prosecutor's
office, said the letter claiming responsibliity was signed by a Red
Army Faction commando squad calling itself ``Khaled Aker.'' He said
it could not be immediately determined what that name symbolizes.
   The Red Army statement said Tietmeyer was ``responsible for
murder and massive misery in the Third World'' because of his
involvement in international policies governing financial
assistance for poor nations.
   Foester also said investigators have determined the pump-action
shotgun used in the attack was stolen by the Red Army Faction in a
1984 gunshop robbery. He said the weapon was found by federal
investigators near the area where Tietmeyer's car was fired upon
Tuesday morning.
   ``A loaded magazine for a machine pistol was found in the same
area,'' Foerster said.
   Tietmeyer is a state secretary in the West German Finance
Ministry and advises Kohl on international finance.
   Foerster said the attack appeared to be connected to the World
Bank-International Monetary Fund conference in West Berlin, which
begins with preliminary talks Thursday.
   Security officials say the Red Army Faction has about 20 members
and several hundred sympathizers. It has been responsible for a
series of arson, bombing and assassination attacks against
government, industrial and military targets since its formation in
the early 1970s.
   The Red Army Faction claimed responsibility for the 1986 murder
in Bonn of West German diplomat Gerold von Braunhuehl.
   The 57-year-old Tietmeyer has been involved in planning for the
World Bank-IMF meeting. He is also deputy governor for the IMF in
West Germany.
   Up to 40,000 leftist protesters are expected in West Berlin
during the Sept. 27-29 talks to demand better treatment by the
world's industrial nations of poorer, heavily indebted countries.
   West German security officials have warned that militant
protesters could cause trouble during the talks.
   Heavy security has been put into place in West Berlin for the
financial discussions and several people have already been placed
in ``preventive detention,'' said a police spokesman. He refused to
say how many people had been detained and declined to identify them.

<HEAD>Harry Helmsley Seeking Out of Tax Case for Medical Reasons</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Real estate billionaire Harry Helmsley, facing a
tax evasion trial with his wife next week, has health problems that
could have him removed from the case, his attorneys say.
   The disclosure came Tuesday during a hearing where U.S. District
Judge John Walker agreed to unseal transcripts of previous
closed-door hearings concerning Helmsley's health.
   Helmsley, 79, and his 67-year-old wife, Leona, the self-styled
``queen'' of the Helmsley hotel chain, were indicted in April on
state and federal charges. They are accused of hiding some $4
million in renovations to their Greenwich, Conn., mansion as
business expenses and taking bogus tax deductions.
   The Helmsleys have pleaded innocent to the 188-count state
indictment and the 47-count federal indictment. State prosecutors
have agreed to let the federal case go first.
   The Associated Press and several other news organizations had
petitioned Walker to release the sealed papers. At the start of the
hearing Tuesday, the judge said he would ``permit the unsealing of
all records except grand jury materials.''
   Walker said the material to be unsealed within ``the next day''
concerned ``the physical condition of Mr. Helmsley and whether he
is fit to stand trial.'' His attorneys would give no details of
Helmsley's medical condition.
   In other pre-trial action, attorneys for the Helmsleys moved to
have their clients' case heard separately from their two former
aides. Walker also delayed decision on relocating the trial to
Philadelphia due to potentially prejudicial pretrial publicity.
   Defense lawyer Gerald A. Feffer said the Helmsleys need a
separate trial from defendants Joseph V. Licari and Frank J. Turco
because the Helmsleys plan a conflicting defense.
   The Helmsleys will charge that the pair, onetime Helmsley
employees, created false invoices in order to cover up their own
thefts, not to help the Helmsleys defraud the government of tax
revenues, Feffer said.
   The Helmsleys are slated to go on trial next Monday, but
Assistant U.S. Attorney James DeVita asked for a three-week delay
so government experts could evaluate Helmsley's health records to
see if ``more medical examinations are warranted.''
   Walker said he would decide Thursday on DeVita's request.
Helmsley's chief lawyer, John Wing, said he had no objection to the
delay although he doubted further tests would reach a different
result.
   Neither of the Helmsleys was present at the hearing.

   A couple poured serum they thought was
contaminated with the AIDS virus into self-inflicted cuts in a
suicide pact after the man stole the serum from an unlocked
hospital freezer, authorities said.
   Eric Henriques and his wife, Dawn, who have a history of mental
problems, were rushed to Denver General Hospital after the incident
Monday night, officials said Tuesday.
   Authorities said both cut themselves near the wrist and elbow
and then apparently poured the blood serum onto their arms.
   Police said Henriques took the serum, which carried labels
warning of AIDS contamination, from a Denver General Hospital
freezer and brought it home.
   Hospital officials did not know if any of the 21 vials of stolen
blood serum were drawn from AIDS-infected people. They ordered the
basement freezer locked after the incident.
   Some of the samples, drawn from a number of people during AIDS
testing in 1986, may have contained AIDS antibodies. But the deadly
virus cannot be passed through antibodies alone, hospital spokesman
John Head said.
   The presence of antibodies means that a person has been exposed
to the AIDS virus, but it does not mean that the person has AIDS.
   ``There's virtually zero chance of contamination,'' Head said.
   The woman summoned officers after the suicide attempt.
   Henriques, 24, was being kept in the hospital mental health ward
Tuesday, while his 36-year-old wife was being treated at another
mental health facility.
   ``He seems to be obsessed by committing suicide by infecting
himself with AIDS,'' Head said.
   The man may be charged with misdemeanor theft, police said.

   Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis is deriding
Republican George Bush's record as one of such neglect and
indifference to the needy ``that even the American flag can't
hide'' his shortcomings.
   Dukakis challenged his GOP presidential rival on Tuesday to come
out ``from behind the flag'' and tell the voters what he proposes
to do about health care for Americans who can't afford it.
   Dukakis said he wants to guarantee them all health insurance,
beginning with legislation to require that all employers offer
basic coverage to working people and their families.
   He was announcing another health care proposal today, this one
to offer prenatal and infant care for all, guaranteed by the
government. That was to be announced in Dukakis' one campaign
appearance of the day, at Brigham and Women's Hospital, near his
Brookline home.
   The Massachusetts governor and his wife Kitty, who is Jewish,
wished ``a very happy and healthy New Year'' to their friends in
the Jewish community on Yom Kippur, the holiest of Jewish holidays.
   They issued a message vowing their support for peace between
Israel and its Arab neighbors, respect for human rights, the right
of Soviet Jews to emigrate freely and for ending ``all forms of
racism, bigotry and anti-Semitism and discrimination'' in the
United States.
   Dukakis said Tuesday his ultimate goal is universal national
health insurance, to match the program he signed into law in
Massachusetts less than six months ago.
   ``The simplest and the fairest and the most affordable first
step toward that goal is to require all employers, with some
exceptions for small businesses, to provide basic health insurance
for their workers and dependents,'' the governor said at Western
Kentucky University in Bowling Green, Ky.
   Dukakis said his first-stage program wouldn't cost the federal
government anything _ and could actually save money by reducing
expenditures for uninsured patients.
   He offered no figures on the cost to employers.
   The Dukakis campaign said it had no firm cost estimates,
although issues adviser Christopher Edley said the employer phase
of the Massachusetts system will cost employers about $1,000 a year
for each newly-insured worker.
   Dukakis kept his focus on selected themes during a two-day
southern swing that ended Tuesday night. In Little Rock, Ark.,
Houston and Kentucky, he talked about economics, then energy, then
health care.
   Dukakis sought to turn Bush's Pledge of Allegiance issue into a
boomerang, taunting his rival for flag-waving. The vice president
has assailed Dukakis for his 1977 veto of a bill to require
Massachusetts schoolteachers to lead their pupils in the pledge
each day.
   At the time, Dukakis cited a court ruling that the legislation
was unconstitutional.
   The Democratic nominee said the vice president isn't talking
about problems such as health care for people who can't afford it
and don't have adequate insurance.
   ``Today he's visiting a flag factory,'' Dukakis said
sardonically. ``Mr. Bush, don't you think it's about time you came
out from behind that flag and told us what you intend to do to
provide basic health care for 37 million of our fellow citizens?
   ``The fact is that he has no plan, but he does have a record _ a
record of indifference, a record of neglect, a record that even the
American flag can't hide.''
   Dukakis said that from now on, he intends to stick to his own
issues agenda, and leave it to his aides and allies to reply to
accusations by Bush and other Republicans.
   ``We're going to make sure that's the message, not some
response,'' he said.
   In Little Rock, Dukakis had listed an agenda of designated
issues for the campaign weeks ahead, among them opportunities and
work for people on public assistance, programs to ease the
insecurity of the elderly and proposals to make good housing
affordable to all Americans.
   Even so, the Dukakis organization was having some problems
executing the plays in its new game book. His health care proposal,
not brand new but packaged and promoted as a major campaign
initiative, was presented at a dawn briefing in Houston by Dukakis
advisers. Then Dukakis went to a Houston hospital, dramatizing the
issue in a discussion of health care and insurance costs with a
dozen patients and family members in a cancer ward waiting room. He
told them he'll do something about the problem ``if all goes well
on the eighth of November ... Spread the word.''
   But the candidate didn't get around to making his centerpiece
speech on the subject until hours later.
   Most of Dukakis' time during the next four days was set aside
for debate practice. The Democratic nominee was looking at likely
issues and, with his aides, rehearsing questions that may be put by
panelists when the candidates meet in Winston-Salem, N.C., Sunday
night.
   Dukakis' flight home from Bowling Green was detoured for an
unscheduled maintenance stop at Dulles International Airport
outside Washington, D.C. A landing light had to be repaired before
the Presidential Airways jet could go on to a night landing in
Boston.

<HEAD>`Clicks' On Crash Tape May Indicate Plane's Flaps Were Improperly
Set</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A preliminary analysis of evidence in the crash of
Delta Flight 1141 shows the jet's wing flaps may have been lowered
for takeoff but in an improper position, according to a report
published today.
   The Dallas Morning News quoted a source familiar with the
investigation as saying that analysis of the plane's cockpit voice
recorder picked up the sound of two ``clicks.''
   Some investigators say the clicks could be the sound of the crew
moving the Boeing 727-200's flap-selection lever, first to the
2-degree setting and then to the 5-degree position. The lever
should have been moved a third time to the 15-degree angle, the
report said.
   Federal investigators have previously targeted the flaps in a
search for the cause of the Aug. 31 crash, which killed 14 people.
They have been trying to determine whether the plan's flaps,
movable surfaces on the wings that provide extra lift, were
extended in their proper 15-degree position at takeoff.
   ``What you hear (on the tape of the cockpit conversation) are
two `clicks' in quick succession,'' the newspaper quoted the source
as saying. ``That means that the flaps were at least at the
5-degree setting.
   ``If it's 2 degrees or 5 degrees or 15 degrees, there are
differences'' in the way the plane flies, the newspaper quoted a
safety board official as saying.
   ``The question of whether there would be noticeable differences
... all of this will have to be determined through performance
analysis of the aircraft.''
   The plane's flap control lever has notches that could produce
clicking sounds as the lever is moved, the newspaper said.
   ``Obviously, if they (the crew) thought they were at one flap
setting when in fact they were at another, there could be
problems,'' another NTSB official was quoted as saying.
   But a safety board investigator cautioned that the sounds on the
voice recorder had not yet been fully analyzed.

   Frustration over having to draw up an
unemotional report on the homeless and then go into streets where
people were ``ravaging garbage cans'' prompted dissent by most of
the report's authors, one of them said today.
   Phyllis Wolfe, executive director of a private health care
program for the homeless in the nation's capital, said that while
gathering information for the report, panel members became outraged
at conditions they found.
   ``It could just not be left in dots and dashes and graphs and
figures,'' Ms. Wolfe said on ``CBS This Morning.''
   Ms. Wolfe joined eight other members of the committee formed by
the National Academy of Sciences' Institute of Medicine in issuing
a supplementary statement that the institute refused to include in
its report published Monday.
   The published report, ``Homelessness, Health and Human Needs,''
calls the growing number of homeless children ``a national
disgrace.'' It recommends such measures as changing food stamp
programs, increasing Medicaid services and expanding programs that
help pre-school children.
   The authors of the supplementary statement said recommendations
in the report were too limited. They said the country should supply
more low-income housing, raise the minimum wage, offer more support
services and guarantee homeless people adequate health care.
   Nine members of the 13-member panel signed the supplementary
statement saying the main study ``fails to capture our sense of
shame and anger about homelessness.''
   The original report estimates that families with a total of
100,000 children are homeless on any given night, in addition to
countless children who have run away from home or been kicked out
by their parents.
   It says those under 18 are the fastest growing homeless group,
and homelessness is increasing in many rural areas as well as in
the nation's cities.
   Ms. Wolfe said the committee's work on the report was ``very
structured,'' but members found themselves ``leaving committee
meetings and walking by and seeing people ravaging garbage cans,
seeing people suffering on the street.''
   The supplementary statement itself expresses the same sentiment:
   ``We have reviewed the demographic and clinical data and then,
walking home, passed men asleep on heating grates or displaced
people energetically searching in garbage piles for a few cents'
income from aluminum cans,'' it says.
   ``We analyzed mortality data for the homeless but lacked any
platform from which to shout that our neighbors are dying
needlessly because we are incapable of providing the most basic
services.''
   ``We can no longer sit as spectators to the elderly homeless
dying of hypothermia, to the children with blighted futures
poisoned by lead in rat-infested dilapidated welfare hotels, to
women raped, to old men beaten and robbed of their few possessions,
and to pepole dying on the streets with catastrophic illness such
as AIDS,'' the supplementary report said.
   It said the committee members who dissented against the report's
limited nature endorsed its long list of recommendations, but
``felt continuously uneasy because of our inability to state the
most basic recommendation: homelessness in the United States is an
inexcusable disgrace and must be eliminated.''

<HEAD>Gunfire In Beirut, Leaders Meet Damascus</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Amin Gemayel of Lebanon met
with President Hafez Assad of Syria today in an effort to avert a
political crisis that threatens to plunge Lebanon into renewed
civil war.
   Gemayel's unannounced visit came on the eve of a scheduled
session by Lebanon's parliament to elect his successor. Other top
Lebanese leaders also came to Damascus for the talks.
   As Gemayel entered closed-door talks with Assad to end the
political deadlock over the election, Lebanese police reported that
gunfire erupted around the entrance to the parliament building in
Moslem west Beirut.
   A police spokesman, who cannot be named under standing
regulations, said Christian snipers opened fire from positions on
the city's dividing Green Line.
   Soldiers of the army's predominantly Shiite Moslem 6th Brigade,
guarding the entrance, dived for cover inside the building. There
was no immediate word of any casualties.
   Gemayel, whose 6-year term expires Friday, flew to Damascus in a
military helicopter and was met at the airport by Assad.
   In Beirut, Telecommunications Minister Joseph Hashem said
Gemayel, accompanied by former Foreign Minister Elie Salem, went to
Damascus after a telephone conversation with Assad.
   Syrian officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Lebanon's acting prime minister, Salim Hoss, and Parliament Speaker
Hussein Husseini arrived in Damascus later and met with Syria's
vice president, Abdul-Halim Khaddam.
   The Lebanese Forces, Lebanon's main Christian militia, today
declared support for veteran politician Raymond Edde in the
presidential race to challenge two Syrian-backed candidates, former
President Suleiman Franjieh and parliament deputy Mikhail Daher.
   Lebanese sources said Franjieh was likely to withdraw his
candidacy in favor of Daher.
   The Lebanese Forces and other Christian groups oppose Franjieh
and Daher, who are both pro-Syrian Maronite Catholics.
   Edde, who is also Maronite, is an outspoken critic of foreign
intervention in Lebanon. He has vowed he will seek to force the
Israelis out of south Lebanon within 20 days if he is elected.
   The Lebanese Forces militia, sympathetic to Israel, opposes
Syrian intervention in Lebanon. The Syrians have 40,000 troops in
eastern and northern provinces as well as in west Beirut.
   The Christians have charged that Daher made ``written
commitments'' to Damascus, giving the Syrians military privileges
in Lebanon and pledging to give majority Moslems a bigger share in
running the country.
   The Christians also have charged that Franjieh will transform
Lebanon into a ``Syrian satellite.''
   The Christians have wielded political power since independence
from France in 1943, when they were considered to be the majority.
Moslems now comprise an estimated 55 percent of Lebanon's 4 million
population.
   Under an unwritten national covenant dating from independence,
the Lebanese president must be a Maronite, the prime minister a
Sunni Moslem and the parliament speaker a Shiite.
   Christians and Moslems have been fighting a civil war in Lebanon
for 13 years. The war has ravaged the economy and split the once
prosperous nation into numerous fiefdoms controlled by guerrilla
bands.

   Blond, blue-eyed baby Stephen smiled and
played with a stuffed bear as police and social workers tried to
figure out who he is and how he wound up among the city's homeless.
   The child, 8 to 10 months old, was found Friday in a van parked
near Civic Center. A woman living in the van said she had been
given the baby by another woman who had gotten him from still
another adult, police said Tuesday.
   The parents on Thursday asked a man identified only as Tom to
``care for Stephen for a few hours,'' said police Sgt. Holly Pera.
The couple never returned.
   Police held a news conference Tuesday appealing for help in
identifying the child.
   The Department of Social Services receives six to eight
abandoned baby cases a month, but most are infants left at a
hospital or brought in by relatives, said program Director Eurtha
Trammell.
   Social workers said the baby is healty, alert and well cared
for. He is being kept in a foster home.

   Fat briefing books are ready and surrogates
are primed, as Michael Dukakis and George Bush settle into four
days of intensive preparation for their first presidential campaign
debate.
   Between now and 8 p.m., EDT, Sunday, when they square off at
Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, N.C., Dukakis and Bush
will cram like college students.
   Each will field questions on a wide range of issues, their
answers weighed by political and media advisers.
   Richard G. Darman, former deputy treasury secretary, and Robert
Barnett, a Washington lawyer, were geared to assume their roles as
the opposition candidates in debate rehearsals.
   Darman, a protege of Bush campaign chairman James A. Baker III,
will play the role of Dukakis in mock debates that will probably
take place at the vice president's residence.
   Barnett has experience portraying Bush in debate rehearsals. He
helped prepare Geraldine Ferraro for her debate with the vice
president in October 1984.
   Thomas Donilon, a top official of Walter F. Mondale's campaign
four years ago, was coordinating debate preparation for Dukakis.
   Dukakis aides reviewed tapes of the Massachusetts governor's
debates with his rivals for the Democratic presidential nomination,
as well as Bush's Republican debates and his confrontation in 1984
with Ferraro.
   A key element of the preparation for the first debate is the
effort to lower expectations.
   ``Dukakis is a good debater,'' Bush told reporters recently on
his campaign plane. ``He is a professional college debater and I'm
not.''
   Bush campaign manager Lee Atwater said, ``After all, he
(Dukakis) made a living debating on television professionally for a
couple of years ... Facts are facts. Dukakis' strongest suit is
debate format.''
   ``Remember, Bush has the experience of these debates, the '84
debate, which is the only relevant experience,'' said Leslie Dach,
a Dukakis campaign spokesman.
   During the Democratic and Republican primary season, both men
debated and for the most part came out ahead of their opponents.
   Bush was back in Washington. Except for a trip to Houston for a
$5 million fund-raising dinner on Thursday, the vice president
planned no other campaigning before the debate.
   Dukakis was in Boston also concentrating on debate preparation.
   Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey was flying to Boston on Thursday
to join the Dukakis debate preparation. The senator also was
expected to take part in sessions with Dukakis on Friday.
   ``He's being asked to input on substance and on strategy,'' said
Bradley spokesman Nick Donatiello.
   Dukakis has consulted Bradley frequently in recent months on
foreign policy and financial affairs.
   Bush was conferring with domestic affairs adviser Deborah
Steelman and foreign policy adviser Dennis Ross.
   While the candidates concentrated on the issues, their
representatives still argued over last minutes details such as the
makeup of the panel of questioners and the height of the podiums.
   Bush aides want the podiums to be 46 inches minimum; the Dukakis
camp was demanding a maximum height of 44 inches. The argument
reflected the fact that Bush is 6-foot-1, while Dukakis is
5-foot-8. Today's decision: Bush's podium will be 48 inches,
Dukakis' 41.
   As for the panel, the Dukakis staff proposed that television
anchors from ABC, NBC, CBS and CNN serve as the moderator and three
questioners for the first debate, with a panel of print journalists
filling those roles for either the vice presidential or the second
presidential debate.
   All sides agree that the first debate is the critical one, the
one that gives voters their first impression of the two candidates.
   ``The largest national audience of the campaign will focus on
and take the measure of these two people,'' said Paul Kirk Jr.,
Democratic Party chairman.
   ``Tens of millions of people are going to watch and they're
going to form their opinions by themselves,'' said Dach. ``In the
primary debates very few people watched and opinions were formed by
the next day's headlines.''
   Rich Bond, a senior Bush aide, said: ``You want to avoid costly
mistakes. And you want to come across as presidential.''
   In recent weeks, Bush has surged in the polls. Months earlier,
Dukakis had a big lead in the same surveys.
   If those fluctuating numbers are a sign of the volatility of the
electorate, the debate could be crucial.

   Hundreds of thousands of Armenians massed in front
of their republic's parliament building today to renew their
demands for the annexation of Nagorno-Karabakh, an activist said.
   ``There are hundreds of thousands of people in front of the
Supreme Soviet. The avenue is completely closed to traffic,'' said
Arpenay Popoyan, wife of activist and former political prisoner
Rafael Popoyan.
   Armenian Communist Party and government officials were meeting
inside the building in Yerevan, capital of the Armenian republic.
   Communist authorities had promised to report to the people later
today about what decisions had been taken in the quest to annex
Nagorno-Karabakh, a mountainous region of neighboring Azerbaijan
that is predominantly Armenian.
   ``The people are waiting,'' Mrs. Popoyan said. ``The city is
very tense. All the people are on the streets.''
   A general strike that began Friday was continuing, she said.
   The Soviet government closed Armenia to foreign journalists amid
the rising tension and the renewal of ethnic unrest and violence in
Nagorno-Karabakh.
   Andrei Silantiev, a Foreign Ministry official, would say only
that Yerevan ``is closed for temporary reasons.'' Associated Press
correspondent John-Thor Dahlburg and other foreign correspondents
waiting in the Georgian capital of Tbilisi were being barred from
making a scheduled visit to the region.
   Silantiev refused to be more specific or to confirm that the
resurgence of ethnic unrest was responsible for the government's
action.
   One man was killed and at least 25 were hurt Sunday in a
shoot-out between Armenians and Azerbaijanis in the village of
Khadzhaly, the official Soviet news agency Tass said.
   There were rumors in Yerevan about more fighting between
Armenians and Azerbaijanis, but that none of the rumors had been
confirmed, Mrs. Popoyan said.
   Telephone calls to the official media in Yerevan did not go
through. Neither did calls to Stepanakert, the main city of
Nagorno-Karabakh.
   Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh and in Armenia want to annex the
region, but Azerbaijan and the central Soviet government have
rejected the idea.
   The Supreme Soviet building, where Yerevan residents were
gathering, is located on Prospekt Bogramyana about two blocks from
the central square where Armenians have massed regularly since
February to press their demand to annex Nagorno-Karabakh. The
headquarters of the Communist Party Central Committee is located
nearby, Mrs. Popoyan said.
   Yerevan residents were seeking a new session of the Supreme
Soviet, their republic's parliament, to press the national
government to approve the annexation. The Armenian Supreme Soviet
approved such a demand in June, but the Azerbaijani Supreme Soviet
did not go along, and national authorities also rejected it.
   Rafael Popoyan said Tuesday that a third of the members of the
Supreme Soviet had signed a request for a session, and that by law
it would have to be held.
   He said Nagorno-Karabakh was under a strict curfew and
``Azerbaijanis ring'' Stepanakert. He said some reports from the
area say water has been cut off, but he has been unable to get
telephone calls through for details on the situation.
   He and Dmitri Volchek, an editor of the unofficial Moscow
journal Glasnost, reported that a bomb exploded at a dormitory
housing Armenian construction workers in the town of Abovyan, a few
miles from Stepanakert.
   Popoyan said no one was was hurt in the blast Monday, but a
leaflet was found at the site saying the explosion was ``a present
to residents of Karabakh.''
   He said Soviet troops are in Yerevan, but ``they aren't very
visible, and they don't interfere.'' Police also have not attempted
to break up crowds or meetings, he said.
   The region was closed to foreign journalists for several months
following the outbreak of demonstrations and rioting in February.
Thirty-two people were killed in ethnic rioting in Sumgait, an
industrial city of Azerbaijan, at the end of February.
   A measure of calm returned after the national Supreme Soviet on
July 18 formally rejected any redrawing of republican boundaries
and announced a crackdown on continued agitation.
   A few foreign journalists was permitted to visit Yerevan earlier
this month before the city was closed again.

   The 20th suspicious fire in Jefferson
since May has damaged an unoccupied log cabin under construction,
police said today.
   The fires have unnerved the small White Mountains town of 900
people, and many families remain awake through the night and keep
firearms loaded.
   The latest fire, reported Tuesday night, extensively damaged the
inside of the 1{-story cabin 10 miles from the center of town,
police said.
   Before Tuesday, most recent fire was a blaze that damaged a home
Aug. 23.
   The rash of fires began in brush and fields but soon moved to
homes and barns. No one has been badly injured or killed, but
several families have been left homeless.
   Authorities have refused to divulge many details of their
investigation, but Jefferson's 32 volunteer firefighters and 12
other people have taken polygraph tests.
   Two fires deemed suspicious also have broken out in neighboring
Lancaster, one Aug. 11 in an abandoned farmhouse and one the next
day in a vacant downtown building.

   The county has issued a health alert to
doctors because of an outbreak of Legionnaire's disease that killed
seven people at a retirement home and the UCLA Medical Center, a
published report said today.
   The Department of Health Services asked doctors to watch for
serious pneumonia-like symptoms in patients who are elderly or
whose immune systems are not functioning properly, the Los Angeles
Times reported.
   The alert was issued July 29 and continues through this month.
   The notice was a routine precaution because no evidence points
to an ongoing problem, said Dr. Shirley Fannin, director of the
county's disease control program.
   Legionnaire's disease, similar to pneumonia or a debilitating
flu, is caused by the Legionella bacteria, so named because 29
infected people with the bacteria died after an American Legion
convention in Philadelphia in 1976.

   Part of the negotiations for Sunday's debate
between Democrat Michael Dukakis and Republican George Bush came
down to a spat over a few inches _ resolved today with a compromise
that will have the candidates standing at lecterns of different
heights.
   A Bush campaign source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
it was agreed that the tall, lanky Bush would stand behind a
48-inch-high lectern after his negotiators insisted he would stoop
no lower than a 46-inch one.
   Dukakis, who stands five inches shorter than Bush, will stand at
a 41-inch lectern with ``some kind of riser'' for him to step on,
according to the Bush source.
   Dukakis aides did not immediately return a call today to comment
on the agreement.
   The two sides have yet to agree on the moderator and three
panelists to question the candidates during the debate at Wake
Forest University in Winston-Salem, N.C.
   Dukakis had suggested television anchors from ABC, CBS, NBC and
CNN while the Bush campaign said that was unfair to print
journalists and proposed a list of 10 journalists and four
moderators from which to pick the panel.
   As for the lecterns, Dukakis campaign chairman Paul Brountas had
said Tuesday night that the bipartisan commission arranging the
debate had agreed on heights of 42 inches. Brountas said that on
Tuesday the Bush campaign officials asked that the height be raised
to 46 inches because the vice president would have to crouch at a
42-inch podium.
   Brountas said that if the podium height was to be raised to 46
inches the 5-foot-8 Dukakis would insist on using a riser. Bush is
6-foot-1.
   The Bush source gave a different account, saying the Republican
nominee usually speaks at a 52-inch podium but had agreed to come
down to 46 inches.
   ``This was already decided by the commission,'' Brountas said.
   The Bush source said the commission may have agreed to that but
that podium size was a negotiable item in the debate talks.
   Bush was not insistent that the two candidate use the same
height podium, but the Bush source said Dukakis had been.
   The Dukakis camp's request for a riser, the Bush source said,
introduced ``the issue of artificiality.''

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Supporters of mutinous soldiers
agreed today to meet with Haiti's new leader, who is trying to stop
an insurrection in the armed forces that began after a coup placed
him in power.
   The meeting was announced after soliders ousted four more
commanders in the military, workers struck state-run companies and
street battles occurred as Haitians released pent-up rage at three
decades of authoritarian rule.
   Sporadic gunfire continued throughout the capital today, four
days after low-ranking soldiers toppled the regime of Lt. Gen.
Henri Namphy.
   But it was quiet downtown this morning, and a demonstration
scheduled in support of the rebellious soldiers was rescheduled for
Thursday after its organizers announced they would meet later today
with the leader of the revolt, Sgt. Joseph Heubreux and the new
president, Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril.
   The decision was praised by a political leader, Christian
Democrat Sylvio Claude, who was quoted on Radio Lumier as saying,
``The emotions of the people are overheated. This is not the moment
for a demonstration.''
   Radio reports told Tuesday of a spreading rebellion, with troops
removing their commanders and reprisal killings by mobs supported
by soldiers.
   ``I'm afraid we're on the eve of another insurrection,'' a
government official, who demanded anonymity, said Tuesday.
   Avril, who declared himself president Sunday after the coup,
tried to end the unrest by appointing a new armed forces chief and
announcing the retirement of eight generals. But radio stations
said the revolt in the 7,000-member army spread because Avril had
not fired commanders the soldiers identified with the corruption
and repression of earlier governments.
   Soldiers broadcasting from radio stations _ something unheard of
before the coup _ said they identified themselves with the
downtrodden of Haiti. Several repeated on the air: ``The army is
the people, and people are the army!''
   The coup leaders have demanded that Avril reorganize the
military and institute democratic reforms including free elections,
which Haiti has not had for 31 years. On Nov. 29, armed thugs
killed more than 30 people at polling stations in thwarting
independently run elections.
   Radio stations said Tuesday that mutinying soldiers had ousted
the commanders of the navy, port and airport security, the 300-man
Leopards Batallion, and the Artibonite Department, a region north
of Port-au-Prince.
   Workers at the state-owned electricity company, port authority
and flour mill struck to force the removal of their managers, radio
stations said.
   Workers looted and tore apart the house of Jean-Claude Souriac,
head of the electric company, while two armed soldiers stood by,
witnesses said.
   The flour mill manager also was removed, radio stations said.
The managers' fates were not known.
   Radio stations said gunmen killed four people in apparent
reprisal for atrocities linked to Namphy's government, including
the Sept. 11 massacre of 13 people during a Mass celebrated by a
politically active Roman Catholic priest.
   Ten other people have been reported killed since the coup, which
sent Namphy into exile in the Dominican Republic.
   Port-au-Prince Mayor Franck Romain, accused of ordering
opposition leaders killed, took refuge in the Dominican Embassy.
   On state television Tuesday night, the government announced in a
communique that it had retired eight generals, including Maj. Gen.
Williams Regala, who was ousted as interior and defense minister
after the coup and has not been seen since, and Brig. Gen. Carl
Michel Nicolas, former army chief of staff.
   The communique said four officers were promoted.
   Avril said Tuesday he was aware of ``numerous problems'' within
the armed forces, but urged his troops ``to stay calm.'' At a
ceremony outside the National Palace, he appointed a new armed
forces commander-in-chief, Maj. Gen. Herard Abraham, who was
foreign minister under Namphy.

   The girlfriend of Robert T'Souvas, the
homeless man and My Lai massacre veteran who was shot to death
earlier this month, faces a homicide charge in the killing.
   Allegheny County Deputy Coroner Arthur Gilkes ruled Tuesday that
there was sufficient evidence against Kathlynn T'Souvas, 36, in the
death of Robert T'Souvas. She was charged with criminal homicide.
   No trial date has been set.
   Robert T'Souvas, 39, was shot to death Sept. 3. He had served in
Vietnam and was among those charged in the 1968 massacre at the
village of My Lai. The charges later were dropped.
   Police Detective Robert McCabe said the homeless woman admitted
shooting T'Souvas in an argument over a bottle of vodka.
Pathologist Christoper Biwojno said Robert T'Souvas was ``acutely
intoxicated'' at the time of his death.
   Ms. T'Souvas, who took T'Souvas' name even though they were not
married, was drinking beneath the Smithfield Street Bridge with him
and another homeless man, David Bozic, 42, authorities said.
   The three entertained themselves by shooting rats and cans with
Bozic's .22-caliber handgun. At some point, Bozic went for food.
   T'Souvas was lying on his side with a bottle of vodka between
his legs, when Ms. T'Souvas ``picked up the gun and said she wanted
the vodka,'' McCabe said. ``He mumbled something and she shot him
in the right side of the face behind his ear.''

   An American translator for Radio Free
Europe died shortly after being found stabbed in a park, police
said.
   Police said they found John Soper, 40, while patrolling a
downtown park at 1:30 a.m. Tuesday. He had three stab wounds in the
stomach and was taken to the hospital, where he died, police said.
   Soper, who was in Istanbul for a language conference, worked for
Radio Liberty, a section of Radio Free Europe, which is based in
Munich, West Germany, according to police and the staff of the
hotel where he was staying.
   They said the Indiana-born linguist, who arrived here Sunday,
left his hotel to go for a stroll around 11 p.m. Monday. When he
didn't return after midnight, friends notified the police.
   Police said they did not know who might have killed Soper or why.
   Barbara Sinclair of Indianapolis, a cousin of Soper, said the
U.S. State Department has notified Soper's parents, Mr. and Mrs.
Quentin F. Soper of Indianapolis, of his death.
   Soper was able to speak and read Russian, French and Uzbek, the
predominant language of Turkic people who live mainly in the Uzbek
republic of the Soviet Union.

   Black activist Winnie Mandela
said today U.S. officials have imposed restrictions on three
anti-apartheid leaders holed up in the U.S. Consulate since their
escape from detention last week.
   Mrs. Mandela, wife of jailed African National Congress leader
Nelson Mandela, commented after visiting the three men at the
consulate in a Johannesburg office building.
   She said U.S. officials in Washington were refusing to let the
three communicate directly with the news media, a condition which
they initially agreed to but now want to change. ``We would like to
see the Americans a little more committed than they are,'' she said.
   A U.S. Embassy spokesman, Barry Walkley, said his government was
concerned with the well-being of the activists ``and at the same
time with maintaining the appropriate posture of a diplomatic
mission.''
   ``Establishing a media forum is incompatable with either the
concept of temporary refuge or the functioning of a diplomatic
mission,'' he said.
   ``We agreed that they can convey messages through their legal
representatives. However, using their legal representatives as
intermediaries for interviews goes beyond that agreement.''
   Elsewhere, 11 activists reportedly were detained under
state-of-emergency regulations in Cape Town, where a national
anti-apartheid conference is planned this weekend. In the port city
of Durban, police said 160 people were arrested after hundreds of
striking black dockworkers went on strike.
   Encamped at the U.S. Consulate are two leaders of the banned
United Democratic Front _ Murphy Morobe and Mohammed Valli Moosa _
and the chairman of the banned National Education Crisis Committee,
Vusi Khanyile. They slipped away from guards Sept. 13 at a
Johannesburg hospital.
   They have remained at the consulate despite a government promise
that they will not be arrested or restricted if they leave, and
have called for the release of all political detainees.
   Mrs. Mandela said the three are wary because of a threat by
South African authorities immediately after their escape. She said
the government said it would take ``the most severe measures''
against the men unless they agreed to leave the country.
   Lawyer Essa Moosa said activists taken away from their homes
today included Trevor Manuel, 32, Cape Town leader of the United
Democratic Front. Manuel was detained without charge in August 1986
and was placed under severe restrictions when released in July.
   The detained activists reportedly included at least two whites,
an Indian, several blacks and people of mixed-race.
   Police declined to confirm the detentions, but did report on the
Durban dock strike. According to police, the arrests in Durban came
after strikers, many of them carrying sticks and pipes, staged an
illegal gathering.
   The strike began Tuesday to protest the dismissal of a worker
and to demand higher pay.
   Initial reports from lawyers and relatives indicated nine
activists were detained in Cape Town. But Frank Meintjies of the
Congress of South African Trade Unions said 11 United Democratic
Front activists were detained.
   The anti-apartheid conference is to be held Saturday and Sunday
at the University of Cape Town and is sponsored by the Congress of
South African Trade Unions, the country's largest labor federation.
   Organizers are seeking to bring together about 75 opposition
groups, ranging from white, liberal Parliament members to
organizations that advocate black self-reliance.
   ``This is not a conference of people who necessarily agree on
everything,'' Meintjies said. ``But they all agree that the
apartheid problem should be done away with once and for all.''
Under apartheid, South Africa's 26 million blacks have no vote in
national affairs, which are controlled by the 5 million whites.
   State-of-emergency regulations in effect since 1986 restrict
reporting about security force actions and treatment of detainees,
but enforcement of the rules has not been comprehensive.

   Spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Reagan placed the call about

   Fitzwater said the president described the pact as ``an historic

   He said Mulroney ``was optimistic'' about prospects for approval
in the Canadian Parliament.
   ``The agreement proves that trade barriers can be negotiated

   He said Reagan added that he expects to receive the agreement
from the Senate in the next few days for his signature.

   Democratic vice presidential nominee
Lloyd Bentsen today proposed a $100 million plan to bolster rural
health care, including federal subsidies to financially troubled
hospitals threatened with closure.
   Speaking in a high school auditorium in this West Texas town of
2,300 people, the Texas senator said rural hospitals are shutting
down and farmland residents are ``terrorized by the prospect of
illness.''
   ``Millions of Americans in rural areas are being denied one of
the basic necessities of life. They are losing their access to
quality health care,'' he said.
   ``It means that some children die who could have been saved. It
means illness lingers that could have been cured.''
   The day after Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis announced a
plan to require employers to provide health insurance coverage for
all workers, Bentsen outlined these proposals aimed directly at
rural health care:
   _A ``hardship fund'' to subsidize rural hospitals in danger of
being closed.
   _Expansion of the National Health Service Corps, which provides
scholarship assistance to medical, dental and nursing students who
agree to serve in rural areas.
   _Increased federal subsidies for nursing education.
   _Restoration of federal funds for migrant and community health
centers.
   Bentsen said the Reagan administration had slashed the last
three programs. His campaign staff estimated that all four programs
would cost $100 million.
   The senator said ``it's sure obvious we have a problem'' in
rural America under the Reagan administration, which he said ``has
done nothing to turn it around.''
   ``We have not seen a single proposal from them to stem the tide
of hospital closures in rural America,'' he said.
   Bentsen stressed health care today after touring depressed oil
areas of Texas and Oklahoma on Tuesday and stressing Dukakis'
promise to bolster the energy industry.
   Dukakis on Monday evening told oilmen in Houston that his
administration would get the wells pumping again, even if that took
government subsidies. And he announced that Bentsen would lead the
drafting of a national energy policy, including movement toward
further deregulation of natural gas.
   Bentsen followed up on Tuesday by going to Longview, Texas;
Oklahoma City; and Odessa, Texas, to deliver the message on a more
local and personal level, with rallies, a forum and interviews with
local news media.
   ``The Republicans like to ask: Are you better off today than you
were in 1980? They had better not ask that question in Oklahoma or
Texas, because the answer is no,'' he said at the Oklahoma rally,
making the first appearance in that state by either Democratic
candidate.
   And taking a page from the Republican strategists, the Bentsen
campaign did not schedule any wide-open news conferences Tuesday or
today, so as not to compete with the message Dukakis was trying to
convey.
   While trying to run what the Democrats say is a positive
campaign on the issues, Bentsen has been taking sharper shots at
Republican Dan Quayle, George Bush's running mate. In attacking
Quayle on Tuesday, Bentsen rhetorically scored the Reagan
administration's record on energy issues.
   ``I tell you, their record is as empty as Dan Quayle's resume,''
he said, getting his biggest applause from more than 1,000 people
at the rally in Oklahoma City.

   Michael Dukakis challenged Republican rival George Bush to spell
out his health insurance program for American workers while
negotiators for the two candidates wrangled over panel members and
lectern heights for the upcoming presidential debate.
   One issue, at least, appeared settled today when a Bush campaign
source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said it was agreed that
Bush would stand behind a 48-inch-high lectern after his
negotiators insisted he would stoop no lower than a 46-inch one.
Dukakis, who is five inches shorter than Bush, will stand at a
41-inch lectern.
   Meanwhile, Dukakis' running mate, Sen. Lloyd Bentsen announced a
program to improve rural health care today, saying, ``Millions of
Americans in rural areas are being denied one of the basic
necessities of life: They are losing their access to quality health
care.''
   Bentsen, in an appearance in Hale City, Texas, said that if
elected he and Dukakis would work for the plan including a
``hardship fund'' to subsidize rural hospitals that are threatened
with closure and expansion of a national program providing
incentives for doctors and nurses to work in rural areas.
   President Reagan was asked today at the White House whether he'd
given Bush any hints about next Sunday's debate.
   ``Take no prisoners,'' Reagan responded with a chuckle.
   The Democratic nominee, who offered his own health care plan
Tuesday, called on Bush to step out ``from behind the flag'' and
address the issue of providing health care to the 37 million
Americans who are unable to afford it.
   The vice president spent the day touring a flag manufacturing
company in Bloomfield, N.J., where he told employees, ``My friends,
flag sales are doing well and America is doing well.''
   Bush's own political fortunes received a boost from the latest
ABC News-Washington Post poll. The survey of 1,271 likely voters
found that 70 percent consider the GOP nominee to be a known
quantity compared with 54 percent who said they didn't know enough
about Dukakis.
   The poll, conducted Wednesday through Monday, also found the two
candidates in a near dead heat with Bush leading Dukakis 50 percent
to 46 percent. The margin of error of three points either way
virtually negated the lead.
   A similar ABC-Post poll released last week found Dukakis holding
a slim three-point lead.
   Bush was taking a day off from campaigning today to prepare for
Sunday's debate with Dukakis in Winston-Salem, N.C. _ the first
face-to-face encounter between the two contenders.
   A mock debate with former Deputy Treasury Secretary Richard G.
Darman standing in for Dukakis and Bush working on responses to
issues questions, with advisers giving their assessment, were on
the vice president's agenda, according to aides.
   Dukakis was introducing another health care plan _
government-guaranteed pre-natal and infant care for all, tending to
statehouse duties in Boston and preparing for the debate.
   Bush's running mate, Dan Quayle, was flying to Arizona to visit
an award-winning elementary school before travelling to the
California cities of Fresno, Bakersfield and Los Angeles.
   Negotiations on debate logistics hit a snag Tuesday as the two
presidential campaigns failed to agree on the height of the
lecterns and the composition of the panel.
   Paul Brountas, chairman of the Dukakis campaign, said Tuesday
that the bipartisan commission handling the debate had agreed on
podiums 42 inches high. But Bush campaign officials, according to
Brountas, asked that the podium height be raised to 46 inches.
   The two sides also failed to agree on the makeup of the panel,
with Dukakis suggesting television anchors to question the
candidates and the Bush campaign proposing print journalists.
   While the debate over the debate continued, Dukakis used
campaign appearances in Bowling Green, Ky., and Houston to propose
a broad health care plan beginning with the 22 million Americans
who have no insurance. That would leave 15 million or more
Americans still awaiting protection, campaign aides said.
   ``The simplest and fairest and the most affordable first step
toward that goal is to require all employers, with some exceptions
for small businesses, to provide basic health insurance for their
workers and dependents,'' Dukakis said.
   The plan, similar to one Dukakis signed into law in
Massachusetts less than six months ago, would not cost the federal
government anything, he said. Dukakis did not provide figures on
the cost to employers.
   In announcing the program, Dukakis also issued his challenge to
Bush, saying, ``Don't you think it's about time you came out from
behind that flag and told us what you intend to do to provide basic
health care for 37 million of our fellow citizens?''
   Bush campaign spokesman Mark Goodin branded the Dukakis proposal
``socialized medicine'' and said, ``such is a prescription for
financial disaster. The Dukakis plan would put the American economy
in the hospital and would list it in critical condition.''
   Questioned about the lack of health insurance for millions of
Americans, Quayle suggested experimenting with letting small
businesses ``buy into the Medicaid program'' to cover their workers.
   The GOP vice presidential candidate told about 600 students at
the University of Nevada-Las Vegas that a Bush administration will
guarantee a college education for anyone who wants it.
   ``We understand the importance of higher education, and we're
going to make sure that anybody who wants to go to higher education
will have access to higher education, no matter what,'' he said.
   Quayle's Democratic counterpart, Bentsen, told voters in
Oklahoma that a Dukakis administration would use tax incentives and
other subsidies to revive oil production in the Southwest.
   He also said Dukakis will ``light a fire'' under federal
regulators blocking the sale of natural gas to the Northeast.

   The new education secretary, Lauro Cavazos,

   ``I really bring no agenda other than to try to advance
education in America,'' Cavazos, sworn in on Tuesday, told a news

problems.''
   Cavazos repeated his pledge to support programs to help educate
people so they reach his or her full potential.
   Cavazos is the first Hispanic member of the Cabinet.
   Although President Reagan leaves office in four months, Cavazos
said he would concentrate on the question of ``how do we position
this nation to be competitive at the turn of the century, and I
don't just mean economically. Rather, let us look to make sure
every person in America today is educated to his or her fullest
potential.''
   Cavazos said no deal has been struck for him to remain in office
if Republican presidential nominee George Bush wins the November
election.
   Asked by a Spanish-language about problems facing Hispanic
children, Cavazos said in Spanish that his biggest such concern is
keeping Hispanic youths in school.
   Answering another question, Cavazos said in Spanish and English
that he supported bilingual education programs but believes the
emphasis should be on helping students learn English as quickly as
possible.
   ``My goal is to make that person competent as quickly as
possible in English,'' he said.
   On Tuesday, Reagan called the 61-year-old Cavazos _ who is
president of Texas Tech University and a registered Democrat _ ``a
sterling example of the magnificent contributions Hispanic
Americans have made to our national life.''
   ``Larry Cavazos has already made a major contribution to
American education,'' Reagan said. ``He brings to his new post a
record of solid accomplishments that promises even bigger
contributions in the future.''
   Bush gave Cavazos the oath of office as Cavazos' wife, Peggy,
held the family bible. The couple's 10 children also attended the
East Room ceremony.
   Cavazos said Reagan's leadership and commitment to education had
``truly helped this country make significant gains and strides,''
but added, ``We must awaken America to renew its commitment to
education'' to help all citizens reach their potential.
   Some Hispanic leaders have questioned the timing of Reagan's
decision to nominate Cavazos in the waning months of his
administration, suggesting he was courting Hispanic votes to
bolster Bush's Republican presidential candidacy in Texas, a key
battleground against Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis.
   ``I think the people see it for what it is,'' said Rep. Albert
Bustamante, a San Antonio Democrat and chairman of the
Congressional Hispanic Caucus.
   Bustamante said voters will focus on ``more substantial issues
like cutbacks in education that occurred under this administration
... and then they'll decide and then they'll not be for Bush'' and
his running mate, Sen. Dan Quayle.

   Hundreds of angry blacks looted or burned
stores and held off authorities with rocks and bottles early today
after a black man was fatally shot in what one witness described as
a drug deal gone sour, police said.
   Two white females were arrested after the shooting at a park,
described by police as an area with drug problems. One of them,
Tamala C. Vergo, 17, was later booked on a charge of second-degree
murder, according to police records.
   Police would not elaborate on the murder charge. The other woman
was questioned but not immediately charged.
   During the rock-throwing, a seven-block area was cordoned off
and police warned motorists to stay away. Police Chief Charles
Gruber said the crowd could have been as big as 1,000 people at the
height of the disturbance, but most estimates put the figure
between 300 and 500 during most of the evening.
   This northwestern Louisiana of 250,000, the state's second
largest after New Orleans, has been the scene of recent racial
tension stemming from a shooting of a black teen last month. But
police said drug problems may also have fueled the disturbance.
   A man who identified himself as a cousin of shooting victim
William David McKinney said that McKinney was a bystander to a drug
deal that went sour. The man, who would give his name only as
Charles, talked to reporters after being interviewed by detectives
as a witness to the shooting.
   Charles said a woman had tried to buy some cocaine from a group
of men, and when they ran away with her purse, she ``took out her
frustration'' by shooting at McKinney.
   McKinney, 20, of Shreveport, died at 12:10 a.m. today of a
gunshot wound to the head, police said.
   Reba White, 22, said she was at a convenience store when the
shooting happened in the nearby park about 9:45 p.m. Tuesday. The
rock-throwing started when officers took the two women inside the
store and a crowd gathered outside, she said.
   ``That's when the riot happened,'' she said. ``They were
throwing bottles and anything that was there.'' She said the
shooting victim lived in the area and those throwing rocks were his
friends.
   The disturbance was not brought under control until about 3
a.m., said police Sgt. Rick Ware. Police said early today that four
people were taken into custody in connection with the riot, but
Ware said there was no record of charges being filed by late this
morning.
   The building housing the convenience store and a liquor store
was burned to the ground. Looting or fires were also reported in
another convenience store, a service station and a second liquor
store.
   No police or demonstrators were reported seriously injured,
although some were treated at hospitals and released, authorities
said. Several were hit by rocks and bottles.
   Gruber said a brick came through the windshield of his car,
which was also hit by automatic weapons fire, but he said he was
not hurt.
   A car owned by KTBS-TV was set ablaze, while a fire truck that
arrived to fight the blazes was attacked by protesters, who beat it
with bats and clubs after firefighters abandoned the vehicle,
according to reporters at the scene.
   About 200 police were called in, Gruber said, including
reinforcements of state troopers, sheriff's deputies, and officers
from nearby Bossier City. They pulled back during the melee and did
not fire their weapons, Gruber said.
   ``We chose to let it cool off,'' he said. ``We felt our presence
would do nothing but accelerate it.''
   Community leaders rushed to the area to help get the crowd under
control. Mayor John Hussey, Gruber and other city officials met
with black community leaders late this morning to try to head off
any further trouble, police said.
   ``We've had considerable drug problems in this area,'' said
Gruber. ``I think that's something that might be fueling this.''
   During the disturbance, some in the crowd shouted ``Hot
Biscuit,'' the name of a restaurant where a white man fatally shot
a black teen-ager Aug. 4.
   Five white men were arrested in that case. One of the five
admitted to the shooting, but said it was self-defense. That man is
being held on $250,000 bond on second-degree murder charges.
Charges against three of the others were dropped in return for
their cooperation.
   The earlier shooting enraged Shreveport's black community, but
black ministers urged their congregations to let authorities handle
the investigation.

   The (Baltimore) Sun on gun control:
   The House of Representatives shamelessly caved in to the
political muscle of the national gun lobby when it rejected a
modest measure that would have required a seven-day waiting period
for the purchase of handguns.
   The vote put House members on record against virtually every law
enforcement organization in the country, groups that had pleaded
for this measure known as the ``Brady Amendment'' to assist them in
their jobs. ...
   But the House refused to listen, and the reason is transparent
and deplorable.
   There is no sound argument against a cooling off period. It
would have caused only minor inconvenience to law-abiding citizens,
who could pick up their guns in a week, but would have made it
difficult for criminals to walk into a store and get a handgun with
ease. ...
   Yet, the House buckled under pressure from the well-heeled gun
lobby and voted 228-182 against the Brady amendment.

   The Birmingham (Ala.) Post-Herald on gun control:
   Well, all those hunters can relax. It appears that the federal
government is not going to make them wait seven days to get a new
or used handgun.
   The National Rifle Association convinced the House of
Representatives ... that it would be discommoding, not to mention
unAmerican, to require a prospective purchaser to wait a whole week
to pick up a pistol. ...
   The waiting-period legislation was cast aside. ... In its place,
the House substituted an amendment calling on the Justice
Department to develop a system under which gun dealers could
identify felons who seek to buy handguns.
   The chances of the department fashioning a reasonably efficient
system is doubtful. And even if it does, there's nothing in the
amendment that says it should be put into effect.
   Thanks to the well-heeled gun lobby, over-the-counter,
no-questions-asked sales of handguns can continue.

   Fort Lauderdale (Fla.) Sun-Sentinel on the coup in Haiti:
   Haiti, the most improvished nation in the Western Hemisphere,
may be pathetically short of food, jobs and opportunity, but it
seems to possess an inexhaustible supply of military strongmen.
   Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril, a former adviser to the ousted regime of
Jean-Claude (Baby Doc) Duvalier, seized power from Lt. Gen. Henri
Namphy on Sunday after a revolt by noncommissioned officers in the
Presidential Guard. ...
   About the best the administration can do at this time is to lead
an international effort to isolate Haiti's corrupt military clique
until moderate elements in the armed forces or a true popular
uprising can prevail.

   Rochester (N.Y.) Democrat and Chronicle and Times-Union on
Social Security:
   When it comes to federal budget deficits, baby boomers should be
demanding more than platitudes from the presidential candidates.
   The reason? The deficits ... endanger the Social Security
benefits the boomers are entitled to.
   Here's the problem. Back in 1983, Congress and the Reagan
administration wisely acted to save Social Security with sharply
higher taxes _ enough to build up $3 trillion in reserves for the
74 million baby boomers who'll start retiring in 2010. ...
   By law, the Treasury must use all available revenue before it
borrows money to cover the deficit. In return, the Social Security
system gets government IOUs, theoretically payable on demand. ...
   The solution ... is to eliminate or radically shrink the
deficit. Then the surpluses could be used to buy back the national
debt from the private citizens and foreign investors who now hold
government bonds. ...
   So it's up to the boomers. If they don't demand change, the next
president and the next Congress may follow the path of least
resistance _ and take the security out of Social Security.

   The Commercial Appeal, Memphis, Tenn., on Congressional pensions:
   Want to retire with a million-dollar pension? Get elected to
Congress and stay there a while.
   The National Taxpayers Union, which keeps track of federal
spending, reported that Ben Reifel of South Dakota will this month
become the second retired member of Congress to collect more than
$1 million since leaving office.
   Former Sen. Margaret Chase Smith of Maine collected her first
million in May. In November, former Sen. Albert Gore Sr. of
Tennessee will join the club. No doubt they will be joined shortly
by many more.
   Reifel and Gore, who retired in 1971, and Mrs. Smith, who
stepped down in 1973, made $42,500 during their last year on the
job. Mrs. Smith now draws $88,715 a year in pension benefits,
Reifel $83,589 and Gore $81,347. ...
   The best part _ for congressman, not taxpayers _ is that the
federal treasury foots 85 percent of the bill for the congressional
retirement plan.
   No wonder House and Senate members have seen the campaign deck
is stacked against challengers.

   The Seattle Post-Intelligencer on the CDC-AIDS report:
   Two of every five adults infected with AIDS are black or
Hispanic _ far in excess of these groups' proportional
representation in the general population.
   That's why, appropriately enough, there is a flap over the
Centers for Disease Control's significant little omission in a
report the agency made public assessing its performance in
combatting AIDS.
   The analysts hired by the CDC took it to task for having ``n
cohesive plan of action'' for stopping the spread of AIDS among
racial and ethnic minorities.
   They said the CDC lacks information about the ``knowledge,
attitude and behaviors'' regarding AIDS in minority populations.
   And it said the agency has no idea how much of the money it
sends to local health agencies for minority AIDS programs actually
reaches the minorities for whom it was intended.
   All of this criticism, however, the CDC saw fit to delete from
the report. But it left intact an 11-page discussion detailing the
$30 million minority AIDS program it administers, according to the
Atlanta Constitution.
   CDC officials offered the lame excuse that they had merely
``condensed'' the report. Unfortunately, the public already is all
too familiar with this type of ``condensation'' of disturbing
information unfavorable to government agencies.

   Organizers say the Olympics are
putting South Korea on the world map, and they shrug off complaints
about a lack of big-spending foreign visitors.
   South Korean officials say the Games are meeting their goal of
enhancing the country's image as about 3 billion people around the
world watch the Games and the host nation on television.
   ``The world coverage is superb. The world is seeing Korea as an
advanced, modern nation. The reaction has been overwhelming,'' said
an official of the Seoul Olympic Organizing Committee.
   Olympic officials dismiss complaints from some businesses that
the Games have not unleashed a flood of foreign tourists spending
millions of dollars. It is still possible to get hotel rooms and
tickets for the Games despite earlier warnings of overcrowding.
   ``Tourists are not important compared to the billions of
television viewers. We did it for the world, not for a few
visitors,'' the committee official said on condition of anonymity.
   The government spent about $3.2 billion staging the Games to
push South Korea onto the world stage and show it as a leading
nation. South Korea hopes to boost its trade and diplomatic
relations by impressing the world, officials say.
   Olympic organizers said before the Olympics that they did not
expect a huge flood of visitors and that the main goal was
promoting the nation's image. Making money from the Games was never
the main goal, organizers say, although they want to break even.
   Some shopkeepers, hotels and others who thought Seoul would be
bursting with foreigners complain business is below what they had
anticipated and visitors are not spending very much.
   ``Sports people don't buy,'' said shopkeeper Chung Che-ee.
``They only take pictures and talk.''
   Some planes coming into Seoul have empty seats, and the Seoul
city government said hotel occupancy rates were about 90 percent
with a high of 97 percent during the first weekend of the Games.
   The Olympic committee says it has no figures on the number of
visitors for the Games, but about 250,000 people, including
athletes and officials, were anticipated and about 200,000 have
arrived. More are expected before the end of the Games, officials
said.
   ``You're looking at a very comfortable Games,'' said the
committee official. ``The place is not bursting at the seams, but
there are enough tourists here.''
   Many businesses may have overestimated the number and type of
tourists the Olympics would attract and assumed a flood of wealthy
tourists would come instead of the sports fans who came, committee
officials said.
   Geography and concern about overcrowding appear to have been the
main factors in keeping down the number of Olympic tourists,
committee and tourism officials said. Concern about violent student
protests do not appear to have been a major factor, they said.
   South Korea is a long way from the United States or Europe, and
the cost of air travel to Seoul is high. Concern about overcrowding
and lack of accomodation was also a factor in discouraging
visitors, committee officials said.
   ``People watch the Olympics on television. To come here you
really have to be an Olympic fan,'' said one tourism official.
   One major problem was the perception that rooms in top hotels
would not be available and tourists did not want to spend thousands
of dollars to get to Seoul and end up in more modest hotels,
committee officials said.
   The city's luxury hotels were gobbled up in advance by the
media, corporations and athletic groups, officials say.
   Shopowners have discovered most Olympic visitors came for the
Games rather than to shop or don't have much money after spending
thousands of dollars to get to Seoul.
   ``The sportsmen are crazy about sports, not spending money on
shopping,'' said Y.K. Kim, a tailor.

   Five high school students were found frozen to
death on a mountain 17 days after they began a climb in the
southwestern province of Yunnan, China Youth News reported
Wednesday.
   It said the students from Dali City in Yunnan Province left
unaccompanied on July 20 to climb Cangshan Mountain, about a mile
west of the city, which is famous for its dangerous cliffs and
harsh weather.
   A 500-member search party had just halted efforts to find the
youths on Aug. 6 when a group of hunters discovered their frozen
corpses at an elevation of 12,210 feet, 1,386 feet below the main
peak.
   The paper said the inexperienced climbers apparently lost their
way due to rain and poor visibility.
   Teachers in Dali commended the students for their spirit of
adventure but said they should not have been so rash, the report
said.
   The month-long delay in reporting the deaths was not explained.

   Hundreds of radical students threw
firebombs and rocks at police and scrawled slogans on a huge
Olympic flag in anti-government and anti-Olympic protests
Wednesday, police said.
   No one was arrested or injured in the protests in Seoul and
Suwon, 25 miles south of the capital, police officials said.
   About 300 students of Kyunghee University in Suwon fought police
and wrote slogans on an Olympic flag with the five-ring symbol, the
officials said.
   In downtown Seoul, about 100 students shouted anti-Olympic
slogans at a street demonstration and ran away when police rushed
in 10 minutes later, they said.
   The students in Suwon said the Olympics in Seoul will strengthen
authoritarian rule in South Korea and raise the risk of war with
North Korea, which is bocotting the Games.
   The slogans on the Olympic flag included ``Down with
dictatorship'' and ``Dictatorial Olympics,'' police said.
   Protesters did not break through the lines of troopers, the
officials said. The school is next to a soccer training camp used
by some Olympic teams, but it did not appear to be in use at the
time.
   ``Oppose the dictator's Olympics,'' the students shouted,
according to the officials.
   Police tried to hold off the protests by throwing back rocks and
did not fire tear gas, the officials said. Police are under orders
not to use tear gas during the Olympics, which opened Saturday and
will last until Oct. 2.
   Radical students are staging the protests to demand the Games be
shared with communist North Korea to help reunite the divided
Korean peninsula.
   Scattered anti-government and anti-Olympic demonstrations have
been reported in recent weeks, but they have little public support.
Most South Koreans want to make the Olympics a success and have
criticized the protests.
   North Korea is boycotting the Olympics because its demand to
co-host the Games was rejected. The International Olympic Committee
said the Games are awarded to a single city and cannot be shared.

   President Reagan, supporting George Bush's
attacks on Michael Dukakis, said today that teachers should be
required to lead students in reciting the Pledge of Allegiance
because ``that's what they're there for.''
   The president responded to a reporter's question whether he
thought Bush, the Republican presidential nominee, had ``overdone''
the pledge issue and impugned the Democratic candidate's patriotism.
   ``I've kind of enjoyed it. I think it's a fine thing if our
children ...'' Reagan replied during a White House photo session
with the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
   Reagan quickly added that he didn't ``see any reason why they
should not learn the various customs and so forth that have to do
with things of that kind.''
   ``I've seen many children today who don't know what they're
supposed to do when the national anthem is played or when the flag
goes by,'' he said. ``I remember that I learned all that in school.
Why shouldn't they?''
   The president was asked whether teachers should be forced to
lead students in the pledge.
   ``That's what they're there for,'' he shot back. ``They're job
is to teach something.''
   Bush, who concluded his acceptance speech at the GOP National
convention by reciting the pledge, has tried repeatedly to make a
campaign issue of the Massachusetts governor's 1977 veto of state
legislation that would have required public school teachers to lead
their classes in reciting the pledge.
   Dukakis said he does not oppose classroom recitations of the
pledge, but that he was advised by the state Supreme Court that the
bill was unconstitutional. He has accused Bush of using smear
tactics reminiscent of the McCarthy era in the 1950s.
   Reagan also praised former Education Secretary William Bennett
for having ``improved education'' but said that ``obviously,
there's much more to do.''
   At that point, the photo session ended and reporters were
ushered from the room.

   To save Ethel St. Lawrence from the aneurysm
pressing on her brain, doctors ``killed'' her for 40 minutes. They
put her in a coma, stopped her heart, chilled her by 40 degrees and
drained her body of blood.
   St. Lawrence was back at work 10 weeks after what she calls ``a
cotton-pickin' miracle,'' a sort of suspended animation that lets
surgeons cure hard-to-reach, high-risk aneurysms that once were
considered inoperable.
   ``It is everything that technology can possibly offer,'' said
her neurosurgeon, Dr. Robert Spetzler at Barrow Neurological
Institute in Phoenix.
   ``It may be the surgery of the future in cases where bleeding
poses the greatest risk to the operation,'' said Dr. Julian E.
Bailes, a neurosurgeon at Allegheny General Hospital here who
studied with Spetzler. ``That's the biggest cause of death in
surgery. If you could put someone in a state of suspended
animation, you could operate in a totally bloodless field.''
   In a severely cold, bloodless state, the brain can be deprived
of oxygen up to 55 minutes, giving surgeons time to remove the
aneurysm _ a bubble caused by weakness in the wall of a blood
vessel _ and clip arteries feeding it without the danger of massive
bleeding and certain death.
   Of 14 patients who have undergone the procedure at Barrow, one
has died, Bailes said. Most had ``excellent'' results, a few
reported some weakness but otherwise did well, and most remained in
a coma no more than five days.
   ``It's getting through the surgery,'' said Dr. Steven Shedd, a
Barrow neuroanesthesiologist who worked on St. Lawrence. ``If
you've tolerated the procedure and you wake up, you're going to be
OK.''
   But the risks, including that the heart won't restart, are too
great to use the procedure where normal anesthesia can adequately
do the job.
   ``It's what Birdseye discovered. It you freeze a fresh fish it
will come back and you can use it. The problem is, some people
don't,'' said Dr. Louis Caplan of Boston's New England Medical
Center and chairman of the American Heart Association's Stroke
Council.
   And because the patient has to be taken to the point of clinical
death for the operation to succeed, doctors approach it with ``a
lot of respect,'' said Shedd. ``Every time I do one of these I get
very nervous.
   ``You're taking a patient that's alive and breathing and
stopping their hearts and putting them into this state. They are
nothing. There is no breathing, no heart function. The brain
function is nil. We tilt the table up and drain all the blood into
the pump.
   ``I don't want to say the word `dead,' but the patient is
definitely suspended at that point. Cellular activity is still
occurring, but at a rate so low that we can't detect it. They're
not doing anything. We're talking cold.''
   St. Lawrence, a 61-year-old Phoenix secretary, was rushed to
Barrow on June 2, suffering from a severe two-day headache and
unable to open her right eye. Tests showed that a sinus aneurysm
detected four years ago had grown.
   Partly because of heavy doses of barbiturates given before
surgery to help prevent stroke or brain damage, St. Lawrence
recalls nothing about the June 6 operation. But she does recall
experiencing a very strong sensation.
   ``I just had this immense feeling that I was being cared for. It
felt like somebody was just holding me in their arms and taking
care of me and that I would be OK. It was just a feeling of peace.''
   Four months after surgery, she needs no medication and the
severe headaches are gone, though she still is unable to fully open
her eye.
   ``It's just a cotton-pickin' miracle. It truly is. They do say
God works in mysterious ways, and one of his ways of working is to
have capable people who know how to do things, and in this case
extremely capable surgeons.''
   Bailes is confounded, though, by Cecilia Duffy, a 76-year-old
Pittsburgh woman who spent 51 minutes in suspended animation Aug.
31 while surgeons removed an egg-sized aneurysm that had almost
completely disabled her.
   Duffy hasn't come out of the drug-induced coma, even though her
brain activity is improving, there is no evidence of brain injury,
and she moves her legs when stimulated. ``Quite frankly, I'm
worried about her because I would have thought she would have come
out of it by now,'' Bailes said.
   ``It's hard to know why (she hasn't) because she's old and her
liver isn't working that well,'' he said. ``She's not breaking down
drugs that quickly, so that's made it a little more confusing...
   ``As we go longer it's more likely she will have suffered some
stroke, some sort of (brain) injury.''
   Cooling the body and stopping the heart before an operation was
pioneered decades ago by cardiac surgeons, particularly in children
where there is little room to maneuver and bleeding is difficult to
control, said Dr. George Magovern Jr., a heart transplant surgeon
at Allegheny General who worked on Duffy.
   ``Hypothermia is an intricate part of cardiac surgery,
particularly moderate hypothermia'' in which the body is cooled 20
to 30 degrees, Magovern said. Profound hypothermia, in which the
temperature is lowered 40 degrees, ``is not done frequently, but
it's done enough.''
   To achieve hypothermia, doctors lower the operating room
temperature to about 55 and wrap the patient in cooling blankets.
They remove several pints of blood and replace them with
refrigerator-cold saline solution. A heat exchanger _ like a
radiator _ then runs the saline-blood mixture through ice and back
into the body. When the body is cold enough, the blood is removed
entirely.
   ``It's quicker and more efficient to repair the heart in a
bloodless field, and sometimes the only way you can accomplish that
is with profound hypothermia,'' Magovern said. ``But the downside
is that it limits you to 55 minutes of surgery, and there's always
the potential for neurological injury.''
   The difficulty in applying it to brain surgery, said Caplan, is
that doctors ``don't have a good way to monitor the person to see
how the brain's working. If you purposely put them in a coma and
decrease temperature and blood pressure, you have no way of knowing
if there's been damage until later.''
   ``It's an extreme way of doing an operation that requires
extreme measures,'' said Dr. Arthur Day of the University of
Florida at Gainesville and chairman of the cerebral vascular
department of the American Association of Neurological Surgeons.
   ``The side effects are quite subtantial potentially,'' Day said.
``So it's not an operation technique that we do for the
run-of-the-mill aneurysm. But for certain uncommon ones it may be
the only way.
   ``The problem is, what would you be like if you didn't have the
surgery? Most of the time having the aneurysm is such a bad thing
that you're willing to take a much greater risk.''

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi traveled
Wednesday to embattled Punjab state for the first time since 1985
and urged Sikhs and Hindus to fight Sikh extremists seeking a
separate homeland.
   Tight security, including more than 6,000 paramilitary troops
and a bulletproof shield for his podium, surrounded the Indian
leader, who placed the foundation stone for a new paper mill in
this small village.
   The government hopes the $170 million mill will help pump new
life into a state shattered by six years of guerrilla and terrorist
attacks. Sikh radicals have killed more than 1,950 people in Punjab
this year, nearly double the toll for 1987.
   Punjab is the only Indian state with a Sikh majority.
Nationwide, members of the Sikh faith comprise only 2 percent of
India's 800 million people, but they form 60 percent of Punjab's 18
million people.
   ``The anti-nationals want to break democracy in India, but we
must give our lives to maintain it,'' Gandhi said, wearing a
bulletproof vest as he addressed the crowd of 15,000 factory
workers, pupils and teachers.
   ``We have no fight with the Sikhs, only the terrorists. We are
fighting strongly, and we are getting results,'' the prime minister
said, speaking in Hindi.
   Punjab has been one of the biggest crises for the Gandhi
government, which fears the separatist movement could become a
full-scale civil war and fan insurgencies by other restless
minorities.
   Gandhi repeatedly has accused neighboring Pakistan of training
and arming Sikh extremists, a charge Pakistan denies.
   ``We maintain respect for all religions,'' Gandhi told the
crowd. ``We should not separate religions for the sake of foreign
powers. Hindus and Sikhs are living together, and they are dying
together. The people of Punjab have become an example of unity and
integrity.''
   Gandhi's mother, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, was killed by two
of her Sikh bodyguards in October 1984, four months after she
ordered an army raid on the Golden Temple in Amritsar, where Sikh
militants were holed up. More than 2,000 people, mostly Sikhs, died
in the raid on Sikhdom's holiest shrine.
   Gandhi traveled to Goindwal, 30 miles southeast of Amritsar, in
an Indian air force helicopter and was driven to the paper mill in
a car.
   Between 6,000 and 7,000 paramilitary troops were deployed in the
Goindwal area during Gandhi's visit, said Ram Krishnan, deputy
inspector general of the Central Reserve Police Force.
   Some had firearms, but most were armed with steel-tipped bamboo
sticks. They lined the roads for more than a mile around the paper
mill and stood guard on rooftops and in rice paddies, orange groves
and sugar cane fields.
   Sikh extremists began fighting for a separate homeland six years
ago, accusing the Hindu-dominated government of discrimination and
of hampering economic development in Punjab.
   The government has taken steps to lure small and large
industries to the state. On Monday it announced approval of a $17
million deal with the U.S.-based Pepsico Inc. to set up a
food-processing complex in Punjab.
   Gandhi signed a peace accord with moderate Sikhs in 1986 that
collapsed within a year. Scattered killings blamed on Sikh
extremists escalated to attacks on crowded buses, sleeping villages
and teeming markets.
   At first most of the victims were Hindus, but now an increasing
number of moderate Sikhs are being slain, and Sikh support for
extremists has been waning.
   When Gandhi ordered a siege of the temple last June to drive out
armed Sikh extremists, few Sikhs publicly objected.

   Gen. Saw Maung on Wednesday became the
fourth head of government in two months. The government said troops
have killed more than 140 civilians since the hard-line officer
ousted the civilian president on Sunday.
   Demonstrators demanding democracy and a halt to 26 years of
authoritarian rule stayed off the streets for a second day during
the crackdown.
   Troops killed 67 people, wounded 34 and arrested 100 ``in the
course of the government's law and order restoration work'' in
Rangoon and three other areas Tuesday and Wednesday, government
spokesman Kyaw San told reporters.
   Kyaw San said he had no knowledge of a rumored sweep by
authorities against student leaders who spearheaded the
pro-democracy protests.
   The latest tally brought the official death toll since the coup
to 144. But some Western diplomats in Rangoon believe at least 400
people have been killed in the Burmese capital alone, many when
troops opened fire on largely unarmed protesters Monday.
   ``At Rangoon General Hospital, there were 200 corpses on Monday
night and that was only one hospital,'' said one diplomat, speaking
on condition of anonymity.
   State radio said Saw Maung was named prime minister by the
nine-member governing council, appointed the day before and made up
primarily of his military cronies. He also holds the defense and
foreign affairs portfolios.
   ``There doesn't seem to be any end to the cycle of violence that
has been going on since March,'' said a Western diplomatic source
in Bangkok, Thailand.
   The government spokesman listed eight separate incidents in
Rangoon during a 20-hour period beginning Tuesday morning in which
57 people died as troops broke up mobs looting government
warehouses and a biscuit factory.
   Nine more people died when security forces beat back attacks on
a local government office in Mudon and a patrol in Mandalay, Kyaw
San said.
   A mob in southern Mergui city hurled a hand grenade at security
personnel on patrol, wounding 15 before they retaliated and killed
one of the attackers, he added.
   Pro-democracy demonstrators who have filled Rangoon by the
hundreds of thousands in recent weeks stayed off the streets
Tuesday and Wednesday, residents reported.
   All major markets remained closed although small food stores and
roadside shops were open.
   Troops conducted house-to-house searches in the heart of Rangoon
on Wednesday after a nighttime attack against City Hall and the
main government administration, residents and officials said. No
casualties were reported.
   A government release said a ``group of people'' attacked the two
buildings with an M-79 grenade launcher and automatic weapons and
fled after security forces returned fire.
   Saw Maung, 59, is known as a loyal follower of strongman Ne Win,
who seized power in 1962 and instituted a repressive,
military-backed system that turned resource-rich Burma into one of
the world's poorest nations.
   After Ne Win resigned in late July, the government was led for
17 days by former military officer Sein Lwin, who was succeeded by
civilian President Maung Maung.
   Maung Maung gave in to opposition demands to hold elections and
allow a multiparty system. The sticking point was the opposition
demand for an interim government to ensure a fair vote. Maung Maung
was removed in Saw Maung's coup.
   Although Saw Maung also has promised multiparty elections, he
has shown no signs of establishing an interim government.
   Many observers believe Ne Win remains the supreme power in Burma
and are skeptical about the promise of elections.
   ``It's the same people running the country,'' the Bangkok-based
diplomat said. ``They're trying to buy time and hold on to power.''
   Government administration remained virtually shut down as civil
servants sympathetic to the pro-democracy protests stayed on
strike. Authorities have ordered employees back on the job by Oct.
3, which is now viewed as a crucial deadline.
   Meanwhile, state-run radio carried a ``code of conduct'' issued
by Saw Maung to the 186,000-member military.
   ``They must uphold the prestige of the defense forces by
displaying good manners,'' the code said. It said military
personnel had to refrain from all ``untoward financial dealings''
and ``should not act indecently or force their way with women.''
   Although some soldiers defected to the anti-government side, the
military has stayed loyal to Burma's top leadership.
   ``It's a peasant army,'' said a diplomat in Bangkok. ``Their
attitude is that they have to follow orders. They trust their
officers.''

   William J. McCarthy, a book merchant for 36 years
who became president and chief executive of the Kroch's &
Brentano's bookstore chain, has died. He was 61.
   McCarthy, who lived in Evanston, died Tuesday at the University
of Chicago's Bernard Mitchell Hospital.
   ``He truly loved every aspect of the book business: the
advertising, the distribution, the stock room,'' said his wife,
Virginia, a retired librarian. McCarthy was driving a taxicab in
1952, while completing work on a master's degree in English
literature, when he answered an advertisement for a salesman's job
at Kroch's.
   Over the years, he rose through the management ranks and, in
1986, became the bookstore chain's third president and chief
executive officer. He succeeded Adolph Kroch, who founded the store
in 1907, and Kroch's son, Carl.
   McCarthy is survived by his wife, a daughter and two sons.
   Funeral services are scheduled for 10 a.m. Thursday at St.
Athanasius Catholic Church in Evanston.

   A part Siamese cat, buried for four
days among the debris of her family's home that was leveled by a
natural gas explosion, has been found alive.
   The singed cat called Mindy was discovered Monday by a worker
digging through the debris.
   ``The employee jumped away because Mindy didn't look too much
like a cat at the time,'' said Peggy Squibbs, a relative of the
Mindy's family.
   Rex Deaver, his wife, Lorriane, and their two children were
thrown from the house when it exploded. All four escaped serious
injury.
   Mindy's white fur is now yellow. She lost almost all her
whiskers and the tips of her nose and ears and the pads of her paws
were burned.
   But the cat's veterinarian, Dr. Patricia Stewart, said Mindy's
spirits were good and she might be going home by the end of the
week.

   A bomb exploded in a concrete
trash bin at rush hour tonight next to the main bus terminal for
white commuters, and police said 15 people were injured.
   The blast shattered windows of four buses, damaged a fast-food
cafe, and broke the windows of buildings and cars in the area.
   Injured were nine white men, five white women and a black man,
said police Capt. C.J. Marais.
   Some bleeding women were treated on the sidewalk as buses
continued to pull in and out of the outdoors terminal at Van Der
Bijl Square in the Johannesburg City Center after the 5:10 p.m.
explosion.
   There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the blast,
which occurred in a trash bin designed to muffle the effects of
bombs. Such bins were installed throughout the city last year.
   There have been more than 100 bombings in the country since the
June 12, 1986 national state of emergency was declared. Authorities
have blamed most of the blasts on the outlawed African National
Congress, the main guerrilla group fighting to overthrow the
government and end apartheid.

<TEXT>
   The Marines moved in,
ready to do battle. What they found, however, when they arrived to
fight wildfires in Yellowstone National Park was dirty,
back-breaking, often-boring work.
   ``We just wanted to go at it. We're ready to go in there right
up against it,'' said Lance Cpl. Earl Martin, of Bay City, Texas.
   Martin is with the 1st Battalion, 5th Marines from Camp
Pendleton, Calif., which arrived in Yellowstone last week and was
moved to the fire lines after intensive training sessions.
   The Yellowstone fires, which have been burning for three months,
have consumed more than 1 million acres of the 2.2 million-acre
park in northwestern Wyoming. Rain, snow and cooler weather have
curbed their spread during the last 10 days, but as recently as two
weeks ago the blazes threatened structures at the Old Faithful
complex and two Montana towns adjacent to the park.
   On Wednesday, National Park Service officials said cool and
moist weather kept the fires from spreading, but drier weather
expected later this week could burn new areas again.
   When regular fire crews were stretched thin all across the West,
Army troops, and then Marines, were sent to Yellowstone. There now
are 1,200 Marines and 2,000 Army troops on the fire lines in
Yellowstone.
   But the job has not been what the Marines anticipated. They
expected a toe-to-toe battle with a forest inferno. They found the
dirty job of mop-up, a term for strengthening fire lines and
searching out and extinguishing hot spots in burned forest.
   Later, they will work to rehabilitate areas cleared for fire
lines _ wastelands deliberately created to deprive the approaching
flames of fuel. The rehabilitation effort includes erosion control
and sifting ash and dirt to erase signs of human activity.
   It's not glamorous work.
   ``It is important, maybe the most important, but we'd like to
see some kick up,'' said Marine Cpl. Greg Crowe of San Diego.
   The Marines said it was their first non-military assignment, and
they have traded their trademark camouflage field uniforms for
green and yellow firefighter outfits.
   The part they've found most to their liking so far is the food,
catered by a Lander, Wyo., company called New-Way.
   ``We'd like them to contract to do our food,'' said Lance Cpl.
Michael McLoone, of Wilmington, Calif. ``We never eat this good,
not even in the barracks.''
   U.S. Forest Service fire commanders were uneasy when soldiers
and Marines first were dispatched to Yellowstone because of their
inexperience at firefighting, officials said.
   ``People were apprehensive. They had no training and they're too
young,'' said Rex Mann, planning chief for the Greater Yellowstone
Area Command.
   ``But their discipline and command structure paid off,'' he
said. ``I'm impressed and I probably will use them again.''
   Yellowstone has been a cold-weather exercise for the Marines,
who have had to scrape snow off their tents and brush ice from
their equipment.
   Marine Maj. Jack Carter had spent most of his summers in the
park since he was a boy, staying with his grandparents and parents
in West Yellowstone, Mont., so he was able to fill in his superiors
on the weather the Marines would face.
   ``We brought our longjohns,'' he said.
   Carter said coming back to Yellowstone and seeing some of it
charred and smoking ``hit pretty hard when I first saw it.''
   ``At first, you're devastated when you drive in,'' he said.
``It's a shame that lots of people for lots of years won't see the
park at its best.''
   Carter said he never noticed the build-up of dead and fallen
trees over the years, an accumulation that contributed greatly to
the hot, fast-moving fires. ``When you're walking on trails you
never notice. It's the American mentality, I think _ litter on the
side of the road.''
   The Marines will be in Yellowstone at least until Oct. 15, which
suits Carter fine.
   ``I love this park,'' he said. ``It never gets old.''

   President Reagan, supporting George Bush's
stance, indicated Wednesday he sees nothing wrong with requiring
teachers to lead classes in the Pledge of Allegiance because
``that's what they're there for.''
   Reagan said he learned the pledge to the flag in school and he
added concerning today's children, ``I don't see any reason why
they should not learn the various customs and so forth that have to
do with things of that kind.
   ``I've seen many children today who don't know what they're
supposed to do when the national anthem is played or when the flag
goes by. I remember that I learned all that in school. Why
shouldn't they?''
   Vice President Bush, the Republican presidential nominee, has
made the pledge a campaign issue, criticizing Democratic rival
Michael Dukakis for vetoing Massachusetts legislation that would
have required teachers to lead their classes in the pledge.
   Reagan was asked Wednesday if he believed teachers should be
forced to lead their classes in the pledge.
   ``That's what they're there for. Their job is to teach
something,'' Reagan said.
   Reagan, appearing at a photo session with the Joint Chiefs of
Staff, was asked whether he thought Bush had ``overdone'' the
pledge issue and had impugned Dukakis' motives in the process.
   ``I've kind of enjoyed it,'' Reagan replied. ``I think it's a
fine thing if our children...'' he added, his voice trailing off.
   Dukakis has said he does not oppose school children reciting the
Pledge of Allegiance and he has accused Bush of questioning his
patriotism and using the smear tactics of the late Sen. Joseph
McCarthy on such issues.
   The Democratic candidate, who is governor of Massachusetts, says
he vetoed the bill after being advised by lawyers for the state at
the time that the bill was unconstitutional.

   The country's most notorious terrorist
gang Wednesday claimed responsibility for a shotgun attack on one
of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's key advisers.
   A letter with the stamp of the leftist Red Army Faction said
West Germany's ``imperialistic economic policies'' prompted the
attack Tuesday, shortly before the first rounds of the World Bank
meeting in Berlin.
   A second letter, purportedly written by Italy's Red Brigades
terrorist group as well as by the German gang, urged a coordinated
``armed struggle in Western Europe.''
   The first letter said a ``commando squad'' of the Red Army
Faction attacked Hans Tietmeyer, a state secretary in the West
German Finance Ministry. Tietmeyer was not injured when his car was
fired on near his home in a Bonn suburb.
   ``The federal prosecutor cannot exclude that a kidnapping had
beek-International Monetary Fund
meeting in West Berlin, which begins with preliminary talks on
Thursday.
   The Red Army Faction did not make a direct link to the West
Berlin talks, but it did mention Tietmeyer's status as a delegate
of the World Bank as well as the International Monetary Fund.
   ``Our commando squad Khaled Aker attacked Hans Tietmeyer, state
secretary in the Finance Ministry,'' the two-page statement said.
The letter was mailed to a news agency and obtained by The
Associated Press.
   ``He (Tietmeyer) has a central role in the formulization,
coordination and carrying out of imperialistic economic policies.
In the last few years, there has been no important economic or
currency decisions in which he was not an important participant,''
it added.
   The statement said Tietmeyer was ``responsible for murder and
massive misery in the Third World'' because of his involvement in
international policies governing financial assistance for poor
nations.
   It was signed ``Commando Khaled Aker, Red Army Faction.''
   Roland Bachmeier, spokesman for the Interior Ministry, said
investigators were not familiar with the name ``Khaled Aker.''
   The Red Army Faction has used foreign terrorist names to
designate its own commando squads carrying out attacks in West
Germany.
   The federal prosecutor's office said investigators have
determined the pump-action shotgun used in the attack on Tietmeyer
was stolen by the Red Army Faction in a 1984 gunshop robbery.
   It said investigators were looking for a black Mercedes, another
unidentified car and a motorcycle that were seen in the area before
the shooting.
   Tietmeyer wrote an article for the Thursday editions of the West
German financial newspaper Handelsblatt, but he did not mention the
Tuesday attack.
   His article urged industrial nations to keep helping developing
countries reach higher standards of living.
   Security officials say the Red Army Faction has about 20 members
and several hundred sympathizers. It has been responsible for
arson, bombing and assassination attacks on government, industrial
and military targets since its formation in the early 1970s.
   The group claimed responsibility for the 1986 murder in Bonn of
West German diplomat Gerold von Braunmuehl.

<TEXT>
   Widespread fears of miscarriages or
birth defects in Sweden from the Chernobyl nuclear plant accident
are unfounded, the government said Wednesday.
   ``The conclusions that can be drawn from the research give no
support to the idea that radioactive fallout has had biological
effects as rumored at the time of the accident,'' said a statement
from the Department of Social Services.
   Sweden was one of several countries affected by fallout from the
April 1986 explosion at the Soviet nuclear power plant, which
killed 31 people in the Soviet Union in the world's worst nuclear
plant disaster.
   Radiation levels have been higher than normal among the reindeer
herders in Sweden's northern Lapland region. But winds at the time
of the accident blew most contamination north of Sweden's
population centers.
   Sweden's infant mortality rate showed a slight increase during
the survey period, amounting to 42 deaths higher than expected. But
Anders Ericson, a section chief at the department, said the
increase was attributed to random statistical variations.
   The infant deaths were not confined to areas with higher
fallout, he said by telephone.
   The study was conducted between 1986 and 1988 and covered
250,000 child births, Ericson said.
   It addressed miscarriages, legal abortions, underweight
children, birth mortality, early infant deaths and birth defects.
   ``We have so far seen no negative impact on the pregnancies that
were started after the accident,'' the report said.
   Ericson said abortions increased nationwide during the fall of
1986 and that pregnancies fell slightly during the summer months
because of fears the fallout could harm babies.
   Ericson said studies of a possible impact on tumors were under
way but would take six years to complete.

   A major show of little-known northern
Plains Indian art could give it international stature and help the
economy of Indian reservations, which are some of the poorest
regions in the nation, the show's director says.
   Northern Plains Indian artists are ``an untapped economic
resource,'' Shirley A. Bordeaux, project director for the three-day
Tribal Arts '88, which opens Friday.
   Bordeaux, who is from the Rosebud Sioux Indian Reservation, said
Tuesday the art show will attract several hundred serious art
buyers and collectors and about 100 Indian artists.
   ``We have a mission to help Indian people,'' she said.
   The show could lead to a stable market for the artists and will
help bring new money to the reservations, Bordeaux said.
   Artists will make important contacts at the show that will lead
to more sales and ``meaningful part-time employment for a segment
of the population,'' she said.
   On Friday, six judges will select 45 winners, including best of
show and the best works in the two major categories: tribal arts
and fine arts. Tribal arts includes beadwork, quilts, leather work,
metal work and dolls. Fine arts includes painting, pottery,
sculpture, graphics and photography.
   As original drawing by the late South Dakota Indian artist Oscar
Howe will be auctioned at the Friday night juried art show at Old
Courthouse Museum downtown. Tribal Arts '88 is dedicated to Howe's
memory.
   The show could lure 10,000 people to Sioux Falls, said Barry
LeBeau, one of the organizers.
   ``The establishment of a northern Plains Indian art market up
here in our own region is long overdue,'' he said. ``We have been
receiving nothing but praise and encouragement from the arts
world.''
   The show started with a federal grant from the Administration
for Native Americans.
   It has been advertised in publications worldwide. Bordeaux said
corporate and individual art buyers will attend.
   ``There is an interest in Indian art, and I think a particular
interest in northern Plains art,'' she said.
   Bordeaux said most of those invited to show their wares are
established artists from South Dakota, North Dakota, Montana,
Nebraska and western Minnesota, but some new artists are included,
she said.
   The organizers are helping artists handle art buyers. A workshop
for artists was held Wednesday in Sioux Falls, where experts
discussed marketing, pricing, copyrights and other techniques
``that will help them sell their work for a fair price,'' Bordeaux
said.
   On Sunday, the winner of the best of show will be awarded a
$1,000 prize, and the winners of the tribal arts and fine arts
categories each will win $500. Organizers say the prize money
should have special meaning for the winners.
   It was donated by Indian tribes, organizations, individuals and
businesses.

<HEAD>James Dean Festival Draws Thousands To Tiny Hometown</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FAIRMOUNT, Ind. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of James Dean fans are expected
in the actor's tiny hometown this weekend to mark his death, in
1955, with a film festival, look-alike contest and lasso
competition.
   The 13th annual festival also will include pilgrimages to Dean's
grave in Park Cemetery, said festival coordinator Ann Warr, who
runs the Fairmount Historical Museum, which is full of Dean
memorabilia.
   The film festival will feature Dean's ``Rebel Without a Cause,''
``East of Eden'' and ``Giant.''
   ``The lasso contest is designed after the same trick Dean
performed in `Giant,' '' Mrs. Warr said. ``He twirled a rope around
his hand with a rock attached to the end to see how many knots
could be tied in it.''
   Dean was born Feb. 8, 1931, in nearby Marion and spent his early
years in California. When his mother died of cancer, he returned to
Indiana and lived in Fairmount with his aunt and uncle, Ortense and
Marcus Winslow.
   Last year, more than 20,000 fans from all over the world
descended upon the town of 3,287 people during the festival weekend.
   ``We are expecting 25,000 to 28,000 people this weekend,'' said
Ron Spall, a spokesman for the Grant County Convention & Visitors
Bureau.
   Hotels, motels and campgrounds have been booked for months.
   ``When they check in, they make reservations for the next
year,'' said Jag Bohra, manager at Marion Inn.
   Marcus Winslow Jr., who was 11 when his first cousin died, said
Dean's popularity has resurged in the last 10 years.
   ``Maybe it's because of the resurgence of the '50s,'' he said.
``He hasn't aged any. The characters he played and his movies are
still popular. His movies fit in today.''
   After graduating from high school, Dean left Fairmount for
California, where he attended UCLA and started acting in
commercials and films.
   In 1952 he went to New York, where he was cast in a couple of
Broadway plays, including ``The Immoralist.'' Then director Elia
Kazan signed him to star in ``East of Eden.''
   Dean was killed soon after he completed ``Giant.'' It and
``Rebel Without a Cause'' were released after his death at age 24.
   Dean died Sept. 30, 1955, when his silver Porsche Spyder crashed
near Paso Robles, Calif.

   Uli Derickson, the heroic TWA
flight attendant who protected American passengers from their
brutal Arab hijackers, wept Wednesday as she recalled how the
ordeal still haunts her.
   Mrs. Derickson, the chief flight attendant aboard the airliner,
was testifying for the second day about the June 1985 hijacking in
which at least two Arabs killed a U.S. Navy diver and held 39
Americans captive for 17 days.
   Mohammed Ali Hamadi has confessed to hijacking the plane with
another Lebanese Shitte Moslem. He is being tried on charges of air
piracy and murder.
   ``I suffered deep psychological effects, and I am still under
therapy,'' said the German-born Mrs. Derickson, crying
uncontrollably. ``I can imagine everyone onoff. There's no
doubt I'll be looking at the screen, that when it said 73 seconds
and it's counting upwards, I'll know we've passed that particular
milestone. But it's not like I'm worried about it.''

   Americans' personal income in August increased
only half as fast as inflation, the government said Wednesday,
providing analysts with more evidence that economic growth has
eased, at least temporarily.
   The Commerce Department said income grew a sluggish 0.2 percent
in the worst showing since a 0.4 percent decline in January. Income
was up a strong 0.7 percent in July and 0.6 percent in June.
   Meanwhile, personal consumption spending, which includes
everything except interest payments on debt, rose a moderate 0.5
percent following a 0.3 percent gain in July.
   The numbers are consistent with other recent government reports
showing that the economy slowed in August from its vigorous pace
during the first half of the year.
   The unemployment rate for the month jumped to 5.6 percent from
5.4 percent in July. Retail sales were off by 0.2 percent.
   ``The key question is was this just a little summer hiatus and
are we going to get back on track in the autumn or does it indicate
something more fundamental,'' said Robert G. Dederick, an economist
with Northern Trust Co. in Chicago.
   ``My own view is it is a hiatus,'' he said. ``I don't see any
reason why the economy decided to go into hibernation, although it
may have taken a little siesta, primarily because of the heat.''
   Analysts have blamed the summer heat for cutting into
back-to-school sales and, Richard Peach, an economist with the
Mortgage Bankers Association of America, said heavy use of air
conditioners strained utilities in some parts of the country.
   ``There were brownouts in the Northeast. It's not inconceivable
that because of the unavailability of power, employers had to work
half time or put people on temporary layoff,'' he said.
   As in June and July, personal income in August was held back by
declines in subsidy payments to farmers. The payments shrank $6.2
billion in August and $6.1 billion in July.
   However, farm income excluding subsidies fell $3.2 billion in
August, more than four times the July decline of $700 million.
Analysts blamed the slippage on the Farm Belt drought that
shriveled crops and parched pastures.
   Wages and salaries, a key component of personal income, were up
a modest 0.3 percent in August compared with a large 1.0 percent
gain in July.
   However, personal interest and dividend income both grew faster,
with interest income increasing 0.6 percent following a 0.5 percent
rise in July and dividend income up 1.2 percent after a 0.9 percent
gain a month earlier. The gains were a reflection of rising
interest rates and strong corporate earnings.
   Disposable, or after tax, income was up 0.2 percent in August
and 0.6 percent a month earlier.
   ``It was a month in which income growth was very moderate indeed
and did not keep up with inflation,'' Dederick said. A price index
tied to the personal income report rose 0.4 percent, double the
income gain.
   With spending rising slightly faster than income, the personal
savings rate _ savings as a percentage of after-tax personal income
_ edged down from 4.2 percent in July to 3.9 percent in August. The
savings rate this year has averaged 4.1 percent, up from 3.2
percent last year.
   The spending gain was strongest for services, up 0.7 percent
following a 0.6 percent rise in July. Purchases of non-durable
goods rose 0.2 percent following a 0.3 percent increase a month
earlier. Purchases of durable goods, ``big ticket'' items expected
to last three or more years, were unchanged after falling 0.6
percent in July.
   The changes left personal incomes at a seasonally adjusted rate
of $4.08 trillion and personal consumption spending at an annual
rate of $3.26 trillion.

   A 64-year-old American died and
eight other passengers were slightly injured Wednesday aboard a Pan
Am jumbo jetliner that was rocked by turbulence en route from New
York, officials said.
   John Francis Rooney died of heart failure about two hours before
Pan Am Flight 201 reached Rio's Galeao International Airport on
Wednesday morning, the airport authority said. The airline and the
U.S. consulate did not know Rooney's home town.
   A Pan Am spokesman said the jetliner encountered turbulence as
it flew over the Caribbean island of Barbados.
   ``It was about 4 in the morning, and several passengers were
sleeping across three seats in economy class without their seat
belts on. When the plane hit the turbulence, they were thrown
against the arm rests and got bruised and bumped,'' Pan Am airport
manager Billy Fernandez said.
   He said eight passengers were slightly injured.
   Two Brazilian men and an American woman, Carol Murray Devenish,
were treated for scrapes and bruises at the airport, airport
authority spokesman Gilson Campos said.

   First Day programs, one of the most prized and
hardest to get stamp collector souvenirs, will soon go on public
sale, the U.S. Postal Service announced Wednesday.
   The programs have traditionally been given out for free, but
only to people attending the special ceremonies held on the first
day of issue for new stamps.
   They contain one of the stamps, cancelled on that date, as well
as a program for the ceremony listing the participants and
describing the subject of the stamp.
   Starting in January, the agency said, the programs will be
offered for sale to people who cannot attend the ceremonies, which
are held in various cities across the nation. Programs will still
be given free to people who do attend the events, officials said.

   A man who shot a moose while bowhunting
in the Lake Clark National Preserve was gored and kicked after he
approached the animal he thought was dead, the National Park
Service said.
   Rangers said Donald Hewkin, 30, of Zion, was alone Friday when
he spotted a bull moose and hit it with three arrows.
   The moose fell, and Hewkin assumed it was dead and approached,
rangers said. As he reached the animal, it started to rise, rangers
said. Hewkin turned to flee and the moose gored him with one antler
tine in the left buttock, rangers said.
   The moose tossed Hewkin in the air and kicked him several times.
The moose then ran a short distance and dropped, rangers said.
   Hewkin was able to walk a mile to his hunting party's camp,
where his companions tried for 24 hours to alert passing aircraft.
   Saturday, two rangers on routine patrol by plane spotted the
party's red distress flag. Hewkin was flown to Port Alsworth, then
to Central Peninsula General Hospital in Soldotna, where he was
treated and released.
   Rangers said they could not find the wounded moose.

<BYLINE>INFLATION:</BYLINE>

   Higher costs for food, shelter and gasoline sent consumer prices
up 0.4 percent in August as the effects of the drought began to
ease. The increase, equivalent to an annual inflation rate of 5.2
percent, was the same as in July. Higher rents and gasoline prices
in large part replaced food as the sharpest spurs to higher prices,
the Labor Department said.
   Energy prices jumped 0.9 percent on a 3 percent boost in
gasoline prices, their sharpest gain in a year, and shelter costs,
reflecting higher rates for hotel and motel rooms, were up 0.6
percent, the steepest in seven months.

   Housing constructon fell 3.3 percent in August after increases
of 1.4 percent in July and 5.2 percent in June. Single-family homes
were built at an annual rate of 1.09 million, up 2.1 percent from
July, but that was offset by a 16.9 percent drop in apartment
construction to a 350,000-unit rate, its lowest level since the end
of the last recession in 1982.
   Overall, the Commerce Department said, housing starts were at an
annual rate of 1.44 million units last month, down 49,000 units
from July.

   Reductions in farm subsidy payments held Americans' personal
income to a modest 0.2 percent gain in August, while spending rose
0.5 percent.
   The $7.2 billion rise in income to a seasonally adjusted annual
rate of $4.08 trillion followed gains of 0.7 percent in July and
0.6 percent in June.
   Wages and salaries were up 0.3 percent in August vs. 1 percent

<HEAD>`Foot Ministry' Uplifts Souls by Soothing Soles of Homeless</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   To the down-on-their-luck residents of
Orlando's homeless shelter, a ``foot ministry'' provides a welcome
relief by soothing their soles while uplifting their souls.
   Four women in an informal, non-religious group wash and massage
the feet of the poor and the tired.
   ``Feels good,'' Carol Strail, 33, said as she lifted her feet
from the basin of hot water and Epsom salts so Bette-Sue Hartwick
could examine them.
   Ms. Hartwick, an X-ray technician, held Ms. Strail's feet and
asked, ``Any blisters?''
   No, said Ms. Strail. Now that she has some soft-soled shoes, her
feet are better. She'd spent the day working in a greenhouse in
nearby Apopka, preparing rubber plants for shipment.
   Ms. Hartwick, wearing rubber gloves and kneeling on the tile
floor of the converted bus station, blotted the woman's feet with a
towel and then rubbed some skin lotion on them.
   ``It gives them a little bit of pampering,'' Ms. Hartwick said
Tuesday.
   The hot water revives and the cool lotion soothes. But more than
anything, the attention seems to restore _ if only briefly _ a
sense of dignity that comes from being pampered. Each of the 20
residents who signs up for the foot ministry also gets a pair of
new socks.
   The ministry, modeled on programs for the homeless in Atlanta
and Washington, was suggested by Sister Julie Sullivan, a Roman
Catholic nun and executive director of the Coalition for the
Homeless of Orlando, which runs the shelter.
   She found that foot care is one of the most overlooked health
problems of the homeless, who generally do not have good shoes and
who spend a great deal of time walking or in jobs that require
hours of standing.
   Ms. Hartwick and Roseanna Pratt, who work together at the Mayer
Family Care Center, helped organize the group recently with the
help of donations from their employer and their churches.
   So far, they have made two visits to the shelter, but hope to
make it a regular service.
   Ms. Pratt, a medical secretary, said she is pleased that people
are affected by such a simple act. Massaging feet will not get
people jobs or help them learn employable skills, she said, but it
might remind them that others care about their struggle.
   ``This is our country,'' she said. ``These are our own people.''

<HEAD>Poland, Soviet Must Tell Truth About Past, Intellectuals Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH G. SEWARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Intellectuals from Poland and the Soviet
Union urged their governments to tell the truth about mistakes made
during World War II and the rule of Soviet dictator Josef Stalin.
   The call came Tuesday as more than 100 Polish and Soviet
writers, filmmakers and historians opened a seminar on ``Film and
De-Stalinization of Culture'' in the basement of the Union of
Writers in Warsaw.
   ``We came here to hurry it (de-Stalinization) up a bit,'' said
Soviet film critic Irina Rubanova, one of the seminar's organizers.
   ``Only the ruthless truth can be the basis of dialogue,'' Soviet
historian Natan Eidelman said in the opening lecture.
   The Society of Polish Filmmakers and its Soviet counterpart
organized the seminar, which held its first meeting in Moscow in
April.
   They showed many films from the Stalin era, some of which have
never been shown in Poland, but the meetings' main focus was on
historical ``blank spots.'' Only a few years ago, such a meeting
would have been unthinkable.
   Eidelman said the discussions in Moscow helped eliminate Soviet
ignorance and added to the few facts available on Stalin's crimes.
   But he stressed that facts alone will not ensure that the
de-Stalinization made possible by Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's policy of ``glasnost,'' or more openness on some
issues, will endure.
   ``If you ask me what is necessary, what is most important for
our Russian consciousness today, I would say that what is lacking
is a sense of shame,'' Eidelman said, citing the forced
deportations to Russia of hundreds of thousands of Poles. ``We
unfortunately have gone through this stage feebly.''
   In April 1987, Gorbachev and Poland's leader, Gen. Wojciech
Jaruzelski, signed an agreement to establish a joint commission of
Soviet and Polish historians to review the blank spots in the
history books.
   The most important one for Poles is the of more than 4,000
Polish officers in Katyn forest during World War II. The Soviets
blame the Nazis, but Western evidence indicates Soviet
responsibility.
   Many Poles hoped Gorbachev would address the issue during an
official visit in July, but Gorbachev left Poland without doing so.
   Eidelman had no explanation for Gorbachev's silence, but said
that the person who finally cleared up Katyn would need authority
and time.
   Polish and Soviet chairmen of the historical commission say they
must further assess documentary evidence to reach conclusions on
Katyn.
   Other blank spots include Stalin's destruction of the Polish
Communist Party in the 1930s and the deportation of Poles to
Siberia during World War II.
   Another is the Soviet army's failure to help the Polish
resistance in the Warsaw Uprising of 1944. Two hundred thousand
Poles died while the Red Army camped a short distance away.
   While some Poles raised old wounds and lamented the slow pace of
de-Stalinization, others welcomed the Soviet efforts.
   ``We have always believed, often against hope, that a moment
will come when we will be able to talk here together as free people
with free people with equal partners,'' said Polish historian Adam
Michnik.
   ``I'd like to say that we are for democratic Russia because we
are for democratic Poland,'' the longtime opposition activist said.

   An aide to Michael Dukakis dismissed as
``deception and disinformation'' a claim by GOP National Chairman
Frank Fahrenkopf that the Democratic nominee refused repeated
invitations to visit military bases in Massachusetts as governor.
   ``Unfortunately for the governor, he cannot hide the fact that
in his 10 years as governor, he has refused, although invited many,
many times, to visit even one of the military installations of our
great nation in the state of Massachusetts,'' Fahrenkopf said
Tuesday while campaigning for Republican nominee George Bush.
   ``This is the latest round of Republican deception and
disinformation,'' said James Dorsey, the governor's press
secretary. ``Never let the facts get in the way of a good story,
(it's) the first rule of deceptive campaigning.''
   Dorsey said a quick check of his files showed that Dukakis
visited Fort Devens, an Army installation near Shirley, Mass., in
March 1986. He said Dukakis also visited the Camp Edwards military
reservation, which contains a National Guard installation, and Otis
Air Force Base on Cape Cod in September 1985 for a change of
command ceremony.
   He said there also are photographs at Dukakis' campaign
headquarters showing the governor visiting Fort Devens during his
first term in 1974-78.
   Fahrenkopf did not elaborate on the allegation in his disputed
statement. Press officials at Republican Party headquarters in
Washington, telephoned for comment, said they were unfamiliar with
the matter.
   Standing on the deck of the retired World War II battleship
Alabama at Mobile on Tuesday, Fahrenkopf said there will be
``severe cuts in defense spending'' and threatened cutbacks in Navy
plans for West and Gulf coast homeports if Dukakis is elected
president.

   NAACP protests prompted a church
school to cancel its fund-raising ``slave auction,'' in which
students dressed as clowns would work one day for the students who
bought them.
   Mock auctions have been held for more than 15 years at the
750-student Temple Heights Christian School, owned by the First
Baptist Church of Temple Heights.
   But this year, a black student complained to the NAACP, and the
auction was canceled Tuesday.
   ``I felt hurt by the plan to hold the auction,'' said Charrise
Williams, 17, and one of three blacks in the 45-member senior
class. ``I felt that my feelings were not being considered.''
   The Tampa chapter of the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People wrote to the school urging another
way be found to raise money.
   ``The concept of slavery is distasteful, offensive and
embarrassing, particularly to a race of people who were brutalized,
killed and treated as less than human beings,'' said Helen LaCount,
who heads the NAACP's legal redress committee.
   Ms. Williams said the auction was not her first encounter with
racist attitudes at the school. The teen-ager's mother, Teresa,
said her daughter had been called racially offensive terms as well
by some students.
   ``And when my daughter reacted to that stuff, they kept telling
her that she was too sensitive,'' said Mrs. Williams, a nurse who
moved from Washington, D.C., last November.
   ``I don't think they would hold a Holocaust scene and defend it;
I don't think they should hold a slave sale,'' she said, adding she
was unsure if she will keep her daughter in the school.
   ``After all, my daughter told the school she was against it.
They should have known that once you offend one student with
something like this, you have offended one too many,'' Mrs.
Williams said.
   Principal Randy Hurst said Wednesday that after the student
complained, school officials agreed to change the name and format
of next year's fund-raising event.
   ``We were going to go through with it this year because the kids
had already bought their clown outfits,'' he said. ``It seemed like
everything was fine, no one was upset.
   ``Then I got a call from the NAACP. There you have it,'' he
said. ``We've been doing this for so many years, it never had any
racial overtones, just a fun day for the students.''
   Hurst said he has permanently canceled the auctions. They
traditionally raised $1,000 to $1,500, and were never meant to
demean blacks, he said.
   In the auction, students in clown outfits stand on a block and
are auctioned. The purchased ``slave'' spends the next day with the
``master'' doing minor chores like carrying books and perfoming
ridiculous stunts.

   A black high school student says she was
told to ``go back to the ghetto'' during a football game, prompting
school officials Wednesday to promise to work toward preventing
future racial clashes.
   Shana Cannell, a 14-year-old freshman, said a cheerleader at
Pekin led other students in racially harassing blacks at the Sept.
2 game between the Peoria Lions and the Pekin Dragons.
   ``While I was playing in the (Peoria) band, Pekin High School
students taunted my friends and me with racial slurs such as ...
`go back to the ghetto,''' the teen-ager wrote in a letter to the
Journal Star of Peoria.
   She added that ``one of the more vocal students was a Pekin
cheerleader who was standing in front of her coach'' and referred
to her by a common racial epithet.
   Jack Wilt, Pekin School District superintendent, said he has
found no witnesses but has no reason to doubt the girl's story.
Wilt said he plans on offering her a written apology.
   ``I can't pinpoint who made the remarks but I don't doubt they
were made,'' Wilt said Wednesday.
   Ms. Cannell's father, Julian Cannell, the Peoria School District
attorney, said an apology ``is not the answer.''
   ``My speculation is the teachers and parents in Pekin don't
care,'' he said. ``They must educate their children that overt
racism will not be tolerated in our society.''
   Chic Renner, president of the Pekin school board, said Wednesday
that the remarks of a few students do not reflect the attitudes of
everyone in Pekin.
   Wilt said there is a history of racial problems at athletic
events involving Pekin and Peoria High, which has 1,200 students
and a 39 percent minority enrollment.
   He noted that less than 1 percent of Pekin High's 2,500-member
student body is black and only one or two black families live in
Pekin.
   Renner is concerned the incident is rekindling the longstanding
perception of Pekin as a racist community.
   ``I don't know how long we have to dwell on it,'' he said. ``We
recognize the problem and are trying to deal with it and cure it.''

<HEAD>Brooklyn Youth Says He's Sorry for Burning Synagogue</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As Jews atoned for their sins Wednesday on Yom
Kippur, the most solemn of Jewish holy days, a 12-year-old boy
accused of setting fire to a synagogue said he, too, was sorry for
what he had done.
   The boy, identified as Joey, said he was just out to have fun
when he and a 15-year-old companion allegedly desecrated
Congregation Sharai Torah in Brooklyn last Saturday morning.
   The two face charges in family court that they spray-painted
swastikas in the Orthodox synagogue and set fire to six Torahs _
the handwritten scrolls of the first five books of the Old
Testament.
   The congregation observed Yom Kippur _ the Day of Atonement _ at
a nearby Jewish school, using a Torah donated by an Ohio synagogue.
``We believe that everything, including this fire, is from God,''
said the president of the congregation, Hirsch Wolf.
   Joey said in an interview with New York Newsday that he hadn't
known what a synagogue was and did not vandalize it out of
anti-Semitic feelings. If he had the opportunity, he said, he would
tell members of the congregation, ``I'm really sorry.''
   ``These kids didn't know what they were doing,'' said Joey's
mother, Anna Cadet Santiago. ``My son has a lot of remorse. He's
scared.''
   But Police Commissioner Benjamin Ward said that the damage in
the synagogue looked like more than vandalism.
   ``They deliberately took the Torah and put it down on the floor
and stepped on it,'' he said.
   The crime, occurring on the Sabbath before Yom Kippur, shocked
Brooklyn's huge Jewish community. An estimated 10,000 people turned
out Sunday for a memorial service for the burned Torahs.
   Among those sending messages of condolence to the synagogue was
Roman Catholic Cardinal John O'Connor, who called the arson attack
``a heinous crime.''
   The president of the Rabbinical Council of America, Rabbi Max N.
Schreier, issued a statement Wednesday calling it an ``act of
ruthless vandalism the likes of which have not been seen since the
Holocaust.''
   Joey told the newspaper the 15-year-old, Louie, came to him
Friday night. ``He said, `You want to have fun?' I said, `Sure.' I
thought we were going to run around and make noise. He didn't say
nothing about the fire.''
   Inside the synagogue, the boys knocked over books and discovered
some liquor, Joey said.
   ``He had a can of spray paint,'' Joey said of Louie. ``He was
drawing swastikas all over. He started pouring liquor on ... the
cabinet,'' referring to the wooden ark where the synagogue's Torahs
were stored.
   Joey said Louie removed one of the scrolls, unrolled it on the
floor, and then lit a box of matches and threw it into the ark. The
boys panicked and ran, he said.
   ``I knew I was in trouble,'' Joey said. ``I knew I did something
wrong.''

   Tammy Wynette, country music's heroine
of heartbreak, was fighting in court to regain control of her home,
which was seized by U.S. marshals to pay for a $900,000 judgment
against her.
   She filed an emergency bankruptcy petition Tuesday and a motion
Wednesday seeking to regain possession of the home, attorney Steve
Lefkovitz said.
   He said Miss Wynette and her husband, George Richey, filed a
Chapter 11 petition on behalf of themselves and Tammy Wynette
Enterprises.
   Miss Wynette, best known for her hits ``Stand By Your Man'' and
``D-I-V-O-R-C-E,'' was performing Wednesday on the West Coast and
her husband was with her, the attorney said. Richey, whose real
name is George Richardson, planned to fly back to Nashville to deal
with the matter, Lefkovitz said.
   ``She's a very fine woman and it's unfortunate all this had to
happen,'' he said.
   Miss Wynette, 46, had no comment, said Kent Arwood, a spokesman.
   Lefkovitz said the bankruptcy petition was filed after the
Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. took steps to seize the
couple's personal assets to satisfy the $900,000 court judgment.
   Lefkovitz said he asked bankruptcy court Wednesday for an
expedited hearing on his request to turn the assets back to the
singer and her husband.
   Another attorney for the couple, Ralph Gordon, said the two had
some investments in Florida that were financed by Sunrise Savings &
Loan of Boynton Beach, Fla., which failed.
   As a result of the failure, the FSLIC won a $900,000 judgment
against the couple. A court order Monday allowed U.S. marshals to
enter the home to enforce the judgment.

   Don Johnson says he likes his new role in the
film ``Sweet Hearts Dance'' because it's so unlike what fans of his
``Miami Vice'' role would expect.
   ``Mostly I was offered body count pictures. That is, if by page
seven I hadn't slain 15 people it wasn't a Don Johnson movie,''
Johnson said.
   When he was sent the screenplay of ``Sweet Hearts Dance,''
Johnson said, ``I read it, then reread it because I was shocked
that it was so good.''
   ``I hadn't seen that kind of relationship between men in films
for a long time,'' he said.
   Directed by Robert Greenwald, the film traces the life of a
carpenter in a small New England town who gets more satisfaction
out of climbing gymnasium ropes with his high school buddy, played
by Jeff Daniels, than by going home to his wife, played by Susan
Sarandon.
   Johnson's reputation for being difficult and demanding didn't
stop Greenwald from going after him. ``He is as emotional and moody
and funny and smart as Wiley Boon is,'' Greenwald said, referring
to the character he playes in the movie.
   ``I will never, as long as I live, say that he's easy. But he is
good,'' the director added.

   Country singer Steve Earle has been fined $500 and
given a year's probation after he pleaded no contest to a reduced
charge of resisting arrest.
   Earle, 33, had been charged with assaulting a Dallas Police
officer after a New Year's Eve peformance.
   The plea came Tuesday while a jury was being selected for his
trial on a felony assault charge. The reduced charge of resisting
arrest was a misdemeanor.
   Authorities alleged that Earle scratched officer L.R. Allen with
his fingernails and hit him with his knee during a scuffle outside
Dallas Alley, a Dallas night spot.
   Earle, who could have faced up to 10 years in prison if he had
been convicted on the original charge, said that his plea was not
an admission of guilt and maintained that the officer attacked him.
   Earle is known for his album ``Guitar Town'' and his style of
combining country with rock and blues.

<HEAD>Pro-Nuclear Power Group Raises $5.5 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Activists opposed to a November ballot question
that could force the closing of Massachusetts' two commercial
nuclear power plants have raised more than $5.5 million to defeat
the referendum, according to disclosure statements.
   Sponsors of the referendum, Citizens for Safe Energy, have
raised $280,184, according to the disclosure forms.
   ``Getting rid of the emotion on this issue is really tough,''
said Robert Palmer, spokesman for the Massachusetts Citizens
Against the Shutdown organization, also known as the Vote No on 4
Committee.
   ``Money does not buy the vote, but money produces information,''
Palmer said Tuesday. ``This is what needs to be done to get the
message across.''
   Palmer said the money would be spent primarily for radio and
television advertising. He also said the money being donated by
utilities comes out of earnings and has no effect on electric rates.
   Leading contributors to the committee have been Boston Edison
Co. with $1.4 million, the Yankee Atomic Electric Co. with $1.7
million and Montaup Electric with $450,759, according to disclosure
reports filed with the Office of Campaign and Political Finance.
   But the committee claims more than 45,000 citizens have joined
its cause, including more than 100 academic, civic, business and
labor leaders, some of whom oppose nuclear power generally but also
oppose the potential sweeping impact of the ballot proposal.
   Question 4 on the Nov. 8 ballot would ban the operation of any
power plant that generated nuclear waste, effectively shutting down
the state's two nuclear power plants _ Pilgrim Station in Plymouth
and Yankee-Rowe in western Massachusetts. A similar referendum
question was defeated by voters last year in Maine.
   According to the financial disclosure, nearly $1.8 million of
the Vote No funds have been spent for telephone polling and direct
mail. A Los Angeles media consulting firm will design the
committee's media strategy.

   The slayings of a homeless man who was
stabbed 14 times and disemboweled and of another man who was
covered with silver paint have stunned this community that had had
only two previous killings this year.
   Three teen-agers are being held in the death of the 73-year-old
homeless man, police said Wednesday. He was beaten, stabbed and
left bleeding in an alley Sunday night while the youths discussed
how to finish the job.
   The body of the man covered with silver paint was found in a
field Tuesday night. He apparently was beaten with a paint can
found nearby, said Lowell Police Capt. Tom Cullen.
   ``It was an unusual situation. People thought it was all over.
Less than 48 hours later, we had another,'' Cullen siad.
   The homeless man, Louis Pozyck, had lived in Lowell for 10 years
and was often seen pushing a shopping cart looking for cans, which
he collected for money, Cullen said. He was awarded the Bronze Star
during World War II.
   ``He was kind of a character. He hung around Lowell, was
harmless, had a lot of friends. Turns out he's a decorated war
hero. We didn't know that until he was killed,'' he said.
   Sunday night Pozcyk was sleeping in an alley when a youth
confronted him, Cullen said.
   ``It appears he was woken up by one of them and told to take
off. He was kicked in the face and stabbed by one person who left
the scene.''
   The assailant met two friends and the three returned to the
alley and Pozyck was again stabbed, he said.
   ``Then they went to a shopping center. They decided they better
go back and make sure he was dead, (they discussed) maybe they
should burn him.''
   The youths returned to the alley a third time and one of them
disemboweled the man, Cullen said. Neighbors who heard the man's
screams called police.
   Brian Gobis, 18, and Michael Morrisette, 17, both of Lowell were
charged with murder Monday and were being held without bail, Cullen
said. A hearing has been set to determine if the 16-year-old
suspect can be tried as an adult, said a spokesman for the
Middlesex County District Attorney's office.
   In the second murder, the man, whose name was being withheld,
was found in a field a few hours after he had gone to buy paint.
   ``At first it looked like a ritual-type killing, but then as we
tried to reconstruct it, it appeared that the paint can was the
weapon,'' Cullen said.
   No arrests have been made in that case.
   Lowell, with a population of about 100,000, is 25 miles
northwest of Boston. Police Sgt. Patrick Burns said Wednesday
afternoon that to his knowledge the city had had only four murders
so far this year.

<HEAD>Inflations Stays At 5.2 Percent</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Higher food, shelter and gasoline prices
maintained an annual inflation pace of 5.2 percent in August as the
effects of the drought on consumers began to ease, the government
said Wednesday.
   Food and beverage prices rose 0.5 percent for the month,
compared with 0.9 percent in July when the Labor Department said
the greatest impact of the dry weather in the Farm Belt began
reaching consumer pocketbooks.
   But gasoline prices jumped a whopping 3 percent in August, the
biggest increase in 12 months. Analysts noted that the normal
summer vacation season price spikes for gasoline are usually over
by August, but that there were shortages of unleaded grades in many
markets this year.
   Despite lower utility bills and home energy costs, shelter
expenses also were up 0.6 percent in August, their largest increase
in seven months, the Labor Department said.
   ``Increases in the food, shelter and energy components accounted
for over four-fifths of the August advance in the consumer price
index,'' the government said.
   When combined with large price declines for clothing and natural
gas, the overall August price increases were the same as the 0.4
percent in July.
   The calculated annualized rate also was the same for both months
_ 5.2 percent _ in contrast to a 4.4 percent inflation rate in 1987
and the first six months of this year, Labor Department economists
said..
   ``We have a gradual worsening of underlying inflation, but it is
gradual ... sneaking in, sort of like dust through a window,'' said
Robert G. Dederick, an economist at Northern Trust Co. in Chicago.
``One month is up, one month is down, but pretty soon you have
higher inflation.''
   But private analysts agreed with a White House assessment that
there was nothing alarming or dramatic in the numbers.
   ``The scare that we're off to the races or that an inflationary
sprial is under way has not materialized and it won't
materialize,'' said Larry Chimerine of the WEFA Group, a Bala
Cynwyd, Pa., consulting firm.
   ``There is a gradual acceleration of inflation heavily
concentrated in material prices and prices of imported goods,''
Chimerine said. ``But at this point it is not spreading throughout
the economy.''
   A separate report by the Commerce Department showed personal
income rising a modest 0.2 percent in August, the smallest gain in
eight months, although much of it represented declines in both farm
subsidies and farm income. Wages and salaries were up just 0.3
percent.
   After adjustments for inflation, the Labor Department said
Americans' average weekly earnings fell a percipitous 1.3 percent
in August. The decline in workers' buying power was the third in
the past four months and the worst ever on record since the
government began keeping tabs on real earnings in 1964.
   The decrease stemmed from a 0.9 percent drop in the average
number of hours worked, from 34.9 hours to 34.6 hours, and the 0.4
percent hike in consumer prices. Average hourly earnings were
$9.24, unchanged from July.
   Another Commerce Department report showed housing construction
falling 3.3 percent last month, with a steep drop in new
apartments. For the first eighth months of this year, housing
starts are running 9.9 percent below the same period in 1987.
   Analysts said apartment construction has never recovered from
the blow suffered from the elimination of tax shelters in a law
taking effect in January 1987.
   The easing of food price increases had been anticipated by most
analysts. Grocery prices alone were up 0.8 percent last month, but
that compared with a jump of 1.4 percent in July, the biggest
increase in 4{ years.
   ``About 90 percent of the August advance was due to price
increases for items that were adversely affected by the drought _
fruits and vegetables, cereal and bakery products, poultry and
eggs,'' the government said.
   Fruit and vegetable prices rose 1.3 percent atop a 2.9 percent
gain in July. They have jumped a total of 10.6 percent over the
last year. Cereal and bakery product prices were up 1.6 percent,
the largest monthly increase since January 1981, reflecting higher
prices for wheat, oats and eggs, the government said.
   Excluding food, there were wide price swings in both directions.
   The 3 percent increase in gasoline prices, for example, was
partially offset price declines of 1.2 percent for natural gas, 0.8
percent for home heating oil and 0.2 percent for electricity.
   Apparel prices fell another 1.6 percent after smaller declines
in June and July, reflecting what the government said were
unusually large end-of-season discounts for women's clothing.
   But auto financing charges and used car prices jumped 1.5
percent in the month and auto insurance rates climbed another 0.8
percent.
   ``If there is any surprise, it's in the number of large price
changes,'' said Donald Ratajczak, director of economic forecasting
at Georgia State University. ``It indicates that sellers are having
a hard time determining what is an acceptable price in the
marketplace.''
   Ratajczak said preliminary data from his own surveys suggest the
same thing occuring this month.
   ``The big declines in clothing and natural gas prices are
over,'' he said. ``Next month the fall fashions come in, so
clothing should be up sharply. And school tuitions will come in
even bigger.
   ``But the effect of the drought pretty much should have run its
course by then and we shouldn't have another large increase in food
prices,'' Ratajczak said. ``And gasoline prices shouldn't be up.
We'll have a couple of good things and not-so-good things.''

   A conductor of the Soviet Union's Bolshoi
opera defected in Bolivia earlier this month and has been granted
asylum in the United States, State Department officials said
Wednesday.
   Ruben Vartanan, described as one of four or five conductors
associated with the Bolshoi, turned up at the U.S. Embassy in La
Paz about two weeks ago and has since arrived in Washington. He is
scheduled to appear at a news conference on Thursday.
   One official said Vartanan defected while on vacation but the
Jamestown Foundation, a private group that assists defectors and
has arranged for the Thursday news conference, said the artist went
to the U.S. Embassy while on a concert tour.
   According to the officials, Vartanan said he was tired of
artistic restrictions in the Soviet Union. In addition, he told
U.S. officials that his career has not thrived in recent years
because he was perceived by Soviet authorities as having developed
an affinity for life in the West.
   As part of a cultural agreement between Bolivia and the Soviet
Union, Vartanan spent an extended period in Bolivia in the mid
1970's conducting the country's national symphony orchestra, said
the officials, who insisted on anonymity.
   U.S. law provides that asylum may be granted to an alien who has
a ``well-founded fear'' of persecution if he returns to his
homeland, based on race, religion, political views or other
criteria. The granting of asylum to Soviet defectors is virtually
automatic.
   Vartanan is the latest in a long list of Soviet artists who have
defected to the United States.
   Two of the best known over the past decade are Alexander
Godunov, a Bolshoi ballet dancer, and Maxim Shostakovich, a
conductor. Godunov defected in 1979 and Shostakovich in 1981.
   Others include Oles Vidov, a movie star who defected in 1985,
and Nicolai and Bertalina Nikolski, high wire artists, in 1986.

   The FBI said Wednesday it has launched a

for a fatally ill child.
   Ernest and Regina Twigg of Langhorne, Pa., contend someone at
the hospital deliberately switched the children, allegedly to
provide for someone willing to pay to adopt a well baby.
   ``After consultation with the U.S. Attorney's office we have
opened a preliminary investigation to gather facts,'' said Russ
Wood, FBI spokesman. He refused to discuss specifics.
   Meanwhile, the father of a 9-year-old southwest Florida girl
said he will not permit a blood test to satisfy questions about
whether she is the his biological daughter, the St. Petersburg
Times reported Wednesday.
   The Twiggs think the girl may be their daughter and their
lawyer, Marvin Ellin of Baltimore, said sophisticated genetic blood
testing should resolve the question. Ellin said he talked to the
girl's father and ``he indicated that he would think about it.''
   But the father had a different recollection.
   ``I said `No,''' he told the newspaper. ``Our sympathy is there
for their problem, but at some point I have to draw the line. ...
We don't have to prove anything to the world. We already know who
we are.''
   Ellin has filed a $100 million lawsuit against three doctors, a
nurse and Hardee Memorial Hospital in Wauchula. He also has asked
federal authorities to look into the possibility that the babies'
identification bracelets were switched and hospital records altered.
   Arlena Twigg, the child raised by the Pennsylvania couple, died
last month of a lifelong heart problem. A month earlier,
sophisticated blood and tissue testing at Johns Hopkins Hospital in
Baltimore concluded that the girl was not related to the Twiggs.

   The landing gear indicator light on
Democratic vice presidential nominee Lloyd Bentsen's campaign jet
failed in an approach to Sacramento on Wednesday, forcing the pilot
to swoop low for a visual inspection before landing.
   The flight from Lubbock jet landed successfully with no
injuries, as five fire trucks stood by in case of an emergency. In
addition to the visual inspection of the landing gear by the
control tower, a member of the flight crew peeled back the rug of
the Boeing 737 jetliner and checked the gear through a peephole in
the floor.
   The pilot of the America West Airlines charter, Bentsen's
regular campaign jet, said the indicator for the right landing gear
had not shown at the control panel. The visual inspection enabled
the pilot and control tower to determine that the gear had lowered.

<HEAD>Official News Agency Says 10 Killed In Rocket Attack</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Afghanistan's official news agency
said Wednesday that 10 people were killed and eight wounded when
rebels rocketed the capital the day before.
   It contrasted with a Tuesday night report on official Radio
Kabul that indicated 62 people died in the attack.
   The communist Bakhtar news agency said the 10 deaths occurred
when six rockets landed in separate parts of the city late Tuesday
afternoon.
   Radio Kabul, monitored in Islamabad, said in its Pashto-language
broadcast Tuesday night that since the April 14 signing of the
Geneva accord providing for a Soviet troop withdrawal, ``Kabul and
its suburbs were hit by criminals' rockets 15 times, and the 16th
rocket attack took place tonight.
   ``As a result of the attack, 62 innocent people, including women
and children, were killed and 104 were wounded,'' it said.
   But the radio earlier reported the 10 dead, and it appeared the
announcer meant to say there had been a total 62 dead from all 16
attacks.
   Western diplomatic sources have reported the number of guerrilla
rocketings and casualties to be much higher.
   Weekly accounts relayed from Western embassies in Kabul report
incoming rockets almost every day.
   Moslem insurgents fired dozens of rockets into Kabul airport on
Sept. 1 and 5, blowing up a massive ammunition dump and destroying
at least five aircraft. Moscow's Tass news agency put casualties at
nine dead but Western and guerrilla sources said they believed it
was more like 50 or more.
   The guerrillas have been fighting the Marxist government since
the communists seized power in a 1978 military coup.
   Under the Geneva agreement, all of an estimated 100,000 Red Army
troops are to leave Afghanistan by Feb. 15.

   The man died in a Cologne hospital from severe injuries suffered

Rhineland-Palatinate state.
   Dietzen said 84 people remained in hospitals throughout the
country and that 20 were listed in critical condition.
   The catastrophe occurred when three Italian stunt planes
collided while performing at an annual air show at the U.S. Air

<TEXT>
   U.S. officials expect little progress in arms
control talks Thursday between Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze and President Reagan, in large part because the
administration and Congress cannot agree on what strategic weapons
to deploy in the future.
   ``We certainly know we can't finish the START (Strategic Arms
Reduction Talks) treaty this year,'' Assistant Secretary of State
Rozanne Ridgway told a congressional panel Tuesday.
   The U.S. presidential election makes it hard to hammer out the
incredibly complex details of a START agreement during Reagan's
remaining four months in office, particularly the inspection
regimes needed to verify proposed 30 percent to 50 percent cuts in
strategic weapons systems.
   Besides the devilish details, however, the United States has
reached an impasse in its own strategic planning that vastly
complicates efforts to conclude an arms control treaty, an
agreement that would govern the deployment of American forces for
decades.
   Shevardnadze, who was arriving Wednesday afternoon, was to meet
Thursday with Reagan, Secretary of State George Shultz and Vice
President George Bush.
   The talks, say U.S. officials, will concentrate mainly on the
non-arms aspects of the administration's four-point agenda:
bilateral relations, human rights and multilateral issues such as
the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan and Cuban troops
from Angola.
   Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev made little
progress on arms control at the June summit in Moscow, and movement
will probably be slow well into the next administration, according
to many observers in the administration and on Capitol Hill.
   The three key stumbling blocks are the Star Wars program to
develop land-and space-based anti-missile weapons, the development
and deployment of mobile intercontinental ballistic missiles
(ICBMs), and whether to control submarine launched cruise missiles
(SLCMs).
   The Soviets oppose a START deal without a U.S. commitment that
Star Wars research will not break the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile
treaty for a set period of time, probably eight to 10 years.
   The Soviets also want the United States to agree to a limit on
nuclear-tipped submarine-launched cruise missiles, above the
overall 6,000-warhead limit agreed upon in the proposed START
treaty.
   On the third major issue, the United States is pressing for a
ban on all ground-launched mobile ICBM's, which would require the
Soviets to dismantle their already deployed SS-24 and SS-25 mobile
missiles.
   The United States has not decided whether or how to deploy a
mobile missile. The administration and Congress are sparring on
whether to develop a 10-warhead rail-mobile MX missile, similar to
the Soviet SS-24, or a single-warhead road-mobile Midgetman,
similar to the Soviet SS-25.
   Reagan vetoed Congress' defense authorization bill for the
fiscal year beginning Oct. 1 in part because it provided only about
$4 billion for Star Wars versus the administration request of $4.8
billion, and because Congress insisted that Star Wars tests not
violate the ABM pact.
   The potential conflict between the ABM treaty and Star Wars,
formally known as the Strategic Defense Initiative or SDI, has
dominated public discussion of arms control for years.
   But it may be diverting attention from other crucial issues.
Even SDI advocates such as former White House national security
adviser Robert McFarlane acknowledge that ``we do not know and
cannot know for the next 10 or 15 years'' whether SDI's ``defensive
technologies provide the means to defend us against ballistic
missiles.
   U.S. negotiators have rejected Soviet proposals for putting
limits on nuclear-tipped submarine-launched cruise missiles,
weaponry in which the United States holds a technological and
numerical lead.
   ``We have not seen any way to verify such limits without, in
effect, giving up our Navy'' to Soviet inspection and control,
Assistant Secretary of Defense Ron Lehman in an interview last week.
   Despite the U.S. lead in cruise missiles launched by submarines,
this could turn out to be a problem for the United States in the
future.
   Although the Soviets have fewer cruise missiles deployed aboard
their submarines, they have the world's densest anti-aircraft
system, estimated by the Pentagon to consist of 12,000 missiles.
And most Soviet cities and military targets are located deep within
the country, presenting slow-moving cruise missiles with a long
potential flight time.
   The United States, in contrast, has virtually no anti-air
defenses along its extensive coastlines, and major U.S. cities lie
right on the east and west coasts.
   Shortly before Reagan flew to Moscow for the summit there, the
House Armed Services Committee issued a report urging the
administration to take a long, hard look at U.S. strategic forces,
and determine what it wanted before concluding a new arms control
accord. The treaty appears no closer than it did then, but neither
does domestic agreement on the shape of the U.S. strategic arsenal.

   A Colorado drug manufacturer is recalling 50
million carbamazepine tablets for epilepsy treatment because they
do not dissolve properly and thus may not be as effective as
intended, the Food and Drug Administration said Wednesday.
   The tablets are not harmful, but may not control or prevent
seizures as well as they should, the agency said.
   ``I would advise patients to continue with their daily regimen
of the tablets, which may be effective for most people, until they
can be replaced,'' said FDA Commissioner Frank E. Young.
   Patients will not be able to identify the recalled tablets
themselves and should check with their pharmacies, the FDA said.
   The 200-milligram tablets are round, white and marked on one
side with one of three designations: 35@15, C66 or 832@G133.
   Pharmacies can check with information supplied to them by the
manufacturer, Pharmaceutical Basics Inc., of Denver, to determine
whether particular tablets are among the recalled lots.

   If one picture is worth a thousand words,
then how much is one word worth? Math teacher Richard Oyer wants
his seventh- and eighth-grade students to find one that's worth $1
million.
   Oyer, a teacher at Mid-Prairie Junior High School, assigned each
letter of the alphabet a value _ A equals $1, B equals $2, and so
on to Z, which is worth $26 _ and challenged his students to find a
word tha, when the letters' numerical value is multiplied, equals
$1 million.
   For example, the word ``cab'' would be $6: C ($3) times A ($1)
times B ($2).
   The reward for finding a winning word is best expressed with a
letter not a numeral.
   ``The first student that brings it in gets an `A' on the
assignment,'' Oyer said.
   Proper names are not allowed. The word has to be in the
dictionary.
   Oyer said he knows of at least two words worth a million,
although students have yet to find one. So far, the closest is
village, at $997,920, located by Heidi Troyer, an eighth-grader.
   Oyer said he cannot take credit for designing the competition.
``It's not original with me. It came from The Arithmetic Teacher,
put out by the National Council of the Teachers of Math,'' he said.

   The opponents of Montana's ``bottle bill''
are looking for a fast talker.
   State law says any political action committee must include its
name in recorded or printed advertisements.
   The opponents of Initiative 113 are officially known as the
Committee Against Forced Deposits: Montana Grocers, Recyclers, Soft
Drink Bottlers, Beer Distributors, Container Manufacturers and
their National Affiliates, and other Montana Businesses and
Concerned Citizens.
   It takes about 14 seconds for most people to read the group's
name slowly, Capps said, and the committee needs to cram that into
its radio and TV spots.
   The name _ CAFDMGRSDBBDCMNAMBCC for short _ was adopted to
ostentatiously satisfy a requirement enforced by the state
Commissioner of Political Practices that committee names accurately
reflect the opponents' interests. Bottle bill backers had gotten
the commissioner to throw out two simpler names the committee
adopted.
   ``If we're going to have to make a mockery about what we're
doing, it's best to bring it out in the open,'' committee treasurer
Frank Capps said Monday.
   The ballot initiative would require 5-cent deposits on bottles
and cans containing carbonated beverages.

   The new El Dorado County jail would
be ready to open except for one problem: the cell doors won't lock.
   Faulty electronics have affected the high technology locks,
along with television monitors and a communication system, Jail
Commander Ed Newman said recently.
   ``These are very dramatic problems,'' said Newman, adding that
13 flawed electronic panels are ``literally the hands and feet of
the officers.'' The panels have been shipped to a Maryland
electronics company to be reworked and won't be back for three
weeks.
   The jail's design relies on a central control post from which
guards can electronically open and close cell doors, communicate
with inmates and operate lights.
   To compensate the county for the delays, General Services
Director Joe Winslow said the jail's contractor, F&H Construction,
is paying a daily penalty of $1,250 that started Sept. 6.

   Ivana Trump, wife of billionaire

Greenwich home because of the sense of normalcy the town provides.
   ``I think the quality of the living in Greenwich is just
special,'' Mrs. Trump, 38, said in a recent interview. ``The
people, they mind their own business. As much as we can be free,
the Trumps can be free in Greenwich.
   ``When we come to our country home, we really want to be
together as a family. We don't want to go to parties. In Greenwich,
there is not a big social life. Maybe there is, but I don't know
about it.
   ``I want, let's say, to put on the pants and the T-shirt and the
gloves, and go and dig in the garden. We like to go to the movie
theaters and the people don't approach you. They're distinguished
enough that they just leave you alone.''
   The Austrian-born Mrs. Trump was raised in Czechoslovakia. She

and her husband have three children, ages 10, 6 and 4.
   The Trumps have homes in Greenwich, Palm Beach, Fla., and New
York. Mrs. Trump works with her husband in his many business
ventures. Business Week estimated the total value of Trump's
holdings as more than $3 billion.
   As for her much-publicized salary of ``$1 a year and all the

a team. We are working together. We are building our empire

<HEAD>Tobacco Supply Drops Despite Big Crop</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Despite a larger tobacco crop this year, a
drop in inventories points to a smaller total supply in the 1988-89
marketing season, the Agriculture Department said Wednesday.
   ``Stocks entering the new marketing year likely will equal 2.85
billion pounds, about 14 percent lower than a year earlier,'' the
department's Economic Research Service said in a new outlook
report. ``Although surpluses continue for some kinds and grades,
there are shortages for others.''
   Nationally, the 1988 tobacco harvest is up about 10 percent from
last year because of increased acreage and greater yields, due to
better weather for flue-cured and some other kinds of tobacco. Dry
weather kept burley yields below normal, but those still were up
from last year's low levels.
   ``Prospects for world tobacco use next season indicate a small
increase in sales and use of cigarettes and unmanufactured
tobacco,'' the report said. ``U.S. tobacco use may increase from
1987-88's 1.66 billion pounds because of greater use of
domestically grown tobacco in U.S. cigarettes and higher cigarette
production.''
   The report said U.S. cigarette output this year is expected to
increase from 689 billion ``pieces'' in 1987 because of rising
exports.
   However, cigarette consumption among Americans 18 years and
older is expected to continue a long-term decline, dropping around
1{ percent this year from an average of 3,196 cigarettes in 1987,
which was the lowest since World War II. Cigarette use peaked at
4,345 pieces _ about 217 packs of 20 cigarettes each _ in 1963.
   The cigarette use figures are estimates that include smokers and
non-smokers alike and are used as statistical comparisons from year
to year.

   Apartment construction in August sunk to the
lowest level in more than six years, outweighing a small gain in
single-family home building, the government said Wednesday.
   The Commerce Department said housing construction fell 3.3
percent last month to an annual level of 1.44 million units. A 16.9
percent plunge in the volatile apartment category to 350,000 units
more than offset a 2.1 percent gain in single-family homes to 1.09
million units.
   The single-family home category has fluctuated in a fairly
narrow range this year at an annual rate of around 1.1 million
units. However, the apartment sector has approached a rate of
500,000 units in some months and now rests at its lowest point
since June 1982, when the last recession was ending.
   ``The single-family level is pretty good. It's been an
incredibly stable element of the market, but the multi-unit number
is staggering,'' said David Seiders, chief economist of the
National Association of Home Builders.
   Analysts have been expecting housing activity to taper off
because the Federal Reserve Board has been pushing up interest
rates since late March in an effort to curb inflation.
   But, Seiders said home buyers appear to be turning to adjustable
rate mortgages, which cost less than fixed-rate mortgages but whose
rates can change.
   Also, fixed-rate mortgages have not risen as fast as many
economists were expecting. According to the Federal Home Loan
Mortgage Corp., fixed-rate mortgages, not including add-on fees
known as points, hit a high of 10.71 percent in mid-August but have
since eased, dropping to 10.4 percent last week.
   The overall decline in August housing starts followed gains of
1.4 percent in July and 5.2 percent in June.
   For the first eight months of 1988, housing starts have been
running 9.9 percent below the level of activity during the same
period in 1987. Single-family construction is lagging by 6.7
percent while apartment construction trails by 17.6 percent.
   Mark Obrinsky, an economist with the U.S. League of Savings
Institutions, said apartment construction was dealt a heavy blow
when the tax law that took effect in January 1987 reduced the
profitability of real estate investments. Also, vacancy rates are
high.
   The vacancy rate for rental housing was 7.7 percent in the
April-June period this year, compared with rates between 5 percent
and 6 percent through the 1960s and 1970s, he said.
   Building permits, a good barometer of future housing activity,
were up 1.9 percent last month to 1.45 million units a year, after
falling 4.9 percent in July.
   By region, housing starts fell 20.7 percent in the Northeast to
207,000 units and 17.2 percent in the Midwest to 240,000.
   Starts were up 14.3 percent in the West to 424,000 units and up
0.4 percent in the South to 565,000.
   ``The Northeast is taking a beating now,'' said Michael
Sumichrast, a private housing economist in Washington. ``The New
York sales market is practically dead. It's still suffering from
the financial market collapse'' and layoffs in the securities
industry.

   Former Teamsters President Roy L.
Williams could be paroled from federal prison as soon as Tuesday
under the recommendation of a U.S. Parole Commission panel, his
lawyer said Wednesday.
   F. Russell Millin said the commission is to act on the
recommendation of the parole examiners by Friday, a deadline
imposed by a federal judge, Millin said. The commission is not
bound by the recommendation, but a spokesman told The Kansas City
Star such recommendations are followed 90 percent of the time.
   Joseph Korbinsky, a commission spokesman in Washington, refused
to disclose the examiners' recommendation after the hearing in
Springfield.
   Williams was convicted in 1982 of conspiring to bribe former
U.S. Sen. Howard Cannon of Nevada to influence trucking
deregulation. Williams, a longtime Kansas City area labor leader,
was forced to resign the union presidency, which he had held for
about a year, following his conviction.
   The commission's guidelines called for his release after 24 to
36 months of the 10-year sentence he began serving in December 1985.
   But the commission set Williams' parole date in 1990 after his
links to organized crime were established by testimony he gave in
another case. Earlier this month, the commission set a new date of
Jan. 13, 1989, saying it was a reward for Williams' cooperation and
in consideration of his health. Williams, 73, suffers from
emphysema and an enlarged heart.
   U.S. District Judge William R. Collinson reviewed Williams'
petition for release and ruled last month that the parole
commission was unconstitutionally punishing him for admissions the
government forced him to make about his links to reputed mob
leaders. He said he would order Williams' release Friday if the
board did not reconsider his parole.
   Bruce C. Houdek, a second Kansas City lawyer representing
Williams, said the examiners said their recommendation would
include a condition that Williams ``would continue to cooperate
with the authorities.''
   Houdek said Williams told examiners Tuesday that ``he was sick
and wanted to go home to his farm in Leeton.''

   A World War II bomber on a test flight
crashed into a heavily populated area of Bogota Wednesday, but only
two people were reported killed, a civil air official said.
   The pilot and copilot died, Col. Edgar Lozano, chief of
operations for Colombia's Civil Aeronautics Administration, said in
a broadcast interview with the Bogota radio station RCN.
   No one on the ground was killed or injured, Lozano said.
   The two-engine B-26 had been reconstructed and was on a test
flight. The plane had been in the air only two minutes when the
pilot told the tower at Bogota's El Dorado international airport
that he had engine failure, the colonel said.
   The plane came close to hitting two condominiums and skipped
along the roofs of three houses, he said.
   The plane crashed at 12:30 p.m. in northern Bogota near the
intersection of 127th Street and Suba Avenue, one of the capital's
busiest areas.

<HEAD>Suspended Military Base Talks to Restart, Minister Meeting Dukakis</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Negotiations on U.S. use of Greek military
bases will resume in Athens early next month, Greek Foreign
Minister Karolos Papoulias announced Wednesday after meeting with
Secretary of State George Shultz.
   But there has been no change on the deadlocked issue that
prompted a U.S. break off of the talks Sept. 5 _ Greece's demand
for U.S. forces to vacate Hellenikon air base at Athens
International Airport, Papoulias told reporters.
   Besides Hellenikon, the five-year U.S.-Greece bases agreement
expiring this year covers the Nea Makri U.S. communications base
near Athens, a naval and an air base on the island of Crete and 20
smaller installations.
   Hellenikon is an issue on which the Greek and American sides
``have taken different opinions.... However, the outcome of the
negotiations cannot be judged at this point; they can only be
judged when the negotiations are completed,'' Papoulias said.
   The foreign minister, who described his State Department talks
as constructive, said negotiations would resume the first week of
October.
   Departing from wide-ranging discussions and lunch with Shultz
and other senior U.S. officials at the State Department, Papoulias
said he was flying to Boston on Wednesday afternoon to meet
Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, the Democratic presidential
nominee whose parents were born in Greece.
   The election campaign has stirred intense interest in Greece,
``well-justified because Dukakis is the son of Greek immigrants to
America,'' Papoulias said.
   The foreign minister sought meetings with both Dukakis and his
Republican rival, Vice President George Bush, said Achilles
Paparsenos, the Greek Embassy press attache. A Bush meeting has not
yet been fixed for Papoulias, who plans to attend the U.N. General
Assembly next week in New York, the attache said.
   After seeing Dukakis, the Greek foreign minister plans to return
to Washington for meetings Thursday with several members of
Congress and with Commerce Secretary William Verity and U.S. Trade
Representative Clayton Yeutter in his dual capacity as the current
ministerial chief of the European Economic Community, Paparsenos
said.
   Those attending the lunch Wednesday with Papoulias included
Ambassador Alan H. Flanigan, the chief U.S. negotiator, who
suspended the Athens talks earlier this month to return to
Washington for instructions on the surprise Greek demand to quit
Hellenikon.
   Papoulias also met with Assistant Secretary of State Rozanne
Ridgway, who on Tuesday described Hellenikon as a central issue in
the negotiations. The United States has a contingency plan for
quitting Hellenikon if there is no agreement, but has not started
any preparations to leave, she told a congressional hearing.
   The U.S. bases issue does not affect the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization because the agreement under renegotiation is a
bilateral matter not covering use of the installations by NATO,
Papoulias said.
   Urban development and congestion around Athens airport are major
reasons Greece wants U.S. forces to quit Hellenikon, Paparsenos
said.
   Shultz briefed Papoulias on the U.S.-Soviet dialogue and the two
discussed U.S.-Common market trade relations, the Middle East,
southern African and East-West issues, the foreign minister said.

   U.S. District Judge Oliver Gasch refused
Wednesday to bar the Department of Housing and Urban Development
from selling single-family homes it had acquired through mortgage
foreclosures to the highest bidder.
   Gasch issued an order denying a preliminary injunction requested
by a coalition of advocates for the homeless but said the reasons
for his ruling would be made public later.
   Two temporary restraining orders, issued last month, prevented
HUD from selling houses in Michigan and Washington, D.C. and its
suburbs.
   HUD general counsel J. Michael Dorsey, commenting on the
decision, said through the press office that the department's
inventory of 47,000 foreclosed houses would go on sale Thursday
morning through its field offices.
   ``HUD will continue to make certain single-family acquired
properties available to homeless providers through lease and
discount sales programs,'' he said.
   The coalition, represented by the National Housing Law Project,
had argued that HUD had violated the law by selling its stock of
foreclosed single-family homes to the highest bidder without
determining whether they could be beneficial to the homeless and
low-income people.
   Gasch was told by the coalition last Friday that HUD receives
70,000 houses each year - about 7,000 a month - but the agency
``cannot proceed as if it is simply in the real estate business.
They must consider the homeless,'' said attorney William Bradford.
   ``We are disappointed that he did not grant the preliminary
injunction,'' Bradford said of Wednesday's order. However, he
declined further comment until a written opinion is issued by Gasch.
   HUD has said that it generally sells the homes to the highest
bidders -frequently investors - but insists that it has several
programs designed to help homeless people find places to live.
   Recently, HUD has been selling an average of 7,100 properties
each month -houses that had Federal Housing Administration mortgage
insurance and that went into foreclosure when their owners could no
longer keep up the mortgage payments. The program has produced some
$2.4 billion in proceeds since Oct. 1, the start of the current
fiscal year.
   HUD officials had argued that the temporary restraining orders,
if upheld, could cost the agency $3 billion a year and bankrupt its
single-family mortgage insurance fund.

   A 30-day jail sentence will ``continue to hang
over'' Glenda Brawley even though she and her family have moved to
Virginia after months of controversy over an alleged racially
tinged sexual assault, authorities said Wednesday.
   Mrs. Brawley is the mother of Tawana Brawley, the black
teen-ager who said she was abducted and raped by a gang of white
men.
   ``At any point for the rest of her life, if she returns to the
state of New York, she is subject to being arrested,'' said Timothy
Gilles, a spokesman for state Attorney General Robert Abrams, said.
   Gilles did not say if authorities would pursue the Brawleys in
Virginia or ask for help from authorities there.
   The Wappingers Falls family left the state several weeks ago
after Mrs. Brawley was sentenced for refusing to testify before a
grand jury investigating the allegations made by her daughter.
   ``Tawana wanted to go to school in a normal setting,'' the Rev.
Al Sharpton, an adviser to the family, said Wednesday. ``People (in
Wappingers Falls) were constantly looking at her in class as a
victim of this rape.''
   He said the family would remain in Virginia Beach, Va., at least
through the end of the school year.
   Following the advice of the Sharpton and attorneys C. Vernon
Mason and Alton Maddox, the family has refused to cooperate with
investigators. They maintain the criminal justice system
discriminates against minorities.
   The New York Daily News said Miss Brawley is attending the Floyd
E. Kellam High School.
   The Brawleys' new home is in an apartment complex that has a
racquetball court, pool, whirlpool, sun deck, jogging trail,
volleyball court and clubhouse, the News said. Rent is about $600 a
month.
   Miss Brawley, reported missing for four days last November, was
found in a plastic garbage bag with excrement smeared and racial
epithets written on her body.
   Abrams was named special prosecutor and a grand jury began
investigating the teen-ager's charges, but it has been thwarted by
the family's refusal to testify. The grand jury also reportedly
voted to subpoena Miss Brawley but she has stayed out of state to
avoid being served with the summons.
   A grand jury is expected to issue a report on its seven-month
investigation within several weeks. Abrams has said the panel has
not been able to substantiate Miss Brawley's claims.

<HEAD>Walesa Says Changes in System, Not Faces, Needed</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Solidarity's Lech Walesa, commenting on
the resignation of Prime Minister Zbigniew Messner's government,
said Wednesday that Poland does not need another personnel shakeup,
but a change in the system.
   The influential communist weekly Polityka gave front-page play
Wednesday to a deputy's remarks in Parliament that the government
lacks independence and is too subordinate to the Polish United
Workers (Communist) Party.
   Messner and all 19 of his Cabinet ministers, under attack for
their handling of the economy, stepped down Monday in the first
mass resignation of the government in Poland's postwar history.
   The Sejm, or parliament, is scheduled to meet Sept. 27 to name a
new prime minister, who would have a brief period to assemble a new
government, the state-run PAP news service said.
   Under Poland's political system, the party is the ultimate seat
of power. It appoints the government through its mandated majority
in parliament. The party sets goals, and it is the responsibility
of the government to execute them.
   ``I am against personnel shakeups. I am for systematic
changes,'' Walesa, a Nobel Peace laureate, said in a telephone
interview.
   ``If the personnel changes don't bring about any systematic
changes, then they are good for nothing.''
   Walesa said, however, that removal of Messner and his Cabinet
``may enable certain systematic changes.'' He said the government
had been ``burdened by negative solutions.''
   His remarks were echoed by journalist Tadeusz Mazowiecki, a
senior adviser to the outlawed Solidarity free trade union movement
which Walesa helped found and formerly headed.
   Mazowiecki said the government changes would be positive ``if
one were to look at it as a manifestation of some broader changes .
.. If it is to be only a personnel shakeup, then we are not
interested.''
   Deputy Mikolaj Kozakiewicz told parliament on Monday that the
government cannot be held responsible for Poland's problems because
it lacks freedom of action. He cited the dominance of the party
apparatus over day-to-day government affairs.
   ``I am only stating aloud what everybody has known for some
time, that under the present political system, the government has
not been, and is not, sovereign,'' Kozakiewicz, a reform-minded
member of the communist-allied Peasant Party, said.
   ``It is impossible to institute radical economic and
socio-political changes without an equally radical change in the
manner of exercising the leading role of the party.''
   Polityka on Wednesday ran a front-page story on the government's
removal, under a headline saying: ``Government Collapsed, Problems
Remained.''
   The article devoted considerable space to Kozakiewicz's remarks
and commented, ``In our country, the crisis has covered the whole
system of ruling, and it is not new faces in the government that
will help overcome it.''

   Dissident Kenyan lawyer Gibson Kamau Kuria won
the 1988 Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights Award, judges for the fifth
annual prize said Wednesday in an attack on human-rights conditions
in Kenya.
   A statement announcing the $30,000 award said Kuria was
imprisoned without trial from February to December of 1987,
including nine months in solitary confinement, and was subjected to
mental and physical abuse.
   ``He was forced to stand naked before his interrogators'' and
was threatened with death and denied medical care and legal
assistance, it said.
   ``President (Daniel arap) Moi has presided over a steady
deterioration of the rule of law,'' said Rose Styron, chair of the
judges panel. ``Kenya today is a land where only the animals are
truly free.''
   ``Murder, torture, intimidation have all served to twist a
peaceful land into a perverse nation,'' she said. ``A patriot like
Gibson Kamau Kuria is punished and humiliated for defending the
rights of his fellow citizens.''
   The announcement of the award _ to honor people ``who strike out
against injustice and oppression at great personal risk'' _ was
made by Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, daughter of the former U.S.
senator and attorney general.
   Kuria is to be honored at a ceremony at Georgetown University in
Washington Nov. 15, but the statement said he had been denied a
passport to leave Kenya.

   Rioters burned homes and cars, and gunfire rang
throughout a city at the heart of an annexation battle between the
southern Soviet republics of Armenia and Azerbaijan, the official
Tass news agency reported Wednesday.
   Officials in Azerbaijan's disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh
imposed a curfew and banned gatherings to cool ethnic passions
after violence broke out Tuesday and Wednesday in and around
Stepanakert, the territory's largest city.
   In Yerevan, capital of neighboring Armenia, officials rejected a
demand by thousands of protesters for a new meeting of the
republic's Supreme Soviet, or parliament, to renew a petition for
annexation of Nagorno-Karabakh, a mountain enclave.
   ``There are hundreds of thousands of people in front of the
Supreme Soviet,'' said Arpenay Popoyan, wife of activist and former
political prisoner Rafael Popoyan.
   ``The city is very tense,'' she said in a telephone interview
from Yerevan. A general strike that began Sept. 16 continued.
   Her husband said later by telephone that a government
announcement was read on Armenian television declaring such a
session by the Supreme Soviet would be illegal and rejecting the
demand.
   ``This answer is a violation of the constitution,'' said Popoyan.
   He said by law a session must be held if one-third of the
Supreme Soviet deputies request it, and he said more than one-third
have signed such a request.
   The Soviet government Wednesday banned foreign journalists from
traveling to Yerevan from Tbilisi, Georgia, for ``temporary
reasons.''
   Tass said no one was injured in the disturbances in
Nagorno-Karabakh.
   The gunfire and arson by ethnic rioters in Stepanakert and
vicinity followed a gun battle Sunday in the nearby village of
Khadzhaly. One man died and at least 25 people were wounded.
Activists also said a bomb exploded Monday at a dormitory for
Armenian construction workers near Stepanakert.
   ``All this created an alarming situation. Many residents in the
central city of Stepanakert and rural regions are worried about
their safety,'' Tass said.
   Tass did not say whether Armenians, Azerbaijanis or both were
behind the violence.
   It said homes and cars were set afire in Nagorno-Karabakh
Tuesday night and Wednesday morning and that shots were heard. It
said factories, schools and transportation companies were closed in
Stepanakert.
   The Nagorno-Karabakh Communist Party and Council of People's
Deputies said in an appeal to the population, ``In the current
situation, various kinds of meetings, demonstrations, marches and
gatherings can aggravate the situation further.''
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, speaking in
Copenhagen, Denmark, said without elaborating that the Kremlin was
considering the use of ``some emergency action'' to deal with the
rising unrest.
   The Stepanakert and Agdam regions of Nagorno-Karabakh were
placed on a ``special status,'' lower than a state of emergency,
and a curfew was imposed, Tass said.
   Telephone calls to Stepanakert did not go through.
   Popoyan said soldiers patrolled Stepanakert and received
permission to search houses at will.
   ``People are simply sitting home and not going anywhere.
Naturally, they're not going to work,'' he said.
   Although Nagorno-Karabakh is part of Azerbaijan, it is
predominantly Armenian. Residents began agitating in February for
annexation to Armenia.
   Popoyan said in a telephone interview earlier Wednesday that
military units were in Yerevan but not visible on the streets.
   Popoyan said Armenians were demanding that the annexation issue
be reconsidered because the government ``can no longer guarantee
the safety of Armenians living in Nagorno-Karabakh.''
   The Armenian parliament made a similar appeal to the national
government in June, but Azerbaijan opposed it and the central
government rejected the idea. Instead, central authorities
developed a plan of economic and social development.
   About 25 Armenians at an Armenian cemetery in Moscow Wednesday
afternoon criticized the Soviet press for what they called
unbalanced reporting on disturbances in the southern republics.
   Thirty-two people were killed in ethnic rioting in Sumgait, an
industrial city of Azerbaijan, at the end of February.
   Some calm returned after the national Supreme Soviet on July 18
rejected annexation. A handful of foreign journalists was permitted
to visit Yerevan this month before the city was closed again.

   The time for the debate between vice

   Bob Neuman of the Commission on Presidential Debates said the
commission has informally approached ABC television and
representatives of the Quayle and Bentsen campaigns about adjusting

   The Oct. 5 debate at the Omaha City Auditorium is scheduled to

   Neuman said the debate commission hopes the starting times of

the debate.
   ``We're hoping for a little give and take on both sides,''
Neuman said, adding that no formal negotiations had begun.
   ``We're just making inquiries right now,'' he said.
   ABC News spokeswoman Joanne Berg said the network's coverage
plans for the debate have not been completed.

   A dam collapse in western Nigeria let
loose a wall of water that killed several people and left 100,000
homeless in a low-lying farming area, government-run radio and a
newspaper reported Wednesday.
   The dam was the fourth to give way in Nigeria in recent weeks
because of torrential rains, the heaviest in western Africa in two
decades.
   The rains killed more than 130 people and left hundreds of
thousands homeless.
   Radio Nigeria said a concrete dam collapsed Tuesday on the
Enrinle River in Oyo state, flooding farmland and damaging bridges.
It said precise casualty figures were not immediately available,
but Punch newspaper reported several deaths.
   Nigeria earlier reported that heavy flooding in a wide area
across the country's northern tier had claimed at least 50 lives.
Many victims died when their homes collapsed. Others drowned. Three
were reported killed by crocodiles that were swept into their
villages.
   Benin, Nigeria's western neighbor, appealed Sunday for help for
more than 100,000 people without shelter there after the rains.
   In the Sahel, the dry stretch of land on the southern fringe of
the Sahara, Burkina Faso has reported 16 dead, many roads washed
out and farmland flooded. Niger reported 13 deaths. Rains in Chad
took 49 lives.
   On the West African coast, heavy rains have been nearly wiped
out the rice crops of Liberia and Sierra Leone. The rains do
promise, however, the best harvests since two decades of drought
began in the Sahel.

<HEAD>Jesse Jackson Half-Brother Jailed In Gang-linked Slaying</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GREENVILLE, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chicago businessman Noah Robinson, Jesse
Jackson's half-brother, remained jailed Wednesday on murder charges
in a case described by authorities as a gangland-style execution.
   ``This is absolutely the most complicated case we've ever worked
on,'' said Detective Keith Morton. He said Tuesday's arrest follows
a 2{-year investigation that took him to Chicago 10 times in the
past year.
   Robinson was the sixth person charged with murder in the 1986
slaying of Leroy ``Hambone'' Barber outside a Greenville business
owned by Robinson. Five others, alleged members of Chicago's El
Rukn street gang, were charged several weeks ago.
   Barber once worked for Robinson in Chicago and the two men had
had several altercations over the years, the Greenville Piedmont
reported Wednesday.
   Robinson, 46, surrendered Tuesday and was being held at the
Greenville County Detention Center. A bond hearing Wednesday was
postponed at the request of Robinson's attorneys and was not
immediately rescheduled.
   The warrant charging Robinson said witnesses and co-defendants
allege that Robinson hired people to murder Barber.
   Matt Hawley, deputy assistant solicitor, said his office
probably will seek the death penalty against Robinson. Hawley said
under state law hiring, directing or soliciting a murder is
considered an aggravating circumstance.
   The Rev. J.M. Flemming, a Greenville pastor, distributed a
statement by Robinson that said: ``I had no role in or no knowledge
of that killing prior to it happening.''
   In the statement, Robinson said the case against him was based
on information given to police by El Rukns who have criminal
records and were offered cash and lenient sentences in exchange for
testifying against him.
   He attacked their credibility and provided the arrest records of
some co-defendants who he said were cooperating with the
investigation.
   Robinson's attorney, Robert F. Simone of Philadelphia, described
Robinson's case as a relatively simple one.
   Simone said Wednesday the case ``has to do with whether you
believe the government's informants. It's all a question of
credibility or believability.''
   Robinson owns a construction company and several other
enterprises across the country. He has maintained that he is a
victim of a political conspiracy caused partly by the success of
his half-brother.
   Robinson and Jackson share the same father, but the former
Democratic presidential hopeful has said he has had no recent
contact with his half-brother.
   Jackson said from his Chicago home Wednesday that he was
unfamiliar with the particulars of Robinson's case.
   ``It would be ill-advised to comment on something I know nothing
about,'' he said. Asked how he felt about the death penalty in
general, Jackson said, ``I choose not to comment on any of it at
this time.''
   The Greenville Piedmont reported that Robinson and Barber were
childhood friends in Greenville. In 1977, Robinson hired Barber as
a janitor in Chicago.
   Four years later, Barber and another Greenville man robbed
Robinson at gunpoint. Barber was sent to prison for the robbery,
but Robinson rehired him when he was released in 1984, the
newspaper said.
   Authorities have alleged that five El Rukns shot Barber in the
head Jan. 2, 1986, after he was called to a pay telephone outside a
lounge in Greenville. A former gang member, Tramell Davis, has told
authorities that the leader of the El Rukns ordered Barber killed
for harassing Robinson.
   Robinson said a few days before Christmas in 1985, Barber
punched him in the face while he was visiting his parents in
Greenville, the newspaper said.

<HEAD>Police Kept in Dark So IRA Agents Could Enter, Policeman Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GIBRALTAR (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A top Gibraltar police officer testified
Wednesday that this British colony's border officials were
purposely kept uninformed about an anti-terrorist operation to
permit an IRA unit to enter unhindered from Spain.
   The operation resulted in British commandos shooting and killing
three unarmed Irish Republican Army members on March 6.
   Gibraltar Police Chief Inspector Joe Ullger told a coroner's
inquest that neither Gibraltar immigration officers nor those in
customs were informed of the operation because ``the only way for
it to succeed was to allow the terrorists to come in'' to the
colony.
   His disclosure came under cross-examination on the 12th day of
the inquest into the deaths of Sean Savage, 24, Daniel McCann, 30,
and Mairead Farrell, 31.
   Members of Britain's elite Special Air Service (SAS) branch of
the military, who fired more than two dozen bullets into the bodies
of Farrell, McCann and Savage, testified that the anti-IRA mission
had been to arrest the three.
   Another witness, Gibraltar resident Josephine Celecia, testified
Wednesday that from her second-floor bedroom window, she saw one of
the soldiers standing over two fallen bodies at a filling station
across the street, and then heard four or five shots fired.
   She said that earlier she had seen McCann and Ms. Farrell
walking together toward the border.
   ``I looked away and then heard two loud bangs,'' she said.
   Mrs. Celecia said when she looked back she saw ``a man whose
hands were pointing towards the ground with two people lying
there.''
   She said she then heard four or five more shots.
   Michael Hucker, the lawyer for the seven SAS commandos involved
in the operation, challenged her statements.
   ``A lot of this (you're saying) just isn't the truth,'' Hucker
said. ``The events have been muddled over the months.''
   ``I'm just saying what I saw,'' Mrs. Celecia said.
   The seven commandos and several British intelligence officers
have testified they believed the three were armed and dangerous and
on a mission to set off a car bomb in Gibraltar by a radio-control
device when they were shot.
   The commandos who did the shooting said they fired with intent
to kill when the three answered their challenge with ``sudden and
aggressive movements.''
   After the shootings, police found no radio-control device and no
bomb in the car parked by Savage in Gibraltar, but the IRA
acknowledged the three were members on active service.
   Two days later police found a car linked to the IRA unit packed
with 141 pounds of Czechoslovak-made explosives in nearby Marbella,
Spain.
   Critics of British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's government
have claimed the deaths show an unofficial ``shoot-to-kill'' policy
against IRA members. The outlawed IRA seeks unification between
Protestant-dominated Northern Ireland and the Roman Catholic Irish
republic.
   The inquest has no powers of prosecution, but is expected to
determine whether the soldiers' actions were lawful.
   Ullger acted as liaison between police officials directing the
operation and Gibraltar's undercover police surveillance team. He
said Spanish police were informed of the operation and were given
photos of the three, but failed to spot them.

<HEAD>EPA Cites Drinking Water as Possible Source of Household Radon</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Radon gas evaporating out of drinking water
could be ``as large a contaminant as anything we're dealing with,''
the head of drinking water programs at the Environmental Protection
Agency said Wednesday.
   Water-source radon every year probably accounts for a few
hundred fatal lung cancers caused by breathing radon indoors, which
the agency has estimated could total as many as 20,000 deaths a
year, said Mike Cook, director of the agency's Office of Drinking
Water.
   Radon, a radioactive gas that can be concentrated in houses,
generally arises from the soil beneath a home, working its way
through foundation cracks or other entrances.
   But experts have known for several years that water can carry
radon, posing its danger not in the drinking of the water but by
liberating into the air in showers, washing machines and other ways.
   Cook commented in an interview on a discussion on the ``USA
Today Television Show'' quoting results of a survey of wells across
the country that said 72 percent had ``dangerously high'' radon
levels.
   Cook did not use the term ``dangerous.'' He said the poll
findings referred to a water contamination of radon that would
increase the risk of getting lung cancer by about one in 10,000,
the risk level used informally by some EPA programs to determine
when action is needed.
   This risk level would correspond to 200 picocuries per liter of
water, which the agency believes would add 0.02 picocuries per
liter to the air in a typical home _ roughly a tenth of the normal
outdoor concentration.
   A picocurie is a standard measure of radiation.
   Last week's call for home tests said homeowners should find the
radon source and try to reduce it if indoor contamination is above
4 picocuries per liter of air. The agency says this concentration
increases the risk of lung cancer by about one in 100.
   Probably half the private wells in the country show some
contamination with radon and about 30,000 public water supplies
contain 200 picocuries per liter with perhaps 5,000 systems above
2,000 picocuries per liter, Cook said.
   ``We believe it accounts for only a few percent'' of all radon
deaths, but ``At a few hundred deaths per year, radon looms as
large a contaminant as anything we're dealing with,'' Cook said.
``Our recently adopted volatile organic compound regulations are
aimed at 30 deaths a year.''
   The agency's current regulations on radioactivity in water do
not cover radon, but EPA expects to ask for public comment soon on
possible options, Cook said.
   The water-source concern arose the same day that two employees
of EPA's waste programs released a letter to Administrator Lee M.
Thomas asking if the agency were not overlooking a source of indoor
radon in building materials.
   The two employees, Hugh Kaufman and William Sanjour, said in
their letter that the agency in 1978 considered classifying some
sources of building materials as hazardous waste but eventually
left them unregulated.
   ``We have never seen any studies'' of whether building materials
contribute to the radon problem, Kaufman and Sanjour said.
   EPA spokesman Chris Rice said the agency had concluded that
building materials could be significant contributors to radon only
in the West, where uranium mill waste might have been used, or
where phosphate slag from Florida had been used.
   ``Kaufman has not been involved with radon for 12 years,'' said
Dave Cohen, the agency's chief press officer. ``Since then, the
agency has found building materials to be negligible. Hugh hasn't
stopped to find out what's been going on.''
   ``We could not accept the conclusion that there is nothing to
regulate,'' Kaufman and Sanjour said, suggesting that radon tests
could be made a condition of government-guaranteed housing loans.

   Nebraska newspapers are holding lotteries to
select who will get a limited number of tickets to next month's
face-off between the vice presidential candidates, an aide to
Nebraska Gov. Kay Orr said Wednesday.
   Doug Parrott, the governor's press aide, said daily newspapers
in 16 Nebraska cities and the Council Bluffs (Iowa) Nonpareil will
each be given tickets based on its circulation and city population.
   The newspapers have been asked to print advertisements with
coupons or include some other notice of ticket availability in
editions this weekend, Parrott said. Newspapers will select winners
of free tickets to the debate on Sept. 30.
   ``We want this to be a statewide celebration,'' Parrott said.
   Democratic vice presidential nominee Lloyd Bentsen and his
Republican counterpart Dan Quayle will debate on Oct. 5 at the
Omaha City Auditorium. It is their only scheduled debate of the
campaign.

   A 19-year-old woman scratched her
attackers, cried out in vain for help and fainted while she was
being gang-raped on the hood of a car, a witness facing charges in
the case testified Wednesday.
   Prosecution witness Jose Carlos Briones, 29, testified for the
second day in the sexual assault trial of Orlando Garza, the first
of 10 men being tried in the case. All have pleaded innocent.
   During the attack the woman was crying, ``Help me, please help
me,'' Briones said in Spanish, testifying with an interpreter in
District Court in Duval County. But there was no response from the
crowd gathered for an illegal cockfight in a shed nearby, he said.
   When the 23-year-old Garza was raping and sodomizing the woman,
``She was moaning and groaning. She had tears in her eyes,''
Briones said.
   ``I was the only one who told them to leave her alone,'' said
Briones, a San Diego resident who admitted fondling the victim and
being impotent that day from drinking a case of beer while
celebrating his birthday.
   Briones and Garza are among 10 men indicted on charges ranging
from kidnapping to aggravated kidnapping to sexual assault after
the woman reported that as many as 23 men abducted and raped her
over a period of several hours the night of March 26-27.
   A doctor who examined the woman several hours after the alleged
attack testified Wednesday the victim was bruised and scratched,
and that her cervix was bruised.
   ``She told me she had been sexually assaulted by as many as 20
to 23 men,'' said Dr. Vilma Garcia.
   Briones said he saw several of the other gang-rape defendants
assaulting the woman.
   One of them, Felipe Chew, sexually assaulted her with a beer
bottle, Briones said, and added, ``Right after it happened, she
just fainted.''
   ``I asked him `Would you like for somebody to do that to you?'''
Briones said. ``He called me an ox.''
   Chew, a 28-year-old Mexican national, faces sexual assault and
aggravated kidnapping charges in the case.
   Garza held the woman's wrists during part of the alleged attack
on the hood of the car in a rural subdivision north of this
southern Texas town of 5,000, Briones said.
   ``He (Garza) told me to hold her because she was scratching
him,'' Briones said.
   The witness said later in the alleged attack, Garza was holding
one of the woman's feet and tried to force Briones to perform oral
sex on her while others helped restrain her.
   When defense attorney Albert Pena asked him if the woman was
making sounds of pleasure, Briones answered, ``It was nothing about
being happy.''
   Under cross examination by Pena, who has questioned Briones'
credibility, the witness said said he is a heroin and cocaine user
with a sixth-grade education. According to a court-ordered
psychiatric report, he suffers from alcoholic blackouts.
   Assistant District Attorney Rodolfo Gutierrez said Tuesday that
he had promised to recommend probation for Briones in exchange for
his testimony against his co-defendants.
   Briones, however, said he did not remember such a deal being
made.
   He said the only help he had received from the prosecutors was
assistance in dialing the telephone to call his court-appointed
attorney, J.M. Alvarez of Rio Grande City. ``I don't know how to
dial a telephone,'' said Briones.
   Garza, a San Diego resident, also faces a kidnapping charge in
the case.
   Sexual assault is punishable by two to 20 years in prison and a
fine of up to $10,000.

   Democrat Michael Dukakis said Wednesday the
Reagan-Bush administration has given ``a cold shoulder'' to
children and families, and he promised that if elected no poor
mother or child will go without essential health care.
   Dukakis commented at Brigham & Women's Hospital in a speech that
was his only public appearance on a day spent mostly in preparation
for Sunday's first presidential debate with Republican rival George
Bush.
   He spent considerable time reading briefing papers on issues
likely to arise at the debate and also has rented a meeting room at
a downtown Boston hotel for practice sessions. A campaign source
said Dukakis was scheduled to take part in a mock debate Friday
with Washington attorney Bob Barnett standing in as Bush, a role he
played in 1984 when Bush debated Democratic vice presidential
candidate Geraldine Ferraro.
   Preparations included a meeting Wednesday with Sen. Bill Bradley
of New Jersey, and meetings were scheduled later in the week with
Govs. Mario Cuomo of New York and Bill Clinton of Arkansas as well.
Bradley and possibly Cuomo were to sit in on the mock debate, said
the source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
   During the hospital tour Dukakis was asked if he wanted to talk
about the debate and he quickly answered, ``No.'' But as he walked
away from reporters he said he was ``slowly getting ready.''
   Dukakis, as has been his practice in recent days, sprinkled
criticism of Bush into his speech, ridiculing the vice president's
stated commitment to the needy by listing what he said were cuts
the Reagan administration has made to Medicaid and numerous other
programs that assist poor families.
   ``When children and their families have needed a helping hand,
Mr. Bush's administration has given them a cold shoulder,'' Dukakis
said at the hospital, where he met with two new mothers and their
babies. ``When the time came to stand up for our children's health
care needs, George Bush was nowhere to be found.
   ``But he was there when his administration conducted an annual
assault on immunization programs,'' the Democratic presidential
nominee said. ``He was there when they cut maternal and child
health programs. He was there when they cut nutrition supplements
for pregnant women and their families. And he was there when they
cut off Medicaid for 700,000 children.''
   Dukakis said his national ``Healthy Start'' program would be
modeled after a Massachusetts program that has served 16,000 women
since 1985 and has been cited as a factor in the reduction in the
state's infant mortality rate.
   ``We know that we can give all of our children, especially those
most at risk, a healthy start on life,'' Dukakis said in his
speech, which was interrupted several times as one of the children
he shared the stage with took a stroll past the Massachusetts
governor.
   The Dukakis program, like the state program, would provide care
for pregnant women and later to their children when uninsured or
underinsured. Dukakis aides said it would cost $100 million in the
first year but that the money would be made up within 12 months
because the prenatal care would help prevent serious illnesses in
the baby's first year.
   Dukakis, whose father was a family doctor, recalled that ``when
I was growing up, he talked the principle that every doctor lives
by: `Above all, do no harm.' I wish somebody had told that to
George Bush.''
   He said that during the Reagan years the number of children
immunized has dropped 20 percent and that the incidence of several
childhood diseases has increased. ``Today, an infant born in this
country has less chance of survival than those born in 18 other
countries, including Spain and Singapore,'' Dukakis said.
   He was introduced by his daughter-in-law, Lisa Dukakis, who is
expecting her first child in January.
   The ``Healthy Start'' program is part of the Democratic ticket's
focus this week on health care. Dukakis on Tuesday detailed his
plan for a universal health care system financed largely by
employers, and his running mate, Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen,
announced a rural health care initiative on Wednesday.
   Dukakis has been increasingly critical of Bush in recent weeks
but did not deliver a line in the prepared text of his speech that
attacked the vice president's upbringing: ``His vision of America
doesn't extend beyond the gates of the country club.''
   He did continue to include in his oratory lines associated with
John F. Kennedy, at one point saying that his vision was of an
America ``with new horizons to reach and new frontiers to conquer.''
   Dukakis also met Wednesday afternoon with Greek Foreign Minister
Karolos Papoulias, who came to Boston after meeting Secretary of
State George Shultz in Washington to discuss negotiations on U.S.
use of Greek military bases.
   The foreign minister sought meetings with both Dukakis and Bush
but a meeting with Bush has not been scheduled, an aide to
Papoulias said.

<TEXT>
   Opposition parties in
South-West Africa rejected on Wednesday a meeting in this country
with U.N. chief Javier Perez de Cuellar, who planned to discuss
independence for the territory.
   Some political parties in the South African-administered
territory, also known as Namibia, said Perez de Cuellar should have
planned to visit the territory during his trip to South Africa.
   The U.N. secretary-general is coming here to discuss
negotiations to bring peace to southern Africa.
   Perez de Cuellar was due to arrive at Waterkloof air force base
near Pretoria on Wednesday night, but his takeoff from Paris was
delayed and the arrival was rescheduled until after midnight
Thursday, the South African Foreign Affairs Department said.
   He is scheduled to be in South Africa on Thursday and Friday,
then head to Angola on Saturday to continue talks aimed at
resolving wars in Angola and South-West Africa.
   Perez de Cuellar offered to consult Thursday in Pretoria with
leaders of the more than 40 political parties in Namibia, which
South Africa rules in violation of U.N. resolutions.
   The Cabinet of Namibia's ``transitional government,''
representing 17 political parties, plans to meet with Perez de
Cuellar. The remaining parties either rejected the offer or gave no
indication they will attend.
   ``If the secretary-general was coming to see Namibians, he
should come here (to Namibia),'' Danny Tjongarero, spokesman for
the the legal political wing of the South-West Africa People's
Organization, said in Windhoek, capital of Namibia.
   SWAPO's outlawed armed wing has been fighting since 1966 to oust
South African rule. The organization is widely favored to win any
independence elections in the territory.
   Other opposition parties complained that they learned of Perez
de Cuellar's invitation only on radio and television broadcasts.
   ``The secretary-general should have the proper respect for the
Namibian people and invitations should be done accordingly,'' said
Othillie Abrahams, leader of the Namibia Independence Party.
   Perez de Cuellar is to meet Friday with President P.W. Botha to
discuss the U.N. plan for Namibian independence.
   South Africa agreed to end its 73-year rule and allow U.N.
observers to oversee the transition to independence, but only if
Cuban troops withdraw from neighboring Angola.
   U.S.-mediated talks among Angola, Cuba and South Africa are
trying to achieve a regional settlement.

   Negotiators for George Bush and Michael
Dukakis were still squabbling over who should ask the questions in
Sunday's first 1988 presidential debate, and a Dukakis spokesman
disputed information from the Bush side that agreement was reached
on how high the candidates' lecterns should be.
   Both candidates spent at least part of Wednesday going over
issues and likely questions with advisers as they counted down the
days to a confrontation that both sides consider crucial.
   Dukakis made a campaign appearance in Boston, but Bush stayed
out of the public eye. Both men have limited public schedules the
rest of the week as debate preparations intensify.
   A disagreement over how high the lecterns should be for the
lanky Republican nominee Bush and the five-inch-shorter Democrat
Dukakis ended in compromise, according to one source in the Bush
campaign.
   Bush, the source said, will speak at a 48-inch lectern, down
slightly from his customary 52 inches. Dukakis, the source said,
will stand behind a 41-inch lectern and will use a small riser.
   But campaign spokesman Leslie Dach disputed the 41-inch figure,
saying he doesn't know how high it will be for Dukakis.
   As for a riser, the Dukakis campaign hasn't addressed that
issue, and ``any other information is just the Bush campaign's
misinformation,'' he said.
   On Tuesday, the campaigns had quibbled over the matter, Dukakis
officials pushing for shorter lecterns for both, Bush staff members
arguing for a minimum of 46 inches and saying their 6-foot-one
candidate would not stand behind anything that made him stoop.
   Under discussion on Wednesday was the makeup of the panel of
journalists that will question the two presidential contenders
during the debate at 8 p.m. EDT at Wake Forest University in
Winston-Salem, N.C.
   Dukakis had proposed that television anchors from ABC, NBC, CBS
and CNN serve as the moderator and three questioners for the first
debate, with a panel of print journalists filling those roles for
either the vice presidential debate on Oct. 5 or the second
presidential debate on Oct. 13 or 14.
   The Bush campaign offered a list of 10 questioners and four
moderaters, from TV and print media, from which to select the
panelists.
   Meanwhile, President Reagan weighed in with encouragement for
his vice president. Asked whether he'd given Bush any hints in
preparation for the debate, he responded with a chuckle, ``Take no
prisoners.''
   When Bush was asked last week whether he would try to emulate
Reagan's ability to project a personable image, he said he might
review some of Reagan's debate tapes ``because I think it is
important to be able to say what you feel in your heart.''
   The Republican candidate was scheduled for only one campaign
event the rest of the week _ a $5 million fund-raiser in Houston on
Thursday with Reagan.
   On Wednesday, Bush engaged in a mock debate with former Deputy
Treasury Secretary Richard Darman playing the role of Dukakis.
Darman is a protege of Bush campaign chairman James A. Baker III.
   To prep Dukakis, the Bush role in practice debates is being
played by Washington lawyer Robert Barnett, a return engagement of
his portrayal of Bush in debate rehearsals with 1984 Democratic
vice presidential candidate Geraldine Ferraro. Dukakis will have a
mock debate with Barnett on Friday, a campaign source said.
   Dukakis had one campaign stop on Wednesday, a health care event
at a hospital. He also put in some time on gubernatorial chores at
the Massachusetts statehouse in addition to reviewing debate
briefing papers.
   He met with advisers including Sen. Bill Bradley, D-N.J., who
has given him foreign policy and defense advice. Bradley and
possibly Gov. Mario Cuomo, with whom Dukakis is meeting this week,
were to sit in on the mock debate.
   Thomas Donilon, a top official of Walter F. Mondale's campaign
four years ago, was coordinating debate preparation for the
Democratic governor.
   Dukakis aides reviewed tapes of the governor's debates earlier
this year during the Democratic presidential primary contests as
well as Bush's performance in the Republican primary debates and
his 1984 debate with Ferraro.
   Both campaigns were trying to lower expectations for their
candidates so Sunday night's performances would seem good by
comparison. The debate comes at a time when most polls show the
race is close, with Bush perhaps slightly ahead.
   ``Dukakis is a good debater,'' Bush told reporters recently on
his campaign plane. ``He is a professional college debater and I'm
not.''
   But Dukakis spokesman Dach countered, ``Remember, Bush has the
experience of these debates, the '84 debate, which is the only
relevant experience.''
   All sides agree that the first debate is critical.
   ``Tens of millions of people are going to watch and they're
going to form their opinions by themselves,'' said Dach. ``In the
primary debates very few people watched and opinions were formed by
the next day's headlines.''
   Bush's national political director Rich Bond said: ``You want to
avoid costly mistakes. And you want to come across as
presidential.''

   Cool weather extended across much of the North and the far West
on Wednesday, while the Gulf Coast states and the southern half of
the Great Plains had hot weather, fairly normal there for the last
full day of summer.
   A warm front over the central Plains helped produce some showers
and thunderstorms over Nebraska and western Iowa. Other showers and
thunderstorms occurred over Florida, the lower Mississippi Valley
and the Southwest.
   Rain moved off the coast of Maine by early afternoon, after
affecting the Northeastern states for a couple days. But some light
rain and drizzle lingered in western New York state.
   Heavier rainfall during the six hours up to 2 p.m. EDT included
three-tenths of an inch at Green River, Utah, and almost two-tenths
of an inch at Griffiss Air Force Base, at Rome, N.Y.
   Cloudy skies and cool temperatures reached from the Great Lakes
region across Minnesota to North Dakota. Temperatures were in the
50s and 60s in the early afternoon, with a few 40s in North Dakota
and Minnesota.
   Temperatures were close to 90 degrees Wednesday afternoon in
Florida, the Gulf Coast states, Texas and across the Plains as far
north as Kansas. Orlando, Fla., tied a record high of 94 degrees.
Manhattan, Kan., had 92 degrees at 2 p.m. CDT.
   The desert Southwest had a break from the heat as mid-afternoon
temperatures were only in the 70s to middle 80s.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 45
degrees at Devils Lake, N.D., and Jackson, Wyo., to 98 degrees at
Harlingen, Texas. The nation's low Wednesday morning was 23 degrees
at Truckee, Calif.
   With fall officially beginning at 3:29 p.m. EDT on Thursday, the
national forecast called for showers and scattered thunderstorms
from the region west and northwest of the Rockies across the
range's central and southern reaches, the southern high Plains,
Nebraska, the middle Mississippi Valley and the lower Ohio Valley
to Wisconsin and Michigan. Scattered showers were expected in
western New York, and scattered afternoon showers and thunderstorms
in central and southern Florida.
   High temperatures were predicted to be in the 70s or 80s across
much of the nation, except for 60s in Washington state and near the
Canadian border from northern Minnesota to northern New England,
and 90s from the southern Great Plains through the lower
Mississippi Valley and Gulf Coast states to the south Atlantic
Coast states.

<HEAD>Jury Decides On Death In Coddington Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PLACERVILLE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A jury Wednesday decided that gambler
and math whiz Herbert Coddington, convicted of the strangulation
murders of two women and sexual assaults on two teen-age girls,
should receive the death penalty.
   The El Dorado County Superior Court jury reached the verdict in
the penalty phase of the lengthy murder trial after 3{ hours of
deliberations over two days. Superior Court Judge Terrence Finney
set sentencing for Nov. 18.
   Coddington, 29, lowered his head and stared at the defense table
as the verdict was read.
   Joette Hotchkiss, one of the jurors, said the panel took five
votes before it agreed on the death penalty.
   ``The whole jury was very disturbed about Herb's lack of
remorse,'' she said. ``The only time he was emotional was when his
mom was on the stand, or when (District Attorney Ron) Tepper said
something he didn't like.''
   Jim Whiting, son of victim Maybelle Martin, 69, burst into tears
and was led from the courtroom.
   ``I don't even understand the emotions that went through me when
I first heard the verdict,'' he said. ``When I tried to have
compassion for her (Coddington's mother), I kept thinking about my
mother.''
   Coddington's lawyers said he believed he received messages from
God through traffic signals when he committed the crimes in May
1987, but the prosecutor said Coddington was a deliberate killer
who kept diaries of his acts.
   ``I think the jury reached the right verdict,'' Tepper said.
   Coddington, who has a fondness for disguises, was convicted Aug.
11 of strangling Reno modeling agency owner Martin and Dorothy
Walsh, 73, at his South Lake Tahoe mobile home.
   He also was convicted of imprisoning two teen-age models in a
specially built chamber in his bedroom and sexually assaulting them
over a two-day period.
   According to testimony, Coddington lured the women and girls to
his home by pretending to be a producer of an anti-drug videotape.
The girls, then aged 12 and 14, were models in Martin's agency.
   But after the females arrived, Coddington strangled Martin and
Walsh and stuffed their bodies into trash bags, and locked the
girls into a soundproof room.

<HEAD>Violence Kills One, Wounds Seven; Firebomb Near Sharon's House</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KARIN LAUB</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israeli troops shot an 18-year-old Palestinian
to death and wounded at least seven other Palestinians in clashes
throughout the occupied lands Wednesday.
   The violence came as Israelis ended a 25-hour fast marking Yom
Kippur, or the Day of Atonement, the most sacred holiday on the
Jewish calendar.
   In Arab east Jerusalem a firebomb was thrown at a riot police
patrol yards away from the house of former Defense Minister Ariel
Sharon. No injuries or damage resulted, police said.
   In the West Bank city of Nablus, Palestinians stabbed a fellow
Palestinian suspected of collaborating with Israeli authorities.
   The army sealed off the West Bank and Gaza Strip during Yom
Kippur, barring Palestinians from entering Israel to lessen the
possibility of terror attacks. Cars with blue West Bank plates were
turned away at army roadblocks on the highway from the biblical
city of Jericho to Jerusalem.
   In the Gaza Strip refugee camp of Bureij, troops fired at
stone-throwers, killing one Palestinian, the army said. Relatives
identified him as Hani Awdah Abu Midan, 18, and said he was shot in
the chest.
   His death raised to 270 the number of Palestinians killed since
their uprising in the occupied territories began last Dec. 8. Six
Israelis have also died.
   Israel took the lands from Jordan and Egypt in the 1967 Middle
East war.
   Arab hospital officials said at least 13 Palestinians were
wounded by army gunfire Wednesday. The army confirmed seven wounded.
   The worst clashes broke out in the Gaza Strip.
   In Nablus, 20-year-old Ziad Abdel Rahim was repeatedly stabbed
in the stomach, said an official at the city's Al Ittihad Hospital.
Rahim's condition was not immediately known.
   The official said the attackers suspected Rahim of collaborating
with Israeli authorities.
   Leaders of the uprising have urged Palestinians in underground
leaflets to ``rid ourselves of collaborators.'' Seven suspected
collaborators have been killed in the insurrection, including five
in the past three weeks.
   Sharon, a political hardliner who engineered Israel's 1982
invasion of Lebanon, was not at home when the firebomb exploded in
the Moslem quarter of Jerusalem's walled Old City, said an aide,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   He said Sharon, now industry and trade minister, spent Yom
Kippur at his sheep farm in the southern Negev Desert.
   Sharon, a leader of the right-wing Likud bloc, caused a
political furor when he bought an apartment in the heart of the
Moslem quarter this year. He said he wanted to assert the right of
Jews to live anywhere in Israel, but liberal Israeli politicians
accused him of unnecessarily fueling tensions in the disputed city.
   Few Jews live in Arab east Jerusalem, which Israel annexed after
the 1967 war.

   U.S.-mediated talks on achieving a withdrawal
of all foreign forces from southwest Africa resume next week in the
Congolese capital of Brazzaville, the State Department said
Wednesday.
   Officials from South Africa, Cuba and Angola will meet with
Assistant Secretary of State Chester Crocker from Sept. 26-28,
State Department spokesman Charles Redman said.
   One of the main issues will be a timetable for the withdrawal of
the estimated 52,000 Cuban troops from Angola.
   The four-way negotiations have been held intermittently since
last May.

<HEAD>Capitol Phones Knocked Out as Workers Call Radio Station</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AUSTIN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After thousands of outgoing phone calls
knocked out the state Capitol phone system, officials disconnected
state employees' attempts to win radio station call-in contests.
   State workers were trying to reach a local radio station
offering a $1,000 prize, and the phone system collapsed under the
pressure, said Carl Stringfellow, the state's director of
telecommunications.
   ``It would shut it down. It essentially left all major agencies
with no phone service,'' Stringfellow said Tuesday.
   ``We thought we had just had an equipment failure,'' he said.
``But the second time it went down one of our employees suggested
it was at the same time as one of the radio contests.''
   Officials discovered the failure occurred within a minute of the
starting time of a local radio station contest.
   The Capitol phone system has about 14,000 lines, and its usual
capacity is about 2,000 calls at any time. But the radio contest
bumped the phone traffic up to 8,000 calls, Stringfellow said.
   Officials reset the system to prevent calls to numbers beginning
with 390, the exchange assigned by Southwestern Bell for radio
call-in contests.
   ``One guy called me raising hell'' about the decision to bar
calls to the contests, Stringfellow said. ``I told him I didn't
realize calling game shows was state business.''
   An official for a state employee organization said there are no
plans to contest the decision to prevent contest calls from state
phones.
   ``It's a shame they have to do that,'' Lane Zivley, executive
director of the Texas Public Employees Association, said about the
worker's efforts to win money.
   ``I think there are even more state employees trying to figure
out how to get food stamps because they haven't gotten a raise.''

<HEAD>Nicaraguan Envoy Says Washington Blocking Visas</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Nicaragua</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The State Department is blocking visas for
most Nicaraguans who want to attend President Daniel Ortega's
speech to the General Assembly, Nicaragua's U.N. ambassador said
Wednesday.
   Ortega family members, including his wife and children, his
doctor, chief of protocol and many of his senior advisers are among
the 22 to 25 Nicaraguans whose visas will not be processed in time
for the Sandinista leader's Sept. 28 address, said the Nicaraguan
U.N. ambassador, Alejandro Serrano Caldera.
   The State Department told the Nicaraguan Mission that Ortega and
some senior Nicaraguan officials will receive their visas in time
for their scheduled arrival Saturday, said Serrano.
   But Serrano said the State Department also told the Nicaraguan
Mission that the other 22 to 25 visas will not be decided until
Oct. 4, a week after Ortega speaks to the 159-member General
Assembly.
   In Washington, a State Department official denied that the
administration is delaying or blocking the visas.
   The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the U.S.
Embassy in Managua is working as fast as it can on the visa
requests, but has been slowed by personnel shortages.
   The official noted that Nicaragua expelled eight U.S. diplomats
from Managua in July and has refused to allow the State Department
to replace them.
   The leftist Sandinista government accused the U.S. diplomats of
interfering in Nicaragua's internal affairs. The State Department
retaliated by expelling eight Nicaraguan diplomats from Washington.
   Serrano said Ortega will deliver his speech, but said the delay
in visa approval is a violation of the United States' treaty with
the United Nations under the Headquarters Agreement.
   That agreement requires the host nation to allow U.N. missions
and diplomats to maintain offices and conduct normal business.
   Nicaraguan envoys took up the matter with the U.N.'s legal staff
and hope to receive word from them Thursday, said Serrano.
   Serrano, speaking Spanish and assisted by a translator, said the
State Department told Nicaraguan officials that Foreign Minister
Miguel D'Escoto, Deputy Foreign Minister Victor Hugo Tinoco and
their security staffs will receive visas by Saturday.
   They have not yet received visas, he said. The Nicaraguan
delegation for this year's General Assembly is about the same size
as in previous years, he added.
   Serrano said that if the United States has a dispute with
Nicaragua, it should be dealt with between the two nations. ``We
cannot see how any other considerations can apply,'' he said.
   The United States since 1981 has supported the rebels seeking to
overthrow the Nicaraguan government.

<HEAD>Creditors Join Push To Sell Off PTL Ministry</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT MILL, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A second creditor has filed court papers
asking that PTL, the television ministry founded by Jim Bakker, be
closed and auctioned off piece by piece.
   The accounting firm of Arthur Andersen and Co. wants the U.S.
Bankruptcy Court to convert the PTL case to a Chapter 7 from
Chapter 11, a court-supervised reorganization.
   Under Chapter 7, the Christian theme park and retreat at Fort
Mill would be closed and its assets auctioned.
   The television ministry has been in bankruptcy reorganization
since June 1987, three months after Bakker left amid a
sex-and-money scandal.
   A federal grand jury in Charlotte, N.C., has been looking into
PTL, and Jay Babcock, PTL's former director of creative television,
said Tuesday he told the panel he had sex with Bakker.
   Babcock said he gave the information to the grand jury after
being asked questions apparently designed to determine whether
ministry money, much of which comes from tax-deductible donations,
was paid for sexual favors.
   Babcock is the first man to publicly acknowledge telling the
grand jury of a sexual encounter with Bakker. In August, Bakker
denied under oath that he had ever had a homosexual relationship.
   When he was told that, Babcock responded, ``I'm saying he's a
liar.''
   Bakker did not return phone calls to his office in Fort Mill,
S.C., on Wednesday.
   Two other grand jury witnesses, former PTL general manager Gary
Smith and former ministry board member the Rev. Charles Cookman,
also acknowledged that the subject of homosexuality had come up
during their testimony this week.
   ``It was a very small, almost insignificant issue because the
Assemblies of God has already spoken on that,'' said Cookman,
referring to the Pentecostal denomination he serves as North
Carolina superintendent. ``There is not a lot of question about
where we stand on those matters.''
   Bakker was dismissed by the Assemblies of God in May 1987 for
unbecoming conduct related to his sexual encounter with Jessica
Hahn in 1980 and because of ``alleged misconduct involving bisexual
activity.''
   After his testimony, Babcock was asked by a reporter, ``What did
you say regarding sex with Jim Bakker?''
   His response: ``I commented that `Yes, it happened _ a long time
ago.''' He would not elaborate.
   In the matter involving creditors, Andersen officials cited the
bankruptcy trustee's mid-August report that PTL's operating costs
have exceeded revenues by $1.2 million since April 15.
   ``The continuing loss and diminution of the estate is occurring
and there is no reasonable likelihood of rehabilitation of the
debtor,'' company officials said in court papers.
   The first request to put PTL on the auction block came Sept. 7
from Fairfax Savings of Baltimore. PTL owes Fairfax $12.2 million.
   The court-appointed trustee, M.C. ``Red'' Benton, has said PTL
would get a better deal if it could stay open while trying to sell
its assets.
   Benton has had various negotiations since May with prospective
buyers, including Bakker. Bakker's $172 million offer fell apart
Sept. 10 when he failed to come up with a down payment.
   After Benton said Bakker was out of the running, Canadian real
estate executive Peter Thomas reinstated his bid, which he had
backed earlier with a $1 million deposit.
   ``We are actively pursuing reaching an agreement this week,''
said Bob Ransford, spokesman for Thomas, whose company has offered
$113 million for PTL.
   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Rufus Reynolds has told Benton to
recommend a buyer by Tuesday. Benton said he has offers from two
other unidentified groups.
   Among PTL's assets are the 504-room Heritage Grand Hotel, a
three-acre water park, and a studio and satellite network.

   A bomb exploded in a concrete
trash bin at the main white bus terminal in Johannesburg at rush
hour Wednesday, injuring 19 people, almost all of them white
commuters, police said.
   A white police constable was among the injured. More than 100
bombs have exploded in the country since a national emergency was
declared June 12, 1986.
   Black activist Winnie Mandela visited three escaped detainees
who sought refuge in the U.S. Consulate nine days ago. She
criticized American restrictions barring the detainees from giving
interviews.
   A fourth person entered the consulate Wednesday, apparently
after escaping from detention, a State Department official in
Washington said. The official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
identified the man as Clifford Ngcobo and said he was given
temporary refuge in the consulate.
   The duty officer at the consulate early Thursday refered all
questions to the U.S. Information Office in Pretoria, but telephone
calls there went unanswered.
   No additional information on the man was available.
   The government detained 11 activists in Cape Town, where 75
anti-apartheid organizations are planning a weekend gathering to
discuss opposition to government actions. Lawyers and relatives
said the activists were taken from their homes by police under
emergency laws which do not require them to confirm the detentions
or give a reason for the actions.
   In the port city of Durban, police said 160 people were arrested
after hundreds of striking black dockworkers, some carrying sticks
and pipes, held an illegal gathering.
   Police said they were released after their names and addresses
were taken down. The strike began Tuesday in protest against the
dismissal of a worker and to demand higher pay.
   Mrs. Mandela, wife of jailed African National Congress leader
Nelson Mandela, visited the three black escapees at the U.S.
Consulate, on the 11th floor of a Johannesburg office building. She
said they were in a boardroom, crowded with furniture, and that
their food was provided by the black community.
   She said U.S. officials, under orders from Washington, were
refusing to let the three communicate directly with the news media,
a condition which they initially agreed to but now want to change.
   ``To highlight the position of detainees and their own
conditions it is necessary for them to communicate with you,'' she
told a press conference in an empty ground-floor office of the
building.
   ``We would like to see the Americans a little more committed
than they are,'' she said.
   A U.S. Embassy spokesman, Barry Walkley, said in response that
the U.S. government was concerned with ``maintaining the
appropriate posture of a diplomatic mission,'' as well as the
well-being of the activists, who escaped Sept. 13 from a
Johannesburg hospital where they were undergoing physiotherapy.
   ``We agreed that they can convey messages through their legal
representatives,'' he said,
   Encamped at the U.S. Consulate are two leaders of the banned
United Democratic Front _ Murphy Morobe and Mohammed Valli Moosa _
and the chairman of the banned National Education Crisis Committee,
Vusi Khanyile.
   Mrs. Mandela said the three are wary of government promises that
they will not be rearrested if they leave the consulate.

<DATELINE>SHREVEPORT, La. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The site where a street riot by hundreds
of black people ended early Wednesday, is a poor, violent and
dangerous neighborhood known locally as ``The Grove.''
   State Sen. Greg Tarver, who is black and a former Shreveport
city councilman, called the area officially known as Cedar Grove
``a time bomb waiting to explode.'' He blamed high unemployment
among black teen-agers and a feeling that police are not providing
equal protection to blacks.
   The riot broke out after a white woman fatally shot a black man
Tuesday night near Palmer Park, an area described by police as a
curb-service market for crack, the smokable form of cocaine.
   Police familiar with Cedar Grove said drug-related stabbings,
shootings and arson have grown common in that area of this
northwestern Louisiana city of 250,000.
   ``You can come through here any time, get robbed, get cut, get
shot,'' said Richard Kenner, a policeman who has patrolled the
midnight-to-dawn shift in the area for more than seven years.
``There'll be 100 people standing around and nobody saw anything.''
   A decade ago, the area was a working class mix of whites and
blacks, but white flight to the suburbs left the neighborhood more
than 90 percent black, with practically all the whites living in a
middle class area on the fringe.
   Work on Interstate 49 has carved up the area, and the vacant
buildings along the route make the area look like a war zone.
   Drugs also have carved up the community, with the elderly and
families feeling intimidated by dealers working out of business
fronts and parking lots, police say.
   ``The drugs are there,'' said Officer Cedric Wilson, who also
patrols Cedar Grove on the night shift. ``And it's only going to
get worse before it gets better.''
   Racial tensions are high, fueled by a slaying by a white
teen-ager of a black teen-ager on Aug. 4 at a restaurant that
borders Cedar Grove.
   Police say many of the younger Grovites, as that area's
residents have become known, have become belligerent to officers
responding to crime reports.
   As in the Tuesday night and Wednesday morning rioting, officers
have been pelted with rocks when they are called to the area.

<TEXT>
   A bomb exploded near City Hall
Wednesday night, damaging nearby property but apparently injuring
no one, police said.
   It was the fourth bombing in four weeks in the rejuventated
commercial and business center of Belfast.
   The Irish Republican Army, which is fighting to end British rule
in Northern Ireland, claimed responsibility.
   IRA bombings in the 1970s caused widespread damage in the center
of Belfast, turning it after nightfall into a darkened, deserted
area shunned by crowds. Bars and restaurants were shuttered and
public transport non-existent in the area.
   Following a major redevelopment program, city authorities on
Aug. 25 organized ``Belfast's Big Night Out'' to mark the return of
late-night shopping and other amenities to the city center. About
80,000 people took part in the festivities.
   News reports say the latest bombing campaign, which started Aug.
24, the night before ``Big Night Out'' festivities, is thought to
be a revival of the guerrillas' ``commercial war'' of the 1970s.

   Presidential rivals George Bush and Michael Dukakis plunged into
preparations Wednesday for their first debate, poring over fat
briefing books and getting tips from media and political advisers.
Dukakis took out time to propose a ``Healthy Start'' program
guaranteeing basic medical care for poor women and children.
   ``When children and their families have needed a helping hand,
Mr. Bush's administration has given them a cold shoulder,'' Dukakis
said during a visit to Brigham & Women's Hospital in Boston, where
he met with two new mothers and their babies.
   ``When the time came to stand up for our children's health care
needs, George Bush was nowhere to be found,'' the Democratic
nominee said.
   Bush also was the target of criticism from an unexpected source:
retired Sen. Barry Goldwater, the outspoken conservative and 1964
GOP presidential nominee.
   Goldwater introduced Bush's running mate, Sen. Dan Quayle, at a
Rotary Club luncheon in Phoenix, and then before relinquishing the
microphone said: ``I forgot something that I had to say, and I hope
you take this kindly. But I want you to go back and tell George
Bush to start talking about the issues, OK?''
   Quayle merely laughed and said, ``I wish Barry would just say
what's on his mind.''
   Republican Bush, with his schedule cleared of public
appearances, spent the day in Washington meeting at the vice
presidential mansion with advisers in preparation for the
nationally televised debate Sunday night. The 1{-hour encounter at
Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, N.C., will begin at 8 p.m.
EDT.
   Bush's schedule included a mock debate, with former Deputy
Treasury Secretary Richard G. Darman playing the role of Dukakis,
according to Bush campaign sources.
   Bush also met with Polish Solidarity figure Janusz Onyszkiewicz
on Wednesday and reaffirmed his support for the legalization of the
trade union movement in Poland.
   Bush also had a labor endorsement to gloat over Wednesday. The
leadership of the Boston Police Patrolman's Association voted 51-0
to endorse Bush over Dukakis, and Bush planned to travel to
Dukakis' backyard on Thursday to accept the endorsement.
   A report out of London, however, threatened to dampen that
celebration. A British television documentary said Bush complained
to Panamanian leader Manuel Antonio Noriega five years ago about
the laundering of drug money in Panama.
   Bush has said the Reagan administration took action as soon as
it learned of narcotics and other federal charges against Noriega
in indictments issued in Florida last February.
   Bush spokesman Steve Hart said Bush met in 1983 with Noriega and
other officials but did not speak of any allegations against
Noriega.
   With the real debate just four days away, the two campaigns were
closer to settling their argument over the height of the lecterns
where the two candidates will stand.
   The 6-foot-1 Bush will stand at a 48-inch high lectern, down
slightly from his customary 52 inches. Dukakis, at 5-foot-8, will
stand behind a 41-inch lectern and use a small riser, a Bush source
said.
   But Dukakis spokesman Leslie Dach said there was no agreement on
what size lectern Dukakis will use and the issue of a riser has not
been addressed.
   Before resolving the matter, Dukakis officials had pushed for
shorter lecterns for both while Bush staff members argued for a
minimum of 46 inches, saying their lanky candidate would not stand
behind anything that made him stoop.
   Still to be decided is the makeup of the panel of journalists
who will question the candidates.
   At the White House, President Reagan offered encouragement for
his vice president. Asked whether he'd given Bush any debate hints,
Reagan responded with a chuckle, ``Take no prisoners.''
   Reagan also gave Bush support in his criticism of Dukakis for
vetoing a 1977 bill in Massachusetts that would have required
public school teachers to lead students in reciting the Pledge of
Allegiance. ``That's what they're there for,'' Reagan said,
referring to the teachers.
   In Boston, Dukakis spent most of the day getting ready for the
debate. Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey, who has helped advise on
foreign policy issues, attended morning briefings with Dukakis and
planned to return on Friday for another session.
   Govs. Mario Cuomo of New York and Bill Clinton of Arkansas also
planned to meet with Dukakis this week to help him prepare.
Campaign sources said Dukakis would have a mock debate Friday with
Washington lawyer Bob Barnett, who played Bush when he debated
Democratic vice presidential nominee Geraldine Ferraro in 1984.
   ``Slowly getting ready,'' Dukakis told reporters.
   Dukakis said his national ``Healthy Start'' program would be
modeled after a Massachusetts program that has served 16,000 women
since 1985 and has been cited as a factor in reducing the state's
infant mortality rate.
   The national program, like the state plan, would provide
prenatal and post-partum care, including vaccinations, to pregnant
women and children who are either uninsured or underinsured.
Dukakis aides said it would cost $100 million in the first year but
that the money would be saved within 12 months because the prenatal
care would help prevent serious illnesses in the baby's first year.
   Meanwhile, Dukakis' running mate, Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, announced
a program to improve rural health care, saying, ``Millions of
Americans in rural areas are being denied one of the basic
necessities of life: They are losing their access to quality health
care.''
   Speaking in Hale Center, Texas, Bentsen said a Dukakis
administration would propose a ``hardship fund'' to subsidize rural
hospitals that are threatened with closure and expansion of a
national program providing incentives for doctors and nurses to
work in rural areas.
   Bush's running mate, Quayle, campaigned in Arizona and
California.
   ``You are a bunch of winners,'' Quayle told students at Frye
Elementary School.

   The leadership of Boston's police union endorsed
George Bush for president in a unanimous vote Wednesday, saying the
vice president would do a better job than Massachusetts Gov.
Michael S. Dukakis of seeing after the needs of law enforcement.
   Dukakis, the Democratic presidential nominee, said he wasn't
surprised and said he still had the support of most law enforcement
organizations both in Massachusetts and across the country.
   The 51-0 endorsement by the Boston Police Patrolman's
Association, the largest law enforcement in New England, led to a
change of plans for the Bush campaign. Campaign spokeswoman Alixe
Glen said Bush would travel to Boston on Thursday to accept the
endorsement.
   The union represents 1,500 members.
   The trip to Boston is the second this month for Bush and affords
the vice president a chance to embarrass Dukakis politically. Bush
toured Boston Harbor early this month and claimed Dukakis did
little to clean up the heavy pollution in the harbor.
   Union President Robert Guiney said union leaders were pressured
from the highest levels of state government to thwart the vote.
``We had a few calls,'' Guiney said.
   ``Maybe people took us for granted,'' he said. ``The police
officers in this state are upset with the governor and his
policies.''
   One officer emerging from the vote at the union's hall in the
Dorchester section of Boston said, ``We're sick and tired of all
these drug addicts and all these furloughs for murderers out in the
state and we felt we had to send a message.'' The officer declined
to give his name.
   Gov. Dukakis said the association ``has a history of supporting
Republicans.'' He also pointed to previous endorsements he has
received from law enforcement organizations including the
Massachusetts Police Association, the International Brotherhood of
Police Officers, the International Union of Police Associations and
the Combined Law Enforcement Associations of Texas, which is Bush's
home state.
   ``I'm very proud of the fact that the entire law enforcement
community has endorsed me,'' Dukakis said.
   Dukakis has come under frequent attack from Bush for the state's
former policy of releasing convicted first-degree murders on
weekend furloughs. One notorious case involved convicted murderer
Willie Horton, who escaped in 1985 and was arrested the following
spring for raping a Maryland woman and stabbing her fiance.
   Dukakis has fired back that the Reagan-Bush administration has
granted prison releases to serious criminals from federal prisons.
Dukakis also reversed his stand on the furlough policy, coming out
in favor of a policy that continues some furloughs but bans them
for convicted first-degree murderers.

   Vice President George Bush met with a Polish
Solidarity figure Wednesday and reaffirmed his support for the
legalization of the trade union movement in the Eastern European
nation.
   ``Relations between the United States and Poland need to be put
on a realistic and constructive footing,'' he said in a statement
after meeting with Janusz Onyszkiewicz, the public spokesman for
Solidarity.
   ``I hope that the current discussions between the leadership of
Solidarity and the Polish government will prove fruitful in
establishing a national dialogue, pluralism and the right of
association,'' Bush's statement said.
   It said the vice president looks forward to the legalization of
Solidarity _ ``the legalization of true freedom of individual and
political association in Poland.''
   ``I applaud the continuing attempts by Polish workers and
citizens to achieve greater freedom,'' the statement said.

   Democrat Michael Dukakis and Republican George
Bush are in a virtual dead heat in predominantly Democratic
Maryland, according to a poll released Wednesday by WBAL-TV.
   Dukakis had 47.6 percent and Bush had 47.4 percent, with 5
percent undecided in the latest Maryland poll.
   Since the poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 points,
the results indicate the race in Maryland would be a toss-up.
   The survey of 638 state residents considered likely to vote in
November was conducted Sept. 8-11 by Western Maryland College
political science professor Herbert C. Smith for WBAL.

   Rep. Mike Lowry, making his second run for the
Senate, won a spirited Democratic primary for the right to face
Republican Slade Gorton, who is making a comeback bid after losing
his seat two years ago.
   And the man they both seek to replace, retiring GOP Sen. Dan
Evans, predicted Wednesday the lessons from Gorton's upset in 1986
by Democrat Brock Adams would enable Gorton to win this time out.
   ``We're in great shape. We feel very good. Our position
contrasts with Mike Lowry on almost every issue,'' Gorton said.
   Lowry disputed those who characterize him as a liberal, saying,
``What I am is a middle-of-the-road candidate with my positions
.... That's how we got the votes, our common-sense approach to what
this country should be doing.''
   In other primary results Tuesday, state Rep. Bob Williams, an
evangelical conservative, upset King County prosecutor Norm Maleng
in the GOP governor's race and in November will face Democratic
Gov. Booth Gardner, who easily won his primary.
   Gardner said the results showed ``just how comfortable the
people are with the direction we have taken as governor.''
   With 99 percent of precincts reporting, Gardner had 502,855
votes, or 90 percent of the Democratic votes. On the Republican
side, Williams had 173,253 votes; Maleng had 127,579.
   U.S. Rep. Don Bonker of Vancouver lost the Democratic Senate
nomination to Lowry, his old friend and ally, after a vote tally
that was neck and neck for much of the evening. He pledged to
support Lowry in the general election campaign.
   Evans held the Senate seat since Henry ``Scoop'' Jackson's death
in 1983 but elected not to seek a second term. Evans beat Lowry,
49, for the seat in 1983.
   With 99 percent of the state's 6,655 precincts reporting, Lowry
had 55 percent of the Democratic vote, or 275,840 votes, to
Bonker's 45 percent, or 225,376 votes.
   Gorton, 60, a former state attorney general who swept into the
Senate on the Reagan landslide of 1980, demolished his lesser-known
challengers, former state Supreme Court Justice William Goodloe of
Seattle and Doug Smith, an Everett attorney and former White House
aide.
   Gorton took 86 percent of the GOP vote, or 322,270 votes. Smith,
who had called Gorton too liberal, was a distant second with 8
percent, or 29,662 votes, and Goodloe had 6 percent, or 24,436
votes.
   In Spokane on Wednesday, Lowry stressed his Eastern Washington
roots and said his experience living on both sides of the Cascades
would give him an understanding of statewide issues.
   Lowry denied his votes were out of step with the rest of the
state's delegation, saying that he voted with the delegation about
96 percent of the time.

   An unemployed British plumber arrived in
western Ireland on Wednesday after rowing 2,300 miles across the
Atlantic Ocean alone in a 20-foot boat he built.
   Sean Crowley, 25, set off from Halifax, Nova Scotia, on June 17,
and landed 96 days later at Clifden, County Galway.
   ``I capsized nine times in all, and five times in one day,''
said Crowley of Croydon, 10 miles south of London. ``There were
times when I felt I would not make it. But the boat was good and
strong and saw me through.''
   Crowley said he realized he was nearing land Tuesday night when
he saw a lighthouse flashing at Slyne, on Ireland's west coast.
   ``I just stared in disbelief and in relief,'' he said. ``I could
not believe I had done it. The lights looked so beautiful. It was
great to feel I was nearing land after three months ... great when
I landed to see people, cows, land.''
   Crowley said some fishermen came to meet him Wednesday ``and
when they heard I had crossed the Atlantic they brought me ... a
few pints of beer.''
   Crowley named his boat Finn Again after another rowboat _
Finnigan's Wake _ in which he and a friend rowed across the
Atlantic in 1986 from the Canary Islands, off the coast of
northeast Africa, to South America.

   Opposition supporters beat drums and
danced in the streets after opposition leader Benazir Bhutto gave
birth to a 7-pound boy on Wednesday.
   ``Benazir is very lucky to have a boy as her first child,'' said
Amina Bibi, a peasant woman among 500 people dancing and munching
sweets outside the hospital.
   ``I'm jubilant,'' exclaimed her husband, businessman Asif Ali
Zardari. The baby is the couple's first child.
   ``Mother and child are safe and healthy,'' Dr. N. Sethan
announced.
   People also gathered to celebrate in the city's working-class
Lyari district, a stronghold of Ms. Bhutto's left-leaning Pakistan
People's Party.
   Ms. Bhutto, 35, who still uses her maiden name professionally,
was admitted at midnight Tuesday to Lady Dufferin Charity Hospital,
where Sethan performed a Caesarean section Wednesday morning. The
doctor said Ms. Bhutto would stay at the hospital for three days
before resting at home for a week.
   The opposition leader studied at Radcliffe College in Cambridge,
Mass., before studying at Oxford. After returning to Pakistan, she
chose to wed Zardari in December in a traditional Islamic arranged
marriage.
   Ms. Bhutto is awaiting a Supreme Court ruling on elections
scheduled for Nov. 16. Before he died in a plane crash Aug. 17,
President Mohammed Zia ul-Haq said candidates must run as
individuals, rather than affiliated with parties.
   Ms. Bhutto, who feels that would favor governing party
candidates, challenged the decree and the caretaker government
asked the court to decide.
   If elections are held on a party basis, Ms. Bhutto's Pakistan
People's Party is expected to do well against Zia loyalists, who
are split into two factions of the center-right Pakistan Muslim
League.
   Zia deposed Ms. Bhutto's father, Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali
Bhutto, in a 1977 military coup. Bhutto was hanged two years later
on conviction of complicity in the murder of a political foe.
   Pakistani press reports had said Ms. Bhutto's baby was due in
December, but family members later said it was due in late
September. The press reports sparked speculation that Zia set the
elections in November so pregnancy would hamper Ms. Bhutto's
campaign effort.
   Zia denied on Aug. 13, four days before his death, that Ms.
Bhutto's pregnancy affected his decision to call for November
elections, saying ``I'm not as dirty and as low as somebody may
think I am.''
   In an interview in late August, Ms. Bhutto declined to discuss
her pregnancy but said Zia set the elections for November ``as an
inconvenience to my health.''
   Ms. Bhutto is expected to mount a vigorous election campaign.
Her mother, Begum Nusrat Bhutto, returned Saturday from six years
of self-imposed exile in France to be present for the birth and to
help run the campaign.
   ``We are pleased to announce that God has blessed our family
with the first grandson of martyr Zulfikar Ali Bhutto to be born in
the country,'' the party leader's mother said in a statement.
   Begum Bhutto's other three children each have daughters. Those
children are Sanam, a housewife in London; Murtaza, a son who is in
Syria after a 1981 airplane hijacking in which he freed some of
Zia's political prisoners; and Shahnawaz, a son who committed
suicide in France in 1985.

   Sen. Dan Quayle went out of his way Wednesday to
bring retired Sen. Barry Goldwater to his campaign appearance, and
wound up getting a dig from the outspoken conservative about the
way George Bush is running.
   Goldwater introduced the Republican vice presidential nominee to
a Rotary Club luncheon, saying the Indiana senator had done ``the
most fabulous job'' on a Senate Armed Services subcommittee.
Goldwater called Quayle to come out from the wings, then returned
to the microphone to say:
   ``I forgot something that I had to say, and I hope you take this
kindly. But I want you to go back and tell George Bush to start
talking about the issues, OK?''
   Goldwater did not elaborate, and afterward he avoided reporters,
saying: ``I'm not talking. I want to get the hell out of here.''
   But the dig appeared aimed at Bush's capture-the-flag
campaigning, including his pillorying Democrat Michael Dukakis for
vetoing a mandatory Pledge of Allegiance school bill in 1977.
   Quayle laughed and said only, ``I wish Barry would just say
what's on his mind.''
   The Indiana senator, returning to the town where he spent part
of his youth, then launched into his standard stump speech,
portraying Dukakis as a liberal who supports gun control, is weak
on defense and belongs to the American Civil Liberties Union.
   He questioned whether Dukakis might not use ACLU membership as a
litmus test for his judicial appointees.
   Earlier, Quayle visited an award-winning school in Chandler,
Ariz., where he offered children a brief civic lesson on free
speech after demonstrators yelled ``chicken hawk'' at him.
   He detoured on his way to the Rotary luncheon to pick up
Goldwater at his hillside home.
   ``Is one of his requirements going to be that you have to be a
member of the ACLU?'' Quayle asked the 400 Rotarians. ``We know
what kind of judges George Bush is going to appoint. He's going to
appoint people like (William) Rehnquist and (Sandra Day) O'Connor
that are strict constructionists.''
   Later, at a rally at California State University-Fresno, Quayle
blasted Dukakis, saying he signed a proclamation on Feb. 27, 1985,
supporting a union boycott of grapes.
   Quayle, speaking in the heartland of California's raisin
industry, said, ``Dukakis has done all he can to put
(grape-growers) out of business.'' Bush made a similar assertion
while campaigning in California's Central Valley last week.
   The Dukakis campaign had no immediate information on whether he
signed such a proclamation. Dukakis says such a boycott wouldn't be
necessary under his administration, because it would adopt
stringent policies to regulate pesticides. The United Farm Workers
Union has been objecting to the exposure of workers to pesticides.
   Quayle also criticized Dukakis for opposing the death penalty
under any circumstances and again asserted that Dukakis would make
dangerous judicial appointments. Quayle said that if elected,
Dukakis would appoint judges like California's former Supreme Court
chief justice Rose Bird, who was recalled by voters in part because
of her opposition to the death penalty.
   Quayle was also making a stop in Bakersfield before teaming up
with his wife, Marilyn, for a party fund-raiser Wednesday night in
Los Angeles.
   At Frye Elementary School in Chandler, he got an enthusiastic
welcome from 600 flag-waving children and 200 adults _ and jeers
from a dozen pro-Dukakis demonstrators, some clad in chicken
costumes.
   ``Don't pay any attention to them. You know, in this country of
ours, we have a thing called freedom of speech. ... '' he said.
``They have the freedom of speech, but you know what, kids? So do
we.''
   Frye, a kindergarten-to-grade six school where two-thirds of the
670 youngsters are Hispanic or other minorities, was among several
hundred elementary schools named earlier this years as winners of a
coveted ``Excellence in Education'' award from the U.S. Department
of Education.
   Quayle kept his remarks mostly non-partisan, although he said he
was presenting the award ``on behalf of the U.S. Department of
Education, on behalf of Secretary Bill Bennett and on behalf of
George Bush.'' Bush swore in Lauro Cavazos as Bennett's successor
Tuesday.
   Police escorted Jim Driscoll, a local Vietnam veteran and leader
of the protest, away from the outdoor ceremony when he began
shouting.
   Quayle spent eight years of his youth in the Phoenix area, where
his father worked on one of the family's newspapers.
   His grandfather, Gene Pulliam, owned the Arizona Republic as
well as newspapers in Indiana.
   Goldwater, who said Quayle had done ``the most fabulous job'' on
a Senate Armed Services acquisitions subcommittee, quipped, ``We
all knew Gene Pulliam _ you either knew him or you better get out
of town.''

   Hyatt International Corp. is temporarily closing
its two hotels in Cancun because of devastation wreaked by
Hurricane Gilbert on Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula, the company said
Wednesday.
   The Hyatt Regency Cancun and Hyatt Cancun Caribe will close
immediately, the company hotel said in a statement.
   Rainer Mohaupt, Hyatt's regional vice president for Latin
America, said Hyatt would implement comprehensive rebuilding plans
as soon as possible.
   Mohaupt said all guests registered at either hotel and in
residence during the hurricane would be invited back to Cancun and
provided with complimentary rooms to finish their interrupted
vacations.
   The invitations would be good from April 15, 1989, through Dec.
15, 1989.
   Mohaupt also said guests holding future reservations with Hyatt
at either of the Cancun hotels would be given assistance for
rescheduling their vacations to Acapulco at a 25 percent discount
from Cancun prices.
   He said arrangements also could be made for alternative
accomodations at other Hyatt resort destinations, including Key
West, Grand Cayman, Puerto Rico or Hawaii.

   Democratic vice presidential candidate
Lloyd Bentsen unveiled on Wednesday his ticket's plan for upgrading
rural health care, which he said has been hurt by a weak farm
economy made worse by an uncaring Republican administration.
   Bentsen announced the plan in the small West Texas town of Hale
Center, were he toured a hospital and spoke at a high school
auditorium.
   ``The sad fact is, my friends, that rural America has been left
in the lurch'' by the Republican administration, he said. ``Not
once in those eight years have we seen a positive program to help
rural America.''
   The Democratic proposal, as described by Bentsen, would
subsidize those providing health care in rural communities to keep
their services available in areas which might otherwise be unable
to attract them.
   ``Millions of Americans in rural areas are being denied one of
the basic necessities of life: they are losing their access to
quality health care,'' he said.
   ``It means that some children die who could have been saved. It
means illness lingers that could have been cured,'' he told the
audience of about 700, which included many young school children.
``It means despair and recession for rural communities all across
America.''
   Bentsen said the Democratic plan included:
   _A ``hardship fund'' to subsidize rural hospitals that are
``essential to their communities'' and threatened with closure.
   _Expansion of the National Health Service Corps, a program where
medical, dental and nursing students get scholarships if they agree
to serve in rural areas.
   _Increased federal subsidies for nursing education. Rural areas
have been especially hurt by the current shortage of nurses, the
campaign said.
   _Restoration of federal funding for migrant and community health
centers.
   The hospital fund would be a new effort and take the buggest
chunk of the $100 million earmarked for the program, according to
campaign aides who said they did not know how much each of the four
programs would cost or how the programs would be financed. Bentsen
made no mention of either in his speech.
   Bentsen announced the rural segment of the Democtats' health
policy a day after Michael Dukakis, the Democrats' presidential
nominee, announced his major proposal for a national health
insurance program.
   Dukakis on Wednesday announced his program for care of pregnant
women, and Bentsen flew from Texas to California to underscore that
message.
   Bentsen and his wife, B.A., scrubbed and put on hospital garb to
visit an intensive care ward for newborn babies at Sutter Memorial
Hospital in Sacramento, and afterward Bentsen met with hospital
employees and guests.
   Republicans George Bush and Dan Quayle have consistently
supported efforts to cut health care, he said.
   ``It's easy to vote against something and call yourself a
conservative, but America pays a very heavy price for neglecting
health care for children,'' he said. ``For all of the bounty of
America, it's shameful that millions of our children must face
illness without proper care or proper medicine.
   ``A quarter of our children have not received their measles
vaccines. Dan Quay
   ``You're the big banana, the big enchilada, 47 electoral votes,
terribly important to winning this race,'' he said. ``With your
help we'll put it all together and on Nov. 8 we'll have California
in the Democratic column and Michael Dukakis in the White House.''
   Bentsen began his day Wednesday in Lubbock, Texas, where his
hotel was across the street from the memorial for Buddy Holly, the
rock-and-roll musician from there who was killed in a 1959 airplane
crash.
   The Texas senator strolled over to the Holly statue so
television cameras could film him. Asked if he had been a fan,
Bentsen responded ``Oh,sure.''
   The skeptical press corps then asked what his favorite song was,
and Bentsen had a ready answer.
   ``B.A.'s my Peggy Sue,'' he said, referring to his wife, Beryl
Ann, and one of Holly's biggest hits.

   The Lebanese army said Wednesday it will
take over the country by Friday if Parliament fails to elect a new
president.
   ``The army is the only force capable of change and of leading
Lebanon to salvation,'' the army's commander, Gen. Michel Aoun,
said.
   President Amin Gemayel's six-year term expires on Friday, and
Parliament is scheduled to meet Thursday to elect his successor.
The Constitution prevents Gemayel from running again.
   But lawmakers are deeply divided over several candidates, and
the last time they scheduled a vote, not enough lawmakers showed up
to form a quorum.
   The impasse has threatened to reignite Lebanon's civil war,
which has claimed 130,000 lives since 1975.
   The army is considered stronger than the various warring
Christian and Moslem militias and is believed capable of
controlling them if it had the political mandate to do so.
   In Washington, White House spokesman Roman Popadiuk said
President Reagan sent a telegram to Cardinal John O'Connor of New
York saying the U.S. government ``attaches great importance to a
peaceful and constitutional presidential election in Lebanon on
Sept 22.''
   ``We remain strongly committed to helping restore Lebanese
unity, sovreignty and territorial integrity,'' Reagan said in the
telegram, sent in response to one by O'Connor urging Reagan support
Lebanon ``at this extremely critical moment.''
   Twenty-seven Christian parliamentarians said Wednesday they will
boycott Thursday's election unless the session is shifted from
Moslem west Beirut to the no-man's land at the city's dividing
Green Line.
   ``We shall not go to the Moslem side. There will be no session
tomorrow unless the venue is changed,'' said deputy Emile Rouhana
Saqr.
   The boycott again would prevent the 51-member quorum that the
76-seat Parliament needs to hold the election.
   Lebanon's main Christian militia, the right-wing Lebanese
Forces, are backing veteran politician Raymond Edde for president.
   Edde, a Maronite Catholic, is an outspoken critic of foreign
intervention in Lebanon. He says he will seek to force Israel from
its self-designated ``security zone'' in south Lebanon within 20
days if he is elected.
   Edde has been living in self-imposed exile in Paris since
fleeing Lebanon after three assassination attempts in 1976.
   Two other Maronite Catholic candidates, former President
Suleiman Franjieh and Parliament deputy Mikhail Daher, have Syria's
backing. Syria, a supporter of Lebanon's Moslem and leftist
factions, has 40,000 troops in eastern and northern provinces of
the country as well as Beirut's Moslem sector.
   The Christians charge that Franjieh, president from 1970 to 1976
and a close friend of President Hafez Assad of Syria, will make
Lebanon a Syrian satellite.
   Christian deputies boycotted the Aug. 18 presidential vote in
Parliament to prevent a quorum when Franjieh was the only serious
candidate.
   Lebanese sources said Franjieh was likely to withdraw his
candidacy in favor of Daher, who was selected this week as a
compromise candidate by U.S. envoy Richard Murphy and Syrian
leaders.
   The Christians have wielded political power since independence
from France in 1943, when they were considered to be the majority.
Moslems now comprise an estimated 55 percent of Lebanon's 4 million
population.
   According to an unwritten national covenant dating to Lebanon's
independence from France in 1943, the president should be a
Maronite, the house speaker a Shiite Moslem and the prime minister
a Sunni Moslem.
   If Parliament fails to elect a president Thursday, Gemayel was
expected to form a caretaker Cabinet, which could formalize the de
facto partition of Lebanon into sectarian areas.
   Syria's Moslem and leftist allies charge that Gemayel would name
a Maronite prime minister and have threatened to respond by
declaring their own republic in territory they control.
   Gemayel met in Damascus with Assad and Lebanese Christian
leaders. Afterward, presidential spokesman Jibrane Kourieh said,
``An agreement for saving Lebanon has been reached between the two
presidents.'' He gave no further details except to say the Lebanese
election will be held.

<HEAD>Armed Services Numbers Grow in August Despite Goal to Reduce
Personnel</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The number of men and women in uniform
increased in August but still remained well below year-ago levels,
the Pentagon said Wednesday.
   As of Aug. 31, the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marine Corps had
2,122,874 men and women on active duty, up 11,742 compared to the
2,111,132 reported July 31 but down 43,940 compared to the Aug. 31,
1987, total.
   The U.S. military is in the midst of general personnel cutbacks
prompted by budget reductions, however, during August, two of the
four services reported increases in personnel.
   The Army reported 763,777 on active duty as of Aug. 31, up 5,750
compared to July. The Navy reported an increase of 7,334 men and
women in August, with 584,114 on active duty at the end of the
month.
   The Air Force, meantime, reported 577,902 men and women on
active duty at the end of August, down 1,076 compared to July. And
the Marine Corps reported 197,081 on active duty, down 266 compared
to July.
   Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci has ordered a cut of almost
36,000 positions from the active-strength totals reported at the
end of fiscal 1987. The cuts are to be completed and the services
stabilized at the new levels by the start of fiscal 1989 on Oct. 1.
   The defense secretary has told Congress he would rather maintain
a smaller force that is properly equipped and ready to fight than a
larger, but ``hollow,'' force.

<DATELINE>BRIGHAM CITY, Utah (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An old-model nozzle inlet ring was
used in the final test of Morton Thiokol's redesigned space shuttle
booster rocket, but NASA doesn't believe the discovery will delay
next week's scheduled shuttle launch, a spokesman said Wednesday.
   NASA spokesman Ed Medal said it had not yet been determined if
the outdated ring was used in the two boosters attached to the
space shuttle Discovery, scheduled for launch Sept. 29, but
preliminary investigation showed it had not.
   ``There's no indication that the old configuration is in the
boosters (in Discovery). But we've got to go ahead and check the
records and clear that,'' Medal said.
   ``We certainly don't believe the situation will impact the
launch, though,'' Medal said at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center
in Huntsville, Ala., which oversees the booster rocket contract.
   Asked how the ring with the old design might have been installed
on the test rocket, he said, ``We're taking a long, hard look at
how the old ring got there. One of the leading possibilities is a
cross labeling of parts.''
   Medal said it is necessary to check records because actually
searching through Discovery for the ring would be too difficult.
   ``We are going through the records and checking to clear the
boosters for flight. If one of the old inlet rings was there, there
would be no safety issue for flight. The old design worked
perfectly well on all space shuttle flights. The modification was a
very minor one,'' Medal said.
   The ring, located inside the nozzle assembly at the tail of the
shuttle booster, was redesigned for production models of the solid
rocket motors.
   But for some reason the nozzle installed in the Aug. 18 test
booster contained a ring of the old, pre-Challenger design, Medal
said.
   ``It is true that a nozzle forward nose ring, not of the
redesigned solid rocket motor design, the RSRM design, was
inadvertently installed in the PV-1 (Production Verification Motor,
fired Aug. 18),'' said Ed Snow, a Morton Thiokol spokesman at
Ogden, reading a prepared company statement.
   ``The forward nose ring performed satisfactorily. The error was
discovered during regular post-test examination and analysis of the
part. NASA and Morton Thiokol are working to discover how the error
was made and how it can be prevented in the future,'' the statement
said.
   Medal said he believed the mistake was discovered within the
last day or two.
   Barbara Selby, a spokeswoman at NASA headquarters in Washington,
said space agency officials now are concentrating on trying to
determine if the old ring, or the redesigned ring was installed in
the rockets on the launch pad.
   She said no decision would be made about the effects on the
launch until this was known, but added: ``When I left, they didn't
think it would cause a postponement.''
   A firm decision on that may come on Thursday, she said.
   ``We fully believe the correct parts are in the flight set,''
company spokesman Rocky Raab told the Associated Press. ``We and
NASA are researching the record, the documents, to make sure they
are the correct parts. Even if they were not, they would not affect
the safety of the flight.''
   Raab said the discovery was made during X-ray analysis of the
part after the test firing. ``There is no visible difference
between the two parts,'' he said.
   Raab said the search would include X-rays of the nozzle rings on
the Discovery booster and engineers should have an answer within
days.
   ``We expect to be able to tell that by two days before launch,
and perhaps sooner, but certainly by then,'' he said.
   The Aug. 18 test, the fifth full-scale static firing of the
redesigned booster, was conducted at Thiokol's Wasatch Operations
plant 25 miles west of Brigham City under NASA and Thiokol
supervision.
   After the test, engineers disassembled the rocket and began a
lengthy process of examining it. NASA later pronounced the test a
success and certified Discovery for launch.
   Most of the booster redesign was aimed at making the rocket
safer. A faulty O-ring seal on one of the booster segments was
blamed for the Jan. 28, 1986, explosion of the space shuttle
Challenger, which grounded the nation's manned space program.
   Medal said that uder the old design, the flame from the rocket
hit the ablative carbon cloth fabric on the ring at an angle of 90
degrees. Under the new design, it hits at an angle of 45 degrees.
   ``That's slightly improves the ablative tolerance of the ring,''
he said.
   An ablative substance melts off in layers when hit by the rocket
flame, protecting the ring and preventing it from burning through.
   He said these parts are not marked for technical reasons. ``The
old design ring certainly did not affect that test in August,'' he
said.

<HEAD>Ranchers' Challenge to Killing Ban Rejected</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB EGELKO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ranchers have no constitutional right to
kill grizzly bears to protect their sheep, a federal appeals court
ruled Wednesday.
   The grizzly bear is a threatened species, and the government is
entitled to prohibit its killing except in self-defense, said the
9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in a case from Montana.
   The 3-0 decision upheld a $2,500 civil penalty against rancher
Richard Christy for killing a grizzly that was menacing his sheep
on land near Glacier National Park in 1982. Christy gave up his
lease on the land later that month, having lost 84 of his 1,700
sheep to bears in two months.
   Joined by two other ranchers, he challenged the law forbidding
the killing of grizzly bears, saying it violated his property
rights. The ranchers also claimed discrimination because licensed
sport hunters are allowed to kill up to 25 grizzlies in Montana.
   U.S. District Judge Paul Hatfield's ruling upholding the law was
affirmed by the appeals court, which said there was no fundamental
constitutional right ``to kill federally protected wildlife in
defense of property.''
   ``We do not minimize the seriousness of the problem faced by
livestock owners ... nor do we suggest that defense of property is
an unimportant value,'' said the opinion by Judge Arthur Alarcon.
   ``We simply hold that the right to kill federally protected
wildlife in defense of property is not `implicit in the concept of
ordered liberty' nor so `deeply rooted in this nation's history and
tradition' that it can be recognized by us as a fundamental
right,'' Alarcon said, quoting Supreme Court standards for
fundamental rights.
   He also said the government did not violate ranchers' rights by
authorizing a closely regulated hunt of grizzlies as a population
control measure in certain areas.
   The judge said the law does not prevent ranchers from taking
other steps to frighten bears away, and authorizes federal wildlife
officers to kill troublesome bears at private citizens' request
when other measures have failed.

<HEAD>Turkey Says 1,000 Kurds Volunteer To Return To Iraq</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ANKARA, Turkey (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 1,000 Kurdish refugees will return
voluntarily to Iraq, the Foreign Ministry announced Wednesday.
   Ministry spokesman Inal Batu said the Kurds will begin returning
Thursday under the supervision of a delegation from the
International Red Cross.
   About 60,000 Kurds fled to Turkey last month, and some claimed
Iraq dropped chemical bombs on their settlements.
   Iraq, acting at the urging of Turkey, has proclaimed an amnesty
for the Kurds. Only two Kurds have returned to Iraq so far.
   Shortly after the Kurdish refugees began arriving in Turkey,
Iran said it would accept all the Kurdish refugees who wanted to go
to that country.
   Batu said the transfer of 2,000 Kurds who chose to go to Iran
was made possible by Turkish authorities last week. He said about
6,000 Kurds went to Iran via Turkey earlier.
   Premier Turgut Ozal on Friday called on Western countries to
accept half of the refugees in Turkey or to extend financial aid to
ease Turkey's burden.
   Batu said only the Netherlands has made an offer to accept 60
Kurds.
   The United States has accused Iraq of using chemical weapons
against its Kurds, who are fighting for autonomy.
   The U.S. State Department has said the accusation was based on
evidence gathered from Kurdish refugees in Turkey and the
interception of Iraqi air force communications.
   Turkey has maintained no traces of poison gas was found on the
refugees in medical screenings. But Turkish officials have said
that this does not prove Iraq did not use chemical weapons in its
campaign against the Kurds in northern Iraq.
   Iraq has denied charges of poison gas use against Kurds but has
acknowledged using poison gas against Iran in the 8-year Persian
Gulf war.
   In London, British Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe said
Wednesday compelling evidence exists that Iraqi forces used
chemical weapons against Kurds in north Iraq.
   Howe said that if true, it was nothing less than barbaric.
   He spoke to reporters after meeting in London with Iraq's
minister of state for foreign affairs, Saddoun Hammadi.
   A Foreign Office spokesman, who in accordance with British
practice refused to be identified, said Howe and Foreign Office
minister of state William Waldegrave indulged in ``plain speaking''
at the meeting with Hammadi _ a catch phrase usually taken to mean
strongly worded criticism.
   The spokesman said Howe urged the Iraqis to allow a United
Nations team to investigate the allegations.
   The spokesman said Hammadi repeated Iraqi denials that it used
chemical weapons against the Kurds and said Iraq opposed a U.N.
team as ``an unprecedented intervention'' into Iraq's affairs.
   He said Hammadi was told Britain was consulting its U.N.
colleagues over what further action could be taken.

<HEAD>Children's Hospital Revises AIDS Policy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A foundation that rescinded mandatory
AIDS tests at a children's hospital after they stirred controversy
has decided to leave testing to the discretion of doctors, an
administrator said Wednesday.
   Under a new policy issued by the Jacksonville, Fla.-based
Nemours Foundation, patients at the Alfred I. du Pont Institute
will be tested for the AIDS virus only at the discretion of their
physician and employees will be tested only if they request it.
Testing will be confidential.
   ``As far as the foundation is concerned, I'm glad we've been
able to explain our position a little bit better with this new
policy as opposed to the former one,'' said W. Jeff Wadsworth,
foundation general manager.
   In addition to the Wilmington-based du Pont Institute, the new
policy will affect the Nemours Health Clinic for the elderly in
Wilmington and the Nemours Children's Clinic in Jacksonville, Fla.
   The foundation drew national attention this summer by requiring
AIDS tests before a patient could be admitted to the du Pont
Institute. It would have denied admission to any patient who tested
positive for the human immunodeficiency virus which causes acquired
immune deficiency syndrome.
   The foundation also had called for mandatory annual AIDS tests
for employees and would have required those testing positive to
transfer to non-patient work areas.
   The mandatory testing policy was rescinded in July after
virulent protests from state officials and the medical community.
   The American Hospital Association recommends against screening
patients for AIDS. Institutions that accept federal money are
precluded from such action, according to the association.
   The Nemours Foundation facilities don't accept federal money. It
administers its facilities according to the will of Alfred I. du
Pont, a member of the family that built the giant chemical company.
He died in the 1930s and specified that his fortune be used to help
the elderly and crippled children but not incurables.
   In the past year, one patient at the institute was found to have
been exposed to the AIDS virus and was transferred to another
hospital, the institution said.
   A positive test for the AIDS virus does not mean the person has
the disease.
   Under the new policy, Wadsworth said a physician would have to
comply with a recent Delaware law requiring patients to be notified
before administering an AIDS test.
   The physician also will ``determine the best course of
treatment'' if a patient tests positive for the HIV virus, he added.

<DATELINE>YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK, Wyo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Skies began to clear over
Yellowstone National Park on Wednesday, but fire managers there and
in California and Oregon said the worst was over for firefighters.
   ``I think we have enough precipitation on the ground to keep
these things down and still hold the upper hand,'' said Yellowstone
fire information officer Bob Valen.
   ``The worst is over,'' said area commander Ken Dittmer.
   Steady rain on Tuesday prevented any significant growth in the
blazes that cover more than 1 million acres of the park.
   In northern California, a backfire and favorable weather helped
hundreds of firefighters divert a 5-day-old blaze away from
expensive homes. But officials, citing the extremely dry conditions
that have allowed more than 40,000 acres to burn recently, banned
outdoor smoking in portions of 44 counties.
   The fire west and north of Vacaville, Calif., continued to burn
over a 32-mile area Wednesday, after 500 evacuated residents were
allowed back into their homes Tuesday.
   Firefighters completed a 10-mile-long fire break Tuesday just
west of Vacaville, about 45 miles east of San Francisco, and set
fire to brush west of the break. The only part of the blaze
uncontained by fire lines was in rugged terrain in an unpopulated
area.
   Fire officials predicted they will have the Vacaville fire out
by Saturday evening, one week after the start of the blaze, which
has destroyed seven homes and blackened 27,000 acres.
   Elsewhere across the West, the situation was improved as the
worst summer for fires in three decades wound to a close. Nearly
70,000 fires have blackened more than 4.1 million acres, about half
of them in Alaska.
   Fire crews in Oregon mopped up hot spots on the stubborn Shady
Beach wildfire Wednesday in the Willamette National Forest as fire
bosses prepared to declare the nearly 9,000-acre blaze contained by
fire lines.
   With the fire 85 percent contained at 8,987 acres, about 300
firefighters have been dismissed, putting the total personnel at
2,116, Forest Service spokeswoman Lorette Laferriere said.
   The fire was expected to be declared contained Wednesday night
and controlled on Sept. 30, she added. Fires are considered
controlled when they can not jump fire lines.
   As nights lengthen over Yellowstone, the period of ``humidity
recovery,'' when small fuels such as pine needles and twigs soak up
moisture, also becomes longer, said Dittmer.
   Fires continue to creep along some 1.2 million of the park's 2.2
million acres, but analysts do not expect more of the blazes that
in earlier weeks forced firefighters to retreat from advancing
100-foot walls of flame.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Soldiers who toppled the regime of
Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy mutinied against more commanders Wednesday
and civilians rallied to join the uprising. Witnesses said a
12-year-old boy was killed when troops fired on a crowd.
   Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril, made president Sunday after a coup led
by Namphy's Presidential Guard, tried to quell the military
uprising Tuesday by naming a new armed forces chief and retiring
nine unpopular commanding officers.
   ``The situation is precarious. After all, we are in the midst of
a general mutiny,'' a Western diplomat said Wednesday.
   Coup leaders who put Avril in power demanded that he institute
democratic reforms, including free elections that Haiti has not had
in 31 years. But even though Avril appealed for calm, the purge
that put him in power continued to spread to military barracks and
the streets.
   Radio Haiti Inter said army units opposed to Avril attacked a
crowd in this capital city at 4:30 p.m. Wednesday and that a
12-year-old boy, identified as Nilo Chailes, was killed and three
people were wounded.
   Witnesses said the crowd was on its way to pillage the home of a
sergeant known for his brutality when soldiers fired.
   The station said mutineers battled other soldiers, with one
soldier killed in a clash Tuesday in Jacmel, about 45 miles south
of Port-au-Prince.
   Mutineers on Wednesday were rounding up agents of Namphy's
Bureau of Criminal Investigatons and leaving them at army
headquarters in Port-au-Prince. before cheering crowds, Radio Haiti
Inter reported.
   Radio stations said ousted military commanders were also being
dropped off _some in handcuffs _ at the headquarters, but their
fate was unclear.
   Radio Soleil, the Roman Catholic radio station, reported
Wednesday that Sergo Joseph, arrested Aug. 5 for writing an
anti-government slogan on a wall, was freed by a judge Tuesday
night.
   He was severely beaten after his arrest and the human rights
group Amnesty International campaigned for his release.
   In Cap Haitien, a crowd plundered the residence of Louis Noisin,
a former Senate president, Radio Haiti Inter reported.
   On Tuesday, civilians supporting the mutineers engaged in mob
killings and workers at government companies struck to unseat
state-appointed managers, actions apparently aimed at wiping out
remnants of Namphy's rule.
   ``The demands of the mutineers have been accepted; it has become
a people's army, at least for the moment,'' the diplomat said,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Organizers canceled a demonstration at St. Jean Bosco Roman
Catholic Church planned for Wednesday to support the soldiers'
rebellion and rescheduled it for Thursday. The organizers, members
of a leftist coalition, said they would meet instead with Avril and
Sgt. Joseph Heubreux, leader of Saturday's coup.
   ``I came to Port-au-Prince from the country to participate in
the demonstration,'' said Andre-Juste Pierre, 32, an unemployed
welder from Cabaret, 20 miles north of the capital. ``I don't feel
frustrated because the military government is afraid. We'll
demonstrate tomorrow.''
   About 100 people gathered in front of the burned-out ruins of
the church, staring at the charred, mutilated body of a thug killed
by a mob Tuesday.
   Witnesses identified him as an ex-officer of the Tonton
Macoutes, the dreaded private army of the Duvalier dictatorship.
They said the man took part in the Sept. 11 massacre of 13
parishioners at the church that provoked Saturday's coup.
   The government's dismissal of eight generals and a colonel
followed the ouster by soldiers of at least 11 commanders
nationwide since Monday.
   In St. Marc, about 60 miles north of the capital, residents took
to the streets Wednesday to punish thugs allegedly allied with the
local army commander. Soldiers fired rifles into the air to
disperse them, Radio Metropole reported.
   Among officers retired Tuesday was former Defense Minister Brig.
Gen. Williams Regala, despised in Haiti for his ties to the
dictatorship of Francois ``Papa Doc'' Duvalier and his son,
Jean-Claude. Namphy headed a three-man junta that ruled Haiti after
the younger Duvalier was forced into exile on Feb. 7, 1986.
   Central Bank employees went on strike Wednesday demanding the
board of directors resign, Radio Metropole said.
   Employees of at least the state flour mill and electric company
joined the military mutiny and ousted their bosses Tuesday.
Unpopular managers of other government companies also were
expelled, radio stations said, but details were sketchy.
   Radio stations estimated that up to 12 Tonton Macoutes had been
killed by mobs and soldiers since Sunday.

<HEAD>Britain's Thatcher Stirs Storm With Anti-EEC Remarks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LUXEMBOURG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain
said Wednesday that a Europe without borders would be a
``nightmare'' and lashed out at efforts to centralize the
continent's economy.
   She made her second stinging attack since Tuesday on the notion
of a United States of Europe, a key ideal of the 12-member European
Economic Community.
   Mrs. Thatcher, on a three-nation swing of Europe, told a
luncheon group in Echternach, Luxembourg:
   ``In the great changes which are taking place, we must ensure
that we do not allow Europe to become entangled in a new network of
rules and regulations which stifle initiative and enterprise.''
   Britain's leader warned against more centralized economic
control when the Common Market drops trade barriers among member
nations. These are due to fall in 1992 with the creation of a
single European market.
   She said a better alternative to centralized economic authority
is ``active cooperation'' between governments.
   ``I will only say that those countries like the Soviet Union
which have tried to run everything from the center are now learning
that success depends upon dispersing power and decisions away from
the center,'' she said.
   ``It would be absurd for us in Europe to move in the opposite
direction. A centralized European government would be a nightmare.''
   The remarks echoed statements she made Tuesday in Bruges,
Belgium, the first stop on her tour. She flew to Madrid, Spain,
after her visit to Luxembourg.
   The prime minister's strong comments set off a stir back home.
   Opposition leaders expressed fears that Mrs. Thatcher damaged
Britain's role in the Common Market with Tuesday's speech, in which
she also rejected moves to centralize power or to ``suppress
nationhood.''
   ``The prime minister must learn to hold her tongue and not treat
Europeans to her own inimitable brand of foghorn diplomacy,'' said
George Foulkes, foreign affairs spokesman for the Labor Party.
   The centrist Social and Liberal Democratic Party said Mrs.
Thatcher demonstrated ``xenophobia in velvet gloves.''
   ``She brings to the issues of European cooperation all the
finesse of a soccer hooligan on the rampage,'' said party leader
Paddy Ashdown.
   At its headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, the EEC Commission,
the group's executive body, withheld public comment.
   A spokesman for EEC Commission President Jacques Delors said:
``Mr. Delors believes that that which unites us is more important
than that which divides us.''
   Belgian Foreign Minister Leo Tindemans, however, called Mrs.
Thatcher's Tuesday comments ``disappointing.''
   Premier Andreas Papandreou of Greece, president of the European
Community, the EEC's umbrella organization, told the British
Broadcasting Corp. that he was worried Mrs. Thatcher's remarks in
Bruges run counter to the treaties the trade bloc already has
passed.
   ``I consider it extremely important at this stage that Mrs.
Thatcher informs the community of the exact meaning of her vision
of Europe,'' Papandreou said.
   He said it was difficult for him to believe Mrs Thatcher would
be prepared to question the European Single Act, which binds member
states to open trade under an international treaty already ratified
by their parliaments.

   Three polygamist clan members already
convicted of federal firearms, attempted murder and bombing charges
were arraigned Tuesday on state murder charges in the death of a
corrections officer.
   Earlier, another man linked with the group was arrested for
investigation of attempted arson at a Mormon church that the clan
members had bombed earlier this year.
   Circuit Judge Maurice Jones set a tentative preliminary hearing
date of Sept. 27 for clan leader Addam Swapp, his younger brother,
Jonathan Swapp, and John Timothy Singer.
   The three are charged in the death of Department of Corrections
Lt. Fred House, who was killed during a shootout that ended the
clan's 13-day standoff at their farm on Jan. 28.
   The three men and clan matriarch Vickie Singer were sentenced
earlier this month for their convictions on federal firearms,
attempted murder and bombing charges. Assistant Attorney General
Creighton Horton has said that barring new evidence, the state
would not charge Mrs. Singer in House's death.
   Attorneys for Addam Swapp and Singer agreed to move the
preliminary hearing to circuit court in Salt Lake City, where the
trio and Mrs. Singer are jailed. The attorney for Jonathan Swapp
said he would discuss the proposed move with his client.
   Late Monday night, Summit County sheriff's deputies responding
to an alarm at the Mormon Church's Kamas Stake Center arrested a
man on suspicion of attempted arson, County Attorney Robert Adkins
said. Adkins and Sheriff Fred Eley declined to name the man, but a
source close to the investigation identified him as Kevin
Gunderson, 34.
   Gunderson's father, Joseph Gunderson, said his son had been
staying at the clan's farm, one mile away from the church, for
almost three weeks in an effort to overcome an alcohol problem.
Heidi Swapp declined to answer reporters' questions at the farm.
   Addam Swapp has said the January bombing of the church center
was ordered by God as a sign of the impending collapse of the
Mormon Church and all government. He also said the act would
trigger the return of family patriarch John Singer, slain by police
nine years before for resisting arrest.
   The clan maintained Singer was killed in a church-state
conspiracy and that the family had been harassed for years by
police and neighbors.

<HEAD>Harry Helmsley Seeking Out of Tax Case for Medical Reasons</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Real estate billionaire Harry Helmsley, charged
in a massive tax evasion case with his wife, Leona, and two former
aides, is trying to get himself removed from the case for medical
reasons, defense lawyers said Tuesday.
   Lawyers would not disclose the nature of the 79-year-old
Helmsley's health proble, but U.S. District Judge John Walker
agreed to unseal transcripts of previous closed door hearings on
the issue.
   The Associated Press and several other news organizations had
petitioned Walker to disclose the sealed papers, and at the start
of the hearing, the judge said he would ``permit the unsealing of
all records except grand jury materials.''
   Walker said the material to be unsealed ``the next day''
concerned ``the physical condition of Mr. Helmsley and whether he
is fit to stand trial.''
   Helmsley and his 67-year-old wife were indicted in April on
state and federal charges that they allegedly disguised about $4
million in renovations to their Greenwich, Conn., mansion as
business expenses and took bogus tax deductions.
   The Helmsleys have pleaded innocent to the 188-count state
indictment and the 47-count federal indictment. State prosecutors
have agreed to let the federal case go first.
   They are slated to go on trial next Monday, but Assistant U.S.
Attorney James DeVita said he wanted a three-week delay so
government experts could evaluate Helmsley's health records to see
if ``more medical examinations are warranted.''
   In another development, defense lawyers for the Helmsleys sought
to have the other two defendants, Joseph V. Licari and Frank J.
Turco, severed from the case because the Helmsleys plan a
conflicting defense.
   They plan to claim the pair created false invoices ``as a cover
to permit Turco and Licari to steal from the Helmsleys,'' said
defense lawyer Gerald A. Feffer, and not ``to perpetrate tax
evasion'' by the Helmsleys as charged by the government.
   Neither of the Helmsleys was present at the hearing.
   The judge also delayed considering a defense request to move the
trial to Philadelphia because of prejudicial publicity in news
reports. Walker said last week it was too soon to decide on moving
the trial, but said he would consider again if selecting impartial
jurors in New York proves difficult.

   A study by National Cancer Institute
scientists shows that mammogram examinations every one to two years
can reduce breast cancer deaths by 24 percent among women aged 40
to 49.
   The conclusion came from a detailed analysis of data from a
clinical trial begun 18 years ago by the Health Insurance Plan of
Greater New York.
   Researchers said it is the first comprehensive study to prove
that mammograms can be an important lifesaving screening technique
for women under the age of 50.
   ``This is the first statistically significant evidence of the
benefits'' for this age group, said Kenneth Chu, lead author of the
NCI analysis.
   Evidence has been clear for some time, he said, that there is a
significant benefit in mammographic screening among women aged 50
and above. But whether these benefits apply to women between the
ages 40 and 50 has been a matter of controversy, Chu said.

   The Reagan administration has used the CIA to
foment civil unrest in Nicaragua and in the process has damaged
efforts at a long-term peace accord between the leftist government
and the Contra rebels, House Speaker Jim Wright says.
   In a highly unusual disclosure, Wright told reporters Tuesday
that the CIA has employed agents covertly in Nicaragua to organize
and promote anti-government rallies and protests.
   Wright, speaking at his regular daily news conference, said
Congress has received ``clear testimony'' that the CIA has sought
``to provoke an overreaction'' by the Managua government.
   Elaborating later in an interview, the speaker added: ``Agents
of our government have assisted in organizing the kinds of
anti-government demonstrations that have been calculated to
stimulate and provoke arrests.''
   Wright said the CIA had made the admission under questioning
from members of Congress. Presumably, the disclosure would have
come in closed-door oversight sessions of the congressional
intelligence committees, most of whose work is classified.

   An 8-year-old boy with AIDS-related

admittance to school, dreads another struggle because ``the ugly
people are going to be back,'' his mother says.
   ``Our big problem right now is that we just want to be a normal

don't want to be in the spotlight. I don't want to be a civil
rights activist.
   ``All I want to be is a housewife,'' Mrs. Robertson said. ``All
my kids want is a mother.''
   Jason's family left the St. Louis suburb of Granite City, about
15 miles south of here, last month, saying they'd been harassed for
their efforts to enroll him in regular classes there.
   Last week, as many as two dozen parents began picketing South
Roxana Elementary School in this town of 2,000 to protest Jason's
application for admission, which officials are considering.

   The decision to close a federal probe into
the fatal 1985 MOVE confrontation without indictments ends the
criminal investigation, but bitterness and civil suits linger in
the case.
   The U.S. Justice Department announced Tuesday that a grand jury
cleared Mayor W. Wilson Goode, other city officials and police of
criminal wrongdoing in the bombing of a west Philadelphia rowhouse.
   The police bombing _ approved by Goode _ and resulting fire that
officials allowed to rage out of control left 11 members of the
radical group MOVE dead and 61 homes destroyed.
   ``There's always going to be some nagging doubts about whether
justice prevailed in this case,'' said William H. Brown III, the
chairman of the mayor's special investigative commission, which
found Goode ``grossly negligent'' for his role in the events of May
13, 1985.
   Assistant Attorney General William Bradford Reynolds, head of
the Justice Department's civil rights division, said in Washington
that evidence was insufficient to seek indictments on any civil
rights violations.

   Higher food, shelter and gasoline prices
maintained an annual inflation pace of 5.2 percent in August as the
effects of the drought on consumers began to ease, the government
said Wednesday.
   Food and beverage prices rose 0.5 percent for the month,
compared with 0.9 percent in July when the Labor Department said
the greatest impact of the dry weather in the Farm Belt began
reaching consumer pocketbooks.
   But gasoline prices jumped a whopping 3 percent in August, the
biggest increase in 12 months. Analysts noted that the normal
summer vacation season price spikes for gasoline are usually over
by August, but that there were shortages of unleaded grades in many
markets this year.

   Taking fish oil capsules dramatically improves the
long-term outcome of angioplasty, one of the nation's most common
major medical procedures, by keeping the heart's newly reopened
arteries flowing freely, according to a study.
   Fish oil, the researchers said, is the first treatment to keep
the heart arteries from becoming clogged again. This problem, known
as restenosis, is a major drawback of angioplasty and occurs in
about one-third of cases during the first six months after the
procedure.
   An estimated 200,000 Americans will undergo angioplasty this
year. Doctors guide tiny balloons into the heart arteries. When
inflated, they squeeze open blood vessels that are plugged with
fatty buildups. The procedure often is performed as an alternative
to coronary bypass surgery.

   Trevor Pinnock's debut as an operatic conductor
at the Metropolitan Opera has already raised eyebrows but, the
British early music specialist says, ``You've got to start
somewhere. Why not here?''
   Pinnock will conduct Handel's ``Giulio Cesare,'' which premieres
Tuesday with Kathleen Battle as Cleopatra and Tatiana Troyanos as
Caesar. Jeffrey Gall, in the role of Ptolemy, is the first
countertenor (male alto) to appear at the Met.
   The more significant first for the Met is having an early music
specialist in the pit. Pinnock, who founded and directs the English
Concert, is one of Britain's best-known workers in the original
instruments field, along with Christopher Hogwood and John Eliot
Gardner.
   However, the announcement that Pinnock would conduct ``Giulio
Cesare'' provoked some critical grousing last season. Donal
Henahan, chief music critic of The New York Times, ended a
laudatory review of one of Pinnock's performances with this warning
shot: ``Followers of the Metropolitan Opera must wonder what
qualifies Mr. Pinnock to conduct next season's `Julius Caesar.'''
   ``The trouble is, people are always ready to pigeonhole
everybody,'' Pinnock said before rehearsal recently.
   ``I've done `Giulio Cesare'; I've done it with students on stage
in London. But the fact is, I've never conducted in an opera house
before,'' he said.
   ``I do know the music through and through, I love the music of
Handel, and I love working with singers... In a certain way, all
music is sung. I hate music that doesn't breathe.''
   Pinnock, 41, has been performing professionally since 1966, and
he formed the English Concert in 1973.
   The Met has only been doing Handel since 1983, when ``Rinaldo''
entered the repertory, followed by an operatic version of the
oratorio ``Samson'' in 1985.
   This production of ``Giulio Cesare'' was done by John Copley for
the English National Opera in 1978 with Charles Mackerras
conducting.
   Pinnock is not working with original instruments at the Met, but
with a small orchestra _ 18 violins, six cellos, three basses and
harpsichord _ of modern instruments.
   The early music influence will come in the style of playing,
especially the ornamentation in both the instrumental and vocal
parts.
   ``Of course, it has been paramount in my musical considerations
_ the combination of what Handel wants and how to fill the hall,''
Pinnock said.
   ``It's interesting how much that's affected ornamentation. I
have quite strong ideas about the type of ornamentation that is
suitable for a large space, as opposed to a small room. I think the
ornamentation in general needs more space. It can't be tight and
fast ornamentation.''
   It also has to suit the voice.
   ``I've found that I've had to write quite different
ornamentation, in some cases, for cover singers,'' Pinnock said.
``Because, obviously, one is trying to solve two things in
ornamentation: first, and foremost for me, one's trying to enhance
the meaning of the words and the whole sense of the aria. If the
ornamentation doesn't do that, it's completely wasted notes.
Secondly, it is to show off the voice, and it must be to show off
the beautiful qualities of whoever is singing it.''
   ``Giulio Cesare'' premiered in London in 1724, and was revised
and revived in 1725, 1730 and 1732. Following its last German
performances in 1733, it disappeared from the repertory until the
1920s.
   Restoring the reputation of Handel's more than three dozen
operas has become a cause for his partisans. Winton Dean and John
Merrill Knapp, in a monumental scholarly survey of Handel's operas
published last year, contended that ``Handel ranks with Monteverdi,
Mozart and Verdi among the supreme masters of opera.''
   Pinnock said Handel's operas have unfairly gained a reputation
for being static. That has something to do with the limitations of
the ``opera seria'' form of recitatives mixed with ``da capo''
arias _ solos which have two movements, repeating the first.
   Pinnock sees ``Giulio Cesare'' as a series of pictures, in which
the audience is invited to take part.
   ``The `da capo' aria, musically, enhances the meaning of the
words,'' he said. ``So what we've begun to understand in the
beginning _ we've entered the picture _ then we're fully in
accordance with what's being sung and can relish the atmosphere
before moving on to the next picture.
   ``Now, of course, it is possible in a certain production to make
it so static that we as the audience are not invited in. But I
believe that the good production of a Handel opera will at the same
time honor that concept of the picture and not destroy it by
ridiculous movement.''
   Among Pinnock's future projects is next season's launching of
``The Classical Band'' in New York, an original instruments
orchestra of 40 or 50 players which will have guest conductors.
``Leonard Bernstein wants to have a go,'' Pinnock said, though
that's not yet definite.
   He says he wants to be free to perform any kind of music, though
Pinnock admits some limitations.
   ``I'm not good enough at playing jazz, which upsets me a lot,
becaust cards,'' he said,
naming the various cards he used. ``The picture cost $100,000, and
I put $40,000 on credit cards. It earned $8 million at the box
office.''
   ``Hollywood Shuffle'' is a satire on the way movie industry
treats blacks and the compromises they face if they want to be a
part of it. ``Hollywood Shuffle'' got Townsend some serious
attention from the studios _ which suggests the most important
color in Hollywood is green.
   He recently completed ``Finding Maubee,'' a suspense story in
which he co-stars with Denzel Washington. Next, he'll do ``The Five
Heartbeats,'' a comedy-drama about a black singing group. He wrote
the script with his partner, Keenen Wayans, who also worked with
him on ``Hollywood Shuffle.''
   Now, why does he wear the hat and coat when he performs comedy?
   He smiled and said, ``It's just good luck. I've had it for six
years. It's always brought me luck.''

   When oil prices fell in 1986, support surged
for Carl I. Hagen's small but boistrous anti-tax party.
   The Progress Party, once shunned as a right-wing fringe group,
has been surging ever since.
   Recent polls indicate the party has the support of 22 percent of
Norway's voters in a political arena traditionally dominated by the
Labor Party and the Conservatives.
   The Storting (parliament), where the Progress Party has only two
of the 157 seats, appears headed for a ``political earthquake'' in
next year's elections, the weekly newspaper Nytt Fra Norge said
recently.
   Anti-tax forces have also gained ground in Denmark, another
Scandinavian welfare state. Norway, however, had grown rich from
its North Sea oilfields, and the 1986 price collapse hit Norwegians
particularly hard.
   The standard of living has dropped in Norway for the first time
since World War II, triggering a wave of discontent and criticism
of the established parties.
   ``We have a whole load of solutions to the problems,'' Hagen
tells Norwegians.
   Hagen, 44, wants to lower taxes, restrict immigration, cut down
the public sector and let private companies handle traditional
welfare state tasks, such as hospital care, child care and care for
the elderly.
   In a country where big welfare benefits, financed through taxes,
were taken for granted even by conservatives, Hagen's policies were
considered extreme.
   However, Conservative Party policies, recently outlined,
borrowed some of Hagen's ideas, an apparent attempt to ride the
trend in advance of the elections set for Sept. 11, 1989.
   Hagen is a powerful speaker who often shouts down opponents in
the Storting, a chamber more accustomed to hushed and polite tones.
   Sitting amid piles of newspaper clippings at his small office in
the Storting building, Hagen told a visitor that the state handles
defense, schools, hospitals in a ``miserably poor way.''
   He claimed the Scandinavian welfare state does not function well
because, he said, it is modeled after East bloc socialism and
``acts as a guardian interfering in all things between heaven and
Earth.''
   A strong advocate of a free-market economy, Hagen maintains the
government's functions should be restricted to basics such as
defense and law and order.
   Political analysts say Hagen became so popular mainly because
there is no other non-socialist alternative to Prime Minister Gro
Harlem Brundtland's Labor Party.
   Lars Hellberg, a political commentator for the conservative
newspaper Aftenposten, wrote that cooperation among the
Conservatives, the farmer-dominated Center Party and the Christian
Democrats had ``completely crashed,'' since conservative leader
Kaare Willoch's three-party coalition resigned in 1986.
   He said the consequent ``irritation, frustration and
desperation'' benefited Hagen.
   The Progress Party also is getting support for its attacks on
Norway's open-door refugee policy, Hellberg said.
   In a poll published in Aftenposten on Sept. 3, Hagen had support
from 22.2 percent of the voters, compared with 3.7 in the election
of 1985.
   The three non-socialist parties fell from 45.3 percent in 1985
to 33.1 percent, with the Conservative Party dropping from 30.4
percent to 20.8. The Labor Party dropped from 40.8 percent to 31
percent.
   Despite the potential impact of the Progress Party in the 1989
elections, the other parties in the Storting have refused to
cooperate with Hagen.
   He studied economics in Britain and formerly represented a
British sugar company in Norway. He joined the Progress party when
it was formed in 1973 and became its leader the same year.
   ``In 1985, when oil prices were at their highest point, our
election results were poor,'' he said in the interview in his
office. ``But in 1986-1987 when it became necessary to save, people
grew more interested.''
   Largely because of the oil, Norwegians had grown accustomed to a
steady rise in economic growth and an expanding welfare system.
   Government revenue from North Sea oil was $7.3 billion in 1985,
more than 21 percent of the national budget. For 1988 it is
expected to be about the same as for 1986 and 1987 at $2.3 billion,
or 5 percent of the budget.
   Finance Ministry spokesman Jan-Ove Ekeberg said the slump came
amid a two-year ``consumption party'' where private consumption
increasedby 16 percent.
   He added that Norwegians should brace for ``big reductions'' in
coming years.
   Brundtland's Labor government has lowered consumption levels,
slowed inflation and lessened the current trade deficit. But the
growth of the gross national product is expected to remain at about
1 percent in 1988, compared with 4.4 percent in 1984-1985 and an
expected 2.5 percent average for the Western industrialized
countries.

<HEAD>Church Lawyers Warn Against Choosing Sides On Candidates</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Church lawyers are laying down some strict
guidlines on what religious organization can _ and cannot _ do in
the current crush of political campaigning.
   The key warning is that they must not support or oppose specific
candidates, or seem by implication to do so, since it would
endanger a church's tax exemption.
   Attorneys for the country's two largest Christian groups _
Baptists and Roman Catholics _ have issued lengthy instructions for
church organizations on avoiding partisan political activity.
   Indications were of a new cautiousness among church groups about
the matter in an election year.
   The Internal Revenue Service ``has a newfound enthusiasm for
scrutiny of religious organizations,'' says Mark E. Chopko, general
counsel of the U.S. Catholic Conference.
   Citing restrictions laid down in the IRS code on tax exemptions
for religious organization, he advises:
   ``During an election campaign, exempt organizations remain free
to address issues of concern to them and to their membership ...
However, such discourse must focus on issues and not
personalities.''
   Oliver S. Thomas, general counsel for the Baptist Joint
Committee on Public Affairs, advises that churches, to avoid
jeopardizing their tax-exempt status, must heed the following rules:
   _ Don't support or oppose a candidate directly or indirectly,
whether in a sermon, church newsletter, sample ballot, or by
financial means. Avoid pejorative labels when mentioning a
candidate by name.
   _ Don't provide volunteers, mailing lists, publicity, nor
distribute or display campaign literature on church premises, or
provide free use of facilities unless made available equally to all
parties and candidates.
   However, both Catholic and Baptist advisories note that churches
may hold non-partisan public forums or debates where all candidates
have a chance to state their views and distribute their literature.
   The sponsoring church organization, however, must not present
its views on the topics discussed. Thomas says:
   ``It is advisable for the organization, in introducing a
candidate, to state clearly and emphatically that the views of the
candidate are not necessarily the views of the church and no
endorsement is intended by the candidate's presence.''
   Nevertheless, it was emphasized that religious organizations
have a constitutional right to take sides on political issues, so
long as their views aren't explicitly applied for or against
specific candidates.
   ``In reality, participation in the public debate on important
issues inevitably overlaps with positions taken by certain
candidates,'' Chopko observes.
   ``Nonetheless, issue-oriented speech is protected by the first
admendment of the Constitution, and is entirely proper.''
   Also, church employees and officials may participate freely in
the political campaigning as individuals, providing it is made
clear they are not acting as representatives of the church.
   ``If a diocesan or parish official speaks at a rally supporting
a particular candidate, he should avoid being introduced in his
official capacity,'' Chopko says.
   Thomas also stresses that point, adding that if a minister is
involved, and mention is made of his church, there should also be a
disclaimer making clear he is not speaking on the church's behalf.
   ``Separating the minister's role as an individual voter from his
role as a church leader is always difficult,'' Thomas says, adding:
   ``A minister should never endorse a candidate from the pulpit,
even though he might insist he is speaking in his individual
capacity.''
   Regarding church newspapers or other publications, Chopko said
they ``may not endorse any candidate, through an editorial or
otherwise,'' but they ``may report election and other political
news in an unbiased manner.''
   The attorneys cite these among permissible church political
activities:
   _ They may distribute materials to educate voters, provided the
publications state their educational purposes and disclaim any
intention to favor or oppose any candidate.
   _ They may sponsor voter registration drives, provided no
evidence exists of bias toward any candidate or party.
   _ They may poll candidates on positions, so long as the
questionnaire is unbiased and covers a wide range of issues, and
results are reported fairly.
   _ They may distribute voting records of legislators or members
of Congress, so long as there is no indication of bias, as would be
the case in stating whether legislators' positions agree or
disagree with church positions.
   Chopko notes that the Catholic Church operates under an IRS
``group ruling'' of tax exemption, covering all its affiliated
institutions and parishes.
   Violations would endanger ``exemptions for everyone. Thus we
must take the prohibition seriously.''

<HEAD>Women Adapt to Shipboard Duty in Sweden's Navy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARTHUR MAX</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ABOARD THE HMS STOCKHOLM, Baltic Sea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ensign Karin
Berglund explained as she navigated this Swedish missile carrier
through a treacherous Baltic archipelago that she's just a sailor
``like everybody else on board.''
   ``I've always been interested in sailing and the sea, and I
couldn't find anything I wanted to do more than go into the navy,''
said the 25-year-old officer, seated at a bank of radar screens and
navigation maps on the bridge. ``I don't see myself as a woman in
the navy. I'm just one of the crew.''
   She is one of three women _ the only woman officer _ in the
32-member crew of the HMS Stockholm, a 330-ton corvette serving as
the flagship of Sweden's hard-pressed anti-submarine warfare unit.
   For a nation once considered a leader of the sexual revolution,
professional military service for women came late. Sweden's officer
corps were opened to women only in 1980.
   Military life still attracts few females, and many of them use
their military training in technical professions to move into
higher paid civilian careers.
   Defense Ministry figures say 114 women are among the 16,000
officers in the standing and reserve services of all branches. The
highest ranking officer is Col. Anne-Marie Goransson, a surgeon in
the medical corps.
   Women are not drafted as men are but have served since early
this century in auxiliary units as cooks, cleaners or drivers. More
than 50,000 women belong to these units today.
   ``Having girls on board has changed the way the men behave.
They're much more civilized than they were,'' said Cmdr. Lennart
Danielsson, who has women in his compliment for the first time this
year.
   Unlike many ships, no pinups grace the walls of the enlisted
crew quarters, where two women sleep among 12 men. There are no
curtains or special facilities, but the women don't seem to mind.
   ``It took a week or so to get used to, but then it was so
natural,'' said Sgt. Ewa Kroog, a 20-year-old signals operator.
   Kroog said she adjusted to a male environment during basic
training and in her signals course, when she was bunked in a room
with five other women in an otherwise all-male barracks.
   ``Of course the first week you took the towel into the shower
with you, but after that you don't think about it. You get used to
it very fast,'' she said.
   Once on board ship, she said, ``It was the guys who had
problems. I knew what I was getting into when I decided to go into
the navy. The guys didn't beg to have girls here.''
   Officers normally sleep in two-man cabins, which could have been
problematic for Berglund, her skipper said. Danielsson assigned her
to a four-bunk cabin to avoid gossip.
   Shipboard romances were out, said Kroog, who has a boyfriend on
another ship. ``It must be all business, otherwise it wouldn't work
down here.''
   The navy and air force have been more successful absorbing women
than the army, which issued a report last year that women were
performing badly in the artillery and engineering corps. But they
often do better than men in services requiring technical ability,
the report said.
   The report recommended that women remain barred from the
cavalry, armored corps and infantry, which it said were physically
too demanding. The air force has no women pilots.
   ``There is something unnatural about young girls lifting heavy
gun carriages or running with heavy weapons,'' the army commander,
Lt. Gen. Erik Bengtsson, said in a newspaper interview last year
and later came under heavy criticism for saying it.
   In the navy, women are not allowed to serve in submarines or as
naval commandos, where deep sea pressure could cause miscarriages
in pregnant sailors.

<HEAD>Mad Dogs and Englishmen: The Reformed Joe Cocker</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WINSOR DOBBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SYDNEY, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Joe Cocker, the hell-raiser of rock 'n'
roll, has unchained his heart and says he's a reformed man.
   Though its been almost two decades since he performed a
memorable rendition of ``With a Little Help From My Friends'' at
the Woodstock music festival, Cocker is riding a new wave of
popularity with his album ``Unchain My Heart,'' and is proving he
is no fading star.
   On his eighth tour to Australia this month, the 44-year-old
rocker is playing 15,000-seat venues amid huge publicity.
   His consumption of booze and drugs is legendary, as are his
rasping voice and twitching body moves. But he's best remembered
for his appearance at Woodstock in 1969, and the Mad Dogs and
Englishmen tour, with its huge entourage of 40 musicians, wives,
girlfriends, children and hangers-on. Recordings and movies were
made of both. He's also known for many ``comebacks.''
   
   ``With a Little Help From My Friends'' was Cocker's first big
hit single in Europe and the title of his first album in 1969.
   
   His hit singles in the United States include ``The Letter'' and
``Cry Me a River'' in 1970, ``You Are So Beautiful'' in 1974 and
the 1982 duet with Jennifer Warnes, ``Up Where We Belong,'' from
the soundtrack of ``An Officer and a Gentleman.'' The duet has been
his only No. 1 hit in the United States and won both Cocker and
Warnes their only Grammy.
   Cocker's three most recent albums are on Capitol: ``Civilized
Man'' in 1984; ``Cocker,'' 1986; and ``Unchain My Heart,'' 1987, an
LP inspired by Ray Charles who originally recorded the title cut.
   He's come through some tough times and ``made and lost baby
fortunes,'' but his appetite for life remains undiminished. The
calm, contented Cocker of 1988 is vastly changed from the raw,
rampaging singer of more than a decade ago.
   He once was known as one of the most unreliable people in show
business. Nowadays, Cocker treats his business very differently.
   ``I still go a bit nuts once in a while _ everybody does,'' he
said. ``But I take my performing very seriously now. I don't like
to get wrecked before a show.''
   Moderation is his keyword _ he's aware he took himself to the
brink, and survived.
   Cocker, born in working-class Sheffield in the north of England,
began working as a musician at the age of 16, playing drums and
harmonica for a band known as the Cavaliers. He switched to vocals
in 1961 and the group changed its name to Vance Arnold and the
Avengers, supporting such acts as the Hollies and the Rolling
Stones.
   Cocker quit his job as a gas fitter in 1964 for a music career,
but he wasn't very successful and returned to life with the East
Midlands Gas Board.
   His big break came when he assembled the Grease Band in the
1960s. The group recorded a cover of the Beatles tune ``With a
Little Help From My Friends,'' which became a No. 1 hit in Britain.
   After Woodstock, Cocker went on to team with Leon Russell for
the legendary Mad Dogs and Englishmen tour of 1970, which produced
a film, a double LP and the hit songs ``Delta Lady'' and ``The
Letter.''
   Then his career went downhill. His drunkenness increased, and he
was arrested in Australia for possession of marijuana.
   ``I had times when I went on very bad down trips,'' he said.
   His output, despite the 1974 hit, ``You Are So Beautiful,''
became decidely patchy.
   ``There are things about the mid-'70s that I dont remember at
all,'' he admits.
   His career revived in 1982 when he teamed with Warnes for ``Up
Where We Belong.'' His recent hits include ``A Civilized Man,''
``Shelter Me,'' ``Dont You Love Me Anymore,'' ``You Can Leave Your
Hat On'' and the rhythm and blusey ``Unchain My Heart.''
   Cocker says that while he has mellowed and become more
disciplined, his stage performance has not.
   ``Im still a pretty wild performer,'' he said. ``I feel
re-energized recently.''
   But he now shuns drugs: ``At 44, how many times can you beat
yourself against a wall without it hurting?
   ``I had a taste of just about everything out there,'' he said.
``I feel grateful I came out of it.''
   In 1979, he moved to Santa Barbara, Calif., and married last
year for the first time.

   The Moody Blues, the British band that
brought an elegance of sound to rock 'n' roll in the 1960s, is
struggling with political in-fighting over its direction and style.
   But Swiss-born keyboardist Patrick Moraz, who joined the band in
1978 with the departure of singer Mike Pinder, says he's confident
its five members can soar above the turmoil ``to write some
incredible material as a group.''
   ``There is a lot of political decisions and policies being made
behind the scenes about who composes what,'' Moraz said in a
telephone interview from Los Angeles prior to a recent concert at
ParkWest Resort near Salt Lake City. ``But that really shouldn't
hinder the fact that we are a group and we are a very good group,
probably one of the best in the world.''
   The group launched a nationwide tour this summer in Cincinnati
to mark the 20th anniversary of the British rockers' first U.S.
tour.
   The outspoken Moraz said he was not happy with the group's
newest album, ``Sur La Mer'' (``On the Sea''), released in the
United States in June. It was weak, he said, and had undergone ``a
corporate approach.''
   He was particularly upset that flutist-singer Ray Thomas, an
original member of The Moody Blues, was not called by the producer
to participate.
   ``I think it's inexcusable, personally. He's a very important
force in The Moody Blues, like all of us,'' Moraz said. The album
is selling moderately well and one of its songs, ``I Know You're
Out There Somewhere,'' was at the top of the pop charts this summer.
   It was 1967 when The Moody Blues delighted millions with the
release of its single, ``Nights in White Satin,'' a haunting,
choir-like love song written by lead singer Justin Hayward. That
was followed by the highly acclaimed and successful album, ``Days
of Future Passed.'' The group had earlier hit the charts with ``Go
Now,'' the No. 1 single in Britain in 1964.
   In their 22 years, The Moody Blues _ the other members are
singer-guitarist John Lodge and drummer Graeme Edge _ have sold
more than 50 million albums and traveled the world time and again
giving concerts and writing songs.
   The group broke up in the early 1970s, but reunited six years
later. In the interim, Hayward and Lodge produced an album, ``Blue
Jays.'' Thomas, Pinder and Lodge each produced albums of their own.
   However, in 1978, the five decided to revive The Moody Blues'
sound. In the course of making ``Octave,'' their 10th album, Pinder
left, and Moraz, with his classical music background and a string
of self-produced albums behind him, was recruited.
   Do the conflicts within the Moody Blues auger badly for the
future?
   ``Conflict always weakens. If the conflict can come to a
self-transformation which calls for growth of creativity and then
fanning that fire so the group would benefit, it's good,'' said
Moraz, a former keyboardist for Yes. ``If a conflict generates into
a bitter ... situation, then obviously it weakens the whole system
and that probably is what happened on this last album.
   ``It's a very simple-type political matter. ... There's a
segment of egos out there and that weakens the whole thing. And a
group like The Moody Blues should show the example because they put
it in their songs. So why can't we apply it to our lives and our
artistic life as a group?''
   Despite the disagreements, The Moody Blues have no intention of
breaking up again.
   ``I mean, things happen all the time with rock 'n' roll groups
and everything. But after 22 years of almost living happily ever
after ... there's no reason why we should do that,'' he said.
   ``No, no, no. We all are conscious of our own mistakes and
everybody makes mistakes. I'm absolutely positive the group will
stay together.''
   Said lead singer Justin Hayward in an earlier interview with The
Associated Press: ``We might go on forever. There is no such thing
as retirement as far as we are concerned. After all, what would we
do then?''

   When celebrity biographer Albert Goldman began
digging into ``The Lives of John Lennon,'' his first move was to
mail a long, reverential request for help to Yoko Ono.
   ``She was Numero Uno, you've got to start with her. I sent her a
sincere letter, because at that time I was a true believer in
rock's greatest love story. ... I told her, `I'm in your corner,'''
Goldman recalled.
   Ono never responded. And after 1,200 interviews and 6{ years,
the dream was over for Goldman, his mythic view of Lennon the Great
altered.
   Expecting the best, Goldman claims to have uncovered the worst:
a volatile, debauched Lennon who evolved into the Howard Hughes of
rock 'n' roll, tucked in his Dakota bed for days at a time.
   That vision of the ex-Beatle has infuriated Lennon supporters,
family and friends and prompted charges of fiction writing; it also
taught Goldman _ who says he is a John Lennon fan _ a hard lesson.
   ``It doesn't pay to meet your idols. Just enjoy them; don't try
to see the reality,'' Goldman said. ``My books are a cold dose of
reality. You get in the Beatle shower, and suddenly the water goes
cold.''
   Goldman, whose past tell-all biographies dealt with Elvis
Presley and Lenny Bruce, remains unmoved by the hue and cry from
the music industry, from Ono and from Lennon's Beatle buddy, Paul
McCartney.
   ``My books are bad for business,'' Goldman said in a phone
interview from Munich, West Germany. ``They're bad for Paul's
business, bad for Yoko's business, back for the jive myth of rock
business. Those people have to hate me.''
   Myth-shattering is a not a bad thing, Goldman said. For example,
he cites Lennon's disillusioning meeting with Presley at Graceland
in 1965.
   ``John was very hooked into Elvis. Elvis was his measure of
success,'' said Goldman. ``And the myth of Elvis: awesome. But the
reality of Elvis: a mess.''
   Goldman also rejected the complaint raised by Ono, McCartney,
Julian Lennon and others that Lennon is an easy target to defame
because he's no longer around to answer the allegations.
   ``You can't say John lacks for defenders. And Yoko isn't dead.
Colonel Parker (Presley's manager) isn't dead. Ninety-five percent
of the people in my books aren't dead. They can do something about
it,'' said Goldman, his voice quickening.
   ``This business of making it easy for defending myself is
insane. I'm the target of scores of attacks. I can't imagine a
harder thing for an author.''
   Those attacks don't really bother him, unless they come from
someone who hasn't read ``The Lives of John Lennon,'' Goldman said.
   ``A lot of people already made up their minds. They hear Albert
Goldman, John Lennon, homosexuality _ bang, let him have it! I
resent people commenting on a book they haven't read, including
Yoko,'' the author said.
   Ono's reaction came on a nationally broadcast response to the
book. She labeled Goldman's version of life with the Lennons
``totally fiction'' and brought out Lennon's sons, Julian and
12-year-old Sean, to refute the biography.
   ``These giant promotions of Yoko are presented as honest
documentaries, when they're in-house documentaries,'' said Goldman,
who complimented Ono on a well-prepared show. ``She takes no
chances. This was another no-chance Yoko.''
   As for the sensational charges of bisexuality, drug abuse by
Yoko and John, wild drinking binges, anorexia and reclusiveness,
Goldman says it all fits together with the image of Lennon
presented by those who knew him.
   ``My thesis is John Lennon was a divided mind. Every yin had a
yang,'' said Goldman. ``There is nothing more natural than for John
to try the other side (sexually). That's just the kind of guy he
was. He wanted to try everything once.''

   In the three months
Yellowstone National Park has burned, firefighters have struggled
heroically, politicians have pointed fingers and the park has
quietly gone about healing itself.
   Just eight weeks after flames roared past the Grant Village
complex on Lake Yellowstone, wildflowers already have sprouted from
the blackened soil.
   By the time a blue-ribbon panel of experts convenes in
mid-October to review the devastation and recommend a
rehabilitation plan, the seeds for recovery will have been sown _
in some cases, by the very flames that have destroyed nearly half
the park's 2.2 million acres.
   ``The meadows, I would anticipate by next July you would not
even be able to tell that there was a fire there,'' said John
Varley, the park's chief researcher. ``They respond that fast.
   ``The areas of the forest that had a ground fire, but not a
crown fire, it will be difficult to tell that they were burned,''
he said. ``The areas that were totally consumed by fire will come
back and essentially be 100 percent plant cover in three to five
years. That 100 percent plant cover will be perennial grasses,
wildflowers, the return of the shrubs, and willows and so forth.''
   Also returning to the landscape will be lodgepole pines, which
already are reseeding. The fires melted a protective resin covering
the pine cones, allowing seeds to fall to the earth.
   ``Fires have changed the face of Yellowstone this summer, but
much has not changed,'' said Ed Lewis, executive director of the
Greater Yellowstone Coalition. The group serves as a public
watchdog over management of Yellowstone and neighboring national
forests.
   ``Elk, bison, bears and other wildlife species still roam the
park and the surrounding millions of acres of wildlands,'' he said.
``Yellowstone's world-famous geysers still gush, whistle and roar,
and Yellowstone's spectacular rivers and waterfalls still flow.''
   Gone from Yellowstone will be many of the insect-killed trees
that littered the forest floor and fueled the fires.
   While experts debate how to clean up the scorched landscape now
littered with snags and ash, the insect world will be converting
the timber into detritus.
   ``They (the trees) are being attacked by insects _ right now,
right this very moment _ that love freshly killed trees,'' Varley
said, adding that they include termites, ants, beetles and other
species.
   ``They are not, let me make this distinction, the same kinds of
insects that attack live trees, so we are not serving as some kind
of pestilence for the remaining live trees,'' he said. ``That will
in turn bring in a host of bird species that feed on those kinds of
things.
   ``The bears spend a lot of time with ants and termites in these
freshly dead and decaying trees, so there is a very interesting
component coming in there in the insect world that will feed a lot
of animals, birds and so forth.''
   The fires have spawned political controversy over the National
Park Service's ``let it burn'' policy toward naturally ignited
fires. Wyoming Sens. Malcolm Wallop and Alan Simpson have called
for Park Service director William Penn Mott's resignation over the
handling of the blazes.
   But many observers say nothing in Yellowstone really was
destroyed. They say the alterations are simply the park's latest
growing pains.
   No species have been driven from the park or tossed into
extinction by the fires, Varley points out.
   He said the only real tragedy of the fires that charred more
than 1.5 million acres in Yellowstone and its surrounding national
forests in Wyoming, Idaho and Montana was the destruction of some
structures and the economic hardships endured by some.
   ``Ecologically, strictly ecologically speaking, there is really
no downside to this story,'' Varley said. ``Where the downside
comes in is when you talk about human values, values to life and
property, and the very legitimate and sincere concerns that the
people who are our neighbors have, and so forth.
   ``This area has been putting up with fires like this for the
last 10,000 to 12,000 years, and it has adapted to be able to deal
with it,'' he said.
   Many businessmen in the cities and towns surrounding
Yellowstone, while suffering through a dismal tourist season this
year, actually expect the fires to spur a boom of sorts next year.
   ``I think the park will have a lot of people out of curiosity,''
said Dan Dowdy, who runs a campground and motel in Gardiner, Mont.,
on the northern edge of Yellowstone.
   Those visitors, as they make their way around the Grand Loop
that links Old Faithful, Mammoth Hot Springs, and several campsites
and stopovers, will be able to pull over and watch the park mend
itself, said Varley.
   ``We have in progress the development of an interpretive plan
that will tell the visitor next year the story of the `Summer of
'88.' I think it will be a fascinating story,'' he said. ``The
visitor will be able to go into and look at these areas one year
post-burning.
   ``But then we have areas along the roadside that are 10 years
post-burning, 35 years post-burning, 80 years, 100 years, and so
they'll be able to see this forest succession that is caused by
fires,'' Varley said.
   The tourists also can expect to find elk, moose, bears and bison
in many of the areas where they were before, he said.
   ``The information that comes to us from the firefighters and all
the other people that are out in the field right now suggests that
the animals are surprisingly nonchalant about the fires,'' said
Varley. ``We have numerous observations of elk bedded down in
meadows right next to where these great conflagrations are going on.
   ``And we also have a lot of evidence that they move into these
blackened areas soon after the fire passes,'' he added.
   There's really no reason to avoid Yellowstone in the years to
come, Lewis believes.
   ``The reasons that people visit the park are still there and
will still be there next year,'' he said. ``The message is is that
Yellowstone has changed but has not disappeared or died.''

   The sun comes up, a
faraway fireball heralding another day of waning summer in
Yellowstone National Park.
   After three nerve-wracking months and a blessed few inches of
early snow, the walls of flame are gone. The 60 mph winds that
danced embers from treetop to treetop have died away. The small
tourist towns that hug the boundaries of the world's first national
park are no longer threatened with annihilation.
   On the horizon is only a hint of smoke and haze.
   But Yellowstone is a casualty of what historians describe as its
worst summer of drought and flames in 300 years. Famous around the
world as a pristine symbol of wilderness, this vast park is now a
mosaic of green and black, living forests and dead trees.
   Nearly half of Yellowstone's 2.2 million acres have been touched
by fires with names like Hellroaring and Storm, North Fork and
Clover Mist. Millions of black matchsticks are all that remain of
once-thriving lodgepoles and blue spruce, aspens and firs.
   Because the flames were fickle, there are also huge patches of
sweet-smelling pines growing next to miles of charred forest. There
are fragrant meadows hard by singed marsh. Delicate ferns, turning
gold with the equinox, still grow next to creekbeds seared of every
blade of grass.
   Yellowstone National Park is not a total wasteland of scorched
earth and moonscape, but it is not the place it used to be.
   Already, charges of mismanagement and bad policy are being
leveled against park rangers. Congressional hearings and internal
reviews promise to drag on from autumn into winter and beyond.
There are fears about the future of Yellowstone's fisheries and
wildlife when ash and silt flow into streams and lakes next spring.
   More than 8,000 firefighters from the National Park Service,
Forest Service, the Army and even the Marine Corps descended on
Yellowstone to do battle, taking on one of nature's most awesome
forces with picks and shovels, hoses and hand tools.
   Daily, they still criss-cross the park in camouflage-painted
armored vehicles and chartreuse pumper trucks bearing license
plates from California to Florida. They overflow campgrounds with
their tents and catering crews and line up at pay phones to call
faraway loved ones who demand to know when they're coming home.
   But beyond the hustle of command posts and bivouacs, the birds
are singing. Old Faithful still is. Trumpeter swans, swimming in
pairs, still grace the Madison River as it meanders through its own
plateau. The Fountain Paint Pots still gurgle and steam. And the
mountains cast the same shadows hunters saw as far back as 5,000
years ago.
   ``The park is just a howling wilderness of 3,000 square miles,
full of all imaginable freaks of a fiery nature,'' wrote Rudyard
Kipling of Yellowstone in 1889.
   And so it is today.
   Those who come to Yellowstone after the fires will still see the
same breathtaking vista from Artist Point that inspired painters
Thomas Moran and Albert Bierstadt in the 1800s.
   The 700-foot sheer drop and two roaring waterfalls of the Grand
Canyon of the Yellowstone are the same as when the park's first
superintendent, Nathaniel P. Langford, was prompted to write: ``I
realized my own littleness, my helplessness, my dread exposure to
destruction, my inability to cope with or even comprehend the
mighty architecture of nature.''
   Along Virginia Cascade drive are many unspoiled spots where
falling pine needles have created a soft carpet of ground cover.
But farther down the slope lies graphic evidence of the ominous
spiral of fire that swept through that place with particular fury.
   Right above the falls there are still little puffs of smoke, and
an occasional lick of distant flames still waiting for mop-up
crews. In one turnout, five tidy picnic tables stand ready for the
next batch of campers.
   In the pastoral Hayden Valley, herds of bison graze in the
untouched meadows, a ragged chevron of geese fly overhead and the
Yellowstone River, its flow diminished by drought, braids its way
through the vast open bowl. Bull elk are everywhere.
   Just as President Theodore Roosevelt wrote during his visit in
1903, ``we saw an occasional pine squirrel, snowshoe rabbit or
marten; and in the open meadows around the hot waters there were
Canada geese and ducks of several species, and now and then a
coyote.''
   Farther south, around Yellowstone Lake, some hills on the
horizon are charred, some are not. But the fabled evening stillness
of the lake remains, its surface sometimes a mirror of its
surroundings.
   The geysers erupt as they did for naturalist John Muir in 1885:
``The wildest geysers in the world, in bright, triumphant bands,
are dancing and singing in it amid thousands of boiling springs,
mud volcanoes, mush and broth caldrons whose contents are of every
color and consistency, splash and heave and roar in bewildering
abundance.''
   As has been the case in recent years, most of Yellowstone's
bears are elusive, but many firefighters have seen them. Park
biologists are confident the bears are still in the back country.

<HEAD>Economists Say Job Paychecks More Important Than Ever to Farm
Families</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Donn Reimund cq. in 4th graf</NOTE>

   The financial health of farm families has been
aided dramatically in recent years by federal subsidies, but
Agriculture Department economists say a good job in town is the
real meal ticket for a growing number of those who live on the land.
   All told, the jobs and government payments helped push farm
household earnings ahead of the U.S. average in 1985 and again in
1986, the first time that has happened since the 1970s.
   The mainstay for many families has been off-farm income. The job
in town. A regular paycheck that is isolated from drought and the
whipsawing of commodity prices.
   ``Although many observers and analysts previously considered
off-farm employment as a transitional step to full-time farming
operation, off-farm employment is becoming more common as farm
operators and members of their households choose to pursue dual
careers,'' says Donn Reimund of the department's Economic Research
Service.
   The agency noted in a report last winter that off-farm incomes
were of growing importance to farm families and that the income gap
between farm and non-farm narrowed again in the mid-1980s after
widening since 1978.
   In the latest installment, reported in a forthcoming issue of
Farmline magazine, Reimund and his colleagues noted that the
incomes of farm households trailed the U.S. average for six
straight years before moving ahead in 1985 to an average of $29,436
against the national average for all households of $29,066, a 1
percent lead.
   The gap widened in 1986 to 11 percent as the farm average rose
to $34,246 per household, compared with $30,759 for the U.S.
average. Both were record levels.
   Department analysts attributed the rise in 1985 and 1986 to
lower production costs and higher direct government payments to
farmers, although increased incomes from off-farm jobs were also
factors.
   Federal payments to farmers were $8 billion in 1985 and rose to
$12 billion in 1986. Comparatively, in 1981, those were only $1.9
billion.
   But comparisons of average incomes do not explain income
distribution and can mask differences at the very high and low
levels. That is true of urban as well as farm families, but Reimund
said ``a higher percentage of farm operator households are below
the official povery level than are other households.''
   Only about 16 percent of the nation's farm families reported
receiving no off-farm income in 1986, based on USDA's annual Farm
Costs and Returns Survey.
   Mary Ahearn, another agency analyst, said that about half of the
households of farm operators in 1986 depended on off-farm sources
for two-thirds or more of their total cash income.
   These households were generally involved in small farming
operations, with sales of less than $40,000 a year, she said. On
the average, they reported a loss of $2,950 on farm operations in
1986 but earned $40,904 off the farm, resulting in a net cash
income of $37,954.
   Only 20 percent of the households in this group participated in
federal direct payment programs, and they received an average of
$6,380 each. Their small size precluded larger payments, because
federal subsidies are related to production.
   ``Until the 1970s, the nation's farm operator households lagged
behind the U.S. average in household incomes,'' the report said.
``Today, their incomes remain much more volatile than the steadily
rising U.S. average, but no longer are they always in the bottom
position.''
   Farm household income exceeded the U.S. average in eight of the
17 years, 1970 through 1986. Only two of those years _ 1985 and
1986 _ were in the '80s.
   Reimund said the first time was in 1972 as farm export markets
began to grow rapidly. In 1973, farm income shot up to an average
of $17,854 per household, 47 percent more than the U.S. average of
$12,157, a difference that has not been matched since.
   Has the trend continued in 1987 and 1988? Reimund said he had to
hedge a bit, particularly for this year's income comparisons.
   ``Last year was pretty good,'' he said. ``But 1988, it's a tough
one, with the drought and all. I guess we'll just have to wait and
see.''

   The reporters trailing George Bush could
overlook the smell of something burning aboard their Boeing 727,
but two days later when the pilot dumped fuel over Lake Michigan to
make an emergency landing, they'd had just about enough.
   Once on the ground in Chicago, they refused to reboard the Key
Air charter jet and scurried to make their own arrangements on
scheduled flights to the West Coast to catch up with the candidate,
who had flown on Air Force II.
   Key Air, meanwhile, trying to salvage its $1.8 million contract,
shadowed the Bush campaign with an empty airplane.
   The unexpected return to Chicago was prompted by concern about
flaps working properly.
   Mechanical troubles, aborted takeoffs, surprise government
inspections, the grounding of at least one plane, even a delay
caused by Secret Service agents poking holes in a plane when they
closed a door improperly, have marked this year's presidential
campaign trips.
   Among reporters, a skeptical lot under any circumstances,
there's been much chatter about safety aboard the chartered flights
which carry the press, campaign staff and candidates, except for
Bush who normally travels on Air Force II.
   The concerns were not eased after the Bush campaign dumped the
Key Air charter and temporarily hired United Airlines. On the first
United flight, an overheated engine prompted a pilot to abort a
takeoff as his Boeing 737 raced down a runway in Houston, Texas.
   ``Key Air, Key Air,'' came the sarcastic chant from the press
corps.
   The following week trouble struck Democratic presidential
nominee Michael Dukakis' campaign plane in Chicago. It's the same
plane he has flown all year and one aides say he particularly
favors, although members of the press have dubbed the stubby
20-year-old Boeing 737 ``Sky Pig'' because it can't make a
cross-country trip without landing for fuel.
   The plane, owned by Presidential Airways, was grounded after FAA
inspectors found several problems including a faulty emergency exit
light and a damaged vane that measures air flow and triggers the
alarm that would warn the pilots if their aircraft was about to
stall.
   The FAA inspection unleashed a controversy because of its
timing. Dukakis staffers wondered why inspectors showed up only 15
minutes before departure when the jet had been parked at the
airport all night. Dukakis had to cancel a campaign trip to Ohio.
   FAA officials denied any political motives and said the
inspectors had not been told they had so little time before the
scheduled departure. In the future ``we'll try to stay invisible,''
said Bob Goodrich, director of flight standards.
   Even for vice presidents, there are no guarantees. Once when
Vice President Spiro Agnew was on board, Air Force II was struck by
lightning and several years ago with Bush aboard it almost collided
with a small plane while landing in Seattle.
   News organizations reimburse the campaigns for the cost of the
charters with prices ranging from about 1{ times the cost of a
first class ticket to considerably more, depending on how many
people are on board. A seat on one coast-to-coast flights early in
the Bush campaign cost $5,000 because few reporters were aboard.
   Until recent years, the planes usually belonged to one of the
major airlines. But they no longer have the extra aircraft to
accommodate demands for charters.
   Recently when United took away its plane, Bush reporters were
told on the tarmac at Andrews Air Force Base near Washington they
had better make up their minds quickly about the replacement
airline, American Trans Air, because the Dukakis campaign was
negotiating for the plane as well.
   The charter airlines insist their safety record ranks favorably
with the major, regularly scheduled air carriers. The FAA agrees.
   ``I think it's unfortunate that these events (involving the Bush
press entourage) occurred. But mechanicals are sort of a way of
life,'' said Scott Andrews, a vice president of World Corp., the
owner of Key Air. He said his airline has a good maintenance record.
   World Corp., formerly World Airways when it was providing
scheduled air service, and its Key Air subsidiary has six DC-10s
and eight Boeing 727s carrying everything from a planeload of
tourists to rock bands.
   Flights on campaign charters over the years have never been
examples of decorum or _ for that matter _ strict compliance with
cabin safety regulations.
   ``People have been known to surf and ski down the aisles on
takeoff,'' says AP political writer Evans Witt. A favorite pastime
begun is the rolling of an orange down the aisle on takeoff to see
how far it gets before disappearing under a seat. Nancy Reagan used
to be a frequent participant.
   It also has not been unheard off for a flight attendant to be
hooted down during a preflight safety announcement.
   Some campaign veterans say the in-flight antics aren't as
rambunctious this year. They also suggest that this year's horror
stories pale when compared to some in campaigns past.
   Four years ago, a Lockheed Electra carrying Sen. John Glenn's
campaign flew into Sioux City, Iowa in a blinding snowstorm. On the
first approach the plane flew closer to the terminal than to the
runway, so Glenn, the former Marine fighter pilot and astronaut,
stuck his head into the cockpit to make sure the second landing was
more on target.
   Those covering Jesse Jackson's 1984 primary campaign still talk
about a trip on the same Electra from Washington to Dallas when it
was buffeted so severely by a storm that passengers were thrown
into the aisles. Upon landing Jackson knelt and kissed the ground,
vowing never to fly the plane again _ and didn't.
   Nine months later the same Electra, belonging to Galaxy
Airlines, crashed upon takeoff from the Reno, Nev., airport,
killing 68 people aboard. This time the plane was carrying a
Minnesota group returning from a weekend gambling excursion.

   For the second time in the brief
history of manned space flight, the United States is poised to
rebound from tragedy.
   The explosion of the shuttle Challenger on Jan. 28, 1986, bore
some striking similarities to another disaster almost exactly 19
years earlier _ the Apollo 1 fire of Jan. 27, 1967.
   In both cases, poor design, inadequate management, safety lapses
and communications breakdowns were at fault. Recovery required
months of remorse, realignment and repair.
   Failure to recover from Apollo 1 would have derailed America's
goal of a manned lunar landing before the end of the decade.
Another Challenger-type accident could deal a death blow to the
nation's space program.
   But the National Aeronautics and Space Administration bounced
back brilliantly from the 1967 fire and sent astronauts to the
moon. And now the agency says it has done everything it can to make
the shuttle a safe ship, and the first flight since Challenger is
set for liftoff Thursday.
   NASA is counting on success to revive its fortunes and provide a
springboard to a future that will include a permanent manned space
station and eventually flights to Mars and other parts of the solar
system.
   There is also the matter of national pride. Before Challenger,
the United States held undisputed world leadership in space
exploration. But since the accident, the Soviets have overtaken the
Americans in many categories, including manned spaceflight
experience, and they have a stated goal to dispatch men to Mars
early in the 21st century.
   In 1967, the United States also had its eye on the Soviet Union.
America had been stung by early Russian space successes and the two
superpowers were in a race to see which could first land men on the
moon as a symbol of technological prowess.
   Against that backdrop, the three Apollo 1 astronauts, Gus
Grissom, Ed White and Roger Chaffee, entered their capsule atop a
Saturn 1B rocket on that day late in January for a launch pad
countdown test. They were scheduled for launch into Earth orbit in
February on the first flight test of the Apollo spacecraft that was
to transport astronauts to the moon.
   Five hours later all three were dead, killed by a fire that
swept through the spacecraft.
   An investigation board could not pinpoint definitely the cause
of the fire, but listed the most likely source as an electric arc
in defective wiring under Grissom's seat.
   The report criticized NASA and North American Aviation, the
capsule builder, for poor management, carelessness, negligence,
sloppy work and failure to adequately consider the safety of the
astronauts.
   Top management at both were overhauled, and a $75 million
program was launched to redesign the spacecraft.
   Twenty-one months after the accident, on Oct. 11, 1968, the
effort paid off when three astronauts rode a redesigned capsule
into orbit and thoroughly checked it out during an 11-day flight.
The mission was so successful that NASA scheduled the next flight
as an orbital trip around the moon on Christmas Eve.
   Two more preliminary flights followed, and on July 20, 1969,
astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin set foot on the moon,
beating President John F. Kennedy's end-of-the-decade deadline by
five months.
   Six more moon missions followed, but three others were canceled.
   The United States had won the race to the moon, leaving the
Soviets far behind. But ironically, with the end of this era came a
long, troubled period for NASA.
   The agency should not have been surprised. From a peak budget of
$6 billion in 1965, at the height of Apollo development, NASA's
fortunes had been declining every year. Several next-generation
proposals had been rejected or scaled down.
   NASA had counted on the tide of Apollo 11 enthusiasm to rescue
its bold plans for the future. But the agency misread the mood of a
nation torn by Vietnam and by racial unrest. Much of the press and
some politicians came to view the space effort as a symbol of
misplaced national priorities. With detente, the Soviet threat no
longer seemed so ominous.
   Congress and the Nixon administration told the agency to scrap
its plans for large space stations, a moon base and manned trips to
Mars. NASA budgets fell below $4 billion, its personnel from a peak
of 36,000 to 21,000.
   The only major project to survive was the reusable space
shuttle, but it was years away.
   In the interim, NASA used leftover Apollo rockets and spacecraft
to build Skylab, a modest space station which in 1973 and 1974
served as orbital home to three crews for periods up to 84 days.
Another leftover Apollo capsule carried three American astronauts
to a linkup with two Soviet cosmonauts in 1975.
   Following that flight, the American manned space program entered
a dry spell of six years.
   NASA had hoped to launch the first shuttle in 1978, but there
were funding difficulties and serious design and development
problems.
   The shortage of money forced engineers to abandon plans for a
fully reusable shuttle employing only liquid fuel engines. Instead
they settled on two solid fuel rockets to assist the craft into
orbit _ a decision that would come back to haunt them the day
Challenger blew up.
   Columbia, the first shuttle, made it into orbit in April 1981,
starting a string of 24 successful flights. The program boasted
some remarkable achievements, from flying the first American women
and black astronauts, to deploying satellites, retrieving and
repairing others and conducting pioneering experiments in a cargo
bay unit known as Spacelab.
   Spaceflight seemingly had become routine and NASA became so
confident of its machine that it added congressmen, a Saudi prince
and non-astronaut researchers and scientists to the crews.
   A schoolteacher, Christa McAuliffe, was in the crew of seven
when the string ended with that awful explosion of Challenger 73
seconds after liftoff on a cold January day in 1986.
   When the Rogers commission that investigated the accident
released its report, it sounded as though the space agency had
forgotten the lessons of Apollo 1.
   The report said the direct cause of the explosion was a leak at
a joint between two segments of one of Challenger's two solid fuel
booster rockets. Flames shot past two synthetic rubber O-rings and
ignited the external fuel tank.
   The commission said cold weather, 36 degrees at launch time,
contributed to the accident by robbing the rings of their
resiliency, preventing them from sealing the joint properly. Some
engineers had argued with lower-level managers against launching in
the cold, but their concerns never were communicated to those
making the launch decision.
   The report scored NASA for lapses in judgment, safety, design,
communications and management. There were wholesale shakeups of
management at the space agency and the booster rocket maker, Morton
Thiokol, and a $1.2 billion redesign program was undertaken.
   A total of 56 major and 400 lesser changes have been made to
Discovery. NASA says it now is ready to put them and its future to
the test.

<HEAD>Back to Expendable Rockets, Following Challenger</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HARRY F. ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four years ago, while space shuttles were
making regular satellite-delivery runs into orbit, the Air Force
began agitating for a return to rocket launches in case something
went wrong with the shuttle fleet.
   Something did go horribly wrong _ Challenger _ and the space
program is back where it started 30 years ago, using expendable
rockets.
   Edward C. Aldridge, then undersecretary of the Air Force,
sounded the warning before Congress in 1984.
   ``We simply cannot afford to be in a situation, whatever the
view on its likelihood, that could result in our being denied all
access to space,'' he said. ``The Department of Defense must not be
totally dependent on the shuttle ... We feel that having our total
launch capability placed on the shuttle is an unacceptable risk.''
   Aldridge's testimony was the capstone of a furious fight with a
sister agency, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration,
which contended that the Air Force was trying to undermine the
civilian shuttle program by pushing for a return to large,
expensive, ``expendable launch vehicles'' to put military
satellites in orbit. The space agency all along had counted on the
military to be its paying customer on at least one-third of all
flights.
   Aldridge, now secretary of the Air Force, got his ELVs. His
warnings proved to be prophetic when the Challenger blew up on Jan.
28, 1986. Because of his efforts, an assembly line was starting to
put an improved version of the Air Force's workhorse Titan rocket
together.
   Like all disasters, the space program's came in threes. On April
18, a Titan 34-D exploded five seconds after launch with a secret
military payload and on May 3, a Delta, carrying a $57 million
weather satellite, had to be destroyed when it veered out of
control. The United States was left with no capacity to launch
heavy payloads.
   With the shuttle fleet grounded for nearly three years and
expensive satellites sitting in warehouses with no place to go, the
expendable launch vehicle industry had a slow rebirth.
   President Reagan ordered NASA out of the commercial launching
business; the Air Force began spending billions to restore an ELV
fleet that was all but depleted; owners of satellites with no way
to orbit began booking rides with the European consortium
Arianespace; and both China and the Soviet Union began soliciting
launch business.
   As of July 23, Arianespace has contracts to launch 40 satellites
for $2.3 billion, including 7 from the United States and more than
a dozen from other countries and international organizations that
previously used American launch vehicles.
   For years, the United States had encouraged development of a
private launch industry, but not a single customer had been signed.
In the new climate, the big three rocket builders suddenly got into
the buiness of selling satellite deliveries as a package deals:
rocket and launch for one price, discounts available for two or
more.
   ``There has been a resurgence in this industry,'' said Fred
Bettinger of General Dynamics, which makes Atlas-Centaur and Atlas
2 rockets. General Dynamics has 18 Atlas-Centaurs on its assembly
line _ although only four are sold for $50 million to $60 million
each; it has orders for 11 Atlas 2s through 1997 for $856 million.
   McDonnell Douglas has a major share of the Air Force ELV
buildup. The Air Force has ordered 14 Delta 2s for $493.8 million
and has options for six more for a total $690 million. In addition,
said McDonnell Douglas' Tom Williams, the company began to market
the Deltas commercially and has seven orders through 1991.
   ``Two years ago we were going out of business in the area of
ELVs,'' Williams said. ``That was before the Reagan administration
revived the ELV business.
   ``During that vacuum when Challenger crashed and before our ELV
business was resurrected, Arianespace cleaned up, securing many
contracts. The balance has been redressed especially this year. We
landed four contracts in 1987 and three this year.''
   Among McDonnell Douglas commercial customers are British
Satellite Broadcast Limited, the governments of India and
Indonesia, NATO and two for Inmarsat.
   Martin Marietta has contracts for $5.5 billion worth of its
Titan rockets and their launches _ three different launch vehicles
for Air Force and commercial customers.
   ``What really gave us the impetus to start our commercial Titan
business was the presidential decision to take commercial payloads
off the shuttle,'' said Judy Herb, a Martin Marietta spokeswoman in
Denver. ``We announced within days of that that we had formed the
Commercial Titan Co.''
   The firm is marketing a version of the Titan 3 _ an Air Force
standby since the 1960s _ as the Commercial Titan, and has sold
four at $100 million to $125 million each for launches through
early 1990. It also has an agreement with General Electric to
launch up to 15 satellites over a number of years, all on the
Commercial Titan.
   The Titan 2, a refurbished Intercontinental Ballistics Missile
was launched for the first time this month (September) and there
are 13 more on order for $638.7 million.
   The newest and biggest of the line, the Titan 4, is on a pad at
the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida for launch in
October. It has the greatest lift capacity of any American rocket,
being able to put a 10,000-pound satellite into orbit 22,300 miles
above Earth.
   Twenty-two more Titan 4s are on order, bringing the price tag to
$4.2 billion through 1993 and the Air Force has just announced its
intention to buy 20 more of the behemoths.
   An irony is that NASA, which fought ELVs so long as a threat to
the manned space flight program, now is standing in line to buy
them from the Air Force.
   In 1984, Aldridge called an ELV capacity ``a modest hedge
against unanticipated and unforeseen shuttle problems which might
cause fleet groundings or outages.'' In 1988 NASA tends to agree.

<TEXT>
   Air Force Col. Richard Covey
expects to be flooded with memories of the Challenger astronauts
when he climbs aboard Discovery for the first shuttle launch in
more than 2{ years.
   ``I'm sure as I crawl in, I'll think about the crew crawling
into the orbiter and strapping in and sitting on the launch pad _
what they were thinking, what they were doing,'' said the veteran
astronaut who was picked to pilot Discovery.
   Covey, a former Air Force fighter and test pilot, also guided
Discovery three years ago on a mission billed by NASA as its most
successful flight yet. He said he is confident the upcoming mission
also will be a success but realizes his family is concerned because
of what happened to Challenger.
   ``It would be strange for them not to be. The last time anybody
saw a space shuttle come off the launch pad it blew up,'' Covey
said. ``You don't forget about it.''
   And the 42-year-old Covey said he too will reflect on the
Challenger astronauts.
   ``I'll also be knowing that they would be pleased that we have
gotten back to the point where we are going to fly again.''
   His wife, Kathleen, a real estate agent, and daughters Sarah,
14, and Amy, 12 will attend the launch.
   Coping with the risks of space flight at the Covey household
doesn't involve a lot of talk about it, he said.
   ``They understand that I do these types of things because I want
to do them and that's what makes me the type of person that I am
and they don't really question that.''
   Recently, the five Discovery astronauts talked to dozens of
reporters at the Johnson Space Center for their final news
conference before the flight. But Covey said the ``big'' event that
day was a volleyball game, the season opener for his daughter's
team. They won.
   ``I was there, I made it,'' he added, smiling.
   Covey was born in Fayetteville, Ark., and grew up in Fort Walton
Beach, Fla. His late father was an Air Force lieutenant colonel.
   He earned a bachelor's degree from the U.S. Air Force Academy in
1968 and a master's in aeronautics and astronautics from Purdue
University a year later.
   While in the Air Force, Covey flew 339 combat missions during
two tours in southeast Asia. He has flown more than 4,000 hours in
more than 25 different types of aircraft.
   He was selected as an astronaut candidate in 1978. During his
other shuttle mission, the crew deployed three communications
satellites and repaired an ailing satellite.
   ``I fully intend to stay around and fly as a commander if I get
that opportunity,'' Covey said.
   Although there will be plenty of work to do on the flight, the
astronauts also get a chance to relax.
   ``There's a lot of time for looking out the window,'' he said.
``I just look out a lot (at Earth). That's where the real scenery
is.''

<HEAD>Astronaut Dave Hilmers Says Space Flight Rewards Outweigh Risks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURA TOLLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Marine Lt. Col. Dave Hilmers says
the Challenger disaster made him realize the importance of
explaining to his family how he feels about being an astronaut
before he flew into space again.
   ``This is a dangerous world that we live in and I think that
everyone should be ready to tell the people that they love how they
feel and what they believe is important,'' said the former jet
pilot, who will help deploy a $100 million communications satellite
on the Discovery mission.
   ``Where your faith lies, what your beliefs are, what you want
them to accomplish in life _ all these sorts of things.''
   Hilmers said the rewards of being an astronaut outweigh any
risks involved and he feels privileged to be flying on the first
post-Challenger mission. But he acknowledged with a smile that his
wife, Lynn, sometimes may wish he had picked a different profession.
   Hilmers, 38, has two sons, Matthew, who will be 12 on Sept. 28,
and Daniel, 9.
   Hilmers grew up in DeWitt, Iowa, and graduated with a bachelor's
degree in mathematics, summa cum laude, from Cornell College in
1972. He earned a master's degree in electrical engineering in 1977
and the degree of electrical engineer from the U.S. Naval
Postgraduate School in 1978.
   Two years later, he was selected as an astronaut.
   His only other shuttle mission, launched in October 1985, was
the maiden voyage of the orbiter Atlantis. Hilmers was a mission
specialist on that flight, a classified Department of Defense
mission.
   He often jogs with his fellow Discovery crew members along the
backroads at the Johnson Space Center. Discovery Pilot Dick Covey
said Hilmers generally runs the most, about four miles.
   When he was asked to be part of the Discovery crew, Hilmers said
he felt no reluctance to accept.
   ``There was a big lump in my throat. When I was chosen, there
really was just a real sense of privilege,'' he said.
   Hilmers will take several Bible verses written on ribbons into
space for friends who have supported him with prayers, he said.
He'll also take several flags, including one from Texas.
   Like the other astronauts, Hilmers said the liftoff generally is
the most tense time of the mission.
   ``It's a very awesome two minutes,'' he said.
   When he first flew, he said he was so ``overcome by the physical
sensations'' that he didn't get much of a chance to think. This
time, he believes he will be concentrating more on his job.
   But he's sure he will think about Challenger, which exploded 73
seconds after takeoff.
   ``We're going to be remembering what happened back then. We're
going to be remembering the crew, our friends. We're going to
remember that something did happen in the first two minutes and
hopefully it's not going to happen again. But I don't think we're
going to be dwelling on that,'' he said.
   ``I think that when it gets right down to the last couple of
minutes, that we're going to be looking up at the sky and not
behind us.''

<TEXT>
   When astronaut Mike Lounge soars
into orbit aboard Discovery, he will carry a symbol of a bygone era
of transportation _ a picture of a wagon wheel.
   The wheel is displayed on a banner honoring the centennial of
his hometown of Burlington, Colo. It contains the signatures of
about 4,000 people, has a picture of a wagon wheel with a shuttle
orbiting it and says ``100 years of pioneers.''
   Lounge, who made his first shuttle flight three years ago aboard
Discovery, also will carry his wife's wedding ring, pins and
drawings and several cassettes of music on the shuttle, including a
``rap'' tape a teen-age friend made for him.
   The memory of the Challenger tragedy will add to the anxiety
astronauts always feel during the first few moments after launch,
Lounge said.
   ``I think the first 10 minutes of flight are always the ones
you're most tense because you're converting so much potential
energy in those solid rocket boosters into kinetic energy as you
get up above the atmosphere,'' he said in an interview. ``Once we
get off the solids, and the three main engines are running smoothly
and it gets real quiet, my heartbeat will probably go down quite a
bit.''
   Tanned and relaxed, the former Navy aviator is the lead
astronaut in charge of deploying the $100 million communications
satellite.
   His other flight, which launched Aug. 27, 1985, is described by
NASA as its most successful shuttle mission so far, with astronauts
deploying three satellites and repairing an ailing satellite.
   Lounge said there hasn't been much tension at home about the
upcoming mission. His wife, Kathryn Anne, is an engineer at the
Johnson Space Center and she understands ``the challenges as well
as I do.'' His family, including his children Shannon, 17, Kenneth,
7, and Kathy, 4, plan to be there for the liftoff.
   ``To my two little children who live at home, it hasn't become
real to them yet. We talk about going to Florida and (how) they get
to go watch Daddy launch and they get to go to Disney World and I'm
not sure which is the more important of the two.''
   But, seriously, Lounge said his children do understand what he
does.
   ``A couple of times my 4-year-old has talked about how `you're
going to go fly in the space shuttle, but it's not going to blow up
_ right?' So, she's remembering that image of Challenger,'' he said.
   ``But it's not like a cloud of anxiety that's following her
around. She wanted some reassurance and I reassured her and that
was OK because Daddy knows everything,'' he said, smiling.
   Lounge, a member of the Texas Air National Guard who flies with
his unit at least once a week, said he doesn't think much about the
risks and dangers.
   ``But it's characteristic of people that get into this kind of
profession _ that we're all bullet-proof. You can shoot at me but
you can't hit me, it might hit someone else but it won't hit me,''
he said.

<DATELINE>PALERMO, Sicily (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Swimming children giggle, a breeze stirs
the eucalyptus, and Paolo Borsellino tries to forget the murder and
corruption that are the focus of his daily work.
   But a gloom that has enveloped Italy's war against the Mafia
follows the graying magistrate like a cloud, even as he relaxes
outside his beachfront vacation home.
   ``A certain weariness has overcome Palermo,'' he says, staring
broodingly at the purple Sicilian hills. ``Today the commitment to
fight the Mafia isn't as strong as before.''
   Government and police officials in the Sicilian capital express
similar feelings. They speak of blocked investigations, of
political indifference, of threats to those who take on the mob.
   The problem has grown so serious that Italy's president,
Francesco Cossiga, recently demanded an inquiry into investigations
in Palermo, headquarters of the Mafia and its multibillion-dollar
drug trade.
   Shortly thereafter, Giovanni Falcone, Italy's top Mafia
investigator, submitted his resignation, saying working conditions
were impossible. He withdrew the resignation last week, but his act
in the beginning had a demoralizing impact.
   While some blame weariness for the investigative problems,
others see the corrupting hand of the Mafia.
   ``Today, in these months, there is a new effort by the dark
force to reappropriate the city,'' declares the Rev. Ennio
Pintacuda, a Jesuit priest who advises the Palermo government.
   The case has alarmed the national government, which has
appointed a new Mafia commissioner. It also has raised concern at
the U.S. Justice Department, which conducts joint investigations of
the Mafia with Italian officials.
   At the center of the crisis are a group of investigating
magistrates, who in the Italian legal system draw up indictments,
using police and judicial methods. They often work alone.
   Falcone, Borsellino and his colleagues instead formed a pool so
that the Mafia could not, as in the past, kill off a case by
killing off an investigator.
   In the five years since, the magistrates' intensive teamwork has
paid off with evidence not only about the Mafia's local operation,
but its business in Europe and the United States as well.
   It culminated in 338 convictions this past December in the
``maxi-trial'' of Mafia members accused of murder, robbery and drug
trafficking to the U.S. East Coast.
   It also contributed to the 18 convictions in the ``Pizza
Connection'' trial of heroin suppliers who used American pizza
parlors as fronts.
   But since January, when Italy's Superior Council of Magistrates
chose 68-year-old Judge Antonino Meli to head the ``anti-Mafia
pool,'' a split has developed in the unit. The Council passed over
the 49-year-old Falcone, ruling he was too young.
   ``A few months after Meli took over, the system was changed
completely,'' says Borsellino, who left the team last year.
   The new director began sending Mafia cases to judges outside the
pool, and assigning non-Mafia cases to pool members, he says.
   ``We are returning to the system of the '60s, in which each
judge did his job and no one knew what anyone else was doing _ and
no one had a global view of the Mafia,'' asserts Borsellino.
   He complained publicly in July and the Italian president ordered
an investigation. A week later, Falcone resigned and his pool
colleagues threatened to follow.
   ``We feel we are in danger of losing a way of coordination in
the fight against the Mafia that brought optimal results,'' says
pool member Gioacchino Natoli.
   Meli's office said he would not comment on the accusations. In
his few public remarks, he has said he spread cases among different
judges to increase the level of experience.
   The other magistrates say Meli, with little experience in Mafia
investigations, does not realize the importance of specialization.
   Other people insist the problem is political influence.
   ``It could be that instead of direct pressure, it's an
environment created by that part of the city that says the Mafia is
not a danger,'' says Pintacuda. ``In that group are also
politicians.''
   On Sept. 14, the Superior Council of Magistrates concluded that
no one had tried to remove the pool from Mafia cases. But it also
endorsed the pool's working methods.
   Even if the magistrates remain, the split in the judiciary has
hurt.
   Tommaso Buscetta, a key Mafia informer, said he would not make
further disclosures while the judges were divided. Important
investigations have languished, according to U.S. officials.
   In Natoli's office, next to a window with double rows of
bulletproof glass, hang plaques from the FBI, the U.S. Drug
Enforcement Administration and the New York City Police Department.
   ``When all the institutions have worked together, we have had
splendid results,'' says the 41-year-old Natoli.
   The judges' difficulties, he adds, have been exacerbated by a
decline in support from such institutions as the police and
parliament in Rome.
   It was parliament that provided the key to many past successes
against the Mafia. In 1982, it established a new crime, that of
Mafia association, and allowed inspection of suspects' bank records.
   But there has been no movement on judges' requests for a witness
protection program or a provision to reduce informers' sentences.
   ``There have been moments in which it has appeared the state
would resolve the problem,'' Natoli says, fingering his gold-framed
glasses. ``Later it is always set aside.''
   More problematic, he adds, has been the police situation. The
detective unit that formerly handled Mafia investigations has been
destroyed by two Mafia assassinations and the arrests of several
officers in the death of one of the suspected assassins.
   One of the last members of the unit, Francesco Accordino, was
recently transferred after receiving death threats reportedly
traced to a police telephone.
   The threats to Italy's war on organized crime have come just as
the ``anti-Mafia pool'' was beginning to focus on politicians'
links to the Mafia. Some say the timing is no coincidence.
   ``When judges limit themselves to trying (Mafia chief Michele)
Greco, fine,'' says Carmine Mancuso, a police inspector who also
heads a citizen's group to rally popular support against the Mafia.
``The problem begins when Falcone and the others begin to talk
about political investigations.''
   The wail of sirens has increased this summer in Palermo.
Magistrates and government officials speed past in police
motorcades. Authorities recently increased security for those
active in the war on the Mafia, even assigning bodyguards to two
priests.
   At Borsellino's house a bodyguard in sunglasses and a pink,
open-necked shirt relaxes on a lounge chair, his large black pistol
hidden in a folded newspaper.
   ``Society has paid a terribly high price for the war on the
Mafia,'' Borsellino says. ``This has created a climate of
weariness.''
   Mayor Leoluca Orlando of Palermo says the public hasn't lost
heart. And he notes the government has responded to the crisis by
naming a prominent anti-terrorism investigator, Domenico Sica, as
the Mafia commissioner and increasing his investigative powers.
   ``The state made a strong effort during the maxi-trial,''
Orlando says. ``The message was clear. We must recover that clarity
to move forward.''

<BYLINE>For The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>

   Ford F-series trucks are everywhere on America's
roads.
   They take Johnny to school and take dad to his landscape
business. They haul garbage to the dump and tow horse trailers to
weekend horse shows. They are workhorses that America has come to
love.
   For 11 years, the F-series trucks have been the best-selling
trucks in the United States. They have outsold any car nameplate
for the last six years and the trucks' popularity is expected to
continue into 1989, with few major changes planned for the new
model year beginning in early October.
   The test truck, a two-wheel-drive 1988 F-150 styleside pickup,
seemed to need few changes. It was sturdy and spacious. The
interior was neat in appearance, with needle gauges that were easy
to read and a large center armrest that folded down. There was room
to store some items behind the bench seat, and the seat folded
forward for easier access back there.
   Like all trucks, the F-150 offered a high perch to view traffic,
and visibility was good in all directions. The truck was relatively
easy to handle, even park, as long as the driver kept in mind the
98.3-inch truckbed in back.
   There was little body sway around corners, thanks in part to the
handling package option that included front and rear stabilizer
bars. However, the ride could be a bit bouncy on rough terrain and
in some road conditions. Seat belts were needed to keep everyone in
place on the seat at those times. In addition, the bench seat did
not offer the adjustability and comfort of many car seats.
   The engine, a 5.8-liter, electronic fuel-injected V-8 teamed
with automatic transmission, was powerful and performed rather
smoothly. But it really sipped the fuel, making me glad to have the
optional second fuel tank that could be tapped with a flip of a
switch on the dashboard. The government mileage rating for the
truck was a mere 12 miles per gallon in the city, 14 mpg on the
highway.
   Brakes performed well, with anti-lock brakes in the rear. The
truckbed was easy to climb into and out of, especially because of
the optional step-up bumper in back. The tailgate folded down with
ease, though it was a bit heavy.
   That's not likely to bother the typical F-series buyer, however.
Ford said 95 percent are men, with median age of about 45.
   Eighty percent are married, and 40 percent have some college
education. Median annual income is $39,000, and 27 percent have
white-collar jobs, the automaker said.
   Buyers use the trucks for both personal and business use, with
Ford truck manager Beryl Stajich saying the ``biggest single use is
back and forth to work.''
   In fact, trucks overall have become so much a part of American
life that industry statistics show that while only one truck was
sold for every 10 cars in 1966, today one truck is sold for every
two cars.
   F-series competitors include the Chevrolet C-K pickups and the
Dodge full-size pickup trucks. Two-wheel-drive versions of all
those models, with at least 116-inch wheelbase, have starting
prices ranging from $7,700 to $9,600. But prices can get up over
$11,000 with additions for towing, handling and comfort features.
   In style and function, the Ford, Chevy and Dodge trucks all seem
pretty similar. Another similarity is the fact that all truck
buyers _ no matter what model they get _ rank durability as a prime
concern, auto analysts say.
   Consumer Reports said Ford two-wheel-drive V-8 pickups for the
1981-83 model years ranked average in owners reporting troubles.
For the 1984-86 model years, the ranking fell to ``worse than
average,'' but the current F-series trucks were redesigned for
1987, and there was no Consumer Reports ranking for the later
models.
   Ford offers a wide selection of powertrains and body styles to
fit buyers' needs. Towing capacities range from 2,100 pounds to
12,500 pounds, for example.
   Ford has a large number of repeat buyers, Stajich said. A 1987
study showed 47 percent of buyers had been previous Ford owners,
compared with 36 percent for Chevy, he said.
   That loyalty, plus the fact that trucks traditionally are kept
longer than cars are (13 years before scrappage vs. 10 years for
cars), and a growing U.S. truck market help account for the volumes
of Ford trucks on America's roads.
   The trend is likely to continue, considering that by mid-year
the F-series continued to hold down the top-selling spot in the
industry, with sales of more than 312,800. The Chevy C-K trucks
were second, followed by the Chevrolet Corsica-Beretta cars.

   An improving trade deficit helped economic
growth remain strong in the second quarter despite the Farm Belt
drought, but inflation was more severe than previously believed,
the government says.
   The Commerce Department said Tuesday the gross national product
grew at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.0 percent in the
April-June period, compared to the earlier estimate of 3.3 percent.
   The GNP deflator, which measures inflation, rose at an annual
rate of 5.5 percent, instead of 5.1 percent as previously estimated.

years, the government announced.
   The Commerce Department said Tuesday that after-tax profits in
April, May and June jumped to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of
$162.7 billion.
   Tuesday's report represents a downward revision from an estimate
of 11.5 percent. Still, it was the sharpest rise since an 11.4
percent gain in the third quarter of 1983.

   OPEC-related news has been put aside as the oil
futures market anticipates lower oil inventories stemming from last
week's hurricane-related disruptions.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the October contract for
West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude, settled
31 cents higher at $15.04 a barrel Tuesday. Other contract months
closed lower.
   Wholesale unleaded gasoline for October delivery gained 0.19
cent to close at 44.43 cents a gallon, while other contract months
closed higher.
   The October wholesale heating oil contract lost 0.04 cent to
settle at 41.32 cents a gallon. Other heating oil contracts settled
mixed on the day.
   Analysts said Tuesday's late rally was led by last-minute
trading in advance of the October contract's expiration at the
close of the trading day, coupled with expectations that the
American Petroleum Institute's weekly statistics would show a
substantial drop in oil and gasoline stocks.
   The API report, released after the close of trading, indicated
U.S. crude oil stocks fell by 6.212 million barrels in the week
ended Sept. 16, while gasoline stocks fell by 2.58 million barrels.
   Last week's hurricane threat in the Gulf of Mexico closed
refineries and disrupted oil and gasoline production for several
days. Traders said the market was poised Tuesday for an API report
reflecting a larger-than-expected drop in inventories.
   Bud Degorgue, an oil broker with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.,
said there were market rumors speculating crude oil inventories
could be down by as much as 16 million barrels because of last
week's hurricane, although analysts did not expect stocks to be off
by more than 5 million to 6 million barrels.
   OPEC-related news was pushed to the back burner until after the
API report, traders said. Oil futures prices have fluctuated wildly
in recent weeks in anticipation of an Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries price committee meeting scheduled for next
Monday and Tuesday.
   The market has had mixed response to whether such a meeting
could lead to a gathering of all 13 OPEC members at a later date
and possible curtailment of the cartel's oil output.

<HEAD>Cement Giant Rejects $1.47 Billion Cash Offer From Mystery
Investors</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lafarge Corp.'s French parent says it has no
interest in talking with the would-be buyers of the North American
cement maker, who have offered $1.47 billion cash.
   The offer came Tuesday from a group of private anonymous
investors and was made through a New York law firm, Adler Hindy
Turner & Glasser. Lawrence Orbe, the attorney handling the matter,
said his clients were willing to pay $30 a share in cash for
Lafarge, which has about 49 million shares outstanding.
   Orbe said the investors owned less than 5 percent of Lafarge's
outstanding shars, which means they do not have to make an
extensive disclosure filing about themselves and their intentions
to the Securities and Exchange Commission.
   He would not provide further details about the clients but said
their offer was contingent upon obtaining federal antitrust
clearance, sufficient financing and no opposition from the board of
Lafarge Coppee, the Paris-based cement producer that owns a 58
percent interest in the company.
   Orbe said his clients had met with two major investment banks to
talk about financing but would not identify them.
   ``For now, the feeling is we want to meet with the parent
company to disclose the backgrounds of the principals,'' Orbe said.
``That's the most appropriate way.''
   It was the second time this month that the group had approached
Lafarge Coppee about selling the company. The earlier offer, also
for $30 share, was only for the French parent's controlling
interest.
   Lafarge Coppee issued a brief statement through the U.S.
subsidiary's office in Reston, Va., reiterating its rejection of
the takeover overture and questioning its authenticity.
   The statement called the latest offer ``yet another unsolicited
letter to Lafarge Coppee from an attorney who purportedly
represents an unidentified group of Lafarge Corp. stockholders.''
   It concluded: ``Lafarge Coppee confirms that it has no interest
in selling its holdings in Lafarge Corp. and does not intend to
pursue any discussions relating thereto.''
   Wall Street reacted skeptically to the takeover proposal.
Lafarge stock rose only $1.87 a share to $19.87{, well below the
$30 offering price.
   Securities analysts knowledgeable about Lafarge also expressed
doubts about the offer. Robert G. Maloney, who follows the company
for Wood Gundy Ltd. in New York, said ``it doesn't sound like the
way you'd start if you're serious.''
   Maloney said he strongly doubted the French parent, in the
cement business for 100 years, would seriously consider selling its
North American operations, which have been moving aggessively to
improve efficiency and profitability.
   ``I don't think you need to take this offer seriously at all,''
said another securities analyst, who spoke on condition he not be
identified. ``The company has spent this cycle cleaning itself up.
Why the heck would they want to sell unless somebody pays through
the teeth for it?''
   Lafarge Corp. was formed in 1983 as the parent to Canadian
Cement Lafarge Ltd. and General Portland Inc. It is one of the
continent's leading cement producers, with more than 6,000
employees and with factories in Texas, Florida, Ohio, Kansas,
Pennsylvania, Alabama, Michigan and throughout Canada.
   The company's earnings have come from its Canadian business in
the past few years, largely because of the depressed economy in the
oil-patch states.

<HEAD>Retailers Bullish on Economy for Holiday Season</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Business executives expect profits to rise
during the final three months of this year, while retailers in
particular expect higher sales and prices during the crucial
holiday selling season, according to a private survey.
   Dun & Bradstreet Corp., a leading marketer of business
information, said its quarterly survey of 1,500 executives found
that although expectations had moderated along with signs of a
slowing economy, business executives were painting the rosiest
profit picture since 1984.
   ``Retailers are headed into the fourth quarter with high
expectations for the holiday sales season,'' said Joseph W. Duncan,
corporate economist and chief statistician for Dun & Bradstreet.
   ``At the same time, the outlook among durable manufacturers
remains strong, so we should close out the year on an economic high
note.''
   However, the survey indicated manufacturers and wholesalers were
less optimistic about the economy than retailers, as sustained
consumer demand and increased exports have pushed the manufacturing
sector to full capacity.
   The survey was conducted during the final half of August.
   Overall, the report said Dun & Bradstreet's sales optimism index
fell slightly for the fourth quarter, to 70 from 73 in the third
quarter. But among retailers, the index rose to 72 from 65.
   The index is calculated by subtracting the percentage of
respondents expecting decreases in a category from the percentage
expecting increases.
   An index measuring expectations for increased profits rose to
67, the highest level since the fourth quarter of 1984, and up from
63 last quarter. Retailers were the most optimistic, with a
10-point increase from the third quarter to 69. The index among
wholesalers slipped to 63 from 64 and among manufacturers to 68
from 70.
   While the overall index of expectations for higher prices fell
to 42 from 44, retailers are forecasting prices will climb during
the year's final quarter, with their index rising from 39 to 45,
the report said.
   In the category for employment prospects, the index decreased to
22 from 25. The retail sector index rose one point to 14 while
wholesaler and manufacturer indexes declined.

<TEXT>
   The head of Shamrock Holdings Inc. says
the company will continue its unwanted bid for Polaroid Corp.,
despite Polaroid's rejection of a sweetened $2.6 billion offer and
proposal for a defensive stock issue.
   Polaroid's board of directors on Tuesday rejected Shamrock's $42
a share offer as inadequate and urged shareholders not to tender
their stock.
   The instant photography company also indicated in a filing with
the Securities and Exchange Commission that it had begun
preliminary negotiations regarding a possible issuance of preferred
stock to third parties, a defensive move that would make a takeover
more difficult.
   In a letter to Polaroid's directors Tuesday, Shamrock President
Stanley P. Gold said he was disappointed with the rejection, which
marked the second time Polaroid has turned down an offer from
Shamrock, a Burbank, Calif.-based radio and television concern.
Gold also reiterated Shamrock's willingness to raise its offer
further if it believed an increase was warranted.
   ``We believe that your continued unwillingness to meet with us
is contrary to the best interests of Polaroid's stockholders,''
Gold wrote.
   He also claimed Polaroid's stock proposal was intended simply to
impede the Shamrock offer.
   ``We will therefore make every effort to stop any such placement
and will hold Polaroid directors and management and the purchaser
of any such securities responsible for participating in what we
percieve is an unlawful scheme. Furthermore, any such placement
will not achieve its purpose since it will not divert us from our
efforts to acquire Polaroid,'' Gold said.
   Polaroid stock fell $1.12{ a share to close at $40.12{ in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading.
   ``It's a very good defensive move,'' Alex Henderson, a
photography analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities in New York,
said of the stock plan.
   ``The question now is, what is the next step?'' he said. ``The
ball's in Shamrock's court now.''
   Polaroid last month rejected an unsolicited offer from Shamrock
that would have paid stockholders $40 a share plus 40 percent of
the eventual award in Polaroid's $5.7 billion patent infringement
lawsuit against Eastman Kodak Co. Analysts valued the offer at
about $44 a share, assuming a $1 billion settlement in the Kodak
case.
   Shamrock, which is owned by the family of Roy E. Disney, nephew
of the late animator Walt Disney, has indicated that if its bid
succeeded it would drop Polaroid's fledgling venture into 35mm
film, sell most of the company's undeveloped real estate, narrow
the company's manufacturing facilities and simplify Polaroid's
research and development to focus on core businesses.
   Shamrock's offer was contingent on the invalidation of
Polaroid's recent issuance of 9.7 million shares to a new employee
stock ownership plan, a move Polaroid made early in its attempt to
block Shamrock.
   The hostile bid values the company at $2.6 billion, based on the
62 million shares that would be outstanding if the issue of 9.7
million shares is rolled back.
   In a statement, I. MacAllister Booth, Polaroid president and
chief executive officer, said the board was advised by its
financial adviser, Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., that the latest
offer from Shamrock was inadequate.
   Booth said Polaroid's own plan to restructure the company, which
includes massive job cuts, would benefit stockholders more.
   ``The foundation of our plan is a carefully targeted
reorganization and streamlining of operations to focus more sharply
on key growth areas,'' Booth said. ``This will result in a
strengthening of the company's competitive posture, improved future
operating prospects for the company and a 15 percent reduction in
the number of Polaroid employees in the United States.''
   Booth said Polaroid will save about $100 million a year as a
result of its restructuring.
   Shamrock has filed suit in Delaware, where Polaroid is
incorporated, to block the employee stock ownership plan. A trial
has been set for next month.

   A company that keeps tabs on the aircraft
industry reports jet aircraft orders are booming as commercial
airlines worldwide modernize their fleets with more fuel-efficient
aircraft.
   The company, Forecast International, says more than 3,400
aircraft worth $114 billion are either on order or on option to
order, most to be delivered over the next six years.
   In 15 years of tracking aircraft developments, ``I've never,
never seen a replacement cycle like this,'' said company President
Edward M. Nebinger.
   He said Tuesday airlines are ordering new planes because they
can save 20 to 25 percent on fuel costs with newer models, with
fuel being an airline company's largest operational expense.
   Nebinger also said the industry had weathered an era of
cutthroat competition, prompted partly by the deregulation of the
industry a decade ago, that has seen less-efficient carriers fold
amid a series of mergers and consolidations.
   ``The survivors are economically stronger,'' he said.
   Newer models also reduce the risk of metal fatigue, which
literally can cause a plane to fall apart.
   Nebinger recalled this year's Aloha Airlines incident, when the
entire front section of the cabin roof flew off in flight, due to
fatigue cracks. That plane had made 90,000 takeoffs and landings,
he said.
   The Aloha Airlines incident and the recent crash of a
1973-vintage Boeing 727 jet in Dallas renewed questions about the
reliability of aging aircraft, Nebinger said.
   His figures indicate the average age of a Boeing 707 is 20.3
years, while the average age of a Boeing 727 is 15.4 years. The
average age of a McDonnell Douglas DC-8 is 21.4 years and the
average age of a DC-10 is 12 years.
   Forecast International maintains computer data on aircraft
inventories worldwide.
   Nebinger said jet planes are the last major items that the
United States exports and his data provide encouraging news as the
United States attempts to trim its trade deficit.
   U.S. manufacturers are expected to deliver 1,738 new aircraft,
worth about $72.5 billion, through 1994. Of that, $25.4 billion is
destined for American airline companies, while the remaining $47.1
billion will go to foreign customers, Nebinger said.
   But he also said European companies, specifically Airbus
Industrie, are taking an ever-increasing bite of the market away
from U.S. giants like Boeing and McDonnell Douglas, which 15 years
ago claimed virtually the entire world market.
   He said Airbus Industrie was expected to deliver 852 aircraft
through 1995, while other European producers will deliver about
575. Much of those will go to countries other than the United
States, but about $12.8 billion will go to U.S. operators, he said.
   On balance, Nebinger said, ``the U.S. still emerges as a very
strong winner in the import-export balance, with exports to Europe
exceeding imports by $13.2 billion.''
   The impact on the U.S. trade deficit, he said, ``cannot be
overemphasized.''
   Boeing has 1,275 aircraft either on order or option to order.
McDonnell Douglas has 349. Airbus Industrie has 852, while Fokker,
based in the Netherlands, has 257, and Embraer of Brazil has 208,
according to Nebinger's numbers.
   To support the orders his company has tracked, new engines
needed through 1994 will be worth $24.7 billion, Nebinger said, of
which U.S. manufacturers will produce $15.6 billion, or 63 percent.

<HEAD>Kohlberg Kravis Bids For Kroger</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. is marching into
a takeover battle again against Dart Group Corp., offering $4.6
billion to acquire Kroger Co. in a rival bid that tops Dart's
latest offer for the giant supermarket.
   Kohlberg Kravis, the New York investment firm that has outbid
Dart for three other corporations in recent years, offered to pay
$58.50 a share in cash and securities for Kroger in a buyout aimed
at keeping the company's present management at the helm.
   Kroger, which refused to meet with Kohlberg, indicated it would
review the offer but also would continue pursuing its own proposed
restructuring plan.
   Kroger stock soared after the Kohlberg Kravis announcement,
closing at $56.25 a share, up $3.50 from Monday in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading.
   Kohlberg Kravis offered to pay Kroger shareholders $50 in cash
and securities valued at $8.50 for each share they own.
   Dart, the Landover, Md.-based retailing company headed by the
Haft family, has offered to pay $55 a share _ $43 cash and
securities valued at $12 _ for each of Kroger's 78.6 million
outstanding shares, or about $4.32 billion.
   Kohlberg Kravis, in a letter sent to Kroger Chairman Lyle
Everingham, said its takeover plan would leave Kroger's
headquarters in Cincinnati and its current management in place.
   The firm specializes in leveraged buyouts, in which a company is
acquired mainly with borrowed funds that are repaid with cash
raised by the target company's cash flow or from the sale of its
assets.
   Kroger's restructuring plan, valued at between $4.2 billion and
$4.6 billion, was announced after learning that Hafts had received
federal clearance to buy at least $15 million in Kroger stock.
   The plan would pay $40 a share in cash, plus securities valued
at $8 and a remaining publicly traded stock worth between $5 and
$10.
   Analysts earlier suggested that Kroger might turn to Kohlberg
Kravis as a so-called ``white knight.'' Kohlberg Kravis won a
hostile takeover battle for Beatrice Cos. in 1985, in which the
Hafts were a bidder, and outbid the Hafts for Safeway Stores in
1986 and Stop & Shop Cos. earlier this year.
   Kohlberg Kravis apparently offered to act as a white knight but
was rebuffed by Kroger management. The firm, in its letter,
revealed that its request to discuss a buyout offer in a
face-to-face meeting with Kroger advisers was turned down.
   ``The entry of the Kohlbergs brings a whole new level of
seriousness to this,'' said Gary Giblen, a vice president with
Rotan Mosle Inc. in Houston.
   Linda Morris, analyst with Provident National Bank in
Pittsburgh, said shareholders may lean toward the KKR proposal
because it offers more cash.
   Furthermore, because the Hafts have a reputation for pushing
companies into takeover battles and then making a big profit by
selling their stock on those companies, there was uncertainty over
whether Dart would pursue a costly takeover fight.
   Morris called the KKR package ``a fair offer'' and said Kroger
would be hard pressed to top it, even if it joined up with another
buyout firm.
   Morris speculated that Kohlberg Kravis was drawn to the deal
partially because it wants to spend some of its considerable funds
before the White House changes guard in November.
   ``They are sitting on an attractive war chest,'' she said,
adding that the federal government's attitude toward takeover
activity could change once a new administration is elected.
   In addition to bidding for Kroger, Kohlberg Kravis is engaged in
a bidding war for publishing giant Macmillan. Macmillan has agreed
to a $2.36 billion buyout led by KKR, but British publisher Robert
Maxwell has made a competing $2.41 billion offer.

<HEAD>Interco Rejects Revised Takeover Offer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Interco Inc. says it will sell its Ethan Allen
furniture subsidiary as part of a major restructuring program aimed
at stopping a $2.66 billion hostile takeover from a Washington,
D.C., investment group.
   Interco, a major maker of furniture and apparel, said Tuesday
that its board of directors rejected as inadequate a revised
$72-a-share bid from Cardinal Acquisition Corp., headed by the
brothers Steven and Mitchell Rales of Washington.
   The board instead approved a previously announced restructuring.
It includes paying a special dividend of $25 per share to
shareholders on Nov. 7 and selling the Ethan Allen unit.
   Interco suspended the regular quarterly dividend pending
completion of the restructuring program, which it valued at $76 a
share.
   But Wall Street seemed unimpressed. In composite trading on the
New York Stock Exchange, Interco shares closed down $1.12{ to
$69.25 Tuesday.
   Interco said the board had been told by its financial adviser,
Wasserstein, Perella and Co., that Cardinal Acquisition's latest
offer was inadequate to shareholders.
   ``Recognizing the bright prospects for Interco's leading
consumer brands, we believe it is not an opportune time to sell the
company,'' Interco Chairman Harvey Saligman said in a statement
Tuesday.
   Interco has rejected the Rales' overtures since they first
offered in July to acquire the company by paying $64 for each of
the 37 million shares outstanding. The Rales already own about 8.7
percent of Interco's shares.
   On Monday, the Rales made public a letter that had been sent to
Interco warning against an anti-takeover restructuring. The
response was to an Interco filing with the Securities and Exchange
Commission last week in which the company disclosed the possibility
of a defensive restructuring.
   Interco said in its filing that it had retained a group of
bankers to explore how to finance the restructuring.
   Selling Ethan Allen could make Interco, whose products also
include London Fog outerwear, Florsheim and Converse shoes and
Broyhill furniture, an unattractive acquisition target.
   Interco said that if Cardinal Acquisition was interested it
would be provided the same information on Ethan Allen under the
same terms and conditions as other potential buyers.
   The Rales had said in their letter that they wanted a chance to
bid on assets that Interco might put up for sale.
   ``In order to avoid any unfortunate consequences should you
decide to pursue asset sales, we expect to be consulted well in
advance so that we can evaluate the effect that any such sale would
have on our offer,'' the Rales' letter also said.
   The group did not elaborate on what the ``unfortunate
consequences'' might be, but presumably it was warning of legal
action or a shareholder proxy fight to block a restructuring plan
that would spoil its strategy.
   As part of the special dividend portion of its restructuring,
Interco said it plans to pay shareholders of record on Oct. 13 $14
in cash and $11 in securities.
   The board plans to announce additional distributions of cash,
securities or share repurchases ``as the company progresses with
its divestiture and cost savings program,'' Interco said.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Japanese life insurance company has bought a 20
percent stake in LaSalle Partners Ltd., one of the nation's largest
privately held corporate real-estate firms.
   Dai-Ichi Mutual Life Insurance Co., Japan's second-largest life
insurance concern, acquired its interest in the Chicago real estate
firm for an undisclosed amount of money, the Chicago Tribune
reported in today's editions.
   Officials at LaSalle Partners would neither confirm nor deny the
purchase agreement on Tuesday, but the Tribune quoted unidentified
real-estate sources as saying the deal was signed June 30.
   The transaction was believed to be only the second direct
Japanese investment in a Chicago real-estate brokerage and only the
third such investment in the United States, the Tribune said.
   Last year, Orient Leasing Co. Ltd. of Tokyo bought a 23.3
percent stake in Rubloff Inc., another Chicago commercial
real-estate firm, and in December 1986, Nomura Securities Corp.
acquired a 50 percent interest in Eastdil Realty Inc., of New York.
   Industry sources said the deal with Dai-Ichi would broaden
LaSalle's capital, enabling it to expand its corporate real
estate-service business, and provide the Chicago company with
direct access to Japanese investors.

<HEAD>Minorco Launches Takeover Bid For Consolidated Gold Fields</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Fixes spelling of `conglomerate' and `immediately' in lead.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A South African-controlled gold conglomerate today
offered to buy Consolidated Gold Fields PLC for about $4.9 billion
in Britain's largest-ever takeover attempt, but Consolidated
immediately rejected the bid.
   Consolidated said the cash-and-stock offer by Minorco SA, based
in Luxembourg and run by two South African mining companies, was
``lacking financial justification'' and ``devoid of commercial
logic.''
   ``The proposals announced show that Minorco will be forced to
begin dismembering Gold Fields both to help finance the bid and in
recognition of the regulatory and commercial problems associated
with South African control,'' Gold Fields Chairman Rudolph Agnew
said in a statement.
   The offer would be the largest takeover of a publicly held
British company, surpassing Nestle SA's $4.3 billion acquisiton of
confectioner Rowntree PLC earlier this year.
   Minorco, controlled by Anglo American Corp. of South Africa and
De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd., currently owns 29 percent of
Consolidated Gold Fields. On London's Stock Exchange, Gold Fields'
shares quickly shot above the takeover offer price to 14.08 pounds,
or $23.65 a share, up from Tuesday's closing price of 10.78 pounds,
or $18.11.
   Minorco said the bid fits in with its strategy to become a
worldwide natural resources group with direct operating control of
its activities. Gold Fields is one of the largest gold producers in
the world.
   The Gold Fields stake ``represents too large a proportion of
Minorco's assets to remain a passive investment,'' the company said.
   Minorco said that if successful, it would immediately begin
negotiations on the sale of Gold Field's 38 percent holding in Gold
Fields South Africa and would review Gold Field's 49.3 percent
stake in Newmont Mining Corp. of New York.
   Minorco's offer includes about $31.92 in cash and one new
Minorco share for every two Gold Fields shares it doesn't already
own.
   A successful bid by Minorco would result in an increase in the
number of its own outstanding shares by about 47 percent and
effectively reduce the combined holdings of the company's two major
shareholders to a minority stake.
   The companies issued a joint statement supporting Minorco's bid.

   The stock market edged upward today, bolstered
by some encouragement over the latest news on inflation.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 3.74 to 2,091.22 in
the first half hour of trading.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 6 to 5 in the overall tally
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 427 up, 354 down and
561 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 18.53 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Activity was curtailed somewhat by the absence of investors
observing the Jewish holiday Yom Kippur.
   The Labor Department reported this morning that the consumer
price index rose 0.4 percent in August, matching its July increase.
   The latest figure was in line with advance estimates on Wall
Street, and thus did not stir up much excitement.
   Still, brokers said there was some relief at the suggestion in
the data that inflation wasn't gathering much momentum.
   Among actively traded blue chips, American Express rose [ to
28|; General Electric added [ to 42~; International Business
Machines rose [ to 112~, and American Telephone & Telegraph was
unchanged at 26{.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
gained .17 to 152.61. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was down .35 at 298.28.
   On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 6.40 points to
2,087.48.
   Advancing issues outpaced declines by about 8 to 5 among issues
listed on the NYSE, with 866 up, 581 down and 504 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 142.22 million shares, against 135.77
million in the previous session.

<HEAD>Consumer Prices Up, Housing Construction Down</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Leads with 7 grafs to UPDATE with reports on personal income

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Consumer prices rose 0.4 percent in August due to higher costs
for food, shelter and gasoline, although inflation remained under
control, according to a government report released today.
   Meanwhile, the government also reported that housing
construction fell 3.3 percent last month and personal income rose a
modest 0.2 percent, the least in eight months. Consumer spending
rose a brisker 0.5 percent.
   In its Consumer Price Index for August, the Labor Department
said last month's increase was equivalent to an annual inflation
rate of 5.2 percent, the same as in July. Higher rents and gasoline
prices in large part replaced food as the sharpest spurs to higher
prices, the department said.
   Shelter costs, reflecting higher rates for hotel and motel
rooms, were up 0.6 percent, the steepest gain in seven months. Food
and beverage prices were up 0.5 percent last month while energy
prices jumped 0.9 percent.
   In its housing report, the Commerce Department said a steep drop
in apartment construction more than offset a modest gain in
single-family home building. The decline followed gains of 1.4
percent in July and 5.2 percent in June.
   As in June and July, personal income was held back by declines
in subsidy payments to farmers. In an apparent indication of the
drought's impact, farm income excluding subsidies fell $3.2 billion
in August.
   With spending rising faster than income, the personal savings
rate edged downward in August to 3.9 percent.
   The Commerce Department reported Tuesday that the gross national
product grew at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.0 percent in
the April-June period, slower than the 3.4 percent expansion rate
in the first quarter, but nonetheless brisk.
   If not for the summer drought, second-quarter growth would have
been a more robust 3.9 percent.
   The government's report also showed inflation picking up during
the second quarter. One price measure tied to the GNP rose at the
fastest pace in nearly six years and was more than triple the
first-quarter rate.
   The GNP deflator, which reflects changes in buying patterns as
well as prices, rose at an annual rate of 5.5 percent in the second
quarter, compared with 1.7 percent in the first quarter. It was the
biggest jump since the third quarter of 1982.
   The various changes left the GNP, after adjusting for inflation,
at an annual level of $3.99 trillion in the second quarter, $29.1
billion higher than the January-March period.
   In another report, the Commerce Department said after-tax
profits by corporations surged 8.9 percent in the second quarter to
an annual rate of $162.7 billion, up from a 2.5 percent annual rate
of increase in the first quarter. It was the most profitable
quarter since the July-September period of 1983.
   A private report issued Tuesday said the profit picture should
continue to brighten in the fourth quarter. Dun & Bradstreet Corp.,
a leading marketer of business information, said its quarterly
survey of 1,500 executives found retailers the most upbeat.
   ``Retailers are headed into the fourth quarter with high
expectations for the holiday sales season,'' said Joseph W. Duncan,
corporate economist and chief statistician for Dun & Bradstreet.
   ``At the same time, the outlook among durable manufacturers
remains strong, so we should close out the year on an economic high
note.''
   The survey was conducted during the final half of August.

<HEAD>Pre-Cut, Do-It-Yourself Homebuilder Aims For Those Priced Out Of
Market</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TONY KENNEDY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PLYMOUTH, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As more Americans find themselves priced
out of the housing market, do-it-yourself home building could get a
taste of the good old days when thousands cut costs by raising
their own roofs.
   One company in the business, Miles Homes, believes the concept
of ``sweat equity'' still has some attraction, particularly among
consumers with annual incomes of less than $60,000.
   The company's biggest years were in the late 1970s, when it sold
do-it-yourself packages to as many as 2,200 people a year, many of
whom lived in then-booming Texas.
   Having taken some hard licks during the recession, Miles is now
happy to sell 800 homes a year. But the company is optimistic about
the future.
   ``This is not our best year, but we expect 1989 to improve,''
said Richard Cornwall, president and chief operating officer of
Miles Homes.
   The real heyday for do-it-yourself home construction in this
country was from 1900 to 1940, when two of the biggest kit-home
manufacturers were Sears Roebuck & Co. and Montgomery Ward,
according to research published earlier this year by Tab Books Inc.
of Blue Ridge Summit, Pa.
   Sears alone sold more than 100,000 kit homes from 1900 until the
start of World War II, when all domestic construction came to a
virtual standstill, according to Tab.
   It wasn't until the late 1960s that a resurgence in the
do-it-yourself attitude and an upswing in construction costs caused
kit homes to become popular again, Tab says.
   Since that time, the industry has grown to the point where about
20 percent of the new single-family homes built annually in the
United States have some degree of owner involvement, according to
the National Association of Home Builders.
   The Build Your Own Home Directory says about 138,000 Americans
built their own houses last year.
   Currently there are more than 2,000 kit-house manufacturers and
dealers nationwide, according to the Tab research.
   Although Cornwall admits Miles' share of the market is small, he
said Miles is one of the few companies in the country offering a
complete package for the do-it-yourselfer: land evaluations,
blueprints, materials, construction loan money and mortgage
financing.
   Under new owner Peter DeGeorge, who paid Meriden, Conn.-based
Insilco Corp. about $100 million for the company in April, Miles
has pulled in its territorial reins so that its principal markets
are in the Midwest and along the Eastern seaboard.
   Cornwall said Miles makes much of its money off the package of
pre-cut materials used in the construction process, but the
company's financing arm also profits when customers make good on
the three-year construction loans that are at the heart of the
sales pitch.
   Dave Dunnigan, publicity director for Miles, said 65 percent of
the customers are first-time homebuyers, many of them with annual
incomes of $25,000 to $60,000 a year who often do not have enough
savings to make a big down payment.
   Land costs not included, Miles will finance the purchase price
of its homes, which range from $25,000 to $65,000, for up to 36
months around market rates. No down payment on materials is
required, but an appraisal fee of $250 is required upon credit
approval. Payments on the three-year loan cover interest only and
at the end of the three years the construction loan balance is due
in full and usually is paid through the use of a mortgage, which
can be obtained from Miles.
   ``We've front-ended so much money out of our pocket, the
customers are usually in a good position,'' said Scott Gerber,
marketing manager. ``But most people will not come out ahead unless
they are involved in building it.''
   Ideally, if the customer does enough of the construction and the
home is built in a location that has value, the result will be a
structure that is worth more than it cost to build it.
   But, as Gerber said, ``we have people whose expectations aren't
met.''
   Indeed, in April 1978 the Federal Trade Commission ordered Miles
to stop making ``false, misleading and deceptive'' claims related
to the construction process. For instance, the company used to
advertise that the only skill required for assembly was ``the
ability to drive a nail or use a hammer.''
   Dunnigan said the company has long since made the corrections
and no other action has been taken by the FTC.
   Now when customers do not come out ahead, it is usually because
they added a luxury item like a whirlpool bath that was not called
for in the blueprints.
   Only a handful of people have walked away from their houses as
they were under construction, Gerber said. Those who have
frustrations in the process can turn to company experts for advice.
   The sweat, by the way, still produces some equity. The Council
of American Building Officials says consumers can cut home
construction expenses by 25 percent to 50 percent depending on how
much labor they do themselves.

   Soybean futures prices opened moderately higher
today on the Chicago Board of Trade in a technical recovery from
the low levels of the past few days. Grain futures were mixed.
   Active European markets for soybean products and a large
purchase of U.S. soybean oil by Pakistan added further support to
soybean prices, analysts siad.
   Wheat and corn futures were mixed in early trading with the
strength provided by a growing line-up of export bids. Reports of
quality problems with some newly harvested Illinois corn were
another bullish factor, analysts said.
   But overall gains were limited by selling linked to the
advancing corn and soybean harvest, said Walter Spilka, a grain
market analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co. in New York.
   `We're slowly getting into the harvesting season and these
markets have a hard time sustaining any momentum to the upside as
long as buyers know that just around the corner there's going to be
some good supplies coming onto the market,'' he said.
   In early trading, wheat was 2 cents lower to 1{ cents higher
with the contract for delivery in September at $4.06 a bushel; corn
was \ cent lower to } cent higher with September at $2.74{ a
bushel; oats were 1 cent lower to { cent higher with September at
$2.51 a bushel; soybeans were 3{ cents to 7 cents higher with
September at $8.24 a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were mostly lower in early trading on
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .45 cent lower to .30 cent higher with October
at 69.02 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .17 cent to .65 cent
lower with September at 80.05 cents a pound; hogs were .45 cent
lower to .33 cent higher with October at 38.55 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were .15 cent to .35 cent lower with February
at 59.42 cents a pound.
   Livestock and meat futures finished higher on Tuesday.

<TEXT>
   Higher costs for food, shelter and gasoline
sent consumer prices up 0.4 percent in August, the government said
today, as the effects of the drought in the Farm Belt began to ease.
   The August increase, equivalent to an annual inflation rate of
5.2 percent, was the same as in July. Higher rents and gasoline
prices in large part replaced food as the sharpest spurs to higher
prices.
   Food and beverage prices were up 0.5 percent last month,
compared to 0.6 percent and 0.9 percent gains in June and July,
respectively.
   Shelter costs, reflecting higher rates for hotel and motel
rooms, were up 0.6 percent, the steepest gain in seven months.
   Energy prices jumped 0.9 percent on a 3.0 percent boost in
gasoline prices, their sharpest gain in a year. The Labor
Department said, however, that gasoline prices were still slightly
below the level of August 1987 and were 26 percent below their peak
of March 1981.
   The higher gasoline prices offset decreases for all household
fuels. Heating oil costs were down 0.8 percent; natural gas prices
were off 1.2 percent; electricity costs slipped 0.2 percent.
   The lower home energy prices somewhat offset 0.4 percent
increases in rents and repair expenses and a 0.5 percent gain in
mortgage costs.
   ``Increases in the food, shelter and energy components accounted
for over four-fifths of the August advance in consumer prices,''
said the Labor Department.
   Excluding those three areas, which account for two-thirds of the
goods and services consumers spend money on, prices rose just 0.2
percent last month, compared to a 0.3 percent jump in July.
   The overall increase ``is marginally higher than in recent
months, but not dramatically so, given the month-to-month
variability of this inflation measure,'' said White House spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater.
   Grocery store prices continued to climb, but at a slower pace
than in July. Those prices were up 0.8 percent last month, compared
to a 1.4 percent jump in July. That had been their largest gain in
4{ years.
   ``About 90 percent of the August advance was due to price
increases for items that were adversely affected by the drought _
fruits and vegetables, cereal and bakery products, poultry and
eggs,'' the department said.
   Fruit and vegetable prices rose 1.3 percent after being up 2.9
percent in the preceding month. They have jumped a total of 10.6
percent over the last year.
   Cereal and bakery product prices were up 1.6 percent, reflecting
higher prices for wheat, oats and eggs. The August increase was the
largest since January 1981.
   The government's calculation of prices for meats, poultry, fish
and eggs rose 0.5 percent as gains of 8.4 percent for eggs and 2.1
percent for poultry were partially offset by declines in the costs
of beef, pork and seafood.
   Restaurant meal prices gained 0.3 percent while alcoholic
beverage prices jumped 0.1 percent.
   The steepest price drop overall was in apparel, down 1.6 percent
in August and 2.6 percent from June through August after rising 3.8
percent in the year's first five months.
   The government said unusually large end-of-season discounts for
women's clothing were responsible for most of the decline.
   Laundry and dry cleaning costs, meanwhile, jumped 0.8 percent,
their largest gain since February 1985.
   New car prices rose 0.2 percent while used car costs and
automobile financing expenses were up 1.5 percent each. Automobile
insurance costs were up 0.8 percent and have climbed at an annual
rate of 8.9 percent so far this year.
   The August increases left the Consumer Price Index at 119.0,
compared with 118.5 in July and 114.4 in August 1987. That means a
hypothetical selection of goods costing $100 in 1982-84 would have
cost $119 last month.
   For the first eight months of 1988, retail prices were up at an
annual rate of 4.6 percent, compared to a 4.4 percent gain for all
of 1987.

   Americans' personal income rose a modest 0.2
percent in August, the weakest gain in eight months, while consumer
spending was up at a slightly brisker 0.5 percent rate, the
government reported today.
   The Commerce Department said that the small $7.2 billion gain in
income last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $4.08
trillion followed strong increases of 0.7 percent in July and 0.6
percent in June.
   Personal consumption spending, which includes everything except
interest payments on debt, rose 0.5 percent in August following a
0.3 percent gain in July and a 1.3 percent jump in June, the
biggest in nearly a year.
   As in June and July, personal income was held back by declines
in subsidy payments to farmers. The payments shrank $6.2 billion in
August and $6.1 billion in July. However, in an apparent impact
indication of the drought, farm income excluding subsidies fell
$3.2 billion in August, compared with $700 million in July.
   Wages and salries, a key component of personal income, were up a
modest 0.3 percent in August compared with a healthy 1.0 percent
gain in July. That's consistent with an earlier report from the
Labor Department showing unemployment rising from 5.4 percent in
July to 5.6 percent last month.
   Disposable, or after tax, income was up 0.2 percent in August
and 0.6 percent a month earlier.
   With spending rising slightly faster than income, the personal
savings rate _ savings as a percentage of after-tax personal income
_ edged down from 4.2 percent in July to 3.9 percent in August. The
savings rate this year has been averaging around 4 percent, up from
3.2 percent last year.
   At the White House, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater
commented:
   ``Growth of consumer expenditures continues and the personal
savings rate remains well above last year's average of 3.2 percent.
The savings rate for the last three months has been 4 percent.''
   The spending gain was strongest for services, up $12.7 billion
following a $9.6 billion rise in July. Purchases of non-durable
goods rose $2.5 billion following a $3.6 billion increase a month
earlier. However, purchases of durable goods, ``big ticket'' items
expected to last three or more years, fell $200 million after
falling $10.9 billion in July.

   Four workers from the local Gillette razor
plant left Wednesday on an expedition to climb Mount Blanc to
protest what they say is the company's intention to close the plant.
   The company, based in Boston, denies that any decision has been
made on closing the installation.
   Union spokesman Jean-Pierre Toubhans said the four climbers
planned to reach the top of Europe's tallest peak on Thursday and
unfurl a banner reading, ``Non a la Fermature de Gillette'' (No to
the Gillette closing).
   In a radio conversation Wednesday evening from a mountain
shelter where the four were spending the night, worker Pierre
Dussolier declared, ``This is a first warning.''
   ``We have other options. If the Americans want war, we'll make
war,'' he said. ``But it will be a non-violent, economic war and
we'll take it to the end.''
   Dussolier did not elaborate but added that the Gillette
employees were mountain folk who ``want to show the French and the
Americans the determination of the highlanders.''
   The plant in Annecy, a city at the edge of the Alps 330 miles
southeast of Paris, employs about 750 people making double-edged
blades, plastic molding components and small toiletry products.
   The union charges that Gillette plans to close about 10 of its
61 plants worldwide, including the one in Annecy, as part of a
restructuring plan that was devised to thwart unwanted takeover
attempts.

   Share prices rose strongly Wednesday, boosted by
the announcement of Britain's largest-ever takeover bid.
   Before official trading began, Minorco S.A. launched its hostile
offer for the 71 percent of Consolidated Gold Fields PLC, which it
doesn't already own in a cash and stock offer valuing the whole

   The 100-share index surged as much as 25.8 points at one point.
   Several dealers said they thought the index would break the

sentiment.
   Volume was relatively strong, as 438.6 million shares changed
hands, compared with Tuesday's volume of 309.2 million shares.

   Gold prices slumped as much as $10 an ounce
Wednesday and bullion dealers said it was poised to fall below $400
an ounce for the first time in 18 months.
   The dollar strengthened in quiet trading, boosted by a few large
corporate orders.
   Bullion dealers said bearish sentiment was pushing gold down.
Eased concern about inflationary trends worldwide has depressed the
metal, which investors historically have used as a hedge against
inflation.
   Interest rate hikes in late August, aimed at curbing inflation,
have ``broken the bull trend in gold'' and forced a change in
people's perceptions, said analyst Julian Baring of brokers James
Capel and Co.
   One dealer said: ``The impetus is there for it to go lower, but
a part-correction is still likely before it breaks through 400
dollars.''
   A correction is market terminology for a temporary move in the
opposite direction.
   Gold fell in London to a late bid price of $401.50 a troy ounce,
compared with late Tuesday's $410.00.
   In Zurich, gold fell to $400.50 compared with $410.50 late
Tuesday.
   Gold last closed below $400 an ounce on March 20, 1987 in London
and on March 19, 1987 in Zurich.
   Earlier in Hong Kong, gold dropped $7.74 to close at $405.38.
   Silver bullion prices fell in London to $6.22 a troy ounce,
compared with Tuesday's $6.36.
   Most foreign currency dealers have refrained from trading
dollars, determined to avoid taking big positions ahead of the
Saturday meeting of finance ministers from the leading
industrialized democracies.
   Few participants are expecting anything out of the meeting other
than another reaffirmation of the ministers' desire for stable
exchange rates.
   One chief corporate dealer said a few big orders out of the
Middle East early in the day helped move the dollar above 1.8700
marks. The momentum pushed the dollar to a session high of 1.8780
marks before it retreated.
   In London, the dollar gained against the British pound. It cost
$1.6755 to buy one pound, more expensive than $1.6865 late Tuesday.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Tuesday:
1.8748 West German marks, up from 1.8641; 1.5833 Swiss francs, up
from 1.5740; 6.3710 French francs, up from 6.3385; 2.1145 Dutch
guilders, up from 2.1075; 1,395.60 Italian lire, up from 1,391.50;
1.2183 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2203.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends as Europe's business day begins,
the dollar edged up 0.03 yen to a closing 134.18 yen. Later in
London, it was quoted at 134.25 yen.

shareholders overwhelmingly approved the sale of the company to
Royal Bank of Scotland, the sixth-largest bank in Britain, for $440
million in cash.
   If the $30.50-a-share deal is approved by regulators, it would
be the first foreign takeover of a major New England bank and
transform Citizens into the top tier size-wise of the regional
banking companies in the Northeast.
   Citizens, whose best-known business is Citizens Savings Bank,
has assets of $2.6 billion, while Royal Bank of Scotland has about
$35 billion in assets.
   Citizens said 82 percent of its shareholders approved the
acquisition at a special meeting Tuesday, while 2 percent were
opposed and the rest refrained from voting.
   ``It was gratifying,'' said Citizens President George Graboys.
   He said that no major changes were planned after the merger.
   The deal still must be approved by the Federal Reserve Board and
the Massachusetts Board of Bank Incoporation. The Massachusetts
approval is needed because Citizens recently bought Fairhaven
Savings Bank in that state.

<BYLINE>By COTTEN TIMBERLAKE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A South African mining conglomerate launched the
largest takeover bid in British history Wednesday with a $4.9
billion offer for Consolidated Gold Fields PLC.
   Consolidated, which controls 8 percent of the world's annual
gold production, quickly rejected the bid, which sparked concerns
about a South African monopoly in the gold mining business.
   The offer by Minorco SA for the 71 percent stake it doesn't
already own in London-based Consolidated would significantly
strengthen South Africa's dominance over the Western world's gold
production.
   Consolidated is the world's second largest gold producer behind
South Africa's Anglo American Corp., which controls Minorco along
with De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd.
   Minorco offered 13.06 pounds ($21.94) worth of cash and stock
for each of the shares it doesn't already own. Minorco already
holds 29 percent of Consolidated's approximately 213 million shares
outstanding, excluding options, a stake bought mainly in 1981.
   On London's Stock Exchange, Consolidated's shares shot above the
takeover offer price to finish at 14 pounds ($23.52) a share, up
from Tuesday's closing price of 10.78 pounds ($18.11).
   If successful, the bid would surpass Britain's largest completed
takeover, Nestle S.A.'s $4.3 billion acquisition of confectioner
Rowntree PLC earlier this year, according to the industry
publication Mergers and Acquistions.
   The offer for Consolidated immediately sparked a controversy
even though Anglo American and De Beers said they would relinquish
control of the publicly held, Luxembourg-based Minorco and Minorco
said it plans to sell Consolidated's South African interests.
   ``It would mean that Anglo American would control the gold
industry,'' said one mining analyst at a London investment firm,
who didn't want to be identified.
   The analyst said he expected the offer to be reviewed by the
British government through its Department of Trade and Industry.
   Tim Read, director of mining at the London investment firm Smith
New Court Ltd., noting that Minorco would be gaining control of
substantial gold mining operations on other continents, said, ``In
terms of the dominance of gold mining, you can make a judgment for
yourself.''
   Sixty percent of the world's gold is mined in South Africa. The
acquisition would raise South African control to about 70 percent
of the non-communist world's production, analysts said.
   Analysts expressed concern that such a takeover might hamper
Consolidated's businesses.
   ``There may be a problem with local governments and
shareholders' resentment to South African control,'' said Rob
Davies, a mining analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton Securities in
London.
   South Africa's system of apartheid, which sustains white
minority rule over a black majority, has many opponents around the
world.
   Consolidated, which has been the subject of takeover rumors in
recent years, described the bid as ``lacking financial
justification'' and ``devoid of commercial logic.''
   ``The proposals announced show that Minorco will be forced to
begin dismembering Gold Fields both to help finance the bid and in
recognition of the regulatory and commercial problems associated
with South African control,'' said Consolidated Gold Fields
chairman Rudolph Agnew.
   Minorco said the bid fits in with its strategy to become a
worldwide natural resources group with direct operating control of
its activities.
   Its current Consolidated stake ``represents too large a
proportion of Minorco's assets to remain a passive investment,''
the company said.
   Minorco said that if its bid succeeds, it would immediately
begin negotiations to sell Consolidated's 38 percent holding in
Gold Fields South Africa and would review the target's 49.3 percent
stake in Newmont Mining Corp. of the United States.
   The stock-swap part of Minorco's bid would result in an increase
in the number of its own outstanding shares and effectively reduce
the combined holdings of the company's two major shareholders to a
minority stake. Anglo American's holding would shrink to 26.6
percent from 39.1 percent and De Beers' to 14.3 percent from 21
percent.
   The wealthy South African Oppenheimer family holds unspecified
stakes in the two companies.
   Consolidated, which traces its ancestry back to the 19th century
British industrialist Cecil Rhodes, has built up big stakes in
mining ventures around the world. It has diverse operations and
investments in Britain, North America, Africa and Australia,
including crushed stone and coal production.
   Its after-tax profit rose 29.5 percent to 212.5 million pounds
($357 million) on revenue of 1.23 billion pounds ($2.1 billion) in
the year ended June 30.
   Minorco holds stakes in a number of companies dealing with
investment banking, commodities trading, industrial operations and
extraction industries, primarily gold mining.
   Its operating profit rose 58 percent to $104 million dollars in
the year ended June 30. It doesn't report a revenue figure.

<TEXT>
   The board of directors of KDI Corp. has agreed
to sign a definitive merger agreement with a management group for
$19 a share, or about $184.3 million, the company announced
Wednesday.
   The merger agreement with KD Holdings Corp., a new company to be
formed by Wasserstein, Perella Partners L.P.; KDI Chairman Eugene
Cafiero; and a group of KDI senior management, calls for a cash
tender offer of $19 a share for all of KDI's 9.7 million
outstanding shares.
   KDI, based in Cincinnati, is a diversified manufacturer of
electronic and electrical components, swimming pool and pool
equipment products and custom engineered products.
   Cafiero said conditions have been attached to the offer,
including the tendering of 60 percent of KDI's outstanding shares
and receipt of definitive financing commitments.
   Once the merger is completed, holders of shares not purchased in
the tender offer also will receive $19 a share in cash.
   The buyout group also said it has signed agreements to purchase
49 percent of KDI's outstanding shares from Ariadne Australia Ltd.
and its affiliates.
   A special committee of KDI non-management directors unanimously
approved the agreement. It also ordered company management and its
adviser, Salomon Brothers Inc., to be available to accept inquiries
from any other parties interested in buying the company.
   Merrill Lynch & Co. Inc. has committed to provide as much as
$105 million in bridge financing for the acquisition. The financing
will be repaid through a public or private offering of senior
subordinated notes, the company said.
   Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. also has committed up to $150
million in senior acquisition financing and $20 million in working
capital.
   The management group and Wasserstein, Perella have agreed to
provide the equity portion of the financing.

<HEAD>Blue Mountain Accuses Hallmark Of Delaying Tactics</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOULDER, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Blue Mountain Arts Inc., which is battling
greeting card industry giant Hallmark Cards Inc. over the look of
its cards, on Wednesday asked the U.S. Supreme Court to deny
Hallmark's request for a review of the case.
   Hallmark has asked the U.S. Supreme Court to review an
injunction affirmed by the U.S. 10th Circuit Court of Appeals in
Denver that prohibits the Kansas City-based company from producing
and marketing the cards that resemble Blue Mountain Arts' cards
pending a trial on the dispute.
   But Blue Mountain Arts submitted a plea to the high court to
reject the proposed review, and accused Hallmark of trying to delay
the trial, now scheduled for Jan. 2, 1989.
   ``Hallmark is engaging in piracy not competition,'' said Bob
Gall, general manager for the Boulder-based Blue Mountain Arts.
``Like a pirate ship with a hundred guns, Hallmark's army of
lawyers are trying to prove that might makes right.''
   The dispute developed when Hallmark produced a line of cards
like Blue Mountain Arts' _ both featured watercolor decorations and
long free-verse poetry with mostly personal messages.
   Blue Mountain brought a lawsuit against Hallmark for copying its
product, and after testimony in a Denver federal court the
injunction was issued against Hallmark. The appeals court in Denver
later upheld the injunction pending the scheduled trial, but
Hallmark wants the U.S. Supreme Court to step into the case.
   Its request for the action claimed that the injunction was the
equivalent of granting Blue Mountain Arts the exclusive rights to a
particular artistic style of card, arguing that the decision was in
direct conflict with the Constitution and with the Copyright Act.
   ``Hallmark argues that it may counterfeit the appearance of
competitive products with impunity,'' Blue Mountain said in its
filing. ``Contrary to Hallmark's assertion, Hallmark does not need
to copy Blue Mountain's cards in order to compete.''
   Gall said the request was mailed to the U.S. Supreme Court on
Wednesday.
   Hallmark spokesman Steve Doyal said the company's general
response was a reflection of its petition.
   ``Our petition is simple and straightforward,'' he said. ``We
question the constitutionality of granting Blue Mountain perpetual
exclusive rights to an idea or artistic style.
   ``They are seeking a monopoly and we believe that is unfair and
anti-competitive,'' he said.
   He said the company sees the issue as completely separate from
the scheduled trial, for which its attorneys are preparing at this
time.

<HEAD>Willy Brandt Pleads for Third World Debt Forgiveness</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   On the eve of major talks on the world's economic
problems, former West German Chancellor Willy Brandt made a strong
plea Wednesday to reduce the debt of Third World countries, due to
reach $1.2 trillion by the end of the year.
   ``What sense does it make that for years now, there has been
more money flowing from the South to the North as interest
payments, than new money flowing out of the North to the South?''
he asked.
   He called it a ``reverse blood transfusion _ from patient to
doctor.'' The flow has been estimated at $30 billion annually in
recent years.
   Traditionally, poor developing countries _ like the United
States 150 years ago _ have received more money in new loans than
they were paying as interest. In this century, the rich countries
are in the northern hemisphere, the poor ones largely in the south.
   The World Bank and its sister organization, the International
Monetary Fund, are holding their joint annual meetings this year in
Berlin. Though formal sessions start on Thursday, delegates have
been arriving all week and informal contacts are taking place.
   Brandt said not much can be expected from the current meetings
because of the presidential campaign in the United States.
   ``Given the situation, I think the Europeans would be well
advised to take the initiative themselves,'' he said.
   Michel Camdessus, the Frenchman who is the fund's managing
director, saw separate problems for rich and poor countries.
   ``We still have serious problems to surmount, especially the
large payments imbalances among the biggest trading nations, and
the debt burdens of so many low- and middle-income developing
countries, which are struggling to restore adequate levels of
growth,'' he said.
   Brandt emphasized what he saw as the responsibility of rich
countries toward poorer ones. He endorsed the criticism that the
fund sets austere conditions for its loans that cause hardship in
poor countries.
   Both Brandt and Camdessus spoke at a public meeting sponsored by
a foundation called ``Development and Peace,'' of which Brandt is
chairman. At the age of 74, Brandt also heads the Socialist
International, a grouping of Socialist and Social Democratic
parties from many countries.

   Soybean and wheat futures prices closed higher
Wednesday on the Chicago Board of Trade, but corn finished mixed in
a day of lackluster trading dominated by technical factors.
   The moderate gains in the soybean market were partly due to
forecasts for harvest-slowing showers in the Midwest and active
trading of soybean meal in Europe, analysts said.
   ``But mostly the soybean market has been pounded so hard after
hitting the $9 (a bushel) level that from a technical viewpoint
we're due for some bottom picking, just to see if it'll bounce back
up,'' said Walter Spilka, a grain analyst with Smith Barney, Harris
Upham & Co. in New York.
   September soybean complex futures went off the board at 12:01
p.m. CDT. The September soybean contract expired at $8.27{ a
bushel, up 7 cents.
   Wheat futures advanced marginally, reflecting consolidation of
the market after Tuesday's sharp gains, Spilka said.
   The corn market enjoyed some spillover buying from the soybean
pit but the gains were slight.
   At the close, wheat was \ cent lower to 1 cent higher with the
contract for delivery in September at $4.05 a bushel; corn was 1}
cents lower to 2} cents higher with September at $2.76{ a bushel;
oats were 3{ cents lower to 1 cent higher with September at $2.49 a
bushel; soybeans were 1 cent to 7 cents higher with November at
$8.37 a bushel.

<HEAD>Sumita Says Japan Not Bowing To Pressure on Rates</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of Japan's central bank denied Wednesday
that Japan was being pressured by its allies to keep interest rates
low and said the bank would raise its key discount rate whenever it
felt such a move was necessary.
   Satoshi Sumita, governor of the Bank of Japan, made the comment
at a news conference when he was asked about market speculation
that Japan's benchmark rate was being held down because of
international pressure.
   Sumita said the bank would not hesitate to take action on
interest rates to defend the prevailing price stability in the
country.
   There had been expectations that the Bank of Japan might push up
its discount rate following increases in key lending rates in the
United States and some Western European countries. But the bank
held the rate at 2.5 percent.
   The currency markets briefly pushed up the yen against the
dollar following Sumita's remarks, but then the yen slipped back.
   ``People at first thought the Bank of Japan might raise the
discount rate and sold dollars,'' said one dealer. ``On further
reflection they realized that Sumita didn't say anything he had't
said before.''

<HEAD>Brazil To Sign Huge Agreement With International Banks Thursday</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Brazil will sign an unprecedented $82 billion
financial package with its international commercial bank creditors,
it was announced Wednesday.
   The deal to be signed Thursday was billed by Citicorp as a
possible landmark in the Third World debt crisis. A preliminary
accord was reached in July.
   Brazil is the biggest Third World debtor with a foreign debt of
more than $120 billion _ about one tenth of all Third World
external debt, which is estimated at $1.2 trillion.
   ``The medium-term package is the largest ever assembled on the
international markets,'' said William R. Rhodes, vice president of
Citicorp.
   Rhodes, chairman of the 16-bank committee that negotiates with
Brazil in the name of creditor banks worldwide, added Wednesday
that this ``is the first package since the debt crisis began in
August 1982 to combine new money with substantial debt reduction.''
   ``In that respect,'' Rhodes said, ``the Brazil package may point
the way to the future in the management of the debt crisis.''
   Brazilian Finance Minister Mailson da Nobrega was quoted by
Citicorp as saying that before withdrawing the first installment
under the new money agreements _ possibly next month _ Brazil will
be current on all interest payments to its commercial bank
creditors.
   Brazil suspended interest payments on its foreign bank debt for
about a year starting in February 1987 and has beem making partial
payments this year.
   Thursday's package includes $5.2 billion in new money to help
Brazil cover its external financing needs for 1987, 1988, and the
first half of 1989. Citicorp said said this includes $3.6 billion
in co-financing and parallel financing with the World Bank, $1
billion in new-money bonds, and a $600 million medium-term trade
facility.
   The package also includes a multiyear restructuring agreement
covering about $62 billion of Brazil's approximately $67 billion of
medium- and long-term debt to foreign commercial banks.
   It further includes $15 billion in trade and interbank
facilities through which international commercial banks will
continue to extend short-term trade and interbank lines of credit.
   Brazil will pay the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus
13-16 percent on the new-money credits, the bonds and the
restructured debt. The LIBOR rate fluctuates daily, and currently
stands at around 8.5 percent.
   The $62 billion of restructured debt includes private and public
sector loans maturing from Jan. 1 1987 to Dec. 31, 1993. It will be
rescheduled over 20 years, with the final maturity in 2007.
Principal payments on the restructured debt will begin in 1995,
Citicorp said.
   The restructured debt and some of the new-money facilities are
eligible for conversion to investments under a Brazilian
debt-for-equity program. Creditors could thus become investors in
Brazil and their converted loans on being transformed into
investments would reduce Brazil's foreign debt load.
   Separately Wednesday in Brasilia, President Jose Sarney
officially announced Brazil had ended its foreign debt moratorium.

<TEXT>
   Kohlberg Kravis & Roberts Co.'s unsolicited
$4.64 billion bid for the Kroger Co. supermarket chain underscores
the notion that leveraged buyout firms are no longer interested in
just friendly deals.
   The leveraged buyout transaction typically has hinged on
cooperation with a management that ultimately will stay on to run a
company long after the deal wizards have finished their work. But
in the push to do deals, some LBO partnerships might abandon a
touch of their previous gentility.
   Hamilton James, a managing director at DLJ Securities Corp.,
noted Wednesday that the level of aggressiveness in the buyout
industry has been on the rise recently.
   ``People are out beating the bushes and not waiting for the
phone to ring,'' he said. ``They are more aggressive in terms of
the prices they are willing to pay and the amount of risk they are
willing to take.''
   The line between friendly and unfriendly encounters has fused
from distinct black-and-white into a murky grey.
   ``Something that might start out looking unfriendly may end up
being a white knight,'' noted one LBO partner who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   With more money available for deals, he predicted there will be
``more circumstances where the firms capable of doing the larger
LBOs are stepping up to the plate and doing things in a more public
fashion.''
   Since its founding in 1976, the privately held KKR has
spearheaded the growing popularity of leveraged buyouts, in which a
purchase is made with mostly borrowed money that is repaid with
funds from the target company's operations or the sale of its
assets.
   KKR has amassed an estimated $5.6 billion that can be used as
equity to leverage roughly seven times that amount. The
partnership, which controls corporate giants ranging from Beatrice
Cos. to Stop & Shop, most often has entered into friendly
transactions.
   Despite the unsolicited nature of KKR's bid for Kroger, analysts
are reluctant to characterise the overture as hostile.
   The hard-driving New York partnership wasn't ``the first one to
tee the company up, to put it into play,'' said DLJ's James.
   Maryland's Haft family did that with a bid of $4.36 billion a
day before KKR appeared on the scene, and Kroger directors also
stirred the pot by stating that they were considering a
restructuring.
   ``The company already was on the auction block _ KKR didn't put
it there,'' James said. In addition, KKR has yet to try to force a
tender offer without board approval.
   ``You will not see firms that want to be major players in the
LBO industry doing anything unfriendly because that would be bad
for the management in the next deal,'' said Alberto Cribiore, a
partner in the LBO and investment firm Clayton & Dubilier Inc.
   ``KKR is becoming much more of a financial company than an LBO
company _ it's a different kind of animal,'' he said.
   The Kroger bid is similar to KKR's pursuit of the Chicago-based
Beatrice foods conglomerate. KKR came on the scene uninvited and
continued to pressure the board until Beatrice directors finally
accepted in what the industry dubbed a ``bear hug.''
   Fortune magazine reported in July that both Henry Kravis and
George Roberts privately argued in favor of launching a hostile
tender offer for Beatrice while awaiting word from the company's
board on what it would do. Opposing such a move was Jerome Kohlberg
Jr., who has left the firm amid talk that he was dismayed not only
by the size of the deals the partnership was spinning but also by
the growing agerssiveness of his younger partners.
   Analysts note that Kroger could be forced to capitulate in the
same way that Beatrice did.
   ``Kroger's options are limited ... and a higher offer by them is
unlikely,'' said Linda Morris, a analyst at Provident National Bank
in Philadelphia.
   She thinks Kroger could be pushed into the arms of another
leveraged buyout firm, namely Odyssey Partners or Gibbons, Green,
van Amerongen Ltd., both of which have interests in supermarkets.
   So far there haven't been two leveraged buyout firms in a
bidding war against each other. ``But we haven't seen a lot of
things yet,'' Morris said.
   The LBO firms are ``just another player out there that has the
capacity to (bid for companies) _ it just adds to the list that's
already there,'' she said.

   A national consumer advocacy group is asking the
Department of Transportation to investigate the ``fitness'' of
Trans World Airlines Inc. in light of Chairman Carl Icahn's plans
to take the company private.
   In calling for a federal inquiry, the Consumer Federation of
America joins TWA's flight attendants union, the Independent
Federation of Flight Attendants, which made a similar request last
month.
   Bill Mosley, a spokesman for the Department of Transportation,
said Wednesday that no decision has been made regarding the
requests.
   Consumers hold almost $500 million in unsecured obligations of
TWA in the form of prepaid, unused tickets, Mark Cooper, director
of research for the Consumer Federation, said in a statement.
   As a group, consumers are the second-largest current creditors
of TWA, just behind travel agents and tour operators, he said.
   If TWA were to file for bankruptcy, which Cooper claims is a
distinct possibility if the $304.8 million privatization goes
forward, consumers would have virtually no redress because of the
fragmented nature of their claims, he said.
   ``This is a unique ... risk placed upon the consuming public by
the special business practices of the airline industry, requiring
full payment far in advance for many of its most attractive product
offerings,'' Cooper said.
   ``After running up huge amounts of debt, the Icahn-led group now
proposes to take all its money and then some out of TWA, leave the
company with absolutely no equity and leave the airline on the
brink of bankruptcy,'' Cooper said.
   In addition, consumers would have claims against the airline in
the form of unused frequent flier credits, the group noted.
   The group also said some consumers are ``virtual captives of
TWA'' because of its domination in several cities, such as St.
Louis, where 80 percent of all flights are operated by TWA.
   ``The failure of the airline or a significant reduction in
service would have a devastating impact on these consumers who have
few alternatives for air travel,'' Cooper said.
   ``The Consumer Federation of America believes that the
Department of Transportation has the authority, and in light of the
facts, the obligation to open a fitness evaluation of TWA,'' the
statement said.
   ``We are still looking at it and deciding what to do,'' said
Mosley, the DOT spokesman. ``We are expecting some decision fairly
soon.''
   In its own attempt to stop Icahn's privatization plan, the TWA
pilots union filed suit in New York State Supreme Court on Sept. 7
to stop the deal, which won shareholder approval the same day.
   TWA declined comment on the consumer group's action. ``Until the
attorneys have more time to study it, they are not going to
comment,'' said TWA spokesman Robert Blattner.

<HEAD>Holstein Heifers Prepared For Journey To Canary Islands</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANITA C. HUSLIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MIDDLETOWN, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A herd of 500 pregnant Holstein cows will
begin an 11-day cruise to the Canary Islands next week, arriving in
plenty of time to get used to their new homes before giving birth,
an official said Wednesday.
   ``These cattle are going to have better living conditions there
than here,'' said William C. Nichol, executive secretary of the
Pennsylvania Holstein Association. ``There the temperatures range
from 70 to 80 degrees year-round; here they go down into the teens
during the winter. They'll be very comfortable.''
   A group of about 30 dairy farmers from the Canary Islands bought
the heifers with the help of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's
program for subsiding U.S. farm exports, dairy officials said.
   The farmers paid about $1,000 apiece and the U.S. government
kicked in a roughly equal amount, officials said.
   Residents of the islands, which form a province of Spain, have
relied primarily on milk imported from Europe, Casey said. The herd
will help the islands develop an autonomous dairy system, he said.
   ``We are very pleased with our selection,'' said Felix
Rodriguez, of Tenerife, Canary Islands. The 60 cows he bought from
the lot will augment the 150 cows on his farm, run before him by
his father for 50 years. ``They are fine animals for our farms.''
   The heifers will be transported to the Port of Wilmington, where
they will begin their 11-day voyage on Sept. 26 aboard the Athene,
a ship with three well-ventilated decks, Nichol said.
   This shipment is the third of four scheduled to go to the
Islands, he said. The last 900 are scheduled for shipment later
this year and will complete the contract for 2,700 Holsteins,
Nichol said.
   The Pennsylvania Holstein Association, in cooperation with the
Holstein Freisian Services of Vermont, arranged for the export of
the cows which come from nine states.
   Each heifer is expected to have about five calves during her
lifetime, Nichol said. After giving birth this fall, they will be
artificially inseminated to bear the next generation of Holsteins,
he said.
   The shipment represents the type of trade that will help
Pennsylvania set new food and agricultural export records, said
Gov. Robert P. Casey after touring the stockyard.

trading Wednesday, still seemingly in the ``summer doldrums'' with
autumn about to arrive.

2,090.50.
   But declining issues slightly outnumbered advances in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 689 up, 697

   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 127.40 million

   The dollar rose mildly against most key
currencies Wednesday, but analysts attributed the strength to
internal market influences and said trading remained light because
of the Yom Kippur Jewish holiday.
   Gold prices tumbled worldwide, falling through the
$400-a-troy-ounce level in the United States for the first time
since early last year. Republic National Bank of New York quoted
bullion at $396.35 an ounce, down $8.15 from its level late Tuesday.
   Currency analysts said the dollar's behavior reflected technical
strategies among professional money brokers and was not a response
to outside news.
   Commerce Department reports on August inflation, personal income
and housing construction had no impact on foreign-exchange
dealings, they said.
   In Tokyo, the dollar edged up 0.03 yen to 134.18 yen. Later in
London, it was quoted at 134.25 yen. By the time trading ended in
New York the dollar fetched 134.29 yen, up from 134.08 yen late
Tuesday.
   The British pound weakened against the dollar in London, falling
to $1.6755 from $1.6865 late Tuesday. Later in New York the pound
fetched $1.6737, vs. $1.6817 late Tuesday.
   Other late-dollar rates in New York vs. levels late Tuesday:
1.8744 West German marks, up from 1.8669; 1.5820 Swiss francs, up
from 1.5767; 1.2158 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2183; 6.3650
French francs, up from 6.3450; and 1,395.75 Italian lire, up from
1,389.00.
   Gold prices dropped as much as $10 an ounce in Europe and
flirted with $400, later breaking through that level in active U.S.
trading. John Jonat, a trader at Deak International Trading (U.S.)
Ltd. in New York, said ``it moved faster through $400 than it did
at any point during the day.''
   Precious-metals strategists have attributed the recently
depressed market for gold to growing investor disillusionment with
bullion as a hedge against inflation, which appears to remain tame
in the United States because of Federal Reserve pressure to tighten
interest rates.
   ``The key is how long can the Fed can control the inflation
rate,'' said Sharon Ziemian, assistant vice president for precious
metals at Citibank in New York. ``We've got to see some numbers
that show the Fed has started to lose its grip before gold turns
around.''
   Some strategists predicted gold would fall to as low as $380 an
ounce in the next few weeks.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery
fell $6.90 an ounce to $398.40. It was the first time the metal
closed below $400 since Feb. 18, 1987, when it fetched $392.70.
   Earlier, gold fell $8.50 an ounce in London to $401.50; it fell
$10 in Zurich to $400.50; and it fell $7.74 in Hong Kong to $405.38.
   Silver for current delivery fell 7.5 cents a troy ounce on the
New York Comex to $6.177. In London silver fell 14 cents an ounce
to $6.22.

<HEAD>Landmark U.S.-Soviet Publishing Deal For Moscow Signed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JACK SCHREIBMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.S.-Soviet venture plans to open 18
print shops and a central printing plant in the Soviet Union,
taking advantage of a recent liberalization of publishing laws, it
was announced Wednesday.
   The profit-oriented venture will bring ``for the first time in
history'' publishing, copying, printing and computer services to
Soviet private citizens, according to an announcement at the Soviet
Consulate.
   In addition, the capitalistic partnership will sell computers,
audio-visual and related products, cultural services, advertising
services, souvenirs and books in the Soviet Union, the announcement
said.
   California businessman Martin B. Lopata, chief executive of the
American side of the project, said the idea for the venture came
from the Soviets last winter, following their new policy of
``glasnost'' and ``perestroika,'' or openness and restructuring.
   Before recent changes in Soviet law, no document could be
commercially printed without a censor's permit and an official
document number.
   Lopata said the deal was agreed to by the Soviets as an
experiment, with plans to start in Moscow in January, Leningrad
next summer and Kiev a few months later.
   In a separate deal, AlphaGraphics Printshops of the Future, a
Tucson, Ariz.-based chain of more than 250 print shops, said
Wednesday that it would announce on Thursday its plans to open its
first two shops in Moscow this winter.
   The project announced in California is an outgrowth of the
Gorbachev-Reagan Moscow summit meeting earlier this year, when
``both sides reiterated their strong support for development of
economic ties between the two sides...'' said Soviet Deputy Consul
General Gennadiy I. Zolotov, who sat next to Lopata.
   It's also the result of the U.S.S.R.'s new ``joint project''
laws, he added, noting that the Soviet leader pointed out last week
in a speech in Siberia that specially favored ``business zones''
may soon be opened in the nation to attract foreign capital.
   The official said a contract forming the venture was signed
recently by MIR, the Soviet publishing house; the Soviet
cooperative, Sintez; and Unicorn Investments International, a
California corporation. The venture is called Sovaminco, for
Soviet-American International Co.
   ``This is a truly pioneering event,'' said Lopata. ``This will
also be one of the first facilities to allow printing to the
average Soviet citizen.'' Rubles as well as dollars will be
accepted as payment.
   Lopata, of Huntington Beach, Calif., said he ran an aerosol
chemical plant in Southern California until he sold out last year.
He said he was approached in February by a staff member of
Goskomizdat, the Soviet publishing and printing committee.
   Negotiations on the deal went along at an unusually speedy clip
after the concept was approved by Dmitry Mamleev, first deputy
chairman of Goskomizdat, and a preliminary contract was signed that
included the Moscow City Council, he said.

   Japanese investors bought more stocks in the

other foreign investors reduced their net holdings of stocks, the
Securities Industry Association said Wednesday.
   The Japanese added $1.5 billion to their holdings of U.S.
stocks, but sales by other foreigners reduced the overall net
foreign purchases of U.S. stocks to $588 million, the industry
group said.
   U.S. investors sold $1.2 billion more in foreign stocks than

<HEAD>Gold Futures Close Below $400; New 19-Month Low</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Gold futures prices fell for the sixth straight day Wednesday on
the Commodity Exchange in New York and settled below $400 a troy
ounce for the first time in more than 19 months due to slack
investor demand.
   With the latest economic statistics still indicating only modest
inflation, gold futures could fall as low as $385 a troy ounce
before finding many buyers, analysts said.
   On other markets Wednesday, other precious metals futures also
declined; copper futures were lower; livestock and meat futures
were higher; energy futures were mixed; grains and soybeans were
mixed; and stock-index futures advanced.
   Gold for delivery in October settled at $399.20 a troy ounce, $7
below Tuesday's final price. Gold futures last closed below $400 on
Feb. 18, 1987.
   ``The market did break that psychological barrier today and the
next stop in in the $385-$388 area,'' said Peter Cardillo, an
analyst in New York with Josephthal & Co.
   The gold market, pressured for the last four months by a
stronger dollar and only slight inflation, sold off in reaction to
the government's report that consumer prices rose just 0.4 percent
in August, analysts said.
   The Labor Department said the increase in the Consumer Price
Index was equivalent to an annual inflation rate of 5.2 percent,
the same as in July.
   The Commerce Department's report that Americans' personal income
rose a modest 0.2 percent in August _ compared with 0.7 percent in
July _ also was bearish for gold prices, analysts said.
   Gold is considered a good investment hedge against rising
prices, so investor demand for gold tends to rise and fall with
expectations of inflation.
   ``The latest batch of economic statistics are generally
non-inflationary,'' said James Steel, metals market analyst with
Refco Inc. in New York. ``There appears really to be no worry of
inflation, therefore the precious metals are coming off.''
   Steel said the extremely bearish tone of the precious metals
markets was evident in the narrowing gap between gold and platinum
prices. Platinum almost always trades at least $100 above gold. But
on Wednesday, platinum for October delivery on the New York
Mercantile Exchange settled at $485.10 a troy ounce, $9.80 below
Tuesday's final price and just $85.90 above the October gold price.
   Silver settled 7.5 cents to 8 cents lower on the Commodity
Exchange with September at $6.177 a troy ounce.
   Copper futures declined markedly on the Commodity Exchange amid
profit-taking, but the fundamentals of tight supplies and steady
demand remained strongly bullish, Steel said.
   There hasn't been any fundamental news to change anybody's mind
about copper,'' he said.
   Copper settled .95 cent to 2.60 cents lower with the spot
September contract at $1.123 a pound and the more active December
contract at $1.01 a pound.
   Most cattle futures moved lower on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, pressured by continued weakness in the cash markets due
to slack demand, analysts said.
   Hog futures were mixed with prices for near-month deliveries
steady to lower on speculation that cash prices would be pressured
Thursday by large hog marketings.
   Live cattle were .45 cent lower to .17 cent higher with October
at 69.10 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .33 cent to .75 cent
lower with September at 79.75 cents a pound; hogs were .32 cent
lower to .28 cent higher with October at 38.77 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were .05 cent to .55 cent lower with February
at 50.65 cents a pound.
   Energy futures finished mixed on the New York Mercantile
Exchange, with higher prices for gasoline and near-month deliveries
of crude oil reflecting concerns about about falling inventories
and the outcome of an OPEC pricing committee meeting next week,
analysts said.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 3 cents lower to 19
cents higher with November at $14.56 a barrel; heating oil was .23
cent lower to .18 cent higher with October at 41.09 cents a gallon;
unleaded gasoline was .30 cent to 1.01 cents higher with October at
45.35 cents a gallon.
   Soybean and wheat futures prices finished higher on the Chicago
Board of Trade but corn was mixed in a day of lackluster trading
dominated by technical factors, analysts said.
   Wheat settled unchanged to { cent higher with September at $4.05
a bushel; corn was 1} cents lower to 2} cents higher with September
at $2.76{ a bushel; oats were 3{ cents lower to 1 cent higher with
September at $2.49 a bushel; soybeans were 1 cent to 7 cents higher
with November at $8.37{ a bushel.
   Stock index futures advanced on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange,
where the contract for December delivery of the Standard & Poor's
500 index settled .65 points higher at 273.30.

   Eastern Airlines' Machinists union overwhelmingly
voted down a cost-cutting proposal described by a company
spokeswoman Wednesday as ``our best offer.''
   There were 7,596 ``no'' ballots, or 98.2 percent, against the
offer that union local President Charles Bryan said would cut
salaries by 56 percent. The tally compiled Wednesday also showed
nine void votes and 90 ballots favoring the offer.
   The union represents about 9,500 mechanics and ground-support
workers, Bryan said.
   ``It makes it crystal-clear that the membership were very
concerned, by the number who turned out,'' said Bryan. ``For 81
percent to show up to vote is an unprecedented turnout.''
   The offer was unacceptable because it would reduce pay, sick
days, vacation time and medical benefits, he said.
   Eastern ``just kind of gutted what had been accomplished over
the last 45-50 years,'' said Bryan, who said he expected contract
talks would now be resumed.
   ``We believe it was our best offer,'' Eastern spokeswoman Karen
Ceremsak said of the proposal offered in July.
   Eastern estimated the $161 million in wage concessions sought in
the proposal amounted to 10 to 20 percent of salaries, and accused
union leaders of stalling contract talks that began nine months ago.
   ``The predictable defeat of the contract proposal by more than
98 percent should send another strong message to the National
Mediation Board that the two parties are at an impasse,'' said Tom
Matthews, senior Eastern vice president of human resources.
   While negotiations are stalled, ``Eastern's losses continue. In
the meantime, Eastern has been forced to sell assets, lay off
employees and reduce service in order to survive,'' Matthews said.
   In the latest round of cuts, Eastern cut service to 14 cities in
late August and eliminated about 4,000 jobs, or about 12 percent of
its work force, on Sept. 10.
   Eastern, which has lost about $1 billion in the past decade, has
repeatedly sought to have an impasse declared. That would happen if
federal mediator Harry Bickford, a veteran of solving union
disputes at the Miami-based carrier, told the board he could do no
more.
   If the board agreed, both parties would have a chance for
arbitration. If either party declined, a 30-day cooling off period
would kick in. If no resolution were reached in that time, the
union would be free to strike and Eastern could impose its
conditions.
   ``While the board has caused the Eastern situation to drag on
for almost one year,'' Matthews said, ``it released Pan Am and its
Transport Workers Union from federal mediation Monday after only
eight months of negotiations and less than two weeks of mediation,
clearing the way for arbitration or the possibility of a negotiated
settlement within 30 days.''
   But Bryan charged Frank Lorenzo, chairman of Eastern's parent
firm Texas Air Corp., hoped for a strike. As he has in the past,
Bryan contended that Lorenzo aims to give Eastern assets to sister
carrier Continental Airlines, which is largely non-union.
   ``Absolutely not true,'' Ms. Ceremsak said. ``What we do want is
a 30-day cooling-off period. We believe the only way we can reach a
settlement is if we have a deadline. Without a deadline, there's no
incentive for the IAM to settle.''
   Eastern is also negotiating a contract with its pilots union,
which with the flight attendants union, took 20 percent wage cuts
in 1986. The carrier contends the cuts are needed to restore
Eastern to profitability. Bryan, who blames the company's money
troubles on poor management, said the union offered to take a
one-year pay freeze.

   The Travelers Corp. on Wednesday
announced a definitive purchase agreement for the sale of its
Canadian insurance operations to Zurich Insurance Co.
   The purchase price for TravCan Ltd. was not disclosed. TravCan
is a holding company for Travelers Indemnity Co. of Canada and
Travelers Life Insurance Co. of Canada.
   Travelers has served Canada since 1865.
   The sale is still subject to approval by both boards of
directors and Canadian regulatory agencies. Travelers, based in
Hartford, said it expects the sale to be completed by the end of
the year.
   Travelers had announced in May that it intended to sell its
Toronto-based subsidiary. Travelers said it would redeploy the
capital resulting from the sale to finance its long-range business
goals.
   Travelers said it will have services available for U.S. clients
with operations in Canada.
   The Zurich Group, based in Zurich, Switzerland, had worldwide
premiums of $12.3 billion in 1987. It has been a leading insurance
company in Canada for 65 years.
   Travelers' Canadian operations contributed about $272 million in
premiums to the corporations' total of $13.5 billion in premiums in
1987. The Canadian operations employ 1,100 people.

   American Airlines on Wednesday
completed its previously announced $1.69 billion deal with
Rolls-Royce of Britain to buy engines for 50 Boeing 757s.
   American Chairman Robert L. Crandall signed the pact at the
Rolls-Royce factory in Derby, England, and made a speech to the jet
engine manufacturer's management, a spokesman for American said.
   ``We got a good price,'' said spokesman Steve McGregor at the
airline's headquarters in Fort Worth. ``These are high-thrust
engines, the latest version of engine that Rolls-Royce has produced
for 757s. They're incredibly fuel-efficient and very reliable.''
   Under the agreement, American will purchase 116 engines,
including spare parts, to outfit 50 757s. American also agreed in
May to buy another 112 engines later for 757s.
   McGregor said the 757s will not be used to expand the airline
but rather to replacing aging Boeing 727s and 737s.

<TEXT>
   Northrop Corp. on Wednesday announced it had
adopted a ``poison pill'' defense against hostile takeover
attempts, although it is not aware of any potential suitors.
   In the event of a hostile takeover move, the plan would allow
Northrop shareholders to buy additional Northrop stock or stock in
the potential buyer at a 50 percent discount.
   Such plans, in common use for several years, are called poison
pills because they dilute the value of a potential buyer's
holdings, thus making the target company harder to swallow.
   ``The board noted that the action was not taken in response to
any acquisition attempt, and the board is not aware of any effort
to acquire control of Northrop,'' according to a news release by
the aerospace and electronics company.
   Rather, the board considered such a plan prudent because of a
spate of corporate takeovers in recent years, the company said.

   Hyatt International Corp. announced Wednesday it
is temporarily closing its two hotels in Cancun because of
devastation wreaked by Hurricane Gilbert on Mexico's Yucatan
Peninsula.
   The Hyatt Regency Cancun and Hyatt Cancun Caribe will close
immediately, the hotel company said in a statement.

America, said Hyatt would implement comprehensive rebuilding plans
as soon as possible.
   Mohaupt said all guests registered at either of the hotels and
in residence during the hurricane would be invited back to Cancun
and provided with complimentary rooms to finish their interrupted
vacations.
   The invitations would be good for the period April 15, 1989,
through Dec. 15, 1989.
   Mohaupt also said guests holding future reservations with Hyatt
at either of the Cancun hotels would be given assistance for
rescheduling their vacations to Acapulco at a 25 percent discount
from Cancun prices.
   He said arrangements also could be made for alternative
accomodations at other Hyatt resort destinations, including Key
West, Grand Cayman, Puerto Rico or Hawaii.

   Multimillionaire brothers Nelson Bunker Hunt and
William Herbert Hunt each filed for personal bankruptcy protection
Wednesday to avoid having to post a $225 million bond required for
appealing a federal jury verdict against them.
   A spokesman for the Hunts said the brothers decided to seek
Chapter 11 federal bankruptcy protection from creditors to keep
Minpeco SA, which won the verdict against them, from beginning
foreclosure proceedings on their personal assets until the appeal
could be made.
   The jury decided Aug. 20 in New York that the two Hunts and
brother Lamar Hunt must pay more than $130 million in damages for
conspiring to corner the world's silver market in the late 1970s,
ruining the investments of Minpeco, the Peruvian government's
mineral marketing company.
   The Hunts maintain that Peru, as the second-largest producer of
silver in the world, could only be helped as the silver price rose.
   Tom Whitaker, executive vice president for the Hunt Energy
Corp., said the decision to seek Chapter 11 protection stemmed from
a court requirement that they post a $225 million bond to appeal
the verdict.
   The Hunts said raising $225 million in an extremely depressed
economy would force a ``fire sale'' of assets, and also would
result in non-payment to business and personal creditors.
   ``Bunker and Herbert believe the jury verdict in New York is so
unjust that they elected to seek Chapter 11 protection of the
United States Bankruptcy Court in order to insure their ability to
continue their businessses while at the same time appealing the
silver case,'' Whitaker said in a prepared statement.
   ``The jury trial is the first step of a long civil process, and
I expect that the verdict will be reversed or substantially
modified and we will continue to work to that end,'' Bunker Hunt
said in a statement released by Whitaker.
   Wednesday's filing was the latest chapter in the Hunts' furious
struggle to keep alive what once was one of the world's wealthiest
legacies.
   The Texas brothers inherited a fortune from their late father,
Texas oilman H.L. Hunt. But heavy losses in silver, oil and real
estate had cut the brothers wealth from more than $5 billion to an
estimated $1 billion, according to published reports.
   Last Friday, a federal bankruptcy judge had approved a
reorganization plan to settle $750 million in loans and pull the
trust funds of the two Hunts and their brother Lamar out of Chapter
11 bankruptcy.
   The plan called for turning their financially strapped Penrod
Drilling Co., which is not in bankruptcy, into a corporation
jointly controlled by creditor banks.
   That plan was part of a settlement aimed at ending litigation
between the Hunts and the banks, which they claimed were trying to
force them out of business by refusing to renegotiate $1.5 billion
in business loans.
   The agreement, approved by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Harold
Abramson, also called for the brothers to pay $53.8 million in cash
and surrender real estate in Texas, Kentucky and Arizona in
exchange for $200 million in debts.
   Placid Oil Co., owned by the Hunt trust estates, also is in
Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The trust estates had offered in July to pay
$803.5 million to Placid's lenders, including $663.5 million in
cash.
   A proposed Placid reorganization plan called for the sale of the
Hunt brothers' interest in Thanksgiving Tower in downtown Dallas.
It also would require the brothers to come up with $250 million in
cash by borrowing on their successful petroleum properties.
   Wednesday's bankruptcy filings will not affect the
reorganization of Placid Oil or the Hunt brothers' trust estates,
Whitaker said.

   A Supreme Court justice Wednesday temporarily
lifted a court order blocking a strike by rail workers against the
Chicago & North Western railroad, but a union official said he knew
of no immediate strike plans.
   Justice John Paul Stevens granted an emergency request by the
employees and their union to suspend a federal judge's March 16
order temporarily enjoining the strike.
   Stevens' stay will remain in effect until the high court acts on
a pending appeal in the case.
   But James Brunkenhoefer, national legislative director of the
United Transportation Union, said late Wednesday that he knew of no
union plans to go on strike over the proposed sale of 208 miles of
the rail line in Wisconsin. Workers fear the loss of more than 200
jobs if the sale takes place.
   Officials of C&NW, a leading Midwestern freight hauler that also
runs commuter trains serving 40,000 people a day in Chicago's
suburbs, also predicted there would be no strike as a result of
Wednesday's ruling.
   ``The effect of the ruling is difficult to determine at this
time,'' C&NW spokesman James M. Foote said in a telephone interview
late Wednesday. ``We will have to discuss the change in the
situation with the buyer in the near future.''
   C&NW plans to sell the rail line _ from Milwaukee to Green Bay,
Wis., _ to a newly formed railroad, FRVR Corp., a subsidiary of
Chicago-based Itel Corp.
   The Railway Labor Executives Association had filed a motion to
stop the sale, arguing that the railroad was obligated to negotiate
over the effects of the sale on employees.
   But the U.S. 7th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled last month that
C&NW Corp. could sell the track without giving labor unions a voice
in the decision.
   The sale of the line is not related to another controversy over
train crew sizes that caused a brief strike against the C&NW in
August.
   An estimated 2,600 rail employees went on strike for a few hours
Sept. 9 against the C&NW over another issue involving possible
layoffs of brakemen.
   ``We're dealing with two unrelated issues,'' said Robert Reppe
Jr., president of UTU Local 577, which represents about 420 union
members in the Chicago area.
   Both Reppe and Brunkenhoefer said they did not expect any strike
to result from Stevens' ruling. Brunkenhoefer said he expected the
main effect of the ruling would be that the C&NW would not rush to
complete the Wisconsin track sale until labor and legal issues were
further resolved.
   The railroad and the United Transportation Union have been
battling for more than a year over the size of crews on C&NW
freight trains. But that dispute is not directly at issue in the
emergency request acted upon Wednesday by Stevens.
