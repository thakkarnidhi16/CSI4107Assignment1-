   Two attackers thought to be leftist
guerrillas fired rocket-propelled grenades at the U.S. Embassy
Wednesday night and an embassy spokesman said the roof was slightly
damaged, but no one was hurt.
   The assailants apparently were siding with Panama's military in
its standoff with the United States.
   The embassy's chief security officer said the assailants fired
rocket-propelled grenades. He spoke on condition his name not be
used for fear of reprisals.
   Police initially said rockets were fired at the building from a
distance of 150 feet. Witnesses later said they saw men firing a
recoilless rifle.
   ``The round apparently hit the fence surrounding the embassy and
exploded prematurely,'' the security officer said. ``We think it
went off over over the building. We went up on the roof and there
was absolutely no damage.''
   U.S. Embassy spokesman Steven Gangstead told The Associated
Press in a telephone interview that a projectile hit the embassy
roof, causing minor damage, but that no injuries resulted.
   The attack took place at 8:05 p.m.
   The two terrorists fled in a taxi, people at a restaurant across
the street from the embassy told an AP reporter.
   Anonymous persons calling the Bogota television stations
Noticiero Nacional and Ultimas Noticias said the attack was by the
Omar Torrijos Brigade of a leftist guerrilla group, the April 19
Movement, also known as the M-19.
   Omar Torrijos was head of Panama's military at the time he was
killed in a plane crash in 1981.
   Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, now head of Panama's Defense
Forces, has been indicted in the United States on drug charges and
has been resisting U.S. efforts to oust him. As military chief, he
is de facto leader of Panama.
   M-19 pamphlets found outside the Bogota radio station Santa Fe
said the guerrilla attack was because of U.S. intervention in
Panama and the presence of U.S. troops in Honduras.
   The United States sent 3,200 troops to Honduras last week after
Honduras said Nicaraguan soldiers penetrated Honduran territory
chasing U.S.-supported Contra rebels. Nicaragua denied the charge.
   The embassy is in a section of downtown Bogota known as The
Bunker, for the elaborate security systems designed to protect the
homes and diplomatic missions in the area.
   In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Sondra McCarty said
the agency heard press reports about the attack but she did not
immediately have any information or comment.
   The M-19 has claimed responsibility for dozens of bombings
against U.S. interests in the last 10 years.
   Bogota police and the army set up roadblocks throughout Bogota
Wednesday night trying to catch the terrorists.
   Drug traffickers opposed to extradition of Colombians to the
United States to face drug charges claimed responsibility for a car
bomb that exploded alongside the embassy in November 1984.
   A woman was killed and six persons were injured. All were
passersby.

   A police officer was indicted by a
federal grand jury for allegedly pouring scalding water on two
prisoners at police headquarters last year.
   The jury Tuesday indicted Patrolman Christopher Dillon on a
misdemeanor assault charge. If convicted, he faces a maximum of one
year in prison and a $25,000 fine.
   Michael C. Davis and Stephen H. Davis Jr. and a third man were
arrested Nov. 7 after a fight with three other men in Providence,
according to U.S. Attorney Lincoln C. Almond and Assistant U.S.
Attorney Edwin J. Gale.
   One of the other three was Dillon's brother Joseph, Almond said.
   After confronting the Davises at police headquarters, the
officer poured the water over them, with other policemen looking
on, authorities said. Prosecutors say the men suffered first and
second degree burns.

   With only four weeks left in the season, CBS is
facing its first third-place finish in the 35 years that the A.C.
Nielsen Co. has been rating television programs.
   The network has finished first 26 times, including six
consecutive years until NBC broke its streak in 1985-86, the first
time NBC had won a season in three decades.
   Times change. Now NBC is predicting it will win this season by
the widest margin ever.
   CBS is barely behind ABC in season-to-date ratings, the numbers
that networks and advertisers use as a basis for negotiating
advertising rates. The margin may be small, but last place is still
a blow to prestige. At least for CBS it leads the two other
networks in evening news ratings.
   After the 26th weeks of the season, NBC led the three networks
with an average prime-time rating of 16.3, ABC had a 13.9, and CBS
a 13.6. The rating is a percentage of the nation's 88.6 million
households with televisions. CBS would have to beat ABC by just
under two points each of the remaining four weeks to tie for second
place. That is unlikely. Last week, for instance, CBS edged ABC for
second, but only by a third of a point.
   CBS' regular series lineup is higher rated on average, but ABC
won the two weeks it had the Winter Olympics in prime time, and CBS
conceded it would finish last when a slew of new comedies failed to
make a dent in the ratings last week.
   Of the new shows, ``Trial and Error'' finished second-to-last in
the 77 Nielsen rankings, a reprise of ``My Sister Sam'' was
third-to-last and ``Coming of Age'' ranked 59th. ``Eisenhower &
Lutz,'' added to the already strong Monday lineup, ranked 31st.
   CBS has been struggling to draw younger viewers. Its
highest-rated shows are the venerable newsmagazine ``60 Minutes''
and the long-running ``Murder, She Wrote,'' both on Sunday.
   Of its shows that are new this season, CBS can count only Friday
night's ``Beauty and the Beast'' as a ratings success. Other new
CBS shows, like ``Frank's Place,'' ``Tour of Duty'' and
``Wiseguy,'' have drawn critical praise but have not found a
sizable audience.
   The executive responsible for the 1987-1988 season schedule,
former CBS Entertainment President B. Donald Grant, departed the
network in mid-season and was replaced by Kim LeMasters, who won't
really make his mark on the network's schedule until next season.
   Look for a major revamping of the CBS lineup next fall with new
comedies due from GTG Entertainment, the production company of
former MTM Production chief and former NBC Chairman Grant Tinker,
who has an exclusive deal with CBS. CBS also will have Mary Tyler
Moore back in a comedy and another new show will feature her
one-time sitcom co-star Dick Van Dyke.

   When the farmworkers union failed
to persuade civilian officials to remove Mario Espinal as head of
the National Agrarian Institute, it took its case to the armed
forces chief.
   In going to Gen. Humberto Regalado and the military high command
the National Association of Honduran Campesinos made plain its
feeling, shared by others, that real power in Honduras does not lie
with the civilian government of President Jose Azcona Hoyo.
   The union is seeking Espinal's ouster from the Cabinet-level
post on grounds that he was stalling on agrarian reform.
   Espinal, nevertheless, remains in his post, confirmed once again
by Azcona Hoyo, and so far as is known Regalado has not acted.
   The campesinos' tactic was also used in the past few years by
bus drivers, teachers, business leaders and other sectors. It
underscores the powerful, even dominant, role still exercised by
the armed forces six years after Honduras restored civilian
government.
   Honduras has a long history of military governments, most
recently in the 1972-82 period.
   ``The people know where the source of power lies,'' said Anibal
Puerto, vice president of the Independent Human Rights Commission
and a critic of Azcona Hoyo's administration. Even government
supporters acknowledge the imbalance of power.
   ``Longstanding vices are not gotten rid of from the night to the
morning,'' said Joaquin Luna Mejia, president of the Honduran
Council on Private Enterprise.
   In an interview with The Associated Press, he said consolidation
of civilian power ``is coming along well.'' But he also observed,
``Here, as in all countries, interests are managed according to the
real powers. And if those powers are ambitious, we could fall again
into old vices.''
   ``No Honduran politician is going around saying, `We've got to
put the military back in the box,' because here the military never
has been in the box,'' said a Western diplomat.
   Compared to its neighbors, Honduras has enjoyed a degree of
stability and peace during a decade of regional conflict. But the
civil wars surrounding it have caused big problems.
   ``We have become a sanctuary,'' said Luna Mejia of Honduras'
tens of thousands of refugees from El Salvador, Nicaragua and
Guatemala, all torn by guerrilla wars. ``We are victims of the
entry into our country of irregular forces.''
   He referred to the Contras, who since 1982 have been trying to
topple the Sandinista government in Nicaragua. Until last year, a
Contra force estimated at 6,000 to 12,000 men had waged the better
part of the campaign from base camps in Honduras along the
Nicaraguan border. The rebels say most of their forces are now
inside Nicaragua.
   By congressional vote, the United States has cut off further
military aid, damaging prospects for long-term effectiveness inside
Nicaragua.
   ``There is a great concern that the Contras, if defeated, will
try to come back here,'' said Luna Mejia.
   Gen. Regalado told journalists in February he hoped the Contras
would be able to keep up their fight but said if they cannot, they
are not welcome back in Honduras.
   ``We have instructed immigration authorities along the border to
ensure that they do not return,'' he said.
   Puerto sees a connection between the Contra problem and
continued military preponderance in Honduran politics. Citing
Honduras' very strong alliance with Washington, he said: ``To whom
does the Honduran army owe its allegiance? Everything indicates it
owes its allegiance to the United States, and not to its own
people.''
   He said civilian government and close alignment with the United
States had done little to alleviate the poverty of hundreds of
thousands in this mainly agricultural country of 4.5 million people.
   ``People expected something different from civilian government,
but they got more of the same,'' Puerto said. ``If things continue
like this, people may lose faith in so-called democracy and look
for other less desirable forms of struggle.''
   Azcona Hoyo is past the midway point in the four-year term to
which he was inaugurated in January 1986. Elections are scheduled
in November 1989.

   Blunt criticisms of art censors have come to
be expected from China's most famous movie director, Wu Tianming,
even more than the evocative and provocative films produced by his
studio.
   It takes no prompting to set him off.
   ``Those people (censors) were used to making hypocritical
propaganda,'' Wu grumbled in a recent interview. ``People who have
feudal and ultra-left ideas and bureaucrats ... get in the way of
our work.''
   Even the censors, however, have been unable to stop the cascade
of domestic and international honors awarded in the past four years
to Wu's movies and those of young directors who work under him at
the Xian Film Studio in China's ancient capital.
   Since Wu became its director in 1983, the debt-ridden studio in
arid northwestern China has become a prolific producer of
hauntingly beautiful, technically innovative movies that have
raised China's standing in the international film community. Many
in one way or another also have been seen as affronts to socialism.
   For example, Wu's own ``Old Well,'' about a poor village's
efforts to dig a well, won top honors last year at the Tokyo
International Film Festival and a special prize at the Hawaii
International Film festival and received critical acclaim in New
York.
   But its release to prudish Chinese audiences was delayed for
months because of the movie's depiction of a love triangle,
including several kissing scenes of unusual passion.
   ``The Black Cannon,'' directed by Huang Jianxing, one of Wu's
stable of young directors, aroused heated debate because it
attacked mindless bureaucracy. It eventually was named best movie
of 1985 by China's Ministry of Broadcast, Film and Television.
   Another Xian studio release, ``The Horse Thief,'' directed by
Tian Zhuangzhuang, never was shown to general Chinese audiences
because of its depiction of poverty among Tibetan horsemen.
   From his brick office compound with peeling paint and leaking
pipes, the 48-year-old Wu said he wants to expand the limits of
what is acceptable in Chinese filmmaking, largely restricted since
1949 to socialist morality tales.
   Wu said the studio does not seek to create controversy, but it
often results because he and his fellow directors are trying to
depict the often harsh realities of life in China.
   This frightens conservative bureaucrats accustomed to propaganda
movies, he said: ``They lived illusions. They cannot accept any
movie that reflects the dark side of life.''
   It's a side of life Wu knows well. He was born in the mountains
of Shaanxi province, north of Xian, where perpetual drought keeps
many peasants in poverty. During the 1966-76 far-leftist Cultural
Revolution, he was denounced as a rightist and paraded through
Xian's streets wearing a signboard proclaiming his political sins.
   Afterward, he said, he went home and ``shut my door and
studied'' for the rest of the tumultuous decade, during which China
made almost no movies.
   Wu is willing to take risks not only for his own movies but
those of other directors at the Xian studio _ one reason it has
attracted talented young directors and cinematographers.
   On his movie, ``The Black Cannon,'' Huang said: ``The moment we
saw the film for the first time we knew it would be controversial.
   ``But we had a common idea,'' he said pointing to Wu, ``that
this film should reflect life. We felt some pressure when the film
was not (immediately) approved. But Mr. Wu said at one meeting if
problems occurred he would be held responsible.''
   Another attraction is Wu's readiness to give young directors
free rein.
   Asked if he gives advice to the less experienced, 34-year-old
Huang, Wu laughed and said, ``He does fine on his own. If I were to
help him ... I might stifle him.
   ``There would be great prosperity in China's literature and arts
if all artistic leaders followed my example: to let artists do what
they like.''
   Wu is harsh in his criticism of standard Chinese movie fare.
``Sixty percent of Chinese movies are seriously lacking,'' he said.
But he is no kinder to foreign movies.
   He disliked Steven Spielberg's ``Empire of the Sun,'' partly
filmed in Shanghai, about the Japanese invasion of China in World
War II. Wu also said he does not seek to copy Western movies.
   He says his studio's movies are the best being made in China
now, and was confident his own ``Old Well'' will sweep the Chinese
critics' and government awards for best movie of 1987.
   Several upcoming Xian movies appear ripe to arouse debate: one
is about army chief Peng Dehuai, purged in 1958 for daring to
criticize Mao Tse-tung; another concerns three youths whose lives
are failures despite their efforts to get ahead.
   ``Maybe some people will think it's too gray,'' Huang said of
the latter movie, which he is directing, to be called ``Floating
Out of the Sea.''
   His own output is relatively slim. In addition to co-directing
two movies, he has directed just three: ``Old Well,'' ``Life''
(1984) and ``River Without a Buoy'' (1983). All three have received
prizes at home or abroad.
   The demands of running a studio that employs 1,450 and is
perpetually in debt will keep him from starting his next movie
before next year, he said.
   Will it be controversial?
   ``Yes,'' Wu said emphatically, using one of his few English
words. ``Definitely.''

   The shortage of good books in the Soviet Union is
being assaulted in a two-front war, with 3,500 previously banned
titles being published and a new law in the works that will allow a
vanity press.
   Soviets have complained for years that while state bookstores
are overflowing with political reflections, moralistic fiction and
the works of Communist Party officials, people are hard pressed to
lay their hands on the best writing of Soviet, Russian and foreign
authors.
   Two newspapers referred to the ``book deficit'' on Tuesday in
announcing programs aimed at expanding the pool of quality
literature available at bookshops or public libraries.
   The Communist Party daily Pravda said authors willing to risk
their own money will be able to publish their works, sharing in
earnings from government sales or absorbing the loss if the
material fails to draw a following.
   Alla A. Kozdreva, a legal consultant at the State Publishing
Committee that will oversee the private project, told The
Associated Press restrictions will be established on content and
the size of press runs during meetings to be held later this month.
   ``But the decision to allow publishing by authors willing to pay
has been made in principle,'' Ms. Kozdreva said.
   The project is primarily aimed at luring free-lance writers into
the public market and keeping them from turning to unsanctioned
underground presses. Under existing regulations on use of printing
facilities, only full-time, state-approved authors can get their
prose and poetry produced legally.
   The State Publishing Committee also is seeking new sources of
revenue in these days of financial accountability, Pravda said.
Under Mikhail S. Gorbachev, government agencies have been
instructed to generate revenue to cover operating expenses.
   Gorbachev's tenure has also seen a major rethinking of
government policy on the arts and artistic freedoms, including the
printing of books that were once banned.
   In addition to the vanity press venture, state presses soon will
be turning out new editions of highly popular works by Mikhail
Bulgakov, author of ``The Master and Margarita,'' and Boris
Pasternak, who won the 1958 Nobel Literature Prize for his novel
``Doctor Zhivago.'' It has not yet been published in book form in
his homeland.
   The newspapers did not say whether foreign literature was
included among the books to be made available. Foreign writers such
as Jack London, Ernest Hemingway and Emile Zola are very popular in
the Soviet Union, and some have been available for years.
   No details were given on the pricing system to be used for books
published by their authors.
   ``This is not going to be a cheap venture for the author,''
Pravda warned. ``Depending on the number of copies and the volume,
such a publication will cost roughly 2,000 rubles and more.''
   That sum, the equivalent of $3,340, represents nearly a year's
pay for the average industrial worker.
   The author in return will receive 20 percent of the sales
income, Pravda said.
   The program has not yet been put into the form of law, Pravda
noted, but already state publishing houses have many applications
from authors who want to pay to see their works in print.
   By offering an alternative to creation of publishing
cooperatives, the State Publishing Committee retains a monopoly on
what gets into print.
   On a related subject, the newspaper Soviet Culture disclosed
Tuesday that GlavLit, the state body which for decades has been
responsible for censorship, is conducting a review of 6,000 books
held in ``special detention'' storehouses.
   Most of the fiction and non-fiction titles were banned during
the 29-year dictatorship of Josef V. Stalin and removed from
library shelves and book kiosks because their authors were deemed
to have espoused politically hazardous ideas.
   ``The vast majority of those books were works whose authors were
subjected to repression during the years of Stalin's personality
cult,'' Vladimir A. Solodin, a member of the review committee, told
Soviet Culture. ``The others had other `faults,' for example,
forewords written by such repressed politicians, quotes from their
works or their photographs.''
   Among the blacklisted books were 180 that contained references
to Nikolai I. Bukharin and 70 that mentioned Alexei I. Rykov, two
prominent political figures from the early years of the Soviet
government executed by Stalin but recently rehabilitated by
Gorbachev.
   GlavLit, or the Chief Directorate for the Protection of State
Secrets in Publishing, was created in 1922 to ensure freedom of the
Soviet press from ideological impurity. It has served since as the
chief censorship agency, and would have banned the blacklisted
books in the first place.
   A GlavLit committee went through 4,000 of the banned titles in
the past year and returned 3,500 to the public domain, the
newspaper said. It gave no examples of the works returned to
readers, but said the review was helping to resolve the deficit in
good literature.
   The 500 books left in special detention are mostly ``profoundly
instigatory literature and nationalistic writings,'' that could be
used for ill purposes if allowed into general distribution, Solodin
said.
   The decision to keep them under wraps is not final, and the
GlavLit committee will take another look at them once the initial
screening is completed, Solodin said.

   Cancer patients whose bone marrow was
destroyed by therapy regained marrow function after injections of
their own blood cells, suggesting an alternative to marrow
transplants, says a study released today.
   The blood-cell technique may permit aggressive cancer treatment
in patients who cannot get marrow transplants, said Margaret
Kessinger, associate professor of medicine at the University of
Nebraska College of Medicine.
   Marrow transplant experts said its near-term usefulness would be
limited, but that it may have potential for wider use.
   Bone marrow creates the blood cells of the disease-fighting
immune system. Marrow transplants are used in cancer therapies when
the doses of anti-cancer drugs or radiation are so high they will
destroy the marrow.
   In some cases, marrow is withdrawn from the pelvic bone of the
patient while the patient is under general anesthesia. It is stored
in the laboratory while the cancer therapy is performed, then
injected back in the person. The marrow cells migrate to the bones
and multiply until they replenish the marrow lost in the therapy.
   For other patients a donor is preferable. But only 30 percent of
such patients have a willing donor, usually a sibling, whose marrow
is similar enough for their bodies will accept, said Kessinger, who
spoke to science writers at an American Cancer Society seminar.
   About 4,000 people a year in the United States give up marrow to
have it returned after treatment, said David Golde, chief of
hematology and oncology at the University of California, Los
Angeles, School of Medicine.
   Worldwide, about 1,500 marrow transplants from one person to
another are done annually, said Robert Peter Gale, professor of
medicine at UCLA, who performed bone-marrow transplants on Soviet
radiation poisoning victims from the Chernobyl nuclear power plant
fire.
   Kessinger said the experimental technique involves extracting
white blood cells from a patient's blood. In four-hour sessions
every day for six days, blood is removed and returned to the
patient after white cells are removed, she said. The body replaces
the white cells about as fast as they are extracted, she said.
   The goal is to harvest a kind of cell called the pluripotent
stem cell, which essentially replaces lost bone marrow.
   The pluripotent stem cells cannot be identified in human blood,
but apparently are removed with white cells, Kessinger said.
   She described a study of 26 patients who went through the
procedure and were watched for evidence of marrow function.
   In comparison with 83 patients whose bone marrow was harvested
by conventional means, the experimental group first showed white
cells in the blood three days sooner, for an average of eight days
after the procedure, she said.
   Both groups took the same amount of time to recover other marrow
function, she said.
   Results suggest the procedure could be used in patients who
could not give their own marrow because of prior radiation to the
pelvis or cancer in their marrow, she said. That could come to
several hundred patients a year, she said.
   It might also help increase the pool of donors for those who
need another person's marrow, since the donor would not have to
undergo general anesthesia, she said. Donors not related to the
patient might be willing, she said.
   Gale estimated that the pelvic-radiation situation would apply
to fewer than 100 patients a year. As for those with cancer in
their marrow, cancerous cells may also be in the blood, and the new
technique might simply plant them in the renewed marrow, he said.
   Kessinger said studies suggest that that would not necessarily
cause cancer in the marrow.
   Gale said the technique could have considerable use if that
issue were overcome, and if it proved an attractive alternative to
anesthesia for unrelated donors.
   In any case, it must be studied for any effect on cancer
survival rates, he said.

   Cornell University is cataloging books,
personal papers, videotapes and periodicals with names like ``Mom
Guess What!'' and ``Fag Rag,'' hoping its new gay archives will
help bring the study of human sexuality out of the academic closet.
   The materials, comprising one of the nation's most extensive
collections on homosexuality, are nearly all gifts from the
Mariposa Education and Research Foundation, founded in 1979 by
physiologist Bruce Voeller, who felt universities were neglecting
human sexuality.
   The basic endowment for maintenance of the archives, $824,000,
came from the estate of David Goodstein, a Cornell alumnus who
became wealthy on Wall Street and later published the national gay
magazine, ``The Advocate,'' until his death in 1985.
   The first materials arrived last month and are being stored in
103 acid-free cardboard boxes in the basement of Cornell's Olin
Library. The collection, available for research this fall,
eventually will include hundreds of thousands of items dating to
World War II. University archivist H. Thomas Hickerson said the
school also intends to collect materials dealing with other aspects
of human sexuality.
   The Mariposa collection includes material from Anita Bryant's
bruising battle with gay activists in 1978 over a proposed gay
rights constitutional amendment in Florida.
   ``The militant homosexuals are at it again!'' read one of
Bryant's mailed appeals. It warned that passage of the amendment
would help homosexuals ``legitimize their perversion and recruit
our children.''
   Among the 50 or so gay periodicals in the collection is ``Mom
Guess What!,'' a 10-year-old monthly published in Sacramento, Calif.
   There are rare foreign periodicals, some no longer published:
``Nouvel Homo'' from France, ``Bergensnyt'' from Norway,
``Emancipation'' from Berlin. Another, ``The Circle,'' was
published years ago in German, French and English in Switzerland.
   In hindsight, it's interesting to read how Goodstein's own
periodical, ``The Advocate,'' ranked AIDS ninth on its list of
``top 10 gay stories of 1982'' _ behind such largely forgotten
stories as the appointment of a homosexual minister to the staff of
a United Methodist parish in Denver. Since then, the U.S. death
toll from acquired immune deficiency syndrome has reached 31,836,
forcing drastic changes in social and sexual practices among
homosexual men, its primary victims in this country.
   Among the collection's personal papers is a March 1976 letter to
the Horace Mann-Barnard School protesting the prep school's refusal
to print biographical material in its alumni magazine about the gay
rights activities of two graduates, one of whom was Martin
Duberman, a member of the National Gay Task Force and a history
professor at Lehman College in New York City.
   The Mariposa collection's only rival in size and breadth is at
the Kinsey Institute at Indiana University. But the Cornell
collection differs in stressing sexuality in its political,
historical and social context, rather than focusing on clinical
aspects.
   Harvard has collections of lesbian materials. Brown, Yale and
the University of Michigan also have collections relating to
homosexuality. But such archives remain rare, as are non-medical
courses on human sexuality generally.
   A computer search of 137,000 university collections turned up
only 19 containing anything on homosexuality _ and seven are at
Cornell.
   The prime force in getting the archives to Cornell was
Goodstein, who for years shared a house in Los Angeles with
Voeller. He ``felt very strongly that it's inexcusable that so many
things center around human sexuality and we have so little
scholarly knowledge,'' Voeller said in an interview from his office
in Topanga, Calif. Mariposa also has offices in New York and San
Diego.
   After trying unsuccessfully to interest the New York Public
Library in the collection a decade ago, Goodstein turned to his
alma mater in 1983.
   At first, said Cornell Provost Robert Barker, ``we didn't
understand the seriousness of the proposal.'' But Goodstein, ``a
man with a short fuse who did not take lightly to being brushed
off,'' pressed his case and went to the student and local
newspapers.
   Soon after, university librarians inspected the materials and
concluded the collection had ``great scholarly importance.''
   University officials say there was little debate over the
decision to bring the collection to Cornell. Alain Seznec,
libraries director, said the lack of commotion is perhaps a sign of
how far American campuses have progressed.
   ``There are some battles that are past us, somehow,'' he said.
``Getting this archive is not some courageous stand by Cornell.
There undoubtedly will be outraged alumni who will say, `Cancel my
subscription to the alumni bulletin!' Not that we'll do anything
about it.''

   Stronger economic sanctions against South
Africa would only strengthen pro-apartheid forces, create problems
for the U.S. economy and weaken U.S. influence in that nation,
Reagan administration officials said Tuesday.
   In testimony before a joint hearing of two House Foreign Affairs
subcommittees, representatives from the Departments of State,
Defense, Commerce and Treasury maintained that the tougher
sanctions currently before Congress would not speed up the end of
apartheid.
   Charles W. Freeman Jr., deputy assistant secretary of state for
African affairs, warned that proposed new sanctions, including a
total investment and trade embargo, would ``play into the hands of
the white and black extremists who seek our departure from South
Africa.
   ``We have to decide whether the United States will continue to
be involved in the struggle to end apartheid peacefully or whether
we will become more and more irrelevant,'' he added.
   The Pretoria government has moved toward ``the brink of
wholesale authoritarianism and international isolation,'' since
Congress overrode the president's veto on the first U.S. sanctions
in 1986, Freeman said.
   He maintained that this has weakened U.S. influence there and
threatens to curtail other U.S. assistance to apartheid victims.
   But Rep. Ronald Dellums, D-Cal, said that to be true to its own
democratic standards, the United States ``cannot be in bed in some
fashion with the evil and the horror and the oppression of South
Africa.''
   He is the author of legislation calling for a total ban on U.S.
investment and trade with South Africa as well as cooperation in
military and intelligence affairs. His is one of five bills calling
for stricter sanctions aginst South Africa.
   Dellums said existing sanctions permitted ``back door'' U.S.
financing of the South African government and economy and that U.S.
firms were paying much more in South African taxes than for
projects to uplift the black community.
   James B. Kelley, deputy assistant secretary of commerce, note
that that U.S. firms in South Africa had decreased from 320 in 1984
to 127 today, and insisted that what little U.S. influence is left
will be lost if the remaining firms are forced out.
   Calling the proposed legislation ``nonsensical and destructive,
Assistant Treasury Secretary Robert A. Cornell said the measures
would `` harm the interests of the non-white population'' by
reducing their opportunities, while expanding the economic power of
the South African whites.
   Barring U.S. exports and oil companies from operating in South
Africa would cost U.S. jobs but not hurt South Africa because other
suppliers would step in, Cornell said.

   Three zeros mean nothing by themselves, but
leaving them off the end of a number is going to cost the nation's
largest insurer at least $8 million.
   Prudential Insurance Co. of America is offering the payment to
settle claims resulting from a clerical error in which a lien it
held was listed as worth $92,885 instead of $92,885,000.
   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Howard Buschman III heard closing
arguments on the proposed settlement Tuesday and is expected to
rule in several days.
   ``Why because of a clerical error should we give up $92
million-plus?'' Prudential spokesman Joseph Vecchione said Tuesday.
   If Buschman knocks down the proposed settlement and decides the
lien is only worth $92,885, Prudential would collect only that
much. The rest of its claim would be thrown into the pool with
other creditors.
   The case is part of the Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings of
McLean Industries Inc., parent of United States Lines. Prudential
holds the lien in connection with mortgages on eight of the
company's container ships.
   The sale of the eight Lancer-class ships was expected to raise
at least $51 million, all of which ordinarily would go to
Prudential because the lien puts it at the head of the line of
creditors.
   But the missing zeros have weakened Prudential's standing.
   Prudential is proposing to pay the shipping company 17{ percent
of the sale's net proceeds, an estimated $8 million. That money
would be distributed among other creditors, most of whom support
the proposal.
   But General Electric Capital Corp., which shares a second
mortgage on the ships with Prudential, opposes the deal, saying the
lien should be considered worth $92,885.
   The settlement is not ``in the best interests of the bankruptcy
estate,'' Sandy Mayerson, a lawyer representing GE Capital, said
Tuesday.
   Prudential says the clerical error _ repeated on at least 20
documents _ was committed by someone at a law firm it once used,
Haight, Gardner, Poor and Havens.
   Prudential has said it has not decided whether to file
malpractice lawsuits against Haight, Gardner and its overall
outside counsel on the transaction, Dewey Ballantine Bushby Palmer
& Wood. Both law firms have declined to comment.

   Nancy Reagan gave composer Andrew Lloyd Webber a
gold gift-wrapped box containing a jar of jelly beans for his 40th
birthday before seeing his latest Broadway musical, ``Phantom of
the Opera.''
   Mrs. Reagan, dressed in a black velvet suit with fur collar,
said she chose to see ``Phantom'' on Tuesday because ``it's the
biggest thing there is.''
   ``This is the first time I've been to the theater in a very long
time,'' she added.
   ``I'm delighted that she's coming to see our little effort,''
said Lloyd Webber. He and Mrs. Reagan met in the empty Royale
Theater before going next door to the Majestic Theater to see
``Phantom'' and meet with the cast after the show.
   Mrs. Reagan was in New York to visit her brother, Dr. Richard
Davis, a neurosurgeon, and his wife, Patricia.
   ``Phantom,'' set in the Paris Opera House in the late 19th
century, is a love story about an impressionable, beautiful young
soprano who is kidnapped by, and eventually attracted to, a
hideously deformed older man who wears a mask and lives in a
catacomb beneath the stage.

   Comedian Bob Hope is making an excellent
recovery from prostate surgery, a hospital spokesman said.
   ``Mr. Hope is doing very, very well and is expected to be
discharged in the next couple of days,'' hospital spokesman Gordon
Cohn said Tuesday.
   The 84-year-old comedian underwent surgery Monday at the
University of Southern California Kenneth Norris Jr. Cancer
Hospital.
   Hope does not have cancer but had his operation there because
his surgeon, Dr. Donald G. Skinner, chief of urology at USC,
performs his surgeries at the cancer center.
   The surgeon removed fibrous tissue filling the prostate.
   Hope's publicist, Frank Liberman, said the comedian was not
expected to be able to attend a benefit he was scheduled to appear
in on Saturday.

<HEAD>Most Comprehensive Survey Of Milky Way Galaxy To Start Thursday</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE SIEGEL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The most detailed survey of the Milky Way
will start Thursday at the world's most sensitive radio telescope,
an array of 27 dish-shaped antennas spread across New Mexico's
desert.
   ``Without a doubt this will give us the most comprehensive
picture of our galaxy yet obtained in any kind of wavelength,''
including visible light and radio and infrared radiation, said
Robert H. Becker, associate professor of astronomy at the
University of California, Davis.
   The $1 million, two-year survey will be conducted by Becker and
astronomer David Helfand of Columbia University. They will use the
Very Large Array radio telescope, a set of 27 antenna dishes, each
about 80 feet in diameter, that move on 20 miles of tracks west of
Socorro, N.M.
   The telescope, which started operations in the late 1970s, can
detect fainter radio signals than any other radio telescope, Becker
said Tuesday during a telephone interview.
   More complete surveys of the heavens beyond our galaxy have been
conducted using powerful optical and infrared telescopes aimed to
look above or below the Milky Way's flattened disk.
   But such telescopes can't survey our own galaxy very well
because visible light is blocked by tremendous amounts of dust
between the Milky Way's stars and because the galaxy is so full of
infrared light sources that it's hard to distinguish various
objects, Becker said.
   The survey will construct maps of the 70 percent of the Milky
Way visible from the Northern Hemisphere by detecting objects that
emit radio waves, which penetrate the dust.
   Such objects include supernovas, or dying, exploding stars; vast
dust-and-gas clouds where new stars are born; and very dense
supernova remnants called neutron stars, pulsars and black holes.
   ``What this kind of survey can do is give you the overall
picture,'' Becker said. ``Until you catalog the contents of your
own galaxy, you're never going to have a clear picture of what the
galaxy is.''
   The disk-shaped Milky Way contains an estimated 100 billion
stars clumped in spiraling arms that stretch across 100,000 light
years, or about 588,000 trillion miles, of space. Earth is located
roughly 22,000 light years, or 130,000 trillion miles, from the
galaxy's center.
   Becker said the survey undoubtedly will produce unexpected
discoveries, but also could help astronomers determine the
frequency and location of supernova explosions invisible to optical
telescopes.
   Shock waves from such explosions are thought to compress gas and
dust to create new stars.
   The survey will help determine if that theory is correct by
showing if there is a link between the location of supernovas and
regions of star formation, Becker said.
   While some stars leave nothing behind after they explode as
supernovas, other supernovas collapse into dense neutron stars,
rotating neutron stars called pulsars or even more dense objects
called black holes, which have gravity so intense that not even
light escapes.
   Becker said the survey should help astronomers learn what
proportion of supernovas become neutron stars, pulsars or black
holes because such objects generate radio signals.
   While the survey won't detect life that might exist elsewhere in
the galaxy, it could help scientists improve estimates of the odds
that such life exists, Becker said.
   ``If one wants to estimate the probability of finding
intelligent life elsewhere in our galaxy, you have to know what the
environment of our galaxy is,'' including the number of objects
that may be orbited by inhabited planets, he said.
   Recent improvements to the Very Large Array gave it a much
larger field of view, so ``it will take fewer pointings of the
telescope to map out the Milky Way,'' Becker said.
   Becker and Helfand will have 300 hours of viewing time during
the survey. They then will spend another year or two using
computers to contruct maps using the detected radio signals.
   The first 20 to 24 hours of survey-related observations will
start Thursday and end Saturday, with more intermittent
observations regularly scheduled during the next two years each
time the antennas are re-aimed, Becker said.
   The survey is financed by the University of California, the
National Science Foundation and Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory.

   A prosecutor told the Arizona Senate on
Tuesday that Gov. Evan Mecham's $80,000 loan from a protocol fund
to his car dealership was an ``intentional and wrongful act,''
while the defense acknowledged it was ``not politically smart.''
   The statements came as the Senate turned to the second of three
charges against Mecham at his impeachment trial _ misusing state
funds.
   Mecham, who has not attended the trial except when he testified
last week, said Tuesday in a radio interview that he probably will
appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court if the state Senate convicts him
in his impeachment trial.
   The governor also said that if he is acquitted and allowed to
resume his job, he will fire state Department of Public Safety
Director Ralph Milstead, one of his chief accusers in the trial.
   ``They'll probably say this is another one of those gaffes, but
a lot of the rats have come out of their holes that's been after
me, and now we know a lot more who they are,'' Mecham said. ``Quite
frankly, I'll be a lot wiser governor from here on out.''
   Mecham said if he is convicted by the Senate, ``It will
certainly not be on the basis of evidence and on that we'll go and
appeal it, of course ... probably direct to the U.S. Supreme
Court.''
   ``If they were to try to forbid me from holding office without
showing that there was some justification, I don't think they could
prevail.''
   At the trial, a Mecham campaign adviser and a deputy county
attorney testified that the $80,000 was raised by Mecham's
inaugural ball and put into a protocol fund to be used for gifts
such as Indian dolls and ashtrays for visiting dignitaries.
   Deputy Maricopa County Attorney Howard Schwartz, who helped
draft the agreement to place the money in the protocol fund, said
that when he heard about the loan, ``I personally was shocked and
initially felt betrayed.''
   ``I was very surprised and disappointed and saddened by the
entire situation ...,'' said Warner Lee, a former state attorney
general who advised the Mecham inaugural committee. ``Such an
application of the funds was never anticipated by anyone involved.''
   Schwartz and Lee acknowledged Mecham's defense lawyer's
suggestion that everyone expected the money to be invested.
   ``I don't think anyone assumed the money would be placed in a
cigar box somewhere,'' said Lee.
   Later, Mecham's former chief of staff, Jim Colter, who signed
the $80,000 check, testified that Mecham asked him not to record a
document securing the loan. Colter did not explain why Mecham would
not have wanted it recorded.
   ``I asked the governor, `Do you want this deed of trust
recorded?'' Colter recalled. ``He said, `I would rather you
wouldn't.' I don't think anything more was said.''
   Colter said he felt that the loan was ``politically unwise'' but
did not feel that any law was being broken. ``Such a thought never
entered my mind or I would have objected,'' he said.
   Earlier, after a heated debate, a senator withdrew a motion
consider the first-term Republican's expulsion from office merely
on the first count _ obstruction of justice. Sentiment in the
Senate was clearly against the move.
   ``It would be our everlasting disgrace if we do not consider all
of the evidence from both sides in such a historic and important
case,'' said Republican Sen. Jon Hays.
   Democratic Sen. Carolyn Walker said she was withdrawing the
motion because ``it appears I will be accused of depriving Gov.
Mecham of his rights.''
   Had Mecham been convicted on the first charge, the trial would
have ended because he would no longer be governor.
   The first of three broad impeachment charges alleges that Mecham
obstructed justice by trying to thwart an investigation into an
alleged death threat. The final testimony on that charge was heard
Tuesday.
   Mecham, the first U.S. governor to face an impeachment trial in
six decades, also is charged with concealing a $350,000 campaign
loan.
   Mecham is scheduled for an April 21 criminal trial on felony
charges of concealing the $350,000 loan. He also faces a May 17
recall election.
   In a low-key, 15-minute opening statement, House prosecutor
William French told senators: ``The $80,000 loan to Mecham Pontiac
was wrong.''
   Defense attorney Jerris Leonard responded that the loan broke no
law.
   ``It was not politically smart, there's no question about that
...,'' said Leonard. ``But I think the evidence will establish it
certainly wasn't evil.''
   French said Mecham's inaugural committee planned to use the
$92,000 raised by the ball to reduce Mecham's campaign debt, but
learned that a state campaign spending law might forbid it and
agreed to the protocol fund instead.
   In July 1987, French said, an $80,000 check was written on that
account to Mecham's car dealership.
   French scoffed at Mecham's oft-stated contention that he helped
the state by paying higher interest than the money would get from a
bank.
   ``The evidence will show it was not a good loan,'' said French.
``It was a bad loan because of the financial condition of Mecham
Pontiac. ... The money was loaned to Mecham Pontiac because they
had a desperate need for it.''
   Leonard, promising a return appearance to the witness stand from
Mecham, said the governor would stand by his contention that the
loan was fiscally wise and noted the loan was repaid before the
charges were filed.
   Meanwhile, a lawyer defending Mecham on the criminal charges
sought dismissal on grounds that the governor has been singled out
for prosecution because he is unpopular.
   Other Republican politicians _ including Attorney General Bob
Corbin, whose office sought the indictment _ oppose Mecham and
``they believe that the party would be better if he is out of
there,'' defense lawyer Michael Scott told Judge Michael Ryan of
Maricopa County Superior Court.
   However, prosecutor Michael Cudahy said, ``It's a crazy
allegation and there is no support for it.''
   Ryan did not immediately rule on the motion to dismiss the
charges on grounds of selective prosecution.

   While President Reagan's veto had little
chance of killing the 1988 civil rights bill, it certainly made
life uncomfortable for Republican presidential candidates George
Bush and Bob Dole.
   Both reverted to type as Congress overrode the Reagan veto, Bush
playing the totally loyal second banana, Dole dancing on both sides
of the issue.
   ``I'm going to stand with the president,'' said the vice
president, who has demonstrated in recent weeks the political plus
of sticking by your boss. At the same time, Bush was at pains to
say he thought the government should do what the bill seemed to be
doing.
   Dole said he supported the bill that Reagan opposed.
Nonetheless, he said he would ``side with the president'' if his
vote were needed to sustain the veto. The Kansas senator offered
his help from the safe distance of about 1,000 miles, as he
campaigned for survival in Wisconsin.
   Were these just statements by two politicians trying to get on
both sides of a delicate issue?
   Or was their discomfiture a symptom of something deeper, an
uneasy feeling that Reagan's legacy may be a mixed blessing for the
GOP presidential nominee next fall?
   Reagan has succeeded in maintaining a remarkable level of
popularity for more than seven years.
   But like it says on many prizes, Reagan's popularity is
redeemable only by him. It is not transferrable. In a Republican
primary, maybe, but not in a general election.
   Richard Darman, former Reagan aide, was quoted by Hedrick Smith
in his new book, ``The Power Game,'' as pointing out that
``Reagan's programmatic agenda is simply not the majority agenda.''
   According to Darman the political system tells Reagan ``Look, we
like you. You're an icon. You represent almost everything we ever
loved about America.''
   But the same system has demonstrated opposition to such Reagan
proposals as constitutional amendments to ban abortion and restore
prayer in schools, as well as his budget priorities.
   ``Anybody,'' said Darman ``who tries for too long to run against
the majority simply will not hold power. To govern, a president has
to move toward the middle.''
   But Reagan's presidency is winding down. Governing is a problem
for his successors.
   And figuring out how to separate themselves from the less
popular parts of the Reagan agenda is a particular problem for
Republicans.
   ``I think the vice president made a serious mistake,'' said Rep.
Bill Green, R-N.Y., who voted to override. ``Apparently he felt
caught between his basic support of civil rights and his loyalty to
the president _ and went with loyalty.''
   ``The vice president is in a box,'' said former party chairman
Richard Richards, a Bush supporter. ``If he deviates one iota,
there are some right-wing nuts out there who will say he cannot
carry on the Reagan revolution.''
   ``I don't think you're going to find him looking for areas of
disagreement,'' said Peter Teeley, a Bush aide. ``The fact is, six
months ago everybody was writing that George Bush had to disagree
with the president in order to get the nomination. Everyone now
sees that that was a myth.''
   No question that Bush's identification with Reagan was a big
plus for the vice president in the New Hampshire primary and in the
South, two areas where the president's popularity is very high.
   Likewise, it dragged Bush down in Iowa, South Dakota and
Minnesota, Midwest states where Reagan's magic has faded.
   Civil rights is an area where Reagan has always taken a narrow,
legalistic view.
   To the president, the bill did not assure rights for potential
victims of discrimination, so much as it allowed the government to
intrude into areas where it didn't belong.
   He called it ``a dangerous bill'' and a Washington ``power
grab.''
   At high noon on Tuesday the Senate overrode Reagan's veto and a
few hours later the House followed suit.
   At issue was legislation that would cut off federal aid to
organizations or institutions, any part of which discriminated
against minorities, women, the elderly or the disabled. Four years
ago, the Supreme Court, in a case involving Grove City College in
Pennsylvania, ruled that existing law only permitted the cutoff of
funds for programs in which discrimination was demonstrated.
   Speaking to a black audience, Bush said the bill was
``imperfect. The imperfections should be corrected.'' But then he
went on to say he supported its purpose: ``The federal government
must require that organizations that get tax dollars comply with
our civil rights laws.''
   Dole got himself in a terrible tangle.
   ``I have always supported legislation to overturn Grove City to
restore the broad civil rights coverage that existed prior to that
case,'' he said.
   Campaigning in Wisconsin, the day of the vote, Dole said he
would support overriding the veto if he were in Washington. But he
added, ``If it were the deciding vote, I would side with the
president.''
   At any rate, he wasn't in Washington.

<HEAD>Eastern Airlines Says Judge's Ruling `Gravely Dangerous'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Eastern Airlines is telling a federal judge
that his order prohibiting the carrier from selling its East Coast
air shuttle service plunges the financially troubled company into
even deeper problems.
   The airline asked U.S. District Judge John H. Pratt on Tuesday
to reverse his own March 10 contempt finding against Eastern and
allow it to begin taking steps to sell its profitable shuttle
operation.
   The company also asked the judge to partially rescind penalties
that he levied againts Eastern on Monday, including the threat of
future $10,000-a-day fines.
   In its court papers, Eastern said that forbidding the shuttle
deal ``will tie the hands of management struggling to cope with
ongoing financial losses of a troubled company.''
   The documents, filed by John J. Gallagher, a lawyer for Eastern,
called the judge's orders ``unprecedented and gravely dangerous to
Eastern.''
   An attorney for the union that has sought to block the shuttle
deal said the labor group would continue its struggle.
   ``This argument that somehow they're paralyzed is really aimed
more at trying to get the sympathy of the court,'' said John
Edmond, a lawyer for the International Association of Machinists
and Aerospace Workers. ``The IAM has never attempted to stop
Eastern from running a business.''
   Under the stay Eastern has requested, the airline would be
allowed to proceed with its efforts to sell the shuttle but would
not be permitted to complete the deal until the entire case was
decided. In the meantime, Eastern would face no penalties.
   The case stems from a bitter dispute between Eastern and its
largest union, the machinists.
   The machinists, who represent 12,000 Eastern mechanics and other
ground workers, have opposed various efforts by Eastern and its
parent company, Texas Air Corp., to sell some of Eastern's most
valuable assets.
   Corporate officials say Eastern needs the cash generated by the
asset sales, but the unions say the sales are designed to reduce
the airline's size and labor's clout.
   In the proposed deal, Eastern would sell the shuttle to a new
Texas Air subsidiary for $225 million. The shuttle flies between
Boston, New York and Washington, D.C.
   Eastern lost $182 million last year.
   Last July 2, Pratt ordered Eastern to refrain from making any
changes in the working conditions of the union's members. In
issuing his contempt finding, the judge ruled that Eastern violated
that stricture by trying to sell the shuttle.
   The disputes between Eastern and Texas Air and their unions are
gaining increased attention from Congress. On Tuesday, Sen. Frank
Lautenberg, D-N.J., chairman of the Senate Appropriations
transportation subcommittee, and three other senators introduced a
resolution urging the Department of Transportation to investigate
Eastern and Texas Air.
   A similar bill, introduced in the House on March 10, has 28
sponsors.

<HEAD>OSHA Inspectors to Check Shop Floor, Not Just Office Records</HEAD>

   Federal manufacturing safety inspectors will
begin actually checking the factory floor rather than just office
records, in a major Reagan administration policy reversal on the
eve of congressional hearings.
   Beginning next week, Occupational Safety and Health
Administration inspectors will start ``walking through''
high-hazard areas of every factory they enter instead of just
looking at plant office records of job illnesses and injuries, the
agency said Tuesday.
   The change will take effect Monday, a day before the Senate
begins hearings on a two-year congressional investigation into what
critics maintain has been OSHA's excessive reliance on employer
records in ferreting out job hazards.
   ``Now when we go into a plant, the inspector is going to see
what it looks like beyond the office,'' said Assistant Labor
Secretary John A. Pendergrass, who ordered the new policy. ``Our
compliance officers will see the conditions as they exist in the
work areas.''
   Pendergrass and other OSHA officials denied that the hearings,
ordered by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., chairman of the Senate
Labor and Human Resources Committee, were the impetus behind the
new policy.
   ``We've been discussing a change like this for two years, and
it's just now coming to fruition,'' said Frank White, the agency's
deputy administrator.
   In 1982 _ a year after Reagan took office _ OSHA began exempting
plants in high-hazard industries from inspections if their logs
showed injury rates that were below the nationwide average for
manufacturing.
   Ever since, unions and officials in some other federal agencies
have complained that the exemptions encouraged employers to
under-report injuries and illnesses in OSHA-required ``lost work
day'' reports in order to avoid more comprehensive plant
inspections.
   Their case was bolstered by the death of a worker from cyanide
poisoning at a film processing plant in Chicago in 1983, just six
months after OSHA had pronounced the company in compliance with
regulations based on an examination of its injury and illness logs.
   A later inspection of the plant itself showed widespread health
and safety hazards in violation of the law, resulting in a
recommendation for criminal prosecution of some of the company's
officials.
   ``That case has been in everybody's mind,'' Pendergrass said
Tuesday. ``It's something we don't want to happen again.''
   He said the walk-through examinations in addition to the
document inspections at some 2,000 plants each year will give the
agency ``better confidence on what the conditions are on the shop
floor.''
   OSHA officials tried to downplay the significance of the change,
describing it as a logical next step in a crackdown on job safety
violators that began two years ago when William E. Brock became
labor secretary.
   Soon after taking office, Brock ordered a 10-fold increase in
the fines levied for OSHA violations, including those classified as
``willful'' discrepancies in employer records. Brock said the
higher fines would act as a deterrent, keeping more companies
honest.
   Instead of levying fines in the thousands of dollars, OSHA began
seeking penalties in the hundreds of thousands and, in a few cases,
millions of dollars. It also began treating each instance of an
alleged violation as a separate charge, instead of lumping them
together.
   Margaret Seminario, assistant director of the AFL-CIO's
occupational health and safety division, said Tuesday that the
agency began losing ``the Reagan ideology'' two years ago.
   ``But until this, they really hadn't put in anything else,'' she
said of the inspection order.
   OSHA officials disagreed, saying they have done a lot more in
the past two years in reducing their dependence solely on employer
records.
   For example, they said, the agency two years ago began expanding
the records checks to include some random inspections of job
floors. Inspectors two years ago also were required to start
validating employer injury and illness reports by comparing them
with other records such as first aid logs and workers' compensation
claims.

<HEAD>Civil Rights Bill Called Cure for Bias `Epidemic'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Supporters of a civil rights bill enacted over
President Reagan's veto say it will help cure ``an epidemic of
discrimination'' that followed a 1984 Supreme Court decision
limiting federal protection for many groups.
   ``Discrimination in federally funded institutions is occurring
at accelerated rates,'' Rep. Don Edwards, D-Calif., said Tuesday as
the House joined the Senate in overriding Reagan's veto of the
Civil Rights Restoration Act.
   Edwards, chairman of the House Judiciary subcommittee on civil
rights, said the Education Department closed or suspended hundreds
of sex bias cases after the court ruling.
   ``Heaven knows how many thousands of complaints have not even
been filed,'' he said. ``We are facing an epidemic of
discrimination.''
   Both chambers of Congress came up Tuesday with the two-thirds
majorities needed to override Reagan's veto _ the ninth such rebuff
he has suffered since taking office. The votes were 73-24 in the
Senate and 292-133 in the House.
   Even as the voting occurred, Reagan was calling the bill ``a
power grab'' by the federal government. But the White House later
issued a statement acknowledging the override and saying the
administration would ``work to implement the new law.''
   Congress was tied in knots for four years over how to handle the
high court ruling that only specific programs or activities
receiving federal aid had to comply with four major civil rights
laws protecting women, minorities, the elderly and the handicapped.
   Lawmakers finally settled on a restoration act that bars
discrimination by entire institutions, government agencies and some
corporations that receive any federal aid. If a college athletic
department discriminates, for example, the federal government can
cut off aid to the whole school _ even if that specific department
received no assistance.
   Ralph Neas, executive director of the Leadership Conference on
Civil Rights, called the override ``a bipartisan reaffirmation of
civil rights.'' The conference, a 185-member coalition of major
religious organizations and groups representing labor, women,
minorities and senior citizens, was the moving force behind the
bill.
   Education Department spokesman Michael Jackson said the
department had closed or narrowed more than 200 sex bias cases
through 1986 as a result of the court decision. ``We simply don't
know yet'' what their fate will be, he said. ``We're going to have
to assess what our responsibilities are.''
   Marcia Greenberger, managing attorney of the National Women's
Law Center, urged the individuals who filed those complaints to
``bring them back to the attention of the government and ask for
the protection that the country thought the law provided to them
all along.''
   Reagan and his congressional allies contended that the act would
infringe on religious liberty and expand federal control of the
private sector. They supported a less sweeping alternative that
would have gotten more religious schools and corporations off the
regulatory hook.
   But even some Republicans said they were sorry Reagan had vetoed
the bill.
   Sen. Lowell Weicker, R-Conn., who has a retarded son, harked
back to earlier days when such people were relegated to ``dark
corners ... to the darkness of despair, to being a nothing in
America.''
   ``This legislation is about your neighbor. It's about flesh and
blood,'' he said. ``It says we're not going to subsidize
discrimination. We don't want to see those dark corners anymore.
... We don't want to revisit the past.''
   Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., said Reagan was the first
president to veto a civil rights measure since Andrew Johnson more
than 100 years ago.
   A number of lawmakers, including some GOP leaders who supported
the veto, castigated the conservative Moral Majority group for
spreading what they called misinformation and distortions.
   They said they had received hundreds of calls from people saying
they had been told the bill would force their churches to employ
homosexual drug addicts with AIDS as youth pastors and bar church
contributions by Social Security recipients.
   ``No bit of legislation is important enough ... to put out
falsehoods under the name of religion to the American people. I
find if reprehensible,'' said Rep. Bill Hefner, D-N.C., a Baptist
gospel singer with ties to religious communities around the country.
   The restoration act says entire institutions and government
agencies must not discriminate if any program or activity within
them receives federal aid. Entire corporations are covered if they
provide a public service such as health care or if the aid goes to
the business as a whole, as in the Chrysler Corp. bailout.
   Jerry C. Nims, president of Moral Majority, predicted ``dire''
consequences from the law and said it is likely to be ``the major
political issue for evangelicals in the 1988 elections.''
   ``If enough people are not voted into office to change what's
occurred, we will have entered the moral dark ages,'' Nims said.
   Farmers receiving crop subsidies, people using food stamps and
other individuals receiving federal assistance are not subject to
regulation under the new law. An institution's refusal to perform
or pay for abortions will not be considered discrimination against
women under the law.
   The Supreme Court decision applied specifically to Title IX of
the 1972 Education Amendments barring sex discrimination in
federally funded education programs. But the precedent was
interpreted also to cover the 1964 Civil Rights Act barring racial
discrimination in federally assisted programs; the 1973
Rehabilitation Act barring discrimination against the handicapped
in any program or activity receiving federal aid; and the 1975 Age
Discrimination Act barring employment discrimination against older
people.

<HEAD>Capitol Police: Weapons Seizures Are Mostly Handbag Tear Gas</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT M. ANDREWS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senior police officers say the dramatic
increase in weapons seizures at the Capitol last year involved not
lethal guns or knives but small canisters of chemical sprays that
women visitors carry in their handbags for self-protection.
   House Sergeant at Arms Jack Russ created a stir recently when he
reported that Capitol Police confiscated 1,162 weapons in 1987, a
startling 147 percent increase over seizures in the previous year.
   But Capitol Police Chief Frank Kerrigan said in an interview
that the 1,162 cited by Russ were all canisters of Mace or other
brands of non-lethal chemical sprays, some in lipstick-style
containers, that are used to immobilize would-be attackers.
   Chemical sprays are illegal throughout the District of Columbia,
including the Capitol, where police classify them as weapons
subject to seizure and destruction.
   In fact, Kerrigan said, 1,270 weapons were seized last year and
self-defense sprays accounted for the vast majority of them.
Seizures of guns actually declined by 50 percent last year,
Kerrigan said.
   Russ said he must have misinterpreted data he obtained from the
Capitol Police when he reported that the 1,162 spray seizures
represented all weapons confiscated last year.
   Russ cited that figure at a House Appropriations subcommittee
hearing to justify his request for $18.5 million to tighten
security on the House side of the Capitol, arguing that police face
a growing threat of violent attacks.
   Rep. Vic Fazio, D-Calif., chairman of the House panel, said Russ
left the impression that most of the weapons seizures last year
involved guns, which ``probably was a misimpression'' on the part
of the sergeant at arms.
   But Fazio said his subcommittee intends to take a much closer
look at the issue, in consultation with the Senate, before making
any decisions. ``We won't be stampeded,'' he said.
   Rep. Jerry Lewis of California, ranking Republican on the House
subcommittee, said he didn't know whether Russ had manipulated the
weapons figures to attract support for his security plan, but said
any such proposals should be studied with caution.
   ``They're pushing very hard to increase security everywhere up
here,'' Lewis said. ``We must protect ourselves in this modern age
of terrorism, but I tend to resist any unnecessary steps that would
hinder the public's access to the Capitol.''
   Of the 1987 total, Kerrigan said, the 1,162 chemical spray
seizures represent a sharp increase over the previous year, when
470 such sprays were confiscated.
   The rest of last year's total included guns, knives and other
potentially deadly weapons, including clubs, blackjacks and brass
knuckles, and non-lethal stun guns, which knock out their victims
with electrical shocks, authorities said.
   Stun guns aside, the total of deadly weapons seized last year
increased by only three over those confiscated in 1986, Kerrigan
said. Last year's total included only 14 guns, exactly half the 28
that were seized in 1986, the police said.
   Kerrigan said the escalating weapons seizures probably reflect
improved use of metal detectors in the Capitol building and six
nearby office buildings, better training of police officers and
more thorough searches of visitors.
   Considering the sharp increase in discovery of the chemical
spray canisters, Kerrigan said, ``It could be that people are more
aware of the need to protect themselves.''
   Kerrigan said 63 people were prosecuted at the Capitol last year
on illegal weapons charges, compared with 50 people in 1986.
Generally, visitors carrying deadly weapons are arrested but those
with chemical sprays are not, he said.
   Asked by Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., how many visitors enter the
Capitol with ``evil intent,'' Senate Sergeant at Arms Harry Henry
Giugni said he didn't know. But he recalled that an 85-year-old
woman from Tennessee was found carrying a handgun ``that would have
blown up in her hand if she'd tried to fire it.''
   Giugni said the woman told Capitol Police that her hometown
sheriff had advised her to take a gun if she planned to visit
Washington.

   The Agriculture Department wants to hire a new
editor for its single-sheet publication, Ag AM, which provides up
to two dozen or so news blurbs daily for agency brass. Pay: $33,218
a year to start, with a top of $60,683.
   So far there have been 41 applicants, including some USDA
information specialists who see an opportunity to boost their
career prospects.
   The Ag AM report is issued five days a week, Monday through
Friday, except on federal holidays, of course. Mostly it consists
of single paragraphs summarizing stories from newspapers, wire
services and news magazines.
   Ed Curran, who retired in 1984 after 20 years working for the
department's Office of Information, was privy to the inside
workings of Ag AM since it began during the Carter Administration.
   Now publisher of his own private newsletter, Curran offers a
look at the history of the publication and how it grew.
   Someone in USDA thought the White House practice of providing
President Carter with daily news summaries would be good for
then-Agriculture Secretary Bob Bergland, Curran said in his latest
issue.
   At first the daily summaries were sent only to the secretary and
his office staff. But Bergland, who had read the news blurbs,
``began talking about things'' in the news that were not known to
senior aides, including the deputy secretary and assistant
secretaries.
   So the press run of Ag AM was increased, and the information
office staffer who was responsible for its publication had to begin
work earlier, by 6 a.m., for example, instead of the later regular
starting time.
   ``By the time the Reagan administration came upon the scene, Ag
AM was a staple at USDA,'' Curran said. Being on the offical list
to get one was ``sort of like the government equivalent of a key to
the executive washroom.''
   The daily press run was increased to 100 copies, to take care of
the demand from all the deputy assistant secretaries,
administrators of agencies and staff economists.
   Meanwhile, the bureaucrats in the USDA's information office
heard on the grapevine that Agriculture Secretary John R. Block
``was so smitten with Ag AM that he demanded copies to be telexed
to him when he was on trips,'' Curran said. However, Block's
successor, Richard E. Lyng, ``could care less'' about the news
sheet, he added.
   ``One thing bureaucrats learn early in the game is that when
something has the sweet smell of success about it, get behind it
with all you've got,'' Curran said. ``So, why not devote more time
to Ag AM? Make it a full-time job.''
   Curran wryly observed that the information office, meanwhile,
scuttled its long-standing weekly Farm Paper Letter, which was
``the department's main contact with the nation's farm magazine
editors and farm editors of its daily newspapers.''
   Curran named his twice-monthly newsletter the Farm Paper Letter,
after the publication he wrote during his 20-year USDA career.
   Today, 100 copies of Ag AM are delivered to Lyng's office area,
alone, Curran said. In all, the press run is 350 copies a day.
   ``This from an outfit that's vowed to save us money,'' he said.
   Dave Lane, director of the Office of Information, told The
Associated Press it may take some time to select a new full-time Ag
AM editor (the previous editor died earlier this year).
   Was there any consideration given to canceling Ag AM? No, Lane
said. Why not?
   ``I guess because of the ... importance of that publication to
inform our top officials,'' he said. ``It's one of the most widely
distributed of all the things that we put out.''
   Besides the copies distributed within USDA here, the daily news
blurbs are now sent electronically to universities, state
agriculture departments and other government offices. The report is
also available to private users of USDA's electronic information
system.

<HEAD>Report Fuels Debate On Whether To Continue Steel Import Quotas</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BARKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Advocates of continued trade protection for
the American steel industry are citing a new congressional study
concluding that quotas can't be blamed for last year's steel price
increases.
   The Congressional Research Service said in a 23-page report
Tuesday that last year's steel price hike of about 4.7 percent
probably had more to do with changes in the exchange rate than with
the Reagan administration's import restraints.
   The report comes in the last full year of the administration's
program of signing agreements with Japan, South Korea and other
major steel-exporting nations to curb the flow of subsidized
foreign steel into the United States.
   The five-year program ends in September 1989, and big steel
companies are already pushing for commitments from Congress and
presidential contenders on whether the import barriers will be
extended.
   Imports account for about 21 percent of the American steel
market, down from nearly 26 percent when the quotas began in late
1984.
   Opposing continuing the quotas are American companies that rely
on imported steel and which claim that the Reagan program has
stifled competition, raised prices and caused harmful shortages.
   Erwin L. Klein, president of the American Institute for Imported
Steel, said in December that it would be ``improper for more
government intervention to determine the future of the American
steel market and the United States economy. Instead, we believe
free enterprise must prevail.''
   The institute represents 70 steel importers in the United States.
   The congressional report, however, said changes in exchange
rates have helped raise the price of steel imports by about 4.5
percent, nearly identical to the price rise in the domestic
industry. That ``suggests that there is considerable competition in
the U.S. market,'' the report said.
   The report said many countries covered by the Reagan plan appear
not to have filled their quotas last year. ``The argument can be
made that domestic steel buyers were able to obtain as much
imported steel as they wanted before being confronted by the import
barriers,'' it said.
   The report was released by Sen. John Heinz, R-Pa., who had
pushed the White House for import relief before the program began
in 1984.
   Heinz said the report ``ought to be the final American-made nail
in the coffin for these nagging complaints'' that the steel program
has boosted domestic prices.
   The Congressional Research Service said, ``Nothing in this
report should be taken as an argument in favor of, or opposed to
the import restraints of the president's steel program.'' It said
the report's goal was merely to evaluate claims that the quotas
caused prices to rise.
   David E. Levy, spokesman for the American Institute for Imported
Steel, reiterated the group's position against extending the
quotas, but said he had not seen the report and could not comment
on it.

<TEXT>
   From copyrights to civil rights, Congress has
overridden nine of the 63 vetoes President Reagan has exercised
since he took office in 1981.
   This gives Reagan a better batting average than his last
Republican predecessor, President Ford but not as good a one as
President Carter, who had Democratic majorities in both houses of
Congress.
   Ford, with the opposition party controlling both the House and
Senate, sent up 66 vetoes and had 12 of them, or 18 percent,
knocked down.
   Carter vetoed 31 bills and had only two of them overridden, well
under 10 percent.
   Counting Tuesday's override of his civil rights bill veto,
Reagan has struck out 14 percent of the times he has used his
constitutional power to disapprove legislation.
   Reagan has faced Democratic control in the House throughout his
more than seven years in office. The Senate, however, was under
Republican control from 1981 until last year.
   It takes a two-thirds majority of both houses to overcome a
presidential veto.
   Records of the White House executive clerk's office show that
five Reagan vetoes have been sustained. In the other 49 cases, the
question of an override was not put to a vote.
   Once, Reagan squeaked through by one vote. That was on June 5,
1986, when the Senate sustained a presidential veto allowing a
weapons sale to Saudi Arabia to proceed. The count was 66-34, just
shy of the 67 votes needed for a two-thirds majority with all
senators voting.
   On another occasion, it took nearly eight months to round up the
votes to block the House from overriding the president's veto of
trade legislation curbing textile, apparel and shoe imports. Reagan
vetoed the bill on Dec. 17, 1985. The House put off action until
next year and it was not until Aug. 6, 1986, that it voted. The
count was 276-149, or eight votes short of the two thirds needed to
override.
   Tuesday's House and Senate votes marked the 101st time in U.S.
history that a presidential veto has been overridden. There have
been 2,452 vetoes, beginning with the administration of George
Washington.
   Andrew Johnson had the worst veto record in history. The
post-Civil War president vetoed 29 bills and was overridden 15
times.
   The bills previously put into law over Reagan's veto were:
   _An act to amend the manufacturing clause of the copyright law,
vetoed July 8, 1982.
   _A $14.2 billion supplemental appropriation for the fiscal year
ending Sept. 30, 1982, vetoed on Aug. 28, 1982.
   _An act authorizing a transfer of federal land in Lane County,
Ore., vetoed Oct. 19, 1983.
   _An act to authorize continuation of a program of water
resources research, vetoed Feb. 21, 1984.
   _An act revising authorization laws governing the National
Institutes of Health and National Research Institutes, vetoed Nov.
8, 1985.
   _An act providing economic sanctions against the white minority
government of South Africa, vetoed Sept. 26, 1986.
   _The Water Quality Act of 1987, a $20 billion anti-pollution
measure, vetoed Jan. 30, 1987.
   _The Federal Aid Highway Act of 1987, an $88 billion highway and
mass transit measure, vetoed March 27, 1987.

<HEAD>Native American Newspapers Struggling To Establish Independence
From Tribes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROLYN S. CARLSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It has been more than 160 years since the first
American Indian newspaper was published and its editor clashed with
tribal leaders, and newspapers on the reservation still struggle
for their independence today.
   Elias Boudinot opened the Cherokee Phoenix on Feb. 21, 1828, in
New Echota, Ga., and resigned four years later rather than accept
censorship from the Cherokees' primary chief.
   Things haven't changed much in 160 years, journalists reported
at a meeting of the Native American Press Association. Tribal
leaders still are not convinced of the value of objective reporting
on tribal politics and other news.
   Although some tribal constitutions had free press provisions as
early as the mid-1800s, the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment
rights did not extend to the reservations until 1968, when Congress
passed the Indian Bill of Rights.
   Today's Indian journalists, the first generation to try to
exercise those rights on the reservation, are hampered by
reservation poverty that limits advertising revenue and forces
tribal governments to underwrite the newspapers.
   Ten financially self-sufficient newspapers are operating, most
begun in the last decade ``precipitated by the need for editorial
independence,'' said Richard LaCourse, a Yakima Indian writing a
book on the Native American press.
   The rest of the 464 Indian newspapers and bulletins on
reservations and in urban Indian communities are owned by the
tribes _ and controlled by tribal leaders who often interfere with
news operations, LaCourse said.
   Tribal leaders have fired editors for taking opposing sides in
elections or in editorials; cut off newspaper funds; forced the
hiring of their unqualified relatives; excluded reporters from
meetings and suppressed stories by threatening editors and
reporters, LaCourse said.
   At the NAPA meeting last week, one editor reported being ordered
by tribal leaders not to report the conviction of one leader on a
child molestation charge.
   The editor said she agreed because, as a single parent, she felt
she could not risk losing what was one of the few full-time jobs
she could find on the reservation.
   A reporter for one of 25 Indian-owned radio stations said her
tribal leaders once took over the station for several hours to air
their views on a subject they thought the station had not covered
sufficiently.
   Tim Giago, a co-founder of NAPA who owns two independent tribal
newspapers, says the interference will continue until journalists
buy their publications from the tribes and operate them as
profit-making businesses.
   ``If the tribe is paying your salary, why should they let you
say anything that is going to undermine their position?'' he asked
in a telephone interview from his offices in Rapid City, S.D.
   Because his LaKota Times of Martin, S.D., and Ojibwe Times of
Bemidji, Minn., rely on advertising revenue, Giago said, ``We have
the freedom to criticize the tribal government. My responsibilities
are to my readers. I'm not beholden to the tribal government.''
   An example of tribal leaders' influence was the Navajo Times
Today, a one-time weekly that became the first and only daily
Native American newspaper in 1984 and was closed in 1987.
   Shortly after his election, tribal Chairman Peter MacDonald
ordered an audit that found the newspaper was $750,000 in debt. He
shut it down and fired its 49-member staff.
   The Times reopened as a weekly with a new, mostly non-Indian
staff several months later.
   ``The main reason the Times was killed was because we couldn't
be controlled,'' former editor and publisher Mark Trahant, who made
the Times a daily newspaper, said in a speech to about 150 NAPA
members.
   Trahant, an investigative reporter for the Arizona Republic in
Phoenix, said the Times apparently caused animosity when it
sponsored a tribal election campaign debate that degenerated into a
name-calling shouting match.
   MacDonald did not return a telephone call to tribal headquarters
in Window Rock, Ariz., seeking comment.
   The first Indian publisher, Boudinot, clashed with Cherokee
chief John Ross, who wanted to fight the relocation law that
eventually forced the Cherokees and four other tribes to give up
their East Coast lands and move West.
   Ross tried to fire him but Boudinot resigned first, in the
summer of 1832, and moved his family to Oklahoma in 1838 in advance
of the ``Trail of Tears,'' when 4,000 Cherokees died on a forced
march from Appalachia.
   On June 23, 1839, in Park Hill, Okla., Boudinot was stabbed and
hacked to death in what was described then as a revenge killing.

<HEAD>Japanese Beef And Citrus Curbs Criticized by American Officials</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japanese curbs on beef and citrus imports are
costing consumers in Tokyo two to four times what their American
counterparts pay and should come down, U.S. farm and trade
officials say.
   ``It seems to us the Japanese consumer should have a right to
choose the products at a price that is much better, and they would
if the quotas were eliminated,'' Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng
said Tuesday.
   Lyng and U.S. Trade Representative Clayton K. Yeutter said at a
news conference, however, that thus far the Japanese have not
budged on quotas that limit imports of American beef and citrus.
   ``We still have to hear from the Japanese on their willingness
to liberalize beef and citrus,'' Lyng told the session, called to
spotlight the March 31 expiration date of a beef and citrus
agreement with the Japanese.
   Under the 4-year-old agreement, the United States has not
challenged the quotas. But officials are now saying that it is time
for them to end.
   In response, Japanese officials say that lowering the barriers
would bring on a torrent of low-priced American products that would
wipe out their home country's beef and citrus sector.
   The two American officials produced charts showing that American
navel oranges that sold for 33 cents each in Washington on March 1
were selling for 65 cents each in Tokyo.
   Grapefruits selling for 32 cents each in Washington sold for 73
cents in Tokyo on the same day, they said. They said consumers in
the nation's capital were paying $4.99 a pound for strip sirloin
while consumers in Japan's capital were paying $20.56 a pound for
comparable steak.
   It remains unclear whether eliminating the import curbs would
bring on unemployment among Japanese cattle ranchers and citrus
growers, Yeutter said. He said it would depend ``on whether our
Japanese friends are resilient'' enough to cope with intensified
competition.
   ``If it did mean some structural adjustment, that's the price we
pay for a free and open trading system,'' Yeutter said. ``We've had
some adjustment, too.''
   One option open to the United States would be to seek a ruling
against the Japanese for unfair trade practices under the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the officials said. They said
another would be to start action possibly leading to retaliation
against the Japanese barriers.

   A group of women serving long prison terms at
an underground facility in Lexington, Ky., allege in a suit that
they are being treated inhumanely because of their political
beliefs.
   The suit in U.S. District Court in Washington, filed by civil
liberties groups on behalf of the five inmates at the Lexington
Control Unit, names Attorney General Edwin Meese III and eight
other federal officials.
   It seeks the immediate transfer of the inmates from the
high-security facility to the general population of a federal
women's prison.
   Opened in November 1986, the ``small basement facility'' has
``virtually no natural light'' and is illuminated 24 hours a day by
fluorescent lights, said the suit, prepared by the National Prison
Project of the American Civil Liberties Union and other attorneys.
   The women, the suit said, are monitored continuously by staff
and video cameras, have no opportunity to participate in any of the
activities available to the general prison population and are
subjected to random strip searches.
   ``We believe the women's lives are in danger,'' said Susan
Waysdorf, a spokeswoman for civil libertarians supporting the suit.
``They're beginning to experience signs of behavior modification,
general disorientation, vision problems, loss of appetite,
sleeplessness.''
   Among the inmates are Silvia Baraldini, convicted of
racketeering and conspiracy in aiding a $1.6 million Brink's
armored car heist in Nyack, N.Y., that left a guard and two police
officers dead. Another inmate at Lexington is Susan Rosenberg,
linked by law enforcement officers to the same bungled Brink's
robbery.
   Baraldini, serving a 40-year term, was transferred to Lexington
after refusing to be interviewed by an FBI agent, the suit said.
   Rosenberg, serving a 58-year term for possession of weapons and
explosives in connection with a 1985 police raid in New Jersey, was
told that she would be confined to the unit until she changes her
political beliefs, the suit alleges.
   The U.S. Bureau of Prisons said in October it will phase out the
unit, the only high-security unit for women in the federal prison
system.
   A new medium- and high-security facility for women will be
opened in June in Marianna, Fla., and the phase-out in Lexington
will be completed shortly thereafter, said bureau of prisons
spokeswoman Kathryn Morse. She declined to comment on the suit.
   ``The primary purpose for the creation of the unit was to
confine prisoners whose political associations and affiliations
were determined to pose a security threat,'' said the suit, which
alleges violation of the women's constitutional rights. ``All the
women in the unit are suffering psychological and physical harm as
a direct consequence of their isolated confinement in this
underground segregation unit.''
   When civil liberties groups began to expose Lexington as a
``political prison, federal officials hurriedly brought in two
other women serving long sentences,'' a coalition of civil
libertarians said in a statement about the Lexington unit.
   One of the women brought in later, Sylvia Brown, serving a
27-year term for probation violation and escaping from a federal
prison, was told that her release from the unit would depend on her
lack of interaction with the political activists, the suit said.
   Baraldini, Rosenberg and Brown filed the suit.

   Sen. Paul Simon, calling himself an
``underdog fighting for the underdog,'' says he hopes Wisconsin's
progressive political tradition can carry him to victory in the
state's April 5 primary.
   Simon, who won the Democratic primary in his home state of
Illinois last week, needs another victory to keep his candidacy
alive. While he did not predict a win here, he said he expects a
strong finish.
   ``I grew up in the progressive tradition,'' said Simon. ``I'm an
underdog who's fighting for the underdog.''
   Simon appeared at a news conference at a shopping center built
adjacent to the Allis-Chalmers Corp. plant, a once-mighty farm
equipment company which filed for bankruptcy reorganization last
year.
   ``We have to restore and revitalize our manufacturing base,''
Simon said, noting how high paying jobs at the factory have
disappeared while low paying service jobs at the shopping center
have grown.
   The senator sprinkled his comments with references to former
Wisconsin Sen. Robert LaFollette, founder of the Progressive Party,
who Simon said ``stood up to individual and corporate greed.''
   Simon said he would try to stop the erosion of the manufacturing
sector by offering tax breaks for companies that create jobs while
removing tax incentives for companies that move production overseas.
   Simon flew to Washington earlier in the day, where he joined the
successful majority in the Senate in voting to override President
Reagan's veto of a sweeping civil rights bill.
   ``It's another indication of the insensitivity of the
administration to women, to people with disabilities, to
minorities,'' Simon said of the veto.
   Simon has criticized the Reagan administration's sending of
troops to Hnduras.
   ``We should use tools of diplomacy rather than weapons of war,''
Simon said. ``Both sides should concentrate on working out their
differences at the negotiating table, not on the battlefield.''

<TEXT>
   Sen. Bob Dole, all but knocked out of the
Republican presidential running by Vice President George Bush, says
he needs a comeback _ and Wisconsin is just the place to start it.
   ``This is a very important state,'' Dole told the Milwaukee
Rotary Club Tuesday. ``Voters in this state are going to have an
impact. In my case, I've got a big comeback to make _ it may as
well start here.''
   The Kansas senator made his remarks while wrapping up a
three-day visit to the state, which will hold its presidential
primary April 5.
   Vice President George Bush has an overwhelming lead in the
delegate totals, but Dole said he hopes voters in Wisconsin will
look past those numbers and examine the issues.
   ``I hope people will take a hard look at all of us,'' he said.
``I'm prepared to answer all the hard questions.''
   In his speech to the business people, Dole stressed his campaign
theme of a spending freeze to curb the federal deficit.
   ``When that's in place, then we can go down program by
program,'' he said. ``I believe I'm the one candidate who can sit
down with members of both parties and hammer out a deficit
reduction package.''
   Dole outlined similar themes earlier in a speech to students and
teachers at Oak Creek High School.
   ``We're not voting for momentum,'' he said. ``We're voting for
candidates.''
   ``One thing I've learned in politics over the years is that
nobody's certain what's going to happen from one day to the next. I
know some in the media have already written my obituary,'' he said.
``I've read it. Sounds pretty good _ I made a gallant fight but
lost.''
   ``The last time I looked, the people in this state hadn't even
voted,'' he said. ``So I don't think we should write anything off.''
   Dole also repeated his request for a debate with Bush, a
challenge the vice president declined in Illinois.
   ``I would say to my chief opponent: You name one thing you've
done that's affected anybody in the state of Wisconsin, one thing
in the past seven years, and I'll buy you lunch.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis was the
only Democratic presidential contender to outpoll Vice President
George Bush in a Washington Post-ABC News poll, the newspaper
reported today.
   Dukakis led Bush, 50 percent to 45 percent, when voters were
asked which of the two they would vote for if the election were
held today.
   In other matchups, Jesse Jackson was outpolled by Bush 58
percent to 34 percent; Sen. Albert Gore Jr. lost out 53 percent to
40 percent; and Rep. Richard Gephardt was behind 53 percent to 40
percent, the Post said.
   New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, who is not a candidate, also lost to
Bush, 53 percent to 38 percent.
   The nationwide telephone survey of 775 registered voters had a
margin of error of 4 percentage points, the newspaper said. It was
conducted Thursday through Monday.
   Dukakis did about the same against Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas,
whose prospects of gaining the Republican nomination are seen as
slim. Dukakis polled 48 percent to Dole's 44 percent, according to
the survey.
   In the survey, Bush had the highest favorable ratings of any
contender of either party, the newspaper said. More than three out
of five registered voters, including nearly half of the Democrats,
said they had a generally favorable impression of the vice
president. That represents an increase of 11 percentage points
since an ABC News-Washington Post survey in January.
   The poll suggested the popularity of Dukakis and Jackson has
also risen. A total of 57 percent of all voters had a favorable
impression of Dukakis, the newspaper said, _ about double the
January figure.
   Fifty-three percent of all voters said they had a favorable
impression of Jackson, up from 42 percent in the January survey,
the newspaper said.

   Here are the major provisions of the Civil
Rights Restoration Act as they apply to the four statutes
protecting women, minorities, the elderly and the handicapped from
federally subsidized discrimination.
   _Compliance with the statutes is required of entire departments
and agencies of state and local governments when any part of the
department or agency receives federal aid.
   _Compliance is required throughout entire colleges, universities
and public school systems if any program or activity receives
federal aid.
   _Compliance is required of entire corporations and private
organizations if federal aid is extended to them as a whole or if
they are principally involved in providing education, health care,
housing, social services or parks or recreation. Otherwise,
compliance is limited to the plant or facility receiving the aid.
   _Ultimate beneficiaries of federal aid, such as farmers
receiving crop subsidies or people getting food stamps or Social
Security, do not come under federal civil rights regulation.
   _Small providers such as Mom and Pop grocery stores are given
flexibility in making their facilities accessible to handicapped
people.
   _People with contagious diseases or infections are considered
handicapped and protected by civil rights laws unless they pose a
direct threat to the health or safety of others or are unable to
perform their jobs.
   _Institutions and individuals are not required to perform or pay
for abortions or services relating to them. No penalties are
permitted against people seeking benefits or services related to an
abortion.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Spending big money on space age hospital
equipment is not necessarily the best way to provide quality
medical care, says the federal government's top health official.
   ``Sometimes our high-tech capability lures us into pursuing
expensive answers when less costly ones are available,'' Dr. Otis
R. Bowen said Tuesday. ``Our veneration of technology has become a
cultural blind spot that sometimes keeps us from pursuing practical
solutions to our problems.''
   The Health and Human Service secretary's remarks to a conference
of the Health Care Quality Alliance came shortly after the
28-member coalition issued a report saying cost control should stop
where ``quality of care _ and quality of life _ are adversely
affected.''
   Bowen said cost containment and quality care can co-exist.
   ``Sometimes you can save money and also improve care, like
concentrating certain procedures in hospitals that specialize in
them,'' he said. ``This not only leads to better results for the
patient, it also allows us to benefit from economies of scale.
   ``One reason today's health care is so expensive is that the
financing of that care is little more than a collection of
disincentives to practice cost-effective medicine.
   ``Hospitals, in order to attract doctors and their patients,
have bought and often duplicated the latest in medical hardware in
a kind of medical arms race.''
   He said exempting employer-paid health insurance coverage from
federal income taxes has ``encouraged employers and unions to
bargain for ever-greater first-dollar coverage in health insurance
plans.''
   ``Compounding this folly, most insurance plans cover expensive
high-tech procedures and slight preventive services,'' Bowen added.
``And all of this has made patients and their families all but
oblivious to costs, since they pay so little out of pocket.''
   Bowen said the establishment of the federal Medicare health
program for the elderly in 1965 ``created a powerful incentive for
the health care industry to develop the technology to treat the
chronic, degenerative diseases that afflict the aging.''
   While that has ``improved the quality of life for Americans of
all ages,'' Bowen said the nation has yet to face difficult
questions of how best to allocate health dollars in the modern era.
   ``Still to be decided is how much is too much,'' he said. ``How
much heroic medical care and how many procedures to keep a dying
patient alive are desirable for the patient, the family and, not
least of all, for society at large? When is such care merely
prolonging the act of dying rather than contributing to longer
life, or at least some type of quality to it?''
   Bowen is a 70-year-old physician whose first wife died in 1981
after a long battle with bone cancer and whose mother recently died
in a nursing home.
   The alliance membership includes the American Medical
Association, the Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders
Association, the Arthritis Foundation, the American Cancer Society,
the American Academy of Pediatrics and the National Council on the
Aging.

<HEAD>Defense Department To Test Civilian Workers Drawing Overseas
Assignments</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Department of Defense has decided to begin
AIDS testing on civilian workers destined for overseas assignments,
with an estimated 8,000 men and women to be affected during the
first year, officials said Tuesday.
   No date for the start of civilian screening has yet been
established, said the Pentagon, which already operates the world's
largest AIDS testing program.
   The AIDS blood test will be administered to civilian workers
during a complete physical examination, which will become mandatory
for those drawing overseas assignments.
   The approach is similar to that now used by the State
Department, the Pentagon officials said.
   In another move, Deputy Defense Secretary William H. Taft IV has
authorized the Army to draft a legislative proposal that would make
it easier to discharge service members on a medical disability if
they test positively for the AIDS virus.
   Such legislation, if ever enacted, could provide the military
with a means of discharging servicemen as soon as they test
positively for exposure, regardless of whether they're showing any
symptoms yet of the deadly disease itself.
   One way to do that, the sources explained Tuesday, is to broaden
the legal definition of a military disability.
   Currently, no individual on active duty who tests positively for
AIDS on a blood test can be discharged without showing other
medical symptoms of the disease.
   The decisions involving AIDS policies were first disclosed early
this month by defense sources who requested anonymity. The Defense
Department subsequently confirmed the actions, while insisting in a
written statement to The Associated Press that Taft had issued
``preliminary guidance'' without yet signing any final directives.
   ``The decision has been made even if a directive hasn't been
signed,'' countered one source. ``He was presented options and made
up his mind.''
   AIDS _ acquired immune deficiency syndrome _ attacks the body's
immune system and its ability to resist infection. No cure has been
found for the disease, which can be spread through sexual contact
and tainted blood.
   The Pentagon, citing the need to protect military blood
supplies, routinely tests all 2.1 million men and women on active
duty as well as all recruit applicants. A service member who tests
positively _ but who is not disabled by the disease _ is restricted
to duty inside the United States and may be limited in job
assignments.
   A recruit who tests positively is denied admission to the
military.
   Despite the massive commitment to AIDS screening, which began in
October 1985, the Pentagon has until recently focused only on
military personnel.
   According to sources, the Army has repeatedly urged AIDS testing
for all Defense Department workers as well as automatic discharge
or dismissal for those testing positively. Defense health officials
have always rebuffed those suggestions, saying they were too
far-reaching.
   The sources said Taft had finally decided to take the middle
road when it came to civilians, focusing only on those who draw
assignments outside the United States.
   The new program is expected to cost roughly $1.6 million a year,
one official said.

<TEXT>
   President Jose Napoleon Duarte
and the rightists who defeated his party in legislative and
municipal elections have declared a willingness to work together on
this country's tremendous problems.
   But the leftist guerrillas waging an 8-year-old war against the
U.S.-backed government said Tuesday the result of Sunday's vote
would make the nation ``ungovernable.'' A rebel commander said the
electoral result _ an outright majority for the rightist opposition
in the national legislature _ favors the guerrillas by giving the
people ``a clear alternative.''
   In addition to the war, El Salvador has crippling economic
problems.
   The Central Elections Council has not yet announced the
apportionment of seats in the unicameral, 60-seat National Assembly.
   But the council president, Mario Samayoa, said on Monday the
rightist Republican Nationalist Alliance, known by the Spanish
acronym Arena, got a majority of votes cast nationwide, which
assured it of a legislative majority. Local media projected Arena
would get 33 or 34 seats. The party said it had 35.
   The governing Christian Democrats had 33 seats in the outgoing
legislature. They were expected to win about 22 seats, with the
remainder going to small rightist parties. Arena also won the
mayoralties and town councils of about 200 of the country's 262
municipalities, including San Salvador.
   ``Arena is ready to work with the other parties, and with
President Duarte, so that together we might achieve the solution to
the national crisis,'' Alfredo Cristiani, president of Arena and a
legislator, said at a news conference. ``It is time to work
together on behalf of the heroic people who cast their votes
despite threats and terrorist acts.''
   The guerrillas had called for a boycott of the elections and had
stepped up urban and rural violence in the two weeks prior to the
vote. In what they called repudiation of the ``electoral farce,''
they set off three car bombs, sabotaged power lines in large parts
of the country and ordered a nationwide transport ban that they
enforced by burning more than a dozen vehicles.
   The rebels contended the elections were part of an
American-imposed counterinsurgency plan, and that they were
illegitimate in wartime.
   Despite the boycott call, about 70 percent of the 1.6 million
registered voters cast ballots. Many of them walked long distances
to do so.
   ``In the same way we have made this effort to strengthen the
democratic process, let us contribute our will and capacities to
find together the road to peace,'' Duarte told the nation in a
radio and television address Monday night.
   He said the parties in the legislature were, along with the
executive branch, ``co-responsible'' for governing. Duarte said
once final results were known, he would meet with party leaders to
search for consensus on how to solve the nation's pressing problems.
   Besides the war, which has killed 65,000 people and made
refugees out of 500,000, El Salvador's economy is crippled. Both
inflation and unemployment are estimated at about 40 percent.
   ``What is coming is that we're on the road to a power void,''
guerrilla commander Joaquin Villalobos said Tuesday on Radio
Venceremos, the clandestine rebel station. ``The country will
become ungovernable with this composition of forces.
   ``The big loser is the counterinsurgency project and the big
winner is the people, which has before it a clear alternative _ the
FMLN, organization and struggle.'' The alliance of five rebel
armies is the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, or FMLN.
   ``We must prepare to struggle decisively because today we
confront a weakened enemy and we must take advantage of that,'' he
said.
   Despite the politicans' conciliatory words, there were those who
speculated Arena would use its position in the assembly to further
erode popular support for the Chistian Democrats by opposing
government initiatives.
   Presidential elections are set for March 1989, and Arena could
benefit from making the Duarte administration appear even more
ineffectual than it has been in addressing the national crisis.

<TEXT>
   Only enough nuclear waste to carry out
experiments will be placed in the repository planned as the
nation's first resting place for defense-related radioactive
wastes, the Department of Energy says.
   The department said Tuesday it was following the National
Academy of Sciences' recommendations to test whether WIPP, the
Waste Isolation Pilot Plant in underground salt beds near Carlsbad,
is suitable as a permanent repository.
   The department also said that by June it would meet the
academy's request for a detailed five-year plan for its
experimental waste disposal program for the repository, which was
designed to contain low- and intermediate level wastes.
   Both recommendations were made in report of the WIPP Panel of
the academy's Board of Radioactive Waste Management on March 3,
about four months after scientists told Congress that water seeping
into the repository threatened its ability to safely store wastes
that would remain radioactive for hundreds of thousands of years.
   The academy panel, however, concluded that technical
uncertainties regarding brine seepage at the plant were not serious
enough to halt research at the site. Shipments of waste are to
begin arriving in October.
   Energy Department officials said Tuesday the academy report will
assist in resolving the issue of brine accumulation at the site and
will be useful in burying waste in a manner that protects of the
environment.
   About 25,000 barrels of waste will be delivered to the site in
the first 1{ years of the test, the department's Albuquerque office
said Tuesday. The department originally had planned to entomb
125,000 barrels of wastes during the next five years.

<HEAD>Republican Observers Say Bush Unlikely To Break With Reagan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MERRILL HARTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Republican Party figures say George Bush is
unlikely to break with President Reagan on a major issue, even
though Bush is trying to appeal to some groups Reagan has not
attracted.
   Bush's statement that he supports Reagan's veto of a major civil
rights bill, some observers say, reinforces the view of some that
Bush is incapable of showing any independence from Reagan.
   But Bush's top campaign spokesman, Pete Teeley, called this a
non-issue, and said the vice president's loyalty to Reagan is more
important than a show of independence.
   ``The fact is, six months ago everybody was writing that George
Bush had to disagree with the president in order to get the
nomination,'' Teeley said Tuesday. ``Everyone now sees that that
was a myth.''
   Teeley's assessment came a day after Bush, when pressed to say
whether he agreed with Reagan's veto of the sweeping civil rights
bill, told reporters that ``I'm not going to start differing'' with
Reagan after seven and a half years as vice president.
   ``I don't think that you're going to see the vice president be
critical of the president,'' Teeley said. ``I do think you are
going to see him lay out his own programs and proposals.''
   But two former GOP national chairmen said they think Bush,
sooner or later, will have to show some differences between his
views and Reagan's.
   ``The vice president is in a box,'' said one-time chairman
Richard Richards. ``If he deviates one iota, there are some
right-wing nuts out there who will say he cannot carry on the
Reagan revolution.''
   Another former chairman, Howard ``Bo'' Calloway, said that ``at
some time, there will be something pretty big where the vice
president will say, `Hey, I love the man, but I just have to
disagree.'''
   Said Mitchell Daniels, a former White House political director
for Reagan: ``It points up what you could call the veep's disease.
That is to say that every vice president must confront this
problem, especially if you're No. 2 to a very popular No. 1.
   ``With the (Republican presidential) nomination in hand and
loyalty to the president no longer the dominant or most powerful
theme, he can try his hand at establishing his own identity,''
Daniels said. ``But he must be careful that that comes through
extension, rather than exception'' to Reagan programs and policies.
   The civil rights bill, which had support from Republicans as
well as Democrats in Congress, was seen by some as a chance for
Bush to break with Reagan on an issue that Reagan was going to lose
anyway on Senate and House override votes.
   Some also saw a Bush break as necessary, given statements by
Bush and his top aides indicating that the vice president was going
to try to reach out to blacks and minorities _ groups that Reagan
failed to win in any substantial numbers in his two presidential
election victories.
   Arthur Fletcher, a black and one-time assistant secretary of
labor during the Nixon administration, said it was not essential
that Bush disagree with Reagan's veto of legislation to overturn
the Supreme Court's so-called Grove City ruling that limited
federal protection for many groups.
   He said that Bush, during an appearance before a black group
Monday night ``made a commitment that he is going to enforce all
civil rights legislation. ... The bottom line is that he was not
elected by the delegation to be the vice president, he was picked
by the president to be the vice president.''
   Bush has said on occasion that he would speak out on ``my own
vision'' of America, or ``how I would do things.'' But he also has
steadfastly insisted he would say nothing that could be taken as a
direct criticism of the president.
   Last October, for instance, Bush seemed to have gone back to his
1980 position on abortion. He said, in Iowa, that he supported
allowing the procedure to be performed in cases where the mother's
life was in danger, or in cases of rape or incest. This was a
departure from Reagan's position, which is that abortion should be
allowed only to save a mother's life.
   The Bush campaign heatedly denied that the vice president was
reverting to his position of 1980. Bush had muted his differences
with Reagan on this issue in 1984 when they ran for re-election
together.
   Richards said Tuesday that ``I think the time may well come when
he takes a different position. I'm sure that George Bush doesn't
agree 100 percent with everything that this administration does.
... He's in a tough spot.''
   Calloway agreed that Bush has been faced with ``a very real
problem from the day he announced his candidacy.'' But he said ``I

<TEXT>
   After gaining control of the
National Assembly, the rightist Republican Nationalist Alliance
could block the president's program and mount a strong challenge in
the 1989 presidential race.
   The stinging defeat in Sunday's election left President Jose
Napoleon Duarte and his Christian Democrats on the defensive.
   Duarte will be unable to enact economic reforms and the
opposition will be able to put its stamp on the national budget and
other legislation.
   The rightist party, known by its Spanish acronym Arena, is
trying to polish its image with an eye to next year's presidential
race.
   Former army Maj. Robert d'Aubuisson, the party's founder who has
been accused of links to El Salvador's death squads, is being kept
out of the limelight as much as possible. Party chairman Alfredo
Cristiani, a U.S.-educated businessman and coffee grower, now
speaks for Arena.
   Arena is trying to project an image of a conservative
organization that wants to safeguard the country's traditional
values and restore law and order. The party once was notorious for
its diatribes against the dangers of communism and alleged
interference by the United States in Salvadoran affairs.
   Both messages are still there, but the tone is more low key.
   Shortly before the elections, Cristiani told reporters: ``The
most important change the party has made was the decision to make
Arena a true political institution rather than a movement revolving
around an individual, and without the traditional `boss-ism' of
Salvadoran politics.''
   The strategy seems to have paid off, striking a chord among
Salvadorans tired of eight years of civil war with leftist rebels
that has killed about 65,000 people and devastated the
once-prosperous economy.
   Arena on Sunday wrested control of the 60-member National
Assembly away from Duarte's Christian Democrats and won a majority
of the 262 city and town mayors nationwide, including the
traditional Duarte stronghold of San Salvador.
   Final returns are not in, but projections show Arena is assured
of at least 30 seats in the new legislature. And Arena has as its
ally the National Conciliation Party, which may hold on to most of
its 12 seats.
   The Christian Democrats are expected to lose most of their
33-seat majority to Arena, which had only 13 seats in the old
assembly.
   The outcome will make Duarte's last year in office extremely
difficult, similar to his first year when the rightist opposition
also controlled the assembly. In 1984, Duarte defeated d'Aubuisson
in a presidential race and he has governed with a Christian
Democratic-controlled assembly since 1985.
   On Monday, Duarte called on all parties to act responsibly to
solve the nation's serious problems.
   D'Aubuisson lost the 1984 election, mainly because of his
reputation of having been linked to the death squads that killed
thousands of people in the first years of the war. He has denied
the accusations, including one that he masterminded the March 1981
slaying of Archbishop Oscar Arnulfo Romero, the Roman Catholic
prelate.
   D'Aubuisson, a fiery orator, held on to his seat in the
assembly, and seems sure to play a role in party councils.
   ``If we get the majority in the assembly, the next thing you'll
hear from the `fish' will be from behind bars, because that's where
we're going to put the corrupt sons of their mothers,'' d'Aubuisson
told a crowd last week. The fish is the Christian Democratic party
symbol.
   Cristiani _ a graduate of Georgetown University in Washington,
D.C. _ also won a seat in the new assembly. He promised he would
seek a consensus in the legislature on how to deal with the leftist
rebels.
   He said the rebels would be approached with a proposal for
ending the war and, if they refused, then the legislature would
back the government in declaring an offensive to wipe them out.
   Cristiani's idea is that if only a military solution is left,
then the war should be pushed to the hilt, instead of conducting it
with a series of small confrontations like now.
   ``This low intensity conflict idea should be erased,'' he said.

   A fire in a hay-filled barn killed 70
breeding horses in an adjoining stable, authorities said.
   Owner Ward Holasek said he suffered burns as he ran through the
stable to get some of the horses out. He, his wife, veterinarian
Georgene Holasek, and workers were able to save 12 horses, said
Fire Chief Randy Sorenson.
   The stable included horses brought in for breeding from as far
away as California and New York, Georgene Holasek said. Most of the
horses killed were Arabian and were worth about $10,000 apiece.
Some, including a prized breeding stallion belonging to the couple,
had even higher values, the owners said.
   The loss from Tuesday's blaze, which took 90 minutes to control,
was estimated at $1.2 million, Sorensen said.
   The cause of the fire was under investigation.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of the Environmental Protection
Agency plans to look at the ethics of using scientific data from
Nazi concentration camp experiments but is banning use of such
information in a report on a toxic gas, an agency official says.
   EPA Administrator Lee M. Thomas learned in a letter from about
20 EPA employees Friday that data from experiments on concentration
camp prisoners were included in an outside consultant's draft
report on phosgene gas, Thomas' chief of staff Craig DeRemer said
Tuesday.
   ``As soon as we got the letter ... the administrator said,
`There's no reason to proceed with that information in the report.
We don't need this data. Let's just not use this and then let's
look at the broader issue,''' DeRemer said.
   Thomas plans a broad review ``to look at the ethical issues on
using this kind of data,'' DeRemer said. ``It's sort of a new issue
that we haven't dealt with before.
   ``There may be some arguments on the other side,'' he added.
``If there is data available, no matter if it was raised in
questionable means, some people might argue that if it's for the
good of humanity we should use it.''
   The consultant's study was designed to determine whether EPA's
computer-generated predictions on how phosgene gas would affect
humans were in line with what would actually happen due to exposure
to the toxic chemical.
   Phosgene gas in high concentrations was used as a weapon in
World War I and 52 prisoners were exposed to it in 1943 and 1944 by
the Nazis to test a possible antidote, The New York Times reported
in today's editions.
   Four of the prisoners exposed at Fort Ney near Strasbourg,
France, died and many others who already were weak and
undernourished developed pulmonary edema, which causes extreme
irritation in the lungs, the newspaper said.

   Eight-year-old DeAndra Anrig says
she felt like Winnie the Pooh when an airplane snagged her kite
line and lofted her on a 100-foot ride.
   ``I read about how Winnie the Pooh flies in the air on kites,
but I never wanted to try it,'' said DeAndra, who let go just as
the kite carried her toward a tree. ``I wasn't thinking anything
but how scared I was.''
   ``She said it was just a big jerk that lifted her (10 feet) into
the air,'' said DeAndra's mother, Debby. ``It carried her right
over my husband's head. All he saw was a shadow going over his
head. I'm just thankful she let go.''
   DeAndra escaped from her ride with bruises. Sympathetic
neighbors delivered cupcakes Tuesday to her home in Dublin, 30
miles southeast of San Francisco, where she rested on an air
mattress surrounded by ice packs and two of her stuffed animals.
   DeAndra and her parents were picnicking Sunday with friends at a
park 2 miles from the Palo Alto airport when the accident occurred.
   DeAndra was taking her turn flying the 12-foot, glider-type kite
when a twin-engine plane descending toward the airport caught the
kite's 200-pound nylon test line.
   Mountain View fire marshal Frank Moe said the 70-pound child was
carried about 100 feet before letting go.
   ``There was no way the people in the plane could have known what
was happening,'' said Ken Markowitz, a lawyer for the Reno Flying
Service, owner of the Care Flight medical transport plane that
tangled with the kite.
   Pilot Jack Uranga of Reno, Nev., was flying a patient to
Stanford University Hospital when the propeller snagged the line,
Markowitz said.
   Despite damage to one propeller blade, Uranga managed to land
safely, but the plane is grounded until repairs are made, Markowitz
said. Uranga said Tuesday that company regulations prevented him
from discussing the accident.
   In San Jose, Federal Aviation Administration official Edge
Ritter said the plane sustained a 2-inch gouge in one of its two
propellers. He was unable to estimate the cost of repair or the
height of the plane when it caught the line.
   Mountain View authorities said they would post signs at
Shoreline park advising that kite flying has been banned there. The
Public Utilities Commission prohibits kite flying within 5 miles of
an airport.
   Ritter said there frequently are kites in the park area, but
this was the first such accident.
   ``There had been planes flying over all that afternoon,'' said
DeAndra's father, Brad. ``And there were kites everywhere _ 15 to
20 of them, some up as high as 200 feet.''
   He and DeAndra found their kite after the incident _ about half
a mile away _ with about 60 feet of line still attached.

   Humorist Donald Barthelme was named the winner
of the $25,000 Rea Award, given annually to an outstanding writer
of short stories.
   ``No richer _ or funnier _ discourse exists in contemporary
American fiction,'' the jury said in giving the 1988 award Tuesday
to Barthelme, a 57-year-old English professor at the University of
Houston.
   The jurors, including one of the two previous Rea Award winners,
Cynthia Ozick, praised Barthelme for blending ``mockery and
exaltation'' in his stories. Robert Coover won the award last year.
   Barthelme's short story collections include ``Forty Stories,''
``Overnight to Many Distant Cities,'' ``Great Days,'' ``City Life''
and ``Unspeakable Practices, Unnatural Acts.''

   The role the United States is playing in
Honduras and Panama has heightened Latin American fears of a major
military confrontation and offended regional pride, officials said.
   President Miguel de la Madrid's harsh condemnation of U.S.
``interventionism'' echoed sentiments voiced throughout the region.
   The sharpest remarks have been reserved for the U.S. deployment
of troops in Honduras after an alleged incursion of Nicaraguan
troops pursuing U.S.-backed Contra rebels.
   Latin American leaders also have expressed concern about the
situation in Panama, where the military chief, Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega, is trying to stifle a huge opposition campaign backed by
U.S. economic pressure. But other presidents have criticized
Noriega.
   Some leaders have suggested that the United States, which is
often viewed as insensitive to Latin America, is thwarting regional
attempts to bring peace to Central America.
   ``It's not with the movement of armies, nor with the financing
of subversion ... that the problems of this area, vital to the
interests of the Mexican people, will be resolved,'' de la Madrid
said Monday in a speech.
   President Vinicio Cerezo of Guatemala said on Tuesday that an
isolated border battle could turn into a regional conflict if U.S.
troops intervened in the fighting. He was interviewed on the
privately-owned Mexico City television station Televisa.
   Argentina and Colombia have expressed what they describe as
grave ``concern'' about the deployment of 3,200 U.S. troops to
Honduras last week.
   President Alan Garcia of Peru went a step further, vowing to
visit Nicaragua to demonstrate ``solidarity'' with its leftist
government.
   U.S. officials described the deployment of soldiers as a
combined training exercise and show of force against Nicaragua.
   The United States also has about 10,000 military personnel
stationed in Panama, headquarters for the American military in
Latin America. Its economic sanctions on Panama have intensified
the demands in that country for Noriega to step down as the de
facto ruler.
   De la Madrid said ``the force of law'' not the ``law of force''
should be used and said only ``diplomatic and peaceful negotiations
can achieve peace in the brother republics of Central America.''
   The Contadora group _ formed in 1983 by Colombia, Mexico, Panama
and Venezuela to negotiate peace in Central America _ issued a
statement last week calling for the United States to respect the
principles of non-interventionism.
   Several Latin American leaders, however, have critized Noriega,
who was indicted in the United States last month on federal drug
trafficking charges.
   Cerezo said on Tueday that Noriega should resign and he called
the government and the opposition to begin negotiating an end to
their stalemate.
   Garcia called for immediate elections in Panama and brought home
Peru's ambassador for consultations.

<DATELINE>TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An amateur astronomer has discovered his
fourth comet in four years after going 19 years without spotting
one.
   ``I'm getting much more persistent about it, and I'm becoming
much more single-minded about it,'' said David Levy, a research
assistant at the University of Arizona's Lunar and Planetary
Laboratory, whose latest discovery came last weekend.
   ``I take advantage of almost every opportunity to search for
comets.''
   The find was confirmed Tuesday by Brian Marsden of the
International Astronomical Union, who said Levy now has more new
comet sightings than any other living U.S. amateur.
   The comet was designated Comet 1988e _ signifying it is the
fifth comet discovered this year.
   Levy said he spends between one and four hours each clear night
scanning the skies with one of his dozens of telescopes.
   He has been searching for comets for 23 years. After 19 years
without a find, he co-discovered Comet Levy-Rudenko in 1984.
   In January 1987, he spotted the first comet of that year.
   Levy built a 6-by-8-foot wooden platform atop his home last
October to get a better view of the horizon. Three days after its
completion, he spotted his third comet.
   He said he found his fourth comet about an hour before dawn on
Saturday, just above the horizon. He was using a 16-inch telescope.
   Only six to eight new comets are discovered in an average year,
and some comet hunters search a lifetime without making a
discovery, Marsden said. Last year, a record 16 comets were
discovered, he said.
   Australian amateur astronomer William Bradfield has discovered
13 comets, more than any other living comet hunter, Marsden said.
He said Levy is now tied with Canadian Rolf Meier for the North
American honors.

<TEXT>
   A growing scandal over allegations of
massive embezzlement and corruption by top officials is widely seen
as part of a power struggle between President Roh Tae-woo and his
predecessor.
   Former President Chun Doo-hwan's younger brother, Chun
Kyung-hwan, is the focus of the scandal, an investigation into
charges leaders of the powerful Saemaul Undong development group
used government connections to amass fortunes. Prosecutors say
dozens of government officials also have been implicated.
   Political observers say the Saemaul revelations are among
efforts by Roh to discredit Chun Doo-hwan by exposing corruption
under his government. Chun, who stepped down Feb. 25, has been
fighting to retain power within the government.
   Chun Kyung-hwan, the former leader of Saemaul (New Community),
became among the country's most powerful figures while Chun
Doo-hwan was in power.
   Many Koreans believe there was corruption under President Chun,
much of it centered around his family. The Korea Times, in an
editorial Tuesday, said the Saemaul affair ``should be considered
typical of the ... unjust practices during the preceding
government.''
   Former President Chun, who has not been implicated directly in
the scandal, was to meet today with President Reagan in Washington.
He is on a private tour of the United States that includes meetings
with many top American officials.
   The investigation and the constant stream of revelations would
not be possible without high-level government backing, according to
officials and observers, who declined to be identified further.
   ``You can be sure this is coming direct from the Blue House
(presidential mansion),'' said one official.
   The Prosecutors General office says an initial investigation of
the Saemaul group indicates the younger Chun and other top
officials embezzled government and private subsidies, forced
corporations to make illegal donations and peddled government
influence and contacts. News reports indicate up to $50 million
could be involved.
   Prosecutor Kang Won-Il, who is heading the investigation, says
officials of the Home, Agriculture and Fisheries, Education, and
Sports ministries are also being investigated for aiding Saemaul
officials or covering up fraud to protect President Chun and his
family.
   Saemaul has evolved into a huge organization since its creation
in 1971 to promote urban and rural development, with activities
ranging from construction of model communities and organizing city
dwellers to keep neighborhoods clean.
   Opposition supporters and other critics contend Saemaul also has
worked closely with the country's authoritarian governments in the
past, organizing government support and handing out patronage.
   The younger Chun, who resigned in 1987 after being linked to
gangsters locked in a bloody power struggle, fled briefly to Japan
last Friday when details of the investigation were made public.
   The former Saemaul chief, who was appointed by his brother, said
after returning that there had been irregularities, but gave no
details.
   Dozens of Saemaul officials and their wives are being questioned
and have been barred from leaving the country.
   Roh, a former general who helped put Chun into power with army
backing in 1980, has been trying to distance himself from his
highly unpopular predecessor and to take complete control of the
government.
   The two men had been close since their days in the armed forces
and Chun picked Roh to be his successor. But Roh started to
distance himself from Chun when massive anti-government protests
occurred last summer.
   Roh backed opposition demands for elections held in December
that he won with 36.6 percent of the vote after rival opposition
candidates split the anti-government vote.
   The new president has resisted Chun's attempts to retain power,
ousting many of the former president's supporters from the
governing Democratic Justice Party. Roh also curtailed plans for
Chun to act as a senior adviser to the government, reducing the
post to a largely ceremonial role.
   Roh has promised to end decades of authoritarian rule and
introduce sweeping democratic reforms and is anxious to build
popular support. On the campaign trail, he vowed that any official
corruption under the Chun government would not go unpunished.
   Daily revelations about the Saemaul probe have received maximum
attention in the media. The state-run television networks devote
much of their nightly news programs to the affair.
   But some Democratic Justice Party leaders and other officials
are concerned the effort to discredit Chun could backfire. The
opposition Party for Peace and Democracy has charged that Roh aided
Saemaul corruption while he was Home Minister in 1982 and demanded
he be investigated.
   The governing party also is worried that corruption revelations
could hurt its chances in National Assembly elections, which are to
be held next month.

<HEAD>Human Rights Group Files Suit Against FBI</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A lawsuit has been filed against the FBI alleging
the agency illegally obtained the financial records of a human
rights group with the help of a Dallas bank.
   The U.S. District Court lawsuit, filed Tuesday by the Dallas
chapter of the Committee in Solidarity with the People of El
Salvador, names the FBI and Merchants State Bank as defendants.
   The suit contends that the FBI obtained the chapter's bank
records beginning in June 1983 in violation of the 1978 Financial
Privacy Act. It also contends that the bank failed to notify CISPES
as required by law.
   Bank officials and an FBI spokesman declined comment on the suit.
   Under the law, federal law enforcement agencies may obtain an
individual's or a group's bank records by subpoena, by written
request from a designated FBI supervisor or through a request from
the agency's director indicating the records are being sought in
the course of an investigation of foreign intelligence activities.
   The law usually requires that a subject be notified and given
time to seek a court review of the request unless the bank records
are sought as part of an ongoing intelligence investigation.
   The human rights group's national organization came under FBI
scrutiny beginning in 1981, and the Dallas group in 1983, when
federal agents began trying to determine whether CISPES members had
contacts with hostile foreign governments or their agents or were
involved in criminal or terroristic activities.
   The investigation was terminated in 1985 after agents found no
evidence linking CISPES with terrorist groups in El Salvador, FBI
officials have said.
   Joe K. Crews, an attorney representing CISPES, said records
obtained from the FBI through the Freedom of Information Act do not
indicate that the records request was made through the agency's
director as part of an ongoing counterintelligence investigation.
   Officials of CISPES say the FBI probe targted the group and
dozens of others solely because of their opposition to Reagan
administration policies on Central America.
   The suit seeks $100 in damages for each of an unspecified number
of privacy rights violations. It also seeks unspecified punitive
damages, attorney fees and an injunction requiring the FBI to
comply with federal privacy laws in future records requests.

<HEAD>Zoo Expedition Seeks Giant Earwig On Napoleon's Island</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two young men from London Zoo will set off from
Britain on Thursday in search of the world's largest earwig on St.
Helena, the remote South Atlantic island where Napoleon Bonaparte
died.
   ``If we find any giant earwigs we will bring them back alive in
hopes of getting them to breed in captivity at the zoo,'' said Dave
Clarke, the expedition leader.
   The nocturnal insect is 3 inches long, reddish brown in color,
lives in a burrow and although a fearsome looking creature, with
two big pincers at the back, is harmless to man. Unlike most
insects, it cannot fly.
   ``Nobody knows if there are any left,'' Clarke said in an
interview Tuesday.
   Clarke said the last giant earwigs were seen by Belgian
collecting expeditions in 1965 and 1967.
   St. Helena, with a population of 6,000, is 1,200 miles east of
Angola and 4,400 miles south of England.
   The island, the only known habitat for the insect, has been
occupied by the British since 1659 and Napoleon was exiled there
after his defeat at Waterloo in 1815. He died on the island in 1821.
   Clarke, 25, works in the insect house at the zoo where he is on
friendly terms with deadly black widow spiders, tarantulas, giant
water bugs, ants and locusts.
   ``We've never had a giant earwig at the zoo and few people have
seen one. Even the Saints, as the people of St. Helena are known,
haven't seen any for a long time,'' Clarke said.
   Going with him is Richard Veal, 24, who works in the zoo's small
mammals house. An anonymous benefactor has donated the $6,400 cost
of the trip.
   Clarke said the zoo was alerted to the earwig's apparent
disappearance by the International Union for the Conservation of
Nature and Natural Resources. The Geneva-based group has a chapter
in Cambridge, England, which monitors rare species.
   ``The earwig has been known to be rare for a long time but the
union learned only recently that in the past 15 to 20 years it has
become rare to the point of a serious threat of extinction,'' said
Paul Pearce-Kelly, head keeper of the insect house.
   There are 1,000 species of earwig in the world, Pearce-Kelly
said.
   ``The giant earwig's Latin name is Labidura herculeana, which
could be translated as Hercules hardlips,'' he said.
   Pearce-Kelly said the search also will be difficult because
``the island habitat has undergone much destruction from goats,
rats and 10-inch-long giant centipedes, which came in on ships.''
   In their 3{-week search, Clarke and Veal will scout two other
scarce insects only found on St. Helena: a giant ground beetle and
the St. Helena dragonfly.
   ``I'm hoping we will be in time to find the giant earwig and
save it,'' said Clarke.
   When asked why anyone should bother, he replied: ``Everyone asks
that.''
   ``The earwig was part of St. Helena's life long before we were
around and it is unqiue. As man created the conditions which
threatened to exterminate it, we should try to save it,'' he said.

<HEAD>Gephardt Gains, Jackson Slips Behind Dukakis In Michigan Poll</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis strengthened
his lead over Jesse Jackson in support among Michigan Democrats and
independents, according to survey done by a local television
station.
   Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt, who has said he must win
Michigan's Democratic caucuses Saturday which will allocate 138 of
the state's 150 delegates to the party's national convention to
remain in the race for the party's presidential nomination, showed
marked improvement in the WJBK-TV survey over his standing in
earlier polls.
   The survey, released Tuesday, of 400 Michigan voters identifying
themselves as Democrats or independents gave Dukakis a 35 percent
margin of support, WJBK said.
   Jackson, rated virtually even with Dukakis earlier this month in
polls by the Detroit Free Press and Detroit News, had 29 percent.
Gephardt, hovering at about 10 percent in both newspaper polls,
improved to 17 percent in the WJBK survey.
   Sens. Albert Gore Jr. and Paul Simon of Illinois trailed with 6
percent and 5 percent respectively, and another 9 percent of those
polled were undecided, the Detroit station said. Percentages
exceeded 100 percent because of rounding.
   The survey was conducted for WJBK by Barry Kaplovitz Associates
of Boston and had a margin of error of 5 percentage points.

<TEXT>
   Kansas Democrats have changed their minds
and decided to allow local delegates pledged to the presidential
runners-up in Saturday's caucuses to vote at district conventions
after all.
   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis won the Kansas contest with
278 of the 764 local delegates elected and Jesse Jackson finished
second with 235.
   However, there was confusion over the local delegates pledged to
Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore Jr. and Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt
and those who were uncommitted.
   Under state rules, local delegates who supported a candidate who
didn't reach a 15 percent threshold would be non-entities at the
district conventions scheduled for April 23.
   The state decided Monday that those local delegates would be
unable to vote at the district conventions and would be ignored in
computing national delegates from the districts.
   But after conferring with the Democratic National Committee's
Compliance Commission, which interprets the national rules for
electing delegates to the national convention, the state party
decided Tuesday that all local delegates will be allowed to vote.

<HEAD>Ohio GOP Welcomes Robertson People to Ranks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ohio Republican Party Chairman Robert
Bennett says that the state party welcomes supporters of Pat
Robertson, notwithstanding his current or possible future bid for
the party's presidential nomination.
   Bennett Tuesday discounted notions that the former evangelist
may try to take over the party from the ashes of Robertson's
current campaign, either to push friendly candidates for state
offices in 1990 or to launch a possible second run for the
presidency in 1992.
   In some states, including Ohio, Robertson supporters have
entered races for local party offices, triggering speculation that
they may have an eventual party takeover in mind. Bennett said he
doubts it.
   He said the Ohio activity is limited to Cincinnati, where some
local party candidates who support Robertson have been pushing for
right-to-life legislation in various public forums for years.
   ``There is no concerted effort to take over the party
organization in Ohio,'' Bennett said. He said many Robertson
backers are disenchanted former Democrats and others, new to the
political process, who seek Republican values that he summed up
this way: ``Married, with 4.2 kids, and go to church on Sunday.''

   Pat Robertson's lone presidential campaign
office in Oregon will close by April 1, according to the head of
the Republican contender's organization in the state.
   David Crowe said Tuesday the national campaign headquarters in

   Telephone service will be cut off on April 1, Crowe said.
   In a phone interview, Crowe said the national campaign staff

<HEAD>Alexander Votes For Bush, Won't Endorse Him</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Former Gov. Lamar Alexander says he
voted for Vice President George Bush on Super Tuesday but will not
endorse him because he wants to avoid mixing politics with his post
as president-elect of the University of Tennessee.
   Alexander, in an interview, said Tuesday that he had no reaction
to published reports that he is high on Bush's list of potential
Republican vice presidential candidates if Bush, as expected, wins
the presidential nomination.
   Alexander, to succeed Ed Boling as UT president on July 1, said,
``I plan to show up for work July 1 at UT and be there.'' The
Republican National Convention begins in New Orleans on Aug. 15.
   ``I have resolved not to plan my life around the vice
presiedential selection,'' Alexander said. ``I could get hit by a
car or struck by lightning or be selected as a vice presidential
candidate and one is as likely as the other.''
   He said his feelings on whether to accept the vice presidential
nomination have not changed since his selection as UT's next
president.
   ``I said (then) I thought it was a remote possibility, that I
didn't expect to be asked but that I didn't plan to say, `no,'''
Alexander said.

<HEAD>Fuel Economy Standards Cost Lives, Study Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As the government was reporting a slight
increase in auto fuel efficiency last year, two researchers said
federal fuel-economy standards will cause thousands of traffic
deaths in the next decade by discouraging the use of safer, larger
cars.
   ``Fuel economy regulation inevitably leads to smaller, lighter
cars that are inherently less safe than the cars that would be
produced without a binding fuel-economy constraint,'' said a study
released Tuesday by Robert W. Crandall of the Brookings Institution
in Washington and John D. Graham of the Harvard School of Public
Health in Boston.
   They estimated the standards applied to 1989 cars during 10
years of road use would cause 2,200 to 3,900 traffic deaths.
   Also Tuesday, the Transportation Department told Congress that
passenger cars sold in the United States got 28.2 miles per gallon
last year overall, up 0.2 miles per gallon from the previous year.
   Despite the good news on auto fuel economy, Transportation
Secretary Jim Burnley used the report to reiterate his support for
elimination of the fuel-economy requirement, saying it placed U.S.
manufacturers at a disadvantage against their foreign competition.

<HEAD>House Votes To Continue Incentives For Rare-Disease Drugs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House has voted to continue and expand a
program to encourage private companies to develop drugs for
combating rare diseases.
   The bill was passed on a 401-1 vote Tuesday and sent to the
Senate. It extends the so-called ``orphan drug'' program through
fiscal 1990. It would also expand the program, which is overseen by
the Food and Drug Administration, to include special devices and
foods needed to help people with unusual maladies.
   Under the program, companies are given tax credits and
seven-year exclusive marketing rights if they develop products for
rare diseases. Without incentives, the companies would not pursue
development of those products because the small number of
beneficiaries would not make it profitable, according to supporters
of the legislation.
   The revised statute, while expanding the program, would triple
its cost in the next few years. The current annual authorization of
$4 million would grow to $14 million in fiscal 1990.
   The Reagan administration has said it has no objection to the
legislation.

<HEAD>House Panel Approves Funds For Reagan And President-Elect</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A House committee says it will cost $3.5
million in transitional expenses for President Reagan's successor
to move into the White House and cost Reagan $1 million to move to
retirement in California next January.
   The Government and Operations Committee Tuesday approved a bill
authorizing the funds although the Democratic-controlled panel
rejected a Republican move to increase the expense allowance to
offset the effects of inflation for the outgoing president to $1.5
million from $1 million, the level in effect since 1976.
   The proposed boost was opposed by Rep. Jack Brooks, D-Texas, the
panel's chairman, who said the budget squeeze requires Congress to
``make some hard choices'' on spending cuts.
   The panel approved raising the president-elect's allowance for
transitional expenses to $3.5 million from $2 million, the level in
effect for the past 12 years. It also rejected, 24-9, a move by
Rep. Robert S. Walker, R-Pa., to forbid the president-elect from
accepting private donations to supplement federal transitional
funds.
   The $1 million for Reagan's initial retirement expenses, if
approved by the House and Senate, would cover his moving expenses
from the White House to California and the costs of establishing an
office for six months, until funds for former presidents become
available under a separate law.

<HEAD>Disgraced Diplomat Posthumously Reinstated for Helping Jews Flee
Nazis</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thirty-four years after his death, a
Portugese diplomat who helped 30,000 refugees flee the Nazi
invasion of France has been restored to full rank in his country's
consular corps.
   Aristides de Sousa Mendes, who died in poverty and disgrace, was
reinstated by a unanimous vote last week of Portugal's national
assembly, his son Sebastian Mendes, 64, said Tuesday.
   De Sousa Mendes was Portuguese consul to Bordeaux, France, in
1940 when during a three-day period, he, his wife and consul staff
defied their government's orders and hand-wrote exit visas for
30,000 refugees, including an estimated 10,000 Jews.
   ``He decided that it was for him to take action and he took the
action ... he saw to be the right action,'' Mendes said Tuesday.
   ``My father was very moral and _ not religious _ but very
Christian. He believed in helping the unfortunate. He wanted to
assist the ones who are less fortunate than he,'' he said in a
telephone interview from his home in Santa Clarita 40 miles
northwest of Los Angeles.
   The diplomat was recalled to Lisbon, stripped of his position
and retired without pay. Barred from practicing law, forced to sell
his property for taxes and reduced to poverty, he died in 1954. His
wife, Angelina, died in 1948.
   Sebastian Mendes, one of 14 children, and a brother claimed U.S.
citizenship because they were born when their father was serving in
the United States. He enlisted in the U.S. Army in 1943.
   Discharged in 1945, Mendes went to the San Francisco Bay area
and began trying to restore his father's name, writing to
newspapers, approaching human rights groups and even writing a
small book about his father.
   Portugal might have paid tribute to de Sousa Mendes sooner, but
the dictatorship that repudiated him lasted until 1974.
   Historians subsequently documented de Sousa Mendes' work and in
1976 Portugal's foreign ministry recommended his reinstatement. He
was awarded his country's highest civilian medal last year, but not
reinstated until last week.
   Until his death at age 69, de Sousa Mendes's achievement was
acknowledged only by his closest relatives, Mendes said.
   Nevertheless, Mendes said he is glad that the final element of
his father's disgrace has been removed. ``In my old age ... it
happened and I'm thankful to God,'' he said. ``I thank God for
that.''

<HEAD>NRC Gives Green Light, TVA Prepares For Sequoyah Restart</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN GEORGE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHATTANOOGA, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Tennessee Valley Authority is
moving closer to reviving its long-idled nuclear program after
winning unanimous approval from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
   TVA Chairman Marvin Runyon said the federal utility would not
compromise 2{-years of rebuilding by rushing the restart of
Sequoyah Nuclear Plant.
   ``It'll start when it's ready. ... It'll be a safe start,''
Runyon said Tuesday night after the NRC gave TVA permission to
restart the Unit 2 reactor at the Chattanooga plant.
   The commision's 5-0 vote allows Unit 2 to become the first of
five licensed TVA reactors to resume production of power since they
were shut down in 1985 because of safety and management concerns.
   The only condition for the restart was a last-minute problem
involving temperature detectors in the plant's pressurizer system.
   ``It's a relatively minor thing, but we want everything to be
ready,'' said TVA Nuclear Power Manager Steven A. White, who joined
Runyon at a Chattanooga news conference after both returned from
the NRC meeting in Washington.
   With the vote, the NRC also indicated it did not feel a pending
Justice Department investigation of White had anything to do with
whether Sequoyah is safe to operate.
   White has been accused of lying to the NRC in 1986 when he
certified in writing that another TVA nuclear plant, Watts Bar near
Spring City, met federal quality assurance standards. White has
denied wrongdoing.
   NRC Chairman Lando Zech said commissioners had found ``no known
regulatory reason'' to further delay restarting Unit 2.
   During the next few days, Sequoyah workers will complete final
testing and documentation, White said. Then, the plant will slowly
begin generating nuclear power.
   It will probably be three weeks before Unit 2 is at 100 percent
power, but it can produce usable electricity for the TVA system at
15 percent, White said.
   ``This is very similar to the startup of a new plant, and I
expect that we will experience a few problems,'' he said.
``However, our personnel are trained and qualified to resolve any
problems that are encountered.''
   TVA, still facing about $15 billion in long-term debts for the
nuclear program, hopes to have Sequoyah Unit 1 back on line in
August, with Unit 2 at Browns Ferry following in December.
   All three Browns Ferry reactors were shut down in March 1985.
Sequoyah, which began operation in 1981, shut down five months
after the other reactors. White took over the nuclear power program
in a management shakeup early in 1986.

   The nation's largest insurers conspired to
fabricate a liability crisis, which crippled businesses and forced
nationwide cutbacks in police, child care and other services,
according to suits by seven states.
   The lawsuits, filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court here, accuse
dozens of insurance companies of collaborating in a global boycott
of certain types of general liability insurance through secret
agreements and internal pressure.
   The suits, filed by California, New York, West Virginia,
Wisconsin, Minnesota, Massachusetts and Alabama, named 32 insurance
companies, underwriters and associations, including Lloyd's of
London.
   Arizona planned to sue in the same court today, and Texas filed
a separate suit in its state court because the state ``has one of
the toughest, best antitrust laws in the nation,'' said Texas
Attorney General Jim Mattox.
   ``These defendants have sucked the blood of our nation's
economic well-being,'' Mattox said at a news conference in Austin.
   New York State Attorney General Robert Abrams said the case was
one of the largest ever tackled by a group of states in a federal
court, adding that the states had to take action because the
federal government did nothing.
   One of the companies, Aetna Life and Casualty Co., condemned the
suit as ``another political move by political officeholders who
have consistently opposed any and all efforts to address the real
problems of the nation's liability system.''
   A spokesman for the Insurance Services Office, a 1,400-member
industry trade group also named in the suit, called the allegations
unfounded.
   The lawsuits claim the companies targeted for elimination
coverage for pollution accidents and general liability for damage
discovered after the life of a policy, known as ``occurrence''
coverage.
   The companies instead favored more limited policies, covering
only losses that were suffered and claimed within the policy term,
excluding damage that was discovered later, the suits said.
   The lawsuits said four major insurance companies _ Hartford Fire
Insurance Co., Allstate Insurance Co., Cigna Corp. and Aetna _
started a campaign in 1984 to curtail coverage that was generally
available in the industry.
   According to the suits, the companies got major U.S. and British
reinsurers, including underwriters at Lloyd's of London, to
threaten a boycott of any U.S. insurance company that provided the
broader coverage.
   At the same time, the suits said, major insurers and reinsurers
pressured the Insurance Services Office to stop distributing
standard forms, so that it would be impractical for individual
companies to continue offering that coverage.
   As a result, the suits said, property damage insurance for local
governments, nonprofit agencies such as child care centers, and
various businesses suddenly became unavailable or prohibitively
expensive.
   ``This illegal boycott was a major contributor to the insurance
crisis that forced so many cities and businesses up against the
wall,'' California Attorney General John Van de Kamp said.
   ``It was the public and the consumer who paid the price for this
collusive exercise in corporate greed.''
   In California and elsewhere, local governments cut back or
eliminated services, such as parks and police, because of insurance
expenses, Van de Kamp said. Many local officials blamed rising
damage awards in injury suits and joined the insurance industry in
efforts to restrict the right to sue.
   Van de Kamp said the attorneys general decided to file together
here because he has taken the lead on the issue and California law
is favorable to the case and might be cited by the federal court.
   Among other things, the plaintiffs seek to restructure the
Insurance Services Office by giving non-insurers a majority on its
board and making public its data on insurance coverage losses.
   Dave Ostwald, the spokesman for the Insurance Services Office in
New York City, said rates increased mainly because of ``a
demonstrable increase in claims losses and a drop in interest
rates, slowing down (insurers') investment income.''
   He said pollution coverage was changed in response to expansive
court decisions. Pollution insurance and ``occurrence'' coverage
remained available, with some restrictions, he added.
   The Hartford Insurance Group called the lawsuit ``totally
without substance'' and said it is confident that all charges
eventually will be dismissed. It said the rates in question are
established from judgments that are legal and involve no other
insurer or insurance organization.

   Northwest Airlines flight attendants are
likely to ratify a tentative contract that forestalled a walkout by
6,500 workers, a union official said.
   ``We're optimistic the agreement will be ratified or we wouldn't
be submitting it to the membership,'' Marvin Griswold,
secretary-treasurer of the Teamsters' Los Angeles-based airline
division Local 2707, said Tuesday after the carrier and the union
announced the tentative pact.
   Flight attendants had continued working through a Feb. 26 strike
deadline, but set a March 29 deadline that threatened a walkout
during the airline's busy Easter season.
   The tentative pact reached Tuesday first must be approved by the
rank and file flight attendants negotiating committee, which meets
today or Thursday. Then, it must then be approved by the workers,
which could take about 30 days.
   Major details of the proposed contract were not released.
   Both sides acknowledged that the March 29 strike deadline
provided the impetus to reach an agreement.
   ``We wanted to see an agreement reached before the 29th ... The
29th is a sincere and serious deadline,'' Griswold told a news
conference.
   ``It gave us a target,'' said Terry Erskine, Northwest's vice
president of law and labor relations. ``It gave us a focus.
   ``If it (a strike) had occurred, we would have been ready and
would have operated the airline,'' Erskine said.
   The talks for the last two days were conducted with the help of
Joshua Javits, a member of the National Mediation Board, and
federal mediator Robert Brown, Northwest said.
   Javits said the mediators provided a framework for the two sides
to reach a settlement, but ``the parties really did it themselves.''
   Erskine said that, pending ratification, Northwest would suspend
the contract it was set to impose on April 1. The Teamsters agreed
not to engage in any job action during the ratification process.
   The key issue in the dispute was Northwest's two-tier wage
structure, of which the airline had proposed extending the
lower-paid scale to eight years from the current five years.
   B-scale flight attendants argued that the airline was trying to
break a promise that they would earn higher, A-scale wages after
five years.
   The issue had intensified since Northwest acquired Republic
Airlines in 1986. About a third of the 2,600 former Republic
attendants are on the lower scale, and the others said Northwest's
previous wage offer was inadequate.
   Jeff Musto, a Teamsters spokesman in Eagan, said only one detail
of the contract has been disclosed: that all flight attendants
hired by Northwest will be required to join the union.
   Erskine said Northwest found no evidence of ``guerilla warfare''
tactics the union had threatened as a way to keep the company off
balance.
   He also said Northwest did not see its traffic diminish during
the dispute, although he acknowledged that some people may have
booked flights on other airlines.

   The oom-pah-pah of a tuba and the jangle of a
tambourine were the first clues that things were not quite normal
in the Queens Midtown Tunnel early today.
   Then a police van came out on the Manhattan side with flashing
lights. It braked in front of the more than 100 spectators gathered
along the road and its megaphone crackled to life: ``Do yourself a
favor and don't touch the cages.''
   What brought out the crowd, which ranged from grandmothers to
infants?
   ``Word of trunk,'' one spectator said.
   It was Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus' annual
three-mile parade of animals as the big top moved into Madison
Square Garden for its six-week run.
   The caged lions and tigers came first, 14 of them in two strands
of cages linked together and pulled by trucks. The animals paced
back and forth.
   ``Here pussycat,'' someone in the crowd yelled.
   ``Living things in Manhattan that are not people, and are not
cockroaches!'' yelled Amy Slaton, a 30-year-old art critic. ``This
is the happiest night of my life.''
   The crowd roared as the elephants appeared at the tunnel exit.
Ninteen were linked with long strands of chains, walking mainly two
abreast. The cry went up, ``Wooo-oooo! Elephants! Elephants! AAAAll
Right!''
   Paula Van Meter was wearing an elephant nose and ears in honor
of her sixth trip to the parade.
   ``Sometimes dignitaries get to ride on the elephants,'' the
41-year-old Brooklyn resident said. ``That would be worth running
for office.''
   ``I wish we had a little baby elephant,'' said a child.
   After the elephants came 15 horses, five zebras and six camels.
   The rear was brought up by a Department of Sanitation street
sweeper, busy at work.
   One elephant rider was Richard Dunne, a 37-year-old lawyer from
Baltimore, who said he bought the ride at a charity auction. He
would not say how much he paid, only that it was expensive and
worth the money.
   ``It was like a gigantic horse,'' Dunne said. ``It's so fresh
for New York. Everyone is smiling and happy, even the cops were
happy.''

<TEXT>
   Four years after a big mining company
decided to phase out its operations in Copperhill, the village
tucked in the Appalachian mountains of southeast Tennessee has
filed for bankruptcy protection.
   ``I don't know where else to scratch,'' Copperhill Mayor Sylvan
Green said in a telephone interview, calling Tuesday's Chapter 9
federal court filing a last resort for the town of about 400 people
about 60 miles east of Chattanooga.
   Much of the problem for Copperhill derives from a long-standing
dispute over a sewer and water service deal with neighboring
McCaysville, Ga. The dispute began when Tennessee Chemical Co. said
it was bailing out.
   Back in 1979, Copperhill's mining operations were owned by
Cities Service Co., the town decided to buy extra water from
McCaysville to supply what was easily Polk County's largest
employer.
   That prompted McCaysville to float a bond issue on a new water
plant and agree to pay Copperhill for sewer service.
   Then in 1982, Tennessee Chemical Co. bought the mining
operations. Two years later, it said it couldn't compete with cheap
imported copper and announced plans to lay off 900 workers by 1987.
   Suddenly, Copperhill no longer needed extra water, and when it
stopped paying for it, McCaysville began withholding its $3,000
monthly payments for sewer service. That was about two years ago.
   ``They were to purchase ... almost 50 percent of our water,
depending upon the Tennessee Chemical Company,'' said McCaysville
Mayor Barbara Thomas.
   ``Of course, the Tennessee Chemical Company did not come through
with their part of the bargain,'' she said. ``But that was not the
contract we had. We had the contract with Copperhill.''
   McCaysville claims Copperhill owes $255,000 in back water
payments. Copperhill wants payment for sewer service. Negotiations
failed and lately, said Mrs. Thomas, they haven't even been able to
agree on when to talk.
   The loss of the sewer payments put such a dent in Copperhill's
budget that Green told officials last year that the city could not
finish building its new police station.
   In the petition filed in U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Copperhill
listed debts to 12 creditors totaling $302,355.49.
   A Chapter 9 bankruptcy is designed to allow a municipal
government to maintain necessary levels of service while it
implements a plan to adjust its debts.

   Coastal residents were jolted awake
by a moderate earthquake and aftershock today, prompting worried
calls to police. There were no reports of injury or damage,
officials said.
   The first shock, measuring 3.9 on the Richter scale, hit at
12:42 a.m. and was centered 11 miles southeast of downtown, said
Robert Finn, spokesman for the seismology lab at the California
Institute of Technology in Pasadena.
   Fifteen minutes later, an aftershock measured 2.7 on the Richter
scale.
   The temblors were felt in nearby Goleta and Isla Vista, and
southward in Carpinteria, Ojai, Ventura and Oxnard, about 30 miles
away, Finn said.
   ``These quakes weren't strong enough to do much damage, but a
lot of people felt them,'' Finn said.
   About 30 people telephoned Santa Barbara County sheriff's
headquarters after the Earth movement to confirm what they felt,
said Deputy Larry Ralston.
   ``They were just concerned and curious, or like one who wanted
to know if he had been dreaming,'' Ralston said.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude.
   An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause slight
damage in the local area, 4 moderate damage, 5 considerable damage,
6 severe damage.

   Rain and high winds howled through the Northwest today after
gusts up to 68 mph felled trees, killing a teen-age girl and
injuring another.
   Osita Emetaron of Portland, Ore., was struck by a tree at Ecola
State Park on the northern Oregon coast Tuesday afternoon, said
Cannon Beach Police Officer Kristen Knight. The girl was dead on
arrival at Seaside General Hospital.
   The other girl, a 14-year-old with Ms. Emetaron whose name was

<TEXT>
   A former Wedtech Corp. official who says he
bribed numerous public officials, including Rep. Mario Biaggi, also
admits that he stole $1.5 million from the defense contractor.
   Mario Moreno, ex-vice chairman of the defunct Bronx company,
detailed numerous bribes and payoffs by Wedtech.
   During his sixth day of testimony Tuesday at the racketeering
trial of Biaggi and six others, Moreno said the payoffs went to
bankers, lawyers and union leaders.
   But under cross examination, he also admitted transferring
$250,000 in kickbacks to a Swiss bank account, even after he had
agreed to cooperate with prosecutors.
   Biaggi; his eldest son; his former law partner and four others
are charged with turning Wedtech into a racketeering enterprise
that paid millions of dollars in bribes to land and maintain
government contracts.
   Moreno, the first prosecution witness, has linked the defendants
to numerous payoff and fraud schemes but he also admitted
personally stealing $1.5 million in Wedtech funds.
   Moreno also said he made false statements to the Internal
Revenue Service, state tax authorities, the Securities and Exchange
Commission, the Small Business Administration, the Defense
Department ``and a few other agencies.''
   Moreno also claimed Wedtech paid $80,000 to Rep. Robert Garcia,
D-N.Y., for ``political favors.'' Garcia, who has not been charged
with any wrongdoing, denied Moreno's allegation through a spokesman.
   The payments for ``political favors and political
introductions'' were made to Garcia ``because he and his wife
requested it,'' said Moreno.
   Moreno also said Wedtech paid $130,000 to two Bronx bankers in
early 1984 for helping the company obtain a $500,000 cash loan _ at
$150,000 interest over three months _ from a Bronx businessman;
$15,000 to a Manhattan banker who helped them launder the $500,000
cash; $10,000 to $15,000 over six years to a Consolidated Edison
manager ``to have Con Edison on our side whenever we needed it''
and a $100,000 payoff to two Teamsters officials in 1985 to settle
a dispute with another union.

   The luck o' the Irish was with two elderly
women who were trapped in their overturned car. They were rescued
by six firefighters from Dublin, Ireland.
   Azzie Harrison, 72, and passenger Edna Rozar, 73, of Dublin,
Ga., became trapped Tuesday after their car plunged over the side
of a bridge into a creek near the intersection of U.S. 80 West and
Shamrock Drive.
   Six members of the Dublin, Ireland, Fire Brigade, who are
visiting to bring greetings from their lord mayor for the
millennium of their Irish hometown, were sitting in a fire station
when the rescue call came.
   They joined in cutting through the car's hood and breaking its

today at a hospital.
   ``That's the thing about firefighters,'' said Seamus O'Connor,
one of the six firemen. ``We can go anywhere and fit right in.''

   A Vietnamese refugee has died after she
lost a fight against leukemia that prompted the Vietnamese
government to release her relatives in hope of finding a compatible
bone marrow donor.
   Myhanh Luong, 21, died of an infection stemming from her
leukemia, North Shore University Hospital spokesman Daniel Rosette
said Tuesday.
   Luong came to the United States in 1979 after a seven-day
journey from Vietnam to the Philippines in a small boat with 52
other refugees. In 1986, while attending Baruch College, she was
diagnosed with the blood cancer.
   In January, under pressure from the U.S. State Department, the
Vietnamese government granted exit visas to Luong's parents and two
sisters in Ho Chi Minh City ``on humanitarian grounds.''
   Doctors had hoped that one of them would have bone marrow that
could be transplanted to save Luong. Tests showed, however, that
their bone marrow was not compatible with hers.
   Luong's leukemia had been in remission since November, a step
which is crucial if any other life saving options were to be
attempted, Rosette said.
   In an effort to boost her spirits, doctors permitted her to go
home to Long Island for five days earlier this month.
   A week after she returned to the hospital she contracted an
infection and never recovered, Rosette said.
   ``She really enjoyed her stay at home,'' said her sister, MyMy
Luong. ``We are all very upset.'' MyMy said family members were at
her bedside when she died.
   Funeral services for Luong were held Monday in New York City's
Chinatown.

   The average Japanese household in a recent survey
had $82,000 in savings at the end of last year, up 14.9 percent
from a year earlier, a government report published today said.
   It was the biggest annual increase in savings since 1979, when
average savings rose 15.5 percent from 1978, said Namiko Mizutani,
a statistician at the Management and Coordination Agency, which
conducted the survey.
   Mizutani said the increase resulted largely from an increase in
stock prices last year.
   Despite last October's worldwide stock market crash, the average
prices of 1,058 major stocks listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange's
first section rose about 15 percent in value from 1986, local news
reports said.
   The agency surveyed 6,150 families on Dec. 31, but left out
those engaged in agricuture and fisheries, and single people.

   Coast Guard searchers today found debris they
suspected was from an Air Force F-16 jet that crashed into the Gulf
of Mexico during a training mission, but there was no sign of the
pilot, officials said.
   The unidentified pilot was flying solo 40 miles west of Fort
Myers when the jet went down Tuesday night, said Air Force Capt.
Diane Lawhon, a spokeswoman for MacDill Air Force Base.
   Officials don't know what caused the crash or if the pilot was
able to eject from the plane.
   Searchers flew over a 100-square-mile area early today and found
small pieces of debris they believe was part of the plane, said
Petty Officer Tom Gillespie.
   ``The pieces are small. The biggest is 1-foot-by-1-foot. They
are collecting the debris and will give it to the Air Force,
(which) will make the decision about whether or not it is from the
plane,'' Gillespie said from the Coast Guard's Miami office.
   He said it is ``not unusual'' to not find a pilot's remains
after crashes of impacts so strong that the plane is torn apart.
   The jet was accompanied by another F-16 from MacDill. When that
pilot lost radio contact with the downed flier, he circled around
to look for him but found nothing, Ms. Lawhon said.
   A Coast Guard jet and helicopter searched about 40 miles off
Sarasota, said Sgt. Michelle Spicer, another MacDill spokeswoman.
MacDill sent a C-130 four-engine cargo plane to aid in the search.
   The F-16 Fighting Falcon has a F100 Pratt and Whitney engine and
is manufactured by General Dynamics. MacDill has about 100 F-16s in
its fleet, delivered in 1978.

   The Philippines and the United States
today said that on April 5 they will begin a periodic review of the
executive agreement under which the United States operates six
military bases here.
   The review of the 1947 Military Bases Agreement is expected to
center on U.S. compensation for the right to operate Clark Air
Base, Subic Bay Naval Base and four smaller installations. The
United States currently pays the Philippines $180 million in
economic and military aid annually.
   Some Philippine legislators have suggested the figure be
increased to more than $2 billion a year. Foreign Secretary Raul
Manglapus, chief Philippine negotiator in the talks, says $1.2
billion annually would be ``realistic.''
   In addition to compensation, the bases also employ 68,000
Filipinos. The United States estimates the installations add nearly
$1 billion a year to the local economy.

<TEXT>
   A deal to bestow prestigious Harvard positions on
a Texas couple in exchange for a $500,000 donation has drawn fire
from a senior administrator of the university's John F. Kennedy
School of Government.
   Executive Dean Richard Cavanagh praised some aspects of the
school's ``entrepreneurial style of raising money'' but complained
about the tentative deal in a confidential report based on a
two-month study of funding efforts.
   ``It is clear that this was an unusual, unhappy and unfortunate
incident _ the product of misunderstanding, inexperience, sloppy
handling and hasty processing,'' said Cavanagh.
   Cavanagh's comments were carried in the latest edition of the
weekly Harvard Gazette, published by the university. Harvard
officials confirmed the accuracy of his statements but declined to
release his report.
   The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said no
decision has been made on whether to conclude the agreement. One
official suggested that the controversy surrounding the deal was
the reason for putting it on hold.
   Cavanagh was appointed in December and asked to examine the
school's fund-raising methods. Other Harvard institutions also
conducted fund-raising surveys on orders from Harvard President
Derek Bok.
   Bok's action followed publication by the Harvard Crimson student
newspaper in November of parts of the draft agreement between the
school and Charles Cameron Dickinson III and his wife, Joanne.
   ``The donors will be appointed by the dean to appropriate
positions in the School of Government that will accord them status
as Officers of the University with the privileges associated
therewith,'' said the agreement, tentatively approved by Kennedy
School Dean Graham T. Allison.
   Only full-time instructors and administrators normally are
appointed Officers of the University, academic, administrative or
advisory positions.
   The Crimson also published a in-house memo by an Allison aide
stating that Mrs. Dickinson wanted to know the most prestigious
title she could buy for $250,000 and asking how much it would cost
to be on an advisory committee.
   Kennedy School officials confirmed the existence the memo, but
spokesman Steven Singer declined requests Tuesday for telephone
interviews with Allison or Cavanagh.
   Allison described the deal as a mistake shortly after it came to
light.
   Dickinson, a 1980 graduate of Harvard Divinity School, comes
from a wealthy Texas oil family. No one answered the telephone at
the Dickinson residence in Wichita Falls.
   Kennedy School officials, acting on recommendations in the
Cavanagh report, recently created a position of director of
development and gave the develpment office full responsibility for
fund raising.

   Many Americans say they have heard enough
about the Iran-Contra affair and unrest in Israel's occupied
territories, a national poll found.
   A Tampa Tribune-Gallup Poll of 1,211 registered voters,
conducted by telephone between March 10-12 and released today,
found that 64 percent wanted to hear less about the Iran-Contra
scandal. Only 29 percent wanted more information about the affair.
   On social unrest in Israel, 42 percent wanted to know more and
47 percent wanted less information, according to the poll, which
had a 3 percent margin of error.
   The poll also found that most Americans care more about issues
such as drug abuse, long-term health care, quality education and
aid to the homeless.
   Of those polled, 84 percent said they wanted to hear more about
battling illegal drugs. At least two-thirds of the polled voters
wanted more information about efforts to fight AIDS, making
American businesses more competitive with foreign imports and
negotiating arms control agreements with the Soviet Union.

<TEXT>
   NASA scientists are planning an
international satellite system to study the atmosphere more
completely, a program moved into high gear because of recent
ominous changes in the ozone layer and other problems.
   The Earth Observing System will be an international network of
space-based polar laboratories focusing on the planet's weather and
ecology, National Aeronautics and Space Administration project
scientist Dixon Butler said Tuesday.
   ``This will bring about a revolution in our understanding of the
Earth as a whole system,'' Butler said via satellite to scientists
at agency centers across the country, including the Jet Propulsion
Laboratory in Pasadena.
   The schedule for the program was recently accelerated because of
worrisome changes in the Earth's atmosphere, such as depletion in
the protective ozone layer, Butler said from NASA's Goddard Space
Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md.
   The six satellite labs will also monitor the so-called
``greenhouse effect,'' in which the earth's temperature is
gradually rising because of increased carbon dioxide in the
atmosphere, Butler said
   The agency is asking for $20 million in next year's budget to
finalize planning and preparations for launches beginning in 1995,
said Charles Redmond, a spokesman for NASA's science division.
   The project involves two satellites to be launched by Japanese
and European agencies, as well as four by NASA. It features an
estimated $2 billion U.S. price tag, he said.
   ``We need the intellectual resources of all mankind,'' Butler
said. ``We must have international cooperation.''
   NASA has already received about 870 letters from scientific
groups proposing experiments, he said. He also said Soviet
participation is a possibility.
   Instruments to be used on the satellites include a synthetic
aperture radar, which uses radar waves to create images that would
otherwise be hidden by clouds or vegetation.
   Another is a ``geodynamics laser ranging system'' that could
detect the slightest movement along such geological features as
California's San Andreas Fault, Butler said.

<HEAD>Three Arrested for Firearm Salute at Assyrian Funeral</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three members of this city's Assyrian community
were arrested by police after they fired guns repeatedly in a
cemetery salute to a dead comrade, authorities said.
   The arrests occurred Tuesday during the burial of Charles Warda,
21, who died in an auto accident last week, said Police Capt.
Clarence Zanders.
   John Cannon, an official of the Montrose Cemetery and
Crematorium on Chicago's Northwest Side, said the three men began
firing into the air as part of a makeshift salute.
   ``There was quite a bit of shooting going on, and we really
didn't think it was proper,'' Cannon said.
   Zanders said the officers who were called to the scene
discovered no injuries and no damage to property, but confiscated
five guns.
   A police spokeswoman, Tina Vicini, said gunfire has been
reported before in connection with burials in the Assyrian
community.
   Modern Assyrians, a Christian group from present-day Iraq, are
said to be the descendants of the people who ruled the ancient
Assyrian Empire before its destruction in 612 B.C.

   India today canceled the visit of a tennis team
to protest Israel's handling of Arab riots, and new figures showed
that anti-occupation violence in the West Bank and Gaza Strip cost
Israel more than $335 million.
   Israel's 10-member inner Cabinet was to meet later in the day to
hear a report from Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir on his talks in
the United States.
   Shamir was greeted Tuesday by thousands of singing and dancing
supporters who welcomed his steadfast refusal to accept an American
peace plan.
   ``I return satisfied, especially after people tried to frighten
me before I left that the visit would be a difficult one and that I
would hear harsh words,'' Shamir told an airport news conference.
``I'm satisfied that didn't happen.''
   Also Tuesday, Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin told a
parliamentary committee that Israel had jailed 3,000 Arabs since
Dec. 8, including 700 since Sunday, Israeli newspapers said today.
   In an underground leaflet circulated in the Gaza Strip, the
Palestine Liberation Organization announced payments will be made
to people who lose family members, property or jobs because of
clashes with Israeli soldiers.
   Gad Yacobi, minister of economy, disclosed that the violence
that began Dec. 8 in the occupied lands has cost Israel more than
$335 million in lost production, exports and added security costs,
spokeswoman Naama Henig said today. The tally does not include
losses in tourism and agriculture.
   ``If the situation continues, it will have a significant impact
on Israel's economy,'' she quoted Yacobi as telling Israeli
economic writers.
   Yacobi said there was a drop in overall production, especially
in construction, of 10 percent to 20 percent a month during the
last three months. This resulted in a loss of at least $75 million,
he said.
   He put the cost for extra security at $60 million.
   The biggest loss was in Israeli exports to the occupied lands _
reduced by $200 million thus far. Israeli exports to Gaza and the
West Bank totaled $1.15 billion last year.
   Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi announced today that his
country's Davis Cup team was canceling a visit to Israel to protest
Israeli ``repression and atrocities'' against Arabs in the
territories.
   Zvi Meyer, secretary of the Israel Tennis Association, said he
was ``very surprised and disappointed'' by the decision. He said
Israel had already sold 1,500 seats for the three-day series that
was to begin April 7.
   It was the first protest cancellation of a sporting or
entertainment event as a result of the clashes in the occupied
lands, although the violence has made it difficult for promoters to
arrange such events.
   For example, an all-star tennis fund-raiser for Israel's Sharei
Tzadek Hospital was canceled after officials said big name players
such as Chris Evert would not come because of security concerns.
   The underground leaflet distributed in Gaza said families would
receive a one-time payment of $2,900 for ``martyrs'' killed in
confrontations and $600 for anyone arrested. According to U.N.
figures, 107 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli soldiers or
settlers since Dec. 8 in the territories Israel seized in the 1967
Middle East war. One Israeli soldier has been killed.
   Merchants unable to open stores because of strikes would get
$1,450 in compensation from the PLO, and police who resigned their
jobs would get $1,450 as a first payment.
   Israeli officials have taken steps to prevent the PLO from
compensating Palestinians who suffered financial losses.
   Money changers have been particularly hard hit because one such
measure is a ceiling of $1,350 on the amount of money brought into
Israel by individuals or institutions, an official said on
condition of anonymity.
   Demonstrations subsided this afternoon in Israel's occupied
lands, although Arab reports said a curfew was extended on Deir Al
Balah in the Gaza Strip after an overnight demonstration in which
youths threw stones at soldiers.
   All of Gaza is under a nightly curfew until 3 a.m.
   On Tuesday, a Palestinian motorist was ambushed and killed near
the Gaza Strip town of Khan Yunis, and Israeli troops shot and
killed a Palestinian in the West Bank village of Tubas.

   Ugly is officially out in this community
east of San Francisco, where residents now can be sent to jail for
having eyesores in their yards.
   Not everyone is happy about the new law, which critics say will
turn neighbors into enemies.
   The law, which goes into effect March 30, will outlaw hanging a
clothesline visible from the street, leaving broken furniture or
auto parts in the yard, or even maintaining a house with most of
its paint peeling.
   Provisions banning garbage cans, building materials, dirt piles,
packing boxes and broken appliances in front yards are part of a
self-improvement campaign by the city, city officials said.
   City Councilman Dave Burton says the city has no business
subjecting citizens to white-glove inspections.
   ``This is a sledgehammer approach to a problem of aesthetics,''
Burton said. ``If you brought a pile of lumber to your house, they
could cite you.''
   City Councilman Paul Moffatt said the law was needed to prevent
public health and safety problems arising from the large number of
people piling refuse in their yards and creating dangerous
conditions for children in Dublin, a city of 19,000 located 30
miles southeast of San Francisco.
   ``We have old decaying trees where rodents can get in and we
have some rabies out here,'' said Moffatt.
   He explained a clothesline could be a hazard ``if constructed so
it restricts the vision of a person taking a car around a corner so
they couldn't negotiate the corner in a safe and orderly manner.''
   A first violation carries a $100 fine, which increases to $500
for a third infraction before a scofflaw can be charged with a
misdemeanor and put in jail. The ordinance will be enforced only
when a citizen files a complaint.

<HEAD>President Denounced For Intervening To Stop Soldiers' Trial</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Liberal politicians and a
legal expert today criticized President P.W. Botha for halting the
murder trial of six soldiers charged with the killing of an
activist in South-West Africa.
   Helen Suzman, Parliament member for the anti-apartheid
Progressive Federal Party, noted that Botha's action came a week
after he refused to intervene to spare ``the Sharpeville Six'' _ a
group of blacks sentenced to hang for complicity in a 1984 mob
killing of a black town councilor.
   Despite an international clemency campaign, Botha said his
policy was to avoid interfering with the judicial process. Last
Thursday, after Botha's pronouncement, a judge granted a one-month
stay of execution to the six in order to consider claims that a
state witness committed perjury.
   In light of Botha's refusal to intervene in the Sharpeville
case, Mrs. Suzman said she was ``astonished'' that the president
``did not allow the ordinary course of justice to be followed'' in
the case of the soldiers in South-West Africa.
   Botha ordered the attorney general of the territory, commonly
known as Namibia, to halt prosecution under the Defense Act, which
exempts security forces members from court action if they act ``in
good faith'' in combating suspected terrorism.
   The six soldiers _ four officers and two enlisted men _ were
accused of arranging for 50 black soldiers to disguise themselves
in civilian clothes, arm themselves with spears and knives, and
disrupt a political rally in 1985.
   The rally was sponsored by the South-West African People's
Organization, which seeks independence from South Africa. SWAPO's
outlawed military wing has been waging a guerrilla war since 1966.
   The man fatally stabbed at the rally, Immanuel Shifidi, was a
SWAPO member.
   Dirk van Zyl Smit, a criminology professor at the University of
Cape Town, said Botha's intervention was the worst type of
executive interference because, unlike a pardon or reprieve, it
occurred before a judgment had been made.
   Dave Dalling, a Progressive Federal member of Parliament, said
Botha's action placed the army above the law and undermined public
confidence in the judiciary.
   In the Namibian capital, Windhoek, the local bar association
expressed ``shock and disbelief'' at Botha's action.
   The Labor Party, which represents most of the territory's
mixed-race people, said Botha's ``arbitrary decision ... may give
rise to further public violence, bloodshed and chaos.''

   When Eleanore Rose holds a burial next week for
her murdered daughter, allegedly a victim of killer Ted Bundy 14
years ago, the casket will contain Denise's favorite dress, a rose
and some photos.
   But there will be no remains.
   King County authorities, who had kept the bones of 18-year-old
Denise Naslund as part of their investigation of the alleged serial
killer, misplaced them shortly after they were found in 1974 in a
wooded area in the Cascade foothills east of Seattle.
   A lawsuit filed by Ms. Rose and relatives against the county was
settled recently out of court and details were not made public. But
Ms. Rose said the settlement, and next Wednesday's memorial, are
little consolation.
   ``I can't forget the remains were lost,'' she said Tuesday.
``Her being murdered was bad enough. ... All those years they told
me they would give the remains back.''
   In 1974, police agreed to temporarily place the remains in the
casket so a memorial service could be held. Afterward, they were
taken away by detectives, and the casket wrapped in plastic and
placed in the funeral home's basement.
   Ten years later, when Ms. Rose sought to have them released for
burial, she learned they had mysteriously disappeared, possibly in
an office move or an accidental cremation, which would violate her
Roman Catholic beliefs.
   Losing the remains ``is almost, to me, sacrilegious. It's almost
like a crime was committed,'' she said.
   When the service is held at Forest Lawn Cemetery in Seattle, Ms.
Naslund's casket will hold some of her personal effects, including
a favorite floral-print dress. Her mother said she plans to add a
silk rose, photos of herself and her daughter, a crucifix and some
letters.
   In one letter, county officials express their regret at losing
Ms. Naslund's remains. Another note is from Ms. Rose to her
daughter, ``Dear Denise, God forgive them for what they have done.
I love you, Mom.''
   Ms. Naslund, along with Janice Ott, disappeared on July 14,
1974. Two months later, the bones of the women were found scattered
in a remote area. The cause of death was not positively determined.
   No charges in Washington were ever filed against Bundy, who is
on death row in Florida after receiving three death sentences for
the 1978 murders of two Florida State University sorority sisters
and the February 1978 kidnap, rape and murder of a 12-year-old Lake
City, Fla., girl.
   However, Bundy has been described by King County police as their
prime suspect in the unsolved slayings of Ms. Naslund, Ms. Ott and
six other young women in western Washington in 1974.
   In Ms. Rose's Seattle home, the walls of the small kitchen are
crowded with photographs of her daughter, whose bedroom remains
much the same as it was when she disappeared. Ms. Naslund's 1964
Chevrolet Impala is still parked outside.

<HEAD>Quakers Use Telemarketing To Reach Prospective New Members</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GREENSBORO, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Telemarketing, a sales strategy usually
associated with business, is gaining popularity in the Religious
Society of Friends, a group not known for evangelism.
   In Kernersville, a handful of Quakers with telephones, address
lists and friendly voices hope to gather a new weekly meeting.
   On Tuesday night, they gathered at the former site of Spruce
Pines Friends Meeting, a dwindling church that finally closed in
November. Quakers from Winston-Salem, Kernersville, Archdale and
Charlotte dial nightly in a four-week campaign that has yielded
more than 200 requests for information since Sunday.
   ``Hi. This is Archie Creed with the new North View Friends
Church that will be opening off Piney Grove Road in May,'' said the
church's pastor in a call to a prospective member.
   Creed first asks if the person is actively involved in a local
church. If they say yes, he thanks them for their time. If they say
no, Creed asks if the church can mail them a brochure.
   Each call is ranked according to the person's response: fair,
good, very good, excellent. ``First one tonight!'' exclaimed Ethel
Holmes, a volunteer from Kernersville, after she marked one
response ``excellent.''
   ``Most of them are receptive, even if they attend another
church,'' she said. ``I have had no hangups.''
   Holmes is sold on this unconventional method of evangelism.
   ``People do not respond to door-knocking real well,'' she
explained. But they usually don't mind a phone call, she said.
   The goal is 25,000 calls, which Creed hopes will produce a
mailing list of 2,500 names.
   He expects more than 200 people at the church's first official
service May 15.
   Steve Wood, pastor of Battle Forest Friends Church in northwest
Greensboro, is also sold on telemarketing.
   His congregation recently completed an 8,000-call campaign. On
Sunday, the 85-member congregation will celebrate its telephonic
fruits at a service for new members.
   Wood, a part-time real estate agent, got the idea from
telemarketing advertisements in real estate magazines. If it works
for business, he thought, why not use it in the church?
   Door-to-door visitation was out because it takes too much time
for too few results, Wood said.
   So far, telemarketing by Quakers has been very successful, says
Billy Britt, superintendent of the N.C. Friends Yearly Meeting. In
Southern California, such campaigns produced seven new churches, he
said.
   About one percent of those called end up joining the church,
which means Battle Forest can expect to add about 60 people to its
rolls.
   If other Quakers object to the technique, they haven't told him
about it.
   ``There has been no opposition to it,'' Britt said. ``It is
aimed at the unchurched. There's no high pressure.''

   Coastal residents were jolted awake
by a moderate earthquake and aftershock today, prompting worried
calls to police and radio stations, but there were no reports of
injury or damage.
   The first shock, measuring 3.9 on the Richter Scale, hit at
12:42 a.m. and was centered 11 miles southeast of downtown Santa
Barbara, said Robert Finn, spokesman for the seismology lab at the
California Institute of Technology in Pasadena.
   ``At 12:57 there was an aftershock in the same location with a
2.7 magnitude,'' Finn said. ``These quakes weren't strong enough to
do much damage, but a lot of people felt them.''
   About 30 shaken sleepers telephoned Santa Barbara County
sheriff's headquarters to confirm what they felt, said Deputy Larry
Ralston.
   ``They were just concerned and curious, or like one who wanted
to know if he had been dreaming,'' Ralston said.
   The early morning quake was centered about 75 miles northwest of
downtown Los Angeles.

<TEXT>
   A $52 million grant from the Moody
Foundation will be used to build a towering greenhouse housing
exotic plants from tropical rain forests, officials say.
   Besides the tropical indoor gardens, there will be a 400-seat
theater featuring a three-dimensional film, a plant-science center
and a garden restaurant, foundation officials announced Tuesday.
   All are part of the foundation's 142-acre, $120 million botanic
garden, research and entertainment complex on Galveston Island.
   The one-acre preserve will grow inside a facility foundation
officials said will be 12 to 15 stories tall. It is scheduled to
open in early 1993, said E. Douglas McLeod, the foundation's
director of development.
   Galveston Mayor Jan Coggeshall said she was grateful to the
foundation for the project, which is expected to attract thousands
of visitors and subsequently pump more tourist dollars into the
community.
   ``I think it (the project) is a symbol of Galveston's future,''
Ms. Coggeshall said. ``It is a living part of our future on the
island.''
   Moody Gardens will have a movable viewing platform so visitors
can see the gardens from different levels. There will be streams,
trails, waterfalls and plants representing the tropical rainforests
of Asia, Africa and both Americas. Two conservatories also are
planned.
   Not included in the $52-million phase but part of the
development is a beach area called Palm Beach, which will feature
white sand imported from Orlando, Fla. The sand arrived Saturday
and will be spread over a three-acre area later this spring.
   The Moody Foundation was established in 1942 by wealthy
businessman William Lewis Moody Jr. and his wife, Libbie Shearn
Moody, and is still controlled by family members.

<HEAD>Maria DeSillers Finds More Donations, Ordered To Turn Them Over</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge has ordered Maria DeSillers to turn over
additional donations that she recently told officials she had
received for her late son's liver transplants.
   All undeposited contributions must be listed and handed over to
a court-appointed curator today, Dade Circuit Judge Francis J.
Christie said Tuesday.
   Curator Karen Gievers requested the order after Ms. DeSillers
said Friday that she had found a ``substantial amount'' of unopened
mail last November in warehouse where she stored furniture and
other possessions.
   The carton of mail included checks and cash donated for
DeSillers' 7-year-old son, Ronnie, who died April 29 at Children's
Hospital of Pittsburgh while awaiting his fourth liver transplant.
   When Ronnie's need for a liver transplant was publicized last
year, donations were received from well-wishers throughout the
country, including $1,000 from President Reagan.
   An audit by the Florida Secretary of State found that Ms.
DeSillers received almost $1 million in donations, of which about
$175,000 could not be accounted for.
   Ms. DeSillers' lawyer said Tuesday that for four months his
client didn't deposit the newly found donations, which he said
totaled only a few hundred dollars.
   ``She has kept everything segregated and stapled together,''
attorney Harry Robbins said. ``She figured if she made any more
deposits it wasn't going to look good.''
   The state has charged Ms. DeSillers with using donations for her
personal expenses and failing to register Ronnie's fund as a
charity. Ms. DeSillers, who faces a maximum $1,000 fine, will
contest the charges at a May 10 hearing.
   State investigators say Ms. DeSillers withdrew at least $47,000
in donations to buy jewelry, clothing and furniture, pay rent on
her Miami bayfront apartment and return $5,000 loaned to her by a
former boyfriend.
   Last fall, Children's Hospital sued Ms. DeSillers after she
refused to pay $262,000 of the $424,300 bill that remained from her
son's transplants. Ms. DeSillers claimed the boy received poor
care, which hospital officials deny.
   Meanwhile, the Dade County State Attorney's Office is continuing
a criminal investigation into whether Ms. DeSillers committed fraud
or theft by using some of the donations for her expenses.
   Earlier this month, Christie froze the boy's estate and
appointed Ms. Gievers to oversee the $239,287 that remained in the
child's bank account.
   When Ms. Gievers learned of the undeposited funds last week, she
requested that the money be turned over to her immediately. By
Tuesday, when she had not received the money, she filed the
petition in the Dade court.
   The money will be deposited in a restricted, interest-bearing
account until the court rules how the remaining funds will be
distributed, Ms. Gievers said.
   Robbins has said his client did not misuse any of the donations
and that she is entitled to the estate because she is the boy's
natural heir.

<HEAD>Bishop Calls On Catholics To Quit IRA</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Irish</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Roman Catholic bishop whose
diocese includes the IRA stronghold of Catholic west Belfast said
today the outlawed guerrilla organization is ``sheer evil.''
   ``The IRA poses a very grave spiritual danger to the Catholic
community and we must realize that and have no illusions about
it,'' said Bishop Cahal Daly in an interview with Radio Ulster, the
British Broadcasting Corp.'s local Northern Ireland station.
   ``This is a question of sheer evil and we have got to face that
evil and have no truck with it,'' he declared.
   Daly is bishop of Down and Connor. The diocese includes west
Belfast where two British soldiers were killed Saturday when they
drove up to the funeral cortege for Irish Republican Army guerrilla
Kevin Brady.
   In scenes that shocked television audiences around the world,
members of the Catholic crowd in the funeral cortege for Brady
dragged the soldiers from the car, stripped them naked and beat
them unconscious with iron bars before IRA gunmen shot them dead.
   Daly in a statement Tuesday declared: ``IRA violence is often
disguised with a mask of romantic rhetoric and militaristic mock
ritual. For a ghastly half-hour on Saturday, the mask slipped. The
real face of IRA violence was shown and it was horrible to see.''
   He said the crowd Saturday had a right to fear that they were
going to be attacked. The previous Wednesday a Protestant extremist
killed three people and wounded 68 in an attack on an IRA funeral.
   ``But let us not be deceived. This was not a momentary lapse
from high IRA principles and standards. People would not have taken
iron bars in their hands to batter soldiers into unconsciousness if
they had not taken hatred into their hearts,'' he said in Tuesday's
statement.
   Daly pleaded with those who joined the IRA ``for idealistic
reasons and out of sense of justice'' to quit the organization.
   ``For God's sake, for Ireland's sake, let them leave the
organization now before still more grievous harm is done,'' he said.
   Sean Kenny, a Sinn Fein member of Belfast City Council,
dismissed the statement, saying the bishop was an apologist for the
British security forces. Sinn Fein is the IRA's legal political arm.
   Brady was one of three people killed in a gun and grenade attack
at the March 16 funeral at Milltown cemetery of three unarmed IRA
guerrillas killed by British troops in Gibraltar.
   Protestant Michael Stone was charged Tuesday with three counts
of murder in connection with the cemetery deaths and with murdering
three other Catholics in sniper attacks.
   The predominantly Catholic IRA is fighting to unite Northern
Ireland with the Irish Republic.

   The 71-year-old Socialist announced on nationwide television
Tuesday that he will seek re-election next month. Prior to his
announcement, opinion polls put him in the lead.
   Mitterrand told a TV interviewer he decided to run because he
thinks disunity threatens ``to tear the social fabric'' of France.
   ``I saw a risk that the country might fall again into the
quarrels and divisions that have hampered it so often. I want
France to be united ... not be taken in hand by the spirit of
intolerance, by parties who want everything, by clans, by
cliques,'' he said.
   After Mitterrand declared, Michel Rocard, until now the
Socialist Party's only candidate, withdrew and gave his full
support to the incumbent. The main conservative candidates are
Premier Jacques Chirac and former Premier Raymond Barre.
   The first round of the elections is to be held April 24 with a
run-off between the top two candidates scheduled for May 8.
   Mitterrand led the leftist surge in May 1981 that ousted
President Valery Giscard d'Estaing and the center-right alliance
that had controlled the National Assembly for 23 years.
   The victory avenged Mitterrand's defeats in the presidential
elections of 1965 by Charles de Gaulle and 1974 by Giscard
d'Estaing.
   But France's love affair with the Socialists was short-lived.
   After five years, French voters in the March 1986 parliamentary
elections returned control to the right _ creating what became
known in France as ``cohabitation'' between a Socialist president
and a conservative premier.
   Socialist policies had dragged Mitterrand's popularity rating in
public opinion polls as low as 27 percent, but under the unwanted
marriage with the conservatives it soared again to a consistent 55
percent or more.
   That gave Mitterrand the dubious honor of being, in one
seven-year term, both the least and most popular chief executive in
the 30 years of the Fifth Republic.
   In the beginning of his administration, Mitterrand pursued
costly social programs after the Socialists gained power. Then he
reversed course, instituting austerity measures.
   Economic troubles brought his party to power, and caused its
downfall five years later. After the Socialist defeat, Mitterrand
eased into the role of elder statesman and held himself above the
day-to-day battles of governing, commenting on issues only
occasionally.
   The French called him ``Tonton,'' or uncle.
   Mitterrand was born Oct. 26, 1916, in Jarnac and attended
universities in Paris, earning degrees in law and letters. He was
drafted into the army in 1938, and shot and captured during the
German invasion in 1940.
   Mitterrand escaped from a prison camp in Germany, returned to
France and created a Resistance network. His feud with de Gaulle
began when Mitterrand refused to unite his Resistance group with de
Gaulle's.
   It was in the Resistance days that he met Danielle Gouze, and
they married in 1944, soon after France was liberated. He held
several government posts, including interior and justice minister.
   In the early 1970s he built the moribund Socialist Party into a
major political force, but the Union of the Left he formed with the
Communists fell apart in 1977.
   Not until the final days of the 1981 campaign did the two main
leftist parties join forces again to defeat Giscard and oust the
conservatives.
   Mitterrand shocked much of the West by bringing Communists into
his government, but the union lasted only three years. In 1984, the
Communists pulled out in a dispute over economic policy.

<HEAD>Diaphragm Maker To Challenge Toxic Shock Ruling</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Ortho Pharmaceutical Corp. says it will
challenge a state appellate court's decision upholding a jury's
verdict that the diaphragm manufacturer was responsible for a
woman's toxic shock syndrome.
   In a 36-page ruling Tuesday, the middle-level Court of Appeals
said there was sufficient evidence to justify a Maricopa County
Superior Court jury's $1.5 million verdict against Ortho,
manufacturer of the Ortho All-Flex diaphragm.
   The verdict was the first to hold a pharmaceutical manufacturer
responsible for a case of toxic shock syndrome, according to the
appellate court and the plaintiff's lawyer.
   TSS is an acute and sometimes fatal illness caused by a
bacterium, staphylococcus aureus, that produces a poison. The
ailment is most closely associated with tampon use.
   The case was brought in Phoenix by Roberta Baroldy, whose
physician prescribed an Ortho All-Flex diaphragm in April 1982,
about six weeks after the birth of her first child.
   Ortho Pharmaceutical has since issued warnings on the
possibility of toxic shock syndrome, but court records show that
the company had been warned by at least one doctor of a possible
TSS link nearly four months before Mrs. Baroldy's illness in July
1982 and had not publicized the warning.
   Mrs. Baroldy was hospitalized for 41 days and was ``at times
comatose and near death,'' the 3-0 appellate ruling noted.
   Mrs. Baroldy's medical witnesses testified that she would have
physical problems for the rest of her life as a result of the
disease.
   ``We will appeal,'' Ortho spokesman Rich Salem said Tuesday at
corporate headquarters in Raritan, N.J. ``Beyond that, we'd like a
chance to actually see the opinion before we comment further.''
   The company, a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson and has sold
millions of the contraceptive devices over more than 40 years,
according to court records.
   About 1.8 million diaphragms are sold each year in the United
States, Salem said, adding that he did not know Ortho's share of
the market.
   Ortho's attorneys argued on appeal that the theory under which
experts claimed that Mrs. Baroldy was stricken did not have the
required ``general acceptance'' in the scientific community.
   They also argued that the case should have been tried using
North Carolina laws because Mrs. Baroldy was in North Carolina at
the time of her illness while her husband was taking parachute
training at Fort Bragg.
   But the appeals court said it was satisfied that testimony from
a broad cross-section of experts showed general acceptance of a
link between diaphragms and TSS.
   And the judges said Arizona's product liability law was more
appropriate than North Carolina law because it was closer to the
laws in New Jersey, where Ortho is headquartered, and because the
Baroldys, who are from the Globe, Ariz. area, were living in Mesa
at the time the suit was tried.

   The U.N. Command today rebuked
communist North Korea for refusing to return the remains of U.S.
soldiers killed during the Korean War, officials said.
   The U.N. Command called for return of the remains at a meeting
with North Korean military officials at the Panmunjom truce site.
U.N. officials accused North Korea of aggravating tension on the
Korean peninsula.
   ``This irrational and inhumane action by your side on this issue
is totally unacceptable and will be denounced by all fair-minded
people and the community of civilized nations worldwide,'' said
U.S. Army Col. Charles Coffman, according to a U.N. statement.
   North Korea refused to return the remains of two U.S. soldiers
who died during the Korean War after the United States imposed
sanctions against the country in January for its alleged bombing of
a South Korean commercial jetliner.
   The United States, South Korea and other nations have accused
North Korea of bombing the airliner, killing all 115 people aboard,
last Nov. 29. North Korea has denied involvement.
   A woman who flew on an early part of the flight confessed in
January to being a North Korean agent and said she planted a bomb
on the Korean Air jet to disrupt the 1988 Olympic Games in Seoul.
   The two Americans whose remains are being sought by the U.S.
have been identified as 1st Lt. Jack J. Saunders of Utah and Cpl.
Arthur I. Seaton of Pennsylvania. They reportedly died in North
Korean prison camps in 1951.
   Coffman, acting as secretary of the U.N. Command, complained
that North Korea was trying to stir up tension on the Korean
peninsula.
   He also objected to repeated North Korean charges that military
exercises being held by U.S. and South Korean forces under the name
``Team Spirit'' were a prelude to a nuclear attack on the north.
   ``Your repetition of charges, and your repeat of your annual
litany of false allegations against Team Spirit _ filled with
abusive language, unfounded and irrelevant allegations _ obviously
satisifed your propaganda purposes,'' he said.
   About 200,000 U.S. and South Korean troops are taking part in
the annual exercises between now and April. The United States keeps
40,000 troops in South Korea under a mutual defense pact.
   The U.N. Command meets periodically with North Korean and
Chinese representatives for meetings of the Military Armistice
Commission to supervise disputes and violations of the cease-fire
that ended the Korean War in 1953.
   The war began in 1950 after North Korean forces invaded the
south and troops from the United States and other nations came to
the assistance of the south.

<TEXT>
   A $1-million-a-year program
has relocated 62 sea otters to an island off Southern California,
but 27 of the endangered beasts have vanished without a trace.
   ``Sure we're concerned,'' said Jim Estes, who is monitoring the
program for U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. ``We wish we had 62 sea
otters there. But we've only been at this six months. We need more
time with these animals.''
   In addition to 27 otters missing since Aug. 8 after being moved
to San Nicolas Island, about 60 miles off the coast, eight have
died and six are known to have left the area, the state Coastal
Commission learned Tuesday.
   ``We've lost most of the adults out there,'' Estes told the
commission, but added, ``we have only just begun to look for
animals that have dispersed from the island.''
   ``You stand before us and tell us that you can't account for
almost one-half of the population you transferred out there,''
Commissioner Dorrill Wright responded. He said he was ``very
unhappy'' about the report.
   The otters were the first of several groups to be airlifted over
five years to the small, rocky island that was once a breeding
ground of the animals, which were hunted to near extinction before
the turn of the century.
   The California population of sea otters numbers about 1,400 and
lives along a 300-mile stretch of the central California coast from
Morro Bay to Santa Cruz.
   The airlift to San Nicolas was part of an effort to establish
another population center for the animals off Southern California.
State and federal marine biologists say the California population
could be threatened with extinction if their breeding grounds are
hit with an oil spill or disease.
   The population transfer was opposed by local fishermen, who
feared that the otters would wipe out abalone, lobsters and other
marketable marine life.
   Of the eight otters that died, three perished from stress
related to the transfer, three drowned in lobster traps and fishing
nets, one was shot and one was found dead of unknown causes,
according to the report.
   Officials have acknowledged that at least six otters have eluded
recapture and managed to swim home to Monterey. Another was caught
off the northern Los Angeles County coastline and returned to its
original capture site, officials said.
   Wildlife officials hope to continue relocating sea otters to San
Nicolas Island.
   ``We've learned a lot and we are guardedly optimistic,'' said
David Riley, an assistant regional director with the U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service.
   Carol Fulton, representing Friends of the Sea Otter, a
Carmel-based group that claims 4,500 members nationwide, supported
the project.
   ``The issue has to be put in perspective,'' she said. ``We were
losing over 100 otters a year in fishermen's gill nets within their
present range.''

<DATELINE>ORANGEBURG, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A pastor who opposed his congregation's
decision to bar blacks from the church preschool has resigned at
the request of the church's deacons.
   ``It all goes back to the integration issue. I was like a toy
two children were fighting over,'' the Rev. Kenneth Newton said
about his resignation and the split among members of Northside
Baptist Church.
   In an unsigned letter to church members dated March 14, the
deacons said they unanimously recommended that Newton resign
immediately. The letter said the recommendation was based on
``matters of trustworthiness that had a significant effect on the
church.''
   Wyman Lawson, chairman of the deacons, would not comment on the
letter.
   Newton, however, said Monday the mistrust was mutual.
   ``The last pastor stayed here 16 months and said the deacons
would not cooperate with him and left. I was able to stay here 13{
years under adverse circumstances,'' Newton said.
   The deacons' letter said Newton was offered $10,000 in severance
pay. He accepted the money March 4 and resigned that day.
   Some church members who were opposed to the deacons' action sent
out a letter listing Newton's accomplishments. They said when
Newton first came to Northside in 1974, the church was $90,000 in
debt.
   The letter said the debt has been paid along with renovations to
the church, opening of the learning center for children and
purchase of 7.6 acres of land and seven houses. The group also said
the church's budget has increased from $60,000 to $500,000 under
Newton's leadership.
   In a secret vote last October, the congregation decided by a
two-thirds majority that blacks should not be accepted by Northside
Baptist Learning Center. Afterward, Newton attacked the decision
publicly, angering some congregants.

   It's a clammy situation, scientists admit.
   A year ago, a species of tiny clams believed to come from the
Asian coast were discovered in San Francisco Bay. Now, scientists
say, there are millions in the muck along the bottom.
   It's too early to determine if the clam might displace other
species in the bay, said Jim Carlton of the University of Oregon,
an authority on marine transplants.
   ``It's brand new, so the full-scale ecological consequences of
the invasion probably won't be measured for several years as we see
how it spreads and where,'' he said.
   Carlton plans to send some specimens to Asian scientists to
determine the clam's origins.
   At one time, the Soviet Union was thought to be the clam's home
because a similar mollusk was found there in the 1860s. ``We know
now that's not true,'' said Larry Schemel of the U.S. Geological
Survey. ``It appears right now that there's a higher probability
that the clam came from China.''
   One thing's certain, though, they said. There is little chance
the clam will end up on menus at the city's fashionable restaurants.
   ``The maximum size is half to three-quarters of an inch, so
we're not even talking about an hors d'oeuvre,'' Carlton said.

   Iranian gunboats attacked a Cypriot
freighter in the Persian Gulf today and set it ablaze, and Iraq
said a long-range missile fired by Iran hit Baghdad, killing and
wounding civilians.
   The International Committee of the Red Cross condemned the use
of chemical weapons in the 7{-year-old Iran-Iraq war, calling it a
``new and tragic escalation'' of the conflict, and said it had
taken urgent steps to end such attacks.
   The statement followed Iranian charges that Iraq killed or
wounded 5,000 people in chemical weapons attacks last week on
Kurdish border cities.
   The freighter attack was Iran's ninth raid on neutral commercial
shipping in six days.
   The stricken vessel was the Cypriot-flag 34,346-ton Odysseas H,
which had been in Saudi Arabia recently.
   Gulf-based shipping executives, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the captain reported his vessel was attacked by two
Iranian gunboats 10 miles west of the Strait of Hormuz, the entry
to the gulf, at 4:45 p.m. He reported a fire and requested aid.
   Salvage tugboats rushed out in the direction given by the master.
   The Iraqi News Agency reported that the missile lobbed by Iran
crashed at 7:30 a.m. into a residential neighorhood, ``killing and
wounding civilians and destroying property.''
   The agency, monitored in Cyprus, did not give an exact casualty
count. It acknowledged that Iraqi gunners fired a similar
projectile into Tehran on Tuesday.
   Two sailors were killed and nine others injured in an attack
Tuesday by Iranian gunboats and a helicopter on the Havglimt
tanker, which was hauling a load of ammonia through the gylf.
   The vessel, operated by the Oslo-based Havtor Co., was hit
northwest of the United Arab Emirates.
   The British destroyer HMS Exeter sent out a gas-masked medical
team to help the crew of the 38,534-ton ship, which flies the
Singapore flag.
   Dubai Port Authority officers identified the dead crewmen only
as Singapore nationals. Most of the injuries were due to inhalation
of ammonia vapors, maritime salvage sources reported.
   In Geneva, the International Committee of the Red Cross issued a
statement saying it had informed Iran of ``its readiness to provide
emergency assistance for the victims'' of chemical weapons attacks.
   Iran has repeatedly accused Iraq of using chemical weapons. Iraq
has denied the allegations.
   ``The use of chemical weapons, whether against military
personnel or civilians, is absolutely forbidden by international
law and is to be condemned at all times,'' the Red Cross said.
   It said the ICRC has ``taken urgent steps to bring to an
immediate end the use of chemical weapons.'' It did not elaborat

   The postmaster who found a stolen Claude
Monet painting worth $175,000 will get a pat on the back, but he
won't collect the $17,500 reward because he was simply doing his
job.
   Steve Reutter, spokesman for the St. Paul Fire & Marine
Insurance Co., which paid a $175,000 claim after the theft, said
postal rules prevent Charles Polley and other employees from
collecting rewards ``for things done in the line of duty.
   ``We asked them and that's what they said,'' Reutter said.
   ``I really didn't expect it,'' said Polley. ``You are here on a
payroll and that's the way it is.''
   Reutter said the company will make a ``good will'' offering to a
charity in Marshalltown in Polley's name. The amount and charity
haven't been decided, he said.
   The painting, ``Fishing Boats Under the Cliffs of Etretat,'' was
stolen from the Fisher Community Center March 19, 1987 and was
recovered this month when Polley found it in a mail drop box in
LeGrand, which is near Marshalltown.
   Polley said he has a metal detector and goes hunting for buried
treasures now and then, but the Monet discovery tops his list.
``I've found the gold ring,'' he said. ``That was the most valuable
thing I've ever found.''
   Art experts say the painting is damaged but restorable. The
Fisher Foundation, which operates the center, will keep the
insurance money to build a new gallery. The insurers have said
they'll probably auction the painting.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Most employers believe they benefit when workers
have good child care available, but the companies don't want to pay
for it, a survey of 141 businesses concludes.
   Nationwide, about 800 companies have developed child-care
centers on or near their business, according to the survey being
published in the April issue of Personnel Journal in Costa Mesa,
Calif. Most of these are large companies or public agencies.
   ``The majority of U.S. employers are not establishing child-care
centers,'' wrote the authors, Toni A. Campbell of San Jose State
University in California and David E. Campbell of Humboldt State
University in Arcata, Calif.
   On the other hand, they wrote in the survey released Tuesday,
most employers surveyed thought they should be involved in family
matters.
   The problems are money and information, the survey found.
   ``The question appears ... not to be whether employers might
involve themselves, but rather how they can get involved without
jeopardizing the bottom line,'' the authors wrote.
   ``Certainly the focus on expense is a major issue for small
businesses,'' they added.
   The survey found that eight of 10 companies surveyed believe
productivity and the quality of the work force will improve if the
organization helps employees with child-care problems.
   But 71 percent said they don't want to provide space at the work
site, and 69 percent said they don't want to subsidize child-care
programs.
   The researchers said many employers offer options involving work
schedules to help families. Flexible hours were offered by 60
percent of the companies surveyed; 71 percent offered part-time
work; 24 percent had job sharing; and 71 percent gave leaves to
care for a sick child.
   The researchers suggested that small companies could share the
cost of locating and implementing a child-care program for
employees. They said this could be coordinated through a local
Chamber of Commerce or a trade group.

   Harold Thomas spent harsh winter days in an open
shack, then took a job in New Mexico when a couple offered to
improve his life. Now he's back home looking for more work, and he
might write a book.
   The former homeless man returned to Chicago late Tuesday after
working for two months as a handyman. He said he appreciated the
chance to ``see a lot of America'' but the job given by Roy and
Ethel Gilman didn't provide steady wages.
   ``The Gilmans are fine people, but they didn't want to pay me,''
said Thomas, weary after riding a bus from Portales, N.M., a small
farming community.
   He said he lived in a trailer and worked six days a week, fixing
cars, erecting fences and other farm chores.
   ``But a man can't live on room and board alone. I want to start
a family, maybe get married,'' Thomas said.
   For nine months, Thomas, 34, lived in a shack just west of
downtown Chicago. The Gilmans read an Associated Press account of
his plight and offered him a job in mid-January.
   The Gilmans paid Thomas room and board and deposited $300 in
wages for him in a Portales bank about a month ago. On Monday,
Thomas withdrew the money and boarded a bus for Chicago.
   He said the money was put into an account after media reports
indicated he wasn't receiving a regular salary.
   ``I thought I'd get some wages,'' Thomas said. ``They treated me
very nice. They're nice, church-going people, but no wages.
   ``I didn't have a lot of time for things myself. When a fellow
turns and sees everything negative, what's a guy to do?'' he said.
   Thomas, wearing the clothes he received from well-wishers when
he left Chicago on Jan. 15, said he would be living with a
girlfriend at a public housing project on the North Side.
   ``I don't have a job, not right off,'' he said. ``But I've got a
few ideas of my own. I'm going to be looking. I've got a few
dollars in my pocket to last me awhile.
   ``I'm thinking about writing a book. A lot of people look down
on the homeless. I just want everyone to know people on the street
aren't junk.''
   Mrs. Gilman, 68, said Thomas was treated as well as ``our own
family.''
   She said past news reports about wages may have contributed to
Thomas' departure.
   Mrs. Gilman said people who read those stories had ``been
calling us from everywhere saying we've been trying to make a slave
out of Harold. All we did was try to help him.''
   Thomas said he hasn't forgotten his homeless friends, many of
whom seek shelter in the wooden shack he built last year along the
Chicago River.
   ``I've got to see my friends,'' he said before hopping in a cab.
``We've got a lot to talk about.''

   President Francois Mitterrand said he will seek
re-election because he can rise above France's fractious politics
and keep the country together.
   The 71-year-old Socialist announced on nationwide television
Tuesday that he will seek re-election next month. Prior to his
announcement, opinion polls put him in the lead.
   Mitterrand told a TV interviewer he decided to run because he
thinks disunity threatens ``to tear the social fabric'' of France.
   ``I saw a risk that the country might fall again into the
quarrels and divisions that have hampered it so often. I want
France to be united ... not be taken in hand by the spirit of
intolerance, by parties who want everything, by clans, by
cliques,'' he said.
   After Mitterrand declared, Michel Rocard, until now the
Socialist Party's only candidate, withdrew and gave his full
support to the incumbent. The main conservative candidates are
Premier Jacques Chirac and former Premier Raymond Barre.
   The first round of the elections is to be held April 24 with a
run-off between the top two candidates scheduled for May 8.
   Mitterrand led the leftist surge in May 1981 that ousted
President Valery Giscard d'Estaing and the center-right alliance
that had controlled the National Assembly for 23 years.
   The victory avenged Mitterrand's defeats in the presidential
elections of 1965 by Charles de Gaulle and 1974 by Giscard
d'Estaing.
   But France's love affair with the Socialists was short-lived.
   After five years, French voters in the March 1986 parliamentary
elections returned control to the right _ creating what became
known in France as ``cohabitation'' between a Socialist president
and a conservative premier.
   Socialist policies had dragged Mitterrand's popularity rating in
public opinion polls as low as 27 percent, but under the unwanted
marriage with the conservatives it soared again to a consistent 55
percent or more.
   That gave Mitterrand the dubious honor of being, in one
seven-year term, both the least and most popular chief executive in
the 30 years of the Fifth Republic.
   In the beginning of his administration, Mitterrand pursued
costly social programs after the Socialists gained power. Then he
reversed course, instituting austerity measures.
   Economic troubles brought his party to power, and caused its
downfall five years later. After the Socialist defeat, Mitterrand
eased into the role of elder statesman and held himself above the
day-to-day battles of governing, commenting on issues only
occasionally.
   The French called him ``Tonton,'' or uncle.
   Mitterrand was born Oct. 26, 1916, in Jarnac and attended
universities in Paris, earning degrees in law and letters. He was
drafted into the army in 1938, and shot and captured during the
German invasion in 1940.
   Mitterrand escaped from a prison camp in Germany, returned to
France and created a Resistance network. His feud with de Gaulle
began when Mitterrand refused to unite his Resistance group with de
Gaulle's.
   It was in the Resistance days that he met Danielle Gouze, and
they married in 1944, soon after France was liberated. He held
several government posts, including interior and justice minister.
   In the early 1970s he built the moribund Socialist Party into a
major political force, but the Union of the Left he formed with the
Communists fell apart in 1977.
   Not until the final days of the 1981 campaign did the two main
leftist parties join forces again to defeat Giscard and oust the
conservatives.
   Mitterrand shocked much of the West by bringing Communists into
his government, but the union lasted only three years. In 1984, the
Communists pulled out in a dispute over economic policy.

<HEAD>Wind, Heat and Possibly Gasoline Fueled Burma's Worst Fire</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RANGOON, Burma (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Strong winds and possibly gasoline stored
for the black market helped fuel Burma's worst fire, which killed
113 people in a northern city, official sources said today.
   The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said schools
and monasteries were being used to house some of the 20,000 people
left homeless by the blaze Sunday in Lashio, a city of 200,000
people in the northern Shan states. The local People's Council was
handling relief measures, they said.
   Lashio could not be reached by telephone from Rangoon today.
   Government radio reported Tuesday that the blaze swept through
2,096 buildings within two hours after starting in a kitchen. It
said the fire spread so quickly that many victims were trapped by
the flames.
   In addition to the deaths, 64 people suffered serious burns, the
radio said.
   The official sources said most of the destroyed or damaged
buildings were shanty houses. They attributed the fire's rapid
spread to the afternoon heat, strong wind and possibly gasoline.
The storage of gasoline for the black market is a common practice
in Burma.
   The casualty toll was the largest ever reported in a fire in
Burma.
   The radio said more than 3,000 families lost their homes, and
damages were estimated at about $10 million.
   Lashio, 450 miles northeast of Rangoon, is the largest city and
business center in the northern Shan states and the seat of the
northeast military command.

<HEAD>`A Year in the Life' Among Broadcast Award Winners</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``A Year in the Life'' and the ABC Afterschool
Special ``Supermom's Daughter'' were among 19 programs honored by
the American Women in Radio and Television for realistically
depicting the roles of women today.
   ``We're raising the sensibilities of producers'' by honoring
programs that wrestle with ``people, issues and relationships,''
said Marlene Belles, controller of KTVU-TV in San Francisco and
president of the women's broadcasting organization.
   ``People still want to be entertained. But the shoot-em-ups are
not nearly as popular,'' she said at the awards ceremony Tuesday.
   Modernizing the role of women on television is difficult because
the number of women in top broadcast management remains
``minuscule,'' Ms. Belles said.
   ``There is still discrimination. It's just more subtle now,''
she said. ``The old boys still run the networks. It's probably
going to get worse before it gets better.''
   ``Today Show'' co-anchor Jane Pauley and Sally Jessy Raphael,
the first nationally syndicated female talk show host, were among
the presenters during the awards luncheon at the Waldorf-Astoria
Hotel.
   Winners were selected from a field of 344 television, cable and
radio programs.
   Universal Studios' ``A Year in the Life'' captured the
television entertainment category for depicting a successful
professional woman who refuses to accept traditional views about
marriage.
   The children's programming winner, ``Supermom's Daughter,''
portrayed a gifted science student torn between fulfilling her own
dreams or satisfying the wishes of her career-oriented mother.
   KUOM Radio at the University of Minnesota was honored for a
documentary in which battered women discussed their plight. WGBH
Radio in Boston won the entertainment category for its story of
American composer Ruth Crawford Seeger.
   Other radio winners were:
   _WTOP, Washington, D.C., ``Are Women Making it in America?''
   _WTSO, Madison, Wis., ``Invisible Voices: Women in the Dane
County Jail.''
   _Michigan Sampler, Kalamazoo, Mich., ``Michigan Pioneer Women.''
   _Solz Advertising, St. Louis, health-care commercial.
   _WINS, New York City, ``Topic: Rape.''
   Other television winners were:
   _WMAQ, Chicago, ``Sexism in City Hall.''
   _KNBC, Burbank, Calif., ``The Spirit of Southern California.''
   _Lifetime Cablevision, ``Generations _ Reflections on Women.''
   _McDonald Davis and Associates, Milwaukee, health-care
commercial.
   _WTBS, Atlanta, ``Between the Lines: National Women's Studies
Association.''
   _WWOR, Secaucus, N.J., ``Victims Fight Back.''
   _ABC News 20-20, ``Triumph Over Darkness.''
   _WMBD, Peoria, Ill., ``Farm Wife Financier.''
   _WJLA, Washington, D.C., ``Women of Love _ Women of Power.''

<HEAD>FDA: Searle Did Not Mislead On IUD Safety</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An initial review of court documents
indicates that the manufacturer of the Copper-7 birth control
device did not attempt to mislead federal regulators about its
potential hazards, a government spokeswoman says.
   G.D. Searle & Co. is being sued by women who claim use of the
intrauterine device caused them to develop pelvic infections.
   A lawyer for one of the plaintiffs contends court documents
indicate an attempt to conceal known health threats from the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration. The papers were unsealed by a judge's
order.
   FDA spokeswoman Susan Cruzan said Tuesday that investigators met
with Searle officials March 16 to go over the documents.
   ``The FDA has not had any reason to withdraw approval of the
Copper-7 IUD,'' she said, adding that could be the ultimate penalty
if the FDA determined the company did misrepresent the product.
   Cruzan said the FDA will continue to review documents that are
unsealed in the case brought by Esther Kociemba of Melrose, who
claims that the Copper-7 made her infertile.
   Her attorney, Michael Ciresi of Minneapolis, has said the
unsealed documents ``will collectively establish without a doubt
that the Copper-7 causes (infection) and Searle knew about it but
did not disclose it to doctors or to women.''
   Ciresi said Tuesday he could not comment on Cruzan's initial
assessment because he does not know which documents the FDA
reviewed.
   Mrs. Kociemba's case against Searle is scheduled to go to trial
May 16 in federal court in St. Paul.
   The Copper-7 was approved for public use in 1974. From then
until 1986, when Searle withdrew it from the market because of
mounting litigation costs, it was the most popular IUD in the
United States. Searle recently resumed manufacturing the device to
fill foreign orders.
   Searle, which maintains that the device is safe, has won 14 of
the 17 cases that have gone to court and says it has settled
several hundred out of court.
   Searle is a unit of Monsanto Co. of St. Louis.

<HEAD>Tennessee Williams' Papers Go To Harvard, But Literary Rights With
Sister</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KEY WEST, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tennessee Williams' sister will maintain
literary rights to the late playwright's documents and personal
files, but Harvard University may take possession of them for
study, a judge has ruled.
   Williams, whose plays included ``A Streetcar Named Desire'' and
``Cat On a Hot Tin Roof,'' died in New York City in 1983 at 71. He
willed to Harvard a bundle of papers, reportedly appraised at
$175,000, that include plays and other manuscripts, some
unpublished.
   Trustees for 78-year-old Rose Williams, who has long been
institutionalized, wanted the papers given ``in trust'' so the
manuscripts could be sold if she needed money. Trustee John Eastman
of New York said Miss Williams' annual expenses average $200,000.
   Harvard maintained it had the right to possession of the papers,
now held in vaults by estate executor Southeast Bank in Miami.
   At a hearing Tuesday, one of the final steps toward distribution
of the Williams' estate, Monroe County Circuit Judge Helio Gomez
said he found no reason why the school could not take the papers.
   Harvard attorney Frank Connors promised Miss Williams' trustees
she will receive the earnings of any publication or documents with
commercial value. Williams' royalties totaled $3.1 million from
February 1984 to August 1987, he added.
   ``We are not taking the literary rights,'' Connors said. ``We
are simply talking about the papers physically being there (at
Harvard) where scholars can see them.''
   Miss Williams has been at the private Stony Lodge Sanitarium in
Ossining, N.Y., for 53 years. She underwent a lobotomy decades ago.
Many of Williams' plays are said to reflect his feelings toward his
sister and other people who are lonely or mentally disabled.
   The papers in question include some unpublished plays and
manuscripts, said attorney Jim Hendrick, who represents Miss
William's trustees.

   Democrat Albert Gore Jr. today called on
the government to ``straighten out its economic policy'' to make
heavy industry more competitive worldwide.
   The Tennessee senator, campaigning in Michigan for a share of
the 138 delegates at stake in Saturday's caucuses, made his plea
during a tour of a giant iron ore processing plant in the state's
Upper Peninsula.
   Gore spoke informally with some of the 700 workers at the Tilden
mining company facility, and then noted the plant's reduced
production, which officials attributed to lowered demands.
   The candidate said the plant ``is competitive so long as the
competition is not unfairly subsidized.''
   ``We need to straighten out our economic policy and stop
borrowing $500 million every 24 hours so that we're competitive in
the world economy _ and we have to take steps to remove unfair
trade barriers overseas,'' he said.
   Gore donned a hard hat to tour the facility where iron ore is
minded and rendered into small pellets. He walked amid large,
whirling cylinders that grind and filter the iron and peered inside
a giant rotating kiln that bakes the final product.
   ``It's an amazing place, isn't it. It's like the inside of a
death star,'' Gore said in apparent reference to the ``Star Wars''
movie trilogy.
   Gore was seeking votes in the state's sparsely populated Upper
Peninsula for a second day today after attacking Vice President
George Bush and the Reagan administration before high school and
college audiences Tuesday.
   He was heading to Wisconsin later today to address the state
legislature in Madison. Aiming toward Wisconsin's April 5 primary,
Gore began airing television commercials there this week lashing
out at corporate greed.
   Gore said Bush represents the choice for voters to ``continue
what we're doing'' without change. Denouncing that choice, he cited
the Iran-Contra affair, U.S. support for Panama strongman Manuel
Noriega in the face of evidence of drug involvement until recently,
and what he said was a general feeling of economic pessimism among
America's youth.
   ``I think if we continue what we're doing now, continuing down
the same path, we're headed for trouble,'' he told high school
students who jammed an auditorium for an after-school rally in
Traverse City.
   He repeated those themes later in a speech to more than 1,000
students at Lake Superior State University in Sault Ste. Marie.
   He denounced Bush as lacking the ``gumption'' to disagree with
President Reagan's veto on the civil rights bill, which Congress
voted to override. Gore dropped plans to campaign in Wisconsin on
Tuesday so that he could return to Washington to vote to override
the veto.
   ``I was quite surprised that George Bush belatedly announced he
was in favor of the veto _ that surprised many people,'' Gore said.
``But of course he has not been willing to disagree with President
Reagan on anything.''
   Gore campaigned in northern Michigan as polls of the state's
Democrats, published by both Detroit newspapers, showed him
trailing far behind rivals Jesse Jackson and Michael Dukakis.
Democrat Richard Gephardt is also campaigning in Michigan, which is
a do-or-die state for his White House hopes.
   Facing those long odds, Gore has not waged an intensive Michigan
campaign and has aired radio but no television commercials. Much of
Gore's Michigan organization is based on the support of key state
legislators, including a legislative power from the northern
region, Dominic Jacobitti.
   Gore largely avoided mention of his Democratic rivals, however.
The closest he came was saying the country needs a president ``with
foreign policy experience'' _ something he has in the past charged
Dukakis with lacking.
   Gore appeared before an enthusiastic audience of college
students in Sault Ste. Marie and contended, ``I am the first
presidential candidate to campaign in Sault Ste. Marie since Teddy
Roosevelt.''

   Old Glory is a source of noise
pollution and has to come down at night, health officials say, but
Thomas ``Ski'' Demski calls that demand unpatriotic and has raised
another flag to say ``Don't Tread On Me.''
   Demski, 57, flies a large American flag from a 132-foot flagpole
outside his home day and night. But neighbors have been complaining
they can't sleep because of the flapping noise.
   Recent noise-meter measurements by city health officials found
the flag exceeded legal limits for residential areas. They ordered
Demski to take his flag down every night at 10 p.m.
   But despite his neighbors' objections and the city order, Demski
says he won't strike the colors. Instead, he hoisted the
Revolutionary War-era banner that reads ``Don't Tread On Me.''
   ``When they start picking on the flag, I'll go to jail over it
if necessary,'' said the bumper sticker manufacturer, who has
expressed interest in becoming mayor of Long Beach, 25 miles south
of downtown Los Angeles.

   PTL lost nearly $1 million in February,
but the leader of the television ministry says he still hopes to
have more than $4 million to pay debts on May 2.
   David Clark said on the New PTL Club show Tuesday that he has
been trying to ``contain costs'' and to ``refocus this ministry on
the things of God.''
   In his February report to Bankruptcy Judge Rufus Reynolds, Clark
noted the auction scheduled April 12 of several parcels of land
owned by PTL, including the parsonage in Tega Cay where Jim and
Tammy Bakker lived before they were forced from the ministry. That
house is valued at $1 million.
   PTL is hoping to raise $4 million above expenses by May, when
the ministry will reorganize into non-profit and profit
corporations.
   Clark's report shows PTL revenues in February of $2.8 million
and expenses of $3.7 million. Net losses since last June 13 are
more than $4 million.

   A date for the next superpower summit and
progress on arms control and human rights appeared in the offing
today as Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze neared the
end of three days of talks here.
   His call on President Reagan at the White House was expected to
complete plans for a summit in late May in Moscow with Soviet
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev at which the two sides hope to sign a
treaty slashing their arsenals of long-range nuclear weapons by 30
to 50 percent.
   ``The negotiations are going fairly well,'' Shevardnadze said
Tuesday night as he returned to the State Department for another
round of talks with Secretary of State George P. Shultz over a
buffet dinner of hot dogs, potato salad and popcorn. Arrangements
also were made to show the film ``That's Entertainment,'' a
retrospective of Hollywood musicals, during breaks in the
discussions.
   As they renewed their discussions this morning, Shultz told
reporters ``we did a fair amount'' of business even so. But, he
admitted, ``I`m not very big on popcorn.''
   The pair met for 6{ hours during the day and agreed their
session on arms control and human rights was ``businesslike,
straightforward, constructive and broad-ranging.''
   Evidently, it was not entirely harmonious, however. Charles E.
Redman, the State Department spokesman, said there were ``a few
laughs, a few arguments.'' He declined to provide any details.
   Shultz has been pressing the Soviets to relax their emigration
restrictions and liberalize cultural and religious practices. The
Soviets, on the other hand, have made an issue of the homeless
problem in the United States and what they describe as a poor civil
rights record.
   ``This time, it was a much more detailed discussion,'' Vadim
Perfilyev, the deputy Soviet foreign ministry spokesman, said. ``We
think that we have points where we have cooperation between our two
countries. and I think that now we have positive results. ... It is
much more of a two-way street.''
   During the day, Shultz and Shevardnadze also received brief
reports from U.S. and Soviet arms control experts. Discussion of
the conflicts in Afghanistan and Nicaragua _ wars in which the two
superpowers have armed rival forces _ was deferred until Wednesday.
   The arms control experts are trying to mesh U.S. and Soviet
drafts of treaty provisions to scrap 30 to 50 percent of the two
sides' long-range bombers, missiles and submarines and to devise
measures to ensure compliance with the accord.
   The treaty is the projected centerpiece of the summit meeting.
The treaty drafts also include data on the size and locations of
U.S. and Soviet long-range weapons.
   Assistant Secretary of State Rozanne L. Ridgway said Monday
there were ``blanks'' in the information the two sides had
exchanged. She said ``lots and lots'' of disagreements remain.
   Two veteran negotiators, Paul H. Nitze and Aleksei A. Obukhov,
headed the U.S. and Soviet expert groups. They were to report back
to Shultz and Shevardnadze on whether the differences narrowed.
   Reagan has said that if the treaty is not ready he might hold a
second meeting with Gorbachev later in the year to sign it.
   During a break in their talks, Shultz and Shevardnadze presided
Tuesday at the opening of a new communications center designed to
reduce the risk of nuclear war. Matching centers in Washington and
Moscow will be linked by satellite.
   The facility ``will help us to remove misunderstandings, and it
will help us to reduce the risk of any outbreaks of hostilities
between us,'' Shultz said.
   Shevardnadze said he hoped ``one day, when we will have done
away with any offensive arms, such centers will be used for more
humane purposes.''
   In contrast to that cooperative step, the two sides are in
conflict over Central America and Afghanistan.
   In a brief exchange with reporters, Shevardnadze backed away
from an earlier Soviet pledge to withdraw the Red Army from
Afghanistan even if negotiators fail to agree on conditions for
ending the war there.
   Arriving for his talks with Shultz, he declined to repeat the
pledge made by a Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman last week in
Moscow after negotiations deadlocked in Geneva.
   ``I don't know when he said that,'' Shevardnadze said in
Russian. ``We shall see. It is better to have the document signed
in Geneva. This is the better possibility.''

<TEXT>
   A Norwegian journalist on leave from his
newspaper to work for humanitarian organizations was killed in the
Ethiopian civil war, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said today.
   Viggo Gilberg of the newspaper Fredrikstad Blad apparently was
killed last week when the Eritrean Popular Liberation Front
attacked the city of Afabet, ministry spokesman Lasse Seim said.
Afabet is 95 miles north of Asmara, the provincial capital of
Eritrea.
   The rebels have been fighting for independence for Eritrea since
1962, when it was incorporated as a province of Ethiopia.
   The Eritrean Popular Liberation Front said it crushed three
infantry divisions of government troops and captured three Soviet
advisers in what it described as its biggest victory in the war.
   Soviet officials in Moscow said Tuesday that the Eritrean
separatists had taken three Soviet military advisers prisoner last
week and that a fourth Soviet was missing.
   Gilberg, 31, was working for the Star of Hope and the Eritrean
Relief Association when he was caught in the fighting, the national
NTB news agency reported.
   ``Gilberg was killed while following a relief transport of food,
medicines and blankets into a war zone where he knew there had been
fighting recently,'' the agency said.
   Seim said news of Gilberg's death reached Norway on Monday from
the Eritrean Relief Association. He said Norway had no details
about the situation and could not confirm the circumstances of the
journalist's death.
   Norway's nearest diplomatic mission is in Nairobi.
   NTB said Gilberg had visited Africa several times before,
including a recent visit to Mali to report about relief work there
by the Church's Emergency Aid.

   A West Virginia University professor
who worked as a consultant for Caterpillar Co. had his students spy
on competitors of two Caterpillar dealerships, but a school
official says there's no evidence the assignment was made to help
the professor's work.
   ``I think inappropriate things were asked of them. I think they
were in an uncomfortable situation and responded in an unfortunate
(manner),'' Provost Frank Franz said Tuesday.
   Two groups of graduate students in Marketing 321 polled
competitors of H.O. Penn Machinery Co. in Armonk, N.Y., and Yancey
Bros. in Atlanta, both Caterpillar dealers, according to Tuesday's
Wall Street Journal.
   The students obtained inventory and sales volume reports and
even new product information from competitors and gave the data to
the Caterpillar dealerships, according to the report.
   The aim of the assignment, according to instructor Terry Wilson,
was to give students a firsthand taste of the ethical issues
involved in industrial espionage.
   ``They'll be facing these issues every day of their career. They
have to learn to deal with them. I tell them to think through the
tradeoffs,'' Wilson told the Journal.
   However, he said his students no longer will be assigned similar
projects.
   Franz said there was no evidence the students' surveys were
conducted to help Wilson's consulting work.
   ``It's not clear from the article that there's any action that
professor Wilson took that was inappropriate,'' he said.
   Wilson won't be disciplined, said Cyril Logar, dean of the
College of Business and Economics, because he taught students about
the ethical considerations involved in the project, including
confidentiality, before the students began their work, although
``they still broke the rules, so to speak.''
   ``I thought I was doing them a favor,'' said H.O. Penn Machinery
marketing manager Milton Long, who helped direct students about
what to ask whom.
   The students identified themselves only as university students
during the surveys, and promised some dealerships that their
identities would remain confidential, the Journal said.
   However, ``there was pressure'' at H.O. Penn for students to
name the competing dealerships and that information was provided,
one of the students, Mark Wheatley, told the Wall Street Journal.
   ``It makes me shudder to think about it,'' he said.
   Long denied obtaining confidential information from the students.
   Wilson said he told his students to reveal who the information
was being gathered for _ but only if those being surveyed asked.
And he said students should have known on their own not to divulge
confidential information.
   One of the businessmen surveyed said business owners let their
guard down when dealing with college students, allowing them to get
information not ordinarily available.
   ``That's not ethical in my mind,'' said Alan Stith at the
Atlanta-based Stith Equipment Co.

<TEXT>
   Hungry families flocked to relief
centers nationwide and food grew scarce in the third day of a
general strike to oust Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega. The military
strongman again rejected a U.S. call for him to go into exile.
   Panamanians by the tens of thousands stayed off their jobs today
and Noriega's opponents hailed the success of the work stoppage,
predicting it would continue until the general leaves the country.
   ``We're in this to the end,'' said Pierre Legnadier, one of the
leaders of a coalition of business, professional, labor and
political groups that called the strike.
   But Noriega appeared unwilling to step down.
   ``I am a Panamanian not a gringo,'' Noriega said Tuesday after
meeting with a small group of union supporters. ``Let the world
know we are fighting the ultimate battle for dignity and against
colonialism.''
   An estimated 90 percent of offices and industries were shut by
the strike on Tuesday. Most shops and stores were closed, public
transportation was halted and many government employees did not go
to work.
   Panamanians today prepared to bury the first person to die in a
wave of protests against the military strongman and opposition
leaders warned of more clashes at the funeral.
   The United States is using economic pressure against Noriega,
withholding payments for use of the Panama Canal and freezing
Panamanian accounts in U.S. banks to starve the government of the
dollars it uses as its currency.
   The government must meet several major payrolls by the end of
the month, including that of the 15,000-strong Defense Forces,
which Noriega heads.
   Between the cash crunch and the strike, the latest in a series
of walkouts that began last summer to protest Noriega's alleged
corruption, food has grown scarce.
   Eric Arturo Delvalle, who was removed as president Feb. 26 after
trying to fire Noriega, appealed for international food aid Tuesday.
   ``I am very concerned and fear for the health and lives of many
Panamanians,'' Delvalle said in a videotaped message from hiding.
The United States still recognizes him as Panama's president.
   Relief officials said that more and more hungry families, some
of whom have not eaten in five or six days, were flocking to
emergency centers around the country. And port workers said they
had run out of food for their union members, but voted to stay on
strike.
   Opposition leaders scheduled a funeral today for a man who died
after being hit with a shotgun blast in violent anti-Noriega
protests last week. It was the first fatality of the monthlong
crisis that began after U.S. grand juries in Florida indicted
Noriega on charges of trafficking in Colombian cocaine.
   Opposition leaders say the funeral and the arrival of an exiled
oppositon leader could provoke confrontations with Noreiga's
forces. The head of the opposition Christian Democractic Party,
Ricardo Arias Calderon was scheduled to arrive from Miami on
Thursday with a group of Central American legislators.
   Noriega's government refused to let Arias Calderon come home
from a trip after the crisis began.
   In Washington, President Reagan said Tuesday that ``we feel
Noriega should leave Panama.''
   Last week, Noriega turned down a U.S. plan for him to leave
Panama and live in Spain. Reagan adminstration officials said they
had offered to fly the general, family members and friends into
exile.
   On Monday, the general said he would resign before next year's
presidential elections if the opposition would agree to a vaguely
defined national dialogue. The opposition scoffed at the offer and
vowed to keep up the strike.
   ``The strength of the strike is increasing,'' Jose Mulino, an
attorney and leader of National Civic Crusade, the opposition
coalition, said Tuesday.
   State Department spokesman Charles Redman said the opposition
rejection of Noreiga's offer was a clear message the strongman
should resign.
   ``The message from Panama is clear,'' he said. ``For the good of
Panama, Noriega should leave.''

   A sit-in at the University of
California's Boalt Hall law school to protest the lack of women and
minority tenured faculty members ended in the arrest of 28 law
students.
   The students occupied Dean Jesse Choper's office for most of the
day Tuesday and called for an open faculty meeting to discuss the
issue, but the dean told them he had no authority to call a
meeting, Boalt spokeswoman Greta Goldenman said.
   The 28 students were cited and released Tuesday evening after
being taken into custody by campus police for investigation of
trespassing.
   White males occupy 91 percent of Boalt's 43.5 tenured faculty
positions, a percentage exceeded only by the University of Chicago
among the nation's top 10 law schools, said the Coalition for a
Diversified Faculty, which organized the protest.
   Associate Dean Jan Vetter said Boalt has one black and two women
in tenured faculty positions, a woman in a half-time tenured law
Ph.D. program, and several other women and minorities in
non-tenured acting professor posts.
   Choper said the law school has been making its best effort to
find women and minority candidates for tenure but competition for
the ``small pool'' is fierce.
   Students also organized a class boycott, but there were
conflicting reports on how successful it was. Protest group members
said they would continue to press for a meeting with faculty.

<TEXT>
   A man who suffers from Parkinson's disease
can keep $209.56 the Social Security Administration said it
overpaid him, ruled a magistrate who noted the government spent
more pursuing the case than it could have won.
   ``It is ludicrous that the (government) has caused thousands of
dollars of government attorney and court time to be expended during
the time of a federal deficit crisis over a sum that is (minimal)
to all but the plaintiff,'' wrote U.S. Magistrate Floyd Boline.
   Gary Bohnsack, 44, of Minneapolis, was notified in April 1986
that he had been overpaid Supplemental Security Income benefits
because he had received interest on a $950 burial account, his only
asset. Twice yearly the account earns $40 interest.
   ``It was like I was penalized for being poor,'' Bohnsack,
disabled since age 10, said Tuesday.
   ``The case got stuck in a bureaucratic maze,'' said Sara
Morrissey, a lawyer who worked on Bohnsack's case for the Legal Aid
Society. ``All (Bohnsack) wanted to do is leave enough money to
bury him.''
   Eventually the government decided to drop the case, but then
Bohnsack wanted a ruling on whether he could accumulate the
interest in the burial account, and the case continued.
   Boline's ruling Monday dealt with a narrow interpretation of a
section of the act governing supplemental income payments. Health
and Human Services Secretary Otis Bowen had taken the position that
the interest on a burial account, even if it accumulated rather
than being paid to the individual, was considered income when the
recipient had no other resources.
   In his ruling, Boline said it was clear Congress intended burial
funds and interest accrued on the accounts to be excluded from
consideration as a resource. The regulation since has been changed
to conform with that position.
   Lawyers for the Health and Human Services Department said they
could not comment on the ruling or why the case was pursued.

<TEXT>
   A 75-year-old woman says she thought there was
a burglar in her home when she shot and killed her granddaughter's
boyfriend.
   ``This was a tragedy, and it will be with me the rest of my
life,'' said Ella Willis. ``If I could blow the breath of life back
in him like God, I'd do it.''
   Assistant St. Louis Circuit Attorney Dan Lesseg said Willis
would not be charged in the shooting Monday night.
   Juan T. Gaston, 25, of St. Louis, was fatally shot on the
second-story porch of Willis' midtown home, said Sgt. Gerald Brown
of the police homicide division.
   Gaston was the boyfriend of Willis' 22-year-old granddaughter,
who lives with Willis, Brown said.
   He said Willis had heard a noise at the back of her home late
Monday and went upstairs to investigate. When Gaston kicked open
the door into the house from the porch, Willis shot him with her
.38-caliber revolver, Brown said.
   ``He lunged at me, and I shot him right between the eyes,''
Willis said. ``I just let him have it.''
   Willis' granddaughter, Monica Hendrix, said that she and Gaston
had argued earlier in the day over a small amount of money. She
said she did not have any bitter feelings toward her grandmother.
   ``She couldn't help it,'' Hendrix said. ``When we heard somebody
breaking in, I thought it might be Juan, and I called and called
and asked who it was.
   ``There was no answer. If he had answered, he wouldn't be dead
right now.''
   Brown said Gaston apparently had come up the back stairs to the
house, then climbed over a wall and dropped into the enclosed porch.
   Brown said Willis told police that Gaston usually came to the
front door when he visited and that she did not know why he had
tried to enter the house through the back without identifying
himself.

   Jimmy Swaggart Ministries won't say
whether a ``life or death'' telethon raised enough to keep the
television ministry afloat.
   ``They never have released (information about telethons) in the

for the ministry.
   The telethon tape featured Swaggart's wife, their son, and
Family Worship Center co-pastor Jim Rentz. They said that without
viewers' help, the daily and Sunday television shows and programs
including famine relief and Bible schools in other countries would
be canceled.
   The television campaign, which ended Sunday, was joined by
direct mail pleas postmarked within a week of Swaggart's confession
to moral failure, and by requests in the ministry's publication,
The Evangelist.
   The magazine said the ministry's expenses average $13 million a
month, and the ministry faces a $14.7 million deficit through
February.

<HEAD>Court Dismisses Medicaid Dispute Between Administration and
California</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today dismissed a Medicaid
dispute between the Reagan administration and California that the
justices had been studying for over a year.
   The court said recent action by Congress has made the case
legally irrelevant.
   Federal authorities had sought to limit state power to ease
eligibilty for Medicaid, a combined federal and state program of
medical assistance to the needy.
   The California Legislature decided in 1983 that aged and
disabled Medicaid recipients were unable to afford necessary
medical care as well as other necessities under the program's
existing income standards.
   So the legislature increased from $544 to $709 the income adult
couples may keep each month for non-medical needs and still qualify
for Medicaid.
   Federal authorities had said the amount was illegally high.
   In an unsigned opinion today, the high court noted that a law
recently enacted by Congress ``required the secretary (of Health
and Human Services) to approve the proposed California amendment,
retroactively to the date of its proposal.''
   The court also noted that lawyers for California and the
administration ``agree that these developments have rendered the
controversy moot.''
   The case is Bowen vs. Kizer, 86-863.

   Democrats living overseas picked a largely
uncommitted delegation to attend the party's national covention
this summer, although Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, the
winner of a non-binding poll, picked up a fraction of a convention
vote.
   In balloting on Tuesday, the Democrats abroad elected 10
delegates, each of whom will cast one-half vote at the national
convention. Nine of those delegates have declared themselves
uncommitted, while one is pledged to Dukakis.
   Another four delegates, each of whom will cast one-half vote,
will be picked later at a meeting in Paris, and under party rules
they initially would be uncommitted.
   ``Of course we have an impact, particularly if we're
uncommitted,'' Sally McNulty, chairwoman of the Democratic Party
Committee Abroad, said Tuesday as organizers around her began
readying stacks of air mail envelopes for counting. ``We could tip
the ballot.''
   Of the 2,385 expatriate Americans voting in the non-binding part
of the ballot, cast mostly by mail, Dukakis got 990 votes, or 41.5
percent and Jackson 347 votes or 14.5 percent, according to
Democrats abroad, the official organizers of the poll.
   In third place was Andrew Sundberg, a businessman living in
Geneva, Switzerland, who campaigns for expatriate benefits. He got
304 votes, or 12.7 percent.
   Sen. Paul Simon of Illinois was fourth with 248 votes, or 10.4
percent, and New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, who is not a candidate,
finished fifth with 171 votes, or 7.2 percent.
   It was the fourth primary for expatriate Democrats, who select
seven national convention delegates. Two other delegates are party
officials.
   The primary gives Democrats worldwide the chance to vote by mail
or in person for convention delegates.
   A slow trickle of voters turned out through the morning Tuesday
at the Queen Elizabeth II Conference Center, around the corner from
the Houses of Parliament. But party officials were not concerned.
   ``Our members would have voted already by post,'' said Ms.
McNulty, who estimated that 2 million to 3 million Americans live
abroad.
   Any Democrat abroad was eligible to mail a ballot to the
primary. Officials believed the majority would come from the 18
countries with Democrats Abroad organizations and large American
populations, including Israel, France and Canada.
   For the first time, ballots were available at embassies and
consulates worldwide.
   Republicans abroad have a similar organization but they do not
hold primaries.

<TEXT>
   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev today called
for a transformation of the country's inefficient agricultural
system led by farms owned by farmers, not by the state.
   Gorbachev, in an address to a national congress of collective
farmers at the Kremlin, said the possibilities of cooperatives were
a ``brilliant discovery'' of Soviet founder Vladimir I. Lenin that
have been underused by subsequent Soviet leaders.
   ``We should revive co-ops not in their old, often too primitive
forms, but in the form of a modern, high-standard cooperative
movement,'' Gorbachev said.
   Collective farms, where members jointly own farm buildings and
machinery and share in earnings, have faded in importance in recent
years in favor of state farms, where farmers, like employees in a
factory, receive a basic wage.
   There were 33,000 collective farms in the Soviet Union in 1970,
but their number dropped to 26,300 by 1986. In that same period,
the number of collective farmers dropped from 16.7 million to 12.6
million.
   Gorbachev has been striving to persuade Soviets to enter into
cooperative ventures to make up for shortages in the state-run
economy. Since reforms instituted last year, nearly 14,000
cooperatives have sprung up to offer restaurant services, pump gas,
make clothes and provide other goods and services in short supply.
   A draft of a new law on cooperatives published earlier this
month in the Soviet press specifically prohibits government
interference in their affairs but also forsees a progressive tax
system to catch what Gorbachev has called ``money-grabbing.''
   Gorbachev, in remarks at the farmers congress summarized by
Tass, said the new law aims to ``ensure the enhancement and
development of cooperative and collective-farm property (and)
create legal machinery to protect cooperative democracy.''
   The summary of Gorbachev's speech distributed by the official
Soviet news agency did not give any indication whether Gorbachev
would move give land to individual farmers.
   Tass said the cooperative law would be a main item of discussion
at the three-day session of collective farmers. It is the first
such conference since 1969.
   According to Tass, Gorbachev said it was the cooperative
movement that ``helped in many ways to overcome hunger and economic
dislocation in the aftermath of the civil war, mend the financial
and monetary systems, and get people more closely involved with the
building of a new life.''
   Gorbachev said his re-emphasis on cooperatives is a result of
greater democracy in Soviet society and ``an important lever for
furthering the democratic process and combatting administration by
fiat and red tape.''
   Soviet agriculture has been plagued by central planners who tell
farms what and how much to plant, lack of incentives for farmers to
work the state-owned land, inefficient production, and poor storage
and transportation facilities.

   The 3,100 U.S. troops dispatched to Honduras
as a warning to neighboring Nicaragua are expected to return home
next Monday and Tuesday, Pentagon officials said today.
   The officials, who insisted on anonymity, described the
withdrawal schedule as still tentative and subject to last-minute
changes, depending upon developments in the region.
   ``But we said about 10 days for exercises and that's what it
should be,'' another source said.
   The officials noted the soldiers had been airlifted to Honduras
over the course of two days last week and said that same procedure
would be followed for the withdrawal.
   Four battalions _ two from the 82nd Airborne Division at Fort
Bragg, N.C., and two from the 7th Light Infantry Division at Fort
Ord, Calif. _ were airlifted to Honduras on March 17 and 18 after
Nicaraguan soldiers crossed the Honduran border in pursuit of
U.S.-backed Contra guerrillas.
   The Reagan administration insisted from the beginning that the
U.S. soldiers would be kept away from the scene of the fighting,
but said the deployment was necessary to demonstrate America's
commitment to Honduras and democracy in the region.

   Police announced today they
were abandoning a policy of staying away from IRA funerals because
five people, including two British soldiers, were killed during
funerals last week.
   Protestant activists had demanded that police reinstitute the
policy of clamping tight security on IRA funerals.
   Describing the IRA threat as ``deadly,'' a police statement
indicated security chiefs will order heavy police and troop
presence at future IRA funerals.
   ``Experience has shown that maintenance of the law and
prevention of outrages will only be guaranteed through the firm
presence of the police and army,'' a statement from the Royal
Ulster Constabulary headquarters said.
   The statement marked the swift collapse of a policy introduced
under pressure from moderate Roman Catholic leaders in the hope of
avoiding clashes.
   At the first unpoliced IRA funeral March 16, a Protestant
guerrilla launched a firearms and grenade attack from behind a
tombstone in the Catholic Milltown cemetery, killing three people
and wounded 68.
   At the IRA funeral Saturday for one Milltown victim, two British
soldiers drove up to the funeral cortege in an unmarked car were
brutally slain.
   In Britain, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher joined grieving
relatives at Northolt air base north of London where the bodies of
the soldiers, identified as signals corpsmen, were brought home.
   Services for Derek Wood, 24, and David Howes, 23, of the Royal
Corps of Signals, were scheduled for today in Belfast, Ballynahinch
and Lisburn, where they were based.
   Security forces continued to search Catholic areas of west
Belfast for their killers. Police sources said investigators were
looking for as many as 30 suspects.
   At Northolt, Mrs. Thatcher glanced around anxiously while the
sister of one of the men sobbed as the Royal Corps of Signal band
played Chopin's ``Funeral March'' and a bearer carried the
flag-draped coffins to hearses.
   In Belfast, some 25,000 people, mainly Protestants, gathered
this afternoon at the Cenotaph outside the city hall for a memorial
service to the slain soldiers.
   British and Republic of Ireland government ministers said they
will hold a special meeting in London on Friday to discuss tougher
security because of the latest outburst of violence in Northern
Ireland.
   The meeting was called under an Anglo-Irish agreement which
gives the Catholic republic an advisory say in Britain's running of
the Protestant-dominated province.
   On Tuesday, a Protestant guerrilla said he killed three people
at the IRA burial in Milltown because he wanted to avenge IRA
attacks aimed at Mrs. Thatcher and others, prosecutors said.
   The guerrilla, Michael Stone, 33, was charged with murdering
three people in the attack on the March 16 funeral of three IRA
guerrillas killed by British soldiers in Gibraltar. Stone also was
charged with killing three other Roman Catholics in sniper attacks
dating back to 1984.
   None of earlier victims _ a milkman, a bread delivery man and a
carpenter _ had any known links to the IRA.
   Stone was ordered to remain in custody until April 8, when he is
next due in court. A trial date has not yet been set.
   Flanked by heavy security in Belfast Magistrates Court on
Tuesday, Stone remained silent while a police superintendent read a
statement he had made about the Milltown attack.
   ``I alone carried out this military operation as a retaliatory
strike against Provisional Sinn Fein, the IRA, in response to the
slaughter of innocents at La Mon, Darkley, Brighton and
Enniskillen,'' Stone told police.
   ``I would state I am a dedicated free-lance Loyalist
(Protestant) paramilitary. No surrender.''
   The four attacks Stone cited in his statement span nearly 10
years from 1978 to 1987 and claimed the lives of 35 people. Mrs.
Thatcher escaped injury in the October 1984 Brighton attack.
   In Belfast, a senior bishop whose diocese includes the tense
Catholic ghetto of west Belfast, denounced the IRA as ``sheer
evil.'' It was one of the strongest attacks yet by Catholic
prelates, who regularly condemn the mainly Catholic guerrilla
organization.
   Bishop Cahal Daly said the IRA posed a ``grave spritual danger
to the Catholic community.''
   The mainly Catholic Irish Republican Army wants to end British
rule in Northern Ireland and unite the predominantly Protestant
province with the overwhelmingly Catholic Republic of Ireland under
socialist rule.

   In Washington, Pentagon officials who requested anonymity said
the Defense Department was planning to withdraw the troops on
Monday and Tuesday.
   President Reagan ordered 3,200 American troops to Honduras last
week after Nicaraguan soldiers allegedly penetrated Honduran
territory in pursuit of U.S.-supported Contra rebels.
   On Tuesday, President Jose Azcona Hoyo told The Associated Press
that Sandinista troops had retreated and the American military
contingent ``will leave Honduras very soon.''
   U.S. military spokesman Maj. Gary Hovatter on Tuesday said the
soldiers first will finish their training exercises.
   ``Right now the plans are to make it a 10- to 14-day exercise.
We have not received any directive as to when to begin
redeployment,'' he said, adding the exercises were taking place
Tuesday at four sites.
   In Washington, a Pentagon source stressed the withdrawal
schedule was still ``tentative'' and subject to change, depending
upon future developments in the region.
   ``But we said about 10 days for exercises and that's what it
should be,'' another source said.
   The officials noted the soldiers had been airlifted to Honduras
over the course of two days last week and said that same procedure
would be followed for the withdrawal.
   Foreign Minister Carlos Lopez Contreras on Tuesday said the
border tension ``has virtually disappeared'' after both the
Sandinistas and the Contras suspended hostilities and began truce
talks in southern Nicaragua.
   Some U.S. soldiers expressed frustration on Tuesday that they
had not been allowed to join the fighting along the border.
   ``They get you all hepped up and then there's nothing to do,''
said Pfc. Jose Pena, 23, of Scottsdale, Ariz., who was rushed in
last week as part of what the White House called a ``measured
response'' to the crisis.
   ``Most of us were hoping to get a little action,'' he said at
Palmerola Air Base, headquarters for U.S. military operations.
   One soldier said he came prepared for anything.
   ``They told us it was a training exercise, but if things got hot
and heavy, it was time for our training to kick in,'' said Spec. 4
Duane McCarty, a 25-year-old helicopter mechanic from Novi, Mich.
   The deployment of the U.S. troops bolstered the American
military presence in Honduras to about 6,000 servicemen. The Reagan
administration billed it as both a show of support for Azcona and a
warning to the Sandinistas against further actions in the border
region.
   The United States has been carrying out joint exercises with the
Honduran military periodically for five years as part of the Reagan
administration's policy of isolating the Sandinistas.

   Nobel laureate Elie Wiesel, a Nazi death
camp survivor who lectures on the Holocaust, canceled an appearance
here after learning his fee would come from a grant by a
conservative publisher once accused of being an agent of South
Africa.
   Wiesel had been scheduled as a speaker today at the John McGoff
Distinguished Lecture Series at Northern Michigan University.
   But McGoff's reported links to the South African government and
the university's plans to pay Wiesel's fee from a $300,000 grant
from McGoff brought protests from the school's faculty.
   ``When it comes to apartheid you cannot make compromises,''
Wiesel said in explaining his decision.
   Philosophy professor James Green, who led the protests, said
Wiesel said he would have declined to appear had he known McGoff's
money was being used to pay for his appearance.
   McGoff, former chairman of the Northern Michigan University
board of control, was accused by the Securities and Exchange
Commission of illegally using South African money to try to buy
U.S. newspapers and lobby on behalf of the South African government.
   McGoff has denied acting as an agent for the South African
government and the charges were dismissed.
   McGoff, whose telephone number in Williamston is unlisted, could
not be reached for comment today.
   Green said the university faculty voted to disassociate itself
from the McGoff lecture series. Friday, the faculty voted 82-62
against using $3,000 from faculty funds to finance Wiesel's talk.
   Green said faculty members asked the university for assurances
that none of the McGoff money to be used for Wiesel's lecture came
from South Africa, but the university never provided such an
assurance.
   Jim Carter, news director at the university, said today the
university received word late Tuesday from the Harry Walker Agency
in New York City that Wiesel's appearance had been canceled.
   ``We are making no further statement to that effect,'' Carter
said, declining to answer questions about how the cancellation came
about.
   Wiesel said some faculty members had urged him to use the
lecture as a forum to denounce apartheid, which by law and custom
establishes a racially segregated society in which the 26 million
blacks have no vote in national affairs.
   The 5 million South African whites control the economy and
maintain separate districts, schools and health services.
   ``When it comes to mass humiliation, a compromise is already
playing the other side's game. And what is apartheid but collective
humiliation; furhtermore, it is legal humiliation,'' said Wiesel.
``In South Africa, humiliation is the law of the land.''

   The Senate Foreign Relations Committee today
defeated the first attempt by Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., to change
the U.S.-Soviet treaty banning medium-range nuclear missiles.
   The Democratic-controlled panel voted 12-3 against Helms'
amendment, which would allow non-nuclear U.S. cruise missiles to be
deployed in Europe.
   The pact signed Dec. 8 by President Reagan and Soviet leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev bans missiles of ranges from 300 to 3,400
miles. The prohibition includes cruise missiles, both
nuclear-tipped and those armed with non-nuclear weapons.
   The ban covers both types of missiles because ``there's no way
to verify the distinction between'' the two, said Sen. Alan
Cranston, D-Calif.
   But Helms said the ban means ``the conventional imbalance in
Europe will be even greater than it is now'' because NATO will lose
a major weapon in the cruise missile.
   Cranston responded that the Pentagon has no plans to build
non-nuclear cruise missiles.
   The vote came on the first of 43 pending amendments or
reservations, either to the treaty text or the resolution by which
the Senate would register its approval of the pact.
   Of those amendments, 36 were proposed by Helms, the committee's
ranking Republican and the chief opponent of the treaty. Three more
were offered by Sen. Larry Pressler, R-S.D., who has also been
critical of the pact.
   Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., the chairman of the committee, told
his colleagues that he intends ``to oppose all reservations,
conditions, etc.,'' with the possible exception of amendments
designed to solve a long-running fight between the Reagan
administration and Congress over treaty intepretation.
   Helms said today the committee shouldn't be ``a rubber stamp''
for the administration, which has urged approval of the treaty
without changes.
   Both Democratic and Republican leaders predict overwhelming
ratification when the treaty reaches the Senate floor and say only
10 or 12 senators are likely to vote against it. Ratification
requires a two-thirds vote of the 100-member Senate.
   ``I don't intend to obstruct'' the committee's work on the
treaty, Helms told his colleagues Tuesday, but he added, ``I'm
concerned that we're about to rush to judgment.''
   Given the large number of amendments, Pell said the panel now
``seems very unlikely'' to meet its original goal of finishing work
by Friday.
   Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., told Helms, ``If you don't have the
votes and you simply try to overload it with amendments, that isn't
fair.''
   Most of Helms' amendments are designed to improve what he says
are compliance verification problems and clear up ambiguities.
   The majority of Helms' proposals would amend the ratification
resolution, which would not require new negotiations with the
Soviet Union.
   Any change made by the Senate in the actual text of the treaty
would have to be accepted by the Soviet Union, and administration
officials have urged the Senate to avoid so-called ``killer
amendments'' that would cause the Soviets to reject new talks.
   The treaty requires the elimination of nuclear-armed missiles
with a range of 300 miles to 3,400 miles and includes on-site
inspection provisions among its verification system, which is the
most intrusive in arms control history.
   The Foreign Relations Committee heard endorsements of the pact
Tuesday from two other committees, Intelligence and Armed Services,
which had also looked at the treaty during the past two months.
   But the congressional debate over the treaty has been clouded by
the reopening of a long fight between the Democratic-controlled
Congress and the White House.
   The complicated legal fight involves the question of whether an
administration has the legal right to unilaterally change how the
United States interprets a treaty. Reagan asserts the
administration has such a right, but Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman
of the Armed Services Committee, and other legislators have
disagreed.
   The fight involves the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty, but
it has spilled over into the debate on the Intermediate-range
Nuclear Forces treaty, Nunn told the Foreign Relations Committee.
   Nunn said letters written by White House Counsel Arthur B.
Culvahouse Jr. effectively undercut previous assurances from
Secretary of State George P. Shultz that administration testimony
on the new pact is ``authoritative.''
   Nunn said Culvahouse asserted that some administration responses
may be less authoritative than others.
   Culvahouse suggested that the testimony of a secretary of state
may be more authoritative than that of other administration
witnesses or responses in writing to questions by members of
Congress, Nunn said.
   Culvahouse has since issued a second letter asserting that his
original remarks were not inconsistent with the Shultz statement.
But Nunn said he finds that unacceptable.
   Nunn said the new letter ``puts the Shultz statement in the
trashcan, saying that certain testimony is not to be taken
seriously.''
   The dispute should be resolved by the full Senate instead of
seeking another letter from the administration, even from the
president, said Nunn.
   Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., said the dispute ``is the major
stumbling block and could create grave perils if we don't resolve
it.''

<DATELINE>SIDON, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Six Israeli warplanes today rocketed
Palestinian guerrilla bases on the outskirts of this southern port
city.
   Thick black smoke billowed from the stricken targets southeast
of Sidon, 25 miles south of Beirut, as the fighter-bombers struck
shortly after 4 p.m., Lebanese police said.
   The Israeli military said the targets were buildings used by
guerrillas for storing weapons and equipment. It said the buildings
were also used as garages for the guerrillas' vehicles.
   There were no immediate figures on casualties. Police said
several ambulances raced with sirens wailing from Sidon to pick up
victims.
   The Israeli announcement did not identify which guerrilla group
had been attacked. Israel Radio's Arabic service quoted Beirut
radio stations as saying the targets belonged to Yasser Arafat's
Fatah guerrillas and Lebanese Moslem militias.
   The army said that all the planes returned safely to their bases
and that the pilots reported that the targets were destroyed.
   The army said Israeli planes also destroyed a vehicle equipped
with anti-aircraft guns.
   Police said the planes fired at least 25 rockets in five runs on
guerrilla bases in a cluster of villages near Sidon's Ein el-Hilweh
refugee camp.
   They said the pilots released air balloons to deflect
heat-seeking SAM-7 missiles unleashed by guerrillas.
   The air strike was the second against the Palestinians in a week
and the fourth this year. Thirty-one people were killed and 43
wounded in the three previous Israeli air raids this year.

   Consumer prices, restrained by lower food and
energy costs, rose a modest 0.2 percent in February, the government
said today in a report that shows inflation remains tame.
   Food prices fell 0.3 percent after rising 0.3 percent in
January. Energy costs, which had fallen 0.7 percent in the
preceding month, fell 0.6 percent last month.
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater hailed the report, and
one showing that the nation's gross national product had risen 4.8
percent in the last quarter of 1987, as ``more good news on the
economic front. ... The economy is doing well. The Reagan miracle
holds.''
   So far this year, consumer prices have been increasing at a rate
of 3.2 percent. That compares to the moderate 4.4 percent rate for
all of 1987 and the scant 1.1 percent 1986 increase.
   Some economists suggested that last month's moderate food and
energy cost hikes may be masking hefty increases for other goods
and services.
   Subtracting these two volatile categories, however, the index
for all other goods and services also advanced 0.2 percent in
February after a 0.5 percent increase in January, when prices
overall rose 0.3 percent.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   A restrained Consumer Price Index had been expected since the
Labor Department reported that the companion Producer Price Index,
also restrained by moderating energy and food prices, had dipped
0.2 percent in February.
   The department gave these other specifics on February retail
price activity:
   _Grocery store prices fell 0.6 percent after a 0.2 percent rise
in the previous month; restaurant meals were up 0.3 percent, the
same as in January.
   Pacing the drop in food prices was a 4.0 percent fall in the
costs of fruits and vegetables, more than offsetting 0.4 percent
rise for meats, poultry and fish.
   _Gasoline prices fell 1.7 percent, down for the third month in a
row. Gasoline prices had fallen 1.7 percent in December and 1.6
percent in January.
   _Heating oil prices were up 0.6 percent while the cost of
natural gas and electricity rose 0.5 percent.
   _New automobile prices rose 0.3 percent.
   _Clothing prices fell 0.3 percent.
   _Alchoholic beverage prices rose 0.9 percent.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Last month's 0.2 percent gain was equivalent to an annual
inflation rate of 2.1 percent.
   The February increase left the overall index at 116.0, meaning
that a hypothetical selection of goods costing $100 during a
1982-84 base period would have cost $116.00 last month.
   Unlike other figures in the report, the overall index is not
adjusted for seasonal fluctuations.
   The Labor Department recently changed its base period. Had the
former computation been used, the February consumer price index
would have been 347.4 compared to a 1967 base of 100.
   That means that the same selection of goods would have cost
$13.00 more last month than in February 1987, when the CPI was
334.4.

   Unexpectedly brisk economic activity is raising some economists'
concerns that inflation may pick up in the months ahead,
particularly as import prices rise further under pressure from a
dollar that is now 50 percent weaker against key foreign currencies
than it was three years ago.
   A weaker dollar makes imports more expensive. Higher prices,
particularly for Japanese and European products, have been noticed
on store shelves in recent months as a result of these
exchange-rate movements.
   This is good for the U.S. trade deficit, because as imports get
more expensive U.S. goods become cheaper and more competitive
overseas. But analysts have long warned that any sustained increase
in import prices could fuel overall higher inflation.
   Adding to worries about inflation was the February unemployment
report, showing that the jobless rate fell to 5.7 percent, the best
performance since l979.
   As unemployment declines below a certain level, pressure builds
for higher wages to fill vacant jobs. Economists disagree on the
exact level.
   Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan told Congress last
week that he felt that inflation could be rekindled if unemployment
fell another 0.5 percentage points.
   ``I don't think inflation will be a problem probably for the
whole year, but the bond markets are worried,'' said Michael K.
Evans, president of a private economic consulting service.

   The Reagan administration and House Speaker
Jim Wright said today reports of progress at cease-fire talks in
Nicaragua are encouraging, and Democratic leaders said agreement
there likely would trigger a new package of strictly
``humanitarian'' aid for the Contra rebels.
   ``We want to be cautious but we are encouraged (by the talks),''
said White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater. ``They do seem to be
making progress,'' he said, adding that was ``somewhat surprising''
in view of previous actions by the Sandinistas.
   ``We hope these talks succeed,'' Fitzwater said.
   ``It is my earnest hope that we can obtain a bipartisan
agreement on humanitarian aid so that the bill can be scheduled
quickly,'' Wright, D-Texas, told reporters. ``That is the best way
to encourage the peacemakers in Central America.''
   House Majority Whip Tony Coelho, D-Calif., said such a bill
could be approved next week if the cease-fire talks, in their third
day in Sapoa, Nicaragua, bear fruit, and if aid would be consistent
with whatever agreement is reached by the Contras and the Managua
government.
   Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., said it was time
that there be ``a ceasefire between the Congress and the White
House'' on the issue, but said he had no plans to bring an aid bill
before the Senate.
   Wright indicated that an aid proposal being advanced by Rep.
Buddy MacKay, D-Fla., one of the ``swing'' votes on the Contra
issue, would likely be acceptable to House leaders.
   MacKay said he and other centrist House members who have
traditionally determined the outcome on the polarized issue of aid
to the rebels were left skittish by last week's incursion of
Nicaraguan troops into neighboring Honduras in an effort to attack
Contra supply camps.
   ``It had an impact on all of us,'' MacKay said in an interview
Tuesday. The Sandinista military action on the eve of renewed
cease-fire talks with the Contras was a reminder that ``relying on
their good faith is just not realistic,'' MacKay added.
   ``All we are trying to say is that leaving the situation as it
is is unacceptable,'' he said.
   The compromise bill, still being drafted Tuesday, was similar to
a package put together last week by Senate backers of the rebels.
It contained a one-year, $48 million infusion of ``humanitarian''
aid, to include food, clothing, shelter and medicine. It also would
authorize the Central Intelligence Agency to deliver existing
supplies of weapons.
   But in contrast to the Senate version, MacKay's would permit
President Reagan to call for an expedited vote on new aid for the
rebels if peace talks break down, but not to dictate the terms of
the aid package. It would be up to Congress to decide what kind of
aid to send, he said.
   MacKay said he expected to formally introduce the package this
week and hoped to have about half a dozen other moderates join him.
   He said the effort is not intended to be a challenge to House
Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas. Republicans have accused Wright of
using his scheduling powers to bottle up any aid bill that goes
beyond a strictly humanitarian package Democrats offered earlier
this month, but which was defeated.
   President Reagan on Tuesday appealed to House Republicans in a
closed-door meeting to unite behind a new aid bill, but did not
specify which provisions he would support.
   ``We are determined to get continued assistance to the
resistance, and if we stick together, this time we'll make it,''
Reagan told the lawmakers, according to a White House transcript.
He also said Democrats would be to blame if the Contras ``are
extinguished'' by the leftist Nicaraguan government.
   Democrats insisted the Republicans were responsible for the
narrow House defeat of a package of strictly ``humanitarian'' aid
on March 3.
   ``What we're seeing is a public relations campaign here,'' said
Rep. Tony Coelho, D-Calif. ``The Republicans are very nervous about
it because the finger's pointed right at them.''
   A poll published in today's editions of The Washington Post
found that 40 percent of the people surveyed support aid to the
Contras, while 56 percent oppose it. The support figure in the
Washington Post-ABC News poll is the highest since 43 percent on
July 15, 1987, a day after Lt. Col. Oliver North, the indicted
former White House aide, testified before a congressional committee.
   The survey, completed Monday, also found 55 percent to 43
percent disapproval of Reagan's decision to send the troops to
Honduras. Pollsters interviewed 1,007 randomly chosen adults in the
continental United States by telephone. The poll had a margin of
error of 4 points.
   The rebels released a television advertisement to begin airing
this week that makes a direct appeal to U.S. viewers for
contributions.
   ``Your Congress abandoned us,'' Ernesto Palazio, a Washington
lobbyist for the rebels, says somberly in the spot. ``We have
nowhere to turn but to individual Americans like you.''
   The spot, which asks for money for ``medicine, blankets and food
for our families and children,'' was to begin running this week in
Washington, Charlotte, N.C., and Wright's home town of Fort Worth,
Texas.

<TEXT>
   The chief of security for a Medellin
newspaper that has fought drug trafficking was shot and killed
today and his young daughter was wounded, police said.
   El Colombiano security chief, Jorge Alberto Stefan Gomez, was
leaving his house with his wife and child when several gunmen in
parked cars opened fire with pistols and submachine guns.
   Investigators said Stefan's wife was not injured and that they
did not know who was behind the attack.
   On Tuesday, troops trying to arrest an alleged drug kingpin
tripped a sophisticated alarm system at a country estate and the
man got away.
   The army said Pablo Escobar Gaviria escaped after a shootout in
which one man, thought to be one of Escobar's bodyguards, was
injured.
   Escobar, wanted in the United States on drug charges, is an
alleged leader of the notorious Medellin drug cartel and reportedly
a billionaire.
   The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration says the cartel is
responsible for 80 percent of the cocaine that reaches the United
States.
   At least 25 of Escobar's heaviy armed bodyguards were arrested
after the clash and 13 vehicles, various firearms, ammunition,
communications equipment and documents seized, the army said in a
communique.
   Escobar's wife, Maria Victoria, and her sister were arrested
elsewhere in Medellin carrying ``several documents of interest,''
the army said.
   Escobar was indicted in 1986 on federal drug charges in the
United States. Last month, another U.S. drug indictment named him
along with Panamanian strongman Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega and 14
others.
   Colombia's Justice Ministry in January ordered the arrest of
Escobar and others named as cartel leaders for extradition to the
United States.
   Since then no cartel leader has been arrested.
   The newspaper El Colombiano has urged the Colombian government
to pursue its war on drug traffickers. Medellin, the cocaine
capital of Colombia, is where many drug traffickers live. It is
also the site of cocaine processing plants.
   On March 10 two bombs were thrown from a speeding car at the
newspaper's offices. A guard threw the bombs into the street and a
passer-by was killed.
   Last November gunmen shot up the home of El Colombiano's
publisher, Juan Gomez Martinez. The gunmen apparently were trying
to kidnap Gomez to get the government to suspend extraditions of
Colombians to the United States.
   Drug traffickers have killed a justice minister, an attorney
general, 21 judges, two newspaper editors and scores of policemen
and soldiers in the last four years.

   President Reagan will travel to Richmond, Va.,

attend a Republican Party fund-raiser, the White House said today.
   Chief spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Reagan will fly to
Richmond for the series of events, inlcuding a speech to the
Reynolds employees.
   Fitzwater said Reynolds is a good example of a company that has
had ``success as an exporter'' and Reagan would emphasize in his
talk the emergence of an international economy and the U.S. role in
it.
   Aside from his appearance at the Reynolds headquarters, Reagan
also will attend a reception for major donors to the Virginia
Republican Party at the Hyatt Richmond Hotel nearby.
   Reagan will be in the city about 2{ hours before returning to
the White House.

   An avalanche that plunged
down on a helicopter skiing expedition left one skier dead, but an
expedition guide was rescued after being buried under snow for
nearly 90 minutes, authorities said.
   Pandora Chapman, 26, of Davis, Calif., died in avalanches on
Sale Mountain near this southeastern British Columbia community
Tuesday, said coroner Sam Olynyk.
   It was the second fatality this year involving Selkirk Tangiers
Heli-Skiing, based in Golden, British Columbia.
   Guide Erik Suchovs of Revelstoke skied ahead of his party and
was buried by an avalanche.
   ``The three skiers skied down to locate him and another
avalanche came down behind them,'' Olynyk said. Chapman was buried,
and the other two skiers were partly buried.
   Suchovs was uncovered by searchers using emergency radio
locators. According to Queen Victoria Hospital administrator Jim
Vaillancourt, Suchovs was in good shape and was treated and
released.
   The two surviving skiers, a California man and a woman from

<TEXT>
   Alma Archer Fox, a well-known authority
on fashion, style and taste during her career as a syndicated
columnist with the New York Mirror, has died. She was 89.
   The Galesburg native, who died Tuesday, was a 1919 graduate of
Knox College in Galesburg and landed her first fashion job in Los
Angeles where she designed custom-made Cadillacs.
   Ms. Fox moved to New York in 1924 where she ran a charm school
on Fifth Avenue and became a columnist. Highlights of her career
included interviewing Adolf Hitler, drinking with Ernest Hemingway
in Paris and sailing south of France with James Joyce.
   In 1937, at the height of her popularity, Ms. Fox was featured
in a full-page ad in The Saturday Evening Post promoting Chrysler
automobiles and proclaiming her ``one of the world's great
authorities on style and smartness.''
   She was editor of the women's section of the New York Mirror and
her column on fashion and style was syndicated by the United Press
Association to more than 1,100 newspapers.
   Ms. Fox was married to Broadway composer Harry Archer and later
to T. Edward Fox. She returned to Galesburg in 1959 following her
second husband's death and wrote a weekly column for the Galesburg
post until her retirement in 1983.
   Ms. Fox, who died of pneumonia in a nursing home, is survived by
two nephews.

   A man whose ex-wife went to jail rather than
let him see their children surrendered to authorities today after
being indicted on a charge of sexually assaulting his daughter.
   Mark Russell Murabito, 33, of Derry, was awaiting arraignment in
Rockingham County Superior Court after turning himself in to the
county sheriff.
   A grand jury indicted Murabito on a charge of felonious sexual
assault against his daughter, now 5 years old, County Attorney
Carleton Eldredge said Tuesday.
   Eldredge said the indictment was ``based upon a course of
conduct'' since March 1987, when a Superior Court judge found no
evidence to back Jesse Murabito's allegations that her husband
molested their daughter.
   Eldredge did not elaborate on the indictment. As a condition of
bail, Eldredge said he will ask that Murabito be barred from seeing
his children.
   In his 19-page divorce decree last March, Judge Douglas Gray
admonished both parents to stop ``tearing (the children) to
pieces,'' and granted Murabito unsupervised visitation with the
girl and her brother, now 3{.
   Murabito's lawyer, Raymond Kellett, said Tuesday his client will
plead innocent to any such charges. ``It is evident that (Mrs.
Murabito) will do anything and everything to keep the children from
Mr. Murabito,'' Kellett said.
   Mrs. Murabito said Tuesday the case ``is not Murabito versus
Murabito. This is the state of New Hampshire versus Mr. Murabito.''
She declined further comment.
   The indictment is a turning point in Mrs. Murabito's nearly
two-year struggle to convince the courts and child welfare
officials that her ex-husband was molesting their daughter.
   Gray could not be reached for comment Tuesday evening; there was
no home telephone listing in New Hampshire under his name.
   In February 1987, Gray jailed Mrs. Murabito, now 39, after she
hid the children in defiance of a court order to let her husband
see the children during supervised visits.
   A week later, he released her after she agreed to allow
supervised visits pending a hearing.
   In the subsequent order of March 20, 1987, in which Murabito was
granted unsupervised visits, Gray said Mrs. Murabito and experts
she called as witnesses during a seven-day hearing had failed to
prove allegations that Murabito sexually abused the daughter after
Mrs. Murabito sought a divorce in late 1985.
   ``Of course the possibility exists that the court is wrong, but
that possibility exists in any judicial fact-finding process,''
Gray wrote, but to uphold the abuse allegations ``would be to
engage in blatant speculation.''
   Gray said Mrs. Murabito's chief witness, the children's
psychiatrist since spring 1986, based many of her assertions on
hearsay. Mrs. Murabito had said she contacted the psychiatrist when
she noticed the children were losing sleep and weight and becoming
irritable.
   Gray cited an evaluation of the children by a court-appointed
psychologist as ``by far the more clinically neutral and detached.''
   The psychologist found no evidence of sexual abuse and said
actions by the father that had been construed by others as abuse
could be interpreted otherwise.

   The Reagan administration today condemned the
reported use of chemical weapons by Iraq that Iran says killed or
wounded 5,000 people in Kurdish border cities last week.
   ``We condemn the use of chemical warfare and the gas use by
anybody, anywhere, anytime,'' said White House spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater.
   Referring to television broadcasts, Fitzwater said, ``I saw _
everyone in the administration saw _ the same reports you saw last
night. They were horrible, outrageous, disgusting and should serve
as a reminder to all countries of why chemical warfare should be
banned.''
   Asked if the United States would convey its reaction to Baghdad,
he said, ``our views are known ... to all governments.''
   Meanwhile, the International Committee of the Red Cross also
condemned the use of chemical weapons in the 7{-year-old Iran-Iraq
war, calling it a ``new and tragic escalation'' of the conflict,
and said it had taken urgent steps to end such attacks.

<TEXT>
   The Soviet government today ignored Armenian
demands for annexation of a predominantly Armenian section of a
neighboring republic and called for efforts to improve social and
economic conditions in the area.
   A session of the Presidium of the national Supreme Soviet,
called after carefully orchestrated appeals by 13 Soviet republics,
made no reference to the Armenian demands.
   The resolution today appeared to be a definitive response from
the Kremlin leadership to the demands regarding the
Nagorno-Karabakh region of the republic of Azerbaijan.
   Armenian activists want the region united with Armenia.
   The Presidium ordered the Soviet Council of Ministers to ``work
out all measures directed at deciding the immediate economic and
social-cultural development of the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous
Region.''
   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev and other top leaders
participated in the meeting. It called on officials of Armenian and
Azerbaijan to bring to ``strict accountability those who with their
actions destabilized the situation.''
   That statement appeared to indicate authorities would take
action not only against those who have been arrested for violence
in ethnic rioting that killed at least 32 people, but also Armenian
activists.
   Earlier, a Moscow dissident said Soviet authorities had sent
back to Armenia an activist who had been giving foreign journalists
information about the ethnic unrest between Aremanians and
Azerbaijanis.
   Alexander Ogorodnikov, a former political prisoner, said
Armenian nationalist Paryur Arikyan was put on a plane for Yerevan,
the Armenian capital, at 1:30 a.m.
   He said calls to Armenian activists in Yerevan today indicated
that Arikyan had arrived from Moscow.
   Another dissident source, Tamara Grigoryants, told The
Associated Press on Tuesday that police arrested Arikyan in central
Moscow after he met with a Western television journalist.
   Thousands of Armenians protested last month for approval to
annex Nagorno-Karabakh.
   On Feb. 28 rioting broke out in Sumgait, a city of Azerbaijan,
in which officials say 32 people were killed.
   Armenian activists say at least 78 Armenians were killed by
Azerbaijanis in Sumgait.
   Arikyan, who said he spent 17 years in jail for Armenian
nationalist activities, arrived in Moscow from Yerevan last week
and held news conferences for foreign journalists at Ogorodnikov's
apartment.
   He said Saturday that officials had confiscated his internal
passport, so he had traveled to Moscow via Soviet Georgia and the
Russian city of Tula to escape detection.
   The Tass news agency, meanwhile, announced the governments of 13
Soviet republics had addressed the violence in the republics of
Armenia and Azerbaijan.
   Tass said the Supreme Soviets of Kazakhstan, Lithuania,
Moldavia, Latvia, Kirghizia, Tadzhikistan, Turkmenia and Estonia
passed resolutions calling for ``discretion and composure, and at
the same time for issuing a decisive rebuff to any illegitimate
actions.''
   That followed a Tass report Tuesday that the Russian federation,
and the republics of Ukraine, Byelorussia, Georgia and Uzbekistan
had passed similar resolutions and urged the national Supreme
Soviet to take action.
   Such concerted action by those 13 republics, equal under the
Soviet constitution to Armenia and Azerbaijan, was very unusual and
almost certainly orchestrated by Communist Party authorities.
   The government calls for action also came as the Communist Party
newspaper Pravda and the government newspaper, Izvestia, ran
articles sharply criticizing Armenian activists.
   Pravda's article Monday charging that the annexation campaign
had a ``clear anti-socialist spirit'' sparked a protest in Yerevan.
The Pravda journalist whose name was one of three attached to the
article disassociated himself from it in a telegram to the paper's
editor.

<TEXT>
   A fugitive wanted in the poisoning death of
a Las Vegas beauty contest winner was arrested here, authorities
said today.
   Murray Police Sgt. Bill Brusik said Steven Paul Mack was taken
into custody about 10 p.m. Tuesday after police stopped him in his
car about half a mile from his home in this Salt Lake City suburb.
   Mack, a convicted forger and burglar who served two prison terms
and was paroled in 1985, was being held without bail today in Salt
Lake County Jail on a felony homicide warrant issued in Sacramento,
Calif.
   Brusik said Sacramento detectives were expected to arrive today
to question Mack and begin extradition proceedings.
   Mack, 39, is sought for questioning in the February 1987 slaying
of Karen Grace Winslett, 21, of Carmichael, Calif. Winslett won the
title of Miss English Leather in Las Vegas, Nev., shortly before
disappearing Feb. 19.
   Her decomposed body was found 12 days later hidden under the
rear hatchback door of her sports car, parked behind a Sacramento
motel.
   Sacramento detectives said she died of a large dose of Percodan,
a pain killer for which Winslett had no prescription. She had no
health problems, was not suicidal and had no background of drug
abuse, authorities said.
   Detectives concluded she had been poisoned, and said Mack was
linked to the crime by physical and other evidence they would not
detail.
   Sacramento police also said Mack is a suspect in a similar
slaying of a 19-year-old Annette Huddle in Marion County, Ohio.
   Brusik said police discovered Mack's identity during an
unrelated forgery investigation involving Sean Paul Lanier, the
name Mack purportedly used for the four or five months he had been
living in Murray.

<TEXT>
   The Senate refused today to limit debate on a
bill that would require the government to individually warn
thousands of workers each year that they face a high risk of cancer
and other diseases from exposure to dangerous chemicals and other
substances in their jobs.
   In a key test vote, Democratic supporters of the House-passed
legislation could muster only 33 of the 60 Senate votes necessary
to limit debate on the measure to 30 hours before an up-or-down
vote on its passage.
   Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, the primary Senate author of the
legislation, offered today to accept amendments expanding
exemptions for small businesses and farms in an effort to pick up
more support in anticipation of another vote scheduled Friday on
cutting off debate.
   The bill's proponents had filed motions to limit the debate as
soon the measure was brought to the Senate floor on Tuesday after
Republican and business opponents made it clear they would try to
prevent a vote on the bill itself through the use of a filibuster.
   Ending a filibuster requires 60 votes while final passage of a
bill requires only a simple majority, or 51 votes if all 100
senators are present.
   Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, the leader of the opponents, said
Metzenbaum's willingness ``to whittle the bill down until he gets
engouh votes to pass it'' demonstrates the problems with the
legislation.
   ``If it's good enough for one, it's good enough for all,'' Hatch
said. ``The overwhelming majority of the business community opposes
this bill.'' Business groups that support it, Hatch said, ``have
worked out exemptions for themselves to the exclusion of everybody
else.''
   Among the business supporters of the bill are the Chemical
Manufacturers Association, the American Electronics Association and
dozens of the nation's largest companies, including General
Electric, IBM and Atlantic Richfield. Most already have their own
worker notification programs.
   Opponents include the Reagan administration, the National
Association of Manufacturers and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
   The bill would establish an agency in the Department of Health
and Human Services to determine which workers are most at risk. The
National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health would then be
required to send individual notices to between 100,000 and 300,000
of them every year and employers would be required to provide
medical monitoring programs for them.
   The National Association of Manufacturers and other opponents
claim that the monitoring programs and the possibility of
subsequent lawsuits by workers and former workers against their
employers could cost businesses up to $6 billion a year.

   Roswell (N.M.) Daily Record on U.S. involvement in Central
America:
   Liberal congressmen are obsessively fond of comparing U.S.
involvement in Central America with what later developed into the
Vietnam War.
   The trouble is, their comparison is with the wrong war.
   Double-dealing by Nicaragua's Sandinista government along with
House leaders' blindness to the reality of the Central American
conflict is more reminiscent of the preliminaries to World War II.
   Like the Sandinistas now, Nazi Germany claimed it supported
peace, while working feverishly for war and conquest.
   The United States is not facing ``another Vietnam'' by giving
assistance to its Contra allies, it faces far worse if it doesn't.

   The Kennebec Journal, Augusta, Maine, on sending U.S. troops
into Honduras:
   Keeping the Contras in the field, if not in Nicaragua, seems to
be the basis for the $48 million emergency aid package introduced
... (March 18) in Congress. Only two weeks ago Congress couldn't
even agree on a $30 million ``humanitarian'' aid bill.
   The Sandinista raid (into Honduras) will probably turn around
that vote in short order.
   Daniel Ortega has a history of snatching diplomatic defeat from
the jaws of victory. After a previous Contra aid vote, he flew off
to Moscow; this time he decided on military action. ...
   But President Reagan won't get a free ride. Just by dispatching
3,200 troops to Honduras, 100 miles from the war zone, he ignited
what may be the largest anti-war protests since Vietnam. ...

   Nashville (Tenn.) Banner on the hostages in Lebanon:
   In vivid contrast to the situation in 1980 when 52 American
hostages were being held in Iran, little is heard these days about
the hostages being held in Lebanon.
   The hostages are rarely allowed to communicate with the outside
world, and their captors, believed to be Moslem fundamentalists,
rarely come out of the shadows.
   The hostages in Iran were freed after 444 days. But one of the
Lebanon hostages _ Associated Press newsman Terry Anderson _ has
now been held for a full three years. ...
   Anderson isn't the only victim of Lebanese kidnappers. But he is
the longest held of about two dozen Westerners missing in Beirut.
   And he was there because his job was to tell U.S. newspaper
readers what was happening in that tortured country.

   Westerly (R.I.) Sun on toy guns that look real:
   Handguns, both fake and real ones, are sources of concern in
what still seems to be a trigger-happy society ... given the
shocking homicide rate in this supposedly law-respecting country.
   San Francisco's city supervisors, following the lead of Los
Angeles, have just banned the sale of toy guns not easily
distinguishable from those they imitate.
   San Francisco's action came after police, fearing for their
lives when a mentally retarded boy pointed a real-looking pistol at
them, shot and killed the boy. ...
   There is no justification for the manufacturers to continue
putting on the market accurate toy replicas of lethal weapons.
   It is folly ... to tolerate the manufacture and sale of toys
that can easily be mistaken for real weapons, sometimes with tragic
consequences.

   Tulsa (Okla.) World on IRS penalties:
   A horror story about the Internal Revenue Service assessing a
$400 penalty against a small businessman who paid two cents less
than he owed has rightly outraged the public.
   But the nation's chief tax collector, IRS Commissioner Lawrence
B. Gibbs, offers a different perspective, one that clearly shows
Congress to be the source of a lot of the troubles between the IRS
and taxpayers.
   The tax code now includes 154 statutory penalties, he told
Congressional investigators, noting that Congress has changed the
tax code seven times in the last 10 years and enacted ``a seemingly
endless array of ad hoc penalties.''
   Gibbs, in trying to carry out an unpopular job, knows that the
whole system depends on public confidence ... and that wholesale
stupidness on the part of Congress is quickly eroding that
confidence.
   It's enough to make one sympathize with the IRS.

   It's time teacher-researchers, voter organizations and citizens

   Politics and politicians have picked up rotten reputations. That
stems partly from the Watergate era, the trauma of the Vietnam era
and various investigations and charges against public officials.
   And it results in part from journalists' digging, reporting and
commentary on those cases.
   Lots of potentially strong public officials want to avoid

   The Seattle Post-Intelligencer on Iran-Contra indictments:
   The indictments of the principals in the Iran-Contra affair are
heartening evidence that the judicial system is working properly.
   This is a country based on the rule of law. Democracy cannot
survive if it accommodates those who put themselves above the law.
Corruption in government, even for an avowed noble purpose, cannot
be tolerated.
   That's why those charged should stand trial to have their guilt
or innocence determined. ...
   It should be kept in mind in the months ahead that at issue here
is not the political question of what ought to be the proper role
of the United States in Nicaragua. The question is whether these
men broke the law.
   Obtaining a judicial answer to this question is important for
the spiritual health of the country, which depends on the faith of
its citizens in the rule of law.

   The Baltimore Sun on Iran-Contra pardons:
   Shredders, obstruction of justice, contempt for routine
governmental and political processes, lots of money, colorful
characters, White House involvement, special prosecutor, multiple
indictments. ...
   If it all sounds familiar, that's because it is. The Iran-Contra
affair is a repeat in many ways of the Watergate scandal of the
1970s. ...
   Just as in Watergate, the question of pardons is central to the
outcome of this drama.
   As a general rule, we don't believe pardons ought to be granted
or even discussed before guilt or innocence has been established in
the courts. But the general rule doesn't apply here. The question
of pardons needs some public discussion.
   The guilt or innocence of Adm. John Poindexter, Lt. Col. Oliver
North, General Richard Secord and Albert Hakim probably cannot be
decided until after President Reagan leaves office. ...
   Reagan should not pardon these men before trial, even though he
sympathizes with them and had a lot to do with their troubles.

   The Record, Hackensack, N.J., on sending U.S. troops into
Honduras:
   President Reagan's emergency airlift of 3,200 troops in response
to a supposed Nicaraguan incursion into Honduras is an example of
an administration driven to desperation as a result of its
inability to win additional aid for the Contras.
   At best, the airlift is a splashy way of stampeding Congress
into voting the rebels additional military aid. If so, it would
seem to run counter to the prevailing viewpoint of most Americans
as well as Congress.
   The plain fact is that the White House's Nicaraguan policy has
failed, the victim of scandals, ineptitude and miscalculation, and
it will take more than a war scare to bring it back to life.
   Instead of a military drive, this seemed to be a time for
holding the line, and reducing to a minimun the chances of added
hostilities.

   Charleston (W.Va.) Daily Mail on mandatory use of seat belts:
   The (West Virginia) Legislature has made the use of seat belts
mandatory. It's the wrong idea, done the wrong way for the wrong
reason.
   Yes, everyone should wear seat belts when driving. But it is
outrageous to have government decree such behavior.
   First, there's the approach itself. Lawmakers are using another
one of those rankling $25 fines to get their way.
   A more appropriate method would be to lower the amount of
damages that juries award injured parties who were not wearing seat
belts when they were involved in an accident.
   The motive was also wrong. Lawmakers were pushed to pass the
bill on grounds that it would help stop the U.S. Department of
Transportation from requiring air bags on cars.
   Ironically, West Virginia's law contains exemptions which keep
it from complying with the federal criteria for such laws.
   The state's new seat belt law may make lawmakers feel good. But
as a practical piece of legislation, it's a dismal failure.

   Marietta (Ga.) Daily Journal on aid to the Contras:
   There is no joy in being able to say ``we told you so''
regarding aid to the Nicaraguan Contras when the criminal
misjudgment of Congress may cost us thousands of American lives.
   When the vote on military aid for the Contra rebels fighting to
overthrow the illegal Marxist government in Nicaragua came up last
month, we argued that Daniel Ortega's recent peaceful overtures
were merely for show, and that if Congress cut off military
assistance to the rebels, Ortega would quickly resume his warring
ways and attempt to wipe out the relatively defenseless rebels.
   The Sandinistas have now begun to do just that.
   Amazingly, many liberals in Congress have refused to recognize
that the man who they thought was their friend, Ortega, has sold
them down the river.
   They cannot see that they have been used as pawns by an avowed
Communist who exploited their weaknesses to achieve a military
advantage.

   Owatonna (Minn.) People's Press on the Iran-Contra indictments:
   Since the Iran-Contra scandal broke nearly one and a half years
ago, President Reagan has declined to answer questions about the
possibilities of pardons, should those involved be convicted of
crimes.
   While Reagan's reaction to the indictments (issued last week
against former national security adviser John Poindexer, Lt. Col.
Oliver North, retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard Secord and
businessman Albert Hakim) and questions about the possibilities of
pardons are of immediate concern, so, too, are the thoughts of
those seeking election to the office of the presidency.
   If Reagan delays a decision on pardons, which he may grant prior
to any convictions, the next person elected president of this
nation may well face the decision.
   The indictments and the possibility of pardons have heightened
the importance of the Iran-Contra scandal as a campaign issue.
   Now more than ever, the American public needs some answers from
the candidates, including Vice President George Bush.

   If the United States took all the money spent each year on
anti-poverty programs _ about $130 billion _ and divided it by the
number of Americans categorized by government as poor _ about 32
million, each poor person would receive over $4,000; each family of
four over $16,000.
   Even if we subtracted a reasonable amount for administrative
costs, there would still be more than enough to lift all welfare
families above the poverty-income threshold _ $11,202 for a family

   The Reagan administration cuts off aid and payment of canal fees
to Panama, and suddenly the rule of strongman Manuel Noriega is
being challenged, openly and violently, in the streets by his own
people.
   There is a temptation to say that the White House finally found
the right button to push to get a rebellion started, but ... that
interpretation is too simplistic by far. ...
   The banks of Panama have been closed for days, they aren't
expected to reopen soon. A canal fee payment, due (last) week from
the United States, is NOT in the mail. That's a $6.5 million
shortfall right there. ...
   It's a lot, but a ruler who had the support of his people could
weather that much and more. But the fact is, the first
demonstrations against the Noriega regime occurred in Panama City's
streets last summer. ...
   In the year of Costa Rica President Oscar Arias' Nobel Peace
Prize for his regional peace plan, there is even less of that
commodity in Central America than usual. ...
   As for the people of Panama, they can concentrate on the one
problem at hand _ and it looks increasingly as if they aim to do
that, for as long as it takes.

   St. Louis Post-Dispatch on the balance of trade:
   For America to seek an actual trade surplus is probably unwise.
   If the United States were to run a surplus, most of its trading
partners would have to run deficits, and the majority of these
nations' economies are neither large enough nor rich enough to
afford them.
   While the U.S. economy continues to grow, even if slowly,
Europe's economies remain largely stagnant.
   Perhaps Japan could survive a trade deficit for a time, but
South Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore _ known as the four
Asian ``tigers'' _ could not, for the same reasons as the Europeans.

   Sandinista and Contra rebel negotiators
resumed their cease-fire talks today closer than ever to reaching
agreement on steps to end Nicaragua's six-year war.
   But, as the two sides entered the third session of talks, the
state-run Voice of Nicaragua radio reported a Contra violation of
the truce agreed on for the talks' duration.
   The broadcast said the U.S.-backed rebels ambushed an army truck
near Mulukuku in the northern province of Matagalpa at 2 p.m.
Tuesday, killing two soldiers.
   Bosco Matamoros, a spokesman for the rebels, told reporters that
``there could be isolated cases, but there is a clear will from
both sides to respect that decision (for a truce).''
   A Defense Ministry spokesman in Managua, who spoke on condition
of anonymity, said, ``We have no information about (the report),
but we will see if we can confirm it.''
   The main stumbling blocks facing the third round of talks
appeared to center on the mechanics of how the Contras would lay
down their arms and be granted amnesty. On Tuesday, both sides
exchanged proposals that agree on major points.
   Defense Minister Humberto Ortega, who heads the government
delegation, said today that he was optimistic there would be
success in today's talks.
   Tuesday, he said he expected a ``concrete agreement'' to emerge
from the discussions. But sources close to the talks cautioned that
they could still stall on final details. One source said the talks
could continue beyond today.
   ``It is like a boxing match,'' a Sandinista official, who spoke
on the condition of anonymity, said Tuesday. ``They were tense
(Monday) and they had some sparring (Tuesday).''
   Adolfo Calero, political leader of the U.S.-supported Contras,
described the second round of talks as ``direct and frank.''
   The two sides stood far apart at the start of the talks, which
opened Monday at this border post 90 miles south of Managua and
which represented the government and rebel leaders' first
face-to-face meeting in Nicaragua. A battlefield truce that began
Monday appeared to be holding.
   In other developments, a Pentagon source said today American
troops are expected to return home Monday and Tuesday following
emergency training exercises in Honduras.
   And White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said U.S. troops
should begin their withdrawal ``over the weekend.''
   Fitzwater also expressed cautious optimism about the talks.
   ``They do seem to be making progress,'' he said, adding that it
was ``somewhat surprising'' in view of previous actions by the
Sandinistas.
   The Sandinista proposal, outlined by Deputy Foreign Minister
Victor Hugo Tinoco on Tuesday, calls for a truce of up to 90 days
during which the Contras would lay down their weapons and join a
``national reconciliation dialogue.''
   For every rebel who stops fighting, the government would release
a political prisoner the Sandinistas consider eligible for release.
The government is holding an estimated 3,300 political prisoners.
   Contrary to previous Sandinista demands, Tinoco said rebels who
put down their arms would be free from prosecution without applying
for amnesty and could take part in Nicaraguan political life.
   They would be permitted to operate uncensored newspapers,
magazines and radio stations, but television would remain a
government monopoly. Many press liberties were barred for almost
six years under a state-of-emergency decree.
   The Contra proposal calls for a 45-day cease-fire and would
provide for zones to be set up for the estimated 10,000 Contra
combatants to gather while a permanent truce is negotiated.
   It does not mention when the rebels would be willing to give up
their arms.
   The proposal calls for total amnesty, return of political
exiles, full press freedoms, a suspension of the military draft
during the truce and incorporation of Contra representatives into
the national dialogue process.
   The Sandinistas called for an international commission to verify
an end to hostilities, which the government says have claimed
26,500 lives since 1981.
   The Sandinistas, according to sources who demanded anonymity,
also want the Contras to be more specific about a final cease-fire.
The government also would not be expected to give in readily to the
Contra demand for suspending the draft during a truce or for an
immediate, total amnesty.
   A national dialogue as well as the cease-fire are included in
the regional peace plan signed Aug. 7 by the presidents of
Nicaragua, El Salvador, Costa Rica, Guatemla and Honduras.
   That plan also calls for greater democracy and an end to foreign
aid to insurgents and the use of one country's territory for
attacks on another.

   A teen-ager was given a suspended death sentence
and six classmates received prison terms ranging from two years to
life for the stabbing death of a college student, an official
newspaper reported Tuesday.
   The Beijing Daily said the seven, all 17- and 18-year-old
students from a technical school, were convicted Monday of
involvement in the Dec. 2 slaying of Zhang Han, a student from
Beijing Normal University.
   The report said the seven ran out of their dormitory and
attacked Zhang and others with bricks and knives after hearing
people outside shouting insulting remarks. It was not clear if
Zhang was among the shouters.
   Dong Qiufei, identified as the assailant who stabbed Zhang,
received a death sentence with a two-year reprieve. That means the
sentence will be changed to life imprisonment if he shows a good
attitude in the next two years.
   Long Kaiyuan, who had a criminal record for thefts, was
convicted of hooliganism and sentenced to life in prison. The other
five received terms ranging from two to 10 years.
   Zhang was among three college students murdered in brawls in
December.

<HEAD>Once-Burning Land Reform Issue Disappears From Chilean Politics</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KEVIN NOBLET</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Land reform, the issue that helped
trigger a 1973 military coup, has disappeared from the country's
political agenda as effectively as the horse-drawn plow from the
fields.
   Experts say the country's ranks of landless peasants remain
swollen and may be worse off than they were a decade or two ago.
But social and economic changes have dulled their once-fierce
thirst for their own acre to till.
   The loss of priority is evident in declarations by civilian
politicians pressing for an end to the 14-year-old military
government of President Augusto Pinochet. No longer do they cry out
for expropriation of large land holdings for distribution among the
poor _ a call that once chilled the blood of wealthy farmers and
ranchers.
   A recent 91-page proposal by six opposition groups for a
transitional government to restore democracy contained not a word
on the issue. ``There will be no land reform'' during any such
transition, Patricio Aylwin, president of the Christian Democratic
Party, told reporters.
   ``The young are calling for a well-paid job rather than for
land,'' said Emiliano Ortega, a Santiago-based agronomist and
social scientists. ``They remember the experience of their fathers,
who lost their land.''
   The issue of land reform began sweeping Latin America in the
1950s and 1960. In Chile it reached its peak under the government
of President Salvador Allende, a Marxist elected in 1970. His
adminstration expropriated about 16 million acres for distribution
among 60,000 peasant families. Some farms were directly seized by
leftist groups.
   The upheaval helped trigger a 1973 coup that installed Pinochet,
commander of the army and a fierce anti-communist.
   Pinochet quickly gave back more than half the expropriated land
to its original owners or new farming companies, and tens of
thousands of peasants were booted off their newly acquired plots.
Powerful peasant organizations, often aligned with the political
left, were dismantled.
   A free-market economic program was launched, stressing
agricultural exports. To compete in world markets, farmers were
pushed to modernize with costly tractors and other machinery,
fertilizers and insecticides. Many made the expensive switch from
traditional crops such as wheat and corn to more profitable
products, especially fruit.
   The result has been an extraordinary agricultural boom, with
production up by about half overall and annual exports soaring from
about $20 million in the early 1970s to more than $500 million now.
   But the peasants found themselves without a secure role. The
land reform efforts and ensuing modernization destroyed the
traditional ``hacienda'' system, under which peasants worked as
tenant farmers or farmhands with free housing. In addition, many
peasants who did receive land found competition too costly and sold
their plots.
   Tens of thousands turned to seasonal and migrant labor, working
eight to 16 hours a day for a monthly salary equivalent to less
than $100, said Solidarity, a church-sponsored magazine on human
rights and issues. ``The peasant became just another laborer.''
   Ortega said that as a result of the changes, the peasant of the
1980s is more interested in his paycheck and working conditions
than in being given land he can't afford to cultivate.
   ``There's been a very strong cultural change and a strong change
in labor relations,'' he said. ``It's not going to be like in the
past.''
   ``Before, peasants lived for generations on the land. Now they
don't, they don't live within the farms. Thus, they don't identify
themselves as much with a piece of land.''
   Ortega estimated the number of seasonal farm laborers at about
300,000 and said they will represent a powerful political force if
given the opportunity to organize.

<HEAD>Group Plans To Burn Puppy In Protest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MADISON, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   People outraged over a protest group's
announced plan to burn a puppy to demonstrate the brutality of war
in Nicaragua today flooded a radio station and the county humane
society with calls.
   The Dane County Humane Society office logged at least 30 phone
calls in the first hour it was open from people opposing plans
announced Tuesday by David Read, founder of the Nihilist Workers
Party, an animal shelter official said.
   ``The whole thing is we want to put people in touch with the
worst feelings they've ever had,'' said Read, 26, a University of
Wisconsin-Madison philosophy student. ``I think this is really
brilliant because it will hit a raw nerve with people.''
   ``We're going to prevent it as best we can,'' Mary Collins,
shelter manager, said today.
   Humane society officials were meeting with the state humane
officer to see what could be done and were recording the names and
addresses of callers ``in case we need bodies to protest his
protest,'' Collins said.
   Read's telephone number was busy this morning. Collins said
shelter officials had been giving it to callers, suggesting they
contact Read.
   Some of the callers had suggested Read set himself on fire, she
said. Callers to WIVA-FM in Madison suggested Read should either
burn himself or go fight in the war himself instead of torturing a
puppy.Police said harming the animal could lead to an arrest.
   Shelter officials cannot confiscate the animal, even if they
knew where it was, on the basis of a threat to burn it next week,
Collins said.
   Read said war has become normal in our society and he wants to
demonstrate its brutality by dousing the puppy with gasoline and
burning it next Tuesday on campus. If police or spectators try to
stop the effort, Read said, it will kill the puppy somewhere else.
   Read said he fully expects to be arrested and jailed and to be
criticized.
   ``We're going to be recruiting a lit of a goon squad for
protection,'' Read said. ``Let's face it, people are going to try
to stop us.''
   He said the 10-week-old dog, which he described as a mutt, was
being held at an undisclosed location outside Madison.
   Read said he and a friend organized the Nihilist Workers Party
in Madison in 1986 to spread the doctrine of nihilism, a belief
that existing social, political and economic institutions must be
destroyed in order to make way for new institutions.

<TEXT>
   The Education Department on Wednesday released
a booklet with tips for parents who want to help their children
read but may not know the best way to go about it.
   ``The surest prevention of illiteracy is making sure kids know
how to read,'' Chester E. Finn Jr., assistant education secretary
for research and improvement, said in unveiling the 29-page booklet.
   ``And children's first and most important teachers are their
parents. We want to help parents who want to help their children to
read,'' he said.
   The booklet, ``Becoming a Nation of Readers: What Parents Can
Do,'' begins by noting that reading is a skill that continues to
improve with practice. Then, starting with parents of preschoolers,
the booklet offers suggestions for things parents can do to
encourage their children to read.
   The Education Department's first tip to parents of young
children is to read aloud to them. ``When adults read aloud,
children quickly learn that a book is a wonderful thing,'' the
booklet notes.
   For parents of children in kindergarten and first grade the
booklet suggests parents continue to read aloud with their
children, take their children on trips to the library or bookstores
and listen to their children read. The booklet also recommends that
parents ``place reasonable limits on TV viewing.''
   And for parents of children in higher grades, the booklet
suggests parents set aside a time and place at home for studying.
It also recommends parents keep close tabs on their children's
progress and encourage reading for fun.
   ``For some families, plainly this booklet is not necessary,''
Finn said. ``But it's a useful book for parents who have the
impulse and don't know how to go about it.''
   The reading booklet, which is being printed by the Lexington,
Mass.-based D.C. Heath and Co. textbook publishers, can be obtained
by sending 50 cents to: ``What Parents Can Do,'' Consumer
Information Center, Pueblo, Colo. 81009. Numerous school districts
and the American Federation of Teachers also are printing copies.

<HEAD>Newspapers Say Censorship Like Soviet Union</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURINDA KEYS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Newspapers likened government
press restrictions to those of the Soviet Union and said Wednesday
the closure of a militant newspaper for blacks endangers all South
African news media.
   The closing of the New Nation is ``a chilling reminder of the
lengths to which the government is ready to go in its attempts to
impose thought countrol,'' the Star of Johannesburg said in an
editorial.
   ``After this, no other newspaper is safe,'' South Africa's
largest daily declared.
   Home Minister Stoffel Botha, who has censorship powers under the
emergency in effect since June 12, 1986, issued a decree Tuesday
prohibiting publication of the New Nation for three months.
   The weekly tabloid is financed by the Roman Catholic Church. Its
editor, Zwelakhe Sisulu, has been in detention for 15 months.
   Botha also warned a monthly Cape Town community paper,
Grassroots, that it faces closure or prior censorship if it
continues publishing ``subversive propaganda.''
   Grassroots was the eighth paper to receive a warning, the first
step in the closure process, and the New Nation was the first to be
shut down.
   An editorial in the Cape Times said:
   ``If the newspapers continue on traditional lines in spite of
such warnings, will they share the fate of New Nation? The
censorship system seeks to achieve a compliant press on Pravda-like
lines, rather than a wholesale closure of publications, which would
be embarassing and inconvenient.
   ``If it is really felt that newspapers are fomenting revolution,
why not charge them in the courts? There are laws enough.''
   Business Day, a conservative Johannesburg daily, declared:
   ``The decision to close New Nation for three months confirms
what has been plain for some time: South Africa can no longer claim
to have a free press and in this respect, as in others, it has left
the ranks of civilized nations.
   ``In the past it was possible to argue that the press was
restricted, but free, and even to make self-flattering comparisons
with the British Official Secrets Act. This is no longer so.
   ``It seems idle to protest at the closing of a newspaper when
that newspaper's editor, Zwelakhe Sisulu, has been in detention
without trial for more than a year. Government's opponents _ or
those it deems opponents _ are locked away indefinitely for crimes
which cannot be defined in the law, and are punished without a
chance to rebut the charges against them.
   ``The decision to suppress New Nation rests on the minister's
opinion that the newspaper propagated communism, but neither the
minister nor the law can define the crime for which the newspaper
is punished. Radical newspapers will be circulated ... as they are
in the Soviet Union, from hand to hand.''
   A pro-government daily, The Citizen, took a different view.
   ``Newspapers still report most of the news that is fit to print,
and where reporting is restricted, they still, in the main, give a
fair picture of what is happening,'' it said. ``But South Africa is
in a state of emergency. The press is subjected to stringent
restrictions.''
   The Citzen also said, however, that court proceedings would have
been better than Botha's action, which was taken ``on the
recommendations of a faceless panel of so-called experts exercising
judgments that are personal, based on no specific criteria or
guidelines, and cannot be tested in a court of law.''

<TEXT>
   A radio program which bills itself as the
``voice of Indian America'' is fighting to survive as the only
nationally broadcast native American news program, its founder says.
   ``First Person Radio'' is heard on 35 stations in 13 states,
down from 52 stations in 26 states, said Laura Waterman Wittstock.
And financial troubles for public radio have clouded the program's
future, she said.
   ``We're sort of passengers in a sinking ship, so to speak,
because the Indian-owned radio stations are in equally distressed
situations,'' Wittstock said recently.
   The half-hour weekly news and commentary program is produced by
Migizi Communications, an 11-year-old, non-profit organization
based in Minneapolis. Migizi is Ojibwe for eagle.
   ``The eagle symbolizes messages, and also it's a symbol of high
standard,'' Wittstock said. ``We wanted to have the highest
standards of Indian journalism, to train more Indians into
journalism and to develop a national news service.''
   And the show enables Indians around the country to feel a part
of a community. In southern Alabama, it serves 1,859 members of the
Poarch band of Creek Indians.
   ``We're the only reservation in Alabama. The cultural exchange
is really important,'' said Dale Gehman, a Creek Indian who is
general manager of WASG-AM in Atmore, Ala. ``I don't know what we'd
do without it.''
   Alaska Public Radio offers separate stories about Indians which
are distributed by National Public Radio, but not in the format of
a regular broadcast program, according to NPR.
   Correspondents in New Mexico and Idaho regularly file stories to
give ``First Person Radio'' a national flavor, Wittstock said. But
affiliated stations have been unable to offer many stories because
they are also struggling and have little time left over to make
contributions, she said.
   ``The '80s have been disastrous for radio _ not just Indian
radio,'' she said, adding that interest in sponsoring minority
radio programs has lost favor to shows with mass appeal.
   So why do Wittstock and Dale Means, the show's program adviser,
struggle to keep ``First Person Radio'' on the air?
   ``I feel there is a market for Indian programming, but nobody is
doing it,'' said Means, brother of former American Indian Movement
leader Russell Means. Dale Means helped start KILI-FM on the Pine
Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota that went on the air in
1983 to mark the 10th anniversary of the Wounded Knee occupation.
   Early on, KILI and Migizi, which received promotional support
from the American Indian Movement, were criticized within the
Indian community because of that association, Means said.
   ``It wasn't an AIM podium, so to speak. That's one of the good
things about the radio station,'' he said. ``On occasion, it had
some critical comments about AIM itself.''
   But the issue no longer arises, Wittstock said. ``We've proven
ourselves.''
   Before ``First Person Radio'' began in the late 1970s, Wittstock
said, ``You might get a little snippet about a demonstration, or a
little snippet about a murder, or somebody going to jail for 99
years or something like that. That isn't Indian news.''
   Recent news stories have included coverage of federal college
loan problems for Navajo students, an ongoing land claims dispute
on the White Earth Indian Reservation in northern Minnesota, and a
law requiring labeling to distinguish wild rice harvested by
Indians from the paddy-grown variety.
   Training young journalists is an important goal for Wittstock,
50, the last director of the defunct American Indian Press
Association, which distributed articles to about 100 Indian
newspapers nationwide.
   She and Means, 46, run after-school programs for students
interested in learning about communications, and have trained 50
college students over the years.

<TEXT>
   Water officials facing what could be the
state's second-driest year ever have declared an emergency shortage
and warned 1.1 million customers that water rationing may be
ordered for homes and businesses.
   The East Bay Municipal Utility District stopped short of
imposing emergency restrictions but voted yesterday to approve a
$300,000 campaign to teach the public water conservation methods.
   ``We don't want to make this a Draconian thing, but we do want
to save a lot of water,'' district General Manager Jerome Gilbert
said at the board of director's meeting Tuesday.
   The board will meet again April 13 to consider rationing but is
already divided over whether to allow more water in the warmer
areas such as the San Ramon Valley.
   Directors from Berkeley and Richmond argued it would be unfair
if affluent suburbs such as San Ramon receive an extra share of
water for their sprawling lawns and gardens.
   Water officials said studies show rain and snow runoff from the
Mokelumne River Basin, the district's major water source, is
estimated at 180,000 feet, 24 percent of normal.
   ``This year has the potential to be the second-driest year
ever,'' said Ted Way, chief engineer.
   Officials stopped short of declaring a drought for the district
east of San Francisco, but said river runoff from snow melt will
average 60 percent of normal between April and July statewide.

<TEXT>
   A nearly 2-year-old lawsuit that accuses
several Iran-Contra figures of collaborating with Colombian drug
lords is under attack by the defendants who call the complaint
``legal terrorism.''
   The lawsuit, filed in May 1986 several months before the
Iran-Contra affair was exposed publicly, names some of the people
in the private network that Lt. Col. Oliver L. North formed to help
the Nicaraguan Contras.
   The lawsuit has attracted widespread attention, and The Christic
Institute, a liberal policy group representing the plaintiffs, has
used it as a vehicle to raise money.
   Daniel Sheehan, the Christic's chief counsel, has traveled
around the country speaking about the suit, which was filed by
Martha Honey and Tony Avirgan, two American reporters based in
Costa Rica.
   The allegations in the civil lawsuit _ set for trial June 26 in
federal court in Miami _ are significantly different and much
broader than the issues raised by Lawrence Walsh, the independent
counsel in the Iran-Contra case.
   Last week, a federal grand jury indicted four men on charges of
conspiring to defraud the U.S. government in the program to sell
weapons to Iran and divert the proceeds to the Contras.
   They are John M. Poindexter, the former national security
adviser; North, Poindexter's one-time aide; and Richard V. Secord
and Albert Hakim, two arms dealers who helped North run the
Iran-Contra program.
   Secord and Hakim are among the 29 defendants in the Miami
lawsuit, which does not cite any U.S. government officials. Central
to the lawsuit is the claim that the defendants conspired to
traffic in drugs and plot assassinations in Central America and
elsewhere.
   Lawyers for both sides expect the trial to proceed despite
Walsh's criminal indictments.
   ``This case is going to trial,'' said Thomas Spencer, an
attorney for retired Gen. John Singlaub, one of the defendants in
the lawsuit.
   Honey and Avirgan are represented by attorneys for The Christic
Institute, a liberal policy group based in the nation's capital.
   ``I think they (the plaintiffs) are desperately looking for a
way to get out of the lawsuit,'' Spencer said. ``They have come to
the conclusion there is no basis for their case.''
   Peter Dykstra, a spokesman for the Washington-based institute,
rejected Spencer's claim. ``We want a trial _ why else would we be
doing this?'' he said.
   Spencer and other defense lawyers have waged a concerted effort
to discredit the lawsuit. Among other things, they have obtained
affidavits from some of the Christic's sources, contradicting
information in the lawsuit.
   Judge James Lawrence King ordered the institute to reveal its
sources.
   Secord, meantime, has filed a $5 million slander suit against
Eugene Wheaton, one of the institute's principal ources. Wheaton's
lawyer, Robert Thompson, said his client has not responded to the
lawsuit.
   At the heart of the Honey-Avirgan lawsuit is the allegation that
``a secret team'' headed by former CIA official Theodore Shackley
worked over two decades to manage a covert, shadow government
funded with drug profits. There has never been independent
confirmation of the charge.
   Shackley has waged a personal publicity campaign to defend
himself and vowed to seek reprisals through the legal system.
   In an article in the Journal of Defense & Diplomacy, Shackley
described the plaintiffs as ``practitioners of character
assassination through legal terrorism...''
   The Christic Institute stands by its charges, and Sheehan says
he is developing more information that implicates the defendants.
But many of the institute's theories will not be tested in court
because King has limited testimony in the case to events between
1983 and 1986.
   Specifically, Avirgan and Honey seek damages of $22 million to
compensate Avirgan for injuries he suffered inside Nicaragua at a
bombing at a May 1986 press conference held by former Contra
leader, Eden Pastora. Three reporters died in the bombing.
   The lawsuit claims the defendants, who include known Colombian
drug smugglers Pablo Escobar and Jorge Ochoa, conspired to:
   _ Kill Pastora because he would not cooperate with other Contra
rebels.
   _ Smuggle cocaine into the United States to finance Contra
operations.
   _ Assassinate a U.S. ambassador in Costa Rica in order to claim
a bounty.
   The special congressional committees that investigated the
Iran-Contra case last summer did not deal specifically with
allegations raised in the lawsuit.
   But a Senate panel chaired by Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., is
looking into reports of drug-dealing by the Contras. The rebels
have denied they trafficked in narcotics.
   The Iran-Contra committees, however, heard public testimony from
Glenn Robinette, a former CIA security specialist who said Secord
paid him thousands of dollars to investigate the lawsuit in 1986.
   Over the past several months, the institute has conducted
depositions of witnesses, many of whom have refused to talk, citing
their Fifth Amendment right to remain silent.
   Spencer said the lawsuit has cost Singlaub $150,000 in legal
fees so far, and that could double. The institute has budgeted $3
million to cover operational expenses 1988, with 90 percent of the
money expected to be spent on the lawsuit.

<TEXT>
   A bone marrow transplant researcher was named
Wednesday as recipient of the $50,000 Bristol-Myers Award for
Distinguished Achievement in Cancer Research.
   George Santos, professor of oncology and medicine at The Johns
Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore, will receive
the prize at a luncheon May 4 in New York.
   Bone marrow transplants are used to treat leukemia.
   Santos was among the first researchers to realize the importance
of suppressing the immune system with drugs in bone marrow
transplants, to avoid a potentially fatal complication known as
graft-versus-host disease, said E. Donnall Thomas, director of the
Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and a member of the award
committee.
   In the disease, immune system cells from the donated marrow
attack the recipient's tissue as foreign.
   Santos said he and colleagues are now studying use of marrow
transplants as part of treatment of cancers of the breast, ovary
and colon. The research involves using higher-than-usual doses of
chemotherapy to kill cancer cells, then doing transplants to
restore marrow destroyed as a side effect.
   Another line of research is using the drug thalidomide in
fighting graft-versus-host disease, he said. Animal studies are
encouraging, he said in a statement.
   Thalidomide is best known for causing birth defects when taken
by pregnant women as a sleeping pill in the 1950s. But apart from
that, scientists say, it has far fewer side effects than
cyclosporine, another suppressor of the immune system that can
damage the kidneys.

   Two Iraqi jetfighters inadvertently
violated Turkish airspace when they bombed Kurdish guerrillas in a
joint security zone along the border, it was reported Wednesday.
   The semi-official Anatolia News Agency said Tuesday's air raid
caused panic in villages in southeast Turkey, a few miles from the
border with Iraq. It said the Iraqi warplanes bombed Kurdish
guerrillas fighting for an autonomous homeland.
   It was not known if there were any causualties.
   An estimated 19 million Kurds seeking independence live in the
area where the borders of Iran, Turkey and Iraq meet.
   Turkey and Iraq have an agreement granting rights to each other
to operate in a 6-mile-wide joint security zone along the common
frontier.
   Turkish military units also have been fighting Kurdish
guerrillas over the past four years. Turkish warplanes staged two
air raids against Kurdish rebel hideouts in the joint security zone
in the past two years.

<HEAD>Shamie Will Not Challenge Kennedy</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Updates with announcement</NOTE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   State Republican Party Chairman Ray Shamie said
today he will not challenge Sen. Edward M. Kennedy this year.
Instead, longtime Shamie aide Joseph Malone will run against the
veteran Democrat.
   Shamie, a retired Walpole millionaire, told a news conference he
had decided, despite pleas from President Reagan and other national
party officials, to remain state party chairman.
   Among other things, Shamie said he was concerned about giving up
a chairmanship won only last year to run what most observers agree
is an uphill battle to unseat Kennedy, who will be seeking his
fifth full term.
   Shamie, 67, endorsed Malone, saying that none of the other
Republicans who expressed interest in challenging Kennedy would be
serious candidates.
   Malone, 33, of Waltham, has been a close aide to Shamie since
1982, when Shamie emerged by mounting a credible challenge to
Kennedy. Currently, Malone is executive director of the Republican
Party under Shamie.
   A graduate of Harvard College in 1978, Malone has helped operate
a family trucking business and also is a partner in family real
estate holdings.
   ``I have devoted 10 years of my life working to help bring back
a two-party system to Massachusetts,'' Malone said in an interview.
``It's important that we have a strong, aggressive campaign in
Massachusetts.''
   The top GOP party brass was concerned that a weak challenge to
Kennedy would leave him free to roam the country helping other
Democratic campaigns, including the presidential race.
   But state Rep. John MacGovern said Shamie, ``did not like being
used by other people like a battering ram. He did not want to run.
You're just banging yourself up to keep Ted Kennedy busy.''
   Malone is a virtual unknown in Massachusetts except in political
circles. He is well off from his family business interests but said
he is not a millionaire.
   Shamie spent $1.8 million against Kennedy in 1982 when he lost
61 percent to 38 percent. He spent a record $2.3 million in 1984
against John Kerry for Senate in a race Kerry won 55 percent to 45
percent.

<HEAD>Gun Seizures Down at Capitol, But Self-Defense Sprays Soar</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT M. ANDREWS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police on the lookout for terrorist attacks at
the Capitol report a 50 percent decline in seizures of handguns and
rifles last year but a sharp increase in canisters of chemical
sprays that visitors carry for self-protection.
   Figures supplied by senior police officials appeared to
contradict an earlier claim by House Sergeant-at-Arms Jack Russ
that weapons seizures rose by a startling 147 percent at the
Capitol last year.
   Members of a House Appropriations subcommittee said Russ left
the impression at a recent hearing that many of the 1,162
confiscated weapons were guns. Russ cited the figure in arguing for
an $18.5 million plan to tighten security on the House side of the
Capitol.
   But Capitol Police Chief Frank Kerrigan said in a subsequent
interview that all 1,162 actually were canisters of Mace, tear gas
and other non-lethal chemical sprays, some in lipstick-style
containers, that women carry to immobilize would-be attackers. The
same seizures totaled 470 the previous year.
   Tear gas and other chemical sprays are illegal in the District
of Columbia, including the Capitol grounds. The Capitol Police
classify them as weapons subject to seizure and destruction.
   Kerrigan said chemical sprays accounted for the vast majority of
the actual total of the 1,270 weapons confiscated at the Capitol
last year, a 125 percent increase over 1986. The police said gun
seizures actually declined to 14 from 28 the previous year.
   The balance included knives, explosive liquids, clubs,
blackjacks and various exotic weapons, plus non-lethal ``stun
guns,'' which use an electrical jolt to render victims temporarily
harmless.
   Asked about Kerrigan's details, Russ said he must have
misinterpreted the figures he received from the Capitol Police.
Senior members of the House panel that heard Russ' testimony
discounted suggestions that he might have given misleading figures
in an attempt to gain support for his security plan.
   But Rep. Vic Fazio, D-Calif., the subcommittee chairman, said
House members responsible for Capitol security intend to take a
much closer look at the situation, in consultation with the Senate,
before any decisions are made.
   Fazio said he has heard conflicting arguments over the need for
stricter anti-terrorist measures. ``We won't be stampeded,'' he
said.
   ``I don't think Jack was trying to mislead us, but it does raise
a question,'' said Rep. John T. Myers, R-Ind., a panel member.
   Rep. Jerry Lewis of California, the subcommitee's ranking
Republican, agreed with Fazio's go-slow approach.
   ``They're pushing very hard to increase security everywhere up
here,'' Lewis said. ``We must protect ourselves in this modern age
of terrorism, but I tend to resist any unnecessary steps that would
hinder the public's access to the Capitol.''
   Kerrigan said the sharply higher number of weapons seizures
probably reflected improved use of metal detectors in the Capitol
building and six nearby office buildings, better training of police
officers and more thorough searches of visitors, rather than any
increase in the number of visitors with criminal intent.
   Russ said many of the visitors who carry firearms have
out-of-state gun permits but are unaware that the permits are
invalid on the Capitol grounds.
   Kerrigan said 63 people were prosecuted at the Capitol last year
on illegal-weapons charges, compared with 50 people in 1986.

<HEAD>General Assemby condemns U.S. Move Against PLO Mission</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Leads with 14 grafs to update with PLO statement, editing for

   The General Assembly voted overwhemingly
today to condemn the U.S. move to close the Palestine Liberation
Organization's U.N. Mission.
   The assembly voted 148-2 to deplore the U.S. action and urge it
to abide by the international U.N. Headquarters Treaty, which
allows foreign missions to operate. The United States and Israel
voted against the resolution.
   General Assembly resolutions are not legally binding, but carry
moral weight.
   The vote came one day after the U.S. Justice Department filed a
lawsuit seeking to close the PLO Mission and freeze its funds, in
accordance with an anti-terrorist law.
   U.S. Ambassador Herbert S. Okun, the deputy permanent
representative, said the Justice Department was obliged by law to
enforce the anti-terrorist legislation, which would close the
mission.
   But he said the United States would take no further steps to
close the mission until a court has ruled on the U.S. lawsuit filed
in U.S. District Court in Manhattan.
   The PLO envoy, Zehdi Labib Terzi, told the assembly that the
United States claims to be proud to play host to the United
Nations. Then he shouted:
   ``What pride to you have in throwing your guests out?
   ``Is this the message the U.S. delegation wants to bring to the
world? That guests have no respect, the United Nations has no
respect, international law has no respect? ...
   ``This is not gunboat policy any more. We are living in a stage
where the human approach, where obligations are respected,'' said
Terzi. He said the PLO will fight the U.S. lawsuit.
   Of the United States, Terzi said: ``Is this the country which
claims to be the bastion of freedom and democracy ... afraid to
permit the voice of the Palestinians?''
   Israeli Ambassador Johanan Bein, the deputy permanent
representative, told the assembly that the PLO has been ``the
principal terrorist organization of our time'' and it rejects the
central U.N. principle of peaceful settlement of disputes.
   On Tuesday, the PLO accused the United States of engaging in
``financial terrorism'' by seeking a court order to close the
mission and force the PLO to transfer its bank funds out of the
United States.
   The closure of the mission is required under the 1987
Anti-Terrorism Act, which found the PLO and its affiliates were a
terrorist organization responsible for numerous violent incidents,
including the murder of an American citizen during the hijacking of
the cruise ship Achille Lauro in 1985.
   The feud over the future of the PLO's mission on East 65th
Street has created a crisis in U.S.-U.N. relations.
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz also has called the law ``a
very bad piece of legislation'' which unnecessarily glorifies the
PLO.
   Terzi has said he will have to be dragged away from the PLO
mission and that if forced to move, it will be to the United
Nations on international territory, out of reach of U.S. marshals.
   In 1973, PLO Chief Yasser Arafat spent a night at the United
Nations because he could not stay on U.S. territory.

<HEAD>Mitterrand Comes Out Swinging in Re-Election Bid</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFFREY ULBRICH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nobody was surprised when President Francois
Mitterrand finally announced he would seek re-election, but many
were stunned by the pugnacity of his words and his version of
Charles de Gaulle's ``me or chaos'' alternative.
   The 71-year-old Socialist president declared his candidacy in a
television interview Tuesday night, waiting until five weeks before
the first round of voting to end months of speculation.
   Mitterrand had said he preferred to step down but would run for
a second seven-year term if ``exceptional circumstances'' warranted
it. He said Tuesday that after listening to the speeches of other
candidates, he was convinced France is in danger.
   ``I see a risk that the country might fall into the quarrels and
division that so often have undermined it,'' he said. ``I want
France to be united. And it will not be if it is taken in hand by
intolerant minds, by parties who want everything, by clans, by
gangs. ...There must be civil peace in France.''
   Though he named no names, the president's remarks were aimed at
his two main opponents, conservative Premier Jacques Chirac and
former centrist Premier Raymond Barre.
   Typical of the reaction in the conservative press Wednesday,
Gerard Badel wrote in Le Parisien: ``The chief of state has, in
sum, confronted the French people with the choice that he had so
often reproached Gen. de Gaulle for: me or chaos.''
   Alain Juppe, spokesman for Chirac's government, said Mitterrand
``goes to war against perils that do not exist.''
   ``If there is really danger, one wonders why Mr. Mitterrand
waited so long to say so. In reality, all that is pure
fabrication,'' Juppe said.
   French presidential elections are run in two rounds. The first,
April 24, pits Mitterrand against Chirac, Barre and a handful of
minor candidates. If, as expected, nobody wins a majority, a runoff
will be held May 8 between the top two vote-getters.
   For the past year, the polls have indicated that Mitterrand will
win the second round handily, no matter who his opponent is. But he
could slip now that he has had to abandon his strictly presidential
role.
   Chirac remarked on what he called Mitterrand's ``language of
rare violence and sectarianism that risked setting the French
against one another.'' The stakes, he said, are clear: ``On one
side, there is the Socialist Party that wants to retake power and
institute Socialist policies ... on the other is the (conservative
parliamentary) majority that has governed for two years in calm and
union.''
   Barre said he doubted Mitterrand could unite the country, adding
that since the president's election in 1981 he has been ``the
president of one fraction of the French population against
another.''
   The reality is that since the mid-1980s, French politics have
moved toward the center. The gulf between the left and right has
narrowed to the point where it is difficult to distinguish the two.
   Without an overriding issue, the campaign has evolved into one
of personalities.
   There is Chirac, 55, the hard-driving, almost frenetic,
political bulldozer, and currently the leading rightist; Barre, 63,
the thoughtful economics professor, who is more toward the center;
and Mitterrand, who in the two years since the right ousted the
Socialists from control of the National Assembly, has become the
sage father figure.
   The vocabulary is the same. Each has presented himself as the
only man capable of uniting the French.
   Few differences exist in foreign policy and defense. Even
unemployment, now at 10.4 percent, has not emerged as a
battleground. Both right and left have tried and failed to come to
grips with it.
   In his announcement, Mitterrand presented no program, saying
only that he would get to it later.
   Since ``cohabitation'' between the Socialist president and the
conservative premier was forced on French politics by the 1986
legislative elections, Mitterrand has profited the most. He has
taken pains to distance himself from the Socialist Party, which he
founded and led for years, and is trying to appear as a man above
parties.

<HEAD>Protest Fast For Return Of Refugees To Pakistan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HASAN SAEED</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The ailing leader of at least 150,000
Pakistani refugees began a fast Wednesday to demand that Islamabad
take back the refugees stranded here since 1971.
   ``If the Pakistan government does not respond favorably to our
request for early return to our country, hundreds and thousands of
our brothers and sisters will be on fast unto death,'' said Nasim
Khan, 64, who began his fast outside the National Press Club.
   Khan suffered a heart attack two weeks ago. He told The
Associated Press, ``It's better to die struggling to go back to our
homeland than live in vice, hunger and disease ridden camps in an
alien country.''
   Khan and the others were stranded in 1971 when Bangladesh,
formerly East Pakistan, became an independent country after a
liberation struggle and a war between India and Pakistan.
   By 1973, 174,000 refugees returned to Pakistan, but the
repatriation ended abruptly when funds ran out, stranding 250,000
people. About 100,000 are believed to have returned since, but the
rest remain in refugee camps in Bangladesh.
   Bangladesh Foreign Secretary Nazrul Islam told reporters
Wednesday that his government has renewed a longstanding request to
Pakistan to make arrangement for the return of the refugees.
   Islam said Pakistan has agreed in principle to take back the
refugees. But a Pakistani diplomat, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said sufficient funds for the transfer still were
lacking. Moslem charitable organizations have been asked for help
in raising the money.
   As Khan began his fast, hundreds of other refugees held a silent
march on a nearby street.
   Nasim Khan Bazlul Huda, 19, said, ``I will burn myself to death
soon if Pakistan does not announce a timetable for our
repatriation.''
   Islam said that Dhaka and Islamabad had approached a number of
countries and world organizations to raise enough money for a
repatriation of refugees.
   Four years ago, the stranded Pakistanis planned a march to their
homeland, but border guards crushed it.

   Gov. Evan Mecham's former chief of staff
testified today there was no effort to cover up an $80,000 loan
from the governor's protocol fund to Mecham's auto dealership.
   ``I just forgot or failed'' to record the check in the fund's
checkbook register, former chief of staff Jim Colter told the
Senate.
   Colter also told prosecutor William French that Mecham had
called his home on Tuesday and left a message on the answering
machine ``that I had done a good job, or something to that effect''
in his earlier testimony.
   Meanwhile, the Senate voted 25-4 today to drop the longer
schedule it had adopted in an effort to speed up the impeachment
trial. Prosecution and defense lawyers complained the eight hours
of testimony Tuesday left them too little time for preparation, and
lawmakers agreed to return to a six-hour schedule.
   Voting against the shorter schedule were Republican Sens. Carl
Kunasek, Bob Usdane, Tony West and Peter Kay.
   The Senate is now hearing testimony on the second impeachment
charge, which accused Mecham of misusing $80,000 from the
governor's protocol fund by loaning it to Mecham Pontiac.
   ``There was certainly no effort to cover up'' the loan, Colter
testified today.
   Colter testified Tuesday that he warned the governor it would be
``politically unwise'' to borrow the money, but Mecham instructed
him to write the check anyway.
   ``You certainly were not anxious that the general public be
aware of this loan, were you?'' French asked today.
   ``No, I did not broadcast it,'' Colter replied.
   The former chief of staff acknowledged that he did not shop
around for better interest rates before processing the loan to
Mecham Pontiac, but added, ``As far as I'm concerned (the loan) was
a good investment of the money.''
   It had ``nothing to do with the governor's personal use,''
Colter said.
   However, Democratic Sen. Jones Osborn questioned whether it
would be a subsidy to Mecham Pontiac to loan it money if the
interest rate were lower than the dealership would have had to pay
to a bank.
   Colter said Mecham also asked him not to record a document
securing the loan, although Colter did not know why. He testified,
however, that he did not think any law had been broken ``or I would
have objected.''
   The protocol fund, created with fund-raising revenues from
Mecham's inauguration, is intended to be used for state ceremonial
gifts.
   The prosecution contends the fund is public money and therefore
the loan was illegal, while the defense says the money can be used
as Mecham sees fit, except to repay his campaign expenses.
   However, the first two witnesses to testify on the charge said
they were shocked when they heard that Mecham had loaned the funds
to his auto dealership.
   ``I was very surprised and disappointed and saddened,'' said
Warner Lee, a former state attorney general who advised the Mecham
inaugural committee. ``I thought that it was a very awkward thing
politically to have done.''
   ``I personally was shocked and initially felt betrayed,'' said
Deputy Maricopa County Attorney Howard Schwartz, who helped draft
an agreement for use of funds raised by Mecham's inaugural
committee.
   In an interview Tuesday on KTAR radio, Mecham said he considered
the protocol fund to be ``private association money ... not state
money.''
   He acknowledged he was told ``it was politically not a wise
thing to do, but I wasn't thinking of that.'' The governor said he
could have borrowed the money from other sources, but decided on
the protocol fund so it would earn the 9 percent interest being
paid by Mecham Pontiac.
   Mecham, the first U.S. governor to be impeached in six decades,
also said if he is exonerated, he will do a better job as governor.
   ``They'll probably say this is another one of those gaffes, but
a lot of the rats have come out of their holes that's been after
me, and now we know a lot more who they are,'' Mecham said. ``Quite
frankly, I'll be a lot wiser governor from here on out.''
   If he is allowed to resume his job, Mecham said, he will fire
Department of Public Safety Director Ralph Milstead, one of the
chief accusers in his Senate trial.
   A Senate conviction, Mecham said, ``will certainly not be on the
basis of evidence and on that we'll go and appeal it of course ...
probably direct to the U.S. Supreme Court.''
   Earlier Tuesday, the Senate finished hearing testimony on the
first impeachment charge _ that Mecham tried to thwart an
investigation of an alleged death threat by a state official
against a former top Mecham aide.
   After heated debate, a motion to vote on the first count
immediately was dropped after it became clear most senators wanted
to hear testimony on all three charges first.
   The third charge accuses the governor of concealing a $350,000
campaign loan. A two-thirds vote of the 30-member Senate is
required to convict Mecham and remove him from office.
   Meanwhile, a lawyer defending Mecham at his April 21 criminal
trial on six felony counts related to the $350,000 loan sought
dismissal of the charges. The lawyer, Michael Scott, said the
governor has been singled out for prosecution because he is
unpopular.
   The judge did not rule on the motion. Mecham also faces a May 17
recall election.

   State Republican Party Chairman Ray Shamie said
today he will not challenge Sen. Edward M. Kennedy this year.
Instead, longtime Shamie aide Joseph Malone will run against the
veteran Democrat.
   Shamie, a retired Walpole millionaire, told a news conference he
had decided, despite pleas from President Reagan and other national
party officials, to remain state party chairman.
   Among other things, Shamie said he was concerned about giving up
a chairmanship won only last year to run what most observers agree
is an uphill battle to unseat Kennedy, who will be seeking his
fifth full term.
   Shamie, 67, endorsed Malone, saying that none of the other
Republicans who expressed interest in challenging Kennedy would be
serious candidates.
   Malone, 33, of Waltham, has been a close aide to Shamie since
1982, when Shamie emerged by mounting a credible challenge to
Kennedy. Currently, Malone is executive director of the Republican
Party under Shamie.
   A graduate of Harvard College in 1978, Malone has helped operate
a family trucking business and also is a partner in family real
estate holdings.
   ``I have devoted 10 years of my life working to help bring back
a two-party system to Massachusetts,'' Malone said in an interview.
``It's important that we have a strong, aggressive campaign in
Massachusetts.''
   The top GOP party brass was concerned that a weak challenge to
Kennedy would leave him free to roam the country helping other
Democratic campaigns, including the presidential race.
   But state Rep. John MacGovern said Shamie, ``did not like being
used by other people like a battering ram. He did not want to run.
You're just banging yourself up to keep Ted Kennedy busy.''
   Malone is a virtual unknown in Massachusetts except in political
circles. He is well off from his family business interests but said
he is not a millionaire.
   Shamie spent $1.8 million against Kennedy in 1982 when he lost
61 percent to 38 percent. He spent a record $2.3 million in 1984
against John Kerry for Senate in a race Kerry won 55 percent to 45
percent.

   A physicist reported Wednesday the discovery
of a new superconducting compound that he believes may work at
minus 100 degrees Fahrenheit, potentially setting a new temperature
record for superconductivity.
   The compound, made of lanthanum, copper and oxygen, forms
crystal structures that are relatively pure examples of the basic
copper-oxygen lattice found in all the new superconductors, said
Stuart Wolf, who reported the development along with colleagues
from the Naval Research Labortatory.
   Because of their relative purity they may be able to attain
superconductivity at higher temperatures than other materials, he
said.
   The compound now appears to become superconducting at above 280
degrees below zero Fahrenheit, but that could go to minus 100
degrees Fahrenheit or higher, he aid.
   The substance can be made only at temperatures of 2,700 degrees
Fahrenheit and at pressures 65,000 times those of the atmosphere,
but it can then be cooled and studied at normal temperatures and
pressures, he said.
   Allen Hermann of the University of Arkansas reported that he has
now achieved superconductivity at a temperature of 234 degrees
below zero Fahrenheit with a superconductor he discovered late last
year.
   IBM scientists had been the first to push Hermann's new
superconductor to that temperature, even before Hermann himself
could do it, demonstrating how rapidly research is spreading and
advancing.
   When Hermann and his Arkansas collaborator Zhengzhi Sheng
announced the discovery of the material, ``within two days we had
confirmation around the world,'' he said _ almost before the ink
was dry on his laboratory notebooks.
   For physicists, who are accustomed to working in exotic realms,
minus 234 degress Fahrenheit is warm. Previous superconductors had
operated at no higher than minus 418 degrees Fahrenheit.
   No one can yet be sure how much higher temperatures will go, but
many are optimistic that temperatures will continue to climb. ``I
think we have simply uncovered the tip of the iceberg,'' said
Hermann.
   The so-called high-temperature superconductors that have set
physics ablaze offer the promise of dramatically cheaper
electricity generation, transmission and storage, faster and
smaller computers and 300-mile-an-hour magnetically levitated
trains.
   But initial enthusiasm for those applications is now somewhat
lower, as each discovery raises as many questions as it answers,
physicists said.
   ``We don't want to promise too much to society,'' said Robert
Cava of Bell Laboratories. ``But the promise exists.''
   The latest batch of reports came at an unscheduled session held
Tuesday night during a meeting of the American Physical Society.
   The meeting, convened by researchers eager to swap their latest
findings, followed by one year the ``Woodstock of physics'' in New
York, at which the first reports of the new superconductivity were
presented to scientists in a session that continued until the wee
hours of the morning.
   Physicists in New Orleans discussed new experiments with two
superconductors first reported earlier this year _ the
thallium-containing compound found by Hermann and Sheng and another
containing bismuth, which was first reported by Hiroshi Maeda and
colleagues in Japan.
   Fears the new superconductors would be unable to carry currents
large enough for practical applications have diminished, the
researchers said.
   It has now been shown that the materials are potentially capable
of carrying huge amounts of current, and researchers reported that
they have devised ways of making them that bring them closer to
their theoretical current-carrying capacity.
   Theoretical physicists are still trying to figure out how the
new superconductors work, but the availability now of four distinct
superconductors has made some aspects of their operation clearer.
   All the superconductors include sheets of copper and oxygen,
suggesting that these sheets are critical. Furthermore, the
materials that operate at higher temperatures have these copper
oxide sheets, as they're called, layered in twos and threes.
   Physicists are now trying to make compounds with the copper
oxide layers grouped in fours, on the hunch those materials will
have even higher operating temperatures.

   NICARAGUA:
   SAPOA, Nicaragua _ Negotiators for the Sandinistas and Contra
rebels resumed their truce talks today after exchanging proposals
that for the first time agree on major points. The proposals, put
forth on the second day of talks Tuesday, call for an extended
cease-fire, amnesty and release of political prisoners. Among
obstacles still to be worked out are how the Contras will lay down
their arms and be granted amnesty.
   The state-run Voice of Nicaragua today reported a violation of
the truce agreed on during the peace talks. The radio said the
Contras ambushed an army truck Tuesday, killing two soldiers. A
Defense Ministry spokesman said the ministry had no information
about the report.
   WASHINGTON _ The Reagan administration and House Speaker Jim
Wright called reports of progress at cease-fire talks in Nicaragua
encouraging. Democratic leaders said agreement there likely would
trigger a new package of humanitarian aid for the Contra rebels.
   President Reagan is seeking to revive his stalled effort to aid
the Contras. The last aid package ran out Feb. 29.

troops sent as a response will stay on to complete emergency
training exercises. In Washington, Pentagon officials say the
American troops will return Monday and Tuesday.

   PANAMA:
   PANAMA CITY _ A general strike aimed at ousting Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega was in its third day today. It closed an estimated
90 percent of offices and industries on Tuesday, and food is
running low. On Tuesday, Noriega again rejected a U.S. call for him
to surrender power and go into exile.
   WASHINGTON _ Reagan administration officials say they've tried
to encourage Noriega to leave Panama by offering to fly him into
exile along with family and friends. Noriega told two high-levle
U.S. envoys who visited him last week that he was not willing to
accept any arrangement that involves leaving Panama.

<TEXT>
   A trial lawyers' group has sharply criticized
members of two prominent law firms for concealing evidence from
families who sued their clients over water pollution alleged to
have caused six cancer deaths.
   In documents filed with a federal appeals court, the
Massachusetts Academy of Trial Attorneys said the conduct of
attorneys representing Beatrice Foods Co. and the owner of a Woburn
tannery threatened to undermine the judicial system by encouraging
lawyers to flout court rules.
   ``The court must support those who abide by the rules and expose
those who bend them to their own advantage,'' the academy said in a
brief filed to support the request by eight Woburn families for a
new trial in their suit against Beatrice and the John J. Riley Co.
tannery.
   ``A wrongdoer should be unable to take comfort or benefit in a
judgment obtained by cheating,'' the academy said in the brief
filed Tuesday with the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
   The lawyers' group singled out Beatrice attorney Jerome Facher
of the law firm of Hale & Dorr for its harshest criticism.
   ``The concealment of information through misrepresentation and
misconduct was accomplished by the lead attorney for the
defendant,'' the academy said. ``As a senior member of the bar, he
commands respect and attention. How the court determines the
appropriateness of his conduct will not go unnoticed.''
   Without naming her, the academy also lambasted Mary Ryan of the
law firm Nutter, McClennen & Fish, the attorney for Riley, which
bought the tannery from Beatrice. The families blame the tannery
for polluting the town's water supply.
   Neither Facher nor Ryan returned telephone calls Wednesday from
The Associated Press.
   The academy frequently files briefs in cases involving complex
and controversial legal issues. It did not specify requested
sanctions against the lawyers.
   The filing with the appeals court followed U.S. District Judge
Walter Jay Skinner's decision in January denying the families a new
trial.
   Their original suit contended four parties were responsible for
the pollution, Beatrice and Riley, W.R. Grace Co., and Unifirst, a
uniform supply company. Unifirst settled prior to trial and W.R.
Grace settled for a reported $8 million halfway through the trial.
Skinner dismissed the portion of the suit against Beatrice and the
tannery.
   The families asked for a new trial after their attorney learned
of a 1983 report that was not disclosed by Facher or Ryan. The
report said it was possible that dumping on the tannery property
contributed to groundwater pollution near two town wells.
   Skinner ruled that Facher and Ryan were aware of the report but
failed to disclose it to the families. But the judge refused to
order a new trial, saying he did not think the report would have
affected the outcome of the case and that the families failed to
prove the concealment was deliberate.
   The families' attorney, Jan Schlichtmann, and the academy said
Skinner applied the wrong standard in deciding the issue, saying
that he was wrong to speculate that the report would not have led
to evidence favorable to the claim that pollution on the tannery
property seeped into the town's water supply.

   Just say no to sex. That's the idea
being promoted in a new book by the leader of the nation's largest
Hare Krishna community.
   Kirtanananda Swami Bhaktipada on Tuesday said he's looking for a
publisher for his work, titled ``The Joy of No Sex,'' in which he
urges people to practice celibacy.
   ``Sexual pleasure is a perversion of the real pleasure, which is
spiritual living,'' said Bhaktipada, spiritual leader of 700
Krishna devotees at New Vrindaban.
   He said people should engage in sex only to procreate.
   The national epidemic of fear over AIDS will make his ideas more
palatable in the United States, Bhaktipada said. In addition, he
said he will mail a copy of the book to Pope John Paul II.

   President Saddam Hussein has dismissed the
ministers of light industry and heavy industry from his Cabinet and
replaced them with the army officer who supervises the manufacture
of Iraq's military hardware.
   A presidential decree issued Tuesday night and published
Wednesday by government newspapers said Heavy Industry Minister
Abdul-Tawab Mulahuwaish and Light Industry Minister Hatem
Abdul-Rashid were relieved of their duties.
   It did not say what prompted their dismissal, but added that
Col. Hussein Kamil has been appointed Minister of Industry and
Minerals.
   Government sources said the cabinet reshuffle is designed to
merge the two ministries and give the military industry a boost.
   Kamil, a career military man, has been heading the War Industry
Committee that supervises the manufacture of military equipment.
   Iraq says it is making some of its own ammunition and weapons,
including long-range missiles.
   More than 100 missiles have been fired at the Iranian capital,
Tehran, since Feb. 29 in a missile duel by the nations.
   While the Iraqis say these were homemade, Western military
analysts believe they are Soviet-built, surface-to-surface Scud-Bs
that the Iraqis have equipped with boosters to increase their range.

<TEXT>
   Republican presidential contender Bob Dole on
Wednesday accused Michael Dukakis and the rest of the Democratic
White House hopefuls of a ``failure of nerve as well as a failure
of vision'' in responding to the Soviet-backed regime in Nicaragua.
   ``The call to defend the freedom of Nicaragua, which should be
easy for them to answer, instead produces endless foot-shuffling
and sophistry,'' Dole said in a speech that made little mention of
his own presidential candidacy and avoided even a single reference
to GOP front-runner George Bush.
   Dole said the issue of the Sandinista government in Nicaragua is
``as symbolic for our time as Hitler's brazen aggression was for an
earlier generation.''
   He warned that failure to confront it might eventually lead to
communist governments in Costa Rica, Panama or even Mexico as the
Sandinistas strengthen their grip at home and begin supporting
guerilla movements elsewhere.
   ``What will the Democrats say then?,'' he asked in a speech that
marked the beginning of an effort to lay out his views on a variety
of issues. The Kansas senator is far, far behind Bush in the race
for delegates to the Republican National Convention, and is widely
viewed as a candidate for withdrawal after the Wisconsin primary on
April 5.
   In his speech to the Center for Strategic and International
Studies, Dole addressed an issue that has divided Republican
candidates _ who favor military support for the Contras fighting
the Nicaraguan government _ from the Democrats who oppose it.
   He turned his fire on Massachusets Gov. Dukakis, the other
Democratic presidential hopefuls and the ``Democratic left.''
   Dole said Dukakis ``says that the Monroe Doctrine, which has
defined America's security in its own neighborhood for some 200
years, is `obsolete.' He says that this country ... has no choice
but to tolerate the existence of Soviet client states wherever
subversion might install them.''
   Broadening his attack, Dole added, ``Today, all the Democratic
party presidential candidates sound themes similar to the `Dukakis
Doctrine' for Latin America .... Instead of joining President
Reagan in challenging the thieves, they have found ways to
rationalize the loss of liberty in Nicaragua.''
   Dole's charges brought a sarcastic reply from Dukakis'
communications director, Leslie Dach.
   ``I guess Bob Dole is taking after Michael Dukakis because he's
accomplishing what Bob Dole can't _ beating George Bush in the
polls,'' Dach said.
   Dole said Democrats are guilty of an attitude that says
``America must not be too forceful'' that stems from the belief
that America, rather than the Soviet Union, poses a threat to peace.
   ``Perverse but pervasive, this attitude has enveloped the
Democratic side of the primary campaign like nerve gas,'' he said.
   Dole cited anti-Communist stands taken by Democratic presidents
Harry Truman and John F. Kennedy, but said the party has abandoned
its heritage.
   ``The question (among Democrats) has become whether we should
bear any burden at all? Will the liberal Democrats pay even a small
price, one reckoned in American money rather than American lives?''
he said.
   Dole said, ``What we see on the Democratic side of this
presidential campaign is a failure of nerve as well as a failure of
vision.''
   He added, ``Today we stand and watch as Nicaragua slowly twists
in the wind and the fate of the Americas begins to tilt.''

<BYLINE>How About Using Air Force One for Your Next Party?
^By HARRY F. ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The club lady in Illinois never knew what a
flap she caused when she wrote the president of the United States
asking to use Air Force One as a party room for the ``spectacular
event'' she had to plan.
   ``Frankly, we can't think of anything which would be more
thrilling,'' she wrote to Richard Nixon, who was president then.
``You can land on our property, seven secluded acres.''
   The letter, which has rested all these years in a file folder,
was only one document out of 400,000 that were opened to public
view for the first time Tuesday by the National Archives. But while
hundreds of people begged for a ride on the presidential plane, it
was the only one that asked to use it for something other than
transportation.
   Her answer came directly from Ralph D. Albertazzie, an Air Force
colonel, who was the president's pilot.
   ``Landing Air Force One on seven acres of ground would certainly
be a spectacular event in itself!'' Albertazzie wrote. ``I can only
say for reasons far too numerous to enumerate: No.''
   According to the records, that didn't sit too well with Gen.
James D. Hughes, who was Nixon's military aide. In a note, he
chewed out the colonel for making light of ``a sincere effort on
the part of the writer to score a million in one shot for her
club.'' A chastened Albertazzie replied, ``I've goofed,'' and a
White House functionary wrapped up the whole thing with a note
``for obvious reasons, please keep this in your restricted file.''
   A ride on the president's airplane, a blue and silver Boeing 707
with ``The United States of America'' lettered boldly across each
side, is the ultimate status symbol and a lot of Americans want one.
   ``Dear Mr. President,'' one letter began. ``My nephew will be
leaving shortly to start his three years as a law student at
Georgetown School of Law in Washington, D.C.
   ``With some of his money he purchased quite an expensive stereo
with speakers and we are quite reluctant to ship, mail or whatever
this item. Is it permissible in any way for this stereo and
speakers to be transported on Air Force One when you return to
Washington from your sojourn in California?''
   No.
   ``I see you are flying to California and I wonder if I can hitch
a ride,'' a young man wrote. ``I'm going there to see a girl I
haven't seen in 14 months. I'm a small guy and I won't take up much
space. All I'll have is a small suitcase and my guitar.''
   No.
   Correspondence and memos about Air Force One _ renamed ``The
Spirit of '76'' for a time in the Nixon tenure _ fill a half-dozen
thick file folders in the National Archives. Such requests
undoubtedly come to every president.
   If politicians wanted to be seen on Air Force One _ and they
did, desperately _ the White House reciprocated by using rides as a
political tool.
   ``It is a prized thing to ride on Air Force One and we intend to
keep it that way,'' said presidential appointments secretary Dwight
Chapin in chewing out political adviser Murray Chotiner for
inviting a congressman.
   ``No one is allowed to place a guest on the president's aircraft
without prior approval of the president,'' Chapin wrote.
   Chapin also asked another presidential assistant for a memo
``detailing the responsibilities and duties of the hand-holder when
he travels on Air Force One.'' Hand-holders, Chapin explained, are
people carried on the plane ``for the purpose of massaging VIPs.''
   Another time, Chapin complained to Hughes that the wife of White
House chief of staff H.R. Haldeman ``was placed in a three-abreast
seating area whereas there was a forward compartment with sundry
military personnel in two-abreast and more comfortable seating.''
   The pleasures of riding Air Force One were more image than
comfort. A dozen memos complained about lousy food. Others griped
about the temperature in the cabin being too cold. In one, Chapin
groused that meals used to be served with crystal glasses and china
and ``now, plastic seems to be the in-thing.''
   There also was a curious memo from Chotiner to Chapin. He asked
for a ride ``in the event the president has a plane going to

<HEAD>Administration Opposes New Sanctions on Haiti for Now</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration said Wednesday it
would be premature to impose new economic sanctions on Haiti
because the new government of President Leslie Manigat ``has shown
a determination to move Haiti in a democratic direction.''
   While the administration is not prepared to seek a lifting of
sanctions imposed on Haiti after election violence late last year,
new incentives may be in order as the Caribbean nation makes steps
toward developing democratic institutions, said Richard Holwill,
deputy assistant secretary of state for inter-American affairs.
   ``If we hope to play a constructive role in Haiti ... we will be
obliged to consider incentives as well as sanctions, and be willing
to judge progress by specific interim milestones,'' Holwill told a
House Foreign Affairs subcommittee.
   ``We should not expect perfection before we offer assistance,''
he said.
   Several members of Congress have introduced legislation to
impose a series of trade sanctions on Haiti unless a more
democratically elected government is installed. The sanctions
include revocation of Haiti's lucrative sugar quota and suspension
of other trade preferences.
   But Holwill said the legislation would be counterproductive.
``The Haitian people..., not we, should determine the fate of the
Manigat government,'' he said. ``They now appear willing to give
that government a chance.''
   The administration last Nov. 29 suspended all direct aid to
Haiti's government, leaving in place only humanitarian assistance
operated through private organizations.
   The move cost Haiti some $60 million in economic aid and about
$2 million in military aid in the current fiscal year, the State
Department estimates, while about $36 million in humanitarian aid
continues to flow.

   An unemployed streetsweeper who burned himself to
death in a car near Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's residence
took his life in a ``futile gesture,'' a coroner said Wednesday.
   Westminster Coroner Paul Knapman made the remark after an
inquest ruled that Derek Bainbridge's death Feb. 16 was a suicide.
   Bainbridge, 40, who lived in Worksop in central England, had
been depressed about his inability to find work a year after
leaving his job as a streetsweeper.
   ``I am quite satisfied he has taken his life in a rather
dramatic but futile gesture,'' Knapman said.
   On Wednesday, Bainbridge's brother visited Mrs. Thatcher's
residence and presented a photograph of Derek inscribed with the
words from his suicide note, ``Too young to retire ... Too old to
live.''
   ``We are not a political family,'' said Joseph Bainbridge. ``But
we want Mrs. Thatcher to see the man who died at the end of her
road.''
   Unemployment in Britain was 9.1 percent in February, down from
9.2 percent in January and 11 percent in February last year.

   Congressional supporters will seek about $100
million in 1989 funding for the superconducting super collider
project, around a third the amount requested by President Reagan,
Rep. Carl Pursell, R-Mich., said Wednesday.
   Pursell and House members from five other states hoping to win
the project met to map strategy for pushing appropriations through
Congress.
   The $4.4 billion physics research center has been attacked by
congressional critics, who argue the massive project would siphon
away money needed by research in other areas.
   The Energy Department is expected to decide in November where to
build the super collider.
   In his 1989 budget, Reagan proposed spending $363 million on the
facility..
   Congressional supporters of the project, however, are
considering funding ``somewhere around the bottom of $100 million
plus,'' Pursell said after the private meeting. ``We have not fixed
on exact figures.''
   The House members also discussed target dates in their drive to
ensure the project survives congressional budget cuts.
   ``As long as we've got good support from the leadership, we're
sure we can get through the budget process,'' Pursell said.
   The project proponents, members of an ad hoc task force, will
meet soon with House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, and Minority
Leader Robert Michel, R-Ill., to discuss appropriations for the
facility, Pursell said.
   The super collider, involving a 53-mile-circumference particle
accelerator, will produce 4,000 jobs and have an annual operating
budget of $279 million.
   Physicists have said the project is necessary to gain a greater
understanding of the physical structure of the universe.
   Besides Michigan, states that remain in the running for the
project are Arizona, Colorado, Illinois, North Carolina, Tennessee
and Texas.
   Arizona was unrepresented at Wednesday's meeting, Pursell said.

<TEXT>
   Frank E. Terpil, a fugitive former CIA agent
turned gunrunner, went to Cuban four years ago and works for that
country's intelligence service, a Cuban defector says.
   Maj. Florentino Aspillaga Lombard, in an interview with The
Washington Times published on Wednesday, said Terpil has helped the
Cuban DGI intelligence agency recruit Americans and conduct
counterintelligence operations.
   Aspillaga, a career employee of the DGI until he defected to the
United States last June, also said Nicaragua's Sandinista
government is under the ``complete control'' of Cuban leader Fidel
Castro.
   At the time of his defection, which took place in Vienna,
Austria, Aspillaga was the head of the DGI in Czechoslovakia.
   Aspillaga said Terpil ``travels with a Cuban passport and was
with me in Czechoslovakia.'' The Cuban said he hoped to bring
Terpil with him to Vienna, but Cuban intelligence officers blocked
Terpil from leaving the East Bloc.
   Terpil, a fugitive since 1980, was convicted in absentia in May
1981 of conspiring to sell machine guns to undercover agents posing
as South American revolutionaries. He was sentenced to 53 years in
prison.
   Terpil and former CIA agent Edwin Wilson were also charged with
selling explosives to Libyan leader Moammar Khadafy. Wilson was
convicted and sentenced in the case.
   After fleeing the United States, Terpil was reported living in
Lebanon.
   The Justice Department spokesman John Russell said he had no
information about Terpil's activities.

   Bessie Heard, who endowed her hometown
with a wildlife sanctuary and natural science museum, has died, a
museum spokesman said Wednesday. She was 101.
   More than 40,000 visitors each year come to the Heard Natural
Science Museum and Wildlife Sanctuary, which Miss Heard endowed in
1964. It includes more than five miles of nature trails, said Steve
Runnels, the museum's director of development.
   The non-profit museum and sanctuary are funded by the Bessie
Heard Foundation, membership dues, tuition fees, gift shop sales
and contributions.
   At the heart of the museum was ``Miss Bessie,'' as she was known
for most of her life.
   Miss Heard died Tuesday night at home, Runnels said.
   She was born May 26, 1886, the eldest of five daughters. Her
father, John Spencer Heard, spent four years in the Confederate
Army and then opened a general store in McKinney, north of Dallas,
with his brother.
   Miss Heard attended Mary Baldwin College in Staunton, Va., but
spent most of her life in McKinney.
   Survivors include two cousins. A funeral was scheduled Friday.

<TEXT>
   A man accused of making millions by
selling worthless mail-order cures for ills from impotency to
baldness to obesity has been banished from living and working in
Florida.
   Mitchell Friedlander, the 38-year-old owner of Robertson-Taylor
Co., entered pleas of no contest Tuesday to 13 charges of operating
a scheme to defraud.
   In return for his pleas, Broward County Circuit Judge Mel
Grossman, gave him a suspended one-year jail term, put him on
probation for five years and barred him from doing business or
living in Florida.
   Grossman withheld adjudication in the case, meaning Friedlander
will have no criminal record if he complies with probation terms.
If he forms a corporation, owns retail outlets or warehouses, or
obtains a mail drop in Florida, he can be sent to prison.
   Friedlander's mail-order company, which had 400,000 customers
and grossed millions in sales, began operating from a Fort
Lauderdale office in early 1984, police and his lawyer, William
Richey, said.
   Through ads in national magazines, it offered pills and lotions
to cure baldness, turn fat to muscle, relieve stress, increase
breast size, dissolve cellulite, cure impotency, and provide the
``ultimate orgasmic experience.''
   Three months after the business opened, police began
investigating customer complaints. In July 1985, police charged
Friedlander with 43 counts of racketeering, scheming to defraud,
misleading advertising and cheating.
   Six weeks later, he was charged with 70 new counts of fraud and
grand theft after police searched his office.
   Friedlander's no contest plea, which is not an admission of
guilt, was prompted after Grossman ruled that none of the evidence
gathered during the search would be admissible at trial. The ruling
wiped out 70 charges.
   The plea came as jury selection was beginning for trial.
   Today, Friedlander lives in Atlanta, in debt, according to
Richey.

<HEAD>High Court Considers Federal-State Role in Protecting Fired
Workers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID FOX</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   WASHINGTON _ Federal collective-bargaining laws should take
precedence over state laws protecting union employees who are fired
for filing workers' compensation claims, a lawyer told the Supreme
Court on Wednesday.
   Giving states the authority to govern union contracts ``would be
a threat to collective bargaining,'' said Charles C. Jackson, a
Chicago attorney representing the Norge Division of Magic Chef Inc.
   Federal laws regulating collective bargaining agreements provide
for arbitration to resolve unfair labor practices.
   But the lawyer for an Illinois woman fired by Norge said federal
law never was intended to thwart state statutes prohibiting
retaliatory firings.
   ``If this were (not) true, all states' rights could be channeled
away by arbitration,'' lawyer Paul Alan Levy contended.
   The Supreme Court agreed to weigh both arguments before ruling _
probably in July _ in the case of Jonna Lingle, who was fired in
late 1984 from her job at Herrin, Ill.
   The woman had notified Norge that she was injured on the job and
asked the company, under the state workers' compensation law, to
pay her medical bills. Norge fired Mrs. Lingle a week later,
contending she filed a false claim.
   However, her union contract contained a provision protecting
workers from dismissal without just cause, and the union filed a
grievance the day she was fired.
   An arbitrator ruled the firing violated the just-cause provision
and ordered her reinstatement. But before the ruling was issued,
Mrs. Lingle filed a lawsuit contending the dismissal was contrary
to Illinois law.
   The relief available through the courts was greater than what
she could receive through arbitration, which did not include
punitive damages and compensation for lost overtime.
   A U.S. District Court judge threw out her lawsuit, ruling that
the state law was pre-empted by the arbitration remedy available
under federal labor law, and the 7th U.S. Circuit Court upheld the
dismissal in June 1987.
   Levy asked the Supreme Court to overturn the lower-court rulings.
   ``The right of action is available to both union and non-union
employees alike,'' Levy argued. ``If there is any state cause of
action that is independent of a labor agreement, Lingle's case
ought to be one of them.''
   But Jackson said Congress gave states authority to supercede
federal law only on health and safety issues and said the power
does not extend to rules against retaliatory firings.
   ``If independent state laws were enacted that flew in the teeth
of a labor contract, they were pre-empted,'' he said. ``Mrs.
Lingle's claim is exactly what arbitration is all about. This is
why we have collective bargaining agreements.''
   A brief filed on Mrs. Lingle's behalf by the State and Local
Legal Center in Washington said 21 states and the District of
Columbia have laws protecting workers filing workers' compensation
claims.
   It identified the states as California, Connecticut, Hawaii,
Illinois, Louisiana, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Missouri,
Montana, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma,
Oregon, South Carolina, Texas, Virginia, Washington and Wisconsin.

   Bonnie Blair, the Olympic speed-skating
champion, dispensed some blunt advice Wednesday for girls whose
boyfriends don't want them to be athletic:
   ``Tell them to go jump in the lake,'' said Blair, who took the
gold medal in the 500-meter race and bronze at 1,000 meters in
Calgary. ``Maybe they're not worth having around.''
   Blair spoke at the City Hall launch of a drive by the Women's
Sports Foundation to encourage girls to take part in a new athletic
program at city high schools.
   Donna de Varona, a 1964 Olympic swimming champion who heads the
foundation, said the drive should help dispel myths about females
participating in sports.
   Blair said sports help girls to compete and to cope with other
challenges in life.
   ``There are lots of goals you can set for yourself,'' she said.
``You can apply that in everyday life. Once you find the thing you
like the most, stick to it and get the most out of it you can.''

   ``We just love it down there. Sally was born in Easton and, even
though she hadn't been down there in a while, we made a drive down

bought last October for $550,000.

   The ruling has a ``chilling effect'' on broadcast programs of

   New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley today
endorsed the presidential bid of Michael Dukakis, calling the
Massachusetts governor the Democrat's best hope against Republican
front-runner George Bush in November.
   ``Today I endorse Michael Dukakis for president of the United
States,'' Bradley said with the Democratic hopeful by his side. ``I
do so because among the candidates of both parties, he would make
the best president. And among the Democratic candidates, he is the
one who can beat George Bush.''
   Bradley, often mentioned as a possible dark-horse nominee if the
Democratic convention is deadlocked, said Dukakis can defeat the
vice president ``because he is tenacious, innovative, resilient and
disciplined.''
   ``And he has the personal depth and life experience that
embodies the promise of America,'' he said.
   Dukakis, who is expected to draw strong support in the state's
June 7 primary election with the endorsement, welcomed Bradley's
decision.
   ``This is a very important endorsement because it comes from one
of the most respected and one of the most accomplished public
figures in America today.''
   Bradley made the sought-after endorsement in an old railroad
terminal at Liberty State Park, in the shadow of the Statue of
Liberty. The terminal, now a museum, was used at the turn of the
century by immigrants who came through Ellis Island.
   Dukakis' parents came through the New York entry point in 1913.
   Bradley, a second-term senator, has declined repeated calls to
enter the presidential race himself. A former Rhodes scholar and
pro-basketball star who is viewed as one of the Democratic Party's
rising stars, Bradley has said he is not ready to seek the
presidency.

   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis today picked up the
endorsement of New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley, once mentioned as a
possible rival for the Democratic presidential nomination.
   The endorsement came as Dukakis' campaign was under attack from
Democratic and Republican presidential candidates on issues ranging
from trade to Central America.
   Bradley, who for months has fended off suggestions that he would
enter the presidential race if no front-runner emerged, today
called Dukakis the ``candidate who can beat George Bush.''
   ``He can beat George Bush because he is tenacious, innovative,
resilient and disciplined and he has the personal depth and life
experience tht embodies the promise of America,'' Bradley said.
   Dukakis, who appeared with Bradley at a New Jersey park, said
the endorsement came from ``one of the most respected and one of
tghe most accompliched pubblic figures in America today.''
   Meanwhile, Democratic presidential contender Richard Gephardt
today accused Dukakis of talking tough on trade to entice Michigan
voters.
   Bush, too, came under fire for supporting President Reagan's
veto of a major civil rights bill.
   Gephardt, who has staked out Michigan's caucuses on Saturday to
revive his battered presidential campaign, issued a statement today
accusing Dukakis of trying ``to have it both ways.''
   ``He may talk tough on trade in Michigan, but everywhere else he
has opposed tough legislation,'' Gephardt's statement said.
   And Sen. Bob Dole, a candidate for the Republican nomination,
also attacked Dukakis today for failing to stand up to
Soviet-backed subversion in Central America.
   ``He says that the Monroe Doctrine, which has defined America's
security in its own neighborhood for some 200 years, is
`obsolete,''' Dole said of Dukakis. ``He said this country ... has
no choice but to tolerate the existence of Soviet client states
wherever subversion might install them.''
   Gephardt hammered away at Dukakis as a new poll suggested he
trailed the Massachusetts governor by a 2-1 margin in Michigan,
which holds Democratic caucuses on Saturday.
   According to the survey, Dukakis had 35 percent; Jesse Jackson
29 percent; Gephardt 17 percent; Sen. Albert Gore Jr. 6 percent and
Sen. Paul Simon 5 percent, with 9 percent undecided, Detroit
television station WJBK said Tuesday night. The telephone poll of
400 Democratic or independent voters, with a margin of error of 5
percentage points, was taken over the weekend.
   Gephardt, who has made trade a campaign centerpiece, questioned
the sincerity of Dukakis' support for Senate trade legislation,
calling it a ``political ploy'' to win workers' votes in Michigan.
   ``Who is for a tough trade policy? Who is going to be for a
tough trade policy after Michigan?'' Gephardt asked. ``Dick
Gephardt is. ... Mike Dukakis hasn't been, isn't and won't be.''
   But the Dukakis campaign countered with a tape-recorded
interview in which Dukakis praised the Senate trade measure as long
ago as last year.
   ``I think the Senate bill, which is very, very different from
the Gephardt amendment, is sound policy. I would have voted for
it,'' the governor told the Des Moines Register on July 11.
   The Dukakis camp also hinted that if Gephardt keeps up the
accusations, it will strike back. A Dukakis aide, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said: ``Our gun is loaded and ready if any
salvos are fired at us.''
   Dukakis collected endorsements from Connecticut Gov. William
O'Neill and Sen. Christopher Dodd on Tuesday, a week before the
state's primary. O'Neill said he expected Dukakis, who has won in
every New England state so far, would do ``extremely well.''
   Meanwhile, a survey published in today's Washington Post
suggested Dukakis was the only Democrat who could outpoll Bush.
Fifty percent said they would vote for Dukakis in an election held
today and 45 percent said Bush. The newspaper said the survey,
conducted with ABC News, had a margin of error of 4 percentage
points.
   Bush was the chief target of Democrat Gore, who faulted him for
lacking the ``gumption'' to break with Reagan over the president's
veto of a civil rights bill, which Congress overrode Tuesday.
   Gore interrupted his campaigning to fly back to Washington and
vote for the override, as did fellow Democrat Simon.
   ``When push comes to shove the vice president never disagrees
with President Reagan,'' Gore said in Traverse City, Mich. ``He
really has not carved out an identity of his own in this election.''
   Simon hailed the civil rights measure and attacked the White
House for trying to quash it.
   ``It's another indication of the insensitivity of the
administration to women, to people with disabilities, to
minorities,'' Simon said.
   Jackson used the occasion to blast both Reagan and Bush.
   ``When you have a president who vetoes a civil rights act and a
vice president who suports him, there's a leadership gap in
Washington,'' he told an audience at Benton Harbor High School in

   Bush announced on the eve of the veto vote that he supported the
president, although he said he agreed with the main thrust of the
bill. New Jersey Gov. Thomas Kean, who had endorsed Bush just hours
before the vice president sided with Reagan, said Tuesday it was
time for Bush to start speaking his mind.
   ``The vice president in this instance should have said publicly
the way he felt. He said instead that he was going to be loyal to
the president,'' Kean said.
   Bush wasn't the only one put on the spot by the veto override.
Bob Dole, who did not vote on Tuesday, said if he were casting the
deciding vote he would have sided with the president. But he
indicated Tuesday night on CNN's ``Larry King Live'' that
otherwise, he would have voted for the override.
   Dole stressed he's not conceding the nomination _ yet _ but said
he wouldn't mind if his wife, Elizabeth, ended up on a ticket with
Bush.
   ``It would be all right with me,'' he said. ``I'd probably get a
car and driver out of it.''
   Mrs. Dole stepped down as transportation secretary to campaign
for her husband.

<HEAD>Economy Grew At 4.8 Percent Rate In 1987 Fourth Quarter</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Economy Bjt</HEAD>

   The government reported Wednesday that the
U.S. economy performed even better than previously thought from
October through December, growing at a robust 4.8 percent rate
which further eased fears of a recession triggered by the October
stock market collapse.
   The Commerce Department said the increase in the gross national
product, the total output of goods and services, was the fastest
advance in almost two years and represented an upward revision from
last month, when the GNP gain was put at a slightly lower 4.5
percent.
   Especially encouraging to economists was the upward revision in
particular sectors. The new GNP report said that both consumer
spending and business investment were not as weak as previously
feared and U.S. export sales were even stronger than originally
reported.
   When the fourth quarter GNP report was first released, many
economists expressed concern because the bulk of the growth came
from production of unsold goods which was occurring at the same
time that consumer spending was falling sharply.
   Many analysts worried that this overhang of excess business
inventories would cause a big drop in factory production and job
layoffs at a time when consumers were already worried about the
impact of the huge 508-point drop in the stock market which
occurred on Oct. 19.
   Some analysts even forecast that a recession would start in
early 1988, caused by weak consumer spending and falling industrial
production.
   But the economic evidence so far this year shows those worries
were overstated. Many analysts, while still looking for
significantly slower growth than last year, are now predicting the
economy will get through this presidential election year without a
downturn.
   ``One thing is clear _ the economy has shrugged off Oct. 19
pretty well,'' said Donald Straszheim, chief economist for Merrill
Lynch. ``We will not have a recession in 1988.''
   The brighter economic outlook is certain to cheer Republicans
campaigning to hold onto the White House. President Reagan,
speaking to a group of business executives Wednesday, boasted that
the country is now in the midst of its longest peacetime economic
recovery with the percentage of the labor force at work at an
all-time high.
   With the new revisions, the economy during 1987 grew 4 percent,
almost double the 2.2 percent increase turned in during 1986 and
the best showing since 1984. This figure measures growth from the
fourth quarter. Averaging all the quarters, the GNP grew 2.9
percent in 1987, identical to 1986.
   The administration is forecasting GNP growth of 2.4 percent this
year, with almost half of that gain expected to come from a further
rise in export sales.
   Private economists, whose original forecasts were well below
that estimate, have been busy revising their own projections upward.
   William Dunkelberg, dean of the business school at Temple
University, said he believed many private economists are still
underestimating economic strength, citing the February unemployment
report, which showed the jobless rate dropping to an 8{ year low of
5.7 percent.
   ``I think the economy is going to look a lot stronger in the
first half of the year than people have been predicting,'' he said.
``We see tremendous strength in the export side of the economy.''
   The 4.8 percent GNP growth in the fourth quarter followed growth
of 4.3 percent in the July-September quarter and was the fastest
quarterly growth rate since an increase of 5.4 percent in the first
three months of 1986.
   The rapid growth occurred without a pick-up in inflation. A
price index tied to the GNP rose at an annual rate of 3.6 percent
in the fourth quarter, little changed from a 3.4 percent third
quarter increase.
   In a second report, the Commerce Department said U.S.
corporations' after-tax profits rose 1.6 percent in the fourth
quarter, closing out a year in which business profits shot up 8.4
percent, reflecting the boom in export sales that boosted the
fortunes of American manufacturing companies.

   The state Council on the Arts, under fire
for funding homosexual-oriented art projects, espouses freedom of
expression and not points of view, chairwoman Kitty Carlisle Hart
said Wednesday.
   ``The process is like democracy,'' the actress told a joint
legislative committee hearing. ``It may not be perfect, but it's
the best thing we've got.''
   Hart was summoned before the Assembly and Senate arts committees
following a New York Post report last week that the council had
provided $7,200 to help pay for a photographic exhibit on
transvestism sponsored by the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force
Fund for Human Dignity.
   Other council grants went to create an archive on gay and
lesbian writers and to fund a feminist magazine with an emphasis on
writing by lesbians.
   Hart, who complained of being put on the ``hot seat,'' said the
council supports a variety of groups in the name of artistic
expression.
   ``We fund art,'' she said. ``We are neutral as far as anyone
else is concerned. We don't fund anyone's point of view.''
   About 100 spectators watched the hearing, with the majority
applauding lawmakers who defended Hart's viewpoint.
   Assemblyman Philip Healy said the arts council should show
``delicacy and discretion'' in how it spends taxpayers' money. He
said he sees ``an element of propaganda creeping in'' with some of
the programs funded.
   ``To have only one side portrayed on any level, be it the war in
Nicaragua or lesbians, shows a lack of judgment,'' Healy said. ``I
don't know if this was an overt act or a mistake. I hope it's a
mistake.''
   Fellow Republican Assemblyman Frank Talomie said the arts
council should have a greater system of checks and balances to
ensure proper funding decisions.
   ``I think there's a concern regarding the public's best
interests and the taxpayers' dollar ... that we have to go back and
justify to our constituents,'' he said.
   Hart said each funding request is reviewed by the arts council
staff and a ``peer group committee'' before it is approved or
turned down by the 20-member council. Council members are appointed
by the governor and serve without salary.
   Mary Hays, the council's executive director, said the council
funded 3,633 different programs last year from 6,000 requests.
   ``I defy you to find any prejudice or imbalance in what we do,''
she said.

<HEAD>EPA Won't Use Data on Nazi Gas Experiments for Study of Phosgene</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Environmental Protection Agency will not
use data from a Nazi poison-gas experiment on prisoners of war and
will study whether such data should ever be used, an agency
official said Wednesday.
   The decision was prompted by a letter to EPA Administrator Lee
M. Thomas from 20 agency employees, many of them scientists, asking
that the issue be studied and the report in which the data appeared
be put on hold.
   ``We don't need this kind of data,'' was Thomas' response,
according to Craig DeRemer, an assistant to the administrator.
   The gas is phosgene, used as a weapon in World War I and used
today in the production of other chemicals. There is a wealth of
data from animal experiments and other human exposure.
   DeRemer said Thomas was ordering a study of the issue, probably
by the agency's Risk Assessment Forum, an interoffice group that
tries to forge common policies in EPA's programs.
   ``This has not been nailed down yet,'' DeRemer said Wednesday.
   EPA has listed phosgene, which forms hydrochloric acid in the
lungs, among the most toxic 406 chemicals that communities should
consider in disaster planning.
   Small quantities can be deadly since effects may take three or
four hours to appear. The Occupational Safety and Health
Administration permits exposure of only 0.1 part per million over
an eight-hour shift and says 2 ppm represents ``imminent danger to
life or health.''
   The agency is considering whether to add phosgene to the
airborne chemicals it regulates, and as part of that work asked a
consultant to ``validate some computer models,'' DeRemer said. It
was the consultants' report that prompted the letter to Thomas.
   The report of the consultant, ICF-Clement Inc., referred to the
findings of a French military court which tried those responsible
for exposing French prisoners to phosgene, according to one of the
signers of the letter who saw the report, microbiologist Morris
Levin.
   Levin said he believed the consultant found the court report in
its own research, but DeRemer said he understood EPA officials had
called it to the attention of ICF-Clement when they discussed the
work to be performed.
   The ICF-Clement vice president in charge did not immediately
return two telephone calls Wednesday.
   ``Some have suggested that such data, if scientifically sound,
and verifiable, should be used if some `good' to humans can
result,'' the letter to Thomas said. ``Others feel that to use such
data debases us all as a society, gives such experiments legitimacy
and implicitly encourages others, perhaps in less exacting
societies, to perform unethical human `experiments.'''
   His own view, Levin said, had changed in discussions in the
group of 20 from acceptance of use to the belief that such findings
should never be used. The use of radiation data by EPA and others
from the U.S. nuclear bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan, in
1945 is ``not in the same category, but close,'' Levin said.
   The German phosgene results, he said, are ``useless. They had no
proper controls (an untested group used for comparisons) and no
idea what the dose was until halfway through. If anyone had brought
us those results from mice, we would have said, `Do it over.'''

<HEAD>Political Prisoner Freed From Virtual House Arrest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ASUNCION, Paraguay (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former army captain who was
Paraguay's most famed political prisoner fled virtual house arrest
Wednesday with the help of two opposition leaders and sought asylum
in the Colombian Embassy residence.
   Colombian Ambassador Vicente Ramirez Emiliani told The
Associated Press a diplomatic note had been sent to the Paraguayan
foreign ministry advising that Napoleon Ortigoza had taken refuge
in the residence and asked for political asylum.
   ``The Colombian government will proceed to study the
situation,'' he said, adding that he did not know how long that
might take.
   Hermes Rafael Saguier, a leader of the opposition Authentic
Radical Liberal Party, said he and attorney Felino Amarilla went to
see Ortigoza, 56, at the home where he has been held under armed
guard since completing a 25-year prison sentence for his
involvement in a 1962 slaying and an alleged plot against President
Alfredo Stroessner.
   ``At first the guards wouldn't let us in or let Ortigoza out,''
Saguier said by telephone from the embassy residence.
   ``Then we asked Ortigoza if he was prepared to recover his
freedom and he said `yes,' and we forced our way past the guards
and put him in a car and drove him to the residence of the
Colombian ambassador,'' Saguier said.
   ``The last thing we heard were three or four shots,'' Saguier
added. ``I can't tell you for sure because we were too scared to
listen.''
   Saguier said no one was injured.
   The opposition leader, whose party is a frequent critic of the
34-year-old Stroessner government, said the Colombian residence was
chosen because it is only a block and a half from where Ortigoza
was confined.
   Half a dozen armed police blocked the entrance to the embassy
residence.
   Ortigoza was released from an Asuncion prison on Dec. 19 and
confined in a hotel in San Estanislao, 135 miles northeast of
Asuncion. On Feb. 9, he was taken to Asuncion and confined under
guard in a house belonging to his invalid mother.
   Saguier said he and Amarilla decided to remove Ortigoza from the
home after Attorney General Clotildo Jimenez Benitez told reporters
Tuesday that the Ortigoza case was closed and the former captain
was ``in complete freedom.''
   Questioned about the presence of armed guards at the house, the
attorney general said they had been there to protect Ortigoza and
not restrict him.
   Ortigoza was sentenced to 25 years in prison in 1962 after he
confessed to having participated in the slaying of Army cadet
Alberto Benitez. Also convicted in the case was Sgt. Guillermo
Ovando, who was freed in 1984 after spending 21 years behind bars.
   The former captain, who never was allowed to appear in court in
his own defense, maintains his confession was obtained under
torture.
   Paraguayan human rights leaders have said Ortigoza's
imprisonment was meant by the government to serve as a lesson to
those who might conspire against Stroessner's authoritarian rule.

   The police van's megaphone issued a strange
warning to the crowd of over 100 people hovering around the
Manhattan exit from the Queens Midtown Tunnel early Wednesday.
   ``Do yourself a favor and don't touch the cages.''
   Up from under the river came Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey
Circus' annual three-mile parade of animals as the big top moved
into Madison Square Garden for a six-week run.
   The caged lions and tigers came first, 14 of them in two strands
of cages linked together and pulled by trucks.
   ``Living things in Manhattan that are not people, and are not
cockroaches!'' yelled Amy Slaton, a 30-year-old art critic. ``This
is the happiest night of my life.''
   The crowd roared as the 19 elephants walked out of the tunnel.
The cry went up, ``Wooo-oooo! Elephants! Elephants! Aaaall Right!''
   Richard Dunne, a 37-year-old lawyer from Baltimore, bought his
seat atop one of the elephants in a charity auction.
   ``It was like a gigantic horse,'' Dunne said. ``It's so fresh
for New York. Everyone is smiling and happy, even the cops were
happy.''
   After the elephants came 15 horses, five zebras and six camels.
   Inevitably, the rear was brought up by a Department of
Sanitation street sweeper.

   A former New Yorker living here was astonished
when a Denver policeman showed up at his front door, apologized and
ripped up a four-point traffic citation he had issued just a day
earlier.
   ``In New York, this just doesn't happen. I couldn't believe
it,'' said Joe Milotta, 34.
   But the action by Patrolman Glen Miller, an eight-year veteran,
didn't surprise Deputy Chief Cliff Stanley.
   ``He has, on more than one occasion, admitted his mistakes,''
Stanley said. ``Police officers are human and we do admit our
mistakes. In fact, we encourage it.''
   Miller said he mistook Milotta's car for a similar vehicle that
used an emergeny lane to avoid morning rush-hour traffic on March 9.

   Rush County farmer Andy Ariens has a
built-in barometer so accurate it has earned him a countywide
reputation as an ace weather prognosticator.
   ``I told Trudy before we got married, `Now, there's something
you need to understand about me,''' said Ariens, 56. `` `Whenever
there's a storm on the way, I'll go off to bed and I'll just sleep
right through it. I may sleep all afternoon and all night long if
you let me.'''
   Ariens also reads the winds and watches the behavior of animals
and insects to predict Mother Nature's plans. He said if he sees an
ant cover its hole or if cows refuse to graze, he knows it is going
to rain.
   Neighbors say Ariens has a 90 percent accuracy rate. He
correctly predicted the ice storm that coated central Indiana March
3.
   So what's his forecast?
   ``In two weeks, we'll have above-normal temperatures, say around
the first of April,'' Ariens said recently. ``It'll be a wetter
spring than last year, so planting season should be a little
later.''
   The last two weeks of spring will be quite cool with below
normal temperatures, he added.

   The men wore firefighting gear, and a fire
truck was parked on the street, but the ``firefighters'' served a
search warrant and made an arrest on drug charges.
   The men were deputies disguised to trick occupants of the house
into opening the door. It worked, but it made fire officials angry.
   Orange County Fire Chief John Hunt said he didn't know one of
his subordinates had lent the truck, and he said he would not
permit a recurrence.
   ``People could become suspicious that firefighters are really
police, and real firefighters could come under fire,'' he said.
   And Hunt's boss, Deputy County Administrator Phil Brown, said
Tuesday that nobody told the deputy sheriffs they could use the
coats, hats and boots firefighters wear.
   Police officials disagreed.
   ``We're not at all upset about the way we did this. We got two
stolen guns and some drugs off the street,'' said sheriff's
spokesman Randy Means.
   ``I don't think there is any threat to firefighter safety,''
said Sheriff's Sgt. Mike Foreman. ``This was the safest way to
execute the search warrant. It involved us not having to make any
forced entry.''
   The head of the 427-member firefighters' union, Jerry Polk, said
he wouldn't object in some situations, such as those involving
hostages.
   ``Let's say there was a kid in there and the police needed a
decoy to get in. That is within the realm of reasonable judgment,''
Polk said. ``But going into the criminal community is a daily
occurrence the police world deals with. To intermingle the fire
department, which has no protection, well, that's not a very smart
move.''
   Deputies arrested Sammie Battle, 66, on a charge of possession
of cocaine. They said they found less than a fifth of an ounce of
rock cocaine. Also seized were two stolen guns. Battle was released
on bond.

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev called for greater freedom
for collective farmers and other cooperatives Wednesday to
rejuvenate the Soviet Union's struggling agricultural sector and
enable the nation to feed itself.
   Gorbachev called the possibilities of cooperatives a ``brilliant
discovery'' of Soviet founder Vladimir I. Lenin that had been
underused, and even despised, by subsequent rulers.
   ``We should revive co-ops not in their old, often too-primitive
forms, but in the form of a modern, high-standard cooperative
movement extensively integrated ... with government-run enterprises
and organizations,'' he said, speaking at the first national
congress of collective farmers to be held since 1969.
   The Soviet leader's remarks opening the three-day session in the
Kremlin were carried by the official Tass news agency and broadcast
on state-run TV.
   Collective farms, where members of a cooperative jointly own
farm buildings and machinery and share in earnings, have faded in
recent decades in favor of state farms, where workers, like
employees in a factory, have traditionally received a basic wage.
   There were 33,000 collective farms, or ``kolkhozes,'' in the
Soviet Union in 1970, but their number dropped to 26,300 by 1986.
In that same period, the number of collective farmers dropped from
16.7 million to 12.6 million.
   Gorbachev has been striving to persuade Soviets to enter into
cooperative ventures to make up for shortages in the state-run
economy. Under reforms instituted last year, nearly 14,000
cooperatives have sprung up to offer restaurant services, pump gas,
make clothes and provide other goods and services in short supply.
   Starting in the late 1920s, when Josef V. Stalin was Soviet
leader, cooperatives were liquidated and kolkhozes were transformed
into state-owned farms. A taste for giant state-run enterprises was
accompanied by bans on private farm plots, Gorbachev said.
   ``The consequences of such an attitude to kolkhozes, to
cooperatives as a whole, are well-known,'' he said. ``To it must be
laid the delayed solution of the food problem, the deficit and
narrowness of an assortment of many consumer goods, the limited
nature of the service sector.''
   Soviet agriculture has been plagued for decades by central
planners who tell farms what and how much to plant, lack of
incentives for farmers to work the state-owned land, inefficient
production, and poor storage and transportation facilities.
   Gorbachev said grain harvests, meat production and milk supplies
are improving, but the Soviet Union still is forced to spend
millions of dollars of its hard currency every year for imported
grain.
   A wider role for kolkhozes and co-op ventures should help the
country become self-sufficient in foodstuffs, Gorbachev said.
   ``By breeding the feeling of ownership, initiative and
enterprise, co-ops are able to render substantial help in solving
the food problem, in increasing the output of good-quality consumer
goods,'' Gorbachev said.
   To define the widened prerogatives and responsibilities now
envisioned for cooperatives, a draft law was published this month
in the press that prohibits government interference in their
affairs.
   Gorbachev said the new law aims to ``ensure the enhancement and
development of cooperative and collective-farm property (and)
create legal machinery to protect cooperative democracy.''
   He said, however, that the land farmed by kolkhoz members would
continue to belong to the state. The law also foresees a
progressive tax system to catch what Gorbachev has called
``money-grabbing.''
   His re-emphasis on cooperatives is a result of greater democracy
in Soviet society and ``an important lever for furthering the
democratic process and combatting administration by fiat and red
tape,'' he said.
   Gorbachev, the son of a south Russian peasant, was the Communist
Party official responsible for agriculture before becoming the
party's general secretary in March 1985.
   He said it was essential to increase the growth rate of grain
harvests by at least 50 percent and to begin harvesting from 260
million to 280 million tons of grain annually under the next
five-year economic plan, in 1990-95.
   Grain harvests for the past two years have been about 210
million tons, well above figures for the previous several years but
below the government targets of about 240 million tons, which
Western experts regard as unrealistic.
   He also stressed the importance of the small individual plots
whose produce Soviet farmers are allowed to sell for themselves,
and called for steps to help people manage them.
   Gorbachev said the ruling Politburo had decided to hold a
special meeting of the Central Committee, the party's policy-making
body, to consider national agricultural policy.
   Reforms enacted last year permit the farms to sell directly to
shops and restaurants up to 30 percent of the fruits and vegetables
planners require them to produce. Excess production can be sold at
farmers' markets, where prices are not controlled, or to state
stores.

<NOTE>EDs: SUBS 2nd graf pvs, bgng, `Dukakis flew,' with 4 grafs to
UPDATE with Bradley endorsement, comments from senator and Dukakis.</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis, fighting to establish himself as the Democratic
presidential front-runner, picked up a key endorsement Wednesday
but also came under fire from rival Richard Gephardt for his trade
views and from Republican Bob Dole for a ``failure of vision'' on
foreign policy.
   New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley, once mentioned as a possible
candidate for the Democratic nomination, announced his support for
Dukakis at an old railroad terminal in Jersey City, N.J.
   ``Among the candidates of both parties, he would make the best
president. And among the Democratic candidates he is the one who
can beat George Bush,'' Bradley said with the candidate by his side.
   The senator said Dukakis can defeat the vice president in
November ``because he is tenacious, innovative, resilient and
disciplined.''
   Dukakis, who is expected to draw strong support in the state's
June 7 primary election with the endorsement, called Bradley's
decision ``a very important endorsement because it comes from one
of the most respected and one of the most accomplished public
figures in America today.''
   Dole, setting aside his attacks on Republican rival George Bush,
focused on the Democrats in general and Dukakis in particular in a
foreign policy speech at the Center for Strategic and International
Studies in Washington.
   After the speech, Dole flew to Hartford, Conn., to address the
state legislature, but before he landed, top Connecticut GOP
officials announced their backing of Bush for the presidential
nomination.
   Bush and Dukakis were heavily favored to win most of the
delegates at stake next Tuesday when Connecticut holds its
presidential primary.
   In his Washington speech, Dole said Dukakis ``says that the
Monroe Doctrine, which has defined America's security in its own
neighborhood for some 200 years, is `obsolete.' He said this
country ... has no choice but to tolerate the existence of Soviet
client states wherever subversion might install them.''
   The Kansas senator went on to say that ``what we see on
Democratic side of this presidential campaign is a failure of nerve
as well as a failure of vision.''
   Michigan, which holds Democratic caucuses on Saturday, was the
next major battleground for Dukakis and his rivals, and Gephardt
was hammering away at the Massachusetts governor for allegedly
waffling on trade.
   The Gephardt campaign produced a sheaf of Dukakis quotes
opposing trade legislation and used them to support the Missouri
congressman's contention that Dukakis' support for Senate trade
legislation was a ``political ploy'' to win workers' votes in
Michigan.
   ``The president of the United States today has all the authority
he needs to do something about those unfair trade practices,''
Gephardt quoted Dukakis as saying during a debate last August in
Iowa. ``We don't need more laws or more amendments.''
   Campaigning in Michigan, Gephardt asked, ``Who is for a tough
trade policy? Who is going to be for a tough trade policy after
Michigan? Dick Gephardt is. ... Mike Dukakis hasn't been, isn't and
won't be.''
   The Dukakis campaign produced a tape-recorded interview in which
Dukakis praised the Senate trade measure as long ago as last year.
   ``I think the Senate bill, which is very, very different from
the Gephardt amendment, is sound policy. I would have voted for
it,'' the governor told the Des Moines Register on July 11.
   A new Michigan poll commissioned by Detroit television station
WJBK said Dukakis was leading in the state with 35 percent support.
Jesse Jackson had 29 percent; Gephardt 17 percent; Sen. Albert Gore
Jr. 6 percent and Sen. Paul Simon 5 percent, with 9 percent
undecided.
   Connecticut GOP State Chairman Robert S. Poliner announced his
support for Bush, saying, ``Among Republicans I believe George Bush
has the best chance of winning the presidency in 1988.''
   ``I'm sure that a Connecticut ticket led by George Bush and
(U.S. Sen.) Lowell Weicker will be strongly supported by many
independents and Democrats as well as most Republicans, and will
give Connecticut Republicans a chance to increase our numbers in
Congress and in the state legislature,'' Poliner added, predicting
that Bush would take 25 of the 35 Connecticut delegates at stake in
next week's primary.
   A poll published Wednesday by The Hartford Courant showed Bush
favored by 64 percent of likely GOP voters, while his nearest
rival, Dole, is the choice of 20 percent. The margin of error for
the random sampling of 432 likely Republican voters was 5.5 percent.
   Gore also talked about trade as he toured a giant iron ore
processing plant in Ishpeming, Mich. and said, ``We have to take
steps to remove unfair trade barriers overseas.''
   In London, Democrats living overseas picked a largely
uncommitted delegation to the party's national convention. Dukakis,
who won a non-binding preference poll, picked up a fraction of a
delegate.
   Democrats Abroad send 22 delegates to the convention, where they
will cast nine votes. Nine of those delegates were uncommitted, one
was backing Dukakis.

   Corporations' after-tax profits shot up 8.4
percent in 1987, the best performance in three years, as American
manufacturers benefited from the weaker dollar, the government
reported Wednesday.
   The Commerce Department said after-tax profits rose to $137.4
billion last year, the first increase since a 12 percent rise in
1984.
   In 1985, corporate profits plunged 12.3 percent and they dipped
another 1 percent in 1986 as the widening trade deficit cut into
sales by American manufacturing firms.
   U.S. companies have been enjoying an export boom this past year
as declines in the dollar made American products competitive again
on overseas markets.
   ``For U.S. manufacturing, 1987 was a turnaround year. Exports
rose and American companies benefited tremendously from previous
cost-cutting measures,'' said Allen Sinai, chief economist for The
Boston Co.
   Analysts said the rise in profits was particularly significant
because it occurred at the same time corporate taxes were being
boosted substantially by the landmark 1986 tax overhaul law.
   Sinai predicted further gains in corporate profits in 1988,
estimating they should rise by between 6 percent and 7 percent.
   ``We will see continued increases in corporate profits until the
start of the next recession,'' he said.
   The report said the dividends corporations paid to stockholders
rose along with their improved profit picture, increasing 8.1
percent to $93.8 billion. This followed a 6.8 percent increase in
dividends paid out in 1986.
   For the fourth quarter, after-tax profits rose 1.6 percent at a
quarterly rate following a 5.5 percent increase in the third
quarter.

<HEAD>Businesses Say Federal Agencies Too Slow Paying Their Bills</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT M. ANDREWS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Corporate leaders on Wednesday described the
nightmares of doing business with federal agencies that refuse to
pay their bills on time, and pleaded with Congress to crack down on
Washington's bureaucratic deadbeats.
   ``Small businesses cannot afford to carry any customer for an
indefinite period of time, even if it is the U.S. government,''
Joseph A. Schaedel of the National Federation of Independent
Business told a House hearing.
   Kenton Pattie of the International Communications Industries
Association said the Defense Department was more than 19 months
late paying its $1,424.15 bill to a small Virginia supplier, and
didn't pay the delinquent penalty required by law.
   Worse, he said, an Alabama company waited nearly two years
before the Air Force paid the $8,833 due for some playground
equipment, after Sen. Howell Heflin, D-Ala., was enlisted to exert
pressure.
   When the Air Force check finally arrived, the company was
cheated out of $648.21 in interest penalties.
   One contractor, frustrated after waiting three months for the
Navy to pay for a shipment of steel pipe, drove a truck to the main
gate at the Philadelphia naval shipyard and told guards: ``We want
it back!'' The Navy returned the goods, Pattie said.
   An August 1986 report by the General Accounting Office, the
investigative arm of Congress, estimated that 24 percent of all
federal agency bills were unpaid for more than 30 days.
   Members of a House Government Operations subcommittee listened
sympathetically as other legislators and witnesses for small
businesses, industrial contractors and trade associations urged
Congress to close loopholes in the 1982 Prompt Payment Act, which
requires the federal government to pay its bills within 30 days.
   The witnesses endorsed amendments, which the Senate approved
unanimously last October, that would provide a stricter statutory
definition of when a federal agency receives an invoice, which
triggers the 30-day time clock for payment.
   The Senate bill also would set a five-day limit for an agency to
accept or reject a supplier's goods or services; eliminate a 15-day
grace period for payment of late penalties; require automatic
payment of penalties with a double penalty if not paid within 10
days; and prohibit agencies from taking an early-payment discount
after payment is due.
   Raymond S. Wittig of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce said the
government's late payment of bills causes the most damage to small
businesses, which lack large capital funds and depend heavily on
cash flow to finance their operations.
   ``They often do not have the resources to battle the federal
bureaucracy over late or incorrect payments,'' Wittig said. ``As a
result, small businesses concentrate on selling to customers who
pay on time.''
   He added: ``If the government does not pay on time, all
taxpayers and citizens are injured because fewer businesses choose
to sell to the government. This decreased competition raises the
costs of goods and services purchased by the government.''

Recipients

   Scientists have triggered
disease-fighting defenses in bone marrow transplant recipients with
an experimental procedure, a scientist said Wednesday.
   The recipients had their immune system defenses raised against
poisons that are produced by tetanus and diphtheria bacteria,
showing they benefited from vaccines given marrow donors a week
before the marrow was harvested, said Albert Donnenberg of Johns
Hopkins University in Baltimore.
   Those diseases are not particular problems in marrow recipients,
but the experiment suggests that a similar process might one day
protect against potentially lethal fungal and viral infections that
do appear in recipients, he said.
   Recipients had to be immunized within 35 days of their marrow
transplants, or else the transferred immunity was lost, he said.
   Donnenberg described results to science writers at a seminar
sponsored by the American Cancer Society.
   Marrow transplants are performed in cases where radiation or
chemotherapy for cancer is powerful enough to destroy a patient's
own marrow. Bone marrow produces the white blood cells of the
immune system, as well as red blood cells and platelets.
   The experiment included 38 recipients who got marrow from
immunized donors that was then treated with a technique designed to
prevent graft-versus-host disease. This is a potentially fatal
complication in which immune system cells from transplanted marrow
attack the recipient's body.
   The technique uses a centrifuge to strip the marrow of about 99
percent of the white blood cells called lymphocytes that cause
graft-versus-host disease.
   The experiment, designed to look for side effects rather than
effectiveness, found the technique did little to reduce the
incidence of the disease. But it did appear to reduce the number of
moderate to severe cases in comparison to standard experience with
non-treated marrow, Donnenberg said.
   The transfer of vaccine effects from donor to recipient occurred
because the processing of the marrow enriched it, in the
lymphocytes remaining, with a ``memory'' for the vaccine,
Donnenberg said.
   Such transfer has been shown before, said David Golde, chief of
hematology and oncology at the University of California, Los
Angeles, School of Medicine.
   A key research problem now is how to retain some
disease-fighting capability in marrow recipients but not enough to
trigger graft-versus-host disease, he said in a telephone interview.
   Another study reported at the meeting found that cancer patients
whose marrow had been destroyed by therapy regained marrow function
after injections of their own blood cells.
   Such injections may allow aggressive cancer treatment in
patients who cannot get marrow transplants or store some of their
own marrow for use after cancer treatment, said Margaret Kessinger
of the University of Nebraska College of Medicine in Omaha.
   Marrow transplant experts said the technique's near-term
usefulness would be limited, but that it may have potential for
wider use.
   Kessinger said the experimental technique begins with extracting
white blood cells from a patient's blood.
   The goal is to harvest a kind of cell called the pluripotent
stem cell, which essentially replaces lost bone marrow.
   Kessinger described a study of 26 patients who went through that
procedure and received the injections of blood cells, rather than
marrow, after cancer therapy.
   In comparison to 83 patients whose marrow had been harvested by
conventional means and later returned, the experimental group first
showed white cells in the blood three days sooner, for an average
of eight days after the procedure, she said.
   Both groups took the same amount of time to recover other marrow
function, she said.

   The world's only coon dog graveyard
may need the help of some patrol hounds to keep vandals at bay.
   Caretakers of the Key Underwood Coon Dog Memorial Graveyard in
northwest Alabama say vandals have damaged the unique tombstones
and littered the tourist attraction with beer and soda cans, the
Florence TimesDaily reported Sunday.
   ``It used to happen just once in a while,'' William O. Bolton of
Russellville, secretary-treasurer of the Tennessee Valley Coon
Hunters Association, told the newspaper. ``But it's been happening
more frequently lately.''
   Underwood started the graveyard when he buried his coon dog
Troop on the 10-acre site in 1937. Many of the graves are marked
with elaborate epitaphs, stones with statues of dogs or wooden
crosses.
   ``I just think some people are jealous for some reason,'' said
Bolton. ``I think they go out there and drink beer and smoke pot,
and I guess they want to do something bad before they leave.''
   Erecting a tall fence around the graveyard, as some people have
suggested, is not a solution because it would discourage visitors,
he said.

   The Kremlin on Wednesday rejected demands by
Armenians who want to control an area of neighboring Azerbaijan,
and it threatened to crack down on Armenian activists who cause
further ethnic unrest.
   The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, the country's highest
executive body, did not directly address Armenian demands to annex
the Nagorno-Karabakh region of Azerbaijan. But it made it clear
that the government would not bend to pressure to change internal
borders.
   At least 32 people were killed in riots after Armenians demanded
that the predominantly Armenian section of Azerbaijan be united
with Armenia. Aremenians are mostly Christian while the Azeris are
mostly Moslem.
   In what appeared to be the Soviet Union's definitive statement
on the territorial dispute, the Presidium ordered government
ministries to make efforts to improve ``the economic, social and
cultural development of the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Region.''
   Armenian activists have said such efforts would not meet their
demands.
   The meeting, attended by Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev,
President Andrei A. Gromyko and other senior officials, was held
after carefully orchestrated appeals by 13 Soviet other republics.
   A statement carried by the Tass news agency said it was
``intolerable'' to use pressure to ``resolve complicated
national-territorial issues.''
   Such actions can lead to ``unpredictable consequences,'' Tass
said.
   Armenians held a series of large protests in February to demand
that Nagorno-Karabakh, which is three-quarters Armenian, be annexed
from Azerbaijan. Ethnic rioting broke out in the Azerbaijani city
of Sumgait on Feb. 28, and officials said 32 people were killed.
   Armenian activists put the death toll at 78 Armenians, killed by
Azerbaijanis. Most Armenians are Christian, while Azerbaijanis are
predominantly Shiite Moslem.
   The Soviet officials condemned violence that caused loss of life
and also called on Armenian and Azerbaijani officials to ``bring to
strict account those who by their actions destabilize the
situation.''
   That statement appeared to indicate an impending crackdown on
Armenian activists and on those arrested for taking part in
violence.
   In early February, the policy-making Communist Party Central
Committee turned down an appeal by Armenians to annex
Nagorno-Karabakh. But Gorbachev promised in a Feb. 26 speech that
the region's problems would be considered when the Central
Committee meets to discuss problems between the Soviet Union's
nationalities.
   As recently as March 17, Communist Party officials in
Nagorno-Karabakh appealed for permission to join the Armenian
republic.
   Before the government's decision Wednesday, Armenian activists
had been planning a meeting for March 26 to determine their course
of action.
   Wednesday's pronouncement was seen as an attempt to discourage
further protests.
   The Presidium said Armenian and Azerbaijani officials must speak
out against any ``nationalistic or extremist manifestation,''
protect the rights of citizens of all nationalities. It ordered
Armenia, Azerbaijan, the national prosecutor's office and the
Interior Ministry to ensure order.
   The Soviet leadership also demanded that Armenian and
Azerbaijani officials drastically improve their political and
education work to ensure that riots do not happen again.
   The Presidium's pronouncement came at a time when the official
press had started to sharply criticize Armenian activists.
   The activists said 7,000 people turned out in Yerevan on Monday
to protest an article by the Communist Party daily newspaper Pravda
that said the annexation campaign had a ``clear anti-socialist
spirit.''
   Y. Arakyelan, an Armenian correspondent whose name was one of
three attached to the article, later disassociated himself from it.
   At a news conference sponsored by the Soviet Foreign Ministry,
Yulian Bromley, director of the Soviet Union's Institute of Ethnic
Studies, indicated that top government and party officials soon
would establish an apparatus for handling differences between
Soviet republics after many years of pretending they did not exist.
   But he and the institute's deputy director, Solomon Bruk, said
transferring territory from one republic to another would not help
Gorbachev's effort to restructure Soviet society. Bruk said
economic development rather than ethnic differences would be a more
likely reason for any changes in internal borders.
   Earlier Wednesday Moscow authorities sent home an Armenian
activist who had been providing foreign journalists with
information about the unrest.
   Alexander Ogorodnikov, a Moscow religious activist, said Paryur
Arikyan was put on a plane for Yerevan, the Armenian capital.

   While the Sandinistas and Contras worked
Wednesday on a cease-fire and journalists waited for scraps of
information, the sleepy village of Sapoa stayed sleepy.
   Tight security segregated the international press corps of about
150 journalists and most the 2,000 residents of this town about 90
miles from Managua on the Costa Rican border.
   The delegations met in the main customs house at the border
crossing, the only building big enough for the talks.
   Covering the negotiations, which began Monday, has meant hours
of waiting punctuated by frenzied activity. Whenever negotiators
leave the customs house, cross the blacktop road and mount a
makeshift stage, photographers shove and push for position as
writers grab for pens and notebooks.
   Otherwise, the press waits in the constant wind blowing off Lake
Managua, said to harbor the world's only freshwater sharks.
   Some reporters meandered down to the lake. Others went to San
Juan del Sur to work on their tans. One slept in a hammock tied to
a utility pole.
   But most passed the time chatting, reading, writing or sipping
beer bought with U.S. dollars, Costa Rican colones or Nicaraguan
cordobas from a snack bar the government set up in a storage room.
   Another room held the phones for international calls the
government had installed for the talks. Payment _ in U.S. dollars _
had to be on the spot.

   The Contra delegation is staying in Liberia, Costa Rica, about
37 miles miles away.
   They arrive each day in a pale green schoolbus with smoked
windows accompanied by Costa Rican and Sandinista security agents
and with Contra fighters in U.S.-made fatigues flanking the leader
of the delegation, Alfredo Cesar.
   Nicaragua's state-run Radio Sandino, which is heard here, refers
to the Contras as the ``delegation of the U.S. government.'' Radio
Impacto, a U.S.-financed station in Costa Rica that broadcasts the
Contra point of view, can also be picked up in Sapoa.
   The Sandinista delegation, headed by Defense Minister Humberto
Ortega, arrives in four-wheel drive vehicles with motorcycle
escorts. The Sandinistas are staying in San Juan del Sur, a beach
town on the Pacific Ocean about 10 miles away.
   One report said phone lines there were cut as a security measure.

   Sandinista security has been tight along the PanAmerican
Highway, but the border crossing itself has stayed open throughout
the talks.
   Journalists are searched by state security agents and issued
credentials each day at a site about a mile away, then bused to the
scene of the talks, a complex of customs buildings next to the
village.
   Most of the area is closed to reporters, roped off by security
agents. The governnment set up a covered press area outdoors,
across a road from the customs house.

<TEXT>
   Japan and the NATO allies are doing more to
ensure the free world's security than they get credit for, but the
administration will continue to press them to assume a larger share
of the burden, Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci said Wednesday.
   In a 14-page report requested by Congress, Carlucci said, ``I
intend to follow up personally on this issue and to reiterate at
every opportunity the need for progress in improving both allied
defense capabilities and the equity with which the roles, risks and
burdens of the alliance are shared.''
   Carlucci, while promising a more extensive report later this
spring, said it appeared that Japan and eight European countries
might have increased their defense spending by 3 percent or more in
1987 _ matching the NATO goal.
   He identified the eight as Greece, Italy, Luxembourg, Norway,
Spain, Turkey, France and Portugal.
   Only Greece, however, appears to be allocating as much of its
gross national product to defense as the United States ``and there
are substantial variations in the performance among the individual
allies,'' Carlucci wrote.
   ``While some are doing at least their fair share, others are
making a contribution that can best be characterized as mixed, and
a few are doing far less than their fair share,'' he continued.
   ``Progress to date has likewise been mixed, with the good
performers generally making the greatest improvements in their
defense postures while the others fall further behind.''

   Former South Korean President Chun Doo Hwan
paid a 30-minute courtesy call Wednesday on President Reagan at the
White House.
   According to a Korean official, both men laughed as Chun
suggested that after Reagan leaves the White House early next year,
they meet again to discuss life in retirement. Reagan accepted,
said the official, who asked not to be named.
   The two men also discussed the transition to democracy in South
Korea and the upcoming Olympic games in Seoul.
   Reagan noted that Korea's economic development was strengthened
during Chun's time in office and that his efforts contributed to
the organization of the Olympics, the official said.
   Chun arrived here Tuesday and will be leaving the United States
on April 10. He will be traveling to New York, where he plans to
meet with former President Nixon and former Secretary of State

   An Iranian delegate said Wednesday the
Palestinians in Israel's occupied territories should emulate Iran's
Islamic revolution and destroy their enemy.
   Mohammed Ali Taskhiri addressed a conference of the 46-member
Organization of Islamic Conference, which has issued a statement
about the Palestinian rebellion but is is not expected to make
headway toward a truce in the Iran-Iraq war. The Persian Gulf
neighbors have been fighting since September 1980.
   Taskhiri cited the revolution of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini
against the pro-U.S. regime of the late Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi,
which he called a ``nest of evil.'' The shah was ousted in February
1979.
   ``Our children faced it like the children who are throwing
stones in Palestine, who are facing the enemy with his American
weapons,'' Taskhiri said.
   ``The Zionist enemy is killing our children, is burning their
bodies and breaking their arms and burying them alive,'' he said of
the rebellion in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, which began
Dec. 8. More than 100 Arabs have been killed.
   ``Palestine is a Moslem issue,'' he said. ``It is the main
issue, but we haven't done anything about it yet except talk about
it.''
   His reference was to a statement issued by the delegates Tuesday
that condemned Israel's ``oppressive and criminal'' measures and
advocated political and financial support for the protesters.
   It did not say what form the aid should take or whether it would
be forthcoming.
   Iran claims the rebellion is inspired by Islam, but observers
say opposition to Israeli occupation is the chief motivation.

<DATELINE>HUECO TANKS STATE HISTORICAL PARK, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Authorities have
reopened Hueco Tanks to rock climbers, ending a three-week
moratorium that gave rangers time to remove bolts climbers hammered
into the rock to aid tricky maneuvers.
   Park officials had feared the bolts might have destroyed ancient
Indian rock paintings, but said they found no damage.
   Hours after the moratorium was lifted Friday, park rangers were
fielding calls from as far as Europe.
   ``Hueco Tanks is one of two good winter-climbing spots in the
United States,'' David Cottom, spokesman for the Texas Parks and
Wildlife Department, said Wednesday. ``The world climbing community
is tight-knit; you wouldn't believe how fast word gets around.''
   Officials closed the 860-acre park about 35 miles east of El
Paso to climbers after rangers discovered the steel bolts they said
had been placed mostly by European visitors. Some climbers had even
used epoxy to create handholds and footholds on the sheer rock
faces.
   Climbers often embed bolts into rock to secure safety ropes.
Most climbers use bolts only to halt falls and consider it cheating
to use them as handholds or footholds.
   ``A lot of (bolts) are for safety, but these aren't for
safety,'' said Ranger Bob Parker, pointing at three bolts in the
face of a 30-foot-high boulder. ``Bolts like these are for
acrobatics. That's what we disagree with.''
   Rangers removed 23 bolts and epoxy handholds, and filled the
holes with brown epoxy to blend in with the rock, Parker said.
   Drilling bolts is banned at Hueco Tanks, though rangers have
decided to leave bolts necessary for safety on the many established
routes.
   And park officials plan to call a conference of climbers next
month or next winter to discuss the ethics of bolting _ a hot topic
in climbing circles.
   Parker said he hoped the moratorium and the conference will get
climbers to police themselves and report illegal bolting.
   Park officials want to make sure everyone follows the rules
because the sport is growing fast at Hueco Tanks, Cottom said.
Several hundred climbers from the Americas, Europe and Asia
traveled to Hueco Tanks this winter. A few years ago, most of the
park's climbers were from Texas and New Mexico.
   Hueco Tanks and Joshua Tree National Monument, east of Los
Angeles, are the most popular North American winter climbing sites.

   A judge sentenced 10 people to death by
hanging for murdering a left-wing politician and his son three
years ago, news reports said Wednesday.
   Judge Kazi Golam Rasul passed the sentence at Narail, 60 miles
west of Dhaka, on Tuesday.
   The convicts, who will be hanged unless they appeal to higher
court, were found guilty of killing Eklasuddin Ahmed and his
22-year-old son, Tutu, in June 1985.
   Ahmed was a local leader of a left-wing BAKSAL party.
   A spokesman for the BAKSAL party said in Dhaka on Wednesday that
the convicts were former supporters of the governing Jatiya Party.
   Spokesman Abdur Razzak said that the killing of Ahmed was
politically motivated to eliminate rivals.

<TEXT>
   An assistant state prosecutor has been
suspended with pay following claims that she led police on a 90-mph
car chase and was naked from the waist down when stopped.
   Assistant State Attorney Jan Bamping, 32, was charged with
fleeing to elude an officer and improper passing, both
misdemeanors, the Bradenton Herald reported Wednesday.
   Police reports cited by the Herald said Bradenton Beach
Patrolman Ron Robertson stopped Bamping and fellow Assistant State
Attorney Jerry Blevins, 27, a passenger in the car and owner of the
vehicle, at about 1:45 a.m. Sunday after a 1{-mile chase.
   Robertson said Bamping had been drinking, but he didn't order
her from the car to take a roadside sobriety test because she was
naked from the waist down. He said he could see she had ``a tattoo
on the inside of her leg.''
   Robertson said that when he asked Ms. Bamping why she was
partially nude, she became upset and answered that it's ``not
against the law to drive nude.''
   Ms. Bamping could not be reached by phone Wednesday for comment.
   Blevins was fully clothed, Robertson said. He was not charged
and the Herald reported there was no indication he was disciplined.
   Police reports also said Ms. Bamping and Blevins tried to use
their positions as prosecutors to intimidate Robertson, but Blevins
denied that.
   ``I don't think we did anything improper as far as using this
office,'' Blevins told the Herald.
   Chief Assistant State Atorney Mack Futch said he will request
that Gov. Bob Martinez appoint a special prosecutor to handle Ms.
Bamping's case.
   Ms. Bamping was scheduled to appear in traffic court May 11.

   Israeli fighter-bombers blasted
Palestinian and Moslem guerrilla bases on the outskirts of Sidon on
Wednesday, destroying at least six in Israel's second
anti-guerrilla air strike in a week.
   Police said four Skyhawks and eight Phantom F-4s roared in at
4:05 p.m. and staged eight dive-bombing and rocketing runs in a
one-hour raid.
   At least five bases manned by guerrillas of terrorist mastermind
Abu Nidal's Fatah-Revolutionary Council went up in flames in the
villages of Bekesta, Majdelyoun and Salhiyeh near Sidon's Ein
el-Hilweh refugee camp, police said.
   One rocket struck a guerrilla arms depot in Bekesta, setting off
a two-hour chain of ammunition explosions that demolished the
building, police said.
   In a military communique Fatah-Revolutionary Council claimed the
jets raided only ``one of the organization's positions.'' It vowed
to ``severely strike back against the Zionist enemy's arrogance and
barbarism ... at the adequate time and venue.''
   ``The attacks left a number of our heroic fighters martyred or
wounded. We will announce specific figures in a later communique,''
the statement said. ``This crime will be added to the black record
of the Zionist enemy.''
   A base of the Moscow-oriented Democratic Front for the
Liberation of Palestine also was destroyed as the jets fired 25
rockets and dozens of delayed-action bombs in the area, police
reported.
   They said the warplanes also hit Sidon's power plant, plunging
the city into darkness. Sidon residents watched the raid from
balconies.
   Guerrillas cordoned off the stricken targets after the raid,
preventing police and reporters from getting a casualty figure.
However, police said two boys aged five and 10 were rushed to
Sidon's Hammoud hospital from Bekesta.
   Israel Radio's Hebrew broadcast said explosions in Sidon
prevented Red Cross vehicles from reaching the bombed areas. It
said residents of Sidon and its Palestinian refugee camps closed
their stores and rushed in panic to bomb shelters.
   A communique from the Democratic Front for the Liberation of
Palestine said an unspecified number of Lebanese civilians were
injured in the raid.
   ``The escalation of the enemy's aggression reflects the
deepening crisis engulfing Israel as a result of the continuous
Palestinian uprising in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip,''
said the communique, released in Beirut.
   It described the raid as ``the first fruit'' of Israeli Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir's recent visit to Washington.
   The Israeli command said its planes destroyed buildings used by
guerrillas for storing military hardware and vehicles.
   Police said Israeli gunboats cruised off Sidon, 25 miles south
of Beirut, during and after the raid. It was Israel's fourth into
Lebanon this year.
   The Israelis said all planes returned safely to their bases and
that the pilots reported accurate hits.
   Sidon police said the Israeli pilots released air balloons that
deflected waves of heat-seeking SAM-7 missiles shoulder-fired by
guerrillas.
   A communique issued by the Popular Liberation Army militia of
Sidon's Sunni Moslem Nasserite leader, Mustafa Saad, said its
positions east of the city were also hit by the Israeli jets.
   It charged the air attack was aimed at breaking the
``Lebanese-Palestinian nationalist alliance.''
   Saad's militia, which has controlled Sidon since the 1975
outbreak of Lebanon's civil war, has been allied with Yasser
Arafat's Palestine Liberation Organization and maintained close
ties with Abu Nidal's group, which opposes Arafat.
   Thirty-one people were killed and 43 wounded in the previous
Israeli air raids on Lebanon this year.

<HEAD>Court Urged To Allow State Regulations On Fund-Raising</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court was urged Wednesday to allow
states to place strict new regulations on professional
organizations that solicit contributions for charities.
   Attorney General Lacy H. Thornburg of North Carolina said the
rules his state seeks to impose would not violate free-speech
rights.
   Professional fund-raisers ``are keeping too much'' of the money,
he said. ``We want it to go back to the charities.''
   But charitable groups said if the North Carolina plan were
adopted nationwide it would severely threaten their ability to
raise money.
   The North Carolina regulations, invalidated by a lower court,
force fund-raisers to tell prospective contributors what percentage
of the money the solicitors raised over the past 12 months had been
used for expenses and the fund-raisers' fees.
   The law also could limit the fees paid by charities to the
professional fund-raisers. A licensing provision of the statute
presumes that in most cases if more than 35 percent of donations
goes for the solicitor's fee, that is unreasonable.
   Errol Copilevitz, an attorney representing professional
fund-raisers and charities, said the law ``creates a real and
present danger of censorship.''
   ``I'm telling you professional representatives will not make
their services available if this regulation is allowed to stand,''
he said.
   Copilevitz particularly challenged the requirement that
solicitors tell a prospective contributor at the outset how much
money goes for expenses. That could cripple fund-raising over the
phone, he said.
   By the time the solicitor provides that information he ``will
have received a dial tone,'' Copilevitz said, adding, ``High costs
are not a measure of fraud or the worth of a charity.''
   The North Carolina law, enacted in 1985, was designed to prevent
fraud and assure that most of the money goes to charities and not
fund-raising costs.
   U.S. District Judge Earl Britt declared the law unconstitutional
in 1986.
   Britt said that without the help of professional solicitors,
many charities might be unable to communicate their views and goals.
   The judge also said that requiring a solicitor to disclose his
track record for the past 12 months ``is not relevant to the
particular solicitation campaign he is involved with at the time.''
   During an hour of Supreme Court arguments Wednesday, the
justices briskly questioned lawyers for both sides. The court is
expected to announce a decision by July.
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist compared North Carolina's law
to a state regulation that sets a maximum price on theater tickets.
   Copilevitz said that would be permissible if the purpose was to
make artistic performance more widely available.
   But when Justice Antonin Scalia asked whether a state could
place a ceiling on the cost of a renting a hall for a political
rally, Copilevitz said that would be unconstitutional.
   Justice Thurgood Marshall questioned the authority of states to
tell charities how to allocate their resources.
   ``Could you stop them from throwing away their money?'' he said.
   Thornburg said the charities need such protection. He said a
survey by North Carolina officials showed that from 1980 through
1984 the five largest professional fund-raisers in the state spent
approximately 80 percent of the money they raised on expenses and
their fees.
   The Supreme Court in 1980 and 1984 barred states from limiting
the amount of money charities spend on fund-raising. Thornburg
argued that those rulings do not preclude the type of regulation
North Carolina seeks to impose.
   Many states require fund-raisers to disclose to regulatory
agencies how much is spent on expenses.
   But Copilevitz said North Carolina's plan goes far beyond that.
   He is representing the National Federation of the Blind, the
Optimist Club and professional fund-raisers. Other charities have
joined in urging the court to declare the North Carolina law
unconstitutional.
   The case is Riley vs. National Federal of the Blind, 87-328.

<HEAD>Portugal Asks U.S. For F-16s In Return For Azores Base</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LISBON, Portugal (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Portugal has asked the United States to
equip its air force with F-16 fighter-bombers to compensate for a
shortfall in U.S. funds for the use of a strategic air base, a
government official said Wednesday.
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Lisbon
was seeking substantial U.S. help in modernizing its armed forces.
   The military assistance would offset cuts made by the U.S.
Congress in aid paid for use of the mid-Atlantic Lajes Air Base.
   Prime Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva last month formally requested
a review of the defense agreement under which the United States
uses the submarine-warfare and refuelling base on the Azores
archipelago because of falling U.S. aid to Portugal.
   The request for the F-16s, described as the world's finest
fighter-bombers, was presented to a U.S. military delegation that
visited Lisbon March 1-5, the official said.
   He refused to specify how many F-16s Portugal is seeking but
indicated the number requested in the first phase of negotiations
could approach 50. Washington officials are studying the proposals,
he added.
   The official said Portugal also sought Hawk missiles, combat
helicopters, sophisticated radar equipment, armored personnel
carriers and M-60 combat vehicles from the United States.
   Portugal's request for F-16s comes after neighboring Spain asked
the United States withdraw 74 F-16s from an air base outside
Madrid. There was no indication of where Portugal would station the
planes if they were supplied.
   Cavaco Silva called for a review of the defense agreement after
Congressional cuts caused U.S. aid to Portugal to fall from $208
million in 1985 to $117 million this year.
   Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci visited Lisbon to try to soothe
Portuguese dissatisfaction. The two countries agreed to set up a
joint task force to examine the posssibilities of supplying
Portugal with surplus U.S. military equipment to make up for the
shortfall in financial assistence.
   Apparently Portugal rejected the offer.
   ``We wanted to take the initiative by informing the United
States of the equipment we need instead of being presented with a
list of available surplus material that we can choose from,'' said
the government official.
   He said the proposals for U.S military equipment supplies were
based on Portugal's needs to modernize its armed forces so that it
could adequately fulfill its defensive role within the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization.

<HEAD>Corruption Scandal Develops Into Major Political Issue</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By C.W. LIM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Opposition parties on Wednesday said
the government must not cover up the growing scandal involving
alleged corruption by the brother of former President Chun Doo-hwan.
   The opposition alleged that corruption by Chun's relatives and
the Saemaul development movement was widespread.
   Saemaul, or New Community, which claims a membership of more
than 5 million community leaders, was formed in 1971 to improve
rural and urban living standards.
   ``We warn the government against minimizing, covering up or
whitewashing the scandal,'' said Park Young-sook, acting president
of the Party for Peace and Democracy. The rival opposition
Reunification Democratic Party also called for an independent
parliamentary probe.
   Kim Tae-ryong, RDP spokesman, also demanded an investigation
into the Ilhae Foundation, a semi-official think tank established
by Chun.
   The government is investigating charges that Saemaul, while
headed by Chun's younger brother, embezzled millions of dollars,
sold patronage and forced donations.
   The former president, who is on a private visit to the United
States, installed his brother, Kyung-hwan, as Saemaul head. Chun
Kyung-hwan resigned in 1987 after being linked to gangsters locked
in a bloody power struggle.
   Many political observers contend the Saemaul probe stemmed from
a power game between President Roh Tae-woo and Chun, with Roh's
supporters working to reduce the former president's power.
   Roh, a former general picked by Chun to succeed him, is widely
thought to be building popular support by proving corruption under
Chun. Roh has promised reforms since he won the country's first
democratic election last December.
   ``The new government faces an unavoidable challenge ... the
burdensome legacy of the old government,'' Don-A Ilbo, an
influential Seoul newspaper, said in a commentary.
   Newspapers said the Saemaul probe could be Roh's efforts to
distance himself from Chun, who tried to retain power. But
governing party officials fear the growing scandal would erode
their chances in National Assembly elections in April.
   The Prosecutor General's office said Wednesday it had questioned
about 50 government and Saemaul officials about allegations of
fraud, embezzlement and influence peddling.
   The prosecutors said Saemaul was found to have diverted some of
an estimated $130 million in funds to profit-oriented projects,
land speculation and other irregular activities.

<HEAD>Seapower Panel Deletes Trident Sub In Favor Of Two More Aegis
Warships</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CALLAHAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A House subcommittee has quietly voted to
delete funding for the Trident submarine in next year's budget and
use that $1.4 billion to build two Aegis destroyers instead,
lawmakers disclosed Wednesday.
   Rep. Sam Gejdenson, D-Conn., said the House Armed Services
seapower subcommittee voted in a closed session Tuesday to cut out
all Trident funding for fiscal 1989, a move pushed by Rep. Charles
E. Bennett, D-Fla.
   Bennett, chairman of the subcommittee, is opposing an
administration plan to sell two Aegis DDG-51 destroyers to Japan,
fearing that the United States would lose technology secrets.
   Under the funding plan approved by the subcommittee, the
government would order five Aegis warships in 1989. The
administration had requested three. The two extra ships would be
deployed in Japan under U.S. control, protecting Japanese security
interests while keeping the Aegis technology under wraps.
   Gejdenson, whose district includes the Electric Boat shipyard,
the division of General Dynamics Corp. that builds Tridents, sought
to play down Tuesday's vote.
   ``While I am clearly disappointed by the decision of the
seapower subcommittee, the subcommittee's decision is only the
first step in a lengthy and complex budget process,'' Gejdenson
said.
   The congressman, who is not a member of the Armed Services
Committee, noted that the seapower panel deleted funding for the
Trident two years ago, but funding was later restored by Congress.
   Gejdenson said he was confident Trident funding would be
restored again.
   But Bennett said in a telephone interview that he would fight to
keep the Trident out and the two extra Aegis ships in. He said the
program, which traditionally calls for one new Trident each year,
would be continued in the 1990 budget.
   A critical test comes next week when the full committee takes up
the defense budget.
   Electric Boat is the sole builder of the 18,750-ton submarine,
which is armed with 24 long-range, multi-warhead missiles. The subs
are built at the company's yards in Groton, Conn., and North
Kingstown, R.I.
   The 8,300-ton Aegis destroyer, equipped with 90 missiles, is
being built by Bath Iron Works in Bath, Maine, and the Ingalls
Shipbuilding in Pascagoula, Miss.

   A study of last year's wheat quality showed

   For hard red spring wheat, 75 percent graded No. 1, compared

   The annual survey involved 12,739 wheat samples from the 1987

<HEAD>Cuomo Draft Would Harm Democrats, Top Party Official Says</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Democratic Party's chances in November
would suffer if a non-candidate such as New York Gov. Mario Cuomo
won the presidential nomination after a deadlocked national
convention, a top party official said Wednesday.
   It would be a difficult situation and there would be
increasingly bad feelings, Lynn Cutler, vice chairman of the
Democratic National Committee, said at a news conference. ``To the
general electorate it might not make any difference at all, but to
the people who have to go out and win the election ... I think it
would be very tough.''
   Cuomo has said much the same thing, but has refused to rule out
accepting a draft if the convention is deadlocked. He has also
declined, as yet, to endorse any of the Democratic candidates.
   ``He's fully aware of the power of his endorsement and what it
means,'' Ms. Cutler said. ``It makes a national statement. Without
question I think it would have a big impact in a place like
California where there's a great deal of affection for the
governor.''

   Lenora Fulani says her presidential campaign
gives blacks and other minorities someplace to go when, she
predicts, Jesse Jackson is denied the Democratic nomination.
   Ms. Fulani, 37, of New York, candidate of the New Alliance
Party, says she is the first black woman presidential candidate to
qualify for federal election matching funds.
   She said her campaign will give Jackson leverage at the
Democratic National Convention this summer.
   ``They're going to know he's sitting there with an ace up his
sleeve. And that ace is a well-orchestrated, viable third-party
road,'' she said. ``What I'm building in this country for Jackson
is something to broker with.''
   Ms. Fulani said she will give up her campaign if Jackson wins
the Democratic nomination in July. But she said that is unlikely
because ``he is too black and too progressive'' and the Democrats
will pick ``a white moderate, conservative of pseudo-liberal.''
   She was in Tulsa on Tuesday to boost her petition campaign for a

   Mayor Edward I. Koch predicted Wednesday that
George Bush will be the next president _ unless the Democrats turn
to New York Gov. Mario Cuomo or Bush puts ``both feet in his
mouth.''
   He predicted the Democratic ticket will be Massachusetts Gov.
Michael Dukakis and Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore.
   ``As I perceive it now, I think we will have a very tough
time,'' said Koch, a Democrat. He said Bush, as evidenced by his
many defeats of Sen. Robert Dole in the Republican primaries, was
drawing strength from President Reagan's popularity.
   But Koch said he thought Bush was ``capable of putting both feet
in his mouth'' and added, ``maybe we'll be lucky.''
   As for the Democrats, he said, ``I hope at the convention we'll
turn to Mario Cuomo. He (would make) a most articulate candiate,
charismatic.''
   ``But if that doesn't happen,'' he said, ``I expect the

   Mayor Tom Bradley has decided not to endorse

   ``I have been asked by every Democratic presidential campaign to

Tuesday. ``I have told each of those campaigns exactly the same
thing. I am not going to be involved in the Democratic primaries in

   Jackson backers said the mayor's decision could cost him some
black support in next year's election, when he will run for an
unprecedented fifth term as mayor of the nation's second-largest
city.
   ``Tom takes a chance by not supporting Jesse,'' said businessman
Bondie Gambrell, a local Jackson supporter and one of Bradley's
biggest financial backers.

   Here are the key points in truce
proposals by Nicaragua's Sandinista government and the Contra
rebels:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   SANDINISTAS
   A cease-fire of up to 90 days during which the Contras would lay
down their weapons and join a ``national reconciliation dialogue.''
   For every rebel who stops fighting, the government would free a
political prisoner considered eligible for release. Nicaragua has
an estimated 3,300 such prisoners.
   Rebels who put down their arms would be free from prosecution
without applying for amnesty and could take part in political life.
They would be permitted to operate uncensored newspapers, magazines
and radio stations, but television would remain a government
monopoly.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   CONTRAS
   A 45-day truce, with zones where rebel fighters could await
negotiation of a permanent truce, keeping their weapons. There is
no mention of when the rebels would give up their arms.
   Total amnesty including release of all political prisoners,
return of political exiles, full press freedom, suspension of the
military draft and inclusion of Contras in the Sandinista dialogue
with the domestic opposition.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   VERIFICATION
   The Sandinistas propose an international commission to verify an
end to hostilities. The Contras suggest a commission run by
Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo, Roman Catholic archbishop of
Managua, and Joao Baena Soares, secretary-general of the
Organization of American States.

   Officials have declared a water shortage
emergency in the communities east of San Francisco and are warning
they may ration water to 1.1 million customers for the first time
in a decade.
   If a voluntary conservation plan approved by the East Bay
Municipal Utility District on Tuesday fails, the agency may impose
water restrictions of up to 25 percent for homes and businesses in
the burgeoning Alameda and Contra Costa counties from May through
September.
   Rationing measures under consideration include refusing water
hookups to new housing developments, and restricting new or
expanded landscaping, car washing and street washing. Swimming
pools could not be filled after a certain date and lawns could be
watered just two days a week.
   The proposed conservation measures would be the most severe
steps taken by the district since the 1977 drought, when water
customers were charged up to 10 times the normal rate for excessive
water use, district spokesman Gayle Montgomery said Wednesday.
   ``We don't want to make this a Draconian thing, but we do want
to save a lot of water,'' said district General Manager Jerome
Gilbert, at a packed, four-hour public hearing Tuesday.
   From Oct. 1 to March 1, precipitation was 85 percent of normal
statewide, water officials said. That means there's much less snow
in the mountains ready to melt and flow into rivers and reservoirs
this spring.
   State Water Resources Department engineers said last week that
river runoffs from snow melt will average below 60 percent of
normal between April and July statewide, even if spring rainfall is
normal. If rainfall stays sparse, the situation will be even worse.
   At least one farm irrigation district has already declared a
drought emergency and cut back water allotments to its farmers.
   The Turlock Irrigation District, which serves Central Valley
farmers in southern Stanislaus to northern Merced counties, said
farmers will be allotted only about one-fourth their typical water
amount this year.
   ``Without question, we are in a drought situation,'' said
district General Manager Ernest Geddes. ``Even with normal
precipitation for the remainder of the spring, the Tuolumne River
runoff will total no more than 50 percent of the historical
average.''
   In the East Bay Municipal Utility District, Gilbert said
reservoirs that are half-full now could be one-quarter full by
September unless there are major storms during the next two months.
   ``Runoff this year is the second-lowest year on record in our
area and follows a year that was the fourth-worst,'' said Ted Way,
the district's chief engineer. He predicted this year's dry
conditions will become as severe as those in 1977.
   If the dry spells continued into a third year, the effect would
be ``devastating,'' said Montgomery.
   San Francisco, Marin and Santa Clara counties face possible
water shortages next year, but are in better shape than Alameda and
Contra Costa because they have more water sources and have received
more storms.
   At a meeting in Sacramento last week, state water experts
considered whether to declare a drought for the state as a whole,
deciding to take a wait-and-see approach for the time being.
   ``Every day without a storm, the picture gets worse,'' said Jack
Pardee, a snowpack survey engineer with the state Water Resources
Department.
   But Maurice Roos, chief of the department's water supply branch,
said declaration of a drought is premature because even though
river runoff from the mountains is substantially below average,
storage in reservoirs is only slightly below normal in most parts
of the state.
   Water officials aren't the only ones worried about the dry
weather. Fire officials say it could be the sign of an early and
dangerous fire season. During the grim fire season last year,
lightning-spawned blazes blackened nearly a million acres of mostly
forest lands in California.
   ``This is very similar to the weather pattern we saw last year
at this time,'' said Maryn Pitt, assistant director of the state
Department of Forestry. ``It will only further distress the
watershed, and to date already this year we've had 520 fires over
448 acres. Our 90-day forecast (for rain) is below normal through
May.''
   East Bay water district directors will consider specific
rationing proposals April 13, and judging from Tuesday's hearing
the issue threatens to set suburban residents against city dwellers.
   ``I think we should share the pain,'' said Sandy Skaggs, water
board president and a resident of an affluent development in San
Ramon, where suburbanites take their lawns seriously.
   But Danville Mayor Beverly Lane, whose lawn died in the 1977
drought, agreed with landscapers that the area could suffer layoffs
and financial losses if new landscaping was restricted or valuable
grasslands allowed to die.
   ``We are the hot weather part of the district,'' Lane said
Tuesday during four hours of spirited debate by more than 100 city
leaders and landscaping and gardening industry representatives.
``Our needs are different than the cooler parts of the district.''

<HEAD>Northwest Smoking Ban Could Be Risky Move, Some Analysts Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCY GORDON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a move some analysts called risky, Northwest
Airlines announced Wednesday it will become the first major U.S.
airline to ban smoking on all domestic flights except those to and
from Hawaii.
   The ban by the Minneapolis-based carrier, the nation's
fifth-largest airline, also covers some foreign routes. It goes
beyond federal regulations that go into effect next month for
domestic flights lasting two hours or less.
   The stringent non-smoking policy appears to be aimed at
attracting new passengers but could backfire and cost the carrier
some traffic, some analysts believe.
   ``It does run the risk of some loss of business,'' said James V.
Cammisa, the publisher of Travel Industry Indicators, a New
York-based newsletter. ``I guess they (Northwest officials) really
stuck their neck out.''
   Wall Street seemed unimpressed by Northwest's smoke-free
innovation. The airline's stock closed on the New York Stock
Exchange at $45.75 per share, down 12{ cents from Tuesday.
   The Northwest ban is ``somewhat contentious from a marketing
point of view,'' said Robert Joedicke, an airline analyst for
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. ``If there is a danger, why try to be a
leader?''
   It is fairly unlikely that the other big U.S. airlines would
match Northwest's policy, creating a financial risk for the
carrier, some observers believe.
   But Northwest says the prohibition is a response to its
passengers' and employees' requests. A.B. ``Sky'' Magary,
Northwest's executive vice president for marketing, told a news
conference in New York that while the policy is not without risk,
``we believe more non-smokers will switch to Northwest than smokers
will leave.''
   He cited a Northwest study showing that nine out of 10
passengers prefer to sit in the no-smoking section of a plane. More
surprisingly, about 30 percent of smokers express the desire for
smoke-free flights, according to the survey.
   The new policy, called ``Northwest Clears the Air,'' will take
effect on April 23 _ the same day as the less restrictive federal
law. It will apply to flights within the contiguous 48 states as
well as flights to and from Alaska, Mexico, Canada, Jamaica and the
Cayman Islands.
   Northwest flights to and from Hawaii and overseas will continue
to offer smoking sections because those flights ``carry a greater
proportion of foreign passengers who feel differently about the
issue,'' the airline said in a statement.
   ``We still have competitors that are handing out cigars to
passengers on board,'' Magary said.
   About 30 percent of Northwest's domestic flights last more than
two hours, and could have kept their smoking sections under the new
federal regulations. The longest flights covered by the smoking ban
are four or five hours, according to the airline.
   Under those rules, passengers who insist on lighting up will
face civil fines of as much as $1,000, and passengers who tamper
with smoke alarms in airplane lavatories will be liable for as much
as $2,000 in penalties.
   Air Canada, which banned smoking on some flights between Canada
and the United States last April, said it has gained customers as a
result of its no-smoking policy. ``It's been very successful,''
said Steve Pisni, a spokesman for the carrier.
   Northwest's announcement drew praise from several quarters,
including officials of the American Cancer Society, the American
Lung Association and the U.S. surgeon general's office, who
participated in the news conference with Magary.
   Rep. Richard Durbin, D-Ill., the prime sponsor of the new
federal non-smoking law, also hailed Northwest's move. He said he
is sending letters to all the other major U.S. carriers, urging
them to follow Northwest's lead.
   ``This action by Northwest just proves what we've been saying
all along: Cleaning up the air in airplanes is a good business
decision and a good health decision,'' Durbin said.
   Some travel agents also praised the new policy, saying many of
their customers have been pressing for a tougher stance.
   ``I think it's a good move ... because the public is the one
that wants it,'' said Jack Bloch, owner of JB's World Travel in New
York.

   The House approved with rare bipartisanship
Wednesday a $1.1 trillion budget that would tighten domestic and
military spending but boost high-profile items including AIDS
research, education, the space program and the war on drugs.
   The fiscal 1989 plan, which follows the outlines of last fall's
budget summit between President Reagan and congressional leaders,
was approved 319 to 102. A majority of both Democrats and
Republicans voted in favor of the package.
   The House brushed aside criticism from Reagan's budget director,
who said the plan used accounting gimmicks to stay within the
prearranged spending limits. It also rejected three alternative
budget proposals.
   Many members conceded they were putting off tough
deficit-reduction decisions until next year, but Republicans and
Democrats praised the plan and spent much of the debate reveling
about the absence of acrimony.
   ``We've got a miracle,'' said House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas.
   ``For the first time in many many years, we've seen a budget
resolution out before cherry blossom time or autumn leaves,'' said
Rep. Silvio Conte, R-Mass.
   Lawmakers had far less to haggle over than in past years. The
totals for military, foreign aid and domestic spending were
predetermined by last fall's summit between Reagan and
congressional leaders. The tax increases envisioned in the summit,
$14 billion for fiscal 1989, were enacted in December.
   Using the president's own optimistic economic estimates, the
budget claimed a $134 billion deficit, which is within the limits
of the Gramm-Rudman budget balancing law.
   Like Reagan's plan, the House budget would not touch Social
Security. The lawmakers rejected a cut in Medicare the
administration said was needed. They also refused to go along with
Reagan's plan to eliminate some domestic development and mass
transit programs.
   Instead, the election-year plan would give most federal agencies
a little more money to spend than in the current year, but not
enough to keep pace with inflation.
   In addition, the agencies would be required to find enough
savings to absorb half of a 3 percent pay raise for federal
employees. Reagan had proposed a 4.3 percent pay boost for the
militay and 2 percent for civilian workers, but the House made them
equally 3 percent.
   In selected areas, spending was increased. The budget authorizes
$1.5 billion for AIDS research _ a little more than Reagan proposed
_ and it would increase space and science spending, though not as
much as the president asked.
   The $134 billion deficit figure for the year beginning Oct. 1
was about $5 billion above the president's mark, largely because
Reagan wanted to sell more government assets. The deficit in fiscal
1987 was $150.4 billion. The administration estimates it will go
down to $146.7 billion this year.
   The House budget claimed to hit exactly the limits in the budget
summit pact for cash outlays and for budget authority _ the legal
obligations by agencies for spending that could stretch over more
than one fiscal year.
   The pact included: $299.5 billion in budget authority and $294.0
billion in outlays for the military; $148.1 billion in budget
authority and $169.2 billion in outlays for annually appropriated
domestic programs; and $18.1 billion in budget authority and $16.1
billion in outlays on foreign aid.
   In crafting the budget, the House Budget Committee ran into
difficulty meeting the limits on domestic spending authority. In
the end, the panel reclassified about $3.7 billion in spending
authority out from under the categories covered by the agreement.
   James C. Miller III, director of the White House Office of
Management and Budget, said in a letter he was ``disturbed'' by the
accounting shift. In addition, he said there appeared to be
``deliberate underfunding of certain programs that would require a
supplemental appropriation next year.''
   Rep. William H. Gray III, D-Pa., chairman of the budget
committee, said he considered Miller's letter a sign that the
administration would keep working with Congress to control
spending. He called the dispute a ``scorekeeping issue'' that would
be resolved later.
   The budget technique could lead to higher spending allowances
when the fiscal blueprint is translated later into actual pending
bills. Several lawmakers said that while the budget was in the
spirit of the bipartisan ``summit,'' it also avoided any tough
belt-tightening in an election year.
   ``This budget is in a real sense a delay budget,'' said Rep.
Charles Schumer, D-N.Y.
   ``Next year is going to be the real problem,'' said Rep. Amory
Houghton, R-N.Y.
   The House approval of the budget was far earlier than in past
years, but it was still unlikely that Congress would meet its April
15 deadline for final approval of a budget resolution.
   Senate Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., said Wednesday
he did not expect full Senate action on the budget before the
second week of April.

<HEAD>Russian Version of O'Neill Play Makes Debut Under American
Director</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANDREW KATELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eugene O'Neill's classic ``Desire Under the Elms''
played to a sold-out audience on a Moscow stage Wednesday night,
the first play directed by an American in the Soviet Union.
   Mark Lamos, 42, artistic director of the Hartford Stage Co. of
Connecticut, received a standing ovation after the opening
performance of O'Neill's 1924 play about the struggle for dominance
between father and son on a 19th-century New England farm.
   Lamos had to confront linguistic and cultural barriers in
bringing the play before a Soviet audience.
   The 870 people at the performance applauded politely in rhythm
for the Soviet actors, and then rose to applaud energetically for
Lamos.
   The director, wearing a dappled blazer and red tie, was given an
ornately painted samovar and bouquet of flowers. He plucked one out
and presented it to the lead actress, Nina Popova, who was still in
tears from the final wrenching scene.
   ``The feeling of great personality is missing,'' Alexander
Aronov, who writes for the youth newspaper Moskovsky Komsomolets,
said in an interview.
   He said he believed Lamos strayed from O'Neill's conception,
although the actors' movements and attire seemed more American than
previous Soviet performances of the play he had seen.
   Lamos said he believed his version was closer to O'Neill's
because the original Russian translation was too poetic and smooth.
He said during a break in a rehearsal Tuesday that he tried to tone
down what he called the overemotional and unnatural style of the
actors.
   Several Soviets in the audience said they found the language in
Lamos' version too crude.
   Aronov said part of the blame should be placed on the actors of
Moscow's Pushkin Theater, with the exception of Ms. Popova.
   O'Neill and Tennessee Williams are the best known and best loved
American playwrights in the Soviet Union. Lamos said Soviets know
little about other American playwrights, especially more
contemporary ones whose work he prefers, and was unhappy with the
choice of ``Desire Under the Elms'' for his direction.
   ``The exposition of the play is a bit crudely done,'' Lamos said.
   The play was chosen by the Pushkin Theater's artistic director,
Yuri Yeremin, as an appropriate way to celebrate the centennial of
O'Neill's 1888 birth.
   ``Desire Under the Elms'' was the first play performed in the
Pushkin Theater in 1926 and has become a standard in the Soviet
repertoire.
   Lamos was invited to stage the play in Moscow after he met a
group of Soviet theater directors in New York last summer.
   Another American, Nagle Jackson of the McCarter Theater in
Princeton, N.J., is directing a production of ``The Glass
Menagerie'' by Williams that is scheduled to open later this year
at Leningrad's Gorky Theater. Two other Americans are scheduled to
direct plays in Moscow in the fall.
   Lamos relied on a Soviet interpreter to communicate with the
all-Soviet cast and crew.
   Language difficulties seemed especially severe when he was first
reviewing the script with the actors and came across the phrase
``to pull the wool over his eyes,'' he recalled.
   When Lamos explained that the phrase meant to fool someone, the
actors came up with a Russian equivalent _ which translates into
``he has noodles on his ears.''
   The American didn't believe the expression was appropriate, but
he said one participant chimed in: ``Let me put it this way, Mark,
we've had noodles over our ears in this country for 70 years.''

<TEXT>
   Police on Wednesday said they
were abandoning their policy of staying away from IRA funerals,
following the slayings of five people _ including two British
soldiers _ at rites last week.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher joined grieving relatives at
Northolt air base near London as the bodies of two British soldiers
arrived home and were lifted from a transport plane to the strains
of Chopin's ``Funeral March.''
   Mrs. Thatcher's appearance marked the first time a prime
minister had watched the coffins of soldiers brought home from
Northern Ireland in the nearly 20 years since Britain deployed
troops in the province.
   In central Belfast, police mounted heavy patrols at the Cenotaph
as 25,000 people turned out for an emotional service for the
soldiers.
   The two corporals were dragged from their unmarked car, beaten,
stripped and shot after they drove up to an Irish Republican Army
funeral on Saturday. No police had been assigned to the funeral.
   A British army spokesman said that a security patrol ordered to
intervene after an army helicopter reported disturbances at
Saturday's funeral arrived ``within three minutes of the shots
having been fired'' at the British soldiers.
   At another unpoliced IRA funeral in Belfast on March 16, a
Protestant fired shots and hurled hand grenades at mourners,
killing three people and wounding 68.
   The no-police policy was implemented at the March 16 funeral
when three IRA guerrillas shot by British commandos in Gibraltar
were buried. Moderate Roman Catholic leaders had urged police to
stay away to avoid clashes with mourners.
   Michael Stone, a Protestant guerrilla, is accused of killing
three people and wounding 68 at the funeral. He told police he was
on a mission of revenge against the IRA and was charged with those
three killings and three other sectarian slayings in the past four
years.
   The Royal Ulster Constabulary, the province's police force,
announced Wednesday that security chiefs will resume their presence
at the funerals of IRA members.
   ``Experience has shown that maintenance of th law and prevention
of outrages will only be guaranteed through the firm presence of
the police and army,'' a police statement said.
   Sinn Fein, the outlawed IRA's legal political front, Sinn Fein,
condemned the police decision.
   ``Any return to the violence of saturation tactics at funerals
will only ensure confrontation,'' said Sinn Fein vice president
Martin McGuinness. ``All we want is to be allowed to bury our dead
with dignity and peace.''
   At Northolt, Mrs. Thatcher stood with the families of Royal
Signals Corp corporals Derek Wood, 24, and David Howes, 23, as a
Hercules transport landed with the coffins.
   The prime minister, who presence underscored national outrage
over the killings, glanced around anxiously as Wood's mother and
sister sobbed when the army band struck up and a bearer party
carried the flag-draped coffins slowly toward hearses.
   Since 1969, 563 British soldiers have been among the nearly
2,700 people killed in the sectarian violence in Northern Ireland.
Of the soldiers killed, 391 have been from mainland Britain and 172
from the locally recruited Ulster Defense Regiment.
   In another development, Britain's two television networks gave
police untransmitted video footage of the rampage at Saturday's
funeral after they were threatened with prosecution.
   The networks had initially refused to yield the footage, saying
it would endanger the lives of their crews.
   Earlier, the Catholic bishop whose diocese includes west Belfast
denounced the IRA as ``sheer evil'' in one of the strongest attacks
yet by a prelate on the guerrilla organization.
   ``IRA violence is often disguised with a mask of romantic
rhetoric and militaristic mock ritual,'' said Bishop Cahal Daly.
``For a ghastly half-hour on Saturday, the mask slipped. The real
face of IRA violence was shown and it was horrible to see.''
   The IRA is fighting to unite Northern Ireland with the Catholic
Republic of Ireland under a leftist administration.

<HEAD>Senate Panel Clears Way for Early Vote on Arms Treaty</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-US-Soviet Bjt</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: UPDATES throughout with Helms backing off on amendments;
edits to tighten</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate Foreign Relations Committee cleared
the way Wednesday for an early vote to endorse the new arms
reduction treaty with the Soviet Union after a series of lopsided
tallies against amendments proposed by the pact's chief opponent,
Sen. Jesse Helms.
   Helms, R-N.C., had introduced a series of 36 amendments to the
accord. But he agreed to press for substantive action on just four
of them after Republican and Democratic senators accused him of
obstruction and deliberately engineering a series of delays.
   Committee chairman Claiborne Pell, R-R.I., announced the panel
will vote next Tuesday afternoon on reporting the treaty to the
Senate floor with a favorable recommendation.
   Pell had promised to keep the committee in lengthy session to
dispose of the Helms amendments, none of which had attracted more
than three votes among the 19 committee members.
   Helms's reversal of course came after a morning session of the
panel in which Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., complained: ``We're just
in a delay, stall situation which I find disagreeable.''
   ``If you don't have the votes and just try to overload it with
amendments, that isn't fair,'' Lugar said shortly before the
committee defeated the first of the Helms amendments, 12-3.
   ``I don't know what is the magical effect of racing to get this
thing reported'' to the Senate floor, Helms said at that point.
   Meanwhile, Pell and several other key committee members said the
last major factor complicating Senate consideration of the new
agreement banning U.S. and Soviet medium-range missiles is the
dispute between Congress and the Reagan administration over the
interpretation of treaties.
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Senate Armed Services
Committee, seeks to add language to the treaty text declaring the
Senate's understanding that administration testimony about the
contents and impact of the accord is authoritative and binding.
   The dispute stems from the administration's earlier
reinterpretation of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty to
permit the deployment of a Star Wars missile defense system which
most arms control treaty experts believed had been effectively
banned.
   Senate Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., told the Senate
on Wednesday he has concluded it will be essential to attach a
reservation or understanding to the pact spelling out the Senate's
position.
   Byrd said that while there have been exchanges of letters on how
the treaty should be interpreted, ``this matter is not going to be
resolved, in my judgment, by any exchange of letters, because a
future administration can say ... `We don't agree with that
interpretation at all.'''
   The initial 12-3 committee vote rejected a Helms amendment which
would have changed the treaty to permit the United States to deploy
a ground-launched cruise missile armed with conventional and not
nuclear explosives.
   Only Sens. Larry Pressler, R-S.D., and Frank Murkowski,
R-Alaska, joined Helms in supporting the amendment.
   Adopting the amendment would mean reopening negotiations with
the Soviets, Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., said. ``And that would
mean we would plainly not get a treaty anytime soon. So this can
fairly be labled as a killer amendment.''
   He said conventionally armed cruise missiles were included in
the pact because it is impossible to differentiate them from
identical weapons armed with nuclear warheads.
   With the conventionally armed missiles excluded, the treaty
would not be verifiable, Cranston said.
   But Helms said the ban means ``the conventional imbalance in
Europe will be even greater than it is now'' because NATO will lose
a major weapon in the cruise missile.
   However, Helms later relented, the Tuesday vote was set, and the
committee overwhelmingly rejected three amendments, all of which
were described by opponents as having the potential to kill the
treaty by forcing the reopening of negotiations with the Soviets.
   An amendment by Sen. Larry Pressler, R-S.D ., which would have
delayed implementation of the treaty until negotiations reduced
Soviet surperiority in conventional arms in Europe also was
rejected, 15-2.
   Both Democratic and Republican leaders predict overwhelming
ratification when the treaty reaches the Senate floor and say only
10 or 12 members of the 100-member Senate are likely to vote to
reject it. Ratification requires a two-thirds vote.

   The House ethics committee Wednesday sharply
rebuked Rep. Charles Rose, D-N.C., after concluding he improperly
borrowed funds from his campaign and then failed to publicly report
the transactions.
   Finding ``clear and convincing evidence'' of House rules
violations, the committee also said Rose wrongly pledged a
certificate of deposit from his campaign as collateral on a
personal loan; and failed to report liabilities to financial
institutions on his financial reports, filed publicly by all
lawmakers.
   The panel, formally the Committee on Standards of Official
Conduct, wrote Rose that his behavior was ``deserving of
reproach.'' But the committee concluded there should be no
punishment by the full House because the eight-term lawmaker has
tried to rectify his mistakes.
   ``The committee recognizes and takes into consideration the fact
that all funds borrowed were replaced in full without the
insistence of this committee, and that this action was taken by you
prior to this committee beginning a preliminary inquiry,'' Rose was
told in the letter, signed by panel Chairman Julian C. Dixon,
D-Calif., and ranking Republican Floyd D. Spence of South Carolina.
   ``Furthermore, the committee recognizes that the campaign
certificate of deposit in question is no longer encumbered, due to
restrictions placed on it in connection with your personal
financial dealings.''
   Rose said he was ``very happy that the committee found that no
further action was warranted, other than the letter to me.'' He
said he did not expect the situation to hamper his future
re-election bids, and that the committee's decision not to take
tougher action demonstrated it considered his mistakes technical in
nature.
   ``I'm happy that it's behind me, I'm satisfied with the result
and I'm glad I can move on to total concentration on what the
people elected me to do,'' he said in an interview. ``My head is
high.''
   A House rule restricts the use of campaign funds to bona fide
campaign purposes. The committee called the requirement ``crucial
to maintaining public confidence in the fund-raising system
governing House members.
   ``The use of your campaign funds, as alleged and proved, is
entirely inconsistent with this principle,'' the committee letter
said.
   The panel said the personal benefit Rose received in each
instance of borrowing, and the lower interest rate received from
use of the certificate of deposit, ``are the kinds of abuses''
House rules were designed to prevent.
   ``For this reason, the committee instructs that you refrain from
any future campaign borrowings and-or use of campaign assets as
collateral,'' the committee said.
   Rose said he was disappointed the committee did not accept his
contention that money he took from his campaign amounted to
repayment of loans. He said he apologized for signing his name to
the certificate of deposit, contending he hadn't known doing so
violated House rules.
   Rose, 48, was first elected to the House in 1972. The state
Republican Party first raised allegations about Rose's finances in
1986. But Rose easily won election to an eighth term in the House,
where he is chairman of the Agriculture subcommittee on tobacco and
peanuts.
   ``I rather expect that the Republicans will be angry that the
committee gave me the lightest possible action they can give,'' he
said.

<TEXT>
   The new president of a moderate group of
Southern Baptists said Wednesday the organization has no intention
of forming a separate denomination, but he acknowledged it appears
headed in that direction.
   The Rev. John Thomason of Jackson, Miss., was elected president
Tuesday of the 25,000-member Southern Baptist Alliance, a group of
moderates formed in response to fundamentalist control of the 14.7
million-member Southern Baptist Convention.
   The alliance, which was formed more than a year ago, concluded
its annual meeting here Wednesday.
   While both factions generally are conservative, they disagree on
key issues, including ordination of women and biblical inerrancy,
the view held by fundamentalists that the Bible is the literal
truth.
   The fundamentalists have gained control of the SBC hierarchy
through nine years of electing their presidential candidates.
   During the next year, Thomason said in an interview, he will
``keep pressing the concern of the alliance, to continue sounding
the word about our threatened heritage.''
   While some have accused the alliance of being the nucleus for a
denomination, Thomason said: ``We are not a fringe group, we are
not an avant garde faction of the Southern Baptist Convention. The
great majority of SBA members are denominational loyalists.''
   Thomason acknowledged that the alliance may appear to be headed
toward denominational status because of its publishing activities
and its discussions concerning the possible need for a new seminary
or divinity school.
   ``Whenever we take specific steps like that, we are acting
independently of the institutions of the Southern Baptist
Convention and that gives the appearance of independence, but it is
not our desire to forge a permanent split with the SBC,'' Thomason
said.
   He said the alliance has to be an ``advocate for groups and
causes we feel are disenfranchised. ... If this means acting
independently of the existing agencies and channels of SBC life,
then for the time being, we are willing to do that.''
   Fundamentalists, who oppose ordination of women, say the Bible
is without factual error in historical, scientific and religious
areas. Moderates maintain there is room for interpretation,
especially in non-religious areas.
   Before fundamentalists gained control of the SBC, Thomason said,
there was no ``creedal litmus test'' for appointees. If the
practice continues, ``one by one, we will see our institutions
succumb to creedalism,'' Thomason said.
   Fundamentalists have clear control of Southeastern Baptist
Theological Seminary in Wake Forest, N.C. and the Home Mission
Board in Atlanta.
   R. Randall Lolley resigned last year as president of
Southeastern rather than carry out the board's order that only
Biblical inerrantists be hired as professors. The Home Mission
Board has refused to help pay women ministers.
   Thomason is pastor of the 561-member Northminster Baptist
Church, the third church to join the alliance after its formation
in February 1987. The alliance includes 40 churches in 11 states.

<HEAD>Networks Give Police Videotapes of Northern Ireland Killings</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Irish, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Britain's two television networks on Wednesday
gave police unbroadcast videotapes of a mob attack leading up to
the killing of two British soldiers at an IRA funeral procession in
Northern Ireland.
   The British Broadcasting Corp. and Independent Television News
had refused earlier to comply with police demands for the film, on
grounds that doing so would endanger their crews in the British
province.
   On Wednesday night, however, the BBC in Belfast said it gave
police a 49-second videotape from the funeral.
   An Irish Republican Army mob at the procession dragged the two
soldiers from a car Saturday and beat them with iron bars. The
soldiers were hauled away and later found shot to death nearby.
   An announcement from ITN said the commercial network also gave
police untransmitted footage from the funeral in Belfast, the
provincial capital.
   ``Having considered our legal position, we have complied,'' ITN
said. ``The principle of withholding our untransmitted material
remains important to us, but ITN's policy is to observe the law.''
   BBC director Michael Checkland said the network relinquished the
footage in ``response to a legal requirement'' after plainclothes
officers visited its Belfast office.
   ``The BBC has never set itself above the law,'' Checkland said.
``In dealing with this matter, we have been concerned with the
difficult and dangerous position of our crews in Northern Ireland.
I very much hope ... the BBC's future newsgathering in the province
will not be damaged.''
   Both networks had shown the mob attack, but not the killings, in
their regular newscasts. The Royal Ulster Constabulary, the
provincial police, demanded untransmitted film to assist its
investigation.
   Network spokesmen said their untransmitted tapes did not show
the soldiers being shot to death and would be of little help, but
police demanded the material under Britain's antiterrorist
legislation.
   Officials of BBC, ITN and the Irish network RTE had said they
would not release footage that had not been broadcast unless a
court ordered it. RTE said Wednesday the police had not yet made a
formal request.
   All the networks said terrorists had threatened the lives of
employees who covered the funeral, and argued that crews covering
future violence would not be safe if they were thought to be
cooperating with police.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher rejected the networks' argument
that they must maintain an impartial stance in their coverage of
violence.
   ``Either one is on the side of justice or on the side of
terrorism,'' she told Parliament on Tuesday.
   ``I believe everyone, the media included, has a bounden duty to
do everything they can to see that those who perpetrated the
terrible crimes we all saw on TV, which disgusted the whole world,
are brought to justice.''

<TEXT>
   A witness at Abbas Hamadi's
kidnap trial testified Wednesday that Hamadi confided to a friend
that he was involved in abducting one of two West Germans kidnapped
in Lebanon.
   The Lebanese-born defendant is accused in the separate
kidnappings of the two Germans in January 1987 in a bid to force
the Bonn government to release his brother, Mohammed Hamadi, who is
charged with hijacking a TWA airliner.
   El Saheli, who was hired by West German investigators to listen
in on Abbas Hamadi's wiretapped telephone calls after the
abductions, testified that Abbas Hamadi acknowledged at least one
kidnapping.
   Saheli said a Lebanese friend asked Abbas Hamadi in one
telephone conversation whether he helped kidnap businessman Rudolf
Cordes.
   ``He answered `yes,''' said Saheli.
   But defense attorney Eckhardt Hild told the court his client was
``only bragging to make himself look good'' in the eyes of his
Lebanese friends in West Germany.
   In other testimony Wednesday, Abbas Hamadi said two members of
the extremist pro-Iranian Hezbollah group prevented him from
boarding a plane leaving Beirut just before Cordes was kidnapped on
Jan. 17, 1987.
   Hamadi said an employee of Beirut airport, whom he identified as
``L. Ham Rachan,'' could verify he was forced to miss his flight to
Europe.
   The 29-year-old defendant did not indicate what he thought
Hezbollah's motives might have been.
   West German investigators suspect Hezbollah was involved in the
kidnappings and that Hamadi had links to the group.
   Abbas Hamadi returned to West Germany from Lebanon on Jan. 26,
1987, and was arrested at Frankfurt airport.
   Since his trial began on Jan. 5, Abbas Hamadi has appealed for
the release of Cordes, and has denied any role in the kidnappings.
   West German engineer Alfred Schmidt, abducted in Beirut on Jan.
20, 1987, was released in September.
   Mohammed Hamadi, 23, was arrested at Frankfurt on Jan. 13, 1987,
carrying liquid explosives and forged identification documents.
   West Germany has refused a U.S. extradition request for the
younger Hamadi, but has charged him in connection with the June
1985 hijacking of a TWA airliner in which 39 people were held
hostage 17 days and a U.S. Navy diver was killed.
   Mohammed Hamadi is being held in a Frankfurt prison pending
trial. Abbas Hamadi's trial is to resume on April 5 and a decision
is expected by April 19.

<TEXT>
   A U.S. diplomat was given 48 hours to
leave Panama on Wednesday, the third day of a general strike that
has virtually shut down the country but not loosened Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega's grip on power. David Miller, an economics
counselor, was the second American diplomat ordered out by the
Foreign Ministry, which gaveno reason for its decision.
   In Washington, the State Department said Wednesday night it
would ignore the order because the United States considers the
government that issued it illegitimate. It gave the same reason for
rejecting the previous order against Terence Kneebone, head of the
U.S. Information Service in Panama, who remains in the country.
   Panama is out of cash because Washington cut off the supply of
U.S. dollars, the Panamanian national currency, in its effort to
drive Noriega into exile. Federal grand juries in Florida indicted
Noriega last month on narcotics and money laundering charges.
   A U.S. medical batallion truck returning from maneuvers with a
dozen soldiers was surrounded and stopped by national police after
straying onto a city highway Wednesday afternoon.
   The truck and men were held for an hour at the roadside, then
taken to Fort Amador, a Panamanian base with a U.S. liason.
   A Panamanian soldier outside the military police office where
the Americans were taken would not allow reporters inside and said
the incident was being handled as an administrative process. Under
U.S.-Panama treaties, such military trucks are prohibited outside
the former Canal Zone.
   The Panama Canal operated normally, as it has through weeks of
protest against Noriega, who holds the real power in Panama through
his position as commander of the 15,000 soldiers and police.
Officials say the daily average of 35 ships has been passing
through the waterway throughout the months of unrest here.
   Some opposition leaders were frustrated Wednesday that the
strike had not loosened Noriega's grip on the bankrupt nation.
   ``We're well aware of the situation, that Gen. Noriega appears
unmoved by all the human suffering,'' Jose Mulino, an attorney,
told a news conference. ``We'll be considering new strategies. I'm
not sure what it will take.''
   Mulino is prominent in the National Civic Crusade, an alliance
of about 200 professional, business, labor and other groups formed
last June to lead the campaign against Noriega.
   He and other opposition leaders vowed to continue the strike.
   In a clear attempt to dramatize its cause, the alliance
sponsored a Roman Catholic funeral Mass on Wednesday for a young
private security guard killed by a shotgun blast during riots
rioting last Saturday.
   The site of the Mass, the Church of Christ the King, was not the
dead man's parish but has been the scene of several clashes between
Noriega's opponents and supporters.
   After hearing the victim eulogized as a ``young man who died for
patriotism,'' more than 100 people stood at the church entrance and
chanted ``Justice!'' and ``Noriega, your end is near!''
   About 300 people, including several directors of the Civic
Crusade, attended the Mass, along with more than 100 journalists.
   There was no disturbance.
   Officials of the Panamanian Committee for Human Rights say
Alcibiades Vasquez, 24, was killed by a pro-government paramilitary
squad.
   His death was the first in a nearly a month of often violent
civil unrest that began after President Eric Arturo Delvalle tried
to fire Noriega on Feb. 25 and was dismissed the next day. The
United States still recognizes Delvalle, who is in hiding in Panama.
   Churches throughout Panama have started soup kitchens to feed
the destitute. The Catholic welfare agency Caritas said it is
feeding 6,000 families in poor neighborhoods around the capital
with donated supplies.
   Civic Crusade leaders joined Delvalle in appealing for donations
of food from abroad through the Catholic church or international
relief agencies.
   ``I am very concerned and fear for the health and lives of many
Panamanians,'' Delvalle said in a videotaped message from his place
of hiding.
   He has not appeared in public since the legislature dismissed
him on orders from Noriega.
   Another leading opposition figure, Ricardo Arias Calderon, is
expected to try to enter the country Thursday after four weeks of
forced exile in Miami.
   Arias, head of the Christian Democratic Party and a presidential
aspirant, was denied entry when he returned from a business trip on
the day Delvalle was ousted.
   Hundreds of party faithful are expected at the Panama City
airport. Several Central American legislators plan to accompany him
as a guarantee of safety.
   Panama's economy, already hampered by a $4.8 billion foreign
debt, started disintegrating when Delvalle's dismissal caused a run
on the banks. They were closed in early March and the cash shortage
was aggravated by U.S. economic sanctions.

<HEAD>One Drug Charge Against John Zaccaro Jr. is Dropped</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RUTLAND, Vt. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge has dismissed one of two drug
charges against John Zaccaro Jr., the son of 1984 vice presidential
candidate Geraldine Ferraro.
   District Judge Francis McCaffrey ruled Monday there is
insufficient evidence to support a charge of possession of cocaine
with intent to sell.
   McCaffrey also said defense attorneys cannot claim at trial that
Zaccaro was a victim of selective prosecution because it does not
relate to guilt or innocence.
   Zaccaro was arrested in 1986 in a raid of his home and car while
attending Middlebury College. His trial on a charge of sale of a
regulated drug is scheduled to begin April 4.
   McCaffrey in 1986 had ruled inadmissible eight grams of cocaine
and records of drug transactions seized by police from Zaccaro's
car. The judge said at the time that the search warrant was based
on insufficient evidence.
   Addison County State's Attorney John Quinn argued he could prove
the possession charge based on the observations of undercover state
Trooper Laura Manning.
   But McCaffrey disagreed, saying, ``There is no evidence ... to
show that the other packets observed by Manning contained cocaine.''

<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Egypt warned Wednesday it will consider any
Israeli attack on Saudi Arabia's new intermediate-range missile
launchers an attack on Egypt itself. Other Arab nations issued
similar warnings.
   Egypt, the only Arab state that has diplomatic relations with
Israel, accused the Jewish state of violating international laws by
demanding that Saudi Arabia remove the missiles, which are capable
of carrying nuclear warheads and of reaching Israel.
   In Amman, chairman Sharifuddin Pir Zadeh of the Organization of
Islamic Conference said the group also would support Saudi Arabia.
His statement echoed similar declarations of support by Syria and
Jordan, which said they would consider any attack on Saudi Arabia
an attack on them.
   They pledged to help the Saudis militarily if necessary.
   ``I am sending a cable to King Fahd supporting his Moslem
kingdom and our Saudi brothers against the Israeli threats,'' Pir
Zadeh said.
   Pir Zadeh was in the Jordanian capital for a meeting of foreign
ministers of the Islamic Conference. He said conference members
would support the Saudis ``morally and, if necessary, militarily.''
   Saudi Arabia recently acquired Chinese CSS-2 missiles, which
have a range of 2,200 miles. They are capable of being fitted with
nuclear warheads, but the Saudis have denied this will be done.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir of Israel said Tuesday that his
country and the United States were ``making efforts to deal with .
.. (the) grave development.'' He did not elaborate.
   Israel radio on Sunday quoted a close Shamir aide, Yossi Ben
Aharon as saying Israel had a reputation of not waiting until
potential dangers became actual ones, apparently a reference to
Israel's 1981 air raid against a nuclear reactor under construction
in Iraq. Shamir said Ben Aharon denied making the statement.
   Egypt warned it will deal with any Israeli attack on Saudi
missile launchers ``strongly and with firmness.''
   Official Cairo television broadcast the warning, attributed to a
responsible source, as the first item of the main evening newscast.
It was later carried by the Middle East News Agency.
   ``Egypt reiterates that it considers any attack on Saudi Arabia
an attack on itself which must be dealt with strongly and with
firmness and the offender will have to bear the responsiblity for
this attack,'' the source was quoted as saying.

<HEAD>House Panel Cuts Deeply In Reagan's Star Wars Budget Request</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM AHERN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the year's first defense spending vote, a
House subcommittee decided Wednesday to cut deeply into President
Reagan's budget request for his Star Wars anti-missile research
project, according to congressional sources.
   The Armed Services research and development subcommittee also
increased spending for the Midgetman nuclear-tipped missile and
sharply reduced the planned budget for deploying MX atomic weapons
aboard trains, said the sources, who spoke only on condition of
anonymity.
   The committee met behind closed doors to make the decisions.
   The votes by the subcommittee were the first step in the lengthy
congressional budgeting process. The full Armed Services Committee
will later consider its subcommittee actions before sending the
Pentagon budget bill to the floor of the full House. The same
procedure will also be followed in the Senate.
   The overall Pentagon budget for the 1989 fiscal year will be
$299 billion, a figure set by the White House and Congress last
December during negotiations aimed at reducing the federal budget
deficit.
   Reagan had sought $4.5 billion in Pentagon spending for Star
Wars, known formally as the Strategic Defense Initiative.
   But the subcommittee approved a $3.7 billion figure, which would
be an increase of only 3 percent over the current Star Wars budget,
the sources said.
   The fight over the Midgetman and the MX involves a pair of
nuclear-tipped weapons which have been at the heart of a
long-running dispute between the Reagan administration and the
Democratic-controlled Congress.
   Congressional Democrats support the single warhead Midgetman
while the Air Force wants to build more than the 50 of the
10-warhead MX weapons allowed by Congress. The second 50 MX weapons
would be based, two each, aboard 25 trains that would be housed on
western military bases until a crisis.
   Reagan had wanted $1 billion for the two programs, including
$800 million for study of the rail-basing plan, while the budget
contained $200 million for Midgetman. That latter total was enough
to keep the program alive until the president who succeeds Reagan
can make a final decision on the dispute, according to Defense
Secretary Frank C. Carlucci.
   As it worked through the budget, the subcommittee rejected a
Republican-backed plan to spend $650 million for MX railroad basing
plans and another $350 million for Midgetman, according to the
sources.
   Then, the panel turned down a Democratic-proposed plan to spend
$500 million for Midgetman and nothing for the MX.
   Finally, the panel agreed to split the $1 billion figure, giving
$500 million for research into each weapon.

<TEXT>
   President Reagan marked the fifth anniversary
of his plan for a Star Wars missile defense system on Wednesday by
asserting that the high-tech program is an incentive to U.S.-Soviet
arms control efforts.
   In a written statement issued the same day he announced a date
for his fourth summit with Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev,
Reagan lauded the missile shield proposal, known formally as the
Strategic Defense Initiative, as ``vital to our future security.''
   ``We must recognize that we live in an imperfect, often violent
world, one in which ballistic missile technology is proliferating
despite our efforts to prevent this,'' Reagan said. ``We would be
doing a grave and dangerous disservice to future generations if we
assumed that national leaders everywhere, for all time, will be
both peaceful and rational.''
   The president warned, as he has many times, that the Soviets
``not only are ahead of us in ballistic missiles, but also are
deeply engaged in their own SDI-like program. If they are allowed
to keep their near-monopoly in defenses, we will be left without an
effective means to protect our cherished freedoms in the future.''
   The president announced his proposal for the missile shield
defense program on March 23, 1983.
   ``I put forward the vision of ... a future free from the threat
of the most dangerous weapon mankind has invented: fast-flying
ballistic missiles,'' Reagan recalled in his statement.
   Reagan, who has staunchly defended the plan despite Soviet
efforts to curb it and congressional efforts to cut its funding,
said it had ``provided a valuable incentive for the Soviets to
return to the bargaining table and to negotiate seriously over
strategic arms reductions.''
   ``And as we move toward lower levels of offense, it will be all
the more important to have an effective defense,'' Reagan argued.
   The president has repeatedly insisted, however, that he will not
use SDI as a bargaining chip in negotiations with the Soviets.
   Reagan, following an Oval Office meeting with Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard Shevardnadze, announced he will go to Moscow from
May 29 to June 2 for his fourth meeting with Gorbachev.
   The highlight of the summitt was intended to be the signing of a
treaty to slash the superpowers' long-range strategic weapons, but
Reagan has suggested that the agreement will not be ready due to
time limitations.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the issue of SDI did
not come up in Wednesday's meetings between U.S. and Soviet
officials at the White House.
   In his statement, Reagan said the high-tech program now faces
problems that ``are largely political.''
   Congress has cut funds for the program every year, Reagan said,
asserting this has put the program ``one to two years'' behind
schedule.
   Capitol Hill slashed Reagan's 1988 request for the program from
$5.6 billion to $3.9 billion. He is seeking $4.6 billion in 1989.
   In the year's first defense spending vote, a House subcommittee
decided Wednesday to cut deeply into Reagan's budget request for
Star Wars, approving $3.7 billion, which would be an increase of
only 3 percent over the current Star Wars budget, according to
congressional sources speaking on condition of anonymity. The
request will later go to the full House Armed Services Committee,
and later to the full House.

   Senate Republicans succeeded Wednesday in
delaying any votes on a bill to require the government to warn
millions of workers they risk cancer and other diseases from job
exposure to hazardous substances.
   Democratic supporters of the ``High Risk Occupational Disease
Notificiation and Prevention Act'' were unable to break off lengthy
orations by opponents led by Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, aimed a
preventing a vote on the bill.
   In a key test vote, the bill's chief author, Sen. Howard
Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, was able to muster only 33 of the 60 Senate
votes necessary to limit further debate to 30 hours.
   The legislation is aimed at what the National Institute of
Occupational Safety and Health says are the one in every four
Americans who have been exposed to carcinogens or other hazardous
substances on the job, most of them unware of it.
   Metzenbaum and other supporters of the bill on Wednesday put
together what he said were ``weakening amendments'' aimed at
diminishing opposition from farmers and small businesses before
making another attempt to limit debate on Thursday.
   Hatch, however, prevented votes on the amendments, as well,
holding control of the Sente floor for hours, but saying he might
allow their consideration on Thursday.
   ``I don't consider this a filibuster,'' Hatch said. ``A
filibuster is reading from the phone book. This is a discussion
that is very necessary. This bill could cost taxpayers and
consumers millions or billions of dollars.''
   Later Wednesday, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., chairman of
the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee, substituted the
bill entirely with a new version including several weakening
amendments on which Hatch had been blocking action.
   The new version effectively exempts companies with less than 50
workers and farms from having to continue to pay wages and benefits
for up to a year to workers ordered off the job because of the
danger continued hazardous exposure would raise for them.
   It also puts restrictions on what information from the program
that workers and former workers could use in pursuing liability
suits against employers and places a $250 ceiling on the medical
monitoring expenses that companies would have to pay for each
covered worker.
   ``Do we have a `For Sale' sign on the legislation so that you
keep watering it down until you get enough votes to pass it?''
Hatch asked rhetorically, calling Kennedy's action a
``reprehensible tactic.''
   Democrats admitted that Kennedy's parliamentary maneuver,
although allowed by Senate rules, could be used to keep Repubicans
from offering amendments of their own. But they maintained that was
not the intent.
   Democratic Leader Robert C. Byrd acknowledged the ``unfairness
that has been circumstantially brought about ... with no malicious
intent.''
   Because of that, Byrd said that on Thursday he would vote
against his own motion that was part of a second attempt to bring
an end to the Republican delaying tactics.
   Metzenbaum, attempting to salvage the measure in what appears to
be a swell of opposition to it, said he would urge fellow
supporters to also vote against putting a limit on the GOP delay
tactics.
   A similar bill was passed by the House on a 225-186, largely
party-line vote last October despite vehement opposition from the
Reagan administration.
   Unions have been seeking the legislation for the past four
years, contending the administration effectively had ``defanged''
the Occupational Safety and Health Administration from protecting
workers from hazards.
   Over the past two years, Metzenbaum had succeeded in winning
support for the bill from several trade groups and corporations,
including the Chemical Manufacturers Association, the American
Electronics Association, IBM, General Electric, Occidental
Petroleum and W.R. Grace and Co.
   But hundreds of other business groups, led by the National
Association of Manufacturers and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce,
remained opposed to the measure in any form.
   Jerry Jasinowki, the NAM's chief economist, called the
legislation a ``ticking time bomb'' that could subject employers up
to billions of dollars in lawsuits each year from workers and
former workers that the government identifies as being at risk to
occupational diseases.
   The bill would set up a panel of seven scientists in the
Department of Health and Human Services to identify hazards and the
groups at risk from exposure to them.
   The National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health would
then be required to send individual notices to between 100,000 and
300,000 individuals every year, and employers would be required to
provide medical monitoring programs for each.

   Iran accused Iraq on Wednesday of using
poison gas against civilians and warned it might retaliate with its
own chemical weapons, and the United States urged a U.N. Security
Council protest.
   The International Committee of the Red Cross called the use of
chemical weapons a ``new and tragic escalation'' in the 7{-year-old
war between Iran and Iraq.
   Also Wednesday, Iranian gunboats attacked a Cypriot freighter in
the Persian Gulf, leaving it in flames, and Iran fired six missiles
into Iraqi cities.
   Iraq claimed a number of civilians were killed or wounded by an
Iranian missile fired into Iraq's capital, Baghdad.
   Iranian Prime Minister Hussein Musavi claimed Iraqi troops
killed 5,000 Iraqi Kurds with poison gas last week after their home
villages and towns were ``liberated'' by Iranian troops fighting
with the autonomy-seeking Kurds. He called the use of poison gas
``one of the greatest crimes of the Middle East.''
   ``It depends on international measures taken to stop these Iraqi
crimes,'' Musavi was quoted as saying by Iran's official Islamic
Republic News Agency, monitored in Cyprus.
   Western journalists who toured the affected area in northeast
Iraq and the hospitals where victims were taken corroborated the
claims.
   Iran's War Information Minister Kamal Kharazi said Iran may
retaliate with its own chemical weapons if the U.N. Security
Council does not condemn Iraq for its use of such weapons.
   Iraq has denied using chemical weapons.
   The International Committee of the Red Cross said in Geneva that
it had taken urgent steps to end such attacks and had informed Iran
``of its readiness to provide emergency assistance for the
victims.''
   In Washington, the State Department urged the U.N. Security
Council to mount an international protest.
   ``This incident appears to be a particularly grave violation of
the 1925 Geneva protocol against chemical warfare,'' said spokesman
Charles E. Redman. He said there was also evidence Iran may have
fired chemical artillery shells against Iraq.
   ``We call upon Iran and Iraq to desist immediately from any
further use of chemical weapons, which are an offense to
civilization and humanity,'' Redman said.
   Refering to film footage on American television showing victims
of the alleged attacks, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told
reporters: ``We condemn the use of chemical warfare and gas use by
anybody, anywhere at any time.
   ``I saw, everyone in the administration saw, the same reports
you saw last night. They were horrible, outrageous, disgusting and
should serve as a reminder to all countries of why chemical warfare
should be banned.''
   The Kuwaiti-bound Cypriot freighter, identified as the
34,346-ton Odysseas H, was struck about 10 miles west of the Strait
of Hormuz as it entered the gulf with a shipment of barley from
Tarragona, Spain.
   The master issued a distress call at 4:45 p.m., saying two
gunboats had raided his vessel and set it ablaze, according to
gulf-based shipping executives who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Two salvage tugboats that rushed to the scene brought the flames
under control by nightfall, and there were no reported injuries.
The extent of damage to the cargo was not immediately known.
   About the same time and in the same vicinity, an Iranian frigate
challenged the Saudi Abha, a 42,600-ton vessel laden with motor
vehicles for Saudi Arabia. The vessel, which flies the Singapore
flag, is operated by the national Shipping Co. of Riyadh.
   The sources said that the Saudi Abha was told to wait for an
Iranian boarding party to check the cargo.
   Interception of commercial vessels sailing through the Strait of
Hormuz, the sole entryway to the gulf, is common practice by
Iranian gunboats looking for Iraqi-bound cargo to confiscate.
   Iran has struck nine vessels in the last week.
   The Iraqi News Agency reported that the latest missile lobbed by
Iran at Baghdad crashed at 7:30 a.m. into a residential
neighorhood, ``killing and wounding civilians and destroying
property.''
   It said Iraqi gunners fired a similar projectile into Tehran on
Tuesday.
   The Iranian news agency said five other misiles were fired at
``economic and military centers'' in the Iraqi towns of Basra and
Karnaqin.
   Iraq has fired more than 100 missiles against Iran and Iran has
fired more than 60 at Iraq this month.
   The Netherlands announced that it is planning to withdraw one of
its two mine hunters from the Western European force protecting
commercial shipping in the gulf. Diplomatic sources cited
assessments by Western security analysts that the mine threat has
diminished.

<TEXT>
   A little-known, 33-year-old GOP leader will run
against Edward M. Kennedy in the fall for the Senate seat Kennedy
has held without serious challenge since 1962, the Republican state
chairman said Wednesday.
   Joseph Malone of Waltham, executive director of the
Massachusetts GOP, will challenge Kennedy, said party Chairman Ray
Shamie, who himself declined a request from President Reagan last
week that he take on Kennedy a second time.
   The Kennedy campaign insisted the five-term Democrat will ``take
nothing for granted,'' and will wage a statewide grassroots
campaign.
   In Washington, B.J. Cooper, a deputy White House press
secretary, said the White House had no comment on Shamie's decision.
   Shamie aide Charles Manning said that Malone represented a new
generation of Republicans and that as a Catholic of Italian
descent, Malone would be a departure from the Yankee-Protestant
line of New England Republicans.
   Malone will have neither the name recognition nor the cash of
Shamie, who sold a high tech business three years ago for more than
$60 million.
   Kennedy, 56, was first elected for an interim term from 1962 to
1964, filling the seat once held by his brother John. He went on to
victories against a succession of old-line Republicans like George
Cabot Lodge and Josiah Spaulding.
   A 1978 graduate of Harvard College, Malone has helped operate a
family trucking business and also is a partner in family real
estate holdings.
   ``I have devoted 10 years of my life working to help bring back
a two-party system to Massachusetts,'' Malone said in an interview.
``It's important that we have a strong, aggressive campaign in
Massachusetts.''
   State Democratic Party Chairman Chester Atkins said Malone is
too closely tied to Shamie to present himself as a ``new
generation'' Republican.
   ``If the people wouldn't accept the real thing in Ray Shamie, it
will be even harder still for them to accept his understudy,'' he
said.
   Shamie, 67, launched his political career in 1982 by investing
$1.8 million, mostly of his own money, in a Kennedy challenge.
While he lost in a landslide _ 61 percent to 38 percent _ it was
also the best finish by a Republican against Kennedy.

<HEAD>Dean Says Students Acted On Their Own In `Spying' For Dealers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MORGANTOWN, W.Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Students at West Virginia University
who passed on to Caterpillar Co. confidential information gathered
during a class exercise acted on their own, after grades were
issued, dean said Wednesday.
   The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday that Professor Terry
Wilson, who did consulting work for Caterpillar, had students
gather information on rival heavy-equipment businesses as part of a
class exercise.
   Several current or former WVU graduate students told the Journal
they then released the information to two Caterpillar dealers. The
students charged they felt pressure to do so, in part because of
Wilson's connection to Caterpillar.
   ``We were worried about getting through the course,'' Mark
Wheatley told the Journal. Wheatley no longer attends the
university and is not listed in the Morgantown telephone directory.
   Whatever the students might have done, was done after their
grades were issued, said Cyril M. Logar, dean of WVU's College of
Business and Economics. ``What their grade was based on was all
legitimate,'' he said.
   Wheatley and some other students in Wilson's marketing class
were assigned to do work for the two Caterpillar dealerships _ H.O.
Penn Machinery Co. in Armonk, N.Y., and Yancey Bros. in Atlanta _
last spring as part of a project designed to give them practical
experience.
   At the two dealerships' direction, the graduate students
obtained inventory and sales volume reports on those dealers'
competitors, according to the newspaper.
   During the survey, those in the class identified themselves only
as university students, not mentioning their link to the
Caterpillar dealers, and promised that information would remain
confidential, the Journal reported.
   But that promise was broken, students said, and former student
Herman Flinder, who has since returned to his home in Norway,
likened the work to ``spying.''
   Wilson did not return phone calls to his home and office
Wednesday. The professor told the Journal the exercise was good for
students but added that he will no longer assign similar projects.
   Spokesmen for both equipment dealers denied asking the students
to do anything unethical.
   ``It was my understanding that the information would be made
available to all the participants,'' said Goodloe Yancy IV, general
manager of Yancy Bros. ``There are situational ethics involved. At
no time were any of the students told to compromise their personal
ethics.
   ``They chose whatever path they chose,'' he said.
   Milton Long, marketing manager for H.O. Penn, said he never
asked for or received the names of competitors used in the study.
   Logar said that Wilson, who is on sababatical, would be told to
boost the emphasis on ethics in the curriculum.

   Heavy snow and wind gusting to 89 mph chilled the Northwest on
Wednesday, while the mercury in Michigan and Ohio hit record highs
and most of the rest of the nation had sunny skies.
   Eighteen inches of snow fell overnight across Stevens Pass in
the Oregon Cascades, and a heavy snow warning remained in effect in
the northern Cascades of Oregon during the afternoon. Advisories
for snow also were posted in the Washington Cascades and Olympic
mountains, as well as the southern Cascades of Oregon.
   As the storm system moved eastward, a winter storm warning was
posted for Wednesday night and Thursday in the northern and central
mountains of Colorado.
   Gusts were clocked at 89 mph in Reno, Nev., in the morning, but
no serious damage was reported. In Idaho, winds gusted to 58 miles
at Twin Falls and 54 mph at Idaho Falls, and thunderstorms and hail
also were reported.
   Gale warnings extended along the northern Pacific Coast through
the afternoon.
   Warnings or advisories for high winds were posted from the
Sierra Nevadas of California and much of inland Southern
California, to parts of Washington, Nevada, Arizona, Wyoming and
Colorado.
   It was springtime in Michigan and seemed like summer in Ohio.
The temperature at Lansing, Mich., hit 69, tying the record for the
date, while in Alpena, Mich., the thermometer hit 61, breaking the
record by one degree.
   In southeastern Ohio, Chesapeake reported 79 degrees. The
73-degree mark in Toledo broke a record of 72 set in 1945.
   Rain and occasional thunderstorms continued over the Pacific
Northwest into the afternoon, with snow showers in the Idaho
Panhandle and western Wyoming.
   Showers and thunderstorms also extended over western Louisiana.
Afternoon skies were sunny in much of the remainder of the nation.
   There were no reports of measurable snowfall during the six
hours ending at 1 p.m. EST. Heavier rainfall during the period
included 0.37 inch at Newport, Ore., and Olympia, Wash.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 31
degrees at Limestone, Maine, to 87 degrees at Palm Springs, Calif.
The early-morning low for the nation was 3 degrees above zero at
Montpelier, Vt.
   The forecast for Thursday called for snow in the Rockies. Rain,
possibly including severe thunderstorms, was predicted across the
Plains and much of the Missouri, Mississippi and Ohio valleys,
stretching as far as Alabama. There will also be rain in northern
Maine and the northern Pacific Coast.
   High temperatures will be in the upper 30s and 40s in the upper
Great Lakes and Mississippi Valley, the Dakotas, the Rockies, and
northern Maine; in the 50s and 60s from southern Maine across
Maryland, the lower Great Lakes region, the central Mississippi
Valley, middle Plains and the northern half of the Pacific Coast;
the low 80s in western Florida and from western Louisiana across to
southern Arizona, and in the 70s in most of the rest of the nation.

   The jury in the ``preppie murder'' trial of a
man accused of strangling a teen-ager during sex in Central Park
deliberated a seventh day Wednesday, rehearing testimony about the
autopsy on the woman.
   The jury was interested in the internal injuries revealed by the
autopsy performed by Dr. Maria Alandy, associate medical examiner
in New York City. She testified about injuries to Jennifer Levin's
mouth, neck, head and internal organs.
   The jury deliberated until early evening and will return
Thursday morning.
   The jurors apparently were trying to discern how badly Miss
Levin, 18, was beaten and how much physical force it would take to
cause the injuries. A day earlier, their request focused on how
long Miss Levin had to be choked to produce pinpoint hemorrhaging
on her eyelids.
   The prosecution contends Robert Chambers punched Miss Levin
before strangling her in a rage. The defense contends the death was
accidentally caused when he yanked her backward during rough sex,
as Chambers said in a videotaped statement to police.
   After the reading of the testimony, jurors spent several minutes
sitting in the jury box speaking with one another before returning
to deliberations, which is highly unusual.
   Chambers, 21, is accused of second-degree murder in the death of
Miss Levin on Aug. 26, 1986.
   The jury, which got the case last Thursday, could also convict
Chambers of the lesser crimes of first- or second-degree
manslaughter or criminally negligent homicide.

   The Commerce Department said Wednesday that
Safeway Stores Inc. has agreed to pay a $995,000 penalty to settle
anti-boycott violations in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait last year.
   Undersecretary Paul Freedenberg said the sum was ``the largest
civil fine in the department's 10-year enforcement of federal
anti-boycott laws.'' Under the department order, Safeway has 20
days to pay the fine.
   The anti-boycott provisions of the Export Administration Act
were designed to keep U.S. firms from participation in foreign
boycotts the U.S. government does not sanction.
   The supermarket chain was charged in July 1987 with multiple
violations in connection with operations of supermarkets in Saudi
Arabia and Kuwait, including refusing to do business with U.S.
suppliers on a Saudi Arabia boycott list and using a ``whitelist''
of approved suppliers from which it offered products for sale to
Arab supermarkets.
   Safeway was also accused of furnishing prohibited information to
Kuwait about its business relationships with Israel and furnishing
prohibited information about its affiliations with charitable and
fraternal organizations which support Israel.
   Safeway neither admitted or denied the allegations but agreed to
pay the civil fine in a settlement March 14, the Commerce
Department said.
   Had the case gone to trial, and the supermarket chain found
guilty on all counts, Safeway could have received an administrative
sanction and a civil fine of $4.5 million, the department said.
   A Safeway spokesman did not immediately return a reporter's
phone calls seeking comment.

   U.S. District Judge Walter L.
Nixon of Mississippi reported to federal prison Wednesday to begin
serving a five-year sentence for perjury.
   Nixon, 59, is the second federal judge convicted of crimes while
in office. He has refused to step down and continues to draw his
$89,500 annual salary.
   Last week, House Judiciary Chairman Peter W. Rodino Jr., D-N.J.,
introduced a resolution to impeach him.
   Nixon was convicted in 1986 of lying to a grand jury
investigating whether he tried to influence a local drug case
involving the son of man with whom he had business dealings. He was
sentenced to two concurrent five-year terms.
   The U.S. Supreme Court on Jan. 19 refused to review Nixon's
appeal.
   The first federal judge convicted in office, Harry E. Claiborne
of Nevada, was impeached and removed 1{ years ago. He was convicted
of tax evasion.

   The
Iraqi air force has begun using a second type of Soviet-built
bomber on its forays against Iranian oil shipping in the Persian
Gulf, U.S. naval officers said Wednesday.
   The supersonic TU-22, a twin-jet aircraft known in NATO's
military lexicon as Blinder, apparently carries only iron bombs
instead of the air-to-surface missiles that are on Iraq's other
attack aircraft in the gulf.
   The U.S. officers, who spoke on condition of not being
identified, also said Blinders operating over the gulf fly at about
450 mph. That is faster than other Iraqi warplanes but less than
the aircraft's top speed of 900 mph.
   One officer said it was possible that the Blinders were flying
training missions to prepare for regular action against Iranian
tankers.
   This guided-missile frigate observed several of the Soviet
bombers in action during a recent 14-day assignment in the northern
gulf.
   The officers wouldn't indicate whether the flights began before
or after a visit to Baghdad by an American military delegation last
month. The meeting was set up to discuss the problem of Iraqi
aircraft flying down the gulf in a manner that appeared to pose a
threat to U.S. warships.
   The talks were known to have dealt with flights by Iraq's
French-built F-1 Mirages and Soviet-made T-16 Badgers, both of
which are armed with anti-ship missiles.
   Many U.S. officers have expressed concern that the flight
patterns of the Iraqi aircraft could lead to another mistaken
attack such as that which devastated the frigate Stark last May 17,
killing 37 of its crew.
   As the Roberts sailed toward the Strait of Hormuz on Tuesday, an
Iraqi warplane ventured further ``down the pipe'' than usual _
posing no threat. But far enough for a call from the ship's combat
information center to interrupt the skipper's dinner.
   The plane veered eastward toward Iran before it reached the
point at which Cmdr. Paul X. Rinn said he would have ordered a
precautionary increase in alert status.
   On Wednesday, the Roberts went to what Rinn called a ``modified
condition zebra,'' an upgrading of damage-control precautions, when
it entered waters about 20 miles from Abu Musa, a small island that
Iran uses as a base for gunboat attacks on gulf shipping.
   U.S. military sources in Washington say Iran has recently begun
installing launch platforms for its Chinese-made Silkworm anti-ship
missiles on the island.
   Rinn, a native New Yorker who now lives in Summerville, S.C.,
told members of a Pentagon news media poll that there has been no
change in Navy procedures around Abu Musa, and there was no
evidence of the Silkworms having been placed on the island.
   ``We've always been careful around Abu Musa because it's a base
for the Iranian speedboats,'' he said.
   Iranian gunboats, on the lookout for war-related materials bound
for archenemy Iraq, were heard conducting their usual challenges of
commercial vessels as to their cargoes and destinations.

<HEAD>Government, Rebel Group Reach Peace Agreement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A major rebel group appears ready to sign
a peace agreement drafted during a week of talks in northern
Uganda, the government newspaper and sources said Wednesday.
   Ugandan soldiers and the rebel Uganda People's Democratic Army
have observed a cease-fire since negotiations began last Thursday
at Gulu, a town 170 miles north of Kampala, the government paper
New Vision reported.
   ``We are coming out fully to join the government,'' said Mike
Kilama, chief rebel negotiator. ``We are coming to join hands with
the NRA to work and rebuild our nation.''
   Uganda's army is called the National Resistance Army, the name
Yoweri Museveni gave it during a five-year bush war that gained him
the presidency two years ago.
   A proposal drafted in the negotiations says the army will accept
rebels who are found not to have taken part in atrocities under
previous regimes, sources reported.
   Reports from the sources and in New Vision said the agreement
excludes politicians. Among them are Otema Allimadi, who was prime
minister under former President Milton Obote and directed the rebel
army from London.
   New Vision said the peace agreement was to be signed within days
and the rebels were assembling at Lukome, 8 miles north of Gulu.
   They consist almost entirely of soldiers from the previous
national army, which Museveni's forces drove into southern Sudan at
the end of the civil war. The rebel army began its insurgency in
August 1986.
   Rebel spokesmen say there are 7,000 insurgents, but the
government puts the strength at 3,000. More than half a dozen rebel
groups operate in Uganda, but the Uganda People's Democratic Army
is the most professional.
   Museveni declared a six-month amnesty in which rebels would be
allowed to surrender. It expires at the end of March, and Museveni
said Tuesday he was reluctant to extend it.

   Troops detained hundreds of Arabs in a huge
crackdown to contain four months of unrest in the occupied lands,
and Israeli jets bombed Palestinian guerrilla bases in south
Lebanon Wednesday for the second time in a week.
   Overnight raids which went into Wednesday morning were Israel's
latest strategy for ending a rebellion which, by U.N. count, has
killed 107 Arabs and one Israeli soldier.
   Arab reports said about 500 Palestinians were rounded up.
Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin said 3,000 have been detained since
riots began Dec. 8 in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Israeli troops in Gaza shot and wounded an Arab protester in
Jabaliya refugee camp, Shifa Hospital officials said. They said
another Arab from Deir Al Balah camp was badly hurt with beating
injuries to his head.
   The number of major demonstrations and clashes has fallen
dramatically in recent days and Rabin credited Israel's tough
policies of mass arrests and economic sanctions.
   ``The phenomenon of large violent demonstrations has been
substantially reduced ... as a result of the general activity of
the army, the security forces, the riot police,'' Rabin told
officers on a tour of Gaza. ``We feel a certain tiredness among the
(Arab) population.''
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said simply restoring quiet was
not enough.
   ``No doubt, it is possible to turn the situation back to normal
and even a better one,'' Shamir said Wednesday on Israel
Television. ``But I think it's not enough today to restore order
and normal life. We have to prepare ground so this does not repeat
itself.''
   ``There are things to be done to prevent the return of these
dangerous events,'' he said, without elaborating.
   Nearly all the 107 Palestinians killed died by Israeli army
gunfire or beatings. The Israeli soldier was shot to death by an
Arab last weekend.
   India protested Israel's handling of the Arab rebellion by
canceling a match in Israel by its Davis Cup tennis team scheduled
for next month. It was the first such cancellation of a sports or
entertainment event.
   Gad Yacobi, Israel's economy minister, said the violence and
strikes have cost Israel more than $335 million in lost production,
exports and added security expenses. He said the figure did not
include losses to tourism and agriculture.
   In the air raid, Israeli pilots destroyed buildings used by
guerrillas to store weapons and equipment near Sidon, a port in
south Lebanon, the military said. It was the fourth Israeli air
raid in Lebanon this year.
   The army did not identify a guerrilla group, but Beirut radio
stations said the warehouses belonged to Yasser Arafat's
Palestinian guerrilla group Fatah and Lebanese Moslem militias.
   Shamir reported to the 10-member inner Cabinet on his talks in
Washington. A minister who attended said Shamir had found no signs
the United States would yield to Israeli requests for changes in
its Middle East peace proposals, which involve trading territory
for peace.
   The army said it might allow Israelis to volunteer for three to
six months of paid reserve duty in addition to annual compulsory
duty. Last week, the army increased the compulsory tour from 42
days to 50.
   According to the Arab-run Palestinie Press Service and Arabic
daily Al Quds, soldiers detained about 500 Palestinians overnight,
including 200 from Hebron and the nearby West Bank village of Dura.
   Palestinian witnesses said the army sealed off villages and
refugee camps after midnight, then went from house to house with
lists of names. The Arab news agency said 80 people were arrested
in Attil, 12 miles north of Nablus.
   Army spokesmen confirmed mass arrests overnight but would not
give numbers.
   An Israeli official said Rabin told a parliamentary committee
Israel has jailed 3,000 Arabs since Dec. 8, including 700 since
Sunday.
   He said, on condition of anonymity, that 1,000 more Arabs had
been arrested and released. The official also confirmed a report in
the daily Haaretz that the army planned to put 300 Arabs under
administrative detention, meaning they could be jailed for up to
six months without trial.
   A Palestine Liberation Organization leaflet circulated in the
Gaza Strip said payments will be made to Arabs who lose family
members, property or jobs because of clashes with Israeli soldiers.
   It cited $2,900 for ``martyrs'' killed fighting soldiers, $600
for anyone arrested and $1,450 for a merchant unable to open his
store because of a strike. Arab policemen who resigned would get
$1,450 as a first payment, the leaflet said.
   Israel had imposed rules limiting the flow of money into the
territories in an attempt to prevent such compensation and other
PLO financing of the rebellion.

<HEAD>House Panel Won't Seek Perjury Charges Against IBP Chairman</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A House subcommittee has decided against
seeking perjury charges against the chairman of the nation's
largest meatpacker for testifying falsely last year that only one
set of injury records was kept at its Dakota City, Neb.,
packinghouse.
   Rep. Tom Lantos, D-Calif., chairman of the House Government
Operations Committee's subcommittee on employment and housing, said
that although the testimony by IBP Corp. Chairman Robert Peterson
was misleading, the panel will not ask the Justice Department to
prosecute him.
   Peterson, testifying before the panel last May, denied charges
from the United Food and Commercial Workers union that the company
was keeping two sets of injury logs _ one for internal use and the
other to be shown to government inspectors _ at its Dakota City
plant.
   Afterwards, the company sent the subcommittee a 28-page
statement again denying there were two sets of records. Later,
however, Peterson wrote Lantos a letter saying that he had learned
that two sets of logs were in fact kept.
   At a subsequent hearing last September, IBP officials said their
earlier testimony was based on misunderstandings between the
plant's medical director and a vice president of the company.
   ``While some of the explanations offered by top IBP officials
strained credibility or were incongruent and raised serious
questions, there is insufficient evidence to warrant referring the
matter to the Justice Department for perjury proceedings,'' Lantos
said Tuesday.
   He made the statement in presenting the subcommittee's report on
the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's handling of the
IBP case to the full 39-member Government Operations Committee.
   Committee officials said they expect that report to be released
within the next two weeks.
   IBP, then a subsidiary of Occidental Petroleum Co., and the UFCW
were engaged in a bitter lockout turned strike at the Dakota City
plant during the subcommittee's first hearing.
   As the result of proddings from the union, OSHA initiated a
thorough inspection of the plant and subsequently fined IBP more
than $2 million for a series of health, safety and record
violations.
   At the time, it was the largest fine ever levied by OSHA. IBP
has contested the OSHA charges and is appealing the fine.

<HEAD>Afghan Agreement Almost Complete, Except Two Vital Points</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Texts for an Afghan peace settlement have been
sent to lawyers for finishing touches but there still is no
agreement on two essential issues, sources close to the Geneva
negotiations said Wednesday.
   The sources said one question still open was whether the current
Afghan government or another would oversee implementation of the
deal. The other is the future of aid to Afghanistan from the Soviet
Union, which now has an estimated 115,000 soldiers in the country
helping fight Moslem insurgents.
   Moscow and its Communist allies in Kabul say both issues are
outside the scope of the Geneva talks and raising them with a third
country _ Pakistan in this case _ would constitute interference in
Afghanistan's internal affairs.
   Diego Cordovez, the U.N. mediator, was said to be confident a
third problem could be resolved by compromise language. That
problem arose last week when Abdul Wakil, the Afghan foreign
minister, accused Pakistan at a news conference of creating new
``complications'' by reviving an old border dispute.
   It concerns the Durand Line, a boundary between Afghanistan and
British India agreed upon in 1893. It was accepted by Pakistan
after independence in 1947, but Afghanistan claimed an area south
of the line.
   Pakistan's chief negotiator in Geneva, acting Foreign Minister
Zain Noorani, told reporters on the same day Wakil made his
allegations that his delegation ``never raised any question as to
the Pakistani-Afghan border.''
   He said the border was a ``non-issue'' and Pakistan accepts the
passage in the agreements requiring the parties ``to refrain from
violations of the existing internationally recognized boundary
between the two countries.''
   Pakistan acts as spokesman for the Afghan guerrillas.

   Gov. Evan Mecham's auto dealership would
have been overdrawn and unable to meet its payroll if he hadn't
borrowed $80,000 from a state fund, an accountant testified at
Mecham's impeachment trial Wednesday.
   The testimony contradicted Mecham's claim that he didn't need
the money and that he borrowed it in July solely to help the state
earn higher interest than it was receiving on the money.
   An accountant hired by the prosecution to analyze the financial
records of Mecham's company indicated the money was badly needed.
   ``Unless these funds had been paid from the protocol fund,
Mecham Pontiac would have had an overdraft the following Wednesday
in excess of $60,000,'' said Randall Sorensen, referring to the
payday following the loan.
   The Senate is investigating allegations Mecham misused the
funds, which were raised by his inaugural committee but transferred
to the protocol fund because of a state law barring use of such
contributions to pay campaign debts.
   Sorensen took the stand after former Mecham chief of staff James
Colter acknowledged he filled Mecham's request for the $80,000 loan
to his car dealership without checking the company's financial
condition.
   When Sen. Manuel Pena suggested to Colter, who left the Mecham
administration in the fall, that Mecham Pontiac was overencumbered
when the loan was taken, Colter said: ``If that's so, it's a bummer
deal. But it was repaid, so I guess it wasn't a bummer deal.''
   Prosecutor Paul Eckstein noted that Mecham testified before the
House that his company did not need the money to pay the bank for
overdue loans on cars.
   However, Sorensen said Mecham Pontiac paid First Interstate Bank
$81,309 owed for six cars on July 17, 1987 _ the same day that the
$80,000 loan was received.
   On cross-examination, Mecham's lawyer, Jerris Leonard, suggested
that the Mecham car dealership had assets that could have been
converted to cash when needed. But Sorensen said he saw no records
indicating such assets.
   Leonard also said the dealership had a net worth of $4.25
million. But Sorensen said some of the figures he saw indicated
otherwise. He did not elaborate.
   Prosecutors had said they would show that Mecham Pontiac was in
deep financial trouble and ``desperately needed the loan'' to
survive.
   In his statement Tuesday, Leonard said of Mecham's loan: ``The
governor is going to tell you he did it for one purpose and one
purpose only, to try to improve the earnings of the fund.''
   The governor's lawyers had objected vehemently to testimony
about the dealership's financial condition but were overruled.
   Before the trial recessed for the day, former Arizona Attorney
General Jack LaSoto testified that he analyzed state laws relating
to the Mecham loan and found it was improper.
   He said it was clear that money placed in the governor's
protocol fund became public money intended for promoting Arizona's
image.
   Also Wednesday, Mecham's former legislative aide testified she
quit because she was worried that ``people could possibly go to
jail'' if the loan was discovered.
   Donna Carlson, who was the subject of an alleged death threat
investigated earlier in the trial, testified she and other Mecham
staffers believed the fund could be used only to ``promote the
interests of the state of Arizona.''
   In addition to charges of obstructing the investigation of an
alleged threat against Ms. Carlson and of misusing state funds,
Mecham is accused in the impeachment trial of concealing a $350,000
campaign loan.
   Ms. Carlson described a conversation with Colter late last
summer which she said involved both loans.
   ``Mr. Colter was extremely upset,'' said Ms. Carlson. ``He said,
`I don't think the governor understands the magnitude of the debt.'
... He said, `I had to loan him $80,000 out of the protocol fund.'''
   ``I believe I came out of my chair,'' Ms. Carlson said. ``I made
a remark ... that people could possibly go to jail for something
like that.''
   Witnesses have said that Ms. Carlson was the subject of an
alleged death threat just before she was called to testify before a
grand jury about Mecham's campaign finances.
   The first-term Republican governor also faces an April 21
criminal trial on felony charges of concealing the campaign loan.
Mecham, the first U.S. governor to face an impeachment trial in six
decades, also faces a recall election May 17.
   During intensive quizzing by senators, Colter insisted he never
tried to cover up the protocol fund loan to the dealership even
though it was never recorded in the fund's check register.
   ``I'm a poor record-keeper,'' he said.

   An ominous warming of the atmosphere and
depletion of Earth's protective ozone shield have given urgency to
plans by NASA, Japan and Europe to launch four satellites to study
the planet's ecological system.
   The project ``will bring about a revolution in our understanding
of the Earth as a whole system,'' said Dixon Butler, project
scientist for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration,
which plans to spend more than $2 billion on its share.
   Instruments planned for the first satellite include a laser to
measure movement along faults such as the San Andreas in
California; radar that can by peer through clouds and vegetation,
and devices to measure wind speed and direction, air temperature
and humidity.
   Officials said the polar-orbiting satellites could improve
weather forecasts by allowing meteorologists to study developing
weather patterns worldwide.
   Other instruments also are scheduled to be placed on the space
station, which is set for operation in the mid-1990s, but the EOS
is being designed so it will work even if the space station is
delayed.
   The program recently moved into high gear because of ominous
changes in the Earth's atmosphere, Butler said Tuesday, speaking
via satellite to scientists at NASA centers across the country,
including the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena.
   The four satellites will operate for 15 years, and one of their
tasks will be to monitor the greenhouse effect, in which Earth's
temperature is gradually rising because of increased carbon dioxide
in the atmosphere, Butler said from NASA's Goddard Space Flight
Center in Greenbelt, Md.
   The satellites also will keep track of depletion of Earth's
protective ozone layer, he said.
   Scientists fear the greenhouse effect may cause crop failures
and raise sea levels, threating threaten coastal cities. Loss of
high-altitude ozone will let more harmful solar ultraviolet rays
reach Earth, increasing skin cancer and possibly killing
microscopic ocean organisms that are at the bottom of the food
chain, scientists say.
   NASA plans to launch its first EOS satellite, a 60-foot-long
spacecraft carrying 20 instruments, in 1995, followed by the launch
of a European Space Agency satellite in 1997. NASA's second
satellite could lift off in 1997, followed by a 1998 launch for the
fourth satellite, which would be Japanese.
   Butler said the Soviet Union, which has many satellites in polar
orbit, also may participate.
   NASA is asking for $20 million in next year's budget to
determine what instruments should be placed on the satellites, then
will seek money in 1991 to build the equipment, NASA spokesman
Charles Redmond said.
   Satellites in polar orbit circle Earth from north to south,
allowing onboard instruments to study the whole planet as it
rotates.

   Customs agents seized $1 million worth of caviar in
three states and arrested two men on charges of importing the
delicacy in violation of an embargo on Iranian goods, authorities
said Wednesday.
   About 3,400 pounds of Iranian caviar were flown into Miami in
counterfeit Russian caviar tins and repacked in Iranian tins, said
Customs Service spokesman Michael Sheehan.
   Gerald Stein, 49, of New York City and Patrick Bachelier, 38, of
Miami were charged with violating a 1987 presidential ban on
imports from Iran.
   The caviar was seized March 15 at Caspian Caviar Co. in Miami,
Iron Gate Caviar Co. in New York City and Epicurean International
Inc. in Rockville, Md., Sheehan said.
   ``The caviar was in fact falsely labeled in Western Europe in
order to circumvent the embargo,'' Sheehan said. ``After the cavier
was released by customs, Bachelier would transfer the caviar into
Iranian tins, which he had imported separately.''
   Bachelier, who owns Caspian Caviar, said Wednesday, ``I'm
innocent. It's a mistake.''
   He said he imported some Iranian caviar under a permit issued to
a person he declined to identify. The rest of the caviar was
genuine Russian caviar, he said.
   Stein is president of Iron Gate Products, a wholesaler, and is
author of ``Caviar! Caviar! Caviar!'' A published report last year
said his company supplies Macy's department stores.
   Telephone calls to Iron Gate Products went unanswered Wednesday.
   Stein is scheduled for an appearance in federal court in Miami
on April 5 and Bachelier was arraigned March 16. They face up to 16
years in prison and $150,000 fines if convicted.

<TEXT>
   The Legislature's chief abortion foe said
the odds of a rape victim getting pregnant are ``one in millions
and millions and millions'' because the trauma causes a ``certain
secretion'' that kills sperm.
   Doctors specializing in reproduction dismissed the claim, made
by Republican Rep. Stephen Freind, as nonsense.
   Freind, who made the assertion during an interview on a Hanover
radio station earlier this month, said Tuesday he stands by the
claim and will provide medical documentation to support it in about
a week.
   Gov. Robert P. Casey has said he will sign a bill that requires
victims of rape or incest to report the crimes to be eligible for
government funding of abortions.
   In a debate with Barry Steinhardt of the Philadelphia branch of
the American Civil Liberties Union, Freind said, ``It is almost but
not quite impossible to become pregnant on the basis of rape. The
odds are one in millions and millions and millions. And there is a
physical reason for that.
   ``Rape, obviously, is a traumatic experience,'' he said. ``When
that traumatic experience is undergone, a woman secretes a certain
secretion, which has a tendency to kill sperm.''
   ``There's no basis for that. That's nonsense,'' Dr. Richard
Depp, chairman of the department of obstetrics and gynecology at
Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia.
   Dr. Luigi Mastroianni Jr., director of the division of human
reproduction at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania in
Philadelphia, said Tuesday: ``Boy. If I could find out what that
(secretion) was, I'd use it as a contraceptive.''
   Mastroianni, a past president of the American Fertility Society,
said: ``There is no such secretion.''
   He said Freind's statements ``reflect a lack of concern for
women who have been victimized by rape'' by dismissing the act as
not having consequence.
   Freind has been trying for years to get strong anti-abortion
laws through the Legislature.

   Most Americans believe President Reagan should
not have sent troops to Honduras last week, according to a CBS
News-New York Times poll released Wednesday.
   Thirty-five percent of the participants in the survey conducted
between Friday and Tuesday said the troops should have been sent,
52 percent said they should not have been, and 13 percent said they
did not know.
   The poll asked respondents if they were more concerned about the
United States getting into a war in Honduras or about a Communist
takeover in the area.
   It found that 53 percent were more worried about getting into a
war and 37 percent about a Communist takeover, while 4 percent said
the factors were equal and 2 percent said they were worried about
neither. Four percent said they did not know.
   When asked if President Reagan should pardon Oliver North if he
is convicted of theft, fraud and conspiracy charges in the
Iran-Contra affair, 43 percent said yes, 43 percent said no and 14
percent said they did not know.
   The poll also found that 48 percent of those interviewed did not
think the United States should be giving military aid to the
Contras while 39 percent said the aid should be given and 13
percent said they did not know.
   When asked if Vice President George Bush is hiding something the
public ought to know about the Iran-Contra matter, 51 percent said
he is, 28 percent said he is not and 21 percent said they did not
know.
   A total of 1,654 people were interviewed for the poll, which has
a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percent.

   President Jose Sarney on Wednesday
hailed the decision to keep the presidential system of government,
but some Brazilians wondered how long Sarney himself would be be
allowed to keep the office.
   Lawmakers writing a new constitution ended a year of political
uncertaintly Tuesday by deciding to have a president, rather than a
prime minister, as chief of government.
   ``It's a victory for the nation. It is not a personal victory,''
said Sarney, who has complained that uncertainty about the
country's political direction was a factor in Brazil's economic and
social ills.
   Sarney told reporters, ``This decision was better for the
country. Congress understood that.''
   Lawmakers decided 344-212 to have a presidential system of
government. Legislators who argued in favor of parliamentarism said
a prime minister was a modern alternative and a protection from
military leaders, who have made it clear they favor a presidential
system.
   Sarney said parliamentarism ``would bring chaos and threaten
democracy,'' an indirect reference to possible government
intervention by the military.
   Lawmakers also voted a five-year term for the presidential
office, another victory for Sarney.
   But whether Sarney can serve that long should be known in about
a month, when lawmakers are to vote on the remaining length of
Sarney's tenure.
   His term likely will be the last item voted on by the 559
legislators rewriting an authoritarian constitution. The present
constitution was handed down without a vote in 1969 by a military
junta that seized power in a 1964 coup. Brazilians haven't voted
for president since 1960.
   The country's leftist faction and most Brazilians, according to
polls, would like to see Sarney's term reduced by one year, from
five to four.
   But some Brazilians said trimming a year off Sarney's term is
harder now, after Congress voted to give the office of president a
five-year term.
   ``It would be hateful to have other presidents with five years
and reduce Sarney's to four,'' said Communications Minister Antonio
Carlos Magalhaes.
   The lawmakers' vote was preceded by heavy lobbying by Sarney and
his supporters.
   Jornal do Brasil, the influential daily of Rio de Janeiro,
condemned the ``methods used'' to obtain victory and criticized
Sarney for not keeping a promise to step down in four years.
   ``The intervention of the government was obscene,'' said Rep.
Ronaldo Cezar Coelho of the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party.
   Indirectly elected in an electoral college election, Sarney was
running mate on a liberal ticket headed by Tancredo Neves. Neves
died before taking office and Sarney became president in March 1985.
   As former leader of the military-backed party, Sarney was a
compromise candidate to appease the outgoing generals.
   The Neves-Sarney team was to be a transitional marriage to
smoothly lead South America's largest country to democracy. But
under three years of Sarney, Brazil has had its highest inflation
rate in history.

<HEAD>Authorities Declare Independent Students Union Illegal</HEAD>

   Authorities outlawed an independent
students union at Warsaw University on the grounds that it
threatened to stir unrest and engage in anti-state activities,
organizers of the group said Wednesday.
   Members of the organizing committee of the Warsaw University
Independent Students Union, known by its Polish initials NZS, said
they would defy the ban and organize a rally next week to protest
delays in dormitory renovations.
   The ban, dated Monday, was signed by the city's
socio-administrative department, which has the power to decide the
legality of organizations established by citizens.
   Student union activists announced at a March 8 campus rally,
attended by about 2,000 students, that they were giving up
underground activities to work openly for more academic freedoms
and to protect students' material interests.
   The banning order said the program of the NZS chapter shows the
student union's ``intention is to undertake activities which could
cause a threat to the peace and public order.''
   A copy of the order was made available to Western reporters
Wednesday.
   Student activists have campaigned at several major universities
this year for communist authorities to legalize the Independent
Students Union, which was officially registered in February 1981
but outlawed a year later after the martial law crackdown on the
Solidarity free trade union movement.
   About 1,500 Warsaw University students have joined the Warsaw
University NZS chapter since March 8, said Andrzej Papierz, a
history student and union organizer.
   Also on Wednesday, a Gdansk misdemeanor court meted out fines
ranging from 30,000 to 50,000 zlotys ($76 to $128) to 11 opposition
activists who were detained Monday at an anti-government happening
marking the first day of spring, said Maciej Jankowski, a Gdansk
opposition spokesman.
   One of those fined, Cezary Waluszko, said he would file a
complaint charging that police severely beat him after he was
detained at the happening in which a doll with dark glasses like
those worn by Polish leader Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski was thrown
into the Baltic, said Jankowski.
   In Wroclaw, misdemeanor courts fined two people 50,000 zlotys
each for taking part in illegal political protests, said Barbara
Labuda, a Wroclaw opposition spokeswoman.

   The church was unavailable and the doors on
other buildings are too small, so a traveling exhibit on the U.S.
Constitution will be displayed at the Horse Around Bar when it
reaches town next month.
   ``People are kind of enthused about it,'' said bar owner Galan
Hanson, who added that he was surprised when he was asked to be
host of the display in his building's garage.
   The exhibit on the Constitution's bicentennial, mounted on large
panels that can't be squeezed through an ordinary door frame, is
making the rounds of all 53 counties in North Dakota and is due in
Slope County on April 12-16.
   Folks here say Amidon is believed to be the smallest county seat
in the nation. The 1980 census listed the population as 43, but
Hanson thinks that overstates the case. ``There are 29 people who
live here all the time,'' he said.
   The door-frame problem ruled out Amidon's courthouse and its
school, and the only church in town with big enough doors couldn't
work the state-sponsored exhibit into its schedule.
   ``We came up with the idea that they have large enough doors (at
the Horse Around Bar),'' said Lois Anderson, county superintendent
of schools.
   Hanson's business is a former gas station and auto shop. The
exhibit will be in the shop area, separated by a wall, so visiting
schoolchildren will be spared the sight of anyone downing a brew
while they ponder the Founding Fathers.
   ``We'll just have to move some things around,'' Hanson said.
``I'll have to move my pickup out.''
   The tavern will be the most unusual place the exhibit has been
displayed, said John Schmaltz of the state Department of Public
Instruction, which helped create the exhibit.
   ``We've been booking it primarily in schools, public libraries,
shopping malls and, in some cases, courthouses,'' he said. ``But in
the town of Amidon, it's going to be in the Horse Around Bar.''

   Robert P. McCarney, an anti-establishment
conservative who led several successful drives to cut state taxes,
died Wednesday of pneumonia and heart failure. He was 76.
   McCarney made his first campaign in 1964, when he ran
unsuccessfully for the GOP gubernatorial nomination. He won the
1968 GOP primary but lost in the general election.
   McCarney led referendum drives that overturned tax packages
passed by the Legislature in 1963 and 1965. In 1976, he sponsored a
successful initiative measure that cut the state sales tax from 4
percent to 3 percent. Two years later, he sponsored a measure that
cut state income taxes by a third.

   A bomb explosion injured 16 people
Wednesday in a department store in southern Davao City on Mindanao
island and a larger bomb was defused in the same building, police
said.
   The bomb exploded shortly before midnight in a building that
also houses an office of the government's passport bureau, said
police Sgt. Dominado Balicoco.
   He said those hurt were passers-by hit by flying glass. Balicoco
said police found a larger explosive device later in the same
building and defused it.
   It was the second bombing in a major Mindanao island city in two
days. On Tuesday, two air force sergeants were killed when they
tried to defuse bombs found at Andrews Air Force Base in Zamboanga
City, 270 miles west of Davao.
   Police said they did not know who planted the bombs, but there
was speculation Moslem rebels were responsible. Both Davao and
Zamboanga are largely Christian cities, but Mindanao is the
stronghold of the 5 million-strong Moslem minority.
   The leader of the nation's largest Moslem rebel group called on
Wednesday for an uprising against President Corazon Aquino and said
her government was planning ``to resume genocide in our homeland.''
   Nur Misuari, head of the Moro National Liberation Front, claimed
in a telephone interview with radio station DZXL that the
government wanted to wipe out Moslems seeking autonomy on Mindanao
and other southern islands.
   He spoke from Amman, Jordan, where he was attending the annual
meeting of foreign ministers of the 46-nation Organization of
Islamic Conference.
   The government had no immediate comment on Misuari's charge.
   Fighting between Moslem rebels and the government has claimed
more than 50,000 lives since 1976, by official count, but has been
reduced to only occasional skirmishes in recent years.
   The military said eight people were killed Tuesday when gunmen
believed to be from the Moro National Liberation Front attacked a
marine detachment on Basilan island.
   Defense Minister Fidel Ramos predicted less trouble with Moslem
rebels in Mindanao because the Islamic conference rejected the
Moslem group's bid for membership, indicating it considers the
rebellion strictly a Philippine matter.
   But Misauri denied the conference rejected his group's
application.
   Jordan's foreign minister, Taher Masri, the conference chairman,
told reporters Tuesday the group was not qualified for membership.
   ``They are not a state and therefore their status cannot entitle
them to become'' a member, Masri said.
   The Islamic conference has been mediating the Philippine Moslem
conflict since shortly after rebel factions began a secessionist
war on Mindanao and the Sulu island chain in late 1972.

<HEAD>Swaggart-Owned Radio Station Must Pay $28,000 in Back Taxes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CONROE, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A jury Wednesday ruled that a radio station
owned by Jimmy Swaggart Ministries owes $28,000 in back taxes to
the city of Shenandoah.
   Swaggart Ministries, based in Baton Rouge, La., had claimed
KJOJ-FM qualified as a place of worship and was therefore tax
exempt, but city officials said it owed $64,043 in real estate and
personal property taxes from from 1980 to 1987.
   The state District Court jury decided 10-2 that the ministry
should pay $28,000 because only half the building qualifies as a
church. The other half was real estate and leased property, the
jury said.
   Shenandoah City Manager Natalie Kelly said City Council will
consider an appeal.
   Swaggart's ministry has been rocked by allegations Swaggart
hired a prostitute to pose nude for him.
   Michael Darlow, representing the city of Shenandoah, had told
jury: ``What happens if you grant Jimmy Swaggart Ministries a
religious exemption? What if a restaurant opens up and has passages
from the Bible in its menu and says they're a place of religious
worship?''
   ``We have to stop somewhere. I suggest the place to stop is here
and now,'' Darlow said.
   Swaggart Ministries attorney James Bradford argued the ministry
is asking to pay real estate taxes only on the half of the building
not used for the radio station. He said the ministry should receive
a full tax exemption on personal property related to the second
floor of the building, which houses the station.

   Secretary of State George P. Shultz on
Wednesday night ruled out any agreement to end the 7{-year war in
Afghanistan unless the Soviet Union suspends military aid to the
Marxist government there.
   Shultz also outlined sharp disagreements on Central America and
the Middle East at the end of three days of talks with Soviet
Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze.
   He said the Soviets wanted U.S. military aid to an unspecified
number of Central American governments halted as a condition for
them to stop supplying Nicaragua in its war with Contra rebels.
   ``It did not seem something we could pursue,'' Shultz said.
   On the Middle East, he said Shevardnadze envisioned an active
role for Moscow in Arab-Israeli negotiations.
   Shultz said that would get in the way of talks between the two
sides. ``The Soviet concept is sharply different from ours,''
Shultz said.
   On human rights, however, there was apparent progress.
   Shultz said Shevardnadze gave assurances that Moscow would
consider changes in visa requirements for would-be emigrants and
also in the way religious observances are treated.
   But, at a State Department news conference, Shultz stressed the
disagreements with Shevardnadze, especially over Afghanistan.
   He said the foreign minister had rejected a U.S. proposal for a
moratorium on new weapons shipments to Kabul while the Soviets
withdrew their troops and for three months afterward.
   He said the United States offered to suspend its support for the
Afghan resistance during the same period.
   ``They didn't feel they could agree to that,'' Shultz said.
   And yet, Shultz said, ``those conditions are needed for us to be
able to sign as a guarantor'' of an international agreement to end
the conflict.
   Shevardnadze told a news conference that the Soviet Union had no
intention of stopping its aid to the Afghan government.
   The aid is required by a Soviet-Afghan treaty, ``those are
legitimate supplies, and we are not going to rescind that treaty,''
Shevardnadze said.
   He repeated statements by a Soviet spokesman last week that
Moscow is willing to undertake a troop withdrawal even without an
agreement at Afghan peace negotiations under way in Geneva.
   But he did not give a date for withdrawal.
   Shultz said the Soviets were willing to withdraw the Red Army by
the end of the year, beginning with a 50 percent pullout during the
first three months in which the agreement was in effect.
   The guarantee of a withdrawal filled ``a great big hole'' in the
situation, Shultz said.
   But, he said, Soviet military aid to the Marxist government must
cease for stability to return to the war-torn country and for an
estimated 5 million refugees to go home.
   ``The proposal remains on the table,'' Shultz said. ``If our
thought or something close to it is accepted we would be pleased to
sign on as a guarantor.''
   The negotiations are being conducted by Diego Cordovez, a United
Nations mediator, between Afghanistan and Pakistan.

   President Reagan announced Wednesday he would
go to Moscow from May 29 to June 2 for his fourth summit meeting
with Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev and his first visit to a
nation he once branded an ``evil empire.''
   The five-day visit will mark the first trip to Moscow by an
American president since Richard Nixon's 1974 summer meeting with
Leonid Brezhnev. Later that same year, in November, Gerald Ford met
with Brezhnev in the Soviet port city of Vladivostok.
   The summit's intended centerpiece is the signing of a treaty to
scrap 30 percent to 50 percent of the superpowers' long-range
bombers, missiles and submarines. However, Reagan already has
suggested an agreement will not be ready, saying time is too
limited.
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz and Soviet Foreign Minister
Eduard A. Shevardnadze reported Wednesday night that differences
remained between the two sides on the accord.
   At separate news conferences they also disclosed sharp
disagreements on explosive regional issues: Afghanistan, the Middle
East and Central America.
   Shultz told reporters at the State Department that he ruled out
any agreement to end the war in Afghanistan unless the Soviet Union
suspends military aid to the Marxist government. The United States
will continue aiding Afghan rebels.
   He said Shevardnadze rejected a U.S. proposal for a moratorium
on new weapons shipments to Kabul during the Soviet withdrawal and
for three months afterward. The United States would suspend its
support for the Afghan rebels during the same period.
   ``I have ruled out this,'' Shevardnadze told a news conference.
   He said the aid was a Soviet treaty obligation ``and we're not
going to rescind that treaty.'' As Shevardnadze spoke, the chants
of critics of Soviet policies in Armenia, demonstrating outside the
Soviet Embassy, could be heard in the room.
   Shultz said the Soviets wanted military aid to an unspecified
number of Central American governments halted as a condition for
them to stop supplying Nicaragua in its war with the Contra rebels.
   As for bringing peace to the Middle East, ``the Soviet concept
is sharply different from ours,'' Shultz said.
   The two said in a joint statement they would meet again in
Moscow on April 21-25 and also in May, but did not indicate where
that session would be held.
   ``Both sides have worked hard and some progress has been
realized in a number of areas, but much more needs to be done,''
the statement said.
   Asked Wednesday if a treaty would be completed, Reagan said, ``I
have no way of answering that'' and added that the two nations were
committed to the cutback.
   Shevardnadze, asked if a treaty would be ready, said through a
translator: ``It is possible. This is not an easy task. This is a
very complicated task, but we are becoming convinced that it is
doable.
   ``There are many difficult questions of a technical nature,
mostly in verification, but in principle this can be done,'' the
foreign minister said as he left the White House following two
hours of talks and lunch with Reagan.
   The summit announcement capped three days of meetings between
Shevardnadze and Shultz. After a morning round of talks at the
State Department, Shevardnadze went to the White House.
   Within minutes of his arrival, Shevardnadze and Reagan stepped
from the Oval Office to the sun-splashed Rose Garden to disclose
the long-awaited summit dates.
   ``We have set the date and now we shall take care of good
substance, good content for the summit,'' Shevardnadze said.
   The Soviet foreign minister returned to the State Department in
mid-afternoon and met with Shultz past the dinner hour. They
received reports from separate groups of U.S. and Soviet experts
working on arms control, human rights and regional issues including
Afghanistan, Central America, the Middle East and the Iran-Iraq war.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the president would
spend all of his time in the Soviet capital, following the pattern
set by Gorbachev when he remained in Washington during his December
summit with Reagan. However, first lady Nancy Reagan is planning a
day trip to Leningrad.
   White House planners are exploring the possibility of setting up
meetings with Soviet dissidents and refuseniks, as well as
arranging a presidential trip to a performance by the Bolshoi
ballet.
   Asked what the summit would achieve if an arms agreement is not
sealed, Reagan said, ``There are a number of other subjects that we
continue to discuss with each other.''
   In recent weeks, a number of dates were rumored for the summit,
all of them in the week before May 29.
   Fitzwater said the timing was not finally settled until
mid-morning Wednesday. ``We had a set of dates at the end of May;
they had a set of dates at the beginning of June. These are the
compromise dates we came up with,'' he said.
   At the White House talks, Shevardnadze devoted most of his
presentation to the strategic arms talks. Reagan's Star Wars
missile defense system, which has been an obstacle to an arms
agreement, did not come up, Fitzwater said.
   Reagan will leave Washington on May 26 or May 27, stopping two
or three nights in Helsinki, Finland, the spokesman said. That is
intended to let him adjust to the eight-hour time difference
between Washington and Moscow and to make a scene-setting speech
for the talks with Gorbachev.
   Before returning to Washington, Reagan will stop in London to
brief allies and make another speech summing up the trip. Fitzwater
said a news conference also is planned after the summit, but that
the location has not been determined.
   The actual summit in Moscow probably will be confined to three
days, the same as the December meeting in Washington, Fitzwater
said. The five-day schedule includes arrival and departure dates,
he added.
   Reagan, who built his political career as an ardent
anti-communist, came into office in 1981 saying Kremlin leaders did
not hesitate to lie or cheat to achieve their goals. Toughening his
line, he later called the Soviet Union ``an evil empire.''
   However, he softened his tone in his second term, and worked out
a treaty _ signed in December _ to abolish U.S. and Soviet
medium-range nuclear missiles.
   Reagan has said Gorbachev is different from other Soviet
leaders, with his campaign for openness and reform. After the
December summit, he said he felt the Soviets no longer were intent
on world domination and that the two superpowers can live in peace.

<TEXT>
   A used-car salesman fired over what his boss
said were his loud and ugly sport coats said Wednesday he wore a
pink one to sign an agreement settling his age-discrimination suit
against the dealership.
   ``I was going to wear the pink sport coat on the first day of
the trial,'' said 62-year-old Lee Grant, who sued Darby Buick of
Sarasota. Contacted at another used car lot where he now works, he
said, ``I believe I have proved my point.''
   The suit, which had become known in courthouse circles as ``The
Dress of A Salesman,'' was to go to trial in U.S. District Court on
Wednesday.
   Grant's lawyer, Nancy Donnellan, said the terms of the agreement
require that the amount of the settlement be kept secret. The two
sides are awaiting an order by Judge Wendell A. Miles officially
dismissing the suit, she said.
   ``I wanted those sports coats vindicated,'' said Ms. Donnellan.
``They aren't really that bad.''
   Telephone calls Wednesday to the office of William Sizemore,
Darby's attorney, were not returned.
   Grant had claimed he was forced out of his job because of age in
1985, even though with 30 years experience he was the top salesman.
   At the start of 1984, Grant said, the average age of 13 salesmen
at Darby was 50. Between January 1984 and August 1985, he said, the
average had been reduced to 38.
   Sizemore contended Grant was discharged ``based on his
behavior'' at the car lot.
   Grant said he was fired after C. Conrad Darby Jr. had taken over
management the dealership from Darby's father in 1983 and started a
``new image'' campaign. He said he was told to wear sports coats
for a more professional look.
   After forcing Darby to put the policy in writing, Grant said he
bought jackets he described as pale pink and rainbow plaid. The
latter, he said, has every color in it and matches gray slacks or
green, or red or blue.

   Sizemore said Grant had other iritating habits, such as

   Supporters of a civil rights bill enacted over
President Reagan's veto say it will help cure ``an epidemic of
discrimination'' that followed a 1984 Supreme Court decision
limiting federal protection for many groups.
   ``Discrimination in federally funded institutions is occurring
at accelerated rates,'' Rep. Don Edwards, D-Calif., said Tuesday as
the House joined the Senate in overriding Reagan's veto of the
Civil Rights Restoration Act.
   Edwards, chairman of the House Judiciary subcommittee on civil
rights, said the Education Department closed or suspended hundreds
of sex bias cases after the court ruling.
   Even as the voting occurred, Reagan was calling the bill ``a
power grab'' by the federal government. But the White House later
issued a statement acknowledging the override and saying the
administration would ``work to implement the new law.''

   The postal rate increase that will push the
cost of mailing a first-class letter to 25 cents next month is
likely to affect consumers in a host of other areas as well, as
businesses pass along their own higher costs.
   While first-class rates will be most readily noticed, the
charges to businesses for mailing bills and advertising and sending
books and magazines to American homes also affect individuals.
Prices and subscription rates may well increase, with the postage
costs being cited as a factor.
   The new rates, for example, would add about $1.15 to the annual
cost of mailing a weekly newsmagazine to one home. Utilities,
credit card companies and department stores will have to spend
about 36 cents more, annually, to bill one customer. The cost of an
average book club mailing will rise by about 50 cents.

   The Reagan administration is trying to
encourage Panamanian leader Manuel Antonio Noriega to leave his
homeland by offering to fly him into exile along with family and
friends, U.S. officials say.
   The proposal was made last week when Noriega met with two State
Department envoys who encouraged him to step down as commander of
Panama's Defense Forces and to accept a Spanish offer of political
exile, said the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   But Noriega told the envoys he was not willing to accept any
arrangement that involves his departure from Panama.

surrender power and go into exile.
   ``I am a Panamanian not a gringo,'' Noriega said after meeting
Tuesday with a small group of union supporters. ``Let the world
know we are fighting the ultimate battle for dignity and against
colonialism.''
   An estimated 90 percent of offices and industries were shut by
the strike on Tuesday. Most shops and stores were closed, public

   Henry Kissinger, Alexander M. Haig Jr. and
other advisers to President Nixon from 1969 to 1974 rejected
proposals for a more outspoken policy on Soviet human rights and
refused to let some Jewish groups use the White House as a
platform, according to newly released presidential documents.
   The advisers favored a more low-profile effort involving
behind-the-scenes negotiations with the Soviets, the documents
indicate.
   ``The guidance from General Haig is that we should not get the
president involved in our replies to Soviet Jewry correspondence,''
aide A. Denis Clift said in a memorandum on how the White House
should respond to letters from critics of Soviet policies.
   Kissinger himself wrote ``there is virtually no way'' the United
States could exert public pressure on the Soviet Union to improve
the plight of Jews.

<HEAD>Clergy Considered Lacking, But Preferable To Lay Professionals</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEAN GOLEMBESKI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Church people prefer being led by
ordained clergy rather than lay professionals, even though the
clergy are not considered very effective, a national study of Roman
Catholics and Protestants finds.
   Catholics were found somewhat more confident in lay leadership
than Protestants, but also favored ordaining women and married men
_ which Catholicism forbids _ to keep up the clergy supply.
   The year-long study by Hartford Seminary's Center for Social and
Religious Research was prompted by growing concern over a clergy
shortage.
   Lay leaders at more than 200 parishes across the country were
asked to consider 12 leadership tasks, rating them according to
importance and how effective the clergy handle them.
   ``For preaching, liturgical leadership, pastoral counseling,
directing religious education, parish evangelization and parish
planning, the gap between importance and effectiveness ranges from
30 perceent to 40 percent'' among Catholics, the study found.
   The gap among three Protestant denominations surveyed ranged
between 20 percent and 30 percent. The Protestants studied were the
Episcopal Church, the Lutheran Church in America and the United
Methodist Church.
   The study also found both Protestants and Catholics somewhat
cool toward professional lay leaders, but with Catholics more
willing for lay professionals to perform many of the chores now
undertaken by the clergy.
   Aproximately 60 percent of members of each denomination
expressed strong or moderate agreement that the morale in their
parish or congregation would be adversely affected were they not
able to secure a full-time, ordained pastor.
   ``Also, except for Lutherans (52 precent) over 60 percent of all
respondents agree that the average lay person responds best to
ordained leadership,'' the researchers wrote.
   When asked what option they would chose if unable to afford a
full-time pastor, more than 80 percent preferred some form of
ordained, part-time leadership to either full-time or part-time lay
leadership.
   The seminary, an interdenominational theological center,
released a preliminary report on its year-long study last week. A
fuller report is due later this year.
   One purpose was to examine attitudes toward professional lay
leadership, and its comparative costs.
   In general, Protestant clergy were compensated at a rate nearly
double what Catholic priests receive _ an average of $45,005 a year
for an Episcopal priest compared to $26,376 a year for a Catholic
priest. Compensation includes salary, plus such items as housing,
health care and retirement benefits.
   The study said Protestants would save if professional lay
leaders replaced clergy to run parishes. For Catholics, the costs
would be closer to the same.
   Full-time lay professionals earn an average of $23,246 a year
among United Methodists, the top among Protestants, compared to
$16,754 among Episcoplians and $18,527 a year among Catholics.
   The research team included Jackson W. Carroll, Hartford
seminary's research director; Dean R. Hoge, a sociology professor
at Catholic University in Washington, D.C.; and the Rev. Francis K.
Sheets, a church management specialist.
   They gathered information from eight metropolitan areas: Nashua,
N.H.; Trenton, N.J.; Orlando, Fla.; Mobile, Ala.; Dallas;
Cleveland; Colorado Springs, Colo.; and Bremerton, Wash.
   The 2,209 lay leaders in 201 parishes submitted 1,829 completed
questionaires.
   The question of who will minister to churchgoers in the future
is of critical importance to church officials.
   Among Catholics, it's estimated that the number of priests will
decline by 40 percent by the year 2000. The number of Catholic
seminarians declined from 8,885 in 1965 to 4,063 in 1985, the
researchers said.
   Among Protestants, there is an oversupply of clergy for some
larger, well-to-do parishes, while there's an increasing shortage
among smaller parishes unable to afford the cost of full-time
clergy members, researchers said.
   The study found that Catholics pay substantially less per
household to suport their priests compared to Protestant
households. Catholics contribute an average $28 per household
annually to pay for priests, compared to Lutherans, who topped the
survey with an annual contribution of $342 per household.
   Among other findings:
   _About 75 percent of Catholic lay leaders compared to about half
the Protestants believe ``most tasks currently done by ordained
pastors can be done equally well by lay persons with special
competence for the task.''
   _About half the Catholics prefer priests rather than lay people
give sermons, compared to 75 percent among Protestants.
   _More than two-thirds of the Protestants want their priests to
lead the confirmation classes compared to 25 percent among
Catholics.

   Churches can be effective partners in helping

   Testifying recently for the U.S. Catholic Conference before a

labored valiantly to take up the slack caused by erosion of
government programs.
   But he said the private sector can't substitute for the
``essential responsibility'' of the government.
   Increased church efforts, he said, are ``a desperate attempt to
feed hungry people when others have abandoned their
responsibility,'' but ``we cannot pretend that soup kitchens and
shelters'' are sufficient.
   ``They cannot substitute for a national commitment to end hunger
and invest our common resources to feed the hungry,'' he added.

<HEAD>Parker Stevenson Sees Character as Bumbling Sherlock Holmes</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JERRY BUCK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Parker Stevenson smiles at the suggestion
that his character on the new ABC series ``Probe'' appears to be a
cross between Sherlock Holmes and Tom Swift.
   Austin James is an eccentric scientist who uses his remarkable
mental skills to fight crime. His knowledge has made him fabulously
wealthy, but he prefers to avoid the think tank he founded and live
in an old warehouse he calls the ``batcave.''
   ``I think of him more as Sherlock Holmes and Elmer Fudd,'' said
Stevenson, ``since there is a fumbling aspect to his personality.
I'm playing a whacko. He's clever, but whacko. That's what made me
anxious to go back and do another series. I don't see myself
getting bored doing this.
   ``He sleeps naked in an isolation tank. Actually, it's a tool
cabinet. He drink martinis and eat blocks of frozen peas. He's
different than `MacGyver' or `The Knight Rider.' You always know
that Sherlock Holmes can figure it out. In some episodes you're
never really sure if Austin James will get it.''
   Austin James in ``Probe'' is sort of a one-man brain trust. He
solves crimes by being receptive to data that other people miss.
Ashley Crow plays naive and inexperienced Mickey Castle, his Dr.
Watson.
   ``Her point of view becomes valuable to him,'' Stevenson said.
``And she's fascinated enough by what he does to stick around and
put up with the grief.''
   The one-hour series was created by famed science-fiction writer
Isaac Asimov and Michael Wagner, former story editor of ``Hill
Street Blues.'' Asimov came up with the characters and concept and
Wagner wrote the pilot.
   ``I've never met Isaac,'' said Stevenson. ``But I'd love to have
him come on the show as my mentor and throw me a few words of
wisdom if I start to run amok. Isaac lives in New York and won't
fly.''
   ``Probe'' appears on ABC at 8 p.m. EST Thursdays, where it's up
against NBC's ``The Cosby Show'' and ``A Different World.''
Fortunately for Stevenson, it's not up against NBC's ``Cheers,''
which stars his wife, Kirstie Alley.
   This is the first series for Stevenson since he did a
half-season on CBS' ``Falcon Crest'' in the 1984-85 season. Before
that he was in ``The Hardy Boys'' in 1977-79.
   ``I was a bad guy on `Falcon Crest,' which was fun,'' he said.
``You don't want to do the same kind of character all the time. The
last few years I've been doing different kinds of roles. It's
helped me rediscover why I went into this business in the first
place.
   ``I think the intention was to bring me in and kill me off. I
did more episodes than I thought I would, but they still ended up
burying me in a graveyard.''
   In recent times he's also played an amoral newspaper reporter in
the CBS movie ``Betrayal of Trust'' and in episodes of ``Alfred
Hitchcock Presents'' and ``The Hitchhiker.''
   Last year he was in the second part of the ABC miniseries
``North and South.'' He played Bill Hazzard from the Northern
family, who married Genie Francis from the Southern family. Kirstie
Alley played his sister in both installments.
   Stevenson grew up in New York City, where he started doing
commercials and movies when he was about 14. His first movie was
``A Separate Peace.'' He was also in the cult film ``Lifeguard''
with Sam Elliott.
   ```The Hardy Boys' got me established,'' he said. ``I learned
about directing, studios, networks. It was a paid education. Then
came the hangover, which has to do with being typecast and
inexperienced. I feel I've had several shots at an acting career. I
feel lucky because usually you have only one chance in this
business.''
   And, the answer to that lingering question is, yes, he and
Jameson Parker of CBS' ``Simon & Simon'' are frequently mistaken
for each other. ``We get each other's mail,'' he said. ``I got an
invitation for an expense-paid trip to Florida to attend the
premiere of one of his movies. The funny thing is Jameson and I did
a commercial together in New York years ago. Now we laugh about all
the mixup.''

   At 92, Val Browning piles his two
dogs into a car each day and drives 17 miles to keep alive the name
and reputation of the most prolific firearms inventor in history.
   Browning is the former president and now honorary chairman of
the board of the firearms company named for his father, John M.
Browning, who designed more than 80 military and sporting arms.
   A list of John Browning's inventions could serve as the
framework for any history of firearms over the last century. It
includes the Winchester Model 1886 lever-action repeating rifle,
America's first smokeless-powder sporting rifle, the automatic
shotgun, the Colt .45 automatic pistol and all the machine guns
used by U.S. troops on land, sea or air from World War I to the
Korean War.
   ``He was a most unpretentious man. You would never know he was a
man of any renown to meet. There was never any kind of show,'' says
Val Browning, whose description of his father could apply equally
to the son.
   Respected firearms inventor himself with 48 patents, generous
benefactor of colleges and hospitals, decorated by Belgian royalty,
Val Browning nevertheless has lived his life in the shadow of a
giant.
   ``He was such an extraordinary genius and accomplished so much
that there wasn't much left to do in firearms design except to take
advantage of modern materials and methods,'' Val Browning said of
his father during an interview at corporate headquarters.
   Indeed, Val Browning's two most satisfying inventions were
improvements to his father's designs _ a quick-loading feature for
the automatic shotgun and a single-trigger mechanism for the
over-under double-barrel shotgun.
   Val's son, John Val Browning, 62, was president of Browning for
14 years until just before it was acquired in 1977 by Fabrique
Nationale d'Armes de Guerre of Belgium. He speaks with insight
about the challenge his father faced as a son of the great inventor.
   ``It's a very difficult problem for him,'' the younger Browning
said. ``But I think that he always understood it. He was always
striving to do something on his own. He just didn't sit down and
live off the fame of his father. And what he could do, he did.''
   Two years ago, father and son returned to Belgium, where Val
Browning had charge of his father's firearms interests from 1920 to
1935, and to northern France, where as a young second lieutenant in
1918 he instructed American troops in the use of two John Browning
inventions _ the .30-caliber water-cooled machine gun and the
fabled Browning Automatic Rifle, or B.A.R.
   ``I was up at the front to keep track of them and to report on
their performance,'' Val Browning said.
   His father's .50-caliber machine gun was produced too late for
use in World War I, a conflict triggered in 1914 when a John
Browning-designed .32-caliber pistol was used to assassinate
Austrian Archduke Franz Ferdinand and his wife Sophie at Sarajevo.
   Eight years after the war, at the Fabrique Nationale plant at
Liege, John Browning, 72, suddenly took ill. Val Browning, who was
with him, recalls the moment:
   ``He said, `Son, I think I'm dying.' I said, `No, I don't think
so.' I was of course trying to encourage him. But he was, and he
did.''
   Returning to his native Ogden, Utah, in 1935, Val Browning
became president of the J.M. & M.S. Browning Co. and Browning Arms
Co., a post he held until 1962, when he was succeeded by his son,
John.
   But today, only Val Browning remains associated with the
sporting arms company formed the year after his father's death.
``That's one reason why I stayed on, so there would be somebody
with the name connected with it,'' he said.
   Like his father, Val Browning is a habitual walker and was,
before injuring his shoulder four years ago, an avid hunter of
duck, pigeons and small game.
   ``If I didn't eat what I shot I wouldn't shoot it,'' he said,
touching on reasons he believes the sporting arms business has a
rocky future.
   Population growth, dwindling wildlife habitat and ``the general
feeling against firearms in this country make it so that it's
rather an undesirable business to be in,'' he said.
   His son puts it another way: ``The idea of going out hunting is
considered somewhat reprehensible. The same sensitivity does not
seem to extend to fish.''
   Val Browning, father of four and a widower since 1975, embraces
life with an avidity and humor that belie his years. His dogs, Beau
and Jill, join him as he drives up Weber Canyon to company
headquarters at Mountain Green. He keeps busy there for three or
four hours a day, sometimes test-firing Browning's latest line.
   An early riser who walks two miles a day, he quit smoking 50
years ago when an errant cigarette ash ruined a good suit.
   Also, ``I used to like a cocktail very much indeed. And
sometimes three of them.'' But he's learned to ``sort of listen to
what my system was trying to tell me'' and a single cocktail every
couple of months, in social settings to ease a natural shyness, is
all he allows himself.
   ``He has the blood pressure of a 16-year-old,'' says his cook,
Nancy Clifford.
   More refined than his frontier father, he reads constantly, has
a substantial art collection and loves music.
   ``I'm trying to understand atonal music, but I think I'm a
little bit too old for that,'' he says in the deadpan that sets up
the punchline. ``In other words, I can't whistle it.''

<TEXT>
   The death of an IBM executive in a 1985 airplane
crash deprived him of more than $6 million in earnings, according
to a federal jury that awarded $7.95 million to the estates of the
man and his wife.
   Attorneys for Delta Air Lines immediately moved to set aside the
verdict, delivered Monday night after five hours of deliberations
in the case brought by the estate of Philip D. Estridge, 47, of New
Canaan, Conn., and his wife, Mary Ann, who also died in the crash.
   Tuesday, another IBM executive who lost a daughter in the crash,
and claimed his career was damaged by his emotional reaction to
that loss, won a $3.5 million damage judgment against Delta in a
case that was tried in West Palm Beach, Fla. The flight originated
in Fort Lauderdale.
   Attorney Lee Kreindler, who represented the Estridge estate,
said the sum awarded in the New York Case was a record for
compensatory damages in a wrongful-death suit. The breakdown was
$6.25 million for Estridge's loss of earning; $750,000 for loss of
enjoyment of life; and $100,000 for mental anguish.
   For the estate of Mrs. Estridge, the jury awarded $750,000 for
loss of enjoyment of life; and $100,000 for mental anguish. The
couple's three daughters had sought $25 million for Estridge and $5
million for Mrs. Estridge.
   ``We don't think anything could have happened any better, and
we're definitely relieved it's over,'' said Evelyn Eubanks, one of
the daughters. ``It doesn't make it better, but it helps us to live
with it.''
   Estridge, who received much of the credit for moving IBM into
the personal computer market, and his wife were among 137 people
killed when a Lockheed L-1011 crashed on approach at Dallas-Fort
Worth International Airport on Aug. 2, 1985.
   IBM Chairman and Chief Executive John F. Akers testified at the
trial that there was ``a strong possibility'' Estridge would have
become one of the company's six senior executives.
   Those executives make an average of $350,000 per year, with an
additional $150,000 per year in IBM stock which cannot be sold
until retirement. Shortly before his death, Estridge was named
overseer of IBM's worldwide manufacturing operations at a yearly
salary of $240,000.
   Akers also testified there was a competitive market for computer
executives and Estridge could have moved to another company
offering more money.
   Although the trial was held in New York City, the award was
reached under the law of Estridge's home state of Connecticut to
allow for the salary projection figures, Kreindler said.
   Delta lawyer John Sabetta declined to comment on the award, but
asked U.S. District Judge John E. Sprizzo to set the jury award
aside shortly after it was announced. Legal briefs on that motion
are due May 21.
   Delta spokesman Bill Berry referred calls to the company's
insurance carrier, U.S. Aviation Underwriters, and had no other
comment. A U.S. Aviation spokesman, Bob Albert, was in a meeting
and unavailable to comment.
   In the Florida case, a federal jury deliberated less than two
hours before awarding Dennis and Gayle Zarnt of Boca Raton $3.5
million for the death of their 15-year-old daughter, Julie, who
coincidentally was aboard the same flight as the Estridges.
   IBM executives testified in videotaped depositions that the
girl's death left Zarnt, a member of the management team
responsible for the introduction of the original IBM-PC, an
emotional ``basket case'' unable to continue what had been an
outstanding career.
   Delta attorney Howard Barwick, who had argued to the jury that
an award of about $500,000 would be adequate, declined to comment
on the verdict. The Zarnts' attorney, Robert M. Montgomery Jr.,
said he expected Delta would appeal. He had sought $5 million in
damages.
   Much of IBM's development of the personal computer was done at
Boca Raton, and the Estridges had formerly lived there.

   Higher postage rates, including a 25-cent
charge for first-class letters, will take effect April 3, the
Postal Service says.
   The new rates, announced Tuesday, reflect higher costs of
delivering mail, said John L. Griesemer, chairman of the Postal
Service Board of Governors.
   The board set the effective date for the sweeping series of new
rates recommended by the independent Postal Rate Commission earlier
this month. Rates were last changed in February 1985, when the
price of a first-class stamp rose to 22 cents from 20 cents.

   Energy futures prices have turned mixed in
moderate trading, with crude oil falling sharply on the final day
of trading in the April contract.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, contracts for April
delivery of West Texas Intemediate, the benchmark U.S. crude,
settled at $16.09 per 42-gallon barrel Tuesday, down 40 cents from
Monday. The contract had fallen 9 cents on Monday.
   Traders attributed the decline largely to technical factors
stemming from the imminent expiration of the April contract, which
traded for the last time on Tuesday. The May contract for WTI rose
6 cents to $16.37 a barrel.
   Among refined products traded on the exchange, wholesale heating
oil closed up 0.75 cent at 46.15 cents per gallon, after rising
0.35 cent Monday. Unleaded gasoline, which increased 0.12 cent on
Monday, gained 0.21 cent to 46.32 cents a gallon on Tuesday.
   Richard Redoglia, a trader for Merrill Lynch Energy Futures,
said prices were supported by speculation that a pending weekly
report from the American Petroleum Institute would show a reduction
in crude oil stock levels.
   He said the market generally ignored the cancellation of a
Tuesday news conference by Rilwanu Lukman, president of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, that was expected to
have focused on stabilizing sagging oil prices.
   ``No one expected him to say anything of great importance
anyway,'' Redoglia said.

<HEAD>Campeau Boosts Offer, Proposes Friendly Merger</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOYCE M. ROSENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Down but not out of its battle for Federated
Department Stores Inc., Campeau Corp. has launched a counterattack:
a sweetened buyout offer and a proposal for a friendly merger.
   Campeau's move on Tuesday appeared to give it back the edge it
recently lost to R.H. Macy & Co. Inc. in the high-stakes campaign
to acquire the Cincinnati-based retailer.
   Campeau raised its two-step, all-cash offer to approximately $73
a share, or $6.53 billion, from $68 a share, or $6.18 billion.
Under the new offer, Campeau said it would pay $82 each for 70.5
million Federated shares and $37 for the remainder of Federated's
89.5 million outstanding shares in a subsequent merger.
   Campeau also extended the expiration of its offer to midnight
EST April 4, when Macy's competing $6.3 billion offer is to expire.
   Campeau, a Toronto-based developer, also proposed to Federated's
board of directors an alternate friendly merger under which it
would pay $73 a share for 70.5 million shares in a tender offer and
$73 for the remaining shares following the merger.
   Federated has agreed to merge with Macy, which is offering
$77.35 a share in cash for 70.43 million Federated shares, for a
total of $5.4 billion. Macy would exchange shares in the merged
company and issue convertible debt securities for the remainder of
Federated's 89.5 million outstanding shares.
   Federated stock was up $2.37{ to $69.25 a share in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading Tuesday. Campeau announced its
sweetened offer an hour before the end of the session.
   Campeau had been expected to sweeten its offer or propose a
friendly deal after the company lost two rounds in court to
invalidate Federated's ``poison pill'' takeover defense.
   Campeau contended its bid could not go forward while the pill
was in effect, leaving Macy with the upper hand following the court
rulings.
   The defense makes a takeover prohibitively expensive by allowing
Federated shareholders to buy more of the company's stock at a
steep discount.
   It was not immediately clear how a simultaneous expiration of
both offers would affect the application of the pill, over which
Federated has sole discretion.
   ``That's not something we can really comment on at this point,''
said Jim Sluzewski, a Federated spokesman.
   Nancy Raeside, a Campeau spokeswoman, said the company would
continue its legal battle to strike down the defense.
   On Monday, a federal judge rebuffed Campeau's proposal that he
remove the pill in exchange for Campeau extending its tender offer
to expire simultaneously with Macy's offer.
   U.S. District Judge Leonard Sand said the pill would remain in
place at least until Federated makes a final recommendation to its
shareholders, Ms. Raeside said. On Friday, Sand denied Campeau's
request to invalidate the pill.
   Before Sand's ruling, analysts had given Campeau's all-cash
offer the edge over Macy's cash-and-stock bid. But Campeau appeared
to regain the advantage with its sweetened offer, said Edward
Johnson, an analyst with Prescott Ball & Turben Inc.
   Johnson said Federated shareholders likely would jump to take
advantage of the higher price in the first stage of Campeau's
offer. ``It puts Campeau's bid ahead and leaves the ball up to
Macy's,'' he said.
   Macy had no immediate comment on Campeau's move, said Maureen
Milano, a spokeswoman for the retailer.
   Federated spokesman Sluzewski said if the Federated board
received a revised offer from Campeau, the directors would consider
it. He said the board was scheduled to meet this week, but would
not confirm that the revised offer would be on the agenda.
   In a letter to the Federated board, Campeau proposed that a
Campeau-Federated merger be structured along lines similar to the
retailer's agreement with Macy.
   Campeau said it also would continue fighting Federated's
agreement to pay Macy millions of dollars in fees if the
Macy-Federated deal falls through.

   Lucky Stores Inc., a takeover target for
the second time in two years, is highly regarded in the supermarket
industry for its quality management and shrewd marketing practices.
   ``The company is on a roll,'' analyst Jonathan Ziegler of Sutro
& Co. Inc. said Tuesday after American Stores Co. made an
unsolicited $45 a share, $1.72 billion buyout that sent Lucky's
stock soaring.
   ``I think American wants Lucky's management as much they want a
stronger foothold in California,'' Ziegler said.
   Lucky said from its headquarters in Dublin, 30 miles east of San
Francisco, that it was not prepared to comment on the surprise
offer.
   But investors reacted quickly, sending Lucky's stock climbing
$14.50 a share to $46.37{ Tuesday in heavy trading on the New York
Stock Exchange. The rise above American Stores' offer could
indicate speculators believe the bids will go even higher _ some
analysts say $50 a share is not out of the question.
   If successful, the acquisition by Salt Lake City-based American
Stores would create the nation's largest supermarket chain.
   Lucky Stores, the nation's No. 6 grocery retailer, has 480
stores and had $6.4 billion in 1987 sales. American Stores, the
third biggest, has 1,600 stores and $14.1 billion in sales.
   The bid for Lucky came just over a year after takeover
strategist Asher Edelman formally dropped a hostile takeover
attempt, in return for the company's agreement to $2.8 million of
his legal costs.
   Lucky thwarted Edelman partly by selling off non-grocery
divisions and adopting anti-takeover measures that make it
difficult but not impossible for an unwanted suitor to grab the
company.
   ``A lot of people were looking to see how the restructured
Lucky's would wind up,'' said Ron Rotter, an analyst for Morgan,
Olmstead, Kennedy & Gardner in Los Angeles.
   ``They're seeing a very healthy company that got out of its one
link, the Midwest, and is left with very strong market shares in
much of the country,'' he said.
   In its defensive restructuring, Lucky Stores closed its popular
Gemco department stores and sold other non-grocery divisions,
shedding thousands of employees in the process.
   Industry observers say the slimming gave company management the
impetus to make long-needed structural changes that have been
beneficial in the long run.
   The ``poison pill'' anti-takeover measure adopted during the
Edelman battle clash limits the voting power of any shareholder who
acquires more than 10 percent of Lucky's stock.
   Today, the company is a major force in the discount supermarket
business. Its main competitors are Oakland-based Safeway _ the
nation's largest grocery chain _ in Northern California and Von's
and Ralph's in Southern California.
   ``The one thing that makes them (Lucky's) successful is they
have a clearly defined identity as the every-day, low-price
leader,'' said Rotter. ``Even the competition will admit that they
are the king at that.
   ``Other stores are constantly shifting what their identity is,''
Rotter said.
   If successful, American Stores is expected to merge its weaker
Alpha Beta grocery chain in California with Lucky's stores,
according to Ziegler.
   ``I think it makes a lot of sense for American Stores, and
Lucky's management would get a chance to shake up Alpha Beta,'' he
said.
   If the Dublin-based chain fights the bid, its might attempt a
leveraged buyout or to seek a ``white knight'' friendly suitor to
make a more attractive offer. But Lucky Stores, which had been
exploring a possible acquisition of Ralph's and further expansion
in the food retailing business, may not be able to stand on its own
through a second takeover battle, analysts said.
   Until Tuesday, the company's stock had been creeping up
gradually since the October stock market crash. It stood at $35 a
share last Oct. 1, then fell to $21 before recovering to the levels
it held before the American Stores offer.

<HEAD>Trump Says He Would End Resorts Bid If Griffin Doesn't Seek His
Stock</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Resorts-Glance</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROGER GILLOTT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   In an unexpected twist, real estate developer
Donald Trump has offered to end his bid for Resorts International
Inc. and back a rival offer by entertainer Merv Griffin _ but only
if Griffin agrees only to seek stock with lesser voting rights than
that owned by Trump.
   ``Mr. Trump's position is quite simple,'' his attorney, Jack
Nusbaum of New York said Tuesday. ``If Mr. Griffin wishes to buy
the (other) stock and become Mr. Trump's silent partner, God bless
him.''
   Griffin _ who raised his cash offer for Resorts by $70 million
to $295 million on Tuesday _ quickly rejected Trump's proposal as
``ludicrous,'' said spokesman Mark Gill.
   ``We are trying to buy the entire company,'' Gill quoted Griffin
as saying. ``We aren't interested in fooling around with portions
or in sparring on the board with Mr. Trump.''
   Trump, who is Resorts' chairman, controls 88 percent of the
company's voting power by owning nearly all of its 752,000 Class B
common shares, which have 100 votes each.
   The company also has 5.7 million Class A common shares with one
vote each. Trump owns none of those shares.
   Nusbaum said if Griffin amended his offer to seek only the Class
A stock, Trump would withdraw his bid and recommend that
shareholders accept Griffin's.
   Griffin on raised his cash bid for all of the company's stock to
$45.73 per share, from his initial offer of $35 per share made last
week.
   Trump is offering $22 per share for the Resorts stock he doesn't
already own, principally its Class A shares.
   Resorts' Class A stock price jumped $3.62{ to $32.25 on Tuesday.
That is up from $21.87{ before Griffin began his overtures.
   The entertainer's privately-held investment concern, Griffin
Co., said it decided to boost its offer after spending the weekend
studying Resorts appraisal documents released late Friday by Trump,
a New York-based real estate developer.
   Those documents show a $1.3 billion appraisal of Resorts
properties, including a when-completed value for its luxurious but
troubled Taj Mahal hotel-casino in Atlantic City, N.J.
   Resorts, which is based on North Miami, Fla., has operations in
New Jersey and the Bahamas.
   The documents also say the appraiser would be willing to support
a $550 million bank mortgage loan secured by Resorts. That is the
amount Trump has said will be needed to complete the Taj Mahal,
whose estimated total price has ballooned to $938.5 million
currently from $535 million four years ago.
   A $500 million suit Griffin filed Monday in New York federal
court accused Trump of failing to disclose ``material facts,''
including the $1.3 billion appraisal, to Resorts shareholders in
making his offer. It also accused Trump and Resorts directors of
breaching fiduciary duty by refusing to consider the Griffin offer.
   Because Griffin's offer is contingent on getting the backing of
Trump and Trump has repeatedly said he won't agree to that
condition, Resorts' board has declined to pursue Griffin's
proposal, saying it is moot.
   Griffin's offer also hinges on Trump agreeing to terminate a
five-year management contract worth an estimated $100 million to
operate Resorts' properties. Trump also has spurned that condition.

<HEAD>Justice Department to Sue Trump on Stock Purchase</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Justice Department says it will sue real
estate developer Donald Trump for allegedly violating federal
notification provisions in his purchases of stock in Holiday Corp.
and Bally Manufacturing Corp.
   At the request of the Federal Trade Commission, the department
said it will file a lawsuit accusing Trump of violating the
Hart-Scott-Rodino Act fro Aug. 22 through Nov. 9, 1986 when he
bought stock in Memphis, Tenn.-based Holiday without complying with
reporting and waiting-period requirements.
   The suit also will accuse Trump, an operator of hotels and
casinos, of violating the act from Nov. 13, 1986 through Jan. 22,
1987 when he bought stock in Bally without complying with the law's
requirements.
   Discussions are under way to determine if a settlement can be
reached, the department said in a statement issued Tuesday.
   The act imposes notification and waiting requirements on
companies and people over a certain size that are contemplating
mergers or purchases of stocks or assets.
   The law is intended to improve antitrust enforcement by ensuring
advance notice to the government of significant mergers and similar
transactions.
   Trump sought control of Bally, a Chicago-based hotel and
amusements company, in 1987 but ended the attempt after Bally
agreed to buy 2.6 million shares back from him.
   Holiday disclosed in September 1986, amid unconfirmed takeover
rumors, that Trump had purchased between 2 percent and 5 percent of
its stock. Holiday later underwent a recapitalization and adopted a
``poison pill'' takeover defense to thwart potential suitors.
   Separately, the Justice Department said it will sue Wickes
Companies Inc. of Santa Monica, Calif., accusing the company of
violating the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act in its purchase of stock in the
Owens-Corning Fiberglass Corp. of Toledo, Ohio in late 1986.
   But the department will file a proposed consent decree under
which Wickes, which sells lumber and other building materials,
would pay $300,000 to settle the matter.
   Sanford C. Sigoloff, Wickes chairman and chief executive
officer, issued a statement saying his company did not believe it
violated the disclosure requirements but settled the matter to
avoid litigation costs.
   Sigoloff also contended Wickes had filed under the law in
connection with the stock purchase and the FTC initially had
cleared the filing.
   ``This settlement involves a long-standing technical dispute
between the FTC and the investment community over the use of option
agreements under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Rules,'' Sigoloff stated.
   In a third case, the department said it will accuse Roxboro
Investments Ltd. and a subsidiary, First City Financial Corp. Ltd.,
both of Vancouver, British Columbia, and three officers of the
companies, with violating the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act. They will be
accused based on their purchase in early 1986 of stock in Ashland
Oil Inc. of Russell, Ky.
   The three officers are Samuel Belzberg, president of Roxboro and
First City, and Hyman Belzberg and William Belzberg, vice
presidents of the two companies.
   The complaint will accuse the two companies and the three
officers of violating the act from Feb. 19 through April 2, 1986
when they bought Ashland stock without complying with some of the
law's requirements.
   First City attorneys issued a statement late Tuesday saying they
had been discussing a settlement with the department and believed a
final agreement would be reached soon.

<HEAD>Japanese Construction Companies Want Meeting With U.S. Firms Over
Trade</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japanese construction companies have proposed a
meeting with their U.S. counterparts to help defuse tension over a
construction trade issue causing serious friction between their
respective governments, according to industry officials.
   Officials of the Japan Federation of Construction Contractors
said Tuesday it sent a letter proposing the meeting in response to
an unofficial approach recently made by the International
Engineering and Construction Industries Council (IECIC) in the
United States.
   The Japanese move came following last week's breakdown in
negotiations over the U.S. demand that Japan allow U.S. companies
to participate in various construction projects in Japan.
   The United States has given Japan two weeks in which to come up
with a satisfactory response, or face retaliation.
   Last week, the Japanese government advised U.S. Commerce
Secretary William Verity that it was ``working hard in order to
present a further substantive offer'' and a fresh round of talks
was expected to start in Washington this week.
   According to officials of the construction federation, the
letter noted the dispute has been escalating and the two nations'
differing viewpoints may have arisen from a ``perception gap.'' The
two trade rganizations should hold a private-sector meeting and
find the ways of cooperating to defuse the tension, the letter
stated.
   Officials said construction companies in other countries had
strong interest in gaining access to the Japanese market, where
projects worth more than 50 trillion yen _ about $393 billion at
current exchange rates _ are undertaken annually.
   The federation last May established a special office to handle
queries from other countries on legal and other procedures for
taking part in construction projects in Japan, and reportedly
received more than 30 queries.

<HEAD>Black & Decker Withdraws American Standard Offer</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VALERIE MEEHAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hostile suitor Black & Decker Corp. has dropped
its bid for American Standard Inc., allowing the target company's
$2.45 billion leveraged buyout to go forward.
   Black & Decker's announcement Tuesday that it would drop its
months-long pursuit of American Standard followed a bizarre turn of
events that halted trading in the company's stock for several hours
for no apparent reason.
   American Standard agreed last week to a $78 a share leveraged
buyout led by the investment firm Kelso & Co., thwarting the rival
$77 a share, $2.4 billion bid from Black & Decker.
   Under the agreement reached Tuesday with American Standard, the
Towson-based tool and appliance manufacturer withdrew its hostile
tender offer and agreed not to purchase American Standard stock
until Kelso had an opportunity to pursue the leveragd buyout.
   Kelso will pay Black & Decker $25 million for withdrawing its
bid, and Black & Decker reserved the right to mount another
takeover of American Standard if Kelso terminated its offer or
failed to acquire shares by May 2.
   ``Seventy-seven (dollars) was our top price,'' said Barbara
Lucas, a Black & Decker spokeswoman. Ms. Lucas also said Black &
Decker initially had thought Kelso would be unable to finance its
proposal, but tht apparently was not the case.
   An American Standard spokeswoman said the company had no comment
on the agreement.
   Earlier Tuesday, the New York Stock Exchange halted trading in
Black & Decker and American Standard shares for three hours in
anticipation of an announcement by Black & Decker that never
materialized.
   NYSE Vice President Richard Torrenzano said Black & Decker
``initiated a call'' to the exchange and ``shared with us
information concerning the American Standard bid which materially
could affect the price of their stock.''
   But after trading was halted at 10:46 a.m. EST, several
conversations took place between Black & Decker and exchange
officials before it was determined that no announcement was
forthcoming.
   The exchange also conferred with American Standard, ``who
advised us that it knows of no reason why trading in its stock
should not resume,'' Torrenzano said. The exchange resumed trading
trading in both stocks at 1:43 p.m. EST.
   The stock exchange most often halts trading when announcements
that could affect a company's stock price are anticipated.
Typically, however, trading is only suspended for about 30 minutes
while news is being disseminated, Torrenzano said.
   It was unclear immediately whether the unusual turn of events
would provoke an investigation by market regulators such as the
Securities and Exchange Commission.
   On the day, American Standard shares dipped 12{ cents to $76.62{
per share on the NYSE. Black & Decker rose 37{ cents to $20 a share.
   Black & Decker made its initial offer of $56 a share in late
January, and sweetened it several times in response to rejections
by American Standard.
   American Standard, a New York-based plumbing and air
conditioning equipment maker, several weeks ago proposed a
defensive recapitalization aimed at making the company a more
expensive takeover target by loading it up with new debt.
   Wall Street analyst Cornelius V. Sewell said the buyout led by
Kelso would leave American Standard with a ``some very heavy debt.''
   ``They will presumably have a negative book value,'' said
Sewell, of Argus Research Corp. in New York.
   Sewell speculated that American Standard was likely to sell its
transportation products division, valued at about $600 million, to
help pay off buyout costs.

<HEAD>Koppers Rejects Latest Offer From Beazer-Shearson</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Koppers Co. has spurned a sweetened $1.6
billion cash buyout offer from British investor Brian Beazer and
the investment firm Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. and said it still
was pursuing alternative plans to remain independent.
   ``The board continues to believe that the company remaining
independent is a superior alternative to accepting your offer,''
Chairman Charles R. Pullin told Beazer in a letter released Tuesday
by Koppers.
   The Beazer-Shearson group raised its offer on Sunday to $56 per
share from $45 per share for the Pittsburgh construction materials,
paving services and chemicals company.
   Pullin also declined Beazer's invitation to negotiate a friendly
merger.
   Koppers stock declined 50 cents to $57 a share Tuesday on the
New York Stock Exchange.
   Koppers announced earlier it was considering a recapitalization
plan that might include a special cash dividend to shareholders,
along with equity interest in the recapitalized company. Such a
program would make Koppers a more expensive takeover target because
of the debt it would incur to make the cash payment to shareholders.
   Koppers said two major banks, which it declined to identify,
have offered to arrange $1.125 billion in credit to fund the
recapitalization.
   Koppers has also said it might sell all or part of the building
materials and paving services businesses sought by Beazer.
   The British investor has indicated he might settle for just
those parts of Koppers. Previously, he said he would sell the
chemicals operations if BNS succeeded in the hostile tender offer
it launched March 3.
   BNS holds 1.6 million, or 7.3 percent, of Koppers' outstanding
common shares.

<HEAD>First RepublicBank Breakup An Option To Attract Buyers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ailing First RepublicBank Corp. may have to divest
itself of some of its banks to become more attractive to investors,
experts say.
   First RepublicBank, weakened by a run on deposits and recent
multimillion-dollar losses, received a $1 billion injection of
capital last week from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
   But because it could take as much as $5 billion to rescue the
nation's 13th-largest bank holding company, banking regulators are
considering selling First RepublicBank's individual operations as a
marketing alternative.
   FDIC Chairman L. William Seidman said such a move ``certainly is
an option.''
   No spokesman for FirstRepublic Bank was available Tuesday to
comment on the idea.
   ``The first thing you think of is splitting the company into
bite-size morsels,'' said James Sexton, a former FDIC director of
supervision who is a consultant at Bracewell & Patterson, an
Austin, Texas law firm.
   The holding company's banks in major markets could be packaged
together or in regional or in statewide combinations, analysts
said. The holding company has banks in Dallas, Austin, Houston and
San Antonio.
   ``It's a very large bank for someone else to acquire,'' said
Tanya Azarchs, a banking analyst with New York-based Standard &
Poor's Corp. ``I don't see anyone on the scene that's willing to do
that.''
   Although the breakup of the holding company could make it more
accessible to investors, some argue it would be better if the
company remained intact.
   ``These banks are intertwined, having common management,
borrowers and computer systems,'' Sexton said. ``Breaking off
chunks presents some tough administrative problems.''
   The bank holding company already is consolidating some of its
banks, which could make a breakup more difficult. First
RepublicBank already has cut the number of banks from 103 to 73,
and plans to consolidate until only 40 banks are left.
   First RepublicBank reported a 1987 loss of $656.8 million, $3.92
billion in problem assets and had deposit outflows of more than $2
billion this year. Its assets total about $33.2 billion.

<HEAD>Dollar Down In Quiet Trading; Gold Prices Rise</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar fell against most major currencies in
quiet early trading in Europe today. Gold prices rose.
   In Tokyo, where the business day ends as Europe's begins, the
dollar closed at 127.15 yen, up 0.08 yen from Tuesday's close. But
later, in London, the dollar was quoted lower at 126.92 yen.
   ``The trading was quiet in the absence of market-affecting news
and notable movements among participants,'' said Ken Iiya of the
Bank of Tokyo in Japan.
   Other dollar rates at mid-morning, compared with late Tuesday's
rates, included: 1.6928 West German marks, down from 1.6935; 1.3940
Swiss francs, down from 1.4015; 5.7540 French francs, unchanged;
1.9003 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9015; 1,252.90 Italian lire,
down from 1,253.25; and 1.2455 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2468.
   In London, the dollar also fell against the the British pound
which was quoted at $1.8357, more expensive than $1.8300 late
Tuesday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $449.60 a troy ounce,
compared with late Tuesday's $448.75. At mid-morning today, the
city's five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $450.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $449.75 at noon, up from $448.50
late Tuesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose 19 cents an ounce to close at
$452.06 bid.
   Silver was quoted in London today at a bid price of $6.48 a troy
ounce, up from late Tuesday's $6.46.

   The dollar, which fell sharply against the Japanese
yen Tuesday, recovered slightly today, while stock prices also
rebounded moderately in Tokyo trading.
   After opening at 126.91 yen, the dollar edged up and closed at
127.15 yen, the day's high, up 0.08 yen from the close of 127.07
yen on Tuesday, when the dollar fell 1.28 yen.
   ``The trading was quiet in the absence of market-affecting news
and notable movements among participants,'' said Ken Iiya of the
Bank of Tokyo.
   The market also was nervous about possible intervention by the
Bank of Japan to support the dollar, he said.
   Japan's central bank reportedly bought dollars to prop up the
sagging U.S. currency when it fell to near 126.90 yen Tuesday,
traders said.
   The prevalent market view is that the dollar lacks strength,
Iiya said.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Average of 225 selected
issues, a 123.51-point loser Tuesday, gained 52.48 points, or 0.2
percent, closing at 25,895.23.
   ``The afternoon trading was not active as corporate investors
took a cautious attitude, waiting for any market-affecting news,
such as the U.S. consumer price index for February, which will be
released later in the evening,'' said Toshihisa Haruumi of Wako
Securities.
   Most buy orders centered around large-capital issues, such as
steels and heavy electricals, and they boosted the overall volume
of trading, he said.
   The volume of first section trading today was a heavy 1.5
billion shares, up from 1.1 billion shares Tuesday.
   Besides major heavy industries, chemicals and papers were
popular. Shipbuilding issues, pulps and many issues of securities
companies and banks also rose.

   Here is a rundown of the historical cost of
mailing a first-class letter in the United States.
   In the first half of the 19th century the cost of sending a
single sheet of paper 40 miles or less was between 6 cents and 8
cents, with the cost rising by distance. Letters going 400 miles
and over cost 25 cents to send, per sheet of paper.
   By the middle of that century postage stamps were introduced,
along with standard rates regardless of distance traveled. These
started at 2 cents per half-ounce in 1863, rising to 3 cents in
1883.
   In 1885, the current first-class standard based on one-ounce was
started. The one-ounce rates since then have been:
   July 1, 1885: 2 cents.
   Nov. 3, 1917: 3 cents.
   July 1, 1919: 2 cents.
   July 6, 1932: 3 cents.
   Aug. 1, 1958: 4 cents.
   Jan. 7, 1963: 5 cents.
   Jan. 7, 1968: 6 cents.
   May 16, 1971: 8 cents.
   March 2, 1974: 10 cents.
   Dec. 31, 1975: 13 cents.
   May 29, 1978: 15 cents.
   March 22, 1981: 18 cents.
   Nov. 1, 1981: 20 cents.
   Feb. 17, 1985: 22 cents.

<TEXT>
   When the new postage rates take effect April
3, Americans will be using special ``E'' stamps on an interim basis.
   The stamps were printed bearing the letter E, instead of the
amount of postage, because the new first-class rate was not known
in time for printing of the millions of stamps needed for a new
rate to take effect.
   The E stamps will represent 25 cents postage.
   In addition some post offices should have supplies of the
25-cent stamp featuring the portrait of adventure writer Jack
London, which was introduced last year.
   And most offices have supplies of 1-cent, 2-cent and 3-cent
stamps to combine with current 22-cent stamps to reach the new
quarter rate.
   Undenominated stamps have been used four times in the past,
although the basic design of the stamp has changed.
   The A, B, C and D stamps all showed the head of an eagle, each
in a different color.
   The E stamp carries a multi-colored space-based image of the
planet with the word Earth printed beneath.
   The stamp also carries the notation ``Domestic'' since it can be
used only for mail within the country. Mail traveling to other
nations requires stanps that show their denomination.

   Stock prices were lower at midday Wednesday,
depressed by continued lack of trading volume and concern about a
further rise in the value of the pound.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-stock index was down 7.0
points, or 0.4 percent, at 1,828.4.
   Volume was light at 221.2 million shares, compared with 211.7
million at the same time Tuesday.
   The pound's rise was ``holding everything back,'' one dealer
said, adding that many investors were waiting to see if the Bank of
England would take further steps to halt the currency's rise. The
central bank cleared the way last week for a half-point cut in
commercial banks' base lending rate to 8.5 percent.

   The price of a stamp will rise to a quarter on
April 3, the first hike in 38 months and one the postmaster general
said today he hopes will hold for at least that long.
   ``We hope we will go that long or longer the next time''
Postmaster General Anthony Frank said on CBS-TV's ``This Morning''
show.
   Frank said the biggest reaction to the higher rates has come
from major business mailers who will face the largest increase, and
this could affect the amount of so-called ``junk '' mail sent out.
   ``I think there could be a little more space in your mailbox
over the next few months,'' Frank said.
   Most noticeable to the public, of course, is the new first-class
quarter rate, but the overall hikes affect many other areas too
including mailing bills, books and magazines and other items.
   The new rates, for example, would add about $1.15 to the annual
cost of mailing a weekly newsmagazine to one home. Utilities,
credit card companies and department stores will have to spend
about 36 cents more, annually, to bill one customer. The cost of an
average book club mailing will rise by about 50 cents.
   The increases are needed to avoid deficits for the agency that
could reach $5 billion in 1989, postal officials said Tuesday in
announcing the April 3 rate hike. The last rate increase was in
February 1985, and the Postal Service lost more than $220 million
last year.
   The new 25-cent letter rate is part of a broad series of rate
changes affecting all types of mail.
   ``These are the first adjustments in general postage rates in
more than three years. They reflect the higher costs the Postal
Service is experiencing,'' said John N. Griesemer, chairman of the
agency's board of governors.
   The Postal Service is required to break even _ over time _ by
the 1970 law that made it an independent federal agency and ended
the taxpayer subsidy for the mail.
   Frank said post offices across the country will expand window
service during the next two weeks to help customers cope with the
changes.
   But while service is being expanded temporarily to help during
the changeover, recently imposed reductions in post office hours
and services are not related to the rate increases and are likely
to remain in effect. Those cutbacks result from congressional
action in December, while these rate hikes have been in the works
for nearly a year.
   Facing the biggest increase will be the so-called ``junk'' mail,
third-class advertising material that the independent Postal Rate
Commission concluded wasn't paying its fair share.
   Advertising mail prices will increase 24.9 percent, compared to
hikes of 18.1 percent for newspapers and magazines and 14.7 percent
for items sent by individuals.
   The new 25-cent first class price means that sending a one-ounce
letter will take about the same bite from the average budget as in
1932. Adjusted for inflation, the 3-cent postage rate introduced in
1932 would amount to 25.5 cents today.
   The price for each additional ounce of mail will rise from 17
cents to 20 cents. The cost to mail a post card will increase from
14 cents to 15 cents.
   For mail going outside the country the rate will be 45 cents per
half-ounce to most areas. For mail to Mexico the rate is the same
as in the United States, while sending a letter to Canada will cost
30 cents per ounce.
   The agency did cut, from 7 cents to 5 cents, the minimum charge
for a business using pre-paid envelopes that allow consumers to
reply without a stamp. That, officials said, may encourage more
businesses to offer the service.
   The Postal Rate Commission said it determined that third-class
advertising mail was responsible for more postal service costs than
it was paying, and thus should have a larger increase.
   The minimum rate for third class mail will jump from 12.5 cents
to 16.7 cents and the per pound rate will rise from 38 cents to 48
cents.
   For non-profit advertising mail the minimum rate will increase
from 8.5 cents to 8.7 cents.
   Second class mail, newspapers and magazines for the most part,
face overall increases of just over 18 percent.
   Newspapers sent within the county will rise to 9.8 cents per
pound and 3.4 to 5.9 cents per piece. The current rate is 9.1 cents
per pound and 3.1 to 4.9 cents per item.
   A new $8.75 rate for the highly competitive Express overnight
mail was set for packages of 8 ounces or less.
   A special, nondenominated ``E'' stamp has been prepared for use
when the new rates take effect.
   Because the agency had no way of knowing what rate would be
recommended, it had the E stamps printed for use at whatever the
rate turned out to be. The same procedure was used the last four
times rates were raised.

   The U.S. economy grew at a brisk 4.8 percent annual rate in the
final three months of 1987 while February consumer prices were
modestly higher, indicating that inflation was under control, the
government reported today.
   The Commerce Department said the gross national product, the
broadest measure of economic health, grew from October to December
at the fastest clip in about two years.
   It was the second upward revision in GNP growth. A month ago the
government put GNP growth at 4.5 percent, up from a 4.2 percent
original estimate made in January immediately after the quarter
ended.
   Today's revisions showed more strength than previously believed
in such key sectors as consumer spending, business investment and
U.S. exports.
   In a second report, the department said U.S. corporations'
after-tax profits rose 1.6 percent in the fourth quarter, the
poorest showing since profits fell 3.7 percent in the first quarter
of 1987. Profits were up 5.5 percent in the third quarter.
   In its report on inflation, the Labor Department said that last
month's consumer prices rose a modest 0.2 percent due to lower food
and energy costs.
   Food prices fell 0.3 percent after rising 0.3 percent in
January. Energy costs, which had fallen 0.7 percent in the
preceding month, fell 0.6 percent last month.
   So far this year, consumer prices have been increasing at a rate
of 3.2 percent. That compares to the moderate 4.4 percent rate for
all of 1987 and the scant 1.1 percent 1986 increase.
   On Tuesday, the Commerce Department said that orders to U.S.
factories for durable goods _ items expected to last at least three
years _ fell 1.8 percent in February to a seasonally adjusted
$111.4 billion, following an identical decline in January.
   In other economic news on Tuesday, the Dow Jones average of 30
industrial stocks fell 0.99 point to 2,066.15; the dollar was mixed
against other major currencies; and bond prices were little changed
in light trading.
   February marked the first time since the spring of 1986 that
durable goods orders declined for two consecutive months.
   But some economists maintained that manufacturing companies
still were enjoying good business because the weaker dollar has
boosted export demand.
   Cynthia Latta, an economist with Data Resources Inc., said that
while new orders fell in February the total backlog of unfilled
orders rose 0.7 percent, the 12th consecutive monthly increase.
   ``This backlog suggests that factories can keep humming along
for a while even though new orders dropped,'' she said.
   Still, analysts said, the back-to-back declines showed
businesses were cutting back on orders in the early part of 1988 in
an effort to get control of bulging inventories. Inventories
swelled at the end of 1987 while consumer demand fell.

<HEAD>American Stores Offers $1.74 Billion For Lucky Stores</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY ROBERT MIMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SALT LAKE CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lucky Stores Inc.'s stock soared $14.50 a
share Tuesday after the major California supermarket chain received
a $1.74 billion tender offer from American Stores Co.
   If American Stores' $45-a-share bid is successful, it would
create the nation's largest grocery store chain. In heavy trading
on the New York Stock Exchange, Lucky's stock surged to close at
$46.375 a share. American Stores stock fell $2.62{ a share to
$57.87{.
   Officials at Lucky's headquarters in Dublin, Calif., would not
discuss the offer except to say company bylaws contain a ``poison
pill'' anti-takeover provision, which limits the voting power of
any shareholder who acquires more than 10 percent of Lucky's stock.
   Company officials noted in a statement that the limited voting
rights provision, which expires Dec. 22, may not be waived by the
company's board.
   Lucky, the nation's sixth largest grocery retailer, has 480
stores while American Stores, the third biggest, has 1,600 stores.
   In a letter to Lucky Stores Chairman John M. Lillie, American
Stores Chairman L.S. Skaggs said he would combine American's Alpha
Beta stores with Lucky's operation under the Lucky name.
   The letter, released Tuesday, praised Lucky's management and
marketing strategies and invited Lucky executives to stay on if the
deal is completed. Lucky's headquarters also would remain at
Dublin, Skaggs said.
   Officials at Salt Lake City-based American Stores would not
provide further details of their unsolicited offer and had no
comment beyond a brief press release, said senior vice president
Michael Miller.
   Recent rumors have suggested that American Stores itself may be
a takeover target, according to an analyst here who said his
company has extensive dealings with the company.
   Under that scenario, the bid for Lucky could be a defensive move
to make an acquisition of American Stores prohibitively expensive,
said the analyst, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   ``If American Stores doesn't get this acquisition, it puts the
spotlight on them. They may be more open to takeover than before,''
he said.
   Analysts agreed the Lucky-American Stores combination makes
sense.
   Susan C. Schmierer, a retail analyst with Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc., noted that the two companies operate in the same
general geographic areas and that both want to increase their
presence in California.
   ``I don't see any reason why it couldn't go through, given the
right kind of management finesse by American,'' she said.
   The bid for Lucky comes 16 months after takeover strategist
Asher Edelman formally dropped his hostile bid for the company in
return for Lucky's agreement to pay $2.8 million of his legal costs.
   Lucky thwarted Edelman partly by selling off non-grocery
divisions and adopting anti-takeover measures that make it more
difficult for an unwanted suitor to acquire the company.
   American Stores' most recent acquisition occurred in 1984 when
it took over Jewel Companies Inc., a Chicago-based grocery, drug
and convenience store chain, for $1.1 billion.
   The acquisition expanded American Stores' operations from just
over 1,000 retail outlets to 1,700 stores in 40 states and boosted
sales to about $15 billion a year.
   The company is organized into three divisions. The Skaggs
division operates supermarkets in the western United States;
American Superstores runs stores in the Midwest and the East; and
Osco Drug Stores operates stores nationwide, according to Value
Line Investment Survey.
   Store names include Acme, Jewel, Star, Buttrey, Skaggs, Skaggs
Alpha Beta and Osco Drug Stores.
   Lucky, with annual sales of about $7 billion, operates about 480
supermarkets and food centers in the West, Midwest and Southwest,
principally in California and Arizona.

   Many banks seem more willing to lend money to
poor countries abroad than to take a chance on redeveloping poor
neighborhoods in their own area, community representatives are
telling Congress.
   ``We're saying, `Look ... you lend billions of dollars across
the border and you can't lend to our community that is on this side
of the border,''' said Tony Reyes, mayor of San Luis, Ariz., a town
of 2,000 near Mexico.
   ``I don't think that is fair,'' he told the Senate Banking
Committee, which is reviewing compliance with the Community
Reinvestment Act of 1977.
   The law requires banks to lend in their depositors'
neighborhoods and prohibits ``redlining,'' the practice of denying
loans to an entire neighborhood based on the race or economic class
of its residents.
   It gives regulators the authority to block banks with poor
records from opening new branches or merging with other
institutions.
   ``Redlining hasn't disappeared,'' Sen. William Proxmire, the
committee chairman, said Tuesday. ``Neighborhoods are still
starving for credit. Too many bankers still think the grass is
greener elsewhere.''
   He noted that an estimated $5 billion in loans have been made in
poor neighborhoods as a result of the act, but said, ``That $5
billion pledged to developing neighborhoods is peanuts compared to
the $100 billion loaned to developing countries.''
   Despite a rating system by regulators that gives the vast
majority of banks high marks for their anti-redlining efforts, the
actual performance of most is poor, said Gale Cincotta, executive
director of the National Training and Information Center, a Chicago
community group.
   ``Hundreds of census tracts in low-income America did not
receive a penny in mortgage loans,'' she said.
   Proxmire, D-Wis., said that 97 percent of all lenders pass
Community Reinvestment Act reviews with flying colors and only
eight of 40,000 applications from banks seeking to merge or expand
have been denied in the past 10 years.
   ``How is it that so many neighborhoods are continuing to fail,
while so many lending institutions are continuing to pass?'' he
asked. ``This record ... raises questions about whether the
examination process has succeeded.''
   Allen J. Fishbein, general counsel of the Center for Community
Change, a Washington organization that provides training for
neighborhood groups, said progress in enforcing the law during the
late 70s has ``been virtually undone as a result of agency
indifference over the past five or six years.''
   Ms. Cincotta complained that bank examiners, in effect, rely on
community groups to enforce the law for them by filing complaints.
   She said that although examiners are well trained at judging the
financial soundness of a bank, many are poorly schooled in judging
a bank's fair housing or equal opportunity record.
   Jane Uebelhoer, legislative representative of ACORN (Association
of Community Organizations for Reform Now), said Congress should
revamp the regulators' rating system so that banks with poor
records get poor marks.
   The committee, which is reviewing enforcement of the act with an
eye toward possibly toughening it, planned a second session today
to hear from federal bank regulators.
   The House Banking Committee has discussed attaching provisions
strengthening the Community Revinvestment Act to legislation
primarily aimed at granting banks new investment powers.
   The Senate committee has already passed its version of that bill
but could go along with the House provisions if senators are
convinced by testimony this week that changes are needed.

<HEAD>Supreme Court Rules Against Estate Tax Exemption for Some Public
Housing Notes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court ruled today that short-term
notes used to finance public housing projects are not exempt from
federal estate taxes.
   The 8-0 ruling was a victory for the Reagan administration,
which said more than $260 million in federal tax revenue was at
stake.
   The dispute stems in part from a 1937 law Congress enacted to
stimulate local financing of housing projects. The act allowed
public housing agencies to issue tax-free obligations called
``project notes.''
   For some 47 years, it was assumed the law exempted the notes
from federal income tax but not from federal estate tax.
   But a federal judge in Illinois ruled in 1984 that the notes
were exempt from estate taxes as well. The decision touched off
widepsread efforts to market project notes and prompted those who
had paid estate taxes on the notes to seek refunds from the
government.
   Within months of the Illinois ruling, Congress enacted the
Deficit Reduction Act of 1984 that included a provision making the
project notes subject to estate, gift and inheritance taxes.
   The law took effect on June 19, 1984.
   Heirs to people who died before that date said the law cannot be
applied retroactively and they sought refunds from the government
for estate taxes they paid on project notes.
   But today the Supreme Court said the project notes have been
subject to the estate tax all along, even if the 1937 law did not
make that explicitly clear.
   Justice William J. Brennan, in his opinion for the court, said
the 1937 act was designed to exempt the project notes ``only from
the normal tax'' _ that is federal income tax and surtaxes that
were in effect at the time.
   ``Exemptions from taxation are not to be implied. They must be
unambiguously proved,'' Brennan said. ``On the rare occasions when
Congress exempted property from estate taxation it has generally
adverted explicitly to that tax rather than generically to `all
taxation.'''
   He said it would not make sense for Congress to grant special
exemptions to the project notes without stating it explicitly since
the purpose of such an exemption would be to attract investors.
   ``If Congress really wanted to create an especially broad tax
exemption for project notes ... one would expect it to do so
notoriously enough to attract investors, not surreptitiously enough
to evade detection for half a century,'' Brennan said.
   He added that today's ruling made it unnecessary for the
justices to decide whether the 1984 budget reduction law chould be
applied retroactively.
   The ruling reverses lower court decisions granting estate
exemptions to project notes.
   Justice Anthony M. Kennedy did not take part in the ruling.
   The case is U.S. vs. Crocker National Bank, 86-1521.

<HEAD>Profits Up 8.4 Percent in 1987</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After-tax corporate profits shot up 8.4
percent in 1987, a sharp rebound from the previous year when
profits declined, the government said today.
   The Commerce Department said that after-tax profits rose to
$137.4 billion last year, an increase of $10.6 billion from 1986,
when profits had actually fallen by 1 percent.
   Analysts credited the turnaround in profits in part to the
weaker dollar, which has boosted sales of American products on
overseas markets. In addition, they said that labor wage demands
remained subdued during the year.
   ``The increase in profits for 1987 was outstanding, especially
when you consider that corporate taxes were substantially hiked
during the year because of the Tax Reform Act,'' said Allen Sinai,
chief economist of The Boston Co.
   ``Particularly, for U.S. manufacturing, 1987 was a turnaround
year,'' Sinai said. ``Exports rose and American companies benefited
tremendously from previous cost-cutting measures.''
   Sinai predicted further gains in corporate profits in 1988 but
he said the rate of increase would slow somewhat.
   Some of that slowdown was evident in the fourth quarter with
after-tax profits rising 1.6 percent following a 5.5 percent gain
in the third quarter.

   Stocks remained stalled this morning in light
trading, which brokers called a reflection of the uncertainty that
has pervaded the market following the post-crash highs reached last
week.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which barely budged in
slack trading Tuesday, fell 2.16 points to 2,063.99 by 11 a.m. on
Wall Street.
   Among broader market indicators, the New York Stock Exchange
composite index of all listed issues fell 0.05 to 151.47. The
American Stock Exchange's market value index rose 0.64 to 299.44.
   Gaining stocks narrowly outnumbered losers on the NYSE, with 634
up, 584 down and 503 unchanged. Volume totaled 53.73 million shares
after the first 90 minutes.
   ``We're just standing here,'' said William King, head trader at
Nikko Securities Co. International in New York. ``You need money to
take stocks up, and the money's not there.''
   As in recent sessions, takeover-related trading was the most
active area. Lucky Stores, target of a $45-a-share acquisition
offer from American Stores, rose 1~ to 45| after surging 14{ on

<HEAD>Northwest To Ban Smoking On Domestic Flights</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: new throughout to UPDATE with details, quotes from news
conference, CLARIFY smoking continues on Hawaiian, international
flights; no pick up.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Northwest Airlines said today it will ban
smoking on all of its domestic flights except to and from Hawaii,
making it the first major U.S. airline to mandate a smoke-free
travel environment in the air.
   The restrictions will begin on April 23, the same day a federal
law is to go into effect banning smoking on all domestic flights of
two hours or less.
   Northwest noted in a statement that its program goes
``significantly beyond'' the requirements of the new law.
   In addition to flights within the contiguous 48 states, the
program, dubbed ``Northwest Clears the Air,'' will apply to flights
to and from Alaska, Mexico, Canada, Jamaica and the Cayman Islands.
   Flights to Hawaii and ovrseas will continue to offer smoking
sections because those flights ``carry a greater proportion of
foreign passengers who feel differently about the issue,'' the
airline said in a statement.
   A.B. Magary, the airline's executive vice president for
marketing, said a majority of passengers on international flights
are foreign and are ``not yet culturally ready to move in this
direction.''
   He said the ban ``is a response to our customers' and employees'
requests.'' A Northwest study showed that nine out of 10 passengers
prefer to sit in the no-smoking section of a plane.
   Magary said, however, that the airline is not going
``macrobiotic.'' The ban ``does not imply some broader-scale effort
to rid the United States of cigarettes,'' he said.
   Northwest said it will offer refunds to passengers who purchased
tickets before today and who have been assigned seats in the
smoking section if they decline to fly because of the new policy.
   Travel agents on Tuesday complimented Northwest on its plans.
   ``We're hearing from our customers that it's time to go more
toward banning,'' said Jay Harrington, regional president of
Uniglobe, a national chain of travel agency franchises. ``We think
it's inevitable it will be banned on all aircraft.''
   In the short run, he said, Northwest might lose some customers
who smoke heavily, but generally, passengers choose flights on the
basis of convenience and price.
   Air Canada, which banned smoking on some flights between Canada
and the United States, said it gained customers as a result of its
no-smoking policy.
   Northwest would have had to eliminate smoking on many of its
flights anyway because about 80 percent of all U.S. flights last
two hours or less.
   By extending the ban to all flights, Northwest could be avoiding
confusion expected to result from the new law. For example, it was
not clear how the law would apply to flights that are scheduled to
take under two hours but are delayed.
   More important, Northwest could be saving itself some costs.
Airlines must install and maintain filters that are difficult and
costly to clean, and they spend additional money on air
conditioning to recirculate fresh air.
   The new law, part of a spending bill signed by President Reagan
in December, is a compromise version of no-smoking bills that the
House and Senate passed earlier. The federal ban will last for two
years. Smoking cigars and pipes already is prohibited on airlines.
   Under the new law, passengers who insist on lighting up will
face civil fines of as much as $1,000, and passengers who tamper
with smoke alarms in airplane lavatories will be liable for as much
as $2,000 in penalties.
   Northwest Airlines said it would launch an advertising campaign
to promote the program on Saturday.
   Attending Northwest's press conference were representatives of
the U.S. Surgeon General's office, the American Cancer Society, the
American Heart Association and the American Lung Association.
   James Swamley, managing director of the American Lung
Association, credited Northwest with ``jetting ahead of the
industry.''
   Separately, Singapore Airlines unveiled plans to introduce the
first no-smoking commercial flights in Southeast Asia next month.
   Four of the 14 daily shuttle flights between Singapore and Kuala
Lumpur, the capital of neighboring Malaysia, will bar smoking
starting April 4, said a news release from the
government-controlled carrier. The trip takes about 45 minutes.

   Grain and soybean futures prices opened mixed to
slightly higher today on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   One analyst called traders ``gun-shy.'' That proved an accurate
description as soybeans opened strongly, but then turned
surprisingly calm.
   Traders said there was a lack of follow-through buying after
contract highs were set Tuesday for new-crop months in soybeans.
   Wheat, meanwhile, was firm on talk of export business with India
and the Soviet Union.
   On the open, wheat was 1{ cents to 2\ cents higher, with the
contract for May delivery at $3.09 a bushel; corn was unchanged to
{ cent higher, with May at $2.07 a bushel; oats were \ cent lower,

   Live cattle opened .40 cent lower to .02 cent higher, with April
at 74.05 cents a pound; feeder cattle .05 cent to .25 cent lower,
with March at 82.30 cents a pound; live hogs were .55 cent lower to

   The House showed bipartisan support today for
a $1.1 trillion fiscal 1989 budget that averts deep cuts in
domestic programs and glosses over a failure to comply fully with
Congress' deficit-reduction agreement with President Reagan.
   Debate began on the plan approved last week by the House Budget
Committee with a procedural vote that was adopted without a roll
call _ unheard-of during the recent years of pitched budget battles.
   ``We've got a miracle,'' said House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas,
expecting easy passage later in the day.
   ``This degree of bipartisanship in developing a budget
resolution is truly unprecedented,'' said Rep. Delbert L. Latta of
Ohio, senior Republican on the budget committee.
   The plan would leave a deficit of about $134 billion in the
spending year beginning Oct. 1 and would stay within the limits of
the Gramm-Rudman budget-balancing law. The deficit would be about
$5 billion higher than with Reagan's budget, mostly because the
president proposed to sell off more government assets.
   The lawmakers' election-year plan would freeze or slightly trim
most domestic agencies. It would spend $1.5 billion on AIDS
research _ a little more than Reagan proposed _ but not boost the
space program as much as the president asked. It rejects his plans
to cancel aid to mass transit and other popular domestic subsidies.
   As in the president's plan, the government's total cash outlays
on the military, foreign aid and certain domestic programs would be
held to levels set last fall when the president and congressional
leaders held a budget ``summit.''
   However, that agreement also contained limits for budget
authority _ the legal obligations by agencies for spending that
could stretch over more than one fiscal year. The House plan would
violate the agreement if it weren't for some accounting wizardry.
   To avoid breaking the limit on budget authority, the House
Budget Committee shifted about $4 billion in the domestic budget,
mostly ongoing agriculture credit expenses, outside of the
categories controlled by the summit pact.
   The accounting change made room for the kind of budget lawmakers
support _ one that would not terminate urban and rural development
programs and other items the president sought to end.
   In its report to the House, the budget committee said the
technical changes were the only way it could find to hit the budget
marks for both outlays and budget authority.
   ``It is not our intention that this (budget authority)
adjustment not result in higher outlays in FY 1989 than the $169.2
billion (domestic) ... allowed under the summit cap,'' the
committee said.
   Rep. William H. Gray III, D-Pa., chairman of the committee, said
he believed it stayed within the budget pact. ``The outlay is what
you're really going to be judged by,'' he said.
   Despite the committee language, the budget technique could lead
to higher spending allowances when the fiscal blueprint is
translated later into actual spending bills. The president's Office
of Management and Budget send a letter to Congress critical of the
approach and promising to monitor spending closely as the budget is
implemented.
   House action on the budget today was the earliest in years, as
Democratic leaders were keeping to their vow to put fiscal affairs
on schedule this year.
   Members of the Senate Budget Committee have begun private
meetings on their version. The two chambers must agree on identical
budgets by April 15 to meet their deadline.
   The budget resolution is a guideline for Congress' fiscal
legislation, and it does not require the president's signature.
   With the accounting changes, the House budget would hit exactly
the limits in the budget summit pact. Those are $299.5 billion in
budget authority and $294.0 billion in outlays for the military;
$148.1 billion in budget authority and $169.2 billion in outlays
for annually-appropriated domestic programs; and $18.1 billion in
budget authority and $16.1 billion in outlays on foreign aid.
   The summit agreement also included $14 billion in new taxes for
fiscal 1989. Those levies were enacted last December, and Congress
plans no further increases this year.
   The Gramm-Rudman law mandates a deficit of $136 billion in
fiscal 1989 as an interim step toward a balanced budget by fiscal
1993. Neither the House plan nor Reagan's met that mark without
relying on selling government assets _ which aren't counted under
Gramm-Rudman.
   However, both plans would be within $10 billion of the goal,
keeping below the threshold at which the law would mandate
automatic, across-the-board spending cuts.
   Those estimates are based on the White House assumptions for
economic growth and government performance next year. Estimates by
the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office, which are less
optimistic, show the deficit some $35 billion higher.

<HEAD>Rising College Costs A Major Concern For Young Families</HEAD>

   Richard and Stephanie Hack have not only picked
out where their two small children will be attending college after
the turn of the century _ they've already paid their tuition in
full.
   The Bethel Park, Pa., couple bought that peace of mind for about
$10,000 through a ``tuition-futures'' program that had been offered
for about three years at Duquesne University, their alma mater.
   Other young families may wish they had it so easy as they watch
tuition increases outpace inflation. The cost of some private
colleges, for instance, now comes close to the median price of a
single-family home _ around $80,000.
   Financial advisers and educators agree the only way to stay out
of the poor house, yet provide a college-bound child with a good
education, is to develop a strategic plan as early as possible.
   ``People need to save for a university just as they buy a
house,'' said Richard F. Rosser, president of the National
Association of Independent Colleges and Universities.
   It was for that reason that Duquesne, a small Roman Catholic
univeristy near Pittsburgh, developed its tuition-futures plan in
1985, a program Mrs Hack believes will benefit her children,
Melissa, 5, and Brian, 4. About a half-dozen other schools
established similar programs, but some of them, as Duquesne did
last week, have stopped taking new applicants due to unexpectedly
high tuition increases and falling interest rates on bonds, the
schools' main investment vehicle.
   Aside from the obvious drawbacks _ what if a grown child doesn't
want to go to college or to the one already paid for _ the program
seemed like a good deal. At Duquesne, for instance, the family of a
1-year-old eligible to go to college in 2005 would have paid a lump
sum of around $8,600 last fall to cover projected four-year tuition
of $102,600. The older the child, though, the higher the cost.
   Most investment advisers say a family could almost do the same
on their own by investing bit by bit in savings bonds or
certificates of deposits, although they wouldn't have the same tax
benefits enjoyed by the schools.
   Since Duquesne's trendsetting program, numerous programs and
proposals have emerged.
   In Washington, several bills are pending to set up tax-free
savings accounts resembling Individual Retirement Accounts to
finance education. President Reagan supports a tax-exempt savings
bond program.
   Six states _ Michigan, Indiana, Florida, Maine, Tennessee and
Wyoming _ have passed laws establishing prepayment tuitition plans,
according to the Education Commission of the States. (The Internal
Revenue Service just ruled the Michigan Education Trust had to pay
federal taxes on earnings, but individual investors wouldn't have
additional tax liabilities.)
   California, Illinois, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, Ohio,
Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Texas and West Virgina have
similar legislation pending, it said. And Illinois and North
Carolina have passed special savings bond plans, it said.
   On the commercial side of things, there's the College Savings
Bank. The Princeton, N.J., institution's main line of business is
to sell certificates of deposit with interest rates changing
annually to keep pace with rising college costs.
   Keeping track of what's available to students and families in
the way of investment plans, financial aid or scholarships is often
half the battle as college-sponsored programs come and go, new laws
evolve from state to state, or Congress and the Internal Revenue
Service get involved.
   ``There's just so much change going on,'' said John B. Cox, a
spokesman for the National Association of College and University
Business Officers. The non-profit group, based in Washington, D.C.,
publishes ``Alternative Approaches To Tuition Financing,''
available to the general public for $15. Many other guidebooks also
are available in book stores and colleges.
   Cox suggests that parents start out by selecting a few
prospective colleges, then contacting the financial aid departments
of each to see what programs the schools have or might be
considering.
   Here's a thumbnail look at some of the many programs being
offered, according to NACUBO and other sources:
   _Prepayment plans. Students have the option at some colleges and
universities of paying for all four years up front, thus avoiding
future tuition increases. About 50 institutions offer this program,
including a number of Ivy League schools like Brown University,
Cornell University, and Yale University.
   _Delayed prepayment or installation plans. A number of colleges
and universities allow tuition payments to be made in equal amounts
or installments during a semester or year. Some institutions
require a down payment of as much as 50 percent.
   _Tuition gift certificates. Sold by a handful of colleges,
including two-year schools, these certificates may be bought for a
designated number of credit hours or other tuition unit. Some are
transferable but most cannot be cashed in.
   _Interstate tuition plans. At least two regional consortiums _
on the West Coast and in New England _ offer some students a chance
to go to college out of state for slightly higher than the
residential rate. The program is only limited to participating
states and institutions. One of the groups, Western Interstate
Commission for Higher Education, also arranges for state-subsidized
tuition across state borders.
   _Loan programs. Besides commercial banks and thrifts, a number
of colleges and universities loan money directly to families or
students, although most are intended to pick up where federally
guaranteed student loans leave off. Several states, such as
Massachusetts, Connecticut, Maryland and New York, also provide
student loans.
   _Others. Work study programs and scholarships are available to a
broad range of students. Several research services will even help
track down obscure scholarships for a fee.

   A federal judge approved Texaco Inc.'s
financial reorganization plan today, clearing the way for the oil
giant to emerge from the nation's biggest corporate bankruptcy case.
   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Howard Schwartzberg issued the ruling at
midday after a day-and-a-half hearing on the proposal for resolving
Texaco's debts to its creditors.
   The confirmation of the plan should allow Texaco to emerge from
bankruptcy court protection by mid-April, which would be a year
after it filed to reorganize under Chapter 11 of the federal
bankruptcy code.
   Texaco had cleared one hurdle just before the hearing began
Tuesday, when it announced that dissident shareholders had dropped
their opposition to the plan.
   It also was announced Tuesday that 96 percent of the shares
voted by Texaco stockholders had supported the reorganization
proposal _ 174 million shares out of the 181 million voted. The
margin was far in excess of the two-thirds majority required by
federal law.
   Schwartzberg had been widely expected to approve the plan
despite lingering objections to certain provisions of the plan by
some shareholders _ notably takeover strategist Carl C. Icahn,
Texaco's biggest shareholder.
   Texaco was the biggest company ever to seek refuge in the
bankruptcy courts.
   Texaco filed under Chapter 11 contending it could not afford to
post an $11 billion bond while appealing a $10.3 billion judgment
held against it by Houston-based Pennzoil Co.
   The judgment stemmed from a November 1985 ruling by a Houston
jury that Texaco had interfered improperly with an agreement by
Pennzoil to acquire part of Getty Oil Co. before Texaco bought
Getty itself.
   Texaco agreed in December to pay Pennzoil $3 billion to settle
that dispute. The agreement formed the keystone of the bankruptcy
reorganization plan that Schwartzberg must confirm or reject after
the present series of hearings.
   Some of the dissident shareholders had objected to provisions in
the agreement that would free officers and advisers of Texaco,
Pennzoil Co., the former Getty Oil Co., the Sarah Getty Trust and
the J. Paul Getty Museum from all liability arising out of the
court fight resulting from the Texaco-Pennzoil battle.
   Shortly before the hearing began, Harvey Miller, the bankruptcy
lawyer representing Texaco, announced that attorneys for those
shareholders had dropped their opposition to the reorganization
plan.
   In a document filed Tuesday, the dissidents said they ended
their fight partly because of ``overwhelming evidence that a
settlement with Pennzoil is not possible without the releases.''
   Pennzoil attorney Kenneth Klee said Pennzoil had insisted the
liability provisions be included in the settlement agreement.
Pennzoil Chairman J. Hugh Liedtke testified his company wanted the
releases mainly to help end the litigation, settle its claim
against Texaco, and win more cooperation from Texaco's management.
   The dissident shareholders also noted Texaco had agreed not to
object if their attorneys applied for a maximum of $10 million in
fees, plus $150,000 in expenses. Miller told Schwartzberg the
company would assume half of those expenses, and that its insurance
would pay the bill.
   While some shareholders opposed to the liability releases,
others were unhappy with anti-takeover provisions of Texaco's
charter and bylaws that they argued entrenched management and
lessened its accountability for its actions.
   The leader of the latter group was Icahn, whose ownership of
14.8 percent of Texaco's common stock has helped fuel takeover
speculation in recent months. But despite his opposition to those
provisions, Icahn had indicated he would vote for the
reorganization plan.
   During the hearing, Texaco officials drew some pointed questions
after disclosing they had just closed on an agreement to borrow $3
billion from a syndicate of banks to help refinance their pending
reorganization.
   In repeated questioning of Texaco treasurer David Crickelair,
Icahn's attorney David Friedman and Dennis O'Dea, an attorney
representing Texaco's shareholders committee, implied Texaco helped
entrench its management by accepting a ``change in control''
proviso in the loan agreement.
   Under the provision, two-thirds of the banks could vote to call
the three-year loan if 30 percent of Texaco's stock wound up in one
group's hands, or if there was a change of more than half of the
members of the board.
   But Crickelair said the provision had been demanded by the banks
and was non-negotiable.

   That cow munching in a Normandy meadow may not be
all that she seems. Her father might be Bubba from Rising Sun, Md.,
and her grandfather the famed American bull Pawnee Farm Arlinda
Chief.
   Such international hybrids are the result of artificial
insemination and embryo transfer, two genetic breeding techniques
now gaining favor on European farms.
   Glossy pinups of champion bulls were a feature of the recently
ended annual Agriculture Show in Paris, catching the eye of French
farmers eager to improve the quality of their herds.
   ``Paris Special Offer _ Low-Cost Embryos'' read the sign on
another stand.
   The breeding methods offer Common Market farmers a way to
improve the quality of their production without adding to Europe's
burgeoning surplus of milk.
   Farmers who have slaughtered cows for meat to stay within milk
quotas imposed by the European Economic Community are hoping to
maintain production levels in the future with fewer animals.
   ``One high-quality cow is cheaper to feed than two which produce
the same quantity of milk,'' said a French technical adviser to
World Wide Sires, Inc. of Hanford, Calif.
   Artificial insemination involves taking semen from a bull and
injecting it into a cow. The technique differs from embryo transfer
in that no eggs are removed from a cow and fertilization takes
place in the womb. With embryo transfer, an egg is fertilized in a
test tube and later implanted in the womb.
   Exhibitors interviewed at the Agriculture Show said the United
States and Canada have the best genetic stock in dairy cattle, and
there is an active trans-Atlantic market in frozen sperm and
embryos.
   ``World Wide Sires has 10 million Holsteins at nine cooperatives
in the U.S.,'' said Ginny Barker, one of the company's regional
marketing directors. ``It's a huge genetic pool.''
   The black and white Holstein cow, which was shipped from Germany
to the United States between 1850 and 1900, is the most popular
milking cow worldwide.
   ``In France alone, it makes up 90 percent of the dairy herd,''
said Gerard Andre, director of a French cattle exporting company.
   ``And nearly all French dairy cows have American Holstein
blood,'' he said.
   It might seem ironic that European herds are being upgraded with
North American imports of a European breed.
   The World Wide Sires representative explained that American
breeders had aimed for specialized high-yielding dairy cows.
   ``But European farmers had stuck with dual-purpose beef and milk
producers, such as the Normandy cow,'' he said.
   Not everyone agrees that artificial insemination is the best
technique for getting the right kind of animals. The British
company Heine Brothers is promoting embryos.
   ``Our market is in commercial embryos for the everyday farmer,''
said Richard Price, Heine's livestock manager.
   ``At the moment farmers are using artificial insemination. We
say our embryos will take over,'' he said.
   When beef cattle are killed in the slaughterhouse, the ovaries
are taken from the carcasses and the eggs removed. They are
fertilized in vitro, then implanted in sheep's womb to mature for
six days before being taken out and frozen.
   These embryos, from beef strains such as the Limousin, are
implanted in the wombs of Holstein cows, in a simple operation.
   Mike Keeble, marketing manager of Heine said ``a farmer has the
best of both worlds with this technique, because in the same herd
he will have some good beef animals and his super-efficient
Holsteins for milking.''
   ``By introducing these embryos, we can change a whole herd,'' he
said.
   Heine is looking outside Europe for new markets and hopes its
embryos will be used to build up cattle herds in countries such as
Ethiopia and Saudi Arabia.
   ``Many people in African and Arab countries are unable to drink
milk after they are 5 years old,'' said Keeble. ``But their
stomachs can take yogurt and they want to eat more meat.''
   ``So we can build up dual-purpose herds, which provide milk for
yogurt and beef, reducing the need for goat or camel meat,'' he
said.

<BYLINE>Does Business Know What It's Talking About?
^By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After examining the literature of business,
including the expressions of folks who claim to be authorities on
the subject, an academic asks: Does business really know what it is
talking about?
   The horrifying thought occurred to Professor Eugene Jennings as
repeatedly he heard speakers define certain key words in one way
and their listeners another.
   In practice, he observes, dozens of important business words
have multiple definitions or definitions so fuzzy they can mean
anything to anyone.
   ``Tell me,'' he asks, ``what is meant by excellence?''
   The word, as most people know, has become worn with usage in
businesss, and now threatens to disappear from the lexicon without
ever being understood. But if ever there was a word of multiple
meanings, he suggests, it is this one.
   From his vantage point as a writer of books, teacher _ at
Michigan State University _ and adviser of top business executives,
Jennings has viewed an odd phenomenon: People don't like to ask the
meaning of these new words.
   To do so, many otherwise confident business folks believe, is to
reveal their incompetence or incredible stupidity. As a
consequence, much of the business lexicon today is incoherent
babble.
   Jennings observed this first-hand when he examined the use of
key words by institutional and private purveyors of professional
management courses and found them to mean whatever the instructors
wanted them to mean.
   The very meaning of ``manager'' is among the most vague.
Jennings found it is seldom defined but ``invariably confused with
administrator, supervisor, executive and leader, as well as with
role, position, title and function.''
   Important words, vital to communication, are thrown about
without any precise understanding of their meanings. ``By so-called
experts!'' Jennings exclaims.
   Strategy is confused with purpose, mission, process and
function. Planning is confused with purpose, role, technique and
process.
   Even ``business' itself is interchanged with definitions that
indicate a confusion with art, science, profession, social system,
institution _ almost anything but economic activity.
   Cash flow is interchanged with net profit, money in till, and
circulation of money. And, he remarks, attempts to define this and
other words sometimes add little to understanding but much to
confusion.
   What is it? ``The movement of cash into, through, and out of an
entity,'' says one lexicon. Anther: ``The amount of net cash
generated by an investment or a business during a specific period
of time.''
   Many of what Jennings calls ``high-profile'' words and phrases
began to be bandied about in the early 1960s and, though
ill-defined, have remained to protect fuzzy speakers and impress or
terrorize insecure audiences.
   Self-esteem, win-win, decision-making _ and, more recently _
back-to-basics and just-in-time, the latter a procedure for
inventory control.
   Oddly, says Jennings, some words remain in use because of their
mystery. ``Their power lies in remaining obtuse,'' he says.
   Entrepreneur, motivation, communication, MBO (management by
objective), SPC (statistical process control), style, intelligence.
Care to define them? Do it, he says, and then compare definitions
with the person next to you.
   The confusion impels Jennings to describe _ not define _
business ``as an activity conducted without a lexicon of basic
language directed by individuals for whom a dictionary is an
abstract work of art.''
   Ask top executives, as he has, if they regularly use a
dictionary and you are likely to search long for a positive answer.
Yet, he states, nowhere could a good dictionary be used to better
advantage than in the executive suite.
   Jennings' confrontation with the Babel of tongues became
especially frustrating when he found that writers of management
books and producers of management training programs were only
adding to the confusion.
   ``Much of business jargon today is mere vocal sound,'' he
concluded. ``It is the use of words with intensified resonance or
nasal dramatics pleasing or invigorating to the senses.''
   He laments that ``good old fashioned meanings classical to our
business traditions are being warped around words of convenience.''

<HEAD>Intel To Sell Micron Memory Chips, Gets Stock Warrant</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Intel Corp. said today it will sell computer
memory chips made by Micron Technology Inc. and has received a
warrant to buy stock in the Boise, Idaho-based chip maker.
   The deal with Intel, one of the nation's biggest independent
chip makers, should give Micron some long-term stability in the
volatile business.
   Micron is one of only two U.S. companies, along with Texas
Instruments Inc., that have withstood competition from Japan to
continue producing the common chips known as dynamic random access
memories, D-RAMs.
   The computer and electronics industry has been hampered in
recent months by a severe shortage of computer memory chips. The
Intel-Micron deal will initially apply only to 256K D-RAMs, the
generation of chips that is gradually being replaced by the more
powerful 1-megabit D-RAMs.
   Intel, which dropped out of the D-RAM business several years
ago, said it received a warrant from Micron to purchase 600,000
shares of Micron stock at an exercise price of $19.37{ a share.
That would represent less than 3 percent of Micron's stock.
   Micron's stock rose to $21.12{ a share in over-the-counter
trading by midday Wednesday from its close of $19.75 a share
Tuesday.
   Intel said it would sell Micron chips under the Intel label and
would use Micron chips in its own products, such as circuit boards.
   ``Micron's alliance with Intel allows us to broaden our customer
base, and strengthens our ability to expand and compete in the
worldwide D-RAM market,'' Joe Parkinson, Micron's chairman, said in
an announcement.
   Intel's vice chairman, Robert Noyce, said the deal would help
Intel as well as ``support a key U.S. supplier of D-RAMs.''

<HEAD>Wards to Add 225 Stores in Next 5 Years</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Retailing giant Montgomery Ward & Co. will
celebrate its soon-to-be-granted independence from parent Mobil
Corp., by opening 225 stores over the next five years.
   Ward Chairman Bernard F. Brennan said Tuesday the expansion will
cost the nation's ninth-largest retailer about $150 million a year.
   The new stores will be additions to existing markets and the
majority will be specialty shops featuring home, audio-video,
apparel or automotive products.
   Only 10 of the new shops will contain all four product specialty
shops under one roof. Slightly more than half of Wards' 316 stores
nationwide already have been converted to the specialty-store
format.
   An investor group headed by Brennan has agreed to acquire the
company from parent Mobil for $3.8 billion. The transaction is
expected to be completed in May.
   Wards said earlier this month the acquisition would not result
in the sale of any of its stores or a reduction in its
72,000-member work force.
   Brennan said the only unit Wards' acquirers planned to sell was
its credit card operation.

<HEAD>BAT Industries Posts 15.3 Percent Profit Drop</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   BAT Industries PLC, the British conglomerate whose
U.S. interests include the retailer Saks Fifth Avenue and Brown &
Williamson Tobacco Corp., said its fourth-quarter pretax earnings
fell 15.3 percent because of the weak dollar and the October stock
market crash.
   BAT, which recently made an unsolicited $4.5 billion offer for
Farmers Group Inc. of Los Angleles, said it had pretax earnings of
433 million pounds, or $792 million, down from 511 million pounds
in the same period a year earlier.
   The company did not provide any further quarterly figures. It is
not required to do so under British law.
   For the full year, pretax earnings edged up 0.07 percent to
1.394 billion pounds from 1.393 billion pounds in all of 1986.
   Net income totaled 751 million pounds, down 13.5 percent from
868 million pounds in 1986. BAT had 36 million pounds in
extraordinary charges in 1987, and extraordinary gains of 75
million pounds in 1986.
   Sales for the year fell 10 percent to 17.2 billion pounds from
19.2 billion pounds.
   The stock market crash reduced investment appreciation income
from the company's Eagle Star financial services subsidiary to 47
million pounds in 1987 from 149 million pounds in 1986.
   Saks Fifth Avenue and Marshall Field's, two of BAT's retailing
businesses in the United States, were affected by difficult trading
conditions, especially in the fourth quarter, the company said.
   In addition, BAT said its total 1987 pretax profit would have
been 192 million pounds higher if exchange rates had remained at
1986 levels.

<TEXT>
   In the stock market crash of 1987 few
institutions suffered more damage, both real and perceived, than
the National Association of Securities Dealers' over-the-counter
market.
   Through the long winter that followed, the NASD and its
president, Joseph Hardiman, have labored to repair the market's
image and recover the momentum it had been building since the early
1970s.
   By all accounts, that effort has produced some notable successes
to date.
   ``I feel that the NASD has done a real good job,'' said Binkley
Shorts, portfolio manager of the Over-The-Counter Securities Fund,
a mutual fund that concentrates in the market for unlisted stocks
that are traded through a network of dealers overseen by the NASD.
   ``It feels pretty comfortable right now'' investing in OTC
stocks, Shorts added.
   But few observers argue that the mission of restoring investors'
confidence in the over-the-counter market, or in stocks in general,
is anywhere near complete.
   ``We've taken some first steps, some important steps,'' Hardiman
said in an interview at his office here. ``There's more to be
done.''
   The crash hit at a time when the NASD, after a decade of
dramatic expansion and innovation, was bidding to challenge the New
York Stock Exchange for preeminence in the U.S. stock market.
   It claimed that its multiple-dealer system was superior to that
of the Big Board and other exchanges, where a single broker known
as a specialist operating on the trade floor acts as a meeting
point for buy and sell orders in a given stock.
   But in the worst days of the crunch, some beleaguered
over-the-counter dealers backed away from the NASD's automated
small-order execution system, known as SOES.
   Investors and brokers ran into busy signal after busy signal as
they tried to reach dealers who were either unable or unwilling to
handle the volume of telephone calls and orders.
   ``The market was put to a severe test, and it suffered a
hangover that lasted for at least a couple of weeks,'' recalled
Shorts.
   Within a month, the NASD came up with plans to strengthen SOES
and increase the responsibilities of dealers. Those measures have
been approved and are scheduled to be put into effect by late May
or early June, Hardiman said.
   For one thing, participation in SOES, formerly optional for
dealers, will now be mandatory. For another, any dealer who pulls
out of the market for a stock without a special exemption will be
barred from returning for 30 days.
   ``If we have a recurrence of the kind of thing that happened
last fall, market-makers must stay in,'' observed Ralph Costanza,
head of the over-the-counter trading department at the brokerage
firm of Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co.
   Meanwhile, as stocks in general have staged a rally since last
December, over-the-counter issues have enjoyed a particularly
vigorous rebound.
   From Jan. 1 through mid-March, the NASDAQ (the AQ stands for
automated quotations) composite index of OTC stocks rose 15.47
percent, outpacing a 10.43 percent rise in the NYSE's composite
index of all its listed common stocks.
   In the midst of the crash, said Shorts, ``there was an
opportunity for us to buy at ridiculously low prices.''
   Looking back, Hardiman says, ``we took a lot of criticism early
because the problem was access to our markets. But all markets had
their problems.''
   Looking ahead, he says further efforts will be made to
strengthen the system. A committee chaired by Irving Pollack, a
former member of the Securities and Exchange Commission, is due to
report in May on a study of the structure and quality of the OTC
market, and Hardiman expects it to make some significant
recommendations.
   The changes that are already being made, he says, have prepared
the NASDAQ system to function better if and when another financial
storm strikes: ``I think we can handle an event like that _ I don't
say without difficulty _ but with far fewer problems.''
   He acknowledges that the crash was a setback to the NASD's
ambitions for its market, but adds that it may well prove to have
beneficial side effects.
   ``We have experienced sensational growth, particularly over the
last 10 years,'' he said. ``October, not by choice, gave us an
opportunity to pause and reflect.
   ``We're going through a period of digestion _ some pundits may
say indigestion,'' he added. ``It's great to grow, but we also want
to have a quality marketplace.''
   After the current process of reevaluation and remodeling,
Hardiman said, ``I believe we're going to be poised for another
significant period of growth.''

   Stocks were mixed today in moderate trading,
which brokers attributed to an overwhelming lack of buying interest
and confusion about the market's overall direction.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which barely budged in
slack trading Tuesday, rose 1.82 points to 2,067.97 by 3 p.m. on
Wall Street.
   Among broader market indicators, the New York Stock Exchange
composite index of all listed issues rose 0.12 to 151.64. The
American Stock Exchange's market value index rose 0.63 to 299.43.
   Gaining and losing stocks were about even on the NYSE, with 719
up, 711 down and 504 unchanged. Volume totaled 137 million shares
with an hour of trading left.
   ``We're just standing here,'' said William King, head trader at
Nikko Securities Co. International in New York. ``You need money to
take stocks up, and the money's not there.''
   Some traders said the market's confusion reflected conflicting
economic news. Evidence of relatively tame inflation reported by
the government suggested interest rates will not rise significantly.
   At the same time, the government revised the fourth-quarter
gross national product growth rate upward to 4.8 percent,
suggesting that the economy is healthier than previously believed
and therefore implying higher inflation and rising interest rates.
   Blue-chip stocks were widely lower. IBM fell 1[ to 112, Procter
& Gamble fell 1 to 80|, McDonalds fell | to 44{, Sears fell { to
38\ and Boeing fell 1 to 47{.
   Texaco rose 1] to 46~. A federal judge approved the oil giant's
bankruptcy reorganization plan.
   As in recent sessions, takeover-related trading was the most
active area. Lucky Stores, target of a $45-a-share acquisition
offer from American Stores, rose 2\ to 49 after surging 14{ on
Tuesday when the offer was announced.
   Among other rumored and actual speculative takeover stocks,

<TEXT>
   The government delivered two welcome pieces of
economic news on Wednesday: Consumer prices rose just 0.2 percent
in February and the economy in late 1987 expanded at the liveliest
pace in nearly two years.
   Falling energy and food prices in February helped restrain the
rise in the Labor Department's Consumer Price Index after a 0.3
percent increase in January.
   For the first two months of the year, prices increased at an
annual rate of 3.2 percent _ much better than last year's moderate
4.4 percent inflation.
   In a separate report, the Commerce Department said the U.S.
economy grew at a brisk 4.8 percent annual pace in the final three
months of last year. It was the second upward revision in the
fourth-quarter GNP, estimated a month ago at 4.5 percent and in
January at 4.2 percent.
   The department said better-than-expected performance in exports,
consumer spending and business investment led to the latest
revision, which pushed growth for the year to a rate of 4 percent,
compared with 2.2 percent growth in 1986. It was the biggest annual
increase since a 5.1 percent rise in 1984.
   The 4.8 percent fourth-quarter growth followed a 4.3 percent
growth in the July-September quarter and was the fastest quarterly
growth rate since an increase of 5.4 percent in the first three
months of 1986.
   Recent economic reports have shown an economy that rebounded
quickly from last October's stock market collapse. Analysts see
little likelihood of an election-year recession.
   ``One of the best kept secrets in economic circles these days is
that the Reagan administration is going to end with a bang, not a
whimper, as the economy makes a successful transition to an
export-led economy,'' President Reagan said in a speech to the
American Business Conference.
   Meanwhile, his spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, hailed Wednesday's
reports: ``Inflation remains under control, the economy is doing
well, the Reagan miracle holds.''
   Food prices fell 0.3 percent in February, erasing a 0.3 percent
gain in January. Fruits and vegetables led the way with a 4 percent
tumble. Lettuce prices, which more than doubled at the end of 1987,
dropped 25.1 percent in February.
   Energy prices fell 0.6 percent, with falling gasoline prices
more than offsetting increases in household fuels.
   At-the-pump gasoline prices fell 1.7 percent in February, the
third consecutive decline. Gasoline prices have fallen 5.9 percent
in six months.
   Heating oil and other household fuels were up 0.6 percent;
natural gas and electricity prices rose 0.5 percent.
   ``There is at this point no indication of any major widespread
acceleration of inflation,'' said Lawrence Chimerine, chairman of
the Wefa Group, a Philadelphia-area economic forecasting service.
   Competition in retailing contributed to the favorable inflation
performance, Chimerine said. ``Stores have been holding down price
increases.''
   Items other than food and energy were up a modest 0.2 percent in
February.
   Still, there remained pockets of inflation, particularly in
service industries. Medical care services were up 0.7 percent in
February, while ``other services'' rose 0.6 percent.
   ``There are some chronic price problems in the economy,'' said
Sandra Shaber, senior economist for the Futures Group, a Washington
management consultanting firm. ``These increases in health care are
not going to go away.''
   ``But if we continue to get a break on food and energy prices,
that certainly is good news,'' she added.
   However, Allen Sinai, chief economist for the Boston Co., said
the ``big issue is whether these good results we are getting so far
this year are transitory or permanent. Food and energy price
declines are reversible almost any time.''
   In other February price movements:
   _New automobile prices rose 0.3 percent.
   _Clothing prices fell 0.3 percent.
   _Alcoholic beverage prices rose 0.9 percent.
   Last month's seasonally adjusted 0.2 percent gain in the CPI was
equivalent to a compounded annual inflation rate of 2.1 percent,
Labor Department analysts said.
   The February increase left the overall index at 116.0, meaning
that a hypothetical selection of goods costing $100 during a
1982-84 base period would have cost $116.00 last month.
   Unlike other figures in the report, the overall index is not
adjusted for seasonal fluctuations.
   The Labor Department recently changed its base period. Had the
former computation been used, the February consumer price index
would have been 347.4 compared with a 1967 base of 100.
   That means the same selection of goods would have cost $13.00
more last month than in February 1987, when the CPI was 334.4.
   In two other economic reports:
   _The Commerce Department said after-tax corporate profits shot
up 8.4 percent in 1987 to $137.4 billion after declining the year
before. Analysts credited the turnaround in profits to the weaker
dollar, which has boosted U.S. sales overseas, and to subdued labor
wage demands.
   _The Labor Department said Americans' average weekly earnings,
after discounting for inflation, edged up 0.2 percent in February.
It was the second monthly advance, matching an identical 0.2
percent January increase, but it still left Americans'
inflation-adjusted earnings 0.7 percent below where they were a
year ago.

   Stocks muddled through a third straight day of
sluggish trading Wednesday with no clear direction, and most of the
action was confined to another surge of takeover speculation.
   Some traders said the market's confusion reflected conflicting
signals about the economy. Others attributed the market's malaise
to resilient investor reluctance to aggressively buy stocks in the
aftermath of the October crash
   ``It's really not a newsworthy day,'' said William King, head

<TEXT>
   BankAmerica Corp., whose stock jumped 6 percent
in active trading Wednesday, denied rumors that it may be the
target of a takeover by a Japanese bank.
   BankAmerica stock closed up 62.5 cents at $11.125 a share in
heavy New York Stock Exchange trading.
   Dan Dorfman, appearing on CNN's ``Moneyline'' program Tuesday
night, said he had heard a rumor that a Japanese bank may be
interested in acquiring part of all of BankAmerica.
   BankAmerica said in a statement from its headquarters in San
Francisco that there was ``no basis for the rumors.''
   Dorfman said Wednesday from his office at USA Today, where he
works as a columnist, that he ``emphasized the word rumor'' and
mentioned the rumor to explain the heavy dealing in BankAmerica
stock on Tuesday.
   Analysts quickly disputed the claim.
   ``It's unlikely,'' said Mark Alpert, an analyst with Bear,
Stearns & Co. ``There have been plenty of opportunities in the past
for Japanese banks to take a position in BankAmerica, and nothing
has occurred.
   ``It doesn't mean it can't happen, but it's unlikely,'' he said.
   Likewise, Rodrigo Quintanilla of Argus Research Corp. said that
while only West German and Japanese institutions are in a financial
position to take on the huge banking company, ``I still don't
consider it to be a takeover target.''

<BYLINE>Texaco Reorganization Plan Confirmed
^By JOHN C. GIVEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Texaco Inc. on Wednesday won final
bankruptcy court approval for a plan that would settle its
multibillion-dollar dispute with Pennzoil Co. and bring it out of
Chapter 11 protection early next month.
   After a day and a half of closing arguments, U.S. Bankruptcy
Court Judge Howard Schwartzberg confirmed the reorganization plan,
which features an agreement by Texaco to pay Pennzoil Co. $3
billion to drop a $10.3 billion judgement held by Pennzoil against
the nation's third-largest oil company.
   When the plan goes into effect, on April 7, Texaco will deliver
the money to Pennzoil and will be officially free from the legal
constraints that have limited its operations since the company
filed for protection from its creditors last April 12.
   It was the largest corporate bankruptcy in U.S. history.
   Texaco said it was driven to take that action to avoid having to
pay a potentially ruinous $11 billion security bond while appealing
the judgment held by Pennzoil.
   A Houston jury awarded the judgment to Houston-based Pennzoil in
November 1985, after finding that Texaco had improperly interfered
with a Pennzoil acquisition of part of Getty oil company so Texaco
could buy Getty itself.
   Schwartzberg's approval marked the last step required for Texaco
to emerge from bankruptcy protection under federal law.
   Texaco officials and Pennzoil Chairman J. Hugh Liedtke expressed
profound relief that the four-year ordeal of litigation that had
paralyzed both companies was finally over.
   ``I must say it has not been a particularly pleasant experience
... But it had to be done,'' said J. Hugh Liedtke, Pennzoil's
chairman.
   Liedtke said he never doubted that the jury's verdict would be
vindicated, despite lingering criticism from some quarters.
   ``Quite frankly, all the smoke aside, people don't pay $3
billion for something who don't have some liability, '' he said.
   Told of that remark, Texaco Chairman Alfred C. DeCrane _ who at
Tuesday's hearing had stoutly defended Texaco's view that it had
done nothing wrong _ said: ``What we did here today is to settle
this matter.''
   Noting that Texaco's only other choice was a highly risky
all-or-nothing attempt to win a U.S. Supreme Court reversal, he
said the company settled ``to end that litigation.''
   In announcing his decision to confirm the plan, Schwartzberg
noted that 96 percent of Texaco's shares were voted in favor of the
package, which was laboriously worked out among Pennzoil, Texaco,
and committees representing Texaco's creditors and shareholders.
   He also noted that the plan provides for full payment to
Texaco's creditors, with interest, and had been supported by
representatives of all the principal parties during the final
confirmation hearings.
   The only lingering bone of contention was the presence of
provisions in the plan granting immunity to all parties involved in
the original Texaco-Getty-Pennzoil matter.
   On Tuesday, dissident shareholders reluctantly dropped 16 suits
against Texaco, saying they would support the plan, knowing that
the company would be in far worse condition if it were not approved.
   The dissidents contended _ along with Texaco's largest
shareholder, takeover artist Carl C. Icahn _ that the releases gave
away a chance for Texaco to recoup some of its losses by suing the
parties responsible for Texaco's ultimate defeat in Houston.
   Icahn, who owns 14.8 percent of Texaco's stock, also protested
that the measures served to entrench management and diminish its
accountability to shareholders.
   While he voted in favor of the plan, he urged the court to
strike the releases from the plan.
   Schwartzberg refused to do so, agreeing with arguments by both
Pennzoil and Texaco that the releases were, on balance ``in the
best interest of Texaco.''
   Noting that Pennzoil, not Texaco, had inserted the provisions,
Schwartzberg said it appeared inevitable that endless litigation
would continue without the releases, which all parties wanted to
avoid.
   He also suggested it was questionable that Texaco officials
could be found guilty of fiduciary irresponsibility for their roles
in the Getty affair.
   Liedtke said the judge's action would trigger plans, already set
up, to borrow a very substantial part of the $3 billion from a
consortium of banks, which it will begin investing in short-term
notes.
   When it receives the payment from Texaco, it will then repay the
banks, Liedtke said.
   Asked if Pennzoil would be interested in buying any Texaco
assets, Liedtke said it could not be done ``without their
permission,'' because of a mutual agreement forestalling such
action for five years.
   He said the company would be studying longer-range plans for the
money, adding that decisions could not be expected for at least
several weeks.
   With the case virtually closed, Liedtke said he planned to ``sit
and think a little bit,'' and that he hoped to retire from his
chief executive post when the company holds its annual meeting next
month.

<HEAD>EEC Presses U.S. In Petroleum Levy Dispute</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: Christophe in 2nd graf is cq.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The European Economic Community threatened trade
retaliation against the United States on Tuesday unless it brings a
tax on petroleum imports into line with an international agreement.
   Christophe Bail, an EEC delegate, told a council meeting of the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade that the 12-nation economic
bloc may seek trade restrictions that would offset the U.S. tax. He
did not identify which U.S. products might be targeted.
   U.S. delegate Michael Samuels dismissed the threat as premature,
said one source, who added that the EEC has provided no evidence
the current tax has harmed its trade.
   The Reagan Administration, in its 1989 budget proposal to
Congress, has sought a remedy with a uniform crude oil tax of 9.65
cents per barrel, Samuels told delegates.
   The 96-nation GATT told the United States to change the tax last
June on grounds that it violated international trade rules by
discriminating against imports. The ruling followed complaints by
Mexico, Canada and the EEC.
   Under the 1986 levy, U.S. domestic crude oil is taxed at 8.2
cents a barrel while imports are taxed at 11.7 cents. The proceeds
finance the Superfund hazardous waste cleanup program.
   GATT rules provide for retaliation if a member fails to act on a
ruling.

   The dollar finished lower Wednesday in dull
domestic dealings, failing to react to the government's latest
economic data.
   Gold prices rose. Republic National Bank of New York quoted a
bid price for gold of $451.15 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EST, up
from Tuesday's late bid of $448.65.
   Traders said there was little activity throughout the session,
and the dollar moved in a very narrow range.
   The currency had little reaction to a Labor Department report
showing a 0.2 percent rise in consumer prices during February. ``As
long as inflation is not a problem,'' the dollar is undaunted by
the figures, said Curtis Perkins, a foreign exchange dealer with
Chemical New York Capital Markets Group.
   The market showed no interest in a revision of the gross
national product for the fourth quarter. The Commerce Department
said the economy expanded at a 4.8 percent annual rate, up from the
4.5 percent growth figure it reported a month ago.
   Traders said investors are in a holding pattern until the end of
the Japanese fiscal year on March 31.
   ``There are rumors that the Japanese are trying to keep the yen
weak until the end of the year,'' said David Godwin, chief foreign
exchange manager at Union Bank of Switzerland.
   Godwin noted that investors ``are looking at the European
economies against the Asian economies'' when making foreign
exchange trades and are less interested in the dollar at the moment.
   Similarly in European trading, the dollar stumbled in the
sidelines as the British pound dominated foreign exchange trading.
Sterling rose above 3.11 marks several times during the trading
session, but fears of intervention took it back down each time.
   In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 127.15 yen, up 0.08 yen from
Tuesday's close. But later, in London, it was quoted at a lower
rate of 126.83 yen. In New York, the dollar closed at 126.85 yen,
down from 127.025 yen on Tuesday.
   In London, the pound rose against the dollar to $1.8358, from
Tuesday's $1.8300. In New York it cost $1.83725 to buy one pound,
more expensive than Tuesday's $1.8330.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Tuesday,
included: 1.6916 West German marks, down from 1.69175; 1.3985 Swiss
francs, down from 1.39895; 5.7470 French francs, down from 5.7500;
1,251.875 Italian lire, down from 1,252.825, and 1.2430 Canadian
dollars, down from 1.24575.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Tuesday,
included: 1.6915 West German marks, down from 1.6935; 1.3990 Swiss
francs, down from 1.4015; 5.7450 French francs, down from 5.7540;
1.9005 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9015; 1,253.25 Italian lire,
unchanged, and 1.2434 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2468.
   Gold prices moved higher. On the New York Commodity Exchange,
gold for current delivery closed at $451.10 a troy ounce, up from
$448.70 on Tuesday.
   In London, gold rose to a late bid of $453 a troy ounce,
compared with late Tuesday's $448.75. In Zurich, gold closed at a
bid $450.50, compared with $448.50 late Tuesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose 19 cents an ounce to close at
$452.06 bid.
   Silver on New York's Comex finished at $6.610 a troy ounce, up
from Tuesday's $6.465. In London, the metal was trading at a late
bid price of $6.630 a troy ounce, compared with late Tuesday's
$6.46.

   In a case with implications for all North
American automakers, a Canadian trade panel Wednesday ruled that
low-price imports from Hyundai Motor Co. of South Korea had not
injured domestic manufacturers.
   The tribunal found no evidence of material injury to the
Canadian subsidiaries of Ford Motor Co. and and General Motors
Corp., which had accused Hyundai of dumping its hatchbacks and
small sedans at below-cost prices to gain a foothold in the North
American market.
   Revenue Canada, a department of the federal government,
initially agreed with Ford and GM and imposed preliminary duties of
26 percent on Hyundai imports.
   But the key to the case was not whether Hyundai was selling cars
in Canada at prices below those on the South Korean domestic
market. Ford and GM also had to prove they suffered ``material
injury'' and failed to do so, according to the three-member
Canadian Import Tribunal.
   The government panel found no evidence of damage and ordered the
preliminary duties imposed last November refunded. It was the first
case involving autos ever handled by the trade tribunal, officials
said.
   ``All proceedings against Hyundai Motor Co. with regard to
dumping will be terminated,'' tribunal secretary Art Trudeau said
in Ottawa, where the decision was announced.
   Hyundai spokesman Greg Young said the refund amounted to
``millions and millions'' of dollars posted in bonds.
   ``The feeling here today is like a cloud has been removed from
over our head,'' said Young.
   George Peapples, president and general manager of General Motors
of Canada, expressed disbelief at the finding.
   ``It has been and it remains our contention that continued
unrestrained dumping by Hyundai will result in lost jobs and
investment in the Canadian automotive industry,'' Peapples said in
a statement.
   ``Given the deputy minister of revenue's findings of dumping
margins in excess of 26 percent, it's difficult to comprehend that
the tribunal did not find any injury whatsoever.''
   GM spokesman Nick Hall said he could not comment on whether a
judicial appeal will be made until the tribunal explains the
reasons for its verdict next month. ``There's been a lot of time
and effort spent on it already,'' Hall said.
   Ford of Canada spokesman Jim Hartford said the ruling points to
flaws in Canadian trade law and dangers lurking in the
comprehensive Canada-U.S. free trade agreement scheduled for
ratification this year.
   He said Ford was unable to prove substantial injury from Hyundai
imports because Canadian law looked solely at Ford production and
sales in Canada, where small-car production has been phased out,
instead of examining Ford's integrated North American operations.
   ``The tribunal was severely handicapped by the narrow scope of
trade law coverage in Canada,'' Hartford said. ``We're alarmed by
the implications today's decision has for other industries which
may become rationalized under the free-trade agreement.''
   The Canadian auto industry, responsible for 140,000 direct jobs,
is integrally linked with U.S. operations under a duty-free 1965
Auto Pact between the two countries treating the continent as a
single market.
   The Canadian government made a crucial intervention on Hyundai's
behalf in the anti-dumping hearing that ended March 10. The Bureau
of Competition Policy said Hyundai had fostered competition in the
small-car market and kept car prices down.
   Hyundai came to Canada in 1984 and within a year had a 21
percent share of the subcompact market with sales of 79,072 Ponies
and Stellars. The cheapest of its hatchbacks sold for $6,000
Canadian, or $4,500 in American dollars.
   Hyundai then entered the U.S. market where it grabbed a 2.6
percent share last year with sales of 264,000 Excels.
   When Ford and GM accused Hyundai of dumping and the government
initially concurred, Hyundai's sales plummeted and some dealers
resigned. The company expects to sell about 45,000 cars in Canada
this year, third behind Honda and Toyota in the small-car market.
   Auto industry analysts said victory for Ford and GM would have
opened a pandora's box in which U.S. carmakers might have launched
similar attacks on Japanese importers, as well as Hyundai
operations south of the border.
   ``I can only assume other importers will evaluate the case today
very closely and apply it to their operations,'' said Young.

<HEAD>High Court Upholds Limits on Food Stamps for Striking Workers</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: SUBS 10th graf pvs, bgng: There was, with three new grafs of
UAW comment</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court, in a decision three
justices called anti-union, said Wednesday the government may limit
a family's eligibility for food stamps when a family member is on
strike.
   The court said a 1981 federal law imposing such limits does not
violate any constitutional rights. The 5-3 decision reversed a
federal judge's 1986 ruling that had struck down the law.
   Justice Byron R. White wrote for the court that the law
represents a rational effort by Congress to remain neutral in labor
disputes. But the court's three dissenters, led by Justice Thurgood
Marshall, said the law ``amounts to a penalty on strikers, not
neutrality.''
   The 1981 law, amending the Food Stamp Act, generally bars a
family from becoming eligible for food stamps at a time when one of
its members is on strike. Families already receiving food stamps
when a member goes on strike are not dropped from the program but
are barred from receiving additional food stamps despite the loss
of income.
   The law was challenged by the United Auto Workers, the United
Mine Workers and some of their members. They said the law violated
strikers' freedom of association and speech, and denied equal
protection to strikers' families.
   But White said, ``Exercising the right to strike inevitably
risks economic hardship, but we are not inclined to hold that the
right to association requires the government to minimize that
result by qualifying the strikers for food stamps.''
   He added, ``Union strike funds should be responsible for
providing support and benefits to strikers during labor-management
disputes. It was no part of the purposes of the Food Stamp Act to
establish a program that would serve as a weapon in labor
disputes.''
   But Marshall contended that the 1981 law amounted to such a
``weapon'' for managment.
   ``No other purpose can adequately explain the especially harsh
treatment reserved for strikers and their families by the 1981
enactment,'' Marshall said.
   UAW President Owen Bieber called the decision ``a blow to
working families throughout America.''
   ``In a democracy which affords its citizens the legal right to
form trade unions and engage in peaceful strikes, it is
hypocritical and inconsistent to punish the family members of those
who choose to exercise that right,'' Bieber said.
   He said his union would urge Congress to do away with the 1981
amendment.
   The Food Stamp Act generally excludes benefits for people, and
the households of people, unwilling to work. But Marshall noted
that people who can prove they quit their jobs for ``good cause''
may collect food stamps if otherwise eligible _ while strikers may
not.
   White was joined in upholding the law by Chief Justice William
H. Rehnquist and Justices John Paul Stevens, Sandra Day O'Connor
and Antonin Scalia.
   Justices William J. Brennan and Harry A. Blackmun joined
Marshall's dissenting opinion.
   Justice Anthony M. Kennedy did not participate in the decision.
   The nation's food stamp program, paid for by the federal
government and administered by the states, has supplemented the
food-buying power of millions of low-income families since 1964.
   Participating households receive food stamp coupons that can be
used for food purchases at retail stores. Eligibility for food
stamps is based on income and several other factors.
   Households encompassing 21 million people received food stamps
in 1984, and the federal government spent $10 billion on the food
stamp program that year.
   In another decision Wednesday, the court ruled in an Illinois
case that short-term notes used to finance public housing projects
are not exempt from federal estate taxes. The 8-0 ruling is a
victory for the Reagan administration, which said more than $260
million in federal tax revenue was at stake.

<HEAD>OPEC News Sends Petroleum Futures Prices Soaring</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES LITKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Petroleum futures prices soared Wednesday and brought precious
metals along for the ride after OPEC finally committed to a date
for next month's much-anticipated meeting of its price committee.
   The runup in oil prices also helped trim losses in stock-index
futures, which moved steadily lower early Wednesday because of the
release of a barrage of anti-inflationary news from the federal
government.
   On other markets, livestock and pork futures were mixed, wheat
futures were mostly higher and soybean and corn futures were lower.
   The advances in oil came on a third day of frenzied activity at
the New York Mercantile Exchange. Crude lost 9 cents in the spot
month Monday and 40 cents Tuesday as traders awaited word from OPEC
President Rilwanu Lukman on when the pricing committee would meet.
   Oil opened under pressure again Wednesday, but rose when Lukman
finally announced the regularly scheduled meeting would take place
in April. It surged 58 cents during one early afternoon stretch to
the day's high of $16.96 a barrel after Saudi Arabia endorsed the
OPEC gathering.
   ``When anyone else says that, the market takes it with a grain
of salt,'' said Bob Murphy, analyst with E.F. Hutton & Co., New
York. ``But when the Saudis do it, especially since they've been
making noises recently about discounting their own product, the
impact was almost immediate.
   ``You could almost feel the psychology changing,'' he added.
   West Texas Intermediate crude settled 38 cents to 49 cents
higher, with the May contract for delivery at $16.86 a barrel;
heating oil was 1.32 cents to 1.54 cents higher, with April at
47.73 cents a gallon; and unleaded gasoline was .93 cent to 1.30
cents higher, with April at 47.25 cents a gallon.
   The precious metals opened higher Wednesday, but floundered
after the government released a pair of new economic reports _ a
modest 0.2 percent rise in consumer prices last month; a revised
4.8 percent economic growth rate in the last quarter of last year.
   ``Once inflation concerns stabilized, everything stagnated,''
said Bette Raptopolous, analyst with Purdential Bache Securities
Inc. in New York. ``But Lukman's announcement touched off a rally.
The perception is higher oil prices means inflation, and that
confirmed other indicators people have been seeing.''
   Gold settled $2.40 to $3.30 higher on the New York Commodity
Exchange, with March at $451.10 a troy ounce; silver climbed 14.5
cents to 15.6 cents, with March at $6.61 a troy ounce. Platinum
advanced for the third straight day, settling $3.10 to $3.40
higher, with March at $513.50 a troy ounce.
   Stock-index futures settled .25 point lower on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange, where the contract for June delivery of the
Standard & Poors 500 index settled at 270.40. The underlying spot
index climbed .07 point, closing at 268.91.
   ``We broke down to Tuesday's lows early in the day, but the fact
that we didn't break them might have been one signal of strength,''
said John Mitchell, a broker with Elders Futures Inc., Chicago.
   ``Then, the oil news touched off a rally in interest-rate
futures and we moved up alongside,'' he added.
   Wheat futures prices climbed on the Chicago Board of Trade on
news the Soviet Union would take delivery of 500,000 metric tons of
wheat under the government's export bonus program, as well as an
offer extended to Poland under the same program.
   But the bullish news was tempered when C&D Commodities, the
major player in the grains pits the two previous days, sold off its
wheat supplies.
   ``There is a feeling their big buys in recent days to cover
short positions is over,'' said one analyst.
   C&D's selloff in the bean pit added pressure to a market that
was already losing steam on expectations of decreased exports. With
rival producer Brazil in mid-harvest, traders feared some of the
U.S. bean business will be taken away.
   Wheat settled wheat \ cent lower to 1 cent higher, with the
contract for May delivery at $3.07\ a bushel; corn was unchanged to
\ cent to 1{ cents lower, with May at $2.06\ a bushel; oats were {
cent to 2\ cents lower, with May at $1.67} a bushel; and soybeans
were 3\ cents to 5 cents lower, with May at $6.39} a bushel.
   The underlying cash prices were the driving forces in livestock
and pork futures trading at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle opened .32 cent lower to .10 cent higher, with April
at 74.35 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .18 cent to .10 cent
higher, with March at 82.45 cents a pound; live hogs were .67 cent
lower to .35 cent higher, with April at 45.90 cents a pound; and
frozen pork bellies were unchanged to .43 cent lower, with March at
55.10 cents a pound.

   Stocks gained Wednesday in the busiest trading
of the week, but brokers said much of the action stemmed from
speculation about corporate mergers and that the broader market
remained lethargic.
   ``Today was mostly a takeover day,'' said Hildegarde Zagorski,
market analyst at Prudential Bache Securities Inc. ``It seemed
every stock on the board had a story attached to it.''
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which traded in a tight
range all day, closed 1.49 points higher to 2,067.64.
   Wider measurements of stocks also rose, and the American Stock
Exchange market value index reached its highest level since the
October market crash, up 1.61 to 300.41.
   Gaining stocks outnumbered declines by a 3-to-2 margin in
composite New York Stock Exchange trading, with 917 up, 611 down
and 457 unchanged. Big Board volume totaled 167.37 million shares,
relatively busy compared with the 142 million shares traded Tuesday
and the year-low 128.83 million traded Monday.
   Nevertheless, traders said disinterest in stocks pervaded the
market, a pattern that has persisted in the aftermath of the
October crash. The apathy has been compounded recently by confusion
over the direction of the economy.
   As in previous sessions, investors focused on the bond market
for clues about inflation and the direction of interest rates, the
key to where they should put their money.
   Despite a government report showing that inflation remains
relatively tame, bonds fell Wednesday and interest rates rose,
partly because of rebounding oil prices and other evidence of
economic strength. The net effect was to keep many investors out of
stocks.
   ``We're just standing here,'' said William King, head trader at
Nikko Securities Co. International in New York. ``You need money to
take stocks up, and the money's not there.''
   Whatever money there was went largely into stocks targeted in
rumored and factual acquisitions.
   Textron jumped 5 to 29\ in heavy trading attributed to
speculation the company might receive an unsolicited offer. Other
speculative stocks included Gillette, up 3{ to 42{, and Lucky
Stores, up 2 to 48}.
   Resorts International fell 3~ to 28 after the company rejected a
sweetened takeover offer from entertainer Merv Griffin, who has
been battling for control of the casino company with developer
Donald Trump.
   Computer stocks fell, partly reflecting a belief that the
industry as a whole will not do as well as earlier predicted. Lotus
Development fell 3{ to 25\ in heavy volume after the company
announced delays in the introduction of new software and analysts
downgraded their earnings projections.
   Other losers included IBM, down 1{ to 111|; Digital, down 1 to
111]; Texas Instruments, down 1[ to 50]; and Compaq, down 2[ to 51{.
   Texaco rose 1} to 47\ after a federal bankruptcy judge approved
the oil giant's reorganization plan. There also was speculation
that investor Carl Icahn might make a bid for the company.
   Merck jumped 4{ to 165 on a reported buy recommendation for the
drug company from Wall Street brokerage Eberstadt Fleming.
   Nationwide turnover in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 196.97 million shares.
   The Wilshire Associates 5,000 Equity Index, which measures the
value of all U.S. stocks, rose $5.51 billion or 0.21 percent to
$2.669 trillion.
   The NYSE composite index of all listed issues rose 0.30 to
151.82.
   Standard & Poor's index of 400 industrials rose 0.01 to 312.03,
and S&P's 500-stock composite index rose 0.07 to 268.91.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market rose
0.33 to 380.09.

   Northwest Airlines' new smoking ban hits the
air-travel market at a time when anti-puffing campaigns are gaining
momentum, but it may revive a debate that snuffed out a pioneer of
smoke-free flying.
   Muse Air Corp. of Dallas tried and failed to establish itself as
the nation's only no-smoking airline in 1985.
   The effort _ which offered passengers discounted tickets if they
turned in their cigarettes at the gate _ was scrapped when the
airline was purchased later that year by Southwest Airlines Co. for
$65 million.
   While the regional carrier had begun to draw its identity from
its no-smoking policy, its research showed the practice was chasing
away as many as 35 percent of potential passengers.
   Surveys revealed that fliers find ``price, convenience and
service more important than non-smoking'' in choosing an airline,
Muse spokeswoman Shari Cohen said at the time.
   She said Muse may have been a bit ahead of its time by banning
smoking and that the pioneer role may have hurt.
   Even now, in the wake of the federal government's move to ban
smoking on all air flights lasting less than two hours, some
militant smokers are holding fast.
   The Great American Smoker's Club of Dallas is scheduled to make
its grand entrance on April 22, a day before the government's ban
goes into effect. The group, founded by two businessmen, aims to
evade the ban by charging a membership fee.
   For $25 a year or $40 for a family, smokers can join the club
and pay the same fares Southwest charges to fly from Dallas' Love
Field to Austin, Houston, New Orleans, Oklahoma City, San Antonio
and Tulsa.
   The club is leasing several planes from Las Vegas-based Royal
West Airlines, said club president Glenn Herndon, who estimated the
startup cost at $2 million.
   ``We want to offer cigarette smokers a choice to continue their
right to smoke,'' he said. ``To fly on a plane nowadays, smokers
are treated like second-class citizens and must sit on the back
rows. When the smoking ban begins, we want to offer smokers an
alternative _ and, hopefully, make some money.''
   Herndon said the club's target is to serve 63 cities from five
hubs with 60 planes within two years.
   By the way, non-smokers will be allowed on board, but they will
have to be ``tolerant,'' the club says.

   American men place a premium on marriage and
families and say the father's role in raising children is as
important as that played by the mother, a survey said Wednesday.
   ``While modern courtship and romance may seem confusing to many
American men, family remains their anchor in life,'' the survey
commissioned by Gentlemen's Quarterly magazine said.
   The survey said 73 percent of those responding to a
questionnaire indicated they felt strongly that their family is the
most important facet of their lives.
   It said 54 percent felt strongly that a man's most satisfying
accomplishment is to be a father, while 84 percent felt strongly
that a father's role is as important as the mother's in raising
children.
   The survey said that 60 percent rated their marriage as more
important than their job, friends or other family ties and that
only 10 percent agreed strongly with the assertion that marriage
``makes you lose your personal identity.''
   ``This is hardly a confirmation that the '80s man is afraid of
commitment as is so often thought,'' the survey said.
   The survey was conducted by the independent research firm,
Significance Inc. of Ridgewood, N.J., which said it received 1,062
responses to questionnaires that were mailed in mid-November to
about 2,600 men aged 18 years and older. The men were asked to rank
their reactions to various assertions on a scale of 0 to 10.
   The firm said that the replies generally indicated that
marketers should pay more attention to attitudes rather than age,
income or occupation in fashioning marketing strategies.
   The researchers said 52 percent of those surveyed can be
categorized as ``change-adapters'' _ those who generally share a
positive self-image and thrive in an atmosphere of change.
   The remaining 48 percent, the firm said, can be called
``change-opposers'' _those who in varying degrees are experiencing
some degree of alienation from society and ``are having trouble
coping.''
   Marketers trying to reach these groups may do well to
``understand their frame of mind and view it that way rather than
their time of life,'' said Jack Kliger, publisher of GQ.
   Among some other findings of the survey:
   _While only 25 percent of those surveyed said they strongly
support the women's movement, 79 percent expressed strong support
for the statement, ``It's only fair that women should get equal pay
for comparable work.''
   _Fifteen percent said they strongly agreed with the statement,
``It's just unrealistic to expect a married man never to have an
extramartial affair.''
   _Twenty-six percent said they felt strongly that their career
was the proudest accomplishment of their lives, and 40 percent said
they strongly felt it is an important expression of who they are.
But only 15 percent agreed strongly that their career ``means as
much to me as my family or friends do.''
   _One-third of those surveyed said they spend 30 minutes or less
a day on grooming, another third spends between 30 minutes and 45
minutes and the remaining third spends more than 45 minutes a day
on grooming.
   _Forty-eight percent said they strongly felt women ``go for the
good-looking men first'' before considering brains or personality.
Forty-six percent take women's suggestions on appearance seriously,
but only 25 percent say they strongly like getting such advice.

<TEXT>
   Domestic car sales fell slightly in mid-March
despite a selling surge at Chrysler Corp., automakers reported
Wednesday.
   Analysts said an earlier flurry of higher-than-expected sales
due to incentives and a stock-crash rebound appeared to be tapering
off.
   The eight companies that make autos in the United States sold
189,245 cars in the eight sales days from March 11-20, down from
217,939 in nine sales days in the comparable 1987 period. The daily
sales rate was down 2.3 percent.
   Sales of domestically made light trucks totaled 109,509, down
from 115,684 in the year ago period but still a 6.5 percent
increase in daily sales.
   Combined domestic car and light truck sales totaled 298,754,
down from 333,623 for mid-March 1987 but up 0.7 percent on a daily
basis.
   Sales of foreign-made cars are reported at the end of the month.
   Domestic sales were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.4
million for the mid-March period.
   That would indicate a decline from the industry's 7.1 million in
domestic sales in 1987. For the prior 30 days, however, sales ran
at an 8.1 million seasonally adjusted annual rate.
   ``It looks like sales are beginning to drop back down to a more
expected level,'' said Chris Cedergren, auto analyst at J.D. Power
& Associates in Westlake Village, Calif.
   Jeannette Garretty, an analyst at the Bank of America in San
Francisco, said sales surged prior to the mid-March period as
consumers reacted to incentives and made purchases put off due to
caution after the October stock market crash. ``Now it is going to
start to settle down,'' she said.
   Industry leader General Motors Corp. sold 92,173 domestically
made cars in the March 11-20 period, down from 105,438 in the
comparable 1987 period. The daily sales rate was off 1.7 percent.
   Ford Motor Co. auto sales of 54,186 were down from 67,672 in the
year-earlier period, and down 9.9 percent on a daily basis.
   Chrysler car sales jumped to 30,801 from 31,699 in the same
period in 1987, up 9.3 percent on a daily sales basis, aided by
strong sales of Chrysler New Yorker and Landau luxury models, the
company said.
   Chrysler's domestic light truck sales jumped even more, totaling
24,691, up from 20,987 in the year-earlier period and up 32.4
percent in daily sales.
   It was the eighth straight period of rising car sales at
Chrysler, said Tom Pappert, group vice president for sales. ``We
are clearly going into the spring selling season with momentum on
our side.''
   GM also was a gainer in truck sales with an eight-day total of
45,376, up from 43,515. The daily sales rate was up 17.3 percent.
   Ford light truck sales sagged to 36,812, from 49,164 in the
year-earlier period. The daily sales rate fell 15.8 percent.
   Market shares of the Big Three automakers changed only slightly
from the year-earlier period, with GM capturing 48.7 percent,
compared with 48.4 percent; Ford accounting for 28.6 percent, down
from 31.1 percent, and Chrysler moving up to 16.3 percent from 14.5
percent in the year-earlier period.
   Aggressive incentives paid off for some Japanese companies
manufacturing cars in the United States. Honda's sales of 7,270
represented a 9.8 percent increase in its daily sales rate.
   Volkswagen of America sold 1,034 U.S.-made cars, down 12.5
percent from 1,330 a year earlier.
   The Big Three U.S. automakers accounted for 93.6 percent of U.S.
sales of U.S.-made cars.
   ``We continue to be pleased with the strength of the market,''
said C.N. Moore, vice president in charge of customer sales and
service at GM.

   Grolier Inc. said Wednesday its board
had rejected as inadequate a $415 million takeover bid from French
publisher Hachette SA, and said it has talked with others who may
be interested in making a rival proposal.
   On the New York Stock Exchange, Grolier's stock rose 12{ cents a
share to close at $26.50, a price that was well above the
$21-a-share bid from Hachette.
   ``The rejection of a $21 bid when the stock was at $26 was no
great shock,'' said Jane Gilday, managing director of McKinley
Allsopp Inc. in New York. ``Grolier made it clear there are other
bidders and they're committed to maximizing shareholder value.''
   Grolier said its board of directors was unanimous in rejecting
as inadequate the unsolicited takeover offer from Hachette.
   ``In this regard, representatives of Grolier have had
preliminary contact with several parties who have indicated an
interest in making a proposal to acquire the company,'' Robert B.
Clarke, chairman and chief executive, said in a statement. Clarke
did not name the companies.
   Grolier said that if it is unable to negotiate an acquisition of
the company on satisfactory terms, it will look at other
alternatives such as a leveraged buyout or a financial
restructuring.
   ``I think the next move is that Grolier will now entertain these
other bids,'' Gilday said. ``And, Hachette could raise its bid.''
   Hannah Bruce, vice president of Tucker Anthony & R.L. Day in New
York, said, ``The way the stock market has reacted throughout this
whole two weeks, it appears the market feels Grolier will be worth
more.''
   Danbury-based Grolier is a publisher of encyclopedias, reference
and educational books and children's books, and owns a film
processing firm. It earned $22.1 million on sales of $424.2 million
in 1987. The company has 7,300 employees in 20 countries.
   Hachette, France's biggest publisher, said last week that it was
offering $21 a share in cash for the 95 percent of Grolier's
roughly 19.5 million shares that it did not already own.
   Bruce said Grolier has a strong management team and credited the
company's turnaround in the last decade to Clarke.
   ``The company was near bankruptcy in the late 1970s, Clarke came
in as chairman and he rebuilt it. He divested all non-publishing
activity and structured the enclopedia group,'' Bruce said. ``The
company is very strong. ... Earnings are growing 30 percent-plus a
year.''
   She said the company has some ``very attractive pieces,''
including its adult and childrens' book clubs.
   ``They basically sell their products to parents with young
children,'' she said. ``They have a strong customer base.''

<DATELINE>KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Kansas City Southern Industries Inc.
said Wednesday that a proposed buyout effort by a New York
developer may be designed to stimulate trading in the company's
stock and to draw attention to the developer's previously-disclosed
plan to win two board seats.
   The railroad, data processing and financial services company
noted that Howard Kaskel, the New York developer, had simply
proposed talks toward a possible negotiated merger in his letter to
the company this week.
   It said the letter did not contain an offer to shareholders, and
does not state that financing for any transaction has been obtained.
   In the letter, Kaskel proposed buying the 89 percent of the
company's 11.1 million shares that his group doesn't already
control for $60 a share in cash. Such a transaction would be worth
about $590 million.
   ``The letter appears to be an effort to stimulate trading in the
Kansas City Southern Industries' stock and perhaps to publicize
Kaskel's previously announced plan to nominate two persons for
election to the Kansas City Southern Industries' board of
directors,'' the company's statement said.
   A call was placed after business hours to Kaskel's lawyer for
comment, but the lawyer could not be reached.
   Wall Street has indicated skepticism about whether an offer will
be forthcoming. In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Kansas
City Southern fell $2 a share to $54.50 on Wednesday.
   ``If Mr. Kaskel, as a large shareholder, wishes to nominate an
individual ... we would certainly be pleased to consider such a
person,'' Kansas City Southern President Landon H. Rowland was
quoted as saying in his company's statement.
   The statement said the ``on-again, off-again efforts of the
Kaskel group to thwart Kansas City Southern Industries' proposed
acquisition of the Southern Pacific ... are viewed by management as
inconsistent with the best interests of the company and its
stockholders.''
   Rowland said earlier in the week that the KCSI board would
consider the Kaskel proposal at a special meeting, but declined to
say when the meeting would be held.

   Del E. Webb Corp. announced Wednesday its
board of directors approved a restructuring plan that includes
selling off its casinos and other leisure operations and focusing
instead on real estate.
   ``In recent years, Webb's most profitable operations on a
continuing basis have been real-estate oriented and particularly
our adult community developments,'' said Philip J. Dion, the
corporation's chairman. ``This, our greatest past and present
strength, is where we will concentrate our efforts.''
   ``Present shareholder value will be maximized by the sale of our
leisure facilities and use of the proceeds to strengthen the
company's balance sheet and provide the capital necessary to
continue expansion of our real estate business,'' Dion said.
   The leisure operations the Phoenix-based company owns and
manages had revenue of $171 million in 1987, $127 million from the
three Nevada casino hotels and $44 million from recreational
properties, Dion said.
   Gaming includes three casino hotels in Nevada which Del Webb
will reacquire complete control of next month _ the Mint in Las
Vegas, the High Sierra at Lake Tahoe and the Nevada Club in
Laughlin.
   Dion said the three casinos were sold to two limited
partnerships run by Webb executives in 1984.
   He said the reacquisition will allow for the orderly disposition
of the properties by simplifying the ownership structure.
   The company also is negotiating with the limited partnership
that owns the Claridge Hotel and Casino in Atlantic City, N.J., to
terminate Webb's contract to manage the hotel.
   Recreational properties the company owns and operates include
five marinas on Lake Powell in Arizona and Utah, and Wilderness
River Adventures, a river-rafting company on the Colorado River.
   When the restructuring is complete, Dion said the company will
consist of Del E. Webb Communities Inc. and Del E. Webb Commercial
Properties Corp. The communities concern is the developer of Sun
City West Vistro in Arizona and Sun City Summerlin, an adult
community in Las Vegas.
