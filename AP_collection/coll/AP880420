   A Navajo tribal judge Wednesday began,
then recessed, a hearing on temporary custody of an Indian infant
caught in a tug of war between the tribe and a non-Indian couple
who want to adopt her.
   It was not immediately known why Judge Manuel Watchman of Navajo
Tribal Children's Court recessed until Friday the two-hour closed
hearing over 9-month-old Allyssa Keetso.
   However, Robert Walters, a lawyer appointed by the tribe as an
advocate for the child, came out an hour into the hearing and said
he had been disqualified and was under a gag order. ``The baby has
no representation,'' he said.
   Walters said he was ordered off the case after seeking dismissal
of the tribal action that had brought the custody issue before the
Childrens' Court.
   Allyssa was born to an Indian who wants the child to be adopted
by Rick and Cheryl Pitts of San Jose, Calif., but the tribe
asserted its rights under federal law to decide adoptions of Indian
children, and a California judge last week ordered the baby turned
over to the tribe pending a final custody decision.
   Meanwhile, the child has been in the Pittses' care at the
reservation since Sunday. The couple was ordered to remain there
until Friday's hearing.
   Anslem Roanhorse, a Navajo official with the tribe's Division of
Social Welfare, said, however, that the agency retained legal
custody of Allyssa.
   Watchman was expected during Wednesday's hearing to begin
deciding whether the baby should be adopted by the Pittses, with
whom she has lived since birth, or live on the reservation, perhaps
with her mother's parents.
   The hearing, which was closed because it is a juvenile
proceeding, was expected to address temporary custody, with a
hearing to be held later on a permanent arrangement.
   Patricia Keetso, 21, was unmarried, pregnant and unable to
support the child when the Pittses contacted her through a
newspaper advertisement. She said she gave them Allyssa to afford
the child a better life.
   The Pittses, both 33, were in the process of adopting Allyssa,
with Ms. Keetso's approval, when the Navajo Tribal Courts
intervened.
   Barry A. Goodfield, a psychologist advising the Pittses, accused
tribal officials of being more worried about paperwork than the
well-being of the child.
   ``There's a power game being played in there, and a baby is
being used as a football,'' Goodfield said.
   Sam Pitts, Rick Pitts' father, said before the hearing, ``We're
just hoping and praying that this hearing today will give us
temporary custody while we continue to fight for adoption in tribal
courts.''
   He held the baby before the hearing and said, ``She's just
frightened and just not her happy, jolly self.''
   In a similar case last year, a tribal judge in Window Rock
awarded temporary custody of a 10-year-old Navajo boy to a
non-Indian couple who sought to adopt him, pending a custody trial.
   Federal law gives tribal courts jurisdiction to decide adoptions
of Indian children in certain instances. Navajo law places strong
emphasis on extended family.

<TEXT>
   A former policeman convicted of nine murders begged
a jury over the vehement objections of his attorney to recommend
the death penalty Wednesday, and the jury complied.
   ``I am a soldier, I accomplished my mission and I humbly ask you
to give me the glory of ending my life and not send me to spend the
rest of my days in state prison,'' Manuel Pardo, 31, told the Dade
Circuit Court jury.
   ``I'm begging you to allow me to have a glorious end,'' he said.
   Pardo, a state highway patrolman and later a patrolman in the
small Dade County town of Sweetwater until 1985, was convicted
Friday of shooting to death three women and six men over several
months in 1986.
   The jury recommended execution rather than life in prison. Pardo
will be sentenced later by Judge Phillip Knight, who is not bound
by the recommendation.
   He had testified during the trial that he killed the nine
because he wanted to rid the world of drug dealers. Prosecutors
claimed he was a drug dealer himself and killed some of his victims
during drug ripoffs.
   Pardo's plea Wednesday came over the objections of attorney
Ronald Guralnick, who put Pardo on the stand to question him about
his military record in an effort to persuade the jury to recommend
a life sentence.
   In asking to address the jury, Pardo told the judge he didn't
want the panel to be ``biased'' by statements made by his parents,
who had asked the jury to spare his life and described him as a
good son.
   Guralnick had argued at trial that Pardo was insane at the time
of the slayings, but Pardo himself denied it.

<HEAD>Pear-Shaped Diamond Sold for a Record $9.13 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The biggest and most valuable diamond ever to go
on the block was sold Tuesday to an anonymous bidder for a
world-record $9.13 million.
   The buyer bid by telephone for the 85.91-carat pear-shaped
diamond, said Diana Levitt, director of corporate affairs for
Sotheby's. The sale was part of a jewelry auction that brought in a
total of $36 million.
   ``The sale was a great success, achieving a record for a jewelry
sale in America as well as establishing a record for any piece of
jewelry sold at auction,'' said John D. Block, director of
Sotheby's jewelry division.
   Bidding for the diamond took two minutes and opened at $6
million. The gem itself went for $8.3 million; the remainder of the
price is the buyer's premium.
   The diamond has been graded D color, meaning it is of the
highest possible rating, perfectly cut and flawless.
   Neil Letson, gemologist and jewelry historian, said the diamond
has been described by a leading connoisseur of gems as a ``drop of
frozen light.''
   ``It represents the very essence of this planet in its simplest
and purest form,'' he said.
   The old record was set in 1980 by Sotheby's in Geneva, where
$6.6 million was bid for a pair of ear pendants with four
pear-shaped diamonds totaling 131.86 carats.

<HEAD>Pianist-Singer Michael Feinstein Opens on Broadway</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: No PMs Planned</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MARY CAMPBELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pianist-singer Michael Feinstein says that he
considers theater songs chums. Theater songs are lucky to have such
a chum and champaion.
   Feinstein, who has become the darling of the supperclub set in
just two years, added to his laurels on Tuesday by becoming the
cabaret toast of Broadway. He did it by singing mainly theater
songs, accompanying himself on piano, in a straightforward, smooth,
engaging style, neither belting, coy, jazzy, mannered nor gimmicky.
   Feinstein opened for a limited engagement, through May 15, at
Broadway's Lyceum Theater.
   Six musicians on a platform behind him during his nearly
two-and-a-half hour show enable Feinstein occasionally to leave his
piano bench and sing with a hand mike, straddling a chair, on a
high stool or even atop his piano.
   His voice is on the light side, with a soft throb, which makes
his most effective vehicle the romantic ballad. Without phrasing to
call attention to his articulation, he manages to enunciate so well
that nearly every word is understood, even in unfamiliar or fast
songs.
   At first, his presentation seems not far removed from bland. But
as the evening progresses, the 30-year-old performer turns an
almost skeptical listener into an enthusiast with his easy command
of the stage, warmth and projection of sincere appreciation of the
songs he plays and sings.
   By the time he'd been singing only a few minutes, he took the
audience into his mood while singing ``Be Careful, It's My Heart''
and ``You Keep Coming Back Like a Song.'' He threw in a few
novelties like ``Lydia the Tattooed Lady'' and very uptempo numbers
like ``Looping the Loop,'' which was cut from the musical
``Chicago.''
   He worked cataloging music for Ira Gershwin for six years, until
Gershwin died in 1983, so his warmth singing the Gershwin brothers'
last co-written song, ``Our Love Is Here To Stay,'' and their
lovely, never published ``Will You Remember Me?'' isn't surprising.
   He also did a lengthy medley of songs by composer Harry Warren,
whom he also knew. Some of Warren's songs with lyricist Al Dubin
have been heard on Broadway since 1980 in ``42nd Street.''
   Feinstein dug in vocally for a big finish with Irving Berlin's
``I Love a Piano,'' all the more effective because he hadn't been
overly emphatic before.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis, proclaiming ``I love New
York,'' moved into the front-runner's position in the Democratic
presidential race on the strength of a resounding New York primary
win on Tuesday.
   ``In Iowa we won the bronze. In New Hampshire we won the gold.
Tonight, we won the Oscar,'' Dukakis told several hundred
supporters who jammed the ballroom of the Omni Park Central Hotel
to toast his win here.
   He contratulated both rivals, Albert Gore Jr. and Jesse Jackson,
praising them as ``outstanding candidates'' who ``both have great
futures as leaders of our party.''
   Hours earlier, Dukakis spoke to 1,500 Democrats in Philadelphia,
where the campaign now moves for Pennsylvania's primary next
Tuesday, and placed an emphasis on the Republican opposition _ all
the while contending he was not assuming he is the certain
Democratic nominee.
   Dukakis immediately was bombarded with questions from network
anchormen about whether his support was too soft or his campaign
too dull to win in Novemer.
   ``I'm somebody I think grows on people as they get to know me,''
Dukakis said on NBC. ``We're building, we're getting stronger every
week.''
   And on ABC, Dukakis said, ``You don't get re-elected governor of
Massachusetts with 70 percent of the vote because you're dull. I
may not dazzle people off of platforms but we've got a terrific
campaign here.''
   Dukakis also said that with Gore apparently out of the race, the
negative campaigning would end. He said he and Jackson are ``very
strong positive people. We have a message of hope and optimism.
Neither of us believes cutting up the other guy is a way to win
elections or the presidency.''
   The Massachusetts governor tried to look ahead to the fall
campaign.
   ``This fall George Bush is going to be judged by a Republican
legacy of more red ink than all of the administrations from George
Washington to Jimmy Carter combined, by pink slips for our workers,
golden parachuetes for high rollers and greenmail for sharp
operators on Wall Street,'' he said.
   ``If I'm the nominee, my friends, the American people will be
able to choose between a Republican legacy of eight years of record
deficits and my record of nine consecutive balanced budgets,'' he
said.
   Paul Brountas, his national campaign chairman, told reporters
traveling with Dukakis back to New York that, if he is the nominee,
Dukakis intends to continue in office as governor. He said Dukakis
would not relax his campaigning, figuring he has won the nomination.
   ``He won't let up. This campaign won't let up,'' Brountas said.
``He is cautious when it comes to campaigning. He won't count it
won till the votes are all counted.''

   The Japanese Red Army, dormant for years after a
decade as one of the world's most feared terrorist groups, is back
in the news because of charges that its members bombed a USO club
last week in Naples, Italy.
   The car bombing, which killed an American and four Italians, was
one of several recent reports of activity by the group, whose
operations in the 1970s included the Lod Airport massacre in Israel.
   A Japanese man arrested April 12 on the New Jersey Turnpike with
pipe bombs in his car is suspected of being a Red Army member, the
Foreign Ministry says.
   Last November, a Red Army fugitive was arrested after arriving
in Japan with a ticket for Seoul, South Korea, site of the 1988
Summer Olympics.
   Japanese experts and Italian police believe the Red Army's
current leader is Fusako Shigenobu, 42-year-old daughter of a Tokyo
insurance salesman, who once worked as a bar hostess in Tokyo to
raise money for the terrorists.
   She dropped out of college in the 1960s and later married as
part of a plan to slip out of Japan, allegedly for a mission that
led to the Lod massacre in May 1972. Two of the three attackers,
including her husband, were among the 28 people killed.
   Police in Japan said she sent letters from Algeria before the
Lod attack, telling friends: ``I have become a member of a new
guerrilla organization and we are preparing a historic fight at the
end of May.''
   After the slaughter, police said, she wrote in a letter: ``The
heroic actions of the three Japanese revolutionary fighters are
highly valued.''
   Her father, Sueo Shigenobu, was quoted in a 1972 newspaper
interview as saying he and his daughter had argued heatedly about
politics.
   ``She would not change her stand on the Sekigun (Red Army)
principle of staging simultaneous uprisings all over the world,''
he said.
   Ms. Shigenobu and others led an extremist splinter group away
from the now-defunct General Federation of Japanese Students, or
Zengakuren, in 1968.
   The goal of what they originally called the United Red Army was
``a simultaneous world revolution to destroy capitalism and
imperialism.''
   Masayuki Takagi, a commentator on Japanese police and security
matters, said Ms. Shigenobu probably brought in more funds as a bar
hostess than were contributed by any of the Red Army's other 300
members.
   Official crackdowns on the group increased in 1970 after nine
Red Army men, some armed with samurai swords, hijacked a domestic
Japan Air Lines flight to Pyongyang, capital of communist North
Korea. Eight of the hijackers still live in North Korea and the
ninth is said to have died there last year.
   In February 1971, Ms. Shigenobu married Tsuyoshi Okudaira, a
25-year-old leftist student who, unlike his bride, was not wanted
by police. Soon after their marriage, they got through airport
security and flew to Beirut.
   Takagi said Ms. Shigenobu organized the ``Mideast Arab
Detachment'' of the Red Army that year. The organization has nearly
disappeared in Japan since, and is based in the Middle East with
close ties to Arab terrorists.
   Ms. Shigenobu is said to be a close friend of Leila Khaled, an
Arab woman involved in a several airplane hijackings in the 1970s.
   The Red Army, believed to number 30 to 40 people, is intensely
loyal to imprisoned comrades. In the 1970s it hijacked several
airliners and bargained successfully to free Red Army members.
   Kozo Okamoto, the survivor of the Lod attack, was sentenced to
life in prison and Ms. Shigenobu spoke several times of her hopes
to get him released.
   ``My thoughts have always been on freeing comrade Okamoto,'' the
Tokyo daily Asahi quoted her as saying in a clandestine 1981
interview. She added, however, that the Red Army lacked ``the
material or manpower to carry out the operation immediately.''
   In 1985, Israel freed Okamoto and 1,100 other prisoners in an
exchange for Israeli soldiers held prisoner by Arabs. Since then,
he and Ms. Shigenobu have been photographed together in Lebanon.
   In a letter released by Japanese police in 1984, she said she
and Red Army comrades were ``all back in the front line of the
Bekaa Valley'' of Lebanon, a Syrian-occupied area long used for
training Arab and other guerrillas.
   She said the Red Army had not abandoned violence as a means of
``fighting imperialism.''
   Junzo Okudaira, the younger brother of her late husband, has
become one of the world's most wanted men for attacks dating back
to 1974, the year he slipped out of Japan on a false passport,
according to Akio Ohno, another commentator on police matters.
   He was one of two Red Army members indicted for attacks on the
U.S. and British embassies in Rome in June 1987. After last
Thursday's bombing, Italian police said he parked the
explosives-laden car outside the USO club.
   They said a witness reported seeing Okudaira with Fusako
Shigenobu nine hours before the explosion.

<TEXT>
   Iran may have challenged the U.S. Navy in
air and sea battles in the Persian Gulf because it was caught off
balance by an Iraqi offensive in the Faw Peninsula and needed to
claim it was under attack by America _ ``the Great Satan.''
   The Iraqi ground attack aimed at regaining the Faw Peninsula at
the gulf's northern end coincided with the heaviest fighting
between the United States and Iran in the gulf.
   During Monday's series of clashes in the southern part of the
gulf, Iran broadcast a claim that U.S. helicopters were helping
Iraqi troops. The Pentagon dened any U.S. involvement in the ground
fighting.
   The United States attacked two Iranian oil platforms to
retaliate for damage caused to a U.S. frigate by an Iranian mine.
Iranian ships then took on superior U.S. forces in a series of
engagements over several hours.
   The Americans disabled two Iranian frigates and sunk or damaged
four gunboats. One American helicopter was missing and Iran said it
shot the aircraft down. Iran also claimed it sank a U.S. ship.
   During the fighting, U.S. Navy officers in the gulf also
reported Iran launched at least five Chinese-made Silkworm
missiles. The Pentagon said it could not confirm what kind of
missiles were fired and Adm. William Crowe, chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, said there was no evidence Iran had fired
Silkworms.
   Whether they were Silkworms or not, it was the first time Iran
had launched missiles at U.S. warships since the Navy increased its
presence in the Persian Gulf in July. The use of missiles and the
actions of Iranian patrol boats showed that Tehran was prepared to
seriously tangle with the Americans despite the U.S. Navy's
superior firepower.
   Western analysts believe the Iranians, apparently being pushed
off the Faw Peninsula by Iraq, needed to claim that they were under
attack by the United States as well as by the Iraqis.
   ``Unless the Iranians can pull a rabbit out of the hat, they
would seem to be in trouble,'' said Hans-Heino Kopietz, a Middle
East military analyst with the London-based International Institute
for Strategic Affairs.
   ``The developments of the last couple of days have thrown the
whole gulf war wide open.'' he said in an interview. ``It looks
like the Iranians have been dislodged by the Iraqis.''
   The Iraqi offensive in Faw, captured by Iranian Revolutionary
Guards in February 1986, was a major surprise.
   The Iraqis' strategy has been one of static defense since 1982,
when they were driven out of Iran after invading in September 1980.
If Iraq has recaptured the peninsula, it will be a rare victory for
Baghdad and a psychological setback for Tehran.
   In those circumstances, Iran chose to take on the Americans.
   Since July, despite the occasional clash and bellicose rhetoric,
the Iranians have gone out of their way to avoid a serious
engagement with the U.S. fleet, with its missile destroyers and
aircraft carriers that outgun anything the Iranians have.
   The United States keeps between 25 and 30 ships in the gulf
region, including destroyers, cruisers, frigates and mine sweepers.
Jet aircraft from the carrier Enterprise also attacked Iranian
ships in Monday's fighting.
   Iran can muster four small frigates, two of which were hit
Monday. In addition, Iran has some vessels used as gunboats, some
patrol boats and is believed to have at least 50 speedboats,
40-foot Swedish-built Boghammers.
   Paul Beaver, naval editor of Jane's Defence Weekly, said the
speedboats are basically recreational craft with large engines that
Iranian Revolutionary Guards have used to attack tankers with
rocket-propelled grenades. Beaver said they also may be equipped
with machineguns or mortars.
   According to Jane's, Iran has eight F-14 Tomcat fighters, 20 F-4
Phantom figher-bombers and as many as 40 F-5 Tigers, all U.S. built.
   Iran also has Silkworm missiles as well as the mines that have
damaged merchant shipping and last week blew a hole in the U.S.
frigate Samuel B. Roberts, injuring 10 crewmen.
   The Iraqis, who have long sought to internationalize the gulf
conflict to pressure Iran to negotiate, apparently launched the Faw
offensive in response to Iranian thrusts in the northern part of
the battlefront.
   The Iranians overran a large chunk of northeast Iraq last month.
   The 1986 seizure of Faw has long stuck in the Iraqis' throat.
But, despite repeated counterattacks, they had been unable to oust
the Iranians.
   The Iranians, have not admitted they have lost the Faw Peninsula
but their allegations that the Americans helped the Iraqis
indicates they have at least lost ground in Faw.

<HEAD>Peter Ustinov Plays Beethoven's Ghost</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in Wednesday AMs report.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JUERGEN METKEMEYER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Actor Peter Ustinov, whose roles have ranged from
Babar the Elephant to Rome's mad emperor Nero, is now playing
Beethoven's ghost before packed houses in West Berlin.
   The play, ``Beethoven's Tenth,'' was written by Ustinov and has
been performed in the United States and in Britain. However, its
West Berlin debut at the Schiller Theater marks the first time
Ustinov has delivered his lines in German.
   Ustinov, who turned 67 on April 16, admits that speaking German
is his biggest challenge in the performance.
   ``For me, every night at the Schiller is a premiere,'' he said
in a recent interview. ``German is a difficult language. It forces
me to attempt linguistic acrobatics with my mouth that I'm not used
too; I'm constantly in danger of getting stuck.''
   For the interview, Ustinov made his remarks in nearly fluent but
cautiously enunciated German.
   The play opened in West Berlin in January and has been sold out
ever since. More than 40,000 people are expected to see the
production before its scheduled April 30 closing, Gisela Huwe, a
theater spokeswoman, said.
   ```Beethoven's Tenth' is one of the greatest successes in the
40-year history of the Schiller,'' Huwe said of the two-act play
written by Ustinov.
   Much of the play's action concentrates on efforts by a fictional
London music critic named Stephen Winter to imagine how Beethoven's
10th Symphony might have sounded. It also focuses on his often
stormy relations with his son, Pascal, who composes modern
symphonies which Winter has no use for.
   A Viennese au-pair girl named Irmgard, who loves Beethoven and
Pascal, manages to wake the composer from the dead. The composer
rings the doorbell and strides, with long hair flowing, across the
stage.
   With the help of a hearing aid provided by the family doctor,
the old deaf master is able to hear his symphonies for the first
time.
   Ludwig van Beethoven's last completed symphony is his ninth _
The Choral. Music researchers, however, say they have discovered
sketches for an unfinished symphony, possibly a 10th, dated after
completion of his Ninth Symphony and before his death in 1827.
   In Ustinov's play, the audience never learns how the 10th
Symphony really sounded, but the resurrected genius helps bring the
feuding Winter family closer together.
   Critics say Ustinov's often deliberate German delivery adds to
the performance, increasing audience empathy to the character of
Beethoven, who makes a grumpy visit to the 20th century in a
rumpled coat and wig after 160 years in the grave.
   Ustinov said he especially enjoys playing on the West Berlin
stage.
   ``The actor is in direct contact with the audience here,'' he
said. ``The people are very warmhearted.''
   Ustinov is internationally known for his versatility as a stage
and screen actor, and in recent years has become best known for his
portrayal of Agatha Christie's Belgian sleuth Hercule Poirot.
   He has written several other plays, a collection of short
stories and a novel.
   In film, he gained prominence for his portrayal of Nero in
Mervyn Le Roy's 1951 Hollywood epic, ``Quo Vadis.'' He is also
known as the voice of Babar the Elephant, a popular children's book
character created by the late French author Jean De Brunhoff.

   NBC, which won the ratings for the third
straight season by a bigger margin than ever, is looking to next
season, when a writers' strike could keep its rivals in reruns
while it covers the Olympics.
   NBC topped off the season by winning the final week, even though
the 60th Annual Academy Awards on ABC was the week's No. 1 show,
according to A.C. Nielsen Co. figures Tuesday.
   For the week, NBC had an average rating of 13.9, ABC 13.5 and
CBS 11.8. The rating is a percentage of the nation's 88.6 million
homes with television.
   If the 6-week-old writers' strike isn't settled soon, network
executives warn, there won't be scripts for most of the new
season's shows; and, once it is settled, quality might suffer in
the rush to get shows ready.
   Th strike apparently poses the least problem for NBC, which
successfully bid a $300 million base price to cover the
traditionally high-rated summer Olympics, a sum that may turn out
to be a better investment that NBC ever imagined.
   Gerald Jaffe, NBC's vice president for research projects, said
Tuesday that advertising interest in the Olympics is picking up
already.
   The long-term effects of a late season could hurt the three
networks. Their combined share of the viewing audience is down.
Only the extent is at issue because of controversy over the new
ratings system.
   Nielsen ratings for the 1987-88 season showed the three-network
average down 9 percent from last year. Jaffe disputed that figure,
saying he compared more extensive local-market surveys and found a
network decline of 3 percent.
   He attributed the discrepancy to inaccuracies in Nielsen's new
people-meter audience measurement system.
   Last week, CBS released preliminary figures from a competing
ratings company, AGB, that showed CBS slightly ahead of ABC instead
of last. But AGB data didn't dispute the three-network drop.
   CBS has estimated that the lower people-meter figures will cost
the networks a combined $50 million in advertising revenues.
   The networks have hired a consulting firm to study the new
ratings system, said Bill Rubens, NBC vice president for research.
The results are expected this summer.
   The networks annually promote the new fall season to bring
viewers back, but if they have to extend summer reruns, more
viewers will presumably seek alternatives, and that could change
viewing habits permanently.
   NBC's season average, prime-time rating was 16.0. ABC, which had
been third in the ratings for three years running, eked out second
with a 13.7, thanks to the World Series, Super Bowl and Winter
Olympics. CBS was third for the first time ever, with 13.5.
   NBC had never won a season before 1985-86.
   ``The Cosby Show'' was the No. 1-rated show for the
third-straight year, followed by its spinoff, ``A Different
World,'' NBC's ``Cheers'' and ``Golden Girls,'' ABC's ``Growing
Pains,'' ``Who's the Boss?'' NBC's ``Night Court,'' CBS' ``60
Minutes'' and ``Murder, She Wrote,'' and ABC's new show, ``The
Wonder Years.''
   Of the two new shows that made the top 10, both were
significantly helped by their popular lead-ins, ``A Different
World'' by ``Cosby'' and ``Wonder Years'' by ``Who's the Boss?''
   The only other new shows to make even the top 30 were NBC's ``My
Two Dads'' at 21st, ``In the Heat of the Night,'' at 19th, and
``Aaron's Way'' at 30th. The latter two premiered late in the
season.
   Despite the lackluster performance by the new shows, Jaffe
predicted a third will be renewed, following the pattern of
previous years.
   The networks have parted company with big-event, multi-part
miniseries. Of the 12 miniseries last year, all but two were
two-parters. The top-rated ``Elvis and Me'' on ABC had rating of
24.5.
   ``The Ann Jillian Story'' on NBC was the top-rated TV movie with
23.8.
   News ratings are measured quarterly, not by season, but
beginning with the traditional television season in September when
Nielsen converted to the people meters, ``NBC Nightly News''
dropped into a third-place slump. Last week, the ``CBS Evening
News'' was No. 1 with a 10.1 and 21 share, narrowly edging ABC's
``World News Tonight'' with 9.9 and 20. ``NBC Nightly News'' had an
8.7 and 18.
   The share is a percentage of sets in use.

   Michael Jackson made his first record with his
brothers, Marlon, Tito, Jackie and Jermaine, in 1969. They were a
promising group of adolescent boppers known as the Jackson 5.
   Their music has spanned two decades and produced million dollar
hits.
   Jackson's career shot to hyperspace in 1979 with his solo LP,
``Off the Wall,'' a record many critics acknowledge to be the best
artistic work he's ever produced.
   However, it was the landmark ``Thriller'' LP in 1982 that
lionized Jackson and earned him a record eight Grammys. With more
than 40 million copies sold worldwide, it became the most
successful album of all time.
   His latest work, ``Bad,'' although a major hit, has failed to
reach the success levels of ``Thriller,'' winning no Grammys this
year. As of April 16, the album was No. 3 with a bullet _ which
means it's climbing _ in Cashbox.

   A West German financier accused of
defrauding Volkswagen out of an estimated $285 million is eligible
for extradition, a U.S. magistrate has ruled.
   The extradition of Joachim Schmidt, 38, was upheld Tuesday
following an hour-long hearing before U.S. Magistrate Ronald Rose,
who dismissed technical objections filed by Schmidt's American
attorneys.
   Rose said he would sign an order Monday to certify Schmidt's
transfer to Germany.
   Schmidt apparently fled to the United States after Volkswagen
discovered he had engineered a massive fraud through currency
futures purchased by the West German automaker, prosecutors said.
   The FBI arrested the financier in November 1987, when he was
living in a Hollywood apartment under an assumed name, authorities
said.

   It wasn't screaming fans or the intrusive media
that were the greatest threat to Michael Jackson. It was something
more insidious, more heinous, more vicious.
   Zits.
   ``I became subconsciously scarred by this experience with my
skin,'' he writes in his new autobiography ``Moonwalk,'' which
Doubleday is publishing this week.
   ``I got very shy and became embarrassed to meet people because
my complexion was so bad. It really seemed that the more I looked
in a mirror, the worse the pimples got. My appearance began to
depress me. ... The effect on me was so bad that it messed up my
whole personality.''
   The 29-year-old rock megastar was about 14 when the vicissitudes
of adolescence assaulted him. He had been vigorously performing
with his older brothers _ Marlon, Tito, Jackie and Jermaine as the
Jackson 5 _ since he was 5.
   ``In those days, the biggest struggle was right there in my
mirror. To a great degree, my identity as a person was tied to my
identity as a celebrity.''
   In more recent years, what the reclusive performer has seen in
the mirror bears little resemblance to the brown-skinned kid with
the wide nose and airy afro.
   In his autobiography, Jackson admits to having two nose jobs and
a chin cleft made. However, he said he has not had his cheeks or
eyes altered or a skin peel or dermabrasion to lighten his
complexion.
   ``All of these charges are ridiculous,'' he writes. ``I don't
care what anyone else says _ it's my face and I know it.
   ``What does my face have to do with my music or my dancing?''
   Jackson wrote his book with an assist from Doubleday editor
Shaye Areheart.
   ``He was wonderful, very enthusiastic,'' she said in an
interview. ``He's just a lot of fun to be around. He loves life and
is very enthusiastic about projects he gets involved with. He
doesn't do anything he doesn't feel good about. He's a very hard
worker.''
   Michael Jackson is the seventh of nine children born to Joseph
and Katherine Jackson in Gary, Ind. He began performing as lead
singer with the Jackson 5, which released 26 albums for Motown and
Epic.
   Their father, a steel-mill worker who played with a rhythm and
blues band, was extremely strict with the young performers.
   ``I wasn't forced into this business,'' Jackson writes. ``I did
it because I enjoyed it and because it was as natural to me as
drawing a breath and exhaling it. I did it because I was compelled
to do it, not by parents or family, but by my own inner life in the
world of music.''
   He hated the CBS-TV variety series the Jacksons had in 1976-77
because they had to dress ``in ridiculous outfits and perform
stupid comedy routines to canned laughter. It was all so fake.''
   He didn't want to do the 1984 ``Victory'' tour with his brothers
at a time when his solo career was soaring.
   He was reluctant to do the ``Motown 25'' TV special because of
his negative feelings about television, but reconsidered once he
was allowed to perform ``Billie Jean'' _ a non-Motown hit.
   ``When I feel that something is not right, I have to speak up,''
Jackson says. ``I know most people don't think of me as tough or
strong-willed, but that's just because they don't know me.''
   The late Fred Astaire, to whom ``Moonwalk'' is dedicated,''
called Jackson after the show and said:
   ```You're a hell of a mover. Man, you really put them on their
asses last night.
   ``You're an angry dancer. I'm the same way. I used to do the
same thing with my cane.'
   ``It was the greatest compliment I had ever received in my life,
and the only one I had ever wanted to believe,'' Jackson said.
   Making his critically acclaimed and highly successful 1979 solo
LP, ``Off the Wall,'' was one of the most difficult periods of his
life, Jackson said.
   ``I had very few close friends at the time and felt very
isolated. I was so lonely that I used to walk through my
neighborhood hoping I'd run into somebody I could talk to and
perhaps become friends with. ... I wanted to run into somebody who
would be my friend because they liked me and needed a friend too,
not because I was who I am.''
   He's says he's learned to cope with depression and loneliness
since then, but nevertheless still craves privacy and so shutters
his eyes with dark glasses _ ``It may be considered strange, I
know, but I like my privacy.''

   Segregation at the Seminole County Jail has
been ended by its new administrator, who says racial tensions don't
justify separating blacks and whites.
   ``This is 1988,'' said Duane Rutledge, who on Monday put even
numbers of white and black inmates in the previously segregated
cellblocks. ``If they can't live together ... then they will live
in isolation.''
   Two years ago, Capt. Jay Leman, whom Rutledge succeeded in
February, created two all-black cellblocks and one all-white one in
the maximum-security area, citing racial tension. The state
Department of Corrections condoned the move.
   Guards had complained about the policy, saying white guards
feared entering the all-black cellblocks and black guards feared
the all-white cellblock.

   A task force recommendation that Supreme Court
nominees no longer testify openly at confirmation hearings is
drawing fire even from conservatives who complained about the
handling of Robert H. Bork's unsuccessful nomination.
   ``It's a nice idea in theory, but practically it won't work,''
Sen. Orrin G. Hatch, R-Utah, said Tuesday after The Task Force on
Judicial Selection issued a report recommending that Supreme Court
nominees no longer testify in public before the Senate Judiciary
Committee.
   The privately financed committee of lawyers, headed by former
Gov. Hugh Carey of New York, concluded that ``the confirmation
process has become dangerously close to looking like the electoral
process.''
   But Hatch, a member of the Judiciary Committee, said any nominee
who refused to testify would almost certainly be rejected by the
committee and by the full Senate, because the testimony has become
``a matter of custom and practice.''
   Still, he added, ``There should not be a political process like
in the Bork case.''
   The report said Senate review of Supreme Court nominees ``has
become very much a national referendum on the appointment, with
media campaigns, polling techniques and political rhetoric that
distract attention from, and sometimes completely distort, the
legal qualifications of the nominee.''
   Television also came in for criticism in the study, which said
TV coverage of the hearings ``invited abuse of the confirmation
process.''
   The report said ``the White House, the Department of Justice,
senators, witnesses, and even nominees now seem tempted to use
televised hearings as a forum for other purposes, ranging from
self-promotion to mobilizing special interest groups in order to
influence public opinion.''
   The fight over Bork's nomination was waged not only in the
hearing room, but in newspaper ads, television commercials and news
conferences.
   The nominee received an unfavorable recommendation from the
Judiciary Committee and was defeated by the Senate last October,
58-42.
   Critics attacked Bork's narrow reading of constitutional
protections, calling him anti-civil rights, anti-consumer, and
against equal rights for women.
   Supporters accused opponents of distorting his record, and
painted the nominee as a compassionate man who believed that
judicial rulings should track the intent of the Constitution's
framers.
   Sen. Charles E. Grassley, R-Iowa, said the public relations
blitz that Bork endured should not be repeated, but the added that
the report's suggestion of ending a nominee's testimony ``wouldn't
fly.''
   ``We ought to have public dialogue,'' he said.
   Sen. Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, a Republican who voted
against Bork, called the report ``an over-reaction to the Bork
proceedings.''
   ``Any Supreme Court nominee who refused to appear before the
Judiciary Committee would not be cleared by the committee,'' he
said.
   The panel did not rule out informal interviews with nominees so
that senators could assess their judicial temperament and legal
qualifications.
   But Specter said this would ``shut out the public, which has a
right to know how the process is working, and whether the public
interest is protected.'' Grassley and Specter both sit on the
Judiciary Committee as well.
   The report was commissioned by the Twentieth Century Fund, a
private foundation that finances studies of public policy issues.
   The recommendation drew dissents from Washington attorneys and
former Carter administration officials Lloyd Cutler and Joseph
Califano.
   ``Supreme Court nominees should testify before the Senate and
they should get all the publicity that modern communications can
provide,'' said Califano, who was secretary of health, education
and welfare in the Carter administration.
   Cutler was Carter's White House counsel.
   The report noted that until the 1925 testimony of Harlan F.
Stone, no Supreme Court nominee had ever appeared as a witness
during confirmation proceedings. In 1939, Felix Frankfurter became
the second witness to testify before his confirmation.
   Besides Carey, members of the panel were former New York mayor
Robert F. Wagner, Washington attorney Michael M. Uhlmann,
Georgetown University professor Walter Berns, University of Chicago
law professor Philip B. Kurland and Nicholas J. Spaeth, attorney
general of North Dakota.
   Kurland, who advised the Senate Judiciary Committee's chairman,
Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., during the Bork hearings, dissented from
the conclusion that confirmation proceedings had become unduly
politicized.

<HEAD>Spot Inspections To Continue For Several Weeks On Eastern Jets</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto WX9</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Federal inspectors have examined almost all of
Eastern Airlines' 267 jets and found most in compliance with safety
rules, but say they will continue ramp inspections and look at many
of the aircraft again.
   The FAA said the 508 inspections at airports around the country
have covered all but 11 of Eastern's planes and found 43 cases in
which jets had to be taken out of service to correct problems. In
33 of the cases flights were delayed as a result, the agency said.
   FAA spokesman Bob Buckhorn said Tuesday he could not predict
precisely when the plane-by-plane inspections would conclude. He
said they would continue even after each of Eastern's jets is
examined at least once, possibly another several weeks.
   The FAA last week said it wanted to conclude the review of
Eastern and analyze its findings within 30 days
   Meanwhile, in a similar inspection at Continental Airlines,
which like Eastern is owned by Texas Air Corp., FAA inspectors
found one plane out of 15 examined in the first 24 hours that
needed to be taken out of service.
   One of the Continental jet's engines was found to be damaged
from a ``foreign object,'' Buckhorn said, adding that it is
conceivable that the airline might have taken the plane from
service even if no FAA inspector were present.
   The deficiencies found with the 43 Eastern plans that briefly
were sidelined included instances of leaking fuel and aircraft
corrosion, and one case in which 19 rivets were found to have
broken through an airplane's skin, Buckhorn said.
   Philip Bakes, president of Eastern, characterized these problems
as not unusual. ``In most every case the plane would have been
taken out of service'' even if there had been no FAA inspector
present, he said Tuesday at a news conference.
   ``Every day planes are being taken out of service'' as a normal
part of an airline's operation, he suggested.
   Frank Lorenzo, chairman of Texas Air Corp., the parent company
of both Eastern and Continental, told reporters that he welcomed
the federal inspections because they ``will demonstrate once and
for all that Continental and Eastern are safe _ as safe as any
major airline.''
   But in Miami, Charles Bryan, leader of the Eastern machinists
union, criticized the FAA ramp inspection as a ``whitewash'' and
charged that some of the FAA inspectors were only looking at log
books without inspecting the aircraft. He also said FAA inspectors
should ``go into the shops'' to observe maintenance of equipment.
   ``It may be the old fox watching the chicken house,'' said Bryan.
   Lorenzo and Bakes reiterated the airlines' past charges that
much of the turmoil about safety at both Eastern and Continental
stems from the airlines' ongoing battles with organized labor,
especially Bryan's machinists union.
   ``What is at issue is how far a union is permitted to go by
weakening a company through harassment ... (and) misinformation,''
said Lorenzo.
   Bakes blamed much of Eastern's problems on ``a slanderous safety
campaign'' by the unions which he said are determined to block
attempts by the airline to reduce labor costs.
   He said the company would continue to push for a reduction of
costs, including demands for wage concessions from the machinists
union. The airline and the union have been involved in negotiations
since the mechanics contract expired last December.
   Lorenzo and Bakes promised to continue pushing for concessions
from the unions, saying that was the only way to make Eastern
profitable. Lorenzo said he had no interest in selling Eastern and
accused the unions of waging a campaign of ``misinformation'' to
depress Eastern stock.

<HEAD>Two Federal Agencies Accused of Violating Sunshine Law</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT M. ANDREWS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal agencies with two notable exceptions
are generally complying with the ``sunshine'' law requiring them to
conduct important business in meetings open to the public, a Senate
hearing was told.
   The two persistent offenders were identified Tuesday as the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission. Both were accused of violating the spirit _ if not the
letter _ of the law intended to expose government decision-making
to closer public scrutiny.
   Sen. Lawton Chiles, D-Fla., chief sponsor of the 1976 law, said
recent congressional surveys reinforce his belief that ``on
balance, agencies are making efforts to comply with the law.''
   But Peter Prichard, senior news editor at USA Today, told a
Senate Governmental Affairs subcommittee headed by Chiles that
``the law does not work as well as it might.''
   Prichard, who represented the American Society of Newspaper
Editors and the American Newspaper Publishers Association, said the
law ``seems to have encouraged agencies to conduct well-scripted
meetings to fulfill the formalities of the law and to erect
memorials to decisions that actually occurred outside the public
view.''
   The law, which has no enforcement provisions, covers about 50
independent agencies but none of the Cabinet agencies headed by a
single administrator. In addition, discussions of such sensitive
issues as litigation, national security and personnel matters are
exempt.
   The NRC was singled out for criticism at Tuesday's hearing by
Ellyn R. Weiss, general counsel for the Union of Concerned
Scientists, who said there is a ``prevailing climate of public
phobia'' at the nuclear agency.
   ``The sun has not shone much over the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission,'' she said. ``NRC has for the past seven years mounted
a substantial and across-the-board assault on public participation
in its decision-making.''
   NRC spokeswoman Sue Gagner refused to comment on Ms. Weiss'
allegations.
   Claudia Withers of the Women's Legal Defense Fund, a non-profit
group that seeks elimination of sex discrimination in employment
and family law, made a similar complaint about the EEOC, the
independent agency responsible for enforcing anti-discrimination
laws.
   Ms. Withers said that after attending weekly agency meetings for
several months in 1985, ``it became clear to us that the EEOC
conducted little business of any real substance at its public
sessions'' and that detailed discussions actually took place
privately.
   She and Ms. Weiss said commissioners at both agencies evaded the
law's requirements by voting privately on policy memos circulated
among themselves, and then holding a public meeting simply to
announce their decisions.
   Ms. Withers said the EEOC ``may adhere to the letter of the
Sunshine Act, but ... sorely tests its spirit.''
   Deborah Graham, the EEOC's chief spokeswoman, denied Ms.
Withers' charges of secret decision-making and said the agency
holds weekly meetings with advance notice to the public.
   Ms. Graham said, however, that the number of closed EEOC
meetings has grown since September 1984. That is when the full
commission assumed responsibility from staff lawyers for handling
every discrimination dispute that called for possible court action,
she said.

<HEAD>Dukakis Win Could Be Good Sign For Democrats</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARC HUMBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis handed Jesse Jackson a setback
in New York on Tuesday from which he might not recover but the
Massachusetts governor did it without alienating Jackson's black
supporters.
   Dukakis managed to stay above the fray while Albert Gore Jr. and
New York Mayor Edward Koch battered Jackson, thus keeping open the
channels of communication to the civil rights leader and his core
black constituency.
   ``We're both very strong positive people,'' Dukakis said on ABC.
``We have a message of hope and optimism. Neither of us believes
cutting up the other guy is a way to win elections or the
presidency.''
   During one Harlem campaign stop, Dukakis was criticized for
giving up the black vote to Jackson. Exit polls showed that the
black vote went overwhelmingly for Jackson, as expected. Those
polls also showed, however, that many blacks felt Dukakis wasn't
sensitive to their needs.
   Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore Jr., on the other hand, was the first
Democratic candidate to go directly after Jackson, talking about
the need to elect a president not ``a preacher.''
   Then Gore picked up the endorsement of Koch and the attacks, now
coming from Koch, became more strident. Jews would have to be
``crazy'' to vote for Jackson and Jackson couldn't be trusted to
tell the truth under stress, said Koch.
   Gore, who had begun to soften his attacks on Jackson as the New
York campaign wound down and the Tennessee senator sensed his
coming defeat, eventually said Koch was ``speaking for himself.''
   Dukakis' New York victory was impressive in its own right. In
collecting about 50 percent of the vote, Dukakis bettered Walter
Mondale's 44 percent win in 1984. Jackson, running about even with
Dukakis in New York City, finished about 10 percentage points
higher than four years ago when he won 26 percent of the New York
vote.

<HEAD>Nunn Says Overhaul War Powers Act To Remove Withdrawal Timetables</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM AHERN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The War Powers Act needs to be overhauled to
eliminate a provision that sets automatic deadlines for withdrawal
of U.S. troops from global hotspots such as the Persian Gulf, says
an influential senator on national security issues.
   ``I think it needs to be substantially revised,'' said Sen. Sam
Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee.
   Nunn said he plans to propose revisions of the 1973 law within
the next several weeks, but said his proposal would not affect the
current Persian Gulf policy.
   ``I'm just in the process of drafting it now,'' said Nunn, who
explained he wants to discuss his proposals with Senate Majority
Leader Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., and administration officials.
   President Reagan has refused to invoke the War Powers Act for
his Persian Gulf policy, but he has consulted with congressional
leaders.
   The act requires a report from the White House within 48 hours
after U.S. troops are sent into areas of ``imminent hostilities.''
Under some circumstances, those forces would have to be withdrawn
within 60 days unless Congress votes to permit them to remain.
   Nunn said ``the automatic withdrawal provision ought to be
removed.'' Nunn has objected to the timetables because they are
arbitrary, Congress can circumvent them by using its power over the
pursestrings, and they shift the focus of the law away from
consultations between the president and Congress.
   He also plans to propose a leadership council of unnamed senior
congressional leaders who would consult with the president
regularly about national security issues.
   ``You cannot have 435 congressmen and 100 senators all be
informed,'' Nunn said. ``But you can have a leadership council and
then it becomes the job of congressional leaders to inform the
House and Senate.''
   Nunn said the law contains no enforcement provision and thus
Congress has no effective response to Reagan's refusal to invoke
the law.
   ``The law is on the books and it ought to either be obeyed or
declared unconstitutional,'' Nunn said. ``But if the president
decides he's not going to follow the law, there's nothing Congress
can do.''
   Congress has the option of passing a bill to invoke the War
Powers Act, he said, but Reagan could veto that bill and a
two-thirds vote of the House and Senate would then have to override
the veto to trigger the law.
   Reagan was widely praised on Capitol Hill this week for telling
House and Senate leaders about the planned U.S. attacks on Iranian
oil platforms before the attacks started.
   But some senators still said the War Powers Act should be
invoked, arguing that the last U.S.-Iran clash meets the
requirements of the bill.
   ``If this situation doesn't trigger War Powers, nothing will,''
said Sen. Brock Adams, D-Wash., one of the chief Senate critics of
Reagan's refusal to invoke the law.
   Reagan, as have all previous presidents, contends that the act
is an unconstitutional limit on his authority to conduct foreign
policy.
   Last summer, a group of 115 legislators, most of them House
Democrats, sued in federal court here to seek an order requiring
Reagan to trigger the law. The suit was dismissed on grounds that
it was a political dispute and thus outside the reach of the
judiciary, but the legislators are appealing that ruling.
   The only time that Congress has succeeded in invoking the War
Powers law was 1983, when U.S. Marines were sent into Beirut as
part of an international peacekeeping force. Congress extended the
deployment deadline to 18 months, but the Marines were withdrawn
three months after 241 servicemen, most of them Marines, were
killed by a suicide truck bomber.

<HEAD>Senate Approves Bill to Limit `Revolving Door' Lobbying</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID GOELLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Advocates of closing Washington's ``revolving
door'' are optimistic following Senate approval of a measure to
restrict lobbying by former members of Congress and top executive
branch officials.
   ``I think we stand a chance'' in the House, Sen. Strom Thurmond,
R-S.C., said Tuesday after voice-vote Senate passage of a bill that
includes the first prohibitions on lobbying by former senators and
representatives.
   Ann McBride, senior vice president of Common Cause, the
self-described citizens' lobby, said that ``the real question now
is what happens in the House. Whether the bill becomes law rests
with the House Democratic leadership.''
   The ethical issue of post-employment lobbying is scheduled for
its first recent House airing on Thursday at a hearing by the
Judiciary subcommittee on administrative law and governmental
relations.
   Moving over from the Senate is a compromise package by Thurmond
and Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, that represents the Senate's
response to the recent influence-selling activities of Michael
Deaver and Lyn Nofziger after they left top-level posts in the
Reagan White House.
   Nofziger has been convicted of illegal lobbying while Deaver has
been convicted of perjury during an investigation into his lobbying
activities.
   ``We want to change the way things operate in this city,'' said
Metzenbaum. ``Lobbyists should be paid for what they know, not who
they know.''
   A 10-year-old ethics law makes it a crime for an executive
branch official to lobby his or her former agency within a year of
leaving the agency. Critics say rulings by the Office of Government
Ethics have weakened the law.
   Congress, as it has done for many laws, exempted itself from
coverage.
   To win easy Senate approval, Thurmond and Metzenbaum scrapped
their plan to ban any lobbying by lawmakers and the highest
executive branch officials _ Cabinet secretaries, their deputies
and top-level White House people _ for a year after they leave
office.
   Instead, they accepted an amendment by Sen. Warren Rudman,
R-N.H., that would leave former senators and representatives free
to lobby all but Congress and the highest levels of the executive
branch.
   Still, the Rudman amendment would impose some new restrictions.
   Top executive branch officials, including generals and admirals,
could not lobby the executive branch or members of Congress for a
year. However, they could attempt to influence congressional
staffers, who do much of the nuts-and-bolts work on Capitol Hill.
   Former lawmakers would be barred from lobbying Congress and top
executive branch officials for a year. Still open, however, would
be a vast governmental territory: assistant Cabinet secretaries,
career bureaucrats and heads of independent and regulatory agencies.
   The bill would broaden the current law by putting a year's
lobbying restriction on post-employment activities by lower ranking
political appointees and congressional staffers and career
bureaucrats earning more than $64,397 a year.
   An 18-month ban would be imposed on leaving a federal job and
going to work for a foreign government. The ban would cover
legislative and executive branch people making more than $64,397 _
except for former members of Congress.
   The legislation would make violations a felony, with a top
penalty of five years in prison and a $250,000 fine, up from the
present two years and $10,000.
   Thurmond said he took the Rudman amendment ``out of a spirit of
compromise'' because he wanted to send a ``strong message'' to the
House.
   ``These changes are acceptable,'' he said. ``They do not
substantially weaken the bill.''
   The Senate added several other amendments:
   _One sponsored by Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., would prohibit a
congressional candidate from soliciting funds after an election to
pay off personal or bank loans to the candidate's campaign.
   _Another Rudman amendment would prohibit senators and
representatives from holding outside jobs _ such as working in a
law firm _ while serving in Congress. The Senate has a rule against
this; the House doesn't.
   _A third Rudman amendment would repeal the law that allows
members of Congress elected before 1980 to keep excess campaign
funds for personal use, so long as they pay income tax on the money.

   Iran has suffered its two most serious defeats
of the eight-year Iran-Iraq war, losing a one-sided engagement with
the U.S. Navy and reportedly being knocked off the Faw Peninsula by
the smaller Iraqi army.
   Despite the setbacks, many U.S. analysts do not believe that
Iran is in danger of defeat at the hands of Iraq.
   But they are divided over why Iran risked battle with the
world's mightiest navy, and why the United States apparently sought
confrontation with Iran after a months-long lull in the land and
tanker wars in gulf.
   The naval battle in the Persian Gulf on Monday dealt a heavy
blow to any possible improvement in relations between Iran and the
United States, and it suggests that the Reagan administration may
have badly miscalculated the Iranian reaction to what U.S.
officials called a ``measured, appropriate response'' to a mining
attack on an American warship last week.
   President Reagan, defending the U.S. military action, said
Tuesday that ``we ... consider the matter closed.''
   Many analysts in and out of government believed it unlikely that
Iran would let the issue die, and predicted more terrorist attacks
in the gulf and elsewhere.
   Given the renewed antagonism between Washington and Tehran, it
appeared unlikely that Moscow would ease its objections to a United
Nations embargo on arms sales to Iran and Iraq, a U.S. initiative
designed to broaden international efforts to stop the fighting.
   The Democratic chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee,
Sen. Sam Nunn of Georgia, warned that ``we've got to make sure that
we do not turn this into a U.S.-Iranian war,'' a situation the U.N.
embargo was designed to counter.
   In the Iranian view, said Georgetown University professor
Anthony Cordesman, ``the United States seems to be the real force
that is driving them from victory'' in the Iran-Iraq war.
   The Iranian decision to engage U.S. forces may have been
calculated to inflict heavy casualties on the Americans and thereby
induce Congress to invoke the War Powers Act, possibly forcing the
withdrawal of American ships from the Persian Gulf.
   Navy officers said that although Iran's navy is small, it has
modern weapons that could sink an unwary or unlucky U.S. ship.
   Heavy U.S. casualties, said Cordesman, could have provoked loud
cries on Capitol Hill for the War Powers Act, passed after the
Vietnam War to give Congress 60, or at most 90, days to vote
whether to leave U.S. forces in a war zone.
   In ordering retaliatory strikes against two Iranian oil
platforms, U.S. war planners misjudged the mood in Iran, said James
Bill, author of a new book on U.S.-Iranian relations, ``The Eagle
and the Lion.''
   ``We are dealing with a country that is desperate and
cornered,'' said Bill.
   A year ago, administration analysts worried that Iraq could lose
the war, opening the way to Iranian domination of the Arab states
bordering the gulf.
   Last July, U.S. naval vessels began to escort reflagged Kuwaiti
tankers in and out of the gulf in what administration officials
described as an effort to protect international shipping.
   Many analysts outside the administration viewed the reflagging
as an effort to bolster Iraq, and in Iran's view that has been the
effect, as Iraq has enjoyed subsequent military successes and Iran
has suffered setbacks.
   The regime of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini failed to mount its
annual Kerbala offensive on the southern front with Iraq this
winter, and there have been numerous reports of problems in
recruiting ``martyrs'' for the war.
   Iran has been on the losing end of an exchange of missiles, the
``war of the cities,'' that has inflicted limited damage on the
Iraqi capital of Baghdad but reportedly terrorized the Iranian
capital of Tehran and holy city of Qom.
   Iran was somewhat successful on the northern front, taking some
towns in Kurdistan, but was shocked by an alleged Iraqi chemical
attack in that region this winter.
   Iranian media have reported that U.S. helicopters were flying
air support for Iraqi ground forces involved in retaking the Faw
Peninsula, allegations that were denied by U.S. officials.
   ``The Iranians think that the Faw and the U.S. naval attacks
were worked out in advance,'' said Bill, a specialist in Iranian
affairs and professor at William and Mary College in Williamsburg,
Va.
   ``Strategically, this is going to set back U.S.-Iranian
relations for 30 to 40 years,'' said Bill. ``We need to take a
long-range, strategic view, not a short-range tactical view.''

   The body of a Navy enlisted
woman killed last week in a terrorist attack in Italy has been
returned to the United States in a flag-draped coffin.
   A C-5A Galaxy cargo jet carrying the remains of Radioman 3rd
Class Angela S. Santos landed at Dover Air Force Base just as the
sun peered from behind clouds Tuesday afternoon.
   During brief ceremonies beside the plane, her mother, Ellagene
E. Cruz, and Ms. Santos' brother James, both of Ocala, Fla., stood
with her father, James J. Santos Sr. of Isabela, Puerto Rico.
   ``She's the first Navy female killed as a result of a terrorist
act and quite possibly'' the first servicewoman ever, said Navy
spokesman Alfred R. Twyman Jr.
   Pallbearers moved slowly through the ranks of an honor guard,
while the band played the Navy Hymn, and placed the coffin in a
white hearse.
   Ms. Santos, 21, of Ocala, was among five people killed Thursday
when terrorists parked a bomb-laden car outside the USO club in
Naples. Four U.S. sailors were among 17 people wounded.

<HEAD>Lyng Meets With Canadian Counterpart On Trade Issues</HEAD>

   A presidential veto of the massive trade bill
now before Congress wouldn't directly affect the free-trade
agreement between the United States and Canada, according to
Agriculture Secretary Richard E. Lyng.
   ``There's nothing that tells me that they're connected,'' Lyng
said Tuesday. If there is a veto of the sweeping trade bill,
President Reagan's veto message would ``describe some reasons that
have nothing whatsoever to do with the free trade agreement with
Canada, as far as I can see.''
   Lawmakers are near final action on the 1,000-page trade bill,
but there have been veto threats over parts the administration find
objectionable, including a provision that would require 60-day
notice of plant closings and large-scale layoffs.
   The U.S.-Canada trade pact was signed Jan. 2 but still requires
approval by the Canadian parliament and the U.S. Congress. If
approved, the treaty will take effect Jan. 1, 1989, and will
gradually eliminate all tariffs between the two countries and
address non-tariff barriers.
   According to the Agriculture Department, U.S-Canada trade was
about $124 billion in 1986, of which $4.6 billion was agricultural.
   Lyng appeared at a news conference with Canadian minister of
agriculture John Wise following private discussions. Wise said he
was pleased by Lyng's view of the trade bill and said there is
``the absolute need and the absolute necessity for us to join
forces'' in ongoing global talks under the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade, or GATT.
   ``In fact, I think, were it not for the leadership taken by
Canada and the United States ... we probably wouldn't be at the
stage that we are now in the Uruguay Round of multinational trade
negotiations,'' Wise said.
   Both he and Lyng said the U.S.-Canada free-trade agreement would
help push the cause of global reform.
   ``It would be extremely helpful, I think, to both of us, in
sending a very legitimate and a very concrete message to our other
trading partners, particularly at GATT,'' Wise said.
   In a joint statement later, the two agricultural leaders pledged
to work together ``to ensure that the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development ministerial meeting in May and the
Toronto economic summit in June provide the necessary political
impetus'' for a midterm review of the Uruguay Round next December
in Montreal.

   Large Soviet purchases of wheat at subsidized
prices have helped increase grain exports and brighten financial
prospects for American farmers, says an Agriculture Department
report.
   Overall, the Soviet Union's total grain imports are at a
three-year high, despite bumper harvests the last two seasons, the
department's Economic Research Service said Tuesday.
   ``The gain is primarily from larger wheat purchases,'' the
report said. ``Aided by the Export Enhancement Program and Soviet
demand for milling-quality wheat, the U.S. share of import volume
is likely to rise to about half this year, up from less than 1
percent in 1985-86.''
   The Soviet Union is expected to import 32 million metric tons of
total grain from all foreign sources in the international marketing
year that runs through June 30, 1988. That would be the most since
imports were a record 55.5 million tons in 1984-85.
   The wheat share of this year's imports is estimated at 22
million tons, the most since 1984-85 when wheat rose to 28.1
million tons.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushels
of wheat.
   Soviet wheat imports dropped sharply in 1985-86 to 15.7 million
tons, when the U.S. share declined to a trickle.
   Under a five-year agreement, the Soviet Union is committed to
buy at least 4 million of wheat and 4 million tons of corn
annually. The pact expires this Sept. 30 and covers the year that
began last Oct. 1.
   Although the agreement year is three months out of step with the
July 1-June 30 marketing year, it does show a similar trend in
Soviet grain imports.
   For example, Soviet wheat purchases fell short of the pact's
minimum in 1984-85 when they dropped to 2.9 million tons, and in
1985-86 when they were only 200,000 tons. That coincided with the
``less than 1 percent'' U.S. share cited in the latest report.
   The Export Enhancement Progam, or EEP, allows exporters to sell
designated commodities to specified countries at reduced prices and
then collect free USDA-owned commodities as bonuses, or subsidies.
   Subsidized wheat sales to the Soviet Union began a year ago. So
far Moscow has bought more than 8.8 million tons for delivery in
1987-88, the final year of the grain pact.
   In addition, the Soviets have bought 4.1 million tons of U.S.
corn, 818,400 tons of soybeans and 1.3 million tons of soybean meal
for delivery through Sept. 30.

   The Agriculture Department is asking for
public comments on how to design the 1989 wheat program.
   One the biggest decisions will be whether to include an acreage
reduction program, or ARP, in next year's program. That involves
how much of a farmer's wheat base must be idled in order to qualify
for 1989 price supports and other program benefits.
   For the 1988 wheat crop, as an example, participating farmers
had to reduce plantings by 27.5 percent of their wheat base.
   The 1985 farm law requires USDA to announce the following year's
wheat ARP no later than June 1, officials said Tuesday.
   Comments can be sent by May 16 to: Director, Commodity Analysis
Division, USDA-ASCS, Room 3741-S, P.O. Box 2415, Washington, D.C.

<HEAD>Partisan Report Says Recession Could Cause Havoc With Deficits</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN KOMAROW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The huge budget and trade deficits of the
Reagan administration will ``define the course of the nation's
economic policy for the remainder of the century'' and threaten
real hardship if there's a recession, the congressional Joint
Economic Committee said today.
   The Democratic-controlled panel concludes in its annual review
that the nation will struggle with ``the legacy of experiment'' in
supply-side economics, large spending increases for the military
and an ever-growing debt.
   The report credits last fall's federal deficit-reduction
agreement between President Reagan and congressional leaders as a
major step toward controlling the record red ink, which will
approach $3 trillion by the end of the decade.
   That amount is more than three times what it was when Reagan
took office.
   The report calls the agreement ``only a first step,'' noting
that current deficit projections assume a stable economy. ``Should
a recession occur, the federal budget situation would deteriorate
rapidly, risking a serious disruption in financial markets.''
   The report hesitates to predict when a recession will occur.
   ``Given the mixed signals of 1987, it is hardly surprising that
there is considerable uncertainty among the professional
forecasters about the course of the economy in 1988,'' it said.
   Despite last year's stock market collapse, consumer spending has
remained strong. Business and housing investment has been mixed.
   ``Previous forecasts of a significant drop in our net imports
have not been borne out, however, as the competitive effects of the
declining value of the dollar have been slow to be realized,'' it
said.
   At the same time, ``some forecasters are now beginning to raise
questions about possible inflationary overheating of the economy,''
it said.
   The next president will have to find a new set of economic
policies while adjusting to a greater international influence over
the nation's economy due in part to the large foreign debt. During
the 1980s, the United States has gone from the world's largest
creditor to its largest debtor.
   The report's recommendations include diligent attention to the
domestic and foreign trade deficits along with prudent investment
in education and job training.
   ``These critical deficits were built up over a number of
years,'' it said. ``They will not be rectified quickly.''
   The Republicans on the committee, dissenting from the Democrats,
cite in their section of the report the extended strength of the
current economic expansion, now in its sixth year.
   ``The foundation of any economy is a people at productive
work,'' they said. ``Never has the foundation of our economy been
stronger.''

   The Federal Aviation Administration hopes to
improve the performance of commuter airline flight crews in an
effort to cut down on a spate of accidents since last year, the
agency's chief says.
   Allan McArtor told the House aviation subcommittee Tuesday that
a yearlong inspection of the nation's commuter carriers will result
in better crew training standards. The first draft is expected by
the fall, he said.
   ``I feel strongly that the most important steps we can take to
improve safety are to enhance air crew performance,'' McArtor said.
``That will provide the largest safety benefits in the long run.''
   At the same hearing, McArtor's agency came in for criticism by a
member of the National Transportation Safety Board, the federal
agency that oversees accidents.
   ``A sufficient margin of safety in air carrier operations can
only be achieved through effective surveillance by FAA
inspectors,'' John K. Lauber said. ``However, we continue to find
evidence in our accident investigations of spotty and ineffective
FAA surveillance of commuter airlines.''
   Commuter airlines, which primarily rely upon small,
propeller-driven planes to serve small communities, have grown
rapidly in recent years. The number of passengers they fly annually
has grown from 12.9 million in 1980 to 27.2 million last year.
   But after a record-low accident rate in 1986, the commuters
suffered 33 accidents and 58 fatalities last year, the highest
totals in the 1980s, according to FAA figures. Six commuter
accidents and 22 deaths have occurred so far this year.
   Lauber said the growth of air travel has increased demand for
pilots, causing the major airlines to hire fliers away from the
smaller commuter carriers. This forces the commuters to fill their
own jobs with pilots who have less experience than in the past, he
said.
   ``In the current era of rapid pilot turnover and the hiring of
less-experienced pilots in the commuter industry, this question of
pilot experience is becoming even more critical,'' Lauber said.
   McArtor, however, said an examination of the pilots involved in
last year's commuter airline accidents doesn't support the
conclusion that inexperience has been a factor in the recent
crashes.
   He said statistics gathered by the FAA covering most of the
pilots indicated that on average, they had sufficient experience.
   Lauber said other problems commuter airlines face include a lack
of simulators to train pilots, instruments that vary widely and can
confuse fliers and excessive cockpit noise that inhibits
communication between crew members.

   Politicians from natural-gas producing states
are trying to forge an unlikely coalition of industry and
environmental interests to promote the product and lobby Congress.
   Texas Land Commissioner Garry Mauro, who was among those
attending a symposium on the subject Tuesday, said the natural gas
industry has been timid too long.
   ``The squeaky wheel gets the oil, but natural gas hasn't been
squeaky enough,'' Mauro said. ``It's not told its story loud
enough.''
   Oilman T. Boone Pickens, general partner of Mesa Limited
Partnership, told the gathering the domestic oil industry will
never return to its former glory.
   ``There's not much future for the domestic oil industry,''
Pickens said. ``But there is a lot of potential for the natural gas
industry.''
   Many of those attending the daylong symposium agreed that
natural gas, the cleanest-burning fossil fuel, can play an
important role in efforts to rid cities of pollutants from industry
and vehicle emissions.
   Daniel Weiss, a representative of the Sierra Club, said his
group would support the use of natural gas in legislation aimed at
cleaning up the environment.
   But officials said a significant switch to natural gas or other
alternate fuels by power plants or automobiles is still years away.
   Rep. Mike Synar, D-Okla., said some pressure could come this
fall if Congress approves legislation by Aug. 31 to yank highway
and other funding from cities and states that don't comply with
clean-air standards. Congress has lifted its requirement that
cities meet those standards until the end of August.
   According to the Environmental Protection Agency, 72 cities are
not meeting clean-air requirements and are benefiting from the
congressional reprieve.

<HEAD>Dukakis Seen As Having Advantage In Next Battle: Pennsylvania</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Democratic presidential contender Michael
Dukakis, fresh from a solid win in New York's big primary, was
looking to consolidate his strength with a repeat performance here
next week. But rival Jesse Jackson warned not to count him out.
   A prize of 178 delegates, the fourth-largest of any state race,
is at stake in next Tuesday's primary here.
   ``Tomorrow, we take our message ... to Pennsylvania and Ohio and
Indiana,'' Dukakis said in a victory speech in New York. ``And
after that, we will take our message _ the Democratic message _ to
every part of the country.''
   The Jackson camp offered congratulations, but said the New York
primary didn't settle things.
   ``We continue to win. We have won,'' Jackson told supporters in
New York. ``Our campaign continues to grow.''
   ``We think we're still in this race,'' said Jackson's campaign
manager, Gerald Austin. Jackson was heading to Pennsylvania tonight.
   Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore Jr., who finished a distant third in
New York, was considering abandoning his presidential bid.
   On the Republican side, Vice President George Bush, who is
virtually assured his party's nomination, campaigned Tuesday in the
state.
   A poll in today's editions of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette and
Philadelphia Daily News indicated Dukakis led Jesse Jackson among
likely Democratic voters primary by a 59-20 margin. The poll of 647
likely Democratic voters, conducted Tuesday through Sunday, had a
margin of error of plus or minus five percentage points.
   ``The most likely scenario is that Dukakis uses Pennsylvania to
solidify his front-runnership, his hold on the nomination,'' said
Lt. Gov. Mark Singel, a Democrat who is neutral in the race.
   Jackson supporters complained that Pennsylvania's
delegate-selection system stacks the cards against their candidate.
The state's popular vote is merely a beauty contest and the real
winner in the primary must succeed in elections in the state's 23
congressional districts.
   ``We could win the state and lose 80 percent of the delegates,''
said Steve Cobble, Jackson's delegate coordinator, calling the
process ``one of the last vestiges of Republican-type politics in
the Democratic Party.''
   ``It ought to be done away with,'' Cobble said.
   Jackson's strength is largely in three of the 23 districts, in
Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, where most of the state's blacks live.
Blacks make up about 11 percent of state's voting-age population.
   ``Even in the best scenario, how he (Jackson) gets more than 30
delegates, I don't know,'' said G. Terry Madonna, director of the
Center for Politics and Public Affairs at Millersville University.
``If it's a two-man race, it could be 3-1 Dukakis.''
   Jackson has only 79 candidates for 116 delegate slots to be
filled from Pennsylvania's 23 congressional districts. Another 62
pledged delegates will be appointed in June based on the delegate
division Tuesday.
   To fill in the delegate gaps, the Jackson campaign said Tuesday
it has mounted a ``Dropouts Turn To Jesse'' program to recruit
delegate candidates pledged to Democratic hopefuls who have left
the field.
   ``It's going well,'' said spokeswoman Janice Fine. ``We have a
number thinking about it, no question.''
   She said the campaign already has commitments from 8 to 10
delegates and is working to fill other holes in Jackson's delegate
field.
   But he said the outcome in Pennsylvania would not dampen
Jackson's continuing campaign.
   State Democratic Chairman Larry Yatch said Jackson would carry
Philadelphia. ``The rest of the state, at least demographically,
doesn't seem to bode well for Jackson,'' Yatch said.
   Singel, the lieutenant governor, also predicted Dukakis would
win, but said Jackson would do better than most Democratic
officials believe.
   ``I'll make a prediction to you that Jesse Jackson will get
between 35 and 40 percent of the popular vote in Pennsylvania,'' he
said.
   The Dukakis campaign has said it's ready for a fight in
Pennsylvania.
   ``Mike is taking nothing for granted,'' said his Pennsylvania
spokesman Pat McCarthy. He added, however, that a win in
Pennsylvania could put Dukakis ``over the psychological top.''
   Jackson's workers, however, remained upbeat.
   ``As far as I can see, everything is going fine. We've got great
expectations in Pennsylvania,'' said Jamillah Muhammad, a national
Jackson campaign staffer working in Pittsburgh.
   Jackson, who won 16 percent of the vote and 18 delegates in a
three-way primary race in 1984, hopes to court disaffected
blue-collar workers in southwestern Pennsylvania, where
unemployment still reaches double digits in some areas.
   ``We'll do better than in 1984, exceed expectations and give
Dukakis a hell of a run for his money,'' said Ms. Fine. ``We're
very competitive in Pennsylvania.''

   A Los Angeles Police Department radio
log from the night Robert F. Kennedy was shot was released Tuesday,
showing that the officer who took the initial call was unsure
whether the matter was important.
   The speakers on the tape recording, which was made available as
part of the voluminous file on Kennedy's 1968 assassination, were
not identified.
   The following is a partial exchange by a woman caller and a male
police officer.
   Woman: ``This is the Ambassador Hotel. They have an emergency.''
   Policeman: ``What kind of emergency?''
   Woman: ``I don't know. Some kind of an emergency. You know we
have Mr. Kennedy here ...''
   Policeman: ``Big deal!''
   Woman (brief pause): ``I think somebody was shot.''
   Policeman: ``Oh great.''
   Woman: ``You want me to find out more?''
   Policeman: ``Yes, ma'am.''
   Woman (pause lasting several seconds): ``Senator Kennedy has
been shot.''
   Policeman: ``He's been shot?''
   Woman: ``That's right. You'd beter send someone here.''
   Policeman: ``What's the address there?'' apparently unaware of
the location of one of the largest hotels in Los Angeles.
   The radio logs reflected conversations which continued
throughout the night. Even after officers had arrived at the scene,
one of them radioed, ``Senator Kennedy has been shot at the
Ambasador,'' and a dispatcher responded, ``Senator who?''
   It took about 20 minutes before the information appeared to be
straightened out and a dispatcher announced to all cars: ``The
shooting was of Senator Bob Kennedy. The suspect is in custody.''

<HEAD>Mayor Koch A Loser In NY Primary</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MITCHELL LANDSBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Among the losers in New York's Democratic
primary Tuesday was Mayor Edward I. Koch, who conceded that his
bitter attacks on the Rev. Jesse Jackson were apparently a mistake.
   Despite the mayor's high-profile criticism, Jackson won New York
City by about 6,000 votes over primary-winner Michael Dukakis in a
heavy turnout of slightly less than 1 million voters. Jackson won
37 percent of the vote overall.
   ``While he was making hysteria, I was making history,'' Jackson
said after the votes were counted.
   Meanwhile, network television exit polls suggested Koch's
hardball tactics may haunt him if he runs for re-election in 1989.
   Koch, who endorsed Sen. Al Gore and then campaigned side by side
with him, has been widely criticized for his attacks.
   ``If he had been more subtle about it, it may have been more
devastating to the Jackson campaign,'' said Jackson's campaign
manager, California Assembly Speaker Willie Brown.
   ``But the flagrant display of anti-Jackson attitudes, that
appear to be primarily based on Mr. Jackson's race, have
embarrassed some of the people in New York who may have been
otherwise against Jackson.''
   Gore's 8.3 percent in New York City was even behind his 10
percent statewide total.
   In the last few days of the hard-fought primary, Koch was
seemingly always at Gore's side in his city appearances. The mayor
claimed the headlines with a steady stream of invective against
Jackson.
   Koch sharply attacked Jackson's positions on Israel, said Jews
``would be crazy'' to vote for him and then called him arrogant for
failing to march in a Salute to Israel parade.
   Asked Tuesday night if he would make the same remarks if the
clock were turned back, Koch said, ``Obviously, I would not make
them the way I did because, apparently, they were not helpful to Al
Gore.''
   Although Gore thanked Koch for his help, he also distanced
himself from the mayor's tactics. Congratulating Jackson on his
showing, Gore said he never wanted to ``stop Jackson. I just wanted
to start Al Gore.''
   A CBS-New York Times exit poll showed that voters disagreed with
Koch's criticism of Jackson by a 2-1 margin.
   In an early NBC exit poll, 60 percent of the voters said they
didn't want Koch to run for re-election next year.
   ``It looks like Ed Koch certainly didn't help Gore and may have
helped stimulate a black turnout for Jackson,'' said ABC pollster
Doug Muzzio. ``Ed Koch may be a loser here.''

   The JVC Jazz Festival is promising something for
fans of every jazz style with headliners including Dizzy Gillespie,
Ella Fitzgerald, Lionel Hampton, B.B. King, Mel Torme and Sarah
Vaughan.
   ``Our list of artists this year reflects the myriad tastes of
the jazz fan from all eras,'' festival impresario George Wein said
Tuesday at a news conference to announce the lineup for the June 24
to July 2 event.
   Performances will not be limited to bebop, swing and Dixieland
as the event's predecessor, the Newport Jazz Festival, was when it
premiered in 1954.
   Opening night, a Friday, will feature Gillespie, Hampton, Marty
Napoleon, Arvell Shaw, Clark Terry, Roy Eldridge, Jimmy Owens,
Warren Vache, Wynton Marsalis and Jon Faddis in a tribute to Louis
Armstrong.
   Miss Fitzgerald, who is singing again after several months'
absence from the scene, will appear at Carnegie Hall the second
night, while Miles Davis and a new star, Gerald Albright, perform
in Avery Fisher Hall.
   The Toshiko Akiyoshi and Mel Lewis bands are booked at Town Hall
the same night. The evening begins with Billy Taylor playing solo
piano at Weill Recital Hall in Carnegie Hall.
   The third night offers a choice between four Duke Ellington
symphonic pieces by the American Composers Orchestra, tap-dancing
or Jim Cullum's Jazz Band interpreting ``Porgy and Bess.''
   Jay McShann of early Kansas City jazz fame and the Charles
Mingus All-Star Big Band play June 27.
   Gillespie's band and singer Carmen McRae and her quartet share
the Carnegie Hall bill June 28 while King, the Fabulous
Thunderbirds, Bonnie Raitt and Dr. John offer varieties of blues at
Avery Fisher Hall.
   The entertainment June 29 includes Torme, Cissy Houston and the
Sweet Inspirations and other singers at Carnegie and Hampton's band
and Wynton Marsalis' quintet at Avery Fisher.
   The offerings June 30 begin with Marian McPartland playing solo
piano at Weill Recital Hall. At 8 p.m., there's the choice of
hearing Miss Vaughan at Carnegie, the Carlos Santana-Wayne Shorter
Group at Avery Fisher and the Dave Brubeck Quartet at the 92nd
Street Y.
   The late Buddy Rich's big band will be at Carnegie Hall while
Kenny G and Stanley Jordan will be at Avery Fisher on July 1.
   The final night, music associated with the late Billy Holiday
will be presented at Town Hall. Miki Howard and Najee will be at
Avery Fisher and ``Latin Jazz Jam: a Tribute to Machito'' is at
Carnegie.

   Michael Dukakis and Jesse Jackson fought
to a virtual draw in Vermont's Democratic caucuses Tuesday night in
a seesaw battle that tightened dramatically as the votes piled up.
   Early Wednesday, with nearly all the votes counted, Dukakis held
a razor-thin lead. The Massachusetts governor had scored a 2-1
victory in the state's ``beauty contest'' primary last month.
   With 94 percent of 1,300 state convention delegates picked,
Dukakis had 559, or 46 percent, while Jackson had 547, or 45
percent. Albert Gore Jr. had 4, or 0 percent; 110 delegates, or 9
percent, were uncommitted.
   Dukakis would win 8 national convention delegates and Jackson 6,
if those results held up at the state convention.
   Jackson had held a narrow lead throughout most of the counting.
In New York, where he lost to Dukakis, Jackson claimed victory in
the contest here.
   ``We won Vermont tonight,'' he told supporters.
   A win for Jackson in the Democratic caucuses would be a
disappointment for the Dukakis campaign, which has most prominent
Democrats in the state behind it, including Gov. Madeleine Kunin,
Sen. Patrick Leahy, Lt. Gov. Howard Dean and House Speaker Ralph
Wright.
   Kunin said Jackson's strong showing in Vermont was ``not
unexpected,'' and pointed to Dukakis' solid victory in Tuesday's
big New York primary.
   ``I continue to be very optimistic about Dukakis,'' she said.
``I think his showing in New York is fantastic.''
   In the state's largest city of Burlington, Jackson won 60
percent of the delegates at a caucus highlighted by the appearance
of Burlington Mayor Bernard Sanders, a Jackson backer and a
socialist who has long fought the Democrats.
   ``I have no apologies to make to anybody,'' Sanders said before
the caucus, responding to Democrats who opposed his appearance at
their event.
   Sanders ran successfully as an independent for mayor and
unsuccessfully as an independent for governor. This year he is
running as an independent for the U.S. House.
   On the Republican side, some 1,000 delegates to the state GOP
convention were being chosen Tuesday night. With 33 percent of the
delegates accounted for, Vice President George Bush had 291
delegates, or 89 percent, while 34, or 10 percent, were uncommitted.
   Backers of Dukakis, who has long been favored here, were making
less upbeat statements just before Tuesday's town caucuses.
   ``I hear everything from we're dead in the water to we might
make it,'' said William Wasserman, state coordinator for Dukakis,
the governor of neighboring Massachusetts. Supporters of Jackson
said they had built a solid organization in Vermont and noted that
Jackson has done better in caucus states, with relatively small
turnouts, than in primary states.
   The 1,300 delegates elected Tuesday night will attend next
month's state convention, at which time 14 of Vermont's 19
delegates to the national convention will be chosen. The remaining
five spots belong to Gov. Kunin, a Dukakis backer, and four state
party officials.
   On the Republican side, Pat Robertson's campaign tried to turn
out supporters so that Robertson would still have a voice at the
state and national conventions.
   ``The Bush forces rallied and were able to overcome the
Robertson forces,'' said Bush's Vermont spokesman, Steve Watson.
``We had the best turnout ever in some towns.''
   Dukakis won Vermont's presidential primary March 1, with 56
percent of the vote to Jackson's 26 percent. But that primary was
non-binding and had nothing to do with the selection of actual
delegates. And recent history has shown primary winners don't fare
as well in the caucuses.
   Gary Hart won the presidential primary four years ago, but
Walter Mondale won the caucus vote. Eight years ago Jimmy Carter
won the primary, but Edward Kennedy won the caucuses.
   The primary tends to be more of a popularity contest, while the
outcome of the caucuses revolves around campaign organization.
   ``Jesse Jackson has done better in caucus states than primary
states,'' said Liz Blum, Jackson state coordinator in Vermont,
noting that his supporters are so strongly behind him that they
will attend caucuses.
   ``We have identified Jackson supporters all over the state and
have built a solid organization,'' she said.
   About 670 people attended the Burlington Democratic caucus,
compared to 435 during the 1984 contest.
   ``Most of the towns that I've talked to, have told me that
they've had the largest turnouts that they can remember,'' said
Craig Fuller, the executive director of the state's Democratic
Party. ``They are interested in who's going to be the next
president.''

   With the Rio Grande flowing underneath

serves as an international bridge in this border town.
   Sam and Connie McSpadden's brief ferry tale wedding found them
tying the knot Tuesday as crewmen pulled ropes to propel the vessel
across the narrow river crossing.
   Los Ebanos International Ferry is the only hand-pulled ferry
used at any U.S. port of entry.
   ``It's the last one of its kind, I'm only planning on making the
same mistake once, which I just made a while ago, and it's weird,''
McSpadden said after the ceremony while drinking a beer under an
ebony tree near the federal inspection offices.
   McSpadden, 44, and his 41-year-old bride live in South Padre
Island and said they always visit the historic ferry on frequent
trips to Rio Grande City.
   ``It was kind of mutual,'' she said, when asked whose idea it
was to marry on a ferry with Mexico in the background.
   Hidalgo County Justice of the Peace Arnaldo Corpus said he has
married people aboard an airplane, but never on a boat at the
border.

   Resnik, who was 36 when she was killed in the Jan. 28, 1986,
explosion, graduated from Carnegie Mellon University in 1970 with a
bachelor's degree in electrical engineering.
   The sculpture was commissioned by Tau Beta Pi, the national

metal sculpture is shaped in the society's symbol, a bent set.
   When Resnik died, Carnegie Mellon created a scholarship fund in
her memory. This year two women electrical engineering students

<HEAD>Speakes Says He Wronged President Reagan With Phony Quotes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former White House spokesman Larry Speakes
says he regrets concocting quotes that he passed off as President
Reagan's own words and acknowledges he has ``provided fodder'' for
the president's critics.
   ``I have wronged President Reagan, a man whom I deeply admire
and respect'' Speakes said Tuesday. ``And I have provided fodder
for those who would aim their cannons of criticism at the president
I served loyally for six years. I deeply regret it.''
   Speakes, in an address at a Washington Post Book and Author
Luncheon, said he had been ``overzealous'' and ``misguided'' in
attributing statements to Reagan that had been manufactured in the
press office.
   His comments were reported in today's editions of The Washington
Post.
   Speakes on Friday quit his job as chief spokesman for Merrill
Lynch & Co. because of the uproar over the phony quotes, which he
wrote about in his new book, ``Speaking Out.''
   On Tuesday, he also offered a limited apology for some of the
characterizations in the book.
   ``I apologize not for the truth in my book _ nor the telling of
it,'' he said. ``The truth never requires apology. I do regret that
I have overstepped the bounds of propriety in some instances. It is
for that I apologize.''
   Speakes revealed in his book that on two occasions he had
attributed quotes to Reagan that the president never spoke. In one
instance, the quotes were drafted in the press office, and in
another, they had been spoken by Secretary of State George P.
Shultz.
   The book also contains Speakes' blunt assessments of people in
the White House and members of the press who cover the president.
   ``In some cases, I did overstep the bounds of common decency,
and, yes, courtesy,'' Speakes said. ``I have needlessly criticized
many whose professionalism I respect.''

   Five tumultuous decades have passed since
Jerry Daniels last appeared with the Ink Spots and swing music has
given way to punk rock, but Daniels showed some things never change.
   Daniels, the last surviving member of the original Ink Spots
singing group of the 1930s and 1940s, stepped again into the
limelight at the Indiana Roof Ballroom on Monday night to harmonize
with the current touring group.
   ``We're kinda like the Yankees,'' said the 72-year-old Daniels.
``We just keep changing the players around.''
   The group originated in Indianapolis in 1930, playing on street

   Her husband's biography is a best-seller and
they've both got multiple millions in the bank, but Ivana Trump
apparently hasn't left motherhood behind in life's fast lane.
   Mrs. Trump was among seven women honored Tuesday by the National
Mother's Day Committee for ``contributions to the role of
contemporary motherhood.''
   Mrs. Trump, who helps her husband, Donald, run a real estate
empire, said they repeatedly emphasize to their three children,
``No smoking, no drugs, no alcohol. Don't cheat and steal and lie.''
   The other winners were opera singer Regina Resnick; Rep.

   Cedars-Sinai Medical Center is living up to
its name ``hospital to the stars.'' It's treating rocker Eddie Van
Halen, actor James Garner, comic Sid Caesar and comedian Morey
Amsterdam.
   Garner, 60, and Van Halen, 33, entered the hospital on Monday,
while Caesar, 66, and Amsterdam, 76, have been hospitalized several
days, Ron Wise, spokesman at Cedars-Sinai, said Tuesday.
   None was suffering from life-threatening ailments.
   Van Halen had recently returned from Fiji when he was stricken
by a tropical virus, said his publicist Elliot Sekular. He was
expected to be released this week.
   Amsterdam, best known as Buddy on ``The Dick Van Dyke Show,''
had blood clots removed from each leg and is ``doing very well,''
said Wise.
   Caesar, who had hernia surgery two weeks ago, was being treated
for a staph infection and was also ``doing quite well,'' Wise said,
while Garner was undergoing a series of tests prior to heart
surgery Thursday for an aneurysm.

   Actor Lloyd Bridges, a goodwill
ambassador for CARE International, is spending a week here for a
tour of drought relief and development projects in eastern and
central Ethiopia.
   CARE distributes food to about 300,000 people in eastern
Hararghe province, where it also has various development projects.
In Northern Shoa, central Ethiopia, it helps provide relief food
for an estimated 100,000 people in conjunction with the Baptist
Mission of Ethiopia.
   The drought victims are among 7 million Ethiopians needing help
this year after massive crop failures in 1987. More than 3 million
are in northern Ethiopia, where drought relief operations have been
crippled by civil war.
   Bridges, who arrived Tuesday, is scheduled to leave April 26.

   A judge has refused to dismiss a lawsuit
brought by comedian Joan Rivers against a magazine writer, saying
``there are people who enjoy a good reputation even if they are
caustic and insulting'' on stage.
   Miss Rivers sued writer Ben Stein for $50 million after
Gentlemen's Quarterly magazine ran an article saying she wished her
husband dead before his suicide.
   Superior Court Judge Kurt Lewin on Tuesday denied a request by
Stein to have the case dismissed, but did dismiss Miss Rivers'
separate claim for emotional distress.
   Stein's attorney, Martin Singer, told Lewin that Miss Rivers was
known for callous remarks such as those in the article and had made
jokes about her husband before the article appeared.
   The judge, however, said Miss Rivers' brand of humor does not
prevent her from being libeled because ``there are people who enjoy
a good reputation even if they are caustic and insulting (on
stage).''

   The mystery of Cecil Beaton's missing
portrait of Audrey Hepburn has been solved.
   Twenty-five years ago, when Beaton, the famed British
photographer and designer, was creating costumes for the film ``My
Fair Lady,'' he painted a portrait of Miss Hepburn in her role as
the flower seller.
   The painting was meant to be a gift to the director, George
Cukor.
   ``But Cukor and Beaton had a falling out,'' explained Max
Bercutt, then publicity chief at Warner Bros.
   ``The dancer, Rudolf Nureyev, was supposed to stay at Cukor's
house and stayed at Beaton's instead. George got miffed, and Beaton
decided to give the portrait to me,'' said Bercutt, who planned to
auction the painting today.

<HEAD>Bush Predicts He'll Face Dukakis In The Fall _ And Win</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Vice President George Bush predicts the winner
of the New York Democratic primary, Michael Dukakis, will go on to
win his party's nomination and face him in the fall general
election.
   At the same time, Bush rejected as ``invalid liberal trash''
suggestions that his acceptance of support from former Philadelphia
Mayor Frank Rizzo might send the wrong signal to blacks and other
minorities in November.
   ``Are you suggesting you only appear with civil rights
leaders?'' Bush asked reporters.
   He made the comments aboard Air Force Two late Tuesday as he
returned from a campaign stop in Philadelphia, where he shared the
stage at a Republican rally with Rizzo. Pennsylvania's primary is
Tuesday.
   Bush said he had no hesitation in appearing with Rizzo, a former
Democrat who is his Philadelphia campaign chairman. To not do so,
Bush said, would be ``a policy of exclusion. I don't do that.''
   The vice president, who has the Republican nomination
essentially locked up, said it was a ``good bet'' that the New York
primary victor would be the Democratic candidate.
   ``I do think that whoever wins this (New York primary) tonight,
and this is my personal opinion, will get an awful lot of delegates
and win the nomination.''
   Bush said he did not intend to criticize Dukakis right away. ``I
think I'll keep it generic until the convention,'' he said.
   But he referred to Dukakis as ``an old-world liberal Democrat.''
   Bush also defended his decision to campaign in Ohio and
Pennsylvania on Monday and Tuesday, rather than remaining in
Washington because of the Persian Gulf crisis. ``There was no
action required, no decisons on which to advise ... If there had
been an important meeting, I would have been there.''
   On the subject of Rizzo, Bush conceded that some blacks unhappy
with Rizzo's tenures as Philadelphia's police chief and then as
mayor might react negatively to his role in the Bush campaign.
   But the vice president said he intended to reach out to a
variety of ethnic groups and to speak in ``ethnic communities.''
   ``My God, to say that we've got to show that I care about civil
rights and human rights in reaching out to others, that I have to
then turn my back on ethnic neighborhoods and values and
individuals that are strong in those areas, I'm not going to do
that. That's reverse discrimination.''
   Bush said that by ``ethnic neighorhoods'' he was generally
speaking about minorities other than blacks. He cited
``Lithuanians, the Polish church we're talking about, these ethnic
wards in Chicago.
   ``And to suggest you have to write all those off to show your
civil rights (credentials), to the exclusion of other minorities, I
reject that as a liberal point of view that I just don't conceive
has any validity whatsoever.
   ``What signals have I sent? I've sent a signal that I want the
vote of people in these ethnic communities who believe in the same
things that I do and that our party does, in terms of the
importance of neighborhood, family, faith, freedom, that's the
message I'm sending.''
   Bush said that Rizzo had lost in his most recent attempt to be
re-elected mayor, as a Republican, by a slim 9,000-vote margin.
   ``And to suggest that I should not appear with him because I'm
worried that that will hurt me in some other areas, I'm sorry I
don't (buy) that. I reject it as invalid liberal trash.
   ``Are you suggesting that 49.5 percent of the people in
Philadelphia are racist because they vote for a man who had been
mayor of the city and who was campaigining on things that appealed
to them? It's unfair and it is outrageous,'' Bush told reporters.
   Earlier, with Rizzo at his side, Bush told the GOP rally in
Philadelphia: ``I want to take on whichever one of those Democrats
wins today in New York _ and whip them in the fall.''
   Bush wound up a two-day campaign swing through Ohio and
Pennsylvania. He planned to spend the rest of the week in
Washington.

<HEAD>Dukakis Says He Won't Resign as Governor Until Presidential
Inaugural</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER B. DALY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Michael Dukakis says he will not resign as
governor of Massachusetts if he wins the Democratic presidential
nomination in July or even in November if he should win the general
election.
   ``I'll wait until I'm sworn in,'' Dukakis told reporters on
Tuesday.
   Since he formally announced his presidential candidacy a year
ago, Dukakis has insisted he could serve as governor and run a
nationwide campaign.
   Until Tuesday, he had never explained the circumstances under
which he would surrender his office.
   At a statehouse news briefing, Dukakis was asked whether he
would resign if he wins the Democratic nomination, in order to
devote his full time to the presidential campaign.
   ``We've never expected that of our candidates. Nobody asked John
Kennedy to resign from the Senate. Nobody has asked George Bush to
resign the vice presidency,'' Dukakis said.
   ``As a matter of fact, I think it's a strength of mine that I'm
an active, working governor at the same time I'm running for the
presidency. I see that every day,'' he said. ``I will not give up
the governorship. I will continue to be an active governor, as I
have in the course of the primary campaign.''
   Dukakis, who is in his tenth year as governor, rejected ``the
notion that you've got to be unemployed to run for the presidency''
and said there were no circumstances under which he would resign
before a presidential inaugural.
   His statement may come as a disappointment to Lt. Gov. Evelyn
Murphy. Under the state constitution, she would automatically
become governor if there is a vacancy in the governorship.
   If she ascends to the governorship through Dukakis' good
fortunes, Murphy could gain enough stature and political strength
to win election outright in 1990.
   Dukakis is the first sitting governor to campaign for the White
House since California Gov. Edmund Brown Jr. jumped into the 1976
primaries. The last sitting governor to win the presidency was
Democrat Franklin D. Roosevelt of New York in 1932.
   For the past year, Dukakis has generally spent about half of his
time in the state and the remainder on the campaign trail.

   Sponsors of a bill strengthening the ban on
selling weapons to terrorist countries say the measure would
clarify which weapons and countries are affected while making the
president more accountable to Congress.
   The House Foreign Affairs Committee on Tuesday easily approved
the legislation, which would also impose civil and criminal
penalties on violators. The bill was prompted in part by the
Iran-Contra affair.
   One of the sponsors, Reps. Howard Berman, D-Calif., said the
original ban on selling weapons to nations identified as supporting
international terrorism had been passed in 1986 as an amendment to
the Arms Export Control Act.
   But that prohibition was almost immediately trampled by the
administration's sale of antitank missiles to Iran in hopes of
winning release of American hostages, he said. Iran is on the State
Department's list of countries supporting terrorism.
   The president failed to give Congress the required notification
for such shipments, Berman said.
   ``Over the years federal law has become riddled with overlapping
standards that can lead to confusion and misuse,'' Berman said in a
statement. It remains unclear how to judge under the law whether a
country supports terrorism, which arms are restricted and when the
president can waive the law's restrictions, he said.
   Co-sponsor Henry Hyde, R-Ill., said consultations with the
administration were continuing to further modify the bill in a way
that would permit the president to waive parts of the act in
emergencies. That matter remained to be settled before the bill can
go to the full House for action, he said.
   No Republican member of the committee spoke up against it on
Tuesday, and the bill passed on a voice vote.

   A scholar who pushed for release of
the Robert Kennedy assassination files says the newly disclosed
destruction of 2,410 evidence photographs is ``deeply suspicious''
and should be investigated.
   Greg Stone, a University of Wisconsin political scientist who
has devoted years to studying the assassination, said he was
shocked that Tuesday's opening of the files also brought word of
destroyed evidence.
   ``Far and away, the blinding central fact in this event is the
unbelievable destruction of these photographs,'' said Stone. ``That
is an outrage and an insult to the American public. ... This
performance (by the Los Angeles police) would be a disgrace in a
routine auto accident.''
   ``This is deeply suspicious,'' he added.
   Stone's comments came after California Secretary of State March
Fong Eu opened the long-secret files to the public and displayed
significant items of evidence for reporters. She held aloft a boxed
.22-caliber gun used by convicted assassin Sirhan Sirhan to kill
the U.S. senator on June 5, 1968, after his victory in the
California Democratic presidential primary.
   Among the documents displayed was a certificate showing that
2,410 police photographs in the assassination case were burned on
Aug. 21, 1968.
   The state's chief archivist, John Burns, who cataloged the
massive file for release, speculated that the destroyed photos
could have been duplicates, but said the files contain no such
statement.
   Less surprising, said Stone, was confirmation that police also
destroyed door jambs and ceiling tiles from the kitchen of the Los
Angeles Ambassador Hotel where Kennedy was gunned down. Stone and
other experts maintain those items might have shed light on how
many bullets were fired and on a theory there was a second gunman.
   ``The Los Angeles Police Commission should investigate this,''
he said, referring to a civilian oversight board appointed by the
mayor. ``Mayor (Tom) Bradley should demand it.''
   Asked why he thought the material was destroyed, Stone said,
``The most charitable interpretation is total ineptitude. ... But
you can't rule out suspicious and sinister possibilities.''
   Stone once worked for Rep. Allard Lowenstein, D-N.Y., who raised
questions about the case before he, too, was slain by a gunman in
1980.
   William Booth, a Los Angeles Police Department spokesman, said
he didn't know why the photographs and other materials were
destroyed.
   ``It was 20 years ago and I certainly don't have any independent
recollection,'' Booth said. ``I don't know whether what was done
here is routine or not because I don't know what was done here.''
   Sirhan, a Jordanian immigrant who scribbled in his diary, ``RFK
must die,'' is serving a life term at Soledad prison. Sirhan says
he was the lone assassin but can't remember shooting Kennedy. He
blames his amnesia on alcohol.
   The material released on microfilm Tuesday details interviews
with 4,000 witnesses, including dozens of eyewitnesses, and
comprises 50,000 pages.
   Eu also released a police composite videotape of the
assassination scene. Kennedy is seen entering the kitchen
surrounded by a large crowd. Screams are heard. The badly jostled
camera then shows Kennedy lying in a pool of blood while other
victims stagger about dazed and witnesses are seen weeping.
   The assassination occurred before presidential candidates were
provided with Secret Service protection.
   Also released was a tape of police calls on the night of the
assassination, showing there was a delay in sending police cars and
an ambulance to the scene because the officer on duty didn't grasp
the importance of what had happened.
   Told that there was an emergency at the Ambassador Hotel and
that Kennedy was there, the unidentified police officer responded:
``Big deal!''
   After being told by a hotel employee that Kennedy had been shot,
the officer asked her for the address, apparently unaware of the
location of the one of Los Angeles' largest hotels.
   Documents show that once Kennedy was inside an ambulance, the
senator's distressed wife, Ethel, demanded that attendants keep
their hands off Kennedy.
   One doctor who attended Kennedy in the kitchen complained about
Kennedy being taken to Good Samaritan Hospital, a central receiving
hospital, rather than a private facility with specialists in brain
injuries. But another doctor said it was wise to choose Good
Samaritan, which was only three blocks from the Ambassador.
   A large portion of the newly released police interviews focused
on the allegation that a girl in a polka dot dress was seen with
Sirhan at the hotel and ran away from the assassination scene
shouting, ``We shot him.''
   The report was never verified, but the files show that many
witnesses claimed to have seen a woman with Sirhan that night and
one described a white dress with black or deep violet dots.

<HEAD>Dukakis' Weakness In New York Primary Contest: the Black Vote</HEAD>

   Michael Dukakis won white votes across the board
in New York's presidential primary, and pollsters say a sizable
share of the one group he lost _ blacks _ likely would back him as
the Democratic nominee.
   While exit polls Tuesday found soft spots in Dukakis' support,
overall, ``They love him here,'' said CBS News pollster Kathleen A.
Frankovic. Three quarters of the state's Democrats viewed Dukakis
favorably, she noted.
   Still, ``There are weaknesses. Of course there are weaknesses,''
she said. ``This is a not a candidate who has gotten a lot of black
votes.''
   Indeed, roughly 95 percent of black voters went for Jesse
Jackson, and an NBC News exit poll said a third of the black
Democrats held an unfavorable view of Dukakis, to 27 percent
favorable and 40 percent unsure.
   Moreover, 44 percent of the blacks told NBC that Dukakis does
not care about people like them, while just 19 percent said he did
care. ``That is certainly not helpful to him,'' said NBC pollster
Mary Klett.
   But while Klett said Dukakis, if he were the nominee, may have
trouble drawing blacks to the polls, other analysts said the
problem may not be so great. In an ABC News-Washington Post poll,
65 percent of Jackson voters said they would support Dukakis
against Republican George Bush in November.
   ``Jackson voters are much more loyal Democrats,'' said ABC News
pollster Doug Muzzio. By contrast, he said, half the Dukakis voters
would favor Bush in a Jackson-Bush contest, and only 22 percent
would support Jackson.
   In both the ABC and NBC polls just over 25 percent of Jackson
voters said they would not vote in a Dukakis-Bush contest. ``But
that may not point ahead to November,'' Frankovic said, because the
single-candidate fervor of those Jackson voters may fade. Also,
Dukakis has not campaigned actively for the black vote, essentially
ceding it to Jackson in the contests thus far.
   Estimates of the black turnout varied. The ABC-Post poll put it
at 27 percent, up from 19 percent in 1984, but the CBS-Times poll
said it was 22 percent, precisely the same as that poll's 1984
figure.
   In any case, the electorate clearly was polarized. Jackson won
just about 15 percent of the white vote, and slightly more _ 22
percent in the ABC-Post poll _ of the non-Jewish white vote. About
80 percent of Jews and 70 percent of white Catholics supported
Dukakis. Each group was a quarter of the total.
   ``When you look at white voters he's got over 60 percent in all
income groups, over two-thirds in all education groups. He's got
majorities of all ages, majorities of religions,'' ABC's Muzzio
said. ``In this bifurcated electorate, he wins substantial and in
some cases overwhelming majorities.''
   But the Dukakis support was grudging in some cases. In the NBC
poll 57 percent of Dukakis' voters said they would like Gov. Mario
Cuomo to be the nominee, and more than half said they wished
someone else were running. In the CBS-Times poll, 72 percent of
Dukakis voters said they would have voted for Cuomo had he been in
the race.
   ``His support is really sort of mush,'' Klett said of Dukakis.
``It's not really a strong thing.''
   The ABC-Post poll found a measure of ``negative voting'' in the
Dukakis support. About a fifth of the Democrats said they were
voting to stop a candidate from winning rather than to help a
candidate they liked, and three-quarters of those negative voters
went for Dukakis, Muzzio said.
   The racial and religious antipathy showed in Los Angeles Times
exit poll, in which nearly two-thirds of Democrats said they
believed there was ``an element of racism involved in the vote
against Jackson,'' and about another third said they believed
Jackson is anti-Semitic.
   ``This election was very polarized,'' Klett said. ``Jackson
supporters are there; they were with him a month ago, and they're
still there. What's going to happen in the fall is something
Dukakis is going to have to face.''

<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis' landslide in New York makes him
the undisputed front-runner in the Democratic presidential race and
raises the prospect of a unified, peaceful, broker-free nominating
convention that seemed wildly improbable a few weeks ago.
   Jesse Jackson will press on with his remarkable campaign, but
his slim chance of derailing Dukakis now grows slimmer with each
passing week, particularly if Sen. Albert Gore Jr. halts his
campaign as expected on Thursday.
   ``The Democratic Party's going to be unified and we're going to
stop George Bush this November,'' said Gore on what must have been
the most disappointing night of his campaign. Jackson has said he
wants to ``enable our party to win'' and is determined to ``play a
role in making that happen.''
   Pennsylvania votes next week, and Ohio and Indiana after that,
and none of them offers the large core of black votes that gives
Jackson a secure base from which to spring an upset.
   Gore's campaign suspension after a distant third-place finish in
New York would mean Dukakis no longer had to divide the white vote
with another white candidate.
   The District of Columbia will be Jackson's on May 3. But it
could well be his last victory, barring a late-season protest vote
against a cautious front-runner _ always a California possibility
for the Democrats.
   But the other primaries ahead offer Dukakis a chance to pad the
lead he has begun amassing in nominating delegates.
   Dukakis knows as much, too, even though he points out the
nominating campaign will be contested until the last primary on
June 7. Even as New York was according him his front-runner status
he was making a sharp attack on Bush in the manner of a candidate
who expects to be the nominee.
   ``This fall George Bush is going to be judged by a legacy of ...
pink slips for our workers, golden parachutes for high rollers, and
greenmail for sharp operators on Wall Street,'' he said in
Philadelphia.
   ``I want to make that American dream come alive again, not only
in Trump Towers, not only in fancy apartments all over this
country, not only in a few privileged neighborhoods.''
   Dukakis has managed to achieve his supremacy in the race without
relying on the traditional Democratic party power brokers. The
AFL-CIO hasn't endorsed him or any other Democrat, and Dukakis
managed to pull off his double-digit New York victory without the
endorsement of Gov. Mario Cuomo.
   Gore almost certainly will exit the campaign preaching party
unity, as he did when he congratulated Dukakis in a New York
concession speech.
   And he won't be the only one talking that way.
   Neither Dukakis nor Jackson has shown much penchant for
criticizing the other, and any campaign debate is likely to be long
on Bush-bashing and short on Democratic bickering.
   ``We respect each other. We don't attack each other,'' Dukakis
said. ``You won't see either one of us attempting to hurt or cut up
or otherwise cripple the opponent's campaign.''
   Still, Jackson has the most potential for creating mischief at
the Democratic National Convention this year, and the question most
likely to be asked from now to the opening of the convention on
July 18 is ``What does Jesse want?''
   So far, his principal answer to that question has been to stress
his determination to elect a Democrat the next president.
   When a questioner at a New York breakfast asked Jackson what he
would do if he didn't get the nomination, he replied that it was
important to ``put the nation first and party second and your role
third.''
   And so far, not one word about wanting to be vice president, a
prospect that sends terror through the Democratic party
establishment.
   That's the sort of behavior could make the Democratic convention
very peaceful indeed.
   Democrats are eager to put their nominating war behind them as
soon as reasonably possible without offending Jackson and the
millions of black voters who have joined his crusade.
   Peter D. Kelly, chairman of the California Democratic Party,
said many of the elected and party officials, designated as ``super
delegates'' to the nominating convention, may be reluctant to jump
too quickly onto the Dukakis bandwagon.
   ``They're going to want to be real careful about angering Jesse
Jackson and his supporters,'' said Kelly. ``I, for one, am very
sensitive about offending that constituency.''
   Dukakis is unlikely to put any pressure on Jackson.
   Instead, he will turn his attention to the upcoming primary
states and to the task of enlisting the uncommitted elected
officials, party leaders and uncommitted delegates to his cause.
That will enable him to arrive at the nominating convention in
Atlanta with the delegates needed to be nominated.

<TEXT>
   Moslem hijackers on Wednesday freed
their hostages from a Kuwaiti jet after saying that Algeria had
offered a solution to the 15-day ordeal in which two people were
killed and dozens terrorized.
   Algerian officials said the hostages were whisked out of the
plane before the hostages were released. They would not say where
they were taken.
   Interior Minister Hedi Khediri, announcing the release, said the
blue and white Boeing 747 would be returned to Kuwait.
   He said earlier: ``A solution settling all the issues of the
hijacking has just been reached.'' He refused to give any details
of the agreement.
   Two women wearing black veils, distant cousins of the emir of
Kuwait, were the first to descend the gangway at 6 a.m. (1 a.m.
EDT). They were escorted into a car and taken to a hospital along
with a third member of the Kuwaiti royal family, who apparently was
suffering from a nervous disorder, according to Dr. Youssef Mahdi,
who had previously tended to the sick on board.
   The rest of the 24 passengers then filed off the aircraft and
got into a white bus which took them to the airport VIP lounge.
They looked haggard and dazed, but waved to reporters lining the
tarmac.
   The seven-member crew of the Kuwaiti Airways Boeing 747 were
driven to the lounge in cars. Originally it had been thought there
were about 35 passengers and crew, but the exact number was not
known until the release.
   ``I can't describe how I feel to be free. We lived through a
16-day nightmare. It's incredible that it's over,'' said Mubarek
Abdelazziz El-Zeherran, 23, a Saudi student.
   Kuwaiti student Youssef Al-Angeri, 24, said, ``We lived in fear.
We were very frayed. We had lost hope that it would turn out this
way.''
   Algerian officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
hijackers left the plane 20 minutes before the hostages were
brought out. They were taken away in unmarked automobiles,
according to the officials, who would not reveal their location.
   An hour after the release, the door to the plane remained open
with security officials and others milling about.
   The gunmen had demanded that Kuwait release 17 pro-Iranian
terrorists convicted of the 1983 bombings of the U.S. and French
embassies, which Kuwait had refused to do.
   The hostages had been tied up and forced to keep silent while
aboard the Kuwait Airways jet, which was commandeered on a
Bangkok-Kuwait flight and flown to Iran, Cyprus and Algeria during
long days of tense negotiations.
   In a statement issued in Arabic at 4 a.m. Wednesday (11 p.m. EDT
Tuesday), the gunmen thanked Algeria for its help ``in the case of
the brothers in Kuwait and their help in other humanitarian and
Moslem causes.''
   The statement continued: ``We declare to the Moslem people and
people who seek freedom that today, on the third day of Ramadan, we
will end the Kuwaiti airplane operation, giving our best regards to
the Kuwaiti people.''
   Ramadan, the Moslem holy month, started in Algeria on Monday.
   ``We salute the offer made by the Algerian government,'' the
hijackers said in the statement over the airliner's radio.
   The gunmen praised the Palestinian uprising in the
Israeli-occupied territories and denounced U.S. Secretary of State
George P. Shultz's attempts to start Middle East peace talks,
saying: ``There is no solution but to get rid of Israel.''
   The statement from the hijackers was preceded by a flurry of
activity beginning at 3 a.m. (10 p.m. EDT Tuesday) when Algerian
mediators used radio to contact the aircraft, dubbed by the gunmen
the `plane of martyrdom.''
   The pace of Algeria's mediation effort had appeared to step up
Tuesday, when a mediator made at least five visits to the plane.
Algerian officials had refrained from beaming a spotlight on the
aircraft as it had done on previous nights.
   Earlier Tuesday, one of the members of the Kuwaiti royal family
held hostage said the captives ``are all in danger'' if her kin did
not meet the demands of the Shiite Moslem gunmen.
   ``We want you to tell our families that my sister and I and all
the passengers are well, although our morale is low and Fadel is
naturally deteriorating,'' said Anware Al-Sabah via radio in a
tense but firm voice, referring to her brother, Fadel Khaled
Al-Sabah and her 22-year-old sister, Ibtesam.
   It was the fifth time since the plane landed in Algiers on April
13 that the hijackers broadcast appeals for the Kuwait government
to release the 17 pro-Iranian prisoners.
   The gunmen hijacked the plane on April 5 with 112 people aboard.
   The aircraft landed at Houari Boumedienne Airport following five
days in Cyprus and three in Mashhad, in northeast Iran.
   A former Algerian prime minister, Mohamed Abdel Ghani, was seen
at the foot of the gangway of the plane Tuesday in intense
discussion with one mediator.
   Algerian authorities had radioed the cockpit to say a ``very
important person wants to see you before you make your
declaration.'' It was not clear whether the former Algerian
official was the person.
   The start of Ramadan drew speculation that the hijackers, in
deference to the holy month, could show some flexibility.

<HEAD>Mingo Sheriffs Sentenced For Selling, Buying Job</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Two former sheriffs of a mountain coal
mining county received prison terms of up to 10 years for a scheme
in which one sold his job to the other for $100,000.
   Former Mingo County Democratic chairman Johnie Owens, who has
admitted selling his job as sheriff in 1982, sentenced Tuesday to
one to five years in prison and fined $20,000 on state charges of
conspiracy and tax evasion.
   The sentences will run concurrently with a 14-year sentence
Owens received Monday on related federal charges.
   Eddie Hilbert, 45, who has said he gave Owens a $20,000 down
payment for the job, was sentenced Tuesday to one to 10 years in
prison for bribery.
   Circuit Judge Dan O'Hanlon also placed the two on five years'
probation and ordered them to pay as-yet undetermined costs of the
special grand jury investigation of their case.
   Hilbert pleaded guilty to related federal charges Monday and is
scheduled for sentencing June 16.
   West Virginia law prescribes specific sentences for each crime.
Only a parole board can shorten a sentence after a convict serves
the minimum term.
   The county, known historically as the site of the Hatfield-McCoy
feud, is at the center of a two-year political corruption and drug
trafficking investigation in which nearly 50 officials have been
charged.

   Residents began rebuilding their lives and
town today after Florida's worst tornado in two decades killed four
people and left millions of dollars in damage. A college was ruined
but its 2,000 students were spared.
   ``Thankfully, it happened when it did and not four or five hours
later because the death toll would probably have been in the
hundreds,'' said William H. McCoy, president of North Florida
Community College.
   The tornado struck at 4:30 a.m. Tuesday, tossing families out of
bed while windows exploded and their homes collapsed on them. It
left 18 people injured and a 12-mile-long, half-mile-wide path of
destruction in which 17 homes were destroyed, authorities said.
   Gov. Bob Martinez, after assessing the damage in a helicopter,
declared a state of emergency, paving the way for state agencies to
assist Madison County in cleanup efforts.
   ``I haven't seen one of these since one came through my hometown
(Tampa) back in 1966 or 1967,'' the governor said. The tornado was
Florida's worst since one crossed the state from Clearwater to Cape
Kennedy in 1966, killing 11 and injuring 400 people.
   Gordon Guthrie, director of the state's Division of Emergency
Management, said his agency would complete a detailed damage
assessment today, possibly leading to federal aid.
   The tornado was one of four that struck Florida in stormy
weather Tuesday, destroying several homes elsewhere and heavily
damaging others. Twisters also struck Colorado, North Carolina and
California, although no major damage was reported.
   In Madison, only rubble was left in some neighborhoods and the
mobile home of two of those killed vanished from its lot, leaving
only foundation blocks, authorities said.
   ``I woke up with a roaring sound and as soon as I woke up, the
windows blew out on both sides of my bed, and the roof came down on
top of me,'' said Mitchell May, who was pinned in the debris for
three hours.
   Twelve of the junior college's 14 major buildings were heavily
damaged and at least three were destroyed, said McCoy, who
estimated damage to the campus at between $20 million and $25
million.
   Among the buildings destroyed was a new regional library, which
had not yet opened, that was to serve the college and county public
schools, and the campus chapel and a fine arts building.
   State Insurance Commissioner Bill Gunter, who toured the area,
said the campus buildings would be covered by a state insurance
pool as well as with federal funds.
   The four county residents killed included Lavelle and Robert
McCullough, both in their 60s, whose bodies were found 100 yards
from their vanished mobile home several miles northeast of town.
McCullough was scheduled to retire next January from his
maintenance job at the college.
   ``I think people of course are sad about the destruction of
buildings. They are sadder about the death of Bob McCullough, a
very valuable employee,'' McCoy said. He hoped classes would resume
Monday.
   Also killed were Walter Oliver Jr., 39, and Dearmiste Pinesett,
41, said sheriff's spokesman Juan Botino.
   Eighteen people were injured and two of the more seriously hurt
were flown 50 miles to Tallahassee, said Jeannie Baker,
administrator of Madison County Memorial Hospital. Only two
remained in the hospital and were in good condition, she said.
   At Tallahassee Memorial Regional Medical Center, Brad Williams,
14, was in serious condition after surgery for a punctured kidney
and Mary Kay Smith was in fair condition with a chest injury, said
hospital spokesman Ron Brafford.
   The Red Cross surveyed residential damage and found 30 homes
damaged and 17 destroyed, said Chris Floyd, damage assessment
coordinator.

   The dollar finished lower Wednesday against the
Japanese yen in Tokyo, while stock prices posted a substantial gain.
   The dollar finished the day at 123.90 yen, down 0.47 yen from
its close of 124.37 yen Tuesday. It had opened the day at 124.08
yen and fluctuated between 123.85 yen and 124.09 yen.
   Traders said selling pressure pushed the dollar below the
124.00-yen level at one point during the trading, but the currency
later rose on modest intervention by the Bank of Japan.
   The central bank does not officially comment on its market
activity.
   An exchange dealer at a major commercial bank said some market
participants were taking a cautious attitude toward the dollar in
fear that U.S. monetary authorities would tighten credit in case of
higher-than-expected U.S. consumer price figures for March, which
were scheduled to be announced Wednesday in Washington.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average,
a modest 14.45-point loser Tuesday, gained 207.09 points, or 0.77
percent, closing the day at 26,864.09.
   ``Domestically, there is nothing to cause uneasiness among
investors, such as the possibility of restriction of margin
transactions,'' said Hiromi Yoneyama of Wako Securities.

   An ear infection almost kept Capt.
Kenneth W. Hill out of the Marines, his father recalled as he and
relatives of a fellow helicopter crewman lost during fighting with
Iran awaited word on their fate.
   But Hill persisted, persuading recruiters in 1981 to help him
avoid an honorable discharge for medical reasons. The following
year, he was appointed to Marine officers' training school and
realized his dream of being a pilot.
   ``He's just a good Marine,'' Robert Hill said Tuesday of his
33-year-old son. ``I know because he told me so. He was proud. He's
over there because that's his job. He said they were well-manned,
well-trained, and he was confident they could handle what they were
doing.''
   Iran says it shot down the Marine Cobra attack gunship, part of
a squadron flown by Hill and Capt. Stephen C. Leslie, 30, of New
Bern, during heavy fighting Monday.
   But the Pentagon said Hill and Leslie had been sent out on a
``standard patrol sweep,'' and that there was no evidence to
suggest the missing gunship had ever come under fire.
   Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci refused to speculate about the
aircraft's fate as U.S. Navy ships and planes continued to search
for the helicopter over the central gulf.
   Meanwhile, four wounded sailors from the U.S. frigate Samuel B.
Roberts remained in serious but stable condition and were expected
to be transferred to hospitals in the United States today, the Navy
said.
   The ship was damaged in a Persian Gulf mine blast last week that
was cited by U.S. officials as justification for Monday's attack on
two Iranian oil platforms.
   After Marine officials telephoned the Hills about 9:30 p.m.
Monday, the family has had little sleep.
   ``I laid down sometime last night,'' Robert Hill said Tuesday,
``but I've known every hour of the day. My wife never went to bed.
I know she didn't sleep because I heard her in here wiping down the
walls last night.''
   Leslie's younger sister, Kris Leslie, said her family received
word around midnight Monday that her brother was listed as missing.
She said the family had received no details since.
   ``We're very numb right now,'' Ms. Leslie said.
   Leslie and his wife, Lisa, live in Jacksonville, N.C., where
Leslie and Hill are stationed at New River Air Station. He has been
in the Persian Gulf area since the end of January, Ms. Leslie said.
   On Tuesday, Robert Hill and his wife, Mary, clung to hope as
they waited with family and friends for word of their son.
   The Pentagon ``said he was on the American side,'' Hill
recalled. ``They said they don't think there's a possibility of the
Iranians picking him up. They don't believe they were shot down.
The water is warm and it's shallow _ as compared to the ocean, I
guess.''
   Darrell Leonard, 30, a boyhood friend, said Hill was desperate
to get the Marines to reconsider his inner ear problem and allow
him to become a helicopter pilot.
   ``He was a fanatic when it came to flying,'' Leonard said. ``We
would talk for hours. He liked the idea of flying low and flying
fast.''
   Robert Hill said he has no regrets about the Marine Corps'
decision to keep his son, the oldest of three boys.
   ``This is what he wanted to do,'' Robert Hill said. ``This is
his life.''

<HEAD>Red Cross Suspends Blood Processing, Fires Director In Nashville</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The American Red Cross has suspended
processing of blood at its regional center here and fired the
administrator, two months after blood that failed AIDS screening
procedures was distributed.
   The Nashville chapter, which serves 100 hospitals in 90 counties
in central Tennessee, western Kentucky and parts of Illinois and
Missouri, also announced Tuesday plans to retrain its technical
staff on new equipment.
   In the meantime, ``blood donations to the Nashville region will
be processed by other Red Cross regional facilities,'' said Dr. S.
Gerald Sandler, associate vice president for blood services at
national headquarters in Washington, D.C.
   Chapter Chairman Max Haught said the board of directors voted
Monday to relieve Dr. Kenneth Fawcett of his duties as director of
blood services for the Tennessee Valley Region.
   Neither Haught nor chapter manager Christopher Parker would
discuss the reasons for the dismissal.
   Sandler said that based on an evaluation of Fawcett's
performance, American Red Cross president Richard Schubert withdrew
his approval for Fawcett's continued appointment. The national
headquarters took control of the program and brought in a doctor
from Wisconsin to supervise the laboratory.
   Fawcett said he is displeased and plans a news conference later
this week to discuss his dismissal.
   In March, the American Red Cross acknowledged it had distributed
24 pints of blood that had failed procedures against AIDS
contamination or carried hepatitis B antigens, but said none was
used and none actually carried the AIDS virus.
   The federal Food and Drug Administration, which released a
report on the matter last month, said the blood was shipped to
hospitals and laboratories by Red Cross centers in Washington,
D.C., and Nashville.
   Initial tests showed that 10 of the units contained AIDS
antibodies, but those units underwent a process that breaks the
blood into components for specific uses and eliminates the virus,
the Red Cross said.
   Other units were from donors who were unacceptable because they
previously tested ``false positive'' for the AIDS virus, but all
the units later tested as safe, officials said.
   Parker said about 20 Red Cross technicians in Nashville will be
retrained so that each knows how to use all new equipment the
center has acquired, including computers to manage data and a
chemical analyzer that tests blood for the AIDS virus.
   ``The laboratory is perfectly capable of testing blood and
delivering blood safely,'' Sandler said of the Nashville center.
``But they are not capable of doing that and having retraining at
the same time.''

<HEAD>Feds Charge Postal Workers With Fraud In Super Bowl Contest</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VERA HALLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Most of the prize money from a Super Bowl ``Pick
the Score'' contest went to postal workers and their friends who
waited until after the game to submit their entries, using
backdated envelopes, authorities say.
   Fourteen U.S. Postal Service employees and three others were
charged Tuesday with obstructing the mail in separate schemes from
five area post offices, said U.S. Attorney Andrew J. Maloney.
   Seven defendants, including four postal workers, were among the
14 Daily News contest winners and collected $35,000 of the $100,000
in cash prizes, authorities said.
   Two other postal workers split the $50,000 grand prize with its
winner, Judith Febbraro, said U.S. Attorney Andrew J. Maloney.
   Ms. Febbraro, 42, tipped authorities to her fraudulent entry in
February after her romance with one of the postal workers ended,
Maloney said.
   She was not charged, and a portion of her prize money was
recovered, Maloney said.
   The defendants, in separate and unrelated schemes, waited until
after the 1987 Super Bowl and then used their positions or
associations with the post office to mail in numerous entries in
envelopes postmarked before the deadline, Maloney said.
   The workers, who were suspended without pay, were employed at
four post offices in New York City and one in Yonkers.
   Maloney said the first time many of them met was at a dinner for
the winners with quarterback Phil Simms, who led the New York
Giants to a 39-20 victory in the National Football League game.
   ``This newspaper had complete confidence in the integrity of
this contest,'' said Gil Spencer, editor of the Daily News. ``As we
understand it, the only way the contest could have been ripped off
was by a fraud engineered inside the post office by postal
employees, and that's exactly what the Justice Department has
charged.''
   The company that administered the contest for the Daily News _
D.L. Blair, Inc. of Garden City _ received a total of 375,000
entries, Maloney said. The winners were chosen in a random drawing
from the 206 correct responses.
   As part of the investigation, Blair recovered 167 of the entries
with correct scores. At least 107 of those entries were submitted
by postal employees or people closely associated with them,
authorities said.
   Maloney said the scheme was part of an ongoing investigation by
his office and postal inspectors.
   The defendants were charged with obstructing the mail, which
upon conviction carries a maximum five year sentence and a $250,000
fine. Fifteen were arrested Tuesday, two remain at large.

   Here is a chronology of events in the hijacking of Kuwait
Airways Flight 422:
   TUESDAY, April 5 _ The Boeing 747 with 112 people aboard,
including three members of the Kuwaiti royal family, is hijacked by
Arabs on a flight to Kuwait from Bangkok and diverted to Mashhad in
northeastern Iran.
   The hijackers demand freedom for 17 pro-Iranian extremists
jailed in Kuwait for their convictions in the bombings of the U.S.
and French embassies there in 1983. They threaten to blow up the
plane if the demand is not met. Kuwait refuses. One passenger with
heart condition is released. Kuwait asks Iran not to allow the
plane to take off.
   WEDNESDAY, April 6 _ Kuwait sends a team to Iran to negotiate
with the hijackers but vows not to yield to their demands. The
hijackers release 24 women passengers and call a doctor on board to
treat passengers they describe as ``unwell.''
   THURSDAY, April 7 _ The hijackers release 32 more hostages and
again threaten to blow up plane if security forces attempt ``any
threat against the plane.'' The plane is refueled after hijackers
fire on airport security guards and threaten to force the plane to
take off with fuel tanks near empty.
   The gunmen agree to give the prime ministers of Turkey and
Pakistan until early Friday to negotiate with Kuwait to try to end
ordeal.
   FRIDAY, April 8 _ The deadline passes while Turkish and
Pakistani prime ministers negotiate with Kuwaiti officials. The
plane leaves Mashhad but is refused permission to land in Syria and
Lebanon, despite pleas from the pilot who says the fuel tank is
nearly empty. After seven hours in the air, the plane lands at
Larnaca, Cyprus.
   SATURDAY, April 9 _ The hijackers kill a Kuwaiti security guard
on the plane and toss his body onto the tarmac after their demands
for more fuel are not met. The pilot reports that captives are
being beaten. The PLO's deputy director in Cyprus and two Cypriot
officials go to the plane and talk with hijackers. The hijackers
free another captive.
   SUNDAY, April 10 _ Negotiations with PLO officials continue. The
hijackers threaten a ``slow and quiet massacre'' and say they'll
force the pilot to take off and crash into the Kuwaiti royal palace
if demands are not met. Gunmen rip the escape chutes from the
plane, and a message from the cockpit says passengers are being
hurt.
   MONDAY, April 11 _ Hijackers announce they have killed a Kuwaiti
security officer and toss a person onto the tarmac. They say they
want fuel to go to a ``neutral country.'' A passenger tells airport
officials via radio the hijackers have threatened to shoot all the
passengers if the plane is not refueled.
   TUESDAY, April 12 _ Twelve more hostages are freed and plane
flies from Cyprus to Algiers, Algeria.
   WEDNESDAY, April 13 _ Algerian officials begin negotiations
aboard the plane at Algiers airport. Government delegation arrives
from Kuwait.
   THURSDAY, April 14 _ The hijackers free an elderly hostage.
   FRIDAY, April 15 _ Two hostage passengers plead for their lives
via radio, Algerian mediators shuttle between the plane and Kuwait
officials.
   SATURDAY, April 16 _ Hijackers ask Algeria to refuel the jet so
they can fly to another country and kill their hostages. Kuwait
asks Algeria to keep the plane from leaving.
   MONDAY, April 18 _ Fadel Khaled Al-Sabah, a hostage and distant
cousin of the emir of Kuwait, appeals to Kuwait to meet the
hijackers' demands.
   TUESDAY, April 19 _ Another royal cousin, Anware Al-Sabah, says
she and the other hostages are ``in danger'' if the hijackers'
demands are not carried out.
   WEDNESDAY, April 20 _ The gunmen free their captives after
saying, without elaboration, that Algeria has offered a solution to
the ordeal. Officials say the plane will be returned to Kuwait.

   Medical advances have been delayed and
California research centers suffered $5.6 million in damages since
1983 because of theft, vandalism and arson by antivivisectionists,
scientists say.
   ``The public is in jeopardy if biomedical research on animals is
harmed,'' since people benefit from experiments on animals, said
Robert Phalen, whose air pollution laboratory at the University of
California, Irvine, was robbed of 13 beagles in January by what he
termed ``radical criminal elements.''
   ``We're mad as hell and we're not going to take it any more,''
said Raymond Eden, associate dean of medicine at UCLA.
   Phalen, Eden and other scientists spoke Tuesday at a news
conference sponsored by the nonprofit California Biomedical
Research Association, which said seven attacks by
antivivisectionists in California since 1983 caused $5.6 million in
damage and the theft of 627 research animals.
   The researchers said raids on their laboratories damaged,
destroyed or delayed studies aimed at saving the lives of nearly
drowned children and people with sleep disorders, protecting people
from air pollution and fatal diseases and cancers, and preventing
outbreaks of avian flu and other diseases that kill farm animals.
   The news conference was held to counter Laboratory Animal
Liberation Week protests being staged this week around the Los
Angeles area.
   The researchers also accused antivivisectionists of harassing
them and their families, stealing documents, staging photographs of
alleged animal abuse, lying, manipulating public opinion and
forcing research centers to spend money on additional security.
   ``They call people Nazis and claim they are murderers,'' Phalen
said.
   A guard was posted at the news conference to prevent disruption
by about a dozen antivivisectionists who picketed outside with
enlarged photographs showing cats allegedly maimed and killed by
scientists at UCLA and elsewhere.
   ``People wouldn't be breaking into their laboratories if they
weren't committing obscenities,'' Alex Pacheco, chairman of People
for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, said by telephone from the
group's Kensington, Md., headquarters.
   Pacheco defended the laboratory raids as morally justified,
comparing ``terrible and inhumane'' animal experimentation with
mass murder by Nazis, enslavement of U.S. blacks in the 19th
century and apartheid in South Africa.
   He also denied the researchers' allegation that
antivivisectionists were responsible for the April 1987 fire that
caused $4.5 million in damage to a veterinary diagnostic laboratory
under construction at UC-Davis.
   Dr. Alexander Ardans, the lab's director, said he had no doubt
antivivisectionists ignited the blaze, spray-painted ``ALF,'' for
Animal Liberation Front, on lab walls, and vandalized 19 university
vehicles.
   Activists opposed to animal experimentation distributed printed
statements outside the news conference accusing Phalen of
needlessly killing beagles for studies that won't protect humans
from air pollutants.
   Phalen said the dogs receive excellent care. ``I'd rather be a
beagle in my laboratory than any pet I've known,'' he said.
   He acknowledged ``animals perish in research,'' but said such
``euthanasia'' is carefully regulated and that research benefits
humanity.

   President Reagan says the United States
considers its confrontation with Iran in the Persian Gulf
``closed'' following attacks that left two Iranian oil platforms
destroyed and Iran's Navy heavily damaged.
   ``It seems to be quieting down and we hope it continues that
way,'' Reagan said Tuesday.
   Reagan also said he was not surprised by Iran's decision to
fight back Monday after U.S. forces destroyed the platforms in
retaliation for the mining that damaged a Navy ship last week.
   The U.S. Navy later sunk or damaged six Iranian warships in the
daylong warfare.
   The president commented on the gulf during a picture-taking
session at the start of a meeting with Republican members of
Congress.
   Later, in a written report to Congress, Reagan said ``no doubt
exists'' that Iran was responsible for planting the mines that
prompted the U.S. strike.
   ``We have completed these self-defense actions and consider the
matter closed,'' Reagan wrote. He said U.S. forces must remain in
the area, and ``our forces remain prepared to take any additional
action necessary to protect themselves, U.S.-flag vessels and U.S.
lives.''
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz echoed Reagan's comments,
saying U.S. ships were in the gulf ``in a non-confrontational way''
and did not want ``to be engaged in a confrontation with Iran.''
   He denied Iran's assertion that the U.S. attacks were planned in
concert with Iraqi attacks on the Faw peninsula.
   ``We and others have a right to unimpeded access to the
international waterways, and we protect that right,'' Shultz told
reporters on his flight from Washington for three days of talks in
Moscow.
   Meanwhile, U.S. ships and helicopters continued searching today
for a Marine helicopter missing since Monday's violence in the
gulf, a Pentagon spokesman said. Iran has claimed that it downed a
helicopter, although the U.S. still lists the craft as missing.
   ``We don't have any indication of the status of the helicopter
or the people on board,'' said Maj. William O'Connell.
   The Pentagon identified the missing crewmen as Capt. Stephen C.
Leslie, 30, and Capt. Kenneth W. Hill, 33, assigned to Squadron
HMLA-167 based at the New River, N.C., Marine Corps Air Station.
   Reagan said nine ships were taking part in a search-and-rescue
mission for the helicopter.
   The Pentagon said there was no evidence the helicopter was shot
down and reported no U.S. casualties were reported in the warfare
Monday.
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Adm. William Crowe,
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told Reagan and GOP leaders
Tuesday that Iranian ships were essentially staying in port a day
after suffering heavy losses.
   Crowe also said there was no evidence Iran had fired Silkworm
missiles, as had been reported earlier.
   Pentagon spokesman Dan Howard said the Pentagon had no estimate
of Iranian casualties in the fighting, nor had U.S. ships picked up
any survivors.
   Howard also repeatedly and flatly denied press reports that the
United States was temporarily suspending its escort operations for
reflagged Kuwaiti tankers until the gulf calmed down again.
   Sources close to the Kuwait Oil Tanker Co. said the Navy was
halting until further notice escorts of the 11 tankers it reflagged
nine months ago. They said the main channel where the American
frigate Samuel B. Roberts was hit must be swept before the convoys
resume.
   Howard declared Tuesday, ``When we get ready to do a convoy,
we'll do it,'' saying reports of a suspension are ``simply not
true.''
   The spokesman confirmed that U.S. and allied mine-sweepers were
continuing to find underwater explosives in the southern gulf
almost a week after the Roberts struck one on April 14.
   At his White House meeting, Reagan won support from the
Republican lawmakers for his refusal to invoke the War Powers Act,
which the administration claims is unconstitutional.
   The 1973 law requires the president to notify Congress within 48
hours after American forces are put into a situation in which they
may become engaged in hostilities. It also requires those forces to
be withdrawn within 60 days, subject to a 30-day extension, if
Congress fails to declare war.

<HEAD>Mayor `Did My Best and Failed' In Presidential Primary</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It almost seemed at times that New York's
Democratic primary had boiled down to a race between Jesse Jackson
and Mayor Edward I. Koch.
   If so, Koch was clearly the loser.
   ``Mayor Koch made hysteria, I made history,'' said Jackson after
finishing second Tuesday with 37 percent of the vote.
   Jackson lost to Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, although he
won a slim margin over Dukakis in New York City despite bitter
attacks by Koch. And the man the mayor endorsed, Tennessee Sen. Al
Gore Jr., fared miserably.
   Koch conceded Tuesday night that his attacks on Jackson were
apparently a mistake.
   ``I did my best and I failed, but the world ain't over,'' he
said.
   Polls of those who voted Tuesday indicated the primary tactics
may haunt the mayor next year, however, when Koch has said he plans
to run for re-election.
   Fifty-six percent of the voters surveyed in a CBS-New York Times
exit poll said they disagreed with Koch's criticism of Jackson. And
60 percent of those polled by NBC said they don't want Koch to run
for re-election.
   ``Ed Koch was certainly not a winner in this and he looks like a
big loser,'' said an ABC pollster, Doug Muzzio.
   Koch campaigned tirelessley alongside Gore, taking over the
headlines when he sharply criticized Jackson's positions on Israel
and said Jews would ``have to be crazy'' to vote for him.
   Asked Tuesday night if he would make the same remarks if he
could turn back the clock, Koch replied: ``Obviously, I would not
make them the way I did because, apparently, they were not helpful
to Al Gore.''
   Later, appearing on ABC's ``Nightline,'' he added: ``Apparently
the word crazy is not acceptable and I promise never to use it
again.''
   Jackson's campaign chairman, California Assembly Speaker Willie
Brown, credited Koch with improving Jackson's showing.
   ``If he had been more subtle about it, it may have been more
devastating to the Jackson campaign,'' Brown said. ``But the
flagrant display of anti-Jackson attitudes ... have embarrassed
some of the people in New York who may have been otherwise against
Jackson.''
   Democratic Party Chairman Paul Kirk praised Jackson for showing
``laudable tolerance and restraint'' in the face of ``some bitter
invectives that were visited on him, (and) not by the candidates,
who have been positive.''

<TEXT>
   Two American women and four Costa
Ricans were wounded by a fragmentation grenade that exploded near
the American-Costa Rican Cultural Center, officials said.
   There was no immediate claim of responsibility for Tuesday's
attack, which Public Security Minister Hernan Garron called ``a
terrorist act.''
   He said officials had no suspects.
   The Intelligence and Security Directorate said the blast
apparently was caused by an M-67 fragmentation grenade tossed onto
a sidewalk near the Cultural Center. Three cars were damaged, its
report said.
   The blast occurred shortly after 8 a.m. (6 a.m. EDT) about 50
yards south of the Cultural Center building in the eastern Los
Yoses district, said U.S. Embassy spokesman Mark Krischick. The
building was not damaged, he said.
   He said Tuesday night that U.S. officials had been unable to
verify that the explosion was caused by a grenade. However, he
noted that Costa Rican officials ``were collecting evidence all
day.''
   ``We haven't had the opportunity to review the evidence,''
Krischick said. Earlier Tuesday, Krischick had said the explosion
was believed caused by a malfunctioning power line transformer.
   Red Cross officials identified the wounded Americans as Alice
Feister, a professor at the Cultural Center from the Washington,
D.C. area, and Shelly Bartain, a student from California.
   Hometowns and ages were not immediately available.
   Feister underwent surgery for several hours at Calderon Guardia
Hospital after suffering a severe artery wound. She was reported in
fair condition Tuesday night and was ``expected to pull through,''
said Krischick.
   Bartain suffered lacerations and bruises but was in good
condition, Krischick said. She was expected to return to the United
States today, a doctor at the hospital said.
   The other wounded were identified as Alvaro Salas Parra, 23;
William Quesada Solano, 22; Oscar Eric Bogantes, 17; and Virginia
Sanchez Cruz, 26, all Costa Rican citizens.
   Garron said evidence collected at the scene indicated the
grenade was thrown onto a sidewalk near the Cultural Center,
although it may have exploded beneath one of the three damaged cars
parked near the Center.
   Jorge Luis Ulate, an explosives expert with the security
ministry, said the device appeared to be an M-67 fragmentation
grenade, capable of inflicting serious damage up to a distance of
100 yards.
   Ulate said the device normally would explode between two and six
seconds after its pin is pulled.
   By Tuesday night, police had not located any witnesses.
   One person, who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of
anonymity, said he was near the site, heard a loud explosion and
later saw a cloud in the vicinity of the Cultural Center. He said
one person next to the nearby Anglo-American school appeared to
have been hurt by the blast.
   President Oscar Arias visited the injured in the hospital and
condemned the incident.
   ``This country, which is a haven of peace, one day could turn
into a Costa Rica invaded by terrorism and violence if we don't
adopt energetic measures to prevent it,'' he said.
   The explosion follows a violent demonstration April 7 in
Honduras by students enraged by the forced extradition of a
suspected drug dealer to the United States. The students sacked and
burned the U.S. Consulate and offices of the U.S. Information
Service in Tegucigalpa, the Honduran capital.

   A storm anchored off the Northern California coast brought
drenching rain and thunderstorms to much of the state and snow to
the Lake Tahoe area, but authorities anticipated little relief from
the dry winter.
   Elsewhere, a cold front resulted in showers today from central
Ontario across the northern Plains.
   Showers and thunderstorms spread across southern Florida as a
cold front sagged southward across the area. Thunderstorms were
accompanied by heavy rain across parts of southeast Florida.
   Other showers were isolated over west-central Kansas.
Snowshowers were scattered across parts of central New York.
   Nearly an inch of rain was measured at downtown Sacramento,
Calif., and street flooding was reported Tuesday evening across
northeast Sacramento County.
   Two tornados struck in Folsom, about 20 miles east of
Sacramento, on Tuesday afternoon, damaging several houses but
resulting in no injuries, police said.
   The precipitation didn't mean managers of the Northern
California watersheds were ready to call an end to the drought.
   ``It would take a tremendous amount of rain to get us into a
normal situation,'' said Bill Helms, spokesman for the state's
Flood Operations Center in Sacramento. ``Dribs and drabs won't help
us much at this point.''
   A flash flood watch issued overnight for coastal mountain and
foothill communities of southern Santa Barbara, Ventura and Los
Angeles counties.
   A snow advisory continued overnight for the Shasta Siskiyou
mountains, northeast California and the southern Sierra Nevada.
   A winter weather advisory continued for the Southern California
mountains, with up to a foot of snow reported above 7,000 feet just
west of Lake Tahoe.
   Showers were reported across southwest Oregon with snow in the
southern areas of the Cascades. Isolated showers and thunderstorms
were occurring from north central Nevada through southeast Idaho
into north central Wyoming.
   Today's forecast called for scattered showers and thunderstorms
for most of the nation west of the Rockies and across eastern
Montana, eastern Wyoming and portions of Nebraska and South Dakota;
snowshowers for much of northern Nevada and the higher elevations
of eastern California. Also rain or snowshowers should be scattered
over Michigan, New York and northern New England. A few showers
should linger over southern Florida.
   High temperatures should be in the 80s for most of Florida and
from the southern Plains to southeast Arizona; in the 90s in
southwest Texas; 40s or 50s from New England across New Jersey,
Pennsylvania, the upper Ohio Valley the Great Lakes, northern
Plains, and most of Montana west to Northern California; the 60s or
70s elsewhere.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 20
degrees at Alpena, Mich., to 78 at Miami and Key West, Fla.

<HEAD>Lawmakers, Boaters Criticize Coast Guard's Commercial Towing
Policy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An official of the Coast Guard says a policy
that leaves boaters in need of non-emergency help adrift and
waiting for commercial tow operators while trained Coast Guard
volunteers standby should be changed.
   The policy, adopted following 1983 instructions from Congress,
limiting Coast Guard towing to emergency situations only, has
created situations where trained and eager Coast Guard Auxiliary
crews arrive first, but are forced to simply standby and wait for
commercial towers.
   Lawmakers, recreational boaters and Commodore William C. Harr,
head of the Coast Guard Auxiliary, on Tuesday told members of the
House Merchant Marine and Fisheries Coast Guard subcommittee the
policy is creating severe morale problems among the 32,000 civilian
volunteer force, which was created in 1939 to augment the Coast
Guard in World War II..
   ``This policy has dealt the organization a body blow by
undermining the pride which members had in helping their fellow
boaters,'' Harr said. ``I am convinced that this dissatisfaction is
a leading indicator of a massive and irreplaceable loss of trained,
qualified, experienced auxiliarists.''
   However Rep. Gerry E. Studds, D-Mass., suggested that the Reagan
administration is unable to decide on a policy because the issue
pits the concept of privatization by allowing commercial operators
to handle all non-emergency towing against the concept of
volunteerism embodied by the auxiliary.

   Ford Motor Co. is recalling about 106,000 1984
Ranger and Bronco II trucks to bring their emissions control
systems into compliance with federal regulations, the government
and Ford said.
   The Environmental Protection Agency said Tuesday the recall
affects only the trucks with 2.8-liter engines and automatic
transmissions. California trucks, which are built to meet different
emissions standards, are not involved.
   The EPA said its tests had discovered the trucks' exhausts put
out hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide in excess of federal
regulations, but the agency was unable to identify a defective
component or part failure as the cause.
   ``Ford has agreed to adjust the choke and ignition timing to new
specifications and install new carburetor metering jets to bring
the trucks into compliance with the standards,'' the EPA said.

   President Reagan says the United States must
make a commitment to long-term investment in space exploration in
order advance the country's leadership in that area and he is
asking Congress and the American people to join him in those
efforts.
   ``Can we afford to stop our exploration and wait for others to
pass us?'' Reagan asked on Tuesday in a speech at the annual
government-industry dinner of the Electronic Industries Association.
   ``Tonight I ask Congress and all the American people to join me
in making the long-term investment required to advance U.S.
leadership in space,'' Reagan said. ``We must begin that investment
by funding the increases I've proposed for our civil space
program.''
   Reagan has proposed $1 billion in the next fiscal year that
begins Oct. 1 for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
to build a U.S. space station.
   The president also used the speech as an opportunity to plug the
Strategic Defense Initiative, or Star Wars, his proposal for a
space-based defense against nuclear missiles.
   ``Five years ago I proposed SDI and, much to my satisfaction, we
have made tremendous progress in that research,'' he said. ``We
must not stop dreaming because a few naysayers insist on limiting
our options for a safe and secure future.''

<HEAD>American Red Cross Starts Workplace AIDS Education Program</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An American Red Cross survey indicates that
employee fears about AIDS and how to deal with co-workers who have
the fatal disease are threatening a substantial disruption of the
workplace.
   The study, released Tuesday, showed that 42 percent of 2,000
workers questioned nationwide said they would not work with anyone
who has AIDS and 29 percent said they felt so strongly about it
that they would quit their jobs before working with an AIDS patient.
   AIDS is a contagious disease that destroys the immune system,
rendering the body incapable of resisting other diseases and
infections.
   Researcher David M. Herold of the Georgia Institute of
Technology, who conducted the survey, said there already have been
incidents in which work came to a standstill as a result of
unreasonable fear toward the disease.
   He cited an incident at a a state government office in Florida
which was shut down after a worker with AIDS who became ill had
vomited in his office.
   In another instance Herold said a power company was forced to
cancel a cardiopulminary resuscitation training program when
workers said they would not use the mouth-to-mouth breathing
technique on a co-worker afflicted with the disease.
   ``They (the workers) said that if anybody touched a live wire
and got electrocuted, they would just have to die because nobody
would do CPR,'' said Herold.
   He declined to identify the state government office or the
utility company.

   Tybee Island residents who know turtles
have a good reason to cross the road are trying to make sure they
get to the other side.
   Every spring, female terrapins come out of the marshes, looking
for high ground to lay their eggs.
   ``Every spring, for two to three months, they get killed on the
highway looking for high nesting sites,'' Gretchen Powell,
coordinator for the Tybee Terrapin Turtle Project, said recently.
``They wander quite widely. I don't have any actual numbers, but a
large number of them are killed each year.''
   So this year, the Tybee Island Chamber of Commerce and the
turtle project are spending $1,000 for signs alsong the Islands
Expressway near the Tybee Island city limits warning motorists to
watch for turtles.
   Volunteers also will begin taking a survey of turtle sightings,
and teach students in schools here about the turtles.
   The female terrapins range from 6 to 9{ inches across their
shells. They are found in tidal waters from the Gulf of Mexico to
the mid-Atlantic.

   A 31-year-old East German man dodged
salvos of bullets to scramble over the heavily guarded Berlin Wall
and dashed unhurt to West Berlin, police said.
   West Berlin police spokesman Peter Glaser said the man used a
homemade ladder to scale fences on the East Berlin side of the wall
near the Neukoeln district before dawn Tuesday.
   He reached the wall under cover of darkness, but East German
border guards finally spotted him and began firing, police said.
West Berlin witnesses told police they heard three salvos of
automatic weapons fire.
   The man climbed over the barrier and dashed across a narrow
strip of East German territory to safety.
   Meanwhile, a 22-year-old East German border guard in uniform on
Tuesday escaped to the West German state of Lower Saxony, police in
Hanover said.
   They said the guard, a second lieutenant, fled unnoticed while
on duty.

   It took all of two minutes to complete the $9.13
million sale of the largest diamond ever to go on the block,
setting a world record for any gem sold at auction.
   The anonymous buyer bid by telephone Tuesday night for the
85.91-carat, pear-shaped diamond, described as a ``drop of frozen
light.''
   ``It represents the very essence of this planet in its simplest
and purest form,'' said Neil Letson, gemologist and jewelry
historian.
   The sale of the diamond was part of an overall jewelry auction
that included gems belonging to the late Clare Boothe Luce. The
auction brought a total of $36 million, setting another record: for
a jewelry sale in the United States.
   ``The sale was a great success,'' said John D. Block, director
of Sotheby's jewelry division.
   The nameless diamond _ whose owner was not identified _ has been
graded D color, the highest possible rating, meaning it is
perfectly cut and flawless.
   Bidding opened at $6 million. Someone in the room bid $7
million, then bids increased in increments of $100,000, according
to Diana Levitt, director of corporate affairs for Sotheby's.
   The gem sold for $8.3 million, plus a 10 percent commission.
   The sale exceeded the 1980 record at a Sotheby's auction in
Geneva where $6.6 million was bid for a pair of ear pendants with
four pear-shaped diamonds totaling 131.86 carats.
   Letson placed the diamond historically at slightly below the
Cullinan III, now in the British Crown Jewels collection, and
slightly above the Spoonmaker Diamond, now in Istanbul's Topkapi
Museum.
   Also on the block Tuesday night were jewels and other
possessions of Mrs. Luce, the former congresswoman and ambassador
to Italy.
   Her collection, which included pieces from Van Cleef & Arpels,
Tiffany, Cartier and Bulgari, sold for $2.16 million. All the
pieces in the collection were sold.
   In addition, nearly $600,000 worth of furniture and decorations
belonging to Mrs. Luce were sold.
   Proceeds of the Luce sale will go to the Clare Boothe Luce Fund,
administered by the Henry Luce Foundation. The fund supports
scholarships and fellowships for women in the applied sciences,
such as mathematics and chemistry.
   Block characterized Mrs. Luce's jewelry collection as ``a
fascinating combination of important jewelry and uncommon
historical significance which reflects the life and style of an
exceptional woman.''
   Mrs. Luce, who also was known as an author and war
correspondent, began her writing career at Vogue. In 1935, she
married Henry R. Luce, the late chairman of Time Inc.
   She served as war correspondent for Life magazine during World
War II, and then served two terms in Congress as a Republican
representing Connecticut, starting with her first victory in 1942.
   Mrs. Luce was appointed ambassador to Italy by then-President
Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1952. She remained active in GOP politics
until her death last year.

   A couple's $185 bid was enough to win a
vasectomy donated by a group of doctors to help a public television
station.
   The procedure had been donated for the benefit of KCPT-TV by
Central Family Medicine, a medical group with offices in Mission
and Kansas City, Kan.
   It was purchased Monday by a couple who were unavailable for
comment, station officials said.
   ``I've been doing this long enough that every (gift) seems
normal to me,'' said Karen Rankin, coordinator of the annual
fund-raiser.
   The minor operation, which renders a man sterile, was valued at
$300, said Dr. Malcolm Knarr, a family practitioner who said he was
a supporter of public television.
   ``It makes an ideal present for a wife to give her husband,'' he
said.

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Immigration officials will inform about 1,000
imprisoned Mariel Cubans that they are considered a risk to the
public, putting them a step closer to deportation.
   Under an agreement between the U.S. government and Mariel
prisoners who rioted at a federal penitentiary in Atlanta last
year, the detainees deemed ``non-releaseable'' have 30 days to
appeal to the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service.
   Duke Austin, an INS spokesman in Washington, said the agency
would begin sending letters this week to the 1,000 prisoners who
have been considered risks to the community.
   If their appeal to the INS fails, the prisoners can appeal to a
special Justice Department panel, and get two more appeals if the
government eventually orders them deported.
   ``I think this is due process, and then some,'' said Justice
Department spokesman Patrick Korten.
   ``It's a paper review. It's a joke,'' said Rafael Penalver, a
lawyer here who is an advocate for the Cuban prisoners who object
to their detention but also fear deportation to their communist
homeland.
   Penalver says those prisoners were not allowed to present
evidence or witnesses, and also won't receive hearings if they
appeal.
   A House subcommittee heard similar arguments in February.
Federal officials responded that they were already going beyond
what was required by law because of an agreement made when riots
broke out last November among 3,800 Mariel Cubans in indefinite
detention.
   The Cubans, who had come to the United States in an illegal
boatlift from the Cuban port of Mariel, all had committed crimes in
the United States and served out their prison terms before
immigration officials detained them.
   As of April 8, about 970 detainees had been freed and 1,100
recommended for release to their families or halfway houses,
officials said.

<HEAD>Former Police Lieutenant Who Testified Against Fellow Officer Shot</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NINE MILE FALLS, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former police lieutenant who
testified against a fellow officer in a police-shooting case in San
Diego was shot at his home here, said authorities, who found a
badge stuck to his shirt.
   Doyle F. Wheeler, who moved here about 1{ years ago, was wounded
Tuesday afternoon at his home in the retirement community of
Suncrest, about 20 miles northwest of Spokane.
   Stevens County Sheriff Dick Andres said Wheeler, 36, was able to
speak to investigators Tuesday night at a Spokane-area hospital,
where he was being treated for a gunshot wound to his head that was
not believed to be serious.
   Andres said a note was found at the shooting scene, but declined
to reveal its contents. A San Diego television station, KFMB,
reported the note said, ``This is a payback.''
   A San Diego Police Department spokesman said Wheeler told
Spokane-area authorities that three men broke into his house, took
him into the basement and beat him, burned him with cigarette butts
and pinned a police badge on his shirt before shooting him behind
his ear.
   Stevens County Chief Criminal Deputy J.R. Mugaas refused to
comment on reports that Wheeler was tortured.
   Wheeler called 911 and said he had been shot, Andres said.
   ``We're treating this as if it were an attempted murder,''
Andres said.
   Andres said an all-points bulletin was issued for three men who
apparently sped away from Wheeler's home in his small foreign car.
   Ross Kelley, who lives next door to Wheeler, said he saw a
police badge on Wheeler's shirt when he was taken by stretcher to a
medical helicopter.
   Andres declined to say whether the assault may have been
connected with Wheeler's former affiliation with the San Diego
police.
   San Diego police Cmdr. Keith Enerson, however, said there was no
connection.
   Wheeler once testified in San Diego at a trial of Sagon Penn,
who alleged he shot two officers only after he was attacked because
of his race. Penn, who is black, was quitted of murder and
attempted murder, and lesser charges were later dropped.
   Wheeler's testimony supported the defense theory that the March
31, 1985, shooting erupted during a racially motivated struggle
provoked by the white officers.
   Police Agent Thomas Riggs died during the shooting, and police
Agent Donovan Jacobs and civilian observer Sarah Pina-Ruiz were
wounded.
   Wheeler had testified that Jacobs had once slammed a black man's
head against a wall without provocation at police headquarters. The
former lieutenant said he didn't consider Jacobs to be a good
police officer.
   No San Diego police officers have been charged with any crimes
in connection with the case.
   The prosecution suggested that Wheeler's psychological problems
distorted his criticism of police. Wheeler had been given a
stress-related disability leave from the police deparment in
September 1977 and returned in April 1978, according to a San Diego
police spokesman.
   Wheeler was also among the first officers at the scene of a July
1984 mass shooting at a McDonald's restaurant in San Ysidro, a
suburb of San Diego, that left 21 people dead.
   Wheeler, his wife and their two children moved to Washington
state after Wheeler received a stress disability retirement from
the San Diego Police Department, said Kelley.

   A strong earthquake shook Nepal today,
sending people running out of their houses in the capital. No
injuries or damage were immediately reported.
   The tremor measured 5.2 on the Richter scale and was centered
around the town of Dhankuta, 188 miles east of Katmandu, the
Seismology Laboratory of the Department of Mines reported.
   The quake happened at 12:25 p.m. (2:25 a.m. EDT), the laboratory
said.
   No injuries or damage were reported.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph. A tremor measuring 5 can cause considerable damage,
while a magnitude 6 quake can cause severe damage.

<TEXT>
   A 16-year-old girl was killed in a new gang
shooting as authorities searched today for a parolee armed with a
Soviet-style assault rifle who is believed to have slain a
6-year-old girl in an act of vengeance.
   The parolee was identified Tuesday as George Carter _ also known
as George Taylor _ one of two men held responsible for spraying a
home with bullets Sunday night, killing Irma Saucedo.
   Her father, Salvador Saucedo, 39, died Tuesday from wounds
suffered in the attack, one of several recently in gang-plagued Los
Angeles neighborhoods.
   The Saucedos were apparently caught in a deadly grudge over a
blue baseball cap, which Irma's 13-year-old brother refused to turn
over to gang members, authorities said.
   The area's most notorious gangs, the Crips and the Bloods,
advertise their affiliation by wearing blue and red respectively,
and wearing the wrong colors on gang turf can prove deadly.
   A stakeout for Carter, 27, was called off late Tuesday after an
anonymous tip that he was seen in an apartment complex proved
unfounded, police said. A $10,000 reward was offered by the county
Board of Supervisors for information leading to conviction of the
killer.
   ``Carter was recently seen in possession of an AK-47-type
weapon,'' Sheriff Sherman Block said, referring to a Soviet assault
rifle favored by gang members rich from drug profits. ``That was
apparently one of the weapons used in this shooting.''
   The identity of the second gunman remained unknown.
   The girl slain Tuesday, 16-year-old Alejandra Melgoza, was
standing with friends on a street corner in suburban Paramount when
shots were fired from a passing Buick, said sheriff's Deputy Leo
Weitzel.
   ``It's just the luck of draw almost whether a young child is
seriously wounded or killed by these cowardly gang members. ...
They just have no value for the life of anyone else,'' said Cmdr.
William Booth, the Police Department's top spokesman.
   Gang violence in Los Angeles County has claimed the lives of at
least 93 people since the beginning of the year, according to
figures collected by the Los Angeles County sheriff's and police
departments.
   Miss Melgoza, who died at a suburban Compton hospital, was
friendly with gang members, the girl's sister Hilda told reporters.
   ``I guess the rest of the gangs knew that my sister was talking
to different gangs and wanted to get revenge or something, I don't
know,'' she told a local radio station.
   Also injured in the Sunday attack was Irma Saucedo's mother,
Maria Hernandez, 39, who remained in critical condition. The girl's
brother and cousin suffered relatively minor wounds.

<TEXT>
   Most of the 31 hostages who spent 16
days aboard a hijacked Kuwaiti jumbo jet emerged from their ordeal
today dazed and trembling, as though uncertain their nightmare was
over.
   Few of the hostages saw the hijackers' faces because the captors
showed themselves only with their faces covered by pillowcases that
had holes cut out for the eyes.
   ``The worst moment was when they put a gun to the head of one of
the passengers,'' said the plane's purser, Abdel Monem Mahmoud, an
Egyptian. ``Their eyes were sharp and expressionless, like those of
a shark.''
   One of the hostages said he once caught a glimpse of the faces
of five of the hijackers through a crack in a toilet door.
   ``They were all very young,'' said the man, whose name was not
used for his safety.
   He said that from this brief view and from the hijackers' voices
he might be able to recognize some of them, but he added: ``All
except their leader _ I never saw his face and he never spoke to
us.''
   The hostages said no one among them knew that two Kuwaitis were
killed during the plane's stopover in Cyprus last week. The
hijackers probably used silencers on the guns with which they shot
two Kuwaiti security men aboard the plane.
   ``I had no idea they killed anyone,'' said Ali Kandari, 24, an
astonished expression on his face. ``Who was it? Where? When?''
   None of the hostages reported being tortured or beaten, but
Kandari said he saw one of the hijackers savagely striking an
elderly man who insisted on going to the toilet after they had
ordered him to sit down.
   The man, a diabetic, was released last Thursday and immediately
hospitalized.
   Hostages said they were handcuffed at all times. Some even read
the Koran, the Moslem holy book, with their hands in cuffs.
   They said that on Tuesday night, just hours before their
release, the hijackers distributed the traditional fast-breaking
Ramadan evening meal, then ordered the captives to go to sleep
without allowing them the usual time for prayer.
   A 31-year-old businessman, Tadar El Khebi, said he knew they
were about to be released today when he noticed the hijackers going
through the plane shortly after 4 a.m. wiping clean every spot
where they might have left fingerprints. Two hours later, the
hostages walked out of the plane to freedom, trembling and looking
dazed.
   Many of the hostages said they were in constant fear for their
lives.
   ``From the very begining I thought of death,'' Mahmoud said. ``I
thought I would be the first to be killed because they were very
security conscious, and they immediately asked me where I had my
gun.
   ``My mind kept flashing back to my past,'' he added. ``At such
moments, you think about things that you never imagined you would
remember.''
   Mahmoud said it was the second hijack of his flying career with
Kuwait Airways. He said he was in a Kuwaiti Boeing 727 hijacked in
1984 when two American passengers were killed.
   ``I'm happy I'm still okay,'' he said.
   The Iraqi captain of the plane, gray-bearded Subhi Youssef, 53,
sat quietly in the airport VIP lounge as reporters milled around.
   Clearly a man of few words, his eyes glinted when a reporter
asked what he would do after returning to Kuwait.
   ``I will sit and think about it,'' he said with a slight smile.
   Algerian aviation officials said they were impressed by the
quiet and effective professionalism with which Youssef handled the
plane and its technical radio communications with the control tower
throughout the ordeal in Algiers.
   Youssef, a pilot for 32 years, 20 of them with Kuwaiti Airways,
was asked how he felt when the hijackers put a gun to his head in
the cockpit when the plane was seized April 5 on a flight from
Bangkok to Kuwait.
   ``What can you do?'' Youssef shrugged in reply.
   How did he feel now that it was all over?
   ``I am really relieved,'' he said, his face showing fatigue.
Algerian offials said the plane's crew was too exhausted to fly the
jumbo jet back to Kuwait.
   Another hostage, 26-year-old lieutenant in the Kuwait fire
service who gave his name only as Ali, said he never lost
confidence that the authorities would find a solution.
   He said he fully supported the Kuwait government's refusal to
meet the hijackers' main demand, the release of 17 prisoners in
Kuwait convicted on terrorism charges.
   ``We agree with our government's attitude,'' he said. ``But we
knew they would help us. Our government never forgets any Kuwait
citizen.''

   The bodies of two Ohio National
Guardsmen, missing for two days in Lake Erie, were discovered after
a search for them had been called off.
   The bodies of Spec. 4 Wayne C. Wingate, 30, of Lima, and Sgt.
Melvin Wisecup, 31, of Waynesfield, were found washed ashore a
short distance from each other Tuesday morning, said Guard
spokeswoman Sonya Elam.
   The men disappeared while on one of two 27-foot Army patrol
boats dispatched from Camp Perry Sunday to clear an area of
civilian boats prior to start of the 4th U.S. Army rifle matches.
The matches were later suspended.
   The boat has not been found and authorities were still
investigating the deaths today.
   A search by the U.S. Coast Guard was canceled at sunset Monday
after units from the U.S. and Canadian coast guards found no
evidence of the men, members the 837th Engineer Co.
   Local residents found Wingate's body near the docks of Sugar
Rocks Harbor and Marina and notified authorities. Wisecup's body
was found a short time later by guardsmen after Guard helicopters
were put in the air to help with the search, Ms. Elam said.

   One day after Mayor Kenneth Fisher was
charged with taking bribes to cover up an alleged gambling
conspiracy, he apparently took his own life, officials in this
Chicago suburb said.
   Dixmoor Police Chief Anton Graff, whose undercover work for the
FBI led to Fisher's indictment, said the mayor's wife, Cathy, found
his body about 4 p.m. Tuesday, slumped behind the wheel of their
pickup truck. The engine was running and the garage was filled with
exhaust, Graff said.
   Graff said he had heard of talk from Fisher, 59, that ``there's
nothing to live for.'' He called the apparent suicide ``a very
tragic end to a very long investigation.''
   A federal grand jury indicted Fisher and two other men Monday in
connection with a gambling operation that allegedly operated out of
two Dixmoor taverns for about five years.
   Fisher, mayor of the community of about 4,200 for seven years,
was accused of taking monthly bribes from mid-1982 to August 1987
to cover up the operation.
   If convicted, the mayor would have faced up to 55 years in
prison and a fine of up to $1.25 million, U.S. Attorney Anton
Valukas said.
   Fisher's attorney, David Miesmer, said Fisher had left a note
but added that neither he, Mrs. Fisher nor Graff had read it late
Tuesday.
   The mayor had ``maintained his innocence throughout,'' Miesmer
said.
   Graff said the cause of death appeared to be carbon monoxide
poisoning, but the Cook County medical examiner's office had not
identified a definite cause.
   Graff and village board members said the mayor had appeared
depressed since the FBI had interviewed him in March.Fisher, who
had diabetes, had to be hospitalized about two weeks ago because he
stopped taking his medication, Graff said.

   Thieves with an eye for
``top-of-the-line'' women's fashions had baffled police here for
two months, until authorities discovered they were dealing with a
ring of transvestites.
   Detectives investigating robberies of at least 10 boutiques in
affluent south Palm Beach County on Tuesday arrested two men _ one
dressed in women's clothes _ with a carload of beachwear stolen
moments earlier.
   The men are part of an organized group of 10 to 15 men who dress
as women and were responsible for thefts of at least $200,000 in
women's clothes during the past two months, said Sgt. Ken Deischer.
   ``Some are transvestites, but we can't say they all are because
we don't know who all of them are,'' Deischer said.
   The thieves who threw a rock through the plate-glass window at
Doreen's Swimwear on Tuesday cleared the racks of about $10,000 in
swimsuits, rompers, coverups, shorts and tops, officials said.
   ``The things they took were top-of-the-line,'' store manager
Michael Goldstein said. ``These swimsuits retail for $80 to $150
and coverups go for $90 to $220.''
   One of the suspects arrested Tuesday was dressed in black
women's slacks, black midriff top barely covering a black bra,
jewelry and makeup, Deischer said.
   What the thieves were doing with the stolen clothes remains a
mystery, Deischer said.
   ``I'd be curious to find out where it's going. I mean, you're
talking about $200,000 worth of clothing,'' Deischer said. ``And
that's more than they could be wearing.''

   Residents of this community gathered to
denounce a local religious group's plans to give sanctuary to
rapist-mutilator Lawrence Singleton after his release from parole
in California.
   ``We want to do everything we can to keep him from coming
here,'' Anita Van Housen, president of the Cow Creek Homeowner's
Association, said as about 60 people who gathered at the Azalea
Grange on Tuesday night. ``But we can't tolerate lawlessness. We
aren't a lawless community.''
   Van Housen was referring to eight shotgun blasts fired last
Thursday at buildings owned by the Bride of Christ Church, whose
pastor has offered the 60-year-old Singleton a job and a home.
   The shots broke windows and damaged a tractor. Ray Duncan,
Douglas County undersheriff, said authorities also received reports
of fences being cut on church property, which he told the crowd
``does no one any good.''
   Singleton was escorted quietly off the grounds of San Quentin
Prison on Monday to avoid a mob scene when he is freed from parole
restrictions April 25, said Bob Gore, spokesman for the California
Department of Corrections.
   Singleton served most of his one-year parole in a trailer on the
prison grounds for his own protection after his release from prison
last year sparked angry protests that forced him from town to town.
   He was convicted of raping 15-year-old hitchhiker Mary Bell
Vincent and hacking off her forearms with an ax in 1978. He served
eight years in prison.
   Thomas Clyde Smith Jr., the church pastor, did not attend the
meeting in this southern Oregon community to discuss fears arising
from his plans to shelter Singleton.
   ``It would be a real real bad idea to make foolhardy mistake of
allowing him to move here without having our say ... at the
possible sacrifice of one of our children,'' said Kelly Repp, 35, a
Glendale firefighter and father of three girls.
   ``I'm just terrified of having him here,'' Repp said. ``My
daughters are terrified of him, too.''

   Jesse Jackson today congratulated New York
primary winner Michael Dukakis for resisting the ``temptation to
take the campaign to the gutter,'' but vowed to stay in the
Democratic race through the final round of primaries June 7.
   Jackson said it was too early to consider the vice presidency.
``Let's wait until June 8 to make that kind of judgment,'' he said
on NBC's ``Today'' show. ``We're very much in this race. We expect
great things to happen.
   Dukakis scored a decisive win over Jackson, 51 percent to 37
percent, in the New York primary Tuesday.
   ``In this case you had a mayor with a strong supporting cast who
led the drive using race and religion as a litmus test,'' Jackson
said of the New York results.
   New York Mayor Edward I. Koch harshly criticized Jackson during
the primary campaign. Koch supported Albert Gore Jr., who finished
a distant third.
   Jackson, appearing on CBS-TV, congratulated Dukakis, not only
for his win but because ``he resisted the temptation to take the
campaign to the gutter. Good for him and good for America.''
   Jackson said he had met with Gore on Tuesday night to discuss
the Tennessee senator's ``future options'' in the campaign. But he
said he didn't know whether Gore was ready to support him.
   ``The people of New York spoke loudly today and very
effectively,'' said Jackson's national campaign manager, Gerald
Austin. ``They are not going to put up with divisiveness. They are
to be commended for that.''
   The New York primary campaign proved to be a ferocious affair
that featured an almost daily tongue-lashing from Koch directed at
Jackson. Koch had said that Jews would have to be ``crazy'' to vote
for Jackson. Jackson's campaign manager said Koch was ``insane.''
   ``We're disappointed we didn't win, and we congratulate Gov.
Dukakis. We also congratulate the people of New York for pushing
aside what Mayor Koch tried to do,'' Austin said.
   Austin was optimistic about prospects in next Tuesday's
Pennsylvania primary and the Ohio primary, a week later, as well as
later big-state contests like California.
   ``We think we're still in this race,'' he said.

   The dollar was nearly motionless in dull European
trading late this morning. Gold prices rose.
   Dealers said they didn't expect much movement during the rest of
the session unless the report on the U.S. consumer price index
(CPI), to be released at 1:30 p.m. (8:30 a.m. EDT), contains
surprises.
   ``The dollar is incredibly stable,'' one Milan trader said.
``The market is bearish, there's no doubt about that, but the
possibility of central bank intervention and the (Persian) Gulf
situation is supporting it.''
   He predicted that ``sooner or later the market will push the
dollar lower,'' but that in the short run the dollar was likely to
remain stuck in a very tight range.
   If the price index report for March shows that U.S. inflation is
picking up, U.S. interest rates likely will rise and dollar could
move higher, traders said.
   If the index rises the expected 0.4 percent or less, the dollar
is likely to resume its decline, traders said.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar fell 0.47 yen to a closing 123.90 yen. Later, in
London, it was quoted at 123.97 yen.
   Other dollar rates at mid-morning, compared with late Tuesday:
   _1.6615 West German marks, down from 1.6625
   _1.3741 Swiss francs, down from 1.3752
   _5.6440 French francs, down from 5.6465
   _1.8636 Dutch guilders, down from 1.8642
   _1,235.25 Italian lire, down from 1,235.75
   _1.2297 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2337
   In London, the British pound was quoted at $1.8950, stronger
than $1.8930 Tuesday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $457.30 a troy ounce,
compared with late Tuesday's $456.50. At mid-morning today, the
city's five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of
$458.00.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $457.80, up from $457.00 late
Tuesday.
   Earlier in Hong Kong, gold rose $1.35 to close at a bid $458.94.
   Silver was quoted in London today at a bid price of $6.49 a troy
ounce, up from Tuesday's $6.46.

   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis laced
together a broad geographic and ethnic coalition to capture the
delegate-rich New York Democratic presidential primary and solidify
his claim to front-runner status.
   Unofficial returns showed Jesse Jackson with a narrow lead over
Dukakis in New York City, a fact he said was proof that his
candidacy was still viable.
   ``We won the Big Apple,'' Jackson declared Tuesday night. But
Dukakis triumphed virtually everywhere else, drubbing Jackson in
the suburbs and upstate New York.
   ``I love New York,'' Dukakis told a boisterous New York City
victory rally.
   In winning Tuesday's New York primary decisively, Dukakis may
have knocked Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore Jr. out of the race. Gore
aides and friends said he was considering ending his cash-strapped
campaign.
   With 99 percent of New York precincts reporting, the unofficial
vote looked this way:
   _Dukakis had 783,568 votes or 51 percent.
   _Jackson had 573,112 or 37 percent.
   _Gore had 156,052 or 10 percent.
   Of the 255 delegates at stake in the Democratic primary, 164
were expected to go to Dukakis; 89 to Jackson; and two to Gore.
   The Republican primary in New York was little more than a
formality along the road to Vice President George Bush's eventual
nomination. He captured 92 of the 96 delegates at stake in a race
that saw less than 10 percent of the eligible Republicans turn out.
Four went to Rep. Jack Kemp, who abandoned his campaign some time
back.
   Turnout was much heavier in the Democratic primary, with more
than 40 percent of the eligible voters going to the polls. In 1984,
39 percent showed up.
   The unofficial returns had Jackson leading Dukakis in New York
City by about 6,500 votes out of the almost 1 million cast.
However, in the suburbs, Dukakis had an almost 90,000-vote margin
and upstate it was a more than 120,000-vote margin.
   What happened, according to exit polls, was that Jackson
collected about 95 percent of the black vote, about 15 percent of
the white vote and Dukakis won almost everything else, running
strong among Jews and pulling out other white ethnics. The
Massachusetts governor did especially well among Catholics.
   The Dukakis draw had some Democrats smiling about a possible
strong showing in November if he winds up with the nomination.
   ``If they're coming out today, that's the first indication
they'll be coming out in November,'' said John Marino, a top New
York party official and political aide to New York Gov. Mario
Cuomo, of the possible fall support for Dukakis from the white
ethnic voters, a group that has gone heavily to Republicans in
recent national elections.
   In winning New York, Dukakis easily bested Walter Mondale's 44
percent win in 1984, a victory engineered by Cuomo's political
machine. Jackson finished about 10 percentage points higher than
four years ago when he got 26 percent of the New York vote. Gary
Hart took second spot in the 1984 primary with 27 percent of the
vote.
   While Dukakis handed Jackson a considerable setback, he did it
without directly attacking him. But exit polls indicated that many
blacks didn't feel comfortable with Dukakis and said he wasn't
sensitive to their needs.
   Dukakis said he recognized the potential problem, but noted that
in his Massachusetts races he had ``always gotten strong minority
support.'' He said if he is the nominee, ``I'll be reaching out.''
   Gore, on the other hand, became the first of the Democratic
candidates to go directly after Jackson, talking about the need to
elect a ``president, not a preacher.''
   Then Gore got the Koch endorsement and the attacks, now coming
from Koch, became more strident. Jews would have to be ``crazy'' to
vote for Jackson and Jackson couldn't be trusted to tell the truth
under stress, said Koch.
   Gore eventually said Koch was ``speaking for himself.''
Jackson's campaign manager, Gerald Austin, dismissed Koch as
``Crazy Eddie.''
   After the primary results were in, Koch appeared contrite.
   ``I said what I thought was true, but obviously it did not help
Al Gore,'' said the mayor.
   With the campaign appearing to narrow to a two-man race, Dukakis
said he expected that he and Jackson would avoid strong criticisms
of each other.
   ``Neither of us believes that cutting up the other guy is the
way you win elections,'' said the governor.

   Carlos Lehder Rivas' brothers have
threatened the life of a witness who may testify in reputed
Colombian drug kingpin's cocaine-smuggling trial, officials said.
   Lehder, 38, and Jack Carlton Reed, 57, are on trial on charges
they conspired to smuggle some 3.3 tons of cocaine into the United
States via Norman's Cay in the Bahamas.
   U.S. Attorney Robert W. Merkle said Tuesday he had received
reports from Colombia that Carlos Toro's relatives had been
contacted by Lehder's brothers and told he shouldn't testify.
   Also, on Monday an anonymous male caller telephoned Florida
Publishing Co., which publishes the Jacksonville Journal and The
Florida Times-Union, and said somebody ``would do away with'' Toro
before he can testify.
   Toro, a boyhood friend of Lehder, may be called to testify about
smuggling some 2 tons of cocaine for Lehder through Andros Island,
Bahamas, in 1983 and 1984.
   Merkle refused to discuss any possible investigation into the
incidents by the U.S. Marshal's Service.
   Wendell Welman, a criminal investigator for the Internal Revenue
Service, will continue his testimony today about financial records
of Lehder's companies managed by Guardian Trust Ltd. of Nassau.
   On Tuesday, Welman read a letter in the records of one of the
companies owned by Lehder that told Bahamian officials that Lehder
planned a massive remodeling on the island of Norman's Cay.
   On April 20, 1979, a letter was written to Clement Maynard,
director of tourism for the Bahamas, telling him that Lehder had
bought a large part of Norman's Cay. It tells of his plan to close
public facilities while they were being remodeled ``because of the
poor state of repairs.''
   The letter was written by Ian C. Davidson of Guardian Trust Ltd.
on behalf of International Dutch Resources, one of Lehder's
companies.
   The letter said Lehder's company planned to file documents for
permits to lengthen the airstrip, expand the yacht basin, build new
staff quarters and a new store and possibly build a new restaurant
and hotel on the island.
   The letter supports defense contentions that Lehder planned to
convert Norman's Cay into a tourist resort.
   Prosecutors have contended that Lehder closed Norman's Cay to
the public to protect the island as his cocaine-smuggling haven.
   Welman has been testifying in great detail about documents
relating to six of Lehder's companies.
   At times, members of the jury and spectators have become drowsy,
prompting U.S. District Judge Howell W. Melton to issue an
instruction to the jury.
   ``If you are becoming drowsy, let me know if you feel you have a
problem,'' said the judge, who told jurors he would then call a
short break.

   A loose fuel filter may have caused the engine
fire that forced a Horizon Air commuter plane to crash-land and
smash into a passenger terminal, airline and federal officials said.
   A high-pressure fuel filter from the wreckage appeared to be
loosely connected, as did another one found on a spare fuel
assembly at a Horizon Air facility, the officials said Tuesday.
   Three of the 19 people injured in Friday's accident remained
hospitalized today, one in serious but stable condition, the others
in satisfactory condition.
   Horizon Air President John Kelly said it was possible that a
loose fuel filter could allow vapors or fuel to collect and ignite,
but whether that happened in the plane that crashed won't be known
for certain until the investigation is complete.
   ``The fuel filter was not tight,'' said Kelly. ``It was slightly
backed away, which it should not be.''
   All airlines using de Havilland Dash 8 aircraft may be asked to
check their high-pressure fuel filters, said Bob Benson, who is
investigating the accident for the National Transportation Safety
Board.
   ``This may occur pretty shortly, but we're still in the process
of checking a lot of other things,'' he said.
   Horizon officials checked all of the airline's Dash 8 engines
over the weekend and did not find any other loose filters in the
twin-engine turboprops, Kelly said.
   But they also found the loose fuel filter in a spare assembly
``fresh from the box ... which we would not have had contact
with,'' Kelly said. The Federal Aviation Administration is
investigating, he said.
   Kelly said there was no connection between the latest engine
fire and one that was reported last June.
   He also said that different causes had been found for the fuel
leak that caused the engine fire in June and a case of reeking fuel
on April 8 in the engine that caught fire Friday. Maintenance was
performed, and no further complaints were received after the April
8 incident, Kelly said.
   In June, NTSB records say there was an explosion and fire in the
right engine just after takeoff from Sea-Tac. The pilot shut off
the engine, used two fire extinguishers to put out the blaze and
made an emergency landing at Boeing Field. No one was hurt.
   NTSB records show a third such Dash 8 engine fire in a Metro
Express Inc. plane that tried to take off Dec. 2, 1986, in Atlanta.
   In Atlanta, the Dash 8 had just taken off and had gained an
altitude of 4,000 feet when there was ``a loud pop'' and smoke and
fire in the right engine, NTSB records say.
   The plane first lost power, then the fire started. The pilot
shut down the engine, broke out fire extinguishers and was able to
land. There were no injuries.

   A developer who built a midtown skyscraper 11
feet too tall has reached a settlement with the city that allows
him to keep the extra footage if he constructs rehearsal space for
non-profit dance groups.
   The solution, announced Tuesday by both parties, will cost
developer Ian Bruce Eichner more than $2 million, said his lawyer,
Howard Hornstein.
   The city Planning Commission had refused in December to grant
retroactive approval for additions to Cityspire, a 72-story
building on West 56th Street.
   According to Hornstein, the floor slabs of the structure had to
be thickened by about 2 inches to increase the structure's
stability. As a result of this and some miscalculations, the luxury
condominium building wound up 813.53 feet high, as opposed to the
802.65 feet that had been approved.
   The settlement is subject to approval by the city's Landmarks
Preservation Commission, the city Planning Commission and the Board
of Estimate.

<HEAD>Beer Ban Effective Immediately To Head Off Giant Toga Party</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EUGENE, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   University of Oregon officials have banned
beer kegs at fraternities and sororities and made the order
effective immediately to head off a ``wild toga party,'' according
to a school official.
   Gerard Moseley, vice president for student affairs, said Tuesday
that the ban took effect when he and university President Paul Olum
issued a memo Monday.
   Moseley said the administration is trying to help university
housing organizations comply with state liquor laws.
   He said advance word about the tough new policy on alcohol
prompted some students to talk about ``closing the street ... for
one last big party,'' an event the administration wanted to avoid.
   The Oregon Liquor Control Commission has agreed to tell
distributors to notify the university any time a keg is purchased
for one of its housing organizations, Moseley said.
   ``People who buy a keg and take it someplace other than the
address they said they were going to take it are going to have
their own set of penalties to deal with, including seizure of the
vehicle used to transport it,'' he said.
   The ban prohibits bulk beer purchases, defined as ones made by
three or more students who pool their money to buy alcoholic
beverages.
   University-affiliated housing groups will also be required to
sponsor alcohol and drug educational programs at least twice each
academic year.
   Moseley said some housing groups include students over the age
of 21 but most have not reached legal drinking age. Attempts to get
the housing groups to police their parties have been unsuccessful,
he added.
   The university has an enrollment of about 17,500 students.

   Recent sweeps by police through gang-infested
areas have jammed juvenile detention centers, forcing hundreds of
youths to sleep on jail floors, authorities said.
   ``As we continue the sweeps, we need to take more steps to hold
these additional kids,'' Chief Probation Officer Barry J. Nidorf
told the Board of Supervisors on Tuesday.
   He urged approval of a $2 million expansion plan that would add
157 beds to the county's three juvenile detention facilities, which
currently have 1,317 beds.
   The board tentatively approved the expansion, which would be
accomplished by remodeling parts of each juvenile facility, and
asked Nidorf and Chief Administrative Officer Richard Dixon to find
a funding source.
   Nidorf said roundups of gang members and drug-related arrests
made by police officers and sheriff's deputies helped push the
juvenile jail population up to 2,006 last month, 52 percent above
capacity.
   Officials reduced that number by about 250 by suspending many
probation violations, shaving time for people in weekend work crews
and expanding home supervision programs.
   Still, as many as 450 inmates have had to sleep on mattresses on
the floor, Nidorf said. ``All the other services, such as
schooling, eating and recreation, are not impacted, and we have a
sufficient staff.''

   At times, it almost seemed that New York's
Democratic presidential primary had been reduced to a race between
two men: Jesse Jackson and Mayor Edward I. Koch.
   If so, Koch was clearly the loser.
   ``Mayor Koch made hysteria,'' said Jackson, after a strong
second-place showing Tuesday night. ``I made history.''
   Although Jackson lost the statewide race to Massachusetts Gov.
Michael Dukakis, he won narrowly in New York City despite bitter
attacks by Koch against Jackson. And the man the mayor endorsed,
Sen. Al Gore Jr., fared miserably.
   ``In this case you had a mayor with a strong supporting cast who
led the drive, using race and relgion as a litmus test,'' Jackson
said today on NBC's ``Today'' show.'
   ``Leadership has an obligation to set the moral tone, it has an
obligation to expand and build a coalition, to relieve people of
their fears and insecurities,'' Jackson said on ABC-TV's ``Good
Morning America.''
   He said the news media did not criticize the mayor when it would
have counted.
   During the campaign, Jackson had refused to comment on Koch's
attacks except to note New York's touchy state of race relations
and compare the mayor's comments to yelling fire in a crowded
theater.
   Koch, a man hardly given to humility, conceded Tuesday night
that his attacks on Jackson were apparently a mistake, given Gore's
defeat.
   ``I did my best and I failed, but the world ain't over,'' he
said.
   The world isn't over, but it may become a more difficult place
for Koch, who reiterated his intention to run for re-election next
year. Exit polls indicated that his hardball tactics may cost him
in 1989.
   Fifty-six percent of the voters surveyed in a CBS-New York Times
exit poll said they disagreed with Koch's criticism of Jackson. And
six of 10 voters polled by NBC said they don't want Koch to run for
re-election.
   The negative poll results also could have come from such factors
as a corruption scandal that has hung over Koch's third term and
racial tensions in the city.
   ``Ed Koch was certainly not a winner in this and he looks like a
big loser,'' said Doug Muzzio, an ABC pollster.
   Koch not only endorsed Gore, he campaigned alongside the senator
from Tennessee tirelessly. And it was Koch who captured headlines
with his strident attacks on Jackson.
   But Gore captured only 10 percent of the popular vote statewide
and nine percent in the city.
   Koch criticized Jackson's positions on Israel, saying Jews would
``have to be crazy'' to vote for him. The mayor then called Jackson
arrogant for failing to march in a Salute to Israel parade. The day
of the parade, he said Jackson ``can't stand stress, and then he
lies under stress.''
   Asked Tuesday night whether he would make the same remarks if he
could turn back the clock, Koch replied, ``Obviously, I would not
make them the way I did because, apparently, they were not helpful
to Al Gore.''
   Later, appearing on ABC-TV's ``Nightline,'' he added:
``Apparently the word `crazy' is not acceptable and I promise never
to use it again.''
   Although Gore thanked Koch for his help, he also seemed to
distance himself from the mayor's tactics. After congratulating
Jackson for his showing, Gore said, ``I didn't want to stop Jesse
Jackson. I just wanted to start Al Gore.''
   Jackson's campaign chairman, California Assembly Speaker Willie
Brown, credited Koch with improving Jackson's showing.
   ``If he had been more subtle about it, it may have been more
devastating to the Jackson campaign,'' Brown said. ``But the
flagrant display of anti-Jackson attitudes ... have embarrassed
some of the people in New York who may have been otherwise against
Jackson.''

   Michael Dukakis left New York triumphant today,
cautioning that his nomination is not yet inevitable but already
focusing on George Bush and the Republicans with a promise to
``take our message, the Democratic message, to every part of the
country.''
   ``Yesterday obviously was a wonderful day in New York,'' Dukakis
said at a morning news conference. ``I also know, however, that
nothing in the world is inevitable, and we've got much to do in the
Pennsylvania primary this week and the primaries to follow.''
   Dukakis launched his campaign in the next primary state,
Pennsylvania, even before the polls here had closed.
   ``This fall George Bush is going to be judged by a legacy of ...
pink slips for our workers, golden parachutes for high rollers and
greenmail for sharp operators on Wall Street,'' he said in
Philadelphia Tuesday night..
   ``I want to make that American dream come alive again, not only
in Trump Towers, not only in fancy apartments all over this
country, not only in a few privileged neighborhoods.''
   Dukakis said he spoke by telephone with Jesse Jackson early
today but said he declined an invitation to meet with Albert Gore
Jr., who may withdraw after his dismal third-place finish in New
York.
   ``I'm sure we'll be talking. He wanted to meet this morning and
I just couldn't do it,'' the Massachusetts governor said. ``I've
got to get back to Boston. I've got a very important meeting at 10
o'clock of my anti-crime council and a very full agenda and I just
had to get back there. ... He's a good guy and I've enjoyed getting
to know him and I respect him.''
   Dukakis said Gore's withdrawal from the race is ``something he
has to decide.'' He said he would be willing to help Gore or any
other candidate pay off campaign debts.
   The governor said Jackson called him with congratulations. Asked
if he would consider Jackson as a running mate, Dukakis said, ``I
wouldn't rule anything in or out.''
   Dukakis planned to resume campaigning Thursday in Ohio, which
has its primary in two weeks.
   Celebrating Tuesday night, he predicted the battle for the
Democratic presidential nomination will continue until the last
primaries.
   ``Today was a great day, but our job has just begun,'' Dukakis
told a buoyant crowd Tuesday night in the Manhattan hotel that
served as his headquarters.
   He returned to New York from Philadelphia to claim the victory
that moved him a giant step toward the nomination and likely will
narrow the race in the remaining states to just himself and Jesse
Jackson.
   ``Tomorrow we take our message ... to Pennsylvania and Ohio and
Indiana, and after that to Oregon and California and New Jersey and
the remaining primary states,'' he said. ``And after that, we will
take our message, the Democratic message, to every part of the
country.''
   In Philadelphia he unveiled a retooled campaign speech before a
crowd of more than 1,500 Democrats at a state party dinner. He
blasted the Republican vice president and linked him to privileged
excess and corporate greed _ themes he didn't mention as he
campaigned near Wall Street a day earlier.
   The dimensions of the Massachusetts governor's victory were
enough to make it likely Albert Gore Jr. would drop out of the race
and leave Dukakis the only white Democrat in the race with Jackson.
It was a victory that pushed him far ahead in the delegate race
and, while not yet close to a majority of delegates, gave him the
look of the likely nominee.
   Dukakis didn't claim that title for himself, however. Aides said
he would compete vigorously in the Pennsylvania primary next
Tuesday and in Ohio and Indiana the week after that. His
Pennsylvania chairman, Lanny Johnson, acknowledged Dukakis is at a
large advantage in that state as the only candidate with a full
slate of delegates on the ballot.

<HEAD>Controversy Surrounds Refusal To Air ``Untouchables'' On
University Station</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHARLESTON, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Instructors at Eastern Illinois
University are challenging a decision to ban ``The Untouchables''
from the campus television station.
   The Illinois Board of Governors of State Colleges and
Universities, which oversees the 10,000-student campus, voted 6-0
last Thursday to bar WEIU-TV from airing the series. Board member
Dominick Bufalino said ``The Untouchables'' was too violent and
created a negative stereotype of Italian-Americans.
   ``Why should we show a program that is controversial and is
offensive to a segment of our population?'' he said. ``We should be
educating, not teaching bigotry.''
   Robert Stack, who starred in the Emmy award-winning series from
1959 to 1963, called the ban ``ridiculous.''
   Stack portrayed Eliot Ness in ``The Untouchables,'' which
focused on the battles of Ness and other lawmen against Chicago
gangsters during Prohibition. A film version of the stories with
Kevin Costner as Ness just won an Academy Award for Sean Connery as
Best Supporting Actor.
   John Beabout, director of the university's Radio-TV Center, said
it was the first time the board had rejected funding for a series
on the station.
   Members of the university's Faculty Senate reacted angrily to
the ban Tuesday, calling it a violation of academic freedom, and
approved a resolution asking the board to reconsider its decision.
   Stack said he is leaving for Italy later this month to accept an
award for his role in the series, which he said is No. 1 in that
country.
   ``I find it highly ironic that the Italians are honoring `The
Untouchables' and the Americans are trying to censor it,'' he said.
   Several faculty members agreed.
   ``I could no longer teach `Romeo and Juliet' because it deals
with teen-agers and violence, according to the rationale of the
board,'' said English professor Michael Loudon.
   No state funds would have been used to buy 80 to 90 episodes for
the station. The $25,650 needed to air the program would have come
from a grant from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, but the
board must approve all university expenditures of more than $10,000.

<HEAD>Pope's Remains Recovered After Theft</HEAD>
<DATELINE>L'AQUILA, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police today recovered a 13th century
pope's mummified remains that were stolen from a cathedral three
days earlier.
   The remains of Celestine V, who resigned in 1294 after a
five-month papacy, were found in a plywood box hidden in the hollow
of a cemetery wall, authorities reported. Police said they found
the site by following suspected thieves, who got away.
   Church officials said the remains of the Roman Catholic pope,
stolen from the cathedral in the southern city of L'Aquila on
Sunday night, had not been damaged during the theft.
   The brief papacy of Celestine, who died in 1296, was marked by
subservience to Charles II, king of Naples. Acknowledging his
incompetence, Celestine declared that a pope had the right to
resign and did so.
   Celestine was canonized by Pope Clement V in 1313.
   Church bells pealed in L'Aquila and in Celestine's hometown of
Isernia to celebrate the recovery of the remains. The Vatican
newspaper had earlier reported the ``profound indignation in
L`Aquila for the grave sacrilegious act.''
   Police said they recovered the remains in the cemetery at
Amatrice, 40 miles south of L'Aquila, after following an
undisclosed number of suspects. The Italian news agency ANSA said
the suspects escaped as police concentrated on recovering the
remains.
   Authorities were looking for the suspects today.
   The thieves took the remains after forcing open a chapel door in
the Cathedral of Santa Maria di Collemaggio. Investigators
theorized they may have been planning to ask for a ransom, although
no demand had been reported.
   The L'Aquila archbishop's office said the remains would be
returned Monday to the cathedral, where they had been held since
1327, after an alarm system is installed.

   The missing U.S. Marine
helicopter that Iran claims to have shot down was on a night
mission in the Persian Gulf following day-long clashes between U.S.
and Iranian forces, U.S. officers said.
   The AH-1 Cobra gunship and its two-man crew failed to return to
the guided missile cruiser Wainwright from the Monday night flight.
The search continued today.
   A Navy spokesman, Lt. Cmdr. Mark Van Dyke, said there was no
evidence the helicopter was shot down.
   The gunship, regularly based aboard the dock landing ship
Trenton, flew support missions earlier Monday as U.S. forces
attacked two Iranian oil platforms in what the Reagan
administration called a measured response to Iran's mining of gulf
sea lanes and other hostile acts.
   Senior U.S. officers said Tuesday that the battle was over as
far as the United States was concerned, but there was no assurance
Iran felt the same way.
   Capt. Donald Dyer, who commands a U.S. destroyer group in the
gulf, said the situation remained tense, ``but I think it's
beginning to back off a little bit.'' He said the Iranians took
some heavy losses.
   Cmdr. Edward Mann, skipper of this frigate that flies the flag
of Dyer's command, said he was surprised by Iran's response Monday.
Mann said he did not believe Iran would cease its attacks on
neutral commercial shipping.
   U.S. officers appeared satisfied with the outcome of the series
of clashes Monday that began with the platform attacks about 8 a.m.
   In the course of it, Iran fired five missiles at the Jack
Williams and two destroyers sailing with it. Navy officers aboard
ship said they were Chinese-made Silkworm missiles fired from
anti-ship batteries along the Strait of Hormuz for the first time,
but the Pentagon said it has not determined what type of missile
was fired.
   All five missiles went awry, their guidance systems confused by
aluminum chaff fired into the air by the U.S. ships.
   A sixth missile was reported fired from the Faw Peninsula of
southern Iraq, but the result was not known to officers here.
   Van Dyke said there were no American casualties in Monday's
warfare and Iranian casualties were not known.
   The United States claimed one Iranian patrol boat sunk, three
speedboats sunk or damaged, and two frigates disabled. In addition,
Van Dyke said, the two oil platforms at Sirri and Sassan, in the
south-central gulf, were neutralized.
   Both platforms had been used for military purposes, including
support for speedboats that attack neutral shipping, the United
States said. Iran has justified its attacks on merchant shipping
saying they are in retaliation for Iraqi attacks on its own oil
tankers.
   Iran and Iraq have been at war for 7{ years.
   U.S. officials said the Iranians were advised by radio of U.S.
intentions before they were attacked.
   Iranians at Sirri and Sassan were given five minutes to evacuate
before the shellings began. Both platforms were bombarded before
Marines from the Trenton went aboard Sassan and destroyed it with
demolition charges.
   When an Iranian tugboat at Sirri radioed the Wainwright for
permission to pick up survivors in the water, Capt. James.
Chandler, who commands the cruiser, agreed and also dropped
lifeboats.
   Minutes later, the Joshan, one of Iran's fast, Seakiller
missile-equipped patrol boats, raced toward the Wainwright and was
warned by its skipper that if it approached any closer, ``It is my
intention to sink you.''
   The Iranian boat then fired a missile at the Wainwright, which
launched chaff. The Simpson fired an SM-1 missile that blew the
patrol boat apart.
   U.S. officiers said the two Iranian frigates, Sahand and
Sabalan, also fired on U.S. aircraft after ignoring warnings
against taking hostile action.
   Also, Iranian speedboats and a helicopter attacked an
American-run oil rig in the Mubarak oil field off the United Arab
Emirates and damaged the American resupply vessel Willie Tide.
   An A-6 Intruder fighter jet from the carrier Enterprise attacked
the speedboats and at least one was sunk, the others damaged.
   The Jack Williams and two destroyers were speeding back into the
gulf from the Strait of Hormuz when they received word the Sahand
and at least eight speedboats were approaching from Iran's naval
base at Bandar Abbas, 30 miles to the north.
   ``The Sahand is in your vicinity. Take him,'' was the terse
message from Rear. Adm. Anthony Less, commander of the Joint Task
Force Middle East.
   U.S. officers said two A-6s drew missile fire from the Sahand
and retaliated with Harpoon missiles that damaged the 12-year-old,
British-built frigate.
   Then the USS Joseph Strauss, sailing just ahead of the Jack
Williams, fired another Harpoon, blasting the ship from 20 miles
away. When last seen, it was listing badly with a hole in its hull
and its superstructure ablaze. Whether it sank was not known, Van
Dyke said.
   The Sabalan was hit by F-14 Tomcats, also flying off the
Enterprise in the Arabian Sea. It was hit by a laser-guided skipper
bomb and left dead in the water. Its fate also was unknown.

   Three of four U.S. sailors
injured when a frigate hit a mine in the Persian Gulf last week
left today for further treatment in the United States, military
officials said.
   The sailors, two of them in serious condition, were flown by
helicopter from the U.S. Army Medical Center in Landstuhl to
Frankfurt's Rhein Main Air Base, said U.S. Air Force spokesmen
Capt. Dave Shaw.
   They then boarded a C-141 aircraft that left for the United
States at 12:30 p.m. (5:30 a.m. EDT), Shaw said.
   The men were to be flown to Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland
and then on to Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio, Texas.
   They were identified as Seaman Apprentice Wayne Smith, 18, of
Clearview, Pa., Petty Officer 3.C. David Burbine, 23, of Ashaway,
R.I., and Petty Officer 2.C. Larry Welch, 26, of Ohio, said Marie
Shaw, a spokeswoman for Landstuhl Army hospital.
   Smith is in stable condition and recovering well, she said.
Burbine and Welch are in serious but stable condition.
   The spokeswoman said Chief Petty Officer Alex Perez, 38, of
Ports Breath, R.I., was being kept at the hopital in Landstuhl
``because he is very tired.''
   Perez suffered serious back injuries, Mrs. Shaw said, but was in
stable condition.
   The men, who arrived at the hospital Sunday, were among ten U.S.
military personnel injured when the U.S. Navy frigate Samuel B.
Roberts struck a mine in the Persian Gulf last Thursday.
   U.S. officials have said the mines in the gulf were laid by Iran.
   Smith, who had been on the frigate for less than a month,
described the blast in an interview that appeared in today's
editions of the unofficial U.S. Armed Forces newspaper, Stars and
Stripes.
   When the captain announced that three mines had been spotted,
Smith said he wondered if there were more that had gone undetected,
the newspaper reported.
   ``I was kind of thinking how it would be if they could miss one
if it was underneath the water,'' the newspaper quoted him as
saying.
   Smith and Burbine were at their stations in the engine room,
which turned into an inferno when the mine exploded, the newspaper
said.
   ``I tried to close my eyes and tried to hit the ground to keep
the fire from burning me,'' Smith was quoted as saying. ``I was
afraid of a lot of things, you know, if the ship went down, having
to swim while being burned like I was.''

<HEAD>Reports on Cause of Crash Differ Sharply</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three key parties to the crash of Northwest
Flight 255 have prepared sharply differing reports on the causes of
the accident that killed 156 people last summer, The Detroit News
reported today.
   The investigation of the Aug. 16, 1987 crash at Detroit's
airport has centered on the position of wing flaps and slats that
provide lift for takeoff.
   The reports by the maker of the jet, the pilot's union and the
airline will be considered by the National Transportation Safety
Board at hearings next month, the newspaper said.
   Douglas Aircraft Co., maker of the MD-80 jetliner, in its
report, blamed shoddy pilot performance, accusing the crew of
``acute negligence'' and a ``casual attitude toward cockpit
discipline,'' the newspaper said.
   The crew failed to set the plane's wing flaps, but Douglas said
the root cause of the crash was the crew's failure to perform a
pre-flight check of flap settings.
   Douglas dismissed charges that a circuit breaker may have caused
a malfunction in an audible warning system that should have alerted
the crew to the flap problem.
   Northwest Airlines' report blames the failure of the flap
warning system for the crash, the newspaper said. The airline said
a circuit breaker contaminated by tarnish on electrical contact
points caused the failure.
   Though Douglas agreed that the circuit breaker showed a buildup
of tarnish, the company disagreed that the tarnish interrupted
power. Douglas said the crew purposely disconnected the warning
system and forgot to reset it.
   Northwest also said the plane probably would not have crashed if
one of its wings had not been sheared off partially by a
48-foot-tall light pole at the end of the runway that the airline
suggested was taller than the Federal Aviation Administration
allows.
   The plane didn't gain enough altitude to avoid hitting the light
pole in a parking lot. It burst into flames, crashing on a road
near the airport and slamming an overpass.
   Only 5-year-old Cecelia Cichan survived the crash, the
second-worst aviation disaster in U.S. history.
   The Air Line Pilots Association, the pilots union, said the
plane's flaps and slats were not extended because of an unspecified
mechanical failure or because the pilots were distracted and forgot
to set them.
   ALPA also said it had examined Northwest maintenance records on
the plane for the previous 15 months before the crash and found
``continuing problems with the flap-slat positioning and indicating
system .... ''
   The NTSB is scheduled to vote on the probable cause of the crash
at a public hearing May 10 in Washington, D.C. The board's own
analysis is incomplete, NTSB spokesman Alan Pollock said.
   The reports by Northwest, Douglas and ALPA seek to persuade the
NTSB to adopt at least part of their versions in hopes of limiting
potential damage to their reputations.
   The reports also seek to minimize exposure to scores of lawsuits
filed by relatives of those who died in the crash. Although the
NTSB's determination of probable cause will be inadmissible in
court, it could help plaintiff's lawyers plan their legal attacks.
   At the hearing, the NTSB also will consider recommending that
the FAA adopt new or revised aviation safety rules.

   Iran today told all volunteers to report
for duty and put its bases on alert to face what it called
``bestial aggression'' from the United States and Iraq. Kuwait said
Iran fired a missile into its territory before dawn.
   Iran said it launched a new thrust into northeastern Iraq, and
both Iran and Iraq reported exchanging air strikes.
   Shipping executives said commercial vessels were avoiding the
Persian Gulf and Iranian warships were reportedly staying in port.
   The U.S. Navy sank or damaged six Iranian vessels and destroyed
two offshore oil platforms Monday in the heaviest fighting with the
Iranians since the U.S. Navy began escorting Kuwaiti ships in the
gulf last July.
   Kuwait's Defense Ministry gave no details of where the
``Scud-type'' missile exploded today or whether it caused
casualties or damage, but said: ``Kuwait has the full right to take
what it sees as appropriate measures toward this new aggression,
directed against its territories.''
   A source who spoke on condition of anonymity said the missile
fell near desert oilfield operated by Getty Oil in the vicinity of
Wafra, on the Saudi border.
   Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati of Iran, in a message
reported on Tehran Radio today, said: ``The government of Kuwait is
responsible for all the consequences of its support for the
aggressive Iraqi regime'' in the gulf war.
   Velayati's statement was in a message to the Organization of the
Islamic Conference accusing Kuwait of giving financial and other
support to Iraq. The radio, monitored in Cyprus, did not say when
the message was sent.
   The Scud is a Soviet-designed surface-to-surface missile with a
range of about 180 miles. Iran has used such missiles against Iraq
in the 7{-year-old gulf war.
   Iran last year fired several Chinese-made Silkworm missiles into
Kuwait's coastal waters from the Faw peninsula.
   Tehran Radio, announcing the nationwide mobilization, declared:
``Today our revolution and our heroic nation is faced with the
onslaught of the evil triangle of America, Iraq and the
reactionaries.''
   It said all volunteers should report to their bases throughout
the country ``and get ready for departure'' to the battlefront. The
broadcast did not mention numbers, but Iranian leaders have claimed
more than 3 million Iranians have undergone military training in
the last six months.
   The radio added: ``At this critical juncture, in order to
respond to the bestial aggression of America and regional
reactionaries, all basij (volunteer) forces'' should immediately
report for duty.
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in
Cyprus, said Iranian forces killed or wounded 300 Iraqis and
captured more than 250 in the Shemiran mountain region of Kurdistan
in the new offensive.
   The agency said Iranian warplanes bombed ``military and economic
targets'' in the northern Iraqi city of Erbil soon after dawn
today, causing ``heavy'' damage and casualties. The Iraqis reported
civilian casualties but gave no numbers.
   IRNA said Iraqi warplanes bombed residential areas of the
western cities of Dezful, Hamedan and Boroujerd, causing civilian
casualties.
   Iraq claimed its forces were mopping up Iranian pockets of
resistance in the Faw peninsula, which it recaptured this week.
Iran seized control of the strategic peninsula two years ago.
   The search continued today for a U.S. Marine attack helicopter
and its two-man crew, missing since going out on a night mission
following Monday's fighting.
   There was no estimate of Iranian casualties Monday, but Navy
officers said they presumed them to be heavy.
   Iran has maintained the U.S. attacks on Iranian oil platforms
were planned in concert with Iraq.
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz, denying that assertion,
insisted the United States is neutral in the gulf war and said the
American presence in the gulf is ``non-confrontational.''
   The Reagan adminstration said it attacked the Iranian oil
platforms in retaliation for the mine that damaged the USS Samuel
B. Roberts last week, wounding 10 crewmen. The Navy said other
Iranian targets were fired on only after they threatened U.S.
forces.
   President Reagan said there was no doubt Iran planted the mine
that damaged the Roberts. He said it was quieter in the gulf
Tuesday and ``we hope it continues that way.''
   One gulf-based marine salvage executive said the gulf appeared
``ghostly'' today from lack of shipping. He and others, who spoke
on condition of anonymity, said commercial vessels were avoiding
the waterway.

<TEXT>
   It can get mighty lonely in the New
Hampshire woods, as an 18-year-old female pony named Princess has
discovered.
   For the last five months, Princess has been the object of
affection of a 900-pound bull moose nearly twice her size. However,
a man photographing the unlikely pair believes the relationship is
maternal.
   ``He even tries to follow the pony into the barn. He thinks she
is his mother,'' said Herbie Ainsworth of Gilmanton, who refuses to
disclose the farm's location for fear that someone might shoot the
moose.
   The moose, nicknamed Prince, stays in the pasture all day
watching the pony and then returns the next morning, he said
recently. The farm's owners don't feed the moose, though it often
tries to enter the barn for a bite of hay.
   It's rare for a moose to be attracted to domestic livestock, but
not unheard of.
   In 1986, a Vermont heifer named Jessica attracted the affections
of a bull moose for a 76-day romance that sparked interest
nationwide before he resumed his life in the wild.
   Kristine Klein, a state biologist, said that a cow moose drives
away its calf when the youngster is about a year old, and that
after being abandoned, a young moose occasionally will attach
itself to another moose or to domestic livestock.

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Deadly complications of stroke-prevention
surgery could be reduced by a new method using a laser beam to
clear blocked neck arteries, says a doctor who reported performing
the procedure for the first time.
   The surgery, performed last Friday on a 72-year-old California
man, ``represents the first time laser light has been applied to
the treatment of carotid artery disease,'' said Dr. John Eugene,
who worked with cardiovascular surgeon Richard Ott.
   ``I feel excellent, and I think the operation was quite a
success,'' the patient, Kenneth B. Smith, said Tuesday by telephone
from his San Clemente home. ``The neck is a little sore from the
incision, but otherwise I'm fine.''
   Smith was discharged Monday from the University of California
Irvine Medical Center in Orange.
   For more than two weeks before the operation, Smith suffered up
to a dozen ``transient ischemic attacks,'' nicknamed
``mini-strokes,'' because his left carotid artery _ one of two main
neck arteries supplying blood to the brain _ was 85 percent to 90
percent blocked by fatty deposits called plaque.
   Because the blockage impeded blood flow to Smith's brain, he
suffered repeated, temporary paralysis of his right arm, leg and
hand and the right side of his face, and faced the possibility of a
massive, possibly deadly stroke, caused either by the blockage or a
loosened piece of plaque, Eugene said.
   Surgery to clear such blockages is called carotid
endarterectomy. In conventional surgery, the neck is cut open, the
artery is exposed and a knife is used to remove the plaque, then
the artery and neck are closed.
   But in the operation performed by Eugene and Ott, a low-power
beam from an argon ion laser was aimed between the plaque and
underlying artery wall to remove the plaque cleanly, Eugene said.
   ``We feel it offers a substantial advantage over the knife
technique because we leave a smooth artery surface with the layers
of the artery welded together by the laser beam,'' he said.
   Rand Corp. researchers reported last month in the New England
Journal of Medicine that 10 percent of elderly Americans who
undergo conventional carotid endarterectomy die or suffer strokes
as a direct result of the surgery, which has been criticized as
being overused.
   Eugene said the laser approach should reduce such fatal
complications because it repairs the artery wall and reduces the
odds that debris will break off from it to cause a stroke.
   However, Dr. Sam Ahn, a vascular surgeon at the University of
California, Los Angeles, said the success of such surgery depends
more on the surgeon than the equipment used, so he was skeptical if
complication rates really would be reduced, since they already are
quite low at major medical centers.
   He said the laser surgery ``is the first reported, as far as I
know.''
   The new method has been under development since 1982 at
UC-Irvine, and doctors hope to use it by year's end to clear
blocked heart arteries, Eugene said, adding he previously used it
to clear blocked leg and arm arteries.
   The method differs from another technique in which a
laser-tipped catheter is inserted into an artery to clear
blockages. That technique hasn't been used on carotid arteries
because it poses a higher risk of causing a piece of plaque to
break off and trigger a stroke, Eugene said.

   Smith College student activists say
that the college president's response to their grievances is
inadequate, and they are planning to meet with a federal official
about campus racism.
   ``We've heard a lot of talk. We need to see something solid,''
Jennifer Fleming, a member of Concerned Students of All Colors,
said Tuesday.
   President Mary Maple Dunn released her response to the 18
grievances that dozens of members of the ad hoc student group had
delivered to her in a protest march on her house Sunday.
   The students, in their list, decried the dearth of minorities
among faculty, staff and administrators and complained that
students had been excluded from the search for an affirmative
action officer, among other things.
   The group threatened to file a civil rights complaint with the
Hampshire County district attorney and a discrimination complaint
with the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination if nothing
was done about their grievances.
   Wambui Mwangi, a sophomore who is among the students who helped
draw up the grievances, said Tuesday that Ms. Dunn's response was
inadequate.
   The students said they intended to keep their scheduled meeting
today with a community relations specialist from the Justice
Department and to hold a general meeting at 4:30 p.m. Friday to
discuss Ms. Dunn's response.
   In a statement prefacing her point-by-point response, Ms. Dunn
described the grievances as ``long-standing complaints which have
been brought to the attention of the administration before.''
   She added, however, ``we think it only fair that students
acknowledge that some steps to redress these grievances have been
taken.'' She said Tuesdy she planned to meet with students in the
near future.
   Among her responses, she:
   _Acknowledged ``the faculty is nearly all-white, that no people
of color hold top administrative posts, that minorities are
underrepresented at all levels of influence.'' She said, however,
that the college would follow minority hiring goals set by a
still-to-be-hired affirmative action officer.
   _Countered students' claims of exclusion from the search for the
officer by saying student leaders had been invited to interview
finalists and students had never before expressed interest in
serving on search committees.
   _Announced she would create the post of ombudsperson to serve as
an advocate against discrimination.
   Ms. Fleming said students have met often with Ms. Dunn about
minority concerns.
   ``The point of the protest was to get reaction, not to get Mary
to talk to us again,'' she said. ``It was a show of strength, of
frustration.''
   She said the group consisted of an ``indefinite'' number of
students and was ``formed simply to protest. Whoever wants to can
join.''
   A report issued last month by a faculty group called Committee
on Community Policy recommended that the college try to make the
faculty 20 percent minority within five years. Currently, 5 percent
of employees are members of minority groups.
   The study also said that minority recruitment and enrollment as
a whole is increasing, but black enrollments have been declining at
a significant rate for years.

<TEXT>
   Cardinal John O'Connor of New York met with
government and church leaders on the first day of his visit to this
Communist nation, with all sides expressing hope his visit will
help improve U.S-Cuban relations.
   O'Connor is spending four days in Cuba as a guest of the Roman
Catholic Church to celebrate the 200th anniversary of the birth of
the Rev. Felix Varela. The priest, who served in New York City from
1823 to 1853, is considered a Cuban hero in the struggle against
Spanish colonial rule.
   ``It is my hope that Felix Varela will form a bridge _ a bridge
between the church in Cuba and the church in New York,'' O'Connor
told reporters when he arrived in Havana Tuesday, after stops in
the Dominican Republic and the Cuban city of Santiago.
   ``And who knows, when there is a strong bridge between the two
churches, then perhaps many others can go back and forth across
that bridge,'' O'Connor added.
   ``And other kinds of peaceful reunions may take place between
two people who are separated by such a small body of water and who
together dream of peace.''
   O'Connor is the first American cardinal to visit this Caribbean
island nation, just 90 miles from Florida, since Fidel Castro came
to power in 1959.
   The Roman Catholic prelate was to say Mass tonight after a day
of meetings with church leaders and U.S. officials in Havana. The
nature of those talks has not been announced. O'Connor said earlier
he could not presume that Castro will see him, but he would accept
such an invitation.
   At a Vatican Embassy reception Tuesday night, O'Connor mingled
with Cuban Vice President Carlos Rafael Rodriguez, Archbishop Jaime
Ortega and officials of the U.S. Interest Section, a diplomatic
post set up in Havana because there are no formal U.S.-Cuban
relations.
   Rodriguez, a member of the Communist Party Politburo, echoed
O'Connor's comments.
   ``This bridge is necessary not because there are hostile
relations, (but) because there are none,'' said Rodriguez.
   He said Americans have a false image of Cuba and ``it's
necessary to rectify it. I think that the cardinal's visit
contributes to rectifying that image.''
   O'Connor hugged Ortega when he got off a plane that carried him
to the capital from Santiago, the coastal city in southeastern Cuba
where he began his visit Monday.
   The cardinal said the thunderous applause he received in
Santiago convinced him that years of religious restrictions in Cuba
had not dampened the spirit of believers in this officially atheist
nation.

   Following the lead of its athletic
department, Dartmouth College is offering free air fare to top
freshmen applicants still undecided about whether to attend the Ivy
League school.
   ``We have actively recruited athletes for years,'' said
Dartmouth President James Freedman. ``Now we want to invest the
same energy in bringing intellectually ambitious students to the
college.''
   The Presidential Scholars program offers the top 187 accepted
freshmen free air fare to visit the campus this month before
deciding whether to enroll. Faculty members are personally inviting
each of the students.
   A faculty committee chose the top students and established the
program.
   The college this year received 10,200 applications for a 1988
freshman class of about 1,100.
   Dartmouth also is targeting women and minorities who have been
accepted but still are making up their minds. This year, the
admissions office organized a telethon to contact women who had
been accepted.
   Women now account for about 39 percent of the student body at
Dartmouth, and Freedman and trustees have called for a significant
increase.

   Kuwaitis hailed the release of 31 hostages and the
end of the 16-day hijacking of a Kuwaiti jumbo jet in Algeria today
as a victory for their government's firm stand against terrorism.
   The Kuwaiti government had steadfastly refused to meet the
gunmen's demand it free 17 convicted pro-Iranian extremists.
   The state radio broke into its regular programs to announce the
release.
   Ali Khaled Al-Sabah, a member of Kuwait's ruling family and the
brother of three royal family members among the freed captives,
told The Associated Press: ``My happiness in indescribable. I feel
as if my brother and two sisters have been resurrected from an
inevitable doom.
   ``We feel deeply indebted to the Kuwaiti leadership and the
government of Algeria,'' he said in a telephone interview.
   Algerian officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
hijackers left the Kuwait Airways Boeing 747 about 20 minutes
before the hostages were freed. They said the gunmen were taken by
unmarked cars to an undisclosed location.
   An official source in Kuwait, also speaking privately, said the
hijackers were promised safe passage to an undisclosed location.
   The gunmen left Algiers for an unknown destination, sources in
the Persian Gulf told The Associated Press. The Kuwait News Agency
said no deal was struck with the hijackers except for safe conduct
to Iran or Lebanon.
   The government thanked Algeria for its help and but condemned
the hijackers' ``cowardly'' operation as part of a plot to distract
the Arab world.
   The radio broadcast a special song glorifying the emir of
Kuwait, Sheik Jaber Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah, and his government for their
``triumph'' over terrorism.
   People telephoned the radio and state-run television network to
ask for news of the hostages.
   Many people called in to congratulate the government on its firm
stand against the hijackers, who had killed two Kuwaiti passengers.
The plane was seized April 5 on a flight from Bangkok to Kuwait
with 112 people aboard.
   ``This is a happy moment for the nation,'' a radio announcer
declared. ``We congratulate ourselves, our government and our emir,
and we offer the leadership garlands of roses and jasmine.''
   Television technicians and announcers were summoned to broadcast
live satellite coverage of the release of the 24 passengers and
seven crew members in Algiers.
   A special Kuwait Airways jet was expected to fly to Algiers and
bring back the freed passengers and crew members later today or
Thursday.
   The 17 men whose freedom the hijackers sought were convicted and
imprisoned for the December 1983 bombings of the French and U.S.
embassies in Kuwait.
   The Cabinet, meeting in emergency session shortly after the
ordeal ended, told Kuwaitis that their ``courageous stand and
solidarity with the leadership ... provides a striking example to
people of the world in steadfastness versus terrorism and the firm
rejection of blackmail.''
   Minister of State for Cabinet Affairs Rashed Abdel-Aziz
al-Rashed said the government ``expressed deep gratitude for the
efforts made by Algerian officials, foremostly president Chadli
Bendjedid and officials of the Palestine Liberation Organization,
including chairman Yasser Arafat.''
   Arafat and the PLO began their mediation effort when the
commandeered plane landed at Larnaca, Cyprus, on April 8.
   Kuwait also thanked ``all sister and friendly states'' for their
support during the ordeal.
   `While the Cabinet praises the Almighty for the ending of the
ordeal, it emphasizes that this cowardly operation and the series
of criminal acts of terrorism witnessed by the Arab world are but
part of a blueprint that seeks to undermine the security of the
Arab nation and preoccupy it with such acts to distract its
attention from its issues of destiny,'' al-Rashed said. He did not
elaborate.

   Congressional Democrats today met behind the
closed doors of the House to make final decisions on sending 250
delegates from Capitol Hill to their party's national convention.
   Before the opening of today's House Democratic Caucus, which was
considered largely a formality, Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis
already was in line to receive 26 of the House delegates.
   The Dukakis campaign was predicting no flood of endorsements
following Tuesday's New York primary victory.
   ``I don't see a deluge,'' said Susan Brophy, who handles
delegate selection for the campaign.
   Rep. Norman Mineta, D-Calif., a Dukakis supporter, said today
that Dukakis had scored ``a decisive win in New York but we still
have major states in Pennsylvania and Ohio.''
   In all, 205 of the 207 House delegates were nominated last week.
The remaining two were picked today.
   Twenty-six of the House members nominated last week said they
were backing Dukakis for the Democratic presidential nomination,
while 15 were supporting Jesse Jackson, 11 were for Tennessee Sen.
Albert Gore Jr., and 10 were for Illinois Sen. Paul Simon. Another
143 were uncommitted.
   On Tuesday, Democrats in the Senate held a ceremonial vote to
pick their 43 national convention delegates. The real decisions
were made last week and were based in many cases on seniority.
   The 250 delegates from Capitol Hill will be among 643 ``super
delegates'' to attend the Democratic National Convention in
Atlanta. These delegates, who include governors and members of the
Democratic National Committee, receive their convention credentials
based on offices they now hold or used to have.
   Only New York's primary on Tuesday and California's on June 7
offer more delegates than the behind-the-scenes ``primary'' on
Capitol Hill.
   Dukakis is working hard to swing those unpledged _ and mostly
uncommitted _ delegates into his camp as he seeks the 2,081 votes
needed to win in Atlanta.
   Dukakis has the backing of 13 senators, while Gore won seven
votes on the Senate list, including his own.
   Simon, whose campaign is on hold, managed to win only a seat for
himself and the backing of fellow Illinois Sen. Alan Dixon.
Twenty-one senator-delegates were uncommitted.
   Jesse Jackson had no announced supporters among the senators
chosen Tuesday.
   ``We were pleased that we were able to accommodate almost every
Democratic member who requested to be an unpledged delegate,'' said
Senate Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia. He said
only two who wanted to go did not get seats, but he did not name
them.
   In addition to the 250 congressional slots, 362 votes will be
cast by members of the Democratic National Committee and 26 by
Democratic governors. Five former party leaders also have automatic
seats at the convention.
   Dukakis, who leads in the overall delegate count, also leads
among super delegates interviewed by The Associated Press, 103.65
to 46.55 for Gore, 45.1 for Jackson and 28.5 for Simon. A total of
416.25 are uncommitted and three delegate slots were vacant.

<HEAD>Documents Show FBI Got Reports From Moon Group</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The FBI collected information about a group
critical of U.S. policy in Central America that was provided by an
affiliate of the Rev. Sun Myung Moon's Unification Church, The
Boston Globe reported today.
   Members of the Collegiate Association for the Resarch of
Principles, which is affiliated with Moon's church, sent the FBI
reports about the Committee in Solidarity with the People of El
Salvador, according to documents released by the FBI in response to
a Freedom of Information request.
   FBI agent Ray McIllhaney said he could not comment on how the
information was used or why it was kept in FBI files, the newspaper
said.
   The documents deal only with the Moon affiliate's communications
to the FBI in 1981 and indicate that members on at least 10
campuses sent material to the FBI.
   The identities of those who sent the information were blacked
out of the released documents, the newspaper said.
   Congressional testimony and published reports indicated that
another group, also sponsored by the Moon organization, was
involved in fund-raising and training for Nicaraguan Contra rebels
through Lt. Col. Oliver North's private aid network, the Globe said.
   One report to the FBI from a Collegiate Association member in
Santa Barbara, Calif., said a supporter of the anti-Reagan policy
group ``tried to convince me that the Soviet Union is not involved
in El Salvador, yet he freely admits the role of Cuba,'' the
released documents show.
   A spokesman at Collegiate Association headquarters in New York,
who did not identify himself, told the Globe that allegations that
members worked with the FBI are ``junk. If you write that, I will
tell my friends in Boston not to buy your newspaper.''
   McIlhaney said the FBI's use of unsolicited material from
outside sources depends on its relevance and appropriateness to the
agency. He said the agency regularly receives unsolicited material
from various people and organizations about various things.

   Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians
today mourned PLO military commander Khalil al-Wazir when he was
buried in a cemetery at Syria's largest refugee camp.
   Al-Wazir, 52, better known as Abu Jihad, was assassinated
Saturday by commandos who burst into his home in suburban Tunis.
Israeli sources have said Israeli security forces carried out the
attack. There has been no confirmation by the Israeli government.
   The Palestinian leader's coffin, draped in a Palestinian flag,
was carried by a gun carriage from the morgue at Mouwasat Hospital
to the Martyrs Cemetery at Yarmouk refugee camp.
   The mass funeral was attended by al-Wazir's mother, wife and
five children and top Palestinian Liberation Organization figures.
   PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat and Libyan leader Col. Moammar
Gadhafi, who were said to be on their way to Damascus to attend the
funeral, did not attend. But Palestinian officials said they
expected Arafat and Gadhafi to arrive later in the day.
   Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians marched behind al-Wazir's
coffin when it left the hospital before noon under heavy Syrian
protection.
   Thousands of other Palestinians, chanting slogans and flashing
``V'' for victory, stood on both sides of the road as the convoy
drove across Damascus' main Baramki thoroughfare.
   ``You are the martyr of the uprising,'' shouted the marchers,
referring to the 4{ months of Palestinian rioting in the
Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Al-Wazir, born in Ramleh in what is now Israel, became a key
aide and comrade-in-arms to Arafat, and some observers saw him as
the guerrilla leader's heir apparent.
   A close aide to al-Wazir, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said Abu Jihad was the leader of the Palestinian uprising in the
occupied territories.
   ``The loss of our great hero Abu Jihad will not put an end to
the uprising. Abu Jihad left a school behind,'' the aide said.
   ``Abu Jihad has been recruiting young men and women since the
PLO left Beirut in the 1982 Israeli invasion. These cadres have
been tried out in several operations, where they proved to be
capable inside and outside Palestine,'' the aide added.
   A Tunisian government inquiry concluded al-Wazir was gunned down
by an Israeli commando team.
   Arafat has been at odds with Syrian President Hafez Assad since
1983, when he and al-Wazir were expelled from Damascus after a
Syrian-backed mutiny in the PLO ranks. Gadhafi, who only recently
reconciled with Arafat after a split, is a close ally of Assad's.
   Al-Wazir's body arrived in Syria from Tunisia on Tuesday aboard
a PLO-chartered plane. He was brought to Syria for burial because
he had asked to be buried near Palestine and his parents live in
Damascus.

   Jury selection has been completed in the federal
trial of a woman accused of lacing over-the-counter drug capsules
with cyanide that killed two people, including her husband.
   Stella Nickell, 44, is charged with two counts of causing a
death by product tampering.
   Bruce Nickell, 52, and Susan Katherine Snow, 40, both of Auburn,
died after taking poisoned capsules of Extra-Strength Excedrin in
June 1986. Authorities have suggested no other link between the
victims.
   Lawyers said the trial is the first under federal law for
tampering with over-the-counter drug capsules.
   Mrs. Nickell also is charged with three counts of tampering with
a product involved in interstate commerce in the tainting of
capsules in two Extra-Strength Excedrin bottles and an Anacin-3
bottle that were recovered in stores in Kent and Auburn, suburbs
between Seattle and Tacoma.
   The deaths resulted in a nationwide tampering scare, and
Excedrin manufacturer Bristol-Myers recalled all its
non-prescription medicine sold in capsule form.
   The government alleges Mrs. Nickell killed her husband to
collect $176,000 in life insurance benefits, then put tainted
pain-relief capsules in stores to draw suspicion away from herself.
   Attorneys for both sides said pre-trial news coverage of the
case didn't seem to have influenced the jury pool. Selection was
completed Tuesday.

   A group Soviet officials visited this ski
resort community to inspect some of the recreational facilities
that will be available to Soviet inspectors stationed in Utah as
part of an arms limitation agreement.
   The Soviet group spent a relaxed afternoon Tuesday, looking at
storefront windows and eating lunch at a Mexican restaurant.
   Igor Khripunov, first secretary at the Soviet Embassy in
Washington, said the proposed treaty indicates a growing confidence
and trust in the relationship between the two superpowers
   The Intermediate Nuclear Forces agreement ``demonstrates the
bilateral relationship between our two countries is moving into a

Khripunov said.
   The Soviet team will be stationed at the Hercules Inc. Bacchus

team will be stationed at Votkinsk in the Soviet Union.
   The Soviets would verify that Pershing 2 missiles were no longer

SS-20 missiles no longer were being assembled.
   The Soviets were particularly amused by a window display of a
stuffed rattlesnake next to a pair of rattlesnake cowboy boots. A
U.S. official said that when the Soviets toured the grassy
perimeter of the Hercules plant Monday, they were warned about
rattlesnakes.
   Asked if U.S. inspectors would face similar dangers at Votkinsk,
near the Ural Mountains, Khripunov said: ``We can't offer anything
as exciting as rattlesnakes. Just cold and snow, I guess.''

   U.S. Ambassador John Kelly said today his
embassy could not confirm reports that kidnapped U.S. Marine Lt.
Col. William R. Higgins was killed by his pro-Iranian captors.
   ``We have no information that would confirm those reports. We
cannot deny those reports, but no one knows the truth,'' he said.
   The Christian-controlled Voice of Lebanon radio station said
Monday that Higgins was killed before the Syrian-backed Shiite
Moslem Amal militia captured the south Lebanon hamlet of Siddiqine
from the Iranian-backed Hezbollah early this month.
   The Organization of the Oppressed on Earth, a Shiite faction
believed to be linked to Hezbollah, claimed it kidnapped Higgins,
43, of Danville, Ky., on Feb. 17.
   Kelly spoke to reporters after an hourlong meeting with acting
Prime Minister Salim Hoss during which they discussed the latest
Middle East peace initiative of Secretary of State George Shultz,
officials said.
   The two also discussed U.S.-Syrian efforts to arrange an
agreement for a new distribution of political power in Lebanon
aimed at ending the civil war, the officials said.

<HEAD>Court Upholds Law in South Carolina Bond Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today upheld a law requiring
municipal or state bonds issued after June 30, 1983, to be
registered before they can be tax-exempt.
   The justices, by a 7-1 vote, ruled that the federal law enacted
to discourage tax evasion in the trading of municipal bonds does
not violate any state's sovereign immunity.
   South Carolina had challenged the law, arguing that the law will
hurt state and local governments by forcing them to chose between
two costly alternatives: Continue to issue unregistered bonds for
which investors will have their interest taxed or pay sizeable
registration fees.
   State and local governments issue bonds to finance various
projects such as building roads and schools.
   More than half the states had supported South Carolina's
challenge.
   The law, which took effect July 1, 1983, is aimed in part at
discouraging tax evasion when bonds change hands as gifts or are
passed on to an heir. While the interest on government bonds is
exempt from federal income tax, the bonds are taxed as gifts or as
part of an estate.
   In passing the law, Congress mainly intended to crack down on
the use of such bonds as an untraceable substitute for cash in
illegal activities, and to make it easier to catch criminals who
deal in stolen or forged securities.
   Writing for the court today, Justice William J. Brennan said,
``A nondiscriminatory federal tax on the interest earned on state
bonds does not violate the intergovernmental tax immunity
doctrine.''
   Only Justice Sandra Day O'Connor dissented, accusing the court
of overturning ``a precedent that it has honored for nearly a
hundred years'' by making state and municipal bonds subject to
possible federal taxation.
   ``Henceforth the ability of state and local governments to
finance their activities will depend in part on whether Congress
voluntarily abstains from tapping this permissible source of
additional income-tax revenue.''
   Justice Anthony M. Kennedy did not participate in the case,
which is called South Carolina vs. Baker, 94 Original.

   An Ethiopian refugee who said she came to
the United States to escape political persecution and a
shoot-on-sight order in her homeland was stabbed to death in her
apartment, authorities said.
   Homicide detectives said today they had few clues to who killed
Mezgebnesh Abayu or why. She had been stabbed several times, and
the apartment showed signs of a brief struggle. But the place had
not been ransacked and the door had not been forced open, they said.
   Nothing they found indicated or ruled out a political motive,
police said.
   In an interview with the Philadelphia Inquirer in November, Mrs.
Abayu said she had worked for a news magazine in the Ethiopian
capital of Addis Ababa.
   When Ethiopian Emperor Haile Selasie was deposed in a
Marxist-backed military coup in 1974, she said she and her husband
joined a student-led opposition group.
   Her husband was killed, she said, and ``there were orders to
shoot me on sight.''
   She fled to the neighboring nation of Sudan in 1980, leaving her
daughter, and then entered the United States as a refugee, one of
18,000 Ethiopians who have come here since 1980.
   Friends said Mrs. Abayu was not very happy in the United States,
where she was cut off from her parents and daughter with no chance
of returning home. She threw herself into community work, serving
on the board of directors of the Ethiopian Community Association.
   She also worked as a job counselor for the defunct Philadelphia
Area Refugee Consortium, a support group.
   She earned an undergraduate degree at the University of
Pennsylvania, studying social sciences and journalism. She would
have received a master's degree in social work from Temple
University this spring.
   Mrs. Abayu, 33, was about to start a job as a caseworker for the
city Department of Human Services after completing a 10-week
training program. Her sister, Tenagne Workeshatu, 26, last saw her
alive about 7 a.m. Monday when the younger woman left for classes
at Philadelphia Community College.
   When Mrs. Workeshatu returned from school at 12:30 p.m., she
found her sister's body just inside the door of the third-floor
apartment they shared, police said.
   Her friends said they were shocked by her death.
   ``When we came to this country as refugees, our expectations
were so high,'' said Harry Massele, director of the Ethiopian
Community Association. ``What we found was a difficult life. When
somebody is killed, we are so in shock because it does not happen
very often in Ethiopia.''

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A special commission of the Supreme Soviet has
called for ratification of the U.S.-Soviet treaty banning
intermediate-range missiles, a senior Soviet official announced
today.
   Commission chairman Georgy M. Kornienko said it had advised in a
report to the national parliament's Foreign Relations Commission
that ``a positive conclusion on the issue of ratifying the treaty''
be reached.
   President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev signed
the treaty at the Washington summit in December. Ratification of
the treaty, which bans U.S. and Soviet missiles with ranges between
300 and 3,400 miles, is pending in the U.S. Senate.
   ``The Soviet parliament's special commission scrutinizing the
... treaty has concluded that its fulfillment will definitely
enhance rather than reduce the security of both the two signatory
nations and international security in general,'' Kornienko said.
   The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet performs the actual
ratification function, although Kornienko's committee has held
lengthy sessions to discuss the accord. The political decisions on
the weapons concessions were taken last year by the ruling
Communist Party Politburo.
   The party's endorsement of the treaty was considered the
ultimate judgment of the treaty, and the ratification process is a
formality.
   It was not known when the Presidium would make the formal
ratification decision.

<HEAD>Court Rules in California, Florida Union Cases</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Unions may distribute handbills urging
consumers to boycott ``neutral employers'' against whom the unions
have no grievance, the Supreme Court ruled today.
   Voting 8-0 in a case from Florida, the justices said that
although federal labor law generally prohibits unions from engaging
in ``secondary boycott'' picketing of neutral employers it does not
ban non-picketing activities aimed at such businesses.
   In a separate decision, the court ruled by a 6-2 vote in a
California case that employers may be forced to provide free,
internal mail delivery for labor union literature aimed at
organizing employees.
   The Florida controversy began when the Florida Gulf Coast
Building and Construction Trades Council, a union, sought to
publicize its grievances against the High Construction Co., which
was building a store in the East Lake Square Mall in Tampa.
   The union alleged that High offered substandard wages and
benefits.
   Rather than picket or patrol the mall, union members handed out
literature urging a total consumer boycott of the 85-store mall.
   After the union refused to modify the handbills to make clear it
had no dispute with the mall's owner or any of the tenant stores,
the Edward J. DeBartolo Corp., which owns the mall, filed an unfair
labor practice claim against the union.
   The National Labor Relations Board ruled that the union's action
was banned by federal law, but the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals said that reading labor law to ban such handbilling would
raise ``serious constitutional issues.''
   By reading federal labor law to allow the union's handbilling,
the justices avoided having to decide the constitutional
free-speech issue presented by the case.
   The secondary-boycott prohibitions in federal labor law bar
unions from using coercion against a neutral employer.
   Lawyers for the mall owner and the Reagan administration argued
that handing out the handbills at the Tampa mall was coercive _ if
not on consumers then to owners of the stores inside the mall.
   Writing for the court today, Justice Byron R. White disagreed.
   ``There is no suggestion that the leaflets had any coercive
effect on the customers of the mall,'' White said. ``There was no
violence, picketing or patrolling, and only an attempt to persuade
customers not to shop inthe mall.''
   White also agreed with the appeals court that if federal labor
law banned such union activity, serious free-speech questions would
be raised.
   ``On its face, this was expressive activity,'' he said. ``Had
the union simply been leafletting the public generally, including
those entering every shopping mall in town ... there is little
doubt that legislative proscription of such leaflets would pose a
substantial issue of validity under the First Amendment.''
   White was joined by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and
Justices William J. Brennan, Thurgood Marshall, Harry A. Blackmun
and John Paul Stevens.
   Justices Sandra Day O'Connor and Antonin Scalia joined in the
result but not in White's majority opinion.
   In the California case, the court ruled that the University of
California must provide free mail delivery on campus for labor
union literature aimed at organizing university custodial workers.
   The justices upheld a decision by the state Public Employment
Relations Board granting the free mail delivery for Local 371 of
the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees.
   The union had filed an unfair labor practice charge against the
university in 1979 after being denied free use of the intercampus
mail system at its Berkeley campus.
   The court, in an opinion by O'Connor, rejected arguments that
allowing such mail delivery violates a federal law granting the
U.S. Postal Service a monopoly.
   Stevens and Marshall cast dissenting votes.
   Justice Anthony M. Kennedy did not participate in either case.
   The cases are DeBartolo vs. Florida Gulf Coast Building and
Construction Trades, 86-1461, and Regents vs. Public Employment
Relations Board, 86-935.

   A pro-Iranian group holding two Americans
said early today it will retaliate against ``America's
aggressions'' in the Persian Gulf, where U.S. and Iranian forces
clashed this week.
   In other developments, U.S. Ambassador John Kelly said he could
not confirm reports that U.S. Marine Lt. Col. William R. Higgins
was killed by his pro-Iranian captors. And a newspaper said two
French hostages may be freed before Saturday.
   ``We will not sit back and watch America's aggressions in the
gulf,'' the Revolutionary Justice Organization said in a
handwritten statement delivered shortly after midnight to the
independent daily newspaper An-Nahar.
   ``There will be retaliations and retaliations to punish the
aggressors and make them understand they will regret their
actions,'' said the statement, written in Arabic.
   The statement did not specify what measures the group would take
but included a photograph of Joseph James Cicippio, one of the two
Americans the group is holding.
   Cicippio, 57, of Valley Forge, Pa., was acting comptroller of
the American University of Beirut. He was kidnapped in the Lebanese
capital on Sept. 12, 1986.
   Edward Austin Tracy of Burlington, Vt., a writer who was
abducted in west Beirut on Oct. 21, 1986, is the other American
whose kidnapping was claimed by Revolutionary Justice Organization.
   In the photograph, Cicippio was clean shaven and wearing a navy
blue track suit with white stripes on the shoulder. He appeared
thinner than he did in the last picture released by the
organization, on Jan. 17, 1987.
   On Monday, the U.S. Navy attacked two Iranian oil platforms in
the Persian Gulf and sank or damaged six Iranian ships in
retaliation for a mine explosion last week that damaged the USS
Samuel B. Roberts and wounded 10 crewmen.
   Ambassador Kelly said his embassy had no information supporting
reports Higgins was killed by his captors.
   ``We have no information that would confirm those reports. We
cannot deny those reports, but no one knows the truth,'' he said.
   The Christian-controlled Voice of Lebanon radio station said
Monday that Higgins was killed before the Syrian-backed Shiite
Moslem Amal militia captured the south Lebanon hamlet of Siddiqine
from the Iranian-backed Hezbollah early this month.
   In another report today, An-Nahar said two Frenchmen also held
by pro-Iranian kidnappers may be released within three days.
   The newspaper quoted unidentified sources as saying Arab
businessmen Omran Adham and Mahdi al-Tajer were in Beirut and have
had ``contacts ... with the kidnappers.''
   ``Two French hostages may be released before April 23,'' the
report said.
   Adham and al-Tajer ``expect a positive outcome of their
contacts,'' the paper added. It did not elaborate.
   There are 22 foreigners missing and believed kidnapped in
Lebanon, including nine Americans. The longest held is Terry
Anderson, 40, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated
Press, who was seized March 16, 1985.

   A frantic woman drove the wrong way up a freeway
exit ramp while trying to flee her former boyfriend, but her car
crashed into oncoming traffic and she was shot to death along with
her mother, police said.
   Barbara Jean Johnson, 36, and her mother, Jessie Mae Norman, 63,
were shot dead Tuesday, police said.
   Cleophus Jones Ethridge, 51, was charged with capital murder
after he surrendered to police two hours after the incident. He is
being held without bond.
   Homicide Sgt. Ronnie Doyle said the incident stemmed from a
domestic dispute. Doyle said Ms. Johnson had gone to her
boyfriend's home on Tuesday to collect items for her move to a new
apartment.
   During the chase the women drove the wrong way up a ramp to get
on the freeway, hit a pickup as they traveled west on an eastbound
road and were finally stopped by oncoming traffic.
   Ms. Johnson's two daughters, aged 16 and 10, were also in the
car but escaped without injury. No one was injured in the accident
with the pickup.
   Carl Dubone, an eastbound motorist, said he came over a rise and
saw a man standing in traffic holding a rifle.
   ``He was stepping away from the (Johnson) white car,'' Dubone
said. ``He was aiming at the lady (older daughter) who was running.
He stepped in front of the car and shot at the lady, but she ducked
down behind a car. The traffic was almost at a standstill by then.''
   Police said the man briefly chased the older girl, then went
back to his car and drove away.
   Ms. Johnson, a licensed vocational nurse, was shot through the
chest as she sat in the driver's seat of her car. Ms. Norman was
shot in the jaw while sitting in the back seat behind her daughter.

   Jesse Jackson reclaimed a razor-thin lead
today in Vermont's see-saw Democratic caucuses, a stunning comeback
from his 2-to-1 loss to Michael Dukakis in the state's ``beauty
contest'' primary last month.
   Tuesday night's caucus contest was a tight battle throughout the
night, and at times an emotional one. Burlington Mayor Bernard
Sanders, a Jackson supporter, was slapped by an irate citizen after
he cast his vote.
   With 97 percent of the votes counted today, Jackson held an
ever-so-thin lead over Dukakis. Of 1,300 state convention
delegates, Jackson had 575 delegates, or 46 percent, and Dukakis
had 572, or 45 percent. Albert Gore Jr. had 4, or 0 percent; 112
delegates, or 9 percent, were uncommitted.
   Dukakis would win 7 national convention delegates and Jackson 7,
if those results held up at the state convention next month.
   Though his lead was tenuous, Jackson's supporters hailed his
showing as a triumph. He won the state's largest city, Burlington,
and won many of the state's smallest, most rural communities as
well.
   ``It's a tremendous victory for us,'' said Liz Blum, the Jackson
state coordinator.
   The delegates elected Tuesday night will attend next month's
state convention, where 14 of Vermont's 19 delegates to the
national convention will be chosen. The remaining five spots belong
to Gov. Madeleine Kunin, a Dukakis backer, and four state party
officials.
   Jackson's strong showing in the caucuses was a disappointment
for the Dukakis campaign, which has most every prominent Democrat
in the state behind it, including Kunin, Sen. Patrick Leahy, Lt.
Gov. Howard Dean and House Speaker Ralph Wright.
   Kunin said the Jackson showing was ``not unexpected'' and added
she continues to be ``very optimistic about Dukakis.''
   ``I think think his showing in New York is fantastic,'' she
added. Dukakis won the big New York contest Tuesday by a solid
margin.
   Dukakis had won Vermont's presidential primary March 1, winning
56 percent of the vote, while Jackson gained 26 percent. The
primary was non-binding and had nothing to do with the selection of
actual delegates.
   Based on that showing, the Dukakis campaign had expected to win
the caucuses, but in recent days his supporters had backed off such
predictions.
   At the end of the night, with the tally showing a slight Dukakis
lead, William Wasserman, Dukakis' state coordinator, said: ``I'm
delighted that we're even one delegate ahead. We already knew the
Jackson campaign was well organized.''
   On the Republican side, some 1,000 delegates to the state GOP
convention were chosen Tuesday night. With 39 percent of the
delegates reported, George Bush had 332 delegates, or 89 percent,
with 52 uncommitted delegates, and five for Pat Robertson.
   Robertson's campaign had hoped to elect enough delegates to give
them a voice at the state and national conventions. But Bush's
Vermont spokesman, Steve Watson, said the Bush forces ``rallied and
were able to overcome the Robertson forces.''
   The turnout statewide was extremely high. About 670 people
attended the Burlington Democratic caucus, compared to 435 during
the 1984 presidential contest.
   The Burlington caucus provided a fair share of drama and
tension, as many party regulars protested the appearance of Mayor
Bernard Sanders, a socialist who ran for mayor as an independent.
Sanders backs Jackson.
   Lyman Hunt of Burlington, who took the podium to speak in
support of Gore, said, ``I resent intruders who would undermine and
destroy the Democratic Party.'' And voter Helen Malloy yelled from
the back of the auditorium, ``We want unity among ourselves, not
with a group of outsiders.''
   Several minutes later, she approached Sanders as he was
returning to his seat after casting his vote and slapped him on the
cheek. Sanders, who at first appeared to think the woman was about
to greet him, looked stunned.
   ``I don't think that was very nice,'' he told her.
   Malloy later said in a telephone interview that she ``lost my
footing ... I didn't hit (him) in the face on purpose.''
   Jackson had no paid staff in Vermont for either the primary or
the caucuses, but the volunteer staff for the primary was estimated
at 50 or more.
   The Dukakis campaign had two professional staffers in Vermont
for the caucuses, down from 15 paid staffers and 60 volunteers for
the preferential primary.

   Michael Dukakis today celebrated a resounding
New York victory that put him on a fast track toward the Democratic
presidential nomination and a fall showdown with Republican George
Bush. Jesse Jackson praised Dukakis for steering clear of attacks
in the bitterly divisive primary, saying, ``Good for him and good
for America.''
   Sources said Sen. Albert Gore Jr. was ending his presidential
bid after a poor third-place finish behind Dukakis and Jackson. One
source, commenting on condition he not be named, said the only
question was whether Gore would formally withdraw or merely suspend
his campaign in order to retain his delegates.
   The Tennessee senator scheduled an announcement for Thursday in
Washington.
   Jackson today singled out New York Mayor Edward Koch for blame
in a campaign in which Jackson said ``people were driven into
hysteria'' by negative campaigning against him. But he said on
CBS-TV that Dukakis ``resisted the temptation to take the campaign
to the gutter.''
   Dukakis, in interviews on NBC-TV and ABC-TV, said, ``I want to
be a unifier. ... I think we can put it back together. I'm somebody
who hates the politics of division.''
   Dukakis won 51 percent of the New York vote, Jackson 37 percent
and Gore 10 percent.
   ``The Democratic Party's going to be unified and we're going to
stop George Bush this November,'' Gore said, sounding a unity theme
that must have been music to Dukakis' ears after two months of
rough-and-tumble campaigning.
   Gore was expected to halt his campaign on Thursday. He had
staked everything in New York with an expensive television campaign
and a sometimes barb-tongued effort to pose himself as an
alternative to Dukakis and Jackson.
   Dukakis ended up handily winning the ethnic white vote, both
Jewish and Catholic. Jackson had more than 95 percent of the black
vote and enjoyed a narrow, 411,903 to 405,486 victory over Dukakis
in the precincts of New York City. Networks said the black vote
made up 22 to 27 percent of the 1.5 million statewide Democratic
vote.
   Victory brought Dukakis 164 of New York's 255 delegates. He now
has 1,051 national delegates, just over half the 2,081 he needs to
clinch nomination. Jackson had 89 to bring his total to 841.
   Vice President George Bush continued his roll toward the GOP
nomination and declared Dukakis ``a good bet'' to be his Democratic
opponent in the fall. He said he looked forward to the competition,
and Dukakis gave him a taste of the battle to come during a
Philadelphia appearance Tuesday evening.
   ``This fall George Bush is going to be judged by a legacy of ...
pink slips for our workers, golden parachutes for high rollers, and
greenmail for sharp operators on Wall Street,'' said the
Massachusetts governor.
   ``I want to make that American dream come alive again, not only
in Trump Towers, not only in fancy apartments all over this
country, not only in a few privileged neighborhoods.''
   Dukakis flew from Philadelphia to a New York victory rally
within walking distance of Trump Tower, where he told cheering
supporters, ``I love New York. Friends, if we can make it here we
can make it anywhere.''
   Gore met with Jackson after midnight Tuesday. Jackson aides
described the meeting as a ``courtesy call.'' Earlier, when Jackson
was asked if he might get the senator's support, he replied, ``I
don't know what he is going to do. But I do respect him very much.''
   With 99 percent of the precincts reporting, the vote looked this
way:
   Dukakis had 783,568 or 51 percent.
   Jackson had 573,112 or 37 percent.
   Gore had 156,052 or 10 percent.
   For the two Democratic survivors, the next battleground is
Pennsylvania next Tuesday, a state where Dukakis was assured of
winning a major share of the 178 delegates at stake regardless of
the outcome of a non-binding presidential preference vote.
   ``We could win the state and lose 80 percent of the delegates,''
lamented Jackson delegate coodinator Steve Cobble. Dukakis has a
strong organization in the state, while Jackson lacks candidates
for about one third of the delegate slots.
   Unity was the theme being sounded by Democratic candidates and
party officials after the New York results rolled in.
   ``It's a time fo really uniting this party,'' said Democratic
chairman Paul G. Kirk Jr.
   ``In Iowa we won the bronze,'' Dukakis said, reading from a text
at his victory rally. ``In New Hampshire we won the gold. Tonight
we won the Oscar.'' At his side were his wife Kitty and his
Oscar-winning cousin, actress Olympia Dukakis.
   Dukakis said he expected to the remaining contests with Jackson
to remain free of animosity. ``We have a message of hope and
optimism. Neither of us believes in cutting up the other guy is a
way to win elections or the presidency,'' he said.
   New York offered 96 Republican delegates. Bush won 91, one was
going uncommitted and Rep. Jack Kemp, a Buffalo-based campaign
dropout, was winning four. Bush is closing in on the 1,139 needed
to secure his nomination.
   New Yorkers voted while Democratic senators met behind closed
doors in the Capitol to select 43 delegates to the party's national
convention. Dukakis won 13 pledges and outdueled Gore, who gained
six as well as his own. Jackson was shut out, with the majority of
senators remaining uncommitted.
   In Vermont, Dukakis and Jackson fought to a virtual draw with 97
percent of the vote counted from Democratic caucuses. Dukakis, who
won a non-binding primary vote March 1, would split with Jackson
the 14 national convention delegates at stake if Tuesday's results
hold up at the state convention. Bush won going away.
   There was widespread agreement that Dukakis would be unwise to
relax his campaign pace. And party leaders suggested that Jackson's
fervent supporters in the black community must be persuaded that
their candidate was in a fair fight to the finish.
   During the often raucous New York campaign, New York City Mayor
Edward Koch had no such inhibitions. He accused Jackson of lying
under pressure and said Jews and other supporters of Israel would
``have to be crazy'' to vote for Jackson.
   Koch supported Gore.

   Shiite Moslem gunmen slipped out of a
Kuwaiti jet at dawn today _ reportedly with a promise of safe
conduct _ and their 31 hostages were freed, ending a 16-day
hijacking ordeal.
   The hijackers left Algiers for an unknown destination, according
to sources in the Persian Gulf who spoke to The Associated Press on
condition of anonymity. The Kuwait News Agency said no deal was
made with the hijackers except safe passage to Iran or Lebanon.
   The Algerian government had mediated with the hijackers, who the
hostages said numbered about eight but the Kuwait News Agency said
numbered nine. The government and the hijackers said they reached a
solution but did not say what it was.
   The gunmen had killed two passengers since seizing the Kuwait
Airways Boeing 747 on April 5. But Kuwait refused to bow to the
hijacker's demand that 17 pro-Iranian terrorists imprisoned in
Kuwait be released.
   Most of the 31 freed hostages were believed to be Kuwaiti,
including three members of Kuwait's royal family. It was reported
previously that about 35 hostages were aboard the plane.
   An official source in Kuwait, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said Algerian Foreign Minister Taleb Ibrahimi promised
the hijackers safe passage when he met with them aboard the plane
on Tuesday.
   A 31-year-old businessman, Tadar El-Kebi, said he saw the
hijackers going through the plane trying to wipe off their
fingerprints shortly after 4 a.m. today.
   ``This was the first indication I had that our release was
imminent,'' El-Kebi said.
   The hijackers were whisked out of the jet at about 5:40 a.m.
(12:40 a.m. EDT) and taken in unmarked cars to an undisclosed
location, said Algerian officials who spoke on condition of
anonymity. The hostages were brought out about 20 minutes later.
   Floodlights that had bathed the blue-and-white airliner nightly
since it landed here a week ago were turned off at 9 p.m. Tuesday,
allegedly for a technical reason. They never came back on and the
area around the jet was dark, making it difficult for reporters to
detect any movement.
   Anware Al-Sabah and Ibtesam Al-Sabah, second cousins of Kuwait's
emir and the only two women among the hostages, were the first to
descend the gangway from the plane.
   The women, wearing black veils, were escorted to a car and taken
to a hospital with their brother, Fadel Khaled Al-Sabah, who rode
in an ambulance, a doctor said. The brother was suffering from a
nervous disorder.
   The rest of the hostages boarded a white bus and cars and waved
to reporters on the tarmac as they were driven to the airport VIP
lounge. The seven crew members and 21 passengers carried hand
luggage.
   The men were unshaven, looked haggard and dazed and stared
vacantly.
   ``We lived in fear. We were very frayed. We had lost hope that
it would turn out this way,'' said Kuwaiti student Youssef
al-Angeri, 24.
   Passengers and crew said the hijackers always wore light blue
hoods in their presence.
   ``The worst moment was when they put a gun to a passenger's
head,'' said the plane's purser, Abdel Mon'em Mahmoud, an Egyptian.
``Their eyes were sharp and expressionless like a shark.''
   Interior Minister Hedi Khediri, who led the mediation team,
announced the release without giving details: ``A solution settling
all the issues of the hijacking has just been reached.''
   Asked what would become of the hijackers, he said: ``That is a
question which regards Algeria.''
   The gunmen said in a statement in Arabic over the plane's radio
at 4 a.m.: ``We declare to the Moslem people and people who seek
freedom today, on the third day of Ramadan, that we will end the
Kuwaiti airplane operation, giving our best regards to the Kuwaiti
people. We salute the offer made by the Algerian government.''
   Ramadan, the Moslem holy month, started in Algeria on Monday.
   The shades on the airplane's windows were raised for the first
time since its arrival April 13 in Algiers, the third stop on an
odyssey that began April 5 when the jet was seized on a
Bangkok-Kuwait flight with 112 people aboard.
   The bodies of two Kuwaiti hostages, beaten and shot, were thrown
off the plane in Cyrpus, where the hijackers released 13 hostages
in exchange for fuel and the plane sat for five days before flying
to Algiers.
   In Mashhad, Iran, the first stop, the hijackers released 57
hostages. Freed hostages had said they believed additional gunmen
boarded in Mashhad.
   One of those released in Iran, Bert Watson of Guisborough,
England, said he was ``immensely glad'' that the other hostages had
been freed.
   But he said it would be a ``travesty'' if the hijackers were
allowed ``to quietly slip away from Algeria because it will end up
with them doing exactly the same again.''
   ``These completely ruthless people should be locked up and the
key should be thrown away,'' he said. ``If I had my way they would
be hanged.''
   The 17 pro-Iranian extremists whose freedom the hijackers sought
were convicted in Kuwait for the December 1983 bombings of the U.S.
and French embassies in Kuwait.
   Western intelligence sources say they believe the hijacking's
mastermind is Imad Mughniyeh, 36, one of four men indicted in the
United States in the 1985 hijacking of a TWA jetliner during which
a U.S. Navy diver was killed.

   Here, at a glance, are highlights of actions
taken Wednesday by the Supreme Court.
   
   ALCOHOLISM
   
   The court ruled the government may disqualify military veterans
who are alcoholics from receiving benefits by viewing their
condition as ``willful misconduct'' rather than an uncontrollable
disease.
   By a 4-3 vote, the justices said the Veterans Administration, in
denying benefits to two men, did not violate a federal law
protecting the rights of the handicapped.
   The court did not decide whether alcoholism is a disease, but
said the VA is not compelled to regard it as such.
   The case is Traynor vs. Turnage, 86-622.
   
   UNIONS
   
   The court ruled that unions may distribute handbills urging
consumers to boycott ``neutral employers'' against whom the unions
have no grievance.
   Voting 8-0 in a case from Florida, the justices said that
although federal labor law generally prohibits unions from engaging
in ``secondary boycott'' picketing of neutral employers it does not
ban non-picketing activities aimed at such businesses.
   In a separate decision, the court ruled by a 6-2 vote in a
California case that employers may be forced to provide free,
internal mail delivery for labor union literature aimed at
organizing employees.
   The cases are DeBartolo vs. Florida Gulf Coast Building and
Construction Trades, 86-1461, and Regents vs. Public Employment
Relations Board, 86-935.
   
   BONDS
   
   The court upheld a law requiring municipal or state bonds issued
after June 30, 1983, to be registered before they can be tax-exempt.
   The justices, by a 7-1 vote, ruled that the federal law enacted
to discourage tax evasion in the trading of municipal bonds does
not violate any state's sovereign immunity.
   The case is South Carolina vs. Baker, 94 Original.

   The Senate Finance Committee today
overwhelmingly approved a bipartisan $2.8 billion welfare overhaul
that aims to give welfare
   parents more opportunities and incentives to support their
children.
   ``We have been fighting and struggling for this for a
quarter-century,'' said Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., after
the panel voted 17-3 to send his ``Family Security Act'' to the
full Senate.
   ``This is a momentous event,'' Moynihan said. ``We are
redefining this 1935 program from a widow's pension to a program
that will bring a generation of young Americans back into the
mainstream of life.''
   Moynihan said he had ``great hopes'' that President Reagan would
agree to sign welfare reform legislation despite a letter
indicating a veto is in the offing.
   American taxpayers are unwilling ``to increase dependency on
welfare in the name of `reform,''' four Cabinet members said in the
letter to members of the Senate Finance Committee. ``We would
recommend that he (the president) veto this bill.''
   The price tag on the five-year Senate proposal is about
two-thirds the cost of a broader plan passed earlier by the House.
Both bills stress parental responsibility through work and child
support, with government aid a last resort for struggling families.
   The measures would make the first fundamental changes in the
welfare system in more than two decades.
   The Senate plan would require stronger efforts by states to
collect child support from absent parents. States would also have
to run a jobs, education and training program for welfare
recipients and spend half their money on people considered
difficult to help. Participants would receive child care,
transportation and Medicaid assistance.
   Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, on Tuesday
called the bill the first step toward ``a great and worthy goal''
of helping children and their parents lead productive lives. He
said it embodies the best state initiatives and would not increase
the federal deficit.
   The bill includes provisions to raise $2 billion over five years
by extending the Internal Revenue Service's debt collection program
and $800 million by phasing out child care tax credits for
upper-income families.
   The administration letter to Bentsen and other committee members
was signed by Health and Human Services Secretary Otis Bowen,
Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng, Labor Secretary Ann McLaughlin,
and Budget Director James Miller.
   The four said the net effect of the Moynihan bill would be to
spend billions of scarce federal dollars on discredited ``reform''
concepts and untested ``solutions'' while adding families to the
welfare rolls.
   Administration officials at the work session Tuesday objected to
a number of things in the bill, including a requirement that states
allow welfare payments to two-parent families in which the
principal wage-earner is unemployed. The program now is voluntary
and 26 states have adopted it.
   Sen. William Armstrong, R-Colo., tried to strip the requirement,
saying it cost too much, was sure-fire veto bait, and there was ``a
real difference of opinion'' on whether the two-parent program was
desirable.
   ``I thought this was supposed to be the great pro-family
administration,'' said an impatient Sen. John Danforth, R-Mo. ``Why
should the federal government give a penny to any state that is
rewarding families for splitting up?''
   The committee rejected Sen. John Chafee's attempt to double to
two years the amount of time Medicaid benefits must be available to
welfare recipients who take low-wage jobs without health insurance.
The amendment failed at least partly because the Rhode Island
Republican wanted to finance it with a one-cent-per-pack increase
in the cigarette tax.

   The family of engineer Benjamin Linder, killed by
U.S.-backed Contra rebels last year in Nicaragua, today filed a $50
million suit against top rebel leaders and accused the U.S. State
Department of covering up details of the slaying.
   In a news conference here today, the family accused the Contras
of having ``brutally executed'' Linder on April 28, 1987 in
northern Nicaragua, where he was helping to build a hydroelectric
plant.
   The suit filed in federal court here accused Contra directors
Adolfo Calero and Aristides Sanchez and rebel military leaders
Enrique Bermudez and Indalecia Rodriguez with ``wrongful death,
battery, and cruel and inhuman treatment'' of Linder, as well as
the Contra organizations themselves.
   Documents, including some obtained through the Freedom of
Information Act, show the 27-year-old Linder was executed as he lay
injured on the ground, the family said.
   ``We know that Ben was murdered,'' Dr. David Linder, father of
the victim, said today. ``Although our lawsuit cannot bring Ben
back, we want to make those responsible pay for their crimes, by
forcing them to pay substantial damages, and by exposing their
guilt to the world.''
   ``I would like to know more about the complicity of the (Reagan)
administration,'' Linder said. ``I don't see why they are so
secretive if they don't know anything about it.''
   Jorge Rosales, spokesman for the Nicaraguan Resistance, as the
Contras are formally called, said today he had no comment yet on
the suit.
   The Linders, who are from Portland, Ore., said their
investigation shows that despite Contra claims to the contrary,
volunteers helping the Sandinista government were deliberately
sought out by the rebels.
   ``Ben's death was no accident,'' said the father. ``He and his
co-workers were targeted by the Contras because they were bringing
electricity to poor Nicaraguans.''
   Said David Linder, ``the orders came from top Contra leaders,
who must be brought to justice.''
   Michael Ratner, attorney for the Linders, said the U.S. State
Department had refused to cooperate in the family's investigation
of Benjamin Linder's death.
   Ratner said he believes the State Department coached the Contra
troops in their subsequent statements about the killing. He said it
was possible the U.S. government would be sued separately at a
later time.
   In an autopsy released last June by the family, Dr. Michael
Baden said Linder had been shot in the head from ``less than one
inch'' after suffering non-fatal wounds in an ambush on the project.
   The family today produced a State Department memo that indicated
a physician retained by the department to review the case believed
there was no doubt Benjamin Linder was shot at point-blank range.
   The Contras publicly have said Linder was armed, and was killed
in a firefight between rebels and government troops.
   The New York Times reported last year that the rebels
acknowledged the killing privately and said Linder was mistaken for
a Cuban adviser to the Sandinistas.
   The Linders said they will be represented in the case by the New
York-based Center for Constitutional Rights.
   The family also said they will leave Friday for Nicaragua, where
they will participate in activities commemorating the anniversary
of Linder's death, and deliver a check for $250,000 to complete the
development project Linder was working on when he was killed.

   Secretary of State George P. Shultz
today denounced the hijackers of a Kuwaiti jumbo jet as murderers
and said freeing them would violate international standards.
   The hijackers left Algeria for an unknown destination today
after their 31 hostages were freed, said sources in the Persian
Gulf who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   ``They are not only hijackers but murderers,'' Shultz said at a
news conference in Helsinki, where he stopped en route to Moscow to
prepare for the May 29-June 2 summit.
   The Kuwait News Agency said the gunmen, who seized the plane
April 5, were promised safe passage to Iran or Lebanon.
   Shultz said his reports from Algiers were fragmentary and he did
not want to second-guess the Algerian government, which negotiated
with the gunmen.
   But he said the hijackers committed two distinct crimes: seizing
the airplane and killing the two Kuwaitis whose bodies were dumped
from the jetliner in Cyprus last week.
   ``From the standpoint of the international community we don't
like to see hijackers go off free,'' Shultz said. ``I don't think
that's a proper thing to do.''
   Kuwait thanked Algeria for its intercession. In the past, the
United States also has expressed gratitude to governments that
assist in ending hostage crises, but Shultz did not do so.
   Shultz said the United States would not seek to extradite the
hijackers if none of the hostages was American.
   But Charles E. Redman, the State Department spokesman, said one
passenger might have held dual citizenship, and Shultz said one of
the gunmen may have been involved in the hijacking of a TWA
jetliner in 1985 in which a U.S. Navy diver was killed.
   Shultz will open three days of talks in Moscow on Thursday with
Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze and meet with Soviet leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   On Shultz's agenda are the Iran-Iraq war, which threatens
shipping in the Persian Gulf, and U.S.-Soviet negotiations to
conclude a treaty to cut strategic nuclear weapons arsenals by 30
to 50 percent.
   Shultz said he would appeal anew to the Soviets to agree to
impose an arms embargo against Iran through the U.N. Security
Council.
   With Soviet support, the council called for a cease-fire in the
war in the gulf last July. But U.S. efforts to overcome Iranian
resistance with sanctions have been stymied by Moscow.
   A U.S. official, who briefed reporters on condition of
anonymity, said the Soviets might change their minds. He said
Shevardnadze had discussed the issue Tuesday with Jack Matlock, the
U.S. ambassador, and ``his attitude was barely negative.''
   Shultz said Tuesday the United States does not intend to be
drawn into the Persian Gulf war but is determined to defend its
ships against Iranian attack.
   He said it was difficult to analyze Iran's motives in attacking
ships in the Persian Gulf and firing on U.S. vessels and aircraft
on Monday, given vastly superior U.S. firepower.
   Shultz said the Iranian mine that damaged the U.S. frigate
Samuel B. Roberts in the gulf last week, prompting the Navy's
retaliatory raid on two Iranian oil platforms Monday, may have been
laid ``carelessly.''
   The navy sank or damaged six Iranian warships Monday.
   Shultz said he had no information to link Israel to the
assassination of Khalil al-Wazir, a top official of the Palestine
Liberation Organization.
   He said the killing did not appear to be an act of terrorism,
which he said has ``a random characteristic'' with the attackers
striking at innocent civilians.
   ``This was a different kind of action, which doesn't mean we
don't condemn it,'' he said.
   Al-Wazir, military commander of the PLO, was killed Saturday in
his home in Tunisia by masked commandos. A Tunisian inquiry
concluded Israel conducted the attack.
   Israeli sources confirmed privately to The Associated Press that
Israeli forces killed al-Wazir. The Israeli government has not
confirmed this.

<HEAD>Appeals Panel Upholds IRS Lifting of Ministry's Tax-Exempt Status</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court today cleared the
way for the Internal Revenue Service to revoke the PTL television
ministry's tax-exempt status.
   The IRS wants to revoke PTL's exempt status in part because PTL
had used contributions to fund the lavish lifestyles of Jim Bakker
and his wife Tammy, said IRS lawyer Francis Allegra.
   Officials of the ministry Bakker founded had argued that loss of
tax-exempt status could scuttle efforts to reorganize the ministry
by a federal bankruptcy court's May 1 deadline.
   Bakker resigned from PTL after a scandal over a sexual encounter
with former church secretary Jessica Hahn.
   Attorneys for the IRS, seeking to make the revocation
retroactive to May 31, 1981, said PTL owes the government from $55
million to $82 million in back taxes.
   Today's unanimous ruling from a three-judge panel of the 4th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed a decision by U.S. District
Judge Karen L. Henderson of Columbia, S.C..
   Henderson had found that the bankruptcy court handling the PTL
reorganization did not have the authority to prevent the IRS from
lifting the ministry's tax-exempt status.
   ``Although a revocation may potentially obstruct the orderly
administration in bankruptcy, we decline to create and exception
... in the absence of expressed congressional intent,'' the panel
said.
   R. Bradford Leggett, a PTL attorney, had argued before the
appeals panel on March 31 that loss of tax-exempt status would
jeopardize the ministry's ability to reorganize by the bankruptcy
court's May 1 deadline.
   The ministry, based in Fort Mill, S.C., is engaged in a ``March
to Victory'' telethon to raise $4.2 million by May 1. PTL has debts
estimated at $60 million.

   Here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers
throughout the nation.
   April 14
   The Daily Astorian, Astoria, Ore., on the war against drugs:
   One of the most surprising aspects of the Reagan administration
is that it has lost the war on drugs.
   Despite all of the talk and all of the money spent, the results
of the administration's assault on narcotics trafficking have been
dismal.
   Cocaine shipments into the United States have soared during
Reagan's presidency and the number of drug users in the United
States remains near its all-time peak.
   That will be one of the strangest legacies of his time in the
White House.

   Atlanta Constitution on Larry Speakes and presidential quotes:
   Former White House press officer Larry Speakes' admission that
he attempted to ``spruce up the president's image by taking a bit
of liberty with my PR man's license'' has created an uproar, and no
wonder.
   The statements Speakes attributed to President Reagan _ one
lifted from the lips of Secretary of State George Shultz and one
fabricated by Speakes ... _ were fairly innocuous in and of
themselves.
   But the practice _ if it had become routine, and we have only
Speakes' word suggesting that it didn't _ could have led to all
sorts of unintended difficulties.
   That's especially so in foreign affairs, where the president's
spokesman could, by putting the wrong spin on a statement, easily
create mistaken, even damaging impressions. ...
   The wonder of it all is that the president was ignorant of what
was going on, or, if he wasn't, that he acquiesced in the
deception. But, either way, it would fit an all too familiar
pattern in this White House.

   The Greenwood (Miss.) Commonwealth on Larry Speakes and
presidential quotes:
   Larry Speakes is a distinguished Mississippi son, and the whole
state will grieve with him over his bad fortune in this flap over
manufactured (presidential) quotes. ...
   Speakes lived for years under intense pressure in the demanding
role of White House spokesman, under constant questioning by the
press, before the eyes of the world, and he didn't make a serious
blunder. ...
   In (his) book Speakes said that he was ``clearly wrong'' to have
created the quote(s) but said his intention was to ``spruce up the
president's image by taking a bit of liberty with the P.R. man's
license.''
   Of course, that's precisely that the Washington press corps
accuses White House spokesmen of doing. It also is precisely what
Speakes, when he was press secretary, denied he was doing.
   Truthfulness then, now and in the future must be the goal of
White House spokesmen. When a spokesman's credibility is damaged,
he loses his usefulness.

   The Joplin (Mo.) Globe on the Afghan accord:
   The significance of the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan after
more than eight years of war is not lost on, but probably won't be
advertised by, Democratic leaders of Congress.
   Defeat of the Soviet Union is directly linked to the Reagan
Doctrine's commitment of military support to insurgents who take on
communist regimes around the globe.
   The fighting between opposing Afghan factions likely will
continue in order to establish a new Islamic government. An
independent, non-aligned government in Kabul must remain the
objective of American policy.
   Although it may not result in peace immediately, the accord
signed in Geneva last week was interpreted as a step toward peace.

   The Baltimore Sun on the INF treaty:
   Was Reagan administration testimony on the INF treaty banning
intermediate-range nuclear forces ``authoritative'' and binding on
future amdinistrations?
   Curiously enough, Reagan officials find themselves arguing
vociferously that it was not _ that Senate efforts to give their
interpretations permanence amount to a legislative assault on
executive prerogatives. ...
   What brought this issue to the fore is a persistent Reagan
effort to discard Nixon administration testimony on the 1972
Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty and to offer a broader interpretation
that would permit space-based testing of the Strategic Defense
Initiative.
   Last year Congress turned to its power of the purse to cut off
funds for tests that Nixon testimony would bar.
   But Reagan officials have returned to the fray, even if it means
putting the INF treaty and the coming summit at risk. ...
   We believe an administration that negotiates a treaty should
offer testimony that the Senate can rely upon in giving its assent
to ratification.

   Lawrence (Kan.) Journal-World on Larry Speakes and presidential
quotes:
   So, a former White House press secretary has been caught in the
act.
   Scandalous! Other press secretaries, past and present, have
decried (Larry) Speakes' actions and stated flatly that they would
have nothing to do with such behavior. The vehemence of their
protest almost makes one wonder if they might have something to
hide.
   Speakes was merely telling the press what the president thought
in a way that the president never objected to.
   He probably was wrong to represent some of those views as
verbatim quotes, but it wasn't as if he was misrepresenting the
president's opinion on the issues.
   It's doubtful that Speakes was the first press secretary to
fabricate some golden quotations for the president.

   The Commercial Appeal, Memphis, Tenn., on the foreign trade bill:
   To the surprise of no one who keeps tabs on Congress, the
1,000-page foreign trade bill now nearing completion is riddled
with favors for special interests, some at the expense of
consumers. ...
   Perhaps the most flagrant giveaway _ worth about $100 million _
was slipped in for the Warner-Lambert Co. Its patent on Lopid, a
cholesterol-reducing drug, is due to expire in July 1989, when
generic drug firms could crank it out at lower prices.
   The bill would extend Warner-Lambert's patent for 3{ years. With
a month's supply of Lopid costing between $40 and $70, that would
be dandy for the company's bottom line.
   But the provision would gouge patients and taxpayers, who pay
for the drug through Medicare and Medicaid.

forms:
   A word to the wise ought to be sufficient. Unfortunately, many
of us aren't very wise.
   Otherwise, we wouldn't have waited until April 15 to file our
federal and state income-tax returns.
   For some of us, that annual decision to procrastinate will mean
a deadline missed and a penalty still to be paid. For others, it
will mean a vow to do it on time next year. ...
   But while we profess empathy for procrastinators, we cannot help
but wonder how many of us would have beaten the deadline if only
those infernal Internal Revenue Service forms had been
decipherable, if only the tax simplification we've been hearing so
much about in recent years really meant tax simplification. ...
   For most of us, even those with higher educations and accounting
experience, those tax forms are perfect examples of government

   The Seattle Times on Contra drug dealing:
   A political time bomb ticks away as a Senate subcommittee
investigating narcotics and terrorism raises unavoidable questions
about Reagan administration knowledge of Contra drug dealing. ...
   Former diplomats, senior military commanders, ex-Contra
chieftains, and convicted drug dealers paint an ugly picture of a
pretend war against the cocaine lords.
   In many cases, a veneer of anti-communism was reason enough to
tolerate affiliations with drug traffickers.
   In short, maintaining support for the anti-Sandinista Contras
was more important to the administration than resolutely saying no
to drugs.
   How these compromises will play out in 1988 presidential
politics is unknown, but the testimony and evidence presented to
the committee should sicken North Americans whose daily lives are
tormented by drugs in their homes or neighborhoods.

   There would be no harm in composing statements and issuing them

between the permissible and the impermissible, and (Larry) Speakes

   (President) Reagan has done a lot to hurt his credibility by
making unfounded and sometimes contradictory statements.

   Today's Sunbeam, Salem, N.J., on free heart drugs to needy:
   One of the nation's leading pharmaceutical companies, G.D.
Searle & Co. of Chicago, has announced a remarkable program to help
the indigent obtain heart drugs: Searle will give them away.
   Last year, the company began giving away drugs for treatment of
high blood pressure and angina. Now Searle is adding five more
drugs to the free list.
   Searle said it was taking the unusual step of giving its
products away because an estimated 37 million Americans ... have no
health insurance.
   Importantly, the company says the drugs will be available for as
long as a patient needs them, ... remarkable because treatment for
high blood pressure and many heart problems is lifelong.
   Every American deserves adequate health care, and Searle's
generosity is helping to make that possible.

   It's astonishing enough that former White House spokesman Larry

how could Reagan let such a practice go on?
   It should bother the American people that they have a leader who

   Los Angeles Herald Examiner on fighting drug trafficking:
   In a meaningless show of looking tough on drug trafficking, the
Senate voted (April 14) to sanction Mexico for not doing enough to
stop the flow of cocaine across its border into the United States.
   But the senators, or at least 63 of them, didn't acknowledge
that the border has two sides, and that the United States is
supposed to be looking after one of them.
   Nor did they seem swayed by the reality that shutting off
drug-fighting money to a strapped nation would only strengthen the
drug lords. ...
   Against great odds Mexico has begun cracking down on smuggling
and corruption among officials responsible for enforcement. For a
poor nation beset with a plethora of serious problems, such action
is especially heartening.
   But here in the prosperous United States, where the drug market
is, there's been only token action. ...
   If senators want to do something about drugs, the list of
suitable actions is longer than the U.S.-Mexico border. Bashing our
neighbors for the sake of a headline won't make a dent in the
problem.

   The state highway patrol has charged a
bus driver with driving too fast after a chartered bus carrying
Pinecrest Elementary School students crashed, leaving 14 people
hospitalized today.
   The bus, with 48 people students and adults aboard, rolled over
twice on Interstate 77 south of Rock Hill on Tuesday, authorities
said. Everyone aboard was injured, although most of the injuries
were not serious.
   One of the students, a girl, was in critical condition with a
head injury at Charlotte Memorial Hospital, hospital spokeswoman
Amy Farugia said today. Four other victims were also at the
hospital.
   Carolyn Carpenter, a spokeswoman at Piedmont Medical Center in
Rock Hill, said nine people were hospitalized there today.
   The highway patrol has charged the driver, Howard D. Boles, 31,
of Greenwood with driving too fast for conditions, even though he
was observing the speed limit and road conditions were good, said
department spokesman Frank Braddock.
   State Trooper Jerry Farrell said Boles' ``attention was
distracted'' when he reached down to get a soft drink and the bus
left the road.
   The bus is owned by Boles Bus Service of Greenwood, troopers
said. Boles was cut on the head but was not hospitalized.
   A caravan of three buses _ the school's entire fourth grade _
was returning from Discovery Place in Charlotte to Greenwood. The
students were among about 2,000 school children visiting Discovery
Place, said Executive Director Freda Nicholson.
   Nine people were admitted to Piedmont Medical Center in Rock
Hill, according to spokeswoman Carolyn Carpenter. Seven are in good
condition, while one is in satisfactory condition and one is in
stable condition in the intensive care unit, Ms. Carpenter said.
   Ms. Farugia said that in addition to the critically injured
girl, three other students were in good condition at Charlotte
Hospital with cuts and bruises and one adult was in serious
condition with head injuries and a broken leg.
   David Tipps, a construction worker from McAllister, Okla., was
driving behind the bus on his way to Columbia when he saw the bus
swerve off the road and flip over.
   ``There was nothing to make him crash. He just went over,''
Tipps said.
   He said the first drivers on the scene felt helpless because of
the magnitude of the accident.
   ``We just helped who we could,'' Tipps said. ``We grabbed them
and started pulling them out of the bus.''

<HEAD>Murder Charge Dropped Against Teen Who Shot Intruder</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SPARTANBURG, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A magistrate has dismissed a murder
charge against a teen-ager who shot and killed a man as he was
trying to break into the youth's house.
   Solicitor Holman Gossett, who requested the charge be dropped
Tuesday, said a 65-year-old state law gave Ronald James Sutton the
right to use deadly force to protect his home.
   Sutton, 17, was charged with murder after he shot Freddie
Edwards Dawkins Jr., 22, on Easter night. Police found Dawkins'
body outside Sutton's bedroom window, the window screen resting on
his legs.
   The murder charge against the black youth sparked protests from
people who said the case was no different from that of a
11-year-old white boy, Todd Knight, who only days earlier shot and
killed two intruders into his home in Switzer and earned widespread
praise for justifiable homicide.
   Sutton's mother, Irene Jones, said her son was overjoyed with
the news that the charge was dropped. ``I believe he can get back
to a normal life. He was under a lot of pressure,'' she said.
   Spartanburg City Police Capt. John Lee said the charges were
filed because Sutton did not give Dawkins a warning to leave, did
not attempt to escape and did not call police before firing the
shots.
   Lee said the charges were dismissed by Magistrate Georgia
Anderson at Gossett's request and in concert with police
investigators.
   The 1923 law Gossett cited applies to deaths in which ``the
occupant is the slayer and stands on the right to protect
habitation, if he is in his own house and he determines a
trespasser is committing a felonious act.''
   Sutton, a Spartanburg High School sophomore, told police that
someone rang the doorbell at his home four times several hours
after his mother had left for work.
   He was too frightened to answer, but fired the fatal shot
through his blind-covered bedroom window when he heard someone
trying to remove the screen, the teen-ager told police.
   Sutton was charged with murder and spent one-and-a-half days in
jail before his $2,500 bond was set by a circuit court judge.
   ``It was unfortunate that this young man had to go through what
he went through,'' Lee added.

   The government is collecting skulls and
other bones of people massacred earlier this decade, possibly for a
memorial or museum, officials said Wednesday.
   The bones are being gathered in an area known as the Luwero
Triangle, where about 200,000 people are believed to have been
slaughtered between 1980 and 1985 by troops of ousted civilian
President Milton Obote. The victims were accused of backing a rebel
movement of President Yoweri Museveni, who seized power January
1986 from the military junta that overthrew Obote.
   When residents who had fled the region returned home after
Museveni's victory, they collected the scattered bones and piled
them up all over the area. Paul Wamala, chief consultant at the
government Department of Antiquities and Museums, said he knew of
no other place in the world where human skulls are so openly
displayed.
   ``The skulls haunt people, and they are an embarrassment to the
country's visitors,'' said Wamala.
   In addition to using the bones in a memorial or museum, Wamala
said the government is considering simply storing them.

   The strike was called Tuesday by 19 industrial trade unions
protesting the higher petroleum prices.
   Meanwhile, police used tear gas to break up demonstrating

   President Corazon Aquino on Wednesday
relieved the Philippine commander of her country's U.S. military
bases, which are the subject of ongoing joint talks.
   Mrs. Aquino ordered armed forces chief Gen. Renato de Villa to
step down from his post as commander of U.S. bases in the
Philippines, the presidential palace announced.
   Although the Philippine government technically commands the six
U.S. installations, they are controlled by the United States.
   It was not clear how the move might affect negotiations on
renewing the agreement allowing the United States to operate the
bases. Philippine officials said it would have no bearing.
   Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos said he recommended the chief of
staff be relieved as commander of U.S. bases because the position
entails additional responsibilities for an already busy man and can
be filled by an officer with a much lower rank. Ramos said the
Philippine commander of the bases should be an officer with a rank
not higher than the commanders of the U.S. facilities.
   No replacement was named.

   A $1.3 million suit has been filed against Hard

sheep dog.
   Warren and Anne Balden alleged in the suit filed Tuesday that
Hard Rock Cafe International Inc., a restaurant manager and the
dog's owner, a cafe employee, were negligent because they allowed
the dog into the restaurant and failed to control it.
   The Baldens say they and their daughter, Elise, were leaving the
cafe on April 19, 1987, when the dog, with its owner nearby,
``seized the face of Elise Balden with its fangs, shaking (her)
body and head like a rag doll.''
   The suit said the girl will require cosmetic surgery. She
received 70 stitches at Presbyterian Hospital immediately after the
incident, Balden said.
   The suit was filed after negotiations failed to produce a
settlement, Balden said.
   Randy Roberts, a lawyer for the cafe, said Tuesday he could not

   Human bones unearthed while a man was

the arms are on the other side of it.''
   A week ago Harry Kennedy was trying to unstop the drainage line
from his washing machine when a helper unearthed the bones.
   ``I was sitting here in the house and went out there to see how
he was doing and he pitched a bone up on the bank,'' said Kennedy,
73. ``I said we ought to stop right here and call the police; I
believe this is a human bone.''
   A sheriff's deputy brought bones from a thigh, pelvis and lower
arm to the county coroner's office, which turned them over to Bass.
   Bass, also a forensic pathologist for the state, said a
preliminary review indicates the bones are from an adult male.

   Soldiers today fought Palestinians protesting
the assassination of a PLO leader, and one Arab was killed. Other
troops blocked Palestinians in the occupied lands from entering
Israel.
   Hundreds of thousands of Israelis gathered in cemeteries
throughout Israel today to remember the 16,450 troops who died
fighting for the nation. In the occupied territories, Arabs hung
black banners and mourned PLO military commander Khalil al-Wazir.
   An army spokesman said Israel would be closed to Arab residents
of the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip through the weekend in an
effort to prevent terrorist attacks during Memorial Day and
Independence Day commemorations, which started Tuesday night.
   Israeli troops also maintained a curfew for a fourth day on 17
refugee camps and towns in the West Bank and six camps and towns in
Gaza to prevent further riots over the death of al-Wazir, who was
killed in Tunis on Saturday.
   Israeli sources have said Israeli commandos killed al-Wazir, who
was buried in Damascus today. The government has not confirmed
Israeli involvement.
   Since the assassination, 21 Palestinians have died in clashes
with Israeli troops.
   According to U.N. figures, 169 Palestinians have been killed
since anti-occupation unrest began Dec. 8. Two Israelis also have
died.
   In Gaza's Nusseirat refugee camp, troops opened fire on
stone-throwing Arabs today, killing 21-year-old Mohammed Hassan
Massar, hospital officials said. Ten Arabs were wounded in clashes
around the occupied lands.
   In a Memorial Day speech, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir told
American Jewish fund-raisers in Jerusalem that what they were
seeing in the 4{-month Arab uprising was ``not demonstrations or
sit-ins. It is war.''
   He also said a public controversy over soldiers' duties in the
West Bank and Gaza would not affect their resolve.
   ``I can tell that they know that what they are doing now is just
as important for the country's future as anything they have done in
the past and we're just as proud of them now as we were then,''
Shamir said.
   Shortly after the speech, sirens sounded throughout the country
for two minutes marking the start of ceremonies at military
cemeteries to honor the 40-year-old nation's war dead.
   Memorials also were held at thousands of elementary and high
schools around Israel, where teachers held special classes and
pupils laid wreaths and recited poems in honor of those who fell in
battle and training accidents.
   At Denmark High School, one of Jerusalem's largest Jewish
secondary schools, bereaved parents and teachers urged pupils to
learn from the patriotism of peers who gave their lives for their
country.
   ``Everyone has to defend our homeland,'' Russian-born Moses
Cyrus Weiler, 81, who lost two sons in Israeli wars, told 11th
graders in one classroom. ``If you continue in this path, there
will be value to your life.''
   The Memorial Day observance ends tonight with a torch-lighting
ceremony at Mount Herzl that starts the Independence Day
celebration.
   Security was intense, with military barricades blocking roads in
the occupied lands. Officials said only Arabs with special permits
would be allowed into Israel until the Independence Day
celebrations end Thursday night.
   Places of entertainment, including movie theaters and
restaurants, were ordered closed for the day.
   Palestinians leaders urged Arabs to protest the deportations
Tuesday of eight more Arabs from the occupied lands to Lebanon.
They include six accused of the April 6 stoning attack on Jewish
hikers in the West Bank village of Beita, where a 15-year-old
Israeli girl, Tirza Porat, was killed.
   The United States condemned the expulsions, saying they would
exacerbate tensions in the territories Israel seized in the 1967
Middle East war.
   Police Commissioner David Krauss said extra police were posted
throughout the country and about 1,000 officers would patrol
Jerusalem until the Moslem sabbath ends Friday.
   ``There is information that terror organizations will try to
carry out attacks,'' he told Israel radio.
   The deportations brought to 16 the number of Palestinians
expelled from Israel this month.
   The Israeli army Tuesday said some of the Beita deportees had
planned the attack on the Israeli hikers and hoped to hold some of
the teen-agers hostage. It was the first time the army had
suggested the attack was premeditated. Two Palestinians also were
killed in the clash.
   A police report said investigators could not determine if the
bullet that killed Miss Porat had been fired from the gun of one of
the Israeli guards accompanying the group or from another weapon.
   An army spokesman said Tuesday that separate investigations by
the army and Israel's Shin Bet security service had not been
completed.

   The White House today expressed concern over
delays in ratifying a U.S.-Soviet nuclear-arms treaty and said it
would be ``most unfortunate'' if the agreement were not approved by
the time President Reagan goes to Moscow for summit talks.
   The treaty, which requires the elimination of medium-range
nuclear weapons, has been stalled by a number of issues, most
recently the question of whether futuristic weapons are banned by
the pact.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said a failure to ratify
the treaty by the time Reagan meets with Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev May 29-June 2 would be a setback to ongoing negotiations
to curb strategic nuclear weapons under a so-called START treaty.
   Fitzwater said that to have the medium-range weapon treaty
ratified before the summit ``would be an important boost to our
negotiations on the START treaty.
   ``Similarly, if it's not (ratified) it would tend to dampen, I
think, the prospects for serious START progress. It would not be
helpful and we would hope that the Ccongress would be able to
ratify it before we go.''
   The treaty is not expected to come to the Senate floor until May
9 at the earliest, leaving only 2{ weeks before Reagan's departure.
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., said Tuesday that the question about
futuristic weapons is still unanswered despite a statement by a top
Soviet official.
   ``I think the question still needs clarification and there's got
to be some more work done on this issue,'' he said.
   Fitzwater said the issues raised in the Senate ``are all
important and they certainly deserve clarification. We believe they
have received it.''
   The administration argues that the treaty will not affect
development of futuristic weapons.
   As Nunn expressed his reservations, the House was voting 393-7
in favor of a non-binding resolution approving the
Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty.
   The vote has no effect on the Senate, which has exclusive
constitutional authority to ratify treaties.
   Nunn commented a day after the State Department forwarded to the
Senate the transcipt of a letter by Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
A. Shevardnadze to Secretary of State George P. Shultz.
   In the letter, Shevardnadze said the Soviets agree with the
United States that the INF treaty signed last Dec. 8 bans
``futuristic weapons'' such as lasers or beam weapons.
   The treaty eliminates existing missiles with a range of 300 to
3,400 miles, but Nunn and other senators have questioned how the
pact0would affect weapons in that range0dlatcoumd be1d

<HEAD>Iraqis Dig in On Recaptured Faw Peninsula</HEAD>

   An Associated Press reporter was taken on a tour
of the Faw Peninsula by the Iraqi military, and filed the following
report:

   Iraqi troops who recaptured this
strategic peninsula from Iran found heavily shelled buildings
plastered with pictures of Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini and anti-Iraqi slogans.
   They also discovered piles of Islamic religious books, many
written by Khomeini, that Iranian soldiers left behind in an
apparently hasty retreat.
   An Iraqi general told reporters here Tuesday that Iraqi forces
had completely dislodged Iranian troops from the Faw peninsula,
recapturing territory seized by Iran 26 months ago. Hundreds of
Iranian prisoners were shown to reporters.
   Other Iraqi reports on Wednesday acknowledged that pockets of
Iranian resistance remained on the peninsula.
   The general, speaking at his command post near the oil refinery
city of Faw, identified himself only as a representative of the
Iraqi high command. The reporters were the first to reach the Faw
peninsula since it was recaptured.
   The general spoke as Iraqis were building new fortifications
after recapturing the triangle of land at the southern tip of their
country. It was the first major Iraqi offensive since 1986 in the
7{-year-old Persian Gulf war.
   Hundreds of military vehicles headed toward Faw on Tuesday to
reinforce elite presidential guard units that spearheaded the
36-hour assault Sunday and Monday.
   The city of Faw, which reporters visited 15 hours after the
Iranians were driven out, was quiet. There were, however, sporadic
shellings which Iraqis said came from new Iranian positions in
thick palm groves on the eastern bank of the Shatt Al-Arab
waterway, the southern border between Iran and Iraq.
   Ration storage areas had been left intact, suggesting a speedy
Iranian retreat.
   Iraqi military officials said many weapons were seized, without
giving numbers. Reporters saw ammunition left intact in storage
depots.
   About 250 Iranian prisoners-of-war were shown to reporters, and
many of them talked about being surprised by the Iraqi offensive.
   One Iranian prisoner, Mohammed Idage, 49, said he was in a
bunker, which provided shelter from Iraqi shells, when he was
caught by Iraqi soldiers.
   ``I thought the Iraqis were too far away, and nobody told us
that they were approaching so rapidly,'' he said. ``It was a real
surprise to see Iraqis all around the bunker.''
   The general said the offensive was launched to regain control of
the 35 square-mile triangle of territory occupied by Iran in
February 1986. He said the Iraqi air force and navy joined ground
forces in the operation.
   He also denied Iranian charges that Iraq used the nearby Kuwaiti
island of Bubiyan as a staging position for part of the offensive.
   ``The Iranians are trying to conceal their crimes against our
brothers in Kuwait and their hijacking of the Kuwait aircraft,'' he
said.
   He referred to claims that Iran was behind the hijacking of a
Kuwait Airways jumbo jet which took the plane to Iran, Cyprus and
Algeria before it ended Wednesday.
   As the general spoke, a powerful explosion rocked the ground
nearby.
   ``Not to worry, it's outgoing,'' said an Iraqi captain. ``The
Iranians are there,'' he said, pointing to the date palms across
the waterway.
   He said Iraqi troops continued to shell those positions in a bid
to prevent any reorganization of Iranian troops.

   U.N. efforts to end the Iran-Iraq war,
already near collapse, suffered another setback from this week's
Persian Gulf military confrontation between the United States and
Iran.
   The Security Council passed a resolution July 20 demanding an
immediate cease-fire in the 7{-year-old war, but Iran has accepted
it only with reservations.
   Since the resolution was passed, the war has intensified with
missile attacks on cities by both sides that have killed hundreds
of people, a new Iranian push into Iraqi territory on the northern
front and reports that Iraq has used chemical weapons.
   Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar gave the council a
gloomy picture last week of his four rounds of talks with Iranian
and Iraqi envoys, concluding that their positions were
``insufficient'' for a cease-fire.
   On Tuesday, he expressed grave concern about further escalation
of the war. The 15-member council has been deliberating informally
on how or whether its resolution can be enforced.
   Diplomats said privately the U.S. campaign for a council arms
embargo on Iran was undermined by U.S. Navy attacks on two Iranian
oil platforms Monday and ensuing operations in which six Iranian
naval vessels were sunk or disabled.
   They said the confrontation made it less likely that governments
would take sides with Washington to punish Iran for what now
appears to be a conflict with a superpower.
   The Soviet Union, which has delayed action on an embargo,
condemned the U.S. attacks and the diplomats said Soviet suport for
a ban on arms sales to Iran had become unlikely.
   U.S. officials said, however, that they hope the clash between
the U.S. and Iranian navies will help break a Security Council
impasse.
   ``We think this proves more strongly than ever the need for an
enforcement resolution'' imposing a weapons ban on Iran, U.S.
Ambassador Herbert S. Okun said Monday after briefing the council
on events in the gulf.
   Washington said its actions were ``necessary and proportionate''
response to an Iranian threat, and legitmate self-defense. The oil
platforms were attacked as retaliation for a mine that damaged a
U.S. Navy frigate last week and wounded 10 sailors.
   Iran vowed retaliation against the United States and Ambassador
Mohammad Mahallati said Tuesday:
   ``The American aggression has strongly and substantially
weakened the Security Council resolution and violated its call for
restraint by all states.''
   Resolution 598 demands an immediate cease-fire and troop
withdrawal, outlines a peace plan and calls for enforcement
measures. It was seen in July as a rare example of U.N. toughness
and a test of its ability to put teeth in demands for an end to the
war.
   Iraq has said it accepts the resolution, but Iran wants the
cease-fire linked to identification of Iraq as the aggressor. Iraq
invaded Iran in September 1980 after several border skirmishes.

   A bill that would allow U.S. residents who are
victims of torture overseas to seek civil damages in federal court
was approved unanimously Wednesday by a House Foreign Affairs
subcommittee.
   The measure, sponsored chiefly by Reps. Gus Yatron, D-Pa., Peter
W. Rodino Jr., D-N.J., and Jim Leach, R-Iowa, would cover all
torture victims, either foreign aliens or American citizens, living
in the United States if they have exhausted all legal remedies in
the country where the torture occurred.
   The families of victims of political killings also would be
entitled to seek damages under the bill.
   Persons who actually committed or ordered torture or political
killings could be sued if they visit the United States.
   The measure has been endorsed by the American Bar Association
and Amnesty International USA, which told a March 23 subcommittee
hearing that the bill would serve as a deterrent to the ``human
rights epidemic'' of torture which is practiced systematically in
30 countries.

   John Shepherd, the man Attorney General Edwin
Meese had picked to become his deputy, formally withdrew his name
from consideration today, saying, ``My wife and I were not prepared
for the pressures'' to which he would be subjected.
   Meese had announced April 5 that Shepherd, a St. Louis attorney,
was his choice to become deputy attorney general, replacing Arnold
Burns, who announced March 29 he was leaving and whose last day on
the job will be Friday.
   Shepherd, in a statement, said he had felt it was his duty to
accept Meese's offer ``without hesitation.''
   But, he added, ``I am concerned about the personal and financial
sacrifices my family and I were being asked to make in order to
accept a very difficult short-term appointment. My wife and I were
not prepared for the pressures to which someone recommended for
this position at this time would be subjected.''
   He said he and Meese had discussed his predicament and, ``while
I am pleased to learn that there is no obstacle to my nomination, I
have asked him to withdraw my name from consideration.''
   Meese, in a statement of his own, said, ``Regrettably, intense
media attention on Mr. Shepherd's impending nomination has had a
severe impact on him and his family.''
   Shortly before Meese recommended Shepherd for the Justice
Department post, a former bookkeeper from Shepherd's law firm
testified that she had had an affair with Shepherd. The bookkeeper,
who was convicted of embezzlement, claimed Shepherd had told her to
write checks to herself. Shepherd denied that he had an affair with
her or that he had authorized her to write checks.
   In addition, it was disclosed after Meese's April 5 announcement
that Shepherd belonged to an all-male club and to an all-white
country club.
   But Meese said that ``all the information raised in the media
since he was named was known to the White House and the (Justice)
department in advance and has been fully investigated by the FBI in
its background review.''
   ``There is nothing whatsoever to suggest that Mr. Shepherd would
have had any confirmation problems,'' Meese said.
   Shepherd earlier had been recommended for a job in the Justice
Department by E. Robert Wallach, a longtime Meese friend now under
indictment in the Wedtech scandal, sources said today.
   The sources, who requested anonymity, said Wallach had proposed
Shepherd's name for an unspecified post in 1984 or 1985.
   Department sources said that Meese has been trying since the
beginning of the week to fill the post that Shepherd was to have
taken, following Shepherd's discussion with the attorney general
last Friday in which the former American Bar Association president
said he had reservations about taking the job.
   Burns, in announcing his resignation, said he was doing so out
of concern that the nearly yearlong criminal investigation of Meese
was affecting the Justice Department's operations, morale and
public image.
   Shepherd, 62, was Meese's second choice to take Burns' place.
The attorney general was rebuffed by Philadelphia lawyer and former
federal judge Arlin Adams, who said earlier this month that he had
a heavy caseload at his law firm and pointed out that he had just
joined the firm last year.
   Meese has also not found a replacement for Assistant Attorney
General William Weld, head of the criminal division, who resigned
with Burns.
   Meanwhile, more Justice Department deputies are leaving their
posts in an exodus sparked by Meese's legal problems, virtually
emptying the department's No. 2 office.
   The resignations and transfers make it increasingly difficult
for Meese to recover from the wave of departures.
   The three top aides to Burns are quitting the government or
transferring to new jobs. Department sources said Tuesday that all
three rejected overtures by Meese aides to remain at Justice after
Burns and Weld quit.
   It is customary for the deputy attorney general to pick his own
assistants. But the sources, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said Meese's staff tried to keep top deputies' posts filled
following the resignations of Burns and Weld.
   In addition, deputies' posts in department's No. 3 office are
vacant due to the departure of Associate Attorney General Stephen
Trott, who is now a federal judge.
   In Burns' office, Raymond B. Ludwiszewski, an associate deputy
attorney general who came to the Justice Department in 1985, has
handed in his resignation and is negotiating with private
Washington law firms for work.
   Paul Cassell, a Burns deputy who dealt with issues involving the
department's criminal and antitrust divisions, is transferring to
the U.S. attorney's office in Alexandria, Va., where he will become
an assistant U.S. attorney.
   In a move that has been in the planning stages for some time,
Associate Deputy Attorney General Gregory Walden is to become chief
counsel to the Federal Aviation Administration. One of the
department's top experts in the ongoing criminal investigations of
former Philippines President Ferdinand Marcos, Walden will leave
the Justice Department in a few weeks.

   Andy Warhol's huge and varied personal
collection goes on sale this week, offering a chance to see _ and
buy _ the paintings and pottery owned by the man who brought
Campbell's Soup to fine art.
   Some say the sale provides a prime opportunity to learn what
made the artist tick. If so, the lesson won't be easy.
   Confronted with the 10,000 items on the block, ranging from
Navajo blankets to Edgar Degas sculpture to 134 cookie jars to a
Rolls Royce to a Superman touch-tone telephone, a student of the
world according to Warhol could be forgiven for resorting to Cliff
Notes.
   Warhol ``went shopping six days a week, bless his heart,'' said
John L. Marion, chairman of Sotheby's North America and its chief
auctioneer.
   ``He was interested in form, and shape, and various things that
fascinated him,'' Marion said. ``And, apparently, it fascinated him
more to search out and acquire than it did ever to admire.''
   Warhol, who died at 58 in February 1987, was not known as a
spendthrift. So there must have been some method that led him to
accumulate thousands of objects from a Federal four-poster bed to a
cache of Bakelite baubles, and to horde silver and plastic in equal
measure.
   Marion knew Warhol for 25 years, yet he had no idea the artist
had such an impressive collection of American Classical
19th-century furniture. Or Art Deco furniture. Or silver of such
quality, the auctioneer says, that its like has never appeared at
auction before.
   When Marion lifts his gavel Saturday, he will open one of
Sotheby's longest sales ever for a single collection _ 10 days. The
six-volume catalog, compiled by an unprecedented 22 departments, is
Sotheby's costliest at $95 and its heaviest at 8\ pounds.
   Sotheby's budgeted at least $500,000 to promote the sale and,
Marion says, ``I'm sure that's been exceeded.'' Road shows
exhibited portions of the collection in eight cities in four
countries; there were exclusive cocktail parties in Warhol's
Manhattan townhouse.
   For the first time in its history, Sotheby's will hold a Sunday
bidding session, giving ordinary people a shot at some of the more
affordable collectibles. The auction house even printed a leaflet
for neophytes explaining how to bid. The first day's viewing drew
6,000 browsers _ three times the normal.
   Officially, the sale is expected to bring in $10 million to $15
million. But Sotheby's says the estimates are based on market value
without the ``Warhol factor'' that could boost prices. Proceeds go
to the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts.
   This sale offers a bit of Warhol for just about everyone. The
estimates range from $50-$75 for a ``Campbell Kid'' soup bowl
(inscribed ``Andy'') to $350,000-$450,000 for a Jasper Johns oil
painting titled ``Screen Piece.''
   There are works by Warhol contemporaries, including Johns, Roy
Lichtenstein and Cy Twombly, and others by such artists as
Pierre-Auguste Renoir and Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec.
   There's a 19th-century Chippendale style pine chest estimated at
$300-$400, and a ``fine Chippendale mahogany camelback sofa''
expected to fetch 100 times as much.
   More than 1,000 pieces of jewelry are on sale; Warhol collected
everything from Bakelite bracelets to ruby and diamond earrings.
   ``I never saw him wear a single jewel,'' wrote Suzie Frankfurt
in the catalog, ``until one night at Studio 54. I saw a slight
bulge under his Brooks Brothers shirt which turned out to be a
rather grand emerald necklace, so I suppose he occasionally wore
them in secret.''
   There are also more than 300 watches, from Cartier to Popeye.
``During the years that I knew Andy, he only wore one watch: a
woman's gold mid-seventies Rolex,'' wrote Rupert Smith.
   Warhol's outstanding Art Deco collection includes a spectacular
series of silver tea and coffee services. The artist himself
reportedly preferred to dine on Fiesta Ware. That, too, is on the
block.
   Some, like Paige Powell, a friend of Warhol and advertising
director of his Interview magazine, say this diverse and varied lot
offers a unique insight into the artist and shouldn't be divided.
   Warhol was ``by far the most important artist in the 20th
century,'' Powell said. ``The importance of (his collection) will
grow as time goes on. ... Even King Tut is a good parallel.''
   Powell wrote to at least 30 art patrons and other billionaires,
seeking someone to bid for the entire collection. So far, she's had
no luck.
   Marion, however, said there would be no purpose in keeping the
collection together, and maintains Warhol ``would have adored'' the
auction.

   Restaurateur Sonny Bono has taken
the oath of office as mayor of this desert resort and gotten a hug
from one of his major campaign critics.
   Bono, 53, joined the ranks of celebrity mayors on Tuesday.
   He won his seat April 12 just as another well-known small city
mayor, actor-director Clint Eastwood, was easing out of his job as
mayor of Carmel on California's rugged coast near Big Sur.
   A celebratory barbecue before the swearing-in, Bono buried the
hatchet with one of his chief detractors, outgoing Mayor Frank
Bogert.
   During the campaign, Bogert, 76, acidly observed that the
difference between Bono's mayoral bid and that of Eastwood was
comparable to the difference between chicken manure and chicken
salad.
   But all was friendship and enthusiasm Tuesday, as Bogert gave
Bono a hug.
   ``That's the way they do it in Mexico,'' Bogert said, squeezing
the incoming mayor. ``That's called an `abrazo.' Here's a big
abrazo for Sonny Bono.''
   Bono responded graciously, saying ``Muchas Gracias.''
   Cher's ex-husband won his new post a day after the actress he
crooned ``I've Got You, Babe'' with during the 1960s won the 1988
best actress Oscar for her performance in ``Moonstruck.''
   Bono was swept into office, winning over a field of six
lesser-known candidates, promising to revive some of the tourist
splendor Palm Springs has surrendered in recent years to
neighboring desert communities where celebrities like former
President Gerald Ford and Frank Sinatra have chosen to live.

   Unemployment in Hungary has risen from
10,000 jobless last year to 30,000, and is expected to go up by
another 19,000 yet this year, a labor official was quoted as saying
Wednesday.
   Csaba Halmos, president of the National Office for Wages and
Labor, also said 10,000 jobs will be created this year.
   According to the Communist Party daily Nepszabadsag, which
carried Halmos' remarks, the labor official said about 700,000
people change jobs each year out of Hungary's work force of 5
million.
   Rising unemployment in Hungary is largely a consequence of
austerity measures introduced by the government that include
streamlining or closing companies that chronically lose money.
   Halmos was quoted as saying 19,000 jobs probably would be
eliminated this year.
   He said unemployment was likely to increase, but called for
caution in claiming it could rise to 100,000 to 150,000. According
to official estimates, there could be as many as 200,000 jobless by
1990.
   Halmos, however, predicted 100,000 to 150,000 new jobs could be
created in restructured factories or in private enterprise and
cooperatives. He gave no timetable for such a development.
   About 10,000 workers received retraining last year, and found
new jobs, Nepszabadsag quoted Halmos as saying.
   According to statistics published in January, 70 percent of
Hungary's jobless are unskilled workers who find it harder to find
employment.

   A sweeping education bill expanding services
to the nation's students won final congressional approval today,
but a section outlawing pornographic telephone messages seemed sure
to wind up in court.
   The Senate passed the multibillion-dollar education measure on a
voice vote and sent it to the White House for President Reagan's
expected signature.
   The House pasesd the bill Tuesday on a 397-1 vote, but only
after a series of complicated maneuvers to attach a ban on
dial-a-porn phone services. Rep. Philip Crane, R-Ill., was the lone
member voting no.
   ``No court has ever upheld a complete ban on non-obscene,
so-called `indecent' speech,'' said Barry Lynn, legislative counsel
to the American Civil Liberties Union. He said the ban, born of
concern for children, intrudes on the privacy and free-speech
rights of American adults.
   The Hawkins-Stafford School Improvement Act authorizes up to
$8.3 billion in spending next year on elementary and secondary
school programs, with more than half the money going to
disadvantaged children at risk of failing.
   It contains new programs to prevent dropouts and help high
school students with weak skills, and greatly expands drug abuse
education and magnet schools. New money also was earmarked for
math, science and foreign-language programs.
   ``This is one of the most important bills that we will ever
pass, one that we want to pass if we want to be competitive,'' said
Rep. William Goodling, R-Pa., a former school superintendent.
   The bill, a compromise between the versions passed by the House
and Senate, was named for Rep. Augustus Hawkins, D-Calif., chairman
of the House Education and Labor Committee, and retiring Sen.
Robert Stafford, R-Vt., former chairman of the Senate education
subcommittee.
   Passed with only one dissenting vote in each chamber, the bill
would have glided through House-Senate negotiations and through the
House except for the telephone pornography ban grafted onto the
Senate measure by Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C.
   Negotiators had agreed on a compromise under which telephone
customers in most of the country would not have access to the lewd
messages unless an adult called the phone company to request a
hook-up. The compromise ultimately was killed and the Helms ban
restored.
   The largest single program in the school improvement act is
Chapter 1, which pays for tutoring and other services to
disadvantaged children at risk of academic failure. School
districts could receive basic grants totaling up to $4.7 billion in
fiscal year 1989, a $400 million increase over current spending.
   Fiscal 1989 initiatives in the bill include $50 million for
``Even Start,'' to jointly educate poor preschool children and
their illiterate parents; $50 million for dropout prevention
demonstration projects; and $200 million to improve basic skills of
high school students.
   The act also includes the following major programs, with
authorized 1989 funding levels that represent the maximum Congress
could appropriate:
   _$580 million for the education block grant, of which at least
80 percent goes to local school districts. Current spending is $508
million.
   _$250 million for the math and science education program
designed to improve critical skills in those areas, about twice as
much as current spending.
   _$250 million for drug abuse education programs, $30 million
higher than current spending.
   _$200 million for bilingual education, more than $50 million
higher than current spending.
   _$200 million for adult education, some $75 million higher than
current spending.
   _$165 million for magnet schools, which encourage racial
integration by providing special curriculums. Current spending is
at $72 million.
   The bill also authorizes smaller amounts of money for a variety
of other programs, including foreign language training, and
upgrades the Education Department's statistical division.

   The wife of presidential candidate Albert Gore
Jr. raised controversy when she spearheaded a campaign to put
warning labels on rock music albums with sexually explicit lyrics.
   But another presidential contender _ Jesse Jackson _ was
treading the same ground long before Tipper Gore made headlines.
   Jackson in 1977 put on a ``Music and Morality Conference'' at
his Operation PUSH in Chicago, urging that voluntary standards be
drawn up by the record industry and radio stations, newspaper
clippings show.
   ``We hope this conference will send a message to the industry
because Chicago is such a major market,'' Jackson was quoted as
telling the Chicago Tribune. Like Mrs. Gore, Jackson said he was
not advocating censorship. He said he wanted ``voluntary standards
by the radio stations and by the record companies themselves.''
   ``Love and romance are part of life and we are not suggesting
that these subjects should be censored in record lyrics,'' Jackson
wrote in a letter published in the newspaper on May 28, 1977.
   ``Our appeal has been directed toward pornographic lyrics that
degrade human sexuality rather than uplifting the human spirit.''
   Jackson said a recording at the time, ``Let's Make a Baby,'' was
``one in a whole series, increasingly explicit and dominant in a
market almost exclusively directed at children.''
   He called on the record industry to ``assess the state of the
art.''
   Mrs. Gore created an uproar in the music industry, and cost her
husband some support among the Hollywood set, with her crusade
against sex, drugs and violence in music over the past few years.
   Tipper Gore, a co-founder of the Parents Music Resource Center,
testified before the Senate Commerce Committee, of which her
husband was a member, in 1985 about what the group felt was the
danger of explicit lyrics.
   The Recording Industry Association of America later reached an
uneasy agreement with the center, stating its members would place
warning labels on records,such as: ``Explicit Lyrics _ parental
advisory.''
   Mrs. Gore 's leadership brought opposition from such
entertainers as Frank Zappa. He disagreed with Mrs. Gore's
assertion that lyrics could promote deviant behavior, saying, ``I
wrote a song aboiut dental floss but anyone's teeth get cleaner?''
   Jackson has not made rock music a part of his campaign or
speeches. But he frequently speaks against ``babies making babies''
and urges young people not to waste their minds with drugs.
   In his 1977 letter to the Tribune, he said the crusade against
``sex-rock'' was part of Operation PUSH's educational arm,
PUSH-Excel which was aimed at motivating young people to study.

<HEAD>Dukakis: `Nothing is Inevitable'</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis, the undisputed front-runner at
last in a two-man race for the Democratic presidential nomination,
remained ever cautious on Wednesday and said ``nothing in this
world'' is certain.
   Dukakis met with rival Jesse Jackson early Wednesday to receive
congratulations on a sweeping New York primary victory, but the
Massachusetts governor declined to meet with loser Albert Gore Jr.,
citing the press of state business in Boston.
   Dukakis flew back to Boston after an early morning meeting with
reporters and was taking a day's respite from campaigning. He
resumes the Democratic campaign Thursday in Ohio and Pennsylvania.
   Although his victory was broad and impressive, Dukakis faced
repeated questions about his dispassionate campaign style and polls
showing that large numbers of Democrats longed for some other
candidate to be in the race despite his convincing victory here.
   ``I'm somebody who I think tends to grow on people as they get
to know me,'' Dukakis responded.
   ``As it continues to go on, we'll see stronger and stronger and
more intense support. But obviously for many people I'm a
relatively new acquaintance, and it's going to take a while to
build that kind of support,'' he said.
   Dukakis' big victory and Gore's failure left the governor with a
strong lead in delegates, although he acknowledged a delegate
majority was not yet within his reach. But New York pared Gore from
the field, making it hard to envision Dukakis failing to win the
nomination.
   Campaign manager Paul Brountas said New York's returns would
encourage uncommitted delegates and those still backing losers to
move toward Dukakis, but he said the campaign was not trying to
produce a visible stampede of support within the party. Such a big
move too soon could risk alienating Jackson supporters that the
nominee needs in November.
   Dukakis said a one-on-one race with Jackson will be conducted
without division or attacks. He predicted that by the end of the
primaries in June ``I doubt either one of us will have a numerical
majority'' of delegates.
   ``But I hope I have a substantial lead and the kind of lead that
will then make it possible for me to unite the party, to produce a
clear majority,'' he said.
   Dukakis said he was unable to meet with Gore, who was poised to
withdraw at an announcement Thursday in Washington.
   He called a Gore withdrawal ``something he has to decide,'' but
said he would help Gore raise money to eliminate a campaign debt
that approaches $2 million.
   He said Gore, who launched strong attacks on Dukakis as naive
and inexperienced in foreign policy, ``wanted to meet this morning
and I just couldn't do it.''
   ``I've got to get back to Boston. I've got to get a very
important meeting ... of my anti-crime council and a very full
agenda, and I just had to get back there. But I'm sure we'll be
talking. He's a good guy and I've enjoyed getting to know him and I
respect him.''
   He did meet with Jackson and later said it was ``too early to
say'' what role he sees for Jackson. Asked if he would consider
Jackson as his running mate, Dukakis said, ``I wouldn't rule
anything in or out at this point.''
   ``He's obviously an important leader in our party and in our
country. We respect each other,'' he said.
   Dukakis refused to claim the role as likely nominee, saying
``nothing in this world is inevitable and we've got much to do.''

   Michael Dukakis opened his Wednesday morning
news conference with an expression of concern for eight reporters
in his traveling contingent who were aboard a plane that made a
tense but safe landing Tuesday night.
   The pilots of the chartered Falcon 20 jet, which was following
Dukakis' plane from a side trip to Philadelphia, received a warning
indicating a malfunction with the landing gear.
   The reporters' jet landed at LaGuardia Airport on a runway lined
with fire trucks and other emergency vehicles.
   ``In addition to my respect for you as professionals I want you
all to be safe and secure,'' Dukakis said.
   Then, turning to press secretary Mark Gearan, Dukakis said, ``We
weren't responsible for the landing gear, were we?''

   Morton Thiokol conducted a full-scale
test of a space shuttle booster rocket with deliberately flawed
seals today to see whether hot gases would penetrate the joints as
they did when the Challenger exploded.
   ``It looked good. We've got to wait and see the data, but you
always like to see it go off on time and see it run 120 seconds,''
said J..R. Thompson, director of NASA's Marshall Space Flight
Center in Huntsville, Ala.
   ``If we get good results, then we'll press on at the Cape,'' he
said, referring to preparations for a mid-August launch of the
shuttle Discovery at Cape Canaveral.
   The two-minute firing of the 126-foot-long, 1.2 million-pound
booster at 11 a.m. was the third in a series of five full-scale
tests scheduled before the shuttle returns to space.
   The test was designed to reveal any weaknesses in the new
booster, which was redesigned following the Jan. 28, 1986,
explosion of the shuttle Challenger that killed seven astronauts.
   For the test, the rocket was assembled with deliberate flaws in
the sealing material of two joints to see if hot gases would
penetrate them. Flawed seals have been tested previously in
short-duration tests, but never in a full-scale firing, Raab said.
   A plume of bright yellow flame erupted from the rocket, sending
a cloud of grayish-brown smoke and dust billowing hundreds of feet
in the air. Cattle grazing nearby bolted at the roar and hundreds
of company workers and school children cheered and applauded.
   Company engineers and NASA officials planned a briefing after
they conduct a preliminary inspection of the prone rocket. A
detailed analysis of the results was several days away.
   The Challenger disaster was blamed on a booster rocket joint
improperly sealed by a rubber O-ring, which allowed hot gases to
escape and ignite the shuttle's external fuel tank.
   The redesigned joint has a third O-ring to protect the primary
O-ring from hot gases. The old joint had two rings. A gap between
sections of insulation in the old joint is now filled with putty.
   Engineers also have added a metal lip, called the capture
feature, that rests between the insulation and the O-rings. The lip
is designed to prevent the joint from bulging under the pressure of
burning gases during launch.
   
   The remaining full-scale tests are scheduled for June and July.
If all goes well, the shuttle's first post-Challenger launch is set
for sometime in mid-August.
   The test comes at a critical time for Thiokol. The company is
NASA's sole supplier of booster rockets, and views a successful
launch as a sign that the stigma of the Challenger tragedy can be
set aside.
   While praising Thiokol's work in the redesign effort, NASA also
has asked Congress for a $1.2 million government plant to build
advanced space shuttle booster rockets. The space agency wants the
proposed plant to be accessible by rail and water, which would
exclude Thiokol's plant in land-locked Utah.

<HEAD>Mental Stress May Be as Disruptive to Ailing Hearts as Hard
Exercise</HEAD>

   Public speaking and other stressful encounters can
be as potent as hard exercise in disrupting the heart's blood
supply when people have underlying heart disease, a study shows.
   The researchers said their work gives scientific weight to the
widely held belief that mental stress can overtax the heart and may
trigger heart attacks.
   They found that giving a public talk about one's shortcomings
can be as disruptive to the heart as exercising to exhaustion.
However, it also appears that mental stress is a possible cardiac
problem only for people with heart disease, not for those with
healthy hearts.
   The chief author of the study recommended that people suspected
of having heart disease _ those who smoke or have high blood
pressure, high cholesterol or a family history of heart trouble _
should be checked.
   ``Nothing should come out of this work about what patients
should or shouldn't be doing in their daily lives,'' said the
researcher, Dr. Alan Rozanski. ``I think people should exercise,
and you can't go around worrying about mental stress.''
   The study, conducted at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los
Angeles, is the latest of several recent reports about a newly
recognized condition called silent ischemia.
   Ischemia occurs when the heart muscle fails to get enough blood.
Sometimes this shortage causes chest pain known as angina. But
experts have learned that more often, ischemia is painless, or
silent.
   If the ischemia lasts for more than 20 or 30 minutes, the
oxygen-starved section of the heart dies, resulting in a heart
attack. Although the crisis usually passes in a few minutes without
permanent damage, it may be a warning of more serious heart
problems to come.
   It is usually diagnosed by a stress test using an
electrocardiogram, but an attack has to come during the test for
the condition to be detected.
   In their study, published in Thursday's New England Journal of
Medicine, Rozanski and colleagues studied 39 heart patients and 12
healthy people. While the men and women did a series of mildly
stressful mental exercises, the doctors used a common diagnostic
procedure called nuclear cardiology to watch their beating hearts.
   They found that a variety of mental gymnastics, such as
repeatedly subtracting seven from a four-digit number, could
trigger ischemia. The worst was asking people to give a five-minute
talk in front of two observers about their personal faults and bad
habits.
   ``It really brings home the notion that silent ischemia doesn't
just occur at extreme levels of exercise or in the highest risk
patients,'' commented Dr. Sidney Gottlieb of Johns Hopkins
University. ``These are everyday patients who are doing quite well
with coronary disease who, with minor levels of stress, are having
significant amounts of ischemia.''
   Rozanski noted that while the stress of hard exercise often
caused pain, mental stress rarely did.
   ``For years and years, there has been a folklore about what
mental stress can do in people with heart disease,'' he said. ``But
now for the first time we have evidence of that and an opportunity
to study the relationship between mental stress and heart disease.''
   Dr. Andrew P. Selwyn of Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston
has reached similar conclusions. He equipped heart patients with
portable electrocardiogram machines and matched their episodes of
ischemia with what they were doing. Less than a quarter of them
occurred during exercise.
   In an editorial in the journal, Selwyn said the arteries of
people with heart disease apparently fail to expand and contract
properly in reaction to stress. When healthy hearts need more
blood, the arteries open up to increase the flow.
   However, when the arteries are clogged with fatty desposits, the
opposite seems to occur. They respond to physical or mental stress
by squeezing tight.
   When silent ischemia is discovered, people can be treated with
medicines, coronary bypass surgery or angioplasty, a common
procedure that uses balloons to open up clogged heart arteries.

   Police swung bamboo sticks and fired

squatters, and at least 30 people were hurt, officials said
Wednesday.
   The landless peasants rioted Tuesday after police tried to evict
them from a site in the northern town of Rangpur, where they had
settled illegally, authorities said.
   Police acted at the request of the land's owner, according to
the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The squatters
had been on the land for a week.
   Authorities fired warning shots into the air after their
truncheons failed to quiet the rioters, who pelted police with
stones, the officials said. However, the gunfire injured no one.

   A federal judge today dismissed an indictment for
possession of illegal rocket launchers and machine guns against an
international arms merchant.
   U.S. District Judge Edward B. Davis also dismissed a charge of
possession of weapons by a convicted felon against Sarkis
Soghanalian.
   The 57-year-old Soghanalian, a Lebanese national who lives in
Miami, had been scheduled to go on trial on the charges Thursday.
He is still scheduled for trial May 16 in another arms case.
   Davis granted a motion for dismissal filed by attorney Neal
Sonnett on grounds that Soghanalian never had ``constructive
possession'' of arms mounted on a Bell helicopter at a hangar at
Miami international airport.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Robert O'Neill told Davis that after
interviewing witnesses he could not oppose the defense motion for
dismissal.
   But O'Neill said the government is proceeding in the second
case, in which Soghanalian is charged with violating the Arms
Export Control Act by conspiring to smuggle to Iraq combat
helicopters worth $200 million and other arms counts.
   Soghanalian has charged the indictments were returned at the
instigation of Iran.

   Every Friday, hundreds of refugees from
Romania converge on a suburban church, seeking food, work, money or
advice on how to rejoin loved ones they abandoned in a desperate
escape for a better life.
   They are among thousands who have become the first in history to
flee one Soviet bloc nation for another. Hungary took the
unprecedented step in January of refusing to send these people back
to their homeland.
   Most refugees are ethnic Hungarians from Transylvania, a region
of mountains and forests disputed for centuries between Hungary and
Romania and ruled by Romania since 1918.
   Hungary's decision to let the refugees stay has unleashed a
charity effort unseen in Soviet bloc history. Budapest firms have
offered at least 7,000 jobs. Clothing pours into churches and Red
Cross offices, even from abroad.
   As refugees sift through old clothes and wait for work or small
cash handouts, many tell dramatic tales.
   A young father who abandoned his child in Romania beseeches a
Western reporter for help. He spends hours, he says, peering across
the border from eastern Hungary and contemplating a mad dash to get
his 18-month-old baby.
   A teacher sobs as she realizes that her pupils will wait in vain
for her to return from what was supposed to be a short trip to
Hungary.
   On Hungarian TV, a couple touch the nation with their account of
fleeing from Romania by wading through marshes under cover of
darkness.
   Hungary claims that under Romanian President Nicolae Ceausescu,
the culture of Transylvania's estimated 2 million Hungarians,
Europe's largest ethnic minority, is systematically being squeezed
out of existence.
   This alleged oppression and the hardships of day-to-day life in
shortage-plagued Romania have pushed as many as 20,000 to use short
visits to stay in Hungary.
   A few hundred ethnic Romanians have also made the dash through
Hungary's open door, driven by what they describe as extreme
privation.
   ``For a family of four, I got 200 grams (7 ounces) of butter a
month,'' said Cornel Rosca, an economist from Timisoara. ``My dream
in Romania was to eat a roast chicken, which I didn't have for nine
months.''
   Ethnic Hungarians interviewed charged they were increasingly
discriminated against in housing, jobs and education in the last
few years.
   The plight of the ethnic Hungarians has touched a nerve in
Hungary, which is accused by Romania of whipping up sentiment over
Transylvania in order to reclaim the region.
   Budapest students tell of groups of women who marry ethnic
Hungarians in Romania to get them out. Other youngsters journey to
Romania with foodstuffs for relatives or acquaintances.
   A fund set up in March to aid refugees amassed $24,000 in less
than a month despite Hungary's economic crisis.
   For ethnic Romanians it is harder to obtain the work and
residence permits given to ethnic Hungarians to settle. Most of
them want to move on to the West, seeing countries like visa-free
Sweden as an initial goal.
   Even if they have tickets, however, like engineers Maria
Chiorean and Teodor Petrus, they find themselves stopped at the
Hungarian border.
   This shows Hungary's delicate position as a refuge for people
from another Warsaw Pact nation. As dissident critic Sandor
Szilagyi puts it, ``It is unimaginable for the comrades that there
exist refugees from a Socialist society.''
   His unofficial group helping refugees has urged that a United
Nations' office be set up in Budapest to handle the refugees,
organize emigration to the West and reunite parents with spouses
and children still in Romania.
   So far Hungary has rejected the idea of foreign aid and refuses
officially even to use the word ``refugee'' to describe the new
arrivals.
   ``The best solution would be for them to stay at home, even if
they have temporary difficulties,'' said Interior Ministry official
Laszlo Albrecht.
   If more refugees do come, however, Hungary's policy may have to
change, and the popular welcome may run out.
   Hungary may also be forced to seek international help in
reuniting an estimated 2,000 children with parents. The Hungarian
Red Cross says it will write to its Romanian counterpart about the
children this month.
   But pastor Geza Nemeth, a main mover behind church aid for
refugees, bluntly tells refugee parents who leave children behind
to return to Romania.
   ``No pastor is going to help a mother who abandons her child,''
he said.

   The road from here to California for Jesse
Jackson is a rough one, strewn with ballot problems, unfavorable
rules, small numbers of black voters, and big leads for Michael
Dukakis in states from Pennsylvania to Ohio and beyond.
   Eleven primaries remain before the Democratic National
Convention in Atlanta, and only one _ the District of Columbia _
offers Jackson a solid shot  The landscape is particularly difficult now
that Dukakis has
opened a lead in the delegate count and is even winning the
cumulative popular vote _ which Jackson had claimed at victory.
  was the most
important battle. Jackson needs at least two big-state victories in
the next seven weeks to have a hope of pulling back even with the
Massachusetts governor.
   Jackson had a chance in Tuesday's New York primary, where his
base of support was large and the potential for expanding his share
of the white vote seemed substantial. But he fell short, taking
only 37 percent of the vote as Dukakis won half the ballots.
   ``The challenge between Pennsylvania and California and New
Jersey is to keep asserting presidential leadership, keep giving
the nation a real live alternative,'' Jackson said Wednesday. ``I
want to give the nation a real live option between now and June 7,
and I'm going to do that.''
    VA policy that regards alcoholism as misconduct was
challenged by Eugene Traynor, 46, a supervisor in a photography
laboratory in New York City, and James P. McKelvey, 42, an
alcoholism counselor in Washington, D.C.
   Both men, who began drinking when they were children, received
honorable discharges from the Army in the late 1960s. They said
they have abstained from drinking alcohol since the early 1970s,
when they were hospitalized and treated for the condition.
   The VA authorizes payment of education benefits to veterans
within 10 years of their discharge. No benefits are paid after 10
years unless a veteran can show he or she was unable to pursue an
education ``because of a physical or mental disability which was
not the result of such veteran's own willful misconduct.''
   The VA provides an exemption from the 10-year time limit for
alocholism only when it is a secondary sympton of other
psychological problems.
   Traynor and McKelvey filed federal lawsuits claiming the
Veterans Administration was discriminating illlegaly against the
handicapped.
   Federal appeals courts ruled against them in separate cases.
   McKelvey said the high court's decision gives a message ``to
other recovering alcoholics, or more importantly, people that are
out there struggling, trying to get sober, and dying from this
disease. ... I believe that the justices who ruled in favor of the
Veteran's Administration is giving them a license to kill, more or
less. They're saying that the Veteran's Administration can violate
existing federal statutes and get away with it.''
   A VA spokesman, John Scholzen, said the agency would have no
comment until its attorneys have examined the ruling.
   The cases attracted widespread attention with the current
renewed debate over the nature of alcoholism.
   Many programs have developed in recent years that treat
alcoholics as victims of a disease rather than as social deviants
or criminals.
   The psychiatrists' catalogue of diseases, called the Diagnostic
and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, calls alcohol abuse and
dependence a disease and says about 13 percent of all Americans
suffer from it at some point in their lives.
   Dr. David Goldman, a researcher at the National Institute on
Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, said the medical community ``has gone
far beyond'' the debate about whether alcoholism is a disease. Now,
he said, researchers are trying to identify the specific gene that
they believe makes a person ``vulnerable'' to alcoholism.
   Some critics fear the recent trend treating alcoholism as a
disease dangerously removes individual responsibility for such
behavior as drunken driving and spouse and child abuse.
   Norma Phillips, the national president of Mothers Against Drunk
Driving, said her organization welcomes the decision because she
believes it will encourage judges to give tougher sentences in
drunken driving cases.
   ``There are some judges who feel people are not able to make a
decision after they drink,'' said Mrs. Phillips, of Escondido,
Calif. ``They feel they have an alcohol problem so they give
lighter sentences.''
   A spokesman for Alcoholocs Anonymous who asked not to be named
said the question of whether or not alcohol abuse is a disease does
not matter in AA treatment, which calls for group support in
staying sober.
   ``We've never taken any position as to whether or not it is an
illness because it doesn't really matter with our treatment
system,'' the spokesman said.
   There are an estimated 10 million alcoholics in the United
States, including about one million who seek treatment annually in
one form or another.
   In other action, the court:
   _ Ruled that unions may distribute handbills urging consumers to
boycott ``neutral employers'' against whom the unions have no
grievance.
   Voting 8-0 in a case from Florida, the justices said that
although federal labor law generally prohibits unions from engaging
in ``secondary boycott'' picketing of neutral employers it does not
ban non-picketing activities aimed at such businesses.
   In a separate decision, the court ruled by a 6-2 vote in a
California case that employers may be forced to provide free,
internal mail delivery for labor union literature aimed at
organizing employees.
   _ Upheld a law requiring munijcipal or state bonds issued after
June 30, 1983, to be registered before they can be tax-exempt.
   The justices, by a 7-1 vote, ruled that the federal law enacted
to discourage tax evasion in the trading of municipal bonds does
not violate any state's sovereign immunity.
   The alcoholism case is Traynor vs. Turnage, 86-622.
   The psychiatrists' catalogue of diseases, called the Diagnostic
and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, calls alcohol abuse and
dependence a disease and says about 13 percent of all Americans
suffer from it at some point in their lives.

   Sen. Albert Gore Jr. is ending his campaign for
the 1988 Democratic presidential nomination after a weak
third-place showing in the New York primary, sources said today.
   The word from back home in Tennessee was that Gore should
``gracefully get out.'' Sources close to his campaign, speaking
only on condition of anonymity, said the candidate was grappling
with whether to hold his delegates until the convention.
   Gore, winless since Super Tuesday six weeks ago, scheduled an
announcement for Thursday in Washington.
   He told supporters in New York that he would be consulting with
advisers ``over the next few days ... and we're going to decide
among ourselves how best we can carry on the cause that we have
been advancing.''
   Campaign manager Fred Martin said Gore had not decided whether
to drop out.
   As the New York votes were tallied and the scope of Gore's loss
became clear, he congratulated Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis,
calling it ``somebody else's super Tuesday.''
   ``I want to congratulate Mike Dukakis for a really impressive
victory. New York is a real marathon and he beat us by a mile,'' he
said.
   Gore talked about the prospects of Democrats in the fall, rather
than his own uncertain future.
   ``I believe that together we are going to teach the Republicans
a lesson they won't soon forget in November,'' the Tennessee
senator told supporters gathered at a midtown hotel.
   Meanwhile, Tennessee Gov. Ned McWherter, a key Gore adviser,
said the senator was considering quitting the race.
   ``I told him he should gracefully get out and let this one
conclude,'' McWherter said from Nashville, Tenn. He said Gore had
called him from New York while awaiting primary results.
   ``The options are to continue campaigning and affect the
dialogue with the party, to suspend the candidacy but remain a
candidate or to withdraw,'' Martin said.
   Gore congratulated the second-place finisher in New York, Jesse
Jackson, praising his ``tremendous showing.''
   Early today, Gore paid a ``courtesy call'' on Jackson to tell
him of his plans for the next several days, said Gerald Austin,
Jackson's national campaign manager.
   Gore said his wife, Tipper, had gone on to Texas for a
fund-raiser set for tonight ``because we need the money.'' Gore
said he planned to meet her there.
   Gore's campaign is reported to be $1.6 million in debt, and he
had needed to win 20 percent of the vote in New York to be eligible
for federal matching funds.
   Martin discounted reports Tuesday that Gore had begun recalling
campaign workers from Pennsylvania, the next primary state. He
blamed Gore's poor showing in New York on lack of money and name
recognition and the perception by some that it was a two-person
race.
   Gore, at 40 the youngest candidate, joined the race June 29 at
the urging of a group of wealthy Democrats convinced that only a
Southerner could win in 1988.
   He made some early forays into Iowa, but when the waters proved
chilly, he declared Iowans had too much influence on the process
and said he would risk skipping the crucial caucus state. When
polls indicated a weak showing in New Hampshire, he left the North
altogether and headed to his native South to make a stand on Super
Tuesday.
   For one day, his strategy looked brilliant. He won six states on
March 8 and jumped immediately into the front tier with Dukakis and
Jackson. But the Gore campaign apparently had not looked beyond
Super Tuesday. With no one except the candidate apparently in
charge, the Gore campaign lurched into Illinois, Michigan and then
Wisconsin, gathering a total of 435 convention delegates along the
way.
   Of those delegates, only two came from the huge New York bloc of
255 up for grabs Tuesday. Gore pulled only 10 percent of the vote
here, far behind Dukakis' 51 percent and Jackson's 37 percent.
   The only consistent theme of Gore's campaign of late had been
attack. He launched regular salvos at Dukakis and Jackson, saying
it was ``nothing personal'' but the voters deserved to know the
differences among the candidates.
   In New York, Gore opened with a strategy centered on criticism
of the other two candidates, but when supporter Koch picked up the
theme with a vengeance, even Gore seemed to cringe.
   ``I never wanted to stop Mike Dukakis or stop Jesse Jackson,''
Gore said Tuesday night. ``I just wanted to start Al Gore.''
   Gore resisted criticizing Koch, but made it clear the mayor
spoke only for himself. After the polls closed, he thanked Koch for
his support, but noted, ``he ignored a lot of advice that he got
from people around him.''

<HEAD>Reagan-Era Deficits Will Burden U.S. Until Next Century, Democrats
Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN KOMAROW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan's years of budget and trade
deficits will preoccupy policy makers through the end of the
century as they struggle to correct the shortfalls without plunging
the nation into economic decline, a congressional committee said
Wednesday.
   ``This is a legacy of sharp imbalances _ imbalances which cannot
be sustained,'' Sen. Paul Sarbanes, D-Md., chairman of the Joint
Economic Committee, said Wednesday in releasing the panel's annual
report. ``They represent growing claims against our future.''
   The Democratic-controlled panel's study, which Republican
committee members labeled as politically tainted, called the Reagan
deficits ``the legacy of experiment'' in supply-side economics.
   ``The process of correction will define the course of the
nation's economic policy for the remainder of the century,'' it
said.
   Last fall's federal deficit-reduction agreement between
President Reagan and congressional leaders was ``only a first
step'' toward controlling the record red ink in the federal budget.
The Treasury's debt, less than $1 billion when Reagan was elected,
will be nearly tripled by the end of his term.
   Meanwhile, the ``stunning deterioration'' of the U.S. trade
position _ from the world's largest creditor to its largest debtor
nation _ means the nation will more than ever have to consider
other nation's interests in making its own economic decisions, the
report said.
   ``Previous forecasts of a significant drop in our net imports
have not been borne out, however, as the competitive effects of the
declining value of the dollar have been slow to be realized,'' it
said. Correction of the trade deficit is a long-term problem, it
said.
   The report hesitated to predict when a recession will occur, and
noted that despite last year's stock market collapse, consumer
spending has remained strong.
   ``Should a recession occur, the federal budget situation would
deteriorate rapidly, risking a serious disruption in financial
markets,'' it said.
   The report's recommendations include constant attention to the
domestic and foreign trade deficits along with increased investment
in education and job training.
   ``Perhaps most important, we face a serious deficit in our stock
of human capital, following years of neglect of education and
skill-training for the American work force,'' it said.
   The committee report echoed many of the economic themes
Democratic candidates have been emphasizing this year.
   Republicans on the committee released a dissenting version of
their own, emphasizing the length of the current economic expansion
and disputing Democratic claims that the wealthy have done better
than the poor and middle class under Reagan.
   ``The Democratic report is not close to what we Republicans
think is the state of the economy,'' said Rep. Chalmers Wylie of
Ohio, the senior Republican on the committee. ``The Reagan years
have been good for the American people.''
   ``I don't think this is a picture of gloom and doom,'' said Sen.
Bill Roth, R-Del., who co-sponsored the 1981 tax cuts. ``Nothing
can be further from the truth.''
   ``Never has the foundation of our economy been stronger,'' the
GOP report said.
   Rep. Alex McMillan, R-N.C., disputed the Democratic picture but
also said the burdens of the budget and trade deficits could not be
ignored.
   ``What we need ... is less of a political document and more of a
straightforward appraisal of where we go from here,'' he said.

   A jury today sentenced the owner of a
lion that attacked a young girl to 10 years probation and a $5,000
fine, and a judge ordered the man to sell his exotic animals and
stay away from children.
   The jury had convicted Gary Durkovitz, 35, of injury to a child
last week, but deliberated on the sentence for another 2{ days.
   Durkovitz's pet lion ``Samson'' attacked Roxanne Hernandez, 8,
at the Texas Flea Market on Oct. 10, 1987, in Houston.
   State District Judge Ted Poe imposed additional terms of
probation that included 20 hours per month of community service
work.
   Durkovitz, who is from Houston, must dispose of all of his
exotic animals, must stay away from children and also serve 30 days
in Harris County jail, ordered the judge.
   Jurors took about five hours to convict Durkovitz, but
deliberated for more than 15 hours over the penalty.
   Harris County prosecutors had asked for the maximum punishment
of 10 years in prison and a $5,000 fine, but defense attorneys
requested probation.
   Durkovitz, who had taken his 350-pound lion to previous shows at
the flea market, was walking his lion out of the building when the
attack occurred.
   Samson attacked the little girl when she walked in front of him
and tore off part of her skull. The girl, whose brain was exposed
after the attack, was hospitalized for a month and was unable to
return to school until February.
   She has undergone reconstructive surgery and faces more surgery
to restore part of her missing skull and a bald spot on her head.
   Her mother, Roxanne Hernandez, testified the girl wears a wig or
cap in public and that she has trouble concentrating.
   Durkovitz said that he had taken all the precautions he knew of
to prevent an attack.

   Conservationst John Muir, once ridiculed as
loving trees more than people, was praised on the 150th anniversary
of his birth for the foresight that saved such natural treasures as
Yosemite and Sequoia national parks.
   Muir, who founded the Sierra Club, died in 1914, but the
wilderness areas he helped preserve are a living legacy for
generations of Americans, said his successors in the environmental
movement.
   On Thursday, observances are planned at Muir's home in Martinez,
at his parents' homestead in Wisconsin and in Dunbar, Scotland,
where Muir was born April 21, 1838.
   ``Over the past 20 years, he's re-emerged as the patron saint of
the Sierra Club,'' said Mike McCloskey, chairman of the
environmental group Muir organized in 1892. ``He never fell into
obscurity, but he's being held now in the highest esteem that he
has been since his death.''
   McCloskey and others said Muir's legacy was twofold: As a
conservationist, he believed in preserving wilderness for its own
sake. But the scrappy outdoorsman also realized it was necessary to
create a political constituency to protect wild places.
   ``I think he had an enormous effect on what happened in this
country in conservation,'' said former Sierra Club President David
Brower, 75, who has gained notoriety in his own right as a high
priest of the environmental movement.
   Muir's sesquicentennial comes as Interior Secretary Donald Hodel
considers the feasibility of tearing down the dam that broke Muir's
heart.
   Muir died barely a year after President Woodrow Wilson signed
legislation to build a dam in Yosemite National Park, which flooded
Muir's beloved Hetch Hetchy Valley. The project formed a reservoir
that remains San Francisco's primary source of water.
   ``Muir argued that the area was a second Yosemite Valley in
terms of quality and deserved to be protected, and indeed it was
supposed to be part of the national park,'' McCloskey said. ``It's
a great blot upon the record of national parks in the United
States.''
   By most accounts, Muir was an odd and eccentric character, at
times as prickly as a thistle transplanted from his native Scotland.
   His right eye was permanently skewed _ the result of an
industrial accident that nearly blinded him when he was 28. His
beard often grew so long and unruly that it swept his chest like a
broom. In photographs, his hair appears untamable.
   As a student at the University of Wisconsin in 1861, Muir was
invited to a reception, where he was so awestruck by a piano that
he actually climbed inside the instrument to examine its workings.
   Still, his genius was evident in his tremendous energy, first as
an inventor, then later as a mountaineer, essayist and
conservationist.
   And though he traveled throughout the United States and Alaska,
``Yosemite was the area that came to possess him,'' said Ed
Wayburn, a San Francisco physician who has been on the Sierra
Club's board of directors since 1957.
   He first arrived in San Francisco in 1868, and by his own
account went straight to the Yosemite Valley. He determined that
glaciers had carved the breathtaking valley, a contrary notion at
the time, and his first magazine articles published in 1874 brought
him almost instant fame.
   In the ensuing decades, Muir gained stature as a strident, but
eminent spokesman for nature and an implacable opponent of
destructive mining, logging and development.

<TEXT>
   Lloyd's of London insurers are charging twice as
much to insure ships sailing the Persian Gulf after U.S. and
Iranian forces clashed in the waterway earlier this week, a
spokesman said Wednesday.
   The war-risk premium doubled Tuesday to 2 percent, said the
spokesman. For a 14-day voyage to Kuwait, insurance doubled to
$200,000 on a $10 million hull.
   ``It's in response to the recent incidents in the gulf,'' he
said. ``I think the (gulf insurance) rates have moved in fits and
starts. If we have one or two weeks without major incidents, I
think they'll go down again.''
   Cargo insurance premiums remained largely unchanged, he said.
   For voyages to ports of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab
Emirates in the southern gulf, the rate doubled to 1.5 percent of
the value of a hull from 0.75 percent, said the spokesman, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The U.S. Navy sank or damaged six Iranian vessels and destroyed
two offshore oil platforms Monday. It was the biggest skirmish with
the Iranians since the U.S. Navy began escorting Kuwaiti ships in
the gulf in July last year. Iran claimed it downed a helicopter.

<HEAD>New AIDS Data May Show Spread In Asia</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New data from intravenous drug users in
Bangkok, Thailand, may be evidence that AIDS is ``smoldering'' in
Asia, an official of the Agency for International Development told
Congress Wednesday.
   Dr. Jeffrey Harris, the agency's AIDS coordinator, said a report
on Bangkok addicts came earlier this week from the World Health
Organization. It put their infection rate at 16 percent in the
first three months of this year, up from only 1 percent among the
same group last year.
   ``There's a fire raging in the Caribbean,'' Harris said. ``It's
smoldering in Latin America and it may be beginning to smolder in
Asia.''
   He said the worst reported infection rates in the Caribbean are
in Haiti, the Dominican Republic and Trinidad and Tobago.
   Bradshaw Langmaid, chairman of the agency's working group on
AIDS, said people used to wonder if Asians were to some degree
immune from the disease. Both Langmaid and Harris warned against
drawing firm conclusions from the limited data available.
   They testified before the foreign operations subcommittee of the
House Appropriations Committee.
   Langmaid told a reporter after the hearing that there is great
danger of AIDS spreading in Thailand through prostitutes, who are
often the sexual partners of addicts. Thailand is a favorite
vacation spot for many people in Asia.
   He cited one group of prostitutes that has been studied in
Nairobi, Kenya. Their rate of infection with the AIDS virus was 4
percent in 1981, 65 percent in 1985 and 95 percent in 1987.
   Langmaid said the spread of AIDS in Asia may be at an earlier
stage. There is evidence the disease existed in Zaire as far back
as 1976, but testing in Thailand only began about three years ago.
   In a statement submitted to the subcommittee, Langmaid said,
``in general, Asian governments view AIDS as a less urgent problem
and have moved more slowly to undertake AIDS prevention and control
efforts.''
   ``The government of the Philiippines is a notable exception,
having sought our support in mounting an extensive education
campaigm,'' he said.
   The agency got $30 million for AIDS control in the Third World
for the year that will end Sept. 30, and has asked Congress for the
same amount in the following year. Langmaid said additional amounts
will be spent for anti-AIDS programs by other related programs of
the agency, including its Fund for African Development.
   AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, is a contagious
disease that attacks the body's immune system, rendering it
incapable of resisting other diseases and infections.
   The incurable condition is believed caused by an unusual virus,
now called human immunodeficiency virus or HIV. AIDS is spread most
often through sexual contact, needles or syringes shared by drug
abusers, infected blood or blood products, and from pregnant women
to their offspring.

   Cristina Ford, second wife of the late Henry Ford
II, has sued her former husband's estate for alimony payments of
$5.4 million in a dispute that involves Ford's tax status.
   The couple's 1980 divorce settlement gave Mrs. Ford $9.25
million in alimony, most of which was to be paid in quarterly
payments of $100,000 through June 1, 2001.
   The $100,000 due March 1 wasn't paid, said Frank Donovan, Mrs.
Ford's Detroit lawyer. The suit was filed Tuesday in Palm Beach
County, Fla.
   Kathleen Duross Ford, Ford's third wife, claims his death in
September changed his tax liability and affects the payments.
Cristina Ford says it didn't.

couple's property.
   Susan G. Hudnut, in the petition filed Tuesday before Superior
Court Judge Gerald S. Zore, said the couple's 13-year marriage was
irretrievably broken.
   ``The action speaks for itself,'' the mayor said in a statement.
``It 's a regrettable situation, but there is no need to comment

   Former Gov. Lester Maddox said he may go to
court after losing an effort to have his property rezoned for a car
care center.
   The Cobb County Commission voted 5-0 Tuesday against a change
which would have allowed the construction of a Firestone Tire &
Rubber Co. center where his ranch house stands.
   ``It's discrimination against me and my wife as property
owners,'' Maddox said. ``I don't think their decision is going to
hold up in the courts.''
   About 13 of Maddox's neighbors appeared at the commission to
support him; eight turned out in opposition.
   Maddox contended he should be allowed to sell his 1.24-acre lot
for the car center because his neighborhood has turned into a
commercial area.

   Comedian Whoopi Goldberg was refused service in a
plush restaurant at the hotel where she is staying, even though she
said she was ``clean and not offensive.''
   Ms. Goldberg, in Atlanta for performances of her one-woman show,
was dressed in blue jeans, tennis shoes and a sportshirt when she
tried to have lunch Tuesday at the Ritz-Carlton Atlanta. General
Manager Darrell Sheaffer told her she could not be served unless
she changed into more formal attire, she said.
   She told Atlanta radio station WVEE on Wednesday that strict
dress codes like those at the Ritz-Carlton should not apply ``when
you have the money to spend and you're clean and presentable.''
   ``The Ritz-Carlton is not in the business of setting social
mores or standards. We do have to respect the wishes of our other
guests who do come in semiformal attire,'' said Ritz-Carlton
spokeswoman Gayle MacIntyre. ``We talked to Ms. Goldberg about it
and she understood.''
   She added that the hotel served lunch to Ms. Goldberg in its
lobby, but not in the restaurant.

   Ilona ``Cicciolina'' Staller, the porno star and
Italian parliamentarian, said Wednesday she took an AIDS test and
passed.
   ``I'm perfectly healthy,'' she said.
   Staller said she took the test last week following the recent
death of American pornography actor John Holmes, her partner in a
movie shot in Italy last year.
   She denied reports that Holmes died of AIDS.
   ``Though I knew Holmes had died of colon cancer, I took the test
to show that I am not afraid,'' she said.
   Staller said she also needed the test for her frequent foreign
travels.
   She said she was leaving Thursday for Tokyo, where she planned
to meet with the Japanese prime minister.
   Staller was elected last June to the Chamber of Deputies on the
ticket of the tiny Radical Party.

   Rocker Eddie Van Halen, stricken with a
tropical virus while vacationing in Fiji, left Cedars-Sinai Medical
Center today after two days of treatment.
   ``The doctor gave him a clean bill of health. He is getting
ready for rehearsals of `Van Halen's Monsters of Rock Tour,'''
publicist Maureen O'Connor said shortly after Van Halen, 33, went
home to Malibu.
   Three other entertainers _ actor James Garner, comic Sid Caesar
and ex-TV star Morey Amsterdam _ remain hospitalized at
Cedars-Sinai.
   ``Yes, we're down to three now,'' said medical center spokesman
Ron Wise.
   Garner, 60, entered the hospital on Monday, while Caesar, 66,
and Amsterdam, 76, have been confined to the medical center for
several days.
   Amsterdam, best remembered as Buddy on ``The Dick Van Dyke
Show,'' had blood clots removed from each leg and ``he's doing very
well,'' said Wise. It wasn't known when Amsterdam would be released.
   Caesar, who had hernia surgery two weeks ago, was being treated
for an infection, the spokesman said.
   ``He's doing quite well and should be in the medical center
through rest of the week,'' said Wise.
   Garner was undergoing a series of tests prior to surgery
Thursday on his aorta, which carries blood away from the heart.
   ``It's major surgery and they are going to operate and take care
of it,'' Garner's assistant Maryann Rea said.
   Garner, best remembered by television viewers of the old
``Maverick'' and ``Rockford Files'' series, was nominated for an
Oscar for his starring role in the movie ``Murphy's Romance'' and
he starred in ``Victor Victoria.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   The Army does not have the required systems in
place to adequately control government-furnished parts and supplies
provided to military contractors, according to a congressional
study released Wednesday.
   The General Accounting Office report, released by Sen. John
Glenn, D-Ohio, also said Army contractors are being permitted to
requisition material from Pentagon supplies without being
identified as contractors, as required by regulations.
   Glenn said the Defense Department estimated that Army
contractors held about $2.8 billion in government-furnished
material as of the end of fiscal 1987.
   ``We have created a large potential problem by giving
contractors ready access to billions of dollars' worth of
government property,'' said Glenn. ``Fiscal restraint should not be
AWOL at the Army.''
   Government-furnished material, or GFM, includes parts,
assemblies and other materials used in the production of tanks,
aircraft and ships.
   The Pentagon provides the material to contractors when it is
determined to be in the government's best interest. And the Army
allows contractors to obtain the material through direct access to
the defense supply system.
   ``The Army does not have in place the management control and
reporting systems that DOD requires to adequately control GFM
provided to contractors,'' the GAO concluded.
   The GAO, an investigative arm of Congress, said the Army expects
to have a new management-control system in place by June 1989.

<TEXT>
   The furor over $980,310 donated to help
a 7-year-old boy get a liver transplant prompted a Senate committee
Wednesday to approve a bill to establish stricter regulations of
charitable contributions.
   Ronnie DeSillers of Miami died last April while awaiting his
fourth liver transplant at Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh.
   Earlier this year, that state filed an administrative complaint
against his mother, accusing her of violating the state's charity
law by using some of the funds for personal expenses, including
rent and a car telephone.
   She was fined $1,000, but may contest that at a May 10 hearing,
said David Adams, spokesman for the Department of State.
   Current state law says a charitable account opened for a
beneficiary should be used only for that person.
   Maria DeSillers has denied wrongdoing, saying she doubted the
accuracy of a state audit that showed she had received $980,310 in
donations for her son's liver transplant and related medical
expenses. The donations included $1,000 from President Reagan and
$32,000 from sailors aboard the USS John F. Kennedy.
   The bill approved unanimously by the Senate Appropriations
Committee would apply to people who collect $10,000 or more in
donations. It specifies that no more than 20 percent of the
donations can be used for administrative costs and living expenses
and says unused portions should be returned to donors on a pro rata
basis.
   A first-time violation would be punishable by 60 days in jail, a
$500 fine or both. Subsequent violations are punishable by a year
in jail, a $1,000 fine or both.
   The legislation now goes to full Senate.

   Boxes of food, blankets and clothing were
distributed to nearly 1,000 hungry migrant workers who have arrived
at farm-labor camps well ahead of the summer harvest season.
   The food distributed Tuesday was part of the five tons of
staples donated by retailer Fred Meyer Inc. at the Salvation Army's
request to feed the 3,000 to 5,000 people who have come early to
rural Washington County, west of Portland.
   Ten tons of potatoes were donated by Troutdale farmer Howard
Winters, who has promised 200 tons more, and 22 tons of dried beans
were donated by the Salvation Army.
   Maj. Mervyn L. Morelock of the Salvation Army's Cascade Division
estimated it will take $240,000 worth of food to feed the workers
for the eight weeks before the strawberry harvest begins. So far,
$850 cash has been donated, he said.
   The county has about 31 labor camps that house from 12 to 700
workers each. All the camps are full.
   ``These are clean, respectable, hardworking people,'' said Verla
Fuller, director of Housing Services of Oregon, which has
distributed food baskets at camps for several years. ``They come to
work, not to ask for a handout.
   ``You can't help but fall in love with them. They thank us, they
share part of their life with us. There are 13- and 14-year-old
boys here who don't have their families with them,'' she said.
   Arturo Ruiz, 20, who hitchhiked to Oregon with his older
brother, is in the United States for the first time. They came
early because they did not know when the season started, and in
Mexico there is no way to earn a living, he said.
   To survive, Ruiz collects worms in cans and sells them for fish
bait. On a good night he makes $10. He expected to earn about
$1,500 during the picking season _ enough, he said, to live on next
year in Mexico.

   Democratic leaders across the country embraced
Michael Dukakis as their party's presidential front-runner on
Wednesday although most remained reluctant to anoint him as the
nominee.
   ``The fat lady isn't singing yet, but she may be warming up,''
South Carolina state chairman Chris Verenes said in a reference to
the saying that the opera isn't over ``until the fat lady sings.''
   ``I think it surely puts him in the driver's seat,'' said
Maryland party official John Willis.
   The Massachusetts governor's clear-cut win over Jesse Jackson
and Sen. Albert Gore Jr. in New York gave him a substantial lead in
nominating delegates and put a lid, at least temporarily, on
speculation of a deadlocked convention in Atlanta in July.
   ``It won't be a brokered convention. It'll be a first-ballot
victory for Dukakis,'' said Fred Brown, a Democratic National
Committee member from Oklahoma.
   Connecticut Democratic chairman John F. Droney Jr. said he
expects a two-man race through the California primary and then ``I
expect that Governor Dukakis will be nominated on the first ballot
at the convention.
   ``The New York thing almost locks it up for Dukakis, or comes
close to it,'' 1984 unsuccessful candidate Sen. John Glenn of Ohio
said.
   ``I think it's going to be much smoother sailing now,'' Georgia
party chairman John Henry Anderson said.
   Dukakis himself refused to claim the mantle of likely nominee,
saying ``nothing in this world is inevitable and we've got much to
do.'' He was also wise to the roller-coaster ways of Democratic
presidential politics. Several front-runners have come and gone in
1988.
   ``Anything can go bump in the night in Democratic politics,''
Illinois state chairman Vince Demuzio said. ``You have some large
key states that are left. And we probably won't have it locked up
before the convention, but who knows?''
   Lynn Cutler, Democratic National Committee vice chair and an
uncommitted delegate from Iowa, said Dukakis' strong New York
victory ``solidifies his position.'' But she noted ``there is a
tendency in the Democratic Party to slap the front-runner on the
wrist.''
   ``He looks good, but it's not a done deal yet,'' she said.
   New York Gov. Mario Cuomo was annoyed at reporters who asked
Wednesday whether Dukakis' nomination was inevitable.
   ``Of course it's not inevitable,'' he said at a news conference
in Albany.
   What would derail it?
   ``Defeat. Abdication. Surrender. Change of mind,'' the Cuomo
said.
   Most Democratic party leaders and elected officials noted
Jackson's impressive showings so far in 1988 but said it was
difficult to predict his role at the convention, on the ticket or
in a Democratic administration.
   ``Even if he isn't on the ticket, he has such a tremendous
following that he's going to carry a big stick at the convention,''
said Jim Parrish, Kansas state party chairman.
   ``I can't see him in the second spot _ he wouldn't take it and I
don't think it would be offered,'' Democratic National Committee
member William Davis of Indiana said. Instead, Davis speculated
that Jackson would ``wind up being secretary of something.''

   A teacher used mouth-to-mouth
resuscitation Wednesday to revive a pupil's 2-week-old puppy.
   ``I haven't done that since I grew up on the farm, which was a
long time ago. About 30 years ago,'' said Alice Meyer, a
third-grade teacher at Pedersen Elementary School in Altoona.
   Meyer said she occasionally revived newborn calves on her
family's farm.
   First-grader Jessica Ellison brought her puppy to show
classmates, but when she looked in her book bag, the black,
huskie-malamute mix appeared lifeless.
   ``By the time we opened it, the little puppy was suffocated. We
thought it was dead for sure,'' Meyer said.
   Mary Ellison said she was unaware that her daughter had taken
the puppy to school until school officials called her. When she
arrived at school, the puppy had already been revived and Jessica
``didn't seem upset,'' her mother said.
   ``She was saying, `This is my pup,''' Mrs. Ellison said. ``She
was real excited about it.''
   ``The lesson for the day,'' Meyer said, ``is all living things
need air.''

   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater didn't
immediately react Wednesday to pending elections in Denmark, but he
did serve up a tongue-in-cheek, mealtime quip.
   When asked if the administration had any comment on new
elections being called because of a ban on visits by nuclear-armed
warships, he replied, ``Danish means breakfast to me.''
   When reporters assembled in the White House briefing room broke
up in laughter, the spokesman repeated the line.
   Then Fitzwater, his face reddening, said, ``My heart is pure on

   Last week, the Danish Parliament passed a resolution, 75-58,
requiring the government to inform visiting naval vessels of
Denmark's anti-nuclear policy. Prime Minister Poul Schlueter, who
opposed the measure, on Tuesday called an election for May 10 over
the issue.
   State Department spokesman Charles E. Redman said last week that
the United States was ``deeply distressed'' by the resolution.

<TEXT>
   Sen. Albert Gore Jr., his Super Tuesday strategy
a failure outside the South, was packing away his presidential
ambitions Wednesday after his dismal finish in the New York
Democratic primary.
   His campaign more than $1.5 million in debt, Gore flew to Texas
for a $1,000-per-person fund-raiser. He scheduled a Washington news
conference for Thursday, which has been drop-out day throughout
this presidential campaign.
   A campaign source said the Tennessee senator would announce he
was halting his effort.
   Arriving in Austin, Gore told reporters, ``I'm in the midst now
of consulting with friends and supporters all over the country and
asking for their advice on how we can best continue the cause for
which I have been fighting.''
   Gore's departure from the race would narrow the field to Michael
Dukakis, firmly established after his New York victory as the
front-runner, and Jesse Jackson.
   On paper, Gore's strategy for winning the nomination made some
sense. But once the campaign got under way, he always seemed to be
the candidate pursuing the wrong agenda in the wrong place at the
wrong time.
   ``It's very difficult, if not impossible, to develop Democratic
Party support as one who plays the conservative side of the
fence,'' said Peter D. Kelly, chairman of the California Democratic
Party. ``There are just not enough votes out there.''
   Kelly was citing a reality of Democratic Party nomination
politics that Southerners, who once dominated the party, now blame
for recent general election disasters _ landslide losses in three
of the last four presidential contests.
   Ironically, it was Jackson, the most liberal candidate in the
race but also a Southerner, who stood in the way of Gore's plan to
capture the nomination by running as the conservative.
   From the start, Gore was the stranger at the Democrats'
presidential party, arriving unfashionably late and standing alone
to the right of the other guests.
   Gore wanted to be the Super Tuesday candidate for the Democratic
presidential nomination, but he never succeeded in attracting a
following outside his native South. And the vote he received in the
South on that Tuesday, March 8, was not big enough to overcome his
also-ran showings earlier in Iowa and New Hampshire.
   In hindsight, Gore's decision to pass up Iowa as too liberal and
to make far less effort in New Hampshire than his rivals looks like
an insurmountable mistake.
   But, at the time, many Southerners thought Super Tuesday was
going to sharply diminish the influence of the two Northern states
that have dominated nomination politics in both parties for 20
years.
   ``I always felt like, if anybody could pass up Iowa and New
Hampshire, he could,'' said Kathy Vick, Louisiana Democratic Party
chairman. ``That he was an exception to the unwritten rule that you
had to play in Iowa and New Hampshire.''
   Gore finished last in Iowa and fifth in a seven-candidate field
in New Hampshire.
   March 8, the day nearly every Southern and border state held
primaries, was the key to the Gore strategy. But that plan ran into
the formidable presence of Jackson as well as Dukakis' ability to
run well in Florida and Texas.
   Gore came out of Super Tuesday looking good, but not good
enough. In many states in the region, he and Jackson ran one-two,
the senator winning some, the former civil rights activist winning
others. Either man would have done much better on Super Tuesday had
the other not been in the contest.
   Even though Super Tuesday, established Gore as one of the three
leading contenders for the nomination, he never carried another
congressional district in subsequent primaries.
   And he ended up making his last, desperate try for credibility
in a city and state that symbolized social and political views
light years away from the South, his chief ally that
quintessential, abrasive New Yorker, Mayor Edward Koch.
   Koch often overshadowed the candidate he endorsed. The mayor
kept up a drumfire of attacks on Jackson, at one point, saying Jews
and other supporters of Israel would ``have to be crazy'' to vote
for him.
   On election night, the mayor conceded he may not have helped
Gore. He said, ``I think the exit polls show that 2 to 1, people
did not like my criticisms of Jackson.''

   The family of an American engineer slain by the
Contras in Nicaragua filed a $50 million wrongful death suit
Wednesday against rebel leaders and accused the Reagan
administration of covering up the incident.
   Benjamin Linder, 27, of Portland, Ore., was shot to death April
28, 1987, when Contra troops attacked the small hydroelectric
project he was helping to build in northern Nicaragua.
   ``They wounded Ben and then shot him through the head at
point-blank range,'' said Linder's mother, Elisabeth Linder. ``This
is an act of murder and those responsible should pay for their
crimes.''
   The autopsy showed Linder had up to 40 needle puncture marks on
his face, suggesting he may have been tortured before his death,
the family said.
   Asked if the object of the federal suit was to close down the
Contras, Mrs. Linder answered, ``damn right.''
   Named as defendants in the suit are Nicaraguan Resistance
directors Adolfo Calero and Aristides Sanchez, along with military
leaders Enrique Bermudez and Indalecio Rodriguez. The resistance
itself is also being sued. The suit was referred to U.S. District
Judge Stanley Marcus, but no hearing has been set.
   Contra spokesman Jorge Rosales said Wednesday that his group had
no comment on the suit.
   The Linders' attorney, Michael Ratner of the New York-based
Center for Consititutional Rights, said the Reagan administration,
which strongly supports the Contras in their effort to oust the
leftist Nicaraguan government, had tried to thwart the family's
investigation.
   ``The U.S. role is, we believe, very strong in the coverup,''
said Ratner. He said the U.S. government could be added to the suit
_ filed in Miami because the Contras have their headquarters here _
or could be sued separately at a later time.
   The State Department coached the Contra unit responsible for the
attack on how to answer questions from people investigating the
killing, and U.S. officials destroyed notes and sketches made
during their own interviews with the rebels, the attorney said.
   Department spokesman Bud Jacobs did not immediately return a
telephone call Wednesday seeking comment.
   The Contras have previously acknowledged Linder's death, but
said only that he was armed and died in a firefight between Contras
and Sandinista troops. The New York Times last year reported that
Contra leaders said privately that Linder had been mistaken for a
Cuban adviser. But the Linder family said his son's presence in the
area was well-known.
   The Linders agreed their son was armed at the time of the
attack, saying that he carried a weapon because of Contra death
threats against co-workers.
   At the news conference, Ratner also displayed a June 1987 State
Department memo showing that a department-hired consultant, Dr. Sam
Zweifel, agreed with the family's autopsy report showing Linder was
shot at close range, rather than in a gunbattle.
   ``I would like to know more about the complicity of the (Reagan)
administration,'' said Linder's father, Dr. David Linder. ``I don't
see why they are so secretive if they have nothing to hide.''
   He said whether or not U.S. government officials knew in advance
of the attack, he held them responsible because they funded and
directed the Contras.
   ``Ben's death was no accident,'' said his father. ``He and his
co-workers were targeted by the Contras because they were bringing
electricity to poor Nicaraguans.'
   Mrs. Linder said trial testimony would show the CIA helped the
Contras chose what places to attack. The attack on the Cua-Bocay
hydroeletric plant was part of a concerted effort by the Contras to
stop rural development projects, they said.

<HEAD>Reagan Intervenes to Avert Chicago Rail Strike</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan intervened Wednesday to avert
a threatened strike against the Chicago and North Western
Transportation Co. by creating an emergency board to investigate
the railroad's contract dispute with the United Transportation
Union.
   In addition to being a major freight hauler of the Chicago and
North Western provides the principal rail service for suburbanites
commuting to work in Chicago.
   Under the Railway Labor Act, the board will report to the
president in 30 days with its recommendations for settlement. The
parties are then required to try to resolve their differences
without a strike during the succeeding 30 days.
   CNW officials maintain they could realize annual savings of more
than $50 million by cutting the two brakemen from current four or
five-man crews, which also include engineers and conductors. The
union has threatened to strike Friday over the issue.
   The White House said the National Mediation Board found that the
threatened strike threatens to deprive several Midwestern states of
essential transportation services.
   The railroad employs more than 8,000 people and is the eighth
largest rail carrier in the United States as measured by revenue
generated. It handled nearly 1.5 million carloads and more than 80
million tons of traffic in 1986.
   ``In addition to its freight-handling activities, the railroad
is the major rail passenger provider for the city of Chicago,
handling approximately 40,000 passengers daily,'' the White House
announcement said.
   ``Alternatives to this commuter rail service are limited. As a
result, the Chicago area would suffer a substantial disruption of
normal business activities, in the event of a strike.''

   Rural high school science students who
sent Mississippi bugs to the Soviet Union are anxiously awaiting a
return shipment of insects from the Moscow Zoo.
   Science teacher Doug Fleury said the work started after students
wanted to recognize Soviet scientific achievements and he began
corresponding with the Soviets for them. Samples of unicorn
beetles, about the size of hen eggs, and velvet ants, a type of
wingless wasp, were sent to Moscow in 1985.
   Now two kinds of giant walking sticks and a giant roach are en
route to this rural area of northeast Mississippi.
   Fleury is pleased.
   ``It's just not done _ a country school swapping bugs with a
major international zoo,'' he said recently.
   On May 2 and 3, Jumpertown High pupils, with former pupils at
Thrasher High School where the work began, will celebrate the
project.
   Brad Fugitt, 18, of Booneville, who graduated from Thrasher last
year, said he had been collecting insects for Fleury for five years
and some of his insects have been sent as far as Moscow.
   ``It kind of feels like an honor,'' he said.
   Fugitt is waiting for a response to a letter he wrote recently
to the Moscow Zoo to invite Russian scientists to participate in an
insect-collecting expedition in Mississippi in June or July.
   Fleury said he has two hopes for the bug exchanges: to send some
of the pupils to the Soviet Union with a shipment of live insects
and to bring someone from Moscow to northeast Mississippi.
   ``It's not unusual for zoo people to have a bigger view of the
world than just geographical boundaries,'' Fleury said. ``The
scientific discipline doesn't have geographical boundaries. It has
biological boundaries.''

   A 275-foot river will be listed in the
1989 edition of the Guinness Book of World Records as the world's
shortest river, thanks to the efforts of fifth-graders at Lincoln
Elementary School.
   Teacher Susie Nardinger and her students received a letter
recently from Guinness officials saying their documentation had
been accepted for the Roe River, northeast of Great Falls.
   The short stretch of water flows past a fish hatchery and is
named for fish eggs.
   The Roe will replace in Guinness the 440-foot-long D River at
Lincoln City, Ore.
   Students launched their efforts in October, and the class
learned how complicated a project can become during the ensuing six
months, Nardinger said.
   ``They learned that they had to work through channels,'' she
said.
   Before Guinness editors would even consider listing it, the Roe
had to be an official river in the eyes of U.S. government
officials.
   Much of the time was spent trying to gain an official blessing
for the river from the Domestic Names Committee of the U.S. Board
on Geographic Names. The committee approved the name of Roe River
on March 10.

<TEXT>
   A woman whose accusations marred John C.
Shepherd's candidacy for deputy attorney general made up nearly
every portion of her background, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch
reported Wednesday.
   Denise Sinner told investigators and employers about attending
college, having terminal cancer and performing well in past jobs.
But people interviewed by the newspaper, including Sinner's former
husband, said she had lied.
   Sinner was convicted in March of stealing nearly $147,000 from
Shepherd's St. Louis law firm while she worked there as a
bookkeeper. Sinner claimed she had had an affair with Shepherd,
that he was responsible for having hired her and that he had told
her to write checks on the firm's account for her personal use.
   Shepherd testified during the trial that all her accusations
were lies.
   The government lawyer who prosecuted Sinner's case has said she
and her lawyer never presented ``one shred of evidence'' to support
her claims.
   Shepherd said Wednesday that he was withdrawing as Attorney
General Edwin Meese's choice to fill the No. 2 spot in the Justice
Department. Shepherd cited the personal and financial toll that
intensive scrutiny had taken on him and his family.
   The Post-Dispatch said its investigation had revealed no
evidence that Shepherd had an affair with Sinner.
   Sinner has no comment on the newspaper's story and has stopped
talking to reporters, a receptionist in the law office where she
works in nearby St. Charles told The Associated Press on Wednesday.
   The Post-Dispatch said it investigated several claims Sinner,
29, had made in the course of a four-hour interview with a reporter
and found numerous discrepancies:
   _Sinner's employment history on the resume she submitted to
Shepherd, Sandberg & Phoenix listed a degree in education from the
Universitat Kaiserslautern in West Germany. But a spokesman for
that school told the newspaper that no record of Sinner's
attendance could be found. Sinner's attorney in St. Louis said he
had been told that her degree was in music from the University of
Heidelberg. Sinner's ex-husband, Michael Sinner, a supervisor at
the jail in Stearns County, Minn., said his former wife dropped out
of high school.
   _She had been fired from her last two jobs _ both times amid
allegations that she stole money from the companies.
   _She fabricated stories about having cancer. One of those
claims, which was accompanied by forged medical records, was the
reason for Sinner's conviction on a charge of making false
statements in her trial in March. Investigators have traced to a
genuine cancer patient the records she submitted as hers.
   _Michael Sinner said his ex-wife was never a music instructor
for the U.S. Army in Germany as she claimed in her resume. Sinner,
who took his wife to Germany while he was in the Army, said her
only formal music training was with ``Miss Henderson'' in
Paynesville, Minn., their hometown.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Wisconsin lawyer trying to convince the
Supreme Court that communities violate free-speech rights when they
ban picketing at private homes ran into a buzzsaw of hostile
comments Wednesday.
   ``We don't claim a right to harass,'' Steven F. McDowell of
Milwaukee said in behalf of two anti-abortion activists who want to
picket a doctor's home. But several justices seemed dubious.
   ``You want to hassle this doctor,'' Justice Antonin Scalia said.
``You want to stick your thumb in his eye. Isn't that what this is
all about?''
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justice Thurgood Marshall
repeatedly asked McDowell why his clients' freedom of speech could
not be served by picketing Dr. Benjamin Victoria's places of
business rather than his home.
   At one point, Rehnquist suggested that a ban on residential
picketing could become more acceptable if there exists ``an
opportunity to bring the message home someplace else'' such as
Victoria's offices.
   And Justice Anthony M. Kennedy pressed questions about ``a right
to a quiet street.''
   Anti-abortion activists in the spring of 1985 demonstrated in
front of Victoria's home in Brookfield, Wis., denouncing him as an
abortionist and a ``baby killer.''
   Victoria practices medicine at offices in Milwaukee and
Appleton, Wis.
   The demonstrators picketed Victoria's home on at least six
different occasions, with the groups ranging in size from 11 to
more than 40 people.
   During the month the picketing occurred, the Brookfield Town
Board enacted an ordinance outlawing ``picketing before or about
the residence or dwelling of any individual.''
   Harold H. Fuhrman of Milwaukee, the town's lawyer, told the
justices Wednesday the town council was ``appalled at this invasion
of privacy.''
   He said the ordinance was aimed only at pickets who concentrated
on one particular home, and not those who chose to parade through a
neighborhood with their messages.
   Fuhrman also said the ordinance allowed picketing in the town's
two commercial areas.
   The anti-abortion groups stopped the picketing, but two of the
demonstrators, Sandra C. Schultz and Robert L. Braun, challenged
the ordinance in court.
   A federal trial judge barred Brookfield from enforcing the
ordinance, and an evenly divided 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
upheld the judge's ruling.
   The justices' decision is expected by July.
   The case is Frisby vs. Schultz, 87-168.

<HEAD>White House Prods Senate to Ratify INF Treaty Before Summit</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The White House prodded the Senate on
Wednesday to approve a nuclear-arms treaty with the Soviet Union,
saying it would be ``most unfortunate'' if the agreement is not
ratified by the time President Reagan goes to Moscow for summit
talks in late May.
   The treaty, banning all U.S. and Soviet intermediate-range
missiles, is not expected to come to the Senate floor until May 9
at the earliest, leaving only 2{ weeks for debate before Reagan
leaves for Moscow.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said ``we're very
concerned'' the treaty might not be approved in time. ``I think it
would be most unfortunate'' if that happened, he said.
   Fitzwater said ratification of the Intermediate-range Nuclear
Forces, or INF, treaty would have an effect on negotiations to curb
the deadliest class of nuclear weapons _ strategic arms.
   To have the INF treaty signed before the summit ``would be an
important boost to our negotiations'' on strategic weapons, the
spokesman said.
   ``Similarly, if it's not signed, it would tend to dampen, I
think, the prospects for serious ... progress'' on a strategic
weapons treaty, he added. ``It would not be helpful and we would
hope that the Congress would be able to ratify it before we go.''
   Even if the INF treaty is ratified, administration officials
doubt that a strategic arms agreement will be ready for signing at
the summit.
   After a three-night rest stop in Helsinki, Finland, Reagan will
arrive in Moscow on May 29 for his fourth meeting with Soviet
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   The two leaders will see each on each of the five days Reagan is
in Moscow. The president also will have separate schedule of his
own.
   For example, he will hold a meeting with Soviet writers, artists
and film makers, visit a monastery and also confer with Soviet
refuseniks _ Jews denied permission to emigrate.
   White House planners expect that a highlight will be a
presidential address to Soviet students, followed by a
question-and-answer session with the audience. The event is
expected to be broadcast on live television in the United States.
   Reagan also plans to end the visit with a news conference.
   ``The INF ratification is important for what it says about the
United States' commitment to arms control and therefore helping
make progress in the START (strategic arms reduction) talks,''
Fitzwater said.
   ``All of our discussions with the Congress had indicated that
they would be able to ratify the treaty before we go to Moscow,''
Fitzwater said. ``That has been our expectation ... We still think
that is possible and we hope that the Congress will stick to that
schedule.''
   The latest snag in the ratification process is the question of
whether the treaty bans futuristic weapons such as lasers, particle
beams and other devices, as well as existing weapons.
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze, in a letter to
Secretary of State George P. Shultz, said the Soviets agree with
the United States that the treaty bans futuristic weapons.
   The treaty eliminates existing missiles with a range of 300 to
3,400 miles, but some senators have questioned how the pact would
affect weapons in that range that could be developed in the future.
   Once the treaty is on the Senate floor, the agreement likely
will encounter stalling tactics from Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., and
other foes.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Donald D. Engen, the former Federal Aviation
Administration chief, accused the Department of Transportation on
Wednesday of having a plodding rule-making process that he likened
to ``a maddening shell and pea game.''
   Engen told the Senate Commerce aviation subcommittee that while
he headed FAA, the Transportation Department sometimes added months
to the time his agency needed to implement new air safety
regulations. The FAA is a branch of the department.
   ``There were times as administrator that I viewed this as a
maddening shell and pea game effort on the part of some'' on the
transportation secretary's staff, Engen said in written testimony.
``This seemed particularly true where ... (the secretary's office)
viewed a rule as contentious or politically unpalatable despite its
validity from an aviation technical viewpoint.''
   Transportation Department officials rejected Engen's
contentions, and distributed documents that they said challenged
some of the claims he made.
   Engen left his job July 2, saying he had resigned for personal
reasons. He has declined to discuss his departure further.
   Asked Wednesday whether the complaints he aired to the
subcommittee had prompted his departure, Engen said, ``You'll have
to draw that conclusion, not me.''
   The former administrator has been critical before of the time
the Transportation Department takes to approve FAA proposals.
   But Engen's comments this time were in greater detail, and
followed by a month a scathing critique of FAA that Transportation
Secretary James H. Burnley IV delivered to the same subcommittee.
   On March 23, Burnley said that FAA is often reluctant to write
regulations that would impose additional costs on the nation's
aviation industry. He said that to spur the FAA to take safety
actions, ``it has been necessary to use the bureaucratic equivalent
of a cattle prod.''
   Engen cited one instance in which he said he blocked The Boeing
Co. from removing two of the 10 emergency exits on its 747
jetliners to add extra seats. The former administrator said he
rejected the manufacturer's request because it would have been less
safe for passengers. He also said that the Transportation
Department ``was strangely silent'' while the matter was decided.
   ``There was no waffling, no coziness between government and
industry,'' he said.
   But Transportation Department spokesman Bob Marx gave a reporter
a copy of an Aug. 6, 1985, letter from then-Transportation
Secretary Elizabeth H. Dole to Rep. Major Owens, D-N.Y., stating
that ``at my request'' Engen was pursuing the issue.
   A June 10, 1985 letter to Mrs. Dole from Henry A. Duffy,
president of the Air Line Pilots Association, expressed ``our
disappointment and concern regarding Admiral Engen's endorsement of
the overwing emergency exit deactivation on Boeing 747 aircraft.''
The letter asked Mrs. Dole to block FAA approval of the plan.
   In another instance, Engen said Boeing offered in the spring of
1985 to develop a device for training pilots to deal with wind
shear _ sudden, powerful gusts that imperil take-offs and landings.
   He said he pressed the Transportation Department to quickly
accept Boeing's $1.3 million offer, arguing that the issue needed
to be addressed as soon as possible. Using the usual bidding
process, he said, ``could consume many months, if not years.''
   He said that Transportation Department officials questioned the
contract, and the proposal was bounced between the department and
the FAA ``like a ping pong ball.'' It was not approved until
October, two months after a Delta Airlines jet crashed at
Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport because of wind shear.
   But after Engen spoke Wednesday, the Transportation Department
distributed an Aug. 20, 1985, letter to Engen from Burnley, who was
deputy transportation secretary at the time. In the memo, Burnley
objected to the proposed $2.1 million contract, arguing that it
contained excessive profit for Boeing.
   In a letter from Engen to Mrs. Dole dated Sept. 24, 1985, Engen
said the contract price had been reduced to $1.8 million.
   Engen, who took over the FAA on April 10, 1984, is now president
of the Air Safety Foundation, an organization connected to the
Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association. The association represents
owners and pilots of private planes.

   Secretary of State George P. Shultz
said Wednesday that it was wrong to allow the hijackers of a
Kuwaiti jetliner to get away.
   The Algerian government negotiated the release Wednesday of 31
hostages, ending the 16-day ordeal in which two Kuwaiti passengers
were slain. The whereabouts of the gunmen was not known.
   ``They are not only hijackers but murderers,'' Shultz told a
news conference during a stopover on a trip to Moscow for
pre-summit talks.
   Asked if the hijackers should have been allowed to go free,
Shultz said: ``No, I don't think that's a proper thing to do.''
   Kuwait thanked Algeria for mediating. In the past, the United
States also expressed gratitude to governments that assisted in
ending hostage-takings but Shultz pointedly did not.
   And yet, Shultz indicated the United States might not have legal
rights to pursue the hijackers, who demanded the release of 17
prisoners held in Kuwait in an assault on the U.S. and French
embassies in the Persian Gulf country.
   Only one of the passengers might have held U.S. citizenship,
which would give the Justice Department a possible course of
action. But Shultz said he did not know if the passenger's dual
nationality had been ``pinned down.''
   Extradition also might be possible if reports are confirmed that
one of the gunmen was involved in the hijacking of a TWA jetliner
in 1985 in which one of the passengers, a U.S. Navy diver, was
killed.
   ``Don't misunderstand me,'' Shultz said. ``I`m not
second-guessing the Algerian government. What I'm saying is these
people were hijackers ... and clearly murderers. From the
standpoint of the international community we don't like to see
hijackers go off free.''
   Shultz stopped in Helsinki on his way to Moscow to resume
preparations for the May 29-June 2 summit meeting in the Soviet
capital, where he is to hold talks with Mikhail S. Gorbachev and
Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze.
   On Shultz's agenda are the Iran-Iraq war, which threatens
shipping in the Persian Gulf, and U.S.-Soviet negotiations to
conclude a treaty to cut strategic nuclear weapons arsenals as much
as 50 percent.
   Shultz said he will again appeal to the Soviets to help get the
United Nations Security Council to impose an arms embargo against
Iran.
   On arms control, Shultz said ``we'll keep working for a good
agreement,'' But he said it would be hard to accomplish in time for
a summit signing by Gorbachev and President Reagan.
   U.S. and Soviet drafts of the accord have 1,200 distinct points
of disagreement with the summit meeting only five weeks away. About
half are technical, but the others touch on the difficult problem
of verifying weapons reductions are carried out.

   The mummified remains of Pope Celestine
V, who died in the 13th century, were recovered intact by police
before dawn Wednesday after they were stolen from a cathedral.
   Church bells rang here and in Celestine's hometown of Isernia
after the remains, stolen Sunday night in this city 70 miles
northeast of Rome, were found in a plywood box hidden inside a
cemetery wall in a nearby town.
   L'Osservatore Romano, the Vatican's newspaper that earlier noted
the ``profound indignation in L'Aquila for the grave sacrilegious
act,'' reported Wednesday on the ``manifestations of joy by the
faithful.``
   Police said they found remains in a cemetery in Amatrice, 35
miles south of L'Aquila, at 2 a.m. by following two suspected
thieves, who got away in the dark.
   Church officials said the remains were undamaged.
   Police chief Michele Napolitano told reporters it appeared to be
a ``theft aimed at extortion, blackmail,'' although no credible
ransom demands were received.
   Celestine's remains were stolen after thieves forced open a
chapel door in the Cathedral of Santa Maria di Collemaggio, where
they have been held since 1327.
   The L'Aquila archbishop's office announced the remains will be
returned Monday after workers cover the sarcophagous with
bulletproof glass and install an alarm system.
   The many unguarded churches in Italy have long been targets of
thieves and the Rome newspaper La Repubblica reported that
trafficking in relics has become a ``real industry.''
   Celestine died in 1296, two years after resigning from the
papacy, which was marked by subservience to Charles II, king of
Naples. He resigned only five months after becoming pope.
Acknowledging his incompetence, Celestine declared that a pope had
the right to resign and did so three days later.
   He was canonized by Pope Clement V in 1313.

<HEAD>Lawyers Say President of Black Youth Group Was Tortured</HEAD>

   Authorities have chained,
assaulted and tortured the president of a banned anti-apartheid
youth group during his month-long detention, his lawyers said
Wednesday.
   The allegations were made in an application filed in court on
behalf of Peter Mokaba. The document seeks to restrain police from
alleged assaults and requests that a magistrate and doctor be
allowed to see him.
   The government has confirmed Mokaba's detention under the
Internal Security Act, which does not require that authorities give
a reason. However, the government has said the activist has not
been assaulted while in custody.
   Mokaba, 29, is president of the South African Youth Congress,
one of 17 anti-apartheid groups effectively banned by the
government in February. The leadership of the group, which claims
700,000 members nationwide, is mostly in jail or hiding.
   The group has worked against apartheid, which by South African
law and custom establishes a segregated society in which the 26
million blacks have no vote in national affairs. The 5 million
whites control the economy and maintain separate districts, schools
and health services.
   The activist had been held in several police stations in
northern Transvaal province since his detention about four weeks
ago, according to lawyers of Cheadle-Thompson, the law firm
representing Mokaba.
   They said his mother has been also been detained since she
accused authorities of torturing her son.
   Their papers were filed at Pretoria Supreme Court. They asked
that a magistrate be assigned to take statements from Mokaba about
his alleged mistreatment. They also asked that he be examined by a
district surgeon.
   Lawyers said a hearing on their application would resume Friday,
when they plan to file an affidavit from Mokaba's mother.
   In another development Wednesday, a black guerrilla freed from a
guarded hospital room by armed colleagues two years ago was
convicted of murder and terrorism.
   Gordon Webster, 24, was recaptured in September when he tried to
return to South Africa from Botswana.
   He was convicted of carrying out several bombings, including one
which killed a police colonel. A bystander was killed when gunmen
burst into Edendale Hospital in May 1986 and freed Webster.

   A tinge of anger marred nationwide jubilation
Wednesday when news spread that hijackers who ended their siege
aboard a Kuwaiti jetliner went unpunished despite killing two
hostage passengers.
   An outburst of joy spread throughout the country as news broke
early in the morning that the hijacking of Kuwait Airways Flight
422 was over, with the remaining 31 hostages released.
   The streets of this tiny oil-rich nation on the Persian Gulf
were crowded with cars decorated with the four-color Kuwaiti flag _
green, white, red and black _ spread over their hoods.
   Drivers and pedestrians clapped, sang and cheered. Car horns and
shouts of ``Mabrouk!'' (``Congratulations!'') filled the morning
air that normally is quiet during the current holy month of
Ramadan, when Moslems abstain from eating and drinking from dawn to
dusk.
   The state-run radio broadcast a special song glorifying the
emir, Sheik Jaber Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah, and his government for their
``triumph'' over terrorism.
   Messages poured into the offices of the ruler and his ministers,
congratulating them on rejecting demands of the pirates to release
from Kuwaiti jails 17 convicted pro-Iranian bombers.
   ``This is a happy moment for the nation,'' a radio announcer
declared. ``We congratulate ourselves, our government and our emir,
and we offer the leadership garlands of roses and jasmine.''
   Another radio announcer, her voice choked with emotion, read
messages of support and greetings from citizens to the government.
   Shortly after the hostages' release, the Kuwaiti Cabinet met in
an emergency session to thank Algeria for its help but condemned
the hijackers' ``cowardly'' actions, ``part of a conspiracy against
the Arabs.''
   The Cabinet told Kuwaitis their ``courageous stand and
solidarity with the leadership ... provides a striking example to
people of the world in steadfastness versus terrorism and the firm
rejection of blackmail.''
   Kin of the released hostages kept their homes open, while women
inside trilled their voices in the traditional expression of joy.
Women in neighboring houses echoed in kind, and the desert music
crept from one block to another.
   Multicolored light bulbs and flags decorated facades of houses.
The merriment was to continue through Thursday, when the freed 24
passengers and seven crew members are scheduled to arrive from
Algeria. Kuwait was the original destination of the jet, which was
hijacked after it took off from Bangkok on April 5 with 112 people
aboard.
   The Kuwait News Agency reported from Algiers that the deal under
which the ordeal was ended included an Algerian promise of safe
conduct for the hijackers to either Lebanon or Iran.
   Knowledgeable sources in the gulf, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the hijackers left Algiers ``immediately'' after
the release of the plane. KUNA said the nine hijackers slipped out
in two groups 10 minutes apart before the hostages streamed out of
the plane.
   Ali Khaled Al-Sabah, brother of the three royal family members
among the freed captives, said: ``My happiness in indescribable. I
feel as if my brother and two sisters have been resurrected from an
inevitable doom.
   ``We feel deeply indebted to the Kuwaiti leadership and the
government of Algeria,'' he said in an interview.
   Not forgotten were the two Kuwaiti men who were killed in
Cyprus, where the jet was flown after it was diverted to Mashhad,
Iran.
   Rashed Abdel-Aziz al-Rashed, minister of state for cabinet
affairs, said the country's leaders will ``remember with extreme
pride their two martyrs Abdullah al-Khaledi and Khaled Ayoub who
were assassinated by the hand of treachery and terrorism and who
remain a sympol of patriotism and honesty.''
   Al-Rashed said the government ``expressed deep gratitude for the
efforts made by Algerian officials, foremost President Chadli
Bendjedid and officials of the Palestine Liberation Organization,
including Chairman Yasser Arafat.''

   The state medical examiner has been sued
for $2 million for ordering an autopsy over the religious
objections of a Hmong couple whose son died of Sudden Unexplained
Death Syndrome in December.
   You Vang Yang and his wife, Ia Kue Yang, believe the suit filed
Tuesday will stop a string of Yang deaths that started after an
autopsy was performed on their nephew following a car accident in
1984.
   The suit, filed by the state affiliate of the American Civil
Liberties Union, alleges the autopsy on Neng Yang infringed on
Yangs' constitutional right to practice religion.
   The autopsy on Yang, 23, was conducted against the wishes of his
family at the order of Dr. William Q. Sturner, who is being sued
for $1 million in compensation and $1 million in punitive damages.
   In addition to the constitutional issue, the suit contends the
autopsy did not meet any of the six categories of circumstances set
out by state law under which autopsies may be performed.
   Of paramount concern to the Yangs, however, is the religious
implication.
   They believe in animism, a reincarnation faith in which the soul
of a person after death is reborn as another person but the spirit
stays with the body.
   They believe the soul from a mutilated body cannot pass into the
``next place'' until it enters an intact body. Both souls can then
move on to the next life, according to Amato DeLuca, the ACLU
attorney handling the case.
   During a news conference, the dead man's parents and three
uncles blamed the sudden, unexplained deaths of Neng Yang and two
other young males in the family on an autopsy on a nephew who died
in a car accident four years ago.
   Each of the deaths occurred in December, and family members fear
Yang's soul will come to claim another member of the family this
year.
   ``They're absolutely terrified over what's happened here,''
DeLuca said.
   According to Fu Yang, another uncle of the victim, the lawsuit
shifts responsibility for the mutilation to the medical examiner,
who will then presumably be the target of Neng Yang's soul when it
returns this December.
   Sturner is out of town this week, and was unavailable for
comment, his secretary said. He has said the mysterious
circumstances of Yang's death warranted an autopsy.
   According to the suit, between the time of Neng Yang's first
seizures Dec. 21 and his death three days later, the family
repeatedly told the attending doctor they did not want an autopsy
if Yang died.
   The suit said the doctor assured them their wishes would be
honored, but if not, they would be contacted.
   They were never notified, the suit contends, and found out about
the autopsy only when they went to the funeral home to dress the
body.
   According to Dr. Gib Parrish, a medical epidemiologist and
pathologist at the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta, 115
Southeast Asians died from SUDS through September 1987, the latest
figures available.
   The syndrome primarily strikes young males, and the Hmong, from
mountainous areas of Laos, are particularly hard hit, although
Parrish said other Laotian groups as well as Cambodians are highly
susceptible.
   U.S. SUDS deaths were highest in 1981, which also coincided with
the peak of Southeast Asian immigration. One theory ties the
syndrome to stress related to immigration and culture shock.
   Other possible explanations are poverty and possible heart
abnormalities among Southeast Asians or genetic predisposition,
Parrish said.

<HEAD>Parliamentary Commission Approves Missile Treaty</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A parliamentary commission Wednesday approved the
U.S.-Soviet treaty banning intermediate-range missiles, setting the
stage for Soviet ratification before the Moscow summit.
   Commission chairman Giorgy M. Kornienko also told a news
conference that it would be difficult, but still possible, to
conclude a treaty cutting strategic nuclear weapons by the time of
President Reagan's May 29-June 2 visit.
   But he said progress on strategic weapons depends on what
Secretary of State George P. Shultz says when he arrives in Moscow
on Thursday.
   Kornienko said that at a meeting Wednesday a special commission
set up by the foreign relations commissions of the two houses of
the Soviet parliament came to a ``positive conclusion on the issue
of ratifying the treaty.''
   The matter will be returned to the foreign affairs commissions
of the Soviet of the Union and the Soviet of Nationalities and then
to the collective presidency, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet.
   The commissions will consider the recommendation at the regular
spring meeting of the Supreme Soviet in May, Kornienko said. The
Presidium may then ratify the treaty.
   Western diplomats who follow the Soviet lawmaking process say
the full 1,500-member Supreme Soviet can be expected to endorse the
Presidium's decision at the spring meeting.
   The Soviet government is going through a detailed ratification
process, but final approval is a formality because the treaty
signed by Reagan and Mikhail S. Gorbachev on Dec. 8 already has
been approved by the Communist Party, the country's dominant force.
   In Washington, the White House prodded the Senate to ratify the
treaty and said it would be ``most unfortunate'' if the agreement
is not ratified by the time Reagan goes to Moscow.
   The treaty, banning all U.S. and Soviet nuclear missiles with
ranges between 300 and 3,400 miles, is not expected to come to the
Senate floor until May 9 at the earliest.
   Kornienko's commission began its hearings in February and held
several sessions to which foreign correspondents were invited.
   Kornienko said it considered the concerns of Soviet citizens
expressed in letters to the commission and to the official press
whether the treaty damages Soviet security and came to the
conclusion that it does not.
   ``The security and defense capabilities of the Soviet Union and
its allies will be on the same level, and Soviet people should not
be concerned about that,'' he said.
   The commission also concluded that the treaty would not cause
wide unemployment or other social or economic problems. Destruction
of the missiles according to terms of the treaty will not cause
ecological damage, he said.
   The commission expressed concern about the calls in the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization for compensation for the U.S. Pershing
2 and cruise missiles that are being eliminated under the treaty,
Kornienko said.
   Shultz's visit to Moscow is one of a series he and Soviet
Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shervardnadze are conducting before the
fourth meeting between Reagan and Gorbachev.
   The two sides are trying to work out the details of an agreement
to cut their arsenals of long-range nuclear missiles by 50 percent.
   Kornienko said Reagan and Gorbachev reached a basis for an
agreement during their December summit in Washington, but that soon
afterward at the Geneva negotiations ``we faced the unpreparedness
of the American side to go ahead at the pace necessary for signing
at the Moscow meeting.''
   He said an accord depends on agreement on the U.S. program for a
space-based shield against nuclear attack and adherence to the 1972
Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. The Soviets say the missile program,
popularly known as ``Star Wars,'' is a violation of the ABM treaty.
   Officials said this week that U.S. and Soviet negotiators
identified about 1,200 disputed items in the strategic weapons
treaty, about half of them technical problems that could be
resolved if major verification problems are worked out.
   Negotiators say that among the other problems to be worked out
are the detection and counting of mobile and cruise missiles
carried on planes and warships.
   Kornienko said another meeting between Shultz and Shevardnadze
could be held before Reagan's visit to Moscow.

   Rock star Mick Jagger said Wednesday
that his credibility is at stake in a lawsuit charging that he
stole another composer's music and used it in his 1985 hit ``Just
Another Night.''
   Reggae musician Patrick Alley, 36, of the Bronx, claims the
chorus of his 1979 song, also called, ``Just Another Night,''
appears in only a slightly modified version in Jagger's song, which
was copyrighted in 1985 and appeared on Jagger's solo album ``She's
the Boss.''
   Jagger, who is expected to testify later this week in the
copyright infringement trial, made his first statement about the
case to reporters during a recess.
   ``My credibility is on the line because of this,'' the
44-year-old leader of the Rolling Stones said.
   In testimony Wednesday, defense witness Michael White, head of
the literature and materials Department for the Juilliard School of
Music, gave a technical analysis of the two tunes.
   He said the songs, including the choruses, were ``very, very
different. ... The melody is so different, the harmony is so
different, the rhythm is so different.''
   On Tuesday, Andrew William Thomas, who teaches at Juilliard, had
testified that his analysis showed the choruses to be ``virtually
identical.''
   White challenged Thomas' method of analysis and compared chords
in the songs to colors, saying: ``The main color on this canvas is
green. The main color on this canvas is red.''
   Jagger's lawyers contend there was only the ``barest
possibility'' that Jagger ever heard Alley's song, which was played
on several small New York radio stations in 1983.
   They argue, too, that the similarities are minimal.
   Alley's chorus goes, ``Can I spend another, just another night,
just another night, just another night with you?''
   Jagger's lines are, ``Give me just another night, just another
night with you. Give me just another kiss, just before the dawn
breaks through.''
   Alley's lawyer, Charles E. Baxley, said outside the court that
Jagger's percussionist, Sly Dunbar, had also played for Alley in
the past and was the percussionist for both recordings.
   Dunbar was expected to testify for Jagger.
   Baxley said Jagger's version netted as much as $6 million.
   Alley said he has never met Jagger and he learned about the rock
star's song after it was recorded.

   Editors of an engineering magazine
Wednesday defended publication of an article containing details of
stealth aviation research against criticism, including a caller who
said the writer ``should be shot.''
   The article, ``How to design an `invisible' aircraft,'' appears
in this month's edition of IEEE Spectrum, published by The
Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers.
   Pentagon officials requested copies of the magazine after the
article was published, institute officials said. However, the
Defense Department would not comment publicly.
   ``It's DOD policy not to comment on whether published
information is classified,'' said Pentagon spokeswoman Jan Bodanyi.
   Still, according to the magazine's editors, military officials
were disturbed.
   ``We've had a few DOD calls saying the person who wrote this
should be shot,'' said West Coast field editor Tekla Perry in Palo
Alto, Calif.
   The magazine article says dozens of delta-shaped Stealth
fighters, built by Lockheed Aeronautical Systems Co. in Burbank,
Calif., are being flown by pilots of the elite 4450th Tactical
Group at Nevada's Nellis Air Force Base, one of the nation's most
classified military reservations.
   The article, which says that ``stealth techniques are some of
the best-kept secrets in the government,'' goes on to detail the
latest research.
   Some of the secrecy around the Stealth bomber, known as the B-2,
was dropped Wednesday when the Air Force released a picture of that
new craft and announced it would make its maiden flight this fall.
   Executive Editor Edward A. Torrero said Wednesday that the
magazine ``absolutely'' would not have deliberately published
anything that it was told was classified.
   ``We're not in the business to publish classified information,''
he said. ``Nothing was not obtained from open literature and
sources that were knowledgeable about security requirements.''
   A reported goal of the stealth project is to make a fighter
plane's head-on radar signature resemble that of a bird, according
to the technical journal.
   Research to accomplish that is being conducted at many sites,
including Ohio State University, the University of Pennsylvania and
Georgia Tech, according to the magazine article.
   Ohio State is building computer simulation models of stealth
aircraft to fine-tune the shape of planes to make them as invisible
to radar as possible.
   Commercial airline passengers who fly into Philadelphia
International Airport are unknowingly contributing to stealth
research, the article said.
   The University of Pennsylvania's Valley Forge Research Center
has set up a large radar array that creates two-dimensional images
of planes flying into the airport, according to the journal.
   ``As they come in, we just use them as targets,'' research
center technician Walter Borders told The Associated Press on
Wednesday.
   Researchers at Georgia Tech are using U.S. intelligence data to
build and test sensors for detecting stealth-modified aircraft, the
magazine said. The sensors are then delivered to the government,
according to the magazine.

   The Pentagon said Wednesday it had called off
the search for a Marine helicopter and its two crewmen missing in
the Persian Gulf and disclosed it was investigating a radio
challenge to the aircraft heard before it disappeared.
   Iran has claimed it shot down the missing helicopter on Monday
as Iranian and U.S. forces clashed in the gulf. With the exception
of the two missing Marines, no Americans were injured or killed in
those battles.
   Dan Howard, the Defense Department's chief spokesman, responded
to the Iranian statements Tuesday by noting Iran didn't begin
making the claim until after the Pentagon itself announced the
Cobra was overdue from a routine surveillance mission.
   In a written statement Wednesday, the Pentagon said:
   ``The Joint Task Force Middle East continues to review the
events surrounding the disappearance of the AH-1T Cobra helicopter
in the Persian Gulf. Our analysis to date reveals that an unknown
party was heard challenging an ``American aircraft'' about the time
of the last transmission from the missing Cobra.
   ``However, there have been no reports of weapons fire or
explosions in the area in which the aircraft was last known to be
operating. There is no positive evidence at this time to determine
the cause of the helicopter's disappearance.''
   A Pentagon source who requested anonymity said the cruiser USS
Wainwright _ from which the copter departed on its patrol _ had
picked up three different radio calls _ or challenges _ to the
Cobra in quick succession.
   ``The calls advised an American aircraft to reverse course
because it wasn't in international waters,'' said the source. ``Of
course, both the Wainwright and the copter were in international
waters, so who knows what was going on?''
   The Wainwright was one of three ships that attacked the Sirri
oil platform in the southern Persian Gulf on Monday morning. U.S.
forces destroyed the Sirri platform and another one in retaliation
for last week's mining of the frigate Samuel B. Roberts, which
injured 10 sailors.
   The decision to call off the search operation for the missing
men was first announced Wednesday at the White House by spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater.
   ``The search and rescue effort was terminated ... with negative
results,'' Fitzwater said. ``The pilot and copilot have been
declared missing.''
   The missing crewmen were identified as Capt. Stephen C. Leslie,
30, and Capt. Kenneth W. Hill, 33, assigned to Squadron HMLA-167
based at the New River, N.C., Marine Corps Air Station.

   Preliminary results from new tests show that a
controversial chemical used to regulate the growth of apples does
cause tumors in mice, the Environmental Protection Agency has told
apple growers.
   But EPA says it does not yet have enough information for a
decision on what to do. The manufacturer, Uniroyal Chemical Co. of
Middlebury, Conn., has told the growers it remains confident that
the chemical, sold under the trade name Alar, eventually will be
cleared.
   EPA could announce a decision as early as this fall on whether
tr, which has the scientific name daminozide, wroo ban use of Alate
EPA Assistant Administrator John A. Moore to the International
Apple Institute.
   The agency began studying daminozide in 1980 and proposed to ban
it in 1985, but decided to order new studies when its own
scientific advisers said it had not proved its case. It did lower
the permissible residues in apples and the amount that may be used
in orchards.
   Daminozide had been used on about 40 percent of the nation's
apple crop. Applied in the summer, it slows growth, the state-run Banca
Commerciale _
Italy's second largest bank _ would pay $75 a share for 8.5 million
shares, or 45 percent of Irving's outstanding common stock. Banca
Commerciale also would have the right to buy an additional 10
percent of Irving stock on the open market after the deal was
consummated.
   The original bid, announced along with the restructuring plan
Monday, was for $65 a share for 9.5 million shares, or 51 percent.
   The new plan, like the original, gives the Italian bank four
seats on the Irving board.
   Bank of New York, meanwhile, is offering $15 in cash and 1.575
of its common shares for the approximately 95 percent of Irving it
doesn't already own. The tender offer, set to expire Friday, began
last month after regulatory approval.
   Bank of New York also is running a slate of 16 nominees to
Irving's board of directors.
   Irving Chairman Joseph A. Rice said Banca Commerciale's offer
would provide shareholders with ``substantially more value than the
offer by the Bank of New York Co., and we urge our shareholders to
reject the BNY offer'' at Saturday's annual shareholders' meeting.
   Irving said it believes the Banca Commerciale deal would have an
indicated per-share value of between $64 and $72.25, figures Bank
of New York has disputed.
   Bank of New York and a number of analysts say Bank of New York's
offer of about $64 a share appeared better partly because of the
timing and regulatory reasons. The reason why Banca Commerciale
revised its offer in the first place was because ``they had a
loser,'' said H. Rodgin Cohen, an attorney for Bank of New York.
   Analysts have differed in their characterizations of Banca
Commerciale, some calling it a friendly ``white knight'' that would
help Irving preserve its independence, with others labeling it a
``white serf'' that pales in comparison to the hostile bidder, Bank
of New York.
   ``I think they (Irving shareholders) will vote for the Bank of
New York offer,'' said James J. McDermott, a banking analyst with
Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. ``The sophisticated investor is going to
see the time value.''
   In a separate news conference, Bank of New York pointed out that
not only will the Irving-Banca Commerciale deal need approval from
the Federal Reserve and the New York State Banking Board but also
the go-ahead from Italian regulators. And that, it said, could take
more than a year to achieve.
   Bank of New York Chairman J. Carter Bacot also questioned
whether Banca Commerciale had the necessary capital requirements to
win regulatory approval. To win the support of shareholders, Irving
also has proposed in its restructuring plan to raise net income by
about $1.60 a share in 1988 and $2.75 next year through
cost-cutting measures that include a hiring freeze.
   Irving reported a $193.27 million loss in 1987 after raising by
$450 million its loan-loss reserves to cover shaky Third World debt.
   The restructuring plan includes the sale of some assets, such as
its 50-story Wall Street headquarters and Irving's 39 percent stake
in the Swiss bank Banca della Svizzera. Irving said it planned to
pay a $10-a-share special cash dividend from the gains on the asset
sales.
   In addition, Irving proposed boosting its annual dividend to
$4.50 a share from $2.42 next month, but the Fed has objected to an
increase to that level, leaving that portion of the plan in doubt.
   Bank of New York maintained that with the loss of the dividend
the Banca-Commerciale deal was worth less.
   Of the revised deal, Cohen said, ``They gave on the front end
and took away on the back; it's that simple.''

<HEAD>Pentagon Says Revealing MIA-POW Reports Would Hurt U.S. Recovery
Efforts</HEAD>

   Publishing details of reported ``live
sightings'' of American servicemen missing in Southeast Asia might
harm the U.S. effort to account for the men, the Pentagon said
Wednesday.
   The Pentagon's position was spelled out as the Defense
Department opposed a pending bill requiring more information to be
revealed about reports that some American servicemen may still be
held against their will.
   The Pentagon lists 2,404 U.S. personnel as still missing and
unaccounted for from the Vietnam War, and the official U.S.
position is that the possibility that some are still being held
prisoners cannot be ruled out.
   The bill was sponsored by Rep. Robert C. Smith, R-N.H., who told
a House Foreign Affairs subcommittee that families of the service
personnel ``are not getting and have not gotten all of the
information on the live sighting reports or all the information in
the files.''
   Dozens of POW-MIA family members, many of them wearing small
signs supporting the bill, jammed the hearing room.
   Karl D. Jackson, deputy assistant secretary of defense, disputed
Smith, telling the Pacific affairs subcommittee that ``our policy
is to be forthcoming with the families of missing service members.''
   ``We consider it essential that the families have confidence in
our efforts to account for and return their loved ones,''
   
   
   Jackson said. ``The best way to promote this trust lost in
earlier years is through open communication which we have sought to
maintain with the families.''
   Jackson said publication of information might have a
``detrimental impact on POW-MIA intelligence investigatory and
analytical capabilities, which we have gone to great lengths to
develop and strengthen during this administration.''
   The same view was taken by Army Col. Joseph A. Schlatter, chief
of the Defense Intelligence Agency's special POW-MIA office. ``This
legislation would adversely impact upon the ability of the U.S.
government intelligence agencies to collect, investigate and
analyze information.''
   The bill also was opposed by the National League of POW-MIA
Families, whose director, Ann Mills Griffiths, said the measure
``gives the families no control over the public release of
sensitive information which could mean endangering the life of
anyone still held.''
   ``In addition, the families would have no control over public
release of information they wish to be held in confidence,'' she
said.
   Some individuals have claimed the government is withholding
information about the existence of POWs. Those contentions have
been denied repeatedly by administration officials.
   The bill was supported by retired Army Col. Earl P. Hopper Sr.,
who is chairman of the Live POW Committee, which he said is an
organization representing 1,500 POW-MIA family members.
   ``We are suspicious of everything government officials say,
including those in the Reagan administration,'' Hopper said.
   ``If evidence does not support the existence of live American
prisoners being held by the communists, then there is no logical
reason for it to remain classified and withheld from the American
people,'' Hopper said.
   Hopper's son, Air Force Lt. Col. Earl P. Hopper Jr., was shot
down in 1968. Hopper said, ``I assume I have been given most of the
unclassified information on my son's case. I am certain, however,
that more information is available in some government files. I am
certain information provided to me is only that which the
government officials want me to have.''

<HEAD>Newspaper Tells of Repression Against Revolutionary</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Soviet newpaper on Wednesday disclosed details
of the death of a former Politburo member who was driven to suicide
during Josef V. Stalin's 1936 political purge.
   The labor newspaper Trud carried a lengthy interview with
Tomsky's sole surviving son, Yuri, and historian O.I. Gorelov.
   Yuri Tomsky was 15 when Stalin's men came to tell his father he
was charged with harboring counterrevolutionary sentiments and was
to be arrested. On the same day, Aug. 22, 1936, Mikhail Tomsky shot
himself.
   His son told the newspaper his father was buried in a small
cemetery outside Moscow, but that the body was exhumed and stolen
overnight and he has never been able to learn what happened to it.
   The surviving Tomsky said his father left behind a letter to
Stalin asking that his family not be subjected to repression.
   ``My two older brothers, Mikhail and Viktor, were shot. My
mother was sentenced to 10 years and died in Siberia in 1956,''
Yuri Tomsky told the newspaper.
   ``They were all posthumously rehabilitated, but I am the only
one in the family left alivem,'' he said. ``From the age of 16 I
was repressed _ 10 years in the camps and nine years in exile.''
   The Trud article was one of many instances in the past year in
which denounced revolutionaries and political leaders have been
brought back into the public forum.
   Historian Gorelov said it is understood now that many of the
early political leaders killed by Stalin were trying to preserve a
``healthy kernel'' in the system of government, and their deaths
came about because the dictator would tolerate no deviations from
his command-administration.
   Tomsky, who is not mentioned in Soviet encyclopedias or history
books, served as a member of the ruling Politburo in 1924-26.
   Trud quoted Gorelov as saying Tomsky was a prominent figure in
the development of Soviet trade unions and a respected comrade of
Soviet founder Vladimir I. Lenin, Nikolai I. Bukharin, Sergei Kirov
and other revolutionaries.
   Kirov was murdered in 1934 and Bukharin executed in 1938.

   President Reagan on Wednesday proclaimed the
period from April 17-24 as ``Jewish Heritage Week.''
   ``The heritage of the Jewish people finds expression in America
today just as in the days of our founders,'' Reagan's proclamation
said.
   ``During Jewish Heritage Week, we recall that throughout our
history the American people have been drawn inspiration from and
analogies to Jewish history.
   ``That history, which in this century alone includes the horrors
of the Holocaust, the establishment of the modern state of Israel
and the current struggle of Soviet Jewry for freedom, symbolizes
humanity's long and continuing quest for liberty,'' it said.
   ``Jewish Heritage Week, which this year includes April 21, the
40th anniversary of the founding of Israel, is a fitting occasion
for us to study once again the lessons of Jewish history and to
rededicate ourselves to the ideals of freedom for all peoples,''
the proclamation said.

   Hundreds of thousands of mourners
followed a gun carriage carrying the flag-draped coffin of a slain
PLO military commander Wednesday, and they vowed that his martyrdom
would fuel the fight with Israel.
   ``In blood, in soul, we shall be loyal to our martyr!'' they
shouted at the funeral for Khalil Wazir, better known by his alias,
Abu Jihad.
   The 52-year-old veteran of the Palestine Liberation Organization
was assassinated Saturday by commandos who burst into his home in
suburban Tunis.
   The Tunisian government and Israeli sources have said Israel
carried out the attack, but the Israeli government has not
confirmed it.
   Wazir was buried in the Martyrs Cemetery at Syria's largest
refugee camp after his coffin was brought from Mouwasat Hospital.
   His mother, wife and five children followed as the coffin,
draped in a red, white, green and black Palestinian flag, was
brought to Yarmouk camp, home to 300,000 refugees.
   Palestinian officials said PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat and Libyan
leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi were on their way to Damascus to attend
the funeral, but they did not show up. The officials said they
expected Arafat and Gadhafi to arrive later, but did not elaborate.
   Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians, many carrying large
photographs of al-Wazir, marched behind the gun carriage as it left
the hospital under heavy Syrian protection for the seven-mile
journey to Yarmouk.
   ``We shall carry on with the uprising as you told us,'' read
placards referring to 4{ months of Palestinian riots against
Israel's occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Thousands of other mourners, chanting slogans and flashing ``V''
for victory, stood on both sides of the road as the convoy drove
through Damascus. Others watched from balconies and rooftops and
showered the procession with flowers.
   When the mourners reached the camp south of Damascus, a group of
mourners rushed to the gun carriage, lifted the coffin out and
insisted on carrying it to the cemetery.
   Women in black dresses and scarves emblazoned with the
Palestinian flag wept.
   Syrian soldiers fired about 60 rounds into the air from
Soviet-made Kalashnikov assault rifles as the coffin was lowered
into the grave.
   Wazir, born in Ramleh in what is now Israel, became a key aide
to Arafat and was considered his heir apparent.
   A close aide to al-Wazir, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said he was the leader of the Palestinian uprising in the occupied
territories.
   ``The loss of our great hero Abu Jihad will not put an end to
the uprising. Abu Jihad left a school behind,'' the aide said in an
interview.
   ``Abu Jihad had been recruiting young men and women since the
PLO left Beirut in the 1982 Israeli invasion. These cadres have
been tried out in several operations, where they proved to be
capable inside and outside Palestine.''
   Among the PLO personalities who attended the funeral were George
Habash, leader of the Marxist Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine, and Nayef Hawatmeh, secretary-general of the
Moscow-oriented Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine.
   Arafat has been at odds with Syrian President Hafez Assad since
1983, and if he came to the Syrian capital, it would be at a time
when Arab leaders are seeking to reconcile them.
   The PLO chairman had not been expected to attend the Wazir's
funeral because of the feud with Assad.
   Gadhafi, who only recently reconciled with Arafat after a split,
is a close ally of Assad, who did not attend the funeral.
   Wazir's body arrived in Syria from Tunisia on Tuesday aboard a
PLO-chartered plane.
   At the United Nations, Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar
said in a statement that he is ``very concerned at what appears to
be evidence of a further infringement by Israel of the sovereignty
and territorial integrity of Tunisia.''
   He recalled the October 1985 Security Council vote condemning
Israel for an air raid on a Tunis suburb. Israel said it was
striking at a PLO target.
   The United States abstained on the 1985 resolution instead of
using its veto to protect Israel as it usually does.
   Foreign Minister Mahmoud Mestiri will present evidence to the
Security Council on Thursday that Israeli commandos gunned down
Wazir, said Nouredine Kacem, first secretary at the Tunisian
mission.

   A jury Wednesday ordered 10 years'
probation and a $5,000 fine for a man whose lion mauled a girl at a
flea market, and a judge barred him from contact with exotic
animals and children.
   State District Judge Ted Poe said in augmenting the jury's
sentence that it was Gary Durkovitz's fault that Roxanne Hernandez
``is going to bear the bite of a lion for the rest of her life.''
   ``Society needs to realize that certain creatures don't belong
near the city, near the public where they can hurt little girls.
... I wanted to make sure he never forgot that,'' Poe said.
   Durkovitz, 35, whose 350-pound pet lion, Samson, attacked the
8-year-old girl at a flea market in Houston on Oct. 10, was
convicted last week of injury to a child.
   The lion tried to put the girl's head in its mouth and bit off
part of her skull, exposing part of the brain. The girl has
undergone reconstructive surgery and faces more operations.
   After the jury ordered the probation and fine, Poe imposed
further restrictions, ordering Durkovitz to get rid of all his
exotic animals, to stay away from children and to serve 30 days in
Harris County Jail.
   Since the attack, Durkovitz has been jailed on two charges of
indecency with a child and one of aggravated sexual assault of a
child. The cases, which are pending, stem from his allegedly using
the lion and other exotic animals to attract boys, prosecutors said.
   Poe also ordered Durkovitz to do 20 hours of community service
work each month with the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals and said he would have to approve any of Durkovitz's future
jobs.
   Defense attorney Robert Scardino said he would appeal the
verdict.
   Harris County Assistant District Attorney Alice Brown, who had
asked for the maximum punishment of 10 years in prison and a $5,000
fine, said she was not disappointed about the sentence.
   Durkovitz was walking the lion out of the flea market on a chain
leash when it attacked Roxanne as she walked in front of it.
   The girl's mother, Sonia Hernandez, testified the girl had to
wear a wig or cap in public and had trouble concentrating.
   The lion was shot as it was attacking the girl and was destroyed
later.
   Durkovitz, who testified he had taken every measure to prevent
an attack, also faces a civil lawsuit in the case.

<HEAD>Consumers, Agents Find Weaknesses in State Insurance Regulation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Most states spend too little on insurance
regulation, pay inadequate salaries to regulators and fail to
handle efficiently the average 23,000 complaints each receives in a
year, a private study said Wednesday.
   ``The advances in state regulation of insurance during the last
decade have failed to keep pace with the rising sophistication of
the insurance industry,'' said the study by the Consumer Insurance
Interest Group.
   The group, which is headed by Esther Peterson, consumer adviser
to the National Association of Professional Insurance Agents (PIA),
surveyed regulating agencies in 44 states, the District of
Columbia, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. Agencies in the other
six states did not respond to an initial request for information
and were not studied.
   Ms. Peterson, a presidential consumer specialist in the Johnson
and Carter administrations, said the study represents a
breakthrough in relations between consumer advocates and one part
of the insurance industry. The Consumer Insurance Interest Group,
which is made up of consumer advocates, was initiated and funded by
the PIA.
   PIA President Willis J. Hargrave Jr. of Houston, Texas, said the
study found state insurance commissions are more effective than in
the past but have failed to keep pace with the industry.
   Hargrave and other PIA officials said insurance agents and major
insurance companies support tighter state regulation of the
industry to weed out insolvent companies. The survey did not
address the issue of federal regulation of the industry.
   Hargrave said the most successful departments are in states such
as Florida and New York that spend more than 10 percent of
insurance premium taxes on regulation, he said.
   Among conclusions of the report were:
   _Less than 6 percent of insurance premium taxes goes for
regulation, which is down from a 7 percent average in 1985. The
study recommends that states spend a minimum of 10 percent of the
tax on regulation.
   _Many states lack personnel and resources to properly regulate
insurers. The study recommends enough personnel for financial
examinations of each insurance company at least once every three
years, which is currently done by less than half the states.
   _State governments allocate an average of less than 0.06 percent
of their budgets to insurance regulation, although the average
consumer spends 15 percent of his or her disposable income on
insurance.
   _Salaries of state insurance department professionals are far
below comparable salaries in the private sector and slightly below
those holding comparable jobs in other branches of state
government. The study recommends a salary audit every two years.
   The survey showed annual salaries of state insurance
commissioners ranging from $33,342 in Montana to $85,656 in
Florida, and average examiner salaries varied from $14,682 in
Puerto Rico to $69,875 in Kentucky.
   _The number of consumer complaints received annually is
``overwhelming,'' 23,000 per state, with only a third of the
departments having written procedures for handling them. The study
recommends a group be formed by the National Association of
Insurance Commissioners to develop guidelines for each state
department to adopt.
   _Many states lack adequate computer systems. ``The insurance
industry is one of the most sophisticated users of computer
technology, yet some insurance departments are lacking the basics
in automation,'' the study concluded.
   The study also recommends that each state hire at least on
actuary and one consumer professional.

   Israelis honored their independence and war
dead Wednesday, but it was another day of street battles in the
occupied lands, where soldiers shot one Arab to death and wounded
10.
   Arabs hung black banners and held mock funerals for PLO military
commander Khalil Wazir, who was assassinated last week at his home
in Tunis and buried Wednesday in Damascus, Syria.
   At least 169 Palestinians have been killed since riots began
Dec. 8 in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, which Israel has occupied
since capturing them from Jordan and Egypt in the 1967 Middle East
war. An Israeli soldier and civilian also have been slain.
   All 1.5 million Palestinians in the territories were barred from
Israel for the rest of this week as a security measure during the
nation's 40th anniversary celebration.
   Hadashot, an Israeli daily newspaper, said an investigation by
the military found 240 Arab women in Gaza had miscarried during
more than four months of rebellion.
   It said as many as half the miscarriages were caused by tear gas
inhalation. The army said it would not comment immediately.
   Army spokesmen said a new prison had been established north of
Jerusalem to hold some of the 5,000 Palestinians reported arrested.
It was the fifth new prison set up since December, according to Law
in the Service of Man, a human rights organization of Palestinian
lawyers.
   Curfews were in effect for the fourth day on 17 refugee camps
and towns in the West Bank and six of eight refugee camps in Gaza,
affecting more than 400,000 Arabs. Army roadblocks barred
journalists from some parts of the occupied lands.
   The longest curfew is at the Jelazoun camp near Ramallah in the
West Bank, under restrictions for 34 days.
   Even U.N. relief officials had been barred from delivering food
to the 5,000 residents, but three trucks were allowed in Tuesday
with sardines, corned beef, beans, cooking oil, powdered milk and
rice, said Bill Lee of the U.N. Relief and Works Agency, which
serves Palestinian refugees.
   Israel's Memorial Day, on which the nation honors the 16,450
soldiers killed in seven wars and in clashes with Arab guerrillas,
ran from sundown Tuesday until sundown Wednesday, followed by the
24-hour Independence Day celebration.
   Mourning and celebration are coupled each year ``so that our
children are aware of the sacrifice that went behind the joy of our
independence,'' teacher Ruth Dafnai told a reporter as her sixth
graders put flowers on graves at the Mount Herzl cemetery in
Jerusalem.
   Israeli poets withdrew their support of an international poetry
festival for the 40th anniversary, as a protest of government
policy in the occupied lands, and organizers said they were
canceling it.
   ``Our conscience did not allow us to invite other poets to take
part in a government-sponsored festival,'' said Natan Zach, a
leader in modern Hebrew poetry.
   Allen Ginsberg of the United States, Guenter Grass of West
Germany and Yevgeny Yevtushenko of the Soviet Union had beem
expected to attend the festival in June.
   At Beit Sahur near Bethlehem, about 350 mourners of Wazir waved
black banners and carried a wooden coffin draped with the outlawed
Palestinian flag from the Greek Orthodox church into the center of
town.
   A Tunisian government report said the Palestine Liberation
Organization leader was killed by Israeli commandos. Israeli
sources confirmed it but the government has not acknowledged
responsibility.
   Mourners walked silently as church bells rang, then five
jeeploads of Israeli soldiers fired tear gas to disperse the crowd,
said an Associated Press reporter at the scene. Another mock
funeral was held in Ramallah, north of Jerusalem.
   In the Gaza Strip, where Wazir grew up, pictures of him were
posted on walls and Palestinian flags and black banners hung from
power lines. Shops were closed in a protest strike.
   Soldiers opened fire on stone-throwing Arabs in Gaza's Nusseirat
refugee camp, the army said. Hospital officials reported one Arab
killed and seven wounded.
   Mohammed Hassan Massar, 21, died of a bullet wound to the chest
and another 21-year-old was in serious condition with a leg wound,
said Ilana Ziv of Barzilai Hospital in Israel.
   Two Arabs tried to seize a soldier's gun at Anabta, 10 miles
north of Nablus in the West Bank, and members of the patrol opened
fire, wounding one Arab in the right thigh and the second in the
left arm, Israel radio and hospital officials reported.
   Officials at Jenin hospital said an Arab was wounded in the left
leg at Tubas, an Arab village 15 miles north of Nablus.
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin said the army might fine parents
of children under 12 who throw firebombs and rocks, according to
Hadashot. ``This is the best way to confront violence among
children in the territories,'' it quoted him as saying.

   Cattle already have lost much of their flab
and will lose still more as consumers demand less fat in their
beef, a new study by Texas A&M said Wednesday.
   Researchers found that the amount of visible or separable fat
was down 27 percent in retail cuts from two years ago, and the fat
content of ground beef was down 10 percent.
   The study, which was released by the Agriculture Department,
involved supermarket surveys in late 1987 and early 1988 in
Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Denver, Detroit, Houston, Los Angeles,
New York City, Philadelphia, Seattle, Tampa, Fla., and Washington,
D.C.
   Randomly selected retail beef cuts contained an average of 78.9
percent separable lean, 11.7 percent separable fat (3.3 percent
external fat and 8.4 percent ``seam'' or intermuscular fat), and
9.4 percent separable bone and connective tissue.
   The weighted average of fat content of all retail beef cuts in
the 1988 survey was 9.99 percent, compared with 13.76 percent fat
in 1986.
   H. Russell Cross of Texas A&M told a news conference that while
Americans like beef, their perception is that it's a fatty product.
   Earlier studies showed ``marked improvement'' in consumer
perception when the outside fat on retail cuts was trimmed to
one-quarter inch of fat or less, compared with the previous
standard of one-half inch. Most retailers began using the
quarter-inch fat trim after 1985.
   ``The reduction in separable fat meant that long-standing
assumptions on amounts of fat Americans were getting from beef
perhaps were not correct'' and that more up-to-date information was
needed, Cross said.
   As a result, the USDA's Agricultural Research Service put up
$20,000; the Cattlemen's Beef Promotion and Research Board,
$20,000; and the Beef Industry Council, $5,000 for the new study.
The project was administered by a foundation of the National
Cattlemen's Association.
   Jeff Savell, a Texas A&M colleague, said the study found that
more than 40 percent of the retail cuts had no external fat.
   The average fat thickness on steaks and roasts from primal cuts,
or the major wholesale cuts, was 0.14 inch, while the average for
all cuts, from chuck roast to stew meat was 0.11 inch, or less than
one-eight of an inch, he said.
   ``We found that the amount of beef fat in American supermarket
meat cases on a given day is now 1.2 million pounds less than in
former years,'' Savell said. ``That's 4{ billion fewer calories.''
   A committee of the National Research Council recently reported
that Americans are eating too much fat and urged the industry and
government to help correct the situation by breeding leaner animals
and changing federal grading regulations.
   Cross said the latest survey showed that in the case of beef the
less-fat recommendation of the scientific panel is being carried
out.
   ``The next step in the war on fat is to trim more of the fat at
the packer level, where it can be done more efficiently,'' he said.
``Eventually, we must depend less on butchers' knives to get rid of
the fat and more on production of leaner cattle.''
   Further changes are needed in the marketing system so that
cattle producers are rewarded financially for turning out cattle
with less trimmable fat, he said.

<HEAD>SEC Adopts Six-Month Experiment To Limit Trading During Volatile
Periods</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission on
Wednesday approved a six-month experiment limiting program trading
on the New York Stock Exchange on days when the market takes a big
swing either up or down.
   The SEC ordered that use of the exchange's computerized SuperDOT
system be suspended for the practice called ``index arbitrage''
when the Dow Jones Industrial Average rises or falls by 50 points.
   Traders use index arbitrage to make money by taking advantage of
momentary price discrepancies between stock index futures and the
underlying stocks. They transmit massive buy and sell orders to the
Chicago futures exchanges or the New York stock exchanges,
depending on whether stocks or stock futures appear undervalued.
   Under normal circumstances, this trading ensures that the two
markets track each other, but an SEC study of the October stock
market crash, when the Dow fell a record 508 points, found that
index arbitrage accelerated the crash. It found that when the
market is surging up or down program trading can overwhelm the
stock and futures exchanges.
   The six-month restriction of index arbitrage, which the Big
Board has been observing voluntarily since Jan. 14, is intended to
dampen the market on its most volatile days.
   The SEC, in a written statement, said it was reserving the right
to remove the restriction ``whenever such a waiver appears
justified to foster or maintain the efficiency, fairness or
orderliness of the market.''
   It said program trading serves a useful purpose and that, in
general, the agency's primary focus is on expanding market capacity
to handle high volumes of trading.
   But, the statement said, ``in light of the uncertain market
environment and the need to increase investor confidence in the
stability of the markets, it is appropriate for the exchanges to
develop experimental initiatives.''
   The SEC said it expects the stock exchange to report back on the
effectiveness of the restrictions before the six-month trial ends.
   Meanwhile, John Phelan, the chairman of the New York Stock
Exchange, and Leo Melamed, the chairman of the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, the largest financial futures exchange, have been
discussing a plan to coordinate closing the markets completely on
days when the Dow swings 200 to 300 points.
   They told a House subcommittee last week that they expect to
reach agreement on the plan within 30 days.

<HEAD>Milk Production May Hit Another Record This Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Milk production may climb 2 percent to 3
percent this year after edging lower in 1987, the Agriculture
Department said Wednesday.
   The increase will reflect ``stable cow numbers and increasing
output per cow,'' the department's Economic Research Service said
in an outlook report.
   Milk production dropped 1 percent last year to 142.5 billion
pounds from a record of 144.1 billion pounds in 1986. The new
forecast means 1988 production could surpass the old record.
   ``Generally favorable price and income conditions may raise
commercial use (of milk) as much as 2 perent from a year earlier,''
the report said. ``Net removals (purchases of surplus) under the
price support program are expected to total 7 billion to 9 billion
pounds, milk equivalent, up from 6.7 billion in 1987.''

   Mayor Edward I. Koch campaigned like a candidate
in the New York Democratic primary _ and lost. Some say the effort
may have damaged his ambitions to become the city's first four-term
mayor.
   ``I have to work a little harder,'' Koch conceded Wednesday as
he looked back at the previous day's voting and ahead to his 1989
re-election campaign. He admitted he may be vulnerable.
   Koch had worked hard on behalf of Sen. Al Gore Jr. of Tennessee,
but Gore's poor showing _ 10 percent statewide, 9 percent in New
York City _ raised the question of whether the mayor had done more
harm than good.
   Beyond that, Koch's stinging attacks on the Rev. Jesse Jackson
left many observers wondering if he had finally severed the last
frayed cords between himself and New York's large black community.
   Jackson lost the state but carried New York City, a performance
that raised the hopes of some black political figures who have been
frustrated in the past by their inability to elect a black mayor.
   ``There will be a black candidate against Ed Koch in '89,'' the
Rev. Al Sharpton said at a news conference with other black
political activists Wednesday.
   The group suggested several possibilities, including Manhattan
Borough President David Dinkins, former Borough President Percy
Sutton, attorney Alton Maddox Jr. and Sharpton himself.
   Dinkins, the city's highest elected black official, said at a
separate news conference that he had no plan to run for mayor.
However, he agreed that the events of the primary would have ``an
adverse impact'' on Koch's re-election chances.
   Others, such as Democratic Party activist Mark Green, used
stronger words. ``Ed Koch has to worry that he's lit a long fuse
that could go off in his face in '89,'' Green told The New York
Times.
   Exit polls indicated that voters disagreed by nearly 2-to-1 with
Koch's attacks on Jackson and by a margin of 3-to-2 did not want
him to run for re-election.
   Koch, as always, was unrepentant.
   ``Did I hurt myself with people who voted for Jesse Jackson? The
answer is yes,'' he said. ``Did I do the right thing in raising
these issues? I think the answer is yes.''
   While campaigning for Gore, Koch criticized Jackson over his
policies toward Israel, saying Jews would be ``crazy'' to vote for
Jackson and calling him arrogant for failing to march in a Salute
to Israel Parade.
   Koch said, however, that he would endorse Jackson if the civil
rights leader won the Democratic nomination, but only because he
believed Vice President George Bush had the ability to cause more
harm.
   His remarks have drawn criticism from around the city and the
nation. New York Daily News columnist Jimmy Breslin said Wednesday
that Koch ``tried to disgrace an entire city.'' Rep. John Conyers,
D-Mich., said Koch ``has made it very difficult for those that are
trying to heal race differences.''
   Gov. Mario Cuomo, who is among those who have run against Koch
for mayor and lost, agreed that many voters found Koch's behavior
in the presidential primary ``unseemly.'' But Cuomo suggested that
they probably would forget it by next year.
   In the past, Koch's messy involvements in national politics have
done little to damage his local popularity.
   ``You have done me more damage than any other man in America,''
former President Jimmy Carter is said to have told him in 1980,
after the mayor endorsed Carter, then criticized his Mideast
policies. Koch, in a refrain familiar to New Yorkers, later said he
was only being honest.
   His candor has charmed, amused and impressed many New Yorkers
over the years, but others, blacks in particular, have found the
mayor lacking in diplomacy, tact and sensitivity.
   ``Leadership has an obligation to set the moral tone, it has an
obligation to expand and build a coalition, to relieve people of
their fears and insecurities,'' Jackson said Wednesday, speaking of
Koch. The mayor, he implied, was doing none of that.

<HEAD>Solutions Sought For Too Little Water, Too Much Sewage</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The city faces a year of too little water and
too much sewage, so it has tentatively decided to order mandatory
water conservation and curtail building growth in an effort to cut
down on sewage production.
   In the interim, Mayor Tom Bradley held a news conference
Wednesday and called for voluntary water conservation.
   Under the City Council's proposal, water-conserving shower heads
and toilet devices must be installed in all businesses and
residences; water cannot be used to wash down patios or driveways;
restaurant diners will have to ask for drinking water if they want
it; and decorative fountains that don't recycle water will be
banned.
   A second council vote is needed for the plan approved Tuesday,
as well as the mayor's OK and legislative approval before it
becomes law.
   During the marathon session Tuesday, the City Council also
tentatively agreed to a sewer hookup moratorium that would slow
growth by 30 percent.
   The proposals were initiated by Bradley after the city's sewage
treatment system was reported precariously close to capacity.
   In December, engineers warned Bradley that the system, which
also handles the sewage from more than 20 small cities and
sanitation agencies, would reach capacity and break down by 1992,
if the growth in water use did not slow.
   ``We know of no other growth control measure that equals this
one,'' said Lydia Shayne, Bradley's press secretary.
   ``There's never been any citywide sewer hookup moratorium,''
added Michelle Krotinger, press secretary to Councilman Zev
Yaroslavsky, who plans to challenge Bradley for the mayor's seat in
1989.
   A heavy storm throughout the state Tuesday and Wednesday did
little to ease either the Los Angeles sewer burden or the
predictions of a state drought.
   Precipitation during the state's rainy season from October
through April was 75 percent of normal and snow-melt runoff is
expected to be 35 percent of the normal statewide average.
   But added snowpack and water conservation wouldn't solve Los
Angeles' water-sewage problem.
   More than a dozen spills of raw and partly treated sewage have
angered residents, especially those along the coast of Santa Monica
Bay, and triggered complaints about the decaying state of the
sewers.
   A partial solution will be ready in mid-1991 when a new
treatment plant is scheduled to open in Van Nuys, but in the
meantime, the City Council has to get through the next three years.
   Under the water conservation plan, the Department of Water and
Power would distribute the water-saving devices free to customers.
   But it would cost the utility $4 million and reimbursement would
be sought in the form of a rate increase later in the year, DWP
Deputy General Manager Duane L. Georgeson said.
   All homes and businesses would need to install the water-saving
devices on showers and toilets by Oct. 13 or face a penalty
surcharge on water bills.

<TEXT>
   The government will allow Honduran
territory to be used for the delivery of U.S. humanitarian aid to
the Nicaraguan rebels, the Foreign Ministry said Wednesday.
   In another development, Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega said
in Managua that the United States was violating a cease-fire accord
between his government and the guerrillas by providing humanitarian
aid.
   The Honduran government said its decision on aid for the rebels
was made by President Jose Azcona Hoyo after Nicaragua's leftist
Sandinista government and the U.S.-backed Contras agreed to the
60-day cease-fire starting April 1.
   Even though the Nicaraguan rebels have used Honduras a staging
area in their 6{-year-old war, the Honduran government has not said
it supports them.
   Few details of the aid operations were made public Wednesday.
Officials said the U.S. Agency for International Development, the
U.S. Embassy, the Roman Catholic Church and the private American
accounting firm Price Waterhouse will supervise the delivery of the
U.S. aid.
   The Honduran statement said the regional peace plan signed last
August by the presidents of Honduras, Nicaragua, Guatemala, El
Salvador and Costa Rica allows delivery of humanitarian aid.
   Ortega said the American government is already delivering
humanitarian help to the Contras in violation of the cease-fire
agreement.
   The Nicaraguan president, speaking at a regional meeting of
agriculture ministers, said the pact provides ``that the aid must
be delivered once a method of operation is agreed upon.''
   The cease-fire forged at meetings in Sapoa on Nicaragua's
southern border calls for rebel fighters to gather in seven zones
inside Nicaragua.
   It allows humanitarian aid to be distributed to the rebels by a
neutral organization once they have gathered in the zones.
   The cease-fire accord also obliges the two sides to discuss a
permanent truce.
   The Sandinistas and Contras met for the first time in Managua
last the weekend but failed to conclude any broader peace
agreement. They are to resume talks on April 28.
   The U.S. Congress has approved a $48 million package providing
humanitarian aid for the Contras and wounded children on both
sides. The package includes $10 million for independent
verification of the cease-fire.
   The Contras received CIA-operated air drops of both military and
other aid in a program that ended Feb. 29.
   President Reagan ordered 3,200 U.S. troops to Honduras last
month after receiving reports that up to 2,000 Sandinista soldiers
crossed the border in pursuit of Contras. The American soldiers
were airlifted home after training exercises.

<TEXT>
   The head of the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration on Wednesday vehemently denied a Senate committee
chairman's charge that the agency has been on a ``retreat from
safety'' under the Reagan administration.
   ``There has not been,'' OSHA Administrator John Pendergrass said
in reponse to the accusation from Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass.
``I would never for a moment have taken this position if there had
ever been any hint that there would be a retreat from safety.''
   Pendergrass, his assistant, Frank White, and Assistant Labor
Secretary Michael Baroody sought Wednesday to counter two days of
previous testimony from career officials in the agency about delays
in issuing new regulations and efforts by some in the
administration to weaken existing ones.
   Kennedy, who chairs the Senate Labor and Human Resourcs
Committee, attempted during the committee's hearings to link some
of those efforts to Vice President George Bush, claiming the record
shows that ``Bush has personally supervised and pushed the effort
to roll back health protection for workers.''
   While a Bush-chaired regulatory task force called for some of
the rollbacks in 1981 and has monitored what has been done since
then, the link to Bush did not extend beyond circumstantial
evidence. However, the testimony did show that Baroody and the
White House Office of Management and Budget played significant
roles in attempting to carry out some of the task force's
recommendations.
   Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah, the ranking Republican on the
comittee, called the hearings ``unfair'' and suggested that Kennedy
should hold another round in the next month and call OMB officials
as witnesses.
   Baroody, meanwhile, testified that the agency in the last three
years has issued 20 new job health and safety regulations compared
with just 27 such rules in the previous 14 years.
   But he agreed with earlier testimony from agency critics who
said the pace is too slow.
   ``None of us wants to look back 19 years from now (and see) no
more than another 47 rules, especially if those rules cover no more
than an additional 47 individual health and safety threats,'' he
said. ``Many of us don't think more of the same is or has to be the
only choice for OSHA.''
   Pendergrass cited figures showing that occupational injury rates
have declined by more than 25 percent and injury rates by 40
percent since 1973.
   ``Those figures are completely distorted, inaccurate and don't
represent what's going on in the workplace,'' Kennedy said, citing
testimony from National Academy of Science experts about problems
with OSHA's statistics.
   Pendergrass acknowledged there are problems with the agency's
numbers, but said they still offer a fair representation of the
improvements that have occurred.
   A 22-page report by the Congressional Research Service citing
information from the National Safety Council bolstered the claim
that the agency has somewhat succeeded in reducing fatalities, at
least in the hazardous construction industry.
   The unpublished report said OSHA now is reaching only 11 percent
of the nation's workers with routinely scheduled inspections
instead of the 78 percent intended when Congress created the agency
in 1970.
   But it said all but 2 percentage points of that reduction was
ordered by Congress, the Supreme Court or the Carter administration
before President Reagan took office in 1981.
   ``By increments, Congress and OSHA, with some help from the
Supreme Court, have done this by ultimately excluding from OSHA's
target list essentially all workers except those in construction,
oil and gas extraction, maritime operations and high-hazard
manufacturing,'' the report said.
   The report was requested by the Senate commitee but did not come
up during the hearings. A copy was obtained by The Associated Press.
   ``OSHA's relative success in reducing injury and fatality rates
in the construction industry suggests that OSHA is getting some
positive effects from concentrating its limited resources,'' the
report said.
   As a result of the attention on construction, Pendergrass
acknowledged that the length of time between routine inspections _
those that are not in response to a specific complaint _ of
facilities in other industries is often lengthy.
   For example, in a high-hazard industry like meatpacking, he
said, each plant is routinely inspected only about once every three
years. Kennedy said that frequency of inspections is woefully
inadequate.

   Michael Dukakis' victory in the New York
primary appeared to nudge a handful of congressional Democrats onto
his campaign bandwagon Wednesday as the House decided on its
``super delegates'' to the national convention.
   Thirtyeight of the 207 House members approved at a closed-door
meeting said they were backing Dukakis for the party's presidential
nomination. The Massachusetts governor gained the support of 12
delegates from the time the House nominated its delegate slate of
205 last week and gave final approval to 207 House members on
Wednesday.
   Jesse Jackson had the backing of 15 House members, and Tennessee
Sen. Albert Gore Jr., picked up 12. Illinois Sen. Paul Simon, who
has suspended his campaign, gained 10 House members.
   There were 132 uncommitted.
   On Tuesday, Democrats in the Senate held a ceremonial vote to
pick their 43 national convention delegates, with Dukakis garnering
the support of 13 senators and Gore getting seven, including
himself.
   Simon managed to win only one seat for himself and the backing
of fellow Illinois Sen. Alan Dixon. Twenty-one senator-delegates
remain uncommitted.
   The 250 congressional delegates will be among 643 super
delegates to attend the convention in Atlanta, July 18-21. These
delegates, who include governors, members of the Democratic
National Committee and other party leaders, receive their
convention credentials based on offices they hold or formerly held.
   Only New York's primary and California's on June 7 offer more
delegates than the behind-the-scenes ``primary'' on Capitol Hill.
   The candidates, battling for the 2,081 delegates needed to
nominate, have approached the large bloc of super delegates with
personal phone calls and extensive mailings.
   The Dukakis campaign, which has a well-organized network for
communicating with super delegates, has not changed its approach
despite the victory in New York, a spokeswoman said.
   ``We're not doing anything any differently today than we did two
weeks ago,'' said Susan Brophy, who handles delegate selection for
the campaign.
   ``I don't see a deluge,'' Ms. Brophy said, hours after the New
York win. However, she added that ``members of Congress seem to be
moving a little more quickly than DNC members.''
   Dukakis remains the front-runner in The Associated Press count
of super delegates with 117.65. Gore is second with 47.55, Jackson
third with 45.1 and Simon fourth with 28.5. The others are
uncommitted.

   Israeli-backed militiamen ambushed
pro-Iranian guerrillas in south Lebanon Wednesday, and police said
four combatants were killed.
   A police spokesman said militiamen of the South Lebanon Army
fired on six guerrillas of the Islamic Resistance as they prepared
to launch an attack south of Jezzine, a town controlled by the
Israeli-supported militia.
   The spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said three
guerrillas and a militiaman were killed in the 20-minute firefight.
   South Lebanon Army gunners later pounded the Bekaa Valley towns
of Mashgara and Ein el-Tineh, east of Jezzine, with 155mm howitzers
to prevent the Islamic Resistance from reinforcing the men who were
ambushed.
   The Islamic Resistance movement is dominated by the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God.
   Hezbollah, made up of Shiites loyal to Iran's Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini, is believed to be an umbrella for factions holding most
of the 22 foreigners missing in Lebanon.
   Hezbollah is active in the Syrian-policed Bekaa Valley and
Beirut's southern slums but was crushed in south Lebanon this month
by its main Shiite rival, the Amal militia led by Justice Minister
Nabih Berri.
   Syria, the main power broker in Lebanon, has 25,000 troops in
the Bekaa and north Lebanon under a 1976 Arab League peacekeeping
mandate.
   It also deployed 7,500 troops in Moslem west Beirut in February
1987 in an effort to end militia warfare.

   A Charles Town pizza parlor owner whose
restaurant became a hangout for drug dealers said Wednesday he's
been ordered to vacate his building, even though he asked police to
help drive the traffickers out.
   John Mao on Wednesday said he's been unfairly singled out
because drug dealers, rousted by a police crackdown one block away,
moved into his Frank's Pizza restaurant. His landlord has given him
until May 31 to move out.
   Charles Town city officials say they also may order Mao to close
his pizza parlor once a circuit judge backs an April 12 city
council resolution allowing them to shut down businesses that
create a public nuisance _ namely those that harbor drug dealers.
   ``They're just using me as a scapegoat,'' Mao said Wednesday.
``It makes me angry. I went down there to the police to ask for
help. Why are they doing this?''
   Frank's Pizza, which the 30-year-old Hong Kong native bought in
1980, is located in Hilldale Shopping Plaza in Charles Town, a town
of 2,800 in extreme eastern West Virginia. When police began
stepping up patrols in an area one block away frequented by drug
dealers, the dealers started moving into the mall's parking lot _
and into Frank's Pizza.
   Mao said he asked the police department for increased patrols
around his business. He said an officer occasionally strolled
through his restaurant, but it wasn't enough to keep the dealers
out.
   ``They were so brave and obvious,'' he said. ``They didn't care.
They weren't even scared of the police because the police never
hassled them.''
   Mao said he moved closing time from 11 p.m to 7 p.m. ``just so
they (drug dealers) wouldn't have a place to go.''
   On April 9, state and federal authorities staged a large raid on
dealers alleged to be involved in a cocaine trafficking ring based
in the Caribbean. Since the raid, part of which appeared on a
national ABC news broadcast on the drug problem, at least 40 people
have been indicted on charges involving the distribution of crack,
cocaine and marijuana.
   After the raid, U.S. Attorney William Kolibash said local police
officials were told to keep their hands off the crack dealers in
order not to interfere with the federal and state drug
investigation.
   ``This drug thing is a terrible thing for the town. I was hoping
it would stay away from the mall,'' said attorney Roger Perry, who
owns Hilldale Shopping Plaza.
   Mao said the April 9 raid helped clear the dealers out of his
restaurant, and Perry agreed that things have cleaned up since
then. But Perry still has told Mao he must leave the 10-store
shopping center by May 31 because of the drug activity that
occurred in the restaurant before the raid.
   ``The activity stepped up, so we decided to act,'' Perry said.
``We only had one recourse.'' He said he thought Mao was being
treated fairly.
   The city could also order Mao to shut the business down but has
not because it is waiting on Jefferson County Circuit Court to rule
on its request for an court order backing up its April 12
resolution.
   ``If it's a nuisance, we want it closed,'' Charles Town Mayor
D.C. ``Doc'' Master said.
   A hearing was scheduled Tuesday on the city's request for the
injunction, but Master said he and the council decided to hold off
because they didn't want to call as witnesses undercover officers
looking into the drug problem.
   The hearing has been rescheduled for May 9.
   Mao said he has tried to talk to Master twice and said the mayor
keeps putting him off. Master acknowledged that he hasn't talked to
Mao.
   ``I don't drink, I don't smoke, I don't even have a traffic
ticket in Charles Town,'' Mao said. ``I've worked very hard in this
business, and I don't want no hassle from either side.''

<TEXT>
   Congress gave final approval Wednesday to a
broad education bill that renews and expands programs for the
nation's students and contains a ban on pornographic telephone
message services.
   The Hawkins-Stafford School Improvement Act went to the White
House, where President Reagan was expected to sign it.
   The measure authorizes up to $8.3 billion in spending on
elementary and secondary education for fiscal 1989, more than half
of it on the government's Chapter 1 program of compensatory
education for disadvantaged children.
   The bill also contains new programs to prevent dropouts and help
high school students with weak skills, and greatly expands drug
abuse education and magnet schools.
   New money also was earmarked for math, science and
foreign-language programs that lawmakers said would improve the
productivity of future U.S. workers.
   Negotiators smoothing out differences in the House and Senate
bills had thrown out a dial-a-porn ban sponsored by Sen. Jesse
Helms, R-N.C., and replaced it with a system under which telephone
customers would not have access to the messages unless they called
and requested a hookup.
   But lawmakers in the House, their eyes on the November election,
restored the complete ban before accepting the House-Senate
compromise Tuesday on a 397-1 vote. The Senate ratified the entire
package on Wednesday on a voice vote.
   The American Civil Liberties Union said no court has ever upheld
a complete ban on non-obscene, ``indecent'' speech. The group said
the ban, which sprang from concern about children calling to hear
the lewd telephone messages, intrudes on the privacy and
free-speech rights of adults.

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Spring snowstorms blanketed parts of Michigan, New Hampshire and
Nevada on Wednesday, while mountain areas in the West braced for
snow.
   Rain reached from California across eastern Oregon, northern
Nevada, southern Idaho, northwest Wyoming and southeast Montana.
The rain changed to snow in higher elevations.
   A winter storm warning was posted for the central and southwest
mountains of Idaho, and a winter storm watch was in effect for
higher elevations of the central and northern mountains of Arizona.
   Snow fell in the California mountains, and heavy rain at lower
elevations prompted flood advisories for some urban areas. Rain
also dampened northern Illinois, northern Indiana, northwest Ohio,
southern Michigan and southeast Wisconsin.
   Heavier rainfall during the six hours ending at 2 p.m. EDT
included 1.05 inches at the San Diego Naval Air Station and 0.54
inch at Imperial Beach, Calif.
   During the same period, 5 inches of snow fell at Mount
Washington, N.H., and 1 inch at Marquette, Mich. Austin, Nev., got
3 inches in the morning.
   Temperatures at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 30 degrees at Saranac
Lake, N.Y., to 91 at San Angelo, Tex. The nation's morning low was
17 at Warroad, Minn.
   Thursday's forecast called for rain, changing to snow in the
mountains, from the inland portions of the northern and central
Pacific Coast to southern California, from Idaho to Arizona and
Montana and from northwest of Colorado to South Dakota and northern
Nebraska.
   High temperatures were expected to reach the mid-30s over the
mountains of northern Arizona; the 40s and 50s from New England
across the Great Lakes, the upper Mississippi Valley, the northern
Plains, the Rockies, the northern plateau and the Great Basin; the
80s from South Carolina across Florida, the central Gulf states,
the lower Mississippi Valley and much of the southern Plains; the
90s over western Texas, and the 60s and 70s elsewhere.

   City Councilman Walt Calinger was picked
Wednesday as Omaha's 45th mayor, succeeding Bernie Simon, who died
last week of cancer.
   City Council selected the 48-year-old lawyer in a 4-3 vote over
Council President Fred Conley, who had contended he would not be
chosen because he is black.
   Calinger was sworn in immediately and pledged to work for
increased prosperity.
   ``The task that brings us here in some ways is not a pleasant
one,'' he said. ``Bernie Simon was a great mayor and a model for us
all. He was a healer of the city and I hope to be the same.''
   Calinger will serve the remaining 14 months of a four-year term
that originally was Mike Boyle's. Simon was chosen by the council
to replace Boyle in February 1987 after Boyle was recalled from
office. Simon died April 14.
   Conley said he had been done an injustice. `We're still working
or will be working toward that dream that one day everyone in this
country will be judged on the content of their character and not
the color of their skin,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   The 31 remaining hostages were tense and
trembling as they filed quietly off the hijacked Kuwaiti jumbo jet
in pre-dawn darkness Wednesday to end their ordeal on its 16th day.
   The hijackers, who murdered two hostages at an earlier stop in
Larnaca, Cyprus, were the first to debark at Algiers and they
slipped away into the night.
   Kuwait's official news agency KUNA, citing unidentified Algerian
sources, said there were nine hijackers.
   The purser on the Kuwait Airways plane, Egyptian Abdel Monem
Mahmoud, said after his release Wednesday that the gunmen had the
eyes ``of a shark.''
   The air pirates agreed to let the hostages go after arranging
safe passage with Algerian authorities, who served as mediators
between hijackers and Kuwaiti officials. The gunmen had demanded
that Kuwait release 17 extremists imprisoned for the 1983 bombings
of the U.S. and French embassies there.
   The first of the former captives to descend the gangway were
Anware Al-Sabah and Ibtesam Al-Sabah, second cousins to the emir of
Kuwait and the only two women left aboard the plane.
   Wearing thick black veils, the women were taken to an Algiers
clinic with their brother, Fadel Khaled Al-Sabah, who was suffering
from a nervous disorder, a doctor said. Algerian authorities said
the three were not hurt.
   Floodlights that had bathed the blue-and-white jet nightly since
it landed in the North African capital a week ago were turned off
at 9 p.m. Tuesday and never came back on.
   Most of the freed hostages emerged from their ordeal appearing
uncertain that their nightmare was really over.
   Few of them saw the hijackers' faces because the gunmen wore
pillowcases over their heads, with holes cut out for the eyes.
   The purser, Mahmoud, said ``The worst moment was when they put a
gun to the head of one of the passengers ... Their eyes behind
their masks were sharp and expressionless, like those of a shark.''
   A second hostage, 33-year-old meteorologist Khaled Mubarak, said
he glimpsed five of the hijackers through a crack in the toilet
door. From this glimpse and from their voices, he said he might be
able to recognize some of gunmen in the future.
   ``All except the leader. I never saw his face and he never spoke
to us,'' he said.
   The hostages said none of them was aware that the hijackers
killed two Kuwaiti security men aboard the plane in Cyprus last
week. The hijackers probably used silencers on the guns.
   Ali Kandari, 24, looking astonished, said, ``I had no idea they
killed anyone. Who was it? Where? When?''
   No hostage reported being tortured or beaten, but Kandari said
he saw one hijacker savagely hitting an old man who insisted on
going to the toilet after being told to sit down.
   The man, a diabetic, was released last Thursday and hospitalized.
   Hostages said they remained handcuffed at all times.
   On Tuesday night, hours before their release, the hijackers
distributed the traditional evening meal served during the Moslem
holy month of Ramadan, they said, then directed the captives to go
to sleep without allowing them the usual time for prayer.
   Tadar El Khebi, a 31-year-old businessman, said he knew they
were about to be released when he saw the hijackers going through
the plane shortly after 4 a.m. Wednesday wiping it clean of
fingerprints. Two hours later, the hostages walked off the plane to
freedom.
   Many hostages were in constant fear for their lives.
   Mahmoud said, ``From the very begining I thought of death. I
thought I would be the first to be killed because they were very
security conscious, and they immediately asked me where I had my
gun.
   ``My mind kept flashing back to my past. At such moments, you
think about things that you never imagined you would remember.''
   Mahmoud said he was in a Kuwait Airways Boeing 727 when it was
hijacked in 1984, with two American passengers killed.
   ``I'm happy I'm still OK,'' he said.
   Subhi Youssef, 53, the gray-bearded Iraqi captain of the plane,
sat quietly in the airport VIP lounge amid the reporters.
   When a reporter asked what he would do after returning to
Kuwait, Youssef, a pilot for 32 years, smiled slightly and replied,
``I will sit and think about it.''
   Reporters asked Youssef how he felt when the hijackers put a gun
to his head in the cockpit when they seized the plane on April 5 on
a flight from Bangkok, Thailand, to Kuwait.
   ``What can you do?'' Youssef replied, shrugging.
   His face showed the fatigue shared by all the hostages.
   Another hostage, a 26-year-old lieutenant in the Kuwaiti fire
service who gave his name only as Ali, said he never lost
confidence a solution would be found and that he fully supported
Kuwait's refusal to meet the hijackers' main demand.
   ``We agree with our government's attitude,'' he said. ``But we
knew they would help us. Our government never forgets any Kuwait
citizen.''
   The plane was carrying 112 people at the time of the hijack, but
hostages were released at stops at Mashhad, Iran, and at Larnaca.

   The House formally selected Rep. Glenn

Transportation Committee, a position that has been vacant since the
death of Rep. James Howard, D-N.J.
   Anderson, the committee's ranking Democrat, has been acting
chairman since Howard died March 25 after suffering a heart attack.
   The House approved his selection by a unanimous voice vote. He
was not challenged for the job.
   The committee oversees billions of dollars in highway, mass
transit, aviation and water programs.
   Anderson, 75, has been chairman of the panel's surface
transportation subcommittee. David Smallen, spokesman for the
lawmaker, said he has still not decided whether he will relinquish
that position.
   The Los Angeles congressman has a low-key, non-confrontational
style that has largely kept him out of the limelight so far in a
20-year House career.

<HEAD>Iran-Contra Defense Says Judge Making `Mockery' Of Their Rights</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The judge in the Iran-Contra case was accused
Wednesday of making ``a mockery'' of three defendants' rights by
limiting their ability to question whether prosecutors illegally
used congressional testimony as evidence.
   Lawyers for Marine Lt. Col. Oliver L. North, former national
security adviser John M. Poindexter and arms dealer Albert Hakim
asked U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell to reconsider
procedures he had established for next Monday's hearing on whether
the prosecution's case is tainted by the use of evidence gleaned
from the defendants' compelled testimony before Congress.
   The lawyers asked Gesell to reconsider his decision not to allow
them to question grand jurors and a wide range of prospective trial
witnesses to determine if they were exposed to the defendants'
congressional testimony that was given under grants of limited
immunity from prosecution.
   Gesell's ruling ``both in its limited scope and in its failure
to order discovery relating to the issues of taint, makes a mockery
of the orders of the United States District Court for the District
of Columbia compelling defendants' testimony'' before Congress, the
defense said.
   The order ``renders hollow the judicial promise that no
testimony or other information compelled under those orders would
be used directly or indirectly against these defendants,'' the
defense brief said.
   The defense also threatened to appeal Gesell's ruling ``unless
the court clarifies or modifies this order.''
   The three defendants and retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard V.
Secord _ who testified on Capitol Hill without limited immunity _
are accused conspiring to illegally divert profits from the
U.S.-Iran arms sales to the Nicaraguan rebels.
   In setting Monday's preliminary hearing on the immunity issue,
Gesell said he would hear testimony from independent counsel
Lawrence E. Walsh about what safeguards were imposed to prevent
prosecutors and grand jurors from being exposed to the testimony of
North, Poindexter and Hakim.
   Gesell also said the defense could produce one or two grand jury
witnesses to try to show their secret testimony was influenced by
the congressional hearings on the Iran-Contra affair.
   Defense lawyers told the judge they were confidence they could
``draw blood'' when they questioned such a witness.
   But the judge refused to let lawyers question grand jurors or
individual prosecutors as well as their friends and spouses to
determine if they were exposed to the congressional testimony of
North, Poindexter and Hakim.
   ``Certainly common sense tells us that there is virtually no
prospective witness in this case who has not been exposed to, and
to some degree influenced by, defendants' immunized testimony,''
the defense said.
   ``This case is an omelet from which the tainted immunized
testimony can never be unscrambled,'' the defense said.
   ``The unprecedented dissemination of immunized testimony in this
case obviously raises paramount issues relating to protection of
defendants' fundamental Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights that
transcend this case,'' the defense said.
   ``This court threatens to trivialize these constitutional rights
by deciding significant issues through inaction, and by
establishing procedures _ apparently intended to spare the
independent counsel inconvenience and to push the case forward _
that are inconsistent with controlling precedent and that do not
even begin to protect defendants' rights,'' said defense attorneys
Brendan V. Sullivan Jr., Richard W. Beckler and N. Richard Janis.
   In a hearing last week, Gesell said he would like to determine
if it is feasible to begin the trial in July.
   The defense asked that the trial be scheduled for next March,
two months after President Reagan leaves office. The possibility of
a post-election presidential pardon went unmentioned by the defense.
   Although the White House denies such a pardon is being
considered, the defense would want to take advantage of such a
possibility by seeking to delay the trial as long as possible.

   Carlos Lehder Rivas offered in 1979 to
sell part of a Bahamian island to the exiled Shah of Iran,
according to a letter introduced Wednesday at Lehder's
cocaine-smuggling trial.
   Lehder, 38, of Colombia, and Jack Carlton Reed, 57, of San
Pedro, Calif., are on trial on charges of conspiring to smuggle 3.3
tons of cocaine into the United States from Colombia via Norman's
Cay in the Bahamas from 1978 to 1980.
   The trial, in its 21st week, has heard from more than 100
prosecution witnesses.
   On May 3, 1979, Lehder wrote to Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, then
staying at Paradise Island in Nassau, Bahamas, according to the
letter.
   ``It occurs to me that you might in fact be interested in
acquiring a portion of the land which we own at Norman's Cay in the
Exumas,'' said the letter.
   ``We are currently working on plans to extend the airport but it
is our intention to keep the island fairly private as we like our
privacy and knowing that this is your own feeling, we would not be
adverse to sharing this privacy with you, if you are at all
interested.''
   Six days later, Lehder received a reply from Kambiz Atabai, the
shah's chief of protocol, rejecting the offer.
   The letters were among documents found in four large boxes of
records from six Lehder companies.
   The records are being introduced into evidence during the
testimony of Wendell Welman, a criminal investigator for the
Internal Revenue Service.
   The government is attempting to discredit defense contentions
that Lehder was a legitimate businessman. It contends Lehder
operated Norman's Cay as his cocaine-smuggling base.
   The defense has claimed that Lehder planned to develop Norman's
Cay into a ``first-class private resort,'' as one of the documents,
a 1979 press release, stated.

   Attorney General Edwin Meese III's choice for
the No. 2 post at the Justice Department withdrew from
consideration Wednesday as Meese struggled to fill top-level posts.
   ``We've only had a very few'' resignations, Meese defiantly told
a Senate subcommittee on Capitol Hill, defending his leadership of
the Justice Department and his personal ethics in the face of a
nearly year-long criminal investigation.
   Sen. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., told the attorney general that the
Justice Department is ``seemingly in disarray,'' and asked: ``Can
you continue on efficiently and effectively under these
circumstances?''
   ``The newspapers don't have it quite right,'' Meese responded.
``There's been considerable exaggeration.''
   John Shepherd, the 62-year-old former American Bar Association
president who Meese hurriedly recommended to the White House April
5 to become deputy attorney general, pulled out in the face of
mounting publicity about an alleged affair with his bookkeeper.
   It also was disclosed that longtime Meese friend E. Robert
Wallach, now under indictment in the Wedtech scandal, had
recommended Shepherd to Meese for a Justice Department post in 1984
or 1985 and that Shepherd belongs to an all-white country club and
an all-male social club.
   Meese told reporters he doesn't think he will have ``any trouble
... at all'' in filling the No. 2 post. But he canceled a trip to
London for a conference on international terrorism at least in part
to try to fill top-level department vacancies, said department
sources, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   ``I am concerned about the personal and financial sacrifices my
family and I were being asked to make in order to accept a very
difficult short-term appointment,'' Shepherd said in a statement.
   ``My wife and I were not prepared for the pressures to which
someone recommended for this position at this time would be
subject,'' Shepherd added.
   Meese was asked about the management problems at a Capitol Hill
hearing that also focused on conflict-of-interest allegations
against him.
   The Associated Press reported last week that the Justice
Department signed a $50 million lease on the building owned in part
by Howard M. Bender after his family's foundation routed money to
the Multiple Sclerosis Society for Mrs. Meese's $40,000-a-year job.
   Meese reiterated that there was no connection between the lease
and Mrs. Meese's job and called the story an ``outrageous and
scurrilous attack.'' He said an attempt to discredit him through
his wife was ``the lowest form of journalism.''
   Meese said the Benders made a charitable contribution and did
not pay Mrs. Meese's salary.
   James Bierbower, the society's attorney, told the AP that Mrs.
Meese was hired only after the Bender Foundation made available
$40,000 for a development director for Operation Job Match, a
program that finds positions for handicapped people.
   Bierbower said MS officials and trustees decided in late 1985 to
hire a development director for the job match program. Mrs. Meese
was the person whom MS officials wanted to fill the position, he
said.
   ``Thereafter, the officers were able to make arrangements ...
that the Bender Foundation would fund the position for 1986 with a
$40,000 grant and that Mrs. Meese would be hired as development
director,'' he said.
   The MS society successfully solicited an additional $40,000
grant from the Bender Foundation to keep Mrs. Meese on the payroll
in 1987. The society has a commitment from the foundation to pay
$40,000 in 1988 for her salary, but the check has yet to be
received, he said.
   In comments to reporters, Meese blamed Shepherd's withdrawal on
the news media, saying that it was due to ``all of the raking
over'' and the ``false allegation'' concerning the bookkeeper.
   Meanwhile, The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported Wednesday that
the woman, Denise Sinner, made up nearly every portion of her
background. Ms. Sinner told investigators and employers about
attending college, having terminal cancer and performing well in
past jobs. But people interviewed by the newspaper, including
Sinner's former husband, said she had lied.
   Sinner was convicted in March of stealing nearly $147,000 from
Shepherd's law firm. Sinner claimed she had had an affair with
Shepherd and that he had told her to write checks on the firm's
account for her personal use.
   Shepherd testified during the trial that all her accusations
were lies.
   Meese said ``the intense media attention'' had a ``severe
personal impact'' on Shepherd and his family.
   All the adverse information was previously known to the White
House and the Justice Department and ``there is nothing whatsoever
to suggest that Mr. Shepherd would have had any confirmation
problems,'' Meese said in a statement.
   Shepherd, who hadn't been nominated yet by President Reagan and
whose selection by Meese was announced prior to normal White House
clearance procedures and FBI background checks, would have replaced
Deputy Attorney General Arnold Burns, whose last day at the
department is Friday.
   Burns and criminal division chief William Weld resigned in
protest March 29 out of concern that the nearly year-long criminal
investigation of Meese was hurting the Justice Department's
operations, morale and public image.
   At the Senate hearing, Meese also was forced to rebut
suggestions by Sen. Warren Rudman of New Hampshire, ranking
Republican on the subcommittee that handles Justice Department
appropriations, that Meese should have a higher level of ethical
sensitivity.
   In a probe that began last May 11, independent counsel James
McKay has been investigating Meese's ties to scandal-plagued
Wedtech Corp. and a $1 billion Iraqi oil pipeline project. Wallach
represented Wedtech and a partner in the proposed pipeline.
   ``There was no such hint, no such suggestion and no such
suspicion, no such basis for the most sensitive person to reach ...
conclusions'' that there would be any appearance of impropriety,
responded Meese. McKay's probe of Meese's activities is continuing.
   Five of Burns' six deputies have now resigned, leaving the No. 2
office at the department virtually vacant.
   The No. 3 office in the department also is nearly vacant with
the departure last Friday of Stephen Trott to become a federal
appeals court judge. All but one of his deputies also have left.
   While it is customary for aides to top-level appointees to
depart when the boss leaves, aides to Meese had asked three
deputies to Burns to stay on following the abrupt resignations of
the deputy attorney general and Weld, department sources said.
   Shepherd was Meese's second choice to take Burns' place. The
attorney general was rebuffed by Philadelphia lawyer and former
federal judge Arlin Adams, who said earlier this month that he had
a heavy caseload at his law firm and pointed out that he had just
joined the firm last year.

<HEAD>Rights Group Alleges Torture of Consulate Riot Suspects</HEAD>

   A human rights group charged
Wednesday that the 12 young men jailed in connection with the
attack on the U.S. Consulate in Tegucigalpa have been tortured.
   Anibal Puerto, vice president of the independently run Committee
for the Defense of Human Rights, said the torture included burning
with an iron and beatings with baseball bats. He told a news
conference he visited the 12 in the Central Penitentiary, where
they are being held.
   ``All of them without exception have been subjected to
interrogation under torture in the National Investigations
Directorate,'' he said.
   A woman who answered the telephone at the directorate said no
one was available for comment. She refused to identify herself.
   The case is being handled by Judge Saul Suazo Lara.
   Daniel Rivera, assistant to the judge, confirmed in a telephone
interview with The Associated Press that during Suazo's questioning
of the accused, they complained of being tortured.
   He said court-appointed doctors examined them to determine if
they had been abused, but the doctors' reports have not yet been
delivered to the judge.
   The 12, mostly high school and university students, are accused
of sedition, arson and terrorism in connection with the April 7
burning and sacking of the U.S. Consulate.
   About 2,000 people attacked the embassy complex over the forced
extradition of reputed drug kingpin Juan Ramon Matta two days
earlier. The protesters said it was a violation of the Honduran
Constitution.
   Honduran security forces working with U.S. agents arrested
Matta, a Honduran citizen, on April 5 and put him on a plane to the
Dominican Republic. The constitution bars extradition of
native-born citizens.
   Matta is in a federal prison in Marion, Ill. awaiting trial on
drug and murder charges.
   The demonstrators accused U.S. authorities of pressuring
Honduran officials to break a fundamental law of the land on behalf
of U.S. interests.
   Puerto said one of the accused was burned on the arm with an
iron. He said others were beaten with bats, clubs and wire, grabbed
by the hair and had their heads beaten against the wall.
   He said the police interrogators put revolver barrels in their
mouths and threatened to kill them. The accused were told that if
they complained of the abuses, their relatives would suffer, Puerto
said.
   Ramon Custodio Lopez, president of the rights committee, told
the news conference he was threatened Tuesday by plainclothes
security agents who pointed pistols at him as he and other rights
activists emerged from the committee office.
   He said the agents tried to detain him, but bystanders
intervened, giving him and the others the chance to scoot back into
the building.

   Consumer prices shot up 0.5 percent in March
as a record increase in clothing costs and higher food and gasoline
prices triggered the biggest jump in inflation in 14 months, the
government reported Wednesday.
   Analysts said the sharp increase in the Labor Department's
Consumer Price Index, which translated into a 6.4 percent annual
rate of increase, demonstrated that the weak dollar and
unexpectedly strong consumer demand were threatening to ignite a
new bout of inflation.
   They said those pressures would soon prompt the Federal Reserve
to step in with a dose of higher interest rates to cool off the
economy.
   The bond market, a good barometer of inflation sentiment,
reacted negatively following release of the CPI report, but posted
a small rally later in the day as investors shook off a week of
inflation worries.
   Treasury's key 30-year bond closed at 9 percent, down from 9.04
percent the previous day, but still higher than the 8.73 percent
yield just a week ago. Bond investors fear inflation because it
erodes the value of their holdings.
   The financial markets were first thrown into turmoil last week
when an unexpectedly high U.S. trade deficit for February sent the
dollar plunging and the government reported that the Producer Price
Index, which measures wholesale prices, shot up by 0.6 percent in
March.
   The Reagan administration, which is counting on the Federal
Reserve to keep the economy moving forward through the November
election, contended Wednesday that the inflation fears were being
overblown.
   ``Despite large increases for consumer and producer prices in
March, the smaller increases in prices in previous months ...
indicate that inflation remains under control,'' said presidential
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
   But private economists disputed that view.
   ``The CPI rise reflects an increasingly widespread inflationary
environment,'' said Allen Sinai, chief economist of the Boston Co.
``The good news on inflation is over for this year and the question
now really is how high will prices go.''
   The March CPI increase followed a modest 0.2 percent February
rise and was the biggest monthly gain since a 0.7 percent increase
in January 1987.
   More than one-fourth of the March surge was attributed to a
record 2 percent spike in apparel costs as retailers boosted prices
on the new spring and summer fashions, especially for women's
clothes.
   Analysts blamed the higher clothes costs in part on the weaker
dollar, which boosts the costs of imports. If consumers balk at
paying the higher costs, retailers will be forced to offer
discounts to clear their racks, something they had to do last year,
analysts said.
   Besides clothing, retail prices were also driven upward by a 0.4
percent gain in gasoline costs, the first increase since August.
From September through February, pump prices had actually fallen
5.9 percent.
   But increased world energy demands, the success of oil-producing
countries at limiting production and heightened tensions in the
Persian Gulf are putting upward pressure on prices, analysts said.
   Donald Ratajczak, director of economic forecasting at Georgia
State University, said that gasoline costs could well shoot up by
as much as 4 percent in the April report, reflecting big increases
in pump prices nationwide.
   ``It would be wrong to assume that the March increase is a
one-month event,'' he said. ``April is not going to be nice to look
at either.''
   But Ratajczak said price pressures should ease somewhat after
that, especially if labor costs remain moderate. He predicted that
consumer prices for all of 1988 would rise 4.4 percent, identical
to the 1987 increase.
   In another economic report, the Labor Deparment said Americans'
average weekly earnings, after discounting for inflation, fell 0.3
percent in March, the second consecutive monthly decline. The
changes left Americans' inflation-adjusted earnings 1.2 percent
below a year ago.
   The Commerce Department released a report Wednesday showing that
per capita incomes increased 4.8 percent in 1987, down from 5.2
percent in 1986. When adjusted to remove the effects of price
increases, it was the smallest year-to-year change since the
recession year of 1982.
   On the inflation report, the Labor Department gaves these other
details:
   _Grocery store prices rose 0.4 percent after falling 0.6 percent
in February. The increase was led by a 4.6 percent jump in egg
prices, but the costs of fresh fruits, meat and poultry were also
up. Vegetable prices continued to decline, falling 14.9 percent in
the first three months of this year. That reversed most of the 25.5
percent increase in 1987.
   _New automobile prices rose 0.3 percent, but that increase was
largely offset by a 1.4 percent drop in the cost of obtaining car
loans.
   _Public transportation costs climbed 0.5 percent, reflecting
widespread airline fare increases.
   _Medical care costs rose 0.4 percent and have risen at an annual
rate of 7.7 percent in the first three months of this year, the
fastest-rising segment in the consumer price calculation.
   Overall, retail prices have risen at a 4.2 percent annual rate
in the first three months of this year.
   The March increase left the index at 116.5, meaning that a
hypothetical market-basket of goods costing $100 during a 1982-84
base period would have cost $116.50 last month.

   The Revolutionary Justice Organization is watching the
developments of the Kuwaiti plane hijacking with reassurance and
praises the wisdom and strength of the hijackers. It also supports

realized because no one can undertake any negative actions against
you as the hostages' lives will be in danger, not to mention all
other possibilities.
   We caution the Algerian government, which has mediated for the
release of some French hostages, against any violation or deception
in its dealings with the hijackers of the Kuwaiti plane because
there will be total retaliation which will not stop at Kuwait's
border or Algeria's airport.
   The Revolutionary Justice Organiztion declares that it will not
sit back and watch America's aggressions in the gulf. There will be
retaliations and retaliations to punish the aggressors and make
them understand they will regret their actions.

<HEAD>New Move to Drop Plant-Closings Plan as Trade Bill Nears House
Floor</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: New throughout with plant closings provision in jeopardy</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration won a round in
skirmishing over trade legislation Wednesday, raising chances that
lawmakers might still drop plant-closings provisions believed
certain to draw a veto.
   ``It is my hope that through this motion we will be able to get
a trade bill that can actually be enacted into law,'' Minority
Leader Robert H. Michel, R-Ill., said following action in the House
Rules Committee.
   The panel granted Michel's request for a floor vote Friday on
whether to send the bill back to a House-Senate conference
committee with orders to strip out the controversial provisions
requiring employers to provide 60-day notice of all but the
smallest plant closings and large-scale layoffs.
   The Reagan administration has been threatening a presidential
veto over the plant-closings provision, and there are substantial
doubts about whether enough support exists to override such a veto.
   Lawmakers whose home districts are hungering for such other
provisions as repeal of the windfall profits tax on oil companies
and massive farm subsidies reportedly have been losing enthusiasm
for anything that would draw a veto.
   The measure's central provisions streamline the system under
which the United States imposes import curbs and takes other
actions to retaliate against trade violations and aid American
industries threatened by surges in foreign competition.
   If Michel wins his battle to send the measure back to the
conference committee, a floor vote on the bill itself, scheduled
for Thursday afternoon, in the House could be delayed.
   The Democratic-controlled Rules Committee was not obliged to
grant Michel's request for a vote to send the bill back to the
conference committee with instructions to strip out the
labor-backed plant-closings provisions.
   But Michel aide Joanna Schneider said she believed concern over
how a plant-closings veto could have affected the windfall profits
tax, the farm subsidies and a host of other narrow issues might
well have prompted lawmakers to scuttle the bill on the floor, even
without sending it back to committee.
   Rules Committee meetings are normally fairly quick but
Wednesday's action was delayed for hours because of Democratic
fears that granting Michel's request would jeopardize the
plant-closings provision.
   The Republican leader had sought earlier to delay action on
grounds of a rule that newly minted legislation should sit for a
minimum of three days before going to the passage stage on the
House floor.
   ``In this case we are dealing with a piece of legislation 1,000
pages long and containing some of the most profound changes in U.S.
trade law in a decade or more,'' Michel said in a letter to Rules
Committee Chairman Claude Pepper, D-Fla.
   ``We have yet to see the language in this legislation but
nevertheless you are clearing the way for a vote for it within 24
hours,'' he said. ``We are not even certain it will be printed in
time for the floor vote.''
   The bill itself is expected to pass the House without much
trouble when the passage vote comes. The major question has been
whether there will be enough votes to sustain a veto if the
plant-closings provision remains in.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A British tycoon says he plans to build the
world's biggest luxury ocean liner, a ship longer than three
football fields.
   The ship will weigh 160,000 tons, measure 1,125 feet long,
accommodate 3,026 passengers and feature 12 swimming pools, the
world's largest casino and eight restaurants, according to
Indian-born Ravi Tikkoo, a British citizen.
   Designed with balconies overlooking the sea for its 1,513
cabins, the liner will cruise the Caribbean and Atlantic Ocean
after it is finished in 1992, he told a news conference Tuesday.
Tikkoo is expected to remain owner of the ship.
   He said the ship's size and design will revolutionize the
cruising industry and its construction will ``put Britain at the
top of the cruise ship-building nations.''
   The $456 million contract for the project, named ``Ultimate
Dream,'' was awarded to Harland and Wolff, a financially troubled
Belfast shipyard run by the British government in Northern Ireland.
   The heaviest luxury liner in use is the 74,000-ton Sovereign of
the Seas, which carries 2,284 passengers and 790 crew members. The
880-foot vessel was launched in January.
   The longest luxury liner is the 1,035-foot-long Norway, which
weighs 70,202 tons and carries 2,400 passengers.

   The chief prosecutor in the Robert F. Kennedy
assassination said Wednesday he doesn't recall any investigative
photographs being destroyed, as was revealed when the police files
were opened after two decades.
   Former Chief Deputy District Attorney Lynn D. Compton said he is
certain material wouldn't have been destroyed by police without
prosecutors knowing about it. He also said he is sure police didn't
destroy anything of importance.
   ``It always just annoys the hell out of me when self-appointed
experts surface years later and go at it like Agatha Christie. ...
That mentality escapes me,'' said Compton, now a state appeals
judge.
   Files of the investigation and evidence from the 1968
assassination at the Ambassador Hotel on the night of the New York
senator's Democratic presidential primary victory were made public
Tuesday at the state archives in Sacramento.
   The items included the .22-caliber gun Sirhan Bishara Sirhan
used to kill Kennedy on June 5, 1968, in the hotel kitchen.
   A certificate showed that 2,410 police photographs were burned
on Aug. 21, 1968. The documents also showed that door jambs and
ceiling tiles from the hotel kitchen were destroyed.
   Chief archivist John Burns speculated Tuesday the photos may
have duplicated others still in evidence. But he said the files
contain no such statement.
   Cmdr. William Booth, a Police Department spokesman, said he
could not confirm that photographs were destroyed but noted that in
1975 the department notified City Council of the routine
destruction of items gathered as potential evidence but which had
not turned out to be evidence.
   ``Whatever was destroyed was not anything that was needed or
used as evidence in the trial. If photographs were in fact
destroyed they would have fallen into that category and quite
likely were duplicates,'' Booth said.
   Greg Stone, a University of Wisconsin political scientist who
has studied the case for years, demanded a probe by the Los Angeles
Police Commission, a civilian group whose duties include monitoring
the Police Department.
   Commission Secretary Bill Moran did not immediately return a
telephone message.
   Compton said any destruction of material would not have been for
surreptitious reasons.
   ``It just could have been sheer volume of stuff _ that doesn't
mean anything,'' he said in a telephone interview from his home in
Lopez, Wash.
   He speculated the files may include ``a bunch of peripheral
material that we didn't feel necessary to use in the court
presentation. ... There were so many blind leads that were followed
in the case.''
   Former Police Chief Tom Reddin and the man who led the
investigation, then-Chief of Detectives Robert A. Houghton, told
the Los Angeles Times on Tuesday that they also did not recall that
any photographs were destroyed.
   Sirhan, a Jordanian immigrant who scribbled in his diary, ``RFK
must die,'' is serving a life term at Soledad prison. Second-gun
theories have haunted the case for many years. Sirhan says he was
the lone assassin.

   Gov. George Deukmejian endorsed Vice President
George Bush for the Republican presidential nomination on Wednesday.
   Deukmejian said Bush ``is unmatched in terms of the experience
and in terms of the leadership he has demonstrated'' and that the
vice president ``has demonstrated his strong support and loyalty to
President Reagan and to Republican ideals.''
   Deukmejian said he didn't endorse Bush earlier because he had
made a pledge to all the contenders for the GOP nomination that he
would remain neutral for the June 7 California primary.
   But only former television evangelist Pat Robertson remains in
the race against Bush. Robertson has all but abandoned campaigning
and concedes he has virtually no chance of getting the nomination.
   Asked by reporters at a news conference if he had supported Bush
from the start, or had favored one of the other GOP contenders,
Deukmejian said tersely: ``I'm going to keep that to myself.''

   The Iranian frigate
Sabalan crippled in this week's skirmish with U.S. warships was the
most notorious attacker of neutral ships in the Persian Gulf, U.S.
officers said.
   ``The captain of the Sabalan is a real fanatic,'' said one
officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   ``He's the one who shoots holes in the tankers in the Strait of
Hormuz and then says `Have a nice day,''' he said Tuesday.
   U.S. officers appeared generally satisfied with the naval action
against Iranian warships Monday, though some said the results could
have been better.
   Some officers appeared concerned that the Sabalan, one of the
Iranian frigates hit by U.S. missiles, was not sunk.
   Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci told reporters in Washington
the Sabalan attack was not followed up because the ship appeared
crippled.
   Senior U.S. officers said the missile exchange Monday was over
as far as the United States was concerned, but there was no
assurance Iran felt the same way.
   Capt. Donald Dyer, commander of the Desron 22, made up of some
of the U.S. warships in the gulf, said the situation remained
pretty tense.
   ``But I think it's beginning to back off a little bit. The
Iranians took some pretty heavy losses. I would hope today they
would disengage,'' he said Tuesday.
   Cmdr. Edward Mann, 42, skipper of this 3,700-ton frigate flying
the flag of Dyer's command, said he was surprised by Iran's
reaction and did not believe the issue of Iran's predatory attacks
on neutral commercial shipping has been settled.
   ``There ain't a winner until the game is over,'' he said.
   The clashes began with the U.S. naval attack on Iranian oil
platforms early Monday and continued through the day.
   In the action, Iran fired Chinese-made Silkworm anti-ship
missiles deployed along the Strait of Hormuz, gateway to the Gulf,
for the first time.
   Five of the huge subsonic projectiles were lobbed at the Jack
Williams and two destroyers sailing with it.
   All the missiles went awry, their radar guidance systems
confused by showers of aluminum chaff fired into the air by the
American ships.
   Four went into the sea and one skimmed beyond the Williams'
stern and struck an oil rig.
   A sixth was fired from Iranian positions in the northern end of
the gulf, but officers on the Williams did not know what happened
to it.
   Lt. Cmdr. Carl Van Dyke, a Navy spokesman, said there were no
American casualties in Monday's actions and Iranian casualties were
not known.
   (In Washington, the Pentagon called off the search for a
helicopter that did not return to the USS Wainwright on Monday and
listed its two crew members as missing.)
   The United States claimed one Iranian patrol boat sunk, three
armed Swedish-built speedboats sunk or damaged, and two frigates
disabled.
   In addition, Van Dyke said, the two oil platforms at Sirri and
Sassan in the south-central gulf were neutralized by naval gunfire
and by a Marine attack.
   U.S. officials said both were used for military purposes,
including support for speedboats attacking neutral ships in
retaliation for Iraqi air strikes on Iran's oil tankers during the
7{-year-old war.
   When an Iranian tugboat at Sirri radioed the cruiser Wainwright
for permission to pick up survivors in the water, Capt. James.
Chandler, the courtly Arkansan who commands the 8,200-ton warship,
agreed and dropped lifeboats.
   U.S. officers said the two frigates, Sahand and Sabalan, also
fired on U.S. aircraft after they ignored warnings against taking
any hostile action.
   This happened when the Williams' ``surface action group,'' which
also included the missile destroyer Joseph Strauss and the
destroyer O'Brien, received word an Iranian flotilla _ the Sahand
and at least eight Boghammer speedboats _ was approaching from
Iran's naval base at Bandar Abbas, 30 miles to the north.
   ``The Sahand is in your vicinity. Take him,'' was the terse
message from Rear. Adm. Anthony Less, commander of the Joint Task
Force Middle East.
   U.S. officers said two A-6 intruder jets from the USS
Enterprise, flying air cover, drew missile fire from the Sahand as
they made a reconnaissance flight over the Iranian ships.
   They retaliated with Harpoon missiles that damaged the
12-year-old British-built frigate.
   Then the Strauss, sailing just ahead of the Williams, fired
another Harpoon, blasting the ship from 20 miles away.
   When last seen by an American pilot, it was listing badly with a
hole in its hull and its superstructure ablaze. Whether it sank was
not known, Van Dyke said.
   The Babaland, the Sahand's sister ship, was hit by F-14 Tomcats
also flying off the Enterprise in the Arabian Sea.
   It was hit by a laser-guided, cluster-type skipper bomb and left
dead in the water. It was not known what happened to the ship since
the attack.

<HEAD>Government Encourages Chinese To Buy Their Homes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government outlined a program Wednesday for
expanding market-style economic reforms while fighting inflation,
the country's most pressing economic problem.
   Reform goals for 1988 include introducing competition for
company management posts and encouraging city dwellers to buy their
homes.
   So far, these measures have been introduced only experimentally
on a small scale.
   The program, announced by the official Xinhua News Agency, also
calls for such anti-inflation measures as tightening bank credit,
limiting state investment to major civic projects and limiting the
rapid growth of workers' wages and bonuses.
   Retail prices jumped 11 percent nationwide in the first quarter
of 1988, compared with a 7.3 percent increase in 1987. The price
increases have generated widespread grumbling.
   The reform program was devised by the State Commission for
Restructuring the Economy, which drew up the blueprints for China's
transformation from a centrally planned economy to one partially
directed by market forces.
   The commission, which was headed by the reformist Zhao Ziyang
until he took over as head of the Communist Party last year, now is
led by the new premier, Li Peng.
   The plan bears Li's stamp in its emphasis on fighting inflation
and its lack of new reform ideas. Li lacks Zhao's reputation as an
innovator and is believed to favor stability over rapid change.
   Xinhua did not carry comment from Li on the plan.
   The agency said the plan calls for 80 cities, including Beijing
and Shanghai, to reform their housing systems this year, a change
that is likely to generate widespread public opposition.
   Most urban houses and apartments are owned by the government or
by workplaces, which rent them for nominal fees.
   Housing reform, intended to save the government money, calls for
rents to be increased in line with maintenance costs and for
tenants to be encouraged to buy their apartments and houses. Xinhua
said the change is to be implemented nationwide within five years.
   Some local governments have said they will initially give
citizens subsidies to soften the blow of higher rents. Many Chinese
pay as little as $1.35 a month for rent.
   Under the program described Wednesday, the government will
expand its policy of letting state-owned enterprises make their own
economic decisions, and will introduce competition in filling
management posts, Xinhua said. Most managers are currently
appointed by the government.
   The program encourages businesses to use most of their profits
to improve production and to make sure workers' incomes do not grow
faster than productivity.
   Economists have blamed rising inflation in part on companies
using profits to give workers big bonuses.
   More enterprises will be allowed to issue bonds to the public,
Xinhua said, enabling them to raise cash while soaking up some of
the money supply.
   It said the government also will issue bonds to the public and
banks to make up its projected $2.2 billion deficit for 1988.
Government investment will be limited mainly to major road, bridge
and other infrastructure projects.
   Banks will issue fewer loans and increase their supervision of
companies that borrow money, the agency said.

   The Senate voted Wednesday to give $20,000
tax-free payments to thousands of Japanese-Americans who were
forced from their homes and sent to internment camps during World
War II.
   Final passage came on a 69-27 vote after an emotional debate in
which senators recalled the sometimes-harsh treatment and financial
losses suffered by about 120,000 Japanese-Americans who were
interned after Japan attacked Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, on Dec. 7, 1941.
   The bill would require the United States government to apologize
for the mass roundups and would make each of the estimated 60,000
survivors eligible for $20,000 payments. A similar bill already has
passed the House.
   On votes of 67-30 and 61-35, the Senate defeated attempts to
strip the bill of the payments, while retaining the apology. It
then voted 91-4 to kill an amendment proposed by Sen. Jesse Helms,
R-N.C., to withhold payments until Japan compensated American
families for losses suffered at Pearl Harbor.
   At one point, Sen. Spark Matsunaga, D-Hawaii, was brought to
tears as he told of an elderly Japanese-American internee being
killed by machine-gun fire when he strayed too close to a camp
fence.
   But Sen. Malcolm Wallop, R-Wyo., argued that the internment
``was not a dishonorable act, it was the option of a nation in the
first days of a war.''
   Even if it was dishonorable, Wallop argued, it would be
``repugnant to think a clear conscience is to be had for a mere
$20,000 figure ... honor doesn't come with a dollar sign on it and
you don't buy it back.''
   The bill would cost an estimated $1.3 billion.
   Gordon Hirabayashi, a Japanese-American whose curfew violation
conviction in Seattle led to one of the Supreme Court rulings
upholding the internment, said, ``Like someone who's a victim of a
serious accident and becomes a quadriplegic, no matter what's voted
in the way of acknowledgement of error, it'll never be whole.''
   Hirabayashi, a retired sociology professor living in Edmonton,
Canada, said Japanese-American at this stage simply wanted ``an
acknowledgement that a wrong was done and a vote for an honorable
redress. They hope that the honorable redress will serve as a
deterrent for anything like this to happen to any other unfortunate
group.''
   George Kondo of San Francisco, director of the Northern
California-Western Nevada-Pacific region of the Japanese-American
Citizens League, said, ``I think we deserve everything that's
coming to us. ... At least they are recognizing the fact that there
was a wrongful act against their own citizens.''
   ``Pleased would be an understatement,'' said Cherry Kinoshita of
Seattle, who was interned at Minidoka, in Idaho in 1942 at the age
of 18 and who has been active in seeking redress since 1976.
   ``We've been working for over 10 years to see this happen. I
think it's great to see our nation admit an error, and take steps
to remedy what was a great injustice,'' she said.
   Sen. Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii, a Japanese-American who lost his
right arm in combat with the Army in Italy, said: ``These payments
acknowledge the unconstitutional deprivation of liberty ... and the
stigma of being deemed unloyal.''
   ``If I were interned, I would consider $20,000 too little,''
Inouye said.
   Opponents, in addition to objections over the payments,
complained about a statement in the bill that the internment ``was
caused by racial prejudice, war hysteria and a failure of political
leadership.''
   ``Hindsight has proven us wrong,'' said Sen. Chic Hecht, R-Nev.
   ``But I cannot in good conscience go back and tell survivors of
Bataan, Iwo Jima and all those battles in the South Pacific and
tell them we have forgotten you but we are compensating the people
who we moved into camps,'' Hecht said.
   Matsunaga, the bill's chief sponsor, recalled in a floor speech
that he was an Army officer serving in Hawaii on Dec. 7, 1941.
   Matsunaga, a Japanese-American, recalled the story of an elderly
internee who was playing softball with his nephew when a ball
strayed too close to a fence.
   When the guard told the man to halt, Matsunaga quoted him as
replying, ``It's all right, I'm just going to pick up the
softball.''
   He moved forward and was killed by a burst of fire from the
guard's machine gun, Matsunaga told the Senate.
   At that point, Matsunaga halted in midsentence, unable to keep
his voice from breaking despite several attempts to resume speaking.
   ``I myself become overly emotional when I think about it even to
this day,'' he said after regaining composure.
   The measure is similar to a bill passed by the House last Sept.
17 by a 243-141 margin. The Senate version, however, authorizes
payments of up to $12,000 for surviving members of the Aleut Indian
tribes who were forcibly removed from the Aleutian Islands during
the Japanese attack on those islands in 1942.
   That and other minor differences would have to be worked out
before the bill could go to President Reagan, who has been urged to
veto it by the Office of Management and Budget because of its $1.3
billion price tag.
   Matsunaga, asked about veto prospects, said, ``We have mixed
reports'' from the White House. The White House supported the
measure going into the vote, said B.J. Cooper, a spokesman. But it
had also wanted certain changes to the bill, such as the deletion
of the Aleutian Island payments, which were not made. Cooper said
he did not know the White House position on the bill that was
passed.
   The internment camps arose from a 1942 order by President
Franklin D. Roosevelt that said the War Department could designate
military areas from which people could be excluded.
   Later military orders resulted in the exclusion of all people of
Japanese ancestry from California, Washington and Oregon, and some
in Hawaii. The orders affected 77,000 U.S. citizens and 43,000
legal and illegal resident aliens. All were taken to prison camps
in the Western states.
   The last camp was closed in January 1946.
   In all, about 120,000 people of Japanese ancestry were detained
in the camps, including 77,000 American citizens. An estimated
60,000 are still alive, and the bill would allow them to claim
individual $20,000 payments in return for waiving any further
wartime claims against the government.
   Congress has already awarded about $38 million in restitution
payments since the passage of a 1948 Evacuation Claims law. Five
years ago, however, a federal commission estimated that the
Japanese-Americans had suffered losses of up to $2 billion that had
never been compensated.
   About 900 Aleuts were moved from their homes and forced to live
in abandoned mines, canneries and camps about 2,000 miles away.
Lack of medical care and adequate food contributed to disease and
death and many of their homes were destroyed or vandalized in their
absence.
   About 450 Aleuts survive and would be eligible for $12,000
payments. Another $20 million would benefit Aleut villages and
provide for scholarships and the general welfare of the tribe.

   A newspaper columnist known for his
biting articles on local politicians and businessmen was shot to
death in his car, authorities said.
   Hector Felix, the 46-year-old co-editor of Zeta, was hit in the
head and arm by three shotgun blasts as he drove alone, said
District Attorney Francisco Dominguez.
   There was no known motive for the morning attack two miles from
Zeta's offices and eight miles east of downtown, police said. A
possible witness was being questioned by Baja California State
Judicial Police, Dominguez said.
   Felix had founded Zeta with his longtime friend and partner,
Jesus Blancornelas.
   ``Right now we are recovering from the shock,'' Blancornelas
said in a telephone interview. ``The government has said that it
respects freedom of expression and that the police are among the
most advanced. ... We hope that both those things might be
demonstrated.''
   Felix, had been with Zeta since 1980. He wrote a column for the
weekly, which is published in the Mexican border city and
distributed throughhout Baja California. It has a circulation of
60,000.
   ``He was a satirist. He was very well known and popular here in
the state,'' said Miguel Cervantes, a writer for Zeta. Cervantes
said Felix had no known enemies and called the shooting ``an act of
cowards'' aimed at muzzling the press.
   Felix's column, ``A Little Bit of Something,'' dealt with
everday occurences in the state's political and social life. He
often focused his sarcasm on government officials and business
people, chiding them for what he termed know-it-all attitudes and
arrogance.
   ``He had a sense of humor with a lot of spark that left many
uncomfortable, especially officials,'' Blancornelas said.
   Last year, Zeta offices were sprayed with bullets from a passing
car. No one was injured and police never found those responsible.

   Guerrillas armed with assault rifles
killed a West German priest when he tried to rescue another
missionary who was being attacked with a hatchet, a church
spokesman said Wednesday.
   Government troops combed western Zimbabwe for the four gunmen
believed responsible for the death Tuesday of Rev. Killian Knoerl,
58, a Roman Catholic missionary from Stuttgart.
   Rev. Oskar Wermter told a news conference that Knoerl was slain
at the Empandeni mission, about 12 miles from the Botswana border.
   The killing occurred hours after President Robert Mugabe
declared a general amnesty for rebels in the western province of
Matabeleland, where hundreds of civilians have been killed by
guerrillas in recent years.
   Knoerl was shot while coming to the aid of Rev. Johannes
Banning, who was being struck with a hatchet, Wermter said.
   Banning, 40, also a West German, was rushed to Central Hospital
in Bulawayo, the administrative capital of Matabeleland. His
condition was not known.
   The guerrillas, armed with AK-47 semiautomatic rifles, arrived
at the mission Tuesday night, ransacked homes and set fire to two
vehicles, Wermter said.
   The gunmen ordered a Zimbabwean priest, Rev. Luke Mlimo, to tie
up the other two priests and a third West German missionary and
strike them with the hatchet, the spokesman said.
   When Mlimo refused, one of the gunmen hit Banning on the head
with the hatchet, Wermter said. He said Knoerl ``grabbed the man's
ax and hit him. He was then killed with two rifle shots by one of
the bandits.''
   The attackers fled.
   Mugabe announced the amnesty on Tuesday, the eighth anniversary
of the country's independence. He said about 100 rebels remained in
Matabeleland, the traditional tribal stronghold of former
opposition leader Joshua Nkomo.
   Mugabe said the amnesty was the result of a unity pact signed
Dec. 22 with Nkomo.
   Mugabe and Nkomo led allied rebel armies fighting white rule
when Zimbabwe was a British colony known as Rhodesia. When
independence was declared and Mugabe became president, some Nkomo
supporters began fighting.
   In November, rebels hacked to death 16 white missionaries and
children at two farms south of Bulawayo.

   The U.S. presidential election has turned into a
race between Vice President George Bush and Gov. Michael Dukakis of
Massachusetts, with Bush the clear favorite, one of London's
biggest bookmakers said Wednesday.
   William Hill gave 2-5 odds for Bush, meaning a gambler would win
two dollars for every five wagered if Republican Bush won, said
Christine Stanley of the bookmaking firm. Bush's odds last week
were 4-9.
   The odds for Democratic front-runner Dukakis were 2-1, compared
with 11-4 last week, while the odds for his closest rival, Jesse
Jackson, were 25-1, compared with 12-1 last week, she said.
   ``(Bush) is the well-in-front favorite,'' she said.

   The House voted 213-201 Wednesday for a bill
that would make the first change in the nation's landmark
immigration law, by extending the amnesty deadline for illegal
aliens from May 4 to Nov. 30.
   House passage of the measure sent the proposal to an uncertain
fate in the Senate, where opponents could use delaying tactics.
   The Reagan administration opposes the bill, and the chief of the
nation's immigration service, Alan Nelson, has said he would
recommend a veto if the measure reached the president's desk.
   The Immigration and Naturalization Service warned late Wednesday
that because of opposition in the Senate and the possibility of a
presidential veto, an extension of the deadline was by no means
certain.
   ``INS is concerned that this misguided legislation will create
confusion among potential applicants and cause them to delay filing
beyond the May 4 cutoff date,'' the service said in a statement. It
said legalization offices would remain open on May 4 until midnight
to process applications and that aliens should ``continue to expect
that the last date'' to apply was May 4.
   The immigration law signed by President Reagan in November 1986
was finely tuned legislation that carefully balanced a legalization
program for illegal aliens with penalties for employers who
knowingly hiring undocumented workers.
   Under the law, those who have lived illegally in the United
States since before Jan. 1, 1982 had one year _ until May 4 _ to
apply for temporary residency.
   Approval by the Immigration and Naturalization Service for
temporary residency allows the aliens to live and work in the
United States, while they go through a longer process for permanent
residency and citizenship.
   Those favoring the extension contended the INS was slow in
writing rules for the temporary amnesty program, and said many of
those who initially feared the agency were at first reluctant to
come forward and apply.
   The fears existed, the supporters said, even though the law
prohibits immigration officials handling amnesty claims from
sharing their information on illegal aliens with the INS
enforcement agents.
   ``I am convinced that hundreds of thousands of potentially
eligible applicants have not applied and may not be able to apply
by the current May 4 deadline,'' said House Judiciary Committee
Chairman Peter W. Rodino, D-N.J.
   Rep. Romano L. Mazzoli, D-Ky., the chief sponsor of the
extension, said 1.2 million aliens have applied for amnesty and
729,000 have received temporary residency cards. Another 400,000
have applied for legalization under a separate program for
agricultural workers, but that program is not affected by the bill.
   Mazzoli said the number of applicants for the general amnesty
program was sizeable but ``falls short of the numbers anticipated.''
   He said that leaving additional illegal aliens in the country
would also mean a greater potential pool of undocumented workers,
which the sanctions program is trying to wipe out.
   The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the bill would
increase expenditures by $270 million through fiscal 1993 to pay
for administrative costs, reimbursements to states and federal
benefit programs.
   But supporters of the extension said fees charged applicants
will pay for much of the program, and added that the remaining
costs already have been appropriated.
   The chief opponent of the extension, Rep. Patrick L. Swindall,
D-Ga., pointed out that the amnesty provisions of the law only
passed the House by seven votes in 1986.
   ``If American citizenship is not worth filling out an
application today, what in the world is?'' he asked..
   And Rep. Marge Roukema, R-N.J., another opponent, said it was
``incomprehensible'' and would ``add insult to injury'' to pass the
measure while those applying under the legal immigration system
have to wait for years to gain residency.
   Rep. Dan Lungren, R-Calif., said he supported the extension
because the proposal is ``not an expansion'' of the legalization
program. It ``does nothing to increase the number of eligible
people to be found,'' he said.
   An opponent, Rep. Harold Rogers, R-Ky., said the proposal will
``do violence'' to a ``delicately balanced, finely tuned piece of
work.''
   ``We begged people to fill out the papers and seek legalization.
How much longer do you want to beg people'' to apply? ``Enough is
enough,'' he said.
   Before the final vote, the House approved by voice vote an
amendment that designed to cut down on fraud during the extension
period.
   Sponsored by Rep. Clay Shaw, R-Fla., the language would permit
the INS to use any documents found to be fraudulent during the
extension period in deportation proceedings.
   The House also defeated an amendment that would have only
accepted applications after May 4 from aliens who could demonstrate
``good cause'' for missing the deadline.
   The proposal by Rep. George Gekas, R-Pa., which would have
included health or logistical reasons as ``good cause,'' was
defeated 167-246.

   Broadcast executive Ted Turner pleaded
no contest to illegally importing wild mountain lions and was fined
$1,500 and ordered to produce public service announcements for two
wildlife groups.
   Turner, 49, entered the plea Tuesday in Jefferson County Court
to three counts of importing the animals to his plantation near
here without a permit. The offense carries a maximum penalty of a
$500 fine and 60 days in jail.
   Judge Felix Johnston ordered him to pay $750 each to two
wildlife groups and to produce one-minute public service
announcements for the groups at his own expense.
   The charges were filed last month after one of the lions brought
from a plantation in South Carolina was hit by a vehicle on
Interstate 10.

<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rival Tamil rebel factions clashed in
northern and eastern Sri Lanka, leaving 38 people dead in two days,
Sri Lankan military officials said Wednesday.
   Killed were 20 members of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam
and 16 members of the Eelam Revolutionary Organization of Students,
officials said. Two relatives of a rebel, one of them a 70-year-old
Tamil man, also died, they said.
   A senior military official said Wednesday that the separatist
groups, once allies, ``have been locked in mortal combat for the
last 24 hours.''
   ``Both groups are hell-bent on liquidating each other. We don't
know why,'' he added.
   The Sri Lankan military officials also said 27 Tamil Tigers were
killed Tuesday by Indian troops near Vavuniya, 100 miles north of
Colombo, but an Indian diplomat said she could not confirm the
account.
   ``We have absolutely no such reports,'' the spokeswoman for the
Indian Embassy said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The Tigers are the largest Tamil rebel group. Four years ago
they began a war against Sri Lanka's Sinhalese majority in which
more than 8,000 people have died.
   Tamils, who make up about 18 percent of Sri Lanka's population,
say the Sinhalese discriminate against them in jobs and education.
   Moderate Tamils want more autonomy for their communites in the
north and east of Sri Lanka, where they predominate, while
militants are fighting for a separate nation.
   India has sent more than 50,000 soldiers to Sri Lanka to enforce
a peace accord and is trying to disarm the rebels.
   The Sinhalese, who make up 75 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million
people, control the government and the military.
   The Sri Lankan officials, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the latest violence between the Tamil Tigers and the student
group began on Tuesday.
   They said Tiger gunmen raided a house in Pungundutivu in the
Jaffna peninsula, about 190 miles north of Colombo, killing eight
rival guerrillas and the grandfather and son-in-law of a rebel.
   Later in the day, the Tigers killed eight sleeping members of
the rival group at Mankulam village, 15 miles southwest of
Vavuniya, the officials said.
   On Wednesday, the Eelam Revolutionary Organization of Students
retaliated by ambushing and killing 20 Tigers riding in a truck at
Mutur, about 140 miles northeast of Colombo.

<HEAD>Gorbachev Discusses Party Conference with Regional Leaders</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mikhail S. Gorbachev called regional Communist
Party leaders to Moscow to discuss an unusual party conference in
June, Tass said Wednesday. The June conference will give the Soviet
leader a chance to strengthen his hand against opponents. It
affords him the opportunity, between the party congresses that are
held every five years, to change the membership of the
policy-making party Central Committee.
   Gorbachev met party leaders from the Soviet Union's 15
republics, territories and regions in a series of conferences April
11, 14 and 18, the official news agency reported.
   ``The activity of party organizations in giving guidance to
perestroika (restructuring Soviet society) was discussed and there
was a detailed exchange of views on the course of preparations for
the ... conference,'' Tass said.
   ``A thorough analysis was made of proposals related to the need
for perfecting the political system.''
   Gorbachev has said that resistance to his policy of perestroika
extends all the way to the approximately 300 members of the Central
Committee.
   At a Central Committee meeting in February, Gorbachev said one
task of the party conference will be to strengthen the Soviet
political and governmental system to ensure that it is not subject
to the rule of only one person.
   Tass said participants in the three days of conferences with
Gorbachev stressed the need to strengthen his reform effort and
meet targets for priorities such as improving food supplies and
consumer goods.

<HEAD>Missiles Found in Punjab</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Border security forces said Wednesday
that they seized 16 Soviet-made anti-aircraft missiles from a Sikh
hideout in a farmhouse near India's border with Pakistan.
   The discovery Tuesday night followed intelligence reports that
Sikh separatists were preparing to step up guerrilla warfare in
northern Punjab state by acquiring more sophisticated weapons.
   The state has been under federal rule since last May, when Prime
Minister Rajiv Gandhi ousted the Sikh-run state government for
failing to control Sikh extremists. But killings in Punjab have
increased this year.
   A new police chief, K.P.S. Gill, 52, was appointed in Punjab on
Wednesday.
   Intelligence reports had said the Sikh extremists were believed
to have acquired U.S.-made Stinger anti-aircraft missiles, possibly
smuggled from Pakistan. The United States supplied Stingers by way
of Pakistan to Afghan rebels fighting Soviet troops in neighboring
Afghanistan.
   However, the United News of India news agency said the missiles,
discovered in a raid in Punjab's Gurdaspur District, were of Soviet
origin. It said they were about five feet long with a range of at
least 1,100 yards. They may have been captured by the Afghan rebels
and sold to Sikhs, police told UNI.
   To date, the extremists have mainly used pistols, automatic
rifles and machine guns. Three recent attacks with rocket-propelled
grenades were reported.
   Sikh militants have waged a guerrilla war since 1982 for more
autonomy or an independent Sikh homeland in Punjab.
   Sikhs, whose religion was founded about 500 years ago as an
alternative to Islam and Hinduism, complain that India's majority
Hindus discriminate against them. Sikhs make up less than 2 percent
of India's 800 million population but are a majority in Punjab.
   UNI reported that Sikh extremists killed five people Tuesday
night and Wednesday, including a militant Sikh political leader
identified as Hira Singh and his 8-year-old son.
   The killings raised to at least 755 the number of deaths blamed
on the extremists so far this year. In all of 1986, about 1,000
people were killed.

<HEAD>Soviet Official Says Climate Being Created for Papal Visit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Tass official said on Wednesday that changing
conditions in the Soviet Union could help lead to a visit by Pope
John Paul II.
   Anatoly A. Krasikov, deputy director general of Tass and a
former Rome correspondent for the official Soviet news agency, was
asked at a news conference if the Soviet government wanted a visit
by the pope.
   ``There are no conditions on either part (for a papal visit) ..
. but `conditions,' in the sense of climate ... is another thing,''
he replied.
   ``I am absolutely sure that this climate is being created.''
   The question of a possible visit by the Roman Catholic leader to
the officially atheist country has been raised in particular
because 1988 is the 1,000th anniversary of the advent of
Christianity in the area now called the Ukraine.
   In a document released on Tuesday, the pope called for religious
freedom for Catholics in the Ukraine. John Paul has often expressed
his wish to go to the Soviet Union but has said he would go there
only if allowed to visit Roman Catholics throughout the country,
including the Ukraine.
   He also wants to be able to visit Lithuania.
   Before taking questions from reporters, Krasikov said he wanted
to talk about important developments in his country.
   ``We are all searching together for truth ... in the
construction of society ... We want more democracy,'' Krasikov
said, reflecting about the Soviet Union under Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   He said that with this point of view, ``freedom of religion is
important.''

<HEAD>NATO Moves Nuclear Planning Meet From Denmark To Brussels</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Next week's meeting of NATO defense
ministers to review nuclear arms issues will be moved from Denmark
to Brussels because of a political crisis in Denmark over nuclear
arms policy, sources said Wednesday.
   They quoted Danish envoy Otto Broch as saying at Wednesday's
weekly session of NATO ambassadors he preferred that the ministers
not hold their April 27-28 meeting in Kolding, Denmark, as
scheduled.
   ``Instead, the meeting will be held in Brussels,'' said one
source.
   The sources spoke on condition of not being identified.
   A Danish official, who also spoke on condition of anonymity,
said the change of venue ``was agreed to in consultation with the
(NATO) secretary- general'' and the other NATO members.
   ``The decision was reached, of course, in light of the election
situation in Denmark.''
   Another source said the NATO envoys expressed ``serious
concern'' about the Danish Parliament's passing a resolution last
week asking the government to tighten its ban on nuclear arms.
   NATO Secretary-General Lord Carrington said in a statement the
resolution, if implemented ``would have serious repercussions and
would run counter ... to NATO strategy.''
   On Tuesday, Prime Minister Poul Schlueter called for early
elections May 10. His minority center-right government opposed the
resolution.
   It requires the government to tell visiting warships they cannot
bring nuclear arms into Danish ports. For 31 years, Denmark has had
a policy of banning nuclear arms from its soil.
   Denmark also does not allow the permanent basing of allied
troops on its territory.
   North Atlantic Treaty Organization officials say the resolution
takes the nuclear ban position too far and is embarrassing to
Denmark's allies.
   The United States and Britain, which would play a key role in
reinforcing Denmark at a time of crisis, as a matter of policy
never confirm or deny their warships carry nuclear arms.
   Carrington's statement said the resolution ``would run counter
to the basis of NATO strategy'' and undermines ``the principles of
shared burdens and benefits.''
   In 1984, New Zealand began insisting that visiting warships
state whether they carried nuclear arms. This led to a cutoff of
its military cooperation with some other nations, including the
United States.
   The NATO defense ministers will meet as the alliance's Nuclear
Planning Group which reviews only nuclear arms issues.
   At the ambassadors meeting, U.S. envoy Alton Keel restated the
Reagan administration's ``deep regret'' over passage of the
resolution, sources said.

   Attorney General Edwin Meese III's choice for
the No. 2 post at the Justice Department withdrew from
consideration Wednesday as Meese struggled to fill top-level posts.
   ``We've only had a very few'' resignations, Meese defiantly told
a Senate subcommittee on Capitol Hill, defending his leadership of
the Justice Department and his personal ethics in the face of a
nearly year-long criminal investigation.
   Sen. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., told the attorney general that the
Justice Department is ``seemingly in disarray,'' and asked: ``Can
you continue on efficiently and effectively under these
circumstances?''
   ``The newspapers don't have it quite right,'' Meese responded.
``There's been considerable exaggeration.''
   John Shepherd, the 62-year-old former American Bar Association
president who Meese hurriedly recommended to the White House April
5 to become deputy attorney general, pulled out in the face of
mounting publicity about an alleged affair with his bookkeeper.
   It also was disclosed that longtime Meese friend E. Robert
Wallach, now under indictment in the Wedtech scandal, had
recommended Shepherd to Meese for a Justice Department post in 1984
or 1985 and that Shepherd belongs to an all-white country club and
an all-male social club.
   Meese told a Senate appropriations subcommittee that he would
appoint an acting deputy while he searches for a replacement to
fill the post. He subsequently told reporters that he did not rule
out the possibility of appointing his counselor, William Bradford
Reynolds.
   A Reynolds appointment would provoke a storm of criticism on
Capitol Hill, where the Senate three years ago rejected Meese's bid
to have Reynolds confirmed as associate attorney general, the No. 3
post in the department.
   Meese refined his remarks later Wednesday afternoon, with
department spokesman Terry Eastland saying that no decision has
been made on whether to appoint an acting deputy.
   Meese told reporters he doesn't think he will have ``any trouble
... at all'' in filling the No. 2 post. But he canceled a trip to
London for a conference on international terrorism at least in part
to try to fill top-level department vacancies, said department
sources, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   ``I am concerned about the personal and financial sacrifices my
family and I were being asked to make in order to accept a very
difficult short-term appointment,'' Shepherd said in a statement.
   ``My wife and I were not prepared for the pressures to which
someone recommended for this position at this time would be
subject,'' Shepherd added.
   Meese was asked about the management problems at a Capitol Hill
hearing that also focused on conflict-of-interest allegations
against him.
   The Associated Press reported last week that the Justice
Department signed a $50 million lease on the building owned in part
by Howard M. Bender after his family's foundation routed money to
the Multiple Sclerosis Society for Mrs. Meese's $40,000-a-year job.
   Meese reiterated that there was no connection between the lease
and Mrs. Meese's job and called the story an ``outrageous and
scurrilous attack.'' He said an attempt to discredit him through
his wife was ``the lowest form of journalism.''
   Meese said the Benders made a charitable contribution and did
not pay Mrs. Meese's salary.
   James Bierbower, the society's attorney, told the AP that Mrs.
Meese was hired only after the Bender Foundation made available
$40,000 for a development director for Operation Job Match, a
program that finds positions for handicapped people.
   Bierbower said MS officials and trustees decided in late 1985 to
hire a development director for the job match program. Mrs. Meese
was the person whom MS officials wanted to fill the position, he
said.
   ``Thereafter, the officers were able to make arrangements ...
that the Bender Foundation would fund the position for 1986 with a
$40,000 grant and that Mrs. Meese would be hired as development
director,'' he said.
   The MS society successfully solicited an additional $40,000
grant from the Bender Foundation to keep Mrs. Meese on the payroll
in 1987. The society has a commitment from the foundation to pay
$40,000 in 1988 for her salary, but the check has yet to be
received, he said.
   In comments to reporters, Meese blamed Shepherd's withdrawal on
the news media, saying that it was due to ``all of the raking
over'' and the ``false allegation'' concerning the bookkeeper.
   Meanwhile, The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported Wednesday that
the woman, Denise Sinner, made up nearly every portion of her
background. Ms. Sinner told investigators and employers about
attending college, having terminal cancer and performing well in
past jobs. But people interviewed by the newspaper, including
Sinner's former husband, said she had lied.
   Sinner was convicted in March of stealing nearly $147,000 from
Shepherd's law firm. Sinner claimed she had had an affair with
Shepherd and that he had told her to write checks on the firm's
account for her personal use.
   Shepherd testified during the trial that all her accusations
were lies.
   Meese said ``the intense media attention'' had a ``severe
personal impact'' on Shepherd and his family.
   All the adverse information was previously known to the White
House and the Justice Department and ``there is nothing whatsoever
to suggest that Mr. Shepherd would have had any confirmation
problems,'' Meese said in a statement.
   Shepherd, who hadn't been nominated yet by President Reagan and
whose selection by Meese was announced prior to normal White House
clearance procedures and FBI background checks, would have replaced
Deputy Attorney General Arnold Burns, whose last day at the
department is Friday.
   Burns and criminal division chief William Weld resigned in
protest March 29 out of concern that the nearly year-long criminal
investigation of Meese was hurting the Justice Department's
operations, morale and public image.
   At the Senate hearing, Meese also was forced to rebut
suggestions by Sen. Warren Rudman of New Hampshire, ranking
Republican on the subcommittee that handles Justice Department
appropriations, that Meese should have a higher level of ethical
sensitivity.
   In a probe that began last May 11, independent counsel James
McKay has been investigating Meese's ties to scandal-plagued
Wedtech Corp. and a $1 billion Iraqi oil pipeline project. Wallach
represented Wedtech and a partner in the proposed pipeline.
   ``There was no such hint, no such suggestion and no such
suspicion, no such basis for the most sensitive person to reach ...
conclusions'' that there would be any appearance of impropriety,
responded Meese. McKay's probe of Meese's activities is continuing.
   Five of Burns' six deputies have now resigned, leaving the No. 2
office at the department virtually vacant.
   The No. 3 office in the department also is nearly vacant with
the departure last Friday of Stephen Trott to become a federal
appeals court judge. All but one of his deputies also have left.
   While it is customary for aides to top-level appointees to
depart when the boss leaves, aides to Meese had asked three
deputies to Burns to stay on following the abrupt resignations of
the deputy attorney general and Weld, department sources said.
   Shepherd was Meese's second choice to take Burns' place. The
attorney general was rebuffed by Philadelphia lawyer and former
federal judge Arlin Adams, who said earlier this month that he had
a heavy caseload at his law firm and pointed out that he had just
joined the firm last year.

   Presidential contender Sen. Albert Gore Jr.
ran up a debt of $1.6 million before the New York primary where the
fruits of his spending reaped only 10 percent of the vote this
week, his financial statement showed Wednesday.
   Gore has lost his eligibility for federal matching funds and
would need to attain an unlikely 20 percent of the vote in
Pennsylvania's primary next week in order to restablish his
eligibility.
   However, if he drops out of the race, he would be able to
receive federal matching funds to retire the debt, under election
law.
   On the Republican side of the presidential race, former TV
evangelist Pat Robertson continued to borrow heavily to keep his
campaign afloat, but since he is bumping up against the spending
limit he has had to dramatically scale back his massive campaign
operation, his campaign report showed Wednesday.
   Robertson spent $7.8 million during March alone just repaying
some of his previous bank loans.
   Robertson technically remains a candidate but has conceded that
Vice President George Bush will win the nomination.
   Gore, who was expected to suspend his campaign Thursday,
personally loaned his campaign $40,000 and took out bank loans of
$1.4 million during March, according to his campaign finance report
filed with the Federal Election Commission.
   Most of that was for the Super Tuesday series of primaries in 20
states on March 8.
   Meanwhile, Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, who established
himself in New York as the clear frontrunner, is continuing his
flush financial status, his report shows.
   And the other Democrat still in the race, Jesse Jackson, raised
$2.8 million in his biggest fund-raising month ever. That included
$2 million from contributors, $330,189 in federal matching funds,
and a $250,000 loan.
   Jackson ended the month with $865,946 in cash on hand, a
outstanding bills of $678,973.
   Dukakis had burst in fund-raising in March, with $3.4 million in
total receipts, and ended the month with $1.7 million in cash on
hand to cover $697,162 in bills and to propel him into the costly
New York race.
   Dukakis' receipts included $621,098 in federal matching funds.
The $2.4 million he got from contributors was up from his February
total of $1.3 million in donations.
   Gore also had a substantial fund-raising month in March, taking
in $3.4 million, of which $336,312 was matching funds and $1.2
million came from contributions.
   He ended the month with a debt of $1.6 million, with only
$416,603 in cash on hand. His aides had said he would need no
additional loans to spend $1 million on a costly New York media
campaign, but aides subsequently disclosed that he borrowed at
least $100,000.
   Bush is effectively finished with fund raising, having raised
the maximum $27 million that election law permits primary
candidates to spend. During March, he raised $1.7 million, of which
$247,118 was in the form of federal matching funds.
   He ended the month with $3.6 million in the bank and close to $1
million in outstanding obligations. At the end of March he had
spent $18.9 million against the base spending cap of $23 million,
plus the maximum $4.6 million allowed for fund-raising expenses.
   Bush's treasurer Fred Bush said earlier this month that overall
fund raising for the campaign had hit $30 million. That included $3
million for legal and accounting costs, which are not subject to
the spending limit.
   Robertson was already within $2 million of the spending ceiling
as of Super Tuesday.
   In his new report covering the month of March, he reported
raising $2.3 million, of which $896,551 were federal matching
funds, and $873,444 was money from contributors. By the end of
March he had spent $20 million against the $23 million base cap,
plus the full $4.6 million fund-raising allocation, his report
showed.
   Robertson ended March with $1.4 million in debts and only
$61,890 in cash on hand.
   He personally loaned his campaign $25,000, and took out $385,000
in bank loans. He spent $7.8 million paying off previous loans.
   GOP contender Jack Kemp, the congressman from New York, who
dropped out of the race during March, is still in debt. He ended
the month $672,826 in the red, but was anticipating more than
$500,000 in federal matching funds to help retire that. He had only
$57,741 in the bank, after raising $604,586 during the month.

   Jesse Jackson, showing strength in some
of Vermont's smallest, most rural communities, finished first
Wednesday in an unofficial count of Democratic state delegates
elected in local caucuses.
   With all of the state's communities reporting results from
Tuesday night's caucuses, an unofficial count by The Associated
Press gave Jackson 589 state convention delegates, compared with
581 for Michael Dukakis. There were 116 uncommitted delegates
elected, while Sen. Albert Gore picked up four delegates.
   The AP count showed the race so close that the official party
tabulation, expected next week, could place either Jackson or
Dukakis out front.
   Jackson bested Dukakis, the governor of neighboring
Massachusetts, in Vermont's largest city of Burlington, and he won
in many of the state's smallest, most rural communities.
   The delegates elected Tuesday night will attend next month's
state convention, at which time 14 of Vermont's 19 delegates to the
national convention will be chosen. The remaining five spots belong
to Gov. Madeleine Kunin, a Dukakis backer, and four state party
officials, all but one of whom are likely to support Dukakis.
   The town-by-town returns showed that, with the exception of
Burlington, Dukakis did best in the larger communities while
Jackson picked up delegates in the smallest towns.
   ``It's a tremendous victory for us,'' said Liz Blum, the Jackson
state coordinator.
   ``We would sure like to have 10 more votes,'' said William
Wasserman, the Dukakis state coordinator. ``We knew it would be
close.''
   ``We have a very high regard for the excellent field work the
Jackson campaign did,'' said Wasserman. ``They organized in the
smallest of communities, as well as the larger ones. That showed
real persistence, real dedication to detail.''
   Dukakis had won Vermont's presidential primary March 1, winning
56 percent of the vote, while Jackson gained 26 percent. But the
primary was non-binding and had nothing to do with the selection of
delegates.

   The Supreme Court said Wednesday the
government may continue viewing alcoholism as ``willful
misconduct'' rather than an uncontrollable disease when awarding
veterans education benefits.
   But the justices did not attempt to decide whether alcoholism is
a disease, noting that the medical community remains sharply
divided on that issue.
   Instead, the 4-3 decision said the Veterans Administration did
not violate a law protecting the rights of the handicapped when it
refused to extend education benefits to two men for more than 10
years after they left the service.
   The two men said they failed to apply earlier for the GI
benefits because they were disabled by their alcoholism.
   Wednesday's ruling is not expected to affect veterans medical
benefits. The VA provides medical benefits to help ex-GIs recover
from alcoholism without imposing any time limit.
   In another ruling Wednesday, the court upheld, 7-1, a law
requiring municipal or state bonds issued after June 30, 1983, to
be registered before they can be tax-exempt.
   The justices ruled that the federal law enacted to discourage
tax evasion in the trading of municipal bonds does not violate any
state's sovereign immunity.
   South Carolina had challenged the law, with more than half the
states supporting it. South Carolina argued that the law will hurt
state and local governments by forcing them to chose between
continuing to issue unregistered bonds for which investors will
have their interest taxed or paying sizeable registration fees.
   The law, which took effect July 1, 1983, is aimed in part at
discouraging tax evasion when bonds change hands as gifts or are
passed on to an heir. While the interest on government bonds is
exempt from federal income tax, the bonds are taxed as gifts or as
part of an estate.
   State and local governments issue bonds to finance various
projects such as building roads and schools.
   Groups that help alcoholics said they were disappointed by the
court's ruling in the veterans' case, while suggesting its impact
may be limited.
   Christine Lubinski of the National Council on Alcoholism said,
``Certainly, this is a blow to us, and to morale. However ... we
feel the state of the art in terms of both public awareness about
alcoholism as well as the successful treatment of alcoholism will
prevail.''
   The decision was welcomed by Norma Phillips, president of
Mothers Against Drunk Driving. She said it might encourage judges
to give tougher sentences in drunken-driving cases even though that
was not even indirectly an issue in the case.
   In other decisions, the court:
   _Ruled 8-0 in a Florida case that unions may distribute
handbills urging consumers to boycott ``neutral employers'' against
whom the unions have no grievance.
   _Ruled by a 6-2 vote in a California case that forcing employers
to provide free, internal mail delivery for labor union literature
aimed at organizing employees does not violate the federal law
giving the U.S. Postal Service a monopoly.
   Justice Byron R. White, writing for the court in the alcoholism
ruling, said the federal Rehabilitation Act of 1973 does not force
the VA to treat alcoholism as a disease.
   The law bars federal programs or anyone receiving federal aid
from discriminating against handicapped individuals solely because
of their handicap.
   ``In our view, it is by no means clear that (the law) and the
characterization of primary alcoholism as a willfully incurred
disability are in irreconciliable conflict,'' White said.
   Those who believe there is a conflict should ask Congress to
change the law, he said.
   Justice Harry A. Blackmun, in a dissenting opinion, said the VA
should examine benefit claims by veterans on an individual basis
rather than concluding automatically that the condition is a
product of willful misconduct.
   ``This is the very kind of broad social generalization that the
Rehabilitation Act is intended to eliminate,'' he said. ``The
petitioners in these cases ask only that their situations be given
individualized evaluation.''
   Seeking VA education benefits were Eugene Traynor, 46, a
supervisor in a New York City photography laboratory, and James P.
McKelvey, 42, an alcoholism counselor in Rockville, Md.
   Both men, who said they began drinking when they were children,
received honorable discharges from the Army in the late 1960s. They
said they took their last drinks in the early 1970s before being
hospitalized and treated for the condition.
   The VA authorizes payment of education benefits to veterans
within 10 years of their discharge. No benefits are paid after 10
years unless a veteran can show he or she was unable to pursue an
education ``because of a physical or mental disability which was
not the result of such veteran's own willful misconduct.''
   The VA provides an exemption from the 10-year time limit for
alcoholism only when it is a secondary symptom of some other
psychiatric disorder.
   Traynor and McKelvey sued the VA, charging the agency with
discriminating illegally against the handicapped.
   Federal appeals courts ruled against them in separate decisions.
   McKelvey said the Wednesday ruling sends an unfortunate message
to people fighting alcoholism.
   ``I believe that the justices who ruled in favor of the
Veteran's Administration are giving them a license to kill, more or
less,'' McKelvey said. ``They're saying that the Veteran's
Administration can violate existing federal statutes and get away
with it.''
   The cases attracted widespread attention because of the current
renewed debate over the nature of alcoholism. Many programs have
developed in recent years that treat alcoholics as victims of a
disease rather than as social deviants or criminals.
   The psychiatric profession's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual
of Mental Disorders calls alcohol abuse and dependence a disease,
and says about 13 percent of all Americans suffer from it at some
point in their lives.
   Joining White in ruling for the VA were Chief Justice William H.
Rehnquist and Justices John Paul Stevens and Sandra Day O'Connor.
Blackmun was joined in dissent by Justices William J. Brennan and
Thurgood Marshall. Justices Antonin Scalia and Anthony M. Kennedy
did not participate in the case.

   A former San Diego police
lieutenant who once testified against a fellow officer claimed on
Wednesday to have been tied up and shot by intruders in his home,
but ex-colleagues suggested he staged the attack.
   Doyle F. Wheeler was treated at a hospital and released Tuesday
after authorities found him at home with a gunshot wound, said
Stevens County Sheriff Richard Andres. The shot grazed his head,
Andres said.
   Wheeler said he was attacked by three men.
   ``He (Wheeler) reported that someone tried to kill him, but
there was only a graze wound and powder burn,'' San Diego Police
Chief Bob Burgreen told the San Diego Tribune. ``He was handcuffed,
tied up and had to dial 911 with his tongue. I find all of this
very interesting.''
   ``It was absolutely physically impossible for me to do it to
myself,'' Wheeler said. ``It is impossible to hogtie and shoot
yourself.''
   Local authorities have refused to release details about the
shooting and have declined comment on any connection to Wheeler's
testimony on behalf of Sagon Penn, who was acquitted of murder and
attempted murder in the 1985 shooting of two San Diego police
officers.
   Wheeler testified the 1985 shooting was a racially motivated
attack provoked by the white officers. Penn is black.
   Neighbors on Tuesday reported seeing Wheeler's car being driven
away from his home about the time the shooting occurred. However,
they said they did not see who was driving or how many people were
in the car, which is missing.
   ``They intended to kill me and they thought they killed me,''
Wheeler told the Spokane Chronicle on Wednesday. ``I am afraid for
my life. I have my family in a safe place and I will be joining
them.''
   The incident ``makes no sense,'' Harry O. Eastus II, a police
officer and director of the San Diego Police Officers Association,
told the San Diego Tribune on Wednesday. The association is the
officers' union.
   ``Based on (Wheeler's) past performance, there is a strong
likelihood that he could have done that to himself or paid sombody
to do it,'' Eastus said.
   Wheeler, who was a member of the San Diego force on and off for
about 10 years, left the department briefly in 1977 on
stress-related disability, San Diego police said. He retired on
stress disability in 1985, police said.
   Paul Sands, news director for KGTV in San Diego, said Wheeler
had called station anchorman Michael Tuck two weeks ago to report
threats against his life and Tuck's. Tuck had plans for a TV movie
about the Penn case.
   The San Diego Tribune quoted Tuck as saying Wheeler warned him
that a member of the San Diego Police Department told him that
officers planned to kill Tuck and Wheeler.
   The sheriff said investigators had sent evidence from the
Wheeler home to a Spokane crime lab for analysis.

   Hijackers with ``eyes of sharks'' wiped
out their fingerprints and slipped away Wednesday, leaving 31
hostages to stumble from a Kuwaiti jumbo jet that was a prison of
fear, brutality and death for 15 days.
   The Shiite Moslem gunmen had murdered two passengers since
hijacking the Kuwait Airways Flight 422, with 112 people aboard, on
April 5 between Bangkok and the Persian Gulf sheikdom.
   They agreed to free their remaining hostages after arranging
safe passage with Algerian officials who mediated a settlement. The
hijackers had demanded that Kuwait free 17 pro-Iranians convicted
and imprisoned for bombing the U.S. and French embassies in
December 1983.
   Among the passengers on the Boeing 747 were three cousins of the
Kuwaiti ruler, Sheik Jaber Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah.
   Kuwait's official news agency KUNA, citing Algerian sources it
did not identify, said ``five hijackers left the plane, then about
10 minutes later, four other pirates left the plane. Following that
the hostages came out'' at 6 a.m. _ three hours into the 16th day
of the hijacking. The number of hijackers had previously been
estimated at seven or eight.
   According to the agency, the hijackers were assured safe passage
to either Beirut or Tehran.
   NBC News reported Wednesday that U.S. officials believe the
Algerians provided the hijackers with letters or tapes from the 17
prisoners in Kuwait so friends and relatives could see the
prisoners had not been harmed.
   A U.S. official in Washington said efforts were made during the
Algerian negotiations to assure the hijackers the 17 were not being
mistreated. The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
it was not known if the Algerians gave the hijackers letters or
tapes.
   A Soviet-built transport plane belonging to the Algerian air
force took off shortly before dawn. It is rare for military
aircraft to use the civilian Houari Boumedienne airport and there
was speculation some or all the hijackers were aboard.
   Algerian officials would not discuss the flight or its
occupants. KUNA quoted Mohammed Taher, a member of the Algerian
negotiating team, as saying without elaboration that the hijackers
were ``still here.''
   Interior Minister Hedi Khediri, who led the Algerian mediators,
announced the drama's end without giving details and said the fate
of the hijackers was the ``concern of Algeria'' alone.
   Floodlights had bathed the blue-and-white jet nightly since it
landed in the North African capital on April 13, but were
extinguished at 9 p.m. Tuesday. They never came back on, making it
difficult for reporters to detect movement in the area.
   After the plane was seized over the Indian Ocean, it was
diverted to Mashhad, Iran, where the terrorists released 57
hostages. Freed passengers said they believed more gunmen boarded
at Mashhad with submachine guns and dynamite that was wired to the
plane's doors later.
   After three days in Mashhad, the hijackers tried to take the
plane to Beirut but the airport there would not permit it to land.
The jet ran low on fuel and Larnaca, Cyprus, agreed to accept it.
   During five days in Larnaca, the hijackers beat two Kuwaiti
security men, shot them to death and dumped their bodies from the
aircraft. They let 13 more hostages go in exchange for fuel, which
brought them to Algiers.
   The hostages trembled as they emerged from the plane in the
darkness Wednesday morning.
   First to descend were Anware and Ibtesam Al-Sabah, second
cousins of the Kuwaiti emir and the only two women left aboard. The
women wore thick black veils.
   They were taken to an Algiers clinic in an ambulance with their
brother, Fadel Khaled Al-Sabah, who suffered from a nervous
disorder, a doctor said.
   Algerian authorities said none of the three was hurt.
   Tadar el-Kebi, a 31-year-old businessman, said he saw the
hijackers going through the plane trying to wipe out their
fingerprints at about 4 a.m., ``the first indication I had that our
release was imminent.''
   Abdel Monem Mahmoud, an Egyptian who was the plane's purser,
said the worst time was ``when they put a gun to the head of one of
the passengers. Their eyes behind their masks were sharp and
expressionless like those of a shark.''
   The Algerian negotiators did not indicate what persuaded the
hijackers to abandon their effort. The Kuwaiti news agency said the
crisis ended ``without any deal'' but there were reports that
Kuwait agreed to commute the sentences of the three men among the
17 who have been sentenced to death.
   A Kuwaiti official in Algiers, speaking on condition of
anonymity, noted that the death sentences had not been carried out.
He said he believed an understanding with the emir may have been
achieved that would result in the sentences being commuted to life
in prison.
   Half an hour before the passengers appeared in the plane's
first-class doorway, Interior Minister Khediri broadcast a
statement that ``Algerian mediation has helped to find a solution
to all questions linked to the hijacking of the Kuwaiti plane.''
   He said, giving no details, that a deal was worked out with
Kuwait and any attempt by third parties to obstruct it would be
``counterproductive.''
   The warning appeared to be aimed at foreign governments,
including the United States.
   Washington has said consistently that hijackers should not go
free.

<TEXT>
   A man who unsuccessfully challenged the mass internment of
Japanese-Americans during World War II said Wednesday's Senate
approval of reparations represented a rare opportunity to right an
old wrong.
   The Senate approved a bill Wednesday calling for the government
to apologize for the mass roundups and making each of the estimated
60,000 survivors eligible for $20,000 payments. The House passed a
similar bill.
   About 120,000 Japanese-Americans were forced to give up their
homes and businesses and were put in internment camps after Japan
attacked Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, on Dec. 7, 1941.
   ``The country doesn't have too many opportunities to redress
something,'' Gordon Hirabayashi said in a telephone interview from
Edmonton, Canada.
   ``When it does, I think we should take that opportunity and look
to the future to keep the honor of our country inviolable. I think
that result would be the finishing touch to what the
Japanese-Americans hope that their tragedy will contribute to.''
   Hirabayashi, then a 23-year-old student in Seattle, was arrested
in 1942 after refusing to abide by an 8 p.m.-to-6 a.m. curfew or
report to a civilian control center, the first step toward
placement in an internment camp.
   Constitutional challenges by him and two other
Japanese-Americans to the internment orders resulted in Supreme
Court rulings in 1943 and 1944 upholding the relocation as an
emergency military measure.
   Last September, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals wiped
Hirabayashi's convictions off the books, ruling that the government
had suppressed evidence that the mass imprisonment was ordered for
racial rather than military reasons.
   The government has not appealed the ruling, but Hirabayashi said
his lawyers have asked the Supreme Court to take up the case anyway
so the high court's previous decision can be removed from the
records.
   In Seattle, Cherry Kinoshita rejoiced in the Senate vote 46
years after she was uprooted from her home and sent to a camp in
Idaho.
   ``Pleased would be an understatement,'' she said. ``We've been
working for over 10 years to see this happen. I think it's great to
see our nation admit an error, and take steps to remedy what was a
great injustice.''
   Ms. Kinoshita, who was 18 when she went with her family to the
camp at Minidoka, Idaho, was one of many Japanese-Americans who
worked to convince the government that internment defied the
Constitution and was a racist.
   ``We hope this will acknowledge that this was a tragic travesty
of justice, and that with this legislation we can hope that it will
never, ever recur again to another group,'' she said.
   Sam Shoji, 62, of Seattle, a social worker for the Veterans
Administration who was incarcerated for 13 months, said the money
was ``only a token ... but at least it is there.''
   ``It was basically a concentration camp,'' said Shoji.
   The issue took a long time to be resolved because of the shame
the Japanese-Americans felt at being locked up and the federal
government's willingness to bury the matter, Hirabayashi said.
   ``In this case, the victims were so traumatized by this
experience that they had not recovered enough to talk about until a
decade or so ago,'' he said.
   ``There was nothing in the history books,'' he said. ``Now the
situation is different. We have to take some kind of historical
perspective on this. Forty years is not all that long.''

<HEAD>Former Hart Press Secretary Admits Lying</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gary Hart's former press secretary says he
told two lies, both last May when the candidate's White House bid
was collapsing.
   Kevin Sweeney made the admission in a review in Wednesday's San
Francisco Examiner of ``Speaking Out, Inside the Reagan White
House'' by Larry Speakes, the former White House spokesman who
admitted fabricating quotes for Reagan.
   ``I told two lies, both last May when Hart's original 1988
campaign crumbled to its apparent end,'' wrote Sweeney.
   Sweeney, Hart's press secretary from 1985 to May 1987, when Hart
temporarily pulled out of the race for the Democratic presidential
nomination, said he lied when he told a Washington Post reporter
that Hart was asleep.
   ``I was trying to buy time after being told yet another
potentially fatal revelation,'' he said.
   He said he lied again when he emphatically denied to an ABC
reporter who called at 4 a.m. that Hart's campaign was about to end.
   ``I was trying to protect the Harts' privacy as they left for
home,'' he said.
   Sweeney, who lives in San Bruno south of San Francisco, said
that because the campaign was ending, he no longer cared about his
credibility.
   He added that during his tenure he also told ``tiny lies'' on
those occasions when he said he thought Hart had done well when he
in fact he hadn't.
   ``My substantive lies I regret, my subjective lies I do not,''
said Sweeney. ``But since my first day as press secretary, the
steps away from the absolute truth (be they small or large)
constantly presented themselves as the single greatest ethical
dilemma in my life.''
   ``Frankly most press secretaries are liars,'' he said.
   Speakes, in his book, admitted twice attributing to Reagan
quotes he never made.
   In once instance, he quoted Reagan as telling Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev during the 1985 summit: ``There is much that
divides us, but I believe the world breathes easier because we are
talking here together.''

   Thirty-one supporters of the governing
Democratic Justice Party being held hostage by political opponents
were released early Thursday after police agreed to investigate a
violent election campaign clash.
   Backers of the rival Party for Peace and Democracy freed the
Democratic Justice supporters in the southern city of Youngam about
125 miles south of Seoul. The city is a stronghold of opposition
leader Kim Dae-jung.
   Clashes between rival groups on Wednesday in the cities of
Masan, Jungju, Kohung and Andong injured 33 people.
   Police, who worked out a deal to get the hostages released, then
began arresting some Peace and Democracy members.
   Angry opposition supporters marched on a local police station
and riot police fired tear gas. Police said at least seven people
were arrested.
   Earlier reports said that 30 party members were being held.
   Violence and clashes between rival party supporters has flared
in various parts of South Korea during the race for next Tuesday's
National Assembly elections. The Democratic Justice Party is
fighting to retain its majority in the legislature.
   Prime Minister Lee Hyun-jae ordered a crackdown Wednesday on
election violence and said the government would not tolerate
disorder by any party.
   About 600 police had surrounded the three-story opposition
building in Youngam before the crisis ended.
   The two rival groups had fought over campaigning for their
candidates, who locked in a close race in the area. Thew trouble
apparently began over the handing out of campaign leaflets.
   Press reports, quoting police, said the opposition supporters
stripped the captives and painted their bodies red.
   Youngam is located in South Cholla, Kim Dae-jung's home
province. Anti-government sentiment in the area is relatively high.
   The April 26 assembly elections are the first test of public
confidence in the government of President Roh Tae-woo, who won the
presidential election in December and took office Feb. 25.
   Corruption, violence and government neutrality are among major
campaign issues hotly debated.
   Chae Moon-shik, leader of the Democratic Justice Party, urged
the public to support his party in the assembly elections to help
Roh carry out his democratic reforms.
   Roh's party is expected to win a majority of seats in the
299-member assembly because the opposition is divided, but Kim
Dae-jung of the opposition Party for Peace Democracy has accused
the Democratic Justice Party of trying to rig the elections.
   Hyundai Motor Co., South Korea's leading carmaker, began to feel
the pinch of growing labor unrest and thousands of people were
marooned as ferryboat crews continued the second day of a strike
for higher wages.
   Hyundai was forced by strikes at subcontracted parts plants to
halt production of heavy-duty trucks until Tuesday of next week,
idling 300 workers.
   ``The decision may be extended unless the situation at our parts
plants is improved,'' one Hyundai official told the Associated
Press by telephone.
   Hyundai said its passenger car production and marketing will not
be affected. Hyundai plans to sell 680,000 passenger cars this year.
   Daewoo Motors Co., the nation's No. 2 carmaker, remained closed
for the ninth day on Wednesday with no settlement in sight.
   Authorities in Mokpo, 180 miles southwest of Seoul, mobilized 15
hospital and other public ships Wednesday to transport thousands
stranded by a strike by coastal ferryboat crews.
   ``Some 5,000 people went home today, but there still are several
thousand people stranded here,'' said a maritime official in Mokpo
who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   About 150 crewmen of 30 ferryboats that run between Mokpo and 15
coastal islands went on strike Tuesday, demanding wage increases of
up to 35 percent. Initial labor-management talks broke down.
   Government figures show of 377 labor disputes this year, 80
continued Wednesday involving an estimated 25,000 workers.

   Israel mourned its war dead Wednesday and then,
after sundown, celebrated its 40th birthday with a military show,
barbecues and dancing in the streets.
   Memorial Day, during which Israelis honor the 16,450 soldiers
killed in seven wars and in clashes with Arab guerrillas, ran from
sundown Tuesday until sundown Wednesday, followed by the 24-hour
Independence Day celebration.
   Festivities this year were tempered by anxiety over more than
four months of Arab rebellion in the occupied lands.
   Authorities suspended travel to Israel by the 1.5 million
Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip through the
weekend to prevent terrorist attacks.
   In a special Independence Day message aimed at an Arab audience,
President Chaim Herzog called on Palestinians to end anti-Israeli
protests and said they were being misled by leaders making
unrealistic promises.
   ``The hope of the Palestinians does not lie in the hapless
attempt to defeat Israel, but in acceptance, compromise and
co-existence,'' he said. His remarks, read in Hebrew but peppered
with Arabic phrases, were broadcast on Israel's Arabic-language
television.
   In a separate address aimed at a Jewish audience, Herzog
emphasized Israel's achievements, adding that ``the clouds which
overcast Israel's skies in the 40th year of its independence are
passing clouds.''
   Israel gained its independence on May 14, 1948, and the
celebration Wednesday coincided with the date on the Hebrew
calendar.
   Mourning and celebration are coupled each year ``so that our
children are aware of the sacrifice that went behind the joy of our
independence,'' teacher Ruth Dafnai told a reporter as her sixth
graders put flowers on graves at the Mount Herzl cemetery in
Jerusalem.
   Israeli leaders planned many festivities for the 40th
anniversary, with a nostalgic theme.
   Hikes were scheduled for Thursday along routes taken by
pre-state Jewish fighters. Israel's Declaration of Independence is
on display at the parliament building.
   A highlight of the holiday Wednesday evening was the nation's
first mass public display of armaments since a military parade in
1973. It included parachute jumps, fighter jets, tanks and
fireworks.
   Israel has avoided displaying its military might in the past,
preferring not to emphasize the role of wars in its short history.
   Teachers say Independence and Memorial Day ceremonies at schools
help prepare children for military duty.
   Army service is a central part of life in Israel, where
18-year-old Jewish men serve three years of compulsory duty
followed by at least 40 days a year in the reserves until age 54.
   At Denmark High School in Jerusalem, bereaved parents lectured
in classrooms Wednesday and pupils saluted those killed in combat
and in training accidents.
   Cyrus Weiler, 81, who immigrated from the Soviet Union 25 years
ago and has lost two sons in battle, urged 50 high school juniors
to learn from his children's example of sacrifice.
   ``Everyone has to defend our homeland,'' he said. ``If you
continue in this path of helping the country, there will be value
to your life.''
   Weiler's son Adam was killed in 1970 during a battle with
Egyptians at the Suez Canal, and Gideon was slain in a Golan
Heights tank battle with Syrians during the 1973 Arab-Israeli war.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and Yitzhak Rabin, the defense
minister, delivered Memorial Day speeches in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv.
   ``We are facing one long war,'' Rabin said. ``In order to live
here as a people and a state we must be strong and ready to defend
ourselves. We know that the first time we lose a war, it will be
our last.''
   Shamir said at another ceremony that ``we reiterate our
determination to defend our homeland,'' and told a group of
American Jewish fund-raisers the Palestinian uprising is not
``demonstrations or sit-ins. It is war.''
   Of soldiers who serve in the occupied territories, the prime
minister said: ``I can tell that they know that what they are doing
now is just as important for the country's future as anything they
have done in the past and we're just as proud of them now as we
were then.''

   A woman who reported seeing a
mysterious ``girl in a polka dot dress'' running from the scene of
Robert F. Kennedy's assassination admitted two weeks later that she
lied, according to newly released files.
   Sandra Serrano, a college student at the time, said she had
confronted the woman on the night of Kennedy's shooting at the
Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles just after midnight June 5, 1968.
   The files, made public Tuesday by state officials, showed that
Miss Serrano first told her story to officers at 4 a.m. that day at
police headquarters in Los Angeles, where she was one of hundreds
of witnesses interviewed.
   Miss Serrano, who said she was chairman of the Youth for Kennedy
chapter in Pasadena, said she had come to hear Kennedy speak but
left the hotel ballroom because it was too crowded.
   She said that as she sat on a step outside she heard shots or
backfire and ``about half a minute later this girl comes tearing
down the stairs saying _ she said, `We shot him. We shot him.' And
I said, `Who did you shoot?' And she said, `Senator Kennedy.'''
   She said the girl was in a white dress with dark polka dots.
   She stood by her story for a time and even went with police to
the Ambassador Hotel for a re-enactment, the file showed. But on
June 20, 1968, when told she had failed a lie-detector test, she
declared, ``The whole thing was a lie.''
   Asked by Police Sgt. Enrique Hernandez why she had not corrected
the story sooner, she said: ``I didn't want to look like a fool,
which I look like now. You know, I thought I was supposed to see
more _ more than I did.''
   The following day, June 21, police canceled an all-points
bulletin for the girl in the polka-dot dress, but the story did not
die.
   When the Kennedy files were released Tuesday, among the items on
display in a glass case was a black and white polka dot dress
police had bought to try to jog the memories of witnesses who might
have seen the mystery woman.

<TEXT>
   The General Assembly voted Wednesday
to revoke a state of emergency imposed a month ago after an
abortive coup against the country's de facto ruler, Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega.
   The move was announced in a local television broadcast which
said the Assembly had acted at the request of civilian President
Manuel Solis Palma.
   There was no immediate comment from the government.
   Technically called a ``state of urgency'' by Panama's
Constitution, the action permitted the government to suspend a wide
range of civil liberties, including freedom of speech and assembly
and the right to private property.
   The government invoked the decree on March 18, two days after
dissident officers tried to remove Noriega as head of Panama's
Defense Forces.
   Earlier Wednesday, a U.S. official said that four high-ranking
Panamanian military officers will attend a seminar at Fort McNair
near Washington next week.
   The official, who spoke on condition that he not be identified,
said the four would participate in a course at the Inter-American
Defense College.
   The seminar will bring together officers from several member
nations of the Organization of Amrican States, including those from
Panama.
   The Reagan administration has been using economic pressure to
try to force the ouster of Noriega, head of Panama's Defense
Forces. It has let it be known it would welcome a coup by junior
officers.
   The Panamanians attending the seminar were identified as Col.
Elias Castillo, a ranking member of the Defense Forces; Col. Julio
Ow Young, the nation's police chief; and Majs. Daniel Delgado
Diamante and Arosemena King.
   Delgado is a specialist on the Panama Canal Treaty and King is
the No. 2 man in military intelligence. All four are based at
Defense Forces headquarters in Panama City.
   The 15,000-member Defense Forces includes the military and
police.
   Noriega has been indicted in the United States on
drug-trafficking and money-laundering charges, which he has denied.
   Ranking members of Noriega's staff are said to be seldom
accessible to U.S. diplomats. The military officers thus may be
sought out by Pentagon officials upon their arrival at Fort McNair.
   The U.S. official who described the trip said he did not know
when the four would arrive in the United States or how long they
would be attending the seminar.

   A task force recommendation that Supreme Court
nominees no longer testify openly at confirmation hearings is
drawing fire even from conservatives who complained about the
handling of Robert H. Bork's unsuccessful nomination.
   ``It's a nice idea in theory, but practically it won't work,''
Sen. Orrin G. Hatch, R-Utah, said Tuesday after The Task Force on
Judicial Selection issued a report recommending that Supreme Court
nominees no longer testify in public before the Senate Judiciary
Committee.
   The privately financed committee of lawyers, headed by former
Gov. Hugh Carey of New York, concluded that ``the confirmation

   For the week, NBC had an average rating of 13.9, ABC 13.5 and

   The Supreme Court said Wednesday the
government may continue viewing alcoholism as ``willful
misconduct'' rather than an uncontrollable disease when awarding
veterans education benefits.
   But the justices did not attempt to decide whether alcoholism is
a disease, noting that the medical community remains sharply
divided on that issue.
   Instead, the 4-3 decision said the Veterans Administration did
not violate a law protecting the rights of the handicapped when it
refused to extend education benefits to two men for more than 10
years after they left the service.

   The road from here to California for Jesse
Jackson is a rough one, strewn with ballot problems, unfavorable
rules, small numbers of black voters, and big leads for Michael
Dukakis in states from Pennsylvania to Ohio and beyond.
   Eleven primaries remain before the Democratic National
Convention in Atlanta, and only one _ the District of Columbia _
offers Jackson a solid shot at victory.
   The landscape is particularly difficult now that Dukakis has
opened a lead in the delegate count and is even winning the
cumulative popular vote _ which Jackson had claimed was the most
important battle. Jackson needs at least two big-state victories in
the next seven weeks to have a hope of pulling back even with the
Massachusetts governor.

   Immigrant schoolchildren often are placed in
classes for the handicapped or at inappropriate grade levels
because schools can't cope with their cultural differences, says a
two-year study released Wednesday.
   This is true even though ``the education level of many new
immigrants ... is superior to that of previous migrations,'' said
the 129-page study, conducted by the Boston-based National
Coalition of Advocates for Students and funded largely by the Ford
Foundation.
   Rigid placement practices, lack of bilingual education, cultural
insensitivity, harassment from other students and fear of
deportation all serve to undermine the education of immigrant
youngsters, the study found.

   Consumer prices shot up 0.5 percent in March
as a record increase in clothing costs and higher food and gasoline
prices triggered the biggest jump in inflation in 14 months, the
government reported Wednesday.
   Analysts said the sharp increase in the Labor Department's
Consumer Price Index, which translated into a 6.4 percent annual
rate of increase, demonstrated that the weak dollar and
unexpectedly strong consumer demand were threatening to ignite a
new bout of inflation.
   They said those pressures would soon prompt the Federal Reserve
to step in with a dose of higher interest rates to cool off the
economy.

be as potent as hard exercise in disrupting the heart's blood

   The researchers said their work gives scientific weight to the

trigger heart attacks.
   They found that giving a public talk about one's shortcomings
can be as disruptive to the heart as exercising to exhaustion.
However, it also appears that mental stress is a possible cardiac
problem only for people with heart disease, not for those with

<HEAD>Hawaiian Pastor Advocates Ukulele, A Formula And Aloha</HEAD>

   Among the the flowers, palms and deep-blue
waters of Hawaii, a widely esteemed native minister, the Rev.
Abraham K. Akaka, bears a message of the ukulele _ for islanders
and the world.
   To the state's singularly mixed culture of races, traditions and
ancestry, he advises, ``Think of yourselves as strings on a
ukulele, each different from the other strings, each preserving its
own tone, yet all necessary to make that beautiful harmony.''
   The objective, he said in a telephone interview, is unity in
diversity, of maintaining valued differences to enrich the whole,
something Hawaii particularly manifests, and the world needs.
   ``The key to it is that all the strings, all the races, nations
and cultures of mankind need to be tuned to one tuner, God, whose
name is love,'' Akaka said. ``When they do that, they retain their
individuality, but in a way that accepts the other strings, in
unity and harmony.''
   Akaka, 71, pastor emeritus of Hawaii's oldest church, the
Kawaiahao Church in downtown Honolulu, and among few clergymen of
original Hawaiian descent, strums the ukulele himself.
   He also has a special formula for diversified mutuality.
   It's a gentle revision of Albert Einstein's famous formula,
energy equals mass times the speed of light squared, by which the
first atomic chain reaction was achieved in 1942 while Akaka was in
seminary in Chicago.
   For different purposes, he proposes his own formula: CM
(creative mutuality) squared equals P (prosperous peace).
   ``It holds great hope for the future of mankind,'' he said. ``If
foreign policies of all nations used the formula, if every family
used it, every corporation and government used it, it would change
the world.
   Akaka for 28 years led the 1,000-member Kawaiahao church, built
in the 1830s of cream-colored coral from island reefs. It's
America's only church with royal pews _ for Hawaii's one-time
monarchy. He retired in 1985.
   But he keeps busy _ speaking, leading weddings and funerals,
blessing new homes, stores and other buildings. Gifts for his
services go to a foundation for native Hawaiian scholarships and to
help the needy.
   ``You cannot retire from the Lord,'' he said.
   More than a third of Hawaii's million people are Christians,
Protestants and Roman Catholics, including most Caucasians and the
native minority, while nearly a third are Buddhist, the rest
Shintoists or other faiths.
   ``We do not have religious strife,'' Akaka said.
   A clergyman of the United Church of Christ, he said the
different religious groups have become ``more and more cooperative
in dealing with issues affecting the well-being of the people.''
   He called modern mass communications media ``an instrument of
God, binding people closer, life with life, nation with nation,
culture with culture, race with race, enabling them to learn about
each other and understand each other.''
   That multicultural quality characterizes Hawaii, where 24.5
percent of the population is Caucasian, 23 percent is of Japanese
ancestry, 20 percent is Hawaiian and part-Hawaiian, 11 percent
Filipino, and smaller numbers of Chinese, Koreans, Samoans and
blacks.
   Native Hawaiians such as Akaka are descended from Polynesians
who came in large canoes from legendary ``Hawaiki'' (believed to be
Marquesas Island) to the west as long as 2,000 years ago.
   A second wave came from Tahiti around A.D. 1000. The Hawaiians
lived in isolation from the world until a British naval officer,
Capt. James Cook, came on the lovely isles in 1778.
   The native religion was polytheistic, with idols to many gods
and goddesses. After the monarchy developed, Queen Kaahumanu in
1819 abolished the native religion.
   The gap soon was filled by Protestant missionaries, first sent
in 1820 by Congregationalist antecedants of Akaka's present
denomination.
   They set up schools and churches, learned the Hawaiian language,
putting it into writing for the first time, introduced democratic
principles. Roman Catholic missionaries came in 1827. Natives
overwhelmingly became Christians.
   Akaka said that unlike cases in which invading Western
civiliation ``overturned and sometimes destroyed native cultures,
the Hawaiian people were pretty fortunate. Large credit is due to
work of the missionaries.''
   Much of ``our culture and history was preserved and
perpetuated,'' Akaka said. `We are Americans today. We love our
country, love the United States... But like any other people, we
love our roots.''
   Noting the names of the main old gods, ``Wakea'' and ``Papa,''
mean space and place _ ``arms that embrace all humanity,'' he added:
   ``That is the meaning of Aloha, the name that the people chose
for our state, the Aloha State. It emphasizes love for all people.
Aloha means we love you, care for you, welcome you. It expresses
that we are a family belonging to each other.''

   Traffic to Cuba by U.S. church leaders has
swelled to a busy tempo, with New York's Cardinal John O'Connor the
latest prominent churchman to visit that communist state.
   In the previous week, the president of the National Council of
Churches, the Rev. Patricia McClurg, and the council's general
secretary, the Rev. Arie Brouwer, visited Cuban church leaders.
   That trip came shortly after another by an interfaith team of
the Appeal of Conscience Foundation, which reported the situation
for churches has improved.
   ``We want to keep a continuous dialogue with the churches of
Cuba,'' says Brouwer. ``Especially at this moment of openness, this
time of improvement between church and state in Cuba, we feel it's
important to be with the churches and be in dialogue with the Cuban
government.''

   After the United Methodist Publishing House
canceled plans to publish a book by a bishop advocating relaxed
sexual views, it was snapped up by a major commercial publisher,
Harper & Row.
   The author, Episcopal Bishop John Shelby Spong of Newark, N.J.,
voiced delight at the outcome.
   He said the Methodist publisher, Abingdon Press, had
commissioned the book, but was ``so intimidated by reactionary
critics'' that it backed out of the project only a month before
publication.
   However, Harper & Row said it would keep that schedule, issuing
Spong's ``Living in Sin? A Bishop Rethinks Human Sexuality,'' on
May 15. Spong suggests approving single adult sex relations and
homosexual unions.
   Abingdon says it dropped the book because of feelings about
sexual issues confronting the church's governing conference April
26-May 6. President Robert K. Feaster of Abingdon said it didn't
want to aggravate the controversy.
   Harper editor Clayton Carlson called the book prophetic, saying
its ``bold proposals'' will ``undoubtedly thunder on to the
discussion agendas of virtually every ecclesiastical institution.''

<HEAD>Pride of Baltimore II Replacing Schooner Sunk in Disastrous Squall</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   When the 100-foot Pride of Baltimore II is
launched April 30, nearly two years will have passed since its
namesake and four crewmembers disappeared in a flash of high wind
and rain called a white squall.
   After the sinking 240 miles north of Puerto Rico, the operators
of the clipper-schooner weathered a critical report by federal
safety investigators and the city debated whether to chance the sea
again in a second Pride.
   The eight survivors of the sinking, who spent nearly five days
in a partially inflated life raft ankle-deep in sea water, urged
continuance of the Pride's mission of good will and promotion of
Baltimore and Maryland.
   So far, the state has contributed $1 million and the city
$500,000 toward the $4.5 million cost of creating a new, safer
ship. An additional $200,000 has come from individuals, whose
outpouring of sympathy and enthusiasm for the Pride ultimately
impelled the decision to rebuild.
   In its voyages around the United States and abroad, the first
Pride provided economic development officials with a lure for
businesses and drew attention to the Inner Harbor, Baltimore's
waterfront showpiece of urban revitalization.
   Boston has its non-profit Spirit of Massachusetts, and
California has a boat called the Californian, operated by a
non-profit group that primarily offers sailing lessons.
   Still, said Gail Shawe, executive director of the Pride of
Baltimore Inc., the private, non-profit corporation that is
building and will operate the ship, ``The Pride really was the only
vessel built with public dollars, owned by the public and used for
a goodwill mission tied to economic development.''
   Her office is decorated with photographs of the original Pride
sailing past a Danish castle and under the Tower Bridge in London.
   The Inner Harbor has echoed with the hammer blows of 16
shipwrights as the longer, wider and more stable Pride II has taken
shape.
   Peter Boudreau, one of the Pride's rotating captains and builder
of the new clipper, is eager for it to move beyond the sad shadow
of its predecessor.
   ``It's not intentionally callous. I'm sure everybody has their
private thoughts,'' said Boudreau, 33, who was building another
ship May 18, 1986, when he listened in disbelief to news that the
Pride and four of his colleagues were lost. ``You really want to
get on with things; do what you do best.''
   The shipbuilders, who have placed five good luck horseshoes
around the hull and their workshops, are putting final touches on
the ship, hammering cotton and oakum threads into the hull seams
with mallets and chisels.
   Following a computer-aided design, they've turned nearly 100
tons of Central American hardwoods and Douglas fir from the Pacific
Northwest into masts, deck, hull and interior.
   William A. Beasman, chairman of the Pride of Baltimore Inc.,
praised the workmanship.
   ``The artistry and skill in the keel, the knees _ they're
absolutely works of art,'' he said. ``When it's covered over, you
don't see that work. There's not a boat built in the United States
that can match the quality of that work.''
   In designing the Pride II, naval architect Thomas C. Gillmer
carried on the sleek look and advanced rigging design of the
Baltimore clipper-schooners, the first wholly American-designed
vessels. For port arrivals, departures and special occasions, the
ship will fire six-pound cannons and swivel guns like those carried
by Chesapeake Bay clippers that ran British blockades in the War of
1812.
   Unlike the first Pride, the new ship has been fitted with a
second diesel motor. Coast Guard regulations mandate that as a
passenger-carrying vessel, the new ship must contain watertight
bulkheads, which weren't required on its predecessor. Their absence
contributed to the Pride's rapid flooding after it tipped in the
fierce wind, according to the Coast Guard.
   Pride II is 92 feet long at waterline, compared with 76 feet on
the original, and 3 feet wider at the beam. It's heavier, too,
displacing 185 tons compared to the original ship's 123. ``It's
going to take more wind to make this boat keel over that far,''
said Boudreau.
   Two years before the sinking, a Coast Guard-commissioned study
determined the ship was unstable and prone to tip. The study said
the Pride would lose stability once it tipped more than 30 degrees
from upright, would begin to flood at 53 degrees and would not be
able to right itself once it reached 76 degrees.
   The squall knocked the Pride on its side within 20 seconds, and
it sank within 2 minutes, crew members said.
   After the 1986 tragedy, Ms. Shawe said, board members shied from
a replacement project as they coped with ``guilt, a sense of
responsibility. It was our decision that put that boat out there
and four people lost their lives.''
   When the decision to rebuild was made, safety was the top
consideration, she said.
   In a report on the sinking, the National Transportation Safety
Board criticized the Pride organization for sailing an uninspected
vessel.
   ``We weren't trying to sneak into some loophole. They (the Coast
Guard) had no reason to inspect the boat,'' Ms. Shawe said,
explaining that only ships that carry passengers or cargo must
undergo Coast Guard inspection.
   She defends the Pride captain, crew and board for taking care
about safety on their own.
   ``The two captains and I spent hours talking about the risks,
what should the communication schedule be. The old ship had
everything we could put on it.
   ``What we could have done differently were the EPIRBs,'' she
said, referring to a decision to equip the ship with manually
activated emergency radio signals, rather than automatic signals
that can be tripped simply by water on the deck. EPIRB stands for
Emergency Position Indicating Radio Beacon.
   The Pride II is fitted with automatic devices.
   When a Bethlehem Steel floating crane hoists the Pride of
Baltimore II into the Inner Harbor, the ship still will be months
from commissioning. That's tentatively scheduled for late October,
when the ship begins her maiden voyage.
   The new Pride may venture to new ports in the Far East or South
America and is expected to take its place in the 1992 New York
parade of Tall Ships marking 500 years since Columbus discovered
America.
   At a gathering of such ships for the Statue of Liberty
celebration July 4, 1986, less than seven weeks after the sinking,
the Spirit of Massachusetts towed a dinghy filled with flowers
donated by one of the Pride's Massachusetts ports of call in memory
of the Pride crew.

   Tess Harper's incredibly blue eyes flash when
she talks about ABC's ``Little Girl Lost,'' in which she plays a
foster mother battling an insensitive bureaucracy to save a
sexually molested child.
   Harper and Frederic Forrest play Clara and Tim Brady, who love
the young girl placed in their care but see her wrenched away, even
though they complain the natural father is abusing the child.
   ``When the child tells us she's been abused, the social services
caseworker doesn't believe her,'' said Harper. ``Then a newly
elected judge takes her away from us and awards her to the father.
We're told we have no rights, because foster parents are only paid
baby sitters.''
   The two-hour movie, filmed in Texas, is based on a true story.
It was brought to the screen by executive producer Marian Rees, who
won an Emmy for ``Love Is Never Silent.'' ABC will show the movie
Monday.
   Patricia Kalember co-stars as a TV reporter who supports the
Bradys in their quest to regain custody of the child. Marie Martin
plays the child, Tella DeBusk, who is nicknamed ``Beans.''
   ``It's getting to where the word of children is being taken more
seriously in court, but at the time of our story, in the 1970s, the
word of a child wasn't taken seriously,'' said Harper.
   ``It's amazing how much children are regarded as property. To a
large degree, the legal system treats children as property. They
have no civil rights.''
   Harper said that even after physical proof of molestation was
found, social service officials declined to prosecute the father.
   ``Instead, they forced him to give up custody of the child,''
she said. ``Tella was placed with another foster family. They
wouldn't return her to us, and they wouldn't let us adopt her. We
had bucked the system and had embarrassed them. It was all
vindictive pettiness. That's when the fight really began.''
   The social services workers argued that the Bradys, only foster
parents, had become emotionally involved.
   Throwing up her hands in bewilderment, Harper said, ``How can
you take a child into your home and not become emotionally
involved? You become emotionally involved with a pet. It's part of
nurturing and raising a child.''
   The Bradys eventually got Tella back, but a trailer at the end
says, ``The child they got back was not the same child that had
been taken away.''
   ``Her trust had been violated,'' said Harper.
   The movie was filmed in the same area as ``Tender Mercies,''
Harper's first film. She had been working in regional theater in
Texas when she was cast by Australian director Bruce Beresford as
the young widow who becomes the salvation of a down-and-out
country-western singer, played by Robert Duvall, who won an Oscar.
   Harper was nominated for an Academy Award for her supporting
role as the obnoxious cousin of sisters Jessica Lange, Sissy Spacek
and Diane Keaton in ``Crimes of the Heart.''
   Before doing ``Little Girl Lost,'' Harper was in Minnesota again
co-starring with Lange in ``Far North,'' written and directed by
Lange's companion, playwright and actor Sam Shepard. Charles
Durning and Anne Wedgeworth also star.
   ``All Sam will let us say is that it's about a family in the
north woods,'' she said. ``I can say it's good and I'm proud of
it.''
   She also has another movie coming out, ``Criminal Law,'' with
Kevin Bacon and Gary Oldman. She plays a police detective, a role
originally written for a man.
   ``I did three pictures last year,'' she said. ``I left in July
and came back in December. Then I painted my house.''

<HEAD>Playing It Safe on Interest Rates</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also on financial wires.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As interest rates have edged upward in recent
weeks, many savers and investors have begun looking for ways to
avoid the same mistakes they made last spring.
   Yields on long-term Treasury bonds, one closely watched gauge of
overall trends in interest rates, have climbed lately from about
8.3 percent to just above 9 percent as of early this week.
   Wall Street is filled with talk that the Federal Reserve might
soon tighten credit further, in order to keep an unexpectedly
strong economy from touching off increased inflationary pressures.
   All this carries a familiar ring for people who remember what
happened in late March through May 1987, when a surge in interest
rates sent values of many long-term interest-bearing investments _
for example, bond mutual funds _ tumbling by 10 percent to 15
percent.
   Forecasting interest rates is a notoriously difficult task. When
the great majority of people expect them to rise, they are
perfectly capable of doing just the opposite.
   Still, for anyone for wants to avoid getting caught in an
exposed position should rates keep moving up, there is a wide
variety of choices available.
   The key to reducing interest-rate risk is to shorten maturities
_ that is, to move into investments with lives short enough that
their market values aren't much affected by changing conditions.
   Reg Green, publisher of the Mutual Fund News Service, recently
provided the example of a three-year government note, yielding
about 7.4 percent. It would rise or fall in value by about 2.5
percent for each decline or increase of one percentage point in
long-term interest rates.
   By contrast, a 15-year Treasury bond yielding about 8.7 percent
would fluctuate about 10 percent in value if long-term rates rose
or fell one percentage point.
   If you want to eliminate any ups and downs whatsoever in the
dollar value of your principal, you can opt for very short-term
investments that are collectively referred to in the investment
business as ``cash.''
   These include Treasury bills, available in maturities of three
months to one year; money market mutual funds, whose total assets
have lately hit record highs; and bank money market accounts or
certificates of deposit maturing in, say, three to six months.
   Should interest rates rise substantially at any point, yields on
money market funds would naturally follow them, with a lag time
that depends on the average maturity of the securities in the
fund's portfolio.
   A popular new breed of money funds invests in short-term
municipal securities, and thus provides income that is exempt from
federal income taxes.
   But their appeal might not be as great as it looks. Suppose you
are faced with the choice of a taxable money fund yielding 6.43
percent and a tax-free fund returning 4.58 percent.
   If you are in the 33 percent tax bracket, which applies this
year to a relatively small number of higher-income savers and
investors, you would come out with a slightly higher after
tax-return in the tax-free fund.
   But if you were in the 28 percent bracket, you would actually
realize a few more aftertax dollars with your money in the taxable
fund than in the tax-free one.
   Suppose you are chary of the long-term bond market, but not
satisfied with yields available in the money markets. There are
plenty of ways to compromise with an investment maturing in the
``medium term,'' or somewhere roughly 18 months to 10 years from
now.
   Options in this range include bank CDs; Treasury securities
bought directly from the government or through a bank or broker,
and ``limited maturity'' bond mutual funds.

<HEAD>The Elevator Always Goes Up</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

   The elevator goes up but never comes down. The
higher it gets the faster it goes. There is no stop button.
   The situation recalls the hair-raising serials that once were a
staple of early movie houses, in which each sequence ended in awful
peril followed in a week by impossible escape.
   But there may be no escape from this difficulty unless the
corporations involved are even more creative than directors of
those old movies, and certainly more ingenious they have been to
date.
   The subject is the total income _ both salary and bonus _ of top
corporate officers. Only a couple of decades ago it was measured in
the low six figures, more recently in seven digits, and now on
occassion in eight numbers.
   One of the problems is that executive bonuses _ General Motors
granted $157 million in stock bonuses last year _ are almost always
based on good short-term performance.
   The situation can reach an acute stage when the industry is
cyclical, which the automotive industry is. That is, years of big
sales, high profits, rising stock prices and the like alternate
with off years.
   There is rarely a price to be paid for off years. But there is
almost always a reward to be gained for good years.
   Professor Eugene Jennings, professor of business at Michigan
State University and a confidential adviser to corporate chiefs and
boards, says the ever-rising incomes are developing into a public
relations problem for companies.
   In lean years, he observes, some executives are given bonuses
based on the justification that money will motivate them to produce
fat years. When the fat years arrive their bonuses are justified as
in the interests of equity.
   Equity in this instance means it is fair that executives be
compensated for enhancing shareholder values. But when that and
other explanations cannot be made, it is sometimes argued that
bonuses are needed to retain valued people.
   When those reasons fail, market parity is used. It means that an
executive of one company certainly cannot be compensated lower than
that of a comparable executive in a similar company. It is said
that market wages must be paid.
   There is some evidence that in lean years boards do indeed grant
fewer or smaller salary and bonus increases.
   But, says Jennings, ``as soon as one of these justifications can
be made, increases in bonuses occur of such proportion as to make
up for ground lost in the lean years.''
   He is convinced that if there were no lean years total incomes
would be smaller. But, he observes, lean years set the foundation
for subsequent large bonuses.
   He maintains ``there is no doubt in my mind and in minds of many
chief executives I have advised that you could pay one-half the
salaries and bonuses that America pays to corporate officers and
still get competent management.''
   The problem is that no one company can make the cuts and
survive. ``It has to be across the board,'' and that might mean a
national conference of chiefs to decide on controls, a prospect he
does not think will take place.
   Illustrating the difficulty in making changes, General Motors
last year announced that future bonuses would be tied to long-term
performance. One year later it contradicted itself, announcing big
short-term bonuses.
   While growing as a public relations problem, he believes the
rising incomes have not yet reached a critical stage in terms of
public concern, but that they will. The totals will grow swiftly as
the amounts involved are compounded.
   And no one company, he says, has access to the ``stop'' button.

<HEAD>French Presidential Campaign Boils Down To Two-Way Race</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The campaign for France's presidential election has
boiled down to a two-way contest: President Francois Mitterrand,
the Socialist turned centrist, against Premier Jacques Chirac, a
smoothed-over conservative banking on his record.
   Seven other candidates are running in the first round of the
election Sunday, but none appear to have a realistic chance of
making it to the runoff May 8 between the top two vote-getters.
   With polls indicating the 71-year-old Mitterrand will easily win
the first round, the contest likely to gain most attention is that
between Chirac, 55, and another conservative, former Premier
Raymond Barre, 64, for second place and a trip to the runoff.
   The wildcard is Jean-Marie Le Pen, leader of the extreme right
National Front whose score may upset predictions.
   All have appealed to the center in their campaigns.
   Abandoning most of his Socialist rhetoric, Mitterrand says that
if he wins a second seven-year term he will try to form a new
``presidential majority'' in the present conservative National
Assembly. To do that, he would have to win over wavering
center-right deputies. Otherwise, he says, he will dissolve the
National Assembly and call new legislative elections.
   Chirac says he too will keep the present National Assembly,
where he has a slim three-seat majority, but would ask his new
premier to enlarge the Cabinet to encompass more of the center.
   Polls indicate the French have grown weary of the ideological
right-left wrangling that has characterized politics since Charles
de Gaulle established the Fifth Republic 30 years ago.
   Many are satisfied with the current ``cohabitation'' of a
leftist president (Mitterrand) and rightist premier (Chirac)
created by the right's victory in the 1986 parlimentary elections.
   The polls indicate Mitterrand will defeat either Chirac or Barre
in the runoff May 8, although his margin of victory has shrunk from
as much as 10 percent to as little as 4 percent, depending on the
poll.
   One survey indicated 52 percent of the voters would like to see
some of the current rightist leaders take part in a Mitterrand
government, and 63 percent feel that Socialists should participate
in a Chirac or Barre Cabinet.
   The candidates seem to be listening.
   Former Foreign Minister Roland Dumas, a Socialist and friend of
the president, said recently: ``The election is going to
redistribute the whole political landscape. It's like the
Shakespeare play `Macbeth,' the trees are going to move.''
   On issues, however, indications are that few voters expect any
startling changes, no matter who wins.
   In laying out his platform, Mitterrand proposed only two
concrete ideas: reimposing the wealth tax and reducing the
presidential term to five years.
   The wealth tax, affecting France's 100,000 richest people, is an
old idea, promulgated by the Socialists in 1981 and repealed by the
conservatives in 1986. The five-year term was floated by former
President Valery Giscard d'Estaing last year. It incited little
enthusiam on the right or left.
   Mitterrand, who has carefully nurture$ an image as the wise
grandfather above the daily political slogging, stuck to
generalities in his short campaign. His objectives in domestic
policy focus on modernizing business and agriculture to make them
more competitive and to giving priority to education, professional
training and research. His foreign policy objectives aim at what he
calls the ``construction of Europe'' and ``reducing the gap that
separates rich and poor countries.''
   Chirac, who is president of the neo-Gaullist Rally for the
Republic, also focuses on economic themes and tries to stick the
Socialist label firmly on Mitterrand's back.
   ``From 1981 until 1986, under the empire of the Socialists, our
country fell five years behind,'' Chirac said during the campaign.
``Make no mistake, socialism today, even if it doesn't want to use
the name, is not any the less dangerous.''
   Barre, an economics professor, likes to stress that he is a
member of no political party, though he is supported by the
center-right Union for French Democracy, a part of Chirac's
governing coalition.
   Of all the candidates, he has proposed the most detailed
program, a $23-billion plan for measures that would include
strengthening education, fiscal reform, investment aid to help
create jobs and a guaranteed income for the unemployed. He is vague
on where the money will come from.
   Then there is the 59-year-old Le Pen, vilified by all political
leaders but nonetheless representing 10 to 12 percent of the vote.
   The left is contending that the right cannot win the election
without support from National Front voters backing Le Pen, who has
campaigned on a France-for-the-French theme and has railed against
immigrants, particularly Arabs from North Africa.
   Chirac does indeed need National Front votes, but has repeatedly
vowed he will never work a deal with Le Pen for his votes in the
runoff. The premier's chances depend very much on how much of the
extreme right vote he can collect in the second round and how many
of Barre's first-round voters he can entice.
   Some of Le Pen's supporters are disgruntled Communists unhappy
with their party's pro-immigrant stand. Analysts say many of them
will return to their natural leftist camp in the runoff, or
abstain. They also predict that about a third of Barre's centrist
supporters could end up in the Mitterrand column on May 8.
   Among the others on the ballot is Andre Lajoinie, 58, the
official candidate of the Communist Party, which once was a power
on the left representing nearly a quarter of the vote but now has
fallen on hard times.
   Adding to the Communists woes is the candidacy of Pierre Juquin,
58, expelled from the party last year after assailing what he
called the party's archaic structure and demanding party reform.
   At the bottom are Antoine Waechter, 39, an ecologist candidate
seeking to increase voter awareness about the environment; Arlette
Laguiller, 48, a Trotskyist making her third race, and Pierre
Boussel, 67, another Trotskyist.

   Here are brief sketches of the four pivotal
candidates in the first round of the French presidential elections
Sunday, April 24:
   
   FRANCOIS MITTERRAND, 71 _ He took office in 1981 in his third
run for the presidency, defeating Valery Giscard d'Estaing, the
incumbent conservative. His victory was followed by a Socialist
sweep in National Assembly elections the same year. After series of
costly spending measures early in his tenure, Mitterrand and his
Socialists reversed themselves and instituted austerity. The result
was a dropoff in Mitterrand's popularity _ from 60 percent early in
his term to 27 percent at mid-term. He has since moved from the
left to center-left, distancing himself from his party, and is
perceived by many to be above day-to-day politics. A life-long
politician, Mitterrand was first elected to the National Assembly
in 1946 and held 11 ministerial posts until 1958. He founded the
modern Socialist Party in 1971.

   JACQUES CHIRAC, 55 _ The premier since 1986 and mayor of Paris
since 1977, Chirac heads the conservative neo-Gaullist Rally for
the Republic party and is in his second presidential race. He was
eliminated in first round of voting in 1981, when Mitterrand
defeated Giscard d'Estaing. Chirac was first elected the the
National Assembly in 1967. From 1968 to 1974, he served in a series
of Cabinet posts, becoming premier under Giscard d'Estaing in 1974.
He resigned in 1976 after a dispute with the conservative
president. Chirac took over the Gaullist party in 1976. When an
alliance of conservatives and centrists won legislative elections
in 1986, by a three-seat margin, Mitterrand appointed Chirac
premier. Chirac advocates a free-market liberalism with emphasis on
improving economy by favoring business investment and tax breaks.

   RAYMOND BARRE, 64 _ This is the first presidential race for the
former professor of economics and former premier. Barre is a member
of no political party, but is supported by the center-right Union
for French Democracy. He entered government as the head of the
office of the minister for industry and commerce in 1959 and has
served on several commissions. He was appointed premier by Giscard
d'Estaing after Chirac's resignation in 1976 and stepped down from
that post after Mitterrand's election in 1981. He currently is as

   JEAN-MARIE LE PEN, 59 _ He is the leader of extreme right
National Front and this is his second presidential race. A former
Foreign Legionnaire and member of rightist groups since his student
days, he won just 0.75 percent of the vote in the 1974 presidential
race. Le Pen came to prominence with his party in the 1984
elections to the European Parliament, winning 10 percent of vote.
In 1986 legislative elections, his National Front won 35 seats in
the National Assembly and Le Pen became a political force, focusing
largely on his opposition to non-European immigration and on law
and order issues. He poses serious problems for Chirac and Barre,
who need rightist votes but can't be seen as approving Le Pen's
extremist views.

<HEAD>Merkur Scorpio Is Prize-winning Thoroughbred</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto and LaserGraphic</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By ANN M. JOB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>For The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Merkur Scorpio was a prize-winning
thoroughbred from its earliest days in Europe. Thank goodness Ford
Motor Co. saw fit to bring it to this country for discriminating
American buyers of luxury sports sedans.
   The Scorpio, in Lincoln-Mercury dealerships for a second model
year, is a sheer joy to drive.
   The test car was impressive, not only in the performance of its
2.9-liter, electronic fuel-injected V-6 but in the comfort and
design of its interior. The miles just flew by, no matter if trips
were long or short.
   The biggest complaint I had were the electrical problems. The
right rear window, power of course, wouldn't go down on the test
car.
   Also, the electrical cutoff to the rear seats, designed so
drivers can keep youngsters in the back from playing with the power
windows and power rear seats that recline, didn't work.
   Still, those problems _ even in a $26,000 car _ were quickly
forgotten once the Scorpio was put in gear and began to move.
   Handling was flawlesss, so much so that at one point I was up to
120 mph without realizing it.
   Even at that high speed, this rear-drive, luxury touring sedan
with firm, taut suspension handled as if it was only going 60-65
mph. In fact, keeping the Scorpio within speed limits required
vigilance. The car just wanted to run.
   It was quickly up to 45 mph in residential areas, up to 75-80
mph on highways with equal regularity. It just didn't FEEL as if it
was going that fast.
   Electronically controlled antilock brakes performed superbly to
prevent brake lockup in several simulated panic stops.
   I wasn't sure I would like the four-peed automatic transmission
(I prefer manuals on performance cars) but I came to enjoy the
relatively smooth operation of this automatic.
   Inside, special details were everywhere.
   A fuel economy computer that could instantly and constantly
calculate fuel consumption was a bit distracting, and I'm not sure
someone paying $26,000 for the car would care that much about
keeping track of some gallons of gasoline.
   But the optional leather seats on the test car, with lumbar
support in front, made for comfortable rides.
   The steering wheel not only tilted by telescoped up and down as
the driver wished.
   Map reading lights for front and rear riders could be rotated to
better focus light where needed.
   Rear seats as well as front seats reclined.
   Outside mirrors were heated.
   There was even a built-in light on the head of the key so a
driver could illuminate the keyhole on the outside of the door and
unlock the vehicle with ease in the dark.
   The Scorpio certainly is a worthy competitor in its market
segment, which includes the Audi 5000 and Mercedes 190, and has won
hearts in Europe.
   Introduced there in May 1985, the West German-built Scorpio won
the prestigious European Car of the Year award for 1986 and was
named top car in Britain, Car of the Year in Ireland and Denmark
and Imported Car of the Year in Spain.
   Since its European debut, more than 271,000 have been sold.
Scorpios sales in this country began last May, and Road & Track
magazine named it one of the 10 best cars for value.
   In 1987, just over 5,000 were sold, and Ford projects 1988 sales
of more than 10,000, according to a company spokeswoman.
   U.S. buyers have average age of 45 and annual income of $65,000,
she said. Seventy percent are college graduates, 80 percent are
married and 30 percent are females.
   Because of its newness to the U.S. market, the Scorpio is not
listed in Consumer Reports' trouble index of frequency of repairs.
However, Ford has ensured Scorpio buyers the car will retain much
of its value with a program that guarantees trade-in price.
   The trade-in is calculated by comparing the average resale value
of the car to the average resale value of the Mercedes 190E, using
monthly figures from the National Automobile Dealers Association's
used-car guide. If there is a discrepancy, say the Scorpio's resale
value is at 45 percent of the original purchase price while the
average Mercedes 190E's is at 50 percent, the Scorpio owner will be
paid the 5 percent difference.

   In March, Premier Giovanni Goria decided to go ahead with
completion of the plant, which angered Italy's Socialist Party and
helped bring down Goria's five-party coalition.
   In Switzerland, anti-nuclear and environmental activists last
year submitted enough signatures to force two referendums on
nuclear energy.
   One referendum calls for a 10-year moratorium on construction of
new nuclear power plants. The second deals with the scrapping of
the nation's five nuclear power plants and on a ban on construction
of new ones.
   The referendums are not expected to come to a vote until at
least 1990.
   Since Chernobyl, nuclear power plant construction has continued
in several East European countries, including East Germany, Poland
and Czechoslovakia.
   The accident continues to fuel efforts of anti-nuclear and
environmental groups in Yugoslavia, East Germany and Poland, but
their numbers remain small and they are often harassed.
   East German security forces last year raided the offices of one
environmental group in East Berlin and detained several of its
members.
   But in Italy, the accident led, in effect, to the scrapping of
the nation's future nuclear power expansion program.
   In November 1987, the Italians voted by a margin of 4-1 to
reject the further use of nuclear power.
   Italy operates three nuclear power plants, all of which are
temporarily closed for routine maintenance and reactor refueling. A
fourth is in an advanced state of construction.
   But the Chernobyl disaster has also fostered more cooperation
between East and West on nuclear issues.
   A Soviet delegation visited Britain in March and the two nations
have agreed to exchange safety-related information in addition to
details of any major radiation leaks.
   West Germany has provided technical safety assistance to East
Germany and last year signed an agreement with the Soviet Union for
joint efforts in developing nuclear power.
   Most European countries continue to test for radiation in
imported foods. Blanket bans on foodstuffs were lifted in 1986.
   ``Coffee, chocolates, meats, dairy products, cereals and baby
foods are not admitted into the country unless they carry a
certificate showing they've been tested for radioactivity,'' said a
senior Greek Health Ministry official.
   Arkadiusz Zmyslowski, director of the Polish Atomic Agency, told
The Associated Press there were no lingering effects in Poland
related to the accident.
   ``The radiation is back to the normal levels that existed before
the Chernobyl accident,'' he said. ``There is no contamination of
milk or any food.''
   On April 15, the Soviet news agency Tass quoted an agriculture
official in the Ukraine, Alexei Denisenko, as saying that crop
yields there had improved since the accident and that no
``irreparable damage'' had been done. He added that all farm
products are checked for radiation before they are sold, Tass said.
   But despite widespread testing and assurances that most areas of
Europe were not exposed to serious radiation levels, many residents
remain uneasy and worry about the accident's long-term impact.
   Eva Goes, the Swedish Environmental Party activist, said
residents continue to use Geiger counters purchased after the
disaster to test for radiation contamination.
   She said the levels are not going down.
   Concerned parents in Wiesbaden, West Germany, also continue to
run their own radioactivity-measuring station.
   Sheep farmer Bini Jones says the upland section of her 100-acre
farm in North Wales is still contaminated, but that she needs the
land for grazing.
   ``Everybody said it couldn't happen in the nuclear power
industry, and it did happen and far, far away,'' she said. ``We
worry about the effect on our children and on unborn generations.''

<HEAD>Swedes Say Quick Action Saved Reindeer Industry after Chernobyl</HEAD>

   Quick government action after the
Chernobyl nuclear accident two years ago has saved Sweden's
reindeer industry and preserved the culture of the Lapps who raise
them, officials say.
   ``Thanks to government support, the industry has remained
profitable, and it has recovered from the shock and depression that
came to all affected,'' said Bengt Ekendahl, chairman of the
Reindeer Radioak-group, formed to help the Lapp herdsmen in
northern Sweden.
   Strong winds carried Chernobyl's radioactivity 1,300 miles to
the pine-wooded wilderness of northern Scandinavia where about
40,000 Lapps live.
   Unknown to the reindeer herdsmen, the radiation fell in a
snowfall April 27, 1986, the day after the accident, affecting
swathes of central and northern Sweden.
   Later that year, about 80 percent of the 95,000 reindeer in the
annual slaughter were discarded because of contamination.
   The disaster threatened to destroy the reindeer industry. It
also could have meant the end of the Lapp culture, which is
dependant on reindeer farming and which already has been endangered
by civilization encroaching into forests and grazing land.
   Many Swedes consider reindeer meat a delicacy. It is usually
smoked and has the flavor of wild game. For the Lapps, reindeer
meat is a staple of their diet, and the skins and antlers are used
for clothing and tools.
   The Swedish government agreed to pay market prices to the
farmers for meat that was destroyed, and it launched a program to
find ways to save as many animals as possible.
   Swedish Lapps, or Samis as they prefer to be called, are the
original nomadic inhabitants of the northern regions of Norway,
Sweden, Finland and the Soviet Kola Peninsula, collectively called
Lapland.
   In Sweden, they herd about 270,000 reindeer. Some herdsmen still
roam freely across the Scandinavian borders.
   Reindeer are especially vulnerable to fallout because they eat
lichen, which soaks up high concentrations of radiation.
   To counteract the radiation, the government distributes free
pellets of processed food containing bentonite, a clay mixed with
other substances which help reduce the effects of radioactivity,
Ekendahl said.
   This year the amount of reindeer meat that will have to be
destroyed is falling to about 35 percent of the 85,000 animals due
to be slaughtered, he said.
   He estimated that 4,000 animals had been saved by lowering the
radiation levels through the prepared feed, and 2,500 other
reindeer were saved for human consumption by moving herds to
non-contaminated areas.
   ``Not one reindeer farmer has had to close down,'' Ekendahl said.
   He added that the reindeer industry will survive, but it will
face the radiation problem for 20 or 30 more years.

<HEAD>Deadline Nears As Government Ponders Whether to Extend</HEAD>

   After years of hiding, afraid the next knock
on the door could mean deportation, thousands of America's illegal
aliens remain unwilling to come forward to claim the amnesty to
which they are entitled.
   Time is running out for those who still have not applied. The
Immigration and Naturalization Service's program to legalize
illegal aliens expires May 4. Although measures to extend the
program are pending in Congress, it appears none is likely to pass
before the deadline.
   From its implementation in 1987, the INS program has been
surrounded by rumors, lawsuits, predictions of failure and general
distrust from the alien community it seeks to serve.
   Still, more than 1.6 million people have come forward; INS had
hoped for 2 million of the estimated 3 million total illegal aliens
in the country.
   Sofia Morgan, a clerical worker from Manchester, Jamaica, came
to the United States for a vacation in 1979 and decided to stay to
``make something'' of herself.
   Like many illegal aliens, the 35-year-old Harrison, N.Y.,
resident worked as a nurse's aide and a housekeeper.
   When the amnesty program began May 5, 1987, Morgan hired an
attorney to ensure her chances. ``I found I really didn't need
him,'' she said. ``I just happened to have all the documents. I
paid taxes and you have to keep those papers and I found two old
letters someone had sent me years ago.
   ``At first I was scared that I didn't have all the requirements.
And people would tell you things. But I had no trouble at all,''
she said.
   To other aliens who might be sitting on the fence, Morgan says,
``Go ahead and do it. It's worth the try. The good thing is if they
turn you down, they can't deport you. If you're turned down you can
reapply. And you can _ I believe that.''
   Illegal aliens who entered the United States before Jan. 1,
1982, are eligible for amnesty under the provisions of the
Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986. Also eligible are
agricultural workers who can show they lived in this country for
least 90 days in the year ended May 1, 1986.
   The legislation was designed to stem widespread illegal
immigration by legalizing these workers and penalizing employers
who continued to hire illegal aliens. INS officials told a recent
Senate hearing that illegal border crossings in the Southwest had
dropped by 29 percent in the year the program has been in operation.
   As of April 18, 1.2 million aliens had applied for amnesty in
the regular program and 400,111 in the agricultural plan, which has
a Nov. 30 application deadline. An INS spokesman said about 95
percent of all applications were approved to receive the temporary
green cards.
   To expedite filings in these waning days of the program,
Attorney General Edwin Meese III issued new regulations allowing
aliens to apply now and provide paperwork later.
   Initially, aliens had to furnish identification, a $185 filing
fee and proof of their financial status and the length of time
they've lived in the United States.
   ``This was a problem because if you have spent the last 10 years
blending in and avoiding everyone, it's difficult to produce
documentation,'' said Charlie Phee, legalization officer at
Georgetown University's Refugee Center.
   More daunting, in many cases, was the fear factor.
   `Many of these people have spent years avoiding the INS, and to
ask them to voluntarily go in takes a great leap of faith that some
are still not ready to make,'' Phee said.
   INS spokesman Duke Austin said there was not ``a single
element'' of truth in rumors at the start of the program that
amnesty actually was a ``sting operation'' that would lead to
deportation of non-qualifying family members.
   ``It's been almost a year and we haven't done it,'' he said.
``This is the proof that we've been responsible and are running the
program in good faith.''
   INS has been criticized, however, for its efforts in educating
the public about the program.
   A report by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace said
the public information campaign was ``seriously inadequate'' and
predicted the program would not meet its goal of legalizing at
least 2 million undocumented workers.
   An American Bar Association report said the program's success
would depend on the INS' finding new ways to reach eligible aliens
and encoure them to apply before the May 4 deadline.
   And an analysis sponsored by the Ford Foundation found the
program was so complex it was difficult for the government to
administer and the applicants to understand. This study also said
the fee was too high.
   The Ford Foundation study did commend the INS, however, for
running ``a largely upbeat'' program and establishing a network of
more than 100 Legalization Officers.
   Austin says the criticism about public notification isn't
deserved.
   ``I don't think you can go anywhere in this country and find
someone who doesn't know about this program,'' he said. ``It's
virtually impossible.''
   Since last June, INS has put ads in newpapers answering
questions aliens might have, sponsored musical jingles on the radio
and placed posters on buses and subways to encourage participation.
   Phee said one problem was that amnesty information did not
spread by word of mouth, as INS had thought it would.
   ``This is why INS had to have `Anmesty Week' and `Amnesty Day.'
You know they even had an INS anmesty elephant in the Cherry
Blossom Parade,' he said.
   But the illegal aliens still were afraid to come forward.
   `They would stand about 30 feet from your sign-up table and then
get closer and closer. Finally they would ask questions for a
friend of their mother's cousin,'' he said. ``But it was their own
situations they asked about. It always is.''
   Bills pending on Capitol Hill would extend the deadline for
applications, but the administration opposes them.
   ``There is no evidence that this would increase the number of
applications but only reward procrastination,'' Austin said. ``And
the program would, in all likelihood, become a deficit-running
program.''
   Austin said he didn't know what more the government could do.
   ``I don't think anything short of the government going out and
hauling them in can impact on that,'' he said.

   In Southern California, the year-long program
for illegal aliens is being hailed as a success by those running it
and bemoaned as a crippling blow by some industries in constant
need of cheap labor.
   ``It's been an incredible experience and I think very effective
_ especially our outreach,'' said Harold Ezell, Western region
commissioner for the Immigration and Naturalization Service.
   ``In March, we had everything from amnesty fairs to luaus for
Tongan people. We've sacrificed the lives of some 13 or 14 pigs for
the mission of amnesty.''
   But the INS program has hurt some businesses in Southern
California, particularly the garment industry, said Garth Ward,
president of the Garment Contractors Association of Southern
California Inc. and president of Fashion Sportswear Inc.
   Apparel manufacture is California's fifth largest industry and
the third largest in Southern California.
   ``Historically, we've had an almost unlimited supply of warm
bodies that were trainable. Now we have a very limited supply of
workers,'' Ward said.
   Illegal aliens who can prove they have lived in this country
continuously since Jan. 1, 1982, have until May 4 to apply for
amnesty.
   ``The saddest thing about the program is that it's going to
leave a lot of people without any protection whatever,'' said Josie
Gonzalez, a Los Angeles immigration attorney.
   ``The vast majority of people in California will remain
undocumented. The principal reason is they entered (the country)
too late. The second reason is they can't document their
residence,'' she said.
   Ward and Ms. Gonzalez said worker shortages within the garment
industry are the result of several factors.
   While as much as 70 percent of the labor pool doesn't qualify
for amnesty, Ms. Gonzalez said, ``those who do qualify often leave
for other kinds of jobs. Once they are not afraid of deportation,
they will look around for better jobs.''
   ``A year ago, I had 140 people. I hit a low of 80, and we are
hiring people with no experience and offering them $4 an hour and
going to $4.25 (the new state minimum wage) and higher in July,''
Ward said.
   Ezell's region, with 36 offices in California, Arizona, Nevada,
Hawaii and Guam, is processing 5,400 applications a day this month,
compared to 1,200 applications a day in December.
   ``These are big numbers. We're going full bore,'' Ezell said.
   Ezell objects to any extension of the application deadline, as
proposed by Congress. But Ms. Gonzalez, Archbishop Roger Mahony of
the Los Angeles Roman Catholic Archdiocese and Bernard Brown,
president of the Coalition of Apparel Industries in California,
believe more time is needed.
   ``Some of the things they are doing at the last minute should
have been done early on,'' Brown said. ``There wasn't enough
information given to these people. A lot of these people don't know
if they can be documented or not.''
   Mahony argues for a one-year-extension to allow ``the
potentially eligible population time to learn of the policy
adjustments, modifications and clarifications that INS has made, .
.. to resolve issues affecting eligibility presently being
litigated, and to give the application population a reasonable
chance to (acquire) the proofs necessary and the fees.''
   But Ezell pointed out the program was designed to be
self-funding. ``We have broken even so far,'' he said. ``Can you
guarantee you can produce 300,000 more people for six more months
or do you think the taxpayers should come up with $30 million or
$40 million more to fund it for another six months?
   ``There's no need for that extension, any more than an extension
on the November elections or filing of income tax. ...
Procrastination is one of the major problems of those who haven't
filed yet,'' he said.

   Antonio Gonzalez shined shoes right in
front of the INS Legalization Center, but for six months he didn't
bother to follow his customers into the office to apply for amnesty.
   Gonzalez, a 51-year-old Mexican who has been in the United
States illegally since 1974, seems to meet the eligibility
requirement of establishing residency before Jan. 1, 1982. But
because he worked 12 years for a man who paid him in cash, a man
now dead, Gonzalez figured he had no way to prove it.
   ``He's typical of the illegal who doesn't know what to do,''
said John Turner, who is helping Gonzalez gather affidavits from
landlords and part-time employers to document his eligibility by
the May 4 deadline.
   About 40,000 people have applied for amnesty in El Paso, fewer
than the 50,000-100,000 expected, but lines have been getting
longer as the deadline approaches. Two weeks ago, the Immigration
and Naturalization Service reversed its previous first-come,
first-served stance and began asking applicants to make
appointments. The INS is also giving applicants 60 days after the
deadline to get their documentation in.
   In the last few weeks, the INS has inserted pamphlets in
tortilla packages and has sponsored promotions on Spanish-language
radio stations in Texas and New Mexico, urging people in their
native language to apply for amnesty.
   But critics say the INS is doing too little, too late to attract
more illegal aliens.
   Turner, manager of National Amnesty Consultants, a company that
helps illegal aliens assemble their amnesty paperwork, echoed other
critics who assert the INS could have done a better job of
educating potential applicants.
   Gonzalez was spurred to action after an El Paso Herald-Post
photographer took his picture last month. The caption explained
Gonzalez's dilemma, and in an accompanying story, Gonzalez said,
``I love America. I dream I cross the bridge and proudly say,
`American citizen.''' People entering the United States must
declare their citizenship to INS officials.
   Turner, who works a few doors from the Legalization Center in
south El Paso, saw the photo.
   ``I had seen the guy sitting there for six months, selling gum
and shining shoes,'' Turner said. ``One day, he asked if I wanted a
shoeshine, and I said, `No, thanks.' And he said, `Well, how about
helping me with amnesty?' I said, `That I can do.'''
   The INS could have better anticipated such problems, Turner said.
   ``They could have been a lot more practical in their approach to
education,'' he said. ``They did seminars to Spanish-speaking
audiences in English. They issued pamphlets in English, and the
pamphlets are too general.
   ``They (amnesty applicants) want to know what happens if they've
been using their mother's Social Security number. They can still
get amnesty if they've been doing that _ but it's not covered in
any pamphlets, and it's a common problem.
   ``If you walk into the Legalization Center, and you ask them if
you had two DWIs (convictions for driving while intoxicated) if you
could apply, they won't answer you. They tell you to look somewhere
else. The answer is simple _ yes, if you don't have any felony
convictions and you have less than three misdemeanor convictions.''
   Father Rick Matty, director of migrant and refugee services for
the Roman Catholic Diocese of El Paso, said that because all the
INS forms are written in English, some rejected applicants don't
know they can appeal and apply again for amnesty.
   Despite the fact that most applicants in the 13-state southern
INS region speak Spanish, William Chambers, director of the
processing center in Dallas, said it would be impractical to print
forms in Spanish.
   ``If we did that, we'd have to print them in about 50 or 60
languages,'' he said. ``Pakistani, Greek, Arabic...''

   The sign adjacent to an employment agency in a
grimy corridor full of job shops reads ``lava platos'' and offers
$200 to $250 a week ``and cuarto comida'' _ room and board.
   But if you want that dishwashing job, you have to have a green
card. The new immigration law is changing the way staffing patterns
of New York restaurants, heretofore heavily dependent on the labor
of illegal aliens.
   ``If you go to the restaurants, always they ask for the card,''
said Ruben Roldan, 36, an unemployed short-order cook and Mexican
immigrant who has been in and out of this country since 1973.
   ``I think it's going to be a big problem for people,'' he said
in a blend of Spanish and English as he stood next to the card case
outside the Apollo employment agency, one flight up from
Manhattan's bustling, gritty 14th Street.
   The Apollo's manager, Mike Melik, leaned against the case and
eyed a prospective client. ``You have a green card?'' he asked. The
man nodded yes, and they disappeared inside.
   ``I have to ask'' because of the new immigration law requiring
proof of citizenship or legal residence for all workers, Melik said
later.
   If the answer is yes, ``we see what kind of job'' is available,
he said. ``If it's no, we try to help them to be legal. I think
plenty don't have the card.''
   Under the law, employers must be prepared to prove their workers
live here legally. Employers who knowingly hire illegal aliens face
jail terms of up to six months and $10,000 fines.
   Immigration and Naturalization Service officials say they will
begin imposing penalties June 1.
   The law also provides amnesty to aliens who arrived in the
United States before 1982 _ if they apply by May 4. In New York, as
elsewhere, the results of the amnesty offer have been
disappointing, officials said.
   Jack Byrnes, chief legalization officer for the New York INS
district, said that as of March 25, 63,000 applications for amnesty
had been filed. Officials had expected 300,000 applications from
New York City, Long Island and seven upstate counties.
   Only 12,600 of the applications came from workers in service
jobs, a fraction of the region's illegal restaurant and hotel
workers. That leaves the city's restaurants in a quandary.
   ``One fellow in particular told me if he can't get his help
legally, he may close up shop. It's very difficult to get Americans
to take these positions,'' said Jeffrey Margolis, an immigration
lawyer who has run seminars about the law for one of his clients,
the New York State Restaurant Owners Association.
   ``A lot of people said that without `Juan,' we couldn't be as
successful as we are,'' Margolis added. ``Here's the kind of
employment that does not require an advanced degree, does not
require fluency in a language and requires someone who will work
hard for low wages.''
   Albert, a worker at World Employment who declined to give his
last name, said, ``A lot of people come in here without papers and
there's no way in the world we're going to send them to jobs
without them.''
   He said about 25 percent of those seeking jobs lacked documents.
They come from places like Senegal, South America, Trinidad and
Jamaica.
   ``Five minutes ago, I spoke to a Spanish guy. I had a great job
for him, but he didn't have a Social Security card or a green
card,'' Albert said. ``He acted disappointed. He knows that's the
law.''
   Attorney Ned Bassen, on the other hand, said the two dozen
members of the Restaurant League he represented had reported few
such problems.
   ``It may be far too early to determine whether restaurants are
going to have problems and what the impact is going to be,'' Bassen
said. ``It's going to take a while before the law is in full
swing.''

<HEAD>Few in Boston's Large Illegal Irish Population Qualify for Amnesty</HEAD>
<HEAD>With BC-Immigration Amnesty</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mary Tracey has told about 100 illegal Irish
immigrants that their worries are over, an equal number that theirs
will continue. But most of thousands of Irish aliens in the Boston
area she never sees.
   From her small office at St. Augustine's rectory in South
Boston, Tracey helps illegal aliens apply for the federal amnesty
program that ends May 4. The overwhelming majority of the area's
large illegal Irish population won't bother coming.
   ``Most of the Irish, unfortunately, are not eligible for the
amnesty,'' Tracey said. ``The Irish are not as helped by this as
are other ethnic groups.''
   Estimates on the number of illegal Irish range from 8,000 to
25,000 in Boston, a city of 550,000. Most immigration officials and
leaders of the Irish community agree that only 2 percent to 3
percent of the Irish qualify for amnesty, which is available to
illegal aliens who entered the United States before Jan. 1, 1982.
   ``The Irish have come and gone,'' said Charles T. Cobb, district
director of the Immigration and Naturalization Service. ``They work
eight or nine months and then go home for a while. They never have
the continuity of illegality that is required to qualify under this
program.'' Most illegal Irish are employed in the construction and
hotel-restaurant industries, he said.
   An informal network exists among the Irish who have jobs, and
they help others who come, immigration officials say. Rarely are
such rings broken up.
   In March, a Hingham nursing home owner was indicted for
allegedly inducing 11 Irish nationals, through ads in a Dublin
newspaper, to enter the United States illegally and work for him as
nursing aides and orderlies.
   Of the more than 7,100 aliens who had applied for amnesty in
Massachusetts as of April 16, only 101 listed Ireland as their
homeland. Some 30 others said they were from the United Kingdom,
which could include residents of British-controlled Northern
Ireland. Nationwide, about 600 Irish aliens have applied out of
about 1.5 million applicants.
   ``The low numbers surprise me to some degree,'' said Cobb. ``I
gather that most of the Irish have come here after 1982.''
   Bill O'Donnell, editor of the Irish Echo, said his newspaper had
published scores of articles in the last year explaining the
amnesty provisions and listing the groups offering assistance to
prospective applicants. Last week, the newspaper carried an
editorial demanding that Congress extend the deadline.
   ``There just simply has not been enough time on the educational
end of it to get the word out,'' O'Donnell said.
   Rep. Joseph Kennedy, D-Mass., has proposed another amnesty
program for an estimated 150,000 illegal Irish immigrants who don't
qualify for the INS program. Prospects for that proposal, as well
as efforts to extend the deadline, are dim.
   Tracey, a social worker for Catholic Charities, meets with
prospective applicants at least four days a week, explaining the
guidelines and helping with the documentation needed to prove
residency in the United States prior to 1982. She says that while
the percentage still is small, there has been an increase in
applications since the first of the year.
   Cobb concurs.
   ``The procrastinators are coming out of the woodwork,'' he said.
``It's just like the 14th of April,'' the day before the federal
income tax deadline.
   Brendan Scannell, the Irish consul general in Boston, says that
the Irish who are eligible for amnesty and do not apply will have
no excuse.
   ``We Irish are English-speaking, so we are not placed in the
same degree of difficulty about entitlement and awareness of the
package that INS is offering as are other nationalities,'' Scannell
said.
   ``By now, everyone should know. But you always have people who
for a variety of reasons are reluctant to come forward.''

<HEAD>Futures Prices Fade After Monday's Runup On Persian Gulf Fighting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Profit-taking and technical factors have sent
oil futures tumbling, continuing a price slide that began following
an Monday's short-lived rally sparked by Persian Gulf combat.
   Contracts for May delivery of West Texas Intermediate, the
benchmark U.S. crude, closed down 49 cents at $18.03 per barrel in
Tuesday's trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   Among refined products, May contracts for wholesale unleaded
gasoline ended at 52.14 cents per gallon, down 1.16 cents, while
wholesale heating oil contracts closed at 49.68 cents per gallon,
off 0.82 cent.
   Analysts said traders grew increasingly bearish as prices failed
to bounce back from Monday's lows.
   Prices had surged early Monday amid reports that U.S. Navy
vessels destroyed two offshore Iranian oil platforms, sunk an
Iranian patrol boat and bombed two Iranian navy frigates, while
Iran had fired on at least two U.S. vessels.
   Nervous traders rushed to buy futures because of uncertainty
over the fighting's ultimate impact on Persian Gulf shipments.
   But by midday Monday the attacks ceased, and the tide turned.
After the May crude contract _ which had leaped 55 cents to $18.92
_ failed to move higher, sellers took over and cut the gain to 15
cents by the close.
   On Tuesday, that downward trend continued throughout the day.
   Donald Morton, an analyst at the Boston office of
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., called Monday's early rally ``a
one-time deal, a Monday-morning panic-type situation.''
   ``The market has more than likely seen its top,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   The investor group posing a takeover threat to
Gillette Co. is suing the company for allegedly using misleading
and false statements in its campaign against the group's attempt to
win four Gillette board seats.
   The group, Coniston Partners, filed a countersuit Tuesday to
Gillette's April 14 federal court suit seeking to block Coniston
from soliciting shareholder votes for the board election at
Thursday's annual meeting.
   The countersuit, the latest in a series of skirmishes between
Coniston and the personal care products giant, alleged that
Gillette presented misleading and false statements in material sent
to its nearly 27,000 shareholders and run in newspapers urging
rejection of Coniston's takeover attempt.
   Victor Lewkow, one of Coniston's attorneys, cited Gillette's
indication that Coniston was interested in a ``greenmail'' payment
to abandon its bid and a chart in Tuesday's Wall Street Journal
showing that Swiss tycoon Tito Tettamanti heads Coniston's
``tangled web'' of corporations.
   ``It just isn't true,'' said Lewkow. ``You can put anyone on top
of a chart showing someone is in charge.''
   Lewkow said the countersuit sought unspecified relief and
dismissal of Gillette's lawsuit. The action does not try to block
the annual meeting, said Lewkow.
   In its lawsuit, Gillette claimed Coniston violated federal laws
by issuing material that did not fully outline all partners and
investors affiliated with the takeover attempt.
   Voting results are not expected for at least a week following
the meeting. Gillette said its suit should not delay the meeting.
   The Gillette suit names as defendants Coniston principals
Augustus K. Oliver, Paul E. Tierney Jr. and Keith R. Gollust, in
addition to Tettamanti and several other firms holding large blocks
of Gillette stock.
   On Tuesday, Judge Rya Zobel ordered an April 29 pre-trial
hearing for both suits.
   Coniston's bid received a boost Monday when the California
Public Employees Retirement Fund, the fifth-largest Gillette
shareholder with about 1.5 million shares, announced it would vote
for the Coniston candidates.
   The two Coniston partnerships have accumulated 6.76 million
Gillette shares, or about 5.8 percent of the company's shares
outstanding.
   In several letters to shareholders since March, Gillette
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Colman Mockler Jr. claimed
Coniston planned to sell or dismember the Boston-based company.
   Coniston states it can boost company profitability and stock
prices at Gillette, which paid nearly $580 million in late 1986 to
halt Revlon Group Inc.'s repeated takeover attempts.
   Gillette laid off nearly 2,400 workers and sold several
unprofitable divisions during a restructuring after Revlon signed a
10-year agreement not to seek control of the company.

<HEAD>DEC Unveils New Mid-Range VAX Computers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Digital Equipment Corp.'s new line of mid-range
computers offers a significant price performance increase and
should intensify competition with rival International Business
Machines Corp., industry analysts say.
   Digital, looking to bounce back after reporting flat earnings
for its latest quarter, on Tuesday introduced its second line of
new systems in the last two months.
   ``It's a good move for DEC,'' said Bruce Watts, an analyst with
Needham & Co. ``It was time for them to upgrade their mid-range of
systems.''
   Digital officials said the new VAX 6200 series is designed to
compete with IBM's existing 9370 and 4381 computer.
   ``It's partly intended to place them in a strongly competitive
position when IBM announces its code-named Silverlake products this
summer,'' Watts said. ``DEC is getting their products out into the
market first in order to prevent IBM from taking customers away.''
   Digital, based in Maynard, Mass., is the world's second-largest
computer company and considered the industry leader in
mid-performance range computers.
   The announcement came one week after Digital reported a 0.8
percent decrease in profits for the latest quarter while IBM
announced a 16.3 percent rise, reversing a two-year trend in the
battle between the companies.
   Digital stock rose 12{ cents to $101.12{ a share in composite
New York Stock Exchange trading Tuesday.
   The new computers, which will cost between $131,600 and
$653,200, will be available immediately, Digital said.
   Digital last month introduced several mainframe computers in its
VAX 8800 series in a direct challenge to IBM.
   Sonny Monosson, a Boston-based independent analyst, said the new
series provides high performance and processing capacity for a low
price.
   ``I think this price performance is significant,'' he said.
``IBM and (Digital) are competing and this is a good price
performance.''
   Monosson said the competition between the two giants could have
a side effect on smaller companies in the mid-range computer
market, such as Prime Computer and Data General Inc.
   ``The byproduct of all this IBM-DEC competition is going to hurt
all the other vendors,'' he said.
   The company said the single-processor 6210 computer provides 2.8
times the performance of its VAX 11@780 system. The system can
accommodate up to four processors at once.
   Upgrades will cost between $100,200 and $173,500, Digital said.

   Grumman Corp.'s planned expansion here is
evidence that oil-dependent Houston is trying to get more involved
in aircraft and aerospace industries, according to a local
development official.
   Grumman officials said Tuesday the company's Southwest Regional
Development and Production Center will be built on a 66-acre parcel
of land, and will include an office building and several other
structures.
   The project will mean 1,000 new jobs in the next year and an
initial investment of $10 million over two years.
   ``Grumman feels betting a large part of our company future on
Houston is a good bet,'' J.J. Bussolini, Grumman vice president for
business operations, said at a news conference.
   Lee Hogan, president of the Houston Economic Development
Council, said Tuesday's announcement illustrated Houston's efforts
to get involved in aircraft and aerospace industries.
   ``We are now as interested in that as the price of oil,'' he
said.
   Bussolini said Grumman was convinced to select Houston with
incentives to locate at Ellington Field, a strong work ethic shown
by employees at its existing Houston operations, an excellent pool
of potential employees and cost savings for construction and
operations of new facilities compared with other parts of the
country.
   Grumman, an aircraft and aerospace company with annual sales of
more than $3.5 billion, now employs about 500 people in Houston and
33,000 people worldwide.
   Grumman said work in Houston will include civil space programs,
manufacturing and development on Air Force missile programs and
engineering support for Grumman programs throughout the country.
   None of the new Houston jobs would be the result of transfers
from other Grumman facilities, Bussolini said. Company officials
said Houston's job count could grow to 2,000 or more, depending on
the outcome of several NASA and Defense Department programs.
   The Bethpage, N.Y.-based company selected Houston from among
other potential sites in Pennsylvania, North and South Carolina,
Georgia and Alabama.
   The new center will be built on land Grumman leased last year
from the city at Ellington Field, a former Air Force base now owned
by the city.
   The land originally was earmarked for Grumman's civil space unit
for NASA space station work, but NASA selected rival bidder
McDonnell Douglas Corp. for the job.
   The new project culminates efforts by officials of the Houston
Economic Development Council.
   ``The loss of the space station contract was a serious setback
to our corporate plan,'' Bussolini said, but added that Houston
officials kept encouraging the company to add to its presence in
the city.

<HEAD>Kodak to Sell and Service IBM Copiers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH PICHT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>

   International Business Machines Corp.
says it isn't getting out of the copier busienss in agreeing to
have Eastman Kodak Co. sell and service IBM copiers, but the
computer giant acknowledges copiers are not as crucial to it as in
the past.
   Kodak will take over existing rental agreements and within a
year will replace the IBM nameplate on the company's three machines
with a Kodak logo, IBM spokesman Andy Russell said Tuesday.
   Kodak will continue selling its Ektaprint line of copiers, some
of which directly compete with IBM machines. Kodak already sells a
Canon-made copier under its Ektaprint brand.
   ``Copiers are not as crucial as they were in the past. They're
not attachable to our systems, but today our emphasis is on
integrating systems ... personal computers and printers,'' Russell
said.
   However, Russell said from the company's headquarters in Armonk,
N.Y., that IBM would continue utilizing its copier development and
manufacturing abilities. He also said that giving up the copier
sales and service aspects would allow IBM to concentrate on
computers and printers.
   Kodak, IBM and Xerox Corp. are the dominant copier companies in
the expensive, high-volume, copying segment, according to industry
statistics compiled by Dataquest Inc., a San Jose, Calif.-based
market research firm.
   Of the 29,400 machines owned or rented last year in the segment,
which includes machines that make 70 or more copies a minute, Xerox
had 14,400, IBM had 6,000 and Kodak had 4,700.
   Kodak and IBM also sell copiers that operate in the mid-volume
range of 45 to 69 copies a minute, said Mary Lou Demers, a copier
industry analyst at Dataquest.
   The agreement announced Tuesday, which must be approved by
federal regulators, pertains only to machines in the United States.
Negotiations for a similar agreement in other countries are under
way.
   For Kodak, the deal is a great chance to grab IBM's loyal
customer base, something the photo giant and others have been
unsuccessfully trying to do for years, said Demers.
   ``It will be interesting to see what happens as the sales
agreements run out and it's time to renew,'' Demers said. ``We'll
see if Kodak can retain that same loyalty.''
   She said she was not surprised at Tuesday's announcement.
   ``People in the industry have been wondering for several years
whether IBM was either going to introduce some brand new machine or
get out of the business,'' Demers said.

<HEAD>Sears To Test Free-Standing Auto Centers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sears, Roebuck and Co., which is acquiring
Western Auto Supply Co., will test a further expansion of its
automotive operations with a new chain of free-standing auto
service centers, according to a company spokesman.
   The free-standing centers generally will be smaller than those
attached to 797 Sears stores but will offer a similar array of
services, including oil changes, tire installation and suspension
repairs, spokesman Gordon Jones said Tuesday.
   Specific dates, numbers of stores and locations have not been
determined, Jones said. The centers will carry the Sears name, he
said.
   ``The purpose of this test is to appeal to a broader range of
motorist customers,'' he said.
   The Chicago Sun-Times reported Tuesday that Sears, the nation's
largest retailer, would open 50 to 100 of the new outlets annually,
each about 5,000 square feet in size with up to six service bays.
The newspaper attributed the information to retail sources it did
not identify.
   Industry analysts said the free-standing centers would
complement Sears' acquisition of Kansas City, Mo.-based Western
Auto, which Sears said last month it would acquire in a $402
million deal.
   ``It's a good fit with Western Auto,'' said Don Wampach of
Oberweis Securities. ``It could tie those two operations together.''
   Wampach said there was room for growth in the auto-care market,
especially with K mart, the nation's No. 2 retailer, no longer
including auto service bays in its new stores.

<HEAD>Chrysler Seeks Minimum Age for Early Retirement</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JANET BRAUNSTEIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HIGHLAND PARK, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   United Auto Workers negotiators will
not give up ground the union has won in past contracts, a top UAW
official said after Chrysler Corp. proposed limiting the age at
which workers may get early retirement benefits.
   ``We aren't taking any concessions...we aren't going to tolerate
any takeaways,'' UAW Vice President Marc Stepp said Tuesday.
   The union and the nation's third-largest automaker entered their
third day of talks today over a contract covering about 66,000
active and laid-off workers in 15 states and 65,000 retirees.
   Negotiators attempting to fit to Chrysler an industry pattern
contract established last fall at General Motors Corp. and Ford
Motor Co.
   Stepp declined to comment further on Chrysler contract proposals
presented Tuesday, including the cost-cutting early retirement
changes that are expected to meet opposition from labor.
   UAW workers won the right to retire early after 30 years of
service during General Motors Corp. talks in 1970 after a 69-day
strike. The right was limited to workers 58 or older, with the
minimum age lowered to 56 in 1972.
   But the age minimum was eliminated in 1973 after a nine-day
strike against Chrysler and workers are not expected to accept a
floor on early retirement easily.
   Anthony St. John, the Chrysler vice president who is the
automaker's chief negotiator, said Chrysler wanted the minimum
early retirement age and union support for flexible work agreements
_ both changes from the pattern contract, because:
   _Chrysler is smaller than GM and Ford so its costs to produce
each car and truck are higher. St. John estimated the pattern
contract would cost Chrysler $3 to $3.50 more an hour than it costs
GM and 50 cents more an hour than it costs Ford.
   _Chrysler's work force is aging rapidly, with an average age o
44. It has only 1.1 active workers supporting each retiree.
   _Chrysler doesn't need to trim its work force as much as GM and
Ford and would rather keep its already trained workers on the job
during more of their prime. Under so-called ``30-and-out''
retirements, a worker who entered the factory at age 18 can retire
at age 48 and receive $1,350 a month in pension payments.
   St. John said Chrysler's new proposal would set a minimum age
such as 55 for 30-and-out retirements.
   ``We need to overcome those natural disadvantages by enhancing
our ability to compete with them as well as the transplants and the
foreign competition,'' St. John said. The so-called transplants are
Japanese-owned factories in the United States, which by 1990 will
be capable of producing at least 2.5 million vehicles annually.
   UAW and Chrysler officials expect to complete a new contract in
two to three weeks. If they are successful, the new contract will
replace the old three-year pact before its scheduled Sept. 14
expiration.
   Chrysler also wants UAW leaders to support the company's push
for Modern Operating Agreements, or plant contracts that organize
workers into teams and give the company flexibility in using
workers.
   Six plants have adopted MOAs and Chrysler wants similar
agreements at all its other plants. But many workers believe the
team concept, which reduces the need for workers who fill in for
absentees, inspect products and repair others' mistakes, reduces
job security.
   Most MOAs have been adopted under threat of a plant closing or
loss of work to other plants.

<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar fell back today against the
Japanese yen in Tokyo, while stock prices made a healthy rebound.
   The dollar finished at 123.90 yen, down 0.47 yen from its close
of 124.37 yen Tuesday. It had opened the day at 124.08 yen and
fluctuated between 123.85 yen and 124.09 yen.
   ``The market was quiet and the dollar traded in a narrow range
throughout the day,'' said Michiko Kawai of the Bank of Tokyo.
   Selling pressure was not strong as participants were nervous
about intervention by the Bank of Japan, she said.
   Traders said the central bank bought a modest amount of dollars
during morning trade. The bank does not officially comment on its
market activity.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
issues, a modest 14.45-point loser Tuesday, gained 207.09 points,
or 0.77 percent, to end the day at 26,864.09.
   ``The setback during the past three trading days made share
prices reasonable for investors,'' said an official of a major
securities company, who demanded anonymity.
   The Nikkei index lost 454.35 points between last Friday and
Tuesday.
   ``The stabilized U.S. dollar and firmness on Wall Street also
made investors optimistic,'' the brokerage official said, adding
that the overnight easing in New York was not seen in Tokyo as a
loss of its strength.
   The market also got a boost from the perception among many
investors that Japan's major brokerages will support the market any
time the Nikkei index fall too far from the 27,000-point level,
traders said.
   Trading was moderately active with volume of the first section
trade at 1 billion shares, up from 600 million shares Tuesday.
Advacing issues outpaced decliners 595 to 305, while 156 issues
were unchanged.
   Steels, electricals and autos were popular. Drugs, foodstuffs
and shippings rose. Losers include oils, nonferrous metals and some
of the constructions.

   Ford Motor Co. is recalling about 106,000 1984
Ranger and Bronco II trucks to bring their emissions control
systems into compliance with federal regulations, the government
and Ford said.
   The Environmental Protection Agency said Tuesday the recall
affects only the trucks with 2.8-liter engines and automatic
transmissions. California trucks, which are built to meet different
emissions standards, are not involved.
   The EPA said its tests had discovered the trucks' exhausts put
out hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide in excess of federal
regulations, but the agency was unable to identify a defective
component or part failure as the cause.
   ``Ford has agreed to adjust the choke and ignition timing to new
specifications and install new carburetor metering jets to bring
the trucks into compliance with the standards,'' the EPA said.

<HEAD>Housing Starts Up; Stocks Decline</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: grafs 1-5 new to UPDATE with consumer prices report; picks up
2nd graf pvs: The department ...</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Consumer prices, propelled by a record rise in clothing costs,
shot up 0.5 percent in March, the biggest increase since January
1987, the Labor Department said today.
   The overall gain _ amounting to 6.4 percent on an annual basis _
seemed sure to further economists' concerns that inflation may be
rebounding.
   Besides the 2.0 percent jump in apparel costs, retail prices
were also driven upward by a 0.4 percent gain in gasoline costs,
the first rise since August, and a 0.3 percent hike in food prices.
   Taken together, clothing, food and transportation price
increases accounted for half the March jump, which was more than
double the 0.2 percent gain of February.
   But in the housing sector, a sharp rise in construction of
single-family homes in March more than offset a decline in
apartment construction, according to the Commerce Department.
   The department reported Tuesday that housing starts rose 1.9
percent overall to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.54
million units in March after a 9.6 percent advance in February.
   The report didn't help the stock market, which finished
generally lower after a daylong rally faded.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 blue-chip stocks finished down 8.62
at 1,999.50, after being up by 32 points at midafternoon. Most
broader market indices also fell.
   Mark Obrinsky, an economist with the U.S. League of Savings
Institutions, said the back-to-back rises in housing starts
indicated the housing industry has recovered from its slump in
December and January.
   Housing starts plummeted 15.8 percent in December and drifted
another 1.2 percent lower in January. Analysts attributed the
decline to builders' fears that the October stock market crash
would dampen home buying and to the pre-crash buildup in mortgage
interest rates.
   ``Whatever problems there might have been in the worst of the
winter months, housing seems to have recovered pretty much,''
Obrinsky said. ``It's not going to be a boom year for housing, but
the decline from last year should be pretty moderate.''
   Housing construction hit an eight-year high of 1.81 million
units in 1986 and fell 10 percent in 1987. Analysts are projecting
another 4 percent to 8 percent decline this year.
   Rates for 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages, which shot up above
11.5 percent before the stock market crash, dipped below 10 percent
in February and March before rising to 10.19 percent last week.
Economists are projecting rates of about 11 percent by the end of
the year.
   The strength in starts last month came in construction of
single-family housing, which rose 7.1 percent to a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of 1.18 million units after an even stronger
8.9 percent climb in February.
   Construction of multi-family units fell 12.3 percent to an
annual rate of 358,000 units. The construction of buildings with
five or more units was at its lowest rate since June 1982, during
the last recession.
   Apartment construction has been slumping because the new tax law
passed in 1986 removed many of the tax shelter benefits of
investing in real estate. The old law also had encouraged
overbuilding in some areas.

<TEXT>
   Chevron Corp. is changing its 1986 profit
to a $1.4 billion loss and is raising its 1987 profit from $1
billion to $1.25 billion because of a routine bookkeeping
requirement.
   The oil company said on Tuesday the change was needed to meet
the provisions of the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 96 which was approved by the Accounting Standards Board last
December.
   Because of the change, the company had to restate its 1986 and
1987 earnings, resulting in the 1986 net loss and an increase in
1987 profits.
   The accounting change resulted from Chevron's 1984 acquisition
of Gulf Oil.
   The change led the company to post the $1.4 billion net loss for
1986 instead of the previously announced $715 million net profit
and a $1.25 billion profit for 1987 instead of the previous $1
billion.

<HEAD>Japan Making Strides To Halt Technology Violations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan has made great strides in trying to prevent
sales of banned high technology items to Soviet bloc countries, but
there still is a potential for further violations, a U.S. State
Department official said Wednesday.
   Allan Wendt, senior representative for strategic technology
policy, spent two days discussing issues related to the
Coordinating Committee for Export to Communist Nations, which
governs the sales of restricted items by Western countries.
   The talks included Japanese concerns that the U.S. Congress will
retaliate against Toshiba Machine Co. for selling banned equipment
to the Soviet Union that enabled the Soviets to build quieter
submarines, Wendt said.
   The two sides also discussed improvements in the Japanese export
system, cooperation in implementing export controls and cooperative
areas of enforcement, plus streamlining control lists, cooperation
from third countries and the liberalization of export controls for
China.
   Wendt said Japan has enacted a new law that toughens the
penalties against violators, and said 2,200 Japanese companies have
established internal controls to prevent further violations.
   ``I certainly hope there will never be another Toshiba
Machine-type case, which everyone knows was an egregious
violation,'' he said. ``I think there will continue to be
violations of the COCOM rules. I think it would be unrealistic not
to expect violations ... Human greed has been with us for a long
time and is unlikely to disappear,'' he said.
   Wendt said Japan ``has come a long way in a short period of
time,'' but that work is still needed to make sure progress
continues.
   Wendt acknowledged there were problems with systems like Japan's
where the Ministry of International Trade and Industry is in charge
of promoting trade and handling inspections at the same time. He
said it was better to have different agencies within government
responsible for different areas.
   But Wendt added that it would take time for Japan to make the
necessary changes, much as it took the United States several years
to make corrections following similar violations in the 1970s.

<HEAD>EEC Ministers End First Round Price Talks in Disagreement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LUXEMBOURG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   European Economic Community agriculture
ministers Wednesday ended the first round of their 1988-89 farm
price talks at odds over subsidies to farmers in three
weak-currency nations, officials said.
   Ireland, France and Italy refused to end the EEC's ``green
currency'' system of border subsidies and taxes that even out
currency fluctuations, officials said.
   Under its farm price package for the 1988-89 marketing year that
began April 1, the EEC Commission has proposed to end these
subsidies and levies on intra-EEC farm trade, except for Greece.
   A Commission official said retaining subsidies for farmers in
other weak-currency nations would require extra funds the
near-bankrupt EEC does not have.
   ``The Commission, for budgetary reasons, cannot give in to
specific requests'' to retain the subsidies, he said. ``We are
ready to seek a reasonable compromise but only on the price package
in its entirety.''
   The comment reflected the Commission's determination to defend
its 1988-89 price package that began April 1. The package was put
together under orders of the government leaders of the 12 EEC
nations.
   The Commission seeks to limit spending on subsidies for the
EEC's 10.3 million farmers to 27.5 billion European currency units,
or $33.8 billion dollars, this year.
   This is the same as in 1987 and follows years of runaway
spending led to over-production and trade frictions with the United
States.
   The farm ministers formally agreed to impose ``stabilizers'' on
EEC's farm spending. Agreed to by the EEC summit meeting last
February, these will curb production as soon as output levels and
spending reach a fixed level.
   The ministers opened their first round of discussions on the
1988-89 price package Monday. The meeting ended early Wednesday and
a second round will be held May 16-17 in Brussels.
   ``It is premature to expect the ministers will reach a common
agreement by then,'' the Commission official said.
   In recent years, the farm price talks have dragged on for many
months in often round-the-clock meetings with the ministers wearing
each other down to get concessions. The negotiations have rarely
been concluded before April 1 when the new marketing yuear begins
for some products.
   Officials said they expected this year's negotiations to be
completed in early June.

<HEAD>Plan Lower Tariffs, Taxes On Foreign Cars</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government plans to lower tariffs
on imported cars and reduce several domestic taxes on foreign
vehicles to those on domestic automobiles, Trade and Industry
Ministry officials said Wednesday.
   The officials said the measures, contained in plans presented
Tuesday during a meeting with members of the South Korean auto
industry, were designed to avoid trade friction with other
countries and increase the competitiveness of local carmakers.
   They did not say when the proposed measures would take effect.
   The United States has accused South Korea of imposing
discriminatory restrictions on American cars while enjoying free
access to the U.S. auto market.
   South Korea responded earlier this month by lifting its ban on
imports of foreign cars _ but imposed high tariffs and bureaucratic
red tape.
   The ministry now plans to lower import duties from the present
30 percent to 25 percent next year, to 20 percent in 1990 and to 15
percent in 1992, the officials said, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   They said the plans also call for reducing the local acquisition
tax on the foreign cars from the present 30 percent to 2 percent,
the same as for domestic automobiles. Car operation and licence
taxes for foreign cars may also be cut under the plans.
   Also, car owners now must buy the equivalent of $4,030 in
government bonds when registering a foreign automobile, and the
officials said that may be abolished or drastically reduced.
   For small South Korean cars, the bond purchase is about 270,000
won, or $364, although about 1.6 million won, or $2,160, in bonds
are required to register costlier local automobiles. The bonds
mature in five years.
   Meanwhile, officials said the ministry would encourage domestic
car makers to buy more U.S. parts and components.
   Also, new car makers _ both wholly owned local companies and
those with foreign partners _ will be allowed to operate beginning
in mid-1989.
   A July 1986 law banned joint production to avoid over-production
of automobiles, and this kept the Samsung business group from
starting a car manufacturing plant together with Chrysler Corp. of
the United States.
   There are now three large and two small car makers in South
Korea with a combined annual production capacity of 1.1 million
vehicles. They exported a total of 540,000 cars last year, most of
which went to the United States and Canada.

   Advancing issues slightly outnumbered declines in NYSE composite
trading, with 789 up, 733 down and 466 unchanged. Big Board volume

   Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita warned
Wednesday that currency and financial markets should not overreact
to monthly U.S. trade data and stressed that the U.S. international
trade performance is still improving.
   Speaking at a regularly scheduled press conference, Sumita said
his assessment about the U.S. trade performance is based on a
sustained decline in its trade deficit in terms of volume.
   ``The U.S. trade balance should also show an improvement in
terms of value in the future,'' he added.
   Sumita also reiterated that there is no change in the dollar's
undertone, despite its recent volatility triggered by last week's
release of a disappointing $13.8 billion trade deficit for February.

   Norway will not attend next week's meeting
of OPEC and independent oil-producing nations in Vienna, Austria,
but will send an observer, a Petroleum Ministry official said
Wednesday.
   The ministry's general director of marketing, Tore Tonne, will
monitor the conference and hold bilateral talks with
representatives of some of the 12 or 13 countries expected to
participate, said ministry spokesman Egil Helle.
   The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries'
price-monitoring committee _ comprised of the oil ministers of
Saudi Arabia, Nigeria, Venezuela, Algeria and Indonesia _ decided
earlier this month to invite at least seven non-OPEC oil producers
to meet for discussions on ways of cooperating to stabilize world
oil prices.
   The conference is expected to consider joint cuts in oil
production.
   A spokesman at OPEC headquarters in Vienna, James Audu, said
Wednesday that he had no information on which non-OPEC countries
had agreed to attend the meeting, which begins next Tuesday. He
said Mexico, Egypt, China, Colombia, Angola, Malaysia, Brunei and
Oman had been invited.
   Helle, the oil ministry spokesman, said Norway was not invited
to participate in the Vienna meeting, mainly because it made it
clear to OPEC officials through informal contacts that it did not
want to attend.
   Helle said Norway's policy was not to participate in formal
agreements or multilateral talks with OPEC or other oil-producing
nations but to assist in stabilizing oil markets by taking
unilateral measures.
   Helle said Norway nonetheless was pleased that the Vienna
meeting had been arranged.
   ``We regard it as very positive that more exporting countries
outside OPEC are showing a willingness to contribute to stabilizing
oil prices,'' he said in a telephone interview.
   Norway has been holding its oil production 7.5 percent below
capacity since February 1987 as a unilateral measure designed to
help OPEC support prices. Helle said Norway was not considering any
additional measures.

   American Telephone & Telegraph Co.'s board
elected President Robert E. Allen as chairman and chief executive
officer to succeed James E. Olson, who died from cancer two days
ago, the company said today.
   AT&T also announced today its profit rose 10.6 percent in the
first quarter to $492 million.
   Allen, 53, had been serving as acting chairman since Olson's
death and was considered a clear favorite to succeed the man who
guided AT&T out of the confusion surrounding the 1984 breakup of
the Bell System.
   The company said the board made its choice Tuesday night. The
board named no successor for Allen as president.
   ``I fully intend to continue leading AT&T on the course Jim set
out for us,'' Allen said in a statement. ``The other officers and I
concurred in the basic strategies Jim laid out in 1986 and they are
no less worthy today than they were at that time.''
   AT&T said its first-quarter profit equaled 46 cents per share,
up from $445 million, or 40 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue
rose 2.8 percent to $8.35 billion, from $8.12 billion a year
earlier.
   At a news conference, Allen said it was the company's ``firm
commitment'' to keep profits growing through 1988 at the first
quarter rate.
   He also promised to carry on the legacy of Olson.
   Allen was born in Missouri, grew up in Indiana and joined
Indiana Bell in 1957 after being graduated from Wabash College in
Indiana.
   He later worked in managerial posts there and at Bell of
Pennsylvania, Illinois Bell and the Chesapeake and Potomac
Telephone companies.
   He became executive vice president and chief financial officer
of AT&T in July 1983, and assumed the duties of AT&T president and
chief operating officer in September 1986.
   Olson died early Monday at age 62 of colon cancer, less than a
month after undergoing surgery for removal of a tumor from his
colon. He had been in the job 20 months.
   Olson was a forceful and tenacious leader. Allen conceded that
he is not perceived as a dynamic speaker but said he was working on
his delivery.
   Allen said his management ability and his willingness to
delegate responsibility were among his greatest strengths.
   ``First and foremost, I'm a team player,'' he said.
   In addition to receiving a report from Allen, shareholders were
to complete voting on a pair of resolutions regarding affirmative
action.
   A resolution urging AT&T to phase out its affirmative action
policies, which involve the hiring and promotion of minorities and
women, was made by the National Alliance, a white supremacist
organization.
   AT&T has urged shareholders to vote against the National
Alliance resolution. But it also has opposed a resolution urging
more affirmative action, introduced by Alex Tillman, a black
manager at Bell Laboratories.
   Members of a local of AT&T's largest union, the Communication
Workers of America, said they planned a ``rally against racism''
outside today's meeting.
   Speculation on who would succeed Allen as president centered on
Randall Tobias, 45, youngest of AT&T's vice chairman. The other
vice chairmen, Morris Tanenbaum, 59, and Charles Marshall, 58, were
expected to remain in their current posts.

   Dow Chemical Co. said Wednesday its
first-quarter profit doubled from a year ago and credited increases
in prices and volume for the improvement.
   The company earned $507 million, or $2.67 a share, in the first
three months of 1988 compared with $246 million, or $1.28 a share,
a year earlier.
   First-quarter sales rose 32 percent to $3.98 billion from $3.02
billion a year earlier.
   ``Every business group contributed to these outstanding
results,'' Dow President Frank Popoff said. ``Demand was strong in
both the specialty and basic businesses.''
   The company said sales of its foundation products _ basic
plastics and chemicals _ set sales records of $798 million in
plastics and $1.34 billion in basic chemicals during the period.
   Quarterly sales of pharmaceuticals, agricultural, consumer and
industrial specialty products also set records, Dow said.
   Popoff said the company's costs remain stable and volume has
increased, adding there is no weakness apparent in the product
lines or geographical areas.

   To the victor belong the spoils, except in the
merger business these days, where even some losing bidders have
taken home a cut of the pot.
   The list of ``losers'' in some recent takeover battles includes
names like developer Donald Trump, appliance maker Whirlpool Corp.
and retailing giant R.H. Macy & Co.
   But it's not as if these players walked away empty-handed.
   Where vanquished raiders once faded from the scene with legal
scars or a cash consolation prize, players now are demanding assets
_ and getting them in the form of real estate, trademark rights,
even factories.
   It's all a matter of saving money and saving face. Winners don't
like running up the price of their acquisitions in a bidding war
any more than losers like getting shut out.
   So while some rivals might turn up their noses to the idea of
settling for half a loaf, other more creative competitors are
discovering that strategic advantage can be gained by carving up
the pie.
   ``I think we will see more (negotiated settlements) in larger
transactions where there are pieces that may be of different value
to different players,'' said Robert Willard, head of mergers and
acquisitions at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   Trump's recent struggle with entertainer Merv Griffin over
Resorts International Inc. is a case in point. The New York
developer had been trying to take the gaming and casino concern
private since January and was less than genteel when Griffin began
publicly outlining his own strategy for acquiring the company.
   ``It got a little testy, indeed,'' said one observer involved in
the deal.
   But after weeks of public jousting, the two met in Trump's
office, where it took just a few hours to sketch out a deal.
Advisers and lawyers worked into the evening, and Trump and Griffin
were able to formalize the terms the next day by phone.
   ``Without that face-to-face meeting, there may well have been no
deal,'' said Jack Nusbaum, Trump's attorney, who called the
settlement a ``terrific result.''
   Trump got what he said he wanted all along _ the Taj Mahal
casino under construction in Atlantic City, N.J., and Griffin got
the rest of the company in part by purchasing Trump's controlling
interest for an undisclosed price.
   ``It's a rational way of resolving a situation rather than
having, at the end of the day, prolonged the uncertainty,'' one top
takeover lawyer said.
   In another case this past week, fabric maker West
Point-Pepperell Inc. and the investment firm Odyssey Partners sat
down at the bargaining table after waging an extended bidding war
for textile giant J.P. Stevens & Co.
   Hammering out an agreement to divvy up the goods is a quick way
to stop bids from escalating, even though boards of directors want
to keep the auction going for as long as possible to get the best
price for their shareholders.
   ``Boards are more reluctant to accept one offer and lock out
other bids,'' said Willard of Prudential-Bache.
   Rival bidders, however, have an interest in ``limiting their
exposure from paying a higher price. A negotiated settlement may
result in your accomplishing your objective at a lower net cost,''
noted one takeover expert.
   Michael Hoffman, senior vice president at Smith Barney, Harris
Upham & Co., said in some cases it is ``the ego factor (that) can
keep the bidding going to a point where the numbers don't make
sense.'' Many observers say that was the case in Canadian Robert
Campeau's battle for Federated Department Stores Inc.
   Like most protracted takeover scenarios, Campeau's skirmishes
with Macy occurred largely in the courtroom. Investment banking and
legal fees were estimated to total at least $200 million, involving
a battalion of more than 200 investment bankers and lawyers.
   ``It does make sense to reach an accommodation with a competing
bidder, otherwise you can litigate forever,'' said one lawyer
involved in a recent takeover who spoke on the condition of
anonymity.
   Campeau got the company for $6.6 billion, but an agreement to
sell two prized Federated operations to Macy for $1.1 billion
allowed both companies to walk away as winners.
   The alternative would have been for the bidders to ``just offer
a higher price, assuming it can be financed,'' said one lawyer
involved in the deal.``But Macy's and Campeau both are rather thin
in terms of financing.''
   The meeting of rival bidders, or their attempts to meet, happens
often, insiders say.
   ``Those sorts of feelers are thrown out quite frequently in
transactions that make business sense. The only difference is that
these companies have reached agreements,'' said one takeover lawyer.
   A negotiated agreement sometimes allows even the losing party to
say it achieved its goals. After splitting the spoils of the Roper
Corp. with General Electric Corp., Whirlpool Chairman David Whitwam
was quick to note that ``gaining the Roper brand name was one of
Whirlpool's key strategic objectives'' in going after the Georgia
appliance maker in the first place.
   Roper had signed a definitive agreement to be acquired by
Whirlpool before General Electric came on the scene. GE, known for
its deep pockets, ultimately offered $507 million, topping
Whirlpool's best bid by about $37 million.
   Whirlpool called GE shortly before its offer was about to
expire, and there was ``a very prompt resolution to the
situation,'' said one lawyer involved in the deal. Indeed, an
agreement was unveiled a day after the two companies said they were
holding discussions.
   Among the terms of the agreement, GE gets Roper and its
manufacturing operations, while Whirlpool will acquire rights to
the Roper name for major appliances.
   ``Part of it is how you portray the settlement to the world, and
everyone likes a winner,'' said one attorney involved in a recent
hostile bid.
   Willard of Prudential-Bache predicted that more takeover battles
would result in negotiated settlements, particularly those that
involve large, multi-dimensional targets.
   ``To the extent that the target keeps an auction going, there's
going to be more talking among rivals,'' he said.

<HEAD>Despite Parallels To 1986, Repeat Oil Crash Seen Unlikely</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ In the chaotic kitchen of global oil
politics, OPEC is cooking with some of the same ingredients it used
in 1985-86 to serve up history's most spectacular oil price flop.
   This time, however, the recipe includes some less explosive
elements, and experts say this means a remake of the price crash is
unlikely.
   For consumers, that means the retail price of gasoline and other
products refined from crude oil may be fairly steady this summer.
   New clues to the future direction of oil prices are expected to
emerge from two meetings of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries this week. On Tuesday, a five-man OPEC panel will meet
with representatives of several non-OPEC oil producing nations, and
on Thursday, all 13 cartel members are to open private talks.
   In some significant ways, OPEC's current struggle to stop
free-market forces from pushing down oil prices is unfolding much
as it did three years ago.
   The most obvious similarity is that OPEC once again is losing
the battle; the world price of oil has been below the cartel's
target level of $18 per 42-gallon barrel for much of this year.
   Beyond that, there are these parallels:
   _Saudi Arabia, the cartel's biggest producer, is going it alone.
   In mid-1985, Saudi King Fahd declared he no longer would let
Saudi production decline while other OPEC members were cheating on
price and output rules. This was the beginning of the end of OPEC's
attempts to regulate the world price. Last month, Fahd publicly
reasserted this policy, meaning, if effect, that the cartel had
again lost hope of single-handedly defending a fixed oil price.
   _Key OPEC members, including Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Indonesia,
appear to have decided the cartel should stop fighting the price
decline by cutting production. When this feeling became widespread
in OPEC in late 1985, the result was a kind of anarchy. OPEC hoped
to win back part of its market share from non-OPEC producers, but
it did not expect the stunning price collapse that followed.
   This time, however, the memory of what happened in 1986 _ when
prices tumbled below $10 a barrel _ is likely to persuade the
cartel leadership to at least keep existing production controls in
place. Also, Iran is more aggressively fighting to retain the OPEC
strategy of cutting production.
   _OPEC is turning to independent producers for help in limiting
oil production.
   When prices were falling gradually in early 1985, OPEC saw that
its production cuts were too little. Unable or unwilling to cut
more, the cartel stepped up efforts to win restraint from non-OPEC
producers. Oil ministers from Mexico, Egypt, Malaysia and other
independent oil-producing nations attended several OPEC meetings in
1984-85 as observers, but the contacts yielded few results. By 1986
the outsiders had stopped coming to the OPEC meetings.
   This week OPEC is returning to this tactic. Its price-monitoring
committee _ comprised of the oil ministers of Saudi Arabia,
Nigeria, Venezuela, Algeria and Indonesia _ is to meet with
representatives of several non-OPEC producers, including Mexico and
Egypt, to press for cooperation in limiting production.
   In OPEC's view, all oil producers share a responsibility for
restraining production in order to keep prices high enough to
justify the level of investment needed to find oil supplies for the
future.
   Many non-OPEC countries don't agree. The world's two largest oil
producers, the Soviet Union and the United States, and major
producers Britain and Norway will not be attending the Vienna
meeting.
   The chances of OPEC and independent producers reaching agreement
any time soon on joint production cuts appear slim. In the event
they are unsuccessful the key question is: What will OPEC do next?
   In 1985, the cartel's response to getting a cold shoulder from
non-OPEC was to declare an unofficial ``price war.'' This time that
is much less likely to happen, given the severe financial wounds
that OPEC member countries have suffered in recent years.
   The odds of OPEC letting prices fall uncontrollably also are
lessened by the fact that prices, adjusted for inflation and the
depreciation of the U.S. dollar, already are as low as they were in
1986.
   The outlook for OPEC is further clouded by growing friction
within the cartel. Relations between the Saudis and Iranians have
been at a low ebb since riots in the Islamic holy city of Mecca, in
Saudi Arabia, last summer killed 402 people, including 275 Iranians.
   The political climate between Iran and its Persian Gulf
neighbors has worsened this spring with Iranian gunboat attacks on
United Arab Emirate shipping and oil facilities in the Gulf and the
hijacking of a Kuwait Airways plane by Shiite Moslem gunmen
demanding the release of 17 pro-Iranian terrorists held in Kuwait.

<HEAD>Grain, Soybean Future Open Mostly Lower</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures opened mostly lower
today on the Chicago Board of Trade as concerns about dry weather
faded from the pits.
   Reports of unusually dry conditions in the central and northern
Plains gave the grain markets a scare Tuesday and drove prices up.
But those fears evaporated today on forecasts for rain in the
affected areas.
   ``Basically we had a little bit of a weather-type move yesterday
but traders who had been buying on that information are having
second thoughts this morning,'' said Walter Spilka, an analyst in
New York with Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co.
   Spilka said it was early in the season to be worried about
weather damage to corn and soybeans. Planting of those crops is
barely underway.
   But analysts say the weather is likely to figure strongly in
price movement this season because of market fears about tight
supplies of corn and soybeans.
   In early trading, wheat was unchanged to } cent lower with May
at $3.13{ a bushel; corn was \ cent to { cent lower with May at
$2.05\ a bushel; oats were 1} cents to 2 cents lower with May at

   Banca Commerciale Italiana, Italy's second
largest bank, has revised its cash tender bid for Irving Bank Corp.
by raising the price per share by $10 but lowering its proposed
stake in the company, both banks announced today.
   At the same time, Irving's plans to boost its annual dividend to
$4.50 a share from $2.42 next month were left in doubt after the
Federal Reserve objected to an increase to that level.
   The revised Banca Commerciale offer _ part of a complex
restructuring plan aimed at thwarting a hostile takeover bid by
Bank of New York Co. _ calls for the Italian bank to pay $75 a
share for 8.5 million shares, or 45 percent of Irving.
   The original proposal, announced on Monday, was for $65 a share
for 9.5 million shares, or about 51 percent of the outstanding
shares.
   Bank of New York is offering $15 in cash and 1.575 of its common
shares for each of Irving's roughly 18.1 million common shares
outstanding. It began its tender offer last month after receiving
approval from the Fed and New York State Banking Board.
   Bank of New York, which holds a 4.9 percent stake in Irving, is
also running a slate of 16 nominees to Irving's board of directors.
   Irving Chairman Joseph A. Rice said the amended offer would
provide shareholders with ``substantially more value than the offer
by the Bank of New York Co., and we urge our shareholders to reject
the BNY offer'' at the annual shareholders' meeting on Saturday.
   In a statement, Irving said Banca Commericiale ``believes that
the $75 per share cash prices of the revised offer better refelects
the overall value of IBC (Irving Bank Corp.) common stock through
market purchases.''
   But Bank of New York spokesman Owen Brady maintained the revised
offer ``in our opinion is worse as a whole, is worse especially for
small sharehodlers.''
   ``It's a typical front-end load deal,'' he said. ``They're
putting a lot of stuff up front, and it's uncertain whether some of
the benefits ... will ever be realized.''
   In midday trading on the New York stock exchange, Irving stock
was unchanged at $60.75 a share while Bank of New York was up 12{
cents to $31.50.
   Irving's retructuring plan included the sale of some assets,
including its 50-story Wall Street headquarters, the increased
annual dividend and several cost-cutting mesures. In addition, a
special $10-a-share dividend would be payable to shareholders upon
completion of the Banca Commerciale deal.
   Irving said it hoped to raise net income by about $1.60 a share
in 1988 and $2.75 next year.
   Banca Commerciale, based in Milan, has assets of around $60
bilion and is Italy's seocnd largest bank, behind Banca Nazionale
del Lavoro. About 64 percent of Banca Commerciale is owned by the
giant state holding company Istituto per la Ricostruzione
Industriale.
   Irving's assets total about $24 billion.

   Consumer prices, propelled by a record rise in
clothing costs, shot up 0.5 percent in March, the biggest increase
since January 1987, the government said today.
   Besides the 2.0 percent jump in apparel costs, retail prices
were also driven upward by a 0.4 percent gain in gasoline costs,
the first rise since August, and a 0.3 percent hike in food prices.
   Taken together, clothing, food and transportation price
increases accounted for half the March jump, which was more than
double the 0.2 percent gain of February.
   The overall gain _ amounting to 6.4 percent on an annual basis _
heightened economists' concerns that inflation may be rebounding.
The Consumer Price Index had risen a moderate 4.4 percent last year
and a tiny 1.1 percent in 1986.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said,``Despite large
increases for consumer and producer prices in March, the smaller
increases in prices in previous months and the expected slower
growth in total demand in future months indicate that inflation
remains under control.''
   ``This is the first dose of inflation we have had since the
first half of 1987,'' said Donald Ratajczak, head of the
forecasting project at Georgia State University. ``If things don't
settle down by May, then I think the Federal Reserve will have to
put fighting inflation pretty high on the agenda.''
   The central bank fights inflation by raising interest rates and
thus slowing the pace of economic activity. While economists had
not expected the Fed to slow economic growth during a presidential
election year, many analysts now believe that the Fed has already
taken a small step toward tightening credit with more steps to come.
   Today's Labor Department report blamed the sharp increase in
clothing costs, the steepest one-month increase since records were
first kept in 1947, on ``substantially higher priced spring and
summer merchandise, particularly women's clothing.''
   Indeed, prices for women's and girls' clothing rose 3.9 percent
after falling in January and February. Prices for men's and boys'
apparel were up 1.2 percent.
   Clothing prices normally rise in the spring. Last month's jump _
3.7 percent once the department's seasonal adjustment process is
factored out _ was even greater than analysts had expected, however.
   The department gave these other specifics on March retail price
activity:
   _Gasoline prices rose 0.4 percent after falling 1.7 percent in
February and 1.6 percent in January. From September through
February, gasoline prices had fallen 5.9 percent.
   _Grocery store prices rose 0.4 percent after falling 0.6 percent
in February.
   Leading the way was a 0.2 percent gain in prices for fresh
fruits and vegetables. Virtually all the increase was in fresh
fruit prices while the costs of fresh vegetables continued to
decline.
   After soaring 25.5 percent in 1987, fresh vegetable prices have
fallen 14.9 percent so far this year.
   The costs of buying meat, poultry and eggs were all up, with egg
prices rising 4.6 percent.

<TEXT>
   _New automobile prices rose 0.3 percent, but that increase was
largely offset by a 1.4 percent drop in the cost of obtaining car
loans.
   _Home heating oil prices rose 0.8 percent while the cost of
natural gas and electricity was down 0.3 percent.
   _Public transportation costs climbed 0.5 percent, reflecting
widespread airline fare increases.
   _Medical care costs rose 0.4 percent. Such expenses gained 7.7
percent in the first three months of 1987 and were the fastest
rising major segment of the consumer price calculation.
   Overall, retail prices have risen at a 4.2 percent annual rate
so far this year.
   The March increase left the index at 116.5, meaning that a
hypothetical market-basket of goods costing $100 during a 1982-:4
base period wouldhave cost $117.50 last$mo34ghfGs

<HEAD>Accounting Change Lifts Profit Despite Sales Decline</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Northrop Corp. said a tax accounting change
was responsible for more than tripling its first-quarter profit
despite a 3 percent sales decline.
   The aerospace contractor said Tuesday that its net income rose
to $139.6 million, or $2.97 a share, for the first three months of
the year from $40.6 million, or 87 cents a share, in the same
period last year.
   First-quarter sales fell to $1.37 billion from $1.41 billion in
1987.
   The latest results were helped by a tax accounting change that
increased earnings by $135.1 million, the company said.
   Northrop's operating profit in its aircraft, electronics and
services businesses fell 35 percent to $67.5 million from $103.6
million a year earlier.
   The reduction in sales was attributed to lower sales in the
company's electronic countermeasures product line and to a lower
level of customer-sponsored research and development.
   Nonetheless, the company reported increased deliveries of the
main fuselage section for the Boeing 747 jetliner and increased
sales in the MX Peacekeeper program.
   Northrop is the prime contractor on the B-2 Advanced Technology
Bomber, also known as the ``stealth bomber'' because of its
radar-evading characteristics.
   The company said the earnings were also depressed by an
unspecified amount as the company continued to spend on development
of a prototype of the Air Force's 21st century warplane, the
Advanced Tactical Fighter.

   President Reagan's spokesman said today the
White House is ``pretty pessimistic'' that it will receive a trade
bill from Congress that the president will be able to sign.
   Marlin Fitzwater also told reporters he believed it would be
possible to sustain a presidential veto.
   Fitzwater spoke as Democratic leaders prepared for a House vote
on this week after jettisoning a provision, opposed
by the administration, requiring public disclosue legislation thres by
foreign
investors.
   Still in the measure, however, are a number of sections also
opposed by the administration, including one requiring advance
notice to employees of plant closings.
   ``I would say we are not too optimsitic at this point,''
Fitzwater said. ``The indications have been that the Congress is
not going to relent on plant closings as well as some of the other
provisions, so I would say we are pretty pessimistic that we will
get a bill we'll sign.''
   Asked about prospects for sustaining a veto, he said, ``We
certainly would work to sustain it and we think it could happen.''
   ``The president I think has made it abundantly clear that in its
present form it will draw a veto,'' Treasury Sechat on Thursday's roll
call would cast new
doubt over the legislation.
   House Minority Leader Robert H. Michel, R-Ill., emerging from a
leadership meeting at the White House on Tuesday morning, said he
would ``attempt to marshal the support to sustain the president's
veto before it gets to the Senate.''
   The Senate takes up the bill next week and it is expected to
pass there without much trouble. But senators from both parties
said it would be difficult to muster the two-thirds.
   ``I'd be amazed if there were not enough votes to sustain a
veto,'' said Sen. Bob Packwood, R-Ore., top Republican on the
Senate Finance Committee and a critic of the legislation.
   Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, one of
the bill's chief sponsors, said he expected a veto, and overriding
it ``will be very tough.''
   He said lawmakers ``have made concession after concession'' in a
futile attempt to win support for the measur from the president.
   Meanwhile, Senate Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va.,
warned against a spreading belief on Capitol Hill that lawmakers
might get a second crack at the trade issue this year.
   ``I hope we will not believe the conventional wisdom that if the
president vetoes this bill, the Congress will quickly pass a
stripped down version,'' Byrd said.

   Bristol-Myers Co.'s earnings jumped 21 percent
in the first quarter this year, boosted by record sales of the
company's drug and consumer products.
   Net income for the three months ended March 31 was $210.64
million, or 73 cents per share, compared to $173.88 million, or 61
cents per share, for the same quarter last year. The 1987 per-share
figure was adjusted to reflect a two-for-one stock split.
   Sales were up 13 percent from $1.35 billion to $1.52 billion,
which the company said was a record for its 101-year history.
   Chairman Richard L. Gelb said exchange rate fluctuations
accounted for about 1 percent of total sales growth.
   The New York-based company makes toiletries, drugs, hair care
and household products and nutritional and vitamin products.

<HEAD>Shearson's First Quarter Earnings Up Slightly, Includes Hutton
Acquisition</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Shearson Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. said Wednesday that
first-quarter earnings rose slightly and revenue jumped 47 percent,
which the brokerage giant attributed partly to its post-crash
purchase of E.F. Hutton Group Inc.
   Wall Street analysts said the results were respectable,
considering the enormous trading losses suffered by many firms
after the Oct. 19 market collapse, including those of Hutton, which
was acquired late last year.
   The parent of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. said earnings totaled
$81 million for the three months ended March 31, up 2.6 percent
from the $78 million earned a year earlier.
   Per-share earnings were 81 cents, the company said. It did not
provide year-earlier per-share earnings because at that time the
stock was held by American Express Co. and wasn't sold publicly
until last May. Shearson has about 99 million shares and
equivalents outstanding.
   First-quarter revenues totaled $2.5 billion, up 47 percent from
$1.7 billion a year earlier. Much of the gain was derived from the
company's increased customer base as a result of the Hutton
acquisition.
   But first-quarter expenses also surged from $1.6 billion to $2.4
billion, a 51 percent gain that Shearson attributed partly to costs
associated with the incorporation of Hutton's staff and property
into its operations.
   Investment banking revenues more than doubled, from $172 million
to $357 million, reflecting strong merger and acquisition and
merchant banking activities, the company said.
   ``We are particularly pleased with the quarterly increase, given
the lower levels of investor participation in the financial markets
and the non-recurring charges associated with the Hutton acquisiton
that are being recognized in 1988,'' said Peter A. Cohen, chairman
and chief executive officer.
   Shearson's earnings were reported a day after several other
major brokerages reported sharply lower first-quarter results,
which they ascribed to a business slump following the crash.
   Perrin Long, a brokerage analyst at Lipper Analytical Securities
Corp. in New York, said one reason for the healthier results from
Shearson is ``that they're somewhat better managed.''

   The Supreme Court ruled today the government
may disqualify military veterans who are alcoholics from receiving
benefits by viewing their condition as ``willful misconduct''
rather than an uncontrollable disease.
   By a 4-3 vote, the justices said the Veterans Administration, in
denying benefits to two men, did not violate a federal law
protecting the rights of the handicapped.
   The court did not decide whether alcoholism is a disease, but
said the VA is not compelled to regard it as sch.
   ``It is not our role to resolve this medical issue on which the
authorities remain sharply divided,'' said Justice Byron R. White
for the court.
   White said a law known as Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act
does not require the Veterans Administration to treat alcoholism as
a disease. The act, passed by Congress in 1973, bars federal
programs or anyone receiving federal aid from discriminating
against handicapped individuals solely because of their handicap.
   ``In our view, it is by no means clear that Section 504 and the
characterization of primary alcoholism as a willfully incurred
disability are in irreconciliable conflict,'' White said.
   Those who believe there is a conflict should ask Congress to
change the law, he said.
   Three dissenters said the VA should not be allowed to treat all
alcoholics in the same way and automatically dismiss their benefit
claims on grounds the veterans are guilty of misconduct.
   ``This is the very kind of broad social generalization that
Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act is intended to eliminate,''
said Justice Harry A. Blackmun in dissent. ``The petitioners in
these cases ask only that their situations be given individualized
evaluation.''
   He was joined by Justices William J. Brennan and Thurgood
Marshall.
   Joining White were Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and
Justices John Paul Stevens and Sandra Day O'Connor.
   Justices Antonin Scalia and Anthony M. Kennedy did not take part
in the ruling.
   The VA policy that regards alcoholism as misconduct was
challenged by Eugene Traynor, 46, a supervisor in a photography
laboratory in New York City, and James P. McKelvey, 42, an
alcoholism counselor in Washington, D.C.
   Both men, who began drinking when they were children, received
honorable discharges from the Army in the late 1960s. They said
they have abstained from drinking alcohol since the early 1970s,
when they were hospitalized and treated for the condition.
   The VA authorizes payment of education benefits to veterans
within 10 years of their discharge. No benefits are paid after 10
years unless a veteran can show he or she was unable to pursue an
education ``because of a physical or mental disability which was
not the result of such veteran's own willful misconduct.''
   The VA provides an exemption from the 10-year time limit for
alocholism only when it is a secondary sympton of other
psychological problems.
   Traynor and McKelvey filed federal lawsuits claiming the
Veterans Administration was discriminating illlegaly against the
handicapped.
   Federal appeals courts ruled against them in separate cases.
   McKelvey said the high court's decision gives a message ``to
other recovering alcoholics, or more importantly, people that are
out there struggling, trying to get sober, and dying from this
disease. ... I believe that the justices who ruled in favor of the
Veteran's Administration is giving them a license to kill, more or
less. They're saying that the Veteran's Administration can violate
existing federal statutes and get away with it.''
   A VA spokesman, John Scholzen, said the agency would have no
comment until its attorneys have examined the ruling.
   The cases attracted widespread attention with the current
renewed debate over the nature of alcoholism.
   Many programs have developed in recent years that treat
alcoholics as victims of a disease rather than as social deviants
or criminals.
   The psychiatrists' catalogue of diseases, called the Diagnostic
and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, calls alcohol abuse and
dependence a disease and says about 13 percent of all Americans
suffer from it at some point in their lives.
   Dr. David Goldman, a researcher at the National Institute on
Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, said the medical community ``has gone
far beyond'' the debate about whether alcoholism is a disease. Now,
he said, researchers are trying to identify the specific gene that
they believe makes a person ``vulnerable'' to alcoholism.
   Some critics fear the recent trend treating alcoholism as a
disease dangerously removes individual responsibility for such
behavior as drunken driving and spouse and child abuse.
   Norma Phillips, the national president of Mothers Against Drunk
Driving, said her organization welcomes the decision because she
believes it will encourage judges to give tougher sentences in
drunken driving cases.
   ``There are some judges who feel people are not able to make a
decision after they drink,'' said Mrs. Phillips, of Escondido,
Calif. ``They feel they have an alcohol problem so they give
lighter sentences.''
   A spokesman for Alcoholocs Anonymous who asked not to be named
said the question of whether or not alcohol abuse is a disease does
not matter in AA treatment, which calls for group support in
staying sober.
   ``We've never taken any position as to whether or not it is an
illness because it doesn't really matter with our treatment
system,'' the spokesman said.
   There are an estimated 10 million alcoholics in the United
States, including about one million who seek treatment annually in
one form or another.
   In other action, the court:
   _ Ruled that unions may distribute handbills urging consumers to
boycott ``neutral employers'' against whom the unions have no
grievance.
   Voting 8-0 in a case from Florida, the justices said that
although federal labor law generally prohibits unions from engaging
in ``secondary boycott'' picketing of neutral employers it does not
ban non-picketing activities aimed at such businesses.
   In a separate decision, the court ruled by a 6-2 vote in a
California case that employers may be forced to provide free,
internal mail delivery for labor union literature aimed at
organizing employees.
   _ Upheld a law requiring munijcipal or state bonds issued after
June 30, 1983, to be registered before they can be tax-exempt.
   The justices, by a 7-1 vote, ruled that the federal law enacted
to discourage tax evasion in the trading of municipal bonds does
not violate any state's sovereign immunity.
   The alcoholism case is Traynor vs. Turnage, 86-622.
   The psychiatrists' catalogue of diseases, called the Diagnostic
and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, calls alcohol abuse and
dependence a disease and says about 13 percent of all Americans
suffer from it at some point in their lives.

   Heirs of the late newspaper magnate,
Axel Springer, have won a bitter power struggle to gain control of
the West German publishing empire, the company announced Wednesday.
   The Axel Springer company said Franz and Frieder Burda _ two
stockholders who control 25.9 percent of the company's shares _ had
sold their holdings to Springer's heirs.
   That gives the Springer family a 52 percent majority interest in
the concern, according to the statement, which was also issued in
the name of the Burda brothers.
   The Burdas' action marks a sharp turnaround and a defeat for Leo
Kirch, a wealthy film distributor who had been trying to increase
his power within the Springer company.
   ``We (the Springer heirs and the Burdas) feel we are doing
things along the lines Mr. Springer wanted before he died,'' Ernst
Cramer, adviser to the Springer family, said in a telephone
interview from his West Berlin office.
   Peter von Maydell, spokesman for the Burda brothers, also
confirmed the stock sale.
   The industry newspaper ``Neue Medien'' in Hamburg reported the
deal was worth 530 million marks (about $320 million). Maydell said
he could not confirm the reported price.
   Friede Springer, Axel Springer's widow, had been trying to block
Kirch's efforts to increase his power within the company. Mrs.
Springer and the Burdas are members of the company's supervisory
board, but Kirch is not.
   Powers within the Springer company have been squabbling since
the 73-year-old Axel Springer died on Sept. 22, 1985, leaving his
wife and two sons as direct heirs.
   Springer built a family-owned empire that in addition to Bild,
West Germany's largest newspaper, also includes a respected
conservative daily, Die Welt.
   Before his death, Axel Springer converted his empire into a
joint stock company.
   Under a complicated formula, Springer's heirs and executors were
given control of 26.1 percent of the company shares, the Burda
brothers 25.9 percent and Kirch 10 percent. The rest went to the
stock exchange.
   Last month, Kirch and the Burdas signed an agreement to pool
their Springer shares in an effort to gain control of a majority of
the company stock. Kirch said he had gained support from the
holders of a further 16 percent of Springer stock.
   Kirch and the Burdas said at the time they had concluded the
agreement as a means to ending the feuding at Springer and to
ensure the company had a good future.
   But the federal Cartel Office last week said Kirch and the
Burdas together had failed to come up with a majority of the shares.
   The Burdas, who own a string of printing plants, said in a
statement Wednesday they decided to sell their holdings to the
Springer family in the best interests of the company.
   ``After it became clear this solution (the attempt to form a
majority with Kirch) could not be realized, they (the Burdas) saw
no reason for that kind of partnership,'' the statement said.
   The Burdas decided to sell their holdings to the Springer heirs
because ``the future-oriented development of Axel Springer Verlag
has the highest importance,'' the statement said.
   Cramer, spokesman for the Springer family, said he saw no
contradiction between Axel Springer's wishes for his company and
the Burdas selling their stock to Springer's heirs.
   ``He divided the stocks, that is true. But that was not meant to
be against the family. He specified he wanted the stocks to be used
to keep up the strength of the company. We feel we are doing
that,'' said Cramer.
   Kirch's spokeswoman, Armgard von Burgsdorff, said from her
Munich office that Kirch would not comment on the Burdas' action.

   The U.S. dollar remained little changed against
major foreign currencies Wednesday in lethargic European trading.
   Gold prices also steadied.
   Dealers said the threat of central bank intervention prevented
dealers from selling the dollar short.
   The dollar was unaffected by a 0.5 percent rise in the U.S.
consumer price index in March, which was in line with market
expectations, they said.
   In London, the British pound was quoted at $1.8930, unchanged
from Tuesday's late rate.
   In Tokyo, the dollar fell to a closing 123.90 Japanese yen from
124.37 yen at Tuesday's close. Later, in London, it edged up to
123.95 yen.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Tuesday:
1.6635 West German marks, up from 1.6625; 1.3745 Swiss francs, down
from 1.3752; 5.6490 French francs, up from 5.6465; 1.8630 Dutch
guilders, down from 1.8642; 1,234.50 Italian lire, down from
1,235.75; and 1.2283 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2337.
   Gold bullion edged up in active trading in Zurich to a late bid
price of $457.50 from $457 bid late Tuesday. In London, the metal
was bid at $456.50, unchanged from Tuesday's late price.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose to a closing bid of $458.94
from $457.59 bid late Tuesday.
   Silver bullion was quoted at a late bid price of $6.46,
unchanged from Tuesday's late bid price.

   The stock market showed no clear trend today as
Wall Streeters voiced mixed feelings about the inflation outlook.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 3.48 to 2,002.98 by
2 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by nearly 9 to 5 in the overall tally

   The Labor Department reported this morning that the consumer
price index rose 0.5 percent in March. That marked the biggest
monthly increase in the inflation gauge since it jumped 0.7 percent

   But analysts said there was a general sense of relief on Wall
Street that the figure wasn't worse.
   Rumors and conjecture that the increase might run close to a
full percentage point sent both stock and bond prices lower in late
trading on Tuesday.
   Columbia Gas System fell 1~ to 28 in active trading. The company
cut its quarterly dividend from 79.5 cents a share to 50 cents a
share.
   American Telephone & Telegraph gained { to 27. The company
reported higher first-quarter profits and said it was aiming to
sustain earnings growth at a 15 percent rate for the remainder of
the year.
   B.F. Goodrich was unchanged at 52\ after trading as high as 54{.
The company said it had been notified by Sir James Goldsmith, the
British financier, that he was a ``passive investor'' in Goodrich
and was not interested, as rumored, in acquiring it.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks lost
.11 to 146.06. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value

<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ralston Purina Co. on Wednesday reported a 30.5
percent increase in second-quarter earnings due to improved sales
of human and pet foods.
   Net income for the second quarter was $93.3 million, or $1.35 a
share, on sales of $1.49 billion, compared with net income of $71.5
million, or 98 cents a share, on revenue of $1.44 billion for the
same period in 1987.
   Human and pet foods showed improved performance on higher
volumes and tuna on higher margins, company spokesman Patrick
Farrell said. In addition, Continental Baking showed improved
performance on higher bread and cake margins, Farrell said.
   Profit for Eveready Battery increased on strong international
volumes, although domestic battery profits were down slightly due
to increased advertising and promotion in a highly competitive
market, Farrell said.
   For the six-month period ending March 31, net income was $225.7
million, or $3.25 a share, on sales of $3.05 billion, compared to
$370.4 million, or $5 a share, on revenue of $2.95 billion for the
same period last year.
   Last year's first six months included a gain of $2.82 per share
on the sale of the company's domestic agricultural business.
   Excluding this gain and a loss on early retirement of debt from
last year's first-half results, earnings increased substantially
over the adjusted prior period results, benefiting from lower tax
rates and improved operating results.
   International agricultural products showed improved profits for
the six-month period on both improved margins and volumes.

<HEAD>Earnings up Up 24 Pct. in 2nd Qtr.; Tax Adjustment Credited</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EL SEGUNDO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rockwell International Corp., the
aerospace, automotive and electronics firm, reported second-quarter
earnings rose 24 percent, but gave most of the credit to a tax
adjustment.
   Rockwell said Wednesday that profits rose to $218.4 million, or
81 cents per share, from $175.6 million, or 62 cents per share, in
the second quarter of 1987.
   Sales totaled $3 billion in the three months ended March 31,
down from $3.16 billion for the comparable period in 1987, largely
because of a 24 percent decline in sales of B1-B bombers. Rockwell
expects to deliver the 100th, and last, B1-B to the Air Force late
this month.
   The favorable tax adjustment resulted from deferral of income on
the B1-B program from previous years for tax purposes. The
earnings, deferred under the completed contract method, are taxed
at a lower rate under the new tax law.
   Donald R. Beall, chairman and chief executive officer, said
earnings excluding the tax adjustment were comparable with last
year.
   Earnings for the first half of the current year were $411.3
million, or $1.52 per share, up from $325 million, or $1.15 per
share in the first half of 1987. First-half revenues were $5.7
billion, off from $6 billion in the first half of last year.

<HEAD>General Dynamics Reports Slight Increase In First-Quarter Earnings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defense contractor General Dynamics on
Wednesday reported a slight increase in first-quarter earnings due
to its F-16 program.
   Net income for the first quarter was $105.7 million, or $2.52 a
share, on revenue of $2.4 billion, compared with net income of
$105.4 million, or $2.45 a share, on revenue of $2.3 billion for
the same period in 1987.
   Net earnings for the quarter reflect benefits of $20 million, or
48 cents per share, from tax law changes resulting in reductions of
deferred taxes. Comparable benefits for the first quarter in 1987
were $20 million, or 46 cents a share.
   ``Increased procurement on the F-16 program results in an
overall improvement in the government aerospace segment,'' said
Stanley C. Pace, chairman and chief executive officer. Pace said
the improvement was made despite continued investments in advanced
aircraft programs and lower production of the ground-launched
Cruise missile as that contract nears its scheduled completion
during 1988.
   Results of the company's submarine operations reflect increased
production activity on the Trident program, Pace said.
   Pace said San Juan, the first ship equipped with the new system,
is currently on sea trials and performing successfully.
   Pace said that Cessna remained profitable as a result of
continued cost containment efforts. In other lines of non-defense
business, he said the company continued to invest in production of
18 Atlas-Centaur Launch Vehicles.
   Backlog reached a record high, with funded backlog at $17.3
billion and total backlog at $24.9 billion. Comparable accounts in
1987 were $15.7 billion and $21.7 billion.
   The 1988 backlog includes recent contract awards for development
if the Navy's advanced tactical aircraft, construction of the 15th
Trident submarine, and the majority of fiscal year 1988
procurements of Standard and Sparrow missles, as well as a
multiyear contract for the Stinger missile.

   The Wall Street Journal will be published in
three sections rather than two starting in September in an effort
to make the newspaper more convenient for readers to use, the
chairman of Dow Jones & Co. said Wednesday.
   Warren H. Phillips, who is also chief executive of the company
that publishes the Journal, said ``coverage of market trends and
investment opportunities will be developed further, extended well
beyond the stock markets and organized in a separate third section
for easier access.''
   He also said price quotations will be made more readable and
unusual price or volume developments or trends will be pointed up
in new ways.
   The Journal has been published in two sections since June 1980.
   A spokesman for Dow Jones, Danforth Austin, said the addition of
a new section would not necessarily increase the number of pages in
the newspaper. He said the change was seen as a way to organize
coverage in a better fashion.
   Phillips disclosed the plans at the annual meeting of Dow Jones
shareholders.

<HEAD>Goodrich: Goldsmith Takeover Report False</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AKRON, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   British financier Sir James Goldsmith has
acquired a stake in BF Goodrich Co. but is not interested in taking
over the former tire maker, Goodrich said Wednesday.
   Goodrich issued a statement in response to a published report
that at least one corporate raider, and possibly two, had acquired
stakes in Goodrich.
   USA Today reported in Wednesday's editions that Goldsmith has
reportedly acquired close to 5 percent of Goodrich's outstanding
shares. The Securities and Exchange Commission requires
stockholders to reveal their interest in a company if it exceeds 5
percent.
   The paper said another unidentified raider had purchased about 2
percent of the company's 25.2 million outstanding shares.
   Goodrich said Goldsmith called Goodrich Chairman John D. Ong on
Wednesday ``to say that the press reports indicating that he has an
interest in acquiring Goodrich are erroneous. Sir James told Ong
that he is a passive investor in the company ... there is no truth
to the report that he has an intention to acquire a major stake.''
   Goldsmith launched a takeover bid for Akron-based tiremaker
Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. in 1986, but Goodyear fought off the
overture by buying Goldsmith's 11.5 percent stake for $619 million.
Goodyear since has sold major non-tire assets to reduce the debt it
incurred in fighting off Goldsmith.
   On Monday Goodrich reported first-quarter net income of $34.7
million, up from $3.8 million because of strong demand for some of
the company's specialty chemical products.
   The company's largest business is the production of polyvinyl
chloride or vinyl. Its other major businesses are specialty
chemicals and aerospace and defense products.
   Ong said Monday that Goodrich expects to complete the sale of
the company's interest in Uniroyal Goodrich Tire Co. within the
next two months, ending the 118-year-old company's association with
tires. Goodrich announced in December that an investment group
formed by Clayton & Dubilier Inc. agreed to buy its interest in
Uniroyal for $225 million.
   Goodrich and Uniroyal Inc. combined their tire businesses into
the Akron-based Uniroyal Goodrich in August 1986.

   A Supreme Court ruling Wednesday that
alcoholism can be regarded as ``willful misconduct'' instead of a
disease when determining veterans' benefits will have little effect
on the treatment of alcohol abuse or on insurance payments for
rehabilitation, according to experts.
   Most medical authorities accept the concept that there is an
element of disease in alcoholism, but that it also is a condition
that involves an entire range of complex elements, including
heredity and social and environmental influences.
   Lee I. Dogoloff of the American Council for Drug Education, who
was the Carter administration's adviser on drug policy, said
alcoholism ``has all the features of any other disease'' _ with a
beginning, a progression and an end-stage condition.
   He said there are different types of alcoholics, but that most
medical researchers now accept that about 10 percent of the
American population has what some call the ``genetic
vulnerability'' to become helplessly addicted to alcohol.
   ``Do you have a choice to take that first drink?'' Dogoloff
said. ``Sure. But once that threshold is crossed, it becomes a
disease'' for many alcoholics.
   He said the real concern about the Supreme Court ruling is how
it will affect society's efforts to control alcoholism. Many
companies, Dogoloff said, provide services to help alcoholics
recover because American industry has discovered that such programs
are good for business.
   By helping alcoholics stay sober, he said, there is a
cost-to-benefit ratio of up to 7-to-1. This results from prevented
accidents, increased productivity and prevention of alcohol-related
health conditions, such as liver disease, that can be expensive to
treat.
   The ruling is unlikely to affect most health insurance payments
for the cost of rehabilitation, said Rob Bier, a spokesman for the
Health Insurance Association of America.
   ``Health insurance is a contract and if it covers alcohol
rehabilitation then that will not change no matter what the Supreme
Court says,'' Bier said.
   Christine Lubinski, spokeswoman for the National Council on
Alcoholism, said her group is ``obviously very disappointed in the
decision.''
   ``This is a blow to us and to morale,'' she said. ``However, we
... feel like the state of the art in terms of both public
awareness about alcoholism as well as the successful treatment of
alcoholism will prevail.''
   Dr. David Goldman, a researcher at the National Institute on
Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, said it is widely accepted in the
medical profession that alcoholism is a disease even though it may
have an element of free choice.
   ``There are diseases that involve choice that are still
diseases,'' he said. ``An example is coronary artery disease. If
one eats fatty foods, it contributes to the disease, but it is
still classified as a disease.''
   Goldman said research has shown there is a ``genetic
predisposition'' to alcoholism, but that alcohol abuse also can
involve what he calls ``environmental factors'' and ``an act of
will.''
   The American Medical Association defines alcoholism as ``an
illness.'' The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
Disorders, a psychiatrists' catalogue of diseases, lists alcohol
abuse and dependence.
   But Norma Phillips, the national president of Mothers Against
Drunk Driving, said too many judges accept the concept that drunks
are helpless victims of an uncontrollable disease. As a result, she
said, some judges give light sentences for drunken driving.
   Mrs. Phillips said she hopes the Supreme Court ruling will
change that.
   ``I feel this decision is fair and just and that this encourages
judges to give sentences to fit the crime of drunken driving,'' she
said. ``The fundamental issue is responsibility. Just because a
person is an alcoholic doesn't give them the right to get behind
the wheel of a car when they are drunk.''
   The new ruling, she said, may force drunk drivers to accept the
personal responsibility for their actions instead of ducking behind
medical excuses.

   American Brands Inc. on Wednesday
reported a 15 percent jump in first-quarter earnings and announced
plans to sell its Andrew Jergens Co. subsidiary for an undisclosed
price.
   Earnings for the quarter totaled $150 million, or $1.40 a share,
compared with earnings of $131 million, or $1.15 million in the
year-ago quarter.
   The company attributed higher earnings per share in part to
stock repurchases. Including shares acquired in connection with the
company's acquisition of E-II Holdings Inc., 13 million shares have
been purchased to date.
   Sales during the period totaled $2.91 billion, up from $2.2
billion in the same period a year ago.
   American Brands Chairman and Chief Executive Officer William J.
Alley noted strong performances by the company's tobacco, distilled
spirits and financial services core businesses.
   The company's major brands include Lucky Strike, Pall Mall and
Tareyton cigarettes, Jim Beam bourbon and Windsor Canadian whiskey,
and the Franklin Life and Southland Life insurance companies.
   Separately, American Brands announced it sold its Jergens
subsidiary to Kao Corp. of America, a division of Kao Corp. of
Japan. American Brands said in December it planned to sell the
subsidiary.
   Kao manufactures soaps, detergents, hair care products,
disposable diapers and industrial chemicals. Jergens manufactures
hand and body lotions, soaps and other personal care products.

   Corn and soybean futures closed lower Wednesday
on the Chicago Board of Trade _ soybeans sharply so _ as rain in
the Plains states washed away fears about weather damage to crops.
Wheat advanced slightly.
   Profit-taking took soybean prices down sharply near the close
but prices had trended lower throughout the session.
   The sell-off in the corn and beans followed two days of gains
triggered by fears that dry conditions in the northern Plains would
extend into the major corn-and-soybean regions of the Midwest.
Analysts said the worries were premature since corn and soybean
planting has only begun.
   ``I think the markets are going through their usual gyrations
this time of year,'' said Walter Spilka, an analyst in New York
with Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co. ``You get a brief rally on
weather information, then you get a little rain in the corn belt
and that puts some pressure on the markets just because they've
been up a little.''
   Wheat futures were supported by expectations of new export
business, analysts said.
   At the close, wheat was { cent to 2{ cents higher with the
contract for delivery in May at $3.15} a bushel; corn was 1 cent to
1{ cents lower with May at $2.04 a bushel; oats were 2 cents lower

   Rival bidders for J.P. Stevens & Co. had not
reached an agreement as of Wednesday in their $1.22 billion battle
to acquire the textile giant.
   Odyssey Partners, which has an agreement to acquire Stevens for
$1.22 billion, and rival bidder West-Point Pepperell Inc. said
Tuesday that they had begun discussing a possible cash buyout of
Stevens at $68.50 a share, the same price offered by Odyssey.
   A spokesman for Pepperell confirmed that those discussions were
taking place in New York. But he had not comment on whether a
resolution might be at hand.
   ``They haven't announced that they've stopped (negotiations),''
said David Kronfeld, who represents the West Point, Ga., textile
maker.
   Pepperell is bidding in conjunction with NTC Group, parent of
textile manufacturer Bibb Co. Pepperell has said it will sell half
of Stevens' bath lines and 20 percent of its sheet lines to NTC if
it is successful in the takeover.
   Analysts have speculated that fabric maker Pepperell and
Odyssey, an investment group, probably were working toward an
accord to split up Stevens' assets.
   Stevens' board of directors endorsed Odyssey's outstanding
$68.50-a-share tender offer last week. The board rejected
Pepperell's competing $67-a-share tender offer, which represented
the third round of bidding in the heated takeover contest.
   A spokesman for Stevens had no comment.

   The new chairman of First City Bancorporation of

assisted reorganization plan is completed.
   ``First City's flag is flying high. This is the moment we've all

   Late Tuesday, after a day of completing the necessary paperwork,
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. transferred $970 million to the
ailing bank, Abboud said.
   ``It wasn't the parting of the Red Sea, but it's close to it,''
he said. ``After a long night, we successfully completed the
transaction and obviously we're all pleased.''
   The bailout plan, the second largest such rescue in U.S.
history, also calls for a spinoff of $1.79 billion of poorly
performing assets and a $500 million infusion of capital raised
privately by a group headed Abboud.
   As part of the restructuring, First City obtained a revolving
line of credit with San Jacinto Savings Association of Houston as
the lead lender. San Jacinto Savings agreed to lend $68 million of
the initial $108 million First City needs to pay off its debt
holders.
   Abboud has predicted that the new First City, the state's
fourth-largest bank holding company, will make $74 million in its
first year, $104 million by its second year, and $119 million by
the third year.
   ``Certainly, the figues that have been put forward are those
that we're operating under,'' he said at a Wednesday news
conference.
   An analyst that follows First City, however, said Abboud is
being too optimistic.
   ``In our opinion, it is going to be difficult to meet the
forecasted loan growth assumptions,'' said Sandra Flannigan,
analyst with PaineWebber in Houston.
   First City last posted a profit during the second quarter of
1986. For 1987, the company posted a $1.1 billion loss. In a report
to the Securities and Exchange Commission filed last month, First
City said it expected to lose $43 million by the time the rescue
plan was completed.
   The rescue plan, implemented three months behind schedule, was
stalled by debt holders who were reluctant to tender their
securities for less than face value. The company originally had
wanted 90 percent participation but then lowered the threshold to
70 percent.
   By a Monday deadline, the company's sixth, only 67.5 percent, or
$152.4 million, of the bank's $225.8 million in bonds had been
tendered, Abboud said.
   ``We had hoped to achieve a target around 68 percent or
better,'' he said.
   ``The half-percent is something we will take on to the books of
the new First City and we will find it a challenge to take on that
particular differential. We would have been substantially closer,
but we had some withdrawals by savings and loans.''
   First City senior debt holders were offered 45 cents on the
dollar for their debt under the plan, while subordinated debt
holders were offered 35 cents.
   Bonds not tendered by the deadline could be worth as much as 100
cents on the dollar.
   Some investors who initially agreed to participate in a private
placement of new First City securities got cold feet and backed
out, observers said. But Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., a New York
investment company, guaranteed the sale of $100 million in the
placement, Abboud said.
   Abboud also said First City entered a 10-year agreement with
Electronic Data Systems Corp. to manage First City Services Corp.,
the company's data processing subsidiary that employs 400.
   ``This is not a sale. This is not a sale of a First City
company,'' Abboud said.
   First City, with 59 banks in Texas and one in South Dakota, grew
quickly during the Texas oil boom, but was hit hard by energy and
real estate losses when oil prices plummeted.
   Leadership of the 122-year institution will move from longtime
Houston banker James A. Elkins Jr. to Abboud, who has been working
as a consultant for the company since September for $1 and a $2.25
million expense account.
   The assistance plan is the second largest by the FDIC. The
federal agency pumped $4.5 billion to rescue Continental Illinois
Corp. of Chicago in 1984.
   Ownership of First City by existing shareholders will go from
100 percent to 2 percent once the deal is completed.

<HEAD>Profit Down at BellSouth, SW Bell; Up at Bell Atlantic, Ameritech</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   BellSouth Corp., the largest regional telephone company spun off
in the breakup of the Bell System, said Wednesday that its
first-quarter profit dropped 4.8 percent, while Southwestern Bell
Corp. reported an 8 percent drop.
   Bell Atlantic Corp., meanwhile, said its after-tax profit rose 7
percent and Ameritech said it had a 2.1 percent gain.
   BellSouth, which has its headquarters in Atlanta, reported net
income of $430.9 million, or 90 cents per share, in the first three
months of the year, compared to earnings of $452.4 million, or 94
cents a share, the previous year. Revenues rose to $3.11 billion
from $2.94 billion.
   Southwestern Bell, which is based in St. Louis, reported an
after-tax profit of $218.7 million, or 73 cents a share, on revenue
of $2 billion. That compared with net income of $237.7 million, or
79 cents a share, on revenue of $1.88 billion a year earlier.
   Bell Atlantic, in Philadelphia, said its net income totaled
$329.1 million, or $1.66 a share, compared to $307.5 million, or
$1.54. Revenue rose to $2.5 billion from $2.46 billion.
   Ameritech, based in Chicago, reported earnings of $295.1
million, or $2.15 a share, compared to $289 million, or $2.03 a
share. Revenues rose to $2.4 billion from $2.3 billion.
   BellSouth Chairman John L. Clendenin said he was pleased with
the quarter despite the decline in earnings, saying the company had
not expected to improve on the strong results of the year-ago
period.
   Southwestern Bell said its earnings decline was due to continued
costs associated with the $1.38 billion acquisition of Metromedia
Paging Services in September. ``First-quarter performance was on
target with what we'd expected,'' Chairman Zane E. Barnes said.
   Bell Atlantic Chairman Thomas E. Bolger attributed his company's
increase in profit to the strength of the economy in the
mid-Atlantic region.
   Ameritech said its profit gain was held down by increased costs
for wages and depreciation.
   The companies are among the seven regional telephone companies
created by the court-ordered break-up of American Telephone &
Telegraph Co. on Jan. 1, 1984.

<HEAD>Union Pacific Profit Up 13 Pct.; Conrail Earnings Off</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Consolidated Rail Corp. reported a 44 percent drop in
first-quarter profit Wednesday, while Union Pacific Corp. said its
earnings increased 13 percent.
   Conrail blamed the decline on the loss of tax breaks when the
company was sold to public ownership by the government last year.
   The freight railroad, which is based in Philadelphia, reported
an after-tax profit of $48 million, or 69 cents per share, for the
first three months of the year. That was down from $86 million, or
$1.28 per share, in the same period of 1987, when Conrail was
sheltered from federal taxes by carrying forward losses incurred in
earlier years.
   Revenues rose 5.5 percent to $831 million from $788 million.
   The company said that discounting the previous tax break, its
earnings declined just 2 percent for the quarter.
   The tax advantage was canceled by federal legislation that
allowed Conrail to go public in a stock offering on March 26, 1987.
   First-quarter earnings in 1987 also were boosted by gains of $17
million from real estate sales.
   Union Pacific, which has its headquarters in New York, said it
earned $137.8 million, or $1.21 per share, up 13 percent from a net
of $121.9 million, or $1.07 per share, in 1987. Revenues rose to
$1.57 billion from $1.43 billion.
   The company said earnings were up at all its operations _ the
Union Pacific Railroad, oil and natural gas, real estate holdings
and overnight transportation.

   The stock gave ground today as Wall Streeters
voiced mixed feelings about the inflation outlook.
   The Labor Department reported this morning that the consumer
price index rose 0.5 percent in March.
   That marked the biggest monthly increase in the inflation gauge
since it jumped 0.7 percent in January 1987.
   But analysts said there was also a general sense of relief on
Wall Street that the figure wasn't worse.
   Rumors and conjecture that the increase might run close to a
full percentage point sent both stock and bond prices lower in late
trading on Tuesday.

   Dun & Bradstreet Corp. reported Wednesday it
sold a record amount of business information during the first
quarter, pushing its profit up 15.4 percent from a year ago.
   The business information and services company reported after-tax
income for the January-March quarter of $114.03 million, or 75
cents per share, on revenue of $882.14 million. That compared to
earnings of $98.83 million, or 65 cents per share, on revenue of
$828.48 million in the same period a year earlier.
   The New company said business information service revenues grew
8.2 percent, while the publishing segment was up 3.4 percent and
marketing services rose 6.5 percent.
   Chairman Charles W. Moritz said future revenues are expected to
climb even more as Dun & Bradstreet completes the previously
announced acquisition of several companies.
   Subsidiaries of the company include Moody's Investors Service
and Nielsen Media Research, the television ratings service.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar firmed slightly against most major
currencies in light, lethargic trading Wednesday.
   Gold prices were mixed. Republic National Bank of New York
quoted a bid of $456 for a troy ounce of gold as of 4 p.m. EDT,
down from $456.75 late Tuesday.
   Traders said the dollar moved in a narrow range. They noted
there was some attempt to sell dollars after the Labor Department
reported consumer prices jumped 0.5 percent during March.
   ``But after the Consumer Price Index came out this morning, the
market went back to sleep,'' said Lou Calvello, a currency trader
at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   ``Everybody is getting irate that the market isn't doing
anything,'' said David Godwin, chief foreign exchange dealer at
Union Bank of Switzerland.
   Godwin noted that investors are still inclined to sell dollars,
but the threat that any selling will be met by central bank
intervention keeps them holding onto the U.S. currency.
   ``People are just waiting for the dollar to break out of (the
current) range, then we'll see more activity,'' he noted.
   Trading also was lethargic earlier in Europe, where the dollar
finished little changed.
   In Tokyo, the dollar fell to a closing 123.90 Japanese yen from
124.37 yen at Tuesday's close. Later, in London, it edged up to
123.95 yen. In New York, the dollar closed at 124.15 yen, down from
124.27 yen on Tuesday.
   In London, the British pound was quoted at $1.8930, unchanged
from Tuesday's late rate. In New York, it cost $1.89125 to buy one
pound, less expensive than Tuesday's $1.8928.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Tuesday's prices, included: 1.66485 West German marks, up from
1.66375; 1.37645 Swiss francs, up from 1.3760; 5.6540 French
francs, down from 5.6590; 1,237.875 Italian lire, up from 1,237.75,
and 1.28905 Canadian dollars, up from 1.22985.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Tuesday's
rates, included: 1.6635 West German marks, up from 1.6625; 1.3745
Swiss francs, down from 1.3752; 5.6490 French francs, up from
5.6465; 1.8630 Dutch guilders, down from 1.8642; 1,234.50 Italian
lire, down from 1,235.75; and 1.2283 Canadian dollars, down from
1.2337.
   Gold prices were mixed. On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold
closed at $457 a troy ounce, down from $458.40 on Tuesday.
   In earlier Zurich trading, gold rose to a late bid price of
$457.50 from Tuesday's late bid of $457 an ounce. In London, the
metal was bid at $456.50, unchanged from Tuesday's late price.
Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose to a closing bid of $458.94 from
$457.59 bid late Tuesday.
   Silver closed at $6.439 an ounce on New York's Comex, down from
$6.451 on Tuesday. In London, the metal was quoted at a late bid
price of $6.46, unchanged from Tuesday's late bid price.

   Stock prices declined broadly in quiet trading
Wednesday as new uncertainties about the inflation outlook put a
damper on the market.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 14.09 to
1,985.41, registering its third consecutive loss. Since the start
of the week the average has fallen 28.52 points.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by more than 2 to 1 in the
daily tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed activity, with 483
up, 1,039 down and 465 unchanged.
   Big Board volume came to 147.59 million shares, against 161.91
million in the previous session. The NYSE's composite index fell
1.04 to 145.13.
   The Labor Department reported Wednesday morning that the
consumer price index rose 0.5 percent in March. That marked the
biggest monthly increase in the inflation gauge since it jumped 0.7
percent in January 1987.
   Analysts said there was a general sense of relief on Wall Street
that the figure wasn't worse.
   Rumors and conjecture that the increase might run close to a
full percentage point sent both stock and bond prices lower in late
trading on Tuesday.
   But even though that talk proved unwarranted, brokers said the
news left investors in a wary mood about prospects for possible
credit-tightening by the Federal Reserve.
   Several big-name stocks failed to muster much favorable response
to positive earnings news.
   For example, American Telephone & Telegraph was unchanged at
26{. The company reported higher first-quarter profits and said it
was aiming to sustain earnings growth at a 15 percent rate for the
remainder of the year.
   Dow Chemical dropped ] to 84] despite the company's report that
first-quarter earnings climbed to $2.67 a share from $1.28 in the
comparable period last year.
   Other losers among the blue chips included International Paper,
down 1] at 42|; Aluminum Co. of America, down 1[ at 45]; Eastman
Kodak, down ] at 40 after hitting a new 52-week low of 39[, and
Philip Morris, down 1\ at 86\.
   Columbia Gas System fell 1 to 28~ in active trading. The company
cut its quarterly dividend from 79.5 cents a share to 50 cents a
share.
   B.F. Goodrich was down \ at 52 after trading as high as 54{
early in the session. The company said it had been notified by Sir
James Goldsmith, the British financier, that he was a ``passive
investor'' in Goodrich and was not interested, as rumored, in
acquiring it.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $17.95 billion, or 0.70
percent, in value.
   Nationwide turnover in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 174.59 million shares.
   Standard & Poor's industrial index fell 2.17 to 298.33, and
S&P's 500-stock composite index was down 1.79 at 256.13.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
dropped 2.62 to 374.24. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index closed at 297.72, down 2.20.

<TEXT>
   American Stores Co. declined comment
Wednesday on a report it will raise its bid from $45 to $50 a share
for Lucky Stores Inc., which said it is talking to other parties
about a possible sale of the supermarket chain.
   Mike Holt, spokesman for Salt Lake City-based American Stores,
said he would not comment on a report by all-business radio station
KMNY in Los Angeles quoting unnamed Lucky sources saying American
would raise its bid soon.
   Meanwhile, Dublin-based Lucky issued a statement that it is
``continuing to review a variety of alternatives to the pending $45
tender offer by American Stores with a view of providing Lucky
stockholders with greater value.''
   Holt responded with the comment, ``they've been saying that all
along.''
   However, Lucky also said for the first time it has had
discussions with ``a number of lending institutions with respect to
a possible leveraged recapitalization of the company.''
   None of the parties was named in the statement.
   Lucky's shares gained 50 cents Wednesday to $53.75 in composite
New York Stock Exchange trading.
   Lucky's board of directors has not made a decision to sell and
such a decision will be made ``only after a review of available
alternatives is completed,'' the statement said.
   The merger of Lucky and American Stores could create the
nation's largest supermarket chain.
   Lucky said earlier this month its board rejected the unsolicited
tender offer of $1.74 billion as ``inadequate'' and not in the best
interest of the company or its stockholders.
   The rejection came 17 months after Lucky derailed a hostile

<HEAD>Copper Futures Slip As Supply Outlook Improves</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Copper futures prices fell for the third straight day Wednesday
on indications of increasing supplies and concerns about higher
interest rates.
   On other markets, precious metals also retreated; livestock and
meat futures advanced; energy futures slipped lower; grains and
soybeans were mixed; and stock-index futures gained.
   Copper futures on New York's Commodity Exchange were primed for
a sharp drop from a technical standpoint, and several bearish
fundamental factors gave the market a downward shove, analysts said.
   The first was a report Tuesday that the U.S. Mint had been
offered 4,500 tons of copper at a price only 2.5 cents above the
May futures price, which settled Wednesday at 92.2 cents a pound.
Copper for immediate delivery has recently been selling anywhere
from 3 cents to 6 cents above futures prices.
   The second bearish factor was a report that Chile's state-owned
National Mining Co. was selling on the open market copper that had
been earmarked for export to Brazil, said Bette Raptopoulos, metals
analyst for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York.
   The copper was available because the Brazilian government
refused to issue import permits as part of its effort to correct a
trade imbalance, she said.
   Additionally, industry reports indicated U.S. copper mine
production rose 21 percent in January and February compared to the
same period a year ago, and worldwide production increased 13
percent in January, said Fred Demler, metals analyst in New York
for Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
   Ms. Raptopoulos also cited persistent fears that the Federal
Reserve will tighten the U.S. money supply, thereby raising
interest rates, ``which would impact adversely on copper-consuming
industries such as housing and autos.''
   But Demler cautioned that demand for copper remains strong and
producer stocks are relatively low at 47,000 tons.
   ``This is a short-term softening in the supply-demand balance,
going from a very tight situation to a short-term surplus market,''
he said. ``A change in producer stocks of 20,000 or 30,000 tons
either way could cause a price spike or a sharp price drop.''
   Gold and silver futures fell in reaction to the government's
report that consumer prices rose 0.5 percent in March. The increase
was less than the market had expected, Ms. Raptopoulos said.
   Gold settled $1.40 to $2.20 lower with the contract for delivery
in June at $459 a troy ounce; silver was 1.2 cents to 1.5 cents
lower with May at $6.45 a troy ounce.
   Pork futures advanced on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, with
frozen pork bellies up sharply on speculation that cash hog prices
were bound to improve in coming months, while cattle futures
advanced on higher cash prices, analysts said.
   Live cattle settled .13 cent to .65 cents higher with April at
74.95 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .20 cent to .60 cent higher
with April at 79.30 cents a pound; hogs were .20 cent lower to .83
cent higher with April at 44.50 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies
were .30 cent to 1.30 cents higher with May at 53.40 cents a pound.
   Oil prices continued to slide on the New York Mercantile
Exchange amid profit-taking and a lack of new developments in the
Persian Gulf, analysts said.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 6 cents to 29 cents
lower with May at $17.74 a barrel; heating oil was .37 cent to .55
cent lower with May at 49.31 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was
.27 cent to .72 cent lower with May at 51.42 cents a gallon.
   Corn and soybean futures settled lower _ soybeans sharply so _
on the Chicago Board of Trade as rain washed away fears about
weather damage to crops in the Plains states. Wheat advanced
slightly.
   ``I think the markets are going through their usual gyrations
this time of year,'' said Walter Spilka, an analyst in New York
with Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co. ``You get a brief rally on
weather information, then you get a little rain in the corn belt
and that puts some pressure on the markets just because they've
been up a little.''
   Wheat futures were supported by expectatons of new export
business, analysts said.
   Wheat settled 1 cent to 1} cents higher with May at $3.15} a
bushel; corn was 1 cent to 1\ cents lower with May at $2.04\ a
bushel; oats were 2 cents lower to \ cent higher with May at $1.66{
a bushel; soybeans were 5\ cents to 6{ cents lower with May at
$6.66} a bushel.
   Stock-index futures posted slight gains on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange, where the contract for June delivery of the
Standard & Poor's stock index settled .60 point higher at 257.90.

<HEAD>Connecticut Leads Nation In Per Capita Income</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: CORRECTS last graf to show that per capita income fell in
Wyoming and Alaska.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>

   Connecticut residents had the highest average
income in the nation last year, more than double the per capita
income of Mississippi residents, who had the lowest, the government
said Wednesday.
   The Commerce Department said that residents of Connecticut
earned $20,980 for every adult and child in 1987, an increase of
6.9 percent over 1986. Mississippi ranked last with a per capita
income of $10,204, a 5.2 percent increase over the previous year.
   New Jersey, with income of $20,067, ranked second and
Masschussetts, with income of $18,926, was third. The District of
Columbia, with income of $20,303, would have been second if it was
included in the rankings.
   Alaska, which took over the No.1 spot from Connecticut at the
start of the oil boom in 1973 and held it until 1985, fell to fifth
in 1987. Its average income actually fell 0.7 percent last year to
$17,886.
   Rounding out the top 10 were New York, Maryland, California, New
Hampshire, Illinois and Virginia.
   Seven of the 10 states with the lowest per capita income were in
the South. In addition to Mississippi, they were West Virginia,
Arkansas, Louisiana, Alabama, South Carolina and Kentucky. Utah,
New Mexico and Idaho _ energy and mining states _ were also in the
lowest 10.
   For the nation, per capita income averaged $15,340, a 4.8
percent increase over a year earlier. That was slower than the 5.2
percent growth rate during the previous year and the 6.1 percent
rate in 1985.
   When adjusted for inflation, which was 4.4 percent, 1987 income
growth was the smallest since the recession year of 1982.
   The state growth rates showed that the nation's bicoastal
economy _ the phenomena of a healthy economy in the Northeast and
California and a relatively weaker economy in states in between _
became more pronounced.
   New Englanders, boosted by jobs in high technology and military
industries, averaged $18,329, a 6.7 percent increase over 1986.
Income in the Mid-Atlantic states grew 6.0 percent to $17,538.
   The Southwest and Rocky Mountain states, plagued by economies
dependent on oil and mining, had the slowest growth rates. Per
capita income of $13,512 in the Southwest was only 2.2 percent
above 1986. Rocky Mountain states' average income of $13,631 was up
only 3.6 percent from the previous year.
   However, Rudolph E. DePass, an analyst with the Commerce
Department, noted that growth is accelerating from extremely low
levels in the battered Southwest and Rocky Mountain states, while
it is decelerating from higher levels elsewhere.
   In 1986, the growth rate had been 0.9 percent in the Southwest
and 3.5 percent in the Mountain states. In New England and
Mid-Atlantic states, growth rates were a booming 7.6 percent and
6.5 percent respectively.
   Wyoming was the only state, in addition to Alaska, in which
average income declined in 1987. It fell by 0.1 percent to $12,759,
but the shrinkage was not as bad as the 1.1 percent decline in 1986.

<HEAD>American Airlines Parent Records Earnings Increase</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The parent company of American Airlines Inc. reported Wednesday
its quarterly earnings more than tripled, fueled by improved market
conditions during the normally weak quarter.
   AMR Corp. reported net earnings of $68.4 million, or $1.12 per
share, for the first three months of 1988, up from $19.9 million,
or 34 cents per share, in the same quarter a year earlier.
   First-quarter revenue increased by 30.2 percent to $1.96
billion, vs. $1.5 billion in the same period a year ago.
   ``Normally, the first quarter is a period of weak traffic and
rather broad discounting. This year, we experienced both strong
demand and strong revenues,'' Chairman Robert L. Crandall said.
   The average amount of revenue per passenger mile increased by 11
percent from the prior year to 11.53 cents, while revenue passenger
miles jumped 21.5 percent.
   American, headquartered in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, serves
160 cities worldwide.
   Meanwhile, Air France, France's state-owned airline, said its
consolidated net income more than doubled last year to a record
$214 million from $100 million in 1986, but attributed most of the
increase to a change in accounting practices.
   On a comparable basis, it said, last year's net income would
have shown an increase of 72 percent, or $71.7 million.
   Air France said the improved earnings performance reflected a
14.6 percent rise in passenger traffic last year that boosted its
average load factor from 65.2 percent to 69.5 percent.

<HEAD>ITT Earnings Nearly Double in First Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ITT Corp., the insurance, financial services and
industrial products concern, reported Wednesday its profits nearly
doubled in the first quarter, but said much of the improvement was
due to an accounting change.
   ITT reported earnings of $180 million, or $1.25 per share, up
from a restated $93 million, or 60 cents per share, in the first
quarter of 1987.
   The earlier quarter's results were restated to reflect a $67
million charge for an accounting change at ITT Defense Technology.
Without the change, earnings would have improved by 20 percent, the
company said.
   Revenue for the quarter ended March 31 were $5 billion, up 10
percent from $4.5 billion in the first quarter of 1987.
   The company's insurance and finance businesses rose 12 percent
and revenues on industrial products were higher, particularly
automotive, pulp and timber.

<HEAD>Former Brewery Executive Pleads Innocent To Kickback Charges</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former Anheuser-Busch Inc. executive indicted
in an alleged kickback scheme pleaded innocent to the charges
Wednesday in federal court.
   Joseph E. Martino, who was indicted last week along with another
former brewery executive, entered the plea before U.S. Magistrate
William Bahn.
   Bahn denied Martino's request for unrestricted travel while
under indictment. Martino, who went to work for the Miller Brewing
Co. in Milwaukee after being dismissed by Anheuser-Busch last year,
will be allowed to travel only to places pre-approved by the court,
Bahn said.
   Martino and Micheal A. Orloff, who pleaded innocent last week to
the charges against him, are both accused of taking illegal
payments for sales promotion business they sent to two St.
Louis-based companies.
   Both were indicted on federal charges of mail fraud, conspiracy
and filing false income tax returns. Martino also was charged with
eight counts of interstate transporation of fraudulenty obtained
securities.
   Martino was vice president of sales for Anheuser-Busch when he
was dismissed March 12, 1987, after an internal investigation by
the company. He is now on paid leave of absence from his job as
vice president of marketing at Miller ``in order to permit him to
pursue a proper and full defense in this situation,'' a spokesman
said.
   Orloff was vice president of Anheuser-Busch's wholesale
operations when he was fired.

<HEAD>First Interstate Bancorp Reports Record Net Income</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   First Interstate Bancorp, one of the nation's largest banking
concerns, on Wednesday reported a 27 percent rise in its first
quarter profit over a year ago, when the company battled troubled
domestic and Third World loans.
   Net income for the three months ended March 31 totaled $102.6
million, or $2.20 a share, compared with earnings of $80.5 million,
or $1.69 a share.
   Chairman J.J. Pinola said First Interstate decided last year to
increase its loan-loss reserves, and that contributed to the
improvement this year.
   First Interstate posted a loss of $556.2 million for fiscal 1987
because of writeoffs and an addition to its loan-loss provision.
   Allowances for loan losses at the end of the first quarter stood
at $1.39 billion, up from $542 million a year ago. However, during
the quarter the copmany reduced its provision for loan losses to
$76.4 million from $99.5 million. Net loans charged off were $108.9
million, compared with $92.9 million, First Interstate said.
   The company said its writeoff fund increased due to its January
acquisition of Houston-based Allied Bancshares in a complex stock
swap worth between $415 million to $450 million.
   Allied held a number of distressed properties in Texas, which
has been hit by an oil industry slump. First Interstate has taken
steps to shed those properties.
   First Interstate said net interest income rose by 8.7 percent
during the quarter while non-interest income was up 4.2 percent.

<HEAD>Prices Post Advance for First Time in Week</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bond prices finished higher Wednesday for the
first time in a week as the market overcame some early worries
about inflation.
   The Treasury's key 30-year bond, which has fallen $25 per $1,000
in face amount since last Thursday, rose \ point, or about $2.50.
   The bond's yield, which moves inversely to its price and is an
important signal of interest rate trends, slipped to 9 percent from
9.04 percent late Tuesday. A week ago the bond yielded 8.73 percent.
   Bond prices initially sagged after the Labor Department reported
a 0.5 percent jump in March consumer prices, the biggest increase
since January 1987. The advance was larger than most analysts had
expected and it drove bond prices lower because it provided
additional evidence that inflation may be accelerating. Bond
investors fear inflation because it erodes the value of their
holdings.
   But bond prices reversed course later in the day and headed
higher.
   William V. Sullivan Jr., director of money market research for
the investment firm Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., said the recent
decline in bond prices has been so quick and deep that some traders
felt it may have gone too far for the moment.
   He said some traders also saw that a major reason for the strong
consumer price growth in March was rising clothing costs, and
concluded the surge could be temporary.
   ``Without the rise in apparel costs, the CPI would have been up
by 0.4 percent or so and that is seen as being more manageable,''
Sullivan said.
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, short-term
maturities edged up 1-32 point, intermediate maturities were up by
between [ point and \ point and 20-year issues rose ] point, the
financial information service Telerate Inc. reported.
   The movement of a point equals a change of $10 in the price of a
bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Merrill Lynch Daily Treasury Index, which measures price
movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities of a
year or longer, rose 0.17 to 110.52. The Shearson Lehman Hutton
Daily Treasury Bond Index, which makes a similar measurement, rose
1.65 to 1,156.33.
   In corporate trading, industrials rose } point and utilities
rose \ point in moderate dealings.
   Moody's Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures
price movements on 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years
or longer, fell 0.37 to 278.20.
   Among tax-exempt municipal bonds, prices edged down [ point in
light trading.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills rose 2 basis points to 5.82
percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
Six-month bills rose 2 basis points to 6.24 percent but year bills
were unchanged at 6.62 percent.
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, traded at 7} percent, up from 613-16 percent late Tuesday.
   Sullivan said it was unclear whether the rise in the funds rate
indicated a tightening of the Federal Reserve's money policy
because Wednesday was the end of a reserve reporting period for
banks. The short-term lending rate often rises sharply on such days
as financial institutions borrow to meet reserve requirements.

<TEXT>
   General Motors Corp. is recalling 403,900 cars,
including 307,000 1983-1986 Chevrolet Chevette and Pontiac T-1000
small cars, the nation's largest automaker said Wednesday.
   The release mechanism on the automatic transmission shift levers
on the Chevette and the T-1000 can wear out so that the knob can be
bumped from drive to reverse while the car is in motion.
   If that happens, the driver may lose control of the car, GM
said. Seven accidents and six injuries have been reported in
incidents involving the worn mechanism.
   Dealers will replace the automatic transmission shift lever with
redesigned equipment.
   GM also is recalling 22,300 1987 Buick Skylark, Oldsmobile
Calais and Pontiac Grand Am models with 2.5-liter engines and
manual transmissions for possible fuel leaks.
   The leaks occur when fuel hoses at the engine rub against a
shift lever and develop holes, GM said. Dealers will replace the
hoses and the pipes they connect with.
   About 8,200 1987-88 Spectrum Turbo models are being recalled for
defects that may cause engine fires. GM said six under-hood fires
have been reported so far in the cars, which are built by Isuzu
Motor Co. in Japan.
   The fires can occur when an oil-and-water mixture builds up in
an air inlet hose, blocking it and causing increased pressure in
the engine crankcase. The pressure can cause oil leaks that can
result in fires.
   Dealers will replace an air intake valve that may not be letting
in enough air, allowing the oil-and-water mixture to accumulate.
They also will replace the cars' fuel tank and the attached fuel
feed line because of possible corrosion leading to a fuel leak.
   GM also is recalling about 3,400 1988 Buick Century, Pontiac
6000 and Chevrolet Celebrity mid-size cars because cracks may occur
in a bracket holding a front suspension lower control arm.
   If the bracket breaks, drivers could lose the ability to steer
the car. dealers will inspect the suspension and replace faulty
brackets. GM said it has received no reports of accidents or
injuries related to the brackets.
   Dealers will make all repairs in all four recalls at no charge,
GM said.

<TEXT>
   General Motors Corp.'s financing subsidiary
reported lower first-quarter earnings Wednesday, while the
automaker's computer and electronics units both posted sharply
higher profits.
   General Motors Acceptance Corp., GM Hughes Electronics Corp. and
Electronic Data Systems Corp. all report earnings separately from
GM, which was scheduled to release its own first-quarter results
Thursday.
   GMAC, the financial, insurance and mortgage unit, said net
income was down 26 percent in the quarter ended March 31 because of
a slimmer margin between the money it makes in interest and the
cost of obtaining funds.
   The subsidiary's net income was $354.4 million, down from $481.4
million in the first quarter of 1987. GMAC has no stock issue
separate from GM's, and thus no separate per-share earnings figure,
a spokesman said.
   GMAC's total earning assets were $94.7 billion, up 9 percent
from a year earlier. The company's average cost of borrowing rose
to 7.94 percent, up from 7.67 percent in the first quarter of 1987.
   Earnings at GM Hughes Electronics Corp., the auto and
electronics subsidiary, jumped 44 percent in the first quarter.
Earnings were $251.9 million, or 63 cents per share of GM Class H
common stock, up from $175.2 million, or 44 cents a share, in the
first quarter of 1987.
   Revenues at the company _ comprising Hughes Aircraft Co. and
Delco Electronics Corp. _ were unchanged at $2.7 billion. The
earnings jump was attributed to sale of part of Hughes' stock
holdings in Nippon Avionics Co. Ltd. and to an accounting change at
Delco.
   Earnings jumped 38 percent at Electronic Data Systems Corp.,
GM's Dallas-based computer and communications services company, on
the strength of government and private data processing contracts in
the United States and Europe.
   EDS had net income of $89.1 million, or 73 cents per share of GM
Class E common stock, on revenue of $1.12 billion, up from $64.6
million, or 53 cents a share, on revenue of $1.03 billion in
first-quarter 1987.

<HEAD>New Move to Drop Plant-Closings Plan as Trade Bill Nears House
Floor</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: New throughout with plant closings provision in jeopardy</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration won a round in
skirmishing over trade legislation Wednesday, raising chances that
lawmakers might still drop plant-closings provisions believed
certain to draw a veto.
   ``It is my hope that through this motion we will be able to get
a trade bill that can actually be enacted into law,'' Minority
Leader Robert H. Michel, R-Ill., said following action in the House
Rules Committee.
   The panel granted Michel's request for a floor vote Friday on
whether to send the bill back to a House-Senate conference
committee with orders to strip out the controversial provisions
requiring employers to provide 60-day notice of all but the
smallest plant closings and large-scale layoffs.
   The Reagan administration has been threatening a presidential
veto over the plant-closings provision, and there are substantial
doubts about whether enough support exists to override such a veto.
   Lawmakers whose home districts are hungering for such other
provisions as repeal of the windfall profits tax on oil companies
and massive farm subsidies reportedly have been losing enthusiasm
for anything that would draw a veto.
   The measure's central provisions streamline the system under
which the United States imposes import curbs and takes other
actions to retaliate against trade violations and aid American
industries threatened by surges in foreign competition.
   If Michel wins his battle to send the measure back to the
conference committee, a floor vote on the bill itself, scheduled
for Thursday afternoon, in the House could be delayed.
   The Democratic-controlled Rules Committee was not obliged to
grant Michel's request for a vote to send the bill back to the
conference committee with instructions to strip out the
labor-backed plant-closings provisions.
   But Michel aide Joanna Schneider said she believed concern over
how a plant-closings veto could have affected the windfall profits
tax, the farm subsidies and a host of other narrow issues might
well have prompted lawmakers to scuttle the bill on the floor, even
without sending it back to committee.
   Rules Committee meetings are normally fairly quick but
Wednesday's action was delayed for hours because of Democratic
fears that granting Michel's request would jeopardize the
plant-closings provision.
   The Republican leader had sought earlier to delay action on
grounds of a rule that newly minted legislation should sit for a
minimum of three days before going to the passage stage on the
House floor.
   ``In this case we are dealing with a piece of legislation 1,000
pages long and containing some of the most profound changes in U.S.
trade law in a decade or more,'' Michel said in a letter to Rules
Committee Chairman Claude Pepper, D-Fla.
   ``We have yet to see the language in this legislation but
nevertheless you are clearing the way for a vote for it within 24
hours,'' he said. ``We are not even certain it will be printed in
time for the floor vote.''
   The bill itself is expected to pass the House without much
trouble when the passage vote comes. The major question has been
whether there will be enough votes to sustain a veto if the
plant-closings provision remains in.

   The government outlined a program Wednesday for
expanding market-style economic reforms while fighting inflation,
the country's most pressing economic problem.
   Reform goals for 1988 include introducing competition for
company management posts and encouraging city dwellers to buy their
homes.
   So far, these measures have been introduced only experimentally
on a small scale.
   The program, announced by the official Xinhua News Agency, also
calls for such anti-inflation measures as tightening bank credit,
limiting state investment to major civic projects and limiting the
rapid growth of workers' wages and bonuses.
   Retail prices jumped 11 percent nationwide in the first quarter
of 1988, compared with a 7.3 percent increase in 1987. The price
increases have generated widespread grumbling.
   The reform program was devised by the State Commission for
Restructuring the Economy, which drew up the blueprints for China's
transformation from a centrally planned economy to one partially
directed by market forces.
   The commission, which was headed by the reformist Zhao Ziyang
until he took over as head of the Communist Party last year, now is
led by the new premier, Li Peng.
   The plan bears Li's stamp in its emphasis on fighting inflation
and its lack of new reform ideas. Li lacks Zhao's reputation as an
innovator and is believed to favor stability over rapid change.
   Xinhua did not carry comment from Li on the plan.
   The agency said the plan calls for 80 cities, including Beijing
and Shanghai, to reform their housing systems this year, a change
that is likely to generate widespread public opposition.
   Most urban houses and apartments are owned by the government or
by workplaces, which rent them for nominal fees.
   Housing reform, intended to save the government money, calls for
rents to be increased in line with maintenance costs and for
tenants to be encouraged to buy their apartments and houses. Xinhua
said the change is to be implemented nationwide within five years.
   Some local governments have said they will initially give
citizens subsidies to soften the blow of higher rents. Many Chinese
pay as little as $1.35 a month for rent.
   Under the program described Wednesday, the government will
expand its policy of letting state-owned enterprises make their own
economic decisions, and will introduce competition in filling
management posts, Xinhua said. Most managers are currently
appointed by the government.
   The program encourages businesses to use most of their profits
to improve production and to make sure workers' incomes do not grow
faster than productivity.
   Economists have blamed rising inflation in part on companies
using profits to give workers big bonuses.
   More enterprises will be allowed to issue bonds to the public,
Xinhua said, enabling them to raise cash while soaking up some of
the money supply.
   It said the government also will issue bonds to the public and
banks to make up its projected $2.2 billion deficit for 1988.
Government investment will be limited mainly to major road, bridge
and other infrastructure projects.
   Banks will issue fewer loans and increase their supervision of
companies that borrow money, the agency said.

   GTE Corp. Chairman Theodore F. Brophy
fielded a chorus of shareholder complaints about GTE's fledgling US
Sprint venture at the company's annual meeting Wednesday, and
brushed off a dissident's ``campaign'' to become GTE president.
   Brophy continued defending GTE's joint venture with United
Telecommunications Inc., which formed the long-distance company US
Sprint on July 1, 1986.
   Several shareholders complained that US Sprint was a bad
investment and one suggested the company dispose of it. Others
noted US Sprint's major billing and record-keeping problems, which
also have been reported widely by the media.
   ``Results for the first quarter of this year indicate that work
still remains to resolve Sprint's problems,'' Brophy said. ``But
they are making progress and that work is being done. We remain
convinced that US Sprint will be a successful, long-term competitor
in the long-distance market.''
   On Tuesday, GTE reported its net income for the first quarter of
1988 increased 8 percent to $286 million. The pretax loss stemming
from its 50 percent stake in US Sprint was $69.1 million, down from
$120.5 million a year earlier, while US Sprint's total revenue for
the quarter rose 23 percent to $759 million.
   Last year, US Sprint lost $1.1 billion on revenue of $3.1
billion.
   Brophy also told Paul Watson, a 32-year-old entrepreneur, that
he could not be named president of US Sprint.
   Watson, a former subcontractor for the two companies' US Sprint
Communications Co. phone joint venture, already won $1.7 million in
a contract dispute with US Sprint.
   Now he wants to be president and promises to reform the billing
problems besetting the company. Watson also has launched a
campaign, complete with T-shirts that read, ``Sprint lost a
$billion$. Paul made a $million$. Make Paul President.''
   However, the job as president already is filled. Also, the
president is not chosen by shareholders, but by a six-member
committee of GTE and United executives.
   ``You have been given a complete answer by US Sprint,'' Brophy
said. ``Today is not the Connecticut primary and we are not
planning to vote on you as president of Sprint.''
   It was the last GTE annual meeting as chairman for Brophy, who
at 65 has reached the company's mandatory retirement age for
employees in policy-making position.
   Brophy, who has been chairman for 12 of his 30 years with GTE,
was succeeded Wednesday by James L. Johnson, GTE president and
chief operating officer.

   The Supreme Court on Wednesday upheld a law
requiring municipal or state bonds issued after June 30, 1983, to
be registered before they can be tax-exempt.
   The justices, by a 7-1 vote, ruled that the federal law enacted
to discourage tax evasion in the trading of municipal bonds does
not violate any state's sovereign immunity.
   In other cases, the court also ruled that:
   _Unions may distribute handbills urging consumers to boycott
``neutral employers'' against whom the unions have no grievance.
   _The government may disqualify military veterans who are
alcoholics from receiving benefits by viewing their condition as
``willful misconduct'' rather than an uncontrollable disease.
   South Carolina had challenged the municipal bond registration
law, arguing that it will hurt state and local governments by
forcing them to chose between two costly alternatives: Continue to
issue unregistered bonds for which investors will have their
interest taxed or pay sizeable registration fees.
   State and local governments issue bonds to finance various
projects such as building roads and schools.
   More than half the states had supported South Carolina's
challenge.
   The law, which took effect July 1, 1983, is aimed in part at
discouraging tax evasion when bonds change hands as gifts or are
passed on to an heir. While the interest on government bonds is
exempt from federal income tax, the bonds are taxed as gifts or as
part of an estate.
   In passing the law, Congress mainly intended to crack down on
the use of such bonds as an untraceable substitute for cash in
illegal activities, and to make it easier to catch criminals who
deal in stolen or forged securities.
   Writing for the court today, Justice William J. Brennan said,
``A nondiscriminatory federal tax on the interest earned on state
bonds does not violate the intergovernmental tax immunity
doctrine.''
   Only Justice Sandra Day O'Connor dissented, accusing the court
of overturning ``a precedent that it has honored for nearly a
hundred years'' by making state and municipal bonds subject to
possible federal taxation.
   In the union handbill case from Florida, the court ruled on an
8-0 vote that although federal labor law generally prohibits unions
from engaging in ``secondary boycott'' picketing of neutral
employers, it does not ban non-picketing activities aimed at such
businesses.
   The controversy began when the Florida Gulf Coast Building and
Construction Trades Council, a union, sought to publicize its
grievances against the High Construction Co., which was building a
store in the East Lake Square Mall in Tampa.
   The union alleged that High offered substandard wages and
benefits.
   Rather than picket or patrol the mall, union members handed out
literature urging a total consumer boycott of the 85-store mall.
   After the union refused to modify the handbills to make clear it
had no dispute with the mall's owner or any of the tenant stores,
the Edward J. DeBartolo Corp., which owns the mall, filed an unfair
labor practice claim against the union.
   The National Labor Relations Board ruled that the union's action
was banned by federal law, but the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals said that reading labor law to ban such handbilling would
raise ``serious constitutional issues.''
   By reading federal labor law to allow the union's handbilling,
the justices avoided having to decide the constitutional
free-speech issue presented by the case.
   In a separate decision, the court ruled by a 6-2 vote in a
California case that forcing employers to provide free, internal
mail delivery for labor union literature aimed at organizing
employees violates the federal law giving the U.S. Postal Service a
monopoly.
   The justices reversed a decision by the state Public Employment
Relations Board granting the free mail delivery for Local 371 of
the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees.
   The union had filed an unfair labor practice charge against the
University of California in 1979 after being denied free use of the
intercampus mail system at its Berkeley campus.
   In the alcoholism case, the court ruled by a 4-3 vote that the
Veterans Administration, in denying benefits to two men, did not
violate a federal law protecting the rights of the handicapped.
   The court did not decide whether alcoholism is a disease, but
said the VA is not compelled to regard it as such.
