   Lee Grant's boss says the veteran salesman
was fired because of his unseemly habit of wearing loud and ugly
sport coats. Grant, 62, had filed a discrimination suit to prove he
was forced out because of his age.
   Grant said before he lost his job at Darby Buick in Sarasota in
May 1985, the dealership was undergoing a ``new image'' campaign
and he was told to start wearing sport coats on the used car lot
for a more professional look.
   The 30-year sales veteran promptly went shopping for two jackets
he describes as a pale pink and a rainbow plaid. He said the latter
has every color in it and goes well with his gray slacks or green
or red or blue.
   ``I saw nothing wrong with them,'' Grant said in a sworn
statement in U.S. District Court in Tampa. At 6-foot-8, he said, he
has to buy his clothes at specialty shops that fit tall men. And he
wanted coats to go with his different trousers.
   ``So that's what I bought, you know, because I had gray pants,
blue pants, green pants, every kind. So you had to have something
to go with all of them.''
   But his boss, C. Conrad Darby III, said that neither jacket went
well with the image he was trying to create for his dealership.
   ``Rather than promote an image of professionalism, Grant's
selections took the opposite direction,'' an attorney for Darby
Buick said in court documents. ``One jacket was multi-colored ...
and the other was a loud fuchsia color.''
   In the lawsuit, wryly dubbed ``the dress of a salesman'' in
courthouse corridors, Grant claims the dress code and other charges
against him, including catnapping and snacking in the office, are
pretexts to hide the real problem _ age bias.
   Grant, the oldest salesman and the dealership's top in used car
sales in 1984, was replaced by a less experienced person in his
20s, was never reprimanded and had an excellent job performance
record, said Grant's attorney, Nancy K. Donnellan.
   Darby's attorney, William E. Sizemore, acknowledged that Grant
was among the best in the sales force. As a result, Sizemore said,
there was no motive to fire Grant for age discrimination, only for
his poor behavior.
   The case is expected to go to trial this month.

   A wallaroo apparently blinded by the milk of
human kindness underwent cataract surgery by two doctors who
volunteered their services and usually treat people.
   In Saturday's three-hour operation, Dr. Raymond Weinstein, a
family practitioner, and Dr. Gene Zdenek, an ophthalmologist,
removed a marble-sized cataract from the eye of the animal, a
stocky kangaroo. The doctors tentatively declared the operation a
success.
   Weinstein said an improper diet probably blinded the animal,
named Menehuni, who apparently had been blind most of its seven to
11 years.
   Milk sugars collect in the eyes of wallaroos and cause cataracts
because the animals cannot break them down, Weinstein said.
   ``This poor guy's condition illustrates the reason why most
people shouldn't have exotic animals,'' Zdenek said. ``The people
probably had no idea they were blinding their pet.''
   State authorities took Menehuni from its owners and gave him to
the Wildlife Way Station in the Angeles National Forest, a
nonprofit group that cares for exotic and wild animals that are
sick or abandoned.
   The surgery was performed for free at the station with the help
of resident veterinarian Silvio Santinelli.
   Weinstein said it was the first time he had to worry about
``moving a patient's tail out of the way.''

   Dorothy was coming downstairs for some tea when
she heard five shots in the middle of the night. Right away she
thought of police Sgt. Edward Byrne, sitting alone in a patrol car
a block away, guarding the home of a threatened witness.
   ``I said, `Oh my God, he's in trouble,''' she recalled.
   Now, sitting in her tidy living room in the South Jamaica
section of Queens, Dorothy _ a middle-age woman afraid to give her
last name _ mourns Byrne, 22, a rookie who police believe was slain
on the orders of a jailed drug kingpin.
   And she mourns for her neighborhood of small wood-frame houses
that once must have seemed promising to working-class people
looking for a slice of prosperity.
   It doesn't anymore.
   South Jamaica has been overwhelmed by drugs, especially crack,
in an epidemic that reached a peak of violence in the murder of
Byrne, who was guarding the home of a man who had complained about
drug dealers.
   Although police have taken the neighborhood by storm in efforts
to ferret out Byrne's killers and drive away the drug merchants,
residents remain cynical and scared.
   South Jamaica, solidly black and poor, has been a troubled
neighborhood for a long time. It shows in peeling paint, sagging
porches, abandoned storefronts.
   But things have taken a turn for the worse in the past few years
and police, clergy and residents blame crack and the people who
sell it.
   ``They have taken over, completely taken over,'' said City
Councilman Archie Spigner, who represents South Jamaica.
``Everywhere I go, there are complaints. Every community meeting I
attend, the inevitable complaint is narcotics.''
   The users commit other crimes to support their habits. Children,
seeing drug dealers in flashy clothes and fancy cars, are drawn to
the drug life. Lawbreakers are drawn to the neighborhood. And
dealers engage in turf wars that endanger all around them.
   ``You hear gunshots here and you hear gunshots there,'' said
Richard Barnes, who lost a new television set and a videocassette
recorder in a burglary he blames on drug addicts. ``If I had the
money, I'd move.''
   When crack first spread through New York City several years ago,
experts said it was sold by small-time entrepreneurs who would buy
an ounce of cocaine and process it into a flaky, smokable drug.
   But now officials say a new hierarchy of violent, well-armed
drug kingpins is taking over the crack trade in Queens.
   ``It starts in a very low-key way,'' said William Hopkins, who
supervises the Street Research Unit of the state Division of
Substance Abuse Services. An entrepreneur begins selling drugs in a
neighborhood and builds up a reputation. Buyers begin driving into
the neighborhood.
   After a while, the dealer's success comes to the attention of a
nearby drug gang. They make him an offer that he can't refuse,
``Work for us or get killed.''
   ``Once that organized group comes in there, you're dealing with
guns and it's not easy to get rid of,'' Hopkins said.
   What makes a neighborhood susceptible to drug infestation,
beyond having at least some drug users?
   James Beshers, a demographer at Queens College, believes that an
influx of different ethnic groups into a neighborhood can create a
breakdown in the social structure that is conducive to illegal
activity.
   ``You get a loss of communication,'' Beshers said. He noted that
South Jamaica has seen an influx of Asian and West Indian
immigrants who can't necessarily communicate well with each other
or with the established residents, mostly blacks who grew up in New
York or in the South.
   For Archie Spigner, the reason for the infestation in South
Jamaica is more prosaic: ``The police just allowed it to exist.
They just accepted it, and it became entrenched, it became
institutionalized.''
   The Police Department, shocked by Byrne's murder, has set out to
end such criticism. Police Commissioner Benjamin Ward announced
plans last week for a new, 118-member Tactical Narcotics Team whose
mission is to stamp out drug dealing in southeast Queens.
   And an intense investigation has already led to the indictment
of four men on charges of murdering the young cop.
   But skepticism runs high in South Jamaica, where some residents
are bitter that it took the murder of a police officer to bring
attention to their plight.
   ``What about the kids being killed in the drug wars?'' asked a
man who walked down a street a block from the murder site and
refused to give his name. ``That's what people ought to be crying
about. I know about 10 cases of young kids getting killed in the
neighborhood, and nobody ever did anything about that.''

   Porno star John Holmes, who boasted of 14,000
sexual conquests, on and off screen, during a career in X-rated
films and peep shows that spanned two decades, died Saturday at age
43.
   Holmes, the leading male sex film star of the 1970s and early
1980s, died at the Veterans Administration Medical Center, said
adult-film producer William Amerson, a longtime friend and business
associate.
   The Los Angeles Times earlier this month quoted unidentified
sources as saying Holmes was gravely ill with AIDS. Amerson said
the cause of death was not immediately known.
   Holmes, best known for his portrayal of the character Johnny
Wadd, a detective, made thousands of peep shows and sexually
explicit films, including ``Liquid Lips,'' ``Blonde Fire,'' ``Tell
Them Johnny Wadd is Here'' and ``Exhausted.''
   He once admitted that he had a $1,000-a-day cocaine habit.
   Two weeks ago detectives again questioned Holmes at his hospital
bedside about the unsolved 1981 slayings of four people in a house
in Laurel Canyon.
   Holmes was acquitted of the slayings in 1982 but had never told
authorities what he knew about the crime.

<HEAD>Bush Under Fire From Republican Dole and Democrat Jackson</HEAD>

   With signs pointing to another Republican primary
victory by George Bush in Illinois, the vice president came under
renewed criticism Sunday from GOP rival Bob Dole and from Democrats
Jesse Jackson and Albert Gore Jr.
   Two polls published in Monday's editions of two newspapers gave
contradictory indications of how the Democratic voters were
expected to cast ballots in Tuesday's primary.
   The poll in the Chicago Tribune showed Jackson moving into the
lead, favored by 32 percent of the Democrats, Illinois Sen. Paul
Simon by 29 percent and Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis by 20
percent.
   Five hundred likely Democratic primary voters were contacted
Thursday and Friday and the survey had a margin of error of 5
percent, meaning the numbers could be off that much up or down.
   However, a poll for The Washington Post and ABC News showed
Simon holding a strong lead with 42 percent, Jackson 33 percent,
Dukakis 14 percent, Sen. Gore of Tennessee 4 percent, Rep. Richard
Gephardt of Missouri 3 percent and others and undecided, 4 percent.
That poll was based on telephone interviews Friday night and
Saturday with 287 Democratic voters who were likely to cast
ballots. The margin of error was 6 percent.
   Simon, dependent on a home-state victory to remain in the race,
said he had overcome poor showings in polls during other campaigns.
   ``If I get my message across to the people of Illinois, they're
going to vote for me,'' he said.
   The new Chicago Tribune poll indicated slippage in Simon's
support. A survey published in the Tribune on Sunday said the
senator was leading with support from 35 percent of likely
Democratic voters, while Jackson had the backing of 30 percent and
Dukakis that of 18 percent.
   Simon and Dukakis also traded barbs on the question of whether
the Democratic nomination would be determined by a brokered
convention next July in Atlanta.
   The Tribune poll on Sunday also showed Bush with a 34-point lead
over Dole. The newspaper did not continue surveying Republicans.
   Dole, struggling to revive his presidential campaign, insisted
he would fight on ``full bore'' after Illinois though he said he
had no obligation ``to look ridiculous.''
   Gore, who hopes to demonstrate some Northern support in
Illinois, said he would ``almost certainly'' turn down his party's
vice presidential nomination.
   Gore, at a campaign stop later, also blasted Bush over the
Iran-Contra affair.
   ``The Reagan-Bush administration violated the law in a brazen
way,'' he said, adding: ``We still don't know what George Bush's
role was.''
   Interviewed on the CBS show, ``Face the Nation,'' Dole said he
received telegram from former President Richard Nixon who urged him
``hang in there, don't give up, make Illinois your finest hour.''
   ``I believe I have some obligation _ not to look ridiculous _
but some obligation to stay in this race,'' said the Kansas senator.
   Asked if there was any chance he's drop out after Illinois, Dole
said, ``We're going full bore'' on the Wisconsin, which holds its
primary on April 5.
   Bush attended a Polish-language Mass at St. Hyacinth Church on
the city's northwest side and described his trip to Poland last
year and his meeting with Solidarity leader Lech Walesa.
   ``It is the United States of America that must keep alive the
hope of the Polish people,'' the vice president told a crowd that
filled the church and spilled onto the sidewalk outside.
   After church, Bush planned a day of appearances at shopping
malls and restaurants, each event described by his staff as a
``photo opportunity only.''
   On the possibility of a brokered convention, Dukakis said, ``I
can't imagine anything worse _ the idea of taking the right of the
people to elect their president with their votes and putting it in
some backrooms in Atlanta.''
   Simon, predicting no Democrat would be able win the nomination
on the first ballot at the convention, said Dukakis' attitude
demonstrated ``a touch of arrogance.'' He described the
Massachusetts governor as saying, ``You either vote for me or
you'll have a brokered convention.''
   Gore also came to Simon's defense and criticized Dukakis,
saying, ``Gov. Dukakis' commercial tries to lump him in with
back-room politics of a kind Paul Simon has not been associated
with.''
   Jackson, fresh from a victory in Democratic caucuses in South
Carolina on Saturday where he won 54 percent of the vote and picked
up 23 delegates, said he hoped by the end of the primary and caucus
season in June to have received ``a majority of the popular vote.''
   Asked about the prospects of running against Bush in the general
election, Jackson said on the NBC show, ``Meet the Press,'' ``He
certainly has a lot of baggage.
   ``George Bush was supposed to be over the commission on the drug
situation, yet drugs are coming into this country at a rate that
threatens our national security. ... To that continuous flow of
drugs, Mrs. Reagan says no and George Bush says nothing.''
   The latest Associated Press delegate count showed Dukakis the
Democratyic leader with 460 and Jackson second with 423. Gore was
third with 352. A total of 2,082 is needed for the nomination.
   On the Republican side, Bush had 705 and Dole 165, with 1,139
need for the nomination.
   Gore, who received 18 percent of the South Carolina vote and 6
delegates, said he consideed that ``a very good showing.''
   ``I don't know of anyone weho was surprised to see Jesse Jackson
win a big victory in his home state, his native state,'' the
Tennessee senator said on ``Face the Nation.''
   Dole denied he dislikes Bush, but said, ``I do believe that he's
sort of had a charmed life in politics, he's gotten quite a ways
without doing very much. Maybe that's a key to success I hadn't
thought of.''
   The senator renewed his debate challenge to Bush and raised
again the question of a possible tie between the vice president and
Panamanian strong man Gen. Manuel Noriega who has been accused of
involvement in drug trafficking.
   ``I'd like George Bush to tell us whether Noriega was on his
payroll when he was CIA director,'' said Dole.
   As for his prospects for a comeback, Dole said, ``Sooner or
later, the voters in one of these states are going to say, wait a
minute, we're about to nominate someone who can't win in November.''

   Jesse Jackson won easily Saturday in his
native South Carolina's Democratic precinct caucuses, giving his
already surging campaign a boost just days before the primary in
his adopted Illinois.
   ``Just because you're born in the slum doesn't mean the slum's
borne in you,'' Jackson said in Greenville. ``I came home tonight
to tell America there is a way out.''
   With 93 percent of the state's 1,788 precincts reporting,
Jackson won 8,114 county convention delegates for 54 percent,
followed by uncommitted with 2,853 delegates for 19 percent.
   Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore Jr. was in third place with 2,777
delegates for 18 percent.
   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis trailed far behind with 1,018
county convention delegates for 7 percent, followed by Missouri
Rep. Richard Gephardt with 307 delegates for 2 percent and Illinois
Sen. Paul Simon with just 36 delegates.
   If the results of the caucuses hold up at the state convention
in April, Jackson would win 23 delegates to the Democratic National
Convention, 15 would be uncommitted and Gore would gain 6. In
addition another four party officials in the state, who
automatically are delegates to the national convention, have said
they are uncommitted.
   The results from South Carolina put Jackson's overall national
delegate tally at 423.55, just behind Dukakis, who has 460.5.
   ``In South Carolina ... I want to win another gold medal,''
Jackson said, noting his strong showing in the Super Tuesday
primaries.
   ``I hope to walk away with the majority,'' Jackson said. ``I
should be the favorite son from South Carolina.''
   Gephardt, who was campaigning in Michigan, congratulated Jackson
on his victory, saying ``I thought he would do very well there
-it's his home state - and he did.''
   Gore spokesman Fred Martin called his candidate's performance
``a strong showing'' and added ``we expect to pick up a majority of
the uncommitted.''
   Democratic Party officials expected as many as 20,000 voters
would participate in the caucuses in which 44 convention delegates
were at stake.
   During a campaign swing across the state Friday, Jackson
predicted he would emerge as the leader in the muddled race for
convention delegates once the votes are tallied in South Carolina
and Illinois, which holds a primary on Tuesday.
   Jackson trails Dukakis but leads Gore in the race for delegates
to the Democratic National Convention.
   Gore has waged an active campaign in the state and a newspaper
survey of Democratic Party chairmen statewide found Gore expected
to finish second to Jackson.
   In the past, South Carolina Democrats have had a penchant for
going to the caucuses and voting for uncommitted delegates. Jackson
was the top candidate four years ago but a plurality of the
delegates remained uncommitted at the precinct level.
   This time around, campaign aides for Gephardt and Simon, were
asking their supporters to remain uncommitted and work to become
delegates at county conventions later in the month.
   But Gore urged supporters during a stop in Charleston Friday to
stand up for his candidacy and ``don't let anyone talk you into
being an uncommitted delegate.'' Dukakis aides wanted voters to
commit to him.
   The caucuses are the first stage of a three-stage process to
select national convention delegates. Voters were to select
delegates to the county conventions which in turn selects delegates
to the state convention.
   The delegates are divided proportionally based on a candidates'
showing. But only those candidates with 15 percent of the vote at
the state convention are entitled to national convention delegates.
Delegates selected Saturday are bound to their candidates through
the county and state conventions.
   Jake Hill, Gore's assistant campaign coordinator, suggested
neither Gephardt nor Simon would be able to round up the 15 percent
of votes to allow them to receive any delegates.
   The campaigns would ask their people to stay uncommitted in the
hopes something could be worked out at the county or state
conventions to allow them to secure some delegates, he suggested.
   Although the caucuses have been overshadowed by South Carolina's
Republican primary and the parade of GOP candidates it attracted,
Gephardt, Gore and Jackson all stumped in the state during the past
week.
   Gephardt had the endorsements of former Govs. Dick Riley and
Robert McNair. He promoted his trade policy this week at a campaign
stop at a Clearwater textile plant that will be closed next month.
   But during the stop, Gephardt said he hoped to get his campaign
back on track by winning the Michigan primary March 26.
   While Dukakis and Simon both campaigned in the state earlier,
neither has returned in recent weeks.

   A storm packing winds of up to 60 miles
per hour capsized scores of small fishing boats, flattened hundreds
of mud and straw huts and at least 15 people were feared dead,
police said Sunday.
   Rescue workers searched the banks of the Jamuna River on Sunday
for survivors of the Friday storm in Mankiganj District, northwest
of Dhaka, officials said.
   ``We see slim chances that the missing are still surviving,''
said a police official in Manikganj, who spoke in a telephone
interview on condition of anonymity.
   He said no bodies had yet been recovered.
   The storm along the river was slow in being reported because the
wind also damaged electrical and telephone wires in the region.
   More than 300 mud and straw huts were flattened, and trees and
crops damaged, officials said. More than 50 fishing boats were
believed capsized or sunk.

<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iraq said Sunday its warplanes attacked a
supertanker off the Iranian coast, while its ground forces beat
back an Iranian offensive in a pre-dawn battle in the central
sector of the war front.
   The official Iraqi News Agency, monitored in Nicosia, reported
more than 1,000 Iranians were killed in the 3{-hour battle which
began at 1 a.m.
   INA said two Iranian brigades, backed by tanks and artillery,
were involved in the thrust.
   ``Infantry units of Iraq's 2nd Army Corps repulsed the thrust,
exterminating the bulk of the force. More than 1,000 Iranians were
killed and the others were forced to retreat,'' the agency quoted
an unnamed spokesman as saying.
   There was no immediate word from Iran on the reported battle.
   Iraq did not say where exactly the battle took place, but
judging from the size of the force, the attack did not appear to
signal the beginning of Iran's long-awaited major offensive.
   The large-scale attack is expected to be launched in the
southern sector of the 730-mile front around Basra, Iraq's
second-largest city and its only outlet to the Persian Gulf.
   Iran's last thrust in January 1987, brought Iranian troops to
within six miles of Basra. But Western military analysts say Iran
has had difficulties mobilizing forces needed for a new attack.
   In a separate dispatch, INA quoted a military spokesman as
saying Iraqi planes ``dealt an accurate and effective blow to a
very large maritime target,'' a reference to a supertanker, off the
Iranian coast during the night.
   The report could not be immediately confirmed.

<HEAD>Challenger: Why U.S. Settled With Some Astronauts And Not Others</HEAD>

   Ellison Onizuka and Michael Smith both were
military officers. They trained together for two years to be
astronauts. And they died together when the space shuttle
Challenger blew up above the Florida coast.
   Though both were servicemen, the government contributed to a
money award for Air Force Lt. Col. Onizuka's relatives but went to
court to avoid paying damages in Navy Cmdr. Smith's case.
   Dick Scobee, Judith Resnik and Ronald McNair were civilian NASA
astronauts who died in the Jan. 28, 1986, explosion. The government
contributed to a settlement with Scobee's dependents, but refused
to contribute to settlements reached with the Resnik and McNair
families by rocket maker Morton Thiokol.
   ``I'm hoping some of this inequity will lead to legislation to
address the problems of the government's negligence,'' says lawyer
Michael D. Oldak, Resnik's ex-husband.
   Why did the government settle with some astronaut families and
not with others?
   One crucial difference: the families of Resnik, Smith, and
McNair hired lawyers to negotiate for them. Their lawyers objected
to Justice Department positions in the case, and these three
families are not likely to see any money from the government.
   The government did settle _ along with Thiokol _ with the four
families who hired no lawyers: the Scobees, the Onizukas and the
survivors of the two non-government crew members, teacher Christa
McAuliffe and Hughes Aircraft engineer Gregory Jarvis.
   These four spouses and six children shared in cash and annuities
that cost $7,735,000. The government paid 40 percent; Thiokol, 60
percent.
   They had relied on informal advice from the law partner of
McAuliffe's husband, Steven, and they talked only with the
government, never directly with the company.
   Another difference is that once those four cases were settled
Dec. 29, 1986, Justice Department lawyers took an our-way-or-no-way
approach to negotiating with the other families.
   The government sought to apply the same formula for financial
benefits to each family. At the same time, it tried to negotiate a
legal minefield bounded by two key Supreme Court decisions.
   In one decision, the high court gave the government immunity
from being sued for damages for its military and civilian employees
who are killed on the job. Justice Department lawyers did not want
to see that doctrine weakened.
   In the other decision, the Supreme Court said a contractor who
pays damages for the death of a federal worker can try to get some
of that money back from the government, if federal employees shared
in the blame.
   The government did not want to be dragged into court by Thiokol
for a replay of the errors by government officials who spurned the
protests of company engineers that it was too cold to launch
Challenger.
   The two decisions left the government with direct liability for
two Challenger astronauts and only indirect liability for the five
federal workers aboard. The Justice Department's solution: settle
only when the company also was a party.
   The split between the families had its roots in the government's
financial benefit formula, based on the number and age of
dependents and their needs and goals.
   Justice spokeswoman Amy Brown said ``generous offers based on
the same formula'' were made to all seven families. But the
families with lawyers rejected them.
   The formula left out an element common to most court-awarded
damages _ a calculation of lost wages.
   Legal experts say this benefited the McAuliffe family, because
the earning potential of public school teacher Christa McAuliffe
was dwarfed by that of her fellow crew members, who were engineers
and physicists, all but one with advanced degrees.
   One lawyer involved in the negotiations said Steven McAuliffe
helped devise the formula and pressed other families to accept it
because the government wanted a package settlement.
   A single settlement covering military, civilian federal and
non-government crew members would ease the government's legal
problem of having direct liability for some and indirect liability
for others, this source said.
   But the benefit formula did not offer enough money to satisfy
Michael Oldak, lawyer for Resnik's divorced father, Marvin, and her
niece and nephew. A 36-year-old, Ph.D. engineer, Resnik was the
only astronaut with neither spouse nor children.
   Oldak said the formula only provided several hundred thousand
dollars for the Resniks _ between a quarter and a half of what the
government and company were offering the other families.
   After rejecting two government-company offers, Oldak went to
Thiokol.
   The company was agreeable to a joint government-company
settlement with the Resniks for an amount roughly equal to that of
Jarvis' widow, Marcia. Hers was the lowest of the four settlements
because the Jarvises had no children.
   Thiokol would even make up the difference between this figure
and the government-company offer that Oldak had rejected.
   Checking with Marcia Jarvis and other relatives, Oldak found
none who objected to bending the formula this much.
   But Justice officials heard differently. ``It's not accurate
that it would not offend other families,'' said Justice's Brown.
``One might have said OK. Two might have, but all of them would not
subscribe to that. Concern was voiced that an offer might not be in
line with the formula used for the others, and we couldn't do
that.''
   Last July, Thiokol lawyer John W. Adler wrote the government,
``I don't believe that the department's position with respect to
the Resnik claim has been fair either to the Resnik claimants or to
Morton Thiokol.''
   Ulimately, Thiokol settled alone with the Resniks; the
astronaut's father said it came to $2 million to $3.5 million.
   Thiokol also settled with McNair's widow and two infants. Their
lawyer, Ronald Krist of Houston, says he would not let the family
accept a joint government-company offer as low that accepted by the
other families.
   He offered to settle separately with the government for whatever
it calculated its share was, and he would take on Thiokol
independently. But the government refused.
   Justice's Brown explained, ``We couldn't settle on behalf of the
government alone, because there was no direct government liability.
Our settlement offers were all on behalf of both the government and
the company.''
   But the joint settlements left the question of liability too
murky for Smith's widow, Jane. ``She didn't feel justice was being
served,'' her lawyer, William F. Maready said. ``She feels now that
the people whose negligence caused the accident should be
accountable for their actions.''
   She sued Thiokol, the government and Lawrence Mulloy, the NASA
engineer responsible for the booster rocket that was blamed for the
accident.
   But last year, the Supreme Court expanded its 35-year-old
doctrine that military survivors may not sue the government. It
extended the government's immunity to a case like the Challenger
disaster, where a military pilot was killed while supervised by
federal civilian employees.
   Government lawyers appeared in court and got both the government
and Mulloy dismissed as defendants.
   Maready has filed notice he intends to appeal.
   ``That ruling says, in effect, that a military person is a
second class citizen, that no matter how negligent our government
was in this situation that the people in the agencies involved
aren't accountable,'' Maready said. ``It's a dangerous thing for
the space program to be run by people who aren't fully
accountable.''

<HEAD>Despite Summit Agreement, Requests Mounting for More 1988 Federal
Spending</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The highly touted budget summit agreement,
long since enacted into law, definitively settled the question of
how much money the federal government should spend this year. Right?
   Wrong.
   Congressional leaders are girding for a fight over whether
spending in fiscal year 1988, which is nearly half over, needs to
be increased.
   Whether lawmakers adhere to the summit pact and only provide
extra money for what the agreement called ``dire emergencies''
rests on whether they succumb to the urge to spend more _ an urging
fueled by the fact that this is an election year.
   In an era of $1 trillion federal budgets, requests for an
additional several billion dollars for unforeseen needs are made by
the White House and approved by Congress virtually every year. They
are called supplemental spending bills.
   But the budget pact concluded by President Reagan and
congressional leaders forbade supplementals ``except in the case of
dire emergency.'' The term was left undefined.
   Lawmakers are already beginning to submit new spending proposals
said to be for dire emergencies. One, with 37 co-sponsors, would
provide $105 million to the financially strapped Coast Guard.
Another, with 20 co-sponsors, would add $263 million in spending
for the homeless.
   ``My experience around here is it's sort of like a pent-up lake
and the dam could break very easily,'' Sen. Pete V. Domenici of New
Mexico, senior Republican on the Budget Committee and one of the
negotiators at last fall's budget summit, says of the congressional
proclivity for spending money.
   House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, said last week that he
interprets dire emergencies to include crises such as natural
disasters or military operations.
   ``Aside from that kind of thing, it's not our expectation, nor
our intention'' to approve other kinds of new spending, Wright said.
   Indeed, many lawmakers seem to believe that in this election
year it could be bad politics to openly preach more spending
because of the effect on the deficit.
   There is another reason for Democrats to be leery of a
supplemental spending bill. Many of them believe it could become a
way for aid to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels to be restored.
   ``The administration will ultimately use the supplemental for
Contra aid,'' predicts Rep. Vic Fazio, D-Calif.
   Despite those incentives, some are pessimistic that lawmakers
seeking new spending will be thwarted.
   ``They'll be caving, and it's unfortunate,'' said Rep. Delbert
Latta of Ohio, ranking Republican on the House Budget Committee and
another summit participant. ``It seems like per usual, everybody's
got their program they're particularly interested in that's just
not getting enough money.''
   Lawmakers will be watching closely this week, when the
administration says it will submit a supplemental spending bill of
its own.
   The package is expected by congressional aides to be worth
between $1 billion and $2 billion, but administration officials say
it will produce no red ink. Instead, they say the spending for
veterans, black lung benefits, the judicial branch, Coast Guard,
prisons and other programs will be offset by cuts in other
unspecified areas.
   If legislators believe that some of the spending in Reagan's
request is not truly for emergencies, some lawmakers might be
encouraged to press for money for programs they favor.
   Under any circumstances, some members of Congress might try to
attach their requests for new spending to the Reagan proposal. Such
requests, once submitted, might be hard for other lawmakers to
resist, especially with elections coming in a few months.
   For example, the Coast guard, because it is low on money, has
already announced plans to curtail more than half of its drug
enforcement patrols and to close several facilities. Members could
be hard-pressed to vote against restoring such cuts.
   Even if such efforts lose, lawmakers lose nothing by introducing
them and showing their constituents that at least they tried.
   ``This is how they start brewing the stew,'' said one
congressional aide, who asked not to be identified, about how extra
spending gets generated.

<HEAD>Company Says Alarms Faulty On Some Machines Monitoring Babies'
Breathing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As many as 5,000 machines designed to monitor
babies at risk of sudden infant death syndrome have faulty alarms
that could leave infants vulnerable to death or injury, warns the
company that makes them.
   The devices, manufactured by Aequitron Medical Inc., are
designed to sound an alarm if an infant suddenly stops breathing or
has an abnormal heart rate. But the machines have a ``higher than
acceptable failure rate,'' the company's president, George A.
Jackson, said last week.
   The company issued a safety alert, warning dealers about the
defect in its new model, No. 9200, which has been shipped to homes
and hospitals nationwide since last July. The alert does not affect
about 40,000 earlier models.
   Jackson said that no injuries or deaths have been reported, but
that the company learned within the last two or three weeks that
the alarm had failed in some instances.
   The device primarily is used in homes to monitor children
believed to be at high risk for SIDS. The mysterious malady is the
seventh leading killer of younger Americans, according to the
national Centers for Disease Control.
   In some cases, the infants suffer from apnea, a tendency to stop
breathing while asleep, Jackson said. If the alarm sounds in time,
an adult often can awaken the child and restart his or her
breathing.
   Jackson said the company is notifying its dealers about the
problem by registered letter. The dealers will alert individual
customers, who lease the machines for home use.

<HEAD>Prosecutors Drop Fraud Count Due To Defendant's Memory Loss</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BECKLEY, W.Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal prosecutors say they have dropped
a fraud count against a former insurance agent who lost all memory
of his alleged crime after suffering a heart attack.
   Robert S. Jones, 52, had been charged with pocketing $76,386 by
filing a false insurance policy claim. Federal prosecutors
dismissed the charge Friday, basing their decision on medical
opinion that Jones is unable to proceed in court.
   Prosecutors said Jones filled out a bogus life insurance form on
Dec. 14, 1983, backdated it and invented a fake beneficiary to
receive the money from his former employer, Peoples Life Insurance
Co.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney R. Lynette Ranson said Jones scanned
newspapers for stories on violent or accidental deaths and used
those victims' names in the fraudulent policies.
   She said Jones had used the scheme more than once but said
prosecutors agreed to press only one count in exchange for a guilty
plea.
   But Jones' deteriorating health prevented him from ever making a
plea, Ranson said.
   ``We thought ... that he was playing games, and that's why we
held off for a long time,'' Ranson said. ``But he really is in bad
shape.''
   Jones was disabled since November 1986, when he suffered a
cardiac arrest that included ``one episode of sudden death,''
according to Dr. M.I. Dababnah.
   The seizure came three months after Jones was charged. It
apparently caused him to lose his memory, Dababnah said in reports
to federal court.
   That diagnosis was supported by Dr. Thomas E. Andrews, a
clinical psychologist for the West Virginia Disability
Determination Service.
   ``He has virtually no memory for significant events within the
last five years,'' Andrews advised the court.

   A man who said his hearing was damaged
when a Lufthansa airline attendant spilled hot drinks over his head
has won nearly $40,000 in damages, a newspaper reported Sunday.
   The plaintiff, a Bahraini lawyer identified as Abdul-Wahab Ahmed
bin Harmas, had filed the suit against the West German airline in
Bahrain's High Civil Court.
   The lawsuit alleged negligence and said the flight attendant
accidentally spilled four pots of hot coffee and tea over his head,
according to the English-language Gulf Daily News.
   The newspaper said the court awarded him 15,000 dinars, or
$39,750, which was one-tenth the amount sought.
   The paper said the accident occurred during a flight from
Frankfurt to Bahrain, when the plane hit severe turbulence. It gave
no precise dates.
   The man's injuries led to three months' treatment in Bahrain,
England and Germany, the newspaper said.
   The court ruled that it was the airline's responsibility to
ensure the safety of passengers, the paper said. Lufthansa
officials in Bahrain have refused to comment on the case.

   President Hussain Muhammad Ershad's
party increased its already wide margin in Parliament by picking up
two more seats in weekend repolling, the Election Commission
announced Sunday.
   Voting was held Saturday in nine districts where violence during
the main election March 3 had forced it to be called off. At least
13 people were killed and 300 others injured in clashes March 3,
and two more people died in bomb blasts in Dhaka during repolling
Saturday, police said.
   The country's major opposition parties, which have been waging a
campaign since November to oust Ershad, boycotted the Parliament
balloting. They contend that fair elections cannot be held until
Ershad resigns and have denounced the latest vote as fraudulent.
   Ershad's Jatiya Party had 249 seats in the 330-member house,
according to the latest results. The Election Commission said the
Combined Opposition Party, a coalition of scores of small groups,
won 18 seats. Two minor parties won two seats each, and
independents won 25 seats.
   The results in three districts have not yet been announced. In
one district, where a candidate was killed, voting has been
scheduled for April 7.
   Another 30 seats in Parliament are reserved for women, who are
chosen later.
   The major opposition parties contend that less than 1 percent of
the nation's 48 million registered voters cast ballots in the
Parliament elections. But government officials say the turnout
appeared to be more than 50 percent.
   Ershad scheduled the elections after dissolving Parliament 3{
years before its five-year term was set to expire in an effort to
appease his foes. The former army general took power in a 1982
bloodless coup and was elected president in a 1986 election.
   Major opposition parties contended that vote was fraudulent.

<TEXT>
   Charles E. ``Buddy'' Roemer III, a brash
self-styled reformer who unseated a political legend to take office
Monday as governor, says he faces ``a difficult and interesting
job'' in trying to solve Louisiana's problems.
   ``I think I'm just a representative of the people in this. I
think it's a make-or-break situation for the kinds of things we
want,'' Roemer, 44, said in a recent interview.
   As Gov. Edwin Edwards leaves office, the state faces the
immediate problems of a four-year, $1.2 billion budget deficit and
a cash shortage that threatens to shut down state government.
   Fiscal analysts have warned that the state faces as much as a $1
billion shortfall for the 1988-89 fiscal year.
   The state's unemployment rate hit 12 percent in January, one of
the highest in the nation, due primarily to the long-running
downturn in the oil and gas industry.
   At the same time, Louisiana's education systems are under
challenge as second-rate, business interests are demanding a major
overhaul of the state's tax system in order to attract new
industry, and environmental groups are calling for tougher
regulations to protect the air and water.
   Roemer, who plans major reforms in those areas and others such
as in campaign finance practices, said the challenge is unlike that
facing any other Louisiana governor.
   ``We need a combination in the next four years of a crisis
manager and a long-term planner,'' he said. ``It's rare that you
combine the two. That's what I'm going to have to do as governor.
   ``But I've got to do both to get us out of debt and build _
education development, economic development, better environment.
It's going to be a difficult and interesting job.''
   To get started, the Democratic former congressman is planning a
low-budget inauguration minus the traditional parade and inaugural
night ball. According to his transition office, only $48,000 will
be spent on the entire event, less than the $60,000 Gov. Dave Treen
spent on the stage used for his swearing-in ceremony in 1980.
   Roemer, who campaigned on the need for a ``revolution'' to turn
around the state's declining fortunes, said the first year of his
administration will be dedicated to reversing the financial
problems and creating a new image for Louisiana, often associated
with scandal.
   ``Confidence, attitude and legislative programs _ and then we
will slowly fund them over the next four years,'' he said. ``This
plan won't be magic, it won't be instant. We've had to build from
the ground up. But I'm very pleased with the progress we've made.''
   Edwards, who served as governor from 1972 to 1980 and returned
for a third term in 1984, was occupied for much of his last
administration defending himself successfully against federal
racketeering charges. As solutions for the state's budget problems,
he proposed a statewide lottery and casino gambling in New Orleans.
Roemer is opposed to both.
   Roemer said he was happy that Edwards was willing to help during
the transition between the Oct. 24 election and Monday's
inauguration.
   At Roemer's request Edwards appointed Brian Kendrick, a Baton
Rouge department store executive, as commissioner of administration.
   Edwards also approved about $36 million in budget cuts requested
by Roemer, but shielded the giant Department of Health and Human
Resources from the fiscal ax.
   Roemer is considering splitting the agency into two departments
as part of a reorganization program to be studied by a special
legislative session later this month. Short-term budget reductions
also will be on the agenda.
   Kendrick has spearheaded efforts to minimize the cash-flow
problem by pushing back more than $480 million in expenditures
until the new fiscal year begins July 1.
   The cash-saving measures include delaying payments to government
retirement systems, holding state income tax refund checks for 90
days and pushing one state payday back.
   In the meantime, Roemer said he will cut the budget back as far
as he can before the subject of taxes is broached.
   ``We are not going to raise taxes or change taxes until we cut
this budget,'' Roemer said. ``It is out of control.''

<HEAD>Papers Link Missing Scientist to Alleged Plan to Make Nuclear
Weapons</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A top Taiwanese nuclear scientist has
disappeared and may have fled to the United States with
confidential blueprints disclosing that Taiwan plans to make
nuclear weapons, newspapers reported Sunday.
   Government officials repeatedly have denied any plans to produce
nuclear weapons and said all nuclear research programs in Taiwan
are for peaceful purposes.
   On Friday, Defense Minister Cheng Wei-yuan told the lawmaking
Legislative Yuan that a warrant had been issued for the arrest of
Col. Chang Hsien-yi, 45, who was deputy director of the nuclear
energy research center at the military-run Chungshan Institute of
Science and Technology.
   Cheng said the warrant was issued because Chang had not asked
permission for leave.
   Chang has been missing since January, and officials said they
have no information on his whereabouts.
   But the mass circulation United Daily News said Chang's
daughter, Pei-fen, wrote from Georgia to a classmate at an
elementary school in Taipei last month saying she missed Taiwan.
   The letter gave no return address and the girl gave no
indication whether she was living with her father, the newspaper
said.
   Without disclosing the source of their information, several
newspapers claimed that Chang was a U.S. spy and had fled to the
United States together with his wife and three children.
   The liberal newspaper Independence Morning Post, quoting an
unidentified institute official, said Chang earlier had collected
``a whole bunch'' of pictures and confidential information on
Taiwan's nuclear plans.
   Some newspapers said Taiwan may have recycled key elements from
waste from its three nuclear power plants to make nuclear weapons.
   The United Daily News, quoting an unidentified source, said the
United States may have become suspicious of Taiwan's plans and this
may have been behind a U.S. decision earlier this year to stop
supplying Taiwan with heavy water, which is needed for nuclear
development.
   Officials were unavailable for comment because of the Sunday
holiday.

<HEAD>Visit May Offer Soviet Leader Comparisons To Soviet Reform</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL PUTZEL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev
will spend five days in this communist country studying economic
and social problems that he hopes the Soviet Union can avoid as it
embraces reform.
   Yugoslavia, which has jealously guarded its independence from
Soviet power for 40 years, presents a picture of prosperity to a
visitor from Moscow. A crush of private automobiles in the capital
and store windows displaying local and Western-made consumer goods
of every description make Moscow's truck-cluttered streets and drab
facades seem all the more barren.
   But the country's system of ``self-managed, market socialism''
is struggling with high inflation, high unemployment, widespread
labor unrest and a paralyzing $20 billion debt to Western creditors.
   And Yugoslavia's leadership must constantly perform a delicate
balancing act to prevent the country from being torn apart by
nationalistic rivalries within its borders.
   Gorbachev arrives here Monday for a five-day visit that includes
Belgrade, the northern industrial city of Ljubljana and the
southern resort city of Dubrovnik on the Adriatic.
   The Soviet leader, who has just marked the end of his third year
in power, is trying to boost the Soviet Union out of economic
stagnation. He has decentralized control over production and
introduced market forces to shake workers and managers out of their
notorious complacency.
   During his tour Gorbachev may gain some pointers on his programs
of ``perestroika,'' or restructuring of the Soviet economy, and
``glasnost,'' which encourages more open expression of ideas for
solving the nation's problems.
   With the development in recent years of a free-wheeling press
and a mixed economy that encourages both private enterprise and
central planning, Yugoslavia offers something of a window on the
future for the reform-minded Soviet leader.
   Runaway inflation and the government's powerless decrees aimed
at curing the country's economic ills serve notice that the path
may not be an easy one.
   In recent months, as ethnic minorities have attempted to take
advantage of the Soviet government's new tolerance to express their
long-held grievances, Gorbachev has faced challenges from
nationalists of several stripes.
   Despite some rioting and huge mass demonstrations in the
southern republics of Azerbaidjian and Armenia, no Soviet ethnic
group has the strength that Yugoslavian nationalities have used to
guarantee each a share of governing power at the expense of the
central authorities.
   Gorbachev is the first Soviet leader to visit Yugoslavia since
the death of Josip Broz Tito in May 1980. Tito broke with Moscow in
1948 and steered a stubbornly independent course outside the Soviet
bloc.
   After being forced by a Soviet-led blockade to open trade with
the West, Yugoslavia has since re-established economic ties with
Moscow.
   The Soviet Union today is Yugoslavia's largest trading partner,
with the Yugoslavs importing primarily crude oil and other raw
materials and exporting manufactured goods, including much-prized
shoes, clothing and technology to the Soviet Union.
   A $1.4 billion trade surplus is a subject of concern in
Belgrade, but there has been speculation the Soviets may agree to
pay off their paper debt by building a subway system for the
traffic-clogged Yugoslav capital.
   The present Yugoslav leadership, headed by an eight-member state
presidency, has continued Tito's independent political course, and
Yugoslavia remains an important nation in the non-aligned movement.
   Gorbachev is expected to formally acknowledge that special
status with the issuance during his visit of a joint declaration
guaranteeing full Yugoslavian independence.
   But in the context of his public statements in Prague and to
fellow Communist leaders in Moscow last year, the Gorbachev
declaration may signal more independence for other East European
nations as well.
   The Soviet leader has said his nation has no monopoly on the
proper path to socialism, and reform-minded leaders elsewhere in
Eastern Europe are expected to test his words with experiments
aimed at reinvigorating their own economies.
   Yugoslav deputy foreign minister, Ilija Djukic, has said the new
Soviet-Yugoslav document would update previous declarations signed
by the two countries in 1955 and 1956 and will ``further confirm
principles of non-interference on the basis of equality and
soveregnty.''

<HEAD>Soviet Deadline Near On Afghan Talks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HANNS NEUERBOURG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Talks aimed at ending the Afghan war are one day
away from a Soviet deadline for their completion, but a crucial
dispute on who will run the country still stands in the way of a
signed settlement.
   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev said last month that Soviet
troops would begin withdrawing troops from Afghanistan by mid-May
if an agreement is reached by March 15. But sources close to the
U.N.-sponsored negotiations say they don't view the deadline as
rigid.
   Delegations from the Soviet-backed government in Kabul and from
Pakistan, which is representing the Afghan resistance, both say
they are ready to extend the negotiations.
   U.N. Undersecretary General Diego Cordovez, the talks' mediator,
said he asked both sides to seek ``strengthened instructions''
during the weekend to prepare for Monday's session.
   Soviet troops intervened in Afghanistan in 1979. An estimated
115,000 troops have been helping the government fight the
U.S.-backed Moslem guerrillas.
   The latest round, the longest since the talks began in 1982,
opened with a confident mood on March 2. Two days later, an accord
was announced on an issue that had stalled negotiations for years,
with both sides agreeing on a timetable and the basic logistics for
withdrawing the Red Army troops.
   Under that accord, the pullout would be completed within nine
months after its start, with half of the troops leaving in the
first three months. Cordovez said later there remained no
``differences of substance'' that would bar tying up a peace
package of agreements.
   The agreements include a bilateral agreement pledging the two
countries to not interfere in each other's affairs and arrangements
for the return of more than 5 million Afghan refugees from
Pakistan..
   But the quick pace of the early talks quickly ran into snags.
   Pakistan's chief representative, acting Foreign Minister Zain
Noorani, said the talks were ``inching slowly'' forward, but that
he expected them to regain speed this week. He did not elaborate
why.
   The Soviet Union and its Kabul allies, represented at Geneva by
Foreign Minister Abdul Wakil, blame Pakistan for holding up final
agreement.
   They fault Pakistan's insistence on linking the proposed
settlement to the formation of a transitional government acceptable
to the resistance. Gorbachev has said that the makeup of the future
government should be decided by the Afghans themselves.
   Pakistan is insisting on a transitional government that would
allow for the safe return of anti-Soviet refugees..
   So far, Noorani has given no indication that Pakistan would drop
its demand. But sources close to the talks said Islamabad still
hopes to strike a deal with Afghanistan, perhaps on the timing of
the establishment of a new government.
   But another issue had cast an increasingly larger shadow on the
talks: superpower aid to the two opposing sides.
   On March 4, the United States demanded that all foreign military
aid to the warring parties must stop simultaneously. The Soviet
Union has flatly rejected the demand, saying the accords will leave
it free to continue military aid to Kabul after the troop
withdrawal.
   Wakil said the draft agreements provide only for a cessation of
military aid to the U.S.-backed guerrillas.
   In a strong statement on Friday, State Department spokesman
Charles E. Redman said U.S. aid to the Afghan rebels will not be
halted until the Soviets stopped their assistance to the Kabul
government. The Soviets sent troops into Afghanistan in 1979 to
prop up the wobbly Marxist government.
   The guerrillas, meanwhile, have formed their own government and
have rejected any power sharing with the Soviet-backed government
of President Najib.

   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (ap) _ Pakistan's tough stand at the
slow-moving Afghan peace talks has touched off a power struggle
among guerrilla leaders fighting the Soviet-backed Afghan
government.
   Pakistan Prime Minister Mohammad Khan Junejo has been
barnstorming the country to drum up support for his demand that an
accord on a Soviet troop withdrawal be coupled with a plan for a
future Kabul government.
   In the meantime, the fractious guerrilla alliance, whose
factions all want a voice in that new government, has been plagued
by upheaval. During the weekend, Yunis Khalis resigned as chairman
of the seven-party alliance, ostensibly for health reasons.
   But there were numerous reports, unconfirmed by guerrilla
spokesmen, that the 69-year-old Khalis quit to protest plans to
send a resistance delegation to the U.N.-sponsored peace talks at
Geneva, which resume Monday.
   Another insurgent leader, Sibghatullah Mojaddedi, pulled his
moderate Afghan National Liberation Front out of the alliance
complaining of undue pressure from the body's four-party majority
of Moslem extremists.
   Two days later, Mojaddedi returned to the fold, saying he had
received ``certain assurances'' from the fundamentalists and from
Pakistani officials. He did not elaborate.
   There has been intense Pakistani pressure on the guerrillas to
come up with an acceptable plan for forming a transitional
government that would preside over the withdrawal of the estimated
115,000 Soviet troops who back Kabul's communist rulers.
   Pakistan, which for years insisted the Soviet presence was the
root of the Afghan conflict, reversed itself this year by declaring
it would not sign an agreement that does not address Afghanistan's
political future.
   Islamabad speaks for the guerrillas at the Geneva talks and
cares for about 3.5 million Afghan refugees living in camps near
the Afghan border. It also channels U.S. arms to the guerrillas,
who are headquartered in the northwest Pakistani city of Peshawar.
   Although Moscow and Kabul have accused Islamabad of blocking
what could be an imminent Soviet pullout, Junejo's public relations
campaign indicates Pakistan's stand has solid public support.
   Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev has said his troops could begin
going home on May 15 if Islamabad and Kabul sign an agreement by
March 15.
   The deadline pressure has taken its toll on the guerrilla
alliance. While rejecting the Geneva talks because of the
guerrillas' exclusion, the alliance nevertheless responded with a
proposal for a heavily Moslem government headed by alliance leaders.
   Mojaddedi protested when the extremists used their majority to
vote in one of their own as future president, Ahmed Shah of the
Ittehad Party.
   The moderate factions favor a compromise government that could
include some communists now in power in Kabul, possibly headed by
former King Zahir Shah. Mojaddedi insisted that the 73-year-old
monarch, currently in exile in Rome, is the only neutral figure
acceptable to a majority of Afghans.
   Khalis's resignation, meanwhile, threatened to widen the split
because the next leader in line for the rotating chairmanship is
Gulbaddin Hekmatyar, head of the Hezb-i-Islami and the most
extremist Moslem guerrilla of all.
   While fending off acusations that his fighters have attacked
rival groups inside Afghanistan, Hekmatyar recently had taken to
upstaging Khalis by calling press conferences of his own to promote
Hezb-i-Islami's hardline vision of a fundamentalist Islamic regime.
   Mohammad Uaqub Sharafat, press spokesman for the alliance, said
there were plans to send a guerrilla delegation to the Geneva talks
to help clear up the confusion over the insurgents' stand.
   Even that move threatened to cause a rift.
   Rasul Sayyaf, leader of the Ittehad party, issued a statement
Sunday declaring his opposition to sending a delegation.
   ``And under no circumstances shall we agree to any kind of
direct or indirect talks with the Kabul regime or the (ruling
People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan),'' he said.
   Pakistani officials publicly have urged the guerrillas to soften
their stand in the interest of peace. But so far, the extremists
among the insurgents have equated compromise with capitulation.

   Premier Andreas Papandreou has ruled out
establishing full diplomatic relations with Israel because of
violence in Israel's occupied territories.
   Addressing Parliament, Papandreou said it ``would have been
useful to have full diplomatic relations with Israel,'' before
Greece assumed the presidency of the European Economic Community in
July.
   ``But we deeply regret that we can't do so after the recent
treatment that the state of Israel reserved for the Palestinians,''
Papandreou told the 300-member body Friday.
   Israeli bullets and beatings have left scores of Palestinians
dead in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip since anti-occupation
riots began Dec. 8.
   Greece is the only NATO-member country and EEC member that
doesn't fully recogize Israel. The two countries have maintained
diplomatic relations in each other's capitals since 1971.

<HEAD>Dissidents Detained En Route To Seminar On Ethnic Problems</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police detained at least seven dissidents and
former political prisoners who planned to attend a seminar on the
Soviet Union's increasingly volatile ethnic problems, the meeting's
organizer said Sunday.
   Lev Timofeyev told The Associated Press that the 70 people who
did attend the unsanctioned weekend seminar issued a statement
condemning the ``unreasonable and irresponsible'' behavior of
police agencies in detaining would-be participants.
   Timofeyev, a Moscow human rights activist, said the group that
met at his southern Moscow apartment learned that seven activists
from Lithuania, Georgia, Estonia and the Ukraine were taken off of
trains and planes headed for the capital.
   At least five others were told they shouldn't leave their homes
over the weekend or they would be arrested, Timofeyev said. Among
those kept under house arrest was Genrikh Altunyan, an Armenian
activist who lives in the Ukrainian city of Kharkov.
   Armenia and the neighboring republic of Azerbaijan have been the
scene of the most intense unrest among the Soviet Union's more than
100 ethnic groups.
   A dispute over control of a region in Azerbaijan known as
Nagorno-Karabakh, where more than three quarters of the population
is Armenian, triggered mass demonstrations in Yerevan in recent
weeks and rioting in the Azerbaijani city of Sumgait that killed at
least 32.
   Timofeyev, who was released from a labor camp a year ago
following a government review of political sentencings, said the
seminar adopted three resolutions that will be forwarded to the
Kremlin on how to resolve ethnic problems.
   The first demands broad public discussion of ethnic tensions to
correct widespread ignorance of the causes of nationalistic
outbursts.
   Another calls for discussion of limitations on religious freedom
and the government's propagation of atheism, which the activists
said is the root of some ethnic turmoil.
   The third proposal calls on the Soviet government to let Crimean
Tatars return to their historic homeland, the Black Sea peninsula
from which they were routed during World War II when dictator Josef
V. Stalin accused the entire population of collaborating with Nazi
invaders.
   The Tatars were exonerated two decades later, but they have been
banned from returning to the Crimea, now the site of some of the
best resorts and official retreats.
   He said the documents produced at the seminar would be
circulated among activists so the ``unofficial viewpoint'' on
nationalities questions can reach the Soviet public.

<TEXT>
   The floods of vacationing students
that once deluged this seaside community each spring have gone,
leaving some hoteliers broken and the city rethinking its economy.
   Only 100,000 college students are expected to bask this year on
the subtropical sands, made famous in the 1960 movie ``Where the
Boys Are.'' There were 350,000 in 1985.
   The loss of business has prompted 12 smaller hotels that
depended on the student crush to auction off their properties
together April 7, said Joe DeMastry of the Fisher Auction Company.
   Having paid top dollar for hotels in the early 1980 boom years,
many of them now cannot meet their mortgage payments. By selling en
masse, they hope to gain high prices by offering developers the
opportunity to assemble large tracts.
   The unmanageable hordes of sunworshipping students, who packed
hotel rooms by night and patronized businesses on the beach strip
by day, divided this resort town.
   Beach-front nightspots, vendors and student-dependent hotels
clamored for continued promotion of spring break.
   But their cries were overcome by the din of residents and
year-round businesses, snarled in springtime traffic and furious
about paying for police and cleaning up mountains of trash.
   Since 1986, when city leaders used strict law enforcement to
quell the riotous partying, the city and Broward County have been
trying to diversify their tourist clientele.
   Last year, word of strict police enforcement of parking,
drinking, and code regulations discouraged student visitors,
costing merchants $40 million and 100,000 student customers. The
Broward County Tourist Development Council said the 200,000 student
visitors spent about $80 million, one-third less than the $120
million tally from 1986, in the Fort Lauderdale area.
   Police made about 1,300 arrests during last year's spring break,
with college students comprising about one-third of them. There
were 2,506 arrests in 1986.
   Fort Lauderdale is experiencing a ``shaking out,'' said Roger
Handevidt, who plans to sell his Orton Terrace Apartment Hotel at
the auction.
   ``What's happened is the city has said, `Whoa! We can't deal
with this,''' Handevidt said of spring break. ``It was bad in 1985.
I don't know anyone who would say differently.''
   The atmosphere of drunkenness, littered streets and the stench
from people urinating in the streets drove people away, he said.
   ``The money's just not coming in, so people are selling out,''
said the manager of a small hotel, who spoke on condition of
anonymity. ``We're losing money every week.''
   Fort Lauderdale and Broward County cannot depend on a seasonal
tourism, officials said. The beach businesses are beginning to
understand that, said Nickie Grossman, Broward County commissioner
and chairwoman of the Tourism and Development Council.
   ``We want every tourist'' _ from New York Yankees fans during
baseball's spring training to Miami Dolphins fans and the teams the
Dolphins play at nearby Joe Robbie Stadium, she said.
   But spring break is not dead in Fort Lauderdale. Many students
still come to this palm-dotted shore, warmed beneath 80-degree
skies and bathed by 78-degree surf.
   ``We have a tradition at `Lyco' that for the last three years
we've won first place at the Button (nightclub) drinking, wet
T-shirt and guys' bikini contests. And we kept that tradition alive
today,'' said Dave Gibbons, one of 15 Sigma Pi fraternity brothers
visiting from Lycoming College in Williamsport, Pa.
   Only one ``small'' incident interfered with the fraternity
vacation, Gibbons said. ``We've got another buddy I tried
unsuccessfully to bail out of jail today _ and get this _ the
charge was throwing dangerous missiles, trespassing and disorderly
conduct for picking up a table with cups on it and throwing it over
a balcony.''

   Sikh extremists killed eight people in
Punjab state and two Sikh attackers died, including one who was
beaten to death by a family, the United News of India said Sunday.
   The report said the attacks occurred Saturday night and Sunday
and that most were in the Amritsar district, near the Sikh holy
city of Amritsar.
   The victims included two Hindus who were playing cards, three
Sikh communists and a Sikh police constable, the news agency said.
A Sikh man and a woman whose identities were not known also died.
   The report gave no further details.
   UNI said two Sikh gunmen were killed in separate incidents.
   One was shot by police in the Amritsar district Sunday, UNI
said. It quoted police as saying the dead man was in a Sikh group
that attacked officers during a police raid on the village of Chak
Mohar.
   The other was beaten to death by a farm family at Nikahke
village in the Faridkot district Saturday night. UNI said the
family was enraged when the gunman demanded their valuables.
   So far this year, police have blamed militant Sikhs for the
deaths of 430 people in Punjab state, where Sikhs are fighting for
a separate homeland.
   Sikhs are a religious minority in India and claim they are
discriminated against by the Hindu majority. Sikhs are the majority
in Punjab state.

<HEAD>British Producer Lines Up Witnesses Against Waldheim For TV Trial</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HENRY GOTTLIEB</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A British producer says he has lined up 70
witnesses, including some who served with Kurt Waldheim in World
War II, to give evidence at a televised ``trial'' of allegations
the Austrian president was involved in Nazi atrocities.
   The list includes some of Waldheim's subordinates and superiors
when he was an officer in the German Army from 1939 to 1945, says
Jack Saltman, who is producing the show for broadcast on U.S. and
overseas television in June.
   ``It took a lot of persuasion to get some of them to do it,''
Saltman said in a recent interview.
   With cameras rolling, lawyers will spend nine days beginning
April 13 examining witnesses as if they were in a court of law,
before a panel of retired jurists, including Shirley Hufstedler, a
former U.S. education secretary and federal Appeals Court judge.
   The program then will be edited down to four hours, ending with
the judges' decision on whether there is probable cause that
Waldheim acted contrary to the international laws of war.
   ``Nobody has any idea how it will come out,'' Saltman says.
``There's astonishingly little control over it. That's the beauty
of it.''
   The show is the latest entrant in what Waldheim himself has
called a new ``cottage industry'' _ investigating whether the
Austrian president knew about, supported or took part in atrocities
when he served the Germans in Yugoslavia and Greece during the war.
   Since the investigations began with a probe by the World Jewish
Congress in 1986, Waldheim has been denounced around the world,
been placed on a list of undesirables banned from entry to the
United States and has become the focus of a bitter debate in his
homeland.
   Waldheim has denied taking part in atrocities. Indeed, Saltman
says that in preparing for the show, he talked to the Austrian
leader for nearly an hour to get Waldheim's side of the story.
   What did Waldheim think of being ``tried'' on television? ``He
was not overjoyed,'' Saltman said. ``I don't think I'll be getting
a Christmas card this year from Kurt Waldheim.''
   Nor will Waldheim appear on the program.
   Work for the show began in May 1987, when producers at Britain's
Thames Television decided to do to Waldheim what was done several
years ago on a program called ``The Trial of Lee Harvey Oswald''
   That was a mock courtroom proceeding, using real attorneys,
judges and witnesses to the shooting of President Kennedy in Dallas
in 1963 to determine if Oswald was guilty of the crime.
   For aesthetic and legal reasons and because the participating
witnesses and lawyers would have objected, Saltman and his
colleagues at Thames Television and co-producing Home Box Office
cringe when anyone uses the word ``trial'' when describing what
they are doing to Waldheim.
   They want to avoid comparisons with the daily syndicated U.S.
show, ``People's Court,'' where a real judge settles such issues as
``The Case of the Busted Headlight.''
   The show will be a ``commission of inquiry,'' with retired
jurists from the United States, Britain, India and Sweden hearing
testimony elicited by a ``presenting counselor,'' Allan A. Ryan,
former director of the U.S. Office of Special Investigation _ the
Justice Department's Nazi-hunting wing.
   Lord Peter Rawlinson, Britain's attorney general from 1970 to
1974, will be the ``challenging counsel,'' trying to rebut the
evidence against Waldheim.
   The proceedings will be filmed in a courtroom built for the
program. Then the judges will deliberate privately for as long as
they think necessary and then deliver their opinions to the cameras
a few days before the show goes on the air.
   Like the U.S. Supreme Court, they may not agree. And like the
high court, no one _ not even the producers _ will be allowed to
hear the deliberations.
   The rules of evidence will be similar to those used in grand
jury proceedings and the judgment will not be whether Waldheim is
guilty, but whether there is enough evidence to bring an indictment.
   ``This is about as close as anyone is going to get to bringing
the Waldheim case into a court of law,'' Saltman said.
   ``No matter what we call it, the audience is going to say `this
is the trial of Kurt Waldheim' and they're going to sit at home,
and decide if he's a fascist,'' the producer said.
   According to evidence already made public, Waldheim was a German
intelligence officer familiar with reprisals against civilians to
stop guerrilla activities in Yugoslavia. Questions have also been
raised about whether he was involved in deportation of Greek Jews
to death camps and mistreatment of Allied prisoners of war.
   The controversy has been heightened by the fact that for many
years, notably during his years of service as United Nations
Secretary General, Waldheim omitted all mention of his service in
Greece and Yugoslavia in his official biography.
   Saltman said a team of investigators hired by the producers
scoured archives and searched for witnesses in Austria, Germany,
Italy, Yugoslavia, Greece, Britain, Bulgaria, Albania, Israel and
the United States.
   So far, stations in France, Scandinavia, Israel, Italy and
Australian have said they will show the program. Negotiations with
a West German station are underway. Austrian television has also
been offered a chance to buy the program, but there's no sign it
will do so, Saltman said.

   Lawmakers hoping to make Michigan the
first state to ban the sale of realistic-looking toy guns are
stockpiling ammunition to fight opponents, including toy makers and
retailers lobbying against the bill.
   Merchant groups are pushing to have any law take effect in 1991
so they can unload their plastic armories over three Christmas
seasons, instead of two.
   Toy makers argue that any legislative remedies should come from
Congress, not the states, so manufacturers don't have to make 50
different types of toy machine guns to fit the requirements of each
state.
   ``I think it would be a mass of total confusion if you regulate
an interstate industry in a non-uniform manner,'' said Aaron
Locker, general counsel for the Toy Manufacturers of America.
   Against that backdrop, Detroit Police Officer David Malhalab
told the Michigan House Consumers Committee last week that the
Legislature must deal with the problem soon.
   ``I urge you to lead the nation. Don't wait for Congress,''
Malalab said. ``By the time you come up with something, more
children are going to be killed.''
   Malhalab brought a cache of the look-alike weapons to show the
committee just how realistic the toys can look. He asked for laws
requiring markings on the toys to make it easier for police
officers to make split-second decisions.
   ``Make it a different color. Make it red. Make it blue. Make it
yellow,'' Malhalab said.
   The renewed call for a ban on the look-alike toys was sparked by
the Feb. 19 shooting death of a 13-year-old retarded boy in
California. He was gunned down by San Francisco police officers who
mistook his plastic pistol for the real thing.
   A week later, 57 Michigan House members co-sponsored a bill
requiring the barrel of any toy firearm to be permanently sealed
and colored in an ``indelible fluorescent orange.''
   But legislators also were considering if the ban were in place
how they would prevent criminals from copying the markings on fake
guns and possibly tricking police into letting down their guard.
   Rep. Timothy Walberg said he's afraid officers might see a
potential cop-killer with a colored gun and develop a false sense
of security.
   ``(Criminals) are creative people. I see no problem with them
taking a live weapon and painting it orange,'' Walberg said.
   Burbank, Calif., became the first city in the nation to ban the
sale of any toy that resembles a real weapon last September.

   Two avalanches Sunday crushed houses
in this mountanous region under a mass of snow, killing seven
people and injuring about 20, authorities said.
   No Americans were among the dead.
   In Italy, meanwhile, an Italian skier was killed when he was
buried by an avalanche on ski slopes near the Swiss border,
authorities reported.
   The snowslides in Austria followed three avalanches in the same
region Saturday that killed three people.
   Sunday's avalanches roared down Mt. Zwoelferkopf shortly after
dawn, engulfing a gas station and several houses before they
blocked a nearby railroad track, minutes after a train had passed
the area.
   The avalanches occurred in St. Anton in Tyrol province, a
well-known skiing area that has traditionally attracts Scandinavian
and British tourists.
   The massive snowslides ripped off roofs and crushed or tore off
walls of houses, some of which have stood there for 300-400 years,
a policeman said.
   Authorities said five Swedish tourists and two Austrians were
killed and about 20 others were injured. The identities of victims
and the injured were not released.
   In Innsbruck, the provincial security police headquarters put
the fatality figure in this weekend's avalanches in the Tyrol at
10, saying no more people were believed hidden under the rubble and
snow at St. Anton.
   Some of the Swedes were said to have been buried by collapsing
walls of a boarding house, one of several buildings seriously
damaged by the snow.
   Policemen said the two avalanches had a combined length of about
1,200 feet and a height of up to 33 feet.
   In Sondrio, Italy, a rescue dog located the body of Giuseppe
Rini, 37, after his wife came down the mountain to report the
avalanche, the Italian news agency ANSA said.
   Saturday, Per-Anders Lundborg, a 24-year-old Swedish tourist
from Hoerby, was killed, also near St. Anton. He was part of a
group of five Swedish skiers who triggered an avalanche in an area
barred from skiers.
   Also on Saturday, 17-year-old Gerda Schumacher from Groenebach,
West Germany, was buried and killed by masses of snow when an
avalanche hit seven people near a ski lift in the town of
Biberwier, Tyrol province.
   Two strollers were hit by a 1,500-foot-wide avalanche at
Berwang, Tyrol province, Saturday. Eckehard Leupold, 46, of
Duisburg, West Germany, was rescued from the masses of snow, but
his wife, Erika, died.
   In Tyrol and westernmost Vorarlberg province, up to 45,000
tourists, many of them foreigners, were stranded Sunday after heavy
weekend snowfalls and a series of avalanches blocked many roads in
the region.
   Vorarlberg was completely cut off from the outside after an
avalanche disrupted rail traffic on Saturday, and the only exit out
of Tyrol province was the Kufstein checkpoint on the border with
West Germany.
   Motoring clubs said the line of cars traveling northward reached
more than 15 miles in length.
   Traffic conditions were chaotic in most parts of western
Austria, including the province of Salzburg where many roads had to
be closed after half a dozen snowslides.

   Pope John Paul II is calling on the faithful
to observe St. Patrick's Day, celebrating Ireland's patron saint,
by praying for peace in the Emerald Isle.
   The pope appeared Sunday in St. Peter's Square to say the noon
prayer before a crowd of some 25,000 and recalled his 1979 visit to
the shrine to the Virgin Mary at Knock, Ireland.
   ``I invite you to pray so that in the land of St. Patrick there
is an end to the political and terrorist violence that for almost
20 years has been causing death and suffering both in the Catholic
and the Protestant community,'' the pope said.
   Since the resumption of sectarian violence in the British-ruled
province of Northern Ireland in 1969, a total of 2,628 people have
been killed, including 10 this year.
   The predominantly Roman Catholic Irish Republican Army is
fighting a guerrilla war to oust the British from the mainly
Protestant province and unite it with the Irish Republic to the
south.

   Prince Edward, the youngest son of Queen Elizabeth
II, reportedly has proposed to the daughter of a Belgian baroness _
a marriage that would require the prince to forfeit his chance to
become king.
   The People, a weekly London tabloid, said the 24-year-old prince
has proposed to Georgia May, 22, whose mother Catherine was born a
baroness in Belgium's Van den Branden de Reeth family.
   Edward would have to give up his rights as fifth in line to the
British throne if he marries Miss May, a Roman Catholic, the
newspaper said.
   Britain's 1701 Act of Settlement rules that only Protestants may
become British monarchs.
   The newspaper said the prince is awaiting the queen's permission
to be formally engaged.
   It quoted Miss May's former boyfriend, New Zealand yachtsman Ed
Danby, as saying she told him of the engagement plan in a telephone
call last week.
   The People said the prince met Miss May at a yachting regatta in
Cowes in southern England last August.

   Former ``CBS Morning News'' co-host
Phyllis George is taking on the small screen again with a one-hour
television special on babies.
   The former Miss America taped the show with prominent
pediatrician T. Berry Brazelton in front of about 100 people, many
of them her friends.
   George, who is married to former Gov. John Y. Brown Jr., left
CBS 2{ years ago under a barrage of criticism.
   After Tuesday's taping, George said she was pleased. ``I enjoy
television. I enjoy people,'' she said. ``It was good for me to get
back out and do something.''
   George said she has had several television offers since she left
CBS, but nothing has been quite right.
   Regarding her CBS experience, George said: ``It was a great
opportunity. It was a wonderful experience and I learned from it.
And that's all I'm going to say.''
   The baby special, ``Phyllis George Presents: Brazelton on
Babies,'' will be aired sometime in April.

   Actress Patricia Neal says she and Gary Cooper
wept after deciding to abort a child they conceived out of wedlock
and she continued to weep about the decision for another three
decades.
   ``For over 30 years, alone, in the night, I cried,'' she writes
in her autobiography, ``Patricia Neal: As I Am,'' excepts of which
were published in the April issue of Good Housekeeping.
   ``If I had only one thing to do over in my life, I would have
that baby,'' Miss Neal says.
   She and Cooper were attracted to each other during filming of
the movie, ``The Fountainhead,'' according to the 62-year-old
actress, who was 24 at the time. After filming ended, their love
affair began, she said. Cooper was living with his wife and
daughter at the time.
   ``Sharing a life with Gary was not complex,'' Miss Neal wrote.
``I knew I had no rights with him. I did not allow myself then to
consider the possibility of a permanent relationship. We were not
building a future together. We were seizing moments.''

   MOSCOW _ A newspaper Sunday questioned whether officials acted
properly by ordering a hijacked Aeroflot jet to land on Soviet
territory, pointing out that nine people were killed, 19 injured
and the plane burned to ashes.
   An 11-member family jazz band from the Siberian city of Irkutsk
seized the plane on Tuesday as it headed across the Ural Mountains,
Soviet reports said. They demanded to be flown to London.
   The Aeroflot crew duped the air pirates into believing they were
landing in Finland, but set down at a small airstrip near Leningrad.
   The hijackers, led by a matriarch in her 50s who had been
honored as a Hero-Mother of the Soviet Union, shot and killed a
stewardess when they realized they had been deceived and set off a
bomb after two hours of negotiations when a police assault team
stormed the plane. Five of the hijackers were killed, Soviet
reports said.
   Sunday's edition of Komsomolskaya Pravda, the Communist Party
youth newspaper, said the hijackers would have faced trial in
Britain if their demands to be flown there had been granted.
   ``We are entitled to a question: wasn't the price too costly for
the decision to detain the bandits on our territory?'' the
newspaper asked. ``An answer to this question lies with the
courts.''
   In calculating the cost of the incident, Komsomolskaya Pravda
said ``the aircraft burned to ashes, nine people, including five of
the criminals, were killed, and 19 people, including two on the
assault team, were wounded, and many will be crippled for life.''
   Previous reports said the hijackers detonated a bomb in the tail
section, setting fire to the plane, but the extent of the damage
had not been made clear.
   The report said the police assault team had plenty of time to
prepare before the Tupolev-154 landed, but it implied that the
preparations were inadequate.
   Among the 76 passengers on board, three were killed and 32
surgical operations were needed among the 19 wounded, the newspaper
said.
   It said one passenger's face was smashed with the butt of a
submachine gun in the melee that ensued on the ground when people
began jumping from doors and windows to flee the fire.
   A criminal investigating team has been assigned to the case, and
the official Tass news agency has reported that the surviving
hijackers are in custody.

<HEAD>Aspin Blames Air Force For MX Problems, Service Defends It's
Accuracy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM AHERN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rep. Les Aspin said Sunday the Air Force is
``part of the problem'' in the guidance system for the MX missile,
but the service says once again the weapon is reliable and accurate.
   The Wisconsin Democrat, chairman of the House Armed Services
Committee, said his panel's investigation of the 10-warhead weapon
shows there are still problems in producing the missile's inertial
measurement unit (IMU), or guidance system.
   Aspin's latest criticism of the MX was contained in a speech he
plans to deliver on the House floor Monday. A text of the speech
was released Sunday.
   Aspin has previously criticized Northrop, which is building the
IMUs at a Hawthorne, Calif., plant.
   ``Documents recently received by the House Armed Services
Committee show that while Northrop is undeniably having its
difficulties, the Air Force is part of the problem,'' according to
Aspin's speech.
   He said the documents, obtained from persons whom he did not
identify, show that the service considered accepting one IMU
without inspecting it, and also protested the use of a process
exempting small components from testing.
   An Air Force spokesman, Capt. Jay Defrank, said, ``we stand by
the IMU's reliability and accuracy. We've answered many of the
charges in his statement. There is nothing new there.''
   The MX is the centerpiece of President Reagan's nuclear
build-up. Reagan originally wanted to build 100 of the missiles and
put them in silos in Wyoming and Nebraska, but Congress limited the
total deployment to 50 because of fears about the weapon's
vulnerability to a Soviet strike.
   The Air Force now wants to build 50 more and put them aboard
trains. Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci has said he would like
to put all 100 of the weapons aboard trains.
   The MX weapons tested thus far have shown better-than-expected
accuracy, and the Air Force has consistently defended the ability
of the weapons deployed to hit their targets.
   Thus far, 34 MX weapons have been deployed, but only 22 have the
proper IMUs. The other dozen still lack guidance systems, Defrank
said.
   Northrop has promised to accelerate production of the guidance
systems, and all 50 of the MX weapons are scheduled to be deployed
by the end of 1988.
   One of the IMUs cited by Aspin failed after only 200 hours on
alert atop an MX missile, according to his speech. That would mean
that it fell far short of the service standard of 3,000 hours
allowed between failures, he said.
   But Defrank said the 3,000 hours is a standard mean time,
meaning it is an average. ``To criticize the Air Force for one IMU
failing is meaningless because it's the mean time between failures
that is important, and we're meeting that,'' he said.

<HEAD>Book Discloses Pentagon Bug, Other Activities</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Agents from the Pentagon planted listening
devices in an apartment of Panamanian military leader Manuel
Antonio Noriega several years ago, but the bugs failed to pick up
any meaningful data, according to book excerpts published Sunday.
   The Noriega bugging story is one detail in a widespread secret
effort by the Pentagon that included efforts to rescue U.S.
hostages, aid the Contras in Nicaragua and collect information on
potential enemies around the world, according to ``Secret Warriors:
Inside the Covert Military Operations of the Reagan Era,''
excerpted in U.S. News & World Report.
   The book by the magazine's senior editor, Steven Emerson, says
the Pentagon set up several secret units to carry out covert
paramilitary operations after the failure of the 1980 attempt under
President Carter to rescue American hostages in Iran.
   It says some of the operations were not disclosed to Congress or
to senior officials.
   The lack of coordination that led to the failed mission prompted
the new administration to establish Snow Bird, to be run by a group
of men in the Army's new Special Operations Division, says the book.
   Emerson said his findings are based on a yearlong investigation,
including information from hundreds of interviews and thousands of
documents obtained under the Freedom of Information Act.
   The Noriega microphones were planted in 1983 by a Defense
Department group called the Quick Reaction Team, which specialized
in electronic surveillance, according to Emerson.
   The agents initially tried to bug Noriega's luxurious residence,
but they were scared off by barking dogs and guards who opened
fire, the book says.
   ``Another attempt met with better results,'' the report said.
``QRT agents succeeded in planting a bug in a lavish Noriega
apartment. But six tapes, each 90 minutes long, failed to yield any
significant intelligence on Noriega.''
   The United States is now applying massive economic sanctions,
including a freeze on Panama's bank assets, in an effort to force
Noriega's resignation. The general also has been indicted on drug
charges by a federal grand jury.
   Other findings from Emerson's book include:
   _U.S. officials negotiated with the Palestine Liberation
Organization and Libyan intermediaries to obtain the release of
Americans being held in Lebanon, according to classified portions
of private notebooks of fired Marine Lt. Col. Oliver North, a
National Security Council aide who was a central figure in the
Iran-Contra affair.
   One plan, which later collapsed, called for $10 million in
covert payments to Sheik Fadlallah, the leader of the Hezbollah
organization holding the hostages and Hussein Massawi, the leader
of the Islamic Amal militia. At U.S. request, the PLO actually
transferred some money to Fadlallah to get the hostages out, but
nothing happened.
   _In 1985, U.S. intelligence identified the location of the house
where five of the six American hostages were being held in Lebanon.
The site was reconstructed by U.S. intelligence agents as part of a
portable mini-model used by U.S. officials to prepare a rescue
operation. A detailed military rescue mission was planned, but it
was scrapped when the Iran-Contra affair began to unfold.
   _NSC sources said the man behind the kidnapping of the hostages
was a Shiite named Immad Mughniye. However, North said that
Mughniye's wife, whose relative was being held in a Kuwaiti prison
for terrorism, was running the show. ``Ollie said Mughniye wasn't
going to get any sex until his (wife's relative) was released,''
says one excerpt from the book.
   _Pentagon agents who discovered the Soviets had ordered a fleet
of Opel automobiles in 1983 entered the manufacturing plant at
night, took apart a car and embedded a transmitter in the frame.
Agents were then able to trail the car without being seen. ``The
mission was so successful that a number of Soviet agents were
identified and several Russian codes were broken.''

   Rep. Richard Gephardt's trademark Boy Scout
smile froze as he peeked from behind the curtains at the Sunrise
Musical Theatre.
   Stretching out beyond the stage he was about to take was a sea
of empty seats _ no more than 400 people were at the 4,200-seat
theatre. He could see some people walking out of the Florida
Community Association meeting, following the end of the featured
speech by former President Gerald Ford.
   Gephardt shook his head slowly, straightened himself, then
strode out to give his campaign speech.
   It was a foreboding beginning to the final, three-day push to
Super Tuesday, the 20-state set of primaries and caucuses that
could have dramatically boosted the presidential ambitions of the
Missouri congressman.
   Instead, on Wednesday morning Gephardt awoke to newspaper
headlines that called him the day's big Democratic loser.
   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis won the big prizes of Texas
and Florida and five other states; civil rights leader Jesse
Jackson won five states and the biggest share of the popular vote,
and Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore Jr., the candidate Gephardt's
campaign officials hoped to see eliminated Tuesday, was stronger
than ever after winning six states.
   Gephardt won only one state _ Missouri _ and finished fourth in
13. He was left with one last chance _ the March 26 Michigan
caucuses _ to keep his campaign alive.
   Gephardt arrived here three days before Super Tuesday from
Louisiana, where his campaign's polls had said he was running
neck-and-neck with Jackson for the lead. Polls in Oklahoma and
Arkansas also were encouraging, and Texas seemed volatile enough to
take from Dukakis with Gephardt's theme of correcting the trade
imbalance and spurring domestic oil production with an oil-import
fee.
   In South Florida, even though Gephardt had the active support of
the popular 87-year-old Rep. Claude Pepper, the condominium
community retirees were solidly for Dukakis. After the musical
theatre appearance, Gephardt and Pepper campaigned at condominium
complex. Fewer than 75 people turned out.
   Next was the annual Strawberry Festival in Plant City. It was
raining as Gephardt walked through the carnival-style grounds, and
he attracted little attention. Two days later, Dukakis would arrive
to hundreds of supporters, 500 Dukakis signs along the route and a
plane flying overhead with a Dukakis streamer.
   In Tallahassee, Gephardt was joined by media consultant Robert
Shrum, given credit for helping Gephardt develop the populist theme
that played so well in Iowa. Arriving in Brownsville, Texas, late
Saturday, Shrum was asked if his rare travel with the campaign was
a sign of trouble.
   ``No, no, I just like to get out in the field sometimes,'' said
Shrum, smiling around his big cigar.
   Gephardt began Sunday with a taping of ``Meet the Press.'' The
first questions were about his ``flip-flop'' on abortion.
Meanwhile, both Gore and Dukakis were attacking Gephardt for
changing positions on the issues. Dukakis was running a commercial
depicting a man in a business suit doing back flips, with a
voice-over about Gephardt's issue switches.
   Later, as Gephardt's motorcade with the long black limousine
drove into the border city of Texarkana, oncoming cars pulled over
to the side of the road.
   A local Gephardt supporter explained: ``They see the black car
and they think it's a funeral procession. It's tradition that you
pull off the road for a funeral.''
   Joe Trippi, Gephardt's deputy campaign manager, the campaign's
``spin'' specialist, was trying to put the best light on the
upcoming Super Tuesday voting. On Sunday, the spin was that even if
Gore and Gephardt shared third place, it would be a victory for
Gephardt because his strength would be shown as comparable to
Gore's in the Tennessee senator's Southern stronghold.
   Gephardt's showing, as it turned out, wasn't up to the spin.
   That night in Dallas, Gephardt invited the traveling press to
join him at Casa Dominguez, where he had the Mexican special
combination dinner and a Budweiser beer, brewed in his hometown of
St. Louis. Gephardt talked about his beloved St. Louis Cardinals
baseball team.
   Someone asked: ``Why didn't you stop in St. Petersburg and take
batting practice with the Cardinals?'' Gephardt smiled ruefully,
doubtless thinking of rival Dukakis' much-publicized visit to Red
Sox camp in Winter Haven, where the governor donned a Boston
uniform and took some swings in the batting cage.
   ``That was a good picture, wasn't it?'' Gephardt said.
   On Monday, Gephardt headed to San Antonio, where Dukakis had
drawn 1,500 people a day earlier, addressing Hispanic crowds in
fluent Spanish. No more than 400, many of them tourists, were there
as Gephardt spoke in front of The Alamo, one day after the 152nd
anniversary of the fall of the badly outmanned Texan mission to the
Mexican army.
   Gephardt concluded his Texas campaign Monday evening with a
visit to the Johnson Space Center, where he detailed his
Kennedyesque plan to revitalize the U.S. space program. But media
questions concentrated on how he would do Tuesday.
   Asked whether any candidate could finish worse than third
Tuesday and survive, Gephardt replied: ``I don't know ... I know
I'm going to keep fighting to get my message out.''
   As the campaign headed to Miami, where its ill-fated Super
Tuesday campaigning would conclude, Trippi was talking spin again.
He was talking about Michigan.

   Women now head nearly 300 of the accredited
colleges and universities in the United States, the American
Council on Education said Sunday.
   The number of women college presidents doubled from 148 in 1975
to 296 in 1987, with the most rapid growth at public institutions,
said the council's Office of Women in Higher Education.
   But the fastest spurt was in the late 1970s and early 1980s, it
said. There was a net increase of only 10 women presidents between
1984 and 1987.
   There are more than 3,400 two- and four-year colleges in the
United States; 2,880 are accredited.
   Eighty-six of the women presidents, or 29 percent, are nuns
heading religious institutions. Forty, or 14 percent, are
minorities, including 22 black, 13 Hispanic, four American Indian
and one Asian-American women.
   Since 1984, the office said, the number of women heading
four-year public institutions has increased 22 percent, from 32 to
39.
   The number heading four-year private colleges and universities
grew by 16 percent, from 134 to 156.
   Women also held the presidencies at 73 two-year public colleges
(up from 72 in 1984) and 28 two-year private institutions (down
from 48).
   Donna Shavlik, director of the Office of Women in Higher
Education, said colleges need to search harder and address
inequities in hiring and promoting women. ``What's needed is
personal and institutional commitment and determination to achieve
the goal,'' she said.

<HEAD>Coping With Power Failures, Competing With Vanna White: Dole
Fights On</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONALD M. ROTHBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When a campaign starts to slide, as Bob Dole's
surely has, everything goes wrong, even the little things. The
candidate finds himself struggling to overcome power failures and
competing for attention against Vanna White.
   The signs are everywhere that George Bush has all but clinched
the Republican presidential nomination. He won a smashing victory
on Super Tuesday and appeared poised to keep rolling on Tuesday
when Illinois holds its primary.
   Yet, despite the battering he has taken from Bush in recent
contests, Dole clearly sees a loser when he looks at the vice
president.
   ``Sooner or later,'' he said Sunday on the CBS show ``Face the
Nation,'' ``the voters in one of these states are going to say,
wait a minute, we're about to nominate a loser.''
   But Dole's view wasn't shared by many Republican voters in the
South and doesn't appear likely to find much support in Illinois.
   In fact, if anyone looked like a loser, it was the senator from
Kansas.
   After Super Tuesday, Dole needed a way to turn the race around.
Bush came out of the South with a big lead in delegates _ 705 to
165 _ but the next battleground was the Midwest and Dole had
trounced Bush in Iowa, Minnesota and South Dakota.
   Dole had his hands full as he started his Illinois campaign,
still stunned by the magnitude of his loss on Super Tuesday when
Bush took all 16 primaries.
   Suddenly word got out that the campaign was laying off most of
its paid staff and was pulling all its commercials off the air in
Illinois. Rumors spread swiftly that Dole was going to throw in the
towel and concede the nomination to Bush.
   That possibility clearly had been discussed and rejected.
   Dole said people were laid off because ``a campaign is not a
jobs program'' and after Super Tuesday, paid staff was not needed
in a large number of states. While that argument made some sense,
the timing of the layoffs, right after a big loss, left the
unmistakable impression the campaign was folding.
   The announcement on the television commercials was a case of
different people in the same campaign giving out conflicting
versions of what was happening.
   William Brock, the campaign manager, finally said on Friday that
all the commercials had not been pulled. He said many had been
dropped in favor of a decision to buy 30 minutes of time for a
major Dole effort to win voter support.
   Brock's version, as it turned out, was correct. Some 30-second
Dole commercials are running in Illinois. But the former secretary
of labor was not around to provide an authoritative version when
the word first got out. He was attending ceremonies marking the
anniversary of the founding of the Labor department.
   The 30-minute Dole program, originating from Knox College in
Galesburg, site of one of the Lincoln-Douglas debates, turned out
to be a showcase of campaign disarray.
   Eight hours before the program was to air, Dole advisers were
unable to say exactly what it would contain. Aides were scrambling
to fill the 30 minutes. Nearly half of it was filled by a Dole
biography filmed months ago for showing at campaign events.
   The message the candidate delivered was a restatement of
campaign rhetoric, his contention that Bush was not discussing the
issues.
   ``The issues are more important than the odds,'' he said,
portraying himself as the one who was responsible for getting
President Reagan's program through Congress.
   It was a $100,000 gamble _ and was all the riskier due to the
decision to go live instead of taping the program in advance. In
the middle of the program, there was an unexplained power failure
that resulted in loss of the picture for several minutes. The sound
was not interrupted.
   How many voters saw the program was questionable. It was
competing against ``Wheel of Fortune,'' the popular game show in
which Vanna White has become a celebrity for her role of turning
around the letters on word puzzles.
   While Dole was fighting for attention in one campus building,
Bush was addressing a cheering crowd of more than 1,000 Republicans
in the college gymnasium about 200 yards away.
   Tied as tightly as ever to Reagan, Bush condiently predicted,
``We are going to win on Tuesday because we have the people with
us.''
   In the battle for Republican primary votes, Bush is looking and
sounding very much like a winner.

<HEAD>Restaurant To Give Homeless Alternative To Soup Line</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARC RICE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Inside an old brick building that once was a
drive-in liquor store, a minister and a group of volunteers are
putting the finishing touches on a cafe for people who rarely get
to enjoy restaurant treatment.
   The cafe will be for the homeless, who have some of their basic
needs met by the city's shelters and soup kitchens but are unable
to enjoy the more relaxed and personal atmosphere of a restaurant,
said the Rev. A.B. Short.
   ``I'm thankful for the feeding programs; they (the homeless)
couldn't survive without them,'' said Short, who has been involved
in homeless aid programs since moving to Atlanta in 1980.
   ``But if you feed 500 people in two hours, you can't give much
personal attention,'' he said.
   Short said the restaurant will be relatively small, serving
about 30 at a time, and will emphasize a friendly atmosphere over
merely providing food to the homeless.
   ``People have a need for food, but we hope the interaction and
relationships will be our primary product,'' he said.
   The restaurant will feature counter service as well as tables.
The kitchen will be entirely visible from the dining area so
patrons can talk to the cooks, dishwashers and other volunteer
staffers, Short said.
   One of the main differences from the standard shelter kitchen
will be that the homeless will be able to choose items from a menu,
instead of just having plates of food handed to them.
   There will be no charge for the food, but a voucher system of
tickets distributed by area shelters may be used, Short said.
   A legal aid service as well as alcohol and drug abuse counseling
also will be available on the premises, Short added.
   There are an estimated 7,000-10,000 homeless in the Atlanta area.
   Renovation work began in November with the help of $30,000 in
federal and state grants. Several individuals and businesses have
contributed materials or funds, and some of the work has been done
by volunteers, including members of the homeless community.
   ``The idea seems so unique it has sparked a lot of people's
interest,'' Short said, adding that he hopes the restaurant will be
ready to open by the end of the month.
   Once it is open, much of the food will be provided by agencies
that already help the homeless. Short said he also will rely on
donations to keep the restaurant going.
   At first, the restaurant will serve for two hours beginning at
noon. Short said he hopes he can add a breakfast or dinner period
later.
   Short, 43, a native of Mississippi, said the idea for the
restaurant grew from his involvement with the homeless, which
started when he organized a shelter at Oakhurst Baptist Church in
suburban Decatur, where he is a member.
   He said his church, which includes many social activists,
responded enthusiastically to the shelter project. But he and his
wife, who is on the faculty of Emory University, wanted to go a
step further.
   ``We decided that if we were really serious about the homeless
issues, what we might ought to be doing is having homeless people
live with us,'' he said.
   They have had homeless people living with them since 1982, and
some of them now are working on the restaurant, located near the
Martin Luther King Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change.
   Short said he does not envision facilities such as the
restaurant replacing traditional shelters or kitchens, but he would
like to see it become an established part of the homeless aid
network.
   ``It's just another piece of the very important work people are
already involved in,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   A senior Palestine Liberation Organization
official Sunday denied that the guerrilla group called on West Bank
deputies to resign from Jordan's Parliament.
   Such a call was made in a leaflet circulated in the
Israeli-occupied territory and prompted expressions of concern from
Jordanian Prime Minister Zaid Rifai.
   But the senior PLO official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, disassociated the organization from the contents of the
leaflet, saying it was an adulterated version.
   The official said the leaflet was part of ``a plot meant to harm
our relationship with the Jordanian government.''
   In a leaflet issued Thursday and circulated in the occupied
areas, underground Palestinian leaders said Arabs should take
revenge ``on collaborators and the lackeys of the Jordanian
regime.'' It purported to be signed by the PLO.
   It also called on West Bank deputies in Jordan's Parliament to
resign and ``return to our people, otherwise they will have no
place in our land.''
   Delegates of the lower house of Parliament, half of whose 60
members are from the West Bank, refused to comment on the call,
saying ``it is untrue and fabricated.''
   State-run radio said Rifai denounced the resignation call,
saying ``it harms the unity of the two peoples in the two banks ..
. and only serves the enemy objectives.''
   It said the PLO provided Rifai with ``the real text of the
statement, which does not include such a suspicious call.''
   Israel seized the West Bank from Jordan in the 1967 Middle East
war but deputies from the West Bank continue to sit in the
Jordanian Parliament.

<HEAD>Jackson, Fresh From South Carolina Win, Seeks To Surge Past Simon
In Illinois</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jesse Jackson said Sunday that winning in his
native South Carolina may give him the momentum in his adopted home
state to upset Illinois Sen. Paul Simon in the primary here on
Tuesday.
   Jackson won 54 percent of the vote Saturday in South Carolina's
Democratic caucuses and 23 of 44 delegates to the national
convention.
   Upon his return to Illinois, Jackson was greeted with the
results of a Chicago Tribune poll indicating he was in a virtual
dead heat with Simon, the state's other favorite son.
   Simon has ``the inside track'' and Massachusetts Gov. Michael
Dukakis has the money, Jackson said in a campaign stop at St.
Sylvester's, a Roman Catholic church in Chicago's Hispanic Humboldt
Park neighborhood.
   ``So here I am again, the underdog with the big bite,'' he said.
   The latest Associated Press count shows Jackson now has 423
delegates to 35 for Simon, who sat out South Carolina as well as
last week's 20-state Super Tuesday contest.
   Jackson and Simon are battling for the 113 state Democratic
delegates to be elected Tuesday. Simon, who hails from Southern
Illinois, has full delegate slates in all 22 congressional
districts. Jackson has slates _ although not all are full _ in all
but one of the districts.
   ``I certainly hope to win the popular vote and the delegate vote
in Illinois,'' Jackson said. ``I've been a builder in this state
for 25 years and I hope the people with whom I stood will stand
with me on Tuesday.
   ``We will get support all over the state,'' he added.
   To ensure statewide support, Jackson planned a rally Sunday
night in East St. Louis, the state's other major black population
center. On Monday he planned to swing south to Carbondale and
travel through the fertile Illinois farmland with stops in
Springfield and Bloomington and finally Chicago, where he owns a
home.
   Jackson was buoyed by the Tribune poll results.
   ``That means in the last lap of the race, whoever has the most
kick, whoever has the most strength in the last lap down the
stretch will win,'' he said.
   Asked about the possibility of throwing his support to
Democratic front-runner Dukakis, Jackson said he was too busy
running and winning to give it a thought.
   ``The message is winning _ end economic violence against the
farmers and workers, stop the flow of drugs into our country,''
Jackson said.
   Jackson is being asked these days about his chances against
Republican George Bush in the general election, if they were their
respective parties' nominees.
   ``He certainly has a lot of baggage,'' Jackson said of the vice
president on NBC's ``Meet the Press.''
   ``George Bush was supposed to be over the commission on the drug
situation, yet drugs are coming into this country at a rate that
threatens our national security. ... To that continuous flow of
drugs, Mrs. Reagan says no and George Bush says nothing.''

   Some of the few Vienna Jews who survived
Hitler's death grip on Austria gathered Sunday at a synagogue and
at a former Gestapo headquarters, remembering the pain of the past
and the shadow it has cast on the present.
   Prayers and tears mingled inside the city's oldest synagogue,
where more than a thousand Jews marked the 50th anniversary of the
Anschluss, Austria's annexation by Nazi Germany.
   ``No one can feel our pain, no one can feel our suffering,''
Rabbi Chaim Eisenberg told the congregation.
   The meeting was the emotional climax of four days of solemn
remembrances of the annexation. Political and cultural leaders
engaged in an unprecedented public probing of their nation's role
as victim and perpetrator of Nazi terror and continued to discuss
the problem of President Kurt Waldheim.
   For many Vienna Jews, Waldheim's concealment of his German army
service in the Balkans symbolizes the suppression of the Nazi past
in Austria.
   Paul Grosz, leader of the Jewish community, drew loud applause
at another meeting at the former Vienna headquarters of the Nazi
police when he expressed hope that Jewish suffering under the Nazis
would be remembered.
   ``We can only hope that the high degree of consciousness for
these events in recent days will not end next week,'' said Grosz.
   There were 200,000 Jews in Vienna on March 1938, when Adolf
Hitler's troops swept into his native Austria. Today, just 6,000
Jews remain, a mix of Holocaust survivors and younger Jews from the
Soviet bloc and Israel.
   They have been exposed to a new wave of anti-Semitism in the
past two years that has surfaced with the controversy over the
Waldheim's World War II record.
   Waldheim concealed his role as a German army lieutenant in the
Balkans until it was disclosed in the media in March 1986. He has
rejected calls for his resignation, saying he will stay in office
until his term expires in 1992.
   A commission of historians appointed by the Austrian government
to investigate Waldheim said he was in a position to know about
Nazi atrocities and did nothing to stop them.
   Grosz attacked Waldheim backers who argue the president must
stay in office to prevent a backlash against Jews if he is forced
to resign. He said the Jews could defend themselves.
   By contrast, Grosz welcomed Socialist Chancellor Franz Vranitzky
to the meeting as ``our good friend.''
   Vranitzky, who is popular with Vienna's Jews, also warned
against losing sight of the Nazi past.
   ``In the last few days ... we all tried to make the things that
happened seem anonymous in some way, as if we were afraid to make
it too personal, too direct,'' Vranitzky said.
   ``You have to call things by their name,'' he said. ``It was not
an anonymous horror that descended on a people ... and then
disappeared.''
   Referring to the former Gestapo headquarters, he noted, ``Let
the desperate screams that sounded from the cellars of this site,
which we can no longer hear, be a reminder.''
   Half a mile away, at Vienna's Opera House, former Socialist
Chancellor Bruno Kreisky reiterated his call for Waldheim to
resign, while Roman Catholic Cardinal Franz Koenig looked at the
controversial role of the church in the Nazi era.
   ``The church did not do enough to protect (believers) against
the temptations of the Nazi regime,'' Koenig said.
   On Friday night, neo-Nazis booed a Vienna premiere of ``The
Deputy,'' West German Rolf Hochhuth's 1960s play on the church's
World War II role.
   The only other overt neo-Nazi action came in Linz, the city of
Hitler's youth, where a recording of Hitler's 1938 speech in the
town blared from a hotel just after a monument to Nazi victims was
unveiled Saturday. Police found no trace of the perpetrators.

   The strike at the Indian Head Mine is in its
fifth month, but neither management nor union miners are showing
any sign of backing down in their dispute over job security.
   The miners say they're still united behind the walkout, which
began Nov. 1, while management claims the job is getting done
safely, on time and at lower cost.
   ``It is a matter of principle. It isn't a matter of money
anymore,'' said Dan Neurohr, president of United Mine Workers of
America Local 8880.
   The union represents 44 striking miners and wants written
assurances its members will be hired at other North American Coal
Corp. mines when work at Indian Head ends in 1992. The company
refuses such a guarantee, arguing it would be unfair to its 350
non-union miners in North Dakota.
   Neurohr calls North American's tactics ``union-busting.''
   But North American won't budge from its stance, even for wage
concessions, said company spokesman August Keller.
   ``It's like the union asking us to give them a trip to the moon.
It's just something we can't do,'' he said.
   Each side accuses the other of committing various acts of
vandalism, ranging from littering roads with nails to knocking out
windows.
   Talks broke down in early February, and no new negotiations are
scheduled.
   North American negotiators offered a wage package worth an
average of $18 an hour and more fringe benefits, Keller said.
   As both sides maintain their stances in the strike, North
American prepared to hire 10 temporary workers who haven't worked
at other company mines, the first such move since the strike
started.
   Neurohr said he wasn't nervous about keeping his striking miners
on the picket lines as the coal company maneuvered to hire
replacements to take their jobs.
   The replacements, who are slated to go to work later this month,
have been told they will lose their jobs if the strike is settled,
Keller said.
   The company has mailed letters inviting the disgruntled workers
back, but none has accepted the offer, Neurohr said.
   The striking miners planned ahead and saved money to ride out
the economic storm of being idled from their $40,000-a-year jobs,
Neurohr said. The workers, with $200 checks each week from the
union's strike fund, are paying their bills, he said.
   But one miner on the picket line said some strikers have been
unable to make their house payments. More will search out at least
part-time jobs when the weather warms, he said.
   Meanwhile, the company said it was ``doing fine.''
   ``We are making our coal deliveries. We are meeting the demand.
... The cost of production on a per-ton basis is lower than anytime
in the last year,'' Keller said.

<TEXT>
   An unemployed immigrant and his six
children were forced to rely on charity despite winning a $3.45
million malpractice suit because attorneys and a hospital caring
for his comatose wife split the award.
   Those involved say the treatment of Linval Ayton's family is
entirely legal under Florida law, which does not recognize his
20-year common-law marriage, and does not allow the children to
benefit unless their mother dies.
   ``We were sympathetic. All the judges were sympathetic,'' said
J.B. Spence, the high-powered personal injury attorney who handled
much of the case. ``But everyone was locked in a set of legal
handcuffs,'' he added. ``The culprit here is the law.''
   The tragedy for Ayton, 43, an illiterate Jamaican immigrant,
began when his longtime common-law wife Maudeline Ford, then 42,
entered the Broward Medical Center for what should have been a
routine childbirth in January 1985.
   Ms. Ford ran a small store and had been the only support of the
family after Ayton ruptured a disk and lost his job as a school
janitor.
   But something went wrong during a Caesarean section to deliver
the baby, and Ms. Ford's heart stopped. In the time it took to get
her heart started again, Ms. Ford's brain suffered damage that has
left her comatose.
   The baby was born in excellent condition.
   Ayton's sister-in-law eventually called attorney Phillip
Auerbach after seeing his ad on television, and Auerbach in turn
brought in Spence.
   There is dispute over whether the attorneys told Ayton he and
his children would be provided for under a possible settlement.
   But whatever Ayton was told, quirks in Florida law deprived the
family of any benefits from the $3.45 million eventually awarded
after 30 months and nine volumes of litigation.
   One quirk was that state law does not recognize common-law
marriages, even though Ayton and Ms. Ford had been together almost
20 years. That means he had no legal right to benefit from loss of
her companionship.
   The six children, ranging in age from 3 to 19, could have
received money except for another twist _ state law recognizes
their loss of companionship only when the mother dies. And modern
technology is still keeping her alive in the North Miami Medical
Center, at the cost of $1,000 a day.
   Ayton and the children wound up relying on the sister-in-law,
who would sometimes drop off a chicken or a loaf of bread, and
charity.
   ``I went to the Red Cross and the Salvation Army and begged for
food,'' Ayton said. ``Mostly canned food, vegetables and corn. We
were living by the mercy of God.''
   The sympathetic judge in the case, Circuit Judge James Reasbeck,
eventually tried to give the family $104,000. But Probate Judge
Raymond Hare forced Ayton to pay it back a few months later.
   ``There was no legal basis for him to have it,'' said Hare. ``He
wasn't her legal spouse.''
   The attorneys say their 45 percent fee, plus thousands of
dollars in expenses, were legitimate and legal. Spence said the
case was very difficult, and called winning it ``a home run.''
   Ms. Ford won a total of $1.8 million, but that money was put
into a trust fund to pay for her medical expenses. Attorneys say
the hospital bills will be paid out of the interest, and the
children will eventually inherit the principle.
   But the fund's administrator, Fred Koerner, assistant vice
president of Barnett Banks, disputes that.
   He said Ms. Ford's care now costs $380,000 a year, and has used
up almost half of the principle.
   ``At the current rate, we estimate the money will last three
years or less,'' said Koerner.
   Ayton's family was finally saved from destitution eight months
ago when the court agreed to parcel $2,500 a month out of a trust
fund on behalf of the five minor children. The money keeps the
children in food and decent clothes, and has allowed them to return
to regular classes.
   Ayton, as their legal guardian, could petition the court to pull
the plug on his comatose wife, whom he visits almost daily. That
would allow the children to have what remains of the trust fund.
   But he refuses.
   ``We have been poor all of our lives,'' said Ayton. ``I can do
without any of this money. Because to me, this money comes along
like a kind of blood money.''

<HEAD>Wildcat Strike At Rome Airport Cancels And Delays Flights</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Scores of flights were canceled or delayed at Rome's
main airport Sunday after ground workers staged a wildcat strike
because they were unhappy with a tentative accord reached in a
six-month labor dispute.
   The strike at Leonardo da Vinci airport involved about 90
percent of the check-in counter personnel and baggage handlers. It
was called by autonomous groups in defiance of Italy's major labor
federations.
   Alitalia canceled 30 flights scheduled from 1 p.m. to 8 p.m.
Foreign carrier flights took off but only after delays ranging from
15 minutes to two hours. Some travelers were forced to lug baggage
onto the tarmac to jet cargo holds.
   On Saturday, Transport Minister Calogero Mannino and federation
leaders for airport ground workers announced a tentative accord in
the dispute, which has been punctuated by day-long strikes a few
times a month since September.
   The tentative accord, which would be applied retroactively from
January, calls for a monthly raise of about $190 over three years
and gradually shortening the work week from 40{ hours to 37{ hours.
   A baggage handler's current maximum regular salary is about
$1,215 a month.
   Airport sources said the workers who struck Sunday want the
salary increases granted over a shorter period.
   Travelers since fall have also suffered through pilot and
traffic controllers' strikes as well as repeated walkouts by
railway workers in still unresolved disputes.
   Railway workers in Palermo, Sicily, and Reggio di Calabria in
southern Italy, called a three hour strike for Sunday night.

<HEAD>Angola Gives U.S. Timetable For Cuban Withdrawal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LUANDA, Angola (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Angola and Cuba have presented the United
States with a proposal for moving 40,000 Cuban soldiers out of the
African nation, the Angolan foreign ministry said Sunday.
   A ministry statement said the proposal includes a specific
timetable for a full withdrawal of Cuban troops. It said the
proposal was handed to a U.S. State Department official Saturday
after talks here between U.S., Angolan and Cuban officials.
   The proposals for a Cuban withdrawal are conditional on South
Africa withdrawing its troops from Angola and a halt to U.S. and
South African aid to the Angolan rebel movement, the Angolan
foreign ministry said.
   It also includes a proposal for peace in neighboring South-West
Africa, also known as Namibia, where the South-West African
People's Organization has been fighting South African rule since
1966.
   In South Africa, meanwhile, The Sunday Times quoted unidentified
Western diplomats as saying South Africa and the Angolan government
have met in preliminary talks aimed at peace in Angola.
   Sources in Luanda, however, told The Associated Press they had
no knowledge of meetings between Angolan and South African
officials. The sources asked not to be identified.
   According to Cuban estimates, about 40,000 Cuban soldiers are in
Angola to aid the Marxist government in its 13-year war against
local guerrillas, primarily the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola.
   The Cuban withdrawal plan specifically did not mention
participation in negotiations by the Angolan rebel movement and its
leader, Jonas Savimbi. There have been recent suggestions from
Angolan officials that talks with group members other than Savimbi
might be possible.
   The South Africans have insisted that the rebel group be part of
negotiations and a postwar government.
   Government-run South African television reported Sunday night
that Savimbi had been in Cape Town the previous day. The broadcast
quoted him as saying he had been ``meeting with his allies''
because ``something was in the air.''
   Savimbi was quoted as saying several African countries,
including Gabon, the Ivory Coast and Keyna, were expressing open
support for a negotiated settlement to the Angolan conflict and
there was increasing pressure on the Luanda government to talk to
his group.
   The Soviet Union and other East bloc countries also supply
Angola with military aid and advisers. The United States supplies
the rebel group with arms.
   After talks in Luanda in January, U.S. Assistant Secretary of
State Chester Crocker said Cuba had declared its willingness in
principle to pull its troops out of Angola. A State Department
group arrived in Angola Wednesday to explore the possibility of
further talks on a Cuban withdrawal.

   Hundreds of Armenians gathered Sunday at a
cemetery to demand justice from the Kremlin in a territorial
dispute between Armenia and Azerbaijan and to condemn the Soviet
press for being ``criminally silent.''
   The fight for control of the Nagorno-Karabakh region in
Azerbaijan has brought ethnic tensions to the surface in both
southern republics. The Armenian capital of Yerevan last month was
the scene of a weeklong demonstration involving hundreds of
thousands, and an ethnic riot in the Azerbaijani city of Sumgait
killed at least 32.
   Sunday's five-hour demonstration outside a 19th century Armenian
church at the Vagankovskoye Cemetery swelled to as many as 1,000
participants and curious onlookers. It was the second mass
gathering in less than a week by Moscow's Armenian community.
   Armenians hoisted banners declaring ``Karabakh was and will be
Armenian'' and ``Shame to the Proponents of Genocide.''
   A cluster of Armenian officials and activists, some of whom had
traveled to Moscow from the republic to press the annexation cause,
vied for a chance to address the crowd.
   Armenian film director Boris Baratov told the crowd that the
kind of Moslem fanaticism he believes was the catalyst for the
Sumgait rioting cannot be tolerated in the Soviet Union.
   ``If this happened to the Armenians yesterday, it can happen to
any nationality tomorrow,'' he shouted. The Armenians burst into
applause and shouts of approval.
   Baratov said he was a member of a committee of 600 Armenians
from all regions and professions that has come together to keep the
public informed and to press government bodies to resolve the
dispute over Nagorno-Karabakh, a mountainous region, smaller than
Delaware, located within the republic of Azerbaijan.
   More than three quarters of the population of the region, which
was part of Armenia until 1923, is Armenian.
   ``The silence in the press over what happened in Sumgait drew me
into this committee,'' said Baratov, who lives in Moscow. ``Our
press has been criminally silent.''
   The official Tass news agency issued a brief report on the
Sumgait rioting which was published by the major national
newspapers. But reference to the issue behind the rioting _ the
annexation question _ has been made only in small-circulation
newspapers in Armenia.
   Soviet television and the government newspaper Izvestia
initially branded the annexation drive an ``extremist action,''
which angered many Armenians who consider themselves moderates and
loyal Soviets.
   Later in the rally, another member of the committee, Moscow
lawyer Garik Agabekov, urged the crowd to maintain order if they
wanted to succeed in getting the government's support.
   Agabekov credited Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reforms
for allowing the long-simmering dispute over the Nagorno-Karabakh
region to be discussed and decided openly, but challenged the
Kremlin to abide by its slogans and let the region's people decide
their fate.
   Communist Party and government officials in Nagorno-Karabakh
voted in early February for annexation to Armenia, but the party's
national Central Committee rejected the appeal in mid-February.
   The rejection touched off mass protests in Nagorno-Karabakh's
central city, Stepanakert. Unrest spread to Yerevan in late
February when Armenians learned that Soviet troops had moved into
the disputed region to quell the protests.
   The Yerevan demonstrations subsided after Gorbachev appealed for
calm and promised a top-level review of the annexation appeal.
   The ethnic rioting on Feb. 28 in Sumgait was reportedly sparked
by Moslem extremists angered over the Armenian claims to
Nagorno-Karabakh.
   Most Armenians are Christian, while the Azeri population of
Azerbaijan is predominantly Moslem.

<HEAD>Court Ruling Paves Way for Wide Variety of Phone Services</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The day is near when your home telephone line
will be an electronic pipeline to a wide variety of information
services.
   By punching numbers on your phone pad, you will be able to
select the programs you want to watch on cable television, leave
messages for callers when you're not home and, if you have a
computer, tap into a host of databases by dialing just one number.
   The seven regional Bell phone companies went to work quickly to
move their plans off the drawing boards when they got a green light
last week from a federal judge allowing them to offer these
services to consumers.
   Most of the companies say they will begin market trials of some
of the services this year and that some services may become
commercially available in certain areas by year's end, though
nationwide offering is probably several years away.
   Voice mail, which acts like a sophisticated answering machine,
is expected to have the most widespread consumer appeal and will be
among the first of the services to hit the commercial market in
most areas.
   This service would provide a telephone user with a ``voice mail
box'' in which callers could leave messages when the user's line is
busy or is not answered. The user could retrieve messages at his or
her convenience.
   ``It's like a mail box, except the letter is by voice,'' said
Linda Laskowski, vice president of the information provider market
for US West, one of the seven regional Bell companies. ``You can
get and receive information but you don't have to be there to do
it. What it really stops is telephone tag.''
   Users would not have to buy any hardware, like an answering
machine. With the services, all they would have to do is punch
instructions to the phone company on their phone pad.
   Many businesses have this service in their internal phone
systems now, but such private phone systems are not an option for
most households or small businesses because of the cost.
   The Bell companies say they haven't decided how customers will
be charged for voice mail, but Laskowski said, ``It will have to be
low enough for the average consumer to want to use it.''
   Heidi Harris, director of voice mail for Pacific Bell, suggested
that ``to send a single message might be within the range of a
postage stamp.''
   A related service is called voice messaging, which allows
callers to dial a number and reach dozens of recorded messages.
Once they've dialed in, a message would tell the callers to punch a
certain key to hear the weather report, for example, another key
for a stock report and another for sports scores. Another
application of this service would allow organizations to leave
messages for members.
   Both voice mail and messaging by the Bell companies will compete
with answering machines and could shut down many small businesses
that provide live telephone answering services, said Joseph Laseau,
executive vice president of the Association of Telemessaging
Services International Inc.
   ``We see these small businesses losing 10 to 15 percent of their
customers, and that could put them out of business,'' he said.
   The Bell companies also are moving to begin market trials on
services that will make it easier for computer users to send
information electronically to other computers and to dial into
information databases.
   Under U.S. District Judge Harold Greene's order, the companies
can transmit such information services but cannot generate the
information itself. They will be allowed to function as
``gateways,'' providing users with a menu of services they can
reach.
   Greene is the judge who presides over the breakup of American
Telephone & Telegraph Co., which was stripped of its local Bell
operating companies four years ago. That led to the formation of
the seven regional Bell companies.
   Dozens of computer information services exist now, but users
must dial each separately to gain entry. The Bell companies will
now be allowed to provide a single phone number these users can
dial to reach many databanks.
   Companies also will be allowed to enable cable television
subscribers to use the touch pad on their phone to tell the cable
operator what channel they want to watch.
   Under such a system, subscribers could choose from among
programs on several channels and pay for what they watch, instead
of subscribing to all the programs on all the channels.
   The companies will have to get regulatory approvals for any of
the services they offer, and in market trials they will be trying
to determine what is easiest for consumers to use.
   They also will be trying to develop designs that will be
compatible from region to region, so that someone who is accustomed
to the voice-mail system in California can make a call in New York
and use the same keys for the same functions to store and send
messages. Compatibility also would allow people to take their
computer to another region and still be able to connect to local
databases.
   ``There has to be a lot of industry cooperation,'' said Gary
Handler, vice president of network planning at Bell Communications
Research, which does research and development for the Bell
companies. ``Widespread use of these services is going to depend on
(common industry) standards.''
   Handler said Bellcore is helping the seven companies coordinate
on technical standards, but each of the seven is developing its own
products.

   If working with the children's toy
Etch A Sketch is a spiritual experience, as artist Jeff Gosline
says it can be, his murals using up to 278 of the drawing devices
must leave him on a cloud.
   ``Everyone who sees these murals smiles,'' said the San Diego
artist who opened a one-man show at The Peace Gallery and Cafe on
Saturday.
   ``It's a fun thing. It stretches the limitations of a child's
art toy by putting it in another context, putting it in a gallery.''
   The plastic Etch a Sketch traces black lines on a gray
background with turns of the knobs on the front, and the drawing is
obliterated when the device is shaken.
   But the temporary nature of the drawing adds a dimension to the
experience, Gosline, 24, said.
   ``Your drawing is just going to be erased,'' he said. ``A lot of
people try to make art permanent, but how permanent is anything?''
   One of the murals is called, ``Child's Play,'' and features 72
Etch A Sketchs in a portrait of guru Sri Chimnoy playing the flute.
   Gosline guts the devices, sprays a fixing agent to keep the
images frozen on the screens, then glues the knobs. He mounts the
Etch A Sketch to the wall with Velcro.
   Ohio Arts, the device's maker, donated the toys to Gosline while
he was a student at the University of California at San Diego.

   As gavels fell ending a two-day special
session of the Washington Legislature, the strains of ``Here Comes
the Bride'' echoed through the ornate rotunda of the state Capitol.
   Minutes later, Janice Keller and John Brian Saul became man and
wife.
   There had been a question of whether they would do so Saturday
as planned.
   The Legislature had been scheduled to adjourn Thursday, but
unfinished business forced the lawmakers into a special session.
   State officials told Ms. Keller and Saul that the wedding might
have to be canceled if the Legislature did not finish its work in
time.
   But it became a night to remember for the happy couple.
   They were asked into the House chambers just before it adjourned
and were honored with a resolution.
   ``Now therefore be it resolved, by the House of Representatives
of the state of Washington, that it extends its best wishes to the
happy couple on this memorable day of their lives,'' stated the
resolution.
   Said Rep. Karen Schmidt, ``If they can follow this act,
everything can only be positive from now on.''

   Chuck Pascale thought an exploding snail
had blown his 5-year-old restaurant business to smithereens.
   Instead, it brought nationwide fame.
   Karen J. Prouty was celebrating her 36th birthday with a dinner
at Pascale Wine Bar & Restaurant on Feb 26. She was eating her
second escargot when it blew up in her face.
   Garlic butter caused minor burns around her right eye and
blinded her for 90 minutes. Prouty was treated at a hospital and
released the same evening.
   The snail's internal moisture had apparently built up steam that
propelled it right out of its depression in a ceramic serving dish,
Pascale theorized.
   Pascale said he pleaded with the local newspaper not to print a
story on the incident fearing it would hurt business. But he said
the night the article was printed, escargot was the most popular
item at the restaurant. Every snail in the building was sold, he
said.
   ``We've won national awards for four consecutive years, and
we've been nominated for a fourth star in Mobil Travel Guide,''
said Pascale's brother and partner, Neal Pascale. ``But this
definitely added to our national reputation.''
   The Pascale brothers and Etienne Merle are partners in the
establishment, which specializes in French and northern Italian
cuisine.
   Since the story was publicized nationally, the Pascales have
fielded about 30 calls from radio stations and newspapers around
the country. Friends and business associates have mailed them
newspaper clippings about their exploding snail from Los Angeles,
Phoenix, Milwaukee, New York, Washington, Miami and even Mexico
City.
   Humorist Dave Barry plans to write about the incident for his
nationally syndicated column April 17 in The Miami Herald.
   In the course of all the publicity, and after realizing Prouty
was not seriously hurt, the brothers said they have begun to accept
the humor in the accident.
   Now they quip about their flying snails and how they're training
them to stay in the dish.

   Jesse Jackson on Sunday was touting his
big win in his native South Carolina, while officials struggled to
count the final ballots after a record turnout at Democratic
caucuses.
   About 45,000 voters turned out Saturday, officials said.
   Even as he celebrated his victory, Jackson quickly turned his
sights toward the next battleground _ Illinois, which holds its
primary Tuesday.
   ``This is a 50-state marathon race and we're now moving into
another lap,'' Jackson said. Illinois is Jackson's adopted home
state; the civil rights leader has been based in Chicago for years.
   In a television interview, Jackson suggested that at the rate
he's going, he could lock up the Democratic nomination before the
convention in Atlanta in July.
   ``I hope by that time to have a majority of the popular votes. I
hope my delegate total will correspond to my popular vote and on
that basis I hope to be the nominee of the party,'' he said from
Chicago on NBC's ``Meet the Press'' program.
   With 1,668, or 93 percent of South Carolina's 1,788 precincts
reporting, Jackson had about 54 percent of the delegates to attend
county conventions later this month. Nineteen percent were
uncommitted while Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore Jr. collected 18
percent.
   Masachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis collected 7 percent and
Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt had 2 percent.
   In terms of the 44 national convention delegates at stake
Saturday, Jackson apparently will collect 23 while 15 will be
uncommitted and six went to Gore. There are also four so-called
super delegates from the state.
   Nationally, Jackson's delegate total lags behind that of
Dukakis. The Massachusetts governor has 460.5; Jackson has 423.55.
   Carol Kahre of the state Democratic Party said the estimated
turnout of 45,000 easily surpassed the old record of about 25,000
set back in 1976.
   She said it could be a couple of days before all the figures
from the counties are tabulated.
   ``The problem now becomes the county party priorities are
preparing for their county conventions,'' she said, adding state
officials must ``beg a lot'' to get all the numbers in.
   There's no official state certification of the results, she
said. The credentials of each delegate will be checked at the
county conventions and then again at the state convention.
   The record turnout for the meetings ``slowed them up and slowed
up the reporting. But that's a nice kind of problem to have,'' she
added.
   Earl Black, a political science professor at the University of
South Carolina, said the record turnout was due to ``a flurry of
final days campaign activity.''
   ``I'm certain the proportion of black voters at the Democratic
caucuses was higher than the overall percentage of black voters''
in the state, he said. ``With South Carolina being Jesse Jackson's
home state, there was a very strong incentive in the black
community.''
   ``Some of it was due to Gore's showing on Super Tuesday. Some
Democrats felt that there was (another) candidate out there they
could support,'' Black said.
   Jackson, Gore and Gephardt all campaigned in the state in the
days leading up to the caucuses.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorney General Edwin Meese III said Sunday
the United States still lacks legal backing for a Customs Service
plan to seize the passports of Americans suspected of entering the
country with illegal drugs.
   ``Our legal people are working with Customs and by the time that
that program starts, we will have a legal basis for it,'' Meese
said on ABC-TV's ``This Week With David Brinkley.''
   William von Raab, the Customs Service commissioner, announced
March 2 at the White House Conference on a Drug-Free America that
his agency will take the passports of Americans who try to re-enter
the country with illegal drugs, beginning Tuesday.
   Customs Service spokesman Edward Kittredge said the passports
would be seized as evidence of a crime and forwarded to the State
Department.
   Meese, questioned about a plan to shoot down planes used for
drug trafficking, said the program lacks the necessary amount of
certainty to determine whether a plane is carrying drugs.
   ``I think right now we do not have the capability of putting in
an effective program _ a foolproof program of shooting down planes
... and therefore I am not in favor of it at this time,'' Meese
said.

   Now that George Bush has virtually locked up
the Republican presidential nomination, he is carefully putting
some distance between himself and some elements of the Reagan
administration record.
   In a major switch in campaign strategy, Bush also is trying to
broaden his appeal to Democrats and independents _ a massive block
of voters that Ronald Reagan tapped successfully in 1980 and 1984.
   The vice president signaled this transition in tactics the day
after his most impressive electoral performance ever _ a stunning
sweep of the 16 GOP primaries on Super Tuesday.
   ``The message will have to be fleshed out more, and more
definitive,'' he said.
   Craig Fuller, Bush's chief of staff, said ``we don't want to get
out ahead of ourselves and launch a national campaign before we get
the nomination. But I think you'll see him beginning to talk more
about various issues.''
   Bush later departed abruptly from his basic stump speech.
   He told an audience of Republican boosters in Chicago Thursday
that if elected he would create a special White House office on
ethics and devise a new ethics code. It was a concrete proposal on
a general campaign theme he has pitched since last fall.
   ``I am tired of being embarrassed'' by news accounts of ethical
misdeeds by government officials, he said.
   He said his call for a White House ethics office should not be
taken as criticism of President Reagan. He said he was talking
about ``how I would do it.''
   In another part of the speech, he offered details on how he
would try to attack federal budget deficits _ going beyond a
four-year, flexible spending freeze proposed earlier. He said he
would take a ``hands-on'' role as a participant in negotiations
with congressional leaders.
   The Tower commission set up to investigate the Iran-Contra
affair concluded, among other things, that policy-making went awry
because of Reagan's hands-off management style.
   Bush had said early in his campaign that he intended eventually
to talk of ``shades of difference'' in how he would approach
things, as opposed to Reagan. And that's what happened Thursday.
   The Chicago Tribune, endorsing Sen. Bob Dole over Bush in the
next day's newspaper, said:
   ``Nowhere have the Republican candidates asked or answered the
kind of harsh questions the Democrats surely will raise in November
about the Reagan administration, whose colors Mr. Bush has been
able to wave more furiously than anyone else.''
   So, Bush's decision to hammer away at the theme of lifting the
level of ethics in government seems to be an attempt to position
the candidate to better cope with the Iran-Contra issue, the
investigations of Attorney General Edwin Meese and the convictions
of former White House officials Michael K. Deaver and Lyn Nofziger.
   Campaign manager Lee Atwater said ``it was a big mistake'' for
Dole of Kansas to continue running campaign advertisements
questioning Bush's role in supporting the arms-to-Iran initiative.
``This has created a lot of resentment in the Republican Party,''
he said.
   But Atwater and other top Bush strategists know they have not
heard the last of the issue, particularly in view of the continuing
investigation of the Iran-Contra affair by special counsel Lawrence
E. Walsh.
   Bush could find himself trying to campaign against a Democrat at
a time when administration figures are being indicted and tried in
connection with the scandal.
   The shift in Bush's strategy apparently resulted from a
conclusion that the vice president has sufficient strength _ with
705 of the 1,139 delegates needed to win the nomination _ to shift
toward a broader-based campaign.
   A dual purpose would be to lessen his vulnerability to criticism
by a Democratic opponent of the Reagan administration's record on
ethics and to reach out to blue-collar voters, Democrats,
independents and others who have supported President Reagan in the
past.
   ``I do think we'll reach out to ethnic groups and various
minority groups,'' Fuller said of the emerging Bush strategy. ``He
has consciously reached out to the Hispanic population in the
southwest and to Cubans in Florida. I think he will work very hard
to capture ethnic groups.''
   Bush also can be expected to touch up his campaign pitch to
appeal to workers _ as he did in acknowledging that not everyone
has benefited from the economic recovery. He said the face of a
jobless man in Illinois looks just as grim as the face of a man out
of work in Savannah, Ga.

   The storm system that dumped heavy snow on the Plains had moved
into Canada and weakened Sunday, and in its wake below-normal
temperatures extended from the Rockies to the Appalachians.
   Afternoon temperatures were below the freezing mark across much
of the northern and central Rockies, northern and central Plains
and the Great Lakes region.
   During the night, freezing temperatures were expected to extend
as far south as much of Texas and most of the lower Mississippi
Valley, except the Gulf Coast. Freeze warnings were posted for all
of Mississippi except coastal sections and for the Hill Country of
southern Texas.
   Snow showers extended from the upper Mississippi Valley across
the Great Lakes to the upper Ohio Valley. Two to 4 inches of snow
fell during the morning in snow belt areas near Lake Superior.
   A winter storm watch was posted for Monday across extreme
northeastern Ohio near Lake Erie, with as much as 8 inches possible
by Monday night.
   Freezing rain made travel hazardous over parts of inland
northern New England during the morning, especially in some deeper
valleys.
   Elsewhere, light snow fell over much of the Rockies during the
afternoon. Up to 4 inches fell in the mountains near Alamosa, Colo.
   Showers diminished across the mid-Atlantic states and the
Carolinas, but scattered thunderstorms broke out during the morning
along coastal sections from North Carolina to Florida.
   Heavier rainfall during the six hours up to 1 p.m. EST included
1.15 inches at Patrick Air Force Base at Cocoa, Fla., and 1.00 inch
at Orlando, Fla.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 9
degrees above zero at Yellowstone National Park to 87 at West Palm
Beach, Fla. The early morning low for the day was 19 degrees below
zero at Chadron, Neb., and West Yellowstone, Mont.
   For Monday, snow showers were forecast from New England across
the northern and central Appalachians and the Ohio Valley to the
Great Lakes region. Snow showers also were forecast from the
northern and central Rockies into the western Dakotas. Showers were
forecast in southern Florida.
   Highs only in the teens were predicted in parts of Upper
Michigan; in the 20s from northern Vermont across northern and
western sections of New York, Pennsylvania and West Virginia, the
upper Ohio Valley, the Great Lakes and the upper Mississippi Valley
to eastern sections of the Dakotas; in the 50s or 60s from the
southern Atlantic Coast across the Gulf Coast region, Texas and
much of the Southwest to the Pacific Northwest; in the 70s and
lower 80s in southern Florida and from the desert Southwest to most
of California; and in the 30s or 40s in most of the rest of the
nation.

   One man who died after a fall from a
hotel balcony and a second injured hours later at the same hotel
were not part of the annual invasion by out-of-state college
students, police said Sunday.
   With the onslaught of more than 300,000 college students on
spring break, Daytona Beach authorities have been trying to crack
down on such alcohol-related antics as climbing on motel balconies.
   In 1986, five died and seven were seriously injured in falls
from high-rise motels in Florida.
   On Saturday, Jay Stricklin, 24, of Orlando leaned over the
railing of a fourth-floor sundeck at the Seashore Motel and lost
his balance, police said. He was flown to Halifax Medical Center,
where he died of head injuries.
   Two hours later, David Baldwin, 19, of Ocala fell off a
second-floor roof onto the pool deck of the same hotel, and was
rushed seriously injured to the same hospital.
   A friend told police that Baldwin had been drinking all day,
said police Capt. Noel Ouellette.
   Baldwin was in serious condition Sunday with a concussion and
facial injuries, said hospital spokeswoman Charlotte Hinson.

   Hundreds of Nepalese crowded hospitals
Sunday and looked for relatives after a sudden hailstorm caused a
stampede at a soccer stadium, killing about 90 people and injuring
scores.
   Doctors at Katmandu's main facility, the Bir Hospital, said
about a dozen unidentified bodies could present a health hazard
because there was no place to properly store them.
   ``We have no room in the morgue. There is in fact no morgue to
speak of in medical terms,'' said one doctor, speaking on condition
of anonymity.
   The stampede occurred Saturday when a hailstorm struck during a
soccer game at the National Stadium. Witnesses said the crowd of
about 30,000 surged toward the one open exit, and many people were
crushed or suffocated to death.
   Government television reported 73 died, and witnesses said at
least 20 other bodies were taken away by relatives for cremation.
More than 100 people were treated at hospitals. Three people
remained in critical condition Sunday.
   Home Affairs Minister Niranjan Thapa said later Sunday that 70
people perished in the tragedy, including three police officers. He
said 94 people had been hospitalized with injuries, and 15 remained
in serious condition.
   Thapa denied reports that police charged crowds outside the
stadium when they attacked government cars with rocks. Witnesses
said police used batons to club people enraged that other gates to
the stadium had not been opened.
   The government ordered a judicial panel to investigate the
disaster and said it would pay compensation to relatives of victims
and to the injured.
   Soccer is Nepal's most popular sport, and Saturday's game was
the final match in a tournament between a team from the national
tobacco factory and a team from Bangladesh.
   Government-run newspapers reported that the crowd surged toward
the south exit _ where most people usually enter the stadium _ but
made no mention of other doors being locked.
   They reported that King Birendra and Queen Aishwarya visited the
injured in hospitals.
   The official national news agency reported that the government
declared a national day of mourning Sunday, a normal working day,
and ordered all sports events and other entertaintment canceled.
   At Bir Hospital, about a mile from the stadium, one patient,
Judha Tamang said, ``I got blessing from our beloved king and
queen.''
   Hundreds of anxious people crowded around one hospital building
where pictures of the unidentified dead had been posted.
   Bhayacha Kumale, from Thimi, just outside Katmandu, said he lost
two of his sons, aged 12 and 16, in the tragedy. A third son had
decided to skip Saturday's soccer game.
   ``I could not even give them a drop of water before they died,''
Kumale said.
   In Nepal, it is a tradition for relatives to gather at a dying
person's bedside and give him water to comfort him.
   The stampede was Nepal's worst sports-related disaster on record.
   It came just two days after part of a grandstand collapsed at
the main soccer stadium in Tripoli, Libya, reportedly killed around
20 people during a match between Libya and Malta.
   Some of the 60,000 spectators at the 75,000-seat ``June 11
Stadium'' panicked when someone brandished a knife, news reports
said.
   In the worst soccer disaster on record, rioting left nearly 300
people dead and 500 injured on May 24, 1964, in Lima, Peru, after
Argentina beat Peru on a last-minute goal.

<HEAD>India Rejects Cease-Fire Call By Tamil Leader</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Indian government rejected the
latest call for a cease-fire in Sri Lanka from a Tamil rebel
leader, saying his words did not match his deeds, an Indian
diplomat said Sunday.
   He said the appeal by Velupillai Prabhakaran, issued Saturday in
the southern Indian city of Madras, was one ``of a series of
communications we've received from time to time.''
   He noted that Prabhakaran's Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam had
continued to attack rival Tamil militants as well as Indian forces
sent to Sri Lanka last July to enforce a peace accord. The diplomat
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The Tigers, the largest Sri Lankan rebel group, have refused to
surrender their weapons as called for in the Indian-sponsored peace
plan signed by India and Sri Lanka. The pact was designed to end
the Tamils' nearly 5-year-old guerrilla war for an independent
homeland in northern and eastern Sri Lanka.
   India has an estimated 50,000 troops in Sri Lanka to enforce the
accord. Prabhakaran has been in hiding since an Indian offensive
against his stronghold in Sri Lanka's northern Jaffna peninsula
began last October.
   In his statement, Prabhakaran appealed for a cease-fire but said
he was skeptical that Sri Lanka's Sinhalese majority would abide by
the peace accord.
   Tamils, most of whom are Hindus and who make up 18 percent of
Sri Lanka's 16 million population, claim they are discriminated
against by the majority Sinhalese Buddhists.
   India became involved in the Sri Lanka conflicet because of its
Tamil minority of 60 million Tamils _ most of them in Madras and
surrounding Tamil Nadu state. Although India has sent troops to Sri
Lanka to enforce the peace pact, it has allowed the rebel groups to
maintain exile offices in Madras, 250 miles north of the island
nation of Sri Lanka, formerly Ceylon.
   In Colombo, Sri Lankan police said 15 Sinhalese had been
arrested in connection with an ambush near the eastern port of
Trincomalee on Friday in which 22 men, women and children were
killed. Most of the victims were Tamils.
   In the northwest, two Sinhalese serving in the Sri Lankan army
were shot to death Saturday 400 yards from the Adampan military
camp near Mannar.
   Military sources in Colombo said the soldiers were slain by
Liberation Tigers guerrillas.

<TEXT>
   A memo by a longtime friend of Attorney
General Edwin Meese III describes the two men joining in a
10-minute ``briefing'' of Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres on a
proposed $1 billion Iraqi oil pipeline.
   The memo by E. Robert Wallach, first disclosed in Sunday
editions of The Washington Post, says Peres ``literally dragged me
off into a corner'' and began discussing the pipeline ``intensely''
at an Israeli embassy reception in Washington on Oct. 16, 1985.
   The document says that in the crush of activity at the
reception, Peres then asked Wallach to wait until after the event
to discuss the pipeline further.
   ``Fortunately, as the time approached, my friend (Wallach's
usual phrase for Meese) arrived and there was a three-way
discussion which took approximately 10 minutes,'' said Wallach's
memo.
   ``He (Peres) is very quick and we went right to the point and he
was agreeable in all respects. It wasn't the kind of briefing I
would have preferred, but it seemed to be effective,'' the memo
said.
   Meese, interviewed Sunday on ABC-TV's ``This Week With David
Brinkley,'' denied the story, while Foreign Ministry officials in
Israel refused to comment on the latest report.
   The attorney general, asked if the report was correct,
responded: ``No it's not. It's the usual thing you expect these
days from The Washington Post, taking a small fact that is well
known and trying to blow it up into a new news story.''
   ``Many times, at that particular reception I had brief
conversations with Prime Minister Peres,'' Meese said. ``There's
nothing new to it.''
   Meese also reiterated that he will not resign his post despite
the growing controversy.
   ``Obviously I shouldn't step aside because if honest public
officials can be hounded out of office by partisan political
attacks, by media barrages, then no one as a public official is
safe,'' he said.
   The attorney general said that ``at no time has this
(investigation) detracted from my ability to do my job.''
   Asked if he should step aside for President Reagan's sake, Meese
said, ``I think it would hurt him. And I think it would hurt the
cause of good government more if I didn't stand up and fight these
false allegations because to leave would acknowledge that maybe
there's some truth to them.''
   On Sunday, James Rocap, one of Meese's lawyers, said that
``Wallach's account totally exaggerates'' the discussion ``in order
to impress his (Wallach's) client.''
   Wallach was legal counsel to Swiss oilman Bruce Rappaport, a
partner in the proposed project. Two months before the embassy
reception, Rappaport had paid Wallach $150,000, which Wallach
directed be sent to an account owned by W. Franklyn Chinn, an
investment manager at the time for both Wallach and Meese.
   Wallach's money was in effect pooled in several stock trades
with Meese's funds, sources familiar with a criminal investigation
of Meese, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Friday.
   Meese, asked about reports that he had profited from stock
trades involving $150,000, said, ``I knew nothing about this money
being paid.''
   Chinn's company had a separate financial arrangement with Meese.
The attorney general said that in any event his financial
arrangements with Chinn were set up as a limited blind partnership
so that ``I had no way of knowing what was being done or how it was
being managed.''
   Meese described Wallach as ``my friend'' and said he ``never
asked me to do anything that was wrong. ... In this case, a lot of
people are taking a simple situation where I turned something over
to the National Security Council staff and then for political
reasons or media attack reasons they're trying to make a big deal
out of it.''
   In a statement issued Feb. 1, Meese said that his total
involvement with Peres on the pipeline consisted of ``only two
contacts ... each was brief and limited and neither was initiated
by me.''
   A second memo by Wallach, also described in Sunday editions of
the Post, recounts a meeting in New York _ a few days after the
embassy reception in Washington _ involving Peres, Wallach,
then-National Security Council aide David Wigg and the Israeli
ambassador to the United States.
   Wallach said the meeting lasted about 15 minutes and that the
four discussed two proposed letters for Peres to sign, the first
committing Israel not to disrupt the pipeline and the second
dealing with the concepts of using U.S. foreign aid to Israel as
insurance for the project.
   Peres has said he recalls having met Wallach only twice, on
social occasions with others present.
   Peres eventually signed a later version of the first letter.
Peres said he could not act on a second letter without additional
consultation in Israel, Wallach's memo said.
   The pipeline project collapsed shortly thereafter for lack of an
insurance package. The Justice Department saw legal impediments to
using Israeli aid money.
   Finally, National security adviser John Poindexter, on the
advise of former NSC adviser William Clark, killed U.S. involvement
in the project.
   Meese's involvement with the proposed pipeline is under criminal
investigation by Independent Counsel James McKay, who launched a
probe of Meese's activities last May 11.
   The two memos were obtained from Wallach's files recently by
McKay's investigators, said sources familiar with the probe.
   The sources outlined the memos contents following the account in
the Post.

<HEAD>9-Year-Old Solos In Ultralight Plane, Claims Youngest Flier Record</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OCEANSIDE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 9-year-old boy flew an ultralight
airplane solo for 3{ minutes Sunday, giving him a chance at being
recognized as the youngest pilot to make a solo flight.
   ``It was smooth throughout,'' Tony Aliengena said after piloting
a Quicksilver GT Ultralight in calm, sunny weather at Oceanside
Municipal Airport, while his parents watched.
   Ultralights, descended from motorized hang-gliders, are not
regulated by the Federal Aviation Administration, which requires
pilots to be 16 years old before they can fly solo.
   Tony, of San Juan Capistrano, took off and made a touch-and-go
landing on the runway, then climbed more than 100 feet before
returning for a landing, said Don Taylor, who observed the flight
as a representative of the National Aeronautics Association.
   Taylor said he couldn't say exactly how the flight might be
classified by the NAA, which certifies aviation records.
   ``I don't know, to be honest with you,'' Taylor said, noting
that typical categories for ultralight records are in terms of
speed, distance and time.
   The NAA might create a new category or just ``recognize'' the
flight, he said.
   According to the Guinness Book of World Records, the youngest
previous solo pilot was Cody A. Locke, who flew a Cessna 150 near
Mexicali, Mexico, on Feb. 24, 1983, at the age of 9 years, 316 days.
   On Sunday, Tony was 9 years and 295 days old.
   Tony became interested in flying because he has flown as a
passenger in a plane owned by his father, Gary Aliengena, since the
age of 3. When he was 7, Tony was allowed to sit at the plane's
dual controls and guide the craft with his father.
   On March 30, Tony and an instructor plan to take off in a Cessna
210 in an attempt to to break the record for the youngest pilot to
fly across the United States.

   Iraq said it fired a missile into Tehran
Sunday to retaliate for Iranian artillery attacks that killed 21
people in Iraqi border towns.
   Iran vowed revenge, indicating a resumption of the ``war of the
cities'' after an uneasy two-day truce. A 12-day missile duel on
each other's capitals killed scores of civilians.
   ``If the Iranian regime continues its aggression, then our
retaliation will continue with all-out strength,'' an Iraqi
military spokesman was quoted as saying by the Iraqi News Agency.
   Iran's Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA), monitored in Cyprus,
confirmed that Tehran was hit. It said the missile exploded in a
residential neighborhood killing and wounding ``a number of
civilians.'' The agency gave no figures.
   IRNA quoted an official spokesman as saying, ``Iran's Moslem
combatants will severely retaliate'' and he warned Baghdad
residents to evacuate the Iraqi capital. The spokesman, who was not
identified, also denied as ``pure fabrications'' the Iraqi claim
that Iran had shelled Iraqi border towns.
   An Iraqi military spokesman, speaking on television, said Iran
broke the conditions of the city-war truce by shelling civilian
areas. He also said Iranian forces launched a ground attack in the
central sector of the front.
   ``Iraq will retaliate on Tehran for one time, as a warning to
the Iranian regime,'' said the spokesman, who was not identified.
   The Iraqis said a single Al Hussein missile, which has a range
of 400 miles, was fired at Tehran 290 miles from the border.
   The Iraqi military spokesman said 13 civilians were killed and
70 wounded in Iranian shelling of the town of Halabja, about 130
miles northeast of Baghdad. Another eight were killed and nine
wounded in other border towns, a communique said.
   Iraq has said it fired 71 Al Hussein missiles in the 12-day war
of the cities, including 59 at Tehran. Iran fired 27 at Baghdad.
Iran reported nearly 200 civilians killed and hundreds wounded,
while Iraq reported many civilian casualties but gave no figures.
   The Al Hussein missile is named after a Shiite Moslem saint.
Iraq says the missile is manufactured in Iraq, but Western military
analysts in Cyprus said it could be a Soviet-made Scud-B with
strap-on boosters to reach Tehran.
   Iran has used unmodified Scud-B missiles, which have a range of
190 miles, to attack Baghdad, 85 miles east of the border.
   The Iraqi News Agency said more than 1,000 Iranians were killed
in the 3{-hour ground battle in the central sector of the war
front. The battle began late Saturday and ended early Sunday.
   Iran did not comment on the report, but the Iran news agency
reported that in a separate raid farther north, Iranian
Revolutionary Guards and anti-government Kurdish guerrillas killed
or wounded 450 Iraqis.
   It said the combined forces seized 15 square miles of Iraqi land
and 12 ``strategic heights'' in the Sulaymaniyah area 160 miles
north of Baghdad.
   Iraq said Iranian troops in the central sector were backed by
tanks and artillery.
   ``Infantry units of Iraq's 2nd Army Corps repulsed the thrust,
exterminating the bulk of the force,'' the Iraqi agency quoted an
unidentified spokesman as saying.
   It did not say where exactly the battle took place, but the
relatively small scale of the fighting indicated it was not the
beginning of Iran's long-awaited major offensive.
   Iran's last thrust, in January 1987, brought its troops to
within six miles of Basra. But Western military analysts say Iran
has had difficulties mobilizing forces for a new attack.
   Iraqi News Agency quoted a military spokesman as saying Iraqi
planes ``dealt an accurate and effective blow to a very large
maritime target,'' a reference to a supertanker, off Iran during
the night.
   It did not give the exact time of the raid. It was the fourth
such claim in five days.
   Iraq had reported ships attacks on Friday and Saturday, but the
last confirmed raid was on Wednesday when Iraqi warplanes hit the
Maltese-flag, 41,195-ton tanker Tenacity.
   Before the attack Wednesday, the ``tanker war'' had been dormant
as the two belligerents hammered each other's capitals and major
cities in a resurgence of the ``war of the cities.''
   Scores of civilians were killed in both countries in the
unprecedented missile duels, which began Feb. 29. Iraq fired a
total of 71 missiles at Tehran, the holy city of Qom and central
Isfahan, while Iran shot 29 missiles.

   More than 3,000 people carrying Palestinian
flags and chanting slogans marched to the White House on Sunday to
protest Israeli policies in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Many of the protesters carried signs saying, ``Israelis: Stop
Killing Babies'' and ``Palestinians Deserve Statehood.''
   They condemned U.S. policy toward Israel, chanting, ``Reagan,
Shultz, you will see _ Palestine will be free.''
   The demonstrators called on the White House to freeze U.S. aid
to Israel until the Israeli government supports and participates in
the peace process.
   They also asked for a moratorium on miliary aid to Israel until
there is a political settlement and urged the Reagan administration
to establish direct contact with the Palestine Liberation
Organization.
   Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, who strongly opposes a
U.S. peace plan for the Middle East, is due to arrive in Washington
on Monday for talks with President Reagan and Secretary of State
George P. Shultz.
   Meanwhile, about 300 pro-Israel demonstrators rallied near the
offices of ABC News to protest the network's coverage of the
clashes between Israeli soldiers and Arabs in the occupied
territories.
   ``American viewers expect the whole story, not half-truths,''
Moshe Roumani, a professor at the University of Maryland, told the
crowd gathered about a half block from the ABC offices. The
demonstrators later marched past the network's entrance before
returning to their makeshift podium.
   Protesters carried banners saying, ``Half the Truth Equals a
Whole Lie,'' ``ABC _ Arab Propaganda Network,'' and ``Peter
Jennings _ PLOs Man on TV.'' Many in the crowd wore yellow pieces
of cloth to signify yellow journalism.
   A spokesman from ABC News was not immediately available for
comment.
   Speakers urged the crowd to write or call the network to protest
the coverage, while organizers sought signatures on petitions
calling upon the media ``to report the entire story.''
   ``We believe ABC News, along with the other major media, has
been presenting a significant amount of news from the Middle East
in a manner that is biased against Israel,'' the petition said.
   The group planned to deliver the petitions to the news divisions
of ABC, CBS, NBC, Cable News Network, Mutual Broadcasting System,
National Public Radio and the Public Broadcasting System, and the
managing editors of The Associated Press, The New York Times,
Reuters, United Press International and The Washington Post.

   Gov. Michael S. Dukakis' proposal to provide
health insurance to every Massachusetts resident by 1992 was
endorsed by a key Senate committee Sunday after it stripped the
bill of an exemption for small employers.
   A final version of the bill, which Dukakis has championed in his
Democratic presidential campaign as a model for the nation, could
be on the governor's desk by the end of the month, said Sen.
Patricia McGovern, chairwoman of the Senate Ways and Means
Committee.
   ``We are now three-quarters of the way toward having solved what
is really a 40-year fight in this country to come up with a degree
of coverage in health care that some of the other industrial
countries have had for a long period of time,'' Sen. John Olver
told panel members.
   The committee adopted the bill 7-2, sending it to the full
Senate.
   Hale Champion, the governor's chief of staff, said the
administration was pleased with the committee vote and was
optimistic that the Legislature would produce a final bill the
governor can support.
   McGovern, the proposal's earliest advocate, said she hoped the
Senate could begin debate Monday, so the bill could be passed and
sent to a House-Senate conference committee to work out differences.
   There are an estimated 600,000 uninsured residents in the state.
It is expected that employers will pick up the tab for many of them
through a series of tax breaks and pooled insurance proposals
outlined in the bill.
   The House version pegged the state's cost over the four-year
life of the bill at around $1 billion. The Senate version estimates
the state's share at about half that.
   About 90 percent of the Senate version agrees with the measure
passed overwhelmingly by the House two weeks ago, McGovern said.
   The two versions differ mainly over a House amendment to exempt
businesses of nine or fewer full-time employees from having to pay
a unemployment surcharge tax if they refuse to insure their workers
by 1992.
   The surcharge is intended to help pay for health care coverage
for the uninsured. The House-backed exemption of small employers,
which does not exist in the Senate version, would affect an
estimated 86,000 employers.

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The drop in gasoline retail prices has slowed
and may end as early as next month, an oil industry analyst said
Sunday.
   The latest nationwide Lundberg Survey found pump prices dropped
.37 of a cent between Feb. 19 and Mar. 11 to an average of 95.75
cents per gallon for all grades and services, including taxes.
   That was a slower rate of decline than in previous weeks and the
smallest drop since last November, analyst Trilby Lundberg said.
   ``This drop was barely over one-third of a cent, and several
indicators point to rising prices during the next few weeks if
crude (oil) prices hold,'' she said.
   Other factors contributing to a possible increase include
refiners' need for profits, reduced profit margins for dealers and
seasonal increases in consumption beginning in the spring and
peaking in the summer, she said.
   According to the latest survey, prices at self-service stations
were 86.39 cents per gallon for regular unleaded, 101.53 cents for
premium unleaded, and 82.94 cents for regular leaded. Self-service
accounts for 80 percent of all sales, Ms. Lundberg said.
   Full-service prices were: 116.98 cents per gallon for regular
unleaded, 127.27 cents for premium unleaded, and 112.75 cents for
regular leaded.

   Prince Edward, the youngest son of
Queen Elizabeth II, denied on Sunday a British newspaper report
that he plans to marry the Roman Catholic daughter of a Belgian
baroness.
   The People, a weekly London tabloid, reported earlier Sunday
that the 24-year-old prince had proposed to Georgia May, 22, whose
mother, Catherine, was born a baroness in the Van den Branden de
Reeth family.
   ``It's all complete fabrication,'' Edward said when he arrived
at the British Academy of Film and Television Arts Craft Awards
ceremony in Liverpool.
   The People report noted Edward would have to give up his right
as fifth in line to the British throne if he married a Catholic.
   Britain's 1701 Act of Settlement states only a Protestant can
become the monarch.s.
   The newspaper quoted Miss May's former boyfriend, New Zealand
yachtsman Ed Danby, as saying she told him of the engagement plan
to the prince in a telephone call last week.

   A Roman Catholic church leader
on Sunday condemned the use of car bombs, saying the terrorist
tactic could turn this Central American nation into another Lebanon.
   Monsignor Gregorio Rosa Chavez, the auxiliary bishop of San
Salvador, referred to the explosions Friday night of two car bombs
in San Salvador that wounded two people.
   Leftist guerrillas claimed responsibility for the attacks.
   ``Unfortunately, this was not just one more violent episode, but
an extremely grave step on the part of terrorism,'' he said in his
homily at the metropolitan cathedral.
   Speaking with journalists after the Mass, he said of the car
bombs: ``What we're seeing is a qualitative leap in terms of
terrorist tactics, and this is extremely dangerous.''
   He said such bombings could turn El Salvador into another
Lebanon, where car bombs have killed hundreds of people in the
civil war between Christian militias and Moslem factions that began
in 1975.
   Human rights groups say an estimated 65,000 people have been
killed in El Salvador's 8-year-old war between government forces
and leftist rebels, with at least half of the victims civilians.

<TEXT>
   The 70-year-old founder of the Iditarod
Trail Sled Dog Race streteched his lead Sunday as front-runners and
their dog teams passed the last checkpoint on the Yukon River
section of the race.
   Joe Redington pulled out of Kaltag, on the Yukon River, at 4:22
a.m. and turned toward Unalakleet, 90 miles away on the wind-swept
Norton Sound coast.
   Redington had left only nine of the 15 dogs with which he began.
Race rules require mushers to arrive in Nome with at least five
dogs in harness.
   Leaving Kaltag 2{ hours after Redington was Martin Buser of Big
Lake, who had passed Redington early Saturday before falling back
into second place again Sunday. Buser still had 13 dogs in harness,
one fewer than Saturday.
   Buser had arrived in Kaltag only 23 minutes behind Redington.
The town is 798 miles from Anchorage, where the 1,100-mile race
began March 5.
   Defending champion Susan Butcher, who won the last two races in
record times, left at the tiny village at 8:18 a.m., and four-time
champion Rick Swenson at 9:58 a.m., both with 12 dogs.
   The next checkpoint is Unalakleet, about 90 miles away on the
coast of Norton Sound. From Unalakleet, the teams run north along
the coast, open to the region's sudden storms and raking winds.
   The first musher to reach Nome will collect $30,000 of a
$150,000 purse; the next 19 finishers will split the rest. Three of
the 52 teams that started the race have dropped out, including one
Saturday.
   Redington, who founded the race in 1973, has never won, although
he has competed in all but two Iditarods.
   Redington had paced the race for more than 400 miles, before
Buser pulled out of Galena an hour ahead of him Saturday. Buser
also arrived first at the Nulato checkpoint, but then warm weather
forced both men to wait until dark before setting out for Kaltag.
   American mushers from outside Alaska were paced by Robin
Jacobson of Minnetonka, Minn., in 13th place. John Patten of Grand
Marais, Minn., was 24th; Frank Teasley, Jackson, Wyo., 27th; Terry
Adkins, Mikado, Mich., 31st; Dan McEachen, Snowmass Village, Colo.,
34th; and Stan Ferguson, Philadelphia, 45th.

   Passengers packed into trains and traveled under
ground and sea to the island of Hokkaido on Sunday as the world's
longest undersea tunnel opened to rail service.
   Some riders had waited in line more than a week to ensure a seat
on the first train that took them on the 99-mile trip from Aomori
at the tip of Japan's largest island, Honshu, to Hakodate in
Hokkaido, the country's northernmost main island.
   The Seikan Tunnel is 33.4 miles long and 14.4 miles is under
water. The Aomori-Hakodate trip takes about two hours, with 30
minutes inside the tunnel.
   Excavation techniques developed by Japanese civil engineers for
the tunnel are to be used in the construction of the planned Dover
Strait tunnel between England and France.
   Transport Minister Shintaro Ishihara, guest of honor on Sunday's
first Hakodate-bound train, told Japanese reporters after crossing
through the tunnel: ``It is a technological feat without parallel
in the world. It is a myth come true.''
   Next month, with the official opening of the Seto Ohashi Bridge,
a series of 11 spans totaling 7.6 miles linking Honshu with the
island of Shikoku, transport officials will complete a decades-old
plan of linking all four of Japan's main islands by rail.
   But the cost of the Seikan Tunnel, which took 24 years to build,
has fueled debate in Japan in an era of declining rail service.
   Overall construction and personnel outlays cost taxpayers about
$8.5 billion at current exchange rates, well above the original
forecast of $1.54 billion. The project also claimed the lives of 34
workers and ran 10 years behind schedule due to technical delays
and four major floods.
   Yukinari Shojiguchi of the Hokkaido Japan Railway Co., which
will lease the tunnel from the Japanese Railway Construction Public
Corp., said the new undersea rail line will operate at a loss.
   ``But it's worth it because more people will be coming through
to Hokkaido and utilizing the region, which has long been cut off
from developments on the mainland,'' he said.
   Figures released by Hokkaido Japan Railway indicate that about
2.3 million passengers and 5 million tons of cargo are likely to
pass through the tunnel each year.
   Shojiguchi said a final estimate of operating costs still was
being prepared, but did not deny reports pegging the annual level
at $23.1 million.
   An 80-year-old ferry boat service between Aomori and Hakodate
halted operation on the eve of the tunnel's opening. Thousands of
ferry fans visited the region for one last four-hour crossing over
the churning Tsugaru Strait, site of a ferry accident that killed
more than 1,100 passengers in 1954.
   ``A lot of people are sorry to see the ferries go. I don't think
many will be interested in riding through a dark tunnel,'' said
Etsuhiro Tomokane, a university senior from Osaka touring Hokkaido
during a school break.
   But Japanese critics charge that government officials erred in
approving construction of the tunnel because of the low volume of
traffic across the strait, and are skeptical of claims that the
tunnel will spur regional development.
   ``As far as the current railway service goes, it's not likely
that the new tunnel will help develop the region by attracting new
companies,'' said Scott Foster, transportation analyst with Merrill
Lynch in Tokyo.
   While a possible extension of the ``bullet train'' high-speed
line up through the tunnel could bring a turnabout, some critics
say the huge additional cost of building the line, which uses
different tracks, would only increase the deficits.
   Masao Takada, who operates a souvenir shop in Aomori, says
merchants on both sides of the tunnel are worried that it will hurt
business.
   ``Surveys show that the number of customers in Aomori and
Hakodate will decline because train passengers on their way to
Sapporo (in Hokkaido) from Tokyo are less likely to disembark and
shop around,'' he said.

<HEAD>Jackson, Simon In Dead Heat In Illinois</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Paul Simon's home-state support appears to
be slipping as the Illinois primary nears and he finds himself
locked in a tight race with Jesse Jackson, according to the results
of a newspaper poll to be published Monday.
   A Chicago Tribune poll of 500 Democrats likely to vote in
Tuesday's primary shows Jackson with 32 percent of the support and
Simon with 29 percent.
   But the poll, by Peter D. Hart and Associates has an error
margin of plus or minus 5 percentage points, making the race a
statistical dead heat.
   The latest poll, taken Friday and Saturday, updates one done
earlier last week and published in Sunday's Tribune. That poll,
with a similar sample and error margin, showed Simon holding 35
percent of the support to Jackson's 30 percent.
   ``I'm not saying every poll is inaccurate,'' Simon said while
campaigning Sunday in Chicago's Chinatown. ``All I'm saying is if I
get my message across to the people of Illinois, they're going to
vote for me.''
   Among other Democrats in the new poll, Massachusetts Gov.
Michael Dukakis was third with 20 percent, Rep. Richard Gephardt of
Missouri had 5 percent and Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore had 4 percent.
   The Tribune said 9 percent of the voters were undecided and 1
percent preferred none of the candidates.
   The newspaper did not update its Sunday poll of GOP voters,
which found Vice Presient George Bush the overwhelming favorite
among Illinois Repbulicans over rivals Kansas Sen. Bob Dole and
former TV evangelist Pat Robertson.
   The new Tribune poll found Jackson's support strongest in
Chicago, which represents nearly half of the state's likely
Democratic primary voters. Simon did best in counties closer to his
Southern Illinois home of Makanda and in the rest of Cook County
outside Chicago.
   Support for the two was split among racial and sexual lines.
Jackson was strongest among blacks and men, while Simon's support
was heaviest among whites and women, the poll results show.
   Among occupations, blue-collar workers supported Jackson far
more than other job classifications, while Simon's support was
nearly even among all occupations.

   ``The Last Emperor'' brought
Bernardo Bertolucci the Directors Guild of America's feature film
award, the second jewel in what may be a triple-crown season for
the Italian movie director.
   Bertolucci, who in January won a Golden Globe for directing
``The Last Emperor,'' picked up the DGA award Saturday night in
ceremonies held jointly at the Beverly Hilton Hotel and in New York.
   The DGA honor boosts his odds of winning an Oscar. Only three
times in the 40-year history of the award has it failed to coincide
with the Academy Award direction winner.
   Other top DGA winners were Will MacKenzie, who received the TV
comedy directing award for an episode of NBC-TV's ``Family Ties''
called ```A' My Name is Alex''; and Marshall Herskovitz, who won
the nighttime dramatic series award for his pilot for ABC-TV's
``thirtysomething.''
   In all, ABC shows won three of the television direction awards,
CBS won two, and NBC and PBS each won one. NBC had come in first in
the number of nominations with eight.
   Bertolucci's competition was Steven Spielberg for ``Empire of
the Sun,'' James L. Brooks for ``Broadcast News,'' Lasse Hallstrom
for ``My Life as a Dog'' and Adrian Lyne for ``Fatal Attraction.''
   In accepting his award, Bertolucci expressed his belief that
``cinema is the most international and the most classless of
expressions.''
   The Italian director, who won permission to film ``The Last
Emperor'' in China's Forbidden City, also observed that ``cinema is
living in shyness _ I might even say fear _ of television.
   ``Too many movies have been intimidated by television and have
tried to imitate the rhythms and the language of television. Maybe
I'm an idealist, but I still think of the movie theater as a
cathedral where we all go together to dream the dream together.''
   Other winners were:
   Dramatic show, daytime: Victoria Hochberg, ``Just a Regular Kid:
An AIDS Story,'' ABC Afterschool Special.
   Musical variety: Dwight Hemion, ``Julie Andrews ... Sound of
Christmas,'' an ABC special.
   Documentary-actuality: Elena Mannes, ``The Kingdom Divided (God
and Politics),'' on PBS.
   Sports: Robert A. Fishman, Syracuse-Indiana NCAA basketball
championship game, on CBS.
   Dramatic special: Judd Taylor, ``Foxfire,'' on CBS.
   Commercial directorial: Rick Levine, for three commercials:
``Trouble'' for Arnott's Biscuits; ``Bill Demby'' for DuPont; and
``Apt. 10-G'' for Pepsi.
   There also were several special achievement awards.
   Robert Wise, director of ``The Sound of Music'' and ``West Side
Story,'' received the D.W. Griffith Award, the guild's highest
honor.
   Sheldon Leonard, longtime DGA treasurer, was named recipient of
the Robert B. Aldrich Award for service to the guild.
   Former guild national executive director Michael Franklin, who
guided the organization through several important labor
negotiations with producers, received an honorary life membership.
   The 8,500-member DGA represents film and television directors as
well as assistant directors and production managers in movies and
associate directors and stage managers in television.

   Four Soviet army officers flew here from
Leningrad Sunday to observe winter maneuvers by North Atlantic
Treaty Organization forces, the allied press information center
reported.
   It said the Soviets would observe the military exercises for a
48-hour period. The month-long maneuvers in northern Norway involve
14,000 military personnel from eight nations.
   Under a 1986 Stockholm agreement, any country that signed the
pact has the right to inspect large-scale military exercises in
other countries to ensure that aggressive actions are not being
prepared. The agreement also requires member states to notify the
others of such maneuvers.
   The agreement was ratified by the United States, Canada and all
European countries except Albania.
   The press center said there have been five similar observation
missions. The Soviets sent observers to two NATO maneuvers in
Turkey and West Germany, and East Germany sent a team to West
Germany. The United States had observers at one exercise in the
Soviet Union and Britain one in East Germany.

   Israel choked off gasoline supplies to the
occupied West Bank on Sunday after Palestinian protesters set fire
to two fuel trucks and pelted others with stones. Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir flew to Washington Monday to meet with U.S.
officials.
   The army confirmed an Arab died after being shot in the eye in a
clash last week but denied reports that a 5-year-old boy perished
from burns caused by a tear gas grenade.
   The army said the boy had been playing with a kerosene stove
when he was fatally burned. A spokesman said the parents initially
blamed soldiers but later retracted the allegation.
   A police spokesman said more than half of the 850 Arab policemen
in the occupied West Bank of the Jordan River and Gaza Strip had
resigned in response to a campaign led by the Palestine Liberation
Organization.
   The United Nations said at least 91 Palestinians have been
killed since anti-Israeli rioting began Dec. 8 in the occupied
territories.
   Sunday night, police and organizers estimated from 200,000 to
250,000 Israelis gathered in Tel Aviv to back Shamir's refusal to
accept U.S. peace proposals.
   At the protest, demonstrators held signs that read, ``Peace now,
pay later,'' ``Yes to peace, no to withdrawal,'' and ``America to
the Indians.''
   The rally came one day after Peace Now demonstrators _ estimated
by Israeli newspapers at 40,000 _ protested in Tel Aviv, urging
Shamir to accept the U.S. peace plan.
   Shamir, at an airport news conference early Monday before
leaving for Washington, said he felt ``at peace with himself'' in
his decision to reject the plan. He added he hoped his talks with
President Reagan and Secretary of State George P. Shultz would
advance the peace process.
   After two fuel trucks were set ablaze in the West Bank and
others stoned, Maj. Gen. Amram Mitzna banned fuel trucks from
entering the occupied West Bank, the army reported.
   A senior official in the West Bank military government said fuel
would be delivered to stations that serviced hospital ambulances
and certain other vehicles.
   ``We will arrange for fuel deliveries only to places where it is
vital for public services,'' said the official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   The army confirmed economic restrictions had been imposed on the
West Bank town of Qabatiyeh, where an alleged pro-Israeli
collaborator was hung from an electrical pole last month after
shooting a child to death.
   The village will be barred from exports to Jordan and will be
unable to receive visitors from abroad, an army official said.
Qabatiyeh is also without electricity, he said.
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin last month said Israel might have
to resort to economic restrictions against the 1.5 million Arabs in
the West Bank and the Gaza Strip if strikes and violence persisted.
   Police ministry spokesman Nahum Mendel said 450 of 850 Arab
police officers in the West Bank and Gaza had handed in their
papers after underground leaflets called for their resignations.
   He said Israeli police might be called to help.
   Former police officers wearing civilian clothes could be seen
leaving a district headquarters building in Bethlehem after making
their resignations official.
   One of them, Rames, 33, who declined to give his last name, said
he was influenced by last week's brutal slaying in Jericho of a
police officer who was accused of being a collaborator.
   ``The killing made me decide very quickly,'' he said.
   Dozens of Arab tax collectors also have resigned, and
Palestinians have been called on to stop paying taxes.
   But a senior Israeli official said tax receipts were down only
about 10 percent for January and February.
   A military court, meanwhile, indicted a soldier from the elite
Givati brigade for manslaughter.
   An army spokesman said the soldier was en route to an army base
when his car was surrounded by stone-throwers. The soldier drew his
weapon and shot a Palestinian who cursed him, the spokesman said.
   Israel's Supreme Court cleared the way for the deportation of
three more Palestinians after rejecting an appeal and lifting a
temporary restraining order that had barred their expulsion. The
three were detained before the current unrest.
   Nine other Palestinians were handed deportation orders Jan. 3,
and four were flown to southern Lebanon on Jan 12. The move drew
strong international protests as a violation of Geneva Conventions
on the treatment of civilians in occupied zones.
   The divided Cabinet debated the U.S. peace proposals, and Shamir
said the 24-member body would vote on the plan after he returns
from his eight-day U.S. visit.
   Shamir has rejected several key elements of the U.S. plan,
especially its call for an international conference. But he
apparently held out hope of getting American agreement for changes.
The plan also calls for Palestinian self-rule in the occupied lands.
   Shamir told Israel radio that he would propose revisions to the
plan.

   Forming the world's longest conga line with almost
120,000 dancers was no problem Sunday for members of the crowd that
filled the streets of Little Havana for the Calle Ocho festival.
   ``It's very easy: Just face toward downtown, grab the shoulders
of the person in front of you _ and dance,'' Juan Carlos Sanchez,
organizer of the event.
   Anna Nicholas, a representative of the Guinness Book of World
Records, confirmed a record had been set at 119,986 dancers,
shattering the old mark of a 10,442-person chain formed last August
in Canada.
   ``There's no way it could fail. As soon as the music plays, we
just grab on to somebody and hang on,'' said Nuvia Valdez, one of
about 1.5 million who turned out for the food and fun of what is
billed as the nation's largest Hispanic festival.
   The river of people along 23 blocks of Eighth Street _ Calle
Ocho in Spanish _ began to move when Gloria Estefan and the Miami
Sound Machine blared their hit ``Conga'' from loudspeakers.
   On the street, 96 volunteers with bullhorns attempted to direct
the traffic of dancing feet, while Ms. Estefan shouted to the
crowd: ``Is everybody ready? Let's conga!'' A special computer
program helped count the dancers, and 30 observation posts were set
up.
   Since the street was clogged, forming a single line was
difficult, and untold thousands of people formed in a bevy of
smaller lines in addition to the mega-line that made the Guinness
tally.
   ``I've never seen this many people in one place in my life,''
said Jean-Louis Levasseur, who was vacationing from New Brunswick,
Canada. ``There's more people on this one street than in all of the
Maritime Provinces.''

<HEAD>Medicaid Recipients in Nursing Homes Face Increased Costs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hundreds of thousands of low-income people who
are elderly or disabled may have to pay an average of $50 to $75 a
month more for nursing home care under a new rule issued by the
Reagan administration, a published report said.
   The government said the rule, which takes effect April 8, would
enable states to ``shift more of the financial responsibility for
the cost of nursing home care to the recipient,'' The New York
Times reported in Sunday editions.
   The Department of Health and Human Services said the new rule
will save the federal government and the states from $160 million
to $615 millon over three years, according to the newspaper.
   The change could affect 20 percent to 50 percent of Medicaid
recipients in nursing homes or other institutions, the department
said.
   Under the new rule, states will be allowed for the first time to
eliminate or curtail the deductions they must now permit Medicaid
recipients for medical costs not covered by the state Medicaid plan
_ such as eyeglasses, hearing aids, dentures, physical therapy and
prescription drugs, according to the Times report.
   Medicaid recipients currently deduct these medical expenses from
their income before determining how much they must pay for nursing
home care.
   The Health and Human Services Department estimated the rule will
require additional payments averaging $50 to $75 a month by each
Medicaid recipient in a nursing home who has income from a pension,
Social Security or other sources, according to the Times.
   In a statement published in the Federal Register, the
administration said the purpose of the rule was to ``reduce
administrative problems for states'' and to give them ``maximum
flexibility in operating their Medicaid Program costs,'' the
newspaper said.
   Toby S. Edelman, who represents nursing home residents as a
lawyer with the National Senior Citizens Law Center, told the
newspaper: ``The new regulation reverses a longstanding policy of
the Department of Health and Human Services. There was no
congressional action or judicial mandate calling for such a
reversal.''
   Congress could pass legislation to override the rule change, but
has apparently not focused on the issue, the Times said.

   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir left for
Washington early Monday, saying he felt ``at peace with myself'' as
he prepared to tell President Reagan he opposes a U.S. peace plan.
   But Shamir, who leaves behind a deeply divided coalition
government, expressed hope for results in the peace process from
his talks with Reagan and Secretary of State George P. Shultz.
   ``The state of Israel was and is always ready to stretch its
hand and to participate in negotiations on establishing peace in
our area. No other people desires peace like us,'' Shamir said at
an airport news conference.
   ``I am at peace with myself. I know I will be able to convince
my interlocutors and then all the others will say: `Amen.'''
   Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, head of the Labor Party, supports
the peace proposal worked out by Shultz during a Middle East tour
earlier this month.
   ``Leave in peace and come back with peace,'' Peres told Shamir
at the departure ceremony at the Ben Gurion International Airport.
   Shamir, leader of the right-wing Likud bloc, discussed the plan
with Cabinet ministers for the third time Sunday but said he would
not call for a government vote until after his trip.
   ``After I come back with a summation of my talks with
representatives of the American government, the Cabinet will meet
immediately and I think we'll have a decision on this subject,''
Shamir said on Israel Radio. ``It's a matter of about a week.''
   Newspapers reported some 40,000 Israelis attended a rally
organized by the Peace Now movement in Tel Aviv Saturday night and
called for Shamir to accept the U.S. proposals and to end the
20-year occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Sunday night, thousands of Israelis gathered at the same square
in Tel Aviv for a counter-rally backing Shamir. Police and
organizers estimated some 200,000-250,000 people were at the rally.
   The demonstrators held signs that read, ``Peace now, pay
later,'' and ``Yes to peace, no to withdrawal.''
   A Shamir deputy, David Levy, told the crowd that if Israel
adopts the U.S. peace proposal, ``it will have to go to war in the
future.''
   Shamir, who has said the U.S. plan is ``fraught with danger''
for Israel, repeated his opposition Sunday but said he would
propose his own ideas for peace in the region.
   The U.S. proposal calls for taking two steps this year: enacting
Palestinian self-rule in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip and
starting talks on the final status in the territories. Those
negotiations would be kicked off by an international conference.
   For his part, Shamir will suggest implementing Arab self-rule in
the terroritories on a step-by-step basis, holding peace talks
under Soviet-American auspices instead of an international peace
conference and using a more flexible time schedule to start
negotiations, said Shamir aide Yossi Ahimeir.
   Shamir is scheduled to meet with Shultz Monday and will meet
with Reagan on Wednesday, officials in Jerusalem said.
   Labor Party legislator and former U.N. Ambassador Abba Eban also
left for the United States on Sunday, saying he hoped to make it
clear to American officials that the conservative prime minister
represents only half the Israeli government. The other half, he
said, would like to see Israeli involvement in the peace plan.
   ``We can't appear as a country that refuses every chance for
peace,'' Labor legislator Rafi Edri said on the radio. ``The time
has arrived for him (Shamir) to return to reality.''

   East German leader Erich Honecker
on Sunday opened the Leipzig trade fair, the largest East-West
gathering of manufacturers and exporters.
   About 9,000 exhibitors representing 100 foreign countries are
attending the fair that runs until Saturday, the state-run ADN news
agency reported.
   It said about half of the exhibitors are from East Germany.
   The news agency said that a message by President Reagan posted
at the American exhibit expresses hope for more U.S.-East German
trade.
   ``I hope this trade fair serves to advance our relations and to
create a mutually beneficial trade dialogue between our two
countries,'' ADN quoted the message as saying.
   Communist East Germany's economy has slumped in recent years and
leaders have hoped to improve it by increasing exports to the West.

   Panama's political turmoil has been a
wrenching experience for three Panamanian diplomats who are defying
the sentiments of most of their Washington colleagues by remaining
loyal to embattled strongman Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   Two are described by acquaintances as showing signs of emotional
stress as a result of Panama's ordeal while a third has remained
holed up in the country's consular affairs office since the crisis
began more than two weeks ago.
   Most Panamanians attached to diplomatic offices in the United
States closed ranks around Ambassador Juan B. Sosa, who refused to
recognize the February 26 change in government in Panama and
continues to support ousted President Eric Arturo Delvalle.
   With U.S. backing, Sosa has declined to relinquish control over
the embassy despite efforts by the Noriega-controlled government to
replace him.
   A number of Panamanian diplomats elsewhere have broken with
Noriega as well. The latest known case involves the consul general
in Atlanta, Jaime Trujillo, who notified Sosa on Thursday that to
continue supporting the present leadership ``would contribute to
the disintegration of the Panamanian family.''
   The three Panamanians in Washington who have stuck with Noriega
have close personal ties to the defense chief or his inner circle,
according to friends and colleagues, all of whom insisted on
anonymity.
   Roberto Leyton, who has known Noriega for years, is Panama's
ambassador to the Organization of American States and is the
highest ranking of the three. Leyton is described by one
acquaintance as having lost weight and has been keeping an
unusually low profile. He has refused to return a reporter's phone
calls.
   His principal deputy at the OAS, Lawrence Chewning Febrega,
broke with Noriega a month ago after being ordered to deliver an
anti-U.S. speech which he felt contained misrepresentations. He
said he also was troubled by evidence of corruption in Panama.
   It wasn't until two weeks later that Panama's crisis came to a
head. Delvalle attempted to fire Noriega but was ousted himself
within hours in a Noriega power play that included a late-night
vote by Noriega supporters in the country's congress.
   Since then, Alejandra Sarmiento, a consular affairs officer, has
remained confined in the building where she works adjacent to the
Panamanian Embassy.
   According to acquaintances, Ms. Sarmiento is worried that if she
departs the office, she will not be allowed to return. Sosa has
taken no action to evict her.
   Ms. Sarmiento is said to be a friend of Nander Pitty, a former
OAS ambassador who is now a top aide to Noriega.
   The military attache at the embassy is Capt. Jose Motta, the
only embassy official who reports to Noriega and not to the
ambassador.
   As a professional soldier, Motta is not called on to make
political judgments and believes that his role is not affected by
political shifts back home.
   But a Panamanian diplomat who has been in contact with Motta
said the captain has been under a doctor's care recently for high
blood pressure, a condition which worsened after the crisis erupted.
   His appearances at the embassy have been more infrequent lately,
and he often stays only for a few minutes before departing. The
relationship between Motta and others at the embassy is said to
have become strained.
   Sosa has told Motta that he wants to keep lines of communication
open in the event that Noriega wishes to send messages to the
ambassador through Motta. Thus far, no communications have been
sent.
   A senior Pentagon official said Motta has been in contact with
defense officials in an attempt to learn what the U.S. government
is doing in Panama.
   ``He's trying to figure out what's going on ... so he can report
back to his boss,'' the official said. ``But he's not in any
position of trying to broker a deal. And he's not contacting us
nearly as much as before.''

   Men in civilian clothes fired guns
outside a church service Sunday and attacked two TV cameramen after
roughing up a woman who was selling an anti-government newsletter.
No one was injured.
   The attack came at the Roman Catholic Church of El Cristo Rey,
long a center of government opposition activity, just as its
pastor, the Rev. Xavier Villanueva, was beginning a late-morning
Mass.
   An Associated Press reporter and photographer said eight to 10
men first attacked a woman selling pamphlets at the entrance of the
church, in a middle-class neighborhood near the city's center.
   When several parishoners ran to her aid, the attackers began
firing handguns in the air and using large rocks to break car
windows.
   Marcello Zanini, an Italian camerman for the Worldwide
Television Network, said two of the gunman struck him and stole his
video camera as he was shooting the scene.
   ``When they started shooting, I crouched behind a tree and when
I looked up, I saw those two men coming at me,'' said Zanini, who
is based in El Salvador. ``They hit me and took my camera away.''
   The attackers also ripped a cable from the television camera of
a CBS crewman and tried to seize the camera of Juana Anderson, a
Reuters news agency photographer, but only managed to rip off the
flash device.
   The men threw rocks at other reporters on the scene.
   At least one of the attackers was jumped on by a group of
churchgoers, but he managed to break free and join the other
attackers as they ran for their parked cars about two blocks away,
firing as they fled.
   A policeman watched the attack from a street corner half a block
away, but made no effort to halt it. Asked by a woman why he had
not intevened, he replied: ``Lady, I have nine children who must
eat every day.''
   The pamphlet vendor, displaying cuts and bruises on her face and
chest, said she had been shoved and struck several times. She would
not give her name to reporters.
   ``There are people here who would like to have names,'' she said
in an apparent reference to undercover government agents.
   The government's opponents have frequently accused it of using
hired thugs or plainclothed state security agents to break up its
demonstrations.
   Two people were killed in separate protest marches last year
when attackers in civilian clothes fired into the crowd.
   Anti-government activists have been waging a campaign since June
to oust Panama's military strongman, Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega,
who is under indictment in the United States on drug trafficking
charges.
   His government has closed all opposition newspapers, radio and
television stations. His foes spread their messages through
handbills, mimeographed newsletters and photo copies of articles
appearing in foreign publications.
   The opposition campaign is led by the National Civic Crusade, a
coalition of about 200 professional, business, labor, political and
other groups that was formed last June. Many of the El Cristo Rey
parishoners are Crusade members.
   Villanueva, a Spanish priest who is a well-known government
critic, restored order inside the church by leading the
congregation in a hymn. In his homily, he spoke of King David
uniting the people of Israel.
   ``The people had to suffer,'' the priest said. ``But out of that
suffering came unity. ... Thus it will be for Panama. Panamanians
have had it too easy. Almost everything has been given to them. Now
we are seeing the sense of nationality being forged under
suffering. We are forging a new, united Panama.''
   As the congregation cheered and clapped, the priest then read a
recent communique of the Panamanian Conference of Bishops that
called for a return to civilian authority and the restoration of
full civil liberties.
   ``This is the season of Lent,'' the pastor said. ``Panama will
rise this Easter.''

   Communist rebels killed two soldiers
in Manila's suburbs Sunday, police said. Protesters forced
President Corazon Aquino to cancel a scheduled ceremony
inaugurating a housing project in the southern Philippines.
   Rebel assassins shot dead Sgt. Edwin Salalima as he was walking
down a street near his home in suburban Taguig, police said.
   In a separate attack, rebels killed Sgt. Juanito de Olazo after
he arrived in his car for services at a Baptist church in suburban
Malabon.
   Police said they found a note near de Olazo's car claiming he
had been a member of a Philippine Constabulary intelligence unit
that hunts down rebels.
   Also Sunday, Mrs. Aquino flew to Cagayan de Oro on the northern
coast of Mindanao island Sunday to open a sports festival and also
lay the cornerstone at a housing project for about 1,000 people,
including former rebels who had surrendered.
   But the housing project ceremony was canceled after some 300
people picketed the site claiming the government was ignoring the
needs of the poor.
   On a television talk show, political and business leaders,
including opponents of Mrs. Aquino, announced they have formed a
group that will seek to change the country's political system and
economy.
   Opposition Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile said the 30-member Nation
Movers For Reconstruction and Survival wants ``to change the
structure of the government because it is too centralized.''
   Appearing on the television program, he said ``all decisions now
come from Malacanang (the presidential palace).'' He also caid Mrs.
Aquino's government does not understand the problems of people in
the countryside.
   But the group is not uniting to oppose Mrs. Aquino, said its
leader, industrialist Enrique Zobel who was on the program with
Enrile. ``We want people from both the left and the right,'' Zobel
said.
   Enrile said the Nation Movers want to change the country's
economy, educational system and foreign policy, and will study land
reform.
   Asked about their position on U.S.-run bases in the Philippines,
the men said they had not taken a stand.
   The United States operates Clark Air Base and a naval base at
Subic Bay, both north of Manila, along with four smaller facilities
under an agreement that expires in 1991. It pays the Philippines
$180 million a year for the bases.
   The two sides are to begin a review of the bases pact later this
month, and the Philippines is expected to ask for a major rent
increase.

<HEAD>Porn Actor John Holmes Dies After Reported Battle With AIDS</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pornographic film star John Holmes, who
boasted of thousands of sexual conquests during a career that
spanned two decades, died at a hospital, a business associate said
Sunday. He was 43.
   Death came about two weeks after police again questioned Holmes,
reportedly gravely ill with AIDS, at his hospital bedside about the
unsolved slayings of four people.
   Holmes died Saturday night at the Veterans Administration
Medical Center, said adult film producer William Amerson, a
longtime friend and business associate.
   ``It's a real emotional time for me right now,'' said Amerson.
``It's a real shock. He did die. It was last night.''
   The hospital refused to confirm the death, and a nursing
official hung up on reporters. The case has not been referred to
the Los Angeles County Coroner's Office, said spokesman Claude
Boucher.
   Amerson said the cause of death was not immediately known.
   The Los Angeles Times earlier this month quoted anonymous
sources as saying Holmes, star of such X-rated movies as
``Exhausted'' and ``Tell Them Johnny Wadd is Here,'' was gravely
ill with acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
   It also was reported that he was re-questioned by police
detectives about the unsolved 1981 bludgeoning murders of four
people in a house in Laurel Canyon.
   Holmes was acquitted of the murders during a 1982 trial after
jurors cited a lack of corroborating evidence, but has never told
authorities what he knew about the slayings.
   Deputy District Attorney Ronald Coen, now a Superior Court
judge, alleged at trial that Holmes led the murderers at gunpoint
to the house at the orders of Los Angeles nightclub owner Adel
Nasrallah, also known as Eddie Nash. Holmes' palmprint was found
over one of the victim's beds.
   Police and prosecutors alleged Nash sought revenge for a robbery
at his house days earlier by people who lived at the home. Nash was
never charged in the slayings, but remains a suspect in the case,
said Detective Tom Lange.
   During the re-questioning, Holmes refused to answer questions
about the case, his attorney, Mitchell Egers, said two weeks ago.
Calls to Egers' law office went unanswered Sunday night.
   Holmes was the premiere male sex film star of the 1970s and
early 1980s, making hundreds of sexually explicit films and
thousands of peep shows in his career.
   He was best known for his portrayal of the character ``Johnny
Wadd,'' a detective. Movies from the Johnny Wadd series, made
between 1976 and 1980, include ``Liquid Lips'' and ``Blonde Fire.''
   Holmes once claimed to have had sex with 14,000 women on and off
the screen. He also admitted after his trial that he had a
$1,000-a-day cocaine habit.

   The ruling Sandinista party invited
opposition parties and groups Sunday to renew stalled talks with
the government on national reconciliation.
   President Daniel Ortega, reading a statement from top party
officials, called for a resumption of talks that would, ``in a
serene manner, discuss all the political points that could
preoccupy'' the civic opposition.
   The Sandinista statement also said the government would redouble
its efforts ``to reach an effective cease-fire'' during talks with
leaders of the U.S.-supported Contra rebels scheduled for March
21-23 in the southern border town of Sapoa.
   Talks between the leftist government and its internal opposition
are called for in a Central American peace plan signed by five
presidents in the region last Aug. 7.
   The directorate and assembly urged opposition parties, labor
unions, trade guilds and media ``not to continue provoking
situations that explode the public wrath.''
   Government talks began Oct. 5 with 15 opposition parties, but
stalled Dec. 15 when the government refused to discuss 17
opposition proposals to modify a new national political
Constitution, which went into effect in January.
   Ortega accused opposition party leaders at the time of allowing
themselves to be used as instruments by the CIA in its efforts to
launch an invasion of Nicaragua.
   The Sandinistas maintained that any modifications to the
Constitution would have to be addressed by the National Assembly.
   Sandinista delegates comprise a majority in the Assembly.
   Antonio Bonilla of the Social Democratic party told The
Associated Press Sunday that the Sandinista representatives in the
National Assembly ``would not accept the discussion of the
constitutional reforms.''
   Bonilla said that opposition leaders were considering meeting on
Monday to study the Sandinista proposal and issue a response.
   More than 40,000 people have been killed in Nicaragua since
November 1981, when the Contras began fighting the Sandinista
government.
   The Central American peace plan calls for cease-fire
negotiations in Nicaragua, El Salvador and Guatemala, and a series
of reforms to bring greater democracy to the region.

<HEAD>Sen. Biden Returns to Hospital for Check on Possible Blood Clot</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr., D-Del., who
underwent brain surgery a month ago to repair an aneurysm in a
blood vessel, checked into Walter Reed Army Medical Center on
Sunday night so doctors could see if he is suffering from a blood
clot in his leg, a hospital spokesman said.
   ``We're going to give him a good looking over,'' said spokesman
Pete Esker. ``We're looking to see if there's a blood clot in one
of his legs, and we want to make sure that if there is, it is not
moving toward the heart or the brain.''
   Esker said Biden was relaxing and talking to his wife, Jill,
shortly after entering the hospital, and said there was no
immediate condition report on the 45-year-old senator.
   ``It's not a routine examination, and it wasn't planned, but at
this point there's really nothing to worry about,'' he said.
   Biden had undergone surgery Feb. 12 to repair an aneurysm in an
artery supplying blood to his brain. He was released nine days
later.
   Doctors found a second aneurysm in Biden's brain during the
first operation and said surgery eventually will have to be
repeated, but that second operation was not expected to take place
for several months.
   ``After surgery you don't get a lot of activity, and it's
possible for a clot to develop,'' Esker said. ``This wasn't a
planned thing, but he is awake and fully aware of everything that's
going on.''
   Biden had announced his candidacy for the Democratic nomination
for president last June but dropped out of the race in September
after he admitted committing plagiarism in law school, acknowledged
that he had xaggerated his academic record and was criticized for
lifting sections of other politicians' speeches without attribution.

   Weary firefighters worked Sunday to
extinguish hot spots still smoldering in a brush fire that charred
hundreds of square miles of Texas prairie.
   State and federal officials began a damage assessment, and Gov.
Bill Clements' office was considering whether to issue a disaster
proclamation early this week.
   The blaze, which started Thursday as a trash fire, burned about
300,000 acres in one county alone, raced into sections of four
other counties and threatened the towns of Albany and Moran in
Shackelford County and Baird in northern Callahan County, just east
of Abilene in the north-central part of the state.
   But hundreds of volunteer firefighters and three tanker
airplanes dropping fire-retardant chemicals contained the brush
fire Saturday.
   The fire killed livestock, burned trailer homes and oilfield
equipment and closed roads.
   About 80 people who fled their homes opted to remain Sunday
night in a shelter set up in a church across from the Albany City
Hall, said Jerri Malone, a spokeswoman for the Red Cross in Abilene.
   Bill Terry, also with the Forest Service, noted that the fire
consumed from one-third to one-half of grassland in Shackelford
County.
   ``The fire is still smoldering in some places but it's a case of
flareups within burned areas. There has been no movement in the
fire line since yesterday,'' Tom Millwee of the state Division of
Emergency Management said Sunday.
   ``The head fire has been in essence stopped. At one time, we
talked about it being a 60-mile-long stretch from Interstate 20 by
Baird and north to Albany,'' he said.
   The charred area stretched about 60 miles long and 25 miles wide
in parts of Callahan, Shackelford and Throckmorton counties.
   Representatives of the Department of Public Safety, Texas Forest
Service and federal agencies met Sunday to decide whether to
declare the fire under control, but put off the decision.
   ``The forward advance has been halted,'' said Pat Ebarb, head of
the fire control department for Texas Forest Service in Lufkin.
``Now, what we have to do is make sure the fire that's bumping up
against our control lines is extinguished.''
   ``Many of these big fires have a history of laying there and
then coming back out. We don't want that to happen this time,'' he
said.
   Once the mop-up begins, ``that'll take about two days,'' said
Sam Logan, public information officer for the Texas Forest Service.
``We'll continue to keep an eye on it, because with the strong
winds and low humidity, just a spark could start it up all over
again.''
   ``We've pretty well got fire guards around the complete fire,''
said Pat McKennon, the Baird fire chief. ``We will have Forest
Service crews out and some local fire units out, just more or less
patrolling.''
   State Forest Service spokesman Joe Fox said about 70 percent of
the total damage was believed to have occurred in Shackelford
County, where the flames covered about 300,000 acres of rangeland,
or a little more than half of the county's 915 square miles.
   The Federal Emergency Management Agency in Washington approved
aid Saturday to help reimburse the state for expenses of fighting
the fire in Throckmorton, Jones, Haskell, Callahan and Shackelford
counties, said Carl Suchoki, FEMA spokesman in Washington.
   ``It looks like the Baird area is well controlled,'' said
Millwee. ``They had isolated fires last night _ mostly burns within
the main burn _ and there was a little more of that kind of
activity, hot spots to contend with, in the Albany area.''
   Albany, the county seat of Shackelford located 31 miles
northeast of Abilene, has about 2,500 residents. Baird has about
1,700 and Moran about 350.
   Millwee said no figures on loss of livestock or crops were yet
available and a monetary damage estimate had not been made.
   ``The county (agricultural) agents are working through the
system, looking at any prospects for USDA or other disaster
declarations,'' he said.
   Mnay firefighters suffered smoke inhalation and minor burns,
said Millwee, but no residents were hurt.
   ``It is amazing that a fire could burn that far and for that
long and not do more than it did,'' he said.

   Gallaudet University's board of trustees on
Sunday chose the dean of the school's college of arts and sciences
to become the first deaf president in the 124-year history of the
school for the hearing impaired.
   I. King Jordan, a popular campus figure, was chosen to replace
Elisabeth Ann Zinser, a hearing woman, who resigned early Friday
after protests from students seeking a deaf leader had virtually
paralyzed Gallaudet's campus.
   ``We will no longer accept limits on what we can achieve,''
Jordan told a cheering crowd of about 250 students at the downtown
hotel where the board had met earlier. `I am confident we will walk
boldly into a future without artificial limits.'
   School officials also announced that board of trustees
Chairwoman Jane Bassett Spilman, who came under fire from
protesters for her handling of the crisis, has resigned. She will
be replaced by Philip W. Bravin, one of four deaf members on the
board.
   In a near-total victory, Bravin announced that the board would
form a task force to study composition of the board in response to
student demands that deaf people comprise a majority of the
20-member panel. There also will be no reprisals against student
protesters, Bravin said.
   ``I took this step willingly,'' said Spilman in announcing her
resignation from the board. ``In the minds of some, I've become an
obstacle. I am removing that obstacle.''
   News of Jordan's selection was received with joy on Gallaudet's
campus.
   ``We love it. We know now the university is going to be ours,''
said Gallaudet graduate student Paul Singleton, who is deaf. ``He's
the perfect president, the perfect selection.''
   There was pandemonium in the campus gym, where about 200
students had gathered throughout the day as the board met.
   ``God made the world in seven days and we have changed it in
seven days,'' Charles A. Giansanti, a deaf chemistry professor,
told the crowd.
   Jordan, a finalist for the position when Zinser was selected,
stunned protesters by endorsing Zinser's presidency at a news
conference Wednesday, but gave protesters an emotional lift when he
retracted his backing of Zinser the following day.
   Before becoming dean of Gallaudet's largest undergraduate
department in 1986, Jordan, 44, served as a psychology professor at
the school. He becomes the seventh president of the nation's only
liberal arts college for the hearing impaired.
   Another deaf candidate who was considered for the presidency was
Gallaudet board member Dr. Harvey Corson, the superintendent of the
Louisiana School for the Deaf.
   Jordan's appointment comes after a tumultuous week in which
clamor for a deaf president grew from an isolated campus protest to
a national platform for deaf rights.
   Students forced school officials to cancel classes Monday, when
they blocked all entrances to the campus and prevented faculty and
staff from entering. Throughout the rest of the week, students
boycotted classes, and on Wednesday, more than half the school's
faculty voted to back the protesters.
   Gallaudet, founded by an act of Congress in 1864, offers
undergraduate and graduate degrees in 30 fields.
   Meanwhile, congressional investigators plan Tuesday to
scrutinize Gallaudet's board of trustees and presidential selection
process.
   The House Education and Labor Committee's subcommittee on select
education is scheduled to investigate the university's bylaws,
which allow the board to pick its own members. Lawmakers also are
expected to examine the process by which Zinser was chosen.
   Gallaudet, chartered by an act of Congress in 1864, receives 75
percent of its $76 million budget in federal funds.
   The House panel, chaired by Rep. Major Owens, D-N.Y., has
jurisdiction over Gallaudet's funding.

   The 130 members of a high school band from
Michigan sang the school fight song Sunday to a schoolmate who has
been waging his own fight against bone cancer.
   Members of the Belding High School band and about 95 parents
made the surprise visit to the University of Chicago's Wyler
Children's Hospital, where they sang the band's theme song,
``Friends,'' to Eddie Mikek as he emerged from an elevator in his
wheelchair.
   ``There wasn't a dry eye in the whole building,'' said Eddie's
mother, Janice Mikek.
   ``He didn't know they were coming, and it took him a minute or
two to figure out what was happening,'' she said. ``Then he started
crying like all the rest of us.''
   The band was on its way to Dublin, Ireland, to march in the St.
Patrick's Day parade, and the musicians decided to stop at the
hospital on the way to O'Hare International Airport.
   They sang to Eddie because their instruments were packed up for
the trip. ``Eddie's not a band member but he is a good friend,''
said band director Bob Stiles. ``We just want to remind him that
he's one of us and show our love and concern.''
   Eddie was diagnosed as having bone cancer Dec. 10, a day after
his 17th birthday, Mrs. Mikek said. Before his illness, the high
school junior stayed busy helping at his parents' grocery store and
working a part-time job at a hardware store.
   After the diagnosis, he was able to attend school several days a
week between chemotherapy treatments, Mrs. Mikek said, but
schoolwork had to stop when he came to Chicago for surgery.
   The family had to sell the store, said Mrs. Mikek in a telephone
interview from the Ronald McDonald House, where she stays when she
is visiting Eddie.
   On March 4, doctors at the hospital removed a bone tumor from
Eddie's left leg and implanted part of a femur taken from a
cadaver. They also installed a mechanical knee joint. The
relatively new surgical technique, called limb salvage, avoids
amputation, and should allow Eddie eventually to walk normally,
Mrs. Mikek said.

<TEXT>
   The Nine Mile 2 nuclear power plant, which
began providing power on a permanent basis Friday for the first
time in its troubled existence, automatically shut down Sunday
night when a water pump malfunctioned, a plant official said.
   The $6.3 billion facility, described as the most expensive
nuclear plant ever built in the United States, underwent what
officials term an ``unusual event'' at 5:45 p.m. Sunday.
   Robert Burtch, a spokesman for the Niagara Mohawk Power Corp.,
said the problem occurred when the plant lost its main feed water
pump, which provides water pressure to the reactor.
   ``The plant was operating at 99 percent power,'' Burtch said.
``But when that (the water pump) tripped, the water level in the
reactor dropped and caused the plant to automatically shut down.''
   Burtch said the actual problem was corrected within 15 minutes
and the water in the plant was quickly replenished.
   ``But any time there's an automatic activation of an emergency
cooling system,'' he added, ``we have to activate the emergency
plan.''
   The ``unusual event'' is the lowest emergency classification
that exists for nuclear plants.
   Officials declined to speculate when the plant might return to
full power.
   ``We're looking right now to determine the cause, but obviously
we're not going to start back up until we know what went wrong,''
Burtch said Sunday night. ``We'll know more tomorrow.''
   The 1,080-megawatt plant, which was supposed to have been
completed in 1977 at a cost of $423 million, began providing power
on a permanent basis when plant operators declared it ``on-line''
around 3 p.m. Friday.

   Former president Jimmy Carter is not
picking his favorite candidate in the 1988 presidential race, but
said Sunday that three Democrats have ``an excellent chance'' to
win in November.
   Carter said he would be active in the selection of Democratic
candidates in the party convention in Atlanta, noting there were
``three strong candidates,'' _ Gov. Michael S. Dukakis of
Massachusetts, Sen. Albert Gore Jr., D-Tenn., and the Rev. Jesse L.
Jackson.
   The former president, in Nigeria Sunday to pledge support for a
government health program, did not indicate a preference for one of
the three Democratic candidates.
   ``All three agree with me on what needs to be done,'' said
Carter, referring to American foreign policy.
   ``The Democrats have an excellent chance to win. Ronald Reagan
is popular but his policies are not popular. Two-thirds of the
American people disapprove of aid to the Contras,'' Carter said,
referring to U.S.-backed rebels fighting Nicaragua's government.
   Carter signed an agreement with the government Sunday that
pledged support for a program to eradicate guinea worm in Nigeria
by 1995.
   He was representing Global 2000, a non-profit organization that
is part of Carter Center of Emory University in Atlanta.
   The organization will provide Nigeria assistance in surveying
the country's infested areas, treating contaminated water supplies
and in teaching people how to avoid the disease, he said.
   The guinea worm is a debilitating parasite that thrives in
impure water and affects people in rural areas of Africa and Asia.

<TEXT>
   Amnesty International claims that
Burmese government forces have arbitrarily arrested, tortured and
executed hundreds of unarmed civilians since fighting against
rebels intensified in 1984.
   The London-based organization said that its interviews with more
than 70 refugees and statements from independent investigators have
produced the names of more than 200 victims, most of whom belonged
to minority ethnic tribes including the Karens Kachins, Mons,
Kayahs and Shans.
   In its February newsletter, the human rights organization said
the victims were attacked ``apparently because of their non-violent
political opinions or activities, their ethnic origins or
language.''
   The newsletter was available Monday in Bangkok.
   It said the Burmese government has not responded to several
letters in which Amnesty International expressed its concern.
   A dozen ethnic groups have been fighting the Rangoon government
for decades, saying it has denied them the autonomy they were
entitled to under the terms in which Great Britain granted
independence to Burma in 1948.
   The newsletter said most of the people it blamed for human
rights violations were army troops engaged in counter-insurgency
operations in zones suspected of being under rebel influence.
Members of the Military Intelligence Service, the Special Branch
and the People's Police Force also were implicated, it said.
   ``Eyewitnesses describe numerous instances in which Burmese
troops shot and killed unarmed villagers on suspicion of
association with the insurgent Karen National Union,'' the
newsletter said. ``In many cases people were apparently killed on
the basis of unsubstantiated allegations from informers.''
   ``Other first-hand accounts described summary executions of
Karens, who had been taken by army units either at random or as
punishment for suspected political offenses or sympathies, to work
as porters or guides,'' the report added.

<HEAD>Japanese Government Delays Taking Stand On Panama</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Recent political developments in Panama have put
Japan in the awkward position of having to choose between pleasing
Washington or maintaining good relations with its top Latin
American trading partner.
   Foreign Ministry officials have withheld an official position on
the government installed by military strongman Gen. Manual Antonio
Noriega as Tokyo apparently plays for time, hoping to avoid
aggravating the United States, which regards ousted President Eric
Arturo Delvalle as Panama's legitimate ruler.
   But Japan's considerable commercial interests in Panama give
Tokyo strong incentive to maintain good relations with Noriega's
government.
   Panama is not only a major consumer of Japanese goods, it also
controls the Panama Canal, a vital link for Japanese cars headed
for the eastern United States and agricultural products returning
to Japan.
   On Feb. 25, Delvalle ordered the resignation of Noriega, who is
under indictment in the United States on drug trafficking charges.
The next day, however, the National Assembly, controlled by
Noriega, dismissed Delvalle and appointed Solis Palma as president.
   Last week, the U.S. State Department asked Japanese Counselor
for Political Affairs Ryozo Kato to explain Tokyo's position on
Noriega's government. Assistant Secretary of State Elliott Abrams
in turn explained Washington's opposition to Noriega.
   Foreign Ministry officials in Tokyo say Japan simply has not
decided whether to recognize Palma's government. They refused to
give any indication of when such a decision will be made.
   Rumors that Tokyo had in effect recognized the new government by
sending its ambassador to Palma's inauguration were untrue, said
one ministry official.
   ``The presense of our counselor, instead of the ambassador to
Panama, at Palma's inaugural ceremony is a sign of uncertainty,''
said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``We have
not yet decided.''
   Tokyo may find it difficult to distance itself from Noriega, who
has visited Japan several times in recent years in his capacity as
head of Panama's armed forces.
   Japan has a $3.2 billion trade surplus with Panama, and is
Panama's second-largest trading partner after the United States. In
turn, Panama is Japan's largest export market in Latin America, as
well as the top recipient of Japanese direct investment in the
region.
   Panama absorbed $2.4 billion, or 51 percent, of Japan's private
direct investment in Latin America in 1986 _ one-tenth of all
direct investment by Japanese companies. It received 41 percent of
Japan's $15.6 billion accumulative direct investment in the region
from 1951 to 1985, according to the Foreign Ministry.
   Japanese companies have financed economic development projects,
medical and educational facilities in Panama.
   A Foreign Ministry official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said that aside from a halt to all banking activities, which has
prevented business among Japanese banks operating in Panama, recent
political unrest has had little effect on Japanese commercial
activities in the nation.
   ``So far there is no cause to expect any major problems,'' she
said.
   Since banks can no longer issue letters of credit, ``In Panama,
everyday is Sunday,'' said Masaya Hasebe of the Japan External
Trade Organization (JETRO).
   U.S. lawmakers including Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, who favors a U.S.
trade embargo against Panama, have expressed concern that Tokyo
might follow its economic interests in recognizing Palma's
government.
   D'Amato said a number of legislators hoped to see ``that the
Japanese do not become involved in helping to finance and prop up
this dictator for their own private economic gain.''
   JETRO's Hasebe said Japan probably would ``have to cooperate''
with the United States and reject Noriega's government _ a move
that could have some economic costs.
   ``There are many banks and manufacturers with businesses in
Panama, but no factories,'' Hasebe said. He said some of the
Japanese firms are paper companies set up as tax havens.
   While Tokyo has given no official indication that it would
recognize the government put in place by Noriega, Japan has a clear
interest in ensuring its access to the Panama Canal.
   Japanese ships accounted for 13.1 percent of the 64.5 million
tons of cargo shipped through the canal from the Pacific to the
Atlantic in the 1985 fiscal year ending in September 1986,
including many of its cars destined for markets in the eastern
United States.
   In the same period, Japan accounted for 26.1 million tons, or
35.2 percent of the total 74.2 million tons shipped from Atlantic
to Pacific.
   Japan ships petroleum from Mexico and Venezuela, grain from the
United States and iron ore from Brazil through the canal.
   Hasebe of JETRO said there was little concern that the canal,
which is jointly operated by the United States and Panama, would be
closed to traffic.
   ``All the government can do right now is wait and see, looking
at the future of Panama,'' he said.

<HEAD>Three Missing Zeroes Could Cost Prudential Millions Of Dollars</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prudential Insurance Co. of America may be about
to lose an ally in the case of the missing zeroes, a clerical error
on a financial document that could cost the company tens of
millions of dollars.
   In a case that is the talk of the town among bankruptcy lawyers,
Prudential is trying to establish in court that a mortgage lien it
holds is for $92,885,000.
   The problem is that someone mistakenly left three zeroes off a
form and recorded the lien's value as only $92,885 _ one-tenth of 1
percent as much.
   The lien is on eight huge container ships that belonged to
United States Lines, a giant shipping company whose assets are
being sold off to satisfy creditors in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in
Manhattan.
   United States Lines agreed in principle in January not to
contest Prudential's claims about the value of its lien in return
for payments from Prudential totaling up to $5.45 million.
   But with a hearing to wrap up that agreement scheduled for this
Wednesday before Judge Howard C. Buschman III, United States Lines
seems to be on the verge of demanding a larger payment from
Prudential _ and possibly challenging the lien's validity if
Prudential doesn't go along.
   Because Prudential holds a first preferred ship mortgage
stemming from a $160 milion loan to United States Lines made in
1978, it can collect all the money raised from the sale of the
eight ships, up to the amount of its lien.
   A lawyer for United States Lines last week refused to say
whether the company planned to oppose Prudential over the missing
zeroes, but made it clear he feels the shipping company has
leverage over the insurer.
   ``We believe we're on sound ground that the mortgage can be
avoided for the benefit of all U.S. Line's creditors,'' said Alan
Kornberg, a lawyer for Milbank Tweed Hadley & McCloy.
   The sale of the first five of the Lancer-class ships earlier
this month brought in $44.1 million, nearly triple what was
expected, and other creditors are clamoring that United States
Lines deserves a payment from Prudential of more than $5.45 million.
   Judy Liu, an attorney for Prudential's law firm, Weil Gotshal &
Manges, declined to comment.
   Lawyers in the case clearly have little sympathy for
Prudential's argument that the dropped zeroes amount to nothing
more than a harmless mistake.
   ``The Federal Ship Mortgage Act is a notice statute that has
very strict reporting requirements,'' said Sandy Mayerson, a lawyer
at Kelley Drye & Warren representing General Electric Capital
Corp., which shares a second mortgage on the ships.
   ``My client actually lent $57 million to the debtor, so anything
it does to try to obtain the repayment of that is certainly to be
expected,'' she said.
   Prudential says the lien was improperly recorded by someone at
the law firm of Haight, Gardner, Poor and Havens. It says if its
lien is not upheld it may file malpractice suits against Haight,
Gardner and its overall outside counsel on the transaction, Dewey,
Ballantine, Bushby, Palmer and Wood.
   Attorneys for those firms have declined comment on the
malpractice matter.

<HEAD>Firestone Delays Negotiating Session with Pirelli</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AKRON, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of Firestone Tire & Rubber Co. says
he will not meet with the chairman of Italian tiremaker Pirelli
until Firestone consults its advisers on Pirelli's $1.9 billion
buyout offer, according to a report published Sunday.
   John J. Nevin, Firestone chairman and chief executive officer,
informed Pirelli chairman Leopoldo Pirelli by letter Saturday that
Firestone's board needed to examine the offer more closely, the
Akron Beacon Journal reported.
   Nevin was replying to two letters he received from Pirelli last
week asking for negotiations on the Italian company's offer to
acquire Firestone for $58 a share.
   ``I appreciate the invitations to meet with you that were
included in your letters,'' Nevin responded.
   ``It would, however, in my opinion, be inappropriate for me to
meet with you before I have had the opportunity to obtain the
advice and counsel of our board and any directions or instructions
that the board may deem it appropriate to give to me,'' he wrote.
   Nevin also said Firestone, with the help of outside financial
and legal advisers, is compiling background information on Pirelli
for use in reviewing the offer.
   Firestone has until Friday to respond to Pirelli's bid.
Firestone already has said it planned to sell 75 percent of its
tire business to Bridgestone Corp. of Japan for $1.2 billion.

<HEAD>Japanese Chip Shortage Hits U.S. Computer Industry</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A shortage of Japanese computer chips is
rattling the domestic computer industry, with prices of some
important memory chips doubling in the past year, according to a
published report.
   The San Francisco Examiner reported in its Sunday editions that
chips selling under contract for $2.15 a year ago now are in short
supply, and their prices have shot up to the $5 range. Some
companies are buying chips on the spot market at even higher prices
to get extra supplies.
   ``The price of chips is out of hand,'' said Jim Cavuto, editor
of an industry newsletter, Micro Publishing Report. ``Chips are the
fuel of the computer industry. It keeps us running and there should
be an unlimited supply.''
   Some industry observers trace the problem to a 1986
semiconductor trade agreement between the United States and Japan.
The accord set up fair market value prices for semiconductors, such
as essential memory chips used in computers. It banned
third-country dumping and the Japanese agreed to open up their
economy more to American products.
   But at the time, most U.S. companies had dropped out of the
memory chip business completely.
   Only two companies, Texas Instruments of Dallas, and Micron
Technology of Boise, Idaho, still make dynamic random access memory
chips, or D-RAMs, an essential memory chip for semiconductors.
Japan has 90 percent of the D-RAM market, according to the San Jose
market research company, Dataquest Inc.
   ``We send our procurement people to Japan all the time and use
every bit of leverage we can bring to bear to make sure we're
getting our share,'' said John Young, president of Hewlett-Packard
Co.
   Semiconductor makers in Japan deny they deliberately are
short-changing U.S. customers. They say the time-consuming
conversion of factories to develop D-RAMs instead of 256 kilobit
chips and increased demand have caused the chip shortage.
   ``They (Japanese suppliers) have to wait and see to avoid
oversupply and charges of dumping,'' said Michihiro Inoue of
Matsushita Electrical Co. in Osaka. ``It takes time to put a new
production system into orbit.''
   Inoue predicted Japanese companies would catch up with chip
demand later this year.

<HEAD>Top USX Execs Receive Substantial Bonuses</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   USX Corp. Chairman David Roderick received a
$600,000 bonus last year in addition to his $763,982 salary and
other top executives also received substantial bonuses, according
to the oil and steel giant's annual proxy statement.
   The 1987 bonuses came as USX significantly improved its
financial performance, posting a profit of $219 million in 1987
after losing $1.83 billion in 1986.
   USX bonuses are set individually by the board of directors'
six-member compensation committee, based on the total amount of
incentive compensation available as determined by the entire board.
   Roderick's bonus was his highest ever, said USX spokesman
William Ryder. Roderick's last disclosed bonus was $275,000 in 1985.
   USX did not report any incentive compensation for its top
executives in 1986. That means it either did not pay bonuses or
awarded bonuses worth less than $25,000, which need not be
disclosed, Ryder said.
   Hourly workers at USX will receive extra compensation this year
under a profit-sharing plan. USX said in January it would pay about
$28 million, or an average of $1,700 apiece, to its steelworkers
under the plan.
   Those payments were triggered by a formula based on the stock
prices of USX's competitors.
   Other top USX executives and their 1987 earnings include:
   _Charles A. Corry, president of the diversified businesses and
recently named president of USX, who received salary of $301,020
and a $245,000 bonus.
   _Thomas C. Graham, president of USS, USX's steelmaking division,
who made salary of $478,600 and received a $275,000 bonus.
   _William E. Swales, president of USX's Marathon Oil Co.
subsidiary, who received salary of $446,768 and a $325,000 bonus.
   _W. Bruce Thomas, chief financial officer, who received salary
of $449,814 and a $275,000 bonus.
   Federal securities laws require companies to disclose
compensation for their highest-ranking officers.

<HEAD>American Standard Says Considering New $75-Per-Share Offer</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By THOMAS GINSBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Standard Inc. said Sunday it was in
discussions regarding a cash buyout of more than $75 a share, or
about $2.35 billion, and its board of directors expected to
consider definitive bids at a Wednesday meeting.
   American Standard also indicated it would drop its ``poison
pill'' anti-takeover plan if more than 50 percent of the company's
shares were bought under a formal tender offer.
   Black & Decker Corp., which has offered $73 per share, or about
$2.27 billion in cash for American Standard, has sought removal of
the poison pill and demanded more financial information since
launching its hostile takeover attempt in February.
   ``Black & Decker has been provided with the same information as
that provided to other potential bidders and has been invited to
meet with management and submit its own bid,'' American Standard
said in a statement issued from its New York headquarters.
   Black & Decker's lawyers were expecting the information on
Sunday and the company likely would have no statement before
deciding whether to sweeten its outstanding offer, spokeswoman
Barbara Lucas said.
   American Standard rose $1 to $73.25 a share Friday on the New
York Stock Exchange. Black & Decker dipped 25 cents to $17.37{.
   George McGrath, a spokesman for American Standard, said an offer
of more than $75 a share would top Black & Decker's current offer
and would relegates American Standard's own defensive
recapitalization plan _ which would pay shareholders a package of
cash and securities valued at about $71 a share _ to a back burner.
   McGrath declined to give other information about third-party
offers or to disclose how many bidders were involved in discussions
with American Standard, a plumbing and air conditioning
manufacturing company.
   ``This ($75 bid) emerged from the discussions,'' he said.
   While noting there was no assurance the $75 bid would be
accepted, American Standard cited the new developments in saying it
would drop its poison pill, which makes a takeover prohibitively
expensive by requiring the surviving company to buy back
shareholders' stock at half of market value.
   ``Noboby could have done it with the poison pill,'' Mrs. Lucas
said.
   American Standard has fought Black & Decker's bid for months,
rejecting its overtures, developing the recapitalization plan to
thwart the takeover and winning a court battle validating its
poison pill.
   Black & Decker, the Towson, Md.-based tool and appliance maker,
initially offered a buyout at $65 a share, later sweetening it to
$68 and finally to $73.

   Their confidence undermined by the collapse of
their favorite stocks last October, to say nothing about the
destruction of pet theories, some analysts are reaching into
history for guidance.
   And those who do so have a tendency to remain bearish.
   The reason for this isn't difficult to discern, because a
retracing of prior declines, such as in 1929, isn't unusual for
subsequent rallies. Often, however, those rallies lead only to
further collapses.
   At its post-crash high of 2,072 points a week ago, the Dow Jones
industrial average had risen more than 320 points, or 20 percent,
from its Oct. 19 bottom of 1,738.
   The comparison with 1929 is as hard to avoid as it is painful to
recall.
   Four-and-a-half months after the debacle of October 1929 the
industrial average had recovered 43 percent of its late 1929
decline, and a bit more than one month later it reached its high
for 1930.
   But, Wright Investors' Service reminds us, ``within seven months
all of that recovery was lost, and the downward spiral which would
last until July 1932 was resumed.''
   While the year 1929 is imprinted on every schoolkid's mind, the
further collapse from early 1930 to mid-1932 was several times
larger, and at some points along the way the descent was just as
precipitous.
   But history can also be a treacherous guide; while it teaches,
it can deceive, too. The years 1929 and 1987 have certain
similarities, especially in regard to economic excesses, but the
differences are probably more numerous.
   To begin with, the economy currently shows few signs of
collapse, even in spite of some enormous and unpredictable excesses
in matters such as budget deficits, credit extension and trade
balances.
   Wright and others point out that today's economy is still
creating jobs at a strong level, the service sector is growing,
manufacturing has been gaining strength, and after years of decline
the nation's exports are increasing.
   There are few signs of recession. The Conference Board economic
model released today shows gross national product rising only 2.1
percent this year, compared with 2.9 percent in 1987. That's anemic
to be sure, but still growth.
   Albert T. Sommers, economic adviser at the board _ an
independent group supported largely by business _ says the economy
has simply entered an inevitable retrenchment, ``but does not seem
poised for a recession.''
   In the market itself there are signs of heightened activity,
especially regarding stocks of companies that are takeover targets.
Merger mania has gripped the marketplace once more, and some of the
premiums offered for companies seem beyond reason.
   Less obvious, however, have been areas of underpricing in the
market. Business Week magazine calls the over-the-counter market,
where many smaller companies are traded, a bargain-hunter's
paradise for undervalued shares.
   These stocks, some of which could be tomorrow's blue chips,
failed to rise to the sky during the industrial average's long
ascent. Moreover, they fell more sharply than blue chips during the
October collapse.
   Now, many of these stocks are selling far below their net cash
value and so have begun attracting the interest of what Wright
suggests are rather sensible investors. It might, says John Wright,
be a good sign for the entire market.
   While conceding that such activity might not continue, it
suggests to him that for the moment, at least, ``rational investors
are regaining some control of the market.''
