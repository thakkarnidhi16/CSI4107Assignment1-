   A shark named ``megamouth'' with lips
that glow in the dark washed ashore off the coast of Western
Australia, and scientists said it was only the third time such a
specimen has been found.
   ``In this day and age, it is quite a remarkable find,'' Dr.
Gerald Allen of the Fish Department of the Western Australia Museum
said Friday. ``Something like this doesn't happen every day.''
   The fish, which measured 16 feet and looks like a cross between
a whale and a shark, swam ashore on Wednesday near the resort town
of Mandurah. Locals pushed it back to sea, but it beached itself
again and died.
   Allen said only two other specimens had been found. He said a
megamouth _ as researchers call the shark _ was first discovered in
1976 off Hawaii. A second specimen was caught in 1984 off the coast
of Southern California.
   ``It's the first time a megamouth has been found in the Southern
Hemisphere,'' Allen said in a telephone interview with The
Associated Press.
   Allen said the fish lives at depths of 660 feet to 3,300 feet
and has bioluminescent lips that glow in the dark to attract
jellyfish, plankton, shrimp and other food.
   ``We don't know very much about it other than that it swims at
great depths apparently with its mouth open, filtering food,'' said
Allen. He said the megamouth has a bulbous head with a mouth
measuring 2{ feet across and tiny teeth.
   ``It's definitely a shark and it is not prehistoric,'' Allen
said.
   Allen also noted that the megamouth, weighing about 1,500
pounds, feels very flabby.
   ``It's sort of like jelly,'' he said. ``That is because it
doesn't need strong muscles or a hard skeleton for the sort of
environment in which it lives.''
   He said the museum planned to display the megamouth.

   A man tossed a tear gas canister onto the
crowded dance floor of a teen-age nightclub Friday night, causing
dozens of injuries and prompting authorities to evacuate the club
and a restaurant.
   A total of 24 people were treated for nausea and skin and eye
irritations at area hospitals. Forty-five others were treated at
the scene for the same symptoms after the 10:30 p.m. incident, said
District Fire Chief Harry Tibbetts.
   Witnesses said a man was seen fleeing the club after throwing
the military-type tear gas grenade. Police had no suspects.
   ``The effects will probably be short-lived and minor on most of
them with mainly copious amounts nausea, vomiting and skin
irritation,'' said Tibbetts.
   The incident occurred at The Bar Down Under, which police
described as a non-alcoholic club for teen-agers in the basement of
Union Station, a popular restaurant and shopping complex in the
renovated train station.
   A total of 200-300 people were evacuated from the club and a
restaurant above it, police said.
   ``All of a sudden the smoke started coming in there and started
burning. The people were pushing and pulling everybody, trying to
get out,'' an unidentified witness told television station WRTV.
   ``The smoke was so thick it made people sick,'' said Patrolman
Mike Brown.

<HEAD>Union Head Hails Court Ruling on Hiring Test</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of a federal employees union says a
federal appeals court ruling will force the Reagan administration
to replace a civil service test that was found to discriminate
against minorities.
   The Office of Personnel Management ``can no longer ignore their
obligation to develop an alternative system,'' National Treasury
Employees Union President Robert Tobias said Friday following the
ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals.
   The three-judged panel ruled that OPM acted ``arbitrarily and
capriciously'' in not providing figures to back its claim that high
costs rule out developing a new test for filling entry-level jobs.
   Because the old test was found to be biased earlier in the
long-running court dispute, the agency has been using a
non-competitive hiring system based on grades and performance in
interviews. OPM spokesman Dick McGowan said the agency would have
no comment on the ruling.

<HEAD>Recall Ordered for More Than 22,000 Trucks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 22,000 heavy trucks are being
recalled because of potential defects in power steering gears that
could result in ``sudden and catastrophic failure,'' the National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration says.
   The TRW Ross Gear division, which produced the steering gears,
and manufacturers of Peterbilt, Kenworth, Freightliner, Western
Star and White GMC trucks, urged that affected trucks be removed
from highways immediately and towed to the nearest truck dealer,
the agency said Friday.
   The recall affects 22,687 trucks carrying certain steering gears
manufactured by TRW Ross Gear division since last March. The safety
agency said TRW has confirmed seven incidents of steering gear
failure since June.
   The agency said the suspect equipment includes certain TRW Ross
Gear division TAS-65 truck steering gears sold for production and a
limited number of TAS-65, TAS-40 and TAS-55 gears sold as
prototypes. The TAS-65 gears have date codes of 085-88 or higher
and were shipped after March 24.

<HEAD>Court Asked to Block Lawn Darts Sales</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal commission says Sears Roebuck and
Co. has continued to sell lawn darts in violation of a promise to
stop marketing the allegedly hazardous game.
   The Consumer Products Safety Commission filed suit Friday in
U.S. District Court here, asking that Sears be found in contempt
and be ordered to halt sales of the horseshoes-like game in which
darts are thrown at targets on the ground.
   ``I'm disappointed at Sears for this new violation but expect
this contempt action will send a strong message to Sears and other
retailers that the CPSC will enforce its regulations on lawn
darts,'' said Commission Chairman Terrence M. Scanlon.
   Sears headquarters in Chicago said in a statement: ``We received
the motion today from the CPSC and we are in the process of
reviewing it.'' The company signed a consent agreement in March
under which the sales would stop but commission investigators said
the darts still were being sold in Puerto Rico.

   Firefighters struggled Friday to encircle a
27,000-acre forest fire that had destroyed 10 houses, forced
evacuations and killed cattle in rugged terrain before wind steered
flames away from other houses.
   The leading edge of the 10-day-old Warm Springs Creek fire moved
out of the Elkhorn Mountains toward the small town of Winston,
about 15 miles southeast of Helena. But that area of flames did not
threaten houses or other building, and no more evacuations were
expected, said Art Howell of the Inter-agency Fire Dispatch Center.
   ``There's no more homes in the way,'' he said Friday. ``But that
depends a lot on the weather and the wind's a big factor.''
   A weather inversion trapped cooler air, smoke and flames in the
lower valleys throughout most of the day and kept the 27,000-acre
fire's growth to only 600 acres, said Anne Jeffery, fire
information officer.
   Elsewhere, a helicopter involved in firefighting efforts in
Wyoming's Bighorn National Forest crashed Friday, killing one
person and injuring three others. Firefighters also battled fires
in California, Idaho and Utah.
   The Warm Springs Creek fire grew by 7,000 acres Thursday night,
despite the efforts of 1,700 heavily equipped firefighters. But on
two fronts, the fire took turns that could help suppress it, said
fire information officer Bob Krepps.
   He said westerly wind at about 20 mph late Thursday ``pushed the
fire back into itself'' on its western border, depriving it of new
fuel and lifting a threat to about 500 residents of the Saddle
Mountain subdivision.
   At the fire's eastern edge Friday, flames moved out of forested
high country and onto grassland. ``That's a real benefit to us
also,'' Krepps said, because of the lighter fuel.
   In addition, its movement took it out of rough, inaccessible
terrain into gentler ground where firefighters could work more
easily, said Jerry Adelblue of the Helena National Forest.
   Barring a return of strong, shifting winds, he said,
firefighters should have ``just another day at the office out
there.''
   Although no new evacuations were expected, Broadwater County
Sheriff Rich Thompson said Winston-area residents were on the
alert. ``Everybody's aware of what's going on,'' he said. ``If it
comes down that mountain, they'll have to get out.''
   At least three Air National Guard transport planes, modified to
drop fire retardant, were brought in from Wyoming and California on
Friday and were expected to begin flights Saturday, said Krepps.
   Erratic wind late Wednesday and and early Thursday had caused
the fire to quadruple in size, destroying 10 homes and cabins
scattered in the mountains. One cabin owner lost 30 head of cattle.
   About 40 people remained out of their homes Friday while fire
crews backed by bulldozers shored up lines along the north, east
and west sides of the fire.
   Adelblue said the fire was about 30 percent contained.
   About 35 miles north of Helena, fire crews were expected to
finish mop-up work on a 110-acre grass fire that initially
threatened summer homes near Wolf Creek.
   In southeastern Montana, about 1,000 firefighters began
disbanding Friday after tightening a noose around three fires that
had burned 13,600 acres of scattered timber and grass near Lame
Deer.
   In north-central Montana, 980 firefighters attacked the
4,500-acre Lost Canyon fire on the Rocky Boys Indian Reservation.
It was about half contained by fire lines, said fire information
officer Chris Comstock.
   Comstock said the fire moved farther into thick timber and was
not threatening any buildings. ``I think we're past that point,''
he said.
   About 60 smaller lightning-caused fires burned Friday in the
Flathead River drainage of northwestern Montana.
   Elsewhere, officials had few details about the helicopter crash
in the Cloud Peak Wilderness Area, southwest of Sheridan, Wyo., in
the Bighorn National Forest, said Larry Thoney, a member of the
forest's recreation lands staff.
   Forest spokesman Harvalou Buchanan said the helicopter was
privately owned. The affiliations of the people inside were unknown
and their names were being withheld.
   Wind had pushed the Lost fire in the Bighorn forest past fire
lines and it had charred 5,400 acres, approaching within a mile of
a ranch and summer homes on its northern edge. A wind shift later,
however, helped firefighters, pushing the fire to the west, away
from the area.
   Wind gusting to 30 and 35 mph hampered firefighters in
Yellowstone National Park, and park officials closed a road from
Grant Village to Lewis Lake again Friday because trees that had
been left unburned earlier by the Shoshone fire ignited, sending
flames into the road.
   Elsewhere in Yellowstone, wind pushed the North Fork fire to
cover about 74,000 acres, a growth of 5,000 acres from reports
Thursday. The Norris Junction and Madison Junction campgrounds were
closed while firefighters worked to protect buildings in Norris
Junction from the fire 3 to 4 miles south.
   In southern California, an arson brush fire in the San Jacinto
Mountains grew to 1,073 acres Friday, a fire spokesman said. The
fire, between Barker and Cabazon peaks and on part of the Morongo
Indian Reservation, was expected to be controlled during the night,
said Tim Spann of the state Department of Forestry and Fire.
   Firefighters in southwest Utah contained an 580-acre brush fire,
believed to be man-caused, that burned about 20 miles northwest of
St. George. Firefighters also controlled a 600-acre blaze in
northern Utah.
   Firefighters in Idaho's Challis National Forest squelched a
nearly 14,000-acre fire and were being sent elsewhere.

Disaster</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Vincennes Report, Bjt</HEAD>

   An Iranian official rejected U.S. claims
that his country was partly responsible for the U.S. Navy's downing
of an Iranian jetliner, and he said the Navy's presence in the
Persian Gulf was to blame.
   ``Our civil airliner was using an internationally recognized air
corridor, used five times a week by the same captain,'' Iranian
Ambassador Mohammad Ja'afar Mahallati said Friday.
   During a naval skirmish with Iranian gunboats, the crew of the
USS Vincennes misinterpreted radar and electronic signals from the
civilian airliner and shot it down July 3, killing all 290 people
aboard.
   Conclusions of a U.S. Defense Department investigation released
Friday blamed human error by the crew, but Defense Secretary Frank
C. Carlucci said Iran bore a heavy responsibility for letting the
plane fly over a battle.
   The report said several of the crew's assumptions about the
approaching flight were wrong, including that it was descending
toward the Vincennes and was flying off course.
   Of the crew's mistaken beliefs, which the Defense Department
released immediately after the disaster, Mahallati said:
   ``In the view of the American administration, when such
incidents take place at the price of the lives of 290 people, first
you cannot provide the American people with facts; it is better to
forge information, to misinform them than to keep quiet and wait
until the facts come out.''
   The Iranian envoy laid the blame on the U.S. Navy's presence in
the gulf.
   ``One should conclude that the mere presence of such highly
dangerous equipment, which cannot be controlled even by trained
American personnel, is the source of tension,'' he said. ``By
itself it can cause miseries, one ofter the other.''
   He called for the U.S. fleet to pull out of the gulf, saying the
cease-fire between Iran and Iraq that started today makes it
unnecessary.
   Mahallati also called on the United States to pay reparations to
Iran for the loss of the plane and its passengers and crew and to
issue a formal apology.
   President Reagan sent America's regrets and the United States
accepted responsibility for shooting down the plane. But the United
States blames Iran for sending the flight over a combat zone and
has not apologized.
   Reagan has approved the payment of damages directly to the
families of the victims, but not reparations to Iran, or any
payment that Tehran's government would receive.

   The world's top warblers are puckering
up for tunes ranging from Tchaikovsky to Led Zeppelin at the 11th
annual International Whistle-Off this weekend.
   ``I don't want to sound boastful, but I think it's a God-given
gift,'' said contestant Patty Ediger of Dayton, Ore. ``I think
maybe the shape of a person's mouth and his teeth have something to
do with it she practices two to three hours a day in the
months preceding the Whistle-Off. ``I go up to the wee hours of the
morning,'' she said. ``It takes a lot of time if you want to be
good.''
   ``Whistling as an art ranks very high in comparison with other
musical arts,'' said Chamber of Commerce spokeswoman Jean Stokke.
``These are serious musicians and they're very competitive.''
   Thirty people were competing in four divisions today and Sunday
in what is billed as the nation's premier whistling event.
   Whistlers from 15 states, Canada and Mexico compete for a
round-trip flight to Mexico or the Caribbean. The prize will go to
the event's grand champion, with trophies going to the top three in
each division.
   Among the whistlers are former three-time grand champion Roy
Thoreson of Calgary, Alberta, and former two-time grand champion
Nancy Foran of Yakima, Wash.
   Other contestants include Michael Sherman of San Jose, Calif.,
who will perform Led Zeppelin's ``Stairway to Heaven'' in the
novelty division, and William Reichard of Ashland, Ore., who will
perform an abbreviated version of Tchaikovsky's Symphony No. 5 in
the solo classical division.
   Time limits are set to ``keep the event moving,'' Ms. Stokke
said. Each contestant must whistle three to six minutes for each
performance, except in the solo classical division, where four to
eight minutes are allowed.
   Whistlers can compete in as many as three of the four divisions:
solo classical, solo popular, novelty and duets. Judges score them
from 1 to 5 for artistry, interpretation and performance.
   ``You never know what to expect at this thing,'' Ms. Stokke
said. ``Last year, a guy wore a space suit and whistled the theme
from ``2001: A Space Odyssey.''
   Past performers also have offered a medley from the Rolling
Stones and the rousing music of George M. Cohan.
   Contestants were to meet in preliminary rounds today, with the
top four in each category advancing to Sunday's finals. Those who
succeed today can't repeat the same tune Sunday.
   About 5,000 people are expected to attend the Whistle-Off.
There's no admission charge.
   Ms. Stokke said the event has ``really caught on.''
   ``We're finding that there are many people interested in
whistling and many whistlers who have not had a stage prior to this
time.''

   Guerrillas fighting Angola's Marxist
government claimed they killed 42 Angolan government troops this
week.
   UNITA, which sta Total Independence of
Angola, said Friday in a statement released in the Portuguese
capital that its forces killed eight Angolan soldiers in central
Bie province Aug. 14.
   The statement said its fighters killed 19 Angolan soldiers in
southern Huila province Aug. 16, and another 15 in northern Kuanza
North province the same day.
   There was no independent confirmation of the report by UNITA,
which is backed by the United States and South Africa. The reported
fighting occurred despite a cease-fire declared by Angola, Cuba and
South Africa. UNITA is not a party to the talks that led to the
truce.
   On Aug. 12, UNITA said it had killed 42 Angolan soldiers during
the week beginning Aug. 8, when the cease-fire went into effect in
the southern African nation.
   Cuba maintains an estimated 50,000 troops in Angola in support
of President Jose Eduardo dos Santos. Both South Africa and the
United States have justified their support of UNITA on the Cuban
presence.
   UNITA was not involved in U.S.-mediated southern African peace
talks, which are aimed at ending 13 years of civil war in Angola
and securing independence for South African-controlled South-West
Africa, also known as Namibia.
   The sixth round of talks is scheduled to open Wednesday in
Brazzaville, Congo.
   The Angolan government has said it will not negotiate with
UNITA, which seeks to share power in the African nation following
its failure to gain control of the government upon independence
from Portugal in 1975.
   But chief U.S. mediator Chester Crocker has said a final
agreement for the region cannot be reached without an internal
political settlement in Angola.

<HEAD>Budget Red Ink Surged to $22.9 Billion Last Month</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal budget deficit climbed by $22.9
billion last month after posting a rare surplus in June, the
Treasury Department said.
   The new batch of red ink brought the deficit for the first 10
months of the fiscal year that began Oct. 1 to $142.0 billion, only
slightly less than the amount for the same period last year.
   Government ledger books were in the black with a $9.3 billion
surplus for June, mainly as a result of quarterly tax payments by
businesses and individuals.
   But the Reagan administration is projecting the deficit for the
fiscal year that ends Sept. 30 at $152.3 billion. That is above the
administration's $146.7 billion deficit estimate in February but
below the $157 billion forecast by the Congressional Budget Office
at the beginning of the year.
   The CBO revised its figures Friday, however, to project a $155
billion deficit. James L. Blum, acting director of the
congressional agency, said stronger economic growth than expected
for the first half was responsible.
   The CBO is not expecting across-the-board spending cuts to be
triggered this month by a law calling for a balanced budget by
1993, Blum said.
   He said CBO projections indicate there is no way the budget
could be balanced by 1993 in the absence of further policy changes,
such as spending cuts or tax increases. The agency, in fact,
projects a $121 billion deficit in 1993 if present policies are
unchanged.
   Surprising economic growth, which has boosted government
revenues and lowered government spending for such programs as
unemployment benefits, has been credited with reducing the deficit
this year.
   Many economists believe the deficit will rise again in the
fiscal year beginning. Oct. 1. The administration, however,
predicts it will drop to $140.1 billion in 1989, when figured
according to guidelines contained in the Gramm-Rudman deficit
reduction law.
   Last month's deficit was 2.7 percent higher than the imbalance
in July a year ago.
   Government spending in July actually dropped 6.9 percent when
compared to June. Spending fell to $83.6 billion but tax receipts
dropped even more sharply, falling by 38.8 percent to $60.7 billion.
   Tax receipts for the first 10 months of the fiscal year were up
5.7 percent to $741.7 billion while spending is up 4.6 percent to
$883.7 billion.
   As usual, the largest spending categories were the military,
Social Security and other programs in the Department of Health and
Human Services, and interest on the national debt.
   Military spending totaled $23.9 billion in July and $237.1
billion in the first 10 months of this fiscal year, up 3.3 percent
from the same period last year.
   Social Security payments totaled $17.2 billion in July and $178
billion so far this budget year, an increase of 5.8 percent.
Spending for other HHS programs amounted to $12.0 billion last
month and $130.8 billion this budget year, up 3.3 percent.
   Interest payments on the $2.6 trillion national debt cost $14.5
billion in July and $183.6 billion so far this year.

   The third positive development for
the space shuttle program in 10 days _ sealing a fuel line leak _
could lead NASA to announce a launch date soon for Discovery on the
first post-Challenger flight.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has been
aiming for a late September or early October liftoff and hopes to
be able to establish the date by late next week for the
often-delayed mission.
   Technicians bolted a clamshell-like device over the leak in a
Discovery fuel line Friday and filled it with a sealing compound.
   A subsequent pressure test showed no additional leakage, but
officials said they planned to monitor it for a few days. The leak
of nitrogen tetroxide was detected July 14.
   Officials originally thought they would have to move Discovery
off the launch pad and back to a hangar for repair, a move that
could have delayed the flight by as much as two months. But
engineers decided to cut holes in the rear wall of the shuttle's
cargo bay to gain access to the leak.
   The holes were cut Wednesday, and the technicians finished the
job Friday.
   The work was delayed until after the launch pad test firing of
Discovery's three liquid fuel main engines. That critical test,
which certified the engines for flight, was conducted successfully
Aug. 10.
   Another milestone was passed Thursday, when an intentionally
flawed solid fuel booster rocket was test-fired for two minutes at
the Morton Thiokol plant in Utah.
   Officials said that while initial test results looked excellent,
it would be several days before all the data were analyzed.
   The test-firing was the fifth and final prelaunch test for the
redesigned booster, two of which are already attached to Discovery
on the launch pad.
   A faulty joint in one of Challenger's two boosters triggered the
explosion that destroyed the shuttle and killed its seven-member
crew on Jan. 28, 1986.
   Meanwhile, engineers here continued to try to learn why a small
amount of hydrogen leaked during the main engine test. It was
detected in an area where electrical and fuel lines join the
shuttle with its external fuel tank.
   The leak disappeared quickly and was not considered a flight
safety hazard, but officials said they would like to understand why
it happened. They expect to have test results next week.

   Delegates from North Korea and South
Korea deadlocked today on peace measures and on sharing the
Olympics during a second round of talks, and each side blamed the
other for lack of progress.
   Neither side budged from their positions during today's session
at the truce site in the Demilitarized Zone separating the nations.
The communist North insisted on being a co-host at the Olympics.
The South said it was impossible.
   They did agree to meet again Monday.
   ``South Korea was insincere throughout the meeting,'' the
North's chief delegate, Chon Kum Chol, told a press conference.
   The chief South Korean delegate, Park Joon-kyu, said any hope of
progress depended on the North being more flexible.
   Park called on the North to give up its demand to be a co-host
at the Olympics and simply agree to participate in the Games, which
start in Seoul on Sept. 17.
   ``I still think the chance of North Korea participating in the
Seoul Games is one in a thousand,'' Park told reporters.
   The twp five-member teams met in the South Korean pavilion. On
Friday, they met in the North Korean building. They shook hands and
smiled at the start of the talks, but the mood was guarded.
   The two Koreas, technically still at war, are archenemies with
hundreds of thousands of troops poised along the 150-mile border.
   The main purpose of the talks was to arrange a full-scale
North-South Parliamentary session, but the two sides disagree on
what that session should involve.
   South Korean delegates continued to insist on small delegations
for Parliamentary talks instead of participation of the full
legislatures of both sides as demanded by the North. The South said
the North's plan is unworkable.
   The South said it would drop its demand for a presidential
summit to be discussed. North Korea wants the meeting to urgently
address drawing up a non-aggression pact and its demand to be a
co-host at the Olympics.
   The North Korean delegates were drawn from the rubber-stamp
Supreme Peoples' Assembly. The South Korean delegation consisted of
two government National Assembly lawmakers and a legislator from
each of the three main opposition parties.
   The North is demanding to be a co-host at the Olympics to stave
off a major political defeat. Both sides claim to be the sole
legitimate government of Korea. The South sees its selection to
hold the Olympics as international recognition of its claim.
   The International Olympic Committee says North Korea cannot
share the Games because they are awarded to a single city. South
Korean authorities fear the North may use terrorism to try to
disrupt the Olympics.
   Previous, sporadic talks between the two sides since the early
1970s failed to make progress. The last talks collapsed in January
1986 when North Korea pulled out to protest annual South
Korean-U.S. military exercises.
   The Korean Peninsula was divided in 1945 by Soviet and U.S.
forces that ended the Japanese occupation at the end of World War
II. North Korea invaded the South in 1950 to start the Korean War,
which ended in stalemate in 1953 without a peace treaty being
signed.
   The South has evolved into a major economic power and started to
move toward full democracy, while the North has remained one of the
most isolated nations in the world.

<HEAD>City Should Benefit From GOP Convention For 20 Years</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDA ASHTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Louisiana, looking to burnish its image,
should reap benefits for many years from the exposure its prize
city received while hosting the Republican National Convention,
some of New Orleans' major boosters say.
   ``New Orleans has never looked better; Louisiana has never
looked brighter,'' said Jim Bob Moffett, head of the Fortune 500
company Freeport-McMoRan and a key convention fund-raiser.
   The city rolled out its plushest red carpet for the GOP
visitors, with sumptuous parties, tasty native cuisine, riverboat
rides and Gov. Buddy Roemer reminding everyone Louisiana was
polishing a tarnished image.
   ``Sooner or later, the message was going to come across that New
Orleans is not strictly a party town or a place for good food and
music,'' said David Jones, president of the New Orleans Chamber of
Commerce. ``We are starting to do the right things to make this a
viable economic center.''
   ``It will probably have gains for Louisiana for the next 20
years,'' said Mervin Trail, a New Orleans businessman and another
key fund-raiser.
   Complaints were few during the four-day convention that ended
Thursday.
   But then, New Orleans handles Mardi Gras every year with 20
times as many visitors and a different kind of crowd, police said.
   ``At Mardi Gras ... it's a party crowd and there are a few more
untoward incidents,'' said New Orleans police Capt. John Hughes.
``It was very good as far as we're concerned.''
   Suffocating humidity and 90-degree temperatures also made it too
hot to misbehave, Hughes said.
   The subtropical weather and the sound system at the giant
Louisiana Superdome drew most of the complaints.
   Technicians began adjusting the system after Sen. Barry
Goldwater, the GOP's 1964 presidential nominee, said he couldn't
hear a word of President Reagan's farewell speech Monday.
   The complaints diminished during the week, but they didn't go
away.
   ``It is not the Superdome system,'' said dome manager Bob
Johnson, explaining that the Republicans installed their own.
   Some of the more conservative delegates were not charmed by New
Orleans' tolerance for the weird, the drunken and the sexy.
   ``Now that we have visited Sodom, where is Gomorrah?'' one
Washington state delegate was reported asking.
   But others were seduced by the city's history, its laid-back
attitudes and the mighty Mississippi River.
   ``Our goal was to put together one of the most successful
conventions in history,'' said Jones.
   Lt. Gov. Paul Hardy said he was hard pressed to find anyone who
wasn't enamored of the French Quarter, the streetcars and the
oak-lined avenues.
   ``I don't believe that we could have spent $1 billion in
advertising and reaped the benefits equal to the fantastic free
press, the free media, we are receiving,'' Hardy said.
``Fortunately, we've been given the opportunity to redeem ourselves
after the world's fair fiasco.''
   The 1984 World Exposition here was a delight for those who
attended but a financial disaster because so many people stayed
away.
   The state's image also has suffered because of the slump in
Louisiana's energy-based economy and its history of shady politics.
   Louisiana's jobless rate has been No. 1 or No. 2 in the country
the last three years. The state's storied corruption spans from the
legendary Huey P. Long _ whose life was chronicled in fictionalized
form in the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel ``All the King's Men'' _
to Roemer's predecessor, Edwin Edwards, who spent much of his third
term successfully defending himself against federal racketeering
charges.
   Hardy said the city already is looking forward to hosting the
Republicans, the Democrats or both four years from now.
   ``It's very seldom both parties have their convention in the
same city,'' he noted.
   It happened in 1952 in Chicago and 1972 in Miami, and Hardy
hopes New Orleans will claim that fame at the next 20-year
interval, 1992.
   ``We're hoping history repeats itself,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   A 9-year-old boy rescued his baby
brother from the bathtub and performed mouth-to-mouth resuscitation
after he found the infant had stopped breathing, police said.
   When the 9-month-old child began to breathe again Friday, John
Swain called emergency number 911, then telephoned his mother at
work, said Capt. Don Hayden of the Orange County Fire Department.
   With all that done, the boy waited outside to guide paramedics
to the right house in this community about 50 miles southeast of
downtown Los Angeles, Hayden said.
   ``I've never seen such a calm, cool, young man,'' Hayden said.
``He did it all and he did an excellent job of it.
   ``I have kids of my own and I kinda doubt they could do what
John did. Most adults can't do what he did.''
   The boys' babysitter could not speak English and apparently
didn't realize what had to be done in the situation, Hayden said.
   ``We were thrilled to see someone that young so knowledgeable,''
Hayden said. ``He was real instrumental in saving his brother's
life.''
   It was not immediately known where John learned to give
mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, Hayden said. A message left on the
family's answering machine Friday evening was not immediately
returned.
   The infant, Bill, was taken to Mission Community Hospital in
nearby Mission Viejo, where he was treated and released, said
nursing supervisor Sue Donofrio.
   Hayden said another boy, age 3 or 4, also was present but was
``just in awe of everything.''
   The fire captain said he would recommend a bravery certificate
for the 9-year-old hero.

<HEAD>Mulroney Government Hit By Kickback Allegations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BRADLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two legislators from Prime Minister Brian
Mulroney's Conservative government say kickbacks are a way of life
in the administration _ charges that could hurt Mulroney in
elections expected next month.
   The allegations, which surfaced Thursday and Friday, are
political fodder for opposition parties. Polls show the opposition
Liberal Party with a narrow overall lead, followed by the
Conservatives and the socialist New Democratic Party.
   The government said the accusations, by a disgruntled former
Cabinet member and another Conservative member of Parliament, were
unsubstantiated.
   Suzanne Blais-Grenier, a Conservative member of Parliament for
Montreal Rosemount, was quoted in the Montreal daily La Presse as
saying that companies routinely pay kickbacks to get federal
contracts in Quebec.
   Another Conservative member from Montreal, Vincent Della Noce,
was quoted in the Ottawa Citizen as saying the most difficult part
of his job was to ``stay clean.''
   Ms. Blais-Grenier, who resigned as junior transport minister in
1985 in a dispute over aid to Montreal oil refineries, said she
lacked the detailed proof for police charges. But she called for an
impartial commission to investigate federal contracts.
   Ms. Blais-Grenier is under pressure from party leaders in Quebec
not to seek re-election. Other Conservative legislators from the
province met Friday to consider expelling her from the caucus.
   Della Noce was quoted as saying, ``I could put a dozen people in
prison.'' But on Friday, Della Noce said he had no proof and said
he had not expressed himself clearly in the original interview.
   Mulroney was absent from the House of Commons in Ottawa when
opposition leaders hammered the government about the alleged
patronage.
   He is expected to call an election next month, a year before his
five-year term expires, because of Liberal plans to hold up
ratification of the Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement, which is to
take effect on Jan. 1.
   Liberal Raymond Garneau, a leading Quebec legislator, said:
``I've never seen such serious admissions on the part of a
government.''
   But Solicitor General James Kelleher said: ``We as a government
have no information whatsoever to substantiate the allegations.''
   The Royal Canadian Mounted Police interviewed Ms. Blais-Grenier
on Friday, and Sgt. George Watts said she ``had no details of any
activity which could permit the RCMP to initiate a criminal
investigation.''
   He said the Mounties had not yet spoken with Della Noce.
   Police confirmed they have asked the FBI to interview officials
at Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. headquarters in New York in
connection with a 2-year-old investigation of possible kickbacks in
a $820,000 Canadian government contract to lease office space from
the company.
   Liberal leader John Turner, poised to take over as prime
minister if his party wins the election, told the Commons that a
royal commission should ``investigate the whole course of conduct
of this government.''
   But Deputy Prime Minister Don Mazankowski dismissed the
suggestion and said the government had moved quickly in the past by
ousting ministers and ordering inquiries when there was ``clear
evidence of wrongdoing.''

<HEAD>Plaintiff: Discrimination Exists Systemwide In FBI</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HOLDEN LEWIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>EL PASO, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The lead plaintiff in a class-action suit
against the FBI says bias is so institutionally ingrained at the
agency that even he treated fellow Hispanics unfairly.
   ``Bigotry is not the problem,'' Bernardo ``Matt'' Perez
testified Friday in U.S. District Court. ``What we're talking about
is a system of discrimination. As a supervisor, I've been part of
that system. I'm not talking about a particular person. I'm talking
about an organization.''
   Perez and the 310 Hispanic agents who joined him in the lawsuit
contend the FBI discriminates against Hispanics in hiring,
promotion, assignments and discipline. They are seeking damages and
changes in FBI policy.
   About 400 of the FBI's 9,000 agents are Hispanic.
   FBI Personnel Director David Rarity Jr. testified earlier that
the agency does not discriminate against Hispanics.
   Perez, who filed the suit in January 1987, was one of the last
witnesses to testify for the plaintiffs in what is scheduled to be
a two-week, non-jury trial. The plaintiffs rested Friday after five
days of testimony and about 40 witnesses; the FBI is scheduled to
start calling witnesses for its defense Monday.
   During the first week of the trial, agents testified that
Hispanics are assigned a disproportionate number of
Spanish-language wiretaps and temporary out-of-town assignments.
   Because those assignments are not considered as prestigious or
difficult as street investigations, Hispanics are given lower
performance appraisals than non-Hispanics, agents testified.
   Other agents testified that Hispanics are more likely to be
given dangerous undercover assignments, but that they don't receive
the same recognition for that work as non-Hispanics.
   Hispanics are assumed to know Spanish even when they don't, and
non-Hispanic Spanish-speakers are much less likely than Hispanics
to be assigned low-glamor or highly dangerous jobs, according to
testimony.
   Perez said he had no choice but to engage in such discriminatory
actions because the FBI is structured that way and because the
agency has not tried hard enough to hire bilingual agents or teach
agents Spanish.
   Every Hispanic agent who testified expressed fear of retaliation
for cooperating with the lawsuit.
   During three hours of testimony Friday, Perez described what he
called a systematic pattern of discrimination against him.
   Perez, second-in-command at the El Paso bureau, said he first
noticed discrimination when he was attending the FBI academy at
Quantico, Va.
   ``One time the assistant director called me into his office and
said, `What would you say if I called you a blankety-blank blank
blank Mexican?' I said, `I would say you're an ignorant person.'
   ``He said he wanted to know because they would be handing me a
weapon and he didn't want me flying off the handle and hurting
people.''
   Perez testified his problems intensified in 1982, after he was
demoted from the top post in San Juan and sent to Los Angeles,
where he was the No. 2 man under agent Richard Bretzing.
   Bretzing kept Perez uninformed about investigations and
repeatedly harassed him, Perez said. Bretzing demoted Perez twice,
before finally forcing him to El Paso.
   ``Butte and El Paso are considered dumping grounds for agents
who are malcontents,'' Perez testified.

   The official Tass news agency reported today that
Pakistani authorities suspect sabotage in the plane crash that
killed President Mohammed Zia ul-Haq, but it did not mention that
Zia's son suspects Kremlin involvement.
   Zia and 29 others were killed Wednesday when the C-130 military
transport plane they were in exploded and crashed. The blast also
killed U.S. Ambassador Arnold Raphel, several Pakistani generals
and other senior military men.
   ``It is supposed that this action was perfectly planned and
faultlessly executed, the newspaper Muslim points out,'' said
Tass's Islamabad correspondent in a dispatch. ``An explosive device
might have been installed in the plane.''
   But Tass was silent on comments made Friday in London by Zia's
eldest son concerning possible Soviet involvement. Ijaz ul-Haq
said, ``Some of the superpowers may be involved in it. Naturally, I
would think about the Soviets at this time.''
   Zia was a strong supporter of guerrillas fighting the
Soviet-backed government of Afghanistan, giving them bases in
Pakistan to conduct military operations in Afghanistan. Soviet
officials had accused him repeatedly of violating Geneva accords
that provided for the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan.
   Tass also reported on some of the theories about the crash. The
dispatch said some officials believe the plane might have been hit
by a missile fired from the ground.
   ``But all officials believe the air crash was not accidental,''
Tass said.
   Tass also noted a Soviet delegation arrived in Islamabad for the
funeral of the 64-year-old leader. The delegation was led by
Vitautas Astrauskas, vice president of the presidium of the Supreme
Soviet.

   Firefighters braced for 40 mph winds today
as they battled an 11-day-old, 27,000-acre wildfire south of Helena
that consumed at least 10 homes and 30 head of cattle.
   Meanwhile, dozens of other fires _ some of them potentially
serious _ broke out in Montana, state and federal officials said.
   In Wyoming, firefighters at Yellowstone National Park also were
expected to encounter high winds, and a team began investigating a
helicopter crash that killed one person in Bighorn National Forest
during firefighting efforts. Wildfires continued to rage in
California, Utah and Idaho.
   The devastating fire near Helena cooled somewhat Friday after
dramatic runs earlier in the week. The fire turned just before
reaching a mountain subdivision with scores of residences and
surrounding ranches.
   ``We're looking pretty good,'' said Anne Jeffery, a fire
information officer.
   She said the fire had grown by 600 acres Friday, but that was a
small increase compared with the 7,000- and 15,000-acre runs the
two previous nights.
   With a part of the fire heading southeast toward flatter land,
officials said they would have more of a chance of checking its
advance once it left the rugged mountain ridges. Another portion of
the fire was moving into even rougher country to the south, but
there was no danger of damage to structures there.
   ``There's no more homes in the way,'' said Art Howell of the
Inter-agency Fire Dispatch Center. ``But that depends a lot on the
weather, and the wind is a big factor.''
   The National Weather Service forecast winds gusting to 40 mph
today.
   Fires were burning over thousands of acres elsewhere in Montana,
many of the blazes resulting from lightning strikes earlier in the
week.
   At least one summer residence was destroyed and others
threatened in a small but dangerous blaze that erupted in logging
slash Friday afternoon about 12 miles northwest of Butte, said Jack
Cullen of the Deerlodge National Forest.
   Other fires were reported in southeastern Montana, including one
that threatened to overrun a ranch in southern Bighorn County near
the Wyoming line.
   Some of the 1,000 firefighters on three fires that have burned
14,000 acres of scattered timber and grasslands near Lame Deer in
southeastern Montana were released from lines Friday, and officials
said those blazes should be controlled by Sunday evening.
   In north-central Montana, 980 firefighters put finishing touches
on a 4,500-acre fire on the Rocky Boys Indian Reservation.
Spokesman Chris Comstrock said the fire should be fully encircled
by tonight if the weather cooperates.
   About 40 smaller lightning-caused fires burned Friday in the
Flathead River drainage of northwestern Montana.
   In Wyoming, Yellowstone spokeswoman Amy Vanderbilt said
firefighters began removing debris and flammable materials from the
structures in the Norris Junction area to prepare for the arrival
of a 74,000-acre fire.
   ``If the forecast brings winds as anticipated, we expect (the
fire) will reach Norris (today),'' she said. The blaze is one of
several burning in the nation's oldest national park.
   In Bighorn National Forest, investigators representing the
agencies fighting a 5,400-acre blaze on Friday reached the site of
the fatal helicopter crash, which left its three other occupants
injured.
   The privately owned helicopter, under contract with the U.S.
Forest Service, crashed in a rugged wilderness area west of the
fire's western boundary.
   A wildfire set by an arsonist in the San Jacinto Mountains of
California charred 1,237 acres but firefighters encircled it, while
a blaze burning out of control blackened at least 300 acres in the
San Bernardino National Forest.
   The arson fire, on part of the Morongo Indian Reservation about
95 miles east of downtown Los Angeles, was contained Friday night
and full control was expected by early today, the California
Department of Forestry said.
   Firefighters contained a 580-acre southern Utah brush fire and
hoped to bring the blaze under control by the weekend, but crews
were being sent to another fire burning in the Wahwah Mountains
about 50 miles northwest of Cedar City.
   Firefighters in Idaho's Challis National Forest squelched a
nearly 14,000-acre fire and were being sent elsewhere.

   What began as a hometown salute to Sen.
Dan Quayle and the Republican ticket turned into mass catcalls and
jeers as thousands of Quayle supporters reacted angrily to
reporters' questions about whether he had strings pulled to avoid
the draft during the Vietnam War.
   As the audience chanted ``Quayle! Quayle!'' the 41-year-old
senator said there was nothing improper in the way he entered the
National Guard in 1969.
   The Republican vice presidential nominee acknowledged that a
family friend made calls on his behalf after he expressed interest
in joining the Guard but insisted: ``I got in fairly.''
   Quayle said he resented implied slurs on his patriotism by media
reports of the controversy and said it should help, not hurt, him
with the voters.
   ``You're going to be surprised at how outraged people and
families that identify with the National Guard around America are
going to be towards these accusations,'' Quayle said as the crowd
cheered.
   Bush campaign officials denied that the event had been
orchestrated to include the crowd in Quayle's first detailed
answers to questions about his military record.
   But the event provided another example of how Vice President
George Bush's running mate has seemed to overshadow the campaign.
   Meanwhile, The Washington Post reported in Saturday editions
that Quayle passed an armed forces physical examination on April 9,
1969, which meant that he would have been eligible to be drafted at
any time after his May 25 graduation day.
   He was called to take the physical by his local draft board
while he was still a DePauw University senior, the Post said. He
entered the National Guard on May 19, but the newspaper quoted
Guard officials as saying they were still reviewing Quayle's
military records, presumably showing when he applied to join, and
could not release them.
   The senator had promised to respond Friday to questions that
have dogged him since he was picked by Bush as his running mate.
   But the opportunity provided by Bush aides came at the end of a
rousing rally for the popular senator at a courthouse square across
from his father's newspaper.
   After Quayle shook hands with his supporters, aides brought him
before a throng of reporters at an outdoor news conference, which
was piped over an public address system.
   Boos and hoots of ``b-o-r-i-n-g'' sang out across the courtyard
as Quayle was asked about the sequence of events that led to his
entry into the Guard.
   Quayle said that during his senior year in college, as he
pondered future military service, he turned to his parents for
advice ``like any 22 year old.'' He faced the loss of his college
deferment after graduation.
   The family discussed the matter with Wendell C. Phillippi, a
former commander of the Indiana National Guard who worked for
Quayle's grandfather at the Indianapolis News, Quayle said, in an
account that was similar to that Phillippi has provided to
reporters.
   ``I did not ask him to make any calls. I told him I was
interested in getting into the Indiana National Guard. ... I would
assume that calls would be made,'' Quayle said.
   Phillippi, who has said he contacted the Guard on Quayle's
behalf, ``knew that I wanted to get into the National Guard and I
hoped he would help me,'' Quayle said.
   ``I did not join to avoid service in Vietnam because by joining
the Indiana National Guard, I could have gone to Vietnam if my unit
had been called up,'' Quayle said.
   The senator said he would not have done things differently if he
had known he would be running for vice president. He said he did
not consider the matter an embarrassment for the ticket and had not
offered to remove himself from the race.
   ``Vice President George Bush agrees with me that it is patriotic
to serve in the Indiana National Guard and he's proud of my
service,'' Quayle said.
   At the rally, Bush praised Quayle as ``a young man of vision, of
character.''
   But it was Quayle for whom the crowd reserved its greatest
enthusiasm. Scores of residents dotted the road to Huntington from
the Fort Wayne airport, and Huntington's police chief estimated the
crowd at the rally to be as many as 20,000 people.
   Quayle told them: ``We have the values, the character, the work
ethic of all small towns.''
   ``My roots, my values, my friends, my neighborhoods _ it is
indeed a proud day, but most importantly, I am just proud of
Huntington,'' he said.
   The crowd roared when he added: ``We love the National Guard.''

   Scientists in Taiwan say a new material shows
possible superconductivity at up to 66 degrees above the current
record temperature, but other scientists have reacted with caution.
   The new report does not include a crucial test for proving
superconductivity, so the material should be considered only a
possible superconductor, the other experts said.
   Superconductivity is the ability of some materials to conduct
electricity without loss to resistance. If the materials can be
made practical, they may lead to such advances as smaller, more
powerful computers and magnetically levitated high-speed trains.
   Materials created so far must be chilled before they will
superconduct. Researchers are trying to develop materials with as
high a superconducting temperature as possible, to minimize the
expense of cooling and so make superconductors more practical.
   The new report from Taiwan says five samples of the material
showed no electrical resistance at temperatures above minus 208
degrees Fahrenheit. One sample showed no resistance at minus 168
degrees, the researchers said.
   The current widely accepted record is minus 234 degrees.
   The new research is disclosed in ``High Tc Update,'' a
newsletter published by the Ames Laboratory at Iowa State
University under contract to the U.S. Department of Energy. ``Tc''
refers to the temperature at which a material begins to
superconduct.
   The newsletter obtained a copy of a paper by researchers at the
Industrial Technology Research Institute and the National Tsing Hua
University, both in Hsinchu, Taiwan.
   The researchers reported their material includes the same
ingredients as the current record-holding compound: thallium,
calcium, barium, copper and oxygen.
   Some samples that conducted electricity without resistance at
temperatures above minus 208 degrees eventually lost that ability.
Others that could do so above minus 226 degrees still had that
ability after a week, the researchers said.
   The reason for the changes in performance in some samples has
not yet been pinpointed, they said.
   Superconductivity researcher Paul Chu of the University of
Houston said he found no errors in the reported resistance
measurements when he visited the researchers recently in Taiwan.
   But he also said he knew of no measurements of the magnetic
characteristics of the new material. Superconducting materials give
off a characteristic magnetic signal when exposed to a magnetic
field, and existence of this signal is considered a crucial test of
whether a material is a true superconductor.
   Without a report of that measurement, the material should be
considered only a possible superconductor, he said.
   Similarly, physicist John Clem at the Ames laboratory said the
manuscript from the Taiwan researchers is ``very convincing,'' but
that the lack of magnetic measurements is disturbing.
   Clem said he `wouldn't get excited'' about the new material
until such measurements are reported and the experimental results
are duplicated by other researchers.

   A bus carrying West German and Portuguese
nationals veered off a highway and rolled into a ravine today,
killing five people and injuring 30, police said.
   The names and nationalities of the dead and injured were not
immediately known, but the official said most were West Germans or
Portuguese.
   He said the injured had been taken to six hospitals in Vizcaya
and Alava provinces for treatment for a variety of injuries, most
of them serious.
   The white Mercedes bus with West German licence plates had been
near Altube, near this northern city, when it overturned, the
official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Rescue workers took more than an hour to free all of the injured
from the wreckage, he said.

   President Lazarus Salii was fatally wounded
today by a gunman who entered his home. It was the second
presidential assassination in this western Pacific island chain in
three years.
   Salii, in his mid 50's, was shot once in the head in the living
room of his home in the capital city of Koror, said police Officer
Theodore Obak.
   Salii was alone in the house at the time of the 1 p.m. shooting,
while a security guard and a maid were outside, Obak said.
   The president was pronouced dead an hour later at McDonald
Memorial Hospital, he said.
   A .38-caliber handgun believed to be the murder weapon was found
at the house, Obak said.
   Salii had not received any death threats recently, the officer
said.
   Vice President Thomas Remengesau Sr. assumed control of the
nation, Obak said.
   Salii was elected in August 1985 to succeed President Haruo
Remeliik, who was shot to death at his home June 30, 1985.
   Three men were charged with Remeliik's murder, but were
acquitted at trial.
   Palau, with a population of about 15,000, is located 4,593 miles
from Hawaii.
   Palau is the last political entity of the Trust Territory of the
Pacific Islands, which the United States has administered under a
United Nations mandate since the late 1940s. It has been trying to
gain independence from the trust territory.

   A strong earthquake centered off the coast
of Taiwan shook the island early today, but there were no reports
of casualties or damage, the Central Weather Bureau said.
   The earthquake struck at 2:10 a.m. and registered 6.7 on the
Richter scale, the bureau said. The epicenter was at sea about 65
miles southeast of the coastal city of Ilan in eastern Taiwan.
   The tremor was felt in the capital, Taipei, where residents
reported their houses shook violently, the bureau said.
   The Richter scale measures ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. An earthquake of magnitude 6 can cause severe damage
in a populated area.

   Iraqi merchant vessels sailed the Persian
Gulf and the Gulf of Oman for the first time in eight years today
under protection of a cease-fire in the Iran-Iraq war.
   Iraqi Oil Minister Issam Abdel-Rahim said the Ain Zalah, a
government-owned 35,338-ton oil tanker, took on cargo and left Iraq
to sail the Persian Gulf ``a few hours after the truce began'' at 7
a.m. (11 p.m. EDT).
   Iran and Iraq often attacked shipping during the war, leaving
hundreds of vessels damaged or destroyed in the gulf.
   Iraqi shipping through the gulf stopped shortly after the
outbreak of the war in September 1980. It relied on pipelines for
the export of its oil and on shipments via Kuwait and Jordan for
its commercial trade.
   In his statement, carried by the official Iraqi News Agency and
monitored in Nicosia, the oil minister did not say where the vessel
was loaded or from where it sailed.
   ``Some people were betting that Iraq would not be able to renew
its oil exports through the gulf for months or years after the halt
of the war,'' he said. ``But here we are, and within a few hours,
already launching our first shuttle.''
   He did not disclose the destination of Ain Zalah nor mention
another ship, the Khawla, which shipping executives said sailed
earlier today from a United Arab Emirates port in the Gulf of Oman
toward the gulf.
   The Khawla honked its horns as it began its northbound voyage
from the port of Fujairah toward the Iraqi port of Basra almost
immediately after the truce began, shipping executives said.
   One of the shipping executives monitoring spillovers of the war
on gulf shipping said: ``There has been nothing special, everything
is quiet. ... let's see if it lasts.''
   The London-based Lloyd's Shipping Intelligence Unit says 546
commercial vessels have been damaged in the so-called ``tanker
war.''
   Iraq attacked Iranian-chartered ships and Iran retaliated by
attacking neutral shipping since Iraq's port of Basra was shut down
during the war.
   Lloyd's authoritative register of vessels lists the Khawla as a
3,985-ton cargo vessel that could also be used as a tank-landing
troop ship.'' The Idrissi is not listed.
   The Khawla, which the executives said has an Iraqi captain and a
21-man crew on board, would first sail through a 100-mile stretch
from the Gulf of Oman to Hormuz.
   The vessel would then sail up the gulf to the southern Iraqi
port of Basra, 600 miles from Hormuz.
   Iran's navy chief, Rear Adm. Mohammad Malekzadegan, said Iran
will continue to search vessels in the gulf until ``the
establishment of comprehensive peace'' between the two countries.
   Iranian and Iraqi delegations are scheduled to begin
negotiations in Geneva next week.
   Iran has intercepted hundreds of commercial vessels in the past
years, searching for Iraq-bound war-related cargo.

   A cease-fire between Iran and Iraq took
hold this morning after hundreds of United Nations observers moved
into position along the war front to monitor the first truce in
eight years of war.
   Peace officially began at 7 a.m. (11 p.m. EDT).
   Official media in the two countries carried no reports of any
violations or other incidents along their common 730-mile border.
For the first time in eight, years Iraq resumed shipping in the
Persian Gulf.
   Iraqis marched in the streets of Baghdad and in towns throughout
their country late Friday, celebrating what Iraq's media called
that nation's ``victory'' in the conflict.
   In Tehran, acting Commander-in-Chief Hashemi Rafsanjani warned
that Iraq might not want peace and that if it renewed hostilities,
it would face a much stronger Iran.
   Iraq said it was reopening the international airport in the
war-battered southern city of Basra and announced that merchant
ships will soon sail into the Persian Gulf for the first time since
the early months of the Iran-Iraq war.
   As night fell Friday, tens of thousands of people took to the
streets and public parks of Baghdad, many waving portraits of
President Saddam Hussein and chanting slogans in praise of peace.
   ``It is the happiest day in my life,'' said Alaa, an 18-year-old
on Karada Street, a main artery in downtown Baghdad. He said he was
due to be conscripted to the front in January.
   About 150 unarmed Blue Berets from the U.N. Iran-Iraq Military
Observer Group were deployed along the Iraqi side of the border to
monitor the truce, worked out during talks between U.N. Secretary
of State Javier Perez de Cuellar and Iranian and Iraqi leaders.
   Tehran radio, monitored in Cyprus, said 200 U.N. observers would
monitor the truce from the Iranian side.
   The officers were drawn from 24 countries. The United Nations
has set a $75.6 million budget for the mission.
   Rafsanjani, who also is Iran's Parliament speaker and a powerful
protege of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, said in a Friday prayer
sermon:
   ``We are facing two paths, war and peace. We chose peace, but we
are not sure about Iraq. If the enemy wants to continue the war, it
will continue much more seriously.''
   Rafsanjani also noted that ``Iranian forces have become much
stronger and more experienced. This war was a great help to the
export of our revolution and all the world realized that Iran
resisted without any help.''
   The Iraqi general command, in a statement carried by Iraqi radio
and television, also said Baghdad's forces would abide by the
cease-fire ``conscientiously and responsibly.''
   It expressed hope for better relations with Iran but added:
   ``Our bitter experience, and the sea of blood that the Iranian
aggression caused, make it our responsibility not to deal with Iran
on the basis of wishful thinking but on the basis of reality so
that we are not cheated again.''
   Iraq's oil minister, Issam Abdel-Rahim said Ain Zalah, a
government-owned 35,338-ton oil tanker, loaded up and sailed down
the Persian Gulf ``a few hours after the truce began.''
   Another Iraqi ship, the Khawla, left the United Arab Emirates
port of Fujairah in the Gulf of Oman and headed north for the Iraqi
port of Basra in the Persian Gulf almost immediately after the
truce began, said shipping executives speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   Iran and Iraq often attacked shipping during the war, leaving
hundreds of vessels damaged or destroyed in the gulf.
   Direct peace talks between the foreign ministers of Iran and
Iraq open Thursday in Geneva, mediated by Perez de Cuellar.
   The Geneva talks will focus on the peace plan decribed in
Security Council Resolution 598.
   The resolution calls for the cease-fire, withdrawal of troops to
their own territory, exchange of prisoners of war, direct peace
talks, and establishment of an impartial commmission to establish
responsibility for the outbreak of the conflict.
   The resolution was passed in July 1987 and accepted by Iraq at
that time. Iran finally accepted in last month, clearing the way
for the U.N. talks that led to the truce.
   Most Western estimates of the number of people killed since the
conflict broke out in September 1980 range from a half million to 1
million, with some figures even higher.
   The countries participating in the U.N. peacekeeping force are
Argentina, Australia, Austria, Bangladesh, Canada, Denmark,
Finland, Ghana, Hungary, Indonesia, India, Ireland, Italy, Kenya,
Malaysia, New Zealand, Nigeria, Norway, Poland, Senegal, Sweden,
Turkey, Yugoslavia and Zambia.

<HEAD>Major Layoff Coming at Continental Airlines, Chairman Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Continental Airlines, plagued by losses in
recent months, is planning a layoff of up to 1,000 pilots, flight
attendants and other employees, its chairman says.
   Chairman Frank Lorzenzo disclosed the plan here Friday outside a
court hearing at which he defended plans for a major layoff at
Continental's sister Eastern Airlines.
   Lorenzo, also chairman of Texas Air Corp., which owns both
Eastern and Continental, said a formal announcement of the
Continental layoff would come in the next few days along with the
carrier's new fall schedule.
   He told reporters the layoff would involve 2 percent to 6
percent of the company's 36,000 employees and include flight
attendants as well as some management personnel.
   Between 300 and 500 pilots would be involved, Lorenzo said.
   Continental posted a net loss of $231 million in the first six
months of this year and announced earlier that there would be
service cutbacks.
   At the hearing, Lorenzo said its was necessary to lay off some
4,000 employees and cut back service at Miami-based Eastern.
   The cuts, which would curtail service to 14 cities, were
announced earlier but have been blocked thus far under terms of a
temporary restraining order issued by U.S. District Judge
Barrington D. Parker at the request of three unions that represent
Eastern employees.
   Lorenzo said the cuts were needed to save the financially
troubled line.
   ``If Eastern's management is not permitted to take the actions
to save this company, then Eastern may run out of cash,'' Lorenzo
said.
   He denied suggestions by attorneys for the employees that he has
been attempting to engage in so-called union busting by
transferring Eastern's assets to Continental. He also said there
was no plan to merge the lines.
   The cutbacks represent an effort ``to stabilize the company ...
and decrease the losses,'' Lorenzo said.
   Union attorneys did question Lorenzo about the draft of a speech
that he was to give to Japanese investors in 1986 after Texas Air
bought Eastern.
   It said the purchase gave Texas Air leverage over the union.
``Eastern's airplanes can be repainted and moved over to
Continental where they will be flown by non-union pilots,'' it said.
   Lorenzo said an investment banking firm prepared the speech. It
was unclear whether he ever delivered it.

   It took dozens of investigators and an elaborate
police scheme, but authorities say they finally caught a man who
cheated manufacturers in at least eight states out of millions of
dollars for years.
   ``He was terribly, terribly intelligent,'' police Lt. John Kelly
said of 35-year-old Elliot Keith Offen, who was nabbed Friday as he
tried to complete yet another alleged swindle.
   Through fancy phone work, Offen was able to steal and move on
without getting caught, Kelly said.
   Offen would arrange for products such as light bulbs, luggage,
sunglasses and packaging tape to be trucked to warehouses that he
would rent for a few days, Kelly said. Before the end of the 30-day
period for paying for the merchandise, Offen would resell it, then
disappear with the money.
   ``He was virtually a phantom, a voice on the end of a line,''
Kelly said.
   The scam ended when detectives moved in on him at 4:30 p.m. at a
Manhattan phone booth, Kelly said.
   ``He was terribly surprised because he's very disciplined and
very intelligent and thought he was above arrest,'' said Kelly,
commanding officer of the Police Department's special fraud squad.
   Offen, who used as many as 50 aliases and a variety of voices,
was charged with grand larceny, attempted grand larceny, criminal
impersonation and warrant for interstate flight to avoid
prosecution, Kelly said.
   Offen is wanted by Broward County, Fla., police in connection
with numerous fraud cases that authorities estimate amounted to $15
million in losses for companies there, said Officer Joseph
Gallagher.
   Other states where police say his schemes reached include New
Jersey, Ohio, Virginia, Wisconsin, Illinois and Indiana.
   By late Friday, police had not located any of the money and did
not know where Offen lived or what he did with the money, Kelly
said.
   Offen, who was last arrested in New York state on larceny
charges in 1977, refused to speak to police and asked for an
attorney, Kelly said.
   To earn the trust of manufacturers, Offen would learn the names
of key people such as warehouse managers and would haggle during
the purchases like a legitimate buyer, he said.
   Offen would use legitimate trucking companies and other
unknowing go-betweens, but would only pay for the relatively
inexpensive rental of the warehouses, Kelly said.
   Rarely would Offen meet anyone himself.
   Although it was not known how many years Offen had been
operating, the National Association of Credit Managers in
Washington issued an advisory about him in September 1986, Kelly
said.
   The case broke on May 11, when police Detective Brian Smith
began investigating the theft of about $30,000 worth of light bulbs
from General Electric Co. in Queens, Kelly said.
   Offen later arranged for a shipment of $100,000 in light bulbs
but avoided a police trap in both instances by not showing up to
collect the merchandise and not sending anyone else to collect, he
said.
   ``If he felt something was wrong he would burn the operation,''
Kelly said.
   On Aug. 12, a cooperating witness for police was contacted by
Offen and asked to warehouse $60,000 worth of light bulbs. The
witness called police, Kelly said.
   At the same time, the FBI was investigating the theft of light
bulbs from a Richmond, Va., company that were destined for New
York, said agent Walter Wright.
   After learning that an additional shipment was destined for
Paterson, N.J., police and the FBI arranged the help of truckers,
manufacturers, a store owner and others in duping Offen into
thinking the shipment was on its way, he said.
   Still, Offen suspected something was wrong and even hired a
private investigator to find out about the light bulb delivery,
police said.
   On Friday, he continued to try to verify by phone whether the
light bulbs had actually arrived, Kelly said.
   Police traced the calls and arrested him, he said.
   ``He looks like a salesman,'' Kelly said. ``He could be a light
bulb salesman.''

   A 2-year-old boy died after relatives
accidentally left him in a car and searing afternoon sun raised the
temperature inside the vehicle to about 200 degrees, police said.
   James Michael Krick Jr. of Glendale was strapped into his child
restraint seat and was in the closed car for about two hours before
he was discovered Friday afternoon, police said.
   The boy probably died within a half-hour of heat prostration or
heat stroke, investigators said.
   Police Sgt. Al Mitchell said the boy and his 5-year-old sister
were returning from an outing with their grandmother, 55-year-old
Martha May, and their uncle, 33-year-old Jeff Krick, when the child
was left in the car.
   Police said the child was asleep and apparently was overlooked
when the uncle and Ms. May, carrying James' sleeping sister, went
inside Ms. May's home after parking in the driveway about 3 p.m.
   Ms. May assumed Krick, her son, would bring the boy inside, and
Krick thought his mother would do so, Mitchell said.
   Feeling ill, the grandmother decided to nap, and Krick left the
house in another car for an appointment, Mitchell said. When Ms.
May woke about two hours later, she realized James was missing.
   ``The windows are tinted so even the neighbors wouldn't have
seen the child in there,'' Mitchell said. ``It is a very tragic
situation.''
   Paramedics who tried unsuccessfully to revive the boy took his
temperature, but it was too high to measure with the thermometer,
said police Sgt. Steve Corich.

   A hidden in a parked car blew up
near a busload of British soldiers, killing seven men, injuring 28
and blasting a crater six feet deep in the highway, police said
today.
   Victims were hurled into nearby fields, and their personal
belongings and debris from the bus were scattered along the remote
country road after the blast late Friday, officials said.
   No group immediately claimed responsibility, but suspicion
inevitably fell on the Irish Republican Army, which is fighting to
end British rule in the province of Northern Ireland. The IRA
claimed responsibility for two other bombings Friday.
   The army threw a security ring around the blast site today and
helicopters circled overhead as forensic scientists and
anti-terrorist officers combed the debris for clues. The bus
carried no military markings, and investigators were trying to
determine how the attackers knew that it would be in the area at
that time.
   It was the worst attack against British soldiers in Northern
Ireland since 1982, when 11 soldiers died in the bombing of a pub
in Ballykelly.
   Police Superintendent Wynnefield Hooke, leading the hunt for the
killers, said the bomb was in a vehicle parked on the side of the
road. Initial reports said the blast was caused by a land mine.
   Hooke said one of the injured was on a life support machine and
a number of others were very seriously injured. The injured were
suffering from burns, fractures, internal injuries and severe
lacerations, he said.
   The bus was carrying infantrymen returning from leave in
mainland Britain to their barracks at Omagh in County Tyrone, 50
miles west of Belfast.
   Paddy Bogan, president of Northern Ireland's middle-of-the-road
Alliance Party, who lives near the scene of the blast, described
the attack as ``a terrible slaughter.''
   ``The bus was a mess of mangled metal,'' said Bogan, who went to
the scene with other local people. ``It was a miracle anyone got
out of it alive. Mutilated bodies were stewn over a radius of 50 to
100 yards. I saw seven bodies. The faces of the injured were
terribly cut and bleeding.''
   His son Gary Rainey, drove three injured men to Omagh Hospital.
   ``The whole side of the bus was blown out by the bomb,'' Rainey
said. ``Most of the boys were still in their seats when we got
there. Some had been blown out the side and others out of the
back.''
   Belfast police said 35 soldiers were on the bus. Initial reports
said there were 38 and the British domestic news agency later
Friday put the number at 39.
   A press officer at Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's office in
London said Mrs. Thatcher was ``deeply shocked and distressed.''
   Northern Ireland Secretary Tom King, the Cabinet minister
responsible for the province, broke off his vacation in England to
fly back to Belfast for an emergency meeting with army and police
chiefs.
   Friday's blast occurred nine miles from Omagh. The soldiers
earlier Friday had flown back to Northern Ireland from leave,
landing at the military section of Belfast's Aldergrove airport.
   Two other bombs exploded early Friday. One injured three police
officers in Lisnaskea and the other damaged the Mourne Country
Hotel in Newry, Northern Ireland's newest luxury hotel.
   An IRA message to a Belfast radio station said the hotel, near
the border with the Irish Republic, is ``a meeting place for
members of the security forces and informers.'' The IRA claimed
responsibility for that bombing and the one in Lisnaskea, 62 miles
west of Belfast.
   Also on Friday, funerals were held for a British soldier whom
IRA guerrillas killed last week in Belgium, and for a Protestant
grocer shot to death Wednesday in his Belfast store.
   In Knighton, Wales, more than 1,000 mourners attended the
funeral of Warrant Officer 1st Class Richard Michael Heakin, 38,
who was killed by IRA gunmen Aug. 12 in the Belgian port of Ostend
as he stopped his car for a traffic light.
   He was stationed in West Germany but his license plate
identified him as a British soldier.
   In Belfast, thousands of people lined the streets to observe a
funeral procession for Frederick Otley, 44, a grocer fatally shot
by masked gunmen Wednesday in his shop in the Protestant Shankill
Road area of west Belfast.
   Both the Irish Revolutionary Brigade _ a previously unknown
group _ and the Irish National Liberation Army claimed
responsibility for the grocer's slaying.

   Tens of thousands of mourners
gathered at the huge Faisal Mosque today in a funeral procession
for President Mohammed Zia ul-Haq. Some clutched portraits of Zia
and shouted, ``We will mourn you forever!''
   The funeral cortege made its way slowly to the mosque as the
crowds, composed mostly of men, chanted from the Koran, holy book
of the Islamic faith, and shouted praises of their leader who died
in a plane crash Wednesday.
   The lawns and terraces surrounding the mosque were jammed and
scores of men clambered up on the roof and clung precariously to
the soaring dome.
   The flag-covered, flower-draped coffin was transferred from a
military ambulance to a gun carriage pulled by soldiers about 500
yards from the mosque.
   ``My heart is crying for him, and I am praying for his
salvation,'' said 74-year-old Mian Ihtishamuddin, who came by bus
from Peshawar, 100 miles away.
   Soldiers with bayonets and riot police with bamboo sticks lined
the streets leading to the modern mosque, the world's largest. The
crowd was generally orderly.
   The funeral procession was broadcast live by state-run
television. The cameras focused briefly on the tear-stained faces
of Zia's widow, Shafiq, and a son, Ijaz.
   Investigators were still searching for the cause of the crash
that killed Zia, U.S. Ambassador Arnold Raphel, and 28 other people.
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz landed Friday night with
Robert Oakley, designated to replace Raphel.
   ``This journey is a journey in sorrow,'' Shultz said. ``I will
be expressing the heartfelt sorrow of President Reagan and the
American people for Pakistan's tragic loss.''
   The United States was one of Zia's staunchest backers.
   Thousands of people poured into Faisal Mosque for prayers
Friday, the Islamic holy day, and heard eulogies for their late
leader. A sermon extolled Zia as the ``shaheed,'' or martyr, of the
Moslems.
   ``It's difficult to imagine Pakistan without Zia,'' said a
bearded army captain watching the crowd.
   Across the border in India, the government of Jammu and Kashmir,
an Indian state also claimed by Pakistan, passed a resolution
expressing its ``profound grief and anguish'' over the death of Zia.
   The state government also lifted a curfew in Srinagar, the
summer capital, for three hours. Security officials said the city
of 700,000 was calm. Four people were killed in the state Thursday
in riots stemming from Zia's death.
   In the absence of any government statement on Wednesday's
in-flight explosion, Pakistani newspapers were rife with
speculation.
   Their unattributed and undocumented theories ranged from
deliberate sabotage by unspecified enemies to a bomb hidden in a
basket of mangoes.
   A Pakistani government information officer discounted all the
press accounts. ``Nothing is known yet,'' he said, speaking on
condition of anonymity. ``The investigators are still at the
scene.''
   Zia's eldest son, Ijaz ul-Haq, said he believed the plane was
sabotaged, and he told Britain's Independent Television News that
``naturally'' he suspected the Soviets.
   The Soviet Union's official Tass news agency today reported on
the Pakistani media reports of sabotage, but it did not mention
Ijaz ul-Haq's comments.
   Like the United States, Pakistan supports rebels fighting the
Soviet-backed government in neighboring Afghanistan. The Soviet
Union had often accused Pakistan of violating a U.N.-mediated
agreement providing for the withdrawal of Soviet troops from
Afghanistan.
   Acting President Ghulam Ishaq Khan has said he would not rule
out sabotage in Zia's death but would await a report from the
military investigators.
   A U.S. Embassy spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said a team of Americans was assisting in the investigation at the
crash site near Bahawalpur, 330 miles south of Islamabad.
   Two Urdu-language newspapers said police had detained people for
questioning about the crash, but a senior official police who spoke
on condition of anonymity said the detentions were unrelated to the
crash.
   The mass circulation Jang newspaper said those detained were
employees of Bahawalpur airport. Markaz, a smaller newspaper, said
16 people were detained near Bahawalpur but did not say whether
they worked at the airport.
   Nawa-i-waqt, an authoritative Urdu daily, said investigators had
recovered the plane's flight recorder.
   Ishaq Khan, 73, who succeeded Zia,64, by virtue of his post as
Senate chairman, said he would carry out Zia's pledge to conduct
nationwide parliamentary elections Nov. 16. But like Zia, he has
not said whether the presidency also will be at stake in the voting.

<HEAD>Eight Insolvent S&Ls Merged As Southwest Plan Continues</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUZANNE GAMBOA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the wake of the merger of eight insolvent Texas
savings and loans into one government-owned unit, analysts
questioned whether the consolidation will lead to a long-term
resolution of the state's banking troubles.
   ``The question is: What have they accomplished by this?'' asked
Bert Ely, an Alexandria, Va.-based consultant on thrift
institutions.
   ``I characterize this as throwing toether a bunch of minnows and
sharks and getting one bloated whale,'' he said of the
consolidation, announced Friday by federal regulators.
   Similarly, U.S. Rep. Charles E. Schumer, D-N.Y., said he was
concerned such long-term commitments from the government might mean
taxpayers eventually will have to bail out the Federal Savings and
Loan Insurance Corp.
   ``Resolving hopelessly insolvent thrifts like these once and for
all takes real money, no funny money notes and asset guarantees,''
Schumer said.
   He called the deal a ``temporary Band-Aid'' that only serves as
a delay to a taxpayer bailout.
   The FSLIC estimated Friday it will spend at least $5.5 billion
over the next decade to create the new institution and combine the
thrifts, which include three of the largest institutions in Dallas.
   The merger, announced by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, is
the biggest under the government's Southwest Plan, which was
developed to consolidate or close 120 ailing savings and loan
associations of the 279 operating in the state as of Jan.1.
   The thrifts involved include Dallas-based Sunbelt Savings
Association of Texas, whose first-quarter loss of $1.2 billion
ranked it No. 1 for quarterly losses among the nation's savings and
loans this year.
   Also part of the consolidation are Western Federal Savings &
Loan Association of Dallas, which ranked 12th in losses for the
first quarter, and Independent American Savings Association of
Irving, ranked 20th in first-quarter losses.
   The other institutions are: First City Savings Association of
Irving; Federated Savings & Loan of Brady; Multibanc Savings
Association of Alice; Texana Savings & Loan Association, Texarkana;
and Summit Savings Association of Dallas.
   ``The eight thrifts have the most complex and troubled assets
portfolios in the state,'' said Mary Creedon of the Dallas office
of the FSLIC.
   Sunbelt Savings F.S.B., as the consolidated institution will be
called, will be headed by Thomas J. Wageman, now director of
Sunbelt Savings Association. Each of the eight merged thrifts will
be operated as branches and depositors will be covered, bank board
officials said.
   In the early 1980s, Sunbelt Savings Association thrived on real
estate lending, and according to federal regulators, loose lending
practices. Sunbelt and the seven other institutions had
interlocking loans and investments, often lending money for the
same projects.
   But as the Texas property boom went bust in 1985, primarily
because of an overbuilt market, the fortunes of the eight
institutions slid.
   Friday's announcement was the second in as many days of
federally sponsored consolidations of troubled Texas thrifts as
part of the government plan to rid the state of mismanaged and
poorly operating savings and loans. Thursday, the FSLIC announced
the consolidation of 12 troubled thrifts.
   In Utah, a settlement was reached that would return $100 million
to depositors in five failed thrifts.
   The agreement, announced Friday night by Gov. Norm Bangerter,
would pay $100 million of the $106 million that was on deposit when
the savings and loans collapsed in 1986. It also contained a
provision to repay the remaining $6 million if and when the money
is collected.
   The five failed thrifts covered by the agreement, which is
subject to legislative approval, were Western Heritage, Interlake,
Copper State, Commerce Financial, and Charter Thrift and Loan.

   Workers at four more coal mines today went
on strike and joined thousands of other miners, dockworkers and
transit workers in demanding legalization of the Solidarity trade
union federation.
   At least 10 mines were crippled, and the Baltic port of Szczecin
was without dockworkers or public transportation in what appeared
to be the nation's worst labor unrest since 1981. Unlike the
nationwide strikes of 1981, however, the current unrest was limited
to two geographical areas.
   ``We will not back down from our demands that Solidarity be
legalized,'' said Andrzej Milczanowski, a strike leader at the
Szczecin docks where about 2,000 workers held an occupation strike.
   ``The authorities must realize that if they want improvement,
they must restore Solidarity,'' he said.
   Reporters witnessed new strikes at the 3,000-worker Krupinski
mine in Suszec and the 3,500-worker ZMP mine in Zory. The state-run
PAP news agency said strikes also were under way at the First of
May and Borynia mines. All the struck mines are in the southwestern
region of Silesia.
   Piotr Hertig, a spokesman for the Inter-Mine Strike Committee in
Jastrzebie, said two other mines were on strike in the region:
Brzeszcze and Jaworzno. Mine officials reached by telephone denied
the report.
   Since the strikes began Tuesday, Poland has lost 110,000 tons of
coal production worth $5.5 million, Antoni Pilny, a spokesman for
the Jastrzebie area mining authority said Friday. The state-run
news agency PAP put the strikes' cost at $222,000 a day.
   The Council of Ministers accused strike organizers of trying to
``take advantage of the material difficulties and hardships of
everyday life.
   ``Instigators and organizers of the illegal strikes, in which as
a rule only part of the crew takes part, not infrequently place at
the top of the demands the issue of reactivating the former
`Solidarity.' It is an unrealizable demand,'' the council said.
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa warned that workers at the Lenin
Shipyard in Gdansk would join the labor unrest unless the
government legalizes Solidarity. The stikers are also demanding
more pay and better working conditions.
   The government says the strikes disrupt safety maintenance at
the mines, allowing potentially explosive methane gas to build up.
   ``We appeal to our brother miners, to their families, youth and
the whole population of the province to maintain reason'' and end
the strikes, the Katowice provincial council said after a special
meeting.
   Miners were told over loudspeakers they could be fired if they
did not return to work, but they ignored the warning. Dozens of
police vans moved into the area around Jastrzebie, center of the
labor unrest, but there were no signs of immediate plans to end the
strikes by force.
   ``We are not afraid. All the other miners are with us!'' shouted
an unidentified striker at the gate of the July Manifesto Mine,
where the coal strikes began Tuesday.
   ``We do feel danger,'' said Grzegorz Stawski, spokesman for the
Inter-Mine Strike Committee, ``but we get used to it.'
   Walesa said at a Gdansk rally that employees of the Lenin
Shipyard, where he works as an electrician, were prepared to stop
work Monday.
   ``Fantastic! We were waiting all the time for Gdansk to join
in,'' said a woman at the Inter-Mine Strike Committee. She spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   A strike by Gdansk shipyard workers eight years ago gave birth
to Solidarity. The free trade union movement had a 15-month legal
existence before it was suppressed and outlawed after martial law
was imposed in December 1981.
   Lenin Shipyard workers struck in May to support steel workers
who shut down the huge Nowa Huta steel mill. The Nowa Huta strike
ended with a pre-dawn police raid, and the workers later gave up
without a settlement.
   Walesa's call for a sympathy strike was applauded by the 500-600
workers at the rally, who chanted ``There is no freedom without
Solidarity,'' said Slawomir Majewski, a Solidarity activist in
Gdansk.
   No talks with management were announced. The strike committee
said it was prepared to negotiate if its legal advisers and a
priest were let into the July Manifesto mine.
   Miners are treated as an elite sector of Poland's working class
and earn the equivalent of about $177 a month, nearly twice the
national average, but frequently are expected to work seven-day
weeks under often hazardous conditions.
   They say their pay is not enough to survive with Poland's 60
percent inflation and nationwide price increases this year of 40
percent.
   This week's strikes surpassed the number of work stoppages in
April and May, which until then marked the worst labor unrest in
Poland since 1981.
   Production was stopped at the strikebound mines, idling about
40,000 workers. It was impossible to determine what percentage of
the mine employees actively supported the strikes.

   President Reagan lauded Vice
President George Bush on Saturday as a strong leader who has given
him ``straight-from-the shoulder advice'' and offered voters a
clear ``road map'' of his intentions if elected president.
   ``I'm proud to stand with him,'' Reagan said in his weekly radio
address, delivered from his vacation hideaway in the Santa Ynez
mountains 20 miles north of Santa Barbara.
   The president will travel to Los Angeles on Tuesday for a series
of political speeches, including a joint appearance Wednesday with
Bush.
   Reagan, who watched Bush's acceptance speech at the Republican
National Convention on television in his ranch house, said, ``After
hearing his speech Thursday night, all Americans could see what
I've seen for eight years _ dedication, integrity, and commitment
to principle, a strong man and a strong leader.''
   ``And one other thing,'' the president said. ``George has always
given me straight-from-the-shoulder advice and counsel, on how we
could advance our vision for the future. And he's always been
candid with me when we disagreed.''
   He gave no examples.
   The president drew a contrast between the detailed platform
written by the Republicans in New Orleans and the relatively brief
platform adopted at the Democratic National Convention in Atlanta
last month.
   ``That document is a plethora of platitudes and it points up the
difference between the two parties,'' he said. ``Our friends in
Atlanta won't tell you what they will do if they get elected, but
George Bush and Dan Quayle already have.
   ``George and Dan and our party have spread their road map out on
the table for all to see, while the other guys won't tell us where
they're going and won't even give us directions,'' the president
said. ``It will take more than platitudes to convince the American
people.''
   Reagan also had praise for Quayle, the Indiana senator Bush
chose for his vice presidential running mate. He made no reference
to the controversy over Quayle's service in the Indiana National
Guard during the Vietnam War.
   ``The strength and wisdom of George Bush was reflected this week
in the strength and wisdom of the Republican Party itself _ just as
the energy and enthusiasm of the party were reflected in the energy
and enthusiasm of Senator Dan Quayle,'' he said.
   ``Dan was elected to the Senate on the day I was first elected
president. Dan shares with George Bush and me a vision of an
America and a world no longer threatened by the specter of nuclear
attack. That's why Dan has labored with conviction for the
Strategic Defense Initiative.
   ``And he shares a vision of opportunity for all Americans. And
that's why he's stood with George Bush and me throughout the fight
to lower tax rates and increase opportunity for all Americans.''
   In the Democratic ``response'' to Reagan's remarks, Sen. Lloyd
Bentsen, the Democrats' vice presidential nominee, said the
Republicans have stood silent on major economic issues such as
trade.
   ``America is paying a heavy price for that Republican neglect
and indifference,'' Bentsen said in the radio remarks taped Friday
for broadcast Saturday.

   Iraq sent three merchant vessels into the
Persian Gulf on Saturday for the first time in nearly eight years
but said one of them was shadowed by an Iranian helicopter gunship
and a warship.
   Iran said its navy, backed by helicopters, intercepted and
searched the vessel, the Khawla, in the Strait of Hormuz but
allowed it to proceed after finding no weapons aboard.
   Baghdad sought to test its right of navigation in the gulf after
a U.N.-sponsored cease-fire took effect in the region early
Saturday morning.
   Iran said it launched a number of boats into the strategic Shatt
al-Arab waterway to ``display their power and readiness to defend
the borders of our Islamic homeland.''
   Sovereignty over the waterway, which flows between Iran and Iraq
and is Iraq's only outlet to the sea at the Persian Gulf, is a key
point of dispute between Iran and Iraq.
   In another development, Iranian Oil Minister Golamreza Aqazadeh
said the port of Genaveh, north of Kharg Island, with a capacity to
export 2 million barrels of oil a day, renewed operations.
   Aqazadeh said that with the cease-fire taking effect, Iran was
giving top priority to the reconstruction of the oil industry to
generate foreign currency reserves from oil exports.
   Iraqi Oil Minister Issam Abdel-Rahim said the Ain Zalah, a
35,338-ton government-owned tanker, sailed from the northern gulf a
few hours after the truce began at 7 a.m.
   The minister, quoted by the official Iraqi News Agency, did not
say which port the ship sailed from.
   He said the Khawla sailed from the Gulf of Oman coast of the
United Arab Emirates and was later shadowed by an Iranian
helicopter gunship and a ``war vessel'' as it passed through the
Strait of Hormuz, gateway to the gulf. He said Iran made ``an open
attempt to provoke the ship.''
   Iran's Islamic Republic News Agency quoted navy officers as
saying the ship was intercepted and searched in the Hormuz by
``naval units supported by helicopters.'' It said the ship was
found to be empty and allowed to proceed.
   Iranian naval chief Rear Adm. Mohammad Malekzadegan said earlier
Iran would continue to intercept ships in the Persian Gulf until a
comprehensive settlement was reached in the war.
   The Iraqi captain of the Khawla, speaking in a ship-to-shore
contact with The Associated Press, declined to discuss his cargo
and said ``there are no problems.'' He did not mention Iranian
helicopters or warships.
   A third Iraqi merchant vessel, the Idrissi, sailed into the gulf
from the port of Khor al-Zubair south of Basra on its way to the
Strait of Hormuz, the Iraqi agency reported. No other details on
the ship were given.
   Earlier, Baghdad radio quoted Iraqi naval commander Rear Adm.
Abed Mohammed Abdullah Abdullah as saying that if Iran searched
ships, that would be a ``a serious violation of the cease-fire''
and Iraq would ``strongly resist'' such a measure.
   Tehran radio, monitored by the British Broadcasting Corp., said
Iranian forces launched a number of boats flying the Iranian flag
into the Shatt al-Arab as U.N. observers watched. ``Complete calm
exists on both shores of the river,'' it said.
   The radio report did not say what type of boat was launched or
precisely where. The Shatt al-Arab is the only navigable channel
between the Gulf and the city of Basra, Iraq's only major port.

   Thousands of people rallied Saturday in
Burma's capital to demand a return to multi-party democracy, one
day after the country got its first civilian leader in 26 years.
   State-run Radio Rangoon said 112 people were killed Aug. 8-12 in
the capital, Rangoon, in rioting that led to the ouster of
hard-line leader Sein Lwin. Earlier govenment figures put the death
toll at about 95.
   An Asian diplomat in Rangoon estimated 4,000 people rallied
peacefully in front of Rangoon General Hospital, which became a
gathering place for protesters after troops reportedly fired on
doctors and nurses there Aug. 2.
   It has not been possible to get reliable details on the incident.
   But the government Saturday denied some demonstrators' charges
that medical personnel were killed. Radio Rangoon quoted the
Ministry of Health as saying three female nurses and one male nurse
trainee were wounded. Of the female nurses, only two required
treatment, it said.
   A Western diplomat who arrived in Bangkok from Rangoon said
security forces still were patrolling the Burmese capital on
Saturday, ``but they are relaxed. The situation is much less
(tense) than a few days ago.''
   Violence flared in Burma after leader Ne Win resigned last month
and hardliner Sein Lwin, widely hated for his brutal supression of
dissent, succeeded him.
   Tens of thousands of student-led protesters battled security
forces across Burma, demanding Sein Lwin's resignation, democratic
rights and an easing of economic hardships in a nation where rigid
socialism and isolationism have spelled economic ruin.
   Sein Lwin resigned Aug. 12 after 17 days in power. The protests
continued but focused on a demand for an end to one-party rule.
   On Friday, the nation's attorney general, Maung Maung, succeeded
Sein Lwin as state president and chairman of the Burma Socialist
Program Party. Maung Maung became the first civilian leader since
Ne Win led a 1962 military coup and replaced democracy with a
military-dominated, one-party system.
   One of Maung Maung's first acts Friday was to address the
party's Central Committee. He urged reconciliation, noted the
complaints of workers and students, cautioned against anger and
vengeance in seeking out those behind the violence, and said every
attempt must be made to prevent it from recurring.
   The Western diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
it was important that Maung Maung's speech ``did not rule out a
multi-party system.''
   The diplomat described Maung Maung as ``kind of a compromise
candidate'' who ``was not in the queue to be leader'' but who has
shown concern over the students' demands and is a civilian.
   The Asian diplomat, reached by telephone in Rangoon, said
Burmese had a mixed reaction to Maung Maung's speech.
   ``There is one group of people who say they will wait and see
what he can do to meet the people's desires and demands,'' he said.
``The other group of people say they aren't satisfied with the
speech and that they don't expect the ... ruling circle to keep
whatever promise it makes.
   ``It is too early to tell which group is the majority,'' the
diplomat said.
   Burma's Parliament moved Friday to defuse the situation by
forming a committee to determine ``the wishes of the people.''
   ``People are waiting for the committee. It has to report (to
Parliament) by the end of September and then we will see where the
real power lies,'' said the diplomat.
   Peaceful pro-democracy rallies were held almost daily last week.
Observers say Maung Maung's real test will come Monday, when
students have called for a nationwide strike to demand the
one-party system be dismantled.
   Radio Rangoon, quoting the Ministry of Health, said 112 people
were killed and 267 wounded in the riots in Rangoon.
   Previous broadcasts had said about 95 people were killed and 240
wounded in the Aug. 8-12 nationwide rioting, during which security
forces repeatedly fired to disperse crowds.

   An Eastern Airlines Boeing 727 jet blew two

Airport, but none of the 156 people aboard was injured, officials
said.
   The plane, Flight 158 from Miami, came to a halt at the
intersection of the busy airport's two longest runways, forcing
their closure. Hundreds of passengers were stranded as other
flights were delayed, said Eastern spokeswoman Kathleen Starman.
   The runways were closed for 3{ hours after the midmorning
landing before the plane was finally moved, said Dave Hess, an
airport spokesman.
   The tires on the left side of the main landing gear blew out and
the gear partially collapsed when the jetliner landed, Hess said.
The plane tried to veer off the runway but couldn't clear the
intersection, he said.
   The 149 passengers and seven crew members were evacuated through
steps in the back of the plane and taken by bus and van to the
National terminal, said Ms. Starman.

   A former top aide to Lyndon B. Johnson portrays
the late president as a fearful man whose ``world started slipping
from his control in 1965'' because of the pressures of political
opposition and the Vietnam War.
   In a book titled ``Remembering America: A Voice from the
Sixties,'' former Johnson senior speechwriter Richard Goodwin
describes him as a president intensely fearful of his political
rivals and wont to lapse into irrational ramblings about them.
   The book, soon to be published by Little-Brown, quotes Johnson
referring to blacks as ``niggers,'' describing top foreign service
officials as ``those damn Kennedy ambassadors trying to get me and
discredit me,'' and accusing liberals and top newspaper columnists
of being communists.
   An advance chapter of the book, provided to The Associated Press
by an agent for the author, focuses on Johnson's behavior in 1965,
the year when he was at the height of his political power. Johnson
was planning the first full-scale commitment of troops to Vietnam,
while in Congress he was pushing landmark legislation on poverty
and civil rights.
   Goodwin, although not a trained psychologist, argues Johnson
exhibited paranoid behavior. The conclusion is based on Goodwin's
observations as well as discussions about Johnson the author had at
the time with a psychiatrist.
   ``Lyndon Johnson had become a very dangerous man,'' Goodwin
writes. ``There is no question in my mind that both the atmosphere
of the White House and the decisions taken until 1965 (the only
period I personally observed) were affected by the periodic
disruptions of Lyndon Johnson's mind and spirit.''
   ``Although, I never lost my affection and admiration for the
man,'' Goodwin says, ``Johnson's world started slipping from his
control in 1965 with pressures dissolving his confidence in his
abilities to control events.''
   Debate on Vietnam at cabinet meetings was frowned upon and
cabinet members warned senior aides not to offer any criticism of
the war. Still, Johnson seemed well aware of the perils that
awaited the nation there.
   On July 14, two weeks before he ordered 100,000 soldiers sent to
Vietnam, Goodwin writes, Johnson said of the war in Southeast Asia:
``Vietnam is like being in a plane without a parachute, when all
the engines go out. If you jump, you'll probably be killed, and if
you stay in you'll crash and probably burn.''
   The ill-feeling the man who was president from 1963 to 1969 had
toward Robert Kennedy, liberals and the press has been well
documented in past accounts. Goodwin's book provides quotations of
Johnson from Goodwin's diary that support and elaborate on
Johnson's well-known feelings.
   Johnson suspected Kennedy of engineering civil rights
disturbances to discredit him. ``Bobby saw his chance. He saw I was
in trouble so he put (Martin Luther) King on the payroll to rile up
the Negroes. That's why we had the riots,'' Goodwin quotes him as
saying.
   Shortly before delivering a major foreign policy address,
Johnson ordered Goodwin to delete several proposals on arms control
because they too closely resembled ideas supported by Kennedy.
   ``I don't want one word in there that looks like I'm copying
Bobby Kennedy,'' Johnson said, according to the book.
   Kennedy made no secret of his dislike for Johnson, but said he
was mystified by the president's concern over his activities,
writes Goodwin, who was also a close friend of the New York senator
and later a campaign aide.
   Goodwin, a novelist, free-lance reporter and playwright, said
Kennedy once told him after a private meeting with Johnson that he
couldn't stand the president, ``But he's the most formidable human
being I've ever met.''

   Like letters to a friend, the feelings
expressed in a survey of drought-weary retailers reveal the hurt,
despair and uncertainty gripping businesses as they struggle to
survive the worst drought in decades.
   ``I love my town and the people in it, but if this continues, we
are not going to be able to afford to live here,'' a Cavalier
County retailer wrote in response to a state Tax Department survey
on the drought.
   As the hot weather sucked the life from income-producing wheat
fields and pastures across the state, it dried up sales for many
store owners who deal with farmers, the surveys show.
   ``Some days you wonder if it's worth turning on the lights,''
said a Williams County business owner. ``You always wonder if Tom,
Dick or Harry will still be farming next year. By the same token,
we wonder if we'll still be here.''
   ``The way our books are looking at this time, we are in the red
and afraid of the long winter,'' said a Dickey County business
owner.
   The Tax Department mailed surveys to 700 retail businesses July
27, trying to measure how much state revenues might decline because
of the drought. About 280 businesses returned the questionnaires by
Aug. 10.
   The numbers provide the evidence of the drought's effects _ 64
percent of the respondents reported reduced sales from what the
owners had expected.
   Tax Commissioner Heidi Heitkamp agreed to make the surveys
public, but excluded the names of the businesses and any sales
figures. Respondents were promised confidentiality.
   ``It is just hard to see the hurt that is on these pages,'' she
said. ``It is hard to see the despair in the small towns.''
   One Barnes County business compared the state's economy to the
Great Depression. ``The dirty '80s have not left us, and I do not
look for a big increase in sales for several years.''
   ``It takes two years to get back to normal after a drought, in
my opinion,'' wrote a Foster County retailer. ``It is going to be a
long, hard winter for all of us.''
   ``We'll have to put all of our help on unemployment this fall,
and I had to take a second job! We may have to refinance just to
keep the doors open,'' wrote a Bottineau County businessman.
   One business reported surviving tough times for years due to dry
weather.
   ``By 1983, even our business was beginning to slow down,'' wrote
the Williams County store owner. ``Interesting note: One week in
July 1983 grossed more than the whole month of July 1988.''
   ``The drought is just another nail in the wooden box,'' said a
Mountrail County business that has also been hit by hard times in
the state's oil-producing sector.
   There were many pleas for help.
   ``Some place along the line, someone is going to have to help us
out,'' a Cavalier County business wrote. ``If that doesn't happen,
then you might, as it has been suggested, turn this area into a
great national park.''
   A handful of businesses sympathized with the farmers, but said
farmers always get bailed out of their problems.
   ``What about the small-business person? We never get help,'' a
Burleigh County respondent wrote.
   Three business owners used the surveys to write their companies'
obituaries.
   ``Our sales will drop to zero very soon as we intend to close
this business and seek employment in another state,'' one Grand
Forks County retailer wrote.
   But several retailers found a silver lining in the drought.
   ``We have sold twice as many bird baths than we expected to.
People are feeling sorry for the birds. It was a real different
twist for our sales,'' a Ward County retailer wrote.

<TEXT>
   Hundreds of thousands of mourners
jammed the grounds of the world's largest mosque Saturday and
chanted praise as President Mohammed Zia ul-Haq was buried.
   Acting President Ghulam Ishaq Khan said he asked the United
States to help investigate the ``dastardly crime'' of the crash
Wednesday that killed Zia, the U.S. ambassador and 28 other people
aboard a military C-130 plane.
   ``We do suspect that a C-130 is such a stable plane that it
doesn't disintegrate into thin air,'' Ishaq Khan told reporters at
his first news conference since taking office as president.
   ``The enemy has penetrated the inner defenses of the country,''
he said. But he added that he had no proof that sabotage was to
blame and that it would be ``pure speculation'' to cast suspicion
on any group.
   As Zia's funeral cortege moved slowly through the streets toward
this city's white, futuristic Faisal mosque, the nearly all-male
crowd bade him farewell with chants from the Koran, the holy book
of Islam.
   Police would not give an estimate, but reporters estimated more
than 200,000 mourners.
   Dozens of men clambered onto the mosque's vaulted roof, clinging
to the soaring dome and pinnacle, and shouted praise for Zia, an
army general who ruled Pakistan for 11 years.
   Other officials seemed certain the crash was no accident. ``It's
generally felt that it was sabotage,'' Gen. Imranullah Khan, one of
many senior army officers at the funeral, told a reporter. He
refused to elaborate.
   ``The crash of President Zia ul-Haq's aircraft was definitely
sabotage, but the investigation is still under way,'' Interior
Minister Nasim Ahmed was quoted by the Urdu-language newspaper Jang
as saying.
   Reports of sabotage have appeared in Pakistani newspapers every
day since Zia's plane crashed, but most were unattributed and gave
no details.
   Mourners, many drenched in sweat from the 93-degree heat, surged
for a final look as Zia was buried on the mosque's front lawn under
a canopy of green and white, the colors of Pakistan. Officials and
relatives threw handfuls of earth on the coffin to the sounds of a
21-gun salute.
   Mohammad Khan Junejo, fired by Zia as prime minister in May,
picked up a shovel and joined dignitaries in filling the grave.
U.S. Secretary of State George P. Shultz joined other foreign
envoys in laying wreaths at the grave.
   Mourners began streaming toward the mosque early Saturday
morning, many shielding themselves from the sun with umbrellas and
stopping for water at the gates of the swank villas lining the wide
boulevard to the mosque.
   ``My heart is crying for (Zia), and I am praying for his
salvation,'' said Mian Ihtishamuddin, 74, who came by bus from
Peshawar, 100 miles west of the capital. Many expressed admiration
for Zia's efforts to broaden the influence of Islam in this country
of 107 million.
   The funeral cortege began its three-mile journey from the
president's office shortly after noon with Zia's coffin inside a
military ambulance.
   The procession was broadcast live by state-run television, and
cameras focused briefly on the tear-stained faces of Zia's widow,
Shafiq, and a son, Ijaz.
   Crowds standing as many as 50 deep on grassy knolls on each side
of the road strained to catch a glimpse of the flag-draped coffin
covered with tinsel and flowers. Soldiers with bayonets and riot
police with bamboo sticks lined the streets.
   Among the mourners were at least 600 men sent by Afghan
guerrilla leaders who long have received support from Zia in their
fight against the Soviet-backed Marxist government in neighboring
Afghanistan.
   Strung cross the road in front of the mosque was a sign that
read: ``Dear Zia. Our hearts mourn and shed tears on your sad
demise. Afghan mujahedeen (guerrillas).''
   Investigators were still searching for the cause of the crash
that killed Zia, U.S. Ambassador Arnold Raphel, and 28 others.
Shultz landed Friday night with Robert Oakley, designated to
replace Raphel.
   The 64-year-old Zia ruled Pakistan since seizing power in a
bloodless, military coup in 1977. He was a staunch ally of the
United States, which appreciated the help he gave the Afghan rebels.
   Shultz praised the smooth transfer of power to Ishaq Khan, who
as chairman of the Senate was Zia's constitutional successor. Ishaq
Khan, a 73-year-old civilian, so far seems acceptable both to the
powerful military and to opposition politicians, analysts here have
said.

   Iraqis crowded into stores and waved flags
Saturday on the first day of a cease-fire in the 8-year-old war
with Iran, but the government said Iran violated the truce by
killing an Iraqi soldier.
   U.N. observers reported no violations on the front.
   Iraq also said that in the Strait of Hormuz, an Iranian
helicopter gunship and a ``war vessel'' shadowed an Iraqi merchant
ship, one of three sent into the gulf waters to test the truce.
   The official Iraqi News Agency said an Iranian soldier
infiltrated an Iraqi ground position and shot a private. It did not
say whether the Iranian soldier was captured.
   ``Iraq did not retaliate for the Iranian violation,'' the Iraqi
agency said. It was not clear exactly where the incident occurred,
and Iran and the United Nations had no immediate comment.
   Earlier, Maj. Gen. Slavko Jovic, commander of the U.N. Iran-Iraq
Military Observers Group, said the ceease-fire was holding. He said
he had ``no information about violations and everything is going
very fine.''
   Most of the 350-man observer group began patrolling the 730-mile
warfront at 7 a.m. Saturday, capping a year-long effort by the
United Nations to halt a war that has cost an estimated 1.5 million
dead and wounded since it broke out in September 1980.
   Iraq accepted the cease-fire shortly after the Security Council
approved it in July 1987, but Iran accepted it only July 18 after a
series of defeats.
   Jovic's chief assistant, Canadian Col. John Annand, told
reporters that a few technical hitches in transport and
communications were ``the growing pains of a new mission with two
countries who have absolutely no experience with this type of
thing.''
   Cease-fire celebrations continued into the morning. Processions
of drivers honking their horns wound through the streets of this
city of 3.5 million, many waving Iraqi flags.
   Many Iraqis celebrated the cease-fire at shopping centers, where
they have suffered severe shortages of consumer goods over recent
years.
   Minister of Trade Mohammed Mahdi Saleh termed the day ``an
economic festival'' to mark celebrations of the ``great victories
scored by our people.''
   In an interview published by the official army newspaper
Al-Qadissiya, Saleh said President Saddam Hussein ordered the
ministry to flood state-run stores and local markets with goods.
   ``The goods will be unlimited in quantity and that includes all
kinds of goods available at the ministry's stores,'' including such
sought-after items as televisions, radios, freezers and other
electrical appliances, Saleh said.
   Iraqis lined up in front of state department stores by the
hundreds to get first crack at the new goods.
   Iraqi Oil Minister Issam Abdel-Rahim said an Iraqi merchant
vessel, the Khawla, sailed from Fujairah in the Gulf of Oman and
was later shadowed by an Iranian helicopter gunship and a ``war
vessel'' as it passed through the Strait of Hormuz, gateway to the
Persian Gulf.
   The minister, quoted by the official Iraqi News Agency, said
Iran made ``an open attempt to provoke the ship.''
   Iran's Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in Cyprus,
claimed Iranian naval units backed by helicopters ``intercepted and
searched'' the ship but let it go when no weapons were found.
   Iranian naval chief Rear Adm. Mohammad Malekzadegan said earlier
that Iran would continue to intercept ships in the Persian Gulf
until a comprehensive settlement was reached.
   Baghdad radio quoted Iraqi naval commander Rear Adm. Abed
Mohammed Abdullah as saying Iraq would ``strongly resist such a
measure,'' which he called a serious violation of the cease-fire.
   In a welcome sign of a gradual return to normal life, an Iraqi
jetliner completed the first Basra-to-Baghdad flight since the
early days of the war. Civilian traffic was halted at Basra's
airport when Iranian shelling devastated the southern port city.
   Iraqi soldiers continued to man anti-aircraft batteries atop
many of Baghdad's major high-rise buildings, and the government
warned that ``the road to peace might be littered with hardships.''
   Iraqi and Iranian negotiators are to meet face-to-face Thursday
in Geneva to begin work on a comprehensive settlement of the
conflict.
   An unidentified Iraqi military spokesman was quoted in
Saturday's newspapers as saying:
   ``The cease-fire is likely to lead to comprehensive peace for
which Iraq has been endeavoring. But there could be some who will
try to hamper this process. This requires that Iraq should remain
vigilant and not be complacent.''

<HEAD>Chile Police Commander Says He Might Be Willing To Negotiate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A member of the Chilean military
junta says he would be willing to negotiate with the civilian
opposition on far-reaching political changes if the government's
candidate is defeated in this fall's plebiscite.
   ``If the `no' wins (in the yes-or-no vote), there would have to
be an accord between those who won the majority and the junta,''
Gen. Rodolfo Stange told the Fort Lauderdale News-Sun-Sentinel in a
story published Saturday. ``And if they want changes in the
constitution, well, there would have to be an agreement on what
those changes would be.''
   It was the first time a member of the four-man junta, which
includes the president, Gen. Augusto Pinochet, seemed to accept the
opposition's argument that the defeat of the junta's nominee should
be interpreted as a vote of no confidence that could lead to
constitutional reform.
   Stange, who is also commander of Chile's national police, made
his comments Friday in his office in Santiago, Chile, to reporters
for the Fort Lauderdale newspaper and The Independent of London.
   Pinochet has been in power since the bloody right-wing coup in
1973 that overthrew elected-Marxist President Salvador Allende.
Pinochet has overall control of the nation's political direction
but shares power with the other three members of the junta.
   Sometime this fall, probably in October, Chileans are slated to
vote ``yes'' or ``no'' on a single candidate for president, to be
chosen by the junta late this month. It is expected that Pinochet
will be that candidate.
   According to the constitution, which was enacted by the junta in
1981, if the junta candidate is defeated, then Pinochet would stay
in power for one year and hold open elections. If Pinochet wins the
plebiscite, he would stay in power until 1997.
   Stange put no limits on what could be negotiated between the
junta and civilian political leaders in case of a ``no'' victory.
Even the armed forces' wide powers in the national security council
could be discussed, he said.
   Previously, military authorities have rejected any suggestion
that a possible defeat in the plebiscite might lead to major
structural changes in the system.
   Stange even questioned whether Pinochet should be the man on the
ballot in the plebiscite. The nominee should be ``someone who has
the will and ability to unite all Chileans so that the transition
to democracy occurs in peace and stability,'' he said.
   Asked if Pinochet is best equipped to fulfill these
requirements, Stange said: ``That is a difficult question. ... My
responsibility is to find a candidate acceptable to the majority.''
   The ideal candidate should be a civilian, Stange said.

   A traffic patrolman who wrote more than
1,000 bogus tickets and gave some motorists a break will remain
with the police department, his superiors have decided.
   ``I've lost 15 pounds over this. It's a hard way to diet,'' said
patrolman Michael Ghrist, a 17-year veteran of the Louisville
Police Department.
   He was given a 25-day suspension last month after the deception
surfaced, and officials decided last week to keep him on the force.
   ``I just could not bring myself to write tickets. I had a
conscience. l had a heart. I started seeing the human beings behind
the wheel,'' the 36-year-old officer explained in an interview
Thursday.
   A computer listing indicated Ghrist had written more than 1,000
tickets since 1981 to people for whom state employees could find no
Kentucky driver's licenses, Chief Jefferson District Judge Donald
Smalley said.
   Initially, officials thought only 100 tickets were involved but
said later the number had been understated because of poor
communication within the department.
   ``There was no indication that he was shirking his duty,'' city
Safety Director Tom Kuster said. ``He was just wasting a lot of
paper and screwing up the court's statistical system.''
   Ghrist said he started writing bogus tickets because, ``If I
gave too many people breaks, my activity level would be too low.''
   Police officials denied that there is a ticket quota system and
said Ghrist was motivated by ``self-imposed peer pressure.''

<TEXT>
   About 200 people gathered in
Prague's Wenceslas Square Saturday on the 20th anniversary of the
Warsaw Pact invasion that crushed reform in 1968.
   They discussed the need for more freedom in Czechoslovakia as
uniformed and plainclothes police stood near the gathering and
checked identity documents.
   Participants had responded to leaflets distributed to mailboxes
by a group called the ``Critical Citizens.''
   Earlier, police detained the three spokesmen of the human rights
group Charter 77 as they walked to the Soviet Embassy with a
statement demanding that the Kremlin tell the truth about the
invasion by Soviet and Warsaw Pact tanks and troops on Aug. 20-21,
1968.
   The invasion crushed the ``Prague Spring'' of reform pioneered
by then-Communist Party leader Alexander Dubcek, who was ousted in
April 1969 and expelled from the Communist Party in 1970.
   Dubcek said in Bratislava this week he planned to spend the
anniversary quietly at his country cottage.
   Despite pouring rain, about 200 people converged on Wenceslas
Square, the scene of fierce protests against the 1968 invasion.
   The gathering reflected increased activism by a handful of
independent groups formed in Czechoslovakia since Mikhail S.
Gorbachev began implementing his reforms in the Soviet Union over
the past three years.
   A group of about 100 sang the Czech and Slovak national anthems,
then discussed what could be done to change the country. Some
called for more religious freedom, democratic elections and
constitutional reform.
   Roman Catholic believers in Czechoslovakia have grown more
active in recent months. About a half million signed a petition to
communist authorities this year demanding more bishops for vacant
sees, more priests and an end to alleged harassment of believers.
   A young man who said he was from Slovakia appeared to lead the
hourlong discussion, in which there was no specific mention of the
1968 invasion. Western diplomats said those who had initiated the
discussion were not known activists.
   A group called ``Czech Children'' also distributed leaflets
calling for a discussion on Wenceslas Square Sunday.
   Charter 77 spokesmen Stanislav Devaty, Milos Hajek and Bohumir
Janat had announced plans to lay flowers on the square, at the
Central Committee building and at state radio to commemorate
countrymen who were killed or injured in violence at those sites
after the invasion.
   But an unidentified man at the square told the crowd: ``Those
with the stronger experience are not here. They are in jail. Now
the spokesmen of Charter 77 are in the police station.''
   It was presumed the three spokesmen would be detained for 48
hours and then released. Czechoslovak law allows detention for 48
hours without charge.
   Police warned other leading group members before the weekend
they would be detained, and left town for the anniversary.
   Police presence was heavy in the capital Saturday, but few
citizens were expected to make any public display of emotion over
the anniversary.
   Commentaries in the state-run media continued to reflect the
official view that the invasion was a painful but necessary move
because Dubcek and other leaders allowed reform to veer out of
control, threatening Czechoslovakia's ties to the Warsaw Pact.

   An overloaded ferry sank in Lake
Tanganyika, and more than 50 people were feared dead, Zaire naval
sources said Saturday.
   Little information on the sinking was available in the capital,
Kinshasa, 1,000 miles west of the lake.
   The sources said the ferry, which sank Wednesday, was owned by a
citizen of nearby Rwanda. They did not know where the ferry sank on
the lake or its route.
   The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the ferry
may have gone down because it was overloaded. They had no word on
survivors or the number of people who were aboard the vessel.

<HEAD>Government Orders Increase In Consumer Goods Production</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The government Saturday announced a program to
increase production of consumer goods said continuing shortages
could undermine Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reform efforts.
   The Council of Ministers, or Soviet Cabinet, said it has ordered
state-run industries to produce $38 billion more consumer goods in
1989 and 1990 than originally planned, the official Tass news
agency reported.
   Tass also reported the council plans an 18 percent increase in
the total amount of consumer goods originally planned for 1991-1995.
   It did not say what the original plans were.
   The new economic directive also provides for an increase in the
production of refrigerators and other electric appliances, and
promises to eliminate within two years shortages in automobile
spare parts.
   The Council of Ministers directed the Soviet automobile industry
to manufacture 2.3 million cars a year by the mid 1990s, Tass said.
In the first half of 1988, 386,000 cars were produced.
   The newspaper Moskovskaya Pravda reported Saturday that the
black market price for a car is at least $28,000, about triple the
average official price, accompanied by at least a one-year wait for
delivery after the order is placed. Tass said the number of
refrigerators, washing machines and kitchen appliances produced for
every 100 Soviet families is 20 percent less than in Western
countries. The gap is even bigger in cars, video, hi-fi and radio
equipment.
   The new economic plan calls for production of 13.6 million
television sets a year, up from 10 million this year, and 2 million
video recorders compared to 70,000 this year.
   The government said it will buy Western equipment for garment
factories in order to increase by 50 percent the number of coats
and jackets produced, and shirts and knitwear by 20 percent, Tass
reported. It did not say how much Western equipment would be
purchased for the clothing industry, or where it would be bought.
   In the past, the Soviet Union invested heavily in manufacturing
equipment, but many times has not been able to install or operate
it properly.
   Shops selling fashionable clothes are rare in Moscow and the
more attractive goods often are sold out the same day they are
displayed. Long lines form for many other goods that are of poor
quality but are in short supply.
   The ministers said the three years of Gorbachev's reform efforts
have failed to improve the supply of goods to Soviet consumers and
the Kremlin leader himself has repeated the criticism many times.
   The Soviet leader has encouraged decentralization of control
over local industry managers and better pay incentives for good
work to try to improve the supply and quality of consumer goods _ a
major goal of his reforms.
   But Gorbachev and his advisers acknowledge that consumers still
are no better off than they were when the reforms began.
   Tass said a meeting of the policy-making Central Committee at
the end of July ``pointed out that the ongoing scarcity of goods
has an adverse impact on people's attitudes to perestroika (or
restructuring), subverts their trust in the reality of the
transformations planned.''
   But the new government plan says nothing about improving the
chronically poor quality of Soviet goods, which Western economists
say is the crucial problem. They say production actually should be
reduced in many cases to allow production of more modern and
popular items.

   A Japanese woman realized her childhood
ambition to sail across the Pacific Ocean when she steered her
yacht through the Golden Gate after nearly 10 weeks at sea in the
solo crossing.
   Kyoko Imakiire, a 23-year-old former city employee from
Kagoshima, Japan, was welcomed ashore Friday night by St. Francis
Yacht Club members and other onlookers.
   Asked why she undertook the trip, she laughed and gave a simple
answer through an interpreter: ``I wanted to cross the Pacific.''
   Imakiire's voyage on the 28-foot yacht ``Kairen Tarachine'' from
her home city covered about 6,800 miles, according to the Japanese
Consulate. She left on June 11.
   Imakiire plans to begin a return voyage in October and arrive
back in Kagoshima in late November.

   Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied West
Bank are no longer citizens of Jordan, but they may obtain
temporary two-year passports from the kingdom if they need a travel
document, officials said Saturday.
   It was the latest in a series of decisions by King Hussein to
sever links with the West Bank and turn over responsibility to the
Palestine Liberation Organization.
   ``All citizens residing in the West Bank before July 31 are
considered Palestinian citizens, not Jordanians,'' Prime Minister
Zaid Rifai was quoted as saying by the official Jordan News Agency.
   He said West Bank residents can ``obtain temporary Jordanian
passports, valid for two years, if they desire.''
   The old five-year passports issued to West Bank residents before
July 31, the date that King Hussein announced he was cutting links
with the West Bank, will be valid until their expiration date.
   But after then, residents can obtain only the two-year document.
   Another senior Jordanian official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said the new law would ``allow West Bank residents to
travel, but not to qualify for Jordanian citizenship.''
   About 850,000 West Bank residents carry a permanent Jordanian
passport, valid for five years and renewable on demand for another
permanent passport.
   In addition, a minority of the 650,000 Gaza Strip residents
already hold temporary Jordanian passports valid for three years.
They will be replaced with the two-year passports upon expiration.
   Hussein has dissolved the lower house of Parliament, half of
whose members were Palestinian; dissolved the occupied territories
ministry; canceled a $1.3 billion development plan for the
territories; and laid off or retired thousands of state employees.
   Rifai said if schools in the West Bank opted for the Jordanian
system, the Ministry of Education in Amman would make arrangements
for exams to be held on the West Bank.
   But he said the ``tests would be corrected and grades would be
given by the ministry in Jordan.''
   Israel captured the West Bank from Jordan and the Gaza Strip
from Egypt in the 1967 Middle East War.

   Five children died Saturday in a smoky
blaze at their grandmother's apartment in a high-rise housing
project, officials said. The grandmother, four other children
including a 9-month-old, and two firefighters were injured.
   A new alarm system was being hooked up in the hallway but was
not yet in operation, said acting city housing director Bill Lau. A
smoke-alarm in the apartment near the bedroom was inspected and
replaced in March, he said, adding that it was up to the tenants to
keep the batteries fresh.
   The fire at the city-operated Curry Woods project apparently
began in the kitchen of the small apartment at about 4:20 a.m.,
said Police Lt. Donald Loehwing. It did not spread to other
apartments.
   ``This is the worst fire I can remember, especially over in the
projects,'' Loehwing said.
   The fire was not believed to be arson-related, said George
McComb, a Fire Department battalion commander, but authorities were
investigating.
   The nine children were listed as residents of the third-story
apartment and were in the custody of their grandmother, Helen
Cousins, 62, said Louise McLeon, manager of the seven-building
project.
   McComb said the children's relationship to each other was
unclear. He said they apparently were members of separate families,
one with three children and the other with six.
   Officials identified the dead as Cheryl Cousins, 5; Eugene
Cousins, 6; Rashica Cousins, 7; Jarmine Cousins, 10; and Shawn
Cousins, 9. They died in their sleep of smoke inhalation.
   ``They were all in bed. They never woke up,'' McComb said.
   Mrs. Cousins and three of the injured children, including a
9-month-old infant, were in critical condition, hospital officials
said.
   The other surviving child, Jamal Cousins, 14, was treated for
smoke inhalation and released. He said he escaped through the front
window and climbed down a fire department ladder.
   ``I didn't see nothing. They was in the other room and there was
a lot of smoke,'' he said of his relatives. ``I'm trying to take
it. I feel very sad.''
   Tanya Wilson, 17, said she was sitting outside the building when
the fire started.
   ``We smelled something burning and it got stronger. When the
smell got strong we got up and looked at the windows, and that
window just burst out,'' she said.
   ``We were yelling at the windows for the family to come down.
There were men out here with sheets yelling to throw the baby. We
were telling them to drop the baby but nobody did.''

   As the 1988 Olympics in South Korea approach,
supermarket checker Vicki McClure vividly recalls singing to the
world during the opening ceremonies of the Summer Games four years
ago.
   ``It was the most spectacular moment. It was bigger than life,''
she said. ``It was a really magical experience.''
   Ms. McClure, a musical unknown, sang the hit ``Reach Out And
Touch (Somebody's Hand)'' at the opening ceremonies of the 1984
Olympics at Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.
   But Ms. McClure, 34, who still works three days a week as a
checker at a market in Los Angeles in addition to taking part-time
singing jobs, is glad in a way that her moment in the spotlight
wasn't a springboard to a famous singing career.
   ``I didn't have any expectations,'' she said in a telephone
interview from her Santa Monica home. ``I'm not disappointed for
what has happened because being thrust in at that level with my
inexperience would have been a mistake.
   ``I really wouldn't have had an inkling of how to handle it,''
she added.
   The $7 million opening ceremony had a cast of thousands and was
staged before a capacity crowd of 90,000 and an international
television audience.
   The show included a 1,000-voice choir, a 750-piece marching
band, a 100-piece symphony orchestra, 7,500 athletes and 2,500
pigeons.
   Ms. McClure appeared as the lead singer for the Los Angeles Jazz
Choir, a position originally intended for a star of the caliber of
Diana Ross or Leontyne Pryce.
   She said she was first hired by the Olympics as a musician who
could serve as a standby soloist. But after Olympics officials
heard her sing, they chose her to perform with the jazz choir
because they liked the idea of having an unknown singer in the
spotlight.
   ``It was kind of in keeping with the amateur spirit of the
Olympics,'' she said.
   Ms. McClure said she is happy working as a part-time
professional singer, performing solo at banquets and ceremonies and
with the group Daddy's Money, which does nostalgic and rhythm and
blues songs.
   ``I haven't really done a Vicki McClure act as of yet,'' she
said. ``I'm still looking for a repertoire. It's hard to find
material you're comfortable with by yourself.''
   She said that as long as she can support herself she is happy
continuing with her current musical path.
   ``It takes a lot of artistic development to find your niche,''
she said.

<HEAD>Leftist Newspaper Seized In Police Raid</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police raided a printing company to crack down
on a newspaper that published an interview with Peru's best-known
guerrilla leader, the newspaper's editor said Saturday.
   Luis Arce told reporters that 40 police officers swept into the
Lima printing firm Imprenta Pedro Leon before dawn Friday, arrested
owner Pedro Leon and four employees and confiscated 100,000 copies
of El Diario.
   Police sources confirmed the raid took place, but refused to
provide details.
   Arce charged the government with harassing the paper in an
effort to force it out of business.
   ``We have no guns, not even a knife ... The government is trying
to put us out of business,'' he said.
   The government alleges El Diario is the voice of the Shining
Path guerrilla organization, whose insurgency to impose Marxist
rule in Peru has claimed more than 15,000 lives in eight years. El
Diario is openly Marxist but has denied links to the guerrilla
movement.
   But independent observers say El Diario reflects the ideology
and political objectives of the rebel group more accurately than
any other publication.
   The Lima tabloid drew widespread criticism on July 24 when it
published a 48-page interview it claimed was the first with Shining
Path leader Abimael Guzman since the rebels launched their
insurgency in 1980.
   Four days later, President Alan Garcia asked Congress to pass a
law empowering the government to close media believed to support
terrorists. Lawmakers are studying the proposal.
   El Diario reprinted the interview July 31, the day on which the
newspaper's contract with its printer expired. The agreement was
not renewed, according to Arce.
   Since then, El Diario has had trouble finding another printer
and has appeared only intermittently, Arce said, adding that the
government has intimidated Lima printing companies into not working
with the newspaper.
   Arce said the edition seized by police was a special third
printing of the Guzman interview.
   In the article, Guzman was quoted as saying the Shining Path
would not hold talks with the government until the rebels were
ready to change from a guerrilla to a conventional war.
   He was quoted as saying Peru's chronic economic problems
eventually would foment a general insurrection led by the Shining
Path, but did not give a timetable for the revolt.

<TEXT>
   Lazarus Salii, the Palau president who was found
dead Saturday from a gunshot to the head, was described by a U.S.
State Department official as a brilliant visionary.
   ``He was a true leader of his people,'' said James D. Berg,
director of the Office of Freely Associated State Affairs in
Washington, D.C.
   Salii was found dead in the living room of his home in Koror,
Palau's capital, with a single gunshot to the head, according to
Bonifacio Basilius, a presidential assistant.
   It was the second violent death of a president in the tiny,
sparsely populated Western Pacific island chain in three years.
   Salii was elected president in August 1985 following the June
30, 1985, assassination of Haruo Remeliik, Palau's first president.
   Salii, 54, was pro-American and a staunch supporter of a
proposed Compact of Free Association with the United States, which
would end Palau's 41-year U.N. trusteeship status. Under the
compact, Palau would become self-governing while retaining U.S.
economic assistance.
   At his inauguration attended by Pacific and U.S. leaders, Salii
spoke about the issues facing the nearly 15,000 people who live on
eight of Palau's 200 islands, which are roughly 800 miles south of
Guam and 600 miles east of the Philippines.
   Salii had been involved in political status negotiations
involving the then-Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands,
established by the United Nations in 1947.
   He was a member of the first Unified Micronesian Commission and
later was a Palau representative to the Congress of Micronesia.
   Micronesia is an area of the Pacific that includes Palau, the
Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia and the
Northern Mariana Islands. All were part of the Pacific Trust
Territory.
   The Marshalls and the Federated States of Micronesia became
freely associated states in 1986 after they approved Compacts of
Free Association. The Northern Mariana Islands became a
commonwealth.
   Remeliik and Salii were close friends. Remeliik named Salii as
his chief negotiator for a compact with the United States, which
administers Palau.
   ``He was a brilliant visionary on free association status,''
said Berg. ``He was patient and persisted with a constant vision of
his country as a sovereign nation in free association with the
United States.''
   In Washington, D.C., Janet McCoy, principal Interior Department
secretary, said she ``was shocked and stunned and deeply grieved at
President Salii's passing. It is a deep personal loss to the people
of Palau.''
   Mrs. McCoy was the last Trust Territory high commissioner. The
post was abolished in July 1987. She said she was a close friend of
Salii and enjoyed an excellent working relationship with him.
   Salii was a native of Angaur, the southernmost island in the
Palau group. He graduated from the University of Hawaii in 1961
with a bachelor's degree in political science and held numerous
government positions prior to the presidency.
   He is survived by his widow, Christina, and several children.

<HEAD>Mandela Rebounds From Tuberculosis, Doctors Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GREG MYRE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nelson Mandela's health has
improved and the jailed black leader has an excellent chance of
completely recovering from tuberculosis, doctors said Saturday.
   Leading newspapers, meanwhile, predicted the leader of the
outlawed African National Congress soon may be released from
prison. The Star, the country's largest daily, said Mandela is
``one step from freedom.''
   The 70-year-old Mandela, South Africa's best-known black leader,
was diagnosed with tuberculosis and transferred Aug. 12 from
Pollsmoor Prison to nearby Tygerberg Hospital in Cape Town.
   ``Mr. Mandela is responding well to our treatment,'' said Dr.
J.G.L. Strauss, superintendent of Tygerberg. ``He is cheerful and
is up and about.''
   Strauss said the prognosis for Mandela's full recovery was
``excellent.''
   Mandela's family asked the government Friday to release
Mandela's medical records to resolve ``nagging doubts'' about how
he contracted tuberculosis.
   The family questioned whether conditions at Pollsmoor Prison
caused Mandela's illness and whether prison doctors could have made
a quicker diagnosis.
   Mandela first complained about his health July 28 but was not
transferred to Tygerberg Hospital until two weeks later, the
government's Prisons Service has said.
   The government insists Mandela has been receiving the best
possible treatment. Strauss said doctors who have seen Mandela
include the Swiss president of the European Society of Pneumology,
Dr. Heinrich Hertzog.
   Meanwhile, The Star quoted Minister of Information Stoffel van
der Merwe on Saturday as saying security concerns were the main
reason Mandela remained imprisoned.
   ``There is no reason to punish him further for the crimes of the
1960s,'' van der Merwe told The Star. ``The government is now
concerned with ... what the (security) implications would be for
the country if he were released.''
   Mandela has been imprisoned since 1962. He is serving a life
sentence for sabotage and plotting to overthrow the white-led
government.
   Botha said Thursday that Mandela's release was under serious
consideration. He indicated the government was trying to persuade
Mandela to accept its condition that he renounce violence.
   The president has been making the same offer since 1986.
However, Mandela has said the government's 1960 decision to ban the
African National Congress, which operated peacefully at the time,
left him no option but to fight.
   Mandela says he will disavow violence only if the government
lifts its ban on his group, dismantles the apartheid system of
racial segregation and extends full political rights to the
nation's 26-million member black majority.
   The African National Congress, based in Lusaka, Zambia, is the
main black group attempting to undermine the government and
apartheid.
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated
society in which the blacks have no vote in national affairs. The 5
million whites control the economy and maintain separate districts,
schools and health services.
   The pro-government newspaper Beeld reported Saturday that
influential academics with close government contacts were urging
authorities to ``bring the Mandela issue to an end.''
   Kurt von Schirnding, the country's former U.N. ambassador and
head of the South Africa Foundation, a private research group, told
Beeld the government should try to avoid the appearance of ``bowing
to international pressure.''
   But he added, ``the issue must be resolved.''
   State-of-emergency regulations in effect since 1986 restrict
reporting about unrest, security force actions, treatment of
detainees, some forms of protest, and a broad range of statements
the government considers subversive. Enforcement of the regulations
has not been comprehensive.

   The owner of a honky-tonk made famous in the
movie ``Urban Cowboy'' filed for protection from his creditors one
day after he was to pay a $16 million judgment to the club's
namesake, country singer Mickey Gilley.
   Sherwood Cryer, owner of Gilley's Club in Pasadena, on Friday
filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy
Code. The petition said Cryer had $500,000 in assets and owed $18
million, including the judgment a Houston jury awarded Gilley last
month.
   The filing automatically froze any legal proceedings involving
Cryer or his company, which also filed.
   Gilley sued Cryer in April 1987 claiming he was not paid his
half of about $17 million in revenues received by Gilley's
Enterprises Inc., a company he and Cryer founded in the 1970s.
   Gilley claimed about $11 million of that money was missing.
   State District Judge David West ordered Cryer to pay Gilley
nearly $8 million in actual damages and $8 million in punitive
damages for breach of financial duties.
   Cryer also was ordered to change the name of the bar.
   On Thursday, Gilley filed a lawsuit in state district court
accusing Cryer of giving property, including corporate stock,
business enterprises, cash and inventory, to friends and relatives
to avoid paying the judgment.

   Two powerful earthquakes jolted the capital
Saturday and gave its 6 million residents a scare, officials said.
   Civil Defense officials said Saturday they had no reports of
injury or damage, but said they received dozens of phone calls from
worried residents.
   The first quake, measuring 4.7 on the Richter scale, struck
shortly after midnight Friday, said Victor Orbegozo, an earthquake
specialist for the Geophysical Institute of Peru. He said it was
centered 15 miles south of Lima.
   Another temblor briefly rocked the city late Saturday morning.
Orbegozo said it measured 4.5 with an epicenter 18 miles southeast
of Lima.
   He said two other quakes of lesser strength struck Saturday
afternoon, but seismic data had not been tabulated.
   Scientists believe that a fracture in the earth's crust 35 miles
below the Pacific coastline south of Lima had caused the quakes,
Orbegozo said.
   An earthquake registering 4.5 on the Richter scale, which
measures ground motion on a seismograph, can cause moderate to
considerable damage.

   A federal jury assessed the flamboyant Hunt
brothers more than $130 million in damages Saturday after finding
that they had conspired to corner the world silver market in the
late 1970s.
   The jury said the three Hunt brothers and two other defendants
had ruined the investments of the Peruvian government's mineral
marketing company, Minpeco S.A., by sending the price of silver to
artificial heights.
   All of the Hunts but one _ Lamar, 56, owner of the National
Football League's Kansas City Chiefs _ also were found to have
engaged in a pattern of racketeering activity to monopolize the
silver market. Since the case is a civil one, there would be no
criminal penalties attached to the finding.
   The verdict was a victory for Minpeco, which lost millions in
the volatile silver market, and a setback for the three sons of the
late Texas oilman H.L. Hunt.
   The jury found that International Metals Investment Co. and
Mahmoud Fustok had participated in the conspiracy with the three
Hunt brothers.
   Fustok is a prominent race horse-owner and brother-in-law of the
Saudi Arabian crown prince.
   None of the Hunts would comment, but a lawyer representing them,
Paul J. Curran, said, ``I'm disappointed and we disagree with the
jury.'' Asked if the defendants would appeal, he replied that the
jury's verdict ``is just the first step in the process.''
   A lawyer for Minpeco, Mark Cymrot, said the jury rewarded the
company's perseverance and ``faith in the U.S. system.''
   ``Minpeco is very happy,'' Cymrot said.
   Another lawyer for Minpeco, Shaun Corette, said he doubted the
verdict had opened the door for criminal charges against the Hunts,
since the statute of limitations would have run out.
   The findings came on the jury's sixth day of deliberations, and
only after it appeared that there might be no verdict at all. The
jury of three men and three women sent a note to Judge Morris E.
Lasker earlier Saturday, saying: ``Very sorry to say we have been
unable to reach a unanimous decision.''
   When Lasker asked them to read the findings they had reached,
the jury forewoman answered ``Yes'' to everything except the
racketeering charge against Lamar Hunt. She answered ``No'' to that.
   The judge ordered the jury to continue deliberations after it
failed to determine damages in the case. About two hours later, the
jury decided price increase the Hunts had engineered cost Minpeco
$63 million in short silver futures contracts.
   The jury also determined that the Hunts cost Minpeco $24.5
million in interest on loans to pay for its losses and $12.2
million in future trades. However, the jury also said the damages
should be offset by $33.4 million that Minpeco earned in profits on
silver it held during the same period.
   Because of the reacketeering charge, some of the figures are
trebled. Cymrot estimated the damages at $134 million, but Curran
said he calculated them to be $132.6 million.
   Minpeco had claimed that Lamar and his two brothers _ Nelson
Bunker Hunt, 62; and William Herbert Hunt, 59, who also has
extensive real estate holdings, conspired unsuccessfully with
several Middle East businessmen to corner the silver market.
   Three others, two Arab sheiks and a Lebanese businessman, are
living outside the United States and did not challenge Minpeco's
court papers.
   Minpeco claimed the conspiracy violated anti-trust, commodity
exchange and civil racketeering laws. It sought treble damages,
some $450 million, through the allegations that the conspiracy
constituted a racketeering enterprise that used wire and mail fraud
to achieve its aims.
   Because it was a civil lawsuit, Minpeco had to prove its case
only by a preponderance of the evidence rather than the ``beyond a
reasonable doubt'' standard required of criminal prosecutions.
   Six financial institutions originally named in the suit,
including some of Wall Street's biggest names, settled out of court
for a total of nearly $65 million before the trial began. Those
defendants included Merrill Lynch & Co., Prudential-Bache
Securities, E.F. Hutton & Co. Inc., Banque Populaire Suisse,
ContiCommodity Services Inc. and AML Futures.
   Testimony during the trial, which began in February, sometimes
sounded like the script from a network miniseries. Witnesses
described meetings at exotic locales around the world, and the high
finance world of Swiss bankers, Arab sheiks and Wall Street
commodities traders.
   Lawyers for Minpeco charged the Hunts and their co-defendants
were responsible for the sharp rise in silver prices from about $9
an ounce to more than $50 an ounce between September 1979 and
January 1980.
   Minpeco claimed it lost more than $100 million due to
skyrocketing silver prices that fell back to about $10 an ounce in
March 1980 when the Hunts failed to meet a margin call for $100
million in silver future contracts.
   Minpeco had a large short position in the silver futures market,
which meant it would make money on dropping silver prices and lose
money on rising prices.

<TEXT>
   One of four Andean condors en route to a
wilderness area for an experiment on how to reintroduce endangered
California condors into the wild died Saturday.
   The other three zoo-bred Andean condors were safely placed in
secret holding pens in Los Padres National Forest, and more will be
brought to the area in October, said Joe Dowhan of the U.S. Fish
and Wildlife Service.
   ``This was a real shock, especially because the first three
birds came through well,'' said Dowhan. ``But except for everybody
being down right now, it has very little effect on the program.''
   The Andean birds, all female, are being used to test techniques
biologists hope to use to begin returning the California condor to
nature.
   The Andean condor was chosen because it's the closest relative
to the California condor. The Andean condors also are endangered
but they number in the thousands.
   Scientists are doing the experiment to see how birds hatched in
captivity adapt to freedom, fending for themselves in a region
without native birds of their species as role models.
   The four Andean condors were transported in airline-style animal
shipping crates.
   Two came from the San Diego Wild Animal Park. One was from the
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service center in Patuxent, Md., and the one
that died came from the Los Angeles Zoo, Dowhan said.
   ``We're not sure why this particular bird died. We discovered it
died just before we released it. So it happened somewhere in
transit,'' said Dowhan.
   The 3- and 4-month-old birds will spend several weeks in mesh
enclosures in the forest 75 miles northeast of Los Angeles.
   Scientists will prepare them for their first flights over the
dry mountains and foothills that once supported a large population
of California condors, but whose numbers have dwindled to 28, all
in captivity.
   When the Andean birds are able to fly, sometime in November,
scientists will fit them with radio monitoring gear, release them,
and monitor their progress.

   President Lazarus Salii was found shot to
death in his home Saturday, the second president in a row to die by
gunfire in this tiny, isolated Pacific island chain that has been
split by a dispute over a proposed self-governance agreement with
the United States.
   It was not immediately known if Salii, 54, had killed himself or
was shot by an unknown assailant. Police Officer Theodore Obak at
first said an unknown gunman had fired the shot, but a government
spokesman said later that a gun was found and suicide had not been
ruled out.
   Chester Pavlovski, the U.S. State Department's representative in
Palau, said investigators ``are going along the line it's
self-inflicted. There are indications that's what it was.''
Pavlovski said he had no details on what evidence pointed to
suicide.
   Vice President Thomas Remengesau Sr., who also was Palau's
minister of justice, was sworn in as the new president. Remengesau,
57, will serve out the remainder of Salii's term, which ends later
this year.
   Palau, about 4,500 miles southwest of Hawaii and 600 miles east
of the Philippines, has been beset by economic and political
problems. The chain, with a population of 15,000, has been
administered by the United States since the end of World War II.
   Salii was elected in August 1985 to succeed Haruo Remeliik, the
country's first elected president, who was gunned down outside his
home two months earlier.
   Three men were convicted for the crime, but were later acquitted
on appeal. Two of the three were relatives of a political opponent
of Remeliik.
   Bonifacio Basilius, a special assistant to the president, said
Salii was sitting alone in his house while his wife, driver and
maid were eating lunch outside.
   The three heard what they thought was a shot about 1:30 p.m. The
driver checked the grounds of the house and found nothing unusual.
   About 20 minutes later, Mrs. Salii went into the house and found
her husband, shot once in the head, Basilius said.He was pronounced
dead at a hospital.
   Police found a .357-caliber Magnum revolver and a spent bullet,
he said.
   Asked if the death was a suicide, Basilius said, ``We're not
ruling out anything.'' He declined to comment further.
   Koror, the capital, was quiet.
   ``The people are shocked, but are very calm. There is no
problem. Everything is under control,'' Basilius said. ``Everywhere
you go, the people are talking in hushed tones.''
   Both Salii and Remeliik were strong supporters of a proposed
Compact of Free Association with the United States, which would
provide for self-governance and continued U.S. economic aid.
   In the wake of World War II, the United Nations placed several
groups of Pacific Islands, all previously held by Japan, in a
unique strategic trusteeship administered by the United States. In
the past decade, all of the island groups but Palau have approved
plans for self-governance.
   Since 1983, Palauans have voted several times on the proposed
Compact of Free Association. The proposal includes giving U.S.
warships the right to visit the islands.
   Palauan courts have held that the compact conflicts with
anti-nuclear provisions of Palau's constitution, since those
warships could contain nuclear weapons. The constitution provides
that the anti-nuclear provisions could be overridden by a 75
percent majority vote. However, in several compact plebiscites, the
highest voter approval has been 73 percent.
   Last September, the father of a man associated with a group that
opposes the compact and wants to retain the anti-nuclear clause in
the constitution was killed. Several anti-compact activists said
they were threatened by compact supporters.
   Palau has long been regarded as a possible fallback site in
event the United States loses its military bases in the
Philippines. One of the islands in the group, Peleliu, was a major
battleground in World War II.
   The U.S. State Department said FBI and other American law
enforcement officials were present in Palau at the time of Salii's
death in connection with a law training program.
   ``They are cooperating with the Ministry of Justice in Palau in
the investigation of Salii's death,'' the State Department said.

   Afghan rebel leaders said Saturday
they expect continued economic and military aid from Pakistan
despite the death of President Mohammed Zia ul-Haq.
   Zia, the U.S. ambassador to Pakistan and 28 other people
perished in the crash Wednesday of a C-130 military plane.
   Anti-communist rebels have been fighting Afghanistan's
Soviet-backed government for 10 years. About 3 million Afghan
refugees have fled into northern Pakistan and that is where most of
the rebel organizations have their bases.
   Zia, a staunch Moslem, was a strong supporter of the Afghan
insurgents.
   Gulbaddin Hekmatyar, a rebel leader who had close ties with Zia,
said that after the president's death ``I personally met with
senior people (in the Pakistani government) who assured me the
policy will not change.''
   Ahmad Gailani, chairman of the seven-party rebel alliance, said
he did not expect any major change.
   ``We never put all our hopes in one person, in one country,'' he
said. ``Our support is from God almighty and he will support us in
the future.''
   But some Pakistani opposition leaders have said Zia's policies
prolonged the Afghan war and prevented the refugees from returning
home.
   The Pakistan Peoples' Party, a significant contender in the Nov.
16 general election, wants a program to quickly return the refugees
to their homeland. It says they have strained Pakistan's economy
and there is resentment in northern Pakistan by local residents who
say they have lost their jobs and businesses because of the
refugees.
   Zabihullah Mojaddiddi, vice president of an ``interim''
government organized by the rebels, said, ``We don't see any chance
of the Pakistan Peoples' Party winning an election. We hope not.''
   A car bomb exploded Saturday in Kabul, the Afghan capital,
wounding six people, according to Tass, the official Soviet news
agency.
   In a dispatch filed in Moscow, Tass quoted the Afghan news
agency Bakhtar as reporting the bomb exploded at about 11 a.m. on
one of Kabul's main streets. Kabul has been the target of an
increasing number of bombings and rocket attacks since Soviet
troops began withdrawing from Afghanistan under an agreement signed
in Geneva on April 14 between Afghanistan and Pakistan. The Afghan
rebels did not participate in the negotiations or accept the accord.
   The Soviet Union sent troops into Afghanistan in December 1979
to help the Marxist government and had an estimated 100,000
military personnel in the country when the withdrawal began. The
withdrawal is to be completed by Feb. 15, and on Sunday the Soviets
said they had met their commitment to withdraw half the force by
Aug. 15.
   They also accused Pakistan of violating the accords by
continuing to aid the rebels but said the Soviet troops would be
withdrawn as scheduled.

   Michael Dukakis said Saturday that
George Bush is taking the Republican Party ``farther and farther
away from the mainstream'' and questioned the Republican vice
president's vow to create 30 million jobs if elected president.
   The Democratic presidential candidate linked up with his vice
presidential running mate, Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, for a visit with
Lady Bird Johnson at the LBJ Ranch.
   After having breakfast with Mrs. Johnson, Dukakis paid tribute
to her and saluted late husband for ``the passion and comitment he
had to people, especially to people who needed a helping hand and a
leg up on the road to opportunity.''
   Then they all visited Lyndon B. Johnson's grave, moving quietly
beneath giant oak trees.
   Dukakis never referred to President John F. Kennedy by name but
recalled that ``another son of Massachusetts'' won the presidency
in 1960 with Johnson as his running mate.
   It was an obvious effort to keep alive the Boston-Austin
connection that Democrats hope will help them at the polls.
   At a news conference at the 250-acre ranch, Dukakis said Bush's
choice of conservative Sen. Dan Quayle of Indiana as his running
mate signaled an effort to bring GOP policies further to the right.
   ``My sense is that the Republican Party is moving farther and
farther away from the mainstream while Senator Bentsen and I are
campaigning on Main Street,'' Dukakis said.
   The Democratic ticket mates also appeared together at a rally in
nearby Johnson City before splitting up. Dukakis headed to a county
fair in Lebanon, Tenn., on his way home to Boston while Bentsen
traveled to a fund-raising dinner in Florida.
   At the Wilson County Fair in Lebanon, Dukakis inspected
prize-winning cattle, fed milk to a calf and rode on a mule-pulled
cart.
   Bentsen will fly to Boston on Monday to attend a national
security briefing at Dukakis' home, to be conducted by CIA Director
William Webster.
   Both were on the road during the Republican National Convention;
Dukakis campaigned in several states while Bentsen stayed close to
home in Texas except for one quick trip to Arkansas.
   On Saturday they continued to pound away at the two issues they
have accused Bush of ducking: the federal trade and budget deficits.
   And Dukakis was skeptical of Bush's declaration that he could
create 30 million new jobs if elected.
   ``Harold Wilson once said never put a date and a number in the
same sentence,'' Dukakis said. `I think it's good advice. ... I
don't see any evidence that this Republican ticket even understands
how to create jobs, especially in those parts of the country that
are hurting and hurting badly.''
   He declined to predict how many new jobs he could help create as
president.
   Dukakis predicted the Democratic ticket would carry Texas,
considered a Bush stronghold until Dukakis tapped Bentsen to run
with him.
   Bentsen, in a message to his fellow Texans, praised Dukakis'
integrity and record of economic development.
   ``This man from New England really talks our language,'' Bentsen
said. ``And that language is one that is understood across the
country.''
   Dukakis and Bentsen continued to criticize Quayle by mentioning
Bentsen's leadership role in the passage of several major bills,
including a trade bill President Reagan is scheduled to sign this
week.
   ``On that trade bill this administration was no help
whatsoever,'' Bentsen said. ``I'll bet they'll try very hard to do
that,'' the senator said when asked if he thought Republicans would
try to take credit for the bill.
   There was a somewhat awkward moment at the ranch when Dukakis,
with Mrs. Johnson standing behind him, discussed his opposition to
the Vietnam War. President Johnson escalated the U.S. presence in
Vietnam.
   ``It was a war that divided this country, that in some ways
we're still recovering from,'' Dukakis said.
   Dukakis and Bentsen, accompanied by their wives and Mrs.
Johnson, were greeted by Mrs. Johnson when they arrived at an
airstrip on the ranch. She served them a country breakfast of
bacon, eggs, grits, biscuits, peaches and figs.
   ``I have great confidence and great pride and high hopes for
these four folks,'' Mrs. Johnson told reporters gathered outside
her home on the bank of the Pedernales River. Hereford cattle, a
favorite of the late president, roamed across a road as Dukakis'
motorcade drove off.

   Iowa cattle farmers in desperate need of
hay to supplement drought-depleted supplies would love to accept
Idaho's offer of help, but few farmers can take the time off to go
and get it.
   The Iowa Farm Bureau is having trouble finding volunteers to
travel to Idaho and harvest hay because many farmers can't leave
home for a week to 10 days. The drought of '88 has forced them to
haul water and feed to cattle that normally would be grazing and
drinking on their own, said Don Murdock, a regional manager for the
bureau.
   A group of cattle farmers in parched southern Iowa is to leave
Monday for a 37-hour bus ride to Orofino, Idaho. But Murdock said
Saturday that while transportation, housing and meals all have been
donated, he still has only 20 farmers who can go. He would like to
get at least 40.
   Murdock said the Idaho Farm Bureau offered unlimited hay to
drought-stricken farmers if they would supply the labor for the
harvest.
   The venture is a cooperative effort of the farm bureaus in Idaho
and Iowa, with Greyhound donating a bus for the trip, the
Burlington Northern railroad donating freight space for the hay and
three banks putting up cash for meals along the way.
   Murdock said that while he is having difficulty finding farm
workers with the time to spare for the harvest, farmers were
extremely grateful for the offer.
   ``I have never worked on a project that has received the
acclamation, pleasure and impact this has,'' he said. ``People
become emotional when they learn this has been donated.''

   At the main gate of Szczecin's
sprawling, strikebound port, a steady stream of women pushing baby
carriages and carrying buckets of food has replaced the normal
caravan of rumbling trucks.
   The wives of the longshoremen who went on strike Wednesday are
visiting about 2,000 men holed up on the docks of this Baltic city
on the Odra River near the East German border.
   ``We've got enough food stockpiled to last us a week,'' said a
beaming worker in his late 20s.
   Supporters of Solidarity, to which the men belong, carried bread
and vegetables through gates festooned with the flags and banners
of the outlawed independent union federation.
   Shortly after the strike began, negotiations broke down between
management and workers, who remain steadfast in their demand that
the government grant legal status to their union.
   In 1981, the communist government arrested many Solidarity
leaders in a military crackdown. Solidarity was outlawed in 1982.
   Solidarity leaders said the harbor strike and a walkout by the
city's transit workers arose from growing dissatisfaction with the
policies of state-run unions and anger over Poland's deteriorating
economy.
   The strikes have idled port operations and brought city transit
services almost to a standstill.
   At the July Manifesto mine in Jastrzebie in the southwest,
spirits also were high. Strikers sitting on makeshift wooden
benches spoke bravely.
   ``We won't go back to work until we get a second trade union,''
shouted one miner tanned by the hot summer sun. ``We will stay here
until the end,'' said another. Still others cheered.
   ``We believe the government will have to recognize us because we
are in the heart of Poland's industry,'' said miner Jan Golec.
   Management for the first time Saturday allowed three priests
into the mine, and a Mass was planned Sunday. The strikers erected
a 6-foot white cross with a picture of Pope John Paul II in front
of the building where the strike committee meets.
   Mine officials also permitted workers to buy cigarettes, food
and bottled drinks at a lunchstand inside the mine.
   Meanwhile, some miners expressed bitterness about their economic
plight. ``A miner is forced to work Saturday and Sunday to be able
to support his family,'' said Jerzy Nowosielski, of the mine's
strike committee.
   Poland's new wave of labor unrest began Tuesday, when coal
miners at the July Manifesto mine declared their occupation strike.
   The mood quickly spread to Szczecin, a city of 395,000 and the
country's largest port city after Gdansk.
   ``The strike began spontaneously, when we got our paychecks last
week,'' said Edward Radziewicz, a forklift operator who heads the
Interfactory Strike Committee representing dock and transit
workers. ``It became very clear that we had no one to stand up for
our interest and that we were on our own.''
   Workers here said they had no faith in the official union's
ability or desire to represent them and complained that rampant
inflation has cutting into their buying power.
   ``The union represents management and its interest and not us,''
said a young dockworker who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   A 50-year-old crane operator said he could barely make ends meet
on his salary.
   ``After 30 years on the dock I get paid $67 a month. A
black-and-white television costs $156 dollars. We got an 11 percent
pay increase recently, but prices went up by more than 40
percent,'' he said.
   Transit workers at a nearby bus depot had similar views.
   ``Reinstatement of Solidarity is the first step in setting up
further talks,'' said Romuald Ziolkowski, head of the depot's
strike committee. ``We can negotiate wages later.''
   He said 1,800 transit workers were on strike and were posted at
the depot's gates, which were blocked by buses.
   Thousands of residents in outlying apartment complexes Saturday
trudged past empty bus stops into town to shop. State-run food
stores said sugar and flour were quickly disappearing from store
shelves.
   The run on staples indicated that residents were bracing for the
possibility of more strikes and shortages.
   City officials urged factory and tourist buses in service to aid
stranded commuters. But the transit strike has been a boon for the
city's taxi drivers.
   ``Business is flourishing,'' said one driver in downtown
Szczecin.

   A hand grenade exploded Saturday night near
a crowded sidewalk cafe and toy store in downtown Haifa, wounding
at least 25 people, including seven members of one family, police
and witnesses said.
   Fifteen Arabs were detained for questioning after the explosion
at 9:15 p.m. in the center of this northern port city, police
reported.
   Hospital officials said Dan Meir, 8, lost parts of both legs and
suffered head injuries and his 2-year-old brother Yonathan was
wounded in the stomach.
   The boys' parents, their 6-year-old sister Keren, and
grandparents who were visiting from France suffered minor injuries.
   Keren told people at the Rothschild Hospital the boys were
pointing at toys they wanted their grandparents to buy when there
was an explosion, witnesses said. At the hospital she jumped from
the stretcher to hug her grandfather as he was being carried into
the emergency room.
   A police source said the blast was caused by a hand grenade that
was either thrown or rolled along the sidewalk.
   ``Suddenly there was an explosion. Small children flew into the
air,'' said David Taub, 32, an art student who was standing near
the cafe.
   ``People were in shock. We tried to cover their wounds. We took
off pieces of our own clothing and ripped table cloths to tie their
wounds,'' he told The Associated Press.
   Doctors at the Rothschild and Rambam hospitals said four of the
victims suffered severe or moderate injuries and the others were
slightly wounded.
   The police source, speaking with the condition he not be
identified, said three Arabs were seized as they ran from the scene
and 12 other Arabs also were detained for questioning.
   The grenade blew up between the toy store Land of Wonders and
the crowded Cafe Kapulski in a pedestrian mall.
   There were pools of blood, pieces of bloody clothing and a pair
of a child's sandals along the sidewalk.
   Scores of anxious relatives crowded the waiting room at the
Rothschild Hospital.
   Bracha Ornan, 48, said she was waiting for her son's fiancee to
be treated. ``There was glass everywhere,'' she said. ``I grabbed
her (the fiancee) and ran.'' Mrs. Ornan suffered slight cuts from
flying glass.
   The attack increased tension in Haifa, a city where 223,000 Jews
and 20,000 Arabs live.

   Forecasters at the National Weather Service
hurricane center were watching two tropical depressions that formed
in the Atlantic Ocean on Saturday.
   One formed at midday about 150 miles southeast of the
southernmost Cape Verde islands, off the African coast, and was
moving west at 15 to 20 mph. It was expected to continue that
movement and gradually strengthen, the weather service said.
   The depressions's highest sustained winds were estimated at
about 30 mph, with higher gusts in squalls.
   The second depression was just south of St. Vincent in the
Windward Islands, which are in the Lesser Antilles, and was moving
west at near 15 mph. Highest sustained winds were estimated at 30
mph, but the depression was expected to strengthen as it moved into
the Eastern Caribbean on Sunday.
   The weather service urged small boats in the Windward Islands to
stay in port.
   Depressions are upgraded to named tropical storms when their
sustained winds reach 39 mph and to hurricanes when winds hit 74
mph. There have been three tropical storms so far in the 1988
Atlantic Ocean hurricane season, but none reached hurricane
strength.
   Meanwhile, a tropical wave _ a weather system weaker than a
tropical depression _ was moving northwest Saturday after dumping
almost 6{ inches of rain in West Palm Beach on Friday. Showers and
thunderstorms from the wave were expected to leave as much as four
inches of rain over parts of Central and North Florida by Saturday
night.

   Israeli leftists demonstrated Saturday near a
desert prison camp to protest the detention of thousands of
Palestinians held without trial for up to six months.
   In Haifa, 25 people were wounded when a hand grenade exploded
near a toy store and sidewalk cafe. Arab doctors said three
Palestinians were wounded in clashes with Israeli troops in the
occupied Gaza Strip and the army reported Israeli soldiers killed
three armed Palestinian guerrillas in southern Lebanon.
   Police and witnesses said the grenade blew up in downtown Haifa
at 9:15 p.m. Among the wounded were seven members of one family.
   Hospital officials said Dan Meir, 8, suffered severe leg and
head injuries and his 2-year-old brother was wounded in the stomach.
   Slightly injured were their sister, 6-year-old Keren, parents,
and grandparents who were visiting from France, they said.
   Police said 15 Arabs were arrested for questioning in the
northern port city.
   Meanwhile, Israel radio said an Arab from the West Bank village
of Tamun died Saturday, two days after he was shot by soldiers who
fired at villagers attacking the troops with knives. It identified
the victim as Saoud Abdallah, 22. The army said it could not
confirm the report.
   At least 249 Palestinians and four Israelis have been killed
since the Arab uprising began in December.
   The violence broke out in the Gaza Strip hours after the army
lifted curfews in seven of the strip's eight refugee camps, ending
five days of restrictions imposed to quell widespread rioting.
   In its report on the action in southern Lebanon, the army said
soldiers shot and killed three heavily armed Arab guerrillas who
were on their way to Israel to carry out an attack. It said the
Israeli troops suffered no casualties.
   The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, a pro-Syrian
PLO faction, claimed responsibility. The group said its guerrillas
raided an Israeli border settlement before being killed.
   About 200 Israelis, including three parliament deputies,
demonstrated near the Ketziot detention camp in the Negev Desert,
said organizer Zahava Galon.
   The protesters demanded that the nearly 3,000 Palestinians held
by Israel for up to six months without trial in so-called
administrative detention either be tried or released. About 2,100
administrative detainees are held at Ketziot.
   ``Anyone who is suspect should be brought to court and in front
of a judge,'' Dedi Zucker, a legislator of the left-wing Citizens
Right Movement, told The Associated Press in a telephone interview.
   Ketziot, a camp of open-sided tents, was erected several months
after the Palestinian uprising in the Israeli-occupied West Bank
and Gaza Strip broke out last Dec. 8. Thousands of Palestinian
activists have been arrested in the past eight months.
   The Israeli demonstrators also demanded improved prison
conditions and called for a commission of inquiry into a prison
riot last week in which two inmates were killed and one wounded.
   Ketziot inmates have complained they are exposed for many hours
a day to the brutal desert sun and not given enough water.
   The protest, organized by groups opposed to Israel's occupation,
was staged at a gas station about three miles from Ketziot after
security forces barred protesters from approaching the camp.
   Demonstrators released about 100 balloons at the gas station.
``We wanted the detainees to see that people are demonstrating on
their behalf,'' said Ms. Galon.
   About a dozen followers of the right-wing Tehiya Party staged a
counter- demonstration nearby, calling for all of the leftists to
be imprisoned at Ketziot. They also demanded the deportation of all
administrative detainees, Ms. Galon said.
   In Gaza City, Arab youths shouting ``Allahu Akhbar'' (God is
great) blocked main roads with burning tires. They also stoned army
patrols.
   Two 18-year-old Palestinians were shot during clashes in the
Rafah refugee camp near the Egyptian border, hospital officials
said. At Shifa Hospital in Gaza City, a 68-year-old man was treated
for a gunshot wound in the right foot, doctors said.
   An 85-year-old Gaza City woman suffered multiple fractions in
the leg and foot. Shifa doctors quoted the woman as saying she was
beaten by soldiers after trying to stop them from arresting her son.
   The army said the guerrillas seeking to infiltrate Israel were
intercepted just north of the Israeli-Lebanese border fence in the
central section of Israel's self-declared security zone.
   The Israeli unit spotted the guerrillas around midnight Friday
south of the village Maroun a-Ras and opened fire, killing all
three, the army said.
   The last reported infiltration attempt from Lebanon occurred May
10 when Israeli troops shot and killed a Lebanese guerrilla in the
security zone, a six-to-10-mile buffer strip north of the
international border.
   Israel set up the security zone in 1985 after withdrawing the
bulk of its troops from Lebanon, ending a three-year occupation.

   Vice President George Bush would defeat Gov.
Michael Dukakis by 51 percent to 42 percent if the presidential
election were held now, according to a Newsweek poll released
Saturday.
   The poll of 1,000 registered voters, conducted by telephone
Thursday and Friday, found Bush riding a favorable reaction to the
Republican convention, which concluded Thursday.
   The poll found that 43 percent of those contacted said they were
more likely to vote for Bush because of what they saw or read
during the convention. Fifty percent said they were more likely to
vote for Bush after watching the vice president's speech on
Thursday.
   The poll, which has a margin of error of plus or minus 4
percentage points, found the registered voters thought Bush would
be better than Dukakis at keeping the country out of war, creating
good economic conditions, dealing with the drug problem and
reducing crime.
   Dukakis was perceived as stronger at helping families and
children, it said.
   Thirty-six percent said Bush's choice of Indiana Sen. Dan Quayle
as his running mate made them more likely to vote Republican, while
33 percent said it made them less likely to do so.
   The poll showed that 74 percent said their opinions were not
less favorable toward Quayle because he chose to serve in the
National Guard during the Vietnam War, the poll said.

   Crack cocaine addicts desperate for money to
support their habits are breaking into already needy churches in
north Dade County and stealing everything from children's toys to
religious icons.
   Thirty-five churches in the county have been burglarized an
average of three times each this year.
   ``We are attributing 90 percent of these robberies to drug
addicts looking to turn over a quick buck on anything they can
steal for a piece of crack ... they don't care about the sacredness
of the church,'' said Metro Special Investigations Unit detective
Don White.
   Besides toys and religious articles, other items stolen have
included toilet paper, speakers, microphones, amplifiers, food,
typewriters, telephones, adding machines and yard tools.
   Most of the churches are within walking distance of crack
houses, White said, adding that the number might be even higher
than reported because many ministers have told him they fear their
insurance premiums will go up if they report burglaries.
   New Mount Zion Church has been hit 20 times this year, but
Deacon Danny Swain has reported only one.
   ``What can we do?'' Swain asked. ``Burglars break the windows,
and every time we replace one, they just break it again. That costs
about $100 to $200 each time.
   ``When the burglars hit the day-care center in June, they stole
toys and $200 worth of food and milk,'' he said. ``Can you imagine
stealing things that belong to children?''
   Deacon Herbert Long of Bethany Seventh-day Adventist said his
parishioners dug deep to put in a $3,500 alarm system in July, but
that cut into the church's limited resources.
   ``Before July, we had deacons taking turns in twos to sit up at
the church between 1 a.m. and 6 a.m. to see if they could spot the
thief,'' Long said. ``He would always strike afterward when the
deacons would leave.''

   A group of Georgia youngsters traveling through
Southern California on a trip won by a generous frequent flier
visited San Diego Zoo on Saturday and headed for the Mexican border
town of Tijuana.
   ``The kids are just ecstatic,'' said Clark Howard, a retired
travel agent who traveled 26,338 miles on 68 flights in 48 days to
meet the requirements of an Eastern Airlines promotion for a free
ride West.
   The 30-member group includes 25 children ages 9 to 15 from an
Atlanta boys' and girls' club and the local Big Brothers program
and five chaperones. The group toured Hollywood, hit the beaches
and visited Disneyland.
   ``The zoo is especially interesting for the kids,'' said Howard.
``Yesterday, they got to see the make-believe animals at
Disneyland. Today, they're seeing the real thing.''
   Next stop was a trip across the border to Tijuana.
   ``Many of these kids have never been anywhere and have never
seen any culture other than their own,'' Howard said.
   Howard, 33, who retired after selling a chain of travel agencies
and now hosts a radio travel show in Atlanta, took part in the
Eastern Airline promotion with the children's trip in mind.
   The airline offered 60 free tickets to anyone making at least 60
flights totaling more than 25,000 miles in 60 days as part of its
60th anniversary celebration.
   Howard paid $2,110 out of his own pocket for the 68 flights he
took between May 6 and June 25.

   Republican George Bush and the young, Vietnam-era senator he
hopes will share the White House with him pitched horseshoes
Saturday and Bush said the flap over his running mate's National
Guard membership is a ``tempest in a teapot.''
   The Democratic contenders sought political solace at the grave
site of Lyndon B. Johnson.
   Despite the GOP controversy vice presidential candidate Dan
Quayle, Bush received some favorable news from a Newsweek poll
released Saturday. It said Bush would defeat Gov. Michael Dukakis
by 51 percent to 42 percent if the presidential election were held
now.
   The poll of 1,000 registered voters found that 43 percent of
those contacted said they were more likely to vote for Bush because
of what they saw or read during last week's Republican convention.
Fifty percent said they were more likely to vote for Bush after
watching the vice president's acceptance speech on Thursday.
   The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage
points.
   Bush joined Quayle during an appearance at the Ohio State
Fairgrounds to answer questions about the Indiana senator joining
the National Guard during the Vietnam War.
   The current vice president said his reasoning in selecting
Quayle as his running mate ``was very sound, and the American
people are going to see that, loud and clear.''
   Bush conceding that questions about Quayle had overshadowed
their campaign plans, but declared, ``I think it will turn out to
be a tempest in a teapot.''
   He said news media attention to the questions reminded him of
``bluefish, when they're swimming around, all in a frenzy.''
   Quayle defended himself for the second straight day at an
impromptu news conference and also said he had not misled Bush
campaign officials in talks leading to his selection.
   ``I told the Bush campaign there was nothing embarrassing in my
military record, and I'm sticking to it,'' he said.
   On a lighter note at the fair, both Bush and Quayle pitched a
few horseshoes along with contestants in the state contest. Bush,
who pitches horseshoes for relaxation at his home in Washington,
scored a ringer after several tries. Quayle did not.
   It was still early in the day when Michael Dukakis signaled his
determination to fight hard to get Texas and other Southern states
in the Democratic column on Election Day.
   Running mate Lloyd Bentsen confided to reporters that the Greek
immigrant's son spooned picante sauce onto his grits _ ``seeming to
like it'' _ during breakfast at the LBJ Ranch.
   Dukakis was stopping off in Nashville, Tenn., en route back home
to Boston for the night. Bentsen was swinging through Florida on
his return home to Washington.
   After breakfast, Dukakis and Bentsen and their wives drove over
to the bank of the Pedernales River where former President Johnson
is buried in a family plot shaded by huge live oak trees.
   ``I have great confidence and great pride and high hopes for
these four folks,'' Johnson's widow, Lady Bird, told reporters.
   Reporters were kept well back while Mrs. Johnson and her guests
strolled near the grave.
   Earlier, Dukakis had saluted the man buried there for ``the
passion and commitment he had to people, especially to people who
needed a helping hand and a leg up on the road to opportunity.''
   There was a somewhat awkward moment when Dukakis, with Mrs.
Johnson standing behind him, reminded reporters of his opposition
to the same Vietnam War that Johnson had escalated.
   ``It was a war that divided this country, that in some ways
we're still recovering from,'' Dukakis said.
   There was a certain irony given the furor surrounding Quayle's
acknowledgement that he sought assistance _ needed or not _ to get
into the Indiana National Guard in 1969 while many other young men
entering combat in Vietnam. The controversy over the war ultimately
forced Johnson to decide against seeking re-election in 1968.
   Quayle has said he is and was then, at age 22, a supporter of
U.S. involvement in the war. He also has said there should have
been more of an all-out effort to win the conflict.
   Although he figuratively passed the GOP political baton to Bush
last week at the party's New Orleans convention, President Reagan
gave it another hearty wave Saturday.
   In his weekly radio address, broadcast from his mountain
hideaway in California, Reagan said Bush as vice president never
held back from straight talk.
   ``George has always given me straight-from-the-shoulder advice
and counsel on how we could advance our vision for the future,''
said Reagan. ``And he's always been candid with me when we
disagreed.''
   Reagan gave no examples.

   People often ask Vernell Sellars if he's
coming or going.
   Sellars has welded together two front ends of junked Honda
Civics, creating a single car with two engines, two steering
wheels, two sets of headlights _ two of almost everything. Separate
keys crank each end.
   Both cars _ 1980 and 1982 models that had wrecked back ends _
were sawed in half just behind the front doors. Since Civics are
front-wheel driven, building the new creation posed few problems.
   ``You can drive it either way; it's legal,'' said Sellars, 49,
noting the Secretary of State's office inspected the dual vehicle
and granted him license plates. ``You can do figure-eights. You can
do doughnuts. You can do anything you want.''
   Sellars, who owns a salvage business, said he and employee Dan
Watkins started the car this spring and finished it in mid-May for
about $2,500.
   ``It blows people's minds,'' said Sellars of the black,
standard-transmission car with light-blue interior and
air-conditioning. ``People can't believe what they're seeing.

   Thousands of youths packed a city street
Saturday for a rally called to protest the military's selection of
a presidential candidate.
   The protest, which was authorized by the right-wing military
government of President Augusto Pinochet, was peaceful and festive.
Participants danced, waved banners and chanted anti-government
slogans while police remained several blocks away.
   Journalists estimated the crowd, which filled several city
blocks, to number about 25,000.
   From a colorfully painted stage with the snow-capped Andes as a
backdrop, opposition youth leaders urged the crowd to vote ``no''
in the upcoming referendum. ``If he (Pinochet) doesn't leave, we're
going to throw him out,'' declared Yerko Ljubetic, leader of a
group called Youth Movement for a No Vote.
   ``Our triumph must be at the ballot box and also in the streets,
the plazas and the neighborhoods,'' he said.
   The government plans a yes-or-no vote in early October on a
single presidential candidate to be picked by the commanders of the
army, navy, air force and national police. Pinochet, who is army
chief, is expected to be the nominee.
   If the military-picked candidate wins the referendum, the
candidate will begin an eight-year term in March. If a mayority of
voters rejects the candidate, open elections will be held in 1990.
   Pinochet, 72, led a coup in September 1973 that ousted the late
President Salvador Allende, an elected Marxist. His government does
not include opposition representation.
   Another opposition rally, expected to be larger, is planned for
Sept. 4. It has not yet received government authorization, but
organizers said it will be held even if permission is refused.

   A baby sitter and a young boy drowned
when a rain-swollen creek swept their car off a bridge, but two men
who tried to warn the victims managed to pluck a second child from
the water.
   ``They're heroes in my book,'' said Detective Mike Bare of the
Indiana State Police. ``It's fair to say they risked their lives,
both of them.''
   The body of Mary Wilhelm, 41, of Oldenburg was found Saturday
about 4 miles downstream from the site of the accident. Rescuers
would resume searching Sunday for the body of 4-year-old Matthew
Zins, also of Oldenburg, police said.
   Mrs. Wilhelm had been baby sitting with the boy and his
6-year-old sister, Sarah Zins, and was taking them home on a rural
road about 8 p.m. when a rainstorm flooded Salt Creek.
   Two friends, Randy Macyauski and William D. Effing, happened to
be watching the flooded creek and tried to warn the car to stop as
4 feet of water gushed over a primitive bridge, police said.
   After the vehicle plunged into the stream, Macyauski ran
downstream and dove in to rescue the girl, who had climbed out a
window of the car. Effing hung out over the creek on a tree limb
and tried to grab the woman and boy, but the limb broke and Effing
was swept downstream a few hundred feet before he managed to climb
out.
   The bridge consisted only of a concrete slab, Bare said, adding
that most residents of the area know to use caution with such
bridges during sudden storms.
   ``In the flash flood conditions such as existed last night, it's
not at all uncommon for the water to go over the top of the slab,''
he said Saturday. ``We've had several instances in the past where
cars have been washed off.''
   The accident occurred about 6 miles north of Batesville, in
southeastern Indiana.
   ``These slabs (bridges) are characteristically found on roads
that are quite lightly traveled,'' Bare said. ``This area is the
very definition of rural.''

   Military leaders met in emergency session
and troops moved across the southern region of Silesia on Saturday
after workers at four more coal mines joined nationwide strikes to
demand legalization of Solidarity.
   Poland's leader, Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, and the national
Defense Committee reached ``appropriate decisions ... in connection
with the present threats,'' the state-run news agency PAP said.
   The brief dispatch gave no hint about what the government
planned to do about the strongest challenge to communist
authorities since Solidarity, the independent union federation, was
crushed in 1981.
   Opposition activists said police and army were on the move in
Silesia, where the 10 coal mine strikes were centered.
   Unusual police movements also were reported in Krakow and Nowa
Huta, the scene of a cripping steel strike last spring.
   ``There are helicopters flying over Jastrzebie and many army
units near. Police are also erecting roadblocks at the towns'
outskirts, just like during martial law,'' said Adam Slomka, a
leader of the rightist opposition group Confederation for
Independent Poland, in Katowice.
   ``We want to appeal to miners to be on the alert, put on all
possible lights and make sure they will not take them by surprise.''
   An Associated Press reporter saw long police convoys on the
36-mile route between the Silesia city of Jastrzebie and the
provincial capital of Katowice.
   ``There are many army-and-police patrols, as if they suddenly
ran short of police,'' Lech Bosiak, a Jastrzebie resident, said
late Saturday. ``Most of the patrols are two soldiers and two
police.''
   A government spokesman, asked Saturday if he could rule out
police intervention in the strikes, said only, ``It's 8 o'clock,
and we'll have nothing more for you tonight.''
   PAP carried a dispatch accusing strikers of forcibly keeping
some miners locked in at the strike-bound mines and of having
``crowbars and other such objects for alleged defense action.''
   Solidarity, meanwhile, observed its eighth anniversary this
week. The movement was suppressed with the imposition of martial
law in 1981 and outlawed in 1982.
   The government rejected the demand to legalize it and said the
strikes harmed every Pole.
   About 40,000 workers were participating in the coal strikes,
which were costing an estimated $1.3 million in lost coal
production daily. Production was stopped, but it was impossible to
determine what percentage of mine employees actively supported the
strikes.
   Spirits were high among 2,000 cargo workers occupying the docks
of Poland's second-busiest port in Szczecin since Wednesday. Bus
and most tram drivers there went on strike Thursday and Friday,
crippling public transport.
   The four mines that joined the walkouts Saturday were the
3,000-worker Krupinski mine in Suszec, the 3,500-worker ZMP mine in
Zory, and the First of May and Borynia mines in Jastrzebie.
   Authorities confirmed 10 coal mine strikes in the vital
coal-producing region of Silesia, concentrated around Jastrzebie, a
city of 100,000 people near the Czechoslovak border. Also,
Solidarity activists said two more mines were on strike, but the
claim was disputed by mine officials.
   Solidarity activists from the Nowa Huta steel mill outside
Krakow issued a statement Saturday announcing ``strike readiness.''
Workers said they would call a strike if police intervened against
strikes elsewhere. A similar warning came from activists of the
Ursus tractor plant outside Warsaw.
   On Friday, national Solidarity leader Lech Walesa threatened a
strike Monday at the Lenin Shipyard in Gdansk unless Solidarity was
recognized.
   A 1980 strike by the shipyard workers eight years ago gave birth
to Solidarity, the East bloc's first independent trade union.
Solidarity had a 15-month legal existence and signed up 10 million
members before being suppressed.
   Poland's Council of Ministers said in a statement Friday that
legalizing Solidarity was an ``unrealizable demand,'' but workers
said they disagreed.
   ``We will not back down from our demands that Solidarity be
legalized,'' said Andrzej Milczanowski, a Szczecin docks strike
leader. ``The authorities must realize if they want improvement,
they must restore Solidarity.''
   ``I can't predict how or when it will end,'' said Edward
Radziewicz, chairman of the Interfactory Strike Committee in
Szczecin. ``We may win or we may be removed by force, but we cannot
back up even one step, because there is only water behind us.''
   The labor unrest began Tuesday at the July Manifesto Mine in
Jastrzebie, one of Poland's most modern mines producing high-grade
coal for export.
   State-run radio and television devoted heavy coverage to the
labor unrest, including reporting the demands for legalizing
Solidarity. The reports emphasized the mounting cost of the strike.
   The week's strikes surpassed the number of work stoppages in
April and May, which until then were the worst labor unrest in the
country since the 1981 martial-law crackdown.
   Coal production is crucial to Poland's economy and a major
source of hard currency to service its $39 billion debt to Western
creditors. Poland is the world's fourth-largest coal exporter and
its mining operations are essential to its steel, power and
shipbuilding industries.

<HEAD>Former President Carter Meets with PLO Officials, Sources Say</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former President Jimmy Carter met in Cairo
with a senior official of the Palestine Liberation Organization, an
Egyptian Foreign Ministry official and a PLO source said Saturday.
   The sources, speaking on condition they not be identified, said
Carter met for two hours Friday night with Hani Hassan, political
adviser to PLO leader Yasser Arafat.
   Carter flew to London Saturday where he was scheduled to spend
the night before leaving Sunday for the United States. He bypassed
reporters at London's Heathrow Airport after he arrived from Cairo
with his wife, Rosalynn.
   The Cairo sources said Carter and Hassan had an ``extensive
review'' of Palestinian issues but they gave no details.
   They said the talks were at a presidential guest house where
Carter stayed and Saeed Kamal, an Arafat aide, also was present.
   Carter arrived in Egypt Thusday for a private visit at the end
of an Africa tour that included Kenya, Uganda and Ethiopia. He met
with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in the Mediterranean port of
Alexandria Friday and returned to Cairo for the talks with Hassan.
   The United States government prohibits its officials from
dealing directly with the PLO. The restriction has been in effect
since 1975 with successive U.S. administrations, including
Carter's, insisting that the PLO must renounce violence and
recognize Israel's right to exist before direct talks can be held.
   Egypt was unable to arrange a meeting in Cairo last week between
U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Richard Murphy and Palestinian
representatives. Of six delegates proposed by the PLO through the
Egyptian government, Murphy approved four but rejected two on
grounds they were too closely connected with the PLO.
   The PLO refused to change its list and the plan collapsed.

   Two people died and two others were
seriously injured when they fell while dancing Saturday night in a
crowd of 100,000 people at a heavy metal rock music festival,
police said.
   The annual concert was held at Donington Park Race Track in
Leicestershire, central England.
   A Leicestershire police spokesman said the four were
``slam-dancing'' with dozens of people in front of the stage. The
technique involves running into other people and jumping up and
down to the beat of the music.
   ``The ground was slippery and it seems they may have slipped and
been crushed underfoot. It was definitely an accident,'' a
Leicestershire police spokesman said.
   ``Up until then, there had been no problems at all. There had
not been a single arrest _ the fans were on their best behavior,''
the spokesman said, speaking on condition of anonymity in keeping
with British practice.
   Police said the four young men, in their late teens or early
20s, were carrying no identification. The two injured men were both
unconscious, police said.
   Fans watched the rock groups, including Iron Maiden, in the open
air on a hillside sloping down toward the stage.
   No announcement was made over the public address system and the
bands were unaware of the deaths.

   The strongest earthquake in the area in 54
years shook the Himalaya Mountains early Sunday along the
India-Nepal border, the U.S. Geological Survey reported.
   Initial seismograph readings placed the center of the quake
about 100 miles southeast of Katmandu, the capital of Nepal.
   Geological Survey monitors in Golden, Colo. recorded the
earthquake at a preliminary magnitude of 6.7 on the Richter scale.
The quake occurred at 6:09 a.m. Sunday (7:09 p.m. EDT Saturday).
   The Survey said this was the strongest earthquake in that part
of the Himalayas since Jan. 15, 1934, and it was capable of causing
excessive damage had it occurred in an urban area.
   There were no reports on casualties.

   A jury's decision that the Hunt brothers must pay
over $130 million in damages to a Peruvian company is the latest in
a series of problems faced by the sons of the late Texas oilman
H.L. Hunt.
   After six months of testimony and five days of deliberations, a
federal jury in New York jury determined Saturday that the brothers
conspired to corner the world silver market in the late 1970s,
thereby ruining the investments of Minpeco S.A., the Peruvian
government's mineral marketing company.
   The ruling comes as the Hunt brothers try to complete settlement
of a two-year, $1.5 billion dispute with 23 lenders. The dispute
has absorbed much of the fortune left the brothers by their father.
   Hunt Energy Corp. Vice President Tom Whitaker said the Hunts
were disappointed by the verdict ``and obviously disagree with it.
   ``However, this is merely a first step in a long civil process
that has been going on for nearly eight years,'' Whitaker said.
``Motions, raising other issues, will be filed to set aside or
modify this verdict.
   ``The brothers are confident that this wrong result will
eventually be overturned as they proceed through the court system.''
   Nelson Bunker Hunt, 62, William Herbert Hunt, 59, and Lamar
Hunt, 56, mortgaged much of their share of the family legacy to
cover $1.1 billion in losses they suffered when the market crashed
in March 1980.
   The loss also prompted their sisters, Caroline Rose Hunt
Schoellkopf and Margaret Hunt Hill and representatives of another
brother, Haroldson ``Hassie'' Hunt Jr., to separate their fortunes
from those of their brothers, significantly cutting into the wealth
of their trusts.
   After the silver losses, the Hunts' International Resources Co.
and Great Western Sugar Co. went bankrupt and are now defunct.
   In the spring of 1986, two Hunt businesses, Placid Oil Co. and
Penrod Drilling Co., failed to make payments on a total of $1.5
billion in loans. In July 1986, after attempts to renegotiate the
loans failed, the three Hunt brothers sued their banks and lenders,
charging them with negotiating in bad faith and trying to take over
their offshore oil businesses.
   Soon after, the Hunts put the most valuable loan collateral _
Placid Oil and William Herbert Hunt's trust _ into Chapter 11
bankruptcy protection to guard against foreclosure. Later, the
trusts of Lamar and Nelson Bunker were put into Chapter 11 for the
same reason.
   In the settlement they proposed to the lenders, the Hunts would
pay $663.5 million from funds raised through Placid operations,
primarily in the North Sea.
   Hearings on the settlement, which must be approved by the
lenders, the Internal Revenue Sevice, other major creditors and the
bankruptcy court were to begin this month.

   Hey, hey it's a whole new generation of Monkees
fans, and they're not too busy to attend the 1988 Official Monkees
Convention.
   The band, which had six top 10 hits and a popular television
series from 1966 to 1968, has captured the adoration of 1980s teens
through a revival of its show on cable television.
   ``I don't think they're too old,'' said 15-year-old Lisa Mason
of Portsmouth, Va. ``I dream about meeting them, and I play around
and think they're still not married and they're my age.''
   Despite wrinkles and some gray hairs, band members still draw
shrieks and tears from female fans, who gathered by the thousands
Saturday.
   ``I'm closer in spirit to their ages now,'' said guitarist Peter
Tork, 46. ``I thought I was older then.''
   The convention drew fans, including a handful of men, from as
far away as Australia and Japan to the Monkees' only performance in
the United States this year, said Michael Bush, convention
organizer.
   Three of the Monkees _ Tork, drummer Micky Dolenz and singer
Davy Jones _ were scheduled to perform separately, one on each of
the three days of the convention, which started Friday. The fourth
Monkee, Michael Nesmith, declined to attend.
   Beth Weltheral, 15, of Huntsville, Ala., said she persuaded her
mother to take a vacation to Chicago, so she could see the group.
   ``My friends think I've gone out of my mind,'' said Beth, who
said she owns 23 of their albums.
   ``But their music just seems to have more meaning than the music
of today does,'' she said, as she clutched a photograph of Tork and
wore a Monkees' T-shirt and a Monkees' jacket.
   Beth's mother, Shelba Weltheral, 48, a management analyst for
the Army, said she never liked the Monkees until her daughter
started buying the albums and watching the television show. ``Now,
I'm a Monkees fan too.''

  Twenty-two members and supporters of
American Indian tribes walked single-file up a seven-mile mountain
road to President Reagan's ranch Saturday, seeking an ``ongoing
dialogue'' on Indian rights.
   The walk was triggered by Reagan's remarks at the Moscow summit
in May, when he spoke of Indians living a ``primitive lifestyle''
and said that, ``Maybe we should not have humored them.''
   Before the march, White House officials met with representatives
of the American Indian Action Group and arranged for Reagan to meet
in Washington with Indian leaders, probably in September.
   ``I would like to thank President Reagan for publicly inviting
us to open up a dialogue,'' Wonono Rubio, a Chumash Indian from
Goleta, Calif., told the group outside the gate of the ranch.
   ``I hope that he keeps the door open and keeps a dialogue as
long as he is president,'' Rubio added. ``One meeting is not going
to solve our problems, and I hope that he keeps it in mind this is
going to be an ongoing dialogue.''
   The walkers marched from Refugio State Beach on the Pacific
Ocean, chanting, beating drums and playing other musical
instruments as they walked up the steep, winding blacktop road.
   Some wore elements of traditional Indian garb as part of their
costumes. One was in the robe of a Buddhist monk. The leader of the
march, Michael Zarate, wore a Mickey Mouse shirt.
   When they reached the ranch, they lined up across the road from
the gate while members designated as elders of various tribes led
them in prayers and songs.
   The walk took about three hours.
   Earlier, about 100 persons assembled at the state park north of
Santa Barbara.
   ``This is going to be a spiritual walk,'' said Michael Zarate, a
leader of the organization. ``I emphasize this, because it is not a
protest march.''
   An announcement of the walk issued on Wednesday had referred to
it as a protest against Reagan's remarks at the Moscow summit in
May, when he said of American Indians: ``Maybe we should not have
humored them in wanting to stay in that kind of primitive
lifestyle. Maybe we should have said, `No, come join us. Be
citizens along with the rest of us'.''
   Zarate said the reference to a protest was ``erroneous'' and the
group had apologized to the White House.
   On Thursday, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater telephoned
Zarate and offered to arrange a meeting between the Indians and
White House aides here to set up a session between Reagan and
Indian leaders in Washington.
   On Friday, Zarate said, he met with Fitzwater and M.B. Oglesby,
the deputy White House chief of staff, who said the meeting could
probably be arranged for September.
   ``They also informed us the president would not be able to meet
with us today as we originally requested,'' Zarate said.
   The president and his wife, Nancy, were entertaining old
friends, Mr. and Mrs. Earle Jorgensen and Mr. and Mrs. William
Wilson, at the ranch. The Wilsons and the Jorgensens were giving a
belated birthday party for the first lady, whose birthday was last
month.
   The weather at the ranch, which has generally been sunny since
the Reagans arrived on Tuesday, was cloudy and cool.
   At Refugio Beach, the Indians listened to speakers on
environmental and other issues, and assembled under a eucalyptus
tree for the walk.

<HEAD>U.N. Report Urges Paraguay to Help Return Abducted Children</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.N. report released Saturday said Paraguay is
not cooperating in efforts to return children of Argentines
detained under that nation's military juntas.
   Referring to Paraguay, the report said it was ``inadmissible and
a matter of serious international concern if a country becomes a
hiding place for kidnappers and illegally appropriated children.''
   The report by Dutch human rights specialist Theo van Boven said
Paraguay, ruled since 1954 by President Alfredo Stroessner's
authoritarian government, should take immediate measures for
repatriating the children.
   At least 9,000 people suspected of being leftist subversives
were seized by Argentine security forces and disappeared during the
``dirty war'' of 1974-81, officials have said. Human rights group
put the number closer to 30,000.
   Van Boven's report said pregnant detainees were placed in secret
detention centers where they gave birth and were separated from
their children.
   His report said many of the children were turned over to
supporters of Argentina's junta through an unofficial adoption
ring, and some of the people who adopted the children fled to
Paraguay when Argentine military rule collapsed. The report said
some of the ``kidnappers'' forged documents to register the
children as their own.
   Argentina's military rule ended in 1983 with the election of
President Raul Alfonsin.
   Van Boven gave no figure for the number of children believed to
be involved. His report said three of 45 such children located to
date were found by the Argentine government and the 42 others were
found by relatives and the Grandmothers of the Plaza Del Mayor, a
private relatives' group.
   That group has said 182 children were taken from their parents
and at least 72 have been repatriated.
   Van Boven said Paraguay denied him entry to investigate the
cases, citing pending judicial inquiries.
   He presented his findings to the U.N. Sub-Commission on
Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities.

   Republican presidential candidate George
Bush gave running mate Dan Quayle a vote of confidence Saturday,
saying he is ``satisfied that there was no impropriety'' in
Quayle's enlistment in the National Guard in 1969.
   Joining Quayle in answering reporters' questions at the Ohio
State Fairgrounds here, Bush defended his selection of the Indiana
senator for the No. 2 spot on the ticket.
   ``The premise for this decision was very sound, and the American
people are going to see that, loud and clear,'' he said. ``I've
made a good choice,'' Bush said. ``So, the fact that there is some
flurry out there, and a lot of rumors have to be run down, I don't
see that it's detracting.''
   Bush complained that stories suggesting the young Quayle had
enlisted in the Guard to avoid being drafted at the height of the
Vietnam War ``were greatly overdone.''
   ``I think it will turn out to be a tempest in a teapot,'' he
said.
   Bush complained that the heavy focus on Quayle's National Guard
record by news reporters had interfered with some elements of his
campaign operation during the Republican National Convention in New
Orleans last week.
   ``Please don't judge me by this moment,'' he told reporters.
``We've had to shoot down many unfair rumors. There was this
flurry, you know, ... like bluefish, when they're swimming around,
all in a frenzy. You've made the charges and we felt we had to
answer them.''
   Quayle said he had not deceived the Bush campaign about the
circumstances surrounding his enlistment in the National Guard
nearly 20 years ago.
   ``There's sort of a sentiment out there impugning the motives of
people'' who sign up for the National Guard, he said. ``I told the
Bush campaign there was nothing embarrassing in my military record,
and I'm sticking to it.''
   Quayle said he could not immediately disclose the communications
he might have had with his draft board at the time. But he repeated
that he had asked to have his full military record supplied to him
so that he can release it and better answer questions about it.
   Bush and Quayle on Saturday marched together with their wives,
Barbara and Marilyn, in the Paper Day Parade in nearby West
Carrollton, home of several paper plants.
   Standing on a freshly painted blue stage on a baseball field,
Bush worked a highly partisan crowd into a frenzy with a
restatement of his hard-line opposition to tax increases.
   He said that if Congress tried to get a tax increase past him,
he would ``stare them right in the face, and say what I said in New
Orleans the other night.'' He then paused just along enough to get
large numbers of people in the crowd of 5,000 to 7,500 to join him
in a chorus of, ``Read my lips. No more taxes.'
   Quayle won cheers Saturday from an Oktoberfest crowd of
German-Americans near Cleveland, when he said a Bush administration
would ``see the Berlin Wall come down.''
   Bush and Quayle watched German folk dances and drank beer from
steins at the celebration in Olmsted Township near Cleveland,
putting aside questions that had dogged them earlier in the day
about Quayle's military service.
   Several hundred people jammed into a German-American cultural
center cheered Bush's call for the Soviet Union to demonstrate its
reforms are real by permitting ``a little more freedom in Eastern
Europe.''
   Stuart Spencer, a senior campaign official, said that while he
thought news reporters would continue to ask questions about the
circumstances under which the Quayle joined the National Guard, ``I
think it's behind us. We feel good. We feel upbeat.''
   Quayle has said he thought there was nothing inappropriate about
having a mutual family friend make inquiries in 1969 about the
possibility of the young 22-year-old DePauw University graduate
joining the National Guard.
   ``At least he served,'' said one placard held aloft at the ball
field grounds. Several other signs among the crowd suggested that
Quayle's enlistment in the Guard was a non-issue.
   Bush, emerging from a restaurant here Friday night, said that
Quayle had not misled the campaign about his military record.
``This guy did the honorable thing and told the truth,'' he said.
   Bush campaign press secretary Sheila Tate said Quayle's
question-and-answer session Friday had ``relieved a lot of the
press pressure.'' She said the interruption in getting the Bush
campaign message out was only ``temporary.''
   David Prosperi, a former White House press office official now
at the Interior Department, will join Quayle's campaign as press
secretary on Monday, Ms. Tate said.

<HEAD>Report: Attacks Against Americans in Panama Increase</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attacks against Americans in Panama have
increased in recent weeks in what U.S. officials see as an effort
to force the United States to lift sanctions against the country,
according to a published report.
   Officials of the State and Defense Departments and the U.S.
Southern Command in Panama say there have been incidents of
beatings, abductions, rape and extortion of American military
personnel and their dependents, The New York Times reported in
Sunday's editions.
   The regime is also refusing to honor visas of some American
officials and has banned mail service at American military and
civilian bases, officials told the newspaper.
   The officials view the incidents as a campaign of harassment by
the regime of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega aimed at pressuring the
United States to lift economic sanctions against Panama, The Times
said.
   The Southern Command, the American military headquarters for
Latin America, has protested the incidents, but officials said the
protests have had no real effect.
   The Times said the Southern Command reported a June incident in
which an enlisted man and his wife were assaulted at gunpoint by a
Panamanian military officer who forced the man into the trunk of
his car, then beat and raped the man's wife.
   In another reported incident, a serviceman who got into an
argument over a parked car with a man believed to be an undercover
Panamanian intelligence officer was taken into a military station
and beaten.
   On August 1, the command reported, four Panamanian military
officers detained a serviceman and his father for 24 hours,
questioned them at gunpoint and robbed them of $300.
   Two days later, an Air Force enlisted woman was sexually abused
by two Panamanian officers, Southern Command officials said.
   About 12,000 U.S. military personnel are based in Panama to
protect the Panama Canal.
   Noriega, chief of the Panamanian Defense Forces and the power
behind the civilian government, is under federal indictment in the
United States on charges of drug trafficking and money laundering.
   The Reagan administration, which continues to recognize the
deposed Eric Arturo Delvalle as Panama's president, has applied
economic sanctions in its effort to oust Noriega. Although the
sanctions have helped push Panama into a depression, Noriega has
refused to step down.

   Protestant lawmakers on Saturday
demanded that the government begin locking up guerrilla suspects
without trial after a car bomb set by the IRA blew up a busload of
British troops, killing eight.
   Seven soldiers perished in the Friday night blast and one died
Saturday of his wounds. The army said 27 survivors were injured.
   The car bomb blew a crater 6 feet deep in the road and hurled
mutilated bodies into nearby fields.
   It was the deadliest single blow by the IRA against the British
army in Northern Ireland since 1982. It brought to 26 the number of
British military personnel killed in a summer IRA blitz in Northern
Ireland, mainland Britain and continental Europe.
   British Armed Forces Minister Archie Hamilton said in a
television interview there was ``obviously a possibility'' that an
Irish Republican Army spy had managed to penetrate Britain's
security forces and that ``is something that will have to be
investigated.''
   The bus was an unmarked vehicle and supposedly its route and
schedule was secret.
   Ken Maginnis, a Protestant politician, said, ``I believe there
must have been inside information for them (IRA guerrillas) to
pinpoint the attack.''
   ``What I want to know is who informed the terrorists this
busload of men was coming through here,'' he said.
   The IRA asserted responsibility for the attack in a statement to
the Irish media and declared, ``We will not lay down our arms until
the peace of a British disengagement from Ireland is granted to our
nation.''
   Northern Ireland Secretary Tom King said: ``We have no choice
but to fight and to stand and to defeat the men of violence.''
   At a news conference in Northern Ireland, King said officials
have evidence the explosives were part of several loads of Libyan
armaments reportedly smuggled onto the island in recent years. He
did not elaborate.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher broke off a holiday in Cornwall
and flew to London to meet with Maginnis, one of several Northern
Ireland Protestant members of Parliament who demanded the return of
``selective internment'' _ a controversial policy of locking up
guerrilla suspects without trial, last used in 1975.
   Maginnis, in whose County Tyrone constituency the bombing
occurred, was among the first on the scene. He tearfully described
going to a barn and finding ``a young man gasping his last, just
dying. He had crawled into the most available cover and died over a
bale of hay.''
   With him at the Thatcher meeting was Alan Rainey, who lives near
the scene of the bombing.
   ``I heard screams of agony I shall never forget,'' he said.
``The road was littered with the dead and the dying, they were
scattered and sprayed across the road, behind hedges; and one poor
soul I found wrapped around a telephone pole.''
   Mrs. Thatcher met later with King, Lt. Gen. Sir John Walters,
commander of the British army in Northern Ireland, and Sir John
Hermon, chief constable of the Royal Ulster Constabulary, the
province's police force.
   After two hours of talks King would say only that the possible
reintroduction of the internment policy was still under review.
   The predominantly Roman Catholic IRA is fighting to end British
rule in Northern Ireland and unite the 60 percent Protestant
province with the 95 percent Catholic Irish Republic.
   Lately, the outlawed IRA appears to have shifted tactics away
from attacking local police and militiamen and has concentrated on
army personnel from mainland Britain.
   On June 15, a bomb killed six soldiers in their van in Lisburn,
outside Belfast. Five more have died in IRA attacks this summer in
Belgium, Holland, West Germany and north London.
   Of the nearly 2,700 people killed in Irish-related violence
since 1969, 76 have died this year, compared with 93 in all of
1987. The number of troops killed has gone from three to 25.
   Maginnis, a member of the Protestants' largest party, the
Official Unionists, said of Friday's attack: ``I and the people in
this area know who detonated that bomb. The police know.'' He did
not name those he believed responsible.
   ``Internment is the only alternative to a court system which has
been unable to put murderers behind bars,'' he said. ``I believe
that internment is the only way to deal with these people.''
   Mrs. Thatcher has refused previous internment calls, but Armed
Forces Minister Hamilton said nothing was ruled out.
   Internment was last used between 1971 and 1975 to hold 1,981
people, mostly pro-IRA suspects. It damaged Britain's human rights
record, and moderate politicians warned Saturday its reintroduction
would givr the IRA a propaganda victory.
   The bomb, in a car parked by the road, blew up as the unmarked
bus passed carrying soldiers of the First Battalion of the Light
Infantry to base at Omagh, 50 miles west of Belfast. They had just
flown in from mainland Britain after furloughs and were still in
civilian clothes.
   The army said seven of the dead ranged in age from 18 to 21. It
withheld information on the eighth victim.
   The IRA said it used 200 pounds of plastic explosives.
   The blast, 10 miles from the base, was the deadliest blow to the
army in Northern Ireland since 1982 when a bomb in a pub killed 11
soldiers and six civilians.
   Gerry Adams, president of the IRA's legal political wing Sinn
Fein, said, ``The families of the dead and injured British soldiers
are paying the price of British interference in Irish affairs that
Irish families have paid for decades.''

   Rain fell across broad sections of the eastern part of the
nation Saturday, including heavy rain in Florida from a tropical
wave, and meteorologists watched two new tropical depressions in
the Atlantic.
   Rain and occasional thunderstorms extended from New Jersey and
southern Pennsylvania through Florida, including the central and
southern Appalachians, and spread into Alabama.
   Rain in Florida came from a tropical wave, a weather system
weaker than the tropical depressions that can grow into hurricanes.
It dumped almost 6{ inches of rain at West Palm Beach on Friday.
The wave moved toward the northwest and up to 4 inches of rain was
expected over parts of central and northern Florida.
   The tropical depressions included one that formed at noon about
150 miles southeast of the southernmost Cape Verde islands, off the
African coast. The second formed Saturday just south of Saint
Vincent in the Windward Islands, which are in the Lesser Antilles.
   Rain also fell on the lower Mississippi Valley, northern Texas
and eastern Oklahoma, and rain was scattered over northern
Minnesota and from southern Nevada across southwestern Wyoming.
   A creek swollen by heavy rain in Indiana swept a car off a
bridge late Friday north of Batesville, and police said Saturday
that a babysitter and a 4-year-old boy were missing. A 7-year-old
girl escaped from the car and was rescued, and a would-be rescuer
was swept downstream before he managed to climb out, state police
said.
   Cheyenne, Wyo., reached 91 degrees, one degree higher than the
record for the date set last year. Sheridan, Wyo., reached 100
degrees, breaking a record of 97 set in 1971.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 57
degrees at Bremerton, Fort Lewis and Olympia, Wash., to 99 at Waco,
Texas. The low temperature Saturday morning was 38 degrees at
Truckee, Calif.
   For Sunday, showers and thunderstorms were forecast from central
Florida across Georgia, Alabama and Mississippi, with rain
scattered from South Carolina across the Virginia coast. Showers
and thunderstorms also were forecast from New Mexico across Arizona
into southern Nevada, and scattered over southern Utah through
northern Colorado plus northwestern Montana.
   Highs in the 60s and 70s were predicted over the northern
Atlantic states, the northern Appalachians and the Great Lakes; in
the 70s from Montana across the northern Pacific Coast and along
much of the California coast; in the 90s or near 90 from the
southern Atlantic states across the Gulf of Mexico states, the
lower two thirds of the Mississippi Valley, much of the Plains, and
from the central Pacific Coast across eastern California; near 100
over central Texas; around 105 over the desert Southwest; and in
the 80s over the remainder of the nation.

   The nation's wildfire control center on Saturday asked the U.S.
Army to provide a battalion of infantry troops to help suppress
fires in the western United States, where nearly 13,000
firefighters are already on the lines.
   The Boise (Idaho) Interagency Fire Center requested the military
assistance to provide relief for civilian firefighters, some of
whom have been on fire lines for more than two weeks, and to
release expert firefighters to build new lines and deal with more
complex situations, said spokesman Arnold Hartigan.
   The fire center has sent 18 instructors to Fort Lewis, Wash., to
train 600 soldiers of the First Brigade Combat Team of the 9th
Infantry Division Motorized on fighting wildfires.
   After training on Sunday and Monday, the troops will be deployed
to fire lines in Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming.
   Meanwhile, military helicopters headed to Yellowstone Saturday
to assist in the battle against huge forest fires, and fire crews
in Montana fought against high wind to tighten their control over
dozens of fires.
   Winds gusting to 60 miles an hour throughout the day and evening
kicked up fire activity in Yellowstone. The campgrounds and park
buildings at Grant Village were evacuated and several park roads
were closed.
   The Norris, Pebble Creek and Madison campgrounds remained closed.
   Officials expected the 74,000-acre North Fork blaze to burn
across the park's Norris Canyon Road and steps were taken to
protect Norris Junction while crews removed debris and flammable
materials from the area.
   Yellowstone officials had called in two military helicopters to
assist other aircraft already making water and retardant drops on
the 110,000-acre Clover-Mist fire in the park's northeastern
section.
   Outside the park in the Bighorn National Forest, a five-man team
launched an investigation into a helicopter crash west of the
6,500-acre Lost fire that killed one and injured three. The 750
people working the fire hoped for a second day of relatively calm
westerly wind that on Friday supported efforts to protect a ranch
and a group of summer homes.
   In Montana, south of Helena, the devastating Warm Springs Creek
fire in the Elkhorn Mountains cooled Friday night after dramatic
runs earlier in the week, Dave Turner, fire information officer,
said Saturday.
   ``It looks pretty good here; we had a real cool night,'' he
said. ``There was very little growth in the fire. There was very
little wind.''
   About 2,000 firefighters were battling to contain the fire,
shoring up fire lines on the northeastern flank, Turner said. Crews
had encircled about 60 percent of the fire, compared with only 30
percent the day before.
   The National Weather Service forecast wind blowing up to 40 mph,
but temperatures were expected to be somewhat cooler, with possible
showers in scattered areas of Montana, which is suffering through a
severe drought.
   ``It will be tenuous for the next 24 hours,'' Turner said
Saturday.
   The Warm Springs Creek fire destroyed at least 10 residences and
killed 30 head of cattle late Wednesday and early Thursday, but
turned just before reaching a mountain subdivision with scores of
residences.
   The fire grew by about 200 acres Friday night, but that was
small compared with the 7,000- and 15,000-acre runs the two
previous nights.
   As the fire moved generally to the east, flames headed onto
flatter land near the community of Winston, and officials said they
would have more of a chance of checking the fire once it left the
rugged mountain ridges.
   Firefighters were backed for the first time by three Air
National Guard transport planes used to drop retardant on the
flames.
   Elsewhere in Montana, smaller fires were burning over thousands
of acres, many of them the result of lightning strikes earlier in
the week, including 46 in the Flathead River drainage of
northwestern Montana.
   Elsewhere, firefighters extinguished a 600-acre southern Utah
brush fire near St. George, and on Saturday declared contained a
50-acre blaze in the region's Wahwah Mountains.

   Pro-independence groups in New Caledonia and
residents who want the South Pacific archipelago to remain a French
territory reached agreement Saturday on a transitional plan for the
islands' future.
   But militants quickly denounced the accord. Last spring 30
people were killed in political and ethnic violence in New
Caledonia.
   The agreement provides for a referendum on independence in 1998.
During the intervening 10 years the territory would be divided into
three provinces with more autonomy.
   The referendum would be restricted to voters who have lived in
New Caledonia during all of the intervening 10 years.
   Native Melanesians make up only 43 percent of the population.
Separatists claim many settlers _ Europeans, Asians and Polynesians
_ are short-term residents who want to maintain links with France
and outvote them in elections. The ethnic Melanesians, known as
Kanaks, also have had a higher birth rate in recent years and
expect to form the majority again by the end of the century.
   ``This is not the finish today, this is a stage,'' said Louis Le
Pensec, the minister for overseas territories in the French
government of Premier Michel Rocard.
   But Pensec said the agreement was more than could have been
hoped for ``if one remembers the situation the territory found
itself in three months ago.''
   The breakthrough in negotiations following the violence in April
and May came in June when the head of the Kanak Socialist National
Liberation Front, Jean-Marie Tjibaou, and conservative Jacques
LaFleur reached an agreement in principle during talks directed by
Rocard.
   In the Caledonian capital of Noumea, the far-right National
Front issued a statement Saturday saying pro-French leaders who
participated in the talks had committed treason. It said the accord
``will lead the territory irreversibly to independence sooner or
later.''
   Yann Celene Uregei, leader of the separatist United Kanak
Liberation Front that is a member of Tjibaou's alliance, said
Tjibaou had no authority to sign an agreement. He said the proposal
should have been presented first to New Caledonians for debate.
   The plan, drawn up as a law to be presented to the French
National Assembly, will include constitutional changes that must be
approved by French voters in a national referendum to be scheduled
later this year.

<HEAD>Marcos Lawyer Says Swiss May Intercede If Marcos Return Blocked</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Ferdinand Marcos' lawyer said
Saturday he will ask Swiss authorities not to cooperate with the
government if it refuses to allow the ex-president to return to the
Philippines to face charges he kept money in secret Swiss bank
accounts.
   The government believes Marcos stashed millions of dollars in
Switzerland during his 20-year rule, which ended on Feb. 25, 1986,
when a civilian uprising swept him from office.
   President Corazon Aquino said on Friday she will abide by a
court order approving her ousted predecessor's return from Hawaii,
where he fled after his ouster.
   On Thursday, an anti-graft court said Marcos or his attorney had
the right to be present during testimony of a former government
minister scheduled to give a deposition against Marcos in November.
   Marcos, who is a lawyer, said he would demand his right to come
home and conduct his own defense.
   Marcos lawyer Rafael Recto told reporters he would send copies
of newspaper reports on the court's ruling to Swiss federal and
cantonal authorities who are involved in an investigation into
secret bank accounts the former president allegedly opened in
Switzerland.
   ``If the government should refuse to respect Marcos' human right
to freely return to his own abode, the Swiss government might be
forced to withdraw assistance to the Philippine government,'' Recto
said.
   Recto said that if the government still blocked Marcos' return,
it would be in violation of European human rights covenants, which
the Swiss have signed. Those covenants state that a defendant has
the right to face his accuser personally or with the counsel of his
choice.
   At a news conference Saturday, Armed Forces Chief of Staff Gen.
Renato de Villa said the military command would respect the court's
decision despite security risks.
   ``Certainly, there are some security implications that may come
about with the return of ex-president Marcos to the Philippines at
this time,'' de Villa said. ``But as I said, and I wish to stress,
a court order must be respected and obeyed by everybody.''
   De Villa said Marcos supporters include small numbers of
soldiers who have been dismissed for involvement in previous coup
attempts. But he said they do not have the capacity to topple the
government.
   Others have said Marcos still commands the loyalty of a
considerable number of low- and middle-ranking officers and men.

   Federal agents seized about 1,100 pounds of cocaine
and made seven arrests Saturday after the drug was driven from a
Haitian freighter to a Miami apartment while under surveillance by
both the smugglers and the agents, officials said.
   The freighter Dieu Plus Grand was watched by U.S. Customs
Service agents after the illegal cargo was discovered in a routine
boarding Wednesday, said Patrick O'Brien, special agent in charge
of the Miami office.
   ``It was very well concealed. We put everything back the way it
was so no one would know we had found it,'' O'Brien said.
   Agents found the cocaine in a water tank below deck but acted as
if nothing had been found and arranged surveillance, O'Brien said.
   ``A van came and people unloaded the cocaine from the vessel
into the van. They then left with the van, and we had extensive
countersurveillance by the smugglers looking for us, and followed
it from place to place,'' O'Brien said.
   The smugglers stopped twice, switched drivers and had four cars
following the van, but undercover agents kept up with them, O'Brien
said.
   Agents made seven arrests and seized the drug, which had been
packed in vegetable oil cartons, after the van stopped to unload
its cargo at the apartment, O'Brien said.
   Five Haitians and two Colombians were taken into custody
Saturday. All seven face narcotics smuggling charges, O'Brien said.

   A strong earthquake damaged buildings
and slightly injured eight people in an Indonesian island, a
newspaper reported Friday.
   It was the third tremor to rock parts of this Southeast Asian
country in four days.
   The latest quake hit Manado, the provincial capital of Celebes
island, on Thursday morning, the daily Suara Pembaruan newspaper in
Jakarta reported Friday.
   It quoted sources at a Manado hospital as saying eight people
were treated, all for minor injuries, and released.
   At least 17 buildings were damaged by the quake, which
registered 5.6 on the Richter scale, the newspaper said.
   The country's Meteorological Agency said earlier that the quake
measured 4.8 on the Richter scale.
   Thursday's quake was centered 15 miles northwest of Manado at a
depth of 37 miles, the newspaper said. It was followed by 10 minor
quakes the same day.
   On Monday, an earthquake measuring 5.3 rocked the tourist island
of Bali.
   Another one registering 6 shook eastern Java island and Jakarta
on Wednesday.
   No injuries or major damage were reported in the first two
quakes.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph. Every increase of one number means that the ground
motion is 10 times greater.
   An earthquake measuring 4 can cause moderate damage, one of
magnitude 5 considerable damage, and a 6 can cause severe damage in
populated areas.

   Corruption among the Providence Police
Department's vice squad is systemic but does not involve
high-ranking officers, a U.S. attorney said Friday.
   Lincoln C. Almond declined to identify the targets of the secret
three-year investigation, nor would he say exactly what misconduct
is alleged. But FBI agent Mike Suddes confirmed the probe concerns
possible misappropriation of drugs and cash seized by Special
Investigations Bureau officers.
   The investigation was kept secret until the FBI demanded
hundreds of pages of documents from the police on Thursday, Almond
said.
   ``Until this year, the investigation was extremely covert,
extremely need-to-know. It was an intelligence-gathering
investigation,'' he said.
   The case involves more than just one or two bad apples, Almond
said.
   ``It would be systemic,'' he said. But he added that
high-ranking officials were not under suspicion.
   ``You're basically talking the street cop,'' Almond said.
   A state law enforcement source who spoke on the condition he not
be identified suggested the investigation may involve a group of
officers who agreed to underreport the cash seized in drug raids
and split the rest among themselves.
   Police Chief Walter J. Clark could not be reached for comment.
An aide said he had left for vacation and would not be back until
Tuesday.
   Some evidence has been presented to a grand jury, but Almond
said indictments are not likely until next year at the earliest.

<TEXT>
   The modest white house with the pointed-arch
window that inspired Grant Wood's painting ``American Gothic'' was
promised to the state of Iowa on Friday so that the ``major
American icon'' can be preserved.
   Carl Smith, 81, of Breckville, Ohio, who inherited the house
after his parents died, signed an agreement providing that the
state will take control of the six-room frame house 18 months after
his death.
   ``It's my vision that this agreement with the state of Iowa will
continue to preserve the American Gothic (home) and make it an
attraction,'' Smith said during a ceremony on the front porch of
the house.
   Wood, Iowa's most famous artist, received national acclaim in
1930 when the ``American Gothic'' painting won a $300 first prize
at the Art Institute of Chicago's contest for American painters.
The painting, which has inspired countless parodies, still hangs in
the Chicago museum.
   Wood is said to have gotten the idea for the painting after he
saw the house during a visit to Eldon, a town in southeastern Iowa
with a current population of 1,250.
   The painting depicts a dour-faced farmer _ Wood's dentist was
the model _ holding a pitchfork and standing beside his spinster
daughter, who actually was Wood's sister, Nan Wood Graham.
   Mrs. Graham, who lives in a nursing home in Menlo Park, Calif.,
said, ``I'm tickled stiff'' about the agreement to give the house
to the state of Iowa. ``That house represents real Americans;
people who are forthright, hard-working, just ordinary Americans.''
   Carl Smith said his father bought the house at a tax sale in
1942, which coincidentally was the year Wood died.
   ``I don't remember what he paid for it, but it wasn't very
much,'' he said in an interview. ``The taxes hadn't been paid on it
so he decided to buy it.''
   The house's role in art history made no difference to his
father, Smith said. ``He bought it because he wanted a place for
his brother, Wilber Porter Smith, to stay.''
   Smith currently rents the house for $50 a month to a couple with
three children.
   David Crosson, administrator of the Iowa Historical Society, a
government agency, said the agreement with Smith will ensure the
house ``will be preserved for posterity.''
   ``We will be able to continue to preserve what is one of the
most important symbols in the world,'' Crosson said. ``When people
see `American Gothic,' they think of traditional values, not only
of the Midwest but of Iowa particularly.''
   The agreement ``guarantees both the preservation and
interpretation of a major American icon,'' Crosson said.
   The Legislature has appropriated $50,000 for development and
operation of the site as a tourist attraction. Officials said they
will improve the gravel road leading to the house and possibly
build a parking lot across the street. Crosson said the house will
not be moved.

<TEXT>
   Amtrak has agreed to pay the families of 15
people killed in a January 1987 train crash $8.2 million, on top of
the $58 million settlement agreed to by Conrail two months ago.
   In addition to death claims, Amtrak's and Conrail's settlements
also create a $9 million fund to pay 330 passengers who filed
claims for injuries or distress they suffered because of the Jan.
4, 1987, accident near Chase, Md.
   ``That makes this settlement (on the death claims alone) the
largest group personal injury settlement in the country,'' said
Read K. McCaffrey, an attorney for the victims' families.
   Claims filed by the 16th victim's family were settled earlier.
   ``We think it's a fair settlement and hopefully will put an end
to the uncertainty and the waiting period a lot of people have gone
through,'' Amtrak public affairs director John Jacobsen said
Friday, a day after the settlement offer was made. ``Amtrak feels
it is in some ways as much a victim in this as anyone else is.''
   ``A plan has been formulated where a committee of attorneys
representing (injured victims) will review the claims and recommend
who should get from the $9 million fund,'' McCaffrey said.
   The Amtrak passenger train collided with a Conrail locomotive.
   Ricky L. Gates, the Conrail engineer who was at the controls at
the time of the accident, is serving a five-year prison term for
manslaughter after admitting he'd smoked marijuana shortly before
the crash.
   The total $66.2 million the train companies have agreed to pay
on the death claims means each of the victims' survivors will
receive about $4.5 million, McCaffrey said.
   Under terms of Amtrak's settlement, the railroad did not admit
responsibility for causing the crash or the deaths, McCaffrey said.

   An orchestra played Aaron Copland's
``Fanfare for the Common Man'' Friday night as the 400-foot-high
Louisville Falls Fountain, billed as the world's tallest floating
fountain, debuted before more than 60,000 people.
   ``Paris has its Eiffel Tower. London has Big Ben. Rome has the
Coliseum. And tonight the world-class city of Louisville has the
Louisville Falls Fountain,'' said Mary Ray Oaken, secretary of the
state Tourism Cabinet.
   The crowd lined the banks of the Ohio River as the fountain was
triggered.
   It took 20 minutes for the computer-controlled fountain's 41
jets and red, white, blue and amber lights to complete its program
of patterns, which concludes when the fountain sprays a
fleur-de-lis _ Louisville's official symbol _ about 400 feet above
the river.
   The fountain, on an octagonal barge 39 feet across, is a gift to
the city from Mary and Barry Bingham Sr., who donated $2.6 million
for its construction and maintenance for three years. Bingham,
patriarch of a three-generation media family, died Monday at age 82.
   ``I know that he (Barry Bingham Sr.) is with us tonight in a
spirit of joy and fulfillment,'' Barry Bingham Jr. said.
   Gov. Wallace Wilkinson said he would never see the fountain
without thinking of the elder Bingham and that the fountain would
flow ``as an eternal flame would burn in his memory.''
   Plenty of entertainment was on hand, including dancers, singers,
an orchestra and bands _ the 100th Army Reserve Band, country music
and rock 'n' roll.
   A flotilla of at least 100 boats gathered near the George Rogers
Clark Memorial Bridge, which was closed to vehicular traffic and
was packed with 8,000 to 10,000 people.
   Interstate 64, which skirts the Ohio River at Louisville was
jammed as motorists stopped to watch the fountain dedication,
creating a massive traffic tieup.
   ``I think the whole city is planning a party,'' said John
Richards, executive director of the Mary and Barry Bingham Sr. Fund.
   Electrical engineer Frank Gavuld, who was aboard the barge, said
afterward: ``It ran perfectly. We've had it up to 429 feet, but the
420 feet tonight was right on target.''
   ``I thought it was excellent,'' said Greg Schum of Louisville,
who staked out his spot six hours before the fountain was turned
on. ``It's like fireworks made out of water. It's something the
city can be proud of.''
   The fountain, proposed almost 30 years ago, was built by Pete
Serodino of Chattanooga, Tenn., a marine contractor who has built
other floating fountains around the world. This one sprays the
highest, backers said.
   Plans call for the fountain to operate primarily in the
afternoons and evenings from early spring to early fall.
   When operating fully, it will spout 15,800 gallons of water a
minute, more than the average Louisville household consumes in two
months.
   The fountain is one of five of its kind in the world, according
to the Louisville Central Area, an agency promoting the city.
   Skip Nelson, a member of the development team of International
Fountain Developers in Cincinnati, said the second-largest such
fountain is in Fountain Hills, Ariz. That fountain was rated to run
at more than 500 feet but is actually run at less than 400 feet, he
said. Each of the other four fountains, Nelson said, is a single
jet going straight up into the air.
   But a spokesman for the company that operates the Arizona
fountain says the Louisville fountain's 400-foot advertised height
doesn't come close to theirs.
   The Arizona fountain, first turned on Dec. 15, 1970, is rated at
560 feet, which MCO Properties Inc. spokesman Keith McMahan McMahan
says it reaches any time there's no wind.

<TEXT>
   Four Andean condors that will serve as scouts
for reintroduction of the gravely threatened California condor into
the wild are headed for temporary pens in a rugged mountain range.
   The 3- and 4-month-old avian pioneers, hatched and reared in
zoos, will spend several weeks in mesh enclosures as scientists
prepare them for their first flights over the dry mountains and
foothills that once supported a thriving population of California
condors.
   The California species _ a black, vulture-like carrion eater
with a wingspan up to 9{ feet _ has dwindled to a mere 28, all in
captivity.
   Two Andean condors from the San Diego Wild Animal Park were
loaded into airline-style animal shipping crates Friday evening for
a 200-mile trip to the secret holding pens in the Los Padres
National Forest, 75 miles northeast of Los Angeles, Tom Hanscom, a
spokesman for the animal park, said in a telephone interview Friday.
   ``They want to arrive and put the birds in their new home in the
dark of night so the birds awaken the next morning thinking they
are in the same place they were before,'' Hanscom said as his crew
was ready to depart at 6:45 p.m. for the six-hour drive.
   The birds were not drugged, but were captured and wrapped in
blankets by familiar handlers, he said.
   ``By moving them in the dark it basically minimizes the
stress,'' Hanscom said.
   A third Andean condor hatched at the Los Angeles Zoo will join
the contingent, along with a fourth, flown in from a U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service center in Patuxent, Md., said Michael Wallace, the
Los Angeles Zoo biologist overseeing the program.
   The Andean birds, all females to prevent breeding in the wild,
will be used to test techniques biologists hope to use _ perhaps as
soon as 1992 _ to begin returning the California condor to nature.
More Andean condors will be added to the test flock later.
   In a $440,000 program overseen by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service, the birds will be taken to a special mesh enclosure,
measuring about 20 feet by 40 feet and 15 feet high, in rugged
territory. The exact spot is secret to deter the curious or the
malicious.
   About November, when the birds are able to fly, they will be
fitted with radio monitoring gear and released. It's expected they
will cover much of the California condor's five-county range, a
land of bare grassy hills dotted with occasional oaks, and rugged,
rocky cliffs and canyons in the mountains that ring the southern
end of the San Joaquin Valley.
   The purpose of the test, Hanscom said, is twofold: To see how
birds hatched in captivity adapt to freedom; and to see if such
birds can learn to fend for themselves in a region without native
birds of their species to serve as examples.
   The program also will help scientists spot such possible hazards
as poison bait illegally left for coyotes or lead shot in animal
carcasses left by hunters, Hanscom said.
   The Andean birds will be captured from the wild when it's time
to release their California cousins, Hanscom said. The first
California birds could be released as early as 1992 if breeding
programs are successful, he said.
   The Andean condor was chosen for the experiment because it is
the closest living relative to the California condor. Though the
Andean species is endangered, they number in the thousands.
   The California condor, North America's largest land bird, once
roamed widely along the West Coast, but its numbers had shrunk to
40 when the Fish and Wildlife Service launched a rescue effort in
1976.

<HEAD>Mexico to raise oil prices for customers in the Western Hemisphere</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ANDERSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associted Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pemex, the government oil monopoly, said
Friday it will raise prices for crude oil exports to its customers
in the Western Hemisphere on Sept. 1 but prices will remain
unchanged for exports to Europe.
   The announcement was made as the secretary-general of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, Ahmed Subroto of
Indonesia, completed a three-day visit and said Mexico had agreed
not to increase its crude exports.
   Mexico does not belong to OPEC but closely follows the 13-member
organization's pricing and production guidelines.
   Pemex said its Petroleum Foreign Trade Committee had authorized
the price increases for countries in the Western Hemisphere ``to
align prices for exports of Mexican crude with those prevailing in
the international market.''
   Sales to customers in the Western Hemisphere averaged 717,000
barrels daily between January and July _ 54 percent of Mexico's
petroleum exports during that period, according to Pemex. The
United States is the main client.
   Pemex said the price increases will be 10 cents per barrel for
light Isthmus crude and 30 cents for heavy Maya crude because of a
``technical adjustment in export formulas.''
   In July, Isthmus sold for $13.78 a barrel and Maya for $11.21 a
barrel in the Western Hemisphere.
   Subroto told a news conference that ``Mexico reiterated its
collaboration with the petroleum cartel not to increase its
production and to search for the stabilization of the market.''
   He said he was convinced of Mexico's commitment to work with
OPEC and he hoped ``soon the world petroleum market will be
stabilized.''
   The government news agency Notimex announced Friday that Pemex
has begun exports of special diesel fuel to the United States with
a 30 million-liter shipment from the Gulf of Mexico port of
Tampico. A liter is equal to 1.06 liquid quarts.
   Notimex did not identify the U.S. customer but said it was ``one
of the most important United States petroleum companies.''

   A convicted rapist who is accused of
slaying a young couple after he escaped from jail in 1983 broke out
of jail again, terrifying residents of this small community.
   Peter J. Piper, 41, stymied searchers who believed they had him
surrounded Friday in a wooded area near Big Rapids, about 15 miles
south of Reed City. Police captured his accomplice in the escape
Friday afternoon on a residential street just north of Big Rapids.
   Authorities suspended their search for Piper after hunting
through the woods with tracking dogs and finding no sign of him,
said state police Sgt. Jim Maturen.
   The area ``couldn't be searched any more thorough,'' he said.
``Once he leaves the immediate area, where's he at? There's a
million places he could be. He's still on foot, as far as we know.''
   ``We just don't have any idea where he is,'' Mecosta County
Sheriff Henry Wayer said. ``We're all going to go home tonight and
sleep on it'' and decide in the morning whether to resume the
search.
   Piper was believed armed with a handgun, Wayer said.
   Piper and inmate Mitchell A. Lund, 24, a convicted burglar,
escaped Thursday from the Osceola County Jail after beating and
tying up a guard, authorities said.
   ``Both of them are considered to be extremely dangerous,'' Lt.
Dallas Jenks, the jail administrator, said before Lund was
recaptured peacefully. ``I'm nervous about both of them being out
of my jail, but Piper would be the one I'd be most nervous about.''
   Piper, sentenced to life in prison in 1966 for the rape and
beating of a 17-year-old girl, escaped from jail in 1983. He was
captured in November 1985 in a Grand Rapids suburb where he was
staying with his sister.
   While on the run, police allege, Piper killed a couple from
Manton, a small town near here, and sexually assaulted three
prostitutes in Grand Rapids. He was convicted of the assaults and
was awaiting trial on first-degree murder charges when he and Lund
escaped.
   Police say they never determined a motive for the May 1984
killings. Richard Thompson, 21, had his throat slit and then he and
his new wife, Alida, 19, were both shot.
   ``I guess you could call him cunning,'' said State Police
Detective George Pratt, who investigated the murder. ``On an
outward appearance, he doesn't expose his violence. He's quite well
spoken, soft-spoken, and does not have the appearance of a brutal
killer.''
   At the Short Stop Party Store, clerk Tim Hinken said he sent his
wife out of town to spend the night with an aunt after news of
Piper's escape got out.
   ``Everybody is worried, I know that,'' he said.
   Lund, who faces charges of robbing a grocery store, was in a
cell next to Piper's in the maximum-security unit of the jail.
   They assaulted the guard and escaped after their cell doors were
unlocked so they could take showers and use the telephone,
authorities said. The guard, Donald Simon, was hospitalized in
stable condition Friday.
   Piper was moved to the county jail Wednesday from the Michigan
Reformatory at Ionia so he could appear at a preliminary
examination Thursday regarding the Thompson killings. The hearing
was postponed after a witness failed to show up.

   A series of mistakes by men, not machines, led
to last month's shoot-down by a Navy cruiser of an Iranian
commercial jet, but Iran must share some of the blame, say the
Pentagon's civilian and military leaders and an investigation into
the July 3 incident.
   The U.S. Vincennes fired at the Iranian A-300 Airbus in the
Persian Gulf because the cruiser mistakenly believed the plane was
an Iranian F-14 fighter taking part in an attack in the Strait of
Hormuz, according to the report.
   No Navy personnel will be disciplined, said Defense Secretary
Frank C. Carlucci and Adm. William Crowe Jr., chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, as they released the report Friday.
   ``I believe that given the operating environment, Capt. (Will
C.) Rogers (III) acted reasonably and did what his nation expected
of him in the defense of his ship and crew,'' said Crowe.
   All 290 people aboard the Airbus were killed when it was shot
down after taking off from Bandar Abbas, which Iran uses as a joint
civilian-military airfield, Crowe noted. The incident came only
minutes after the Vincennes had fired at some Iranian speedboats
which had shot at the cruiser's helicopter.
   ``By any measure, it was unconscionable (for Iran) to ignore the
repeated warnings of the United States and to permit an airliner to
take off from a joint military-civilian airfield and fly directly
into the midst of an ongoing surface action (battle) ...,'' Crowe
declared.
   But Iranian U.N. Ambassador Mohammad Ja'afar Mahallati rejected
U.S. criticism.
   ``Our civil airliner was using an internationally recognized air
corridor, used five times a week by the same captain,'' he said
Friday.
   The Iranian envoy blamed the tragedy on the U.S. Navy's presence
in the Persian Gulf.
   ``One should conclude that the mere presence of such highly
dangerous equipment, which cannot be controlled even by trained
American personnel, is the source of tension,'' he said, and called
for the U.S. fleet to pull out of the gulf.
   The Vincennes is an Aegis-class cruiser, containing the Navy's
most sophisticated air defense system. The investigators concluded,
``The Aegis Combat System's performance was excellent _ it
functioned as designed.''
   But the welter of information provided by Aegis was evaluated by
a crew seeing its first combat, and who had been warned about the
possibility of attacks from Bandar Abbas, the investigators said.
   ``Stress, task fixation and unconscious distortion of data may
have played a major role in this incident,'' concluded the
unclassified, 53-page version of the report released Friday.
   The Iranian plane was picked up by the Vincennes as a radar
contact and the crew then sought proof the plane wasn't part of the
earlier attack, the investigators noted.
   ``The proof never came. Given the time available, the commanding
officer could hardly meet his obligation to protect his ship and
crew and also clear up all of the possible anomalies or
ambiguities,'' said Crowe.
   The United States has apologized and informed Iran it will offer
compensation to the victims' families. Iran, which was scheduled
today to begin a cease-fire in its long war with Iraq, has accused
the United States of deliberately shooting the plane down.
   The investigative report dismissed that charge, stating:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ``The USS Vincennes did not purposely shoot down an Iranian
commercial airliner. Rather, it engaged an aircraft the commanding
officer ... believed to be hostile and a threat to his ship and to
the (nearby frigate) USS Montgomery.''
   Crowe said that some of the mistakes by the Vincennes' crew
included:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _A conclusion the civilian Airbus was descending rather than
ascending as it approached the Vincennes, implying the plane was
preparing to attack.
   _A conclusion the jetliner had transmitted a radio signal
identifying it as a military aircraft.
   _A report the plane was outside a commercial air corridor
crossing the Persian Gulf.
   Rogers also had a short ``critical decision window,'' the report
states. Only seven minutes passed from the time the ship detected
the airplane taking off until its destruction.
   ``And from the time the CO (Rogers) first became aware of (the
plane) as a possible threat, until he made his decision to engage,
the elapsed time was approximately 3 minutes, 40 seconds,'' the
report states.
   ``The fog of war and those human elments which affect each
individual differently ... are factors that must be considered.
Stress, task fixation and unconscious distortion of data may have
played a major role in this incident.''
   Carlucci said the investigation would lead to a number of
changes in operations, including modifying the devices that display
critical information on approaching targets in the cruisers and
subjecting the operators of the Aegis system to psychological
testing to ensure they are ready for combat.

   Soviet spelunkers, joining explorers from
the United States and two other nations, have concluded a 10-day
probe of Lechuguilla Cave, the third-deepest cavern in the United
States.
   The cave is in a designated wilderness area of the Carlsbad
Caverns National Park and is known to be at least 21.1 miles in
length. That makes it the deepest cave in New Mexico _ at least
one-third of a mile longer than the surveyed length of the Carlsbad
Caverns.
   The two known deeper caves are in Wyoming.
   Seventy cavers from 18 states, Canada, Switzerland and the
Soviet Union participated in the expedition.
   Project leaders Rick Bridges and Roy Glasier said the group
discovered a considerable amount of ``spongework,'' or passageways,
that add to the cave's complexity.
   Among other findings were a 30-inch gypsum ``flower'' and gypsum
formations resembling yarn and cotton balls.
   The cave has a 90-foot vertical drop at its entrance, according
to park officials. Explorers have known about the cave opening and
entrance room since about 1914. At that time, the cave was mined
for guano, or bat waste.
   Extensive exploration of the cave began four years ago.

Law</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A day-labor firm will be fined $60,000 for
violating the new federal immigration law _ a reduced fine that
still is the largest ever levied for such violations, federal
immigration officials said.
   The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service initially fined
Ready-Men, a company that provides temporary help to construction
firms and factories, $308,000 for hiring five illegal immigrants
and committing more than 515 violations in record-keeping.
   After two months of negotiations, however, the two sides agreed
on the smaller fine.
   ``It's not our intention to put anyone out of business,'' A.D.
Moyer, the Chicago INS director, said Friday. ``The moment that I'm
assured that they are doing everything they can to comply with the
law, then I'm satisfied.''
   He said the company was now ``on the right track'' and that the
settlement demonstrates the effectiveness of the law.
   Ready-Man president James Heraty said he felt the sanction was
fair and that his company would try to be ``a model company'' in
the industry.
   Heraty did acknowledge that the new law makes his business more
difficult and that he occasionally has trouble finding enough
workers.
   ``I have never found so many people who don't have the ID they
need to get hired,'' he said at a news conference.
   The immigration law passed by Congress in 1986 initially allowed
some illegal aliens to seek amnesty and apply for legal residency
in the United States. The yearlong amnesty ended in May.
   The second phase of the law, begun in June 1987, makes employers
responsible for verifying that their workers are legal residents
and provides for fines if companies knowingly hire illegal aliens.
   Before the law, employers faced no sanctions for hiring illegal
aliens.

   Here are excerpts of remarks at a news
conference Friday by Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci and Adm.
William Crowe, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, on the
results of a Navy investigation of the downing of an Iranian
jetliner by the USS Vincennes:
   Carlucci: ``It's important to bear in mind that this ship was
engaged in combat with Iranian Boghammers (armed speedboats). There
had been reports of sounds of metal hitting the side of the ship,
which we assumed and still assume today were bullets from the
Boghammer. The ship had ... to turn a 30-degree turn. This turn
took place just at the crucial decision point, so it was heeling
over at about a 32-degree angle.
   ``Things were falling in the CIC (Combat Information Center),
lights were flickering, and in the background, guns were booming. I
dare say it would be hard to even have this press conference under
those conditions, much less reach crucial decisions on a number of
targets during a very short timeframe. Nonetheless, the
investigators found that the captain acted prudently on the basis
of the information available to him. Both Admiral Crowe and I and
General (George) Crist (head of the U.S. Central Command) concurred
in that judgment.''
   Crowe: ``An examination of the events on 3 July leads quickly to
the conclusion that Iran must share the responsibility of the
tragedy, and the investigation so found. By any measure, it was
unconscionable to ignore the repeated warnings of the United States
and to permit an airliner to take off from a joint
military-civilian airfield and fly directly into the midst of the
ongoing surface action in the Strait of Hormuz, which the Iranians
themselves had initiated.
   ``The tragic events of July 3rd did not occur in a vacuum, as
the Secretary explained to you. They happened in an area where
36-37 American sailors on board USS Stark had been killed by an air
attack in May 1987, and where our military has been tested by fire
time and again over the last year. The actions of Captain (Will)
Rogers and the Vincennes crew must be judged in that context ....
   ``During the critical seven minutes that Flight 655 was
airborne, Captain Rogers and his CIC team were conducting a surface
action, tracking a multitude of contacts, coordinating U.S. units,
and trying to sort out friend from foe with spotty information. He
had a genuine dilemma ....
   ``The villains of the piece were six significant problems which
plagued the captain and which he could not control or discount.
Vincennes was engaged in intense surface action with Iranian
gunboats. The unidentified, assumed hostile contact had taken off
from an airfield used by military aircraft.
   ``The flight was heading directly at Vincennes, and its range
was relentlessly closing. The unknown aircraft radiated no
definitive radar emissions. Seven Vincennes warnings went
unacknowledged and unanswered. The compression of time gave him an
extremely short decision window, less than five minutes.
   ``It was only prudent for Captain Rogers to assume that the
contact was related to his engagement with the Iranian boats until
proven otherwise. The proof never came. Given the time available,
the commanding officer could hardly meet his obligation to protect
his ship and crew and also clear up all of the possible anomalies _
or ambiguities ....
   ``Admiral Fogarty's investigation also revealed that mistakes
were made on board Vincennes that day. That, in itself, is not
surprising to anyone who understands the stress of hostile action
in a life-or-death situation. No military combat operation is
flawless, even when there is a successful outcome ....
   ``Our early Washington briefings of the accident were based on
information received from the ship shortly after the action, some
of which were found by the investigation to be incorrect ....
   ``Questions have been raised about the ship's initial report
that the aircraft was outside of the air corridor. The report was
wrong. ... Perhaps the most puzzling mistake was the ultimate call
of Flight 655 as descending instead of climbing ....
   ``In fact, the investigation concluded that the time between the
initial report of decreasing altitude and the decision to fire was
in the neighborhood of 20 to 30 seconds. It is impossible to say
with assurance how those two inputs bore on the commanding
officer's final decision. But it is important to keep in mind that
the C.O. had this information for only 20 to 30 seconds and that
during this interval he was involved in other things, as well as
the preparations to fire ....
   ``Singly, the errors or mistakes were not crucial to the fateful
decision. Even cumulatively, they do not appear to change the
picture in a decisive way. The commanding officer never received
the clear evidence that he felt he needed to establish that the
Iranian aircraft had not come to participate in the ongoing surface
action ....
   ``I believe that given the operating environment, Captain Rogers
acted reasonably and did what his nation expected of him in the
defense of his ship and crew.
   Q: What did the crew of the Vincennes do right?
   Carlucci: ``Well, the question is not whether mistakes were
made. Mistakes are made in virtually every combat situation. The
question is whether the mistakes were made through negligence, or
whether there is culpability. And the determination is that, no,
these mistakes were not due to negligence or culpability.''
   Q: So the equipment itself and the procedures did contribute to
the errors made?
   Carlucci: ``No, the equipment functioned as designed. We cannot
find any errors in the equipment. ... And we're taking this
experience, and trying to make some improvements that will make it
easier for people to read the display and to communicate with each
other. Once again, who knows whether these would have been critical
elements. It does not seem to me that they are critical elements at
all.''

   A younger brother of the Soviet-backed leader
of Afghanistan, Najib, says he broke with his brother because he
imposed an ``infamous regime'' on the Afghan people by force of
arms.
   ``He is not being supported by anyone so far as the Afghans are
concerned,'' Sediqullah Rahi told reporters Friday at the State
Department. ``The only support he has is the Soviet Union. He has
tried to impose his regime by way of bayonets.''
   The defection of Rahi, his wife Soraya,and their two young sons
is a propaganda coup for the United States, which has provided
Stinger missiles and other weapons to guerrillas who are at war
with the Afghan and Soviet armies.
   Rahi, 37, who had worked for the Kabul government as a banker,
broke with his brother several years ago and, after serving some
months in prison, fled with his family to the mountains last winter.
   They crossed into Pakistan last month and arrived in Washington
this week where they were granted refuge immediately and given the
protection of bodyguards.
   Rahi said the escape was arranged by Ahmed Shah Massoud, leader
of one of the factions at war with his brother's forces, and that
they had to change getaway cars seven times and houses three times
on their way from Kabul to Massoud's mountain hideaway.
   ``We were constantly under surveillance and they were following
us,'' Mrs. Rahi said. Her bearded husband nodded his concurrence.
   Rahi denounced his brother as ``mentally deranged and the sadist
type.'' He said the government's strength is waning and its morale
is very low.
   The Soviets are in the midst of withdrawing their troops from
Afghanistan where they had backed the Kabul government in an
8{-year war with the rebels.
   Once the Red Army is gone, Rahi said, the government will fall.
``He has tried to impose his regime by way of bayonets,'' Rahi said
of his brother. The rebels ``are the true fighters and defenders of
our country.''
   Rahi said he expected the Soviets to try to rescue elements of
the pro-Moscow government by arranging a coalition with other
Afghan forces. He said Najib might be given haven in the Soviet
Union or another communist country.
   Asked about the Afghan president's claims that his government
can survive without the support of Soviet troops, Rahi said:
``Sheer lies.''
   There are two younger brothers. Tradition binds them to Najib
even if they disagree with him, Rahi said.
   He said the two brothers were trained in Cuba and are working
for the KGB secret police. He said he broke with tradition.
   Mrs. Rahi offered assurances that the rebels were not the sort
of fundamentalists who rule neighboring Iran.
   ``This is something the Afghan people would repel and
repudiate,'' she said.
   Rahi, meanwhile, paid tribute to President Mohammed Zia ul-Haq
of Pakistan, who perished in an airplane crash Wednesday, as a
staunch supporter of the rebels.
   American weapons are funneled through Pakistan to the rebels,
and Pakistan has taken in millions of Afghan refugees.
   Referring to reports of a bomb exploding aboard the presidential
plane, Rahi said, ``This makes one wonder whether this was arranged
by the Kabul regime and India in order to muddy up the situation so
they could take advantage of it for some ulterior motive.''
   He added through an interpreter: ``This could have possibly been
one of the Soviets' intrigues and tricks. Simply, they realized by
trying some diplomatic maneuvers they could not move away Gen. Zia
from his support of the resistance so they decided this could be
the last remedy.''
   Asked if he had evidence to support the allegation, Rahi said:
``We have no evidence. We simply are thinking that because the
Soviets had given Zia warning many, many times that they will take
proper action in due course, if necessary.''

   The Centers for Disease Control disputes a
study by the Hudson Institute that the number of Americans infected
with the deadly AIDS virus is actually twice the official estimate.
   In a study released Friday, the Hudson Institute said that up to
3 million Americans are infected by the AIDS virus, an estimate
that is far above the calculation by CDC, the primary federal
agency monitoring the spread of AIDS.
   Kevin R. Hopkins, a Hudson mathematician, said his study uses
``realistic'' assumptions not used by the CDC and, as a result, his
estimate is closer to the true number of Americans infected by the
human immunodeficiency virus which causes AIDS.
   ``The actual number of people carrying the HIV virus in the
United States (at the end of 1987) was not the 900,000 to 1.4
million the official sources estimate, but probably more than twice
that number,'' the Hudson report said.
   ``There were between 2 and 3 million people infected with the
AIDS virus, with the most likely total of infections probably close
to 2.4 million,'' the report said.
   Dr. Timothy Dondero, chief of a CDC branch studying the spread
of AIDS, quickly disputed the claim, however.
   In a telephone interview from the CDC headquarters in Atlanta,
Dondero said he and his staff reviewed the Hudson study and the
methods used and said, ``We do not feel a change in our data is
appropriate.''
   He said that for the Hudson model to be correct, about 2 percent
of the young adult population in the United States would have to be
infected with HIV. Yet, he said, ``their figures are inconsistently
high within segments of populations for which there are test
results.''
   Dondero said tests from hospital patients, military recruits and
prisoners show HIV infection rates of less than 1 percent _ 0.2
percent to 0.66 percent _ among young adults.
   Hopkins admitted, ``We're all in a guessing game'' when it comes
to estimating the number of people infected with the AIDS virus.
Nonetheless, he said he believed the Hudson method is a more
realistic model or mathematical estimate of the situation.
   ``The CDC may be right and we may be wrong,'' Hopkins said.
``Until a national seroprevalence test is conducted, we will not
know. ... The main conclusion is that we cannot be complacent about
this disease.''
   The study by Hudson, a privately financed public policy research
organization with headquarters in Indianapolis, used basic CDC data
on the number of AIDS cases. But Hopkins said Hudson used different
computer models and more sophisticated statistical analysis
techniques to estimate the rate of HIV infections.
   Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome, which is caused by the HIV
virus, is the end stage of the disease and may not develop for
years after a person is infected with the virus. But an infected
person can spread the virus before developing AIDS. For this
reason, experts are attempting to estimate the rate of infection in
order to gauge the future extent of the epidemic.
   HIV infection is determined by a blood test which identifies
antibodies in blood serum. A person with such antibodies is known
as seropositive.
   Hopkins said the Hudson study also estimated that the number of
heterosexuals infected by the virus may be three times higher than
CDC estimates.
   The CDC says the chief victims of AIDS, a contagious disease
that attacks the body's immune system, have been homosexual men and
intravenous drug users.
   The Hudson study estimates that of the 850,000 to 1.4 million
heterosexuals infected with the HIV virus, between 200,000 and
500,000 are those who do not use drugs.
   ``There are vastly more heterosexuals infected today,'' said
Hopkins. ``A breakout into the non-monogamous population is
unavoidable.''
   The CDC has estimated that the AIDS virus has infected only
80,000 to 165,000 of the non-drug-using heterosexual population.
   The Hudson report said about 118,000 of the heterosexuals
infected are ``mainstream'' population members.
   ``They are not poor, and they are not IV drug users,'' Hudson
said. ``But they are nonetheless carriers of the virus and, through
their sexual contacts, can proceed to spread the disease to others
of their same class.''
   The CDC says that as of Aug. 15, 1988, AIDS had been diagnosed
in 70,702 Americans, of whom more than half, or 39,898, have died
since June 1, 1981. No one is known to have recovered from AIDS.

<HEAD>Quayle's Military Record Dominates Campaign Following GOP
Convention</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: Tops prospects uncertain</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By CAROLYN SKORNECK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The military record of Republican vice presidential nominee Sen.
Dan Quayle dominated the campaign as the Republican and Democratic
tickets launched road shows on the final stretch to the November
election, the political conventions now just a memory of balloons
and patriotic music.
   Despite the controversy over whether Quayle used family
influence to get into the National Guard and duck combat in the
Vietnam War, the Republican ticket led by George Bush rode the
crest of publicity from the just-ended GOP convention in New
Orleans into a dead heat in the polls against Democrats Michael
Dukakis and Lloyd Bentsen.
   A CNN-USA Today poll released Friday of 842 registered voters
put the race at 45 percent for Bush-Quayle to 44 percent for
Dukakis-Bentsen. The spreads for the survey conducted Thursday
night were within the poll's 4 percentage point margin of error.
   Bush and Quayle planned joint appearances today in Ohio, while
Dukakis and Bentsen were scheduled to visit the LBJ Ranch outside
Austin, Texas.
   The Republican standard bearers were buoyed Friday by a
supportive crowd in Quayle's hometown of Huntington, Ind., where
boos and hoots of ``b-o-r-i-n-g'' greeted reporters' questions
about the Guard issue at an outdoor news conference.
   The conservative 41-year-old, two-term Indiana senator
acknowledged that a family friend made calls on his behalf after he
expressed interest in joining the Guard in 1969, but he insisted:
``I got in fairly.''
   ``You're going to be surprised at how outraged people and
families that identify with the National Guard around America are
going to be towards these accusations,'' Quayle said.
   According to an ABC News poll released Friday, 63 percent of 613
registered voters contacted Thursday night said the fact that
Quayle entered the National Guard at a time when others faced
possible service in Vietnam should not be a campaign issue.
Twenty-three percent said it should be a minor issue and 11 percent
a major issue.
   But if it turns out that Quayle used family influence to get
into the Guard, the poll results changed, with 23 percent saying it
should be a major issue, 27 percent a minor issue and 47 percent
saying it should not be a campaign issue. The poll had a margin of
error of plus or minus 5 percentage points.
   Quayle said he turned to his parents for advice during his
senior year in college as he faced the loss of college deferment
from the draft following graduation.
   The family discussed the matter with Wendell C. Phillippi, a
former commander of the Indiana National Guard who worked for
Quayle's grandfather at the Indianapolis News, Quayle said, adding,
``I would assume that calls would be made.''
   Phillippi has said he contacted the Guard on Quayle's behalf.
   Bush stood by Quayle at the rally, calling him ``a young man of
vision, of character.''
   Meanwhile, Dukakis and Bentsen took separate campaign trails
before meeting up in Dallas for a fund-raising event Friday night.
   Dukakis, the Democratic presidential nominee, took an indirect
shot at Bush and Quayle, telling a rally in Bismarck, Mo.: ``The
test of strong presidential leadership is strength, the quality of
the people you select to serve with you.''
   On a day that saw him in rural Illinois, Missouri and Arkansas,
the Massachusetts governor said Bush's convention address Thursday
night ``wasn't a bad speech actually,'' but he criticized it for
what it did not discuss.
   ``He talked a lot about missions but I must have missed a
page,'' said Dukakis, who did not watch Bush's speech but reviewed
its text. ``There was nothing in there about the two biggest
economic challenges we face in this country,'' he said.
   ``We didn't hear a word from the Republicans on the budget
deficit or the trade deficit last night or this week. And we know
why. They don't know how to deal with it. They don't know what to
do with it. That's why we're going to have a Democratic president
and vice president.''
   Bentsen, meanwhile, stayed on home turf in Texas, where he
criticized the Republican National Convention as a ``Mardi Gras for
the Moral Majority'' that ignored the concerns of working people.
   Like Dukakis, the Texas senator said Bush's convention address
did not deal with ``how the Republicans are going to face some of
the real problems'' of America, including trade and budget deficits.
   ``Let's face some facts,'' Bentsen said in Dallas. ``What we saw
was the Republicans putting on a convention for the Far Right. They
had a Mardi Gras for the Moral Majority.''
   ``The hard right drove the Republican agenda,'' Bentsen said.
``There was no reaching out for the center as we have done in the
Democratic Party.''
   Bentsen confirmed a report in Friday's Washington Post that his
blind trust invested in his son's business after being steered
there by the senator. He said he reported the investment, even
though he didn't have to do so.
   He said his wife's position as a trustee on a mutual fund
affiliated with the manager of his trust in no way compromised the
blind trust.

<HEAD>Indians To March to Reagan's Ranch To Protest `Primitive
Lifestyle' Remarks</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SANTA BARBARA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Indians are going ahead
with a march to President Reagan's ranch to protest his remarks
during the Moscow summit about Indians' ``primitive lifestyle,''
despite White House assurances that the president will meet with
them in Washington.
   The American Indian Action Group and the White House said Friday
that arrangements were being made for such a meeting. The Indians,
who already had planned today's demonstration, said they would
proceed with it because they had made a commitment and people were
traveling distances to participate.
   Reagan told students at Moscow University in May, ``Maybe we
made a mistake in trying to maintain Indian cultures. Maybe we
should not have humored them in wanting to stay in that kind of
primitive lifestyle.''
   The president also suggested that perhaps the government should
have told the Indians, ``No, come join us. Be citizens along with
the rest of us.''
   American Indians were made full citizens by an act of Congress
in 1924.
   The president's remarks were greeted with outrage by many Indian
leaders. Reagan said he would meet with them ``at any time,'' but
the Indians said he failed to respond to letters and telephone
calls from them.
   A member of the American Indian Action Group who said she used
only the name Pilula said that White House spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater telephoned the group Thursday after plans for the
demonstration had been announced.
   Fitzwater spoke with Michael Zarate, a spokesman for the group,
and said that a letter would follow, Pilula said. Neither Zarate
nor Fitzwater could be reached for comment Friday afternoon.
   Pilula said she assumed Fitzwater's call was prompted by the
announcement of the demonstration, as ``he would not have had any
other reason to call us.''
   ``We did let him know that we would go ahead,'' she said.
   Deputy White House Press Secretary Bob Hall said presidential
aides would meet with the Indians soon, probably while the
president is vacationing at his ranch, to arrange a meeting between
Reagan and the Indians after the president returns to Washington on
Sept. 6.
   ``During his administration, Reagan has never met with Indian
leaders,'' the group said in a statement. ``The remarks he made in
Moscow were his first reference to American Indians in eight
years.''
   The group said more than 200 American Indians were expected to
rally at Refugio State Beach and then walk to the gate of the
president's ranch 20 miles north of Santa Barbara in the Santa Ynez
Mountains.
   The Reagans arrived at the ranch Tuesday from New Orleans, where
the president addressed the Republican National Convention. They
will go to Los Angeles next Tuesday for a five-day stay.
   On the way to Los Angeles, the president will stop at the Marine
Operations Building of the Port of Long Beach to sign a landmark
bill designed to reduce U.S. deficits in world trade. The president
already has indicated that he would sign the bill, and Tuesday is
the deadline for him to do so. The Long Beach setting was chosen
for the ceremony because of the port's role in overseas trade.
   The bill would authorize U.S. negotiators to reach agreements in
the current Uruguay Round of international trade and talks and
would streamline the government system of import curbs, designed to
protect American business and retaliate against trade violations.

<HEAD>Judge Refuses To Dismiss Case Against CIA Agent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former CIA agent Joseph F. Fernandez, a
defendant in the Iran-Contra case, lost a bid to have criminal
charges dismissed on the grounds that his congressional testimony
was used against him improperly by prosecutors.
   U.S. District Judge Aubrey E. Robinson Jr. on Friday denied a
motion to dismiss the charges against Fernandez that accuse him of
conspiring to ship arms illegally to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels
and concealing the covert operation.
   However, Robinson ordered independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh
to submit by Sept. 23 detailed documentation to show his evidence
against Fernandez was obtained independently of testimony the
former CIA agent gave to the House-Senate committees that
investigated the Iran-Contra affair.
   Fernandez, 51, who operated under the pseudonym Tomas Castillo
when he was the CIA station chief in Costa Rica, testified before
the committees under a grant of ``use immunity.'' That meant that
prosecutors cannot use his congressional testimony against him in
the criminal case and cannot obtain evidence based on leads
provided by the immunized testimony.
   Robinson directed prosecutors to turn over to the court a list
of all CIA witnesses who were interviewed after Fernandez gave his
congressional testimony and the basis for the discussion.
   Walsh has denied defense contentions that he relied on
congressional testimony as a source of evidence in the case.
   Fernandez is accused of conspiring to ship arms to the Contras,
who oppose Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government, in defiance
of a congressional ban on such aid. Fernandez also is charged with
lying to the CIA and the presidential commission headed by former
Sen. John Tower, R-Texas, that investigated the Iran-Contra affair.
   The judge, meanwhile, also ordered Fernandez to comply with the
provisions of the Classified Information Procedures Act, refusing
to declare unconstitutional the statute that requires defendants to
notify the court of any plans to reveal government secrets at trial.
   All defendants in the Iran-Contra case _ Fernandez, former
National Security Council aide Oliver L. North, former national
security adviser John M. Poindexter and arms dealers Albert Hakim
and retired Maj. Gen. Richard V. Secord _ are to be tried
separately, but no date has been set for any of the trials.
   North and Secord are named as unindicted co-conspirators in the
case against Fernandez.

   Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis
was campaigning in Texas today with running mate Lloyd Bentsen, the
man Dukakis increasingly talks about as George Bush defends his
choice to fill the Republican ticket.
   ``Isn't it great to have a Democratic nominee for the vice
presidency whose qualifications have never been questioned by
anyone?'' Dukakis asked rhetorically Friday evening at a rally in
Walnut Ridge, Ark., before he flew here.
   ``The true test of leadership is to be able to make the big
decisions, to choose the best people, and to inspire confidence in
government,'' Dukakis told a crowd of about 2,000 people. ``That's
the test of true leadership.''
   Dukakis has been using lines similar to those since Republican
nominee Bush chose 41-year-old Indiana Sen. Dan Quayle as his
running mate, a selection that was followed quickly by questions
about whether Quayle was qualified to step in as president and
whether he used family influence to get into the National Guard in
1969 to duck combat duty in Vietnam.
   Dukakis and Bentsen appeared together Friday night at a Dallas
fund-raiser and were traveling today to the LBJ Ranch outside
Austin. Dukakis also was to stop in Tennessee on his way home to
Boston.
   The Walnut Ridge stop was the end of a Dukakis whistle stop
train swing Friday through rural Illinois, Missouri and Arkansas.
He drew large crowds at all four depots he visited and was joined
at each by numerous elected officials.
   ``Today we begin that journey to the future,'' Dukakis told the
depot rallies. ``And we begin it in the style of another great
Democratic president, Harry S. Truman,'' he said at Walnut Ridge.
   While he indirectly criticized Bush's selection of Quayle and
the senator's credentials, Dukakis aggressively attacked Bush's
acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention, which the
Democrat said was ``missing a page'' because it failed to address
how a Bush presidency would deal with the budget and trade deficits.
   ``Nowhere in it was there a word about the two most important
economic challenges that will face the next president of the United
States,'' Dukakis said of the Bush speech. ``The first is eight
years of running up budget deficits that have added more to the
national debt than all of the presidents from George Washington to
Jimmy Carter combined. And the second was a record trade deficit.''
   At his second stop Friday, in Bismarck, Mo., Dukakis said Bush
or other Republicans failed to mention the deficits during their
convention because ``they don't know how to deal with it.''
   He labeled attacks by Bush and other Republicans on him the sign
of a ``losing campaign.''
   ``I don't think that you can go to the American people and seek
their support for the presidency if you spend 80 and 90 percent of
your time cutting up the other guy,'' Dukakis said.
   ``The Duke Express'' traveled through the heartland the day
after Bush accepted the Republican presidential nomination.
   The Massachusetts governor at each of the rallies mentioned his
state's unemployment rate has been about 3 percent for several
years while the jobless rates in each of the towns he visited was
near 10 percent. Dukakis blamed Reagan administration policies
that, he said, fueled prosperity in some regions but ignored and
exacerbated economic distress in others.
   ``They may be satisfied, but we aren't,'' Dukakis said. ``We can
do a lot better.''
   Dukakis repeatedly mentioned the deficits, a lack of affordable
housing, the Pentagon procurement scandal and the stewardship of
former Attorney General Edwin Meese III. He said Republicans ducked
those issues at their convention.
   Dukakis led the crowds in the refrain ``not a single word from
the Republicans'' after mentioning each of those issues.
   The candidate drew laughs from reporters in Bismarck when he
joked about criticism from Republicans that Dukakis and his wife,
Kitty, show too much affection in public.
   ``It's true that Democrats sleep in double beds and Republicans
prefer twins,'' he said. ``That's why there are more Democrats.''
   Bentsen, meanwhile, campaigning across his home state, said
Bush's convention address didn't deal with ``how the Republicans
are going to face some of the real problems'' of America.
   For example, he said, ``If you're worried about health care for
the elderly or for children, we didn't hear any of the specifics
about how those concerns are going to be met.''
   ``Let's face some facts. What we saw was the Republicans putting
on a convention for the Far Right,'' Bentsen said. ``They had a
Mardi Gras for the Moral Majority.''

   South and North Korean delegates ended a
second day of talks Saturday but failed to make major progress on
clearing the way for full-scale talks on a non-aggression pact and
sharing the Olympic Games.
   They agreed to a third meeting Monday.
   The two sides appeared far apart on all main issues as lawmakers
from each side met in the South Korean pavilion at the truce site
straddling the Demilitarized Zone separating the two Koreas. On
Friday, delegates met in the North Korean pavilion.
   The five-member delegations shook hands and cracked jokes before
beginning negotiations, but observers described the mood as guarded.
   Chief South Korean delegate Park Joon-kyu, in an opening speech,
offered a number of minor concessions on the terms for holding
joint parliamentary talks. The changes were basically rewordings of
proposals and the South did not revise its main positions.
   North Korea's delegates said the South was making discussions
more complex without making progress.
   ``There is nothing new in your proposal,'' said chief North
Korean delegate Chon Kum Chol.
   The North Korean delegation continued to press for full-scale
parliamentary talks on a non-aggression pact and allowing the North
to co-host the Olympic Games that begin Sept. 17 in Seoul.
   South Korea showed no willingness to back down on its position
that the only solution for the Olympics was for the North to
participate in the Games in Seoul, but that co-hosting was
impossible.
   The meeting on Friday also ended with no progress. Before the
sides met, Park said he was optimistic an agreement could be
negotiated, but after the working meeting, he rated chances for
holding full talks at ``50-50.''
   Park said he needs ``a little bit of glasnost'' _ using Soviet
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's catchword for openness _ from North
Korea before agreeing to full talks on easing their 40-year rivalry.
   The Korean peninsula was divided north and south at the end of
World War II in 1945. The nations technically are still at war
since no peace treaty was signed after the Korean War of 1950-53.
   North Korean has called for a joint meeting of the two
countries' parliaments, involving nearly 1,000 lawmakers, to
discuss the Olympics and a non-aggression pact.
   South Korea sought to call a ``representative meeting'' of 20
lawmakers from each side, whose main business would be to fix the
agenda and work out other details for full talks.
   The North Koreans also proposed that both legislatures make a
joint declaration of non-aggression, bypassing their governments.
   Seoul maintains that military matters must be handled by the
executive branches of the two governments. Park said the North
Koreans are trying to avoid dealing with President Roh Tae-woo, and
get 42,000 U.S. troops withdrawn from South Korea.
   Chief North Korean delegate Chon Kum Chol reinterated his
country's demand to share in the Olympics. He said the event ``is
not a simple sports game but a serious political problem which will
decide the destiny of the Korean people.''
   Park said the only solution was for North Korea to participate
in the Games. He said South Korea would keep the door open for
North Korea's participation, but noted the deadline for entries is
Sept. 2.
   North Korea is demanding to be a o-host at the Olympics to stave
off a major political defeat. Both sides claim to be the sole
legitimate government of Korea. South Korea sees its selection to
be host of the Olympics as international recognition of its claim.
   The International Olympic Committee says North Korea cannot be a
co-host because the Games are awarded to a single city. South
Korean authorities say North Korea may use terrorism to try to
disrupt the Olympics.
   Sporadic talks between the two sides since the early 1970s
failed to make progress on easing hostilities. The last talks
collapsed in January 1986 when North Korea pulled out to protest
annual South Korean-U.S. military exercises.

   Randall McBride, 31, was sentenced Friday. It was one of the
longest prison terms ever imposed for violation of wildlife

   McBride, of Shelbourne, near Toronto, was convicted of
attempting to smuggle out of the country 37 native Australian birds
with an estimated value of $400,000 on the black market.
   He also was convicted of importing foreign birds into Australia.
Customs officials at Sydney airport said they discovered in his

   Police say they arrested a man who
admitted setting 62 fires in three years _ an arson record.
   No one was injured in the fires, which caused an estimated $15
million damage. The 36-year-old man told investigators he used
paper and a lighter to start the fires, always on weekends.
   ``To us, it seems that the man had a need to fill up his
weekends with excitement,'' police spokesman Bjoern Haneborg said
Friday. The man was not identified in keeping with Norwegian police
regulations.
   The first fire was in the man's hometown of Sandefjord, 50 miles
south of Oslo on May 12, 1985. The last one was in nearby
Holemstrand on June 13, police said.
   According to police, he set a Norwegian arson record. A man who
set 44 fires had been on record as the country's worst arsonist.

<HEAD>Spending on Banquets, Luxuries Goes Unchecked</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Government offices continue to waste money on
lavish banquets, imported cars and luxury gifts in defiance of
government austerity orders, an official daily said today.
   The English-language China Daily, quoting earlier press reports,
said consumer spending by government organizations totaled $10
billion during the first seven months of the year, up 19.8 percent
from the same period in 1987.
   The increase came despite orders that government offices reduce
spending on consumer items by 20 percent this year.
   The report said the amount spent on feasting and luxury items
this year is already more than the total year's budget for
education and urban construction.
   According to the State Statistical Bureau, restaurants in large
hotels earn 60 percent to 70 percent of their income from offices
using public funds for banquets. One dinner at an expensive hotel
can cost the same as a factory worker's monthly salary.
   The report cited sharp increases in purchases of imported
vehicles, color televisions, motorcycles, air conditioners, sofas
and carpets despite a government freeze on buying such items.
   Government offices are also spending large amounts on expensive
``gifts'' such as quartz clocks, leather suitcases and cosmetics,
mainly to gain access to hard-to-get goods and services, the report
said.
   The Communist Party this week outlined a five-year economic
reform package that said one top goal for 1989 was to reduce
purchasing power of government organizations while countering waste
and extravagance in the party and bureaucracy.

<TEXT>
   Nurses at six private hospitals rejected
Friday by a 2-1 margin a tentative contract that would have boosted
their pay 20 percent over three years and halted a 2{-week-old
strike that closed some emergency rooms.
   About 65 percent of the 2,200 striking nurses voted on the
offer, said Maureen Anderson, spokeswoman for the California Nurses
Association.
   ``The strike is growing stronger, which is unusual,'' she said.
   The nurses' negotiating team had recommended the contract, but
not unanimously, according to the union, which had sought a bigger
pay raise.
   A spokesman for Affiliated Hospitals, representing the six
struck hospitals, criticized the rejection as ``unreasonable and
totally unjustified.''
   Karen Henry, the hospitals' chief negotiator, said the offer not
only would have made the nurses among the highest paid in the
nation but also exceeded the union's settlements with other
hospitals in the area.
   Responded Anderson: ``They're also paying lower than any other
hospitals in the area.''
   The agreement was reached early Thursday after negotiators sat
through two consecutive, 17-hour bargaining sessions.
   The pact called for raises of 7.5 percent, 6.5 percent and 6
percent over three years, bringing salary for top nurses on the
night shift to about $50,000. The union had originally raises of
sought 11 percent and 10 percent over two years.
   ``A lot of people out here are disappointed,'' nurse Gary
Cardiel said Thursday of the tentative agreement. ``It's a slap in
the face, and I don't think I'm going to vote for it.''
   The hospitals affected by the strike are St. Francis,
Children's, Marshal Hale, St. Mary's and Mount Zion in San
Francisco and Seton Medical Center in Daly City.
   In addition to the nurses, 1,700 hospital service workers
honoring the strike have stayed off the job.
   John G. Williams, board president of the Affiliated Hospitals,
acknowledged that the hospitals lost patients during the strike,
but he could not provide numbers or an estimate of how much the
strike cost.
   But Anderson said income for the hospitals was 50 percent below
normal and that the institutions were further hurt financially by
paying up to $56 an hour to substitute nurses from Texas and
Florida.
   ``It was just an economic nightmare for them,'' Anderson said
Thursday. ``It was just a lot of red tape and a lot of money for
them.''

   .
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ A land mine destroyed a
military bus carrying British soldiers to their barracks Friday
night, killing seven troopers and injuring 29 others, police said.
   The military bus, which bore no markings, was taking 38 soldiers
to their barracks at Omagh, 50 miles west of Belfast, following
their leaves in England, said a spokesman at the British Army's
headquarters at Lisburn near Belfast.
   The vehicle detonated the mine nine miles from the soldiers'
barracks, on the road between Omagh and Ballygawley in County
Tyrone.
   Paddy Bogan, president of Northern Ireland's centrist Alliance
Party, who lives near the scene of the blast, described the attack
as ``a terrible slaughter.''
   Bogan, who went to the scene with other local people, said:
``The bus was a mess of mangled metal. It was a miracle anyone got
out of it alive. The faces of the injured were terribly cut and
bleeding.''
   A press officer at Belfast police headquarters said a report in
the initial confusion at the scene of the blast that the final
death toll could mount to at least 13 could now be discounted.
   No one claimed responsibility, but police suspected guerrillas
of the outlawed Irish Republican Army. The army spokesman spoke on
condition of anonymity, in keeping with British practice.
   Police and army units rushed in to seal off the area and search
for the killers, while ambulances took the casualties to Tyrone
County Hospital.
   The predominantly Roman Catholic IRA is fighting to drive the
British out of Northern Ireland, a province where Protestants
outnumber Catholics 3-2, and unite it with the Catholic Irish
Republic.
   Police blamed IRA guerrillas for two other bombings Friday. One
injured three police officers and the other damaged Northern
Ireland's newest luxury hotel.
   Also on Friday, funerals were held for a British soldier IRA
guerrillas killed last week in Belgium and for a Protestant grocer
shot to death Wednesday in his Belfast store.
   The three police officers were wounded when they responded to a
ringing burglary alarm early Friday at a gas station in Lisnaskea,
62 miles west of Belfast. Officials said one of the officers, a
26-year-old woman, lost an eye and remained hospitalized. Her two
male colleagues were treated for cuts and released.
   Guests and staff of the Mourne Country Hotel in Newry were
evacuated at 2:30 a.m. after three warning calls to a Newry
hospital and the Samaritans charity organization, police said.
   A car bomb exploded outside minutes later, causing extensive
damage to the hotel's kitchen area but no casualties.
   ``There was only a few guests. We were lucky in that,'' said an
employee, who spoke with the condition he not be identified.
   An IRA message to a Belfast radio station called the hotel near
the border with the Irish republic ``a meeting place for members of
the security forces and informers'' and claimed responsibility for
that bombing and the one in Lisnaskea.
   In Knighton, Wales, more than 1,000 mourners attended the
funeral of Warrant Officer 1st Class Richard Michael Heakin, 38,
who was killed by IRA gunmen Aug. 12 in the Belgian port of Ostend
as he stopped his car for a traffic light.
   He was stationed in West Germany but his license plate
identified him as a British soldier.
   At the parish church of St. Edward, his cousin, the Rev. Leo
Heakin, prayed that ``the forces of evil and terrorism will never
ever have the last word in our world and that peace and justice
will prevail.''
   In Belfast, thousands of people lined the streets to observe a
funeral procession for Frederick Otley, 44, a grocer shot to death
by masked gunmen Wednesday in his shop in the Protestant Shankill
Road area of west Belfast.
   The Irish Revolutionary Brigade, a previously unknown group,
claimed responsibility Wednesday. On Friday, the Irish National
Liberation Army asserted responsibility and claimed Otley belonged
to the Ulster Volunteer Force, a Protestant paramilitary
organization.
   Otley stood trial in 1985 on charges of membership in the Ulster
Volunteer Force and bombing a Catholic social club, but was
released when a government informer withdrew his evidence.

<HEAD>Bush and Quayle Commence Campaign</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MERRILL HARTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HUNTINGTON, Ind. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Newly crowned presidential nominee
George Bush kicked off his general election campaign in the heart
of middle America, but the star-spangled kickoff rally was marred
by running mate Dan Quayle's continuing defense of his military
record.
   Bush and Quayle came to the senator's hometown to launch their
campaign, and a crowd of some 8,000 to 10,000 flag-waving and
cheering townspeople greeted them. But not long after the pair
delivered standard campaign-style speeches, Quayle was off to the
side of the Huntington County Courthouse lawn, answering reporters'
questions.
   Quayle, in a give-and-take session that had been set up by the
Bush organization and piped to the crowd by loudspeaker system,
combatively defended his 1969 decision to join the National Guard
during the height of the Vietnam War.
   Commenting on persistent reports that he used family connections
to win a spot on a National Guard unit roster, Quayle said, ``I can
assure you that I asked no one to break any rules, and that I broke
no rules at all.''
   ``I was on active duty for six months,'' he said. ``I could have
been called to Vietnam, as many Indiana units were, and if I had
been called, I would have gone.''
   Members of the crowd, witnessing an extraordinary confrontation
between a high-profile public figure and reporters, booed lustily
when Quayle was asked repeatedly about his motives for joining the
Guard.
   During his speech to the crowd here, Bush said he thought he
would beat historical odds against vice presidents seeking the
presidency.
   He said that at the end of Thursday night's acceptance speech,
``I just couldn't help but think that old Martin Van Buren was up
there giving me the high-five sign,'' he said. Van Buren was the
last vice president to win the top job, and that was over 150 years
ago.
   Bush and Quayle appeared together in New Orleans earlier Friday
at a meeting of the Republican National Committee.
   The newly minted ticket got well wishes from party figures
before flying to Quayle's home state of Indiana.
   Quayle continued to poke fun at the uproar surrounding reports
of his National Guard involvement during his appearance before the
RNC.
   ``Marilyn (Quayle's wife) and I are just getting used to how we
are supposed to conduct ourselves on the campaign trail,'' he said.
   The 41-year old senator strode to the podium following Bush's
speech and said, ``I think I now know how to introduce myself.''
   He came to attention, snapped his heels together and said:
   ``Name: Dan Quayle.''
   ``Rank: sergeant.''
   ``Serial number: 303 50 4096.''
   ``Status: In the National Guard six years and proud of it.''
   Bush and Quayle were in high spirits the morning after the
conclusion of the Republican National Convention, and both seemed
eager to proceed with what Bush called ``the countdown phase.''
   The pair scheduled campaign trips over the next two days to
Dayton, Cleveland and Columbus, Ohio, and to the Illinois State
Fair in Springfield.
   In a brief talk to the Republican Party leaders before leaving
New Orleans, Bush said the convention amounted to another
``shifting of gears'' in the campaign, and said that now ``we're
coming to the beginning of the end. I'm convinced we're going to
win.''
   Bush said he thought the convention had helped him get his
message to the American people and ``beyond the filters'' that
obscure his points. He evidently was referring to fact that his
speech was broadcast live.
   He said his basic campaign message will be constituted in part
by emphasis on maintaining world peace and security and the other
half will focus on ``enlarging the prosperity so that everyone
benefits.''
   ``We have a good message, it's an upbeat message,'' he said.
Saying most elections hinge on the pocketbook issues, Bush said the
coming campaign gauge ``the innate optimism aand pessimism of the
American people.''
   Bush said that ``we have not yet captivated'' the kinds of
public opinion poll numbers that would be reflected by a belief by
people that they're better off than they were eight years ago.
   Bush saluted Quayle as ``that young spirit'' who relates to the
``changing decade we're moving into.''

   Jon Bon Jovi says a rock group can ``lose
touch,'' so he thinks it's great that youths who usually buy Bon
Jovi albums decided which songs would go on the band's latest album.
   ``We brought 50 kids into the studio and we played them
everything,'' Bon Jovi said after the quintet from New Jersey
recorded the LP in Vancouver. ``It was surprisingly helpful because
a couple of the songs wouldn't have made it.
   ``We had another friend of ours in New York give it to his kids
and they took it to kids camp. `Born To Be My Baby' and `Bad
Medicine,' which is the first single, kept coming back (as
favorites). We write it, so we don't know anymore.''
   The group held a news conference Friday at Roseland Ballroom to
announce its upcoming tour, which will start Halloween night in
Dublin, Ireland. The U.S. tour will come later, starting in Hawaii.

   The security firm of Watergate figure G. Gordon
Liddy is going public in a merger that will enable the company to
pay off back taxes and expand its operations in Latin America.
   G. Gordon Liddy and Associates has signed a letter of intent to
merge in a $300,000 deal with Castleton Investors Corp., a Fort
Lauderdale-based investment firm, both companies said Thursday.
Stock will be sold under the Liddy name.
   Liddy's Miami-based security firm grabbed national headlines
after Liddy set up a commando camp in 1986 to train students in
explosives, hand-to-hand combat and hostage negotiations. A trained
group of mercenaries Liddy calls the ``Hurricane Force'' can also
be hired out for hostage-rescue missions.
   Liddy spent five years in prison in connection with the
Watergate break-in, which he supervised.

   The award will be given to the younger Walesa during the 40th
national convention of the American Council of Polish Cultural

   Walesa wore a Pepsi T-shirt, sneakers and jeans and carried a

difference between the United States and Poland, he responded
through an interpreter, ``The stores ... there is so much of

   New York Knicks star Mark Jackson teamed up with
Mayor Edward I. Koch to tell 200 inner city youngsters to take
advantage of sports and education and avoid dope.
   The National Basketball Association rookie of the year played
several games of three-on-one Friday with the 7- to 15-year-olds at
a basketball camp in Queens and showed them some of his dribbling,
passing and shooting tricks.
   The visit was part of a national program to present role models
to youngsters to fight drug use.
   The Queens native, who starred at nearby St. John's University,
told the youngsters that he had taken advantage of opportunities as
a youth and urged them to maintain clean minds and bodies.
   Koch discussed the drug problem and asked if any of the kids
knew anyone who used drugs. Many said they did. He also discussed
the links between AIDS and drugs.

   If at first you don't succeed in
America, try the Soviet Union. That's what singer John Denver did.
   After unsuccessfully seeking to be a passenger on the U.S. space
shuttle, he has asked the Soviet Union for a ride aboard its Mir
space station, an industry magazine reported Friday.
   Aviation Week & Space Technology said Denver had requested
transportation to Mir aboard one of the Soyuz spaceships that
regularly carry crews to and from the orbiting station.
   ``The Soviets responded with two conditions,'' the magazine
said. ``They told Denver they would charge him $10 million for the
ride and that he had to get permission from the U.S. government.
   ``The State Department took its customary cautious approach,
advising Denver it was taking `no position' on the matter _
effectively putting it back into the hands of the Soviets.''
   The magazine quoted an unidentified American official as saying,
``We very carefully did not endorse his going, but at the same time
we can't prevent U.S. citizens from going to exotic places.''
   Denver has been a guest of NASA at several space shuttle
launches and has asked several times over the years for a shuttle
ride, saying he wanted to compose in orbit a song about space.

   Actress Elizabeth Taylor plans physical
therapy and rest at home to ease her back problems before embarking
on a promotional tour for her fragrance line, a publicist says.
   Miss Taylor was released from the hospital Thursday after more
than three weeks of strict bed rest and physical therapy for the
back condition, hospital spokeswoman Mary Miller said.
   Miss Taylor was admitted July 25 to St. John's Hospital in Santa
Monica for a compression fracture of the first lumbar vertebra that
produced lower back muscle spasms. She hurt herself last month when
she fell on the set of the film ``Young Toscannini,'' said her
publicist, Chen Sam.
   Miss Taylor has suffered back problems since she fell off a
horse and fractured her spine 30 years ago, Ms. Sam said.

   A young woman, a 15-year-old boy and a police officer died
during the 54-hour ordeal that began with a bank robbery, escalated
into a bus hijacking and ended with a bloody gunfight on a highway
near Bonn.
   Criticism of the state government's handling of the case
heightened considerably on Friday, one day after two men and a
woman were arrested.
   Michael Butz, spokesman for the federal Interior Ministry, told
reporters the country's elite GSG-9 anti-terrorist force was
offered to North Rhine-Westphalia state officials to help end the
crisis.
   Instead, North Rhine-Westphalia officials dispatched a police
commando unit. The commandos rammed the getaway car, and a gun
battle ensued that resulted in the death of one of two hostages.
   Asked if the federal government regrets that the GSG-9 was not
used, Butz replied only: ``The legal situation in which the states
have responsibility for police deployments must be respected.''
   The GSG-9 rescued 86 passengers held by terrorists on a
Lufthansa airliner on Oct. 13, 1977 at Mogadishu, the capital of
Somalia.
   Some politicians criticized North Rhine-Westphalia officials for
not making use of the GSG-9, which stands for
Grenzschutzgruppe-Unit 9, or Federal Border Guard Troops-Unit 9.
   State officials defended their actions during the ordeal, which
began Tuesday when two men robbed a bank in the northwestern town
of Gladbeck. Authorities gave them a getaway car, and they fled
with two hostages.
   The gunmen surfaced Wednesday in Bremen, 125 miles to the
northeast, where they seized a bus with about 30 people aboard.
   Most of the ordeal occurred in Bremen and in North
Rhine-Westphalia state, but the gunmen also drove the bus across
the border into the Netherlands, then returned to West Germany in a
car provided by Dutch authorities.
   A federal official, Education Minister Juergen Moellemann, said
North Rhine- Westphalia Interior Minister Herbert Schnoor and Bernd
Meyer, interior minister for the city of Bremen, should resign.
   ``It is totally unconceivable why actions were not taken sooner
(to stop the bandits),'' Moellemann was quoted as saying in the
mass-circulation Bild newspaper.
   Schnoor said he takes ``political responsibility'' for North
Rhine-Westphalia law officials' handling of the crisis, but he
rejected allegations they bungled the job.
   Meanwhile, officials said they are certain that hostage Silke
Bischof, 18, was killed by one of the bank robbers and not by
police during Thursday's shootout.
   Police identified the gunmen as Dieter Degowski, 32, and
Hans-Juergen Roesner, 31, and their alleged female accomplice as
Marion Irma Loeblich, 34.
   A second hostage in the getaway car, identified by the ZDF as
18-year-old Ines Voitelle, was grazed by a bullet on the back while
gunman Roesner was shot in the thigh during the police shootout.
   An Italian teen-ager, Emanuele de Giorgi, was shot to death
Wednesday night after the busload of hostages stopped at a highway
rest area near Bremen.
   The Frankfurt newspaper Abendpost on Friday said the 15-year-old
was killed by the gunmen while trying to protect his little sister
from them.
   A police officer also died in a car crash while pursuing the
bandits toward the Netherlands.
   All the hostages but Ms. Bischof and Ms. Voitelle either escaped
or were freed after the bus arrived in the Netherlands.

   Iraqis crowded into stores and waved flags
Saturday on the first day of a cease-fire in the 8-year-old war
with Iran, but the government said Iran violated the truce by
killing an Iraqi soldier.
   U.N. observers reported no violations on the front.
   Iraq also said that in the Strait of Hormuz, an Iranian
helicopter gunship and a ``war vessel'' shadowed an Iraqi merchant
ship, one of three sent into the gulf waters to test the truce.
   The official Iraqi News Agency said an Iranian soldier
infiltrated an Iraqi ground position and shot a private. It did not
say whether the Iranian soldier was captured.
   ``Iraq did not retaliate for the Iranian violation,'' the Iraqi
agency said. It was not clear exactly where the incident occurred,
and Iran and the United Nations had no immediate comment.

   Iranians are still waiting for their
revolutionary leaders to explain their stunning about-face in
accepting the U.N. cease-fire that took effect Saturday in the
eight-year war with Iraq.
   Leaders are warning the people that peace may not bring about
the economic boom some expect. Some Iranians are bracing for a
resurgence of morals enforcement by the Islamic fundamentalist
government.
   Iran accepted the cease-fire on July 18 after a series of
defeats. Iraq accepted it shortly after it was passed in July 1987,
but the war raged on, leaving an estimated 1.5 million dead or
wounded since September 1980.

   Hundreds of thousands of mourners
jammed the grounds of the world's largest mosque Saturday and
chanted praise as President Mohammed Zia ul-Haq was buried.
   Acting President Ghulam Ishaq Khan said he asked the United
States to help investigate the ``dastardly crime'' of the crash
Wednesday that killed Zia, the U.S. ambassador and 28 other people
aboard a military C-130 plane.
   ``We do suspect that a C-130 is such a stable plane that it
doesn't disintegrate into thin air,'' Ishaq Khan told reporters at
his first news conference since taking office as president.
   ``The enemy has penetrated the inner defenses of the country,''
he said. But he added that he had no proof that sabotage was to
blame and that it would be ``pure speculation'' to cast suspicion
on any group.

   The death of President Mohammed Zia
ul-Haq offers a unique chance for this Moslem country near the
Soviet bloc to create a broad-based democracy.
   Western diplomats and Pakistani political observers, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said it was too early to say precisely how
the army general's death would affect the turbulent political scene
in the nation of 107 million.
   Pakistani politicians disagree with foreign observers who say
the country was left without a leader. Zia and his military chiefs
died Wednesday when their C-130 transport plane exploded and
crashed in eastern Pakistan.

   A federal jury assessed the flamboyant Hunt
brothers more than $130 million in damages Saturday after finding
that they had conspired to corner the world silver market in the
late 1970s.
   The jury said the three Hunt brothers and two other defendants
had ruined the investments of the Peruvian government's mineral
marketing company, Minpeco S.A., by sending the price of silver to
artificial heights.
   All of the Hunts but one _ Lamar, 56, owner of the National
Football League's Kansas City Chiefs _ also were found to have
engaged in a pattern of racketeering activity to monopolize the
silver market. Since the case is a civil one, there would be no
criminal penalties attached to the finding.
   The verdict was a victory for Minpeco, which lost millions in
the volatile silver market, and a setback for the three sons of the
late Texas oilman H.L. Hunt.
   The jury found that International Metals Investment Co. and
Mahmoud Fustok had participated in the conspiracy with the three
Hunt brothers.

   With polls suggesting a tightening race,
George Bush is embarking on a ``pit bull'' campaign strategy
attacking his Democratic rival. Michael Dukakis seeks to grab the
offensive by casting the race in terms of judgment, leadership and
competence.
   Leaving New Orleans as the Republican presidential nominee, Bush
is pursuing an acknowledged high-risk strategy aimed at trying to
dust up Dukakis' more favorable image among the electorate, as
reflected by polls.
   While the latest polls suggest Bush had pulled even with Dukakis
by the time the Republican National Convention ended, his selection
of Sen. Dan Quayle of Indiana as a running mate clouded the
euphoria.

   With Michael Dukakis scheduled to receive the
AFL-CIO's endorsement this week, unions are preparing a nationwide
blitz of Labor Day events aimed at energizing their members to work
on his behalf.
   They are determined to do a better job of delivering for the
Democratic presidential candidate this year than they did four
years ago for Walter Mondale.
   A ``Jobs With Justice'' coalition of 20 unions formed a year ago
to foster community rank-and-file ties and raise the visibility of
labor causes is being converted into a recruitment office for
campaign volunteers.

   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen's grandfather didn't
have enough money for a ticket when he emigrated to America 100
years ago, so he stowed away on a cargo ship, his Danish relatives
say.
   Today, Bentsen is a wealthy U.S. senator from Texas and the
Democratic candidate for vice president of the United States.
   Bentsen still has relatives, Dagmar and Theodor Jensen, in the
village of Birkelse, where the Bentsen family originated, 32 miles
west of Aalborg in northern Jutland. Both are 87.

   The Soviet Union is defending the invasion it led
into Czechoslovakia 20 years ago to crush the ``Prague Spring''
reforms.
   But dissident Andrei Sakharov and other Soviet activists contend
the Czech reform effort was ``the first perestroika,'' referring to
Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's campaign for restructuring and
greater openness.
   They worry that official Soviet refusal to re-evaluate the
invasion reflects a limited commitment to reform.
   ``How can (the invasion) be defended?'' Sakharov, 67, the most
prominent Soviet dissident, said in a recent interview. ``The
invasion was a shame on our country and all who sanctioned that
action.''

   Congress is pressuring New York City to stop
dumping its millions of tons of sewage sludge in the Atlantic, but
the city says there's no way it can meet the deadlines and that
fines won't do anyone any good.
   Congress is wrangling over a deadline for ending ocean
sludge-dumping and is prepared to assess heavy fines to make it
stick. The Senate unanimously passed legislation Aug. 9 outlawing
the dumping by January 1992, and a similar House bill would end it
a year later.
   The Senate bill also would require the city to sign a compliance
agreement within six months, but ``you can't sign an agreement that
you can't comply with,'' said Judy Chesser, director of New York
City's Washington office.

   What, if anything, has Cesar Chavez's
36-day fast achieved?
   Reviews are mixed on the fast, which is due to end Sunday at a
large outdoor Mass. Chavez began the fast to protest use of five
pesticides on table grapes and to advance his 4-year-old boycott of
the grapes.
   The United Farm Workers union claims that grocers have removed
table grapes from shelves in several small California towns and
cooperative markets in New York City, Detroit, Boston and Albany,
N.Y., since the fast began. But the union has not released a list
of specific stores for fear that growers will seek retribution
against those grocers, said UFW board member Arturo Rodriguez.

   Residents have been counting calories
and comparing waistlines for three months, shedding thousands of
pounds and hundreds of inches in an experiment aimed at improving
the health of rural Americans.
   ``My neighbor lost 32 pounds and I've lost 14,'' said Odessa
Mace, 62, one of 1,000 participants in the two-year, $4 million
study. ``I don't eat red meat anymore and I watch my butter. No
more salt or bacon either.''
   Mace and others in the study had their blood pressure, pulse,
cholesterol and weight checked last week in their first health exam
since the experiment began in May. Participants will receive a more
extensive physical and blood tests in November.
