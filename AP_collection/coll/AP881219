<HEAD>Government Plans Talks on Possible Electoral Reforms</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Carlos Salinas de Gortari on Monday
announced plans for talks on possible reforms to Mexico's electoral
laws, a key demand of opposition politicians from both right and
left.
   A statement from the president's office said the Federal Election
Commission will begin ``a great public consultation'' next month and
the Chamber of Deputies will discuss electoral reform at a special
June session.
   The opposition says election laws are designed and administered
to ensure continued rule by the Institutional Revolutionary Party,
which has held power since 1929.
   Manuel J. Clouthier, who ran for president as nominee of the
right-of-center National Action Party, has been on a public fast
since Thursday to dramatize his party's demand for electoral reform.
   Party president Luis Alvarez said Salinas' proposals do not go
far enough for Clouthier to stop his hunger strike.
   He complained that ``they still haven't set up a special
commission in the Chamber of Deputies to begin changing election
laws right now.''
   Salinas' announcement came after he met with representatives of
the leftist Authentic Party of the Mexican Revolution, which backed
runner-up Cuauhtemoc Cardenas in disputed July 6 elections.
Clouthier came third.
   It was Salinas' second meeting with an opposition party since he
took office Dec. 1. The day after his inauguration, he met National
Action Party officials.

   Prime Minister Ranasinghe Premadasa
maintained his lead Tuesday in presidential elections marred by
attacks from Sinhalese extremists who killed at least 15 people,
officials said.
   Although the violence did not stop Monday's balloting in this
ethnically divided island nation, it kept droves of eligible voters
away.
   Turnout in reporting districts was below 50 percent of eligible
voters.
   With 104 of 182 polling districts counted, Premadasa of the
ruling United National Party had 1,155,594 votes, or 51 percent,
according to state television.
   His main rival, former Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike of
the opposition Sri Lanka Freedom Party had 1,001,572, or 44 percent.
   Ossie Abeygoonesekera, head of a coalition of four small leftist
parties, polled 99,129, or 4 percent. About 9.3 million people were
eligible to vote.
   Turnout in the reporting districts was about 47 percent of
eligible voters. Deputy Elections Commissioner Lakshman Perera
compared it with 80 percent nationwide in the last presidential
election six years ago. Sir Lanka has 9.3 million registered voters.
   In the north, where militants of the Tamil minority are fighting
for an independent state, many districts reported less than 10
percent turnout.
   And in the south, where Sinhalese extremists of the People's
Liberation Front oppose government concessions to the Tamils,
turnout ranged from 20-70 percent.
   All three candidates pledged to end ethnic strife that has
brought this former tourist paradise off the southern tip of India
to the brink of ruin.
   At least 8,500 people have been killed since separatists from the
Tamil minority began a civil war in 1983.
   ``This is a battle between the ballot and the bullet. The bullet
must not win,'' Premadasa said after voting in the capital, Colombo.
   Attacks by Sinhalese militants began after an agreement 18 months
ago that promised Tamils regional autonomy in the north and east and
introduced Indian troops to help disarm the rebels.
   Perera blamed violence and the People's Liberation Front threats
to kill voters for the low turnout. The front is made up of
Sinhalese extremists who oppose terms outgoing President Junius R.
Jayewardene offered for settlement of the Tamil war. They have vowed
to kill anyone who supported the government.
   All the presidential candidates are Sinhalese, a predominantly
Buddhist group that makes up 75 percent of the Sri Lanka's 16
million people and runs the government, judiciary and military.
Tamils, who are overwhelmingly Hindu and total 18 percent of the
population, claim discrimination by the Sinhalese.
   Hundreds of people have been killed in the violence blamed on
Sinhalese extremists.
   On Monday, police and military officials reported bomb and gun
attacks on five voting stations in the Sinhalese heartland near the
capital in southern Sri Lanka.
   Nine voters, a soldier and a policeman were killed and 25 people
were wounded, the officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   A police sergeant, an election official and a driver were killed
in ambushes of two jeeps carrying ballot boxes after polls closed in
the southern Moneragala district, the military said.
   Police in Ambalanagoda, 50 miles south of Colombo, reported an
officer killed.
   Military forces and police guarded polling places, particularly
in the south where the Sinhalese gunmen operate.
   Navy personnel with automatic rifles joined police on guard duty
at Kaluthra, 20 miles south of the capital. Soldiers were deployed
at such crowded public places as the town's main bus station.
   Premadasa campaigned as a champion of the poor and promised
monthly allowances equivalent to $75 for the poorest families but
did not explain how he would pay for it.
   He and Mrs. Bandaranaike, who was prime minister in 1960-66 and
1970-77, oppose the agreement with India under which 47,000 Indian
troops are in Sri Lanka, former known as Ceylon.
   Abeygoonasekera blamed both major parties for Sri Lanka's
economic and ethnic problems.

<HEAD>Value of Japan's Land and Structures Tops GNP For First Time</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Spiraling real estate prices last year have boosted
Japan's actual assets past its gross national product for the first
time, the government said today.
   The value of Japan's actual assets _ its land and structures _
rose 20.2 percent to $3.04 trillion last year, while its GNP was
$2.87 trillion, said Economic Planning Agency chief Eiichi Nakao.
   Last year's soaring prices made land assets in Japan, a country
roughly the size of California, worth 4.1 times as much as all the
land in the United States, Kyodo News Service said. In 1986,
Japanese land value was calculated at 2.5 times that of the United
States.
   Financial assets such as equity and deposits also rose, to $23.2
billion _ a 15.6 percent increase over 1986, the agency said.
   ``Rapid rise in land prices and booming stock trading'' fueled
the explosion of assets, agency officials said.
   Urban land prices have stabilized somewhat in recent months
following a series of measures by the central and local governments
to control the spiral, but prices continue to rise in fast-growing
suburbs.

   A quickly arranged concert by world-famous
musicians last week raised more than $660,000 to help victims of the
devastating earthquake in Soviet Armenia, organizers say.
   Cellist Mstislav Rostropovich, flutist James Galway, and
conductor Andre Previn joined the English Chamber Orchestra and
several other musicians for Saturday's concert at London's Barbican.
   The funds, to benefit the British Red Cross Armenian earthquake
appeal, came from video and record rights as well as ticket sales at
the soldout performance in the 2,026-seat hall, according to the
Armenia Appeal Committee.
   The concert was broadcast live by the British Broadcasting Corp.,
and the Soviet Union and five other nations televised it.
   The Dec. 7 earthquake killed an estimated 55,000 people and left
500,000 homeless.

<TEXT>
   A winter storm that locked much of Italy in an icy
grip of snow and frigid temperatures has left at least six people
dead and five others missing and presumed drowned, news reports said.
   About 30 small mountain villages in central and southern Italy
and 10 on the island of Sicily were still isolated Sunday by snow,
up to two six-feet deep in some places. The snow blocked blocked
roads and passes.
   Four of the missing were aboard the oceanography research vessel
Posillipo-Loran, missing and presumed sunk in the storm-tossed sea
off Naples. Waves as high as 21 feet hampered the search for the
crew.
   The body of a fisherman whose boat apparently was swamped during
the storm washed up on a beach near Rome early Sunday. Authorities
were still looking for the other man aboard the boat, who was
presumed drowned.
   Italian news reports said five other deaths from traffic
accidents and heart failure had been attributed to the snow and cold.
   The thermometer dipped as low as six degrees below zero in the
Dolomites in far northern Italy and to freezing as far south as
Sicily. None of the snow fell on Rome, but the city was gripped by
freezing temperatures.
   In Vatican City, Pope John Paul II on Sunday blessed nativity
dolls during a traditional ceremony at St. Peter's Square, where two
fountains that normally shoot streams of water were locked in ice.

<HEAD>Few New Yorkers Participate In AIDS Study</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal study to determine whether a drug can
fight the onset of AIDS in people who carry the AIDS virus may be
delayed because of a failure to attract enough volunteers in New
York City, according to a published report.
   Six New York medical centers participating in the study have
attracted only 257 volunteers, The New York Times reported Sunday.
Recruitment may be suffering because carriers of the AIDS virus do
not want to risk being among the volunteers given a placebo and not
the drug, it said.
   The study was designed to see whether AZT, or azidothymidine, can
prevent or delay the onset of AIDS in people who carry the virus but
have not developed symptoms of the disease. The antiviral agent has
already been shown to prolong the lives of seriously ill AIDS
patients.
   Some volunteers in the study are given AZT while others are given
a placebo.
   Clinics in other cities participating in the study have not
experienced serious recruitment difficulties. The University of
Minnesota had 166 patients enrolled in the study, while Cornell
Medical Center in New York City had just nine volunteers after five
months of recruitment through newspaper advertisements, doctors who
have large AIDS practices and gay organizations.
   The recruitment problems in New York, which has more AIDS
patients than any other city, could slow down the entire study, the
Times said.
   Some New York City study participants also may be cheating by
taking steps to find out if they are getting AZT or the placebo, and
then dropping out of the study or getting AZT from other doctors,
the newspaper reported. Some volunteers in the study also are said
to be taking anti-AIDS drugs that have not been approved for use, it
said.
   Act Up, an AIDS organization, has charged that other tests for
experimental drugs at three city medical schools have excluded the
poor, minorities and women by drawing their volunteers from private
hospitals, where most AIDS patients are white, middle-class men,
rather than from municipal hospitals, the Times said.

   Chinese have died in fires at a rate of seven per
day over the past decade, an official newspaper reported today.
   The China Daily said 410,000 fires killed or injured 60,000
people and caused $784 million in damage over the past 10 years.
   The report did not give a figure for deaths, but at seven
fatalities a day the total would be about 25,000.
   The daily, quoting the Ministry of Public Security's fire control
department, said the majority of fires are caused by human error,
negligence and failure to carry out fire safety measures.
   One-third of fires are a result of faulty electrical wiring in
buildings, it said, and senior officials of enterprises hit by fires
are rarely punished.
   The daily also quoted Beijing fire officials as saying their
communications and fire-fighting equipment are outdated.

   The spirit of polygamist John Singer,
gunned down by lawmen nearly a decade ago, is a constant presence at
the murder trial of three young men who took up arms for his cause.
   It lives in his son, John Timothy Singer, who has spoken with
anguish of his father's death, and in the testimony of Addam Swapp,
husband of two of Singer's daughters and his father-in-law's
spiritual heir.
   And it is felt in the German immigrant's handmade buckskin coat,
worn by Addam's brother Jonathan, and in the volumes of Mormon
scripture the three defendants have brought each day to a courtroom
where closing arguments were scheduled today and the jury, after
nine days of testimony, was expected to begin deliberating.
   Singer and the Swapp brothers are charged with murdering a state
officer during a gunfight that ended the clan's 13-day standoff with
police at their Marion homestead last winter.
   The confrontation began after Singer and the Swapp brothers
bombed a nearby Mormon chapel on Jan. 16, the ninth anniversary of
the elder Singer's death, and retreated to the family compound.
   Clan leader Addam Swapp, 27, said the bombing was prompted by a
divine revelation.
   ``It has to do with the injustices perpetrated against our
family,'' he testified. ``John Singer was shot in the back, and
nobody cared.
   ``The truth has been trampled on more than once, and we took a
stand,'' Swapp said. ``We knew we had to do it. We knew we had to
take one day at a time and trust in our God.''
   Corrections Lt. Fred House, who had joined an FBI team in an
attempt to arrest the Swapps on Jan. 28, was ordering a reluctant
police dog to subdue the pair when he was shot in a volley of rifle
fire from the wheelchair-bound Singer.
   Singer, 22, admitted firing the fatal shot but contended he was
aiming at the dogs.
   Swapp, an excommunicated Mormon, married Heidi Singer in 1980 and
her sister Charlotte a few years later. The father of seven, he has
said he believed the bombing would trigger John Singer's
resurrection and the collapse of a ``wicked and corrupt'' church and
state.
   Singer's widow, Vickie, says her husband's death was the result
of a conspiracy between state authorities and church officials angry
at his open practice of polygamy and refusal to send his children to
public schools. The Mormon church officially abandoned polygamy in
1890.
   The Singers, also excommunicated Mormons, taught their children
at home to shield them from a system they believed was tainted by
sexual promiscuity, drug abuse and racial mixing.
   Finally, fearing the state would place his children in foster
homes, Singer, 48, holed up in the compound for 18 days before being
shot by officers in 1979. Police said he pointed a gun at officers
trying to arrest him.
   In an interview taped by federal agents and played for the jury,
John Timothy Singer said that his father was shot as he walked to a
mailbox.
   ``All these men zoomed in on him on snowmobiles, 10 men, what
I've heard,'' he said. ``And he pulled out his gun and he, you know,
(said) `Back off, I don't want any trouble now.' And he turned
around to run home, my sister saw this through binoculars, and as he
turned around to run home they shot him two to three times in the
back.''
   The younger Singer, a thin, quiet man left a paraplegic by a
logging accident four years ago, told of his mother's wrongful death
lawsuit, which was dismissed by a federal judge for insufficient
evidence.
   ``I mean, we couldn't get justice,'' he said. ``I mean, my dad's
been killed and shot, and it wouldn't even be tried.''
   If convicted, Singer and the Swapp brothers face five years to
life in prison.
   Addam Swapp already has been sentenced to 15 years in prison on
federal charges related to the bombing and standoff. Singer and
Jonathan Swapp were given 10-year sentences in the case, while
Vickie Singer was sentenced to five years.

   The columns of tanks are gone from
city streets, and hundreds of soldiers who staged an abortive
rebellion earlier this month have returned to the barracks.
   But Argentina's military remains restive, and no one is
predicting that the third insurrection in 20 months against the
civilian government of President Raul Alfonsin will be the last.
   ``The military crisis was resolved, not the military question,''
says Antonio Berhongaray, chairman of the Senate Defense Committee.
``There could be another insurrection.''
   Government officials have worked since the four-day revolt ended
Dec. 4 to assess the loyalty of army units _ some of which openly
sided with the rebels, and others which refused to confront them _
and to meet some of the rebel demands.
   A general who publicly sympathized with rebel commander Col.
Mohamed Ali Seineldin was retired, and the government hastily put
together funds to give soldiers a 20 percent pay increase and a
Christmas bonus.
   That may reduce tensions in the ranks, but it doesn't address the
root of the problem, say some prominent Argentines. Many in the
military want an end to human rights trials of officers for their
roles in a campaign of repression during the 1976-83 military
dictatorship.
   They want a better role in society for the military, which lost
the 1982 Falklands War and led Argentina into economic chaos during
its rule.
   But Argentina's military has toppled six civilian leaders since
1930, and some say it has never learned its place in society.
   ``The point is, the central point is, the military does not
respond to civilian political power,'' says Adolfo Perez Esquivel,
director of the human rights group Peace and Justice Service and
winner of the 1980 Nobel Peace Prize.
   In an interview at his sparsely furnished office, Perez Esquivel
referred to one of the last incidents of the rebellion and said,
``Right in front of `loyal' troops, `rebels' fired tear gas and shot
at civilians.''
   ``There aren't `loyal' troops. They're all accomplices of the
rebels,'' he said, his voice devoid of stridency or anger. ``They
share the same ideology. They only differ in method. Some were
against the insurrection, some wanted to work through the political
system.''
   On Dec. 12, the commander of the 5th army corps, Gen. Humberto
Ferrucci, confirmed the suspicions of many when he said the
insurrection ended with an agreement between army chief Lt. Gen.
Jose Dante Caridi and Seineldin.
   There is widespread doubt that loyal troops ``suffocated'' the
rebellion, as Alfonsin ordered them to do, but instead reached an
agreement with the rebels, the terms of which have yet to be
disclosed.
   That prospect unsettles, among others, Elias Robert Salazar,
president of the 8,000-member Buenos Aires Lawyers Association.
   Asked if the end of the rebellion meant democracy in Argentina
was strengthened, or the institution of the presidency was
fortified, Salazar shook his head from side to side and said:
   ``I think the situation of civilian political power is worse
because the armed forces demonstrated that they are loyal to
themselves and not to the president and commander-in-chief
(Alfonsin).
   ``The conclusion I draw is that the military doesn't want power
right now because the situation is not favorable. They would be
repudiated by the people and economically, they would be taking over
a situation that would not allow them to govern. ... They don't want
power, but they want to give the orders.''
   Their demand for a recuperation of military honor and dignity,
which had widespread resonance through the ranks, was a
reaffirmation of the military view that the battle to curtail the
kidnappings, bombings and assassinations of the 1970s was a civil
war.
   A speech Saturday by Defense Minister Horacio Jaunarena supported
that view. Jaunarena said the campaign, through brutal, was
necessary.
   The view of human rights groups and others is that the arrest,
``disappearance'' and presumed execution of 9,000 Argentines was a
brutal repression of society.
   Alfonsin has portrayed the end of the rebellion as a clear-cut
victory in which organized labor, big business, foreign governments
and tens of thousands of Argentines who gathered in plazas to
protest the insurrection forced the rebels to give in.
   But the opposition Peronist Party, with an eye to May 1989
national elections, is criticizing Alfonsin for his handling of the
revolt, and demanding he develop a policy toward the military that
reduces the risk of another revolt.
   Asked what effect the insurrection might have in the election,
pollster Manuel Mora y Araujo said, ``We're asking ourselves that,
but so far we don't know ... It hasn't ended.''

   Seventeen-year-old Arnel Galang still
wakes up screaming, haunted by the faces of the 23 relatives he lost
a year ago when the ferry Dona Paz sank with more than 3,000 people
aboard.
   Arnel, then a high school senior, was one of only 26 passengers
and crew who survived after the 2,215-ton Dona Paz collided with the
629-ton oil tanker Vector and exploded off Mindoro island the night
of Dec. 20, 1987.
   A presidential commission said at least 3,563 people were aboard
the two ships, but the precise figure may never be known. Only 108
bodies were recovered after the disaster, which the coast guard
blamed on the Vector.
   For Arnel, the year has been one of bitterness and pain. He feels
abandoned by a government that he says has done little to help him.
   Family members blame Arnel for not saving his relatives,
including cousins, aunts and an infant niece, who perished on the
Dona Paz.
   ``Everything that happened is still clear to me,'' he said, his
hands trembling. ``Sometimes, I can't sleep. Sometimes, I get
nightmares. I shout and cry, then I stay awake all night. In my
dreams, they tell me they have not died, only wandered off to an
unknown place. But I have to face reality. I just pray for them.''
   Arnel and his relatives boarded the Dona Paz to go to Manila to
visit his sister, Rose, whom he hadn't seen since childhood. It was
his first time on a ship.
   Suddenly, about 10 p.m., he felt a strong thud.
   He ran for a wall and squeezed himself through a porthole.
   ``I struggled free and fell into the water,'' he recalled. ``I
couldn't hear anything anymore. There was just silence. The sea was
on fire. My face was scalded. The water was very hot as if it were
boiling water. I swam so fast. I don't know how I did it.''
   Arnel and the other survivors were rescued by a passing ship and
brought to Manila. There, he saw Rose. Burned and bandaged, he raced
to embrace her.
   But the joy of reunion soon gave way to resentment. Relatives
blamed him for not saving other family members.
   ``They ask me `Arnel, Why did you not save your cousins?''' he
said, fighting back tears. ``I tell them,`There was nothing I could
do.' It was difficult enough saving myself. Maybe if I tried to save
them, we would all have died.''
   Since the disaster, Arnel said he has shunned other relatives,
including his parents, who live in Manila.
   Arnel is also bitter at the government, which he says abandoned
him. He received 5,000 pesos, or $250, which President Corazon
Aquino allocated for each survivor. But he said there has been no
psychological counseling or rehabilitation for the survivors.
   Mrs. Aquino recommended Arnel for a job in a pharmacy but the
company refused to hire him. His family is too poor to afford fees
to complete his final year of high school. He works as an unpaid
volunteer for an association of relatives of Dona Paz victims and
survives on charity.
   Arnel said he and some relatives of victims have refused to
accept a $1,500 lump sum payment from the shipowners, Sulpicio
Shipping Lines, because the company insists they sign a waiver
promising no further claims.
   In April, a group of survivors and relatives filed a class action
suit seeking more compensation. The case was dismissed and an appeal
is pending before the Supreme Court.
   In the meantime, Arnel is considering becoming a priest.
   ``When I think about the things I've gone through and am going
through, I think that maybe God wants me to be a priest and serve
him,'' he said. ``At this point, I have nothing else to lose and I
am ready to offer my life.''
   The sense of loneliness and abandonment is all the more painful
at Christmas.
   Last Christmas, five days after the tragedy, Arnel spent the day
crying in a corner of his parents' home, gazing out the window. This
year, he plans to spend the holiday alone.
   ``I can't bear to face them again,'' he said.

   The scantily dressed dancers are long
gone. The last liquor store was blown up six years ago. This ancient
Roman city now is the capital in Lebanon of Shiite Moslem
fundamentalism.
   Public drinking and dancing are forbidden now, but brief
male-female unions called pleasure marriages are condoned.
   On the surface at least, life in Baalbek is governed by the
dictates of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's stern brand of Islamic
fundamentalism in Iran, which to Western eyes appears joyless and
forbidding.
   Wearing make-up or jewelery in public is taboo. So is singing and
dancing at mixed gatherings, because as one woman noted, ``it causes
psychological imbalance and tempts men.''
   But when the sun goes down and the doors are locked, the black
robe-like chadors Shiite women have to wear in public are discarded
in favor of shorts and strapless tops, along with make-up and
perfume.
   ``People think we're made of stone just because we cover
ourselves with chadors. But we're not. We're ready to do anything to
please our husbands,'' said Selma, a housewife.
   Before Lebanon's civil war erupted in 1975, Baalbek was a
cultural center where dance and theatrical festivals were held in
the breathtaking Roman amphitheaters.
   Now the ruins echo to Islamic slogans as the fundamentalists
stage political rallies there, chanting ritual denunciations of
``Death to America! Death to Israel!'' The amphitheaters have also
been used as mortar positions in Lebanon's sectarian fighting.
   The Shiites' strict lifestyle has drawn bitter criticism from
many Lebanese, Moslems and Christians alike, who say that the
fundamentalists' ``double standards'' has brought Islam into
disrepute.
   Most Shiites in Baalbek belong to Hezbollah (Party of God), which
is believed to be an umbrella for Shiite kidnappers holding most of
the 15 foreigners missing in Lebanon. It's made up of zealots
blindly loyal to Khomeini.
   ``We follow whatever Khomeini decrees. Whatever he rejects, we
reject,'' said Zeinab Nasser, an administrator at the women's
``haouzeh,'' or religious center, in Baalbek.
   The practice of pleasure marriage is one of the many customs
frowned on by other Lebanese, especially moderate Shiites and Sunnis.
   In a pleasure marriage, a young woman who would not dare expose a
curl of her hair from under her chador can take on an unlimited
number of lovers in the name of religion.
   But most of the women who take part in pleasure marriages are
considered respectable and far from promiscuous.
   The practice is widespread in Iran, where overwhelming majority
of the 54 million population is Shiite.
   Nasser said the Prophet Mohammed sanctioned pleasure marriage,
making it acceptable for a couple to marry for a specified period
which could last ``for an hour, two days, a month, or as long as
they desire.''
   ``It's all perfectly legal and provisions are made for any child
born after the marriage contract expires,'' she explained.
   She said pleasure marriage is especially practical amid Lebanon's
economic crisis because ``men cannot afford a regular marriage, and
let's face it, they have physical needs.
   ``If these cannot be met within a permanent marriage, pleasure
marriage provides the outlet,'' she added. ``It's much better than
doing it illicitly.''
   No cleric is required to perform the cermony. The woman, who
should preferably be either divorced or widowed, tells the man, ``I
give myself to you in pleasure.''
   He responds: ``I accept.'' And that's it.
   Virgins need the consent of their parents, but they often do not
seek it.
   As for forms of entertainment, the fundamentalists permit
classical music ``because it does not have any negative
psychological effects,'' Nasser said.
   She observed that a scientific report proved that loud music is
bad for ``the nerves and the blood circulation.''
   Like other factions in Lebanon, where the government has
collapsed, the Shiites have established their own medical and
welfare systems, amply funded by Iran.
   Abbas Mousavi, a Hezbollah leader, told The Associated Press:
``Social work has become one of our main responsibilities because of
the catastrophes that have befallen Lebanon.
   ``We've founded the Imam Khomeini Hospital here which provides
free medical treatment. There are similar centers in other Shiite
areas.''
   He noted: ``We've also founded pharmacies that make a very small
profit, as well as schools, which we hope will accommodate 6,000
students in the near future.
   ``We've given money to needy families and bought deep-bore drills
to provide wells in remote villages, especially those we consider
have military or political importance.''
   Asked about complaints on restrictions against alcohol and night
clubs, Mousavi noted: ``We're not imposing Islamic values on people.
No one can say we've raided houses where people gamble or drink.''
   Asked about the bombing of liquor stores and clubs, he conceded:
``There were incidents where young men acted out of Islamic zeal
after witnessing aberrant behavior. But Hezbollah is against that.''

<HEAD>Reports Conflict on Whether Jane Byrne May Run to Regain Mayor's
Office</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 39-year-old alderman on Sunday became the only
Hispanic candidate to enter the mayor's race, while reports
conflicted on whether former Mayor Jane Byrne would announce her
intention to regain her old office.
   WBBM-TV reported late Sunday that Mrs. Byrne said she would file
her nominating petitions Monday and would announce her candidacy as
a Republican.
   Cook County Republican Chairman James E. Dvorak confirmed Mrs.
Byrne's plans and also said he would meet Monday with another
rumored Republican candidate, former Alderman Edward Vrdolyak, the
television station said.
   Mrs. Byrne's home telephone went unanswered Sunday evening. A
local radio station, WMAQ-AM, said it had talked with Mrs. Byrne on
Sunday and she had indicated she did not intend to file petitions
Monday, the deadline.
   Meanwhile, Alderman Juan Soliz, president pro tem of the City
Council, announced his candidacy, saying he could bridge the city's
racial divisions better than either the announced white or black
candidates.
   Soliz joined five other Democrats _ three black and two white _
in seeking the highest office in the heavily Democratic city.
   The only announced Republican candidate is Edward Howlett, the
son of a former Democratic Illinois secretary of State. Republican
slatemakers recently declined to endorse Howlett, saying instead
that Vrdolyak and four lesser-known unannounced candidates have
their go-ahead to run.
   Mrs. Byrne served her term as mayor, 1979-83, as a Democrat. In
the Democratic mayoral primary of 1983, she split the white vote
with Cook County State's Attorney Richard M. Daley, which allowed
the late Harold Washington to win the nomination, and ultimately to
become the city's first black mayor.
   Washington died of a heart attack in November 1987 a few months
after winning a second term.
   The Illinois Supreme Court has set April 4 as the date for a
special election to fill the remaining two years of Washington's
second term. The Democratic primary is scheduled for Feb. 28.
   Daley, son of the late Mayor Richard J. Daley, again is a
candidate for the Democratic nomination, as are Washington's
successor, Mayor Eugene Sawyer, Aldermen Timothy Evans and Lawrence
Bloom, former state Sen. James Taylor and Soliz. Daley and Bloom are
white, while Sawyer, Evans and Taylor are black.
   Another black alderman, Danny Davis, dropped out of the race
Thursday, saying Daley would win the election unless blacks unite
behind a single candidate. Davis pledged his support to Evans.
   Soliz said he hopes for the support of other local Hispanic
leaders, although he acknowledged that two other Hispanics in the
City Council have already thrown their support to Evans.
   The city's population is a little more than 40 percent white, 40
percent black, 15 percent Hispanic and less than 5 percent of other
races.

   The government is looking for a dozen men
who wouldn't mind feasting on a diet of King salmon for 100 days.
They'd even get paid a $2,300 salary.
   But there's a catch for those who participate in the U.S.
Department of Agriculture study.
   ``We're talking about salmon with dill weed, broiled salmon,
baked salmon _ just like the fine restaurant food,'' said Gary
Nelson, project coordinator for the department's Western Human
Nutrition Research Center at the Presidio.
   He said the study should begin in January, and cautioned that it
might not be quite as tantalizing as it sounds because it entails
confinement, lots of physical tests and no conjugal visits.
   Participants will sleep, eat and drink at the center's hotellike
facility that has a pool table, compact disc player and television.
There will be daily walks and some organized activities, but no
monkey business allowed.
   ``We don't want anyone to sneak a candy bar or a beer,'' said
Nelson.
   The Agriculture Department originally wanted women for its study,
but couldn't find any takers.
   The study is intended to gauge the effect that a steady diet of
fish has on keeping arteries free of blood clots.

   City officials decided to brighten the
holidays for the 1,170 residents of this rural Nebraska community by
paying their December electric bills.
   City Council agreed to forgive December bills totaling $41,069
when an audit showed a surplus in the city's electricity fund.
   City Clerk Dean Gartin said business and residential customers
were pleased to find out they didn't have an electric bill when they
came to City Hall to settle their monthly accounts.
   Helen Schmidt, director of the Franklin Senior Citizens Center,
said the electricity bonus was well-received.
   ``Senior citizens thought it was great because it saved
individuals approximately $50,'' Ms. Schmidt said. ``It was a
wonderful Christmas present to everyone and we are glad the city
passed it on to us.''
   Jim Wilsman, owner of Rightway Grocery, said the council's
goodwill saved him $1,200. It was ``like finding money on the
street,'' he said.
   The city purchases electricity for residences and businesses from
three utilities.

<TEXT>
   Fourth-grade students at Washington
Elementary School gave up their usual Friday afternoon treats to
donate $31.77 in pennies, nickels, dimes and quarters to victims of
the earthquake in Soviet Armenia.
   ``We were reading about the Red Cross effort in the paper and the
kids just starting digging into their pockets,'' said teacher Ruth
Cook. ``It was really spontaneous.''
   Mrs. Cook's class was studying geology when the earthquake hit
Dec. 7, and discussions soon turned to the hardships being endured
by the Armenian people. Her students decided to donate their weekly
candy money to the victims, and classes taught by Jan Bolton and
Kathy Drew soon joined in.
   ``I think when they heard about it, at first they thought,
`Russians, they're the enemy.' But that changed to `How can we
help,''' Mrs. Cook said.
   All the students wrote letters to an official at the Soviet
Embassy in Washington, D.C., explaining the donation.
   Nine-year-old Jared Howell's letter was chosen to represent the
group.
   ``We are very sorry to hear about the tragedy. We have thought a
lot about the people who were left without families and homes, and
would like to do what we can to try to help,'' he wrote. ``Please
accept our Christmas gift from Idaho to Russia.''

   Not far from where Marine Lance
Cpl. Jason Rother ended his heroic march through the scorching
Mojave Desert lies the shimmering ribbon of old Route 66.
   He nearly made it.
   Assigned to traffic duties during night desert maneuvers on Aug.
31, Rother was to have been picked up by 1 p.m.
   A communications foul-up left him stranded with three canteens of
water, some dry rations and a poncho to protect him from the Mojave
Desert, where temperatures soar beyond 110 degrees.
   Nearly two days passed before a search for the 19-year-old Marine
began.
   The Marine Corps is investigating the delay and why Rother was
stranded by his unit of the 2nd Marine Division based at Camp
Lejeune, N.C. Those matters, as well as why Rother was posted alone,
will be raised during court-martial proceedings against Rother's
superiors.
   ``The real issue is why it was 40 hours before we started
looking,'' says Marine Corps Lt. Col. Fred Peck from Washington.
   The mistake of Rother's superiors cost him his life. Two officers
have been relieved of their commands as a result. Another officer
and two sergeants face special courts-martial for charges of
dereliction of duty.
   Meanwhile, the commandant of the Marine Corps ordered his own
inquiry to prevent a future tragedy.
   At some point during his ordeal, Rother set out, marking an arrow
with stones to point his direction as he marched south out of a
canyon.
   Leaving two additional arrows, he turned north and began walking
toward the highway that was once U.S. Route 66, the cross-country
road of hope and despair described in John Steinbeck's novel, ``The
Grapes of Wrath.''
   ``Who knows how long he waited?'' said San Bernardino County
Sheriff's Deputy Chief Jerome Ringhofer.
   Ringhofer led the 160-member team that ultimately discovered
Rother's skeletal remains Dec. 4. Two earlier Marine-led searches
yielded some of Rother's equipment: a helmet, pack and flak jacket
he abandoned on his way.
   ``We always advise that anyone in the desert or mountains stay
put. But once he decided to move, he moved with direction and
purpose,'' said Ringhofer.
   Rother's bones, a wallet, his poncho, his clothing and an M203
rifle-grenade launcher were found near the community of Bagdad, less
than a mile from old Highway 66 and just north of the boundary of
the sprawling Twentynine Palms Marine training base, about 125 miles
east of Los Angeles.
   ``He covered approximately 17 miles,'' Ringhofer said. ``He made
a heroic effort, and he almost succeeded.
   ``He had to see the highway. You can't miss it.''
   At the last, suffering from heat exhaustion and dehydration,
Rother took off his clothes and neatly folded them. He neatly folded
his poncho. He was probably delirious.
   ``He removed all his clothing, all his gear. He walked away and
wandered,'' Ringhofer said. ``At that point, it was over.''
   The case is an unwanted first in an arm of the services that
prides itself on taking care of its own. Of the tens of thousands of
Marines who train every year at the Twentynine Palms Marine Corps
Air Ground Combat Center, Rother was the first lost to the
blistering wasteland.
   ``It is beautiful and unforgiving country,'' Ringhofer said.
   Peck defended the Marines' initial failed search for Rother,
citing the use of about 1,700 people, aided by aircraft, thermal
heat imaging devices and the expertise of desert survival experts.
   The real issue in the case, he said, was how Rother was left
unaccounted for, for nearly two days.
   ``The (commandant's) investigation is to try and determine how
did all this happen,'' Peck said. ``It has never happened before and
we don't want it to happen again.''
   Last week, Rother was buried with full military honors at Fort
Snelling National Cemetery near his hometown, Minneapolis.
   ``He was proud of being a Marine,'' said his mother, Cecelia King
of Minneapolis. ``Every time he came home, he presented himself to
his friends in uniform.''

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: A Peaceful Interlude But For How Long?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President-elect Bush will take over next month
during a period of unusual international harmony, with both the
Soviet Union and the Palestine Liberation Organization sounding
increasingly moderate.
   Foreign forces are likely to begin withdrawing from southern
Africa and Soviet troops should be about to conclude their scheduled
departure from Afghanistan.
   These are good portents for Bush but history shows how ephemeral
peaceful interludes can be. Just ask Jimmy Carter.
   It was just 10 years ago _ in December 1978 _ that Carter could
look out at the world with an air of confidence, able to boast three
foreign policy breakthroughs that won him widespread, albeit
temporary, admiration.
   Over a period of a few months, Carter successfully guided the
Panama Canal treaties past a skeptical Senate, reached agreement
with China on the establishment of diplomatic relations and _ his
most shining achievement _ spurred the Camp David breakthrough
between Egypt and Israel.
   At the end of 1978, Carter's standing in the polls had risen to
50 per cent, high by standards of the time, and he seemed destined
for a second term in the White House.
   Then came 1979, a year which ranks among the most disastrous
endured by any president. The year began with the ouster of the
pro-Western monarchy in Iran and its replacement by an avowedly
anti-American Islamic fundamentalist regime. It ended with the
seizure of American hostages in Tehran and their detention for 444
days.
   Indeed, the takeover of the American embassy there was part of a
pattern of anti-American turmoil in Islamic countries in the fall of
1979. In the space of one month, the U.S. embassies in Iran, Libya
and Pakistan were attacked by mobs.
   Before the year was out, the Soviet Union had invaded
Afghanistan, starting a downward spiral in superpower relations that
wasn't reversed for years.
   The invasion induced Carter to slap a grain embargo on the
Soviets, to withdraw from the 1980 summer Olympics in Moscow and to
shelve the SALT II treaty, which had been the centerpiece of a June
summit meeting between Carter and Soviet President Leonid Brezhnev.
   It seemed a new development buffeted the Carter administration
every month. Vietnamese troops occupied neighboring Cambodia.
Leftists took control in Nicaragua, paving the way for perhaps the
most divisive foreign policy issue of the Reagan presidency: U.S.
backing for the Nicaraguan Contras.
   Almost unnoticed at the time of the Soviet invasion of
Afghanistan was the collapse of a coalition government in El
Salvador, which in turn laid the groundwork for a civil war that
claimed the lives of an average of 800 civilians a month in 1980.
   On the domestic front, the news for Carter was no better. By
year's end, inflation reached 12 per cent, the result in large
measure of a hefty midyear price increase decreed by the oil export
cartel.
   There also was the widespread perception that Carter looked
foolish when his subordinates claimed to have ``discovered'' in the
late summer of 1979 the presence of a Soviet brigade in Cuba, only
to concede later that the brigade had been there for years.
   Carter's showing in the polls dipped to 32 per cent in October
after the brigade fiasco, reviving somewhat by year's end because of
initial public support for his handling of the hostage crisis.
   But restiveness within the Democratic party over Carter's
performance was such that Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., decided in
November 1979 to challenge him for the party's 1980 presidential
nomination. Carter survived that challenge but lost 44 states in his
re-election bid. He never recovered from the 1979 debacle.
   In contrast to that dismal era, the world nowadays seems
downright tame. Being president seems easier than it did in 1979. Or
was Ronald Reagan just more fortunate than his hard-luck predecessor?

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President-elect Bush has an opportunity to pull
the Defense Department from the quagmire of purchasing scandals by
appointing strong managers to monitor the weapons buying process
more closely, analysts say.
   ``It's the best opportunity we've ever had,'' said Lawrence Korb,
a former Pentagon official now with the Brookings Institution, a
liberal think tank. ``If someone goes in there with the right team
and the right attitude, you can do more good for this country, in my
view, than any secretary of defense.''
   Bush has indicated a desire to reverse the trend that has made
household names of such scandal-ridden contractors as Wedtech and
has made the practice of defrauding the Defense Department almost
commonplace.
   The president-elect on Friday announced the appointment of former
Senate Armed Services Committee chairman John Tower as defense
secretary. Although Tower earned a reputation as a friend of
military contractors during his years in the Senate and has worked
for some of them in recent years, he bowed to Bush's oft-stated
commitment to reform.
   ``The bottom line is that we must provide at least as much, if
not more, defense for less money. And to meet that challenge, we
must do several things. We must rationalize our force structure, we
must refine and reform our management and procurement procedures, we
must have biennial budgeting,'' Tower said.
   During the campaign, Bush embraced the recommendations of the
Packard Commission, a panel appointed by President Reagan to study
ways to reform the Defense Department.
   In its 1986 report, the commission proposed creation of an
undersecretary of defense for acquisition, strengthening the role of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff and having the president submit a two-year
military budget for congressional approval.
   The panel was headed by former Deputy Defense Secretary David
Packard.
   ``I favor the Packard Commission reforms,'' Bush told employees
of a Martin Marietta Corp., plant in Denver, Colo., last October.
   ``The head of that commission, Dave Packard, supports me for a
good reason. He knows that I'm going to put his reforms into effect
because I understand that those reforms can't be carried out
piecemeal,'' the vice president said.
   During the Reagan administration, the Defense Department
relinquished control of the acquisition process to the various armed
services, according to Korb, who served as assistant secretary for
manpower installation logistics from 1981 to 1985.
   Congress already has acted on the commission recommendation to
create the undersecretary position for acquisition. Robert Costello
currently holds the post, although Bush likely will name his own
person to the job -- a critical selection, analysts said.
   ``For the administration to run a more effective bidding process,
they must have top quality personnel,'' said Jay Koswinsky of the
Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank.
   Congress also approved reorganization legislation sponsored by
former Sen. Barry Goldwater, R-Ariz., and the late Bill Nichols, a
Democratic congressman from Alabama.
   The law overhauled the upper echelons of the Pentagon,
strengthening the Defense Department and designating the chairman of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff as the principal adviser to the president
and the secretary of defense.
   ``Up until 1985-1986 ... Congress traditionally had prevented
secretaries of defense from running that department because it was
an alliance between services and these uniformed guys and these old
barons on the Hill,'' Korb said. ``With the passage of
Goldwater-Nichols, they gave the secretary of defense and the
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff ... the power to run it.''
   The department Tower will run has been rocked by one scandal
after another, culminating with a federal investigation this year
into allegations of purchasing fraud and bribery involving
government officials, military contractors and consultants.
   Targets of the two-year probe include Melvyn Paisley, a former
assistant Navy secretary who became a consultant to several
aerospace contractors immediately upon leaving the Pentagon.
   Some of the largest defense contractors, including McDonnell
Douglas Corp., United Technologies Corp., and Unisys Corp., had
their offices searched, as did Victor Cohen, a top Air Force
acquisitions official.
   Among the other scandals:
   _In December 1983, the Sperry Corp. pleaded guilty to falsifying
payment requests for defense contracts and paid a $1 million fine.
   _Reports circulated in 1984 that the Pentagon paid $7,622 for a
10-cup coffeemaker used on the Air Force's C-5A cargo plane and $600
for a toilet seat cover.
   _In 1985, General Dynamics withdrew its request for $491,840 from
the Pentagon for the 76 trips David S. Lewis, the company's
chairman, made from St. Louis to Albany, Ga., where he owned a farm.
The company later withdrew $23 million in bills.
   _In 1987, U.S. prosecutors revealed that four former Wedtech
officials pleaded guilty to conspiring to bribe federal, state and
city officials.
   The four also pleaded guilty to grand larceny and bribery
charges, conspiring to submit $5 million in phony government
invoices and fraudulently passing off the Bronx, N.Y.-based Wedtech
as a minority-owned business.
   _In 1988, Sundstrand, a Rockford, Ill., manufacturer of
electronic, mechanical and hydraulic systems for aircraft, pleaded
guilty to four counts of defrauding the Defense Department by
overbilling on aircraft parts. The company also pleaded guilty in
Seattle to mischarging on government contracts.
   The company was fined $115 million for the Illinois crimes and
$12.3 million for its Sundstrand Data Control Operation in Seattle _
the largest fines paid for government contract fraud.

<HEAD>Reagan Officials At Odds On Weapons Plants Money</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration says its new budget
will contain enough money to run the nation's nuclear weapons plants
safely, despite Energy Secretary John Herrington's warning of a $360
million shortfall that could lead to shutdowns.
   Reagan's chief of staff, Kenneth N. Duberstein, said Sunday that
``unobligated balances'' found within the department will make it
possible to bring the facilities into compliance with safety and
environmental laws.
   ``Mr. Herrington suggested that he wanted some additional
spending rather than going into the Energy Department resources and
looking for some money, which we have done,'' Duberstein said in an
appearance on NBC's ``Meet The Press.''
   ``The president has said consistently we won't operate any of
these plants unless we can operate them in a safe manner,'' he said.
   Herrington suggested in a Dec. 9 letter to Duberstein that the
department might have to shut some of its plants unless the
administration proposes more than the $12.9 billion planned for
fiscal 1989.
   ``I must in good conscience advise you that ... the system will,
in all likelihood, be operating beyond the bounds of acceptable
risk,'' he wrote. Details of the letter were published in Sunday
editions of The Washington Post.
   If the department gives priority to production rather than
upgrading safety at the plants, Herrington said in the letter,
``then unresolved environmental and safety issues are likely to lead
to further shutdowns in the weapons complex.'' He said ``a
significant increase in resources'' is needed over the next five
years or the government will risk compromising the country's ability
to produce and maintain its nuclear weapons stockpile.
   Herrington told Duberstein in his letter that the department
would use the last of an emergency contingency fund to pay for $200
million in improvements at its Savannah River plant in South
Carolina, which has been plagued with safety and environmental
problems.
   He also cited unforeseen expenses at Rocky Flats, a Denver area
plutonium processing facility with hazardous waste problems that are
jeopardizing its operation, in explaining the expected $360 million
shortfall.
   Duberstein said he had sent a response to Herrington. He did not
indicate on the television program whether the unobligated money to
which he referred was in the contingency fund or elsewhere, and did
not say how much money had been found within the department.
   Duberstein said the department is in line for a $900 million
budget increase next year, up from its current budget of $12 billion.
   The Energy Department operates 17 weapons plants. It has proposed
spending $50 billion in the next 20 years to build new facilities
and correct the most pressing environmental problems.

<HEAD>Outgoing Pentagon Chief Advises Tower to Stick to His Guns</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Outgoing Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci
served in the job little more than a year, but he has some advice
for his successor _ work with Congress but don't stop fighting for
an increase in military spending.
   Carlucci also says former Sen. John Tower shouldn't turn the
Pentagon on its head in the name of reforming the weapons-buying
process, despite a string of scandals under the Reagan
administration. Carlucci says the U.S. defense industry needs
stability and without it, the industrial base could collapse.
   He has called for a 2 percent increase in the Pentagon's budget
while President-elect Bush, faced with a huge federal deficit, has
talked of zero-growth.
   ``It's not a question of we can't afford it,'' Carlucci said.
   ``If you look at the domestic programs, they continue to go up at
a rate of about 8 percent. Therefore, using that yardstick, I see
nothing wrong with 2 percent in defense,'' he said.
   Asked if he thought a Democratic Congress would go along with an
increase, Carlucci replied, ``If you don't try it's not politically
doable.''
   The defense secretary said he thought Tower, a veteran Armed
Service Committee chairman in the Senate, could make the case ``the
world is coming our way'' in part because of a stronger military.
   Carlucci was interviewed last week in his Pentagon office as he
awaited Bush's announcement of the man who would replace him.
   There is no question Tower will have problems managing Pentagon
contracting, Carlucci said. Indictments could be returned any day in
the long-running Justice Department investigation into Pentagon
fraud.
   ``But the last thing the Defense Department needs is somebody to
come in and yank the procurement system out by the roots again and
say we're going to reform it or change it,'' Carlucci said.
   ``The best reform for the procurement system is stability,
predictability. The blueprint is laid out ... we've made a large
number of changes in the procurement system. Real changes are taking
place in the procurement system and I am proud of them.''
   He said he had instituted a ``total quality management program''
to impress on contractors the need for quality products as well as
ethical conduct.
   The 58-year-old defense chief said he was looking forward to
finding a job in the private sector but had yet to do so.
   He listed among his accomplishments ``establishing a good
rapport'' with his Soviet counterparts, protecting U.S.-flagged
Kuwaiti tankers in the Persian Gulf, and convincing Congress it was
time to close unneeded bases.
   He said in addition to the Pentagon purchasing problems, Tower
will have to help develop arms-control strategy and strengthen the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization while convincing European allies
to resist ``the seductive appeal'' of Soviet arms-control proposals.
   Carlucci, who replaced Caspar W. Weinberger as defense secretary
for the last 14 months of the Reagan administration, said he had
enjoyed the position but found it truly was ``a full-time job.''
   ``On a per-hour basis, I make about as much as my babysitter,''
he joked, adding the secretary's salary of $99,500 is ``lousy.''

   The United States' decision to open talks
with the Palestine Liberation Organization is merely a first step
into a baffling maze toward Middle East peace.
   Myriad thorny obstacles lie ahead and centuries of enmity must be
surmounted. The competing claims of Arabs and Jews to the same lands
are rooted in thousands of years of history.
   Many Israelis and Palestinians harbor the often justified fear
that their foes would like them to forcibly disappear. It is a fear
that makes every compromise a national trauma, seemingly a step
toward national doom.
   Every Israeli recalls the vow of former PLO Chairman Ahmad
Shukairy to ``drive Israel into the sea.''
   Every Palestinian recalls the contention of Israel's late Prime
Minister Golda Meir that the Palestinian people ``do not exist.''
   Both sides cherish the memories of thousands of heroes who died
in the name of nationalism.
   PLO chairman Yasser Arafat has now met U.S. criteria for
negotiation and Washington has begun talking with PLO
representatives.
   But Israel's leaders, despite nearly universal acknowledgement
that the PLO represents the Palestinians, still refuse to deal with
what they call a ``terrorist'' organization.
   Before any kind of peace talks can start, Israel's objections
must be overcome _ or a way found to sugarcoat the PLO's bitter
presence.
   The Reagan adminstration has favored submerging the PLO in a
Jordanian delegation to talks. It has also toyed with the idea of
having the PLO represented in talks by outside negotiators. The PLO
rejects both plans.
   Israeli leaders have suggested staging limited elections to
choose Palestinian negotiators from in the occupied West Bank and
Gaza Strip. But the last elections there produced a clutch of PLO
supporters, most of whom were deposed or deported by Israel.
   Due in part to their year-long uprising in the occupied lands,
the Palestinians have won wide international acceptance of their
call for a U.N.-sponsored peace conference.
   But the ground rules remain a major point of contention, even
beyond the invitation list.
   Israel and the United States reject the Arab idea that a
conference could force a solution if the parties themselves reach a
deadlock.
   The Palestinians also say a conference should be based on Israeli
withdrawal from the West Bank, Gaza Strip and Golan Heights, which
it seized in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war, as well as creation of a
Palestinian state.
   But even Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, a moderate Israeli leader
who favors some form of international conference, refuses to
consider a total withdrawal from the occupied lands.
   And no Israeli leader would even consider the key Arab demand
that Jerusalem be capital of the Palestinian state. The Israelis
annexed the city's eastern Arab sector after seizing it in 1967.
   And what of a Palestinian state?
   The Palestinians accept at least a period in which it would be
demilitarized _ a nod to Israel's security fears. And they call for
confederation with moderate Jordan _ an attempt to assuage Israeli
worries about a radical, independent actor on their flanks.
   Israelis and Americans, however, have tended to speak of such an
entity as a province of Jordan, or a sub-state whose police are
overseen by Israel itself.
   Such an entity would be located in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
But roughly 70,000 Jewish settlers now live there _ and half the
land has been confiscated or bought by Israel.
   Much of the area's water, a commodity as precious as gold in the
region, is already used by Israel, which would be hard-pressed to
forfeit it. The Palestinians would find it difficult to thrive
without it.
   More than 3 million Palestinians live in diaspora, and most claim
legal rights to homes and lands in what is now Israel or
Israeli-controlled lands.
   The right of return they claim would cause shattering trauma in
Israel. While many might remain in the countries that have sheltered
them for 40 years, compensation would cost billions of dollars.
   And many would not accept.
   While the PLO itself has agreed to live in peace with Israel, a
handful of splinter groups regard acceptance of Israel as tantamount
to treason. Some Israelis who believe all of Palestine was promised
to them by God would also object.
   Any peace settlement would almost certainly unleash terrorism by
people desperate to sabotage it.
   Some leftist Israelis and some Palestinians see the answer in a
confederation between the two feuding peoples themselves.
   And many Palestinians still cling to the hope that Israel, one
day, will peacefully decide to merge with a Palestinian state.
   ``I can't even visit the family tombs in the yard of my house''
in Haifa, said Khalid al-Hassan, a senior PLO official, who said he
still hopes for such a peaceful road to a ``democratic, secular
state.''
   ``We can't have a democracy via violence,'' he said.
   For many Israelis, however, even a peaceful end to their state
would be unthinkable.

<TEXT>
   Energy Secretary John Herrington is leaving
office firm in his conviction that the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries is doomed.
   ``In the long run, the OPEC cartel cannot survive,'' Herrington
said in a recent interview marking the end of his nearly four-year
tenure. ``Cartels do not work. They have never worked in history.''
   Several of OPEC's larger members have new incentives to produce
oil, rather than comply with last month's decision by the cartel to
limit production to 18.5 million barrels a day.
   Herrington cited the following examples:
   _Venezuela has a major stake in the Citgo chain of service
stations and despite previous support of OPEC, the South American
nation's ``future is here, not with OPEC.''
   _Saudi Arabia is buying service stations and a refinery from
Texaco ``and that's a major change.''
   _``We've got two countries who have been at war for eight years
(Iran and Iraq) with 40 to 50 billion dollars in war debt, and a
reconstruction budget that is going to be horrendous, with one thing
to sell _ oil.''
   Herrington contends that ownership of U.S. distribution
facilities by overseas producers should be welcomed because of the
incentives it gives producers to bring oil to market.
   ``It's good for the United States and it's good for Saudi Arabia.
No. 1, it's a guaranteed market for Saudi Arabia and No. 2, it's a
guaranteed supply for us,'' Herrington said.
   Those who fear a resumption of the oil shocks of the 1970s don't
realize ``we live in a fundamentally different world,'' he said.
   In the first half of 1986, the oil industry was devastated by the
collapse of crude oil from above $27 a barrel to less than $12
(measured by average refiner cost). Half the 1,980 exploration rigs
active in 1985 were idled and 120,000 out of 585,000 exploration and
production jobs vanished.
   Crude oil now sells for about $15 a barrel. Imports have risen
from less than 30 percent of U.S. consumption in 1985 to more than
40 percent now. At the same time, U.S. production has fallen by a
million barrels of crude a day to a little more than 8 million
barrels.
   While U.S. producers of crude oil have pleaded for trade
protection, Herrington and President Reagan maintained that quotas
or tariffs would harm the U.S. economy more than they would help the
oil industry.
   A tariff might be politically impossible anyway because of the
demands for exemptions by Northeast consumers, Mexico and the
petrochemical industry plus the mandatory exemption for Canada under
the free-trade agreement, Herrington said.
   Herrington said ``cooperation with OPEC is not the solution,''
although he said he understood why Texas, Alaska and Louisiana sent
observers to the OPEC meeting.
   ``This is not an industry we can allow to go by the boards,''
Herrington said. He said he did not know just how big an industry
the nation should try to preserve, but, ``I think it should be a
lean, mean, efficient industrial part of our economy, which I think
it is today.''
   On other issues, Herrington said the U.S. economy has to become
more energy-efficient.
   The nation has made big gains in efficiency. The economy in 1987
was 40 percent larger than it was in 1973, but it used only 2
percent more energy.
   However, the gains are slowing down. West Germany and Japan use
energy with twice the efficiency of the United States.
   ``That's got to change. Now, is that the federal government's
job?'' Herrington said. ``My position is, a lot of these problems
are tax policy questions'' that will yield to ``tried and true'' tax
incentives.
   Advocacy groups have blasted Herrington and his predecessors
under Reagan for sharply curtailing spending on conservation,
efficiency and renewable sources of energy. Herrington dismisses the
criticisms.
   ``Are we spending enough money? I think we are. It's true we're
not building the giant wind machines for $10 million any more, like
Mod 2 and Mod 3, that we're reselling years later for $13,000.''
   As for an environmentalist favorite, higher taxes on gasoline to
discourage consumption, Herrington admitted that a big increase
would do the job but said ``I stand foursquare with the president''
against more taxes.

<HEAD>Salmon Soar as Commercial Crop</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Salmon production is soaring at fish farms
worldwide, spurred in part by greater demand and buying power in
Japan, an Agriculture Department report says.
   ``Worldwide salmon production is estimated up 75 percent from
last year to over 300 million pounds,'' the report said. ``Norway,
the top producer, likely raised about 160 million pounds in 1988,
almost double 1987's output.''
   In the United States salmon farming, or aquaculture, is
concentrated in Washington, Oregon, California and, most recently,
Maine. Last year's production was around 85 million pounds, but the
U.S. salmon figures for 1988 are not available yet.
   Large Japanese demand and the strong value of the yen has boosted
competition in world salmon markets, the report said. The heavy
buying by Japan has reduced the U.S. supply of top-quality salmon
available to consumers, forcing some restaurants to remove salmon
from their menus.
   ``A buying frenzy resulted from early reports of a small Alaskan
catch coupled with losses in the Norwegian salmon crop because of a
`red tide' infestation of a microorganism that reduces the oxygen
level of the water so the fish suffocate,'' the report said.
   Salmon farming makes up only a fraction of total U.S. aquaculture
production, but some authorities believe the industry is poised for
a major expansion, perhaps doubling or tripling domestic output in a
few years.
   The report was prepared by economists Mike Dicks and David Harvey
of the department's Economic Research Service, who are the agency's
chief aquaculture specialists.
   Harvey said in a telephone interview that the U.S. salmon
production figures are being studied and revised to get a more
accurate picture of how much of the output goes into the commercial
food supply.
   Also, he said, whether the current salmon boom continues will
depend on many economic, legal and consumer factors.
   Overall, including food and non-food fish, shellfish and other
aquatic products, U.S. aquacultural output rose by 20 percent in
1987 to almost 750 million pounds worth $650 million.
   The 1987 expansion was led by catfish, crawfish and salmon, with
a combined production of more than 550 million pounds, or about 73
percent of the total. Catfish output was estimated at 370 million
pounds; crawfish, 95 million pounds; and salmon, about 85 million
pounds.
   But the report said that expansion probably will slow to less
than 10 percent a year in the next 10 years unless new technology
and more resources become available.
   ``A shortage of water supplies likely will impede expansion,
particularly in areas where production is already highly
concentrated,'' the report said. ``Where aquaculture is just
beginning to develop, limited management resources, capital and
industry infrastructure will constrain expansion.''
   With a slower growth and little increase expected in the
commercial catch of wild fish, Americans probably will depend
increasingly on imports, which totaled $8.8 billion in 1987.
However, the report added, this could be modified by new technology,
growth of the commercial fishing fleet and shifts in consumer demand.
   The report noted some of the new research and technology in the
industry:
   _In Maine, research continues on lobster production, and in
Canada scientists are working with the black cod, a favorite in
Japan and the United States.
   _Striped bass, or rockfish, were in short supply following a ban
on their catch three years ago in the Chesapeake Bay, the main
production area. The fish are now being produced in California and
North Carolina, with production likely starting up next year in
Texas, Arizona, Mississippi and Maryland.
   _Oysters, littleneck clams, red fish and sturgeon are other
species traditionally supplied from the wild catch that are now
being farmed.
   _The development of genetically superior catfish and trout offers
potential for expansion. For example, Auburn University has crossed
a commercial blue catfish with the channel catfish to produce a
hybrid with a 40 percent greater growth rate and a high tolerance
for low-oxygen water.

<HEAD>Soviet Press Gave Hints of Coming Troop Cuts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nearly four years after Mikhail Gorbachev began
his policy of greater openness, Westerners still search the Soviet
press for subtle hints about what is going on in the Kremlin.
   Close reading of an article buried in the inside pages of Sept.
16 editions of the main Soviet military newspaper warned Red Army
officers that civilians would be giving them more orders _ a strong
hint that Gorbachev soon would be announcing troop cuts.
   Two weeks later, Gorbachev consolidated his power in the Kremlin.
And on Dec. 7 he announced a decision that had been opposed by the
military, a 10 percent reduction in the Soviet armed forces,
including withdrawal of 50,000 soldiers from Eastern Europe.
   One Kremlin-watcher is the former head of the U.S. government's
super-secret National Security Agency, ret. Lt. Gen. William Odom.
He sees a strong link between the Kremlin shakeup, in which
Gorbachev demoted his conservative rival Yegor Ligachev, and
announcement of the troop cuts.
   At the same time that Gorbachev announced the troop cuts, Kremlin
spokesmen confirmed the resignation of a leading military opponent
of unilateral Soviet reductions, Marshal Sergei F. Akhromeyev, the
chief of the Soviet General Staff.
   Both Ligachev and Akhromeyev made the mistake of publicly
contradicting Gorbachev, and they paid the price.
   In July, Ligachev had reasserted the class basis of international
relations, undercutting Gorbachev's bid to mend fences with the
West. And in that same month Akhromeyev told a Pentagon news
conference that the Soviets would not cut their forces unless the
West did likewise.
   Both statements have assumed greater importance in retrospect
than they were accorded at the time in the West.
   Odom, who published an article on ``Soviet Military Doctrine'' in
the winter edition of Foreign Affairs magazine, said in a telephone
interview it is not yet clear whether Gorbachev will be able to
change the deployment of Red Army troops sufficiently to reduce
Western anxiety about Soviet offensive military capability.
   ``I am waiting with bated breath to see whether Gorbachev can
make it stick,'' Odom said in a telephone interview. ``The situation
as I see it is that the lines are drawn on the military issue
between the General Staff and Gorbachev's reformers.''
   Gorbachev and his civilian allies realize that the enormous sums
the Kremlin spends on defense are helping to cripple the rest of the
economy.
   ``Today's Soviet forces are so large that one must ask why they
have been created and deployed,`` wrote Odom. ``They overshadow not
only U.S. forces but also exceed the combined forces within the
Western alliance structure.''
   Indications that Soviet civilian reformers were prevailing came
in the Sept. 16 article in ``Red Star,'' the Defense Ministry
newspaper. The article set off alarm bells for several reasons,
among them the identity of the author, A. Kokoshin, a think-tank
scholar who for more than a year has been leading a rhetorical
assault against the pre-eminence of military officers in formulating
national security policy.
   Although the Red Army is answerable to the Kremlin's ruling
Politburo, lower-level civilians previously had not been allowed a
say in national security policies. The Soviet defense minister and
his aides have traditionally been uniformed military officers, in
contrast to the United States, where the top Defense Department
officials are civilians and national security issues are publicly
debated in Congress and the press.
   In essence, Kokoshin said civilian scholars would be telling Red
Army officers which weapons they needed and how to use them, a
domain that has always been firmly in the hands of uniformed
officers.
   So, while Gorbachev's theatrical announcement of the troop cut
was seen as a diplomatic coup, the substance if not the timing came
as no great surprise to those who read between the lines of Soviet
newspapers.
   Western analysts began to pay serious attention to the military
doctrine of ``reasonable sufficiency,'' which Gorbachev used as a
rationale for the troop cuts, after a non-military Russian-language
journal called World Peace and International Relations published an
August 1987 article reassessing an important Soviet battle in World
War II.
   The battle of Kursk, in 1943, was the largest tank engagement in
history, and ranks with the more famous battle of Stalingrad as a
decisive defeat for the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union in World
War II.
   The article concluded that a sound defense can defeat a
blitzkrieg, and by implication, that the Soviets had no need to
maintain a massive tank army of the kind now stationed in Eastern
Europe.

<HEAD>Money Drain from Third World Nations Up This Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Third World debt crisis will drain another
$43 billion this year from nations that can least afford it, up from
the $38.1 billion loss last year, the World Bank says.
   This year's total is swollen by $31.1 billion leaving heavily
indebted nations such as Argentina and Nigeria, the bank said in an
assessment issued Sunday.
   The outflow from Third World countries consists largely of debt
repayments to commercial banks, the United States, other industrial
countries and intergovernment lenders such as the World Bank.
   In the past, money in the form of loans and investments tended to
flow from the wealthy countries to development of the poor ones.
   The bank, which is owned by 151 countries with the United States
holding the largest number of shares, said the report indicated that
development and quality of life in many Third World nations may be
taking a back seat to debt reduction.
   ``Although both incomes and consumption have fallen _ incomes in
most highly indebted countries are lower today than a decade ago _
the adjustment burden has fallen mainly on investment,'' the report
said.
   Stanley Fischer, vice president and top economist at the World
Bank, said two messages emerged from the report:
   ``The first is that despite remarkably rapid growth in the
industrialized world in 1988, growth in the debtor nations has not
resumed. The second message is that the debt strategy is entering a
new phase, in which debt reduction is playing an increasingly
important role,'' Fischer said.
   The report raised the bank's estimate of Third World debt to
$1.32 trillion at the end of this year. The total is expected to
drop to $1.3 trillion in 1989.
   Debt has been growing more slowly because of changes in currency
values, some agreements to reduce debt and the continued reluctance
of commercial banks to make new loans.
   Average annual income in Argentina dropped to $1,630 last year
from $1,990 in 1980, according to the bank. In African nations south
of the Sahara, the average annual income fell from $570 in 1980 to
$440 last year.
   The World Bank urged governments of the creditor countries to
encourage imports from the debtor nations. Debtor countries,
meanwhile, should change their policies to encourage loans and
investments, the bank said.

   The dollar inched down against the Japanese yen
Monday while share prices fell on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
   The dollar closed at 124.02 yen, down 0.08 yen from Friday's
close of 124.10 yen. Opening higher at 124.20 yen, the currency
moved in a range of 123.93-124.33 yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, a 169.04-point
loser Friday, lost another 66.63 points, or 0.23 percent, to close
at 29,470.08.
   The index rose 56.64 points in early trading but erased the gain
in directionless trading. A dealer with Daiwa Securities said
investors were staying on the sidelines amid concerns over a
possible hike in the U.S. discount rate.
   ``Trading was very thin in the first place, and a majority of
market players didn't have specific ideas on which issues to buy,''
he added.
   On the currency exchange market, the U.S. unit's stability
reflected higher U.S. interest rates and continuing market
expectations for an increase in the U.S. discount rate, dealers said.
   But the dollar's firm note is unlikely to continue because many
investors are considering selling the dollar on overseas markets
ahead of the Christmas holidays, said one dealer at a commercial
bank in Tokyo.

<HEAD>Asian Students Under Stress To Excel</HEAD>

   At 13, Sharanne Au sees childhood passing by in
a blur as she scrambles to excel in school and join what researchers
call a cheerless, over-pressured, and sometimes suicidal generation
of Asian scholars.
   ``I am ordered by adults to hurry, to go faster and faster, to
rush into adulthood while I am still a child...
   ``We must be successful. Nothing else counts. Honesty,
compassion, understanding are given lip-service, but all that counts
is to be the best in material things ... There is schoolwork,
extra-curricular work, homework, holiday homework and work to
`enrich' my life. They have taken away time,'' the schoolgirl wrote
in a letter to a local newspaper.
   In this island republic of 2.6 million and throughout Asia,
youths are seeking psychiatric help in increasing numbers because
parents relentlessly pressure them to achieve academic credits they
hope will lead to the good life.
   Competition for university enrollment is hotter than in the West,
in part because Asia has fewer colleges and in part because of the
emphasis placed on education here.
   According to one survey from Singapore's Advisory Committee on
Youth, the number of new cases at the Child Psychiatric Clinic
jumped from 677 in 1983 to 1,071 last year.
   Seven- and 10-year-olds talked of suicide because they could not
cope with their studies.
   ``To most of them, education was stress and pressure,'' said
teacher Geraldine Loh, chairman of the committee, which recommended
reducing the emphasis on tests, widening curriculum and hiring
full-time counselors at schools.
   Another study described the typical 19- to 24-year-old in
Singapore as out of shape, unappreciative of the arts, uninvolved
with community service, and obsessed with high grades.
   ``All of them equated a degree with a well-paying job and better
standard of living,'' said civil servant Goh Song How, whose
committee conducted the survey.
   Educators blame the parents and parents blame the system, which
begins separating children by academic levels at the age of nine.
   Tutoring has become a multimillion-dollar business, and some find
work prepping kindergarten children. There are no dropouts in
Singapore _ the official label is ``premature school leaver.''
   One teacher said some parents also suffer from neurotic anxiety
when children do not excel. ``It is not just the children losing the
rat race, it is a reflection on their heredity,'' he said.
   When college admission examination results are announced, student
suicides peak in Japan and several other countries. Failure is
regarded as a stunning loss of face.
   About 9,700 Singaporeans study overseas, mostly in the United
States, Britain, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, compared to
15,000 at the National University of Singapore. Some opt to go
abroad to gain foreign credentials, but most of those who can afford
it have little choice after failing to gain admission to NUS.
   The International Association for the Evaluation of Educational
Achievement said in an analysis issued in New York this year that
students from Japan, Hong Kong, South Korea or Singapore scored best
in four out of five science tests it conducted in 17 countries in
North America, Asia and Europe.
   This appears to be partly the result of ``streaming,'' the
phasing out of the less academically bright. Students in some
countries have to choose between science and art when they reach 14.
Those who pick science then concentrate almost exclusively on math,
physics, chemistry, biology and computers.
   In Singapore, streaming starts at the end of third grade, when
students are about nine years old, and further streaming takes place
at the end of primary school.
   Education experts also ascribe the test results in part to
parental pressure, based on stronger motivation linked to the the
emphasis their cultures traditionally placed on learning, and the
material and social rewards promised by a college degree.
   Families in China are pushing their children to learn too much
too fast in their attempt to get their kids on the fast track, an
official newspaper said recently.
   Parents have stopped teaching their children values, such as
morality and the joys of labor, because they are spending too much
time cramming their heads with facts, the paper said.

   Celebrities including Ray Charles, Harry
Belafonte, Neil Sedaka and Ben Vereen have helped raise more than
$9.4 million in pledges for the United Negro College Fund.
   Aretha Franklin and Bob Hope also were among the more than 50
people who appeared in the Ninth Annual Lou Rawls Parade of Stars
over the weekend.
   Taped messages from Michael Jackson and President Reagan were
shown during the seven-hour telethon.
   ``These students are going to be the next politicians, lawyers,
doctors, engineers. ... We've got to make sure they get it right in
order for them to fulfill themselves and their destiny,'' says Rawls.
   Contributions benefit 42 private colleges enrolling about 45,000
students.
   The show was broadcast in Los Angeles Saturday night but will not
be shown in several other cities until Dec. 30. Telethon officials
said telephone lines will remain open until the show has been
televised in all target areas.

   Bill Cosby continues to shower black
colleges with gifts, donating a total of $1.5 million to two
southern schools.
   Cosby has donated $700,000 to Bethune-Cookman College in Daytona
Beach for science scholarships, says school President Oswald Bronson.
   ``He was very interested in the strength of our science and
mathematics departments,'' says Bronson.
   Ernest Cook Sr., vice president for physical affairs, says the
money will fund about 10 four-year scholarships each year.
   Bronson, who traveled to New York to receive the check from Cosby
on Friday, said the entertainer also gave $800,000 to Meharry
Medical College in Nashville, Tenn.
   Bronson solicited the donation when he met Cosby at a dinner
party two months ago. The president said he was so persistent that
Cosby later joked he expected to find Bronson hiding in his salad.
   Cosby, one of the richest men in show business, has donated
millions over the years to traditionally black colleges, including
$20 million given to Atlanta's Spelman College last month.

   Jimmy Buffett and Herbie Hancock joined a
crowd of other musicians in a French Quarter club for a television
tribute to the Neville Brothers and Louisiana music.
   HBO-Cinemax taped a one-hour show on zydeco _ a fusion of Cajun
music with rhythm and blues _ and other music rooted in the Pelican
state on Sunday for airing in April or May.
   ``It's really getting a good reception from people everywhere ...
And amazingly, they know a lot about it,'' said Charles Neville,
whose group's hits include ``They All Asked For You.''
   Buffett says he started listening to Louisiana music as a child
in Alabama.
   ``I was growing up in Mobile and was listening to radio stations
from New Orleans because they could make it across the Gulf (of
Mexico). So I was always influenced by New Orleans rhythm and blues,
more so than any other music growing up,'' he said.
   The show also featured Greg Allman, John Hyatt, the Dixie Cups,
the Dirty Dozen Brass Band and Buckwheat Zydeco. Actor Dennis Quaid,
who played a New Orleans detective in ``The Big Easy,'' and Ed
Bradley, a reporter on CBS' ``60 Minutes,'' also were on hand.

   An injury prevented hockey star Guy Lafleur from
suiting up for the game, but that didn't stop the crowd from giving
a lusty tribute to their returning hero.
   ``What I gave to them as a hockey player while I was here, they
gave back to me tonight by their encouragement,'' Lafleur said after
Saturday night's game between the Montreal Canadiens and the New
York Rangers.
   Lafleur, 37, who retired from the Canadiens in November 1984
after a 14-year career, is making a comeback this season with the
Rangers.
   In anticipation of watching him sweep down the ice again, some
fans among the crowd of 17,742 at the Montreal Forum paid as much as
$400 a ticket.
   But Lafleur was sidelined by a broken bone in his left foot
suffered in a game Dec. 10. His on-ice return to the Forum won't
occur until Feb. 4.
   The Canadiens decided to go through with a pre-game ceremony
honoring his election into the Hall of Fame in September, and the
crowd responded with a three-minute ovation and chants of ``Guy!
Guy! Guy!''
   Asked how disappointing it was not to be playing, Lafleur said,
``It's not big enough to cry about it, but for sure I'd much rather
be out on the ice. I feel sad for all the people who bought tickets
especially to see me play.''

   Torrential rains in Java over the
weekend burst dams and triggered floods and landslides that killed
at least 40 people, including nine scouts on a camping trip,
authorities said today.
   Since Saturday, 17 people died in floods and 14 in landskides in
the central districts of Pemalang, Pekalongan and the regional
capital of Semarang, the regional governor's office said.
   Dams on the rivers Kali Comal and Sikuang burst as a result of
the torrents, releasing floodwaters that cut communications and rail
links between Jakarta and Semarang, 340 miles east of the capital.
   Rivai Soegiono, a Pemalang district official, said 80 percent of
the area's 216 villages were submerged in waters that had risen to
as much as 6{ feet. Floodwaters swept away homes and ravaged
farmland.
   In the island's western district of Bogor on Saturday, a
landslide killed nine scouts who were on a camping trip, the
government's Search and Rescue Agency said. It said the victims were
among 57 scouts from Jakarta, all junior high school students, who
were camping about 40 miles south of the capital.

   The case of two fair-skinned firefighters who were
hired under a minority preference plan after saying they were black
has spawned citywide investigations of minority hiring and sparked
debate.
   The strange case of 33-year-old twins Philip and Paul Malone was
not challenged until this summer, though the Malones have been with
the department for 10 years. They were suspended from the department
without pay in August for allegedly misrepresenting their race as a
minority. They are awaiting an appeal of their case in the state
Supreme Judicial Court.
   As a result, the racial backgrounds of 36 other firefighters have
been investigated, according to department officials. Eleven
firefighters, most who identified themselves as Hispanic, now face
hearings but are still working.
   The Police Department was investigated as well, but no evidence
of suspected minority misrepresentation was found. A review of the
city School Department is ongoing.
   The Malones, who live in suburban Milton, have refused to discuss
their case publicly on the advice of their attorneys. Theporters.
   ``It all comes down to who says who is black and how black do you
have to be,'' said Marsha Malone, Philip Malone's wife, recently.
``We're trying to be optimistic because they (the brothers) want
their jobs back.''
   The twins first applied to the Fire Department in 1975,
identifying themselves as white. But their scores on the state civil
service exam were too low on the grading curve for acceptance into
the department.
   They took the test again two years later and this time identified
themselves as black. They later explained that their mother told
them in 1976 that their maternal great-grandmother was black. At the
time, documentation was not required to back up their claim.
   By 1978, when the twins got their jobs, there was a minority
preference plan for hiring in effect and their scores apparently
were sufficient for them to be hired as minorities.
   The controversy over their claims to be black arose earlier this
year when the twins took the lieutenant's exam and scored well, said
Fire Department spokesman Matthew Corbett.
   When state civil service officials returned the list of scores,
the brothers were identified as black.
   Corbett and Fire Commissioner Leo Stapleton, who both worked with
the Malones in a station house, have said they never knew the
Malones had been hired as minorities until they saw the indications
on the lieutenant's exams.
   ``They look like ... 6-2 white guys, Irish guys, maybe a little
German because they have blond hair,'' said Corbett.
   Boston instituted a minority preference hiring plan after a
federal judge ordered the Fire Department in 1974 to bring minority
representation up to levels comparable to the city's population.
   At that time, just 19 of more than 2,100 city firefighters were
black or Hispanic. Today, the department is 21 percent black and
Hispanic, compared to 29 percent for the city's population.
   ``It's a very serious situation,'' said City Councilman Bruce C.
Bolling, who is black and who represents a predominantly black
section of the city. Bolling had asked Mayor Raymond Flynn to
conduct a full investigation of minority hiring after the Malone
case was publicized.
   ``The Malone brothers characterized themselves as black and took
two positions that should have gone to minorities,'' he said.
   Corbett said the department changed its guidelines after the
Malone brothers were suspended, with incoming firefighters now
required to furnish more documentation about their racial background.
   The state criteria for determining who should be designated as
black for minority hiring purposes involves a three-part test:
visual identification; documentary evidence; and evidence that the
individuals consider themselves minority in the community. Boston
uses the first two parts.
   ``Part of the problem is that it's never really been defined just
what a minority is,'' said Corbett. ``We need to determine just what
is a minority.''

<HEAD>Dollar Down Slightly, Stock Prices Fall</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar inched down against the Japanese yen
today, and share prices fell slightly on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
   The dollar closed at 124.02 yen, down 0.08 yen from Friday's
close of 124.10 yen. The currency, which opened at 124.20 yen, moved
within a range of 123.93-124.33 yen.
   A dealer at Tokyo Bank said the dollar-yen rate today hardly
moved.
   ``The dollar slightly weakened toward the end of trading because
of position adjustment,'' but it did not lead to a strong
dollar-selling trend because ``the majority of traders are still
expecting the U.S. discount rate might be raised toward this
weekend,'' she said.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average, which lost 169.04 points
Friday, dropped an additional 66.63 points, or 0.23 percent, to
finish at 29,470.08. On Friday, the index closed at 29,536.71.
   The index rose 56.64 points in early trading but erased the gain
in directionless trading without fresh market-affecting news in
Tokyo, dealers said.
   Some market players were concerned the U.S. consumer price index
for November, due out Tuesday, might be an indicator of whether the
United States would raise its discount rate, said a trader with a
major securities firm.
   A dealer with Daiwa Securities said investors were staying on the
sidelines amid concerns over a possible hike in the U.S. discount
rate.
   Volume traded on the first section was estimated at 450 million
shares.

   A past and present prime minister and a
political newcomer were the candidates in today's election for
president, the top government job. All are members of the country's
Sinhalese ethnic majority.
   Here are brief profiles:
   Ranasinghe Premadasa _ The 64-year-old prime minister is the
candidate of the United National Party, headed by President Junius
R. Jayewardene who is barred by law from seeking a third six-year
term. Premadasa campaigned as the champion of the common man. Unlike
most top Sri Lankan politicians who come from elite castes of
society, Premadasa was born in the slums of Colombo and struggled to
the top echelons of power. First elected to Parliament in 1954, he
has been Jayewardene's prime minister for the past 10 years.
However, he has had his differences with his political mentor.
Premadasa was an outspoken critic of the 1987 peace accord
Jayewardene signed in an effort to end the insurrection by Tamil
separatists.
   Sirimavo Bandaranaike _ Head of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party, Mrs.
Bandaranaike became the world's first woman prime minister in 1960.
Although well-educated, she never sought a political role of her own
until her husband, Prime Minister S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike, was
assassinated by a Sinhalese Buddhist monk in 1959. She served as
prime minister from 1960 to 1966 and again from 1970 to 1977 at a
time when the post was still the most powerful job in government.
Now 72, she says she would not return to the stringent economic
controls and nationalization policies that led to her downfall more
than a decade ago. She also opposes the Tamil peace accord.
   Ossie Abeygoonesekera _ The 38-year-old flagbearer of the United
Socialist Alliance is relatively new in politics but used to be a
member of Mrs. Bandaranaike's party. In 1983, he helped actor Vijaya
Kumaratunga found the Sri Lanka Mahajana Party, one of four small
leftist parties comprising the alliance. Kumaratunga, husband of
Mrs. Bandaranaike's daughter, Chandrika, was assassinated early this
year by Sinhalese extremists who vowed to disrupt the elections. In
1982, Abeygoonesekera was jailed for three months when the
government accused him of conspiring to overthrow Jayewardene.

<HEAD>Vietnamese Soldiers Leave Cambodia As Part of Major Withdrawal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nearly 200 vessels carrying Vietnamese
soldiers sailed past Cambodia's capital of Phnom Penh on their way
home today as part of a major troop withdrawal, the official
Cambodian news agency reported.
   The SPK agency said about 10,000 people, including Cambodian
Communist Party officials and military officers, lined the banks of
the Mekong River to bid farewell to soldiers of Division 339.
   Red banners expressing gratitude to the soldiers were flying and
many people waved miniature Vietnamese and Cambodian flags as the
fleet passed, the agency said. An army band played songs praising
Cambodia-Vietnam friendship and hundreds of schoolchildren and other
people shouted slogans hailing the soldiers' service.
   The fleet then sailed southward for the 70-mile journey to the
border of southern Vietnam. A large group of foreign journalists
invited to watch the pullout followed in helicopters.
   The agency said Cambodians bade farewell to other departing
Vietnamese soldiers in ceremonies in Ratanakiri province in the
northeast, in Kampot province south of Phnom Penh, and in Kompong
Cham province east of the capital.
   The report monitored in Bangkok did not say how many troops were
involved in the movements.
   The largest guerrilla group, the Khmer Rouge, called the
movements mere troop rotations and said Vietnam had sent in fresh
units by land and sea.
   The departing soldiers are among the 50,000 troops that Vietnam
says are being sent home this year in its seventh annual partial
withdrawal from Cambodia. Vietnam claims to have pulled out 32,000
troops already this year, and 18,000 more are to leave by land and
water in a weeklong transfer ending Wednesday.
   Some Western diplomats in Bangkok say they believe only 15,000 to
20,000 soldiers have left this year.
   The soldiers have been fighting a largely stalemated war against
Cambodian guerrillas since massive Vietnamese divisions invaded
Cambodia on Christmas Day 1978 and installed the pro-Vietnamese
government of President Heng Samrin.
   Vietnam says it will withdraw by 1990 the 50,000 troops that it
says will remain after this week's pullout, leaving the fighting to
Heng Samrin's forces.
   Cambodia's Prime Minister Hun Sen said Friday that all Vietnamese
military and civilian advisers have already left his country.
   ``This will not affect the balance of forces on the battlefield
due to our Cambodian troops, who are in control of all areas from
which the Vietnamese have withdrawn,'' he told a news conference.
   The Khmer Rouge said Vietnamese soldiers, not those of the
Cambodian government, are engaged in ``tense, continuous fighting''
in the interior and along the western border with Thailand.
   ``They have also ordered Vietnamese aggressor troops in Cambodia
to disguise as Cambodian puppet soldiers,'' it said in a radio
broadcast Sunday. The text was seen today. ``They have hidden these
important combined units in areas that are inaccessible to
foreigners and far from populated areas and strategic roads.''
   Claims by the communist Khmer Rouge, which massacred hundreds of
thousands of people when it ruled Cambodia until Vietnam's invasion,
are widely regarded as exaggerated.

<HEAD>A Small Private Plane Did Not Crash Into The Seine</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For a while this morning, it looked like the end of
the ``Black Baron,'' the mysterious pilot or pilots who have from
time to time flown illegally over Paris in small aircraft, violating
the prohibition on low-level flights over the capital.
   Responding to urgent telephone calls from ``witnesses,'' police
divers rushed to the scene and recovered the tail of an airplane
from the Seine River in southwest Paris. But that's all there was.
Only a tail. No body. From a plane that crashed two years ago. A
hoax.
   The joke had officials running for several hours.
   The first call came about 3:30 a.m. from a person who told police
that an aircraft was making low-level flights over the 15th and 16th
districts of Paris on the south and west side. A series of similar
calls were received by several police and security agencies.
   About 5:30, a ``witness'' reported he saw the wreckage of an
airplane in the river between the Sevres and Boulogne bridges.
   Several rescue teams were dispatched to the area. Divers pulled
the tail of a plane from the water, but found nothing else.
   The tail of the plane showed signs of rust. After checking the
identifying letters, GDPK, authorities discovered it belonged to an
aircraft that crashed Aug. 28, 1987 west of Paris.
   Police, recognizing they had been had, say the tail of the plane
obviously was thrown into the river by pranksters.

   Temperatures plunged below freezing across northern Florida early
today and snow was scattered in parts of the Great Lakes and the
mountains of the West.
   A hard freeze warning was posted for extreme northwest Florida
and a warning for freezing temperatures was extended over the rest
of the state's northern and central regions.
   At midnight Sunday, the temperature had dropped to 22 degrees at
Tallahassee, while Jacksonville reported 28 and Daytona Beach had a
reading of 31. In contrast, Havre, Mont., posted a relatively balmy
40 degrees.
   In the Great Lakes area, snow was falling early today from
Pennsylvania across western New York state and over the northeast
portion of Lower Michigan. A snow advisory was in effect for parts
of northwest New York, where northerly winds were expected to
produce more squalls.
   A winter storm watch was posted for northwest and north-central
Upper Michigan, where strong northerly winds could produce locally
heavy snow southeast of Lake Superior.
   Snow was falling on the mountains of northern Arizona and
southern Utah, and snow advisories were in effect for those areas as
well as the mountains of north-central New Mexico and southern
Colorado. There was some scattered rain in southern New Mexico.
   In the Northwest, snow in eastern Washington state changed to
rain at lower elevations of the state's central and western regions
and along the Oregon coast.
   A high wind watch was posted for eastern Wyoming.
   Today's forecast called for scattered snow from the mountains of
Arizona across the Rockies to the upper Missouri Valley. Strong,
gusty winds were forecast for the central Rockies and middle
Mississippi Valley.
   Highs were expected to be in the teens and 20s over northern New
England, northeast New York state and Upper Michigan; in the 30s and
40s from the remainder of New England to eastern Virginia, over the
rest of the Great Lakes and the lower Ohio Valley, the upper
Mississippi Valley, much of the northern Plains, the Rockies, the
Plateau and the northern Pacific Coast; and in the low 70s in
soutern Florida and much of Texas. Highs elsewhere generally were
predicted to be in the 50s and 60s.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 a.m. EST ranged from 6
degrees below zero at Houlton, Maine, to 57 degrees at the Naval Air
Station near Corpus Christi, Texas.

   Deposed Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos,
who contends he is too ill to travel for arraignment on racketeering
charges, will remain under round-the-clock care for congestive heart
failure, his doctors said.
   An ambulance took Marcos home Sunday from the hospital, where his
doctors said medication and rest had controlled the life-threatening
ailment.
   A court-appointed doctor concluded in late October that Marcos
was well enough to travel. It was not known whether Marcos'
hospitalization would affect a court order requiring a trip to New
York for an arraignment.
   Asked Sunday if the court would order another examination because
of Marcos' hospitalization, a spokesman for U.S. Attorney Rudolph
Giuliani's office in New York said that he would have no comment.
   Marcos left St. Francis Medical Center in a stretcher Sunday
afternoon. He didn't acknowledge reporters' questions as he was
wheeled to an ambulance.
   Doctors said Marcos' health had improved since he was admitted to
the hospital Dec. 9, but his heart condition would require a
doctor's supervision.
   ``Initially congestive heart failure is life-threatening, but his
condition has stabilized,'' said Dr. Calvin Wong, Marcos'
cardiologist. ``His congestive heart failure has reversed itself. It
could recur.''
   Wong said Marcos has a history of congestive heart failure, which
means the heart is unable to pump the amount of blood required by
the body.
   ``The president is going home where we have set up a hospital
setup,'' said Dr. Azucena Ignacio, one of Marcos' private physicians.
   Wong said he did not know the prognosis for Marcos. Test results
won't be known for several days, he said.
   Neither doctor would comment on whether Marcos is too ill to
travel to New York for the court appearance.
   Imelda Marcos accompanied her husband to the ambulance, then
climbed into the front seat of the vehicle for the two-mile trip to
the couple's home overlooking Honolulu.
   Marcos has lived in Honolulu since his ouster in a February 1986
civilian-military revolt. He and his wife were indicted in New York,
accused of plundering their homeland's economy and stashing millions
in the United States. Mrs. Marcos pleaded innocent to the charges.
   Attorney John Bartko said Marcos' legal team retained three
physicians to examine Marcos and review the results of his
hospitalization. He declined to name the doctors.
   The doctors' findings were expected to prove to a U.S. District
Court judge in New York that Marcos is too ill to travel, Bartko
said Saturday.
   A New York cardiologist who examined Marcos before his most
recent hospitalization told a federal judge in New York that
although the former president suffers from various ailments, he is
well enough to travel. Marcos repeatedly faked pain during the
three-hour examination, according to the doctor, Francis M. Weld.

<TEXT>
   Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres indicated
Israel would not exclude Palestine Liberation Organization chairman
Yasser Arafat from future peace talks provided PLO declarations
renouncing terrorism prove true.
   Peres did not name Arafat in a television interview Sunday, but
said Israel was prepared to talk with ``every Palestinian, no matter
what his biography was, if he is not shooting and killing.''
   He said Israel will wait ``a month, a couple of months,'' to see
if terrorism, including uprisings in the occupied territories, ends.
   Israeli officials have denounced the United States decision last
week to hold a ``substantive dialogue'' with the PLO, strongly
condemning a move that grants diplomatic credibility to a man
Israelis accuse of masterminding a campaign of terror against the
Jewish state.
   Terrorism played a large role in the first talks U.S. and PLO
officials held in Tunis last week. The session took place after
Arafat last week met American conditions that included recognition
of Israel's right to exist and renunciation of terrorism.
   Peres, in the interview on CBS-TV's ``Face the Nation,'' appeared
to step back from Israel's refusal to take part in talks that
include Arafat.
   He linked such negotiations, however, to an end to violence in
the occupied territories. Arafat, in speaking against terrorism, has
not included the stone-throwing and other acts carried out by
Palestinians under Israeli rule.
   So far, 332 Palestinians have died in the year-old clashes with
Israeli soldiers, including three who were killed today.
   And despite the movement towards peace talks, statements from
other PLO officials indicated violence was far from a thing of the
past.
   Salah Khalaf, second in command Arafat in Fatah, the largest PLO
group, meanwhile, told an Abu Dhabi news conference that Arafat's
denunciation of terrorism last week ``did not include military
attacks against Israel.''
   ``Our struggle will continue until we raise the Palestinian flag
over Jerusalem,'' he said.
   Peres said in the television interview, ``I shall say, very
clearly, I am ready to sit with every Palestinian who is not engaged
in terror, who is seeking peace and who wants to negotiate the
peaceful solution with Israel.''
   Asked whether that included sitting down with Arafat, he said,
``I am not ready to refer to a single person because I don't think
that's the issue. But I am saying, in a very clear way, with every
Palestinian, no matter what his biography used to be.''
   Peres added he has ``doubts about Mr. Arafat.'' But he said, ``I
am ready to sit with every Palestinian, no matter what his biography
was ...''
   ``If Mr. Arafat says, `I'm going to stop violence and terror,'
okay, let's wait a month, a couple of months and see if this is
really going to happen,'' Peres said.
   It was unclear from the comments whether that view would carry
over into a new Israeli government.
   Talks between Peres' Labor Alignment and Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir's Likud Bloc over a new government have broken down, leaving
Shamir aides talking about forming a new governing coalition with
ultra-orthodox Jewish parties.

   Here are some facts and figures about Sri Lanka:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   LAND _ Sri Lanka is an island of 25,332 square miles, about the
size of West Virginia, off India's southern coast. It was known as
Ceylon until 1972 and Arab traders of long ago called it Serendip,
or the Land of Pleasant Surprises. Sri Lanka means ``bountiful
island' in the Sinhala language.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   PEOPLE _ The breakdown of the island's 16 million population is:
75 percent Sinhalese, 18 percent Tamil, 7 percent Moslem and a few
descendants of European settlers. The Sinhalese, who are
predominantly Buddhist, and Tamils, most of whom are Hindu, came
from India centuries ago across the narrow Palk Strait.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   HISTORY _ Since ancient times, the island was invaded by the
armies of Indian kings. The Portuguese colonized it in the 16th
century, the Dutch ruled in the 17th century and the British were in
control from about 1800 until independence in 1948.
   Battles between Sinhalese and Tamils are rooted in Sri Lanka's
history, but the basis for the current civil war was laid by British
encouragment of minority Tamils in education and jobs under the
``divide and rule'' policy.
   After independence, the Sinhalese tried to contain Tamil
influence. A law passed in 1956 declared Sinhala as the official
language.
   Tamil riots began and resentment grew of Sinhalese dominance in
government, the military and education. The problem was excerbated
by the religious difference. The civil war began when Tamil rebels
killed 13 Sri Lankan soldiers in 1983, setting off riots in which
more than 1,000 Tamil civilians were killed.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ECONOMY _ Before the ethnic war began, Sri Lanka was a model
Third World developing country. Its economy grew an average of 7
percent a year, and tea exports, spices and tourism were mainstays.
Economic growth last year fell to less than 1.5 percent, and tourism
has dropped to a fraction of the 250,000 people who visited annually
in pre-war years.
   Per capita income is about $380 a year.

<HEAD>Man Arrested After Guns Wrapped In Christmas Paper Found In
Suitcase</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The two Uzi submachine guns were gift-wrapped in
Christmas paper, but police think a man arrested at O'Hare
International Airport didn't intend them as holiday presents for his
family in the Philippines.
   Lamberto Camacho, 44, an automotive lab technician from Ohio, is
believed to have been running guns part-time to the Philippines,
authorities said.
   Police said the arrest occurred Sunday as Camacho prepared to put
his wife and two children on a Northwest Airlines jet bound for
Manila. The weapons were found in the family's checked baggage after
a routine X-ray detected an Uzi wrapped in clothes in one suitcase.
   Camacho has been charged with unlawful use of a weapon and
attempting to board an airplane with weapons, and faced arraignment
on federal charges today, said Police Sgt. John Fanning.
   Authorities who arrested Camacho also seized seven handguns, plus
spare parts and clips for several more, said Patrolman Edward
Riordan.
   Riordan said police found six .357-caliber Magnum revolvers in
the false bottom of a cardboard box Camacho was allegedly sending
back to the Philippines. Authorities also found a .45-caliber
automatic hidden inside a microwave oven in another box, Riordon
said.
   ``We think this guy is a part-time gunrunner,'' Fanning said.
``He told us the extra parts were for weapons that already had gone
through previously.''
   ``Apparently, there's a lot of money to be made running guns into
a place where there's political unrest,'' Fanning added.
   Fanning said Camacho, of Defiance, Ohio, works as a lab
technician for General Motors Corp.
   Camacho was interviewed by the FBI, and investigators from both
the Federal Aviation Administration and the U.S. Customs Service.
   Riordan said Camacho was later taken to the Metropolitan
Correctional Center, a federal prison in downtown Chicago.

<TEXT>
   A group of homosexual Roman Catholics and
their supporters sang songs and prayed during a march to protest
their eviction from the last parish church in a major U.S. city in
which they were allowed to meet.
   Holding hands, singing traditional church hymns and carrying
crosses and lighted candles, about 500 people marched a mile from
St. Boniface Church after an ``exodus service'' to St. Mary's
Cathedral on Sunday night.
   ``The church has been my father, my family, for much of my life,
particularly after my physical family rejected me for being gay,''
said sobbing marcher Jeff Koerner, 31. ``Now I'm doubly an orphan.''
   Leaders of Dignity _ a 20-year-old organization of homosexual
Catholics with 100 chapters and 5,000 members nationwide _ portrayed
their eviction as a gift from God. It was brought about by their
refusal to endorse church teaching that homosexuality is immoral.
   Jim Lonergan of Dignity told the congregation ``to stay would
have meant for us to accept self-hatred and self-doubt.''
   The local Dignity branch had sponsored a Mass at St. Boniface for
15 years, but Archbishop John R. Quinn on Dec. 3 banned the group
from all church property after Sunday.
   Quinn said a special Mass at St. Mary's Cathedral on Sunday
evenings would be offered as an alternative for the Dignity branch's
350 regular members.
   Catholic officials across the country have ousted Dignity groups
from parish churches in nearly 40 cities during the last two years
because of the 1986 reaffirmation by the Vatican that homosexuality
is an ``intrinsic evil'' and is incompatible with Catholic dogma.
   At the final St. Boniface service, the Rev. Bob Arpin, who has
AIDS, said the ouster challenged the group to accept persecution as
Christ did.
   ``To us, God is giving the holy task for being in this world
filled with hatred, prejudice and death to teach the world to love
again,'' Arpin said. ``We, whose love we are told is perverted.''
   To cheers and applause, Arpin told the crowd it was sending ``a
clear message to the church in Rome: Like us or not, we are your
sons and daughters, your priests and nuns, your faithful ones. We
are the church.''
   By sponsoring its own Mass, Dignity was able to get priests to
give talks reflecting its views, not necessarily the church's, on
homosexuality and other issues.
   Monsignor Patrick J. O'Shea, a spokesman for Quinn, said San
Francisco's Dignity was the group's last branch in a major American
city that was still being allowed to use church facilities. Dignity
services are being held in churches in a few small cities in United
States, but neither the church nor Dignity would identify them.

<HEAD>Thorny Border Issue Dominates Talks</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: CORRECTS spelling of New Delhi in grafs 3,5</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi of India and Chinese
leaders spent most of their time together today discussing their
troubled border, the main issue dividing the world's most populous
nations, Indian journalists said.
   Gandhi also discussed Tibet and trade with his Chinese hosts.
   Gandhi and China's premier, Li Peng, met for two hours in the
morning following Gandhi's arrival from New Delhi. They continued
meetings after lunch, said the journalists who attended a news
briefing closed to non-Indian reporters.
   Gandhi's five-day visit marks the first time an Indian leader has
come to China since 1954, when his grandfather Jawalharlal Nehru
came to Beijing.
   The last time Chinese and Indian leaders met was in 1960, when
Premier Chou Enlai went to New Delhi. Two years later, India and
China fought a war over the border and China occupied a large chunk
of Indian territory.
   Gandhi flew into Beijing accompanied by about 100 top officials
and the two nations were expected to sign agreements on civil
aviation, border trade and science and technology.
   Consular offices in Shanghai and Bombay may also be established.
   Little progress was expected on the 2,400-mile border.
   China's Xinhua News Agency and Indian journalists said Gandhi and
Li agreed that the two nations had to find a way of settling the
border question peacefully.
   ``We should work now toward resolution of the border issue while
we work at the same time to expand and strengthen our bilateral
relations,'' the journalists quoted Gandhi as saying.
   Li said the border problem was hindering the two countries'
relations, Xinhua reported.
   Xinhua also said Li expressed ``admiration'' for India's position
on Tibet, a Chinese province bordering India.
   India has reiterated that Tibet is part of China and forbids
Tibetan refugees in India from engaging in political activities. In
1959, the Dalai Lama, Tibet's leader, and thousands of Tibetan
refugees fled to India after an abortive, anti-Chinese uprising.
   On Dec. 10, at least one monk was killed in the Tibetan capital
of Lhasa during a clash between Chinese troops and Tibetans who seek
an end to 38 years of Chinese rule. It was the third bloody clash in
Lhasa in 14 months.
   Earlier Monday, at the Great Hall of the People in downtown
Beijing, Gandhi was given a 19-gun salute and met by Premier LI.
   Indian and Chinese flags lined Tiananmen Square, colored flags
lined the city's main boulevard, Changanjie.
   India was one of the first non-socialist countries to recognize
Communist China soon after Beijing's 1949 revolution. In the early
1960s, relations deteriorated over the border question and personal
and political disagreements between Chinese leader Mao Tse-tung and
Prime Minister Nehru.
   China now claims 36,000 square miles of Indian land. India
rejects the claim and demands that China return the 15,200 square
miles it took in the war.
   In the late 1970s, relations improved slightly when China began
emphasizing traditional state-to-state relations instead of
exporting socialist revolution.
   Direct trade resumed in 1977 but it amounted to just $150 million
in 1986-87 with few prospects for growth.
   The two countries began border talks in 1981 but have made little
progress in eight rounds.
   Interviews with Chinese scholars over the weekend found them
pessimistic about the possibility for good Sino-Indian ties. For
one, they said, the economies of the two countries are too similar
to allow for much trade.
   ``They export textiles and we export textiles. They want high
technology and we want high technology,'' said Zhang Minqiu, deputy
director of the Institute of South and Southeast Asian Studies at
Beijing University. ``We're competitors so we lack cooperative
spirit.''
   In addition, Chinese researchers said the border question appears
intractable.
   ``In some of the areas that we claim, the Indian government has
made big investments and has registered good economic growth,'' said
Ms. Zhang. ``It's very hard to see them giving it up.''

   A teacher who disarmed a student
accused of killing one teacher and wounding another said he thought
it was a prank when he first saw the teen-ager wielding a
semiautomatic handgun.
   ``I thought it might be one of those Uzi-type water pistols,'' M.
Hutchins Matteson said. ``Then the glass was shot out and I knew it
was a reality.''
   Nicholas Elliott, 16, allegedly shot the window out of a locked
classroom door at Atlantic Shores Christian School in an effort to
reach a student he wanted to kill.
   ``My original thought was, `Oh my God, I'm going to be shot,''
Matteson said about the Friday incident. ``Then I remembered I had
38 students in there.''
   So Matteson stretched his arms in an effort to shield as many
students as possible while pleading with the teen-ager not to shoot.
   ``I cried out to him, `No, no, don't do it. This is no way.
Please don't do this,''' Matteson said.
   Police say Elliott fired two shots, including one that narrowly
missed Matteson, before his Cabray M-11 pistol jammed. Matteson
tackled Elliott and held him down while student Mark McNulty grabbed
the gun, a cheap imitation of a combat assault weapon.
   ``I've never been in a situation where I had to fight for my
life,'' said Matteson, 24. ``I thank God for giving me the presence
of mind and the physical ability to get the job done.''
   Police say that by the time Elliott reached Matteson's Bible
class, he already had killed Karen H. Farley, 40, and wounded Samuel
M. Marino, 37. Marino was in stable condition at Sentara Norfolk
General Hospital.
   Investigators said Elliott had gone to Ms. Farley's and Marino's
classrooms in search of a student who had been tormenting him.
   ``I think it's a classic case of the school bully vs. a meek and
mild kid and the boy finally got fed up with it and just snapped,''
a Virginia Beach detective told The Virginian-Pilot and The
Ledger-Star.
   The newspaper reported Sunday that authorities were saying
privately that racial insults may have ignited the boy's anger.
Elliott is one of four blacks in the student body of 510.
   Principal Fred Fuller said he was unaware of any racial friction,
but he could not rule it out. ``Let's face it, we're dealing with
kids and sometimes they go at it,'' Fuller said.
   Police were at a loss to explain why the student shot Ms. Farley,
who was alone in her portable classroom.
   Authorities said that moments after that shooting, the youth went
to Marino's classroom about 50 feet away and showed him the pistol.
Marino told the boy it was against the rules to bring a gun to
school and asked for the weapon before being shot in the shoulder.
   Elliott is being held on charges of first-degree murder,
attempted murder, malicious assault, use of a firearm in a felony
and firing into an occupied building.
   Relatives and friends have described Elliott as a quiet loner
with an affinity for guns. He spent most of his time playing with
his pet pigeon, watching television and reading gun magazines.

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 100 activists, from farmers to
artists, have joined forces to create a united voice for the
mainstream opposition and say their first goal is legalization of
Solidarity.
   Lech Walesa, chairman of the free trade union movement, convened
the group Sunday. Previously, it had been an informal council that
Walesa had gathered five times since May 1987 to make broad policy
statements on the behalf of the opposition.
   The so-called Citizens Committee, comprising 128 intellectuals,
Solidarity supporters, opposition activists, farmers and artists, is
intended to bring together disparate elements in a united voice of
opposition.
   The participants have in common a willingness to negotiate with
the government. Groups such as the Confederation for an Independent
Poland, which urge independence and the removal of the communist
system, were not included.
   Government-controlled radio and television reported the formation
of the Citizens Committee, signaling at least tacit acceptance of
the organization.
   In its first statement, the group said Solidarity's reinstatement
is ``of crucial importance. ... Without such a decision a sufficient
and credible structure for reform will not be created.''
   The committee will meet four times a year and establish 15
commissions to examine specific social needs and suggest solutions,
leaders said after a daylong conference in Warsaw. Incorporated into
the structure are commissions of opposition experts who have been
preparing, at Walesa's request, to take part in talks with the
government.
   Still, there are no new signs when those talks might take place,
said Andrzej Wielowieyski, an adviser to Walesa who spoke for the
committee.
   Communist authorities promised negotiations with the opposition
as a condition for Walesa's help in ending a wave of strikes in
August, but they have repeatedly delayed the talks.
   Wielowieyski said members of the group see the talks as only one
means for beginning dialogue with the government. He said the
dialogue could take other forms, through the commissions.
   The commissions were organized for various topics. Among them:
political and economic reform, education, housing, national
minorities, culture, youth and ecology.
   Walesa has confirmed continuing low-level contacts between the
opposition and authorities in recent weeks, but would say nothing
about the content of the discussions.
   On the surface, relations between Walesa and the authorities have
never been so cordial since Solidarity was crushed in a 1981
military crackdown and outlawed the following year.
   In the past month, Walesa has been allowed to speak his mind
without censorship in a national television debate, was permitted
his first foreign trip since Solidarity's heyday and has seen his
public statements and activities broadcast and even praised in the
official media nearly every day.
   On Thursday, Walesa said recent remarks by government spokesman
Jerzy Urban have come ``very close'' to Solidarity's demand for a
statement of intent to reinstate the organizaton.
   Solidarity has asked for such a declaration as a condition for
starting formal talks with authorities on tackling Poland's daunting
social and economic problems.

<HEAD>Dollar Falls in Light Trading, Gold Slightly Higher</HEAD>

   The dollar fell against all major currencies except
the French franc in European trading this morning as volume began to
decline ahead of the Christmas holidays.
   Gold prices were slightly higher in quiet trading.
   ``We are getting well into the pre-Christmas session,'' said a
trader at a major West German bank in Frankfurt. ``The turnover is
dwindling and the trading interest is even lower than last week.''
   Traders said the dollar drifted lower in Asian trading but there
wasn't any push to sharply lower levels. They said central banks
have stayed out of the market and weren't expected to intervene
today.
   Foreign exchange dealers in Milan said they believed the U.S.
Federal Reserve Board eventually would have to increase the discount
rate, the interest rate it charges on loans to commercial banks. But
they added that the increase probably wouldn't come until next year.
   ``The Fed probably won't move before the New Year. But I still
see it hiking the discount rate up in the next few weeks,'' said one
trader in Milan with a major Italian commercial bank.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar fell 0.08 yen to a closing 124.02 yen. Later, in London,
it was quoted at a higher rate of 124.15 yen.
   Other dollar rates at mid-morning, compared with late Friday:
   _1.7545 West German marks, down from 1.7635
   _1.4825 Swiss francs, down from 1.4895
   _6.0070 French francs, up from 5.9950
   _1.9796 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9805
   _1,294.90 Italian lire, down from 1,296.50
   _1.2018 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2035
   In London, the British pound rose to $1.8230, compared with
$1.8150 late Friday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $414.00 a troy ounce and
at midmorning, the city's five major bullion dealers fixed a
recommended price of $413.65. Both were up from $412.25 bid late
Friday.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $413.90, up from $412.25 bid late

<HEAD>Reports Say President Under Arrest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PORT VILA, Vanuatu (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The president of this South Pacific
nation was under arrest today following his attempt to replace the
prime minister with his nephew and dissolve Parliament, state-run
radio said.
   Soldiers manned roadblocks in the capital of 22,000 and liquor
sales were banned to prevent violence following the political
crisis, Australian Associated Press reported.
   AAP quoted police in Vanuatu as denying reports that President
George Solomanu was under arrest.
   The Associated Press made several attempts to contact officials
in Vanuatu, 1,200 miles east of Australia, but all calls went
unanswered or failed to connect.
   AAP also reported that the Supreme Court today ruled that
Sokomanu had violated the constitution on Friday when he announced
he had disbanded the 46-member Parliament and dismissed the elected
prime minister, Walter Lini.
   On Sunday, Sokomanu swore in his nephew, Barak Sope, and
appointed an interim government pending national elections in
February.
   Lini, the prime minister since independence in 1980, has been
locked in a yearlong power struggle with Sope. Lini and other
Parliament members refused to accept the president's action, and
Lini had Sope and his followers arrested.
   Radio reports monitored in Sydney indicated a total of 16
politicians were under arrest.
   Deputy Police Commissioner Harold Thompson told AAP that Sope and
others would be charged Tuesday.
   ``They will include unlawful assembly,'' he told AAP in an
interview. ``We are also looking at intention to overthrow the
present (Lini) government...that's a treason charge.''
   Lini called on Sokomanu to resign. Under Vanuatu's constitution
the president can only be removed on the vote of an electoral
college made up of politicians and regional leaders.
   Sokomanu, in an interview today with an Australian radio station,
admitted his action was unconstitutional.
   ``I believe I took the correct action although it was against the
constitution,'' he told the Australian Broadcasting Corp. ``I put it
his way, why should I wait for the advice of the government when I
know that things are not really going well.''
   Sope and Lini, who helped found the republic of Vanuatu in 1980
from the former Anglo-French New Hebrides, have been fighting for
control of the government for a year. The islands have a population
of about 130,000.
   Sokomanu dismissed Lini and dissolved Parliament after
by-elections last week that gave Lini's governing Vanu'aku party
two-thirds control of the 46-seat Parliament. The opposition
boycotted the vote, and Sokomanu said the Parliament was
unconstitutional because no opposition candidates were put up for
election.
   In Australia, Foreign Minister Gareth Evans said his government
had contigency plans prepared to evacuate about 400 Australian
tourists from Vanuatu if the situation there deterioriated.
   Evans described the events in Vanuatu as a ``political brawl.''
   ``Our view is there is no reason for concern,'' Evans told the
federal parliament in Canberra.

   A man being chased by police tossed a paper bag
containing almost $68,000 into an incinerator chute early today _
then insisted that the money wasn't his, authorities said.
   Two officers in the University Heights section of Manhattan saw a
taxi heading the wrong way down a street at about 12:30 a.m. and,
fearing the driver was being robbed, tried to stop the cab, said
police Sgt. Edward Burns.
   A passenger carrying a paper bag bolted out of the cab's back
seat with the officers in pursuit, Burns said.
   The man threw the bag into a first floor incinerator chute _ and
when the officers retrieved it, they found $67,900 in cash inside,
he said.
   Miguel Cedeno, 21, claimed the money was not his, and was not
charged with any crime, Burns said.
   ``He disclaimed any ownership of it,'' Burns said. ``If he claims
it's not his, he doesn't have to tell you where he got it.''

<TEXT>
   A cracked pipe at one of the Savannah River
Plant's nuclear reactors will be replaced before the reactor is
allowed to restart, U.S. Energy Department officials said.
   Len Sjostrom, the Department of Energy's acting assistant manager
for reactor operations, said replacing the pipe would not delay the
restart scheduled for this summer ``because we have the time to do
it ... and especially because it's a smaller pipe.''
   All three SRP reactors have been shut down since summer for
safety improvements and maintenance. They are the nation's only
source of tritium, a radioactive gas used to boost the power of
nuclear weapons.
   Because tritium decays 5.5 percent annually, some federal
officials say the nation could face forced reductions in nuclear
weapons unless the reactors are restarted soon.
   Sjostrom said the crack in the 4-inch pipe occurred in an area
where two pipes join, the Augusta (Ga.) Chronicle reported in
Sunday's editions.
   The pipe supplies cooling water to reactor control rods which are
raised and lowered within the reactor vessel to control the fission
process.
   Sjostrom said the crack was detected Friday by ultrasonic tests
during a routine check of the reactor's piping.
   In Washington, Richard W. Starostecki, the Energy Department's
deputy assistant secretary for safety, health and quality assurance,
said he was sending a team of experts to the weapons plant next week
to assess the situation, The New York Times reported in Sunday's
editions.

<HEAD>Eight Miami Cops Suspended Following Beating Death of Suspect</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three Miami narcotics detectives suspended following
the fatal beating of a suspected drug dealer were on a police
department list of officers frequently involved in violent arrests,
according to a report published today.
   Detectives Pablo Camacho, Ronald Sinclair and Nathaniel Veal Jr.
were named in a July 1988 ``Early Warning System'' memo, which lists
officers who have five or more extraordinarily violent arrests in
two years, The Miami Herald reported.
   The men were among eight taken off duty with pay during the
investigation of the beating death of Leonardo ``Cano'' Mercado,
police said.
   Camacho, whose eight ``Early Warning'' incidents was the second
highest of the 22 officers on the list, had reputedly been targeted
for assassination under a contract taken out by Mercado, police said.
   Miami Police Chief Perry Anderson promised a swift investigation
of the Friday evening beating.
   ``There are serious issues that must be investigated,'' Anderson
said at a news conference Sunday. ``I don't know how to express to
you how we feel, how my administration feels. We are really saddened
by this incident.''
   Mercado, 35, died just days after Miami police received an
anonymous tip that he had put out a murder contract on Camacho.
   ``This thing was just a frenzy,'' said Sgt. David Rivero, a
police spokesman. He said Mercado died of internal bleeding caused
by ``blunt trauma to the torso.''
   Charges against the officers could include murder, he said.
   Six undercover officers, all members of a special unit set up to
fight street drug sales, confronted Mercado outside a relative's
home while on duty Friday, police said.
   Witnesses said the officers took Mercado inside his relative's
home, shut the door and pulled a curtain closed. The officers didn't
have an arrest warrant, police said.
   Mercado died Friday night at Jackson Memorial Hospital. Rivero
said the department decided to suspend the six officers and two
supervisors after an autopsy Saturday.
   On Friday, police had said Mercado was injured in a struggle that
broke out when three officers approached him for questioning and he
ran into the house and tried to grab a knife. On Saturday, Rivero
said a knife had been found, but he could not say whether Mercado
had brandished it.
   Police records show that from 1980 to 1988, Mercado was arrested
16 times on charges including drug offenses, assault and attempted
murder, but the outcome of the charges was not immediately known.
   Also relieved of duty were Detectives Andy Watson, Tommy Trujillo
and Charlie Haynes, all of whom were at the scene Friday, police
said.
   The drug squad's leader, Lt. Michael Christopher, and Sgt. Manuel
Orosa were suspended and accused of failing to protect a crime scene
and allowing key witnesses _ the six detectives _ to leave the scene.

<HEAD>Two Blasts Tear Through Immigrant Workers' Residence</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: UPDATES throuhgout with details. No pickup.</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   CAGNES-SUR-MER, France (AP) _ Two explosions ripped through a
four-story residence for immigrant workers in this Mediterranean
town early today, killing one person, injuring a dozen and seriously
damaging the building, police said.
   There was no immediate claim of responsibility. The anti-racism
organization SOS-Racism, issued a statement saying it was ``deeply
shocked and indignant over this murderous attack.''
   The first blast pulverized a car parked at the entrance of the
building, which housed 97 people, mostly North African immigrants.
   Pieces of the car were thrown as far as 300 feet away and the
concussion broke windows in area buildings. Four other cars also
were destroyed and numerous vehicles damaged.
   Residents of the building were evacuating rapidly when a second
explosion occurred in the stairwell, police said.
   ``We were drinking coffee with a colleague when the explosion
blew out the door and all of the windows,'' said an employee of a
transportation company next door to the residence. ``We ran outside
and we saw that terrified residents of the center wanted to jump
from the windows.
   ``We shouted to them to remain in the building and we approached
it to help them. It was at that moment that the second explosion
happened. I was thrown 10 meters and my colleague was hit full in
the head by a piece of flying metal.''
   The dead man was identified as Georghe Yordachescu, 50, a
Romanian immigrant who worked as a delivery driver and had lived at
the residence for about four years.
   Six of the injured required hospitalization and were taken to
facilities in Cagnes or nearby Antibes.
   Cagnes-sur-Mer is about six miles west of Nice on the French
Riviera.
   The ground floor of the building suffered severe damage. Dozens
of rooms were devastated and enormous pieces of concrete were thrown
in all directions just as residents were fleeing the building.
   Some of the injured suffered broken bones and cuts. Some had
jumped from the windows.
   After an initial panic, the surviving residents regrouped around
a fire built in front of the building.
   ``We never received any threats,'' one of them said. ``Everything
was just fine at the center. We don't understand this attack.
   The prefect, or local governor, of the area, Jean-Pierre Pensa,
and Suzanne Sauvaigo, mayor of Cagnes-sur-Mer, went to the scene to
begin arranging emergency measures to house the survivors.

   An 11-year-old Palestinian boy died today from
head injuries that his family says he suffered when he was pushed
from a military jeep in the occupied West Bank, Arab hospital
officials said.
   An army spokesman said he was checking the report, but he said an
earlier investigation found no evidence the child was taken away by
soldiers in a jeep.
   Palestinians shut shops and schools on the third day of a general
strike throughout the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   At least eight towns and refugee camps that were the scenes of
violence Sunday were under curfew, Arab news reports said.
   Palestinian doctors said Badr Karada of Nablus died at east
Jerusalem's Mukassad Hospital from injuries to the head suffered
Dec. 10. They said relatives told them he was pushed from a military
jeep after being detained by troops.
   In Austria, PLO chief Yasser Arafat said today the yearlong
uprising in the occupied territories will continue, but he said he
wants U.N. help in drawing Israel into a Middle East peace
conference.
   His visit was seen as part of his campaign to drum up
international backing for a Mideast peace conference under U.N.
auspices.
   A total of 332 Palestinians have died in the uprising. Thirteen
Israelis have been killed.
   Left-wing Israelis announced they formed a human rights group to
monitor abuses in the occupied territories. The group was named
Betzelim, ``Image'' in English.
   ``We formed the group to save the human image of Israel, that's
why we chose this name,'' Roni Tamor, one of the founders, said in
an interview.
   She said the organization of about 60 leftist authors,
journalists and lawyers would collect affidavits and statements
about abuses, as well as lobby Parliament about human rights
violations.
   The attorney general ordered an investigation into a complaint by
two brothers from the West Bank town of Taibe who claimed they were
severely beaten by agents of the Shin Bet security service, the
Maariv daily reported.
   Abed El Nasser Jabli and Abed El Khaim Jabli said they were
beaten while detained on charges of illegal possession of weapons,
the newspaper reported.
   The strike paralyzed public transportation and commerce in major
towns and cities throughout the occupied territories. Most schools
were reported closed, and some youths were seen persuading other
students to boycott classes.
   The three-day strike was called by leaders of the Palestinian
rebellion after soldiers fatally shot five Arabs in the West Bank
city of Nablus on Friday, one of the bloodiest days of the uprising.
   The army commander in charge of the West Bank defended the troops
for opening fire on protesters in Nablus.
   ``The troops were caught in ambushes of masked youths throwing
rocks and they were forced to open fire to protect themselves and
carry out their mission,'' said Maj. Gen. Amram Mitzna.
   ``There may be some who think it is legitimate to throw rocks,
but wheover takes upon himself to attack Israeli troops should not
be surprised to get hurt,'' he said.
   Also today, a group of Jewish settlers staged a sit-in outside
the military government headquarters in the West Bank city of
Qalqilya to protest numerous stoning attacks on Israeli vehicles in
the area, Israeli radio stations reported.
   Soldiers blocked some of the settlers from entering Qalqilya, a
city of 40,000 that was under curfew, and detained 15 settlers, army
radio reported.

   An apologetic man hijacked a limousine carrying a
bride-to-be and her bridesmaids, but got the crying women to the
church on time before he fled in the expensive car.
   ``When you get married you can never predict what's going to
happen,'' said the Rev. William Devine, who married Sharon McEachern
and Timothy Moccia at St. Mark's Church on Saturday, ``and today's
events were a good indication of that.''
   Police made no arrests, but they should be helped by a photograph
one the the bridesmaids took of the thief just before he fled.
   The bride-to-be, two of her bridesmaids, her maid of honor and a
friend from Florida arrived at St. Mark's a little early for the
ceremony, so Devine suggested a short ride in the limousine.
   Along the way, Ms. McEachern asked the chauffeur, William Spitz,
to stop and buy her a soft drink. When Spitz went into a convenience
store, a man jumped in the car and drove off.
   ``He just said, `Excuse me, girls, but I need this car,''' said
Lisa Ferguson, the friend from Florida. ``He kept apologizing, but
he said he had to get away from police.''
   The women, crying and upset, persuaded the hijacker to drop them
off at the church, which he did, but not before taking $20 and a
personal check for $25 from them. Ferguson snapped his picture as
she left the limousine.
   For the ride to the reception, police offered their services,
carrying the wedding party to suburban Quincy in their patrol cars.
   ``The bandit got them to the church on time, but the police got
them to the reception on time,'' said Detective Walter Fahey.

   An army helicopter searching for a
deserter crashed in the Andean foothills in southern Chile, killing
three officers, newspapers said today.
   Santiago newspapers cited unofficial sources as saying a colonel,
a major and a captain aboard the aircraft were killed when it
crashed on Sunday. A fourth occupant, an army mechanic, survived the
accident and was hospitalized in serious condition, the reports said.
   According to the reports, the helicopter, a French-made Lama, was
involved in a manhunt for a deserter from the army's 26th Regiment
based near the city of Coyhaique, about 1,300 miles south of
Santiago. The deserter reportedly was armed with an automatic rifle
and hand grenades
   Although no official army version of the crash was released, the
reports blamed the crash on heavy winds.
   Also on Sunday, an army lieutenant and two corporals were injured
in the bombing, apparently by leftist terrorists, of a highway
bridge on the country's main north-south highway 260 miles north of
Santiago.
   The officers were crossing the bridge in a car when the explosion
occurred, authorities said. The blast badly damaged the bridge, and
forced authorities to detour traffic.

   The Rev. Jesse Jackson said today that Soviet
officials have agreed to his proposal for an international telethon
to raise money for earthquake victims in Soviet Armenia, including
funds to rebuild churches.
   ``It is significant that (Soviet leader Mikhail S.) Gorbachev has
dispatched a minister of culture,'' Jackson said on ``CBS This
Morning.''
   ``And that is a significant breakthrough, that they would allow
us to rebuild churches, the center of hope for Armenia,'' Jackson
added.
   Jackson also called for federal laws to help the homeless in the
United States.
   In a joint news conference Sunday with Soviet Ambassador
Alexander Belonogov, Jackson said the telethon would be broadcast on
television in North America, the Soviet Union and Europe, with
toll-free telephone numbers provided in each country to accept
donations. It is tentatively planned for February.
   Entertainers Bill Cosby, Eddie Murphy and Cher have expressed
interest in the project, and Soviet entertainers would also
participate, he said.
   Telethon proceeds would be used ``specifically to help rebuild
churches in Armenia, to rebuild schools and to rebuild hospitals,''
Jackson said.
   Later in the day, Jackson attended a midtown Manhattan rally
against homelessness and told the crowd of marchers, estimated at
more than 5,000, that failure to provide people with a home should
be made a federal crime.
   ``We must make denial of the right to a house a federal crime,''
Jackson said. ``It must be illegal. ... We must join hands and march
to Washington by the tens of thousands and put housing legislation
on the books in the 1989 Congress.''
   Organizers bused in 2,000 homeless people from shelters and
welfare hotels around the city to join the protesters who marched in
the bitter cold along 57th Street, one of the city's fanciest
shopping thoroughfares.
   ``These streets suggest great wealth but people on other blocks
are freezing to death,'' said Paul Gorman, spokesman for Housing
Action Week, the coalition that organized the rally and six days of
events that preceded it.
   Organizers chose the week before Christmas to hold the march,
Gorman said, because ``this is the time of year when we celebrate
the birth of a homeless child to a homeless family.''
   Just as ``there was no room at the inn'' for Joseph and Mary, he
said, many poor families in New York are also homeless.

   Nearly 8,000 people were evacuated from cities and
towns shattered by Armenia's earthquake as authorities began trying
to clear the area of all but workers involved in the cleanup effort,
Pravda reported today.
   Another 4,500 mothers and children were expected to leave today
for Anapa, a Soviet children's resort in the Crimea, the official
Communist Party newspaper said. Within two to three days, only men
involved in the reconstruction should remain, it said.
   Mother Teresa, the 1979 Nobel Peace laureate, today offered the
Soviets the assistance of her religious order, the Missionaries of
Charity, which operates orphanages, hospitals, food centers and
schools in more than 25 countries.
   The Roman Catholic nun met in the Armenian capital of Yerevan
with Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov, who ``warmly thanked her for
the kind feelings, compassion, and the offered aid,'' Tass said.
   Tass did not say whether the Soviets agreed to accept help from
her order. In the past, churches and religious groups have been
barred from engaging in public assistance or operating hospitals,
schools and other social services.
   The Soviets say they have received $100 million in earthquake aid
from a total of 77 countries.
   Tass said the Soviet Union reached agreement with American
Telephone & Telegraph Co. to allow Armenians to call collect to the
United States, where many have friends and relatives.
   Soviets usually cannot place collect calls.
   The official news agency said Saturday that since the quake,
telephone traffic between Armenia and the United States has
increased eight-fold.
   Armenians ``whose senses have been dulled by grief'' still hope
to find survivors under collapsed homes and apartment buildings,
state-run Radio Moscow said Sunday, 11 days after the earthquake
that killed an estimated 55,000 people.
   ``We must hurry! _ these words are now in the souls and on the
lips of thousands of people who are helping liquidate the
consequences of the tragedy,'' the official Tass news agency said in
a report on Sunday's meeting of a special Politburo commission
overseeing the relief effort.
   There were no reports of survivors being found Sunday or today.
   Pravda said 15,252 people were dug out alive from the rubble in
the first 10 days after the Dec. 7 quake.
   More than 23,000 bodies have been recovered, but that is less
than half the total believed buried in piles of stone and concrete
dust that were once the cities of Spitak, Leninakan, Kirovakan and
up to 100 villages.
   ``The smell is becoming more and more pronounced every day'' in
Spitak, where 15,000 of the city's 25,000 are believed dead, said
Boris Yurchenko, a photographer for The Associated Press.
   ``The first sign of the terrible threat of an epidemic _ dead
dogs and swarming rats _ are forcing rescue teams to hurry, since no
leveling of the town can be done with corpses still remaining in
their stone graves,'' he said.
   The city was nearly deserted, with a few people searching for
relatives remaining behind and taking shelter in garages, Yurchenko
said.
   Snow and temperatures below freezing hampered relief efforts and
posed additional hardships for thousands of people left homeless.
   ``The first, most acute phase of the rescue effort is coming to
an end,'' Radio Moscow said. ``Preparations have started for
restoring the industries and housing.''
   There has been no official announcement of an end to the search
for survivors, a potentially explosive issue in Armenia where some
people have sat in front of bulldozers to prohibit clearing of
rubble until it can be searched for victims.
   ``Hopes for saving them are slim,'' the Politburo commission
concluded Sunday. ``But no matter how hard it is, no one has the
right to start fully clearing the grounds of factories and plants
until that operation is complete.''
   Armenian activists, embittered by Moscow's refusal to grant their
demands in a territorial dispute with neighboring Azerbaijan, have
accused the central government of not doing enough to warn Armenians
of the danger of an impending earthquake and of bungling relief
efforts.
   Soviet media continued to report on an official crackdown against
Armenian militants, including members of the Karabakh committee, six
of whose leaders have been arrested.
   The committee has spearheaded the 11-month-old campaign for
annexation of Nagorno-Karabakh, a predominantly Armenian enclave in
Azerbaijan.
   Radio Moscow said members of the committee had mounted
``continuous onslaughts'' on authorities since the earthquake and
handed out leaflets calling for strikes and demonstrations.

   There was no immediate comment from the company.
   Lee Min-ha allegedly collaborated with a former presidential
bodyguard, Park Jong-kyu, who acted as an agent for Northrop in
trying to sell 200 F-20s to South Korea, according to prosecution
officials. Park, a relative of Lee, died in 1985.
   Prosecutors said the Los Angeles-based company reportedly agreed
to pay Park $55 million, or 2 percent of the value of the planes, if
the sales were successful.
   Lee, 57, a former president of Dongyang Express Bus Co., told
prosecutors today he received $2 million from Park and $1.5 million
directly from Northrop in 1986.
   The American company was unable to sell the F-20s after two
planes crashed in demonstration flights in South Korea and in Canada.

<HEAD>Roh Says South Korea Will Have Formal Ties With East Bloc by 1990s</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Roh Tae-woo said today he
believes South Korea, which has been staunchly anti-communist for
four decades, will establish formal diplomatic relations with most
East bloc nations by the early 1990's.
   ``We already have a permanent mission in Hungary, and I think
during my tenure of office, our relations with most other communist
nations would develop into such a level,'' Roh told the South Korean
news agency, Yonhap.
   Roh, whose term expires in February 1993, said South Korea's
trade and other non-diplomatic links with the Soviet Union, China
and other communist nations would continue to grow.
   Hungary in September became the first communist nation to open
diplomatic relations with South Korea and the two countries
exchanged permanent missions this year.
   Hungary's chief of mission in Seoul, Sandor Etre, told reporters
this weekend that he is optimistic that diplomatic relations between
the two nations will be upgraded to an ambassadorial level soon.
   He said Hungary, an ally of communist North Korea, felt it could
not ignore the ``splendid economic growth'' of more than 40 million
South Koreans.
   South Korea signed a contract last week to extend a $65 million
commercial loan to Hungary. Another contract will be signed later to
provide Hungary with $60 million in loans from a consortium of eight
South Korean banks, government officials said.
   South Korea's links with other communist countries also have
grown considerably in recent years. The Soviet Union and several
other East bloc coutries have either opened or agreed to open trade
missions in South Korea.
   More than 1,000 businessmen from South Korea visited communist
nations in the first half of this year, Yonhap said.
   The government's Economic Planning Board is seeking to change
trade and investment regulations it views as obstructing effective
economic cooperation with communist nations, Yonhap said, quoting
unidentified government sources. Yonhap said the government also
will amend trade-related regulations, including import procedures,
participation in international biddings and exhibitions.
   The government now allows only one South Korean business at a
time to participate in biddings offered by communist nations. A
competitive bidding system among South Korean firms will be
considered, the agency said.
   The South Korean diplomatic links with the East bloc represent a
major setback for North Korea. The two Koreas have been bitter
rivals since 1945, when U.S. and Soviet troops ended the Japanese
occupation of the Korean peninsula. The two sides fought the bloody
Korean War in 1950-53.
   The president said he would continue to seek summit talks with
his North Korean counterpart, Kim Il Sung. The summit, if held,
would be the first since the division of the peninsula.

   A Nuremberg court today convicted
a former Nazi policeman of killing six people in Poland during World
War II and sentenced him to life imprisonment.
   Wilhelm Wagner, 82, was found guilty of murder in the slaying of
three Jews, two elderly men and a woman while serving as a Nazi
policeman in Poland in 1942.
   The court ruled that justice must be carried out, although 46
years have passed since the crimes were committed.
   Wagner, who denied any involvement in the slayings, continued to
work in West Germany as a policeman after the war.
   Officials say the case against Wagner is one of the last against
those involved in Nazi atrocities, because most are now either dead
or too old and feeble to stand trial.

   Four people, including a teen-ager shopping
for Christmas gifts, were killed and 13 were wounded over the
weekend in attacks police linked to gang violence.
   A 15-year-old boy was killed Sunday night in Hawaiian Gardens,
about 20 miles southeast of downtown. The teen-ager, who was not
identified pending notification of relatives, was standing on a
sidewalk when a car with five males stopped and yelled to him,
police Deputy Chris Wahla said.
   When the youth approached the car, he was shot with a shotgun,
Wahla said. He was pronounced dead at a hospital.
   Earlier Sunday, a man bearing gang tattoos was stabbed to death
in Pacoima, an unincorporated area 20 miles northwest of downtown in
the San Fernando Valley. Detectives said the victim's attackers
escaped.
   Two alleged gang members were booked for investigation of murder
after a teen-age bystander was killed in a gang shooting inside a
crowded shopping mall in Panorama City, police said.
   Sergio Alpuche, 16, of Van Nuys, who was not known to be a gang
member, was hit by a bullet in the chest Friday while shopping for
Christmas presents in the San Fernando Valley mall. He died the next
day.
   Arrested in the shooting were two young men, ages 22 and 18, both
believed to be gang members. Also arrested was a 16-year-old, police
said.
   The fourth gang killing occurred Friday night when Terrance Carl
Kennedy, 27, of Los Angeles was gunned down by rival gang members as
he walked with his girlfriend. She was unhurt.
   Two gang members were wounded by rivals early Sunday. Nine people
were wounded in five separate shootings Saturday night. Earlier
Saturday, two Pasadena teen-agers were wounded in a drive-by
shooting.
   At least 325 people have been killed in gang violence in Los
Angeles County this year, up from 284 in all of 1987.

   Sinhalese extremists armed with machine
guns and bombs attacked at least four polling places in today's
presidential voting, killing at least 15 people as others stayed
home due to threats of violence, officials said.
   Hundreds of people have been killed in the weeks leading up to
the elections in violence triggered by ethnic divisions, and all
three presidential candidates have vowed an end to the bloodshed.
   At least 25 people were wounded today when the extremists, who
had threatened to kill anyone who cast ballots, fired guns and
hurled bombs at voting stations in the Sinhalese heartland, police
and military officials said. Election officials said the threats and
violence kept many Sri Lankans from the polls.
   Troops and police had been deployed throughout this Indian Ocean
nation in an effort to assure calm balloting.
   ``This is a battle between the ballot and the bullet,'' Prime
Minister Ranasinghe Premadasa, 64, candidate of the governing United
National Party, said after voting in Colombo. ``The bullet must not
win.''
   Polls closed at 4 p.m. today, but results were not expected until
Tuesday.
   Premadasa's main rival was a former prime minister, Sirimavo
Bandaranaike, 72, of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party.
   Ossie Abeygoonasekera, 38, campaigned as the alternative
candidate to the two main parties and ran with the support of a
coalition of four small leftist parties.
   Deputy Commissioner of Elections Lakshman Perera estimated 50
percent of the 9.3 million eligible voters turned out, well below
the 80 percent who voted in the 1982 election.
   He said election violence and threats by Sinhalese extremists
kept many people away from the polls.
   All three candidates are Sinhalese, the mostly Buddhist ethnic
group that comprises 75 percent of the population. Tamils, who are
mostly Hindu, make up 18 percent of the population.
   The People's Liberation Front, a shadowy Sinhalese extremist
group, called for an election boycott and said it would kill anyone
who voted.
   It claimed balloting under the government of President Junius J.
Jayewardene would not be fair. It also vowed to kill government
supporters after Jayewardene signed an accord in July 1987 that
granted some autonomy to Tamil rebels fighting for an independent
homeland and allowed Indian troops into the country to try and keep
peace.
   Officials blamed today's attacks on the front. They said gunmen
in a jeep killed three voters and wounded 15 at Matala, about 100
miles southeast of Colombo.
   Another three voters, a soldier and a policeman were shot to
death near Polonnaruwara, 100 miles northeast of Colombo, and three
voters were hurt in another attack in the same area, they said.
   Three voters were killed by a bomb in Tangalle, 88 miles
southeast of Colombo, the officials said.
   A policeman died in an ambush in Ambalanagoda, 52 miles south of
Colombo, local police said.
   In the southern district of Moneragala, a police sergeant, an
election official and a driver were killed in two separate ambushes
on jeeps carrying ballot boxes after polls closed, the military said.
   Mrs. Bandaranaike and Abeygoonasekera offered themselves as
alternatives to a governing party they said had let the ethnic
tensions get out of control.
   The fighting is no longer a clearly defined conflict between
Sinhalese and Tamils. Sinhalese are killing fellow Sinhalese, and
rival Tamil factions clash with each other and with Indian troops,
who now number about 47,000.
   Mrs. Bandaranaike, who became the world's first female prime
minister in 1960, opposed the accord Jayewardene signed.
   She served as prime minister from 1960 to 1966 _ when it was the
country's most powerful post _ and again from 1970 to 1977 and said
she would not return to the stringent economic controls and
nationalization policies that led to her downfall.
   Premadasa also opposed the accord.
   He also claimed his humble beginnings made him the candidate of
the poor and promised to provide about $75 a month per family to the
nation's most impoverished people.
   Jayewardene was barred by the constitution from seeking a third
six-year term.
   Sunday was marked by at least 22 killings and four kidnappings,
and a bomb went off at a Colombo polling station and slightly
injured a policeman, according to police and military officials.
   Since the accord aimed at ending the Tamil insurrection was
signed, the government says the front has killed more than 650
people.
   The Tamil insurrection has claimed at least 8,500 lives since
1983.

   Americans' generosity is being tested this holiday season as they
respond to both the tragic earthquake in Soviet Armenia and needs at
home that appear greater than ever.
   By at least one measure _ United Way's projection for the year of
6 percent to 7 percent growth _ donations nationwide appear to have
increased.
   Charities in many communities say contributions of money,
clothing, toys and food are at least keeping pace with last year and
should pick up this week before Christmas.
   But in other cities, contributions have dropped, hampered by cold
weather, a shortage of bell ringers, shopping malls that banish
fund-raisers from entrances, weak local economies, or even a drain
on givers from campaign contributions earlier this year.
   Efforts to aid the victims of the earthquake in Soviet Armenia
appear to be having an impact on domestic giving in some cities, but
not in others, say spokesmen for the Salvation Army, American Red
Cross, Volunteers of America, United Way, food banks and other
charities.
   In Massachusetts, with an Armenian population estimated at more
than 60,000, most charity officials said it is too early to tell
whether that has cut into local giving.
   But at the American Red Cross, the tragedy appears to have
prompted an across-the-board increase in giving, said Philip
Schuyler, manager of operations, planning and development in Boston.
   ``The response has been the greatest I've ever seen in 18
years,'' he said. ``They're giving to both situations _ the homeless
here, the hungry in Armenia.''
   Among the nation's biggest cities, collections were reported up
in New York, Chicago, and Atlanta, but down in Los Angeles. In the
Midwest, Indianapolis, Kansas City, Mo., and St. Louis reported
healthy donations, while Minneapolis, Detroit and Iowa's cities were
having a more difficult time. And in the West, Phoenix and Tucson,
Ariz., showed drops, while Denver and Salt Lake City charities said
their contributions were on target.
   In Dallas, the Dallas Morning News Charities reported its drive
was ahead of last year's pace, but the Salvation Army said its cash
donations are down, part of the continuing impact of the oil bust.
   Money is tight in oil-linked Oklahoma City, too, Maj. Ralph
Morrel of the Salvation Army said last week, when collections were
running about $50,000 below what they were a year ago at the same
time.
   ``I understand from a lot of merchants that people aren't
spending as much money,'' he said. ``And when they spend money, they
give it away. When the merchants have a good year, we have a good
year.''
   In Detroit and Newark, N.J., the story is much the same. Giving
is down by at least $60,000 over last year for the Salvation Army in
Detroit, and officials blame the election year, a fluctuating stock
market and a skepticism born of the television evangelist scandals.
   In Newark, says Thelma Cloude, director of the Greater Newark
Social Services and Correction Bureau, the problem is that many
workers are falling further and further behind.
   ``This year, with the upsurgence of the working poor, those who
used to help us now need help themselves,'' she said.
   The Society of St. Vincent dePaul, Portland (Ore.) Council, took
in 13,000 pounds of canned food less than last year's total of
187,000 pounds, said executive director Tim Hornbecker. ``I think
people have not increased their earning power.''
   In Minneapolis, contributions to both Catholic Charities and the
Salvation Army are flagging.
   ``Our suspicion is that there's a lot more competition for the
charity dollar. A lot of social service programs are going after
money because of all the cutbacks for welfare,'' said Robert Miller
of Catholic Charities.
   A manpower shortage has caused donations to drop in other areas.
   Iowa's strong job market, with unemployment at 3.5 percent, has
cut into volunteers.
   ``You hate to think that's a bad sign for us in kettle season .
.. We're struggling to find help,'' said Lt. Jesse Collins of the
Salvation Army in Marshalltown, where only half the usual 15 bell
ringers could be mustered.
   In New York, the Volunteers of America is pulling in more money
from major donors and mail contributors, but its sidewalk Santa
campaign is not doing as well as had been expected, said John
Hartman, the group's development director.
   ``I'm not sure I know why we have a shortage'' of Santas, he
said. ``But it is a grueling job. The Santas are usually out on the
sidewalk from 8:30 in the morning to 8:30 or 9 o'clock at night, in
all kinds of weather.''
   The presidential campaign drain has been a problem, said
fund-raisers in Southern California, where Salvation Army donations
for the eight-county region are running 15 percent behind their 1987
rate.
   ``The fact of the matter is that we usually suffer every four
years when there's an election,' said Russell Prince, the army's
director of development in Southern California. ``We got hurt in
'84, but we've seen it this year more than ever. They've gotten more
sophisticated in their direct mail fund-raising techniques and it's
hurt us this year more than ever.''

   A teacher who disarmed a student
accused of killing one teacher and wounding another said he thought
it was a prank when he first saw the teen-ager wielding a
semiautomatic handgun.
   ``I thought it might be one of those Uzi-type water pistols,'' M.
Hutchins Matteson said. ``Then the glass was shot out and I knew it
was a reality.''
   Nicholas Elliott, 16, allegedly shot the window out of a locked
classroom door at Atlantic Shores Christian School in an effort to
reach a student he wanted to kill.
   ``My original thought was, `Oh my God, I'm going to be shot,''
Matteson said about the Friday incident. ``Then I remembered I had
38 students in there.''
   So Matteson stretched his arms in an effort to shield as many
students as possible while pleading with the teen-ager not to shoot.
   ``I cried out to him, `No, no, don't do it. This is no way.
Please don't do this,''' Matteson said.
   Police say Elliott fired two shots, including one that narrowly
missed Matteson, before his Cobray M-11 pistol jammed. Matteson
tackled Elliott and held him down while student Mark McNulty grabbed
the gun, a cheap imitation of a combat assault weapon.
   ``I've never been in a situation where I had to fight for my
life,'' said Matteson, 24. ``I thank God for giving me the presence
of mind and the physical ability to get the job done.''
   Police say that by the time Elliott reached Matteson's Bible
class, he already had killed Karen H. Farley, 40, and wounded Samuel
M. Marino, 37. Marino was in stable condition at Sentara Norfolk
General Hospital.
   Investigators said Elliott had gone to Ms. Farley's and Marino's
classrooms in search of a student who had been tormenting him.
   ``I think it's a classic case of the school bully vs. a meek and
mild kid and the boy finally got fed up with it and just snapped,''
a Virginia Beach detective told The Virginian-Pilot and The
Ledger-Star.
   The newspaper reported Sunday that authorities were saying
privately that racial insults may have ignited the boy's anger.
Elliott is one of four blacks in the student body of 510.
   Principal Fred Fuller said he was unaware of any racial friction,
but he could not rule it out. ``Let's face it, we're dealing with
kids and sometimes they go at it,'' Fuller said.
   Police were at a loss to explain why the student shot Ms. Farley,
who was alone in her portable classroom.
   Authorities said that moments after that shooting, the youth went
to Marino's classroom about 50 feet away and showed him the pistol.
Marino told the boy it was against the rules to bring a gun to
school and asked for the weapon before being shot in the shoulder.
   Elliott is being held on charges of first-degree murder,
attempted murder, malicious assault, use of a firearm in a felony
and firing into an occupied building.
   Relatives and friends have described Elliott as a quiet loner
with an affinity for guns. He spent most of his time playing with
his pet pigeon, watching television and reading gun magazines.

<TEXT>
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze and his
Japanese counterpart, Sousuke Uno, met today to discuss a thorny
border dispute that has disrupted their relations for the past four
decades.
   Japan said it is prepared to step up economic cooperation with
Moscow, a Foreign Ministry official said, without elaborating.
   Shevardnadze also paid a courtesy call on the Imperial Palace,
where he signed a register with wishes for the recovery of Emperor
Hirohito, 87, who has been seriously ill for three months.
   The Soviet foreign minister and Uno spent about 6{ hours in talks
that centered on the disputed Soviet-held Kiril islands, which Japan
claims. The issue has disrupted relations between the two nations
for more than four decades.
   ``The Soviets have shown no basic change in their position,''
said a Japanese Foreign Ministry official, who requested anonymity.
   Uno told his Soviet counterpart that Japan saw ``great potential
to further economic relations,'' the official said, adding that
Shevardnadze agreed there were possible economic benefits.
   Observers say that Moscow may be more willing than in the past to
negotiate a compromise on the territorial issue because it needs
Japanese investment and economic cooperation to help develop the
Soviet Far East.
   The official quoted Uno as saying one of the obstructions to
developing bilateral trade was the Soviet economic system, including
the inconvertibility of the Soviet currency and shortage of skilled
labor. Bilateral trade totaled $4.9 billion in 1987, and is expected
to increase slightly this year, to $4.98 billion.
   The two ministers are to meet again on Tuesday to discuss
tensions on the Korean peninsula and in Cambodia and Sino-Soviet
relations, well as to continue discussions on the Kiril islands,
Foreign Ministry officials said.
   The Kirils were occupied by Soviet troops at the end of World War
II, but Japan claims it pioneered settlement of the islands, from
which the Soviets ousted 17,000 Japanese residents.
   In a 1956 Japan-Soviet joint declaration, Moscow announced its
willingness to return two of the islands after a peace treaty is
signed. But during his last visit to Japan in January 1986,
Shevardnadze refused to discuss the issue. Gorbachev told former
Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone in Moscow in July that Japan's
alliance with the West was blocking the return of the islands, and
said the dispute was delaying Japan-Soviet rapprochement.
   ``Japan-Soviet political dialogue and mutual understanding is
generally delayed. ... While there are objective reasons for this,
it should be possible to relax or eliminate the reasons for this
delay,'' Shevardnadze acknowledged after arriving at Tokyo's Haneda
International Airport on Sunday.
   Shevardnadze is to meet Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita Tuesday.
Officials said Japan will renew an invitation for Gorbachev to visit
Japan.
   The two sides plan a joint communique on agreements for cultural
exchanges and protection of migratory birds, Foreign Ministry
officials said. The cultural pact includes a program for student
exchanges for the first time, they said.
   Shevardnadze's wife Nanuli, who is a journalist, will attend
various cultural activities, including a tea ceremony, during her
stay. She is to visit a pearl shop, museum and library and meet
Hanae Mori, one of Japan's top fashion designers.
   Shevardnadze is to leave Tokyo Wednesday for the Philippines and
North Korea.

   The government is looking for a dozen men
who wouldn't mind feasting on a diet of King salmon for 100 days.
They'd even get paid a $2,300 salary.
   ``We're talking about salmon with dill weed, broiled salmon,
baked salmon _ just like the fine restaurant food,'' said Gary
Nelson, project coordinator for the U.S. Department of Agriculture's
Western Human Nutrition Research Center at the Presidio.
   But there's a catch for those who participate in the study,
Nelson warned.
   The study also entails confinement, lots of physical tests and no
conjugal visits.
   Participants will sleep, eat and drink at the center's hotellike
facility that has a pool table, compact disc player and television.
There will be daily walks and some organized activities, but no
monkey business allowed.
   ``We don't want anyone to sneak a candy bar or a beer,'' Nelson
said.
   The Agriculture Department originally wanted women for its study,
but couldn't find any takers.
   The study, expected to begin in January, is intended to gauge the
effect that a steady diet of fish has on keeping arteries free of
blood clots.

   PLO chief Yasser Arafat said today he
wants U.N. help in getting Israel to join Middle East peace efforts,
but he said Palestinians will not stop their uprising in the
Israeli-occupied territories.
   His visit was seen as part of his campaign to drum up
international backing for a Mideast peace conference under U.N.
auspices.
   Arafat, speaking to reporters at Vienna's Schwechat airport,
sidestepped a question as to whether the Palestine Liberation
Organization would continue armed resistance against Israeli
authorities.
   ``You mean resistance,'' he said several times. ``Our people will
definitely continue their intefadeh,'' a reference to the
Palestinian uprising in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   The Austrian government expressed support for the PLO but did not
extend formal recognition to the recently proclaimed Palestinian
state.
   After meetings with Chancellor Franz Vranitzky and Foreign
Minister Alois Mock, Arafat said he had named the head of the PLO
mission in Vienna, Daud Barakat, as ambassador.
   But Vrantizky and Mock made clear that Barakat would not
accredited. They said Austria does not recognize states without
territory but pledged political and humanitarian support for the PLO.
   In separate letters to Vranitzky and Mock, the Jewish community
and two other pro-Israeli organizations expressed displeasure over
Arafat's reception in Austria.
   By receiving Arafat, ``Austria puts itself in the service of PLO
propaganda,'' said a joint letter from Jewish leaders, the
Austrian-Israeli Society and B'nai B'rith.
   Arafat's comments today came a day after Salah Khalaf, the
second-in-command in Arafat's Fatah PLO faction, made clear the PLO
does not intend to abandon the use of force.
   ``(President) Reagan may stop his government's dialogue with the
PLO now if he thinks he will be able to stop our attacks against
Israeli military targets,'' Khalaf said Sunday in Abu Dhabi, United
Arab Emirates.
   It was an apparent reaction to the U.S. statement Friday that any
PLO terrorist acts would derail U.S.-PLO talks in Tunisia.
   The PLO serves as an umbrella organization for eight guerrilla
factions which sometimes fight among themselves or launch
independent attacks on Israeli targets.
   Arafat said he came to Austria ``for more support in the
direction of peace ... for the process of peace'' in the Middle East.
   Asked how he wants to bring the Israelis in the process, Arafat
said, ``through the United Nations and through the support of ....
all people who are looking for real just peace in the Middle East.''
   He said he had expected Israel to reject his offer for direct
talks with the PLO, made during a speech in Geneva last week.
   ``But sooner or later they will discover that peace is more
important for them than anything else,'' he added.
   Israel considers the PLO a terrorist organization and government
officials have made clear they will not change their stance despite
Friday's first direct contacts between the United States and the PLO
in 13 years.
   Washington last week reversed its 13-year ban on official
contacts with the PLO after Arafat renounced terrorism and accepted
Israel's right to exist.
   U.S. officials have indicated that a continuation of the talks
will not continue until President-elect George Bush takes office
Jan. 20.
   Arafat arrived from Cairo, where he conferred with Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak. On Tuesday Arafat was to visit Yugoslavia,
the Yugolav state news agency Tanjug said.
   On Sunday, a senior Arafat adviser said Bush has a better grasp
of the Arab-Israeli conflict than any U.S. leader since Richard
Nixon and offers improved hopes for a peace settlement.
   Hassan, a co-founder of the PLO's dominant Fatah faction, said in
an interview in Tunis that he expects Bush or James Baker, the
designated secretary of state, to make a clear policy statement on
the Middle East peace process soon after the inauguration.
   ``Since Nixon there has been no U.S. policy for the Middle
East,'' he said, describing the Ford, Carter and Reagan
adminstrations as having had to learn the Palestinian question from
scratch.
   ``The U.S. government needs a lot of work to prove its
credibility,'' Hassan said. ``I hope Bush will do that.''

   Relatives of people who died in the August
1987 crash of Northwest Airlines Flight 255 decorated the crash site
near Metropolitan Airport with holiday wreaths.
   About 25 family members brought decorated wreaths Sunday to the
site along Interstate 94 where 156 people died when the plane
crashed on takeoff. They prayed and joined hands to sing ``Silent
Night, Holy Night.''
   Some relatives reacted angrily to Northwest's proposal last week
that it would accept liability in the crash in cases where
plaintiffs declined to seek punitive damages.
   Families who accept could receive money by early next year for
compensatory damages. The plan must be approved by Northwest and
lawyers for the victims.
   ``If they tell us to accept now, there's no way,'' said Frankie
Langton of Carlton, whose daughter Hollins, 26, was killed along
with her fiance, Michael Zanger, 23.
   Betty Polec of Mount Clemens, who organized Sunday's service,
agreed. Her daughter and son-in-law, Lisa and Donald Klaft, were
killed in the crash.
   ``It stinks,'' Polec said. ``They don't want to admit liability
and bring out all the things that were really wrong. And that's
wrong.
   ``If you don't institute a lawsuit, you are forgiving them,
patting them on the back, when they've completely turned our lives
around. I want them punished. No deals for them, absolutely not,''
she said.
   Federal Aviation Administration investigators said pilot error
was the chief cause of the crash, which killed all aboard except a
young girl. A contributing factor was a failed warning system that
should have alerted the pilots that the jet's flaps were not set
properly for takeoff.

   Two American Peace Corps
volunteers were killed when their car crashed down a mountainside in
South Africa, U.S. officials said today.
   Juanita Quiton, 39, of Portland, Ore.; and Brenda Sue Crawford,
27, of Frostburg, Md., were killed Friday afternoon while on their
way to a vacation in Zimbabwe, said Peace Corps officials who held a
memorial service for them today.
   They had worked in Swaziland, a small mountain kingdom bordered
on three sides by South Africa and on the fourth by Mozambique.
Zimbabwe is to the north.
   The service was in Mbabane, the Swaziland capital.
   Two American men were traveling in the car with the women, but
embassy officials did not have their names and did not know who was
driving. The men were not injured.
   Officials said the car failed to complete a turn on a moutain
road and plunged 450 feet down the hillside near the South African
town of Belfast.
   Miss Crawford had worked since June 1987 with the Swaziland
Department of Land Utilization and Natural Resources as an urban
planner.
   Miss Quiton arrived in October 1987 and promoted home-based
industry at the Sithobelo Rural Education Center.
   An embassy official said the bodies were expected to be flown
home Tuesday.

   They sang ``Do You Hear What I Hear,'' but
shoppers at a Tulsa mall could hear the Christmas melody only in
their hearts.
   Hearing-impaired students from Edison middle and senior high
schools performed Christmas carols Saturday using sign language,
while Santa Claus also signed to hearing-impaired children a few
feet away.
   ``The choir is really just another dimension to the beauty of
Christmas,'' said Sharon Wade, director of the school's Deaf
Education Department. ``Watching the joy on their faces as they
share these songs makes you realize that Christmas really is for
everyone.''
   This was the second year the choir has performed at Southroads
Mall during the holiday, and the fourth year the signing Santa has
taken requests.
   ``We do this for everyone,'' Ms. Wade said. ``I think it helps
people to be more aware that these kids have something to share at
Christmas.''

   At a middle school in this affluent
Baltimore suburb, it's the kids who play Santa Claus for a group of
underprivileged youngsters from the inner city.
   ``Before I became adviser, the person before me had kids bring
gloves and mittens in'' for needy youngsters, said Betty Carpenter
of Ridgely Middle School. ``I wanted to have more personal
involvement. Our kids are mostly well off, and just giving gloves
and mittens just wasn't personal enough.''
   For the past 20 years, the public school has held a Christmas
party. This year, 125 students volunteered as hosts, and many more
helped by donating money and old toys for gifts.
   The 35 guests, ranging in age from 4 to 11, were from St.
Michael's Catholic Church in East Baltimore. Each left with a large
box of presents.
   One of the hosts, 11-year-old Damian Salerno, found giving during
the holiday season to be rewarding.
   ``I think this is good because it makes people who are not as
fortunate as us feel the good of a Christmas most people take for
granted,'' the sixth-grader said. ``I feel good about this.''

   Santa Claus is supposed to know everyone
who is naughty and nice, but he apparently let someone slip past him.
   A thief snatched the cash box Sunday from a Santa Claus in a
shopping mall, while Santa and his helpers had their backs turned.
   ``Who could rob Santa at Christmastime?'' asked Kim Crowe, whose
7-year-old son, Steven, spoke to the Santa at Harding Mall. ``I
think it has to be terrible. It's worse than terrible. I can't even
think of words to describe it.''
   The cash box, containing about $158, was taken as one helper took
a break and another had her back turned, said police officer Rob
Forrest. The money was being collected by Santa Plus, a private
company that sells pictures of children sitting with Santa Claus,
Forrest said.
   The thief was last seen running toward a neighborhood behind the
mall, police said.
   Mike Hendrixson, who took his son, Jon, 3, to see Santa not long
after the robbery, said he thought the theft was ``cruel.''
   ``It's kind of sick. It's kind of morbid,'' Hendrixson said.

   Opposition leader Neil Kinnock
today urged the families of British soldiers to stand firm against
IRA threats in the fourth bombing of British army homes in the
province in a month.
   The Labor Party leader, on a one-day visit to Northern Ireland,
spoke out in the Londonderry's housing project where more than 100
homes were destroyed or had their windows broken by Sunday's car
bombing, police said.
   A 12-year-old boy and his mother were taken to the hospital and
treated for shock, but no other injuries were reported.
   The outlawed Irish Republican Army telephoned a warning about a
bomb at a housing project in Waterside, but it exploded 15 minutes
later, police said.
   The IRA, fighting to end British rule in Northern Ireland and
unite it with the Irish Republic, on Friday gave wives and children
of British soldiers one week to get out of what it called the ``war
zone'' and return to the British mainland.
   The Royal Ulster Constabulary, the province's police force, said
some army families lived in the Nelson Drive project, but the
majority of the residents were civilians with no military
connections.
   Kinnock said he opposed withdrawing the families of servicemen,
``great though the difficulties are.''
   ``No concessions must be made to terrorism and withdrawal of the
families would be that,'' he said.
   About 10,500 British troops are deployed in Northern Ireland.
Unofficial estimates say between 1,500 and 2,000 soldiers have their
families with them.
   Since the IRA intensified attacks on British servicemen in March,
44 soldiers have been killed, including four at British bases in
continental Europe and one at a base in London.

   A previously unknown group has claimed
responsibility for the kidnapping in May of a Belgian physician and
accused him of being a spy.
   The statement by the group, the Soldiers of Justice, was
delivered Sunday to two Western news agencies in Beirut.
   ``The Soldiers of Justice Organization announces that it seized
Jan Marcel Maria Robert Cools, born 15-7-56 in the Belgian
Herk-de-Stad region, on 21-5-88,'' the group said in a typewitten
Arabic-language statement.
   The statement was accompanied by photocopies of Cools' identity
card, draft card, driving license and what looked like his passport.
   Cools, 32, disappeared May 21 after leaving his apartment in the
Rashidiyeh Palestinian refugee camp near the southern port of Tyre.
   He worked for the Norwegian humanitarian organization Norwac for
three months before he vanished.
   Belgian Charge d'Affaires Guebert Bioul confirmed that Cools was
born on the date listed and at the place cited in the statement.
   ``I can't say whether the photocopied documents with the
statement are authentic or not because I haven't seen them. But it's
probable that they are,'' he said in an interview. He declined
further comment.
   The language of the two-page statement indicated the group was
composed of Shiite Moslem militants. Similar pro-Iranian groups hold
most of the 14 other foreigners believed held hostage in Lebanon.
   The statement accused Cools of using his medical activities as a
cover for spying on anti-Israeli Shiite guerrillas in south Lebanon.
   ``After monitoring his suspicious movements and establishing
irrefutable evidence about the truth of his actitivities, our
mujahedeen (holy warriors) arrested him,'' the statement said.
   ``The board of our organization is examining the charges against
Cools to hand down just punishment. The verdict will be issued at a
later date,'' the statement concluded.
   The statement was issued the day after Swiss Red Cross official
Peter Winkler, kidnapped a month ago in south Lebanon, was freed in
the port city of Sidon. He arrived back in Switzerland Sunday.
   Fourteen other foreigners, including nine Americans, are missing
and believed held hostage in Lebanon. The longest held is Terry
Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press,
who was abducted March 16, 1985.

   An Italian technician captured by
Ethiopian rebels last June has been released and may fly home today,
an Italian Embassy spokesman said.
   The former hostage, Giuseppe Micelli, was turned over to the
embassy Sunday and was staying at the residence of the ambassador,
Juan Carlo Farnilli, the spokesman said.
   ``A special plane has arrived from Italy to take him there,''
said the spokesman, who refused to be identified by name.
   A small, little-known Marxist-Leninist group called the Ethiopian
People's Revolutionary Army kidnapped Micelli on June 27 in the
Gojjam district of northwestern Ethiopia.
   Micelli had been working near Lake Tana on the Italian-financed
Tana-Beles Irrigation Project, designed to build a dike on the Blue
Nile and construct roads in the area.
   Micelli's capture, like earlier abductions of several Italians
and Ethiopians from the Tana-Beles work force, apparently was
intended to dramatize the rebels' opposition to the Marxist
government of President Mengistu Haile Mariam. All previous hostages
have been freed.
   An Italian Embassy source said last week that the Sudan
government had played a major role in getting the rebels to agree to
Micelli's release. The technician was to have been freed in the
first week of December, the source said, but this was delayed for
unspecified ``technical reasons.''
   The same source also said that rebel conditions for Micelli's
release were ``easily complied with. They (rebels) only asked that
the people in the (Tana) area benefit more from the irrigation
project.''
   The statement was taken as indicating the rebel request was
relayed to the Ethiopian government.

<TEXT>
   Premier Andreas Papandreou, whose
scandal-ridden government won what he called a vote of confidence in
Parliament, today vowed he would remain in office until the June
election.
   ``I feel a special satisfaction and pride because my
parliamentary group, united, had not only approved the budget, but
as I interpreted it ... gave a vote of confidence in the program and
timetable for elections,'' Papandreou said after the votes were
counted Sunday night.
   With 296 deputies present in the 300-member chamber, Parliament
voted 156 to 138 in favor of the record $27.9 billion budget. Two
deputies abstained from the vote.
   All those voting in favor of the budget were from Papandreou's
governing Panhellenic Socialist Movement.
   Papandreou had said he considered Sunday's session a vote of
confidence in his government and would resign if the budget was not
approved.
   The opposition, led by the conservative New Democracy and the
Communist Party, rejected the budget on grounds that this year's
deficit was $2 billion more than last year's.
   The political opposition has been waging a campaign against
Papandreou's party since a $300 million banking and arms scandals
broke in October. The opposition parties charged government
officials were involved in illegal deals allegedly set up by banker
George Koskotas, who is accused of influence peddling, embezzlement
and fraud.
   The deals allegedly involved _ directly or indirectly _ the prime
minister and members of his party, including Papandreou's son,
George, who is minister of education.
   Seven ministers have left the 59-member Cabinet and Koskotas, the
former chairman of the Bank of Crete, fled Greece Nov. 6 and has
been arrested in the United States.
   Newspapers that supported Papandreou have criticized him for
dragging his feet in ordering an investigation into the scandal.
   Recent opinion polls have indicated that Papandreou and his party
would not be able to win a parliamentary majorty if elections were
held soon.

   Frequent fire alarms may have left some
residents off guard when fire swept through a downtown residential
hotel, killing one person and seriously injuring another, a survivor
said.
   ``We're so used to it,'' said Helena M.B. TeleRado, a hairdresser
and 10-year resident of the Morningside Hotel. ``The fire alarms are
always going on, and they turn it off.''
   Fire Chief Luther Taylor said Sunday's fire was apparently
started by a discarded match in a third-floor apartment.
   Robert Ziker, the hotel's owner, identified the dead man as
Julius Wood, 49, a resident whose body was found in a fourth-floor
apartment.
   Police identified the seriously injured man as Philip Scott, 39.
He was being treated for burns at South Bend Memorial Hospital. He
had been in critical condition, but doctors upgraded him today to
serious.
   The hospital also admitted a resident for smoke inhalation and
another for a broken ankle. Both were in stable condition. St.
Joseph Medical Center admitted a woman in serious condition from
smoke inhalation. Three residents and two fire fighters were treated
for minor injuries and released.
   Two residents who were unaccounted for Sunday night contacted
police early today. They told police they were not at the hotel when
the fire broke out.
   The 105-room, four-story hotel, built in 1924, provided cheap
housing for transients and some long-term residents, many of whom
depend on Social Security or other limited income, authorities said.
   Ms. TeleRado said she paid no heed to an alarm that rang for five
minutes about 9:40 a.m. Sunday, then went silent, or initially to a
maintenance man who pounded on hallway walls and yelled fire.
   ``Certainly there remains a possibility the information was not
passed as quickly as it might have been,'' said Mayor Joseph Kernan.
   He added that a fire alarm was ringing at midafternoon when he
toured the third floor after firefighters controlled the blaze.
   The blaze spread quickly through the L-shaped brick building,
which also housed a music store and karate school. The building was
largely gutted and a wall collapsed. Taylor had no estimate of the
damages.
   Once she realized the danger, Ms. TeleRado said, ``I didn't even
have time to grab my boots, and my boots were right there by the
door.''
   Many residents fled shoeless and in nightclothes and lost their
few possessions, said the Rev. Steven Newton, director of a newly
opened homeless center who took in 56 Morningside residents.
   ``They were in the last kind of housing you can get before the
streets,'' said Newton. ``We're not talking about condominiums being
burned out.''
   Word of the fire brought an outpouring of food, clothing, gifts
and money to the homeless center. Showing a check made out to the
center for $1,000, center volunteer David T. Link said, ``Somebody
just walked in off the street with that.''

   The army has taken disciplinary action against
officers in northern Israel for abuses during basic training such as
denying water and medical treatment to recruits, an army spokesman
said today.
   The Hebrew-language daily Maariv said the action followed
complaints filed recently by parents of recruits to the prestigious
Golani Brigade.
   Such charges often cause a scandal in Israel, where all men are
required to serve three years in the army and all women serve two
years. Most men also serve at least 42 days of reserve duty each
year until age 55.
   Maariv detailed five of the complaints in a front-page report.
Recruits also were allowed only two or three hours sleep instead of
the regulation six hours in at least two instances and were once
denied water for an entire day, the newspaper said.
   The report said some soldiers were also denied visits to the
doctor and were left limping from leg injuries. Others have required
psychological treatment following the abuses, the newspaper said.
   Maariv said a sergeant and a platoon commander were removed from
their posts and a company commander was to be tried by an army
tribunal. The paper said unspecified action also was taken against a
base commander.
   The army spokesman would not give details of the actions taken
against the four, or of the alleged abuses.
   As a result of the abuses most recruits dropped out of the unit,
where service is mostly on a voluntary basis and only 25 percent
complete basic training, Maariv said.
   An army spokesman said Gen. Yossi Peled, the head of northern
command personally investigated the matter and took disciplinary
action against those involved.
   ``The Northern Command looks very gravely upon such phenomena.
Steps have been taken to ensure such phenomena don't recur,'' the
spokesman said.
   Maariv said Peled had also appointed a team to further
investigate the case.

   A 51-year-old fashion model says
she scared away an armed assailant with a rib punch and a kick to
the shins because she didn't want to die.
   Carolyn Brimer said she left the pistol-packing man stunned
Saturday after he assaulted her in a shopping mall parking lot.
   ``I didn't want to be lying in a ditch, bleeding to death,'' Mrs.
Brimer said. ``I didn't want to be dead in a gutter.''
   Mrs. Brimer, 5-foot-5 and 115 pounds, was on her way to her job
as a department store model when a man appeared as she was getting
her purse from her car.
   The man jabbed a pistol into her rib cage and told her to get
into her car, Mrs. Brimer said.
   ``I knew if I got in that car, that was it,'' she said.
   She said she shouted ``No!'' and gave the man the one-two,
punch-kick combination. The man looked stunned, then slowly walked
away with his head cocked to one side, still looking at her.
   Mrs. Brimer jumped into her car and locked the doors. Larry
Epperson, an off-duty policeman working as a mall security guard,
then walked by and offered help.
   Epperson took Mrs. Brimer inside the store and then chased a man
on foot and apprehended him. No weapon was found.
   Police charged Billy Terry, 23, of Atkins, with criminal attempt
to commit kidnapping, aggravated assault and fleeing the scene of a
crime.
   ``I'm just thankful I have my life _ that God had his hand in
it,'' Mrs. Brimer said. ``I hope other women will stand up and
fight. Someone has got to put a stop to this.''

   One woman was killed and 31
people were injured when black music fans, angered by lengthy delays
at a rock concert, attacked motorists driving on a nearby road,
police and witnesses said today.
   The crowd at the Magalies Resort, about 60 miles west of
Pretoria, hurled rocks, bricks and other objects at passing cars
Sunday afternoon after waiting two hours for the concert to begin,
the witnesses said.
   Twenty-two whites were among those injured as they drove through
a 200-yard stretch of road where the mob was attacking vehicles,
police and witnesses said. A young black woman was killed when she
was hit by a car, police said.
   One of the performers who arrived late, popular black singer
Yvonne Chaka Chaka, narrowly escaped injury when the mob attacked
her van which had her name written on the side, witnesses said.
   About 4,000 people attended the concert, and nine were arrested
on charges including attempted murder, police said.
   In a separate development, a white man charged in a shooting
spree that targeted blacks and left eight people dead and 15 injured
pleaded innocent today to murder charges.
   Barend Strydom, 23, a former policemen who belongs to an neo-Nazi
group, was arrested Nov. 15 after he went on a shooting rampage in
downtown Pretoria. All the victims were black except for one man of
Indian descent.
   Three pyschiatric reports presented to the court today declared
Strydom fit to stand trial.
   Strydom is a member of the Afrikaner Resistance Movement, which
opposes all concessions to blacks and views President P.W. Botha's
gradual race reforms as capitulation to the nation's 26 million
black majority.
   The case was recessed until February.
   Also today, Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu attacked the
government for placing restrictions on the funeral of a black woman
activist.
   Irene Mkwayi, 64, who died last week of natural causes, was the
co-president of the Release (Nelson) Mandela Campaign and wife of
Wilton Mkwayi, a member of the African National Congress guerrilla
movement who has been imprisoned since 1964.
   A large police contingent was present at the church service and
the Avalon Cemetery, where Mrs. Mkwayi was buried. Police restricted
the funeral to 200 people, allowed only ministers to speak, limited
the service to two hours and specified a route for the funeral
procession.
   ``I want to tell the government that they may have tear gas, dogs
and detention without trial, but we know we are going to be free.
This is our land,'' Tutu said.

   President Reagan's farewell address to the
nation is likely to be on Jan. 11 but might be on some other date in
mid-January, his spokesman said today.
   Spokesman Marlin Fitzwater had previously announced that Reagan
would make such an address from the Oval Office in the closing days
of his administration.
   Asked about a report that it had been scheduled for Jan. 11, he
replied, ``I wouldn't guide you away from that date, but we are not
ready to announce it yet, just in case we want to make a change at

   A bomb exploded early today outside
a U.S. Peace Corps building, damaging it and shattering nearby
windows, but no one was hurt, officials said.
   U.S. Embassy spokesman Charles Barclay described the bomb as
``powerful'' but said it caused little damage to the building.
``There were no victims,'' he said.
   A police spokesman, Maj. Manuel Antonio Urbina, said witnesses
saw people hurl the bomb at the building from a speeding automobile.
He said the explosion shattered shop windows along the block.
   No one has claimed responsibility.
   The Peace Corps is made up of volunteers who spend time in
underdeveloped countries worldwide helping people improve their

   Service was restored early this morning to a
satellite that went on the blink during NBC-TV's broadcast of a
National Football League game, according to a spokesman for a
communications company transmitting signals to the satellite.
   NBC switched to another satellite during the game Sunday, but
service on the K2 was not restored until about 12 hours later, said
Ray Conover, director of engineering at Conus Communications, one of
the companies that sends transmissions to television stations and
broadcast networks via the satellite.
   Viewers of the Seattle Seahawks-Los Angeles Raiders contest on
Sunday saw their picture turn snowy when the satellite went out
about 6:30 p.m. EDT during the game's second half.
   The K2 satellite, operated by GE American Communications Inc. was
restored to service by approximately 6 a.m. EDT, said Conover.
   ``All our traffic today has gone normally,'' added Conover,
saying Conus had been successfully transmitting to the GE network in
Vernon Hills, N.J., where signals are sent to the satellite .
   The satellite had been spinning and ``mutating from its normal
position'' according to a GE engineer, who spoke Sunday on condition
of anoymity .
   The exact duration of the outage depended on what part of the
country the viewer was in, said NBC spokesman Doug Kelly. The
network was broadcasting two football games at the time in various
parts of the country; the second game, involving the Kansas City
Chiefs and San Diego Chargers, was unaffected, Kelly said.
   After programming on the satellite went out, NBC swiftly started
moving to an alternate satellite, dubbed K1.
   Also affected were Independent Network News, AT&T data and video
customers, as well as radio data services, the GE Americom engineer
said.
   Engineers in Vernon Hills and Somis, Calif., attempted late
Sunday to regain control of the $150 million satellite, which is
22,500 miles above Earth.
   ``We knew they were back in touch with the satellite before
midnight,'' said Conover, but ``once they regained control of it it
took a few hours to get it back in place.''
   ``We're not real sure yet as to why this happened,'' said Conover.

<HEAD>Gang Arrested For Series of Rapes and Murders</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police today arrested a dozen people suspected of
belonging to a gang that committed a series of robberies, rapes and
murders in south London and the neighboring Surrey and Kent
countryside.
   Police involved in the dawn raids resulting in the arrests said
the suspected gang members apparently committed violence for thrills
or because they were high on drugs.
   Armed officers from the Surrey police and Scotland Yard joined
forces to raid two south London addresses and arrested one woman and
11 men, police said.
   Those arrested were taken to Croydon, 10 miles south of London,
where they were being questioned.
   Detective Chief Supt. Vincent McFadden, head of Surrey Criminal
Investigation Department, said information about the possible
identities of the gang members was given by known criminals sickened
by the crimes.
   ``Attacking women and people in their own homes is abhorrent to
them and they are willing to give us information, albeit
anonymously, but information nevertheless,'' the police chief said.
   Detectives link the gang with 11 unsolved crimes and believe they
may have been responsible for many more.
   On Dec. 5, three men from the gang raped a young mother in front
of her baby son. On Thursday, gang members beat one man to death and
a few hours later repeatedly stabbed another.
   In the latest rampage Thursday night the gang, armed with a gun
and machete, hijacked a car and fatally beat its driver, Peter
Hurburgh, 57. His bound body was left in a field.
   Early Friday, they broke into the home of retired businessman
Richard Napier and ransacked the house, slashing and stabbing his
son Timothy, 41, who was critically ill in a hospital today.

   A 6-year-old boy died after falling off
a hay wagon filled with Christmas carolers and being struck by a
wheel.
   ``Somehow he slipped getting onto the thing and fell back under

   ``I rubbed his face and told him I was Daddy, and I loved him and
told him to try to stay awake,'' said Watson, who has five other
children.
   The wagon, which held about 20 carolers, was pulled by a truck.
   The boy was pronounced dead on arrival Saturday night at a
hospital. The death was ruled accidental, said state Trooper W.D.
Cox.
   ``It was just one of those freak accidents that just happened,''
Watson said. ``The last minutes of his life were spent singing
Christmas carols and praising Jesus _ praising the Lord _ and he
spent the last few minutes of his life happy. He was a very happy
boy anyway. Now he's in heaven.''

<HEAD>Nunn Says No `Old Boy Game' With Tower</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate Armed Services Committee will not
play the ``old boy game'' with former Sen. John Tower,
president-elect Bush's choice to head the Defense Department,
committee chairman Sam Nunn said today.
   ``The committee will have a higher set of standards ... for the
entire team,'' from Tower down through the Pentagon's top set of
managers, Nunn, D-Ga., told a group of reporters in a wide-ranging
interview.
   Asked whether Tower would receive kid-glove treatment at his
confirmation hearing next month before the panel he formerly
chaired, Nunn said: ``We are not going to play the old-boy game this
go-around.''
   Nunn said he and Sen. John Warner of Virginia, the panels'
ranking Republican, would insist on seeing the full report on Tower
by the FBI, which conducted an extensive background investigation
following allegations of womanizing and drinking, and reports about
Tower's coziness with the defense industry.
   Defense analysts and congressional observers have predicted that
Tower, chairman of the panel during the first half of the Reagan
administration, would receive deferential treatment and breeze to
confirmation.
   But Nunn said he did not want to repeat the mistakes of Tower's
early tenure as chairman, when former top Pentagon official Melvyn
Paisley was confirmed. Paisley now figures prominently in the
government's defense procurement fraud case.
   On other subjects, Nunn said:
   _ The government should focus its attention on cleaning up
nuclear messes at its aging nuclear weapons production facilities
around the country and restoring safety to neglected reactors,
including those at the Savannah River plant in South Carolina
southeast of Augusta.
   The United States will not run into a shortage of tritium for use
in nuclear weapons for ``a year or two,'' he said, and that prospect
poses no immediate threat to national security. ``We've got to find
the money to modernize and clean up,'' he said, adding that the
Energy Department, which runs the facilities, should concentrate on
getting one reactor restarted at Savannah River, rather than
spreading its resources too thinly.
   _ While the South African government has eased restrictions on
some well-known anti-apartheid activists like Nelson Mandela, it
continues to imprison younger, nonviolent protesters without
apparent cause. Nunn returned Friday from a two-week trip to South
Africa, Kenya and Zaire.
   ``There is not the kind of communication necessary if South
Africa's problems are going to be solved peacefully,'' Nunn said,
adding that Congress will have to look closely in the coming year at
possible new sanctions, including American disinvestment.
   _ It would be ``unrealistic'' to expect a new vote in Congress
any time soon on renewal of military aid to Nicaragua's Contra
rebels. The new Bush administration should instead focus its first
attention on working with neighboring countries in Central America
to make sure the leftist Sandinista government lives up to promises
made to its neighbors in a regional peace plan, he said.
   _ He will introduce early in the 101st Congress legislation that
would provide for a broad new program of voluntary national service
for young Americans beginning at age 18. The incoming Senate
majority leader, George Mitchell of Maine, ``wants to make that one
of the top priorities for the Democratic majority,'' Nunn said,
adding he expects substantial Republican support as well.
   Nunn said he hoped the idea, which would include both military
and civilian service and encompass expanded VISTA and Peace Corps
programs, could be enacted into law within two years.

<HEAD>Kemp Has Worked to Keep Urban Problems, Minorities on GOP Agenda</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jack Kemp, the California football player
turned New York congressman, may bring strong new visibility to the
Department of Housing and Urban Development and to the problems
plaguing the nation's cities.
   Kemp talked about ``progressive conservatism'' and sought to
expand his party's appeal among blacks and other minorities as a
candidate for the Republican presidential nomination in 1988.
   As a congressman, he was an advocate of the supply-side economics
and tax cuts that President Reagan embraced. He pushed for tax
incentives to promote development in blighted urban neighborhoods,
and for a program enabling public housing tenants to buy their homes.
   His presidential candidacy proved a flop _ he didn't win a
primary and never scored better than 13 percent of the vote. But
Kemp remained a leading figure among the Republican Party's most
conservative wing at the end of the Reagan era.
   ``I know we didn't win, but if you look at the Republican
platform today ... there's no one who can say we're not winning in
the Republican Party,'' Kemp told supporters in New Orleans during
the Republican National Convention.
   Kemp, 53, was named today by President-elect Bush to join his
Cabinet as HUD secretary.
   He follows Samuel Pierce, a black who survived in the job
throughout all eight years of the Reagan administration _ and who
did so by keeping the lowest of profiles. Even his boss, President
Reagan, once failed to recognize his own Cabinet member and mistook
Pierce for a mayor.
   Although Kemp's strongly conservative ideology is not shared by
most of the mayors of the nation's big cities, his appointment
immediately met bipartisan support.
   Urban advocates believe Kemp's forcefulness and vivid political
profile will bring new attention to the miseries of inner cities _
drugs, poverty, violence and despair _ even if he does not become an
advocate for the increased federal aid they seek.
   ``While there's no question a lot of mayors were in the running,
we do have an elected official who will bring a visibility to issues
that hasn't been there before,'' said Tom Cochran, executive
director of the U.S. Conference of Mayors. ``HUD's going to be on
the front burner again.''
   The concern of urban advocates, however, is that Kemp's plans for
urban ``enterprise zones,'' based on tax incentives, and for tenant
ownership, would supplement and not replace what remains of the
federal urban aid programs that were cut or killed in the Reagan
years.
   Kemp dropped out of the presidential race in the aftermath of his
final round of poor showings in the big Super Tuesday primaries in
mid-March, the last gasp of a candidacy that never met the
expectations many Republican leaders had set for it.
   He has been a member of Congress since winning election in 1970
from the upstate New York district that includes Buffalo, a blue
collar-region. Kemp decided not to seek re-election, though he could
have after dropping out of the presidential race.
   He was born and educated in California, growing up in Los Angeles
and attending nearby Occidental College, where he played football
and led the nation's small colleges in passing statistics. His
father ran a small trucking firm, and his mother was a social worker.
   Kemp got his start in pro football with the Detroit Lions of the
National Football League in 1957, but he bolted to the new American
Football League and the San Diego Chargers. He was later traded to
the Buffalo Bills, where he built a reputation as a perfectionist
who didn't mind playing hurt and led the team to two league
championships and four division titles.
   He was the league's most valuable player in 1965, and that same
year founded the AFL players association.
   He made his first mark in national politics by helping sell
President Reagan on supply-side economics, the belief that cutting
taxes would ultimately produce more tax revenues. He had worked with
Reagan in California as a member of the govenor's staff.
   His call for cutting taxes 10 percent a year for three years was
embraced by Reagan and adopted in a modified form by Congress. At
the same time, it has been credited both with the longstanding
economic recovery and the nation's federal deficit that mushroomed
in the Reagan years.
   ``Kemp is the guy who persuaded Reagan that supply-side economics
was the way to move, and one can argue these horrendous deficits are
a direct result of Kemp's being wrong,'' John Deardourff, a
Republican consultant, once said.
   Kemp has always based his political appeal on economic growth,
and he was often criticized for a mind-numbing devotion to obscure
economists' language and laments for the abandoned gold standard.
   He once described himself as ``less a candidate than a teacher.''
   He frequently surrounded himself at public appearances with black
or Hispanic Republicans, some of them former pro football colleagues.
   While speaking conservative buzz words, he would add his own
concerns about inner cities, minorities, and civil rights.
   ``We've got to have a party that is attractive to minority
Americans,'' Kemp said. ``I'm going to predict ... that by 1992
one-quarter of our party, if we do our job right, will be black,
Hispanic and Asian-American Republicans.''

<TEXT>
   Leaders of Israel's two main political blocs,
Likud and Labor, agreed today to form a coalition government, media
reports said.
   State-run Israel radio and Israel television both reported that
the two parties reached agreement when Likud's Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir agreed to demands by the center-left Labor Party that
Labor be given leadership of the powerful parliament finance
committee.
   Avi Pazner, a top aide to Shamir, said agreement had been reached
on major issues but that the prime minister was still trying to get
smaller religious and nationalist parties to join a broad coalition.
   ``We cannot drink `L'chaim' yet,'' he said, referring to the
traditional Hebrew toast meaning ``to life.''
   Israel army radio said the agreement _ seven weeks after
parliamentary elections _ was reached in a meeting between
negotiators Dan Meridor of the right-wing Likud and Moshe Shahal of
Labor.
   It said Labor and Likud also settled a dispute over how many
Jewish settlements would be built in the occupied West Bank and Gaza
Strip, agreeing on a figure of five to eight new settlements in the
next year.
   Labor had been trying to hold down settlements because they could
be an obstacle to the party's plan to trade land for peace with the
Palestinians. Likud had promised as many as 40 settlements to a
nationalist party it was trying to lure into a coalition.
   The army radio report said any settlements after the first year
would have to be approved by the Finance Ministry, which would be
headed by Labor leader Shimon Peres, now the foreign minister.
   Peres agreed to the lesser post of finance minister in the new
government on the condition his party could also chair the
parliament finance committee, giving Labor virtual control over the
country's spending.
   The TV report said that the agreement gave Shamir the right to
approve which Labor member would head the committee.
   Roni Milo, deputy prime minister and an aide to Shamir, said
meetings would be held tonight with religious parties.
   Earlier today, both Shamir and Peres said a new government would
be formed by tonight, either with or without Labor.
   Likud has been trying to form a broad-based coalition with Labor
to avoid having to make concessions on religious issues to the
Orthodox parties. At the same time, it has been negotiating with
likely allies in a narrow government with the smaller parties.
   Within Labor, meanwhile, a group of dovish members called on
party leaders not to join a coalition government if that government
rules out talks with the Palestine Liberation Organization.
   But most of the members of Labor's ``Peace Forum'' said at a
meeting Sunday that the PLO would have to prove its verbal
renunciation of terror with action before the organization becomes
an acceptable partner for peace talks.
   Israeli law now bans contacts with the PLO, which the country
views as a terrorist group. Last week the United States reversed a
ban on contacts with the PLO after the organization's chief Yasser
Arafat made statements recognizing Israel and renouncing terrorism.
   This weekend, a chief PLO official said the PLO's renunciation of
terror did not include atttacks on Israeli military targets.
   Coalition negotiations have been under way since Nov. 1 elections
gave neither Likud nor Labor a clear mandate. Likud won 40 seats in
the 120-member parliament and Labor 39, with the rest split among
small parties.
   The latest impasse arose over Likud's reported promise to the
nationalistic Tehiya party to build 40 new settlements in the
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip during the government's four-year
tenure.
   Labor said it would agreed to build five to seven Jewish
settlements, Labor minister Chaim Bar-Lev told Israel radio.
   Labor, which has been pushing for an international conference on
a Middle East peace, has resisted building more settlements in
occupied land that might be given up in a peace agreement. U.S.
officials have called the settlements an obstacle to peace.
   Negotiators for Labor and Likud have reportedly agreed Shamir
would lead the proposed government for its full tenure and would not
rotate his position with Peres, as he did in the so-called unity
government that both parties have led since 1984.
   Peres would serve as finance minister while Rabin would retain
the defense ministry. Likud member Moshe Arens, a former defense
minister, would serve as foreign minister.
   In the proposed joint government, the two parties would have an
equal number of ministers in the decision-making Inner Cabinet.

   President-elect Bush today named Rep. Jack
Kemp, once a combative campaign rival, to head the Department of
Housing and Urban Development in the new administration.
   Bush hailed Kemp for his role in passing the income tax cuts of
the Reagan administration, and said he was one of the ``premier
architects of the opportunity society that we are trying to create.''
   Kemp thanked Bush for the appointment, and said he would seek a
public-private partnership to ``wage war on poverty.'' He
paraphrased the late civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr,
saying he has an ``audacious faith'' in the nation's ability to
restore hope to ``distressed inner cities and those who live in
poverty and despair.''
   The New York congressman, known for holding strong views and
expressing them freely, pledged to be a ``good team player'' and
stick to his own portfolio. ``I'm not going to speak on foreign
policy'' during Cabinet meetings, he said.
   Aside from Kemp, transition sources said Bush has decided on
Chicago mass-transit official Samuel Skinner as transportation
secretary and said that appointment may come as soon as Tuesday. The
leading candidate for secretary of health and human services remains
Louis Sullivan, the Morehouse Medical School president who would
become Bush's first black Cabinet appointment.
   However, Kemp's appointment was the only one announced by Bush at
a morning appearance before reporters.
   Remaining at the microphone to field questions on other topics,
the president-elect said he would take an intolerant view of any
acts of terrorism by the Palestine Liberation Organization, which
has renounced such acts as the price for diplomatic discussions with
the Reagan administration.
   ``We would not start off by showing any tolerance of PLO terror
and I don't care if it comes from a faction of the left or right or
the center or whatever. ... I am concerned about it; I have been and
will continue to be concerned about it,'' Bush said.
   The president-elect seemed at ease as he fielded questions, even
as he avoided giving answers to some. When a reporter said he was
dancing around the issue of how much to spend for homelessness, Bush
replied, ``Yes, I wouldn't have phrased it that way but that's
exactly what I've been doing.''
   He added that he doesn't believe commitment to solving a problem
is measured solely in terms of federal spending. ``There are other
ways to skin a cat,'' he said.
   Bush shed little light on the appointments still to be made, but
said he wants an energy secretary knowledgeable about nuclear issues
who can help increase the use of nuclear power.
   Kemp's appointment was the eighth Bush has made for his Cabinet,
with six more to go. The president-elect has said he hopes to
complete the task before the Christmas holidays.
   Kemp was known as one of the most ardent adherents to the supply
side theory of economics that President Reagan pursued, highlighted
by the large income tax cuts of 1981. When the federal deficit
ballooned, Kemp astounded fellow Republicans by declaring the
deficit didn't count.
   Bush said Kemp was ``an idea man,'' and said his innovative ideas
were needed to solve problems in housing and other areas.
   In their prepared remarks, Bush and Kemp skipped over their
one-time campaign rivalry. Kemp had sought the presidential
nomination with an appeal to bedrock conservative issues, and he had
said often that Bush would raise taxes despite Bush's campaign-long
pledge not to do so.
   The president-elect said ``it doesn't concern me at all'' that
Kemp might still have national political ambitions of his own. He
said Kemp was a man of ``total honor and integrity.''
   Asked if he had assurances that Kemp would shed his critic's
role, Bush said, ``I hope he hasn't shed it. ... I want the
objectivity of his judgment, and knowing Jack I'll get it.''
   When asked about his own future political plans, Kemp said, ``I
haven't ruled out seeking office some day, nor have I ruled it in.''
   Kemp said is is ``absolutely necessary, and possible I believe,
to gain consensus on a public-private enterprise partnership to wage
war on poverty.'' Kemp has called previously for programs allowing
public housing tenants to own their own homes, and has long been a
champion of so-called ``urban enterprise zones'' in which
government-private programs would be developed to revitalize
depressed cities.
   Kemp, 53, a former professional football player, served 18 years
in Congress from a Buffalo, N.Y., district before seeking the
Republican presidential nomination earlier this year.
   He faltered in the early contests and was gone from the race by
spring. But during his brief candidacy, he did what he could to
question Bush's commitment to anti-tax policies. Kemp said
frequently that if the voters wanted to raise taxes, they should
vote for either Bush or another rival, Sen. Bob Dole.
   Even so, he hinted broadly in withdrawing from the presidential
race last spring that he wanted to be considered for the Republican
vice presidential nomination.
   Bush passed him by in favor of Sen. Dan Quayle, and Kemp later
announced he would take a senior position with the Heritage
Foundation, a private, conservative research organization in
Washington.
   In his 18 years in Congress, Kemp has carved out a reputation not
only for his anti-tax, supply-side economic policies, but also for
his efforts to appeal to black voters. His decision to quote the
late civil rights leader King in his brief remarks was evidence of
that.

   About 50,000 refugees from fighting
between soldiers and rebels in northern Uganda urgently need food, a
government newspaper reported Monday.
   There are 130,000 displaced people in the Gulu area about 200
miles north of Kampala, and the number is rising because of fighting
between the National Resistance Army and remnants of the rebel Holy
Spirit movement, the New Vision newspaper said.
   President Yoweri Museveni's government is receiving food aid from
the California-based humanitarian World Vision International and the
Red Cross.
   The government's offensive against the Holy Spirit movement began
in September.
   The movement was founded in 1986 by Alice Lakwena, a
self-proclaimed warrior priestess. She fled to neighboring Kenya in
1987 after the government killed most of her followers, once
estimated at 7,000 people.
   Her poorly equipped followers went to battle believing the oil
she smeared on their chests would ward off bullets and the stones
she gave them would explode like grenades.

   Lavish gift-giving is a Japanese custom that Nanuli

familiar with.
   She visited a pearl shop Monday while her husband, Eduard
Shevardnadze, opened the first Japan-Soviet foreign ministerial
talks in nearly three years. And she received a pearl necklace worth
about $24,000, Kyodo News Service reported.
   Mrs. Shevardnadze started her first full day in Tokyo with a
visit to the posh Tasaki Pearl Gallery in Tokyo's Akasaka,
accompanied by her hostess, Chiyo Uno, wife of Foreign Minister
Sousuke Uno.
   Shigeo Maruyama, an employee of the shop owned by the Tasaki
Shinju Co., said Mrs. Shevardnadze saw a demonstration of how pearls
are extracted from shells.
   At the end of her visit, Shunsaku Tasaki, president of the
company, presented Mrs. Shevardnadze with the necklace, Maruyama
said.
   Although the employee refused to confirm the exact price of the
necklace, he said the figure reported by Kyodo was ``probably
right.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Friendly acquisitions of U.S. companies by
foreign investors are on the rise, but hostile takeovers by
foreigners are still rare, a congressional report says.
   The General Accounting Office, the investigative and auditing
agency of Congress, said foreign acquisitions as a share of all
takeovers has increased from 6 percent in 1984 to 9 percent last
year to 13 percent in the first half of this year.
   However, of the 1,281 foreign takeovers during the 4{-year
period, only 17 were hostile, or resisted by the target company's
board of directors, the GAO said in a letter to Rep. Byron L.
Dorgan, D-N.D.
   Dorgan, a member of the tax-writing House Ways and Means
Committee who has proposed tax measures designed to curb hostile
takeovers, said in an interview Monday that he is concerned by both
the increase in hostile mergers generally and by increasing foreign
investment in the United States.
   The steady rise until last year of the U.S. trade deficit has put
more dollars in the hands of foreigners, who have in turn spent them
on investments in the United States.
   Much of the foreign investment has been in real estate and
government securities, but Dorgan said the GAO's figures indicate
that foreigners also are buying up U.S. corporations.
   ``I think that raises some general policy questions that Congress
has to address. ... If you have broad foreign ownership of American
assets, the question is, Who are Americans working for? Where is the
income stream from those assets directed?'' Dorgan said.
   Other economic observers, among them Federal Reserve Board
Chairman Alan Greenspan, say foreign investment can be seen as a
vote of confidence in the strength of the U.S. economy. They point
out that foreign investment in American firms creates jobs for U.S.
citizens.
   Between 1984 and mid-1988, there were 25 attempted hostile
takeovers by foreigners, and 17 of them were successful. That
compares with a total of 77 hostile takeovers out of 191 attempts.
   Dorgan said the relative success rates _ 68 percent for foreign
hostile bids versus 40 percent for contested bids generally _
indicate that foreign tax laws or some difference in regulation may
give foreign bidders an advantage over U.S. bidders.
   British firms accounted for eight of the 17 foreign unfriendly
mergers. Three were by Canadian companies, two by French firms and
one each by Dutch, Japanese, Swedish and Swiss investors.

   Under threats of a lawsuit by a minister,
selectmen removed a cross that had sat atop the fire station every
Christmas since 1979 and replaced it with a star.
   Edward Berlin, a lawyer for Rev. Randall Gibson, and another
attorney for the Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts had given
the town a deadline of 5 p.m. Sunday to remove the cross or be taken
to court.
   ``It was never put up there to offend anyone. ... It was a cross
to commemorate Christmas,'' said Charles Baker, head of the town
board of selectmen.
   Baker said the cross was replaced with a star because a star has
no specific religious significance.
   Gibson, a Unitarian Universalist minister, said he was not
opposed to the Christian religious symbol of the cross but called it
an affront to non-Christians.
   About 150 townspeople had signed a petition asking that the cross
stay.

<HEAD>Spokesman Denies Bush Talked of Adminstration Spot With TV Preacher
Jim Bakker</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: CORRECTS 2nd graf to indicate Fitzwater not yet Bush spokesman</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater today
denied reports that President-elect Bush discussed the possibility
of an administration job with TV evangelist Jim Bakker during a 1985
meeting.
   ``He met with him, I was there, great meeting, just like hundreds
of other meetings he had with people who he was seeking their
support,'' said Fitzwater who will serve Bush in the White House
spokesman capacity that he now holds under President Reagan.
   Fitzwater initially told a White House briefing today that Bush
``was seeking his support for the campaign, absolutely ... You have
hundreds of meetings like that when you're running for president.''
   But the spokesman subsequently said he had misspoken and that
Bush did not solicit campaign support from Bakker.
   Fitzwater told reporters at the briefing:
   ``I don't know what Bakker thought. There was no talk of jobs or
payoffs or anything else. It was a simple meeting as the vice
president had with hundreds of other people and individuals asking
their support ... Asking his support for various policies and so
forth.
   ``They talked about their Christian beliefs. They talked about
the Robertson campaign. It was just a friendly discussion.''
   At the time that Bush met with Bakker and his wife Tammy Faye in
November 1985, Fitzwater was Bush's vice presidential press
secretary. Bush was gearing up for his presidential run, as was TV
evangelist Pat Robertson, whom Bush ultimately defeated resoundingly
in the Republican primaries.
   In March 1987, Bakker stepped down from his PTL ministry,
admitting he had had a sexual involvement with former church
secretary Jessica Hahn.
   Bush's ties to the fallen broadcast preacher through the 1985
meeting and through three close Bush associates who also were hired
by Bakker as consultants were the subject of a story in Sunday's
opinion section of The Washington Post.
   Fitzwater characterized as mostly accurate the story, which
detailed the Bakker employment of Bush's former press secretary Pete
Teeley, and Bush campaign religious liaison Doug Wead, and Dean
Burch, former head of the Federal Communications Commission and the
Republican National Committee.
   Fitzwater said he had no quarrel with the story, ``except the
innuendo there was something wrong with it,''
   He said however there was no talk of Bakker taking an
administration job, as was alleged by Bakker's former personal
bodyguard Don Hardister, according to the Post.
   Teeley told The Associated Press on Sunday that after leaving
Bush's staff, he had worked for Bakker as a marketing consultant
beginning in 1985, but that he had not set up the Bush-Bakker
meeting.
   ``I have a very hard set rule: I don't lobby Bush,'' because of
their longtime personal relationship, Teeley said.
   His work for Bakker never had anything to do with Bush, said
Teeley, whose association with Bakker ended with Bakker's troubles
last year. Teeley also was Bush's campaign press secretary for a
time.
   Fitzwater said he knew nothing about allegations that political
pressure caused the Justice Department in 1983 to drop a Federal
Communications Commission-inspired probe into Bakker's fund-raising
practices.

   A postal worker who took a hostage and wounded
three people during a siege at the post office last week was ordered
Monday to remain in jail without bond until a grand jury takes up
his case in January.
   Warren Murphy, 40, who was arrested Thursday after a 13-hour
standoff, said little during the brief appearance before U.S.
Magistrate Michaelle Wynne.
   John Craft, the public defender, stipulated that a psychiatric
examination last week had found Murphy was a danger to himself and
the public.
   Murphy is being held on a general charge of assault with intent
to commit murder in a government building. Lance Africk, a federal
prosecutor, said several specific charges could come out of the
grand jury, such as kidnapping, taking a hostage, or using a gun on
federal property.

   A man pleaded guilty today to the sexual
torture and murder of five men and was sentenced to life in prison.
   Robert Berdella, already sentenced to life plus seven years for
sexually torturing, beating and injecting a man in a separate case,
described the killings during a 90-minute court hearing.
   Berdella, 39, pleaded guilty to first-degree murder in the death
of Robert Sheldon, 23, of Arleta, Calif., testifying that he put a
plastic trash bag over his head and tied it with a rope until
Sheldon suffocated.
   Berdella testified that Todd Stoops, then 24, died of a loss of
blood.
   He said Jerry Howell, Walter Ferris and Mark Wallace died because
they could not breathe after he injected them with drugs and gagged
them while they were tied to a bed in his midtown Kansas City home.
   Berdella was sentenced to life in prison without the chance of
parole on the first charge and life in prison for the other four
counts of second-degree murder.
   Berdella, an art collector and operator of a shop that sold art
objects and antiques, became a household name in Kansas City after
his arrest in April after a man wearing only a dog collar ran
screaming from his midtown house.
   The man told authorities he had been sexually tortured, beaten
and injected with drugs by Berdella.
   ``I kept him bound to a bed with ropes tying his hands and
feet,'' Berdella said when he pleaded guilty.
   The arrest, followed by days of digging in Berdella's yard and
searching his rambling house, resulted in the discovery of two
skulls on Berdella's property and hundreds of photographs depicting
nude and sometimes unconscious men.
   Sheldon's skull was found buried on Berdella's property. No
mention was made of where the rest of his remains or the bodies of
the others were.
   ``I tied his hands and feet on the bed,'' Berdella testified
about the death of Howell, who was 19 when he disappeared in 1984.
``I injected drugs into his body and gagged him. Apparently the
combination of drugs and the gag made it impossible for him to
breathe.''
   Ferris was 25 when he was last seen in 1985.
   Relatives of some victims attended the hearing after private
meetings with Jackson County Prosecutor Albert Riederer.

   A lawyer warned today that upholding
Dartmouth College's suspension of two former student editors of a
conservative newspaper would stifle freedom of expression on
campuses nationwide.
   But a lawyer for the Ivy League college said the suspensions of
the two white students for harassing a black professor ``is a simple
case of student misconduct. ... This is not a case which involves
their right to publish.''
   The claims came in opening arguments on a bid by John Sutter, 22,
and Christopher Baldwin, 21, for a court order reinstating the two.
   Grafton County Superior Court Judge Bruce Mohl will decide
whether they should be allowed to return to classes next month
rather than in September, when their 18-month suspensions expire.
   The hearing also will give a first reading of how the court will
treat a lawsuit filed by the two and another Dartmouth Review
staffer claiming the college discriminates against conservatives.
   Jack Middleton, Dartmouth's lawyer, argued that ``freedom of
expression exists on the Dartmouth campus for all members of the
community, not just the Dartmouth Review,'' a student-run,
off-campus weekly.
   But Harvey Myerson, lawyer for the ousted students, called the
case ``a signal unmistakable to the student body and those connected
with it and the student bodies across the country that `you will do
as we wish or you will not do it at all.'''
   Sutter, of St. Louis, and Baldwin, of Hinsdale, Ill., were
suspended in March by a campuswide disciplinary panel for harassing
William Cole. A third student got a shorter suspension and fourth
probation for a classroom clash in February with Cole, one of whose
music courses was panned by the Review as ``one of Dartmouth's most
academically deficient.''

<HEAD>Report Says Federal AIDS Awareness Program Got Off to Slow Start</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The AIDS education program conducted by the
federal Centers for Disease Control has been marred by delays in
mass mailings and by limited broadcasts of public service ads, a
congressional report said Monday.
   The report from the General Accounting Office, the investigative
arm of Congress, also said callers may find it difficult to get
through to an AIDS telephone hotline.
   The GAO said that even though the CDC's AIDS education budget
increased from about $17 million in fiscal 1985 to nearly $210
million in 1988, ``its efforts to focus national attention on AIDS
prevention were impaired by the slow implementation of key
activities aimed at the general public.''
   Rep. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., who requested the GAO
investigation, said she would forward a copy of the report to
President-elect Bush for use as ``a guide on how not to implement
health education programs.''
   GAO found several problems associated with ``AIDS Awareness and
Prevention Month'' in October 1987. The center in May 1987 chose
that month for its big push but was unable to get clearance from the
White House Domestic Policy Council for the centerpiece of the
campaign _ a national AIDS information mailing to all households.
   Plans for the mailing, which had been explicitly sought but not
required by Congress, were dropped in July 1987, the GAO report
said. The following year, Congress made the mailing mandatory, and
the pamphlet ``Understanding AIDS'' was mailed last June.
   CDC produced 38 public service announcements on AIDS and
distributed them to the major television networks on Sept. 30, 1987,
the report said, but there was only one airing by a network during
the following ``AIDS Awareness' month. The three networks did air
CDC public service announcements six times in November 1987.
   When ads did air, they were not likely to be seen by many people.
Between December 1987 and February 1988, GAO reported, nearly 90
percent of all network-aired AIDS public service announcements were
shown during non-primetime viewing hours. Nearly 60 percent were
shown between 11 p.m. and 7 a.m., GAO said.
   The report also cited problems, largely corrected by last summer,
of getting through to an AIDS hotline. CDC expanded the hotline from
17 lines to 68 lines in October 1987 as part of its ``awareness
month'' activities, but the monthly busy signal percentage was far
higher than the 3 percent maximum specified in its contract.
   Between October and December 1987, GAO said, the average busy
signal rates on operator-assisted lines ranged from 38 percent to 65
percent. By last summer, however, the rate was down to 7 percent.
Busy signals are still a problem immediately after public service
announcements are aired and CDC is working to correct the situation,
GAO said.
   The watchdog agency said it also found that the AIDS Information
Clearinghouse, a CDC contractor, was taking twice as long as it
should have to send out copies of a pamphlet called ``What You
Should Know About AIDS'' when investigators sought them last January
and Feburary. But another order in March arrived within the six-day
period required by contract.
   Boxer criticized the Reagan administration for failing to provide
leadership in the AIDS crisis, particularly in educating Americans,
and also said she was disturbed by ``this poor response by the media
to provide frequent AIDS education messages.''
   Boxer chairs the AIDS Task Force of the House Budget Committee.
Last year she urged the TV networks to reconsider their refusal to
air the CDC's education messages, which discussed condoms as a means
of preventing the spread of AIDS.

   A gas cylinder exploded on a passenger train
and started a fire Monday, killing eight people and injuring 28,
police said.
   The blast occurred on the express train from Cairo to the
Mediterranean port of Alexandria, according to police sources, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The train was near the village of Etay el-Baroud, about 70 miles
northwest of Cairo when the explosion occurred in the cafeteria
section of the train's third-class compartments, the sources said.
Three cars were burned.
   A preliminary investigation found that boiling water overflowed,
extinguishing the flame on a stove. When a cafeteria attendant tried
to relight it, the gas cylinder exploded. The attendant was
arrested, the police said.

   Members of the Electoral College, which
includes George Bush's son Neil and brother Prescott, voted today to
formally elect Bush President, fulfilling an antiquated but
surviving constitutional ritual.
   ``It was a nice honor, to get to cast a vote for my dad,'' Neil
Bush, a Denver oilman, said before performing his duty in Colorado
as one of the nation's 538 electors. ``It'll be nice to be a small
footnote in history.''
   Prescott Bush and seven other electors voted for the Republican
ticket in Connecticut.
   In state capitals across the nation, designated electors were
meeting to carry out their constitutional obligation and cast their
electoral ballots.
   Some states had brief ceremonies steeped in history, while others
made a party of the event.
   There were no surprises among electors in the first group of
states to conduct the balloting.
   In Minnesota, electors went to a long brunch before casting their
ballots. In Illinois, the 24 electors cast their votes for the
Republicans, as expected, and placed their ballots in a wooden
ballot box used by Abraham Lincoln when he voted in the election of
1860.
   ``Without doubt it's one of the most misunderstood things in all
of government and politics,'' said Illinois elector Ray LaHood.
   Electors cast separate votes for president and vice president.
   Among the first to vote was Indiana, where all 12 electors cast
their votes for Bush and for native son Dan Quayle as vice president.
   ``It's certainly appropriate,'' said David L. Daugherty, the
elector from the same Huntington County, Indiana, where Quayle is
from. ``I've known him for about 20 years.''
   The voting today sets the stage for the final ceremony in a joint
session of Congress on Jan. 4, when Vice President Bush, as
president of the Senate, will open the ballots and announce the
results _ and formally declare himself the president-elect.
   Supervising the state electoral voting are officials at the
National Archives in Washington. Although officials do not monitor
the outcome of the voting, attorney Mike White said his office had
received phone calls from secretaries of state in two states asking
about procedures to name substitute electors.
   ``We probably will only have a few states having problems,''
White said.
   The ritual is something of an anticlimax to the long presidential
year.
   Bush defeated Democrat Michael Dukakis in the general election
with 53 percent of the more than 91 million votes cast and carrying
enough states to win 426 electoral votes to Dukakis' 112.
   That should be the vote after today's meetings, give or take a
``faithless elector'' or two, should there be any.
   The electors were selected by the parties in each state _ one for
each congressman and senator the state has. Votes cast for president
in each state in fact were votes for the Republican or Democratic
slate of electors.
   By law the states must hold their electoral meetings today,
though the time and setting is up to each state. Many hold it in
state Capitol buildings.
   Among others with the duty were Bush's designated White House
chief of staff, New Hampshire Gov. John Sununu. Penn State football
coach Joe Paterno, who seconded Bush's nomination at the Republican
National Convention, was a Pennsylvania elector.
   But most were state party workers or insiders rewarded for their
labors, and state officeholders, such as California Gov. George
Deukmejian and Alabama Gov. Guy Hunt.
   Electors are expected to vote for their party's presidential
nominee, and vice presidential nominee. But in this unique American
system, the Constitution doesn't require it.
   About half the states have laws that require electors to vote as
pledged, but constitutional experts question whether those laws
could be enforced.
   Before today, eight electors over the years have broken their
pledges and voted for someone else.
   A Minnesota elector, Bill Davis, treasurer of the state
Democratic-Farm-Labor Party, had said he might cast a symbolic vote
this year for Jesse Jackson for vice president instead of Democratic
Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, the party's nominee.
   With the furor over Dan Quayle's selection as Bush's Republican
vice presidential running mate still fresh in memory, some electors
have been getting letters urging them to ``Dump Quayle'' and cast

   The Defense Department is about to launch a new
research effort to improve the ``definition'' or clarity of
television screen pictures and in the process, hopefully bolster the
American TV manufacturing industry.
   The department, in a brief statement, said its Defense Advanced
Research Projects Agency hoped in the next two to three weeks to
solicit contract proposals ``in the areas of high-definition,
low-cost display technology ...''
   The Pentagon's primary goal is the development of an advanced,
but small, TV-type screen or monitor that can display text,
characters or video signals with great clarity, said spokeswoman Jan
Bodanyi.
   The monitors would be used inside new helicopters and airplanes,
training simulators and other types of vehicles and command centers.
   The Defense Department also hopes, however, that by providing
seed money for new research, it can enlist electronic and
semiconductor companies to fight Japan for the lead in developing
the next generation of TV sets for commercial use.
   High-definition television, or HDTV, offers the promise of
sharper, brighter and wider pictures that could match the quality of
motion picture films. Japanese industry has developed an HDTV system
and plans to begin marketing it in 1990.
   A consortium of European firms also is thought to be ahead of
American industry in exploring the new technology.
   Pentagon officials say they hope that by prodding research in the
field of high-definition monitors, the government also can
ultimately spur domestic manufacturing of semiconductors, the
electronic chips at the heart of computers.
   The HDTV technology will require extensive use of semiconductors
and that could provide the incentive needed by domestic companies to
re-enter the semiconductor market, said one official, who asked not
to be identified.
   The source added the Zenith Electronics Corp., which remains
U.S.-owned, is almost sure to be included in the DARPA effort.
Zenith already has asked for a $15 million contract to develop what
it calls flat tension mask technology.
   The flat tension mask resembles a conventional TV picture tube
but has a flat face that is sharper and much more rugged, which
would make it attractive for battlefield use.
   ``But this won't be a one-company effort,'' added the source.
   The Pentagon, in its statement, said DARPA had been working in
the arena of high-definition monitors for years ``and where
practical, will conform to evolving commercial HDTV standards.''
   ``A technology base common to defense and commercial needs
benefits DOD as lower unit prices result from large-scale
production,'' the statement added.
   ``HDTV and computers share ... a common dependence on
semiconductors. DOD has an interest in maintaining a robust U.S.
semiconductor industry so as to assure a domestic source of the most
advanced microelectronic products.''
   The Washington Post first reported on the TV research project in
Monday editions.

   A fire department medical truck hit an
8-year-old boy who darted between parked cars, but the driver saved
the boy's life by resuscitating him, officials said.
   Thomas Adkins, 8, was injured so severely in Saturday's accident
that he went into cardiac arrest, police said.
   The driver, Gary E. Warren, 36, the second in command of the
Baltimore County Fire Department's medical division, administered
cardiopulmonary resuscitation and saved the child's life, police
said.
   The boy was reported in stable condition Monday at Johns Hopkins
Hospital. He sustained two broken legs, a broken collarbone, head
and stomach trauma and bruised lungs.
   Warren was ticketed for driving 43 mph in a 25 mph zone.
   ``He had been through a lot in the emergency medical technician
field,'' said Officer John Emerick of the police traffic
investigation unit. ``But actually hitting that child accidentally
really tore him up.''

   Elizabeth Taylor, President-elect George Bush,
heavyweight champ Mike Tyson and Pakistan Prime Minister Benazir
Bhutto are on People magazine's roster of ``the 25 most intriguing
people of 1988.''
   So, too, are two unforgettable personalities who don't quite
qualify as people _ Jessica Rabbit, the sexy and sultry femme fatale
of the movie ``Who Framed Roger Rabbit,'' and the Phantom of the
Broadway musical ``The Phantom of the Opera.''
   Elizabeth Taylor was called ``the Cleopatra of our age'' and the
35-year-old Bhutto was recognized for being the first female prime
minister in the Moslem world.
   The magazine said Tyson, 22, ``vanquishes all comers in the ring
only to lose badly in love'' _ a reference to his marital
difficulties with actress Robin Givens.
   Other people on the magazine's year-end list included Los Angeles
Dodger pitcher Orel Hershiser, 30, who pitched 59 consecutive
scoreless innings in the regular season. ``He never gives in, never
backs down,'' said the magazine.
   Kevin Costner, 33, a catcher in the movie ``Bull Durham,'' was
said to have ``pulled off the triple play of the year'' by appealing
to women, being admired by men and earning praise from critics.

   Brit Hume, the heir apparent to Sam
Donaldson's White House beat for ABC News, had a rocky start as a
newscaster, according to the Dec. 24 issue of TV Guide magazine.
   Hume began appearing on camera regularly in 1976 after working as
an investigative reporter in Washington for syndicated columnist
Jack Anderson.
   ``Brit's transition to television was slightly painful,'' said
George Watson, now Washington bureau chief for ABC News. ``I recall
getting calls from anguished producers downstairs saying they
couldn't put him on camera because he couldn't stand up straight and
he sounded like he had marbles in his mouth.''
   Next month, Donaldson is expected to announce whether he will
walk away from the White House beat, a move that could give the
45-year-old Hume's career another boost.
   ``Covering the White House is probably something every Washington
correspondent has to face sooner or later,'' Hume said.

   Authorities have issued arrest warrants
for two police officers supected of involvement in a prostitution
ring that sold Thai women to Japanese employers, police said Monday.
   More than 10 other Bangkok-based groups, including airlines
officials and businessmen, were involved in the ring linked to
organized crime in Singapore and Malaysia, said a senior police
official.
   Police issued warrants last month for Capt. Suplin Sukkasee and
Lt. Chamras Kamma, who have agreed to report to authorities for
questioning by Tuesday, said the police official, who requested
anonymity.
   He said the officers were suspected of luring two women to Japan
with the promise of well-paid jobs. The two, who were forced to work
as prostitutes, sought refuge in the Thai Embassy in October, the
official said.
   Thai women aged 20 to 25 were sold to Japanese employers for at
least $16,000 and were expected to earn twice that amount, the
official said.

   President Reagan is preparing to leave office
taking credit for progress in areas ranging from nuclear arms
reduction to deregulation of business. As for things that went
wrong, well, they were somebody else's fault.
   After eight years as governor of California and eight as
president, Reagan's speeches still ring with attacks on governmental
meddling and warnings of the dangers of communist aggression, just
as they did when he was a speaker on behalf of General Electric Co.
before he entered politics.
   In a speech summing up his administration's record on domestic
policy last week, he denounced the Carter administration for saying,
as he phrased it, that ``the nation's problems were too complicated
to manage.''
   ``Well, we said, of course they are _ so government should stop
trying to manage them; stop putting its faith in the false god of
bureaucracy and trust the genius of the American people instead,''
he told an audience of political appointees.
   Two days later, in a speech at the University of Virginia, he
blamed the ``on-again, off-again'' record of Congress for the
failure of his policy of supporting anti-communist rebels in
Nicaragua.
   And on Saturday, he told listeners to his weekly radio address,
``Since Congress changed the budget law (in 1974), federal spending
has in fact quadrupled, and it has come right out of your pocket.''
   In his domestic policy speech on Wednesday, the president said a
``Washington colony,'' operating through an ``iron triangle'' of
members of Congress, the news media and special interest groups, was
stifling efforts to wipe out the budget deficit.
   To some, the ``iron triangle'' phrase was reminiscent of the
speech in 1961 in which Dwight Eisenhower, the last president before
Reagan to complete eight years in office, inveighed against the
power of the ``military-industrial complex.''
   ``He is raising a flag to a system that we are a part of and that
we participate in because that's the way business is done these
days,'' said White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, adding that the
president was sharing ``some of the lessons he's learned from his
eight years.''
   The president acknowledged that he was borrowing the iron
triangle phrase from others who had used it before him. What he
didn't acknowledge was that they used it differently. In the
original version, it described the relationship between
congressional committees, the bureaucracy and interest groups.
Reagan skipped the part that suggested agencies that were part of
his administration might have helped fuel the deficit.
   He also did not say what he meant by a special interest group,
although it's a term he often uses to describe people who are for
things he's against.
   The next event on Reagan's schedule after his ``iron triangle''
speech was a friendly get-together with members of the Business
Government Relations Council, a group of corporate lobbyists.
   Or, some might say, a special interest group.
   In Charlottesville, the president attacked ``the notion that
judgeships should be used to further privately held beliefs not yet
approved by the people.''
   The remark was a new twist. Reagan ran for the White House in
1980 and 1984 on platforms calling for the appointment of judges who
would overturn the Supreme Court's ruling that legalized abortion.
Polls repeatedly have shown that most Americans support that
decision.
   In 1986, the president crisscrossed the country arguing for the
election of a Republican Senate that he said would, among other
things, confirm the kind of federal judges he favors. But when his
nomination of conservative jurist Robert Bork to the Supreme Court
ran into a buzz-saw of opposition, he charged that his opponents
were politicizing the judicial selection process.
   As for foreign policy, the president told the University of
Virginia students, ``It's precisely where Congress and the president
have worked together, as in Afghanistan and Cambodia, or resolved
differences, as in Angola, the Persian Gulf, and many aspects of
U.S.-Soviet relations, precisely there, our policies have succeeded,
and we see progress.
   ``But where Congress and the president have engaged each other as
adversaries, as over Central America, U.S. policies have faltered,
and our common purposes have not been achieved,'' he said.
   The president did not mention Lebanon, where in 1982 the
Republican-controlled Senate and Democratic-controlled House joined
in placing limits on the president's policy of using U.S. Marines to
oversee the withdrawal of Palestinian guerrillas and invading
Israeli troops from Beirut. The Marines were withdrawn after a
suicide car bomber killed 241 of them in 1983.
   Fitzwater, asked about the bombing at his daily news briefing
Monday, said, ``The president has publicly talked about the bombing
as one of his most discouraging and sad moments in office as
president, but I don't believe there is any new information on the
perpetrators.''

   Missouri prison officials today halted
plans to execute an inmate Tuesday in anticipation that a federal
court would block the execution now that he has ordered his appeals
continued.
   An attorney also filed new legal motions with the 8th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals in St. Louis seeking to block the
execution, which would have been Missouri's first since 1965.
   C. John Pleban requested a stay of execution for Gerald Smith,
saying Smith, who previously had abandoned his appeals, wants to
continue his legal challenges.
   Included with the request for a stay was a letter Smith wrote to
the federal appeals court.
   ``I had decided to forego any further review of my cases because
I had lost faith in a judicial system that had failed me for eight
years,'' Smith wrote.
   ``However, due to recent developments on my case, this travesty
can no longer be ignored. And thus it would be an act of suicide for
me to follow through with my execution without having these matters
reviewed,'' Smith wrote.
   The recent developments were apparently a reference to a recent
newspaper article that raised doubts about Smith's guilt.
   Smith faces two separate death warrants _ one for the 1980
bludgeoning death of Karen Roberts and another for the 1985 murder
of fellow inmate Robert Baker.

<HEAD>Judge: Amish Must Display Slow-Moving Signs on Horse-Drawn Buggies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRESTON, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge ruled Monday that Amish people must
display slow-moving vehicle signs on their horse-drawn buggies, but
lawyers said the religious-freedom issue could go all the way to the
U.S. Supreme Court.
   State law requiring the signs does not violate the Amish's First
Amendment right to freedom of religion, Fillmore County District
Judge Clement Snyder said in his ruling.
   Phillip Villaume, an attorney representing the Amish, said the
case will be appealed to the state Court of Appeals.
   Villaume and Fillmore County Assistant Attorney Matt Opat said
the case likely will go to the Minnesota Supreme Court and may end
up in the U.S. Supreme Court.
   Fifteen Amish people appeared before Snyder in October after they
had been ticketed for violating the state regulations. They were
cited for failing to obey a Minnesota law requiring them to display
triangular slow-moving vehicle signs on the rear of their buggies.
During the day, the signs can be black with white reflective tape.
When it is dark or foggy, the signs must be orange.
   Opat argued that prosecuting the Amish for not complying with the
state law was a case of public safety, not religious prosecution. He
said public safety issues significantly outweigh any infringement
the law may have on the Amish's constitutional right of religious
freedom.
   Villaume, of St. Paul, said it was ironic that the Amish, who
settled in the United States in the 1700s to avoid religious
persecution, were still fighting battles to protect their religion.
   A witness for the Amish said they oppose displaying the signs
because they feel the signs are ``worldly'' representations of man,
not God, and they hope to keep their religious practices separate
from the modern world.
   But Opat said the Amish willingly displayed the signs for years,
but then quit displaying them within the past year or two. There
also has been no uniformity among the Amish in Fillmore County, he
said, noting that some display the orange signs, some the black and
white signs and others no signs at all.
   The Amish have regularly used the color red on their barns,
leading the prosecutor to question whether the dispute was really
over religious beliefs. As a result, he said in October, the Amish
have a ``pick-and-choose society.''

   As Christmas approaches, Jens Bernhardt starts
thinking of home on the other side of the dangerous Berlin Wall.
   But the former East German border guard knows there's no going
back after his dramatic July 1987 escape to the West.
   ``Everything, everyone in my family is back there. It was tough
last Christmas. This year it's also going to be hard _ really
hard,'' Bernhardt says.
   While hundreds of East Germans flee to West Germany and West
Berlin over border barriers each year, only a small number return to
their communist homeland, West German officials say.
   For those fearing possible punishment if they return, there are
often pangs of homesickness, especially during the Christmas season.
   Bernhardt, who says he would be prosecuted as a deserter if he
dared to return home, described what it's like to be an East German
escapee unable to be with his family for Christmas.
   ``Last year I decided to do volunteer work during Christmas at
Checkpoint Charlie'' to keep occupied, Bernhardt said in an
interview in West Berlin.
   ``Just sitting around alone _ '' he said, shaking his head
without finishing the sentence as he reflected on another Christmas
away from home.
   Checkpoint Charlie, a crossing between East Berlin and West
Berlin, is tightly controlled by communist troops.
   Bernhardt works full-time on the West Berlin side of the
checkpoint, giving guided tours at a museum devoted to escapees from
East Germany and lecturing student groups on conditions in his
homeland.
   While Bernhardt admits it is hard making contacts in the West as
an outsider, he says he's happy he took the chance.
   ``Even now after more than a year I wake up some mornings and
break out laughing just at the thought of being here,'' Bernhardt
says.
   Bernhardt was a 19-year-old East German border guard when he
climbed down from a guard tower and scrambled over a steel-mesh
fence separating West Berlin's Spandau district from East German
territory near Potsdam.
   Bernhardt said he decided to flee after he was assigned duty as a
border guard and he was faced with shoot-to-kill orders along the
East German-constructed barriers.
   ``There are so many who try to flee, and every DDR (German
Democratic Republic) soldier is afraid they may someday have to
shoot someone escaping. I couldn't come to terms with that,''
Bernhardt said.
   At least 77 people have been killed trying to escape over
communist-built barriers blocking off West Berlin, according to the
Working Group August 13. The human rights organization took its name
from the day East Germany began building the Berlin Wall on Aug. 13,
1961.
   Bernhardt gave a gripping account of his escape to the West.
   ``There were always two guards, but your partner and guard tower
were changed regularly so you didn't get to know each other well
enough to build up trust,'' Bernhardt recalled.
   ``So after planning for two weeks _ I knew I had to do it _ I
waited until my partner fell asleep at 3 a.m.,'' he said.
   After hiding his colleague's ammunition, Bernhardt said he
climbed down from the tower. His knees weak with fright, Bernhardt
crossed the strip of land separating the tower from the 10 foot-high
steel-mesh fence blocking his way to West Berlin.
   ``I was so afraid I would be spotted and shot at from another
tower. My knees were like rubber and I couldn't run. I staggered
like a drunk to that fence and pulled myself over it with metal
hooks I stuck in the holes of the panels,'' Bernhardt said.
   Now, 17 months after his escape, Bernhardt says he's sorry he
worried his parents by fleeing.
   ``I know I caused them anguish, but now they know I'm safe and
I'm sure they're happy for me,'' he said, asking that the names of
his parents and two younger brothers not be used. He said his home
was in the Karl Marx-Stadt area of East Germany, about 25 miles
north of the Czechoslovak border.
   Asked what he would like most for Christmas if he had a choice,
Bernhardt said: ``That no DDR soldier ever again has to shoot
someone going over the border. That the day comes when we can pass
freely through that Wall.''

<DATELINE>SA MAT, Vietnam (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Infantry, armor and artillery units
returned home Monday in a partial Vietnamese withdrawal from
occupied Cambodia, where insurgents are fighting a jungle war
against the Hanoi-supported government.
   Vietnam said the soldiers were leaving western Cambodia on four
land routes and by boat down the Mekong River, and claimed only
50,000 troops would remain to support the client government
established after its December 1978 invasion.
   The Khmer Rouge rulers whose murderous regime Vietnam overthrew a
decade ago have the strongest force in the three-party guerrilla
coalition fighting the occupation army.
   Villagers and children waving Vietnamese and Cambodian flags
lined the red dirt road on which soldiers of the 5th and 309th
Divisions approached and crossed the frontier Monday at Sa Mat.
   Included in columns were Soviet-made trucks towing U.S.
howitzers, and armored personnel carriers captured at the end of the
Vietnam War in 1975. At least one vehicle still carried the horse
emblem of the U.S. 11th armored cavalry.
   Vietnam and the client government it supports in Phnom Penh say
18,000 soldiers will have left Cambodia in a week-long withdrawal
scheduled to end Wednesday.
   Western analysts sometimes said earlier partial withdrawals,
which began in 1982, were only ``troop rotations.'' Americans and
others acknowledge, however, that Hanoi has reduced its strength in
Cambodia substantially from a high of 200,000 soldiers.
   While vehicles moved along the dusty roads, the official
Cambodian news agency SPK said a fleet of nearly 200 vessels
carrying Vietnamese soldiers sailed past Phnom Penh on their way
home.
   It said about 10,000 people, including Cambodian Communist Party
officials and military officers, lined the banks in the early
morning to bid farewell to the soldiers.
   Division commander Col. Nguyen Minh Chau came ashore to shake
hands and the fleet then sailed southward on the 70-mile journey to
the border, the agency said.
   At Sa Mat, an officer commanding three vehicles, told reporters
his unit had seen little action in two years against Khmer Rouge
guerrillas. ``They may attack some of our small units but when they
hear armor coming they disappear,'' Nguyen Van Vinh said.
   Other soldiers also said they had met few guerrillas during a
prolonged lull, which has been confirmed by Western analysts and
interpreted either as the end of the guerrillas or a ``calm before
the storm.''
   Some say the Khmer Rouge, whose strength usually is given as
30,000-40,000, are concentrating on organization, propaganda and
stockpiling weapons as the Vietnamese proceed with a promised
pullout of all forces by 1990.
   Earlier Monday, elements of the two divisions joined in a
farewell ceremony at Kompong Cham, a provincial capital on the
Mekong about 45 miles from the border. A rock band played, thousands
of children lined the roads and commanders laid wreaths at a
monument to the hundreds of thousands of people killed during the
Khmer Rouge's reign of terror in 1975-79.
   Children held up placards reading ``We will think of you always''
as the Vietnamese column rolled through the war-scarred town toward
steel ferries that took them across the river.
   Kompong Cham, once a thriving resort and center of the rubber
trade, was largely destroyed in 1973 when the Khmer Rouge nearly
seized it from the U.S.-backed government of President Lon Nol. It
became a ghost town during Khmer Rouge rule.
   At this border post, the Vietnamese soldiers completed a five-day
trek across Cambodia from bases in Battambang, a province on the
Cambodian border with Thailand.
   Lt. Gen. Nguyen Van Thai, a Vietnamese army spokesman, said about
6,000 soldiers and 300 vehicles were involved.
   About 150 foreign journalists were in Cambodia for the withdrawal.

   Rep. Jack Kemp, named to head George Bush's
Department of Housing and Urban Development, will now have a forum
to keep his own political profile in the public eye.
   Kemp, who fought unsuccessfully for the Republican presidential
nomination, said after Bush introduced him as the HUD choice Monday,
``I haven't ruled out seeking office some day, nor have I ruled it
in.''
   For now, though, Kemp will have a chance to test some long-held
theories for reviving inner cities and will also bring new
visibility to the problems of housing and poverty that plague the
nation's cities.
   A nine-term Republican congressman from a district that includes
part of Buffalo, N.Y., Kemp is still just 53, and the former pro
football quarterback presents a youthful, energetic appearance.
   Bush said he had extracted no promises that his former rival
would not pursue his own political agenda, but ``it doesn't concern
me at all.''
   ``Jack has shifted gears here to be part of our team,'' the
president-elect said.
   Kemp himself said he would keep silent on issues outside his new
assignment. ``I'm not going to speak on foreign policy. ... I'm
going to be a good team player,'' he said.
   As HUD secretary, Kemp will succeed Samuel Pierce, who survived
all eight years of the Reagan administration while keeping the
lowest of profiles. Even President Reagan once mistook Pierce for a
mayor, a mistake Bush won't make about a widely known politician who
is especially popular among conservatives.
   He is best known for his advocacy of ``supply-side econonics,''
including the tax-cutting bill bearing his name that was the heart
of Reaganomics. But his legislative interests were broad.
   He and liberal Bronx Democratic Rep. Robert Garcia formed an
unlikely alliance to push for urban ``enterprise zones,'' a program
of tax breaks to promote development of blighted urban areas. As a
congressman, Kemp couldn't get the bill passed but could try again
in his new position.
   Kemp also introduced legislation to enable residents of federal
low-income housing to buy their homes at below-market prices.
   Although his strongly conservative ideology is not shared by most
of the mayors of the nation's big cities, his appointment was
generally praised.
   ``While there's no question a lot of mayors were in the running,
we do have an elected official who will bring a visibility to issues
that hasn't been there before,'' said Tom Cochran, executive
director of the U.S. Conference of Mayors. ``HUD's going to be on
the front burner again.''
   Jack French Kemp was born in California, grew up in Los Angeles
and attended nearby Occidental College, where he played football and
led the nation's small colleges in passing.
   His father ran a small trucking firm, and his mother was a social
worker.
   Kemp got his start in pro football with the Detroit Lions of the
National Football League in 1957, but he bolted to the new American
Football League and the San Diego Chargers. He was later traded to
the Buffalo Bills for $100, where he built a reputation as a
perfectionist who would play hurt. He led the team to two league
championships and four division titles.
   He was the league's most valuable player in 1965, and that same
year founded the AFL players association.
   Kemp made his first mark in national politics by helping sell
Reagan on supply-side economics, the belief that cutting taxes would
ultimately produce more tax revenues. He had worked with Reagan in
California as a member of the govenor's staff.
   His call for cutting taxes 10 percent a year for three years was
embraced by Reagan and adopted in a modified form by Congress. It
has been credited with bringing about economic recovery but also has
been blamed for pushing the federal budget deficit to record levels
in the Reagan years.
   Kemp dropped out of the presidential race in mid-March, after
poor showings in the big Super Tuesday primaries. He had decided
earlier not to seek re-election to his congressional seat in order
to pursue the presidency.
   In recent months, Kemp appeared to be angling for an
administration job that would keep him in the political arena and
public eye.
   At the Republican Convention in August, he let it be known he
would like to be selected as Bush's vice presidential nominee. He
wasn't.
   Kemp also suggested back then that he'd like to be secretary of
state, or defense, or treasury, but said he didn't think he'd be
offered any of those jobs. He was right.
   In September, the Heritage Foundation, a conservative Washington
research organization, announced Kemp would become one of its
fellows, lecturing and writing about economics and foreign policy.
But Kemp appararently was not content with the prospect of an
ivory-tower future. He said Monday, ``This is far more attractive,
with all due respect.''

<HEAD>Judge Changes Mind, Will Allow AIDS Defendants In Court</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One of three judges who said they would
bar AIDS-infected defendants from their courtroom has changed his
mind, saying he is putting his professional concerns ahead of his
personal beliefs.
   ``If they just want to be there for a fair trial, they got it,''
Jack Montgomery, a Jefferson County district judge, said of
defendants who test positive for the AIDS virus.
   Montgomery and two other Jefferson County district judges, O.L.
``Pete'' Johnson and Mike McCormick, announced last week that they
had barred AIDS-infected defendants from their courtrooms to enter
pleas or to be sentenced.
   Instead, the judges said they would conduct the procedures by
telephone _ a practice each judge carried out once.
   Montgomery said he did not want himself or the people in his
courtroom exposed to defendants harboring the acquired immune
deficiency syndrome virus. Johnson and McCormick said their bailiffs
did not want to handle AIDS-infected defendants.
   The judges' policy sparked complaints from lawyers and civil
libertarians that the defendants' constitutional rights were being
violated. Others were concerned about the image the judges' action
gave Birmingham.
   ``We've been fighting that (bigoted) image for a long time _ we
don't need to fight it again with our judges,'' said Charles
Collins, a board member of Birmingham AIDS Outreach.
   Montgomery said he changed his mind after talking with several
people, including his wife.
   ``My wife called me a big, stupid jerk,'' Montgomery told the
Birmingham Post-Herald in a story published Monday.
   ``I'm putting my professional thoughts above my personal
thoughts'' by allowing AIDS-positive defendants into the courtroom,
he said.
   But Montgomery said that under certain circumstances, such as if
an AIDS-infected defendant is known to be violent, he may hold a
hearing at the jail intead of in court.
   Johnson and McCormick also altered their views somewhat, saying
they will look at each case individually.
   ``If there's evidence that the defendant has a history of
violence, they'll be treated differently than one who doesn't,''
Johnson said. ``But someone won't be necessarily banned from the
courtroom just because he has AIDS.''
   The judges had asked the Birmingham Bar Association and the
American Bar Association for guidelines for dealing with
AIDS-infected defendants. Neither organization had any available.

<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Country music star Johnny Cash underwent
successful coronary bypass surgery Monday in the same hospital where
his friend, Waylon Jennings, was hospitalized for a similar problem,
doctors said.
   ``His surgery went fine,'' said Dr. Robert Hardin, who performed
the operation on Cash with Dr. Kenneth H. Laws. ``There was no
evidence of any damage to his heart.''
   Hardin said that there was 90 percent blockage to the main
coronary artery _ ``a potentially very lethal sort of block.'' There
was also blockage in another artery.
   Alternative blood vessels were used to bypass the blocked
arteries and restore normal blood flow to Cash's heart during the
2{-hour surgery.
   The procedure was ``pretty straightforward coronary artery bypass
surgery'' to prevent the 56-year-old singer from having a heart
attack, Hardin said.
   After the surgery, Cash was in critical but stable condition in
the coronary intensive care unit, a situation that is ``absolutely
standard'' in such cases, said Baptist Hospital spokeswoman Debby
Koch.
   Ms. Koch said doctors have not said when Cash may be moved into a
private room or when he may be released.
   No discharge date has been set for Jennings either. He has sung
with Cash on numerous occasions, and was also in Baptist Hospital on
Monday after undergoing triple bypass surgery Dec. 12.
   Jennings was moved from intensive care to a private room during
the weekend, and doctors hope he will be home for Christmas,
although Ms. Koch said that is not definite.
   Jennings, 51, had been hospitalized for chest pains after a
performance near Los Angeles in October. The chest pains returned
earlier this month as Jennings left Nashville to drive to a
performance in Bristol.

<HEAD>Housing Authority Fights Losing Battle With Vandals, Thieves</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS, La. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   John Gordon and his crew spent four days
renovating a housing project apartment only to have each day's work
undone by thieves who took everything from wiring to the toilet.
Then the maintenance crew gave up.
   The apartment is one of more than 1,100 vacant apartments in the
city's 10 public housing projects. More than 600 people remain on a
waiting list for subsidized housing as New Orleans Housing Authority
officials battle what they say is a wave of drug-related thefts.
   The problem erupted early this year when cocaine began to
flourish in New Orleans at the same time the price of aluminum began
to rise at recycling centers, according to housing authority
officials.
   Aluminum has become a major source of income for drug users,
according to Gordon, a maintenance supervisor for the St. Thomas
project. Window sashes, mail boxes, mail slots, faucet handles _
anything made of aluminum _ brings between 40 cents and 80 cents a
pound.
   Housing authority workers say apathetic tenants and unresponsive
police share part of the blame for the ransacking of vacant units.
   ``There's no involvement by our residents here,'' said Nathaniel
Johnson, manager of the St. Bernard housing project. ``For somebody
to go on a second floor and tote a refrigerator out and put it on a
truck, someone should become somewhat suspicious. But apparently
they don't.''
   When the thefts are reported to police, Johnson said, ``All we
get is an item number and `Good luck getting your item back.'''
   New Orleans police Lt. Yvonne Bechet said there is a three-man
unit assigned to the housing authority, and police respond whenever
they are called. But she said calls to police from the authority are
infrequent.
   She also said residents may be afraid to call police because they
fear retaliation.
   ``They live in a very dense area, very close to those parties
that are committing those acts,'' she said.
   Don England, authority deputy executive officer for management,
said public housing vacancy rates have been reduced from more than
13 percent in July to just under 10 percent in early December. But
vandals make the work slower and more expensive.
   Meanwhile, the homeless, the unemployed and the poor are forced
to wait for public housing.
   In St. Thomas, for example, there are 170 vacant apartments and a
waiting list of 60 renters. In all, New Orleans public housing
developments have 1,124 vacancies and a waiting list of 634
applicants, based on December figures.

<HEAD>Study Urges More Freedom, Higher Pay for Government Researchers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY ESTILL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Institutes of Health will slip
from world-class player to also-ran in biomedical research unless
its leaders are given more freedom from the federal bureauracy, a
government panel said Monday.
   Part of that freedom should translate to higher salaries for top
researchers even if it means fewer employees doing lower-level work,
said Harold T. Shapiro, president of Princeton University and
chairman of the Institute of Medicine study.
   Shapiro emphasized at a news conference that the committee's two
major recommendations _ a call for a $25 million discretionary fund
for the NIH to use to react quickly to unanticipated research
developments, and higher pay at top levels _ could be accomplished
without an overall budget increase.
   While the institutes could use more money, he said, the panel
felt strongly that its suggestions were so important they should be
implemented even if meant shifting funds around, including ``fewer
people better paid.''
   ``It's not easy to do and will take more time'' without budget
increases, said Shapiro.
   Robert G. Petersdorf, president of the Association of American
Medical Colleges and a committee member, agreed that ``you can do a
lot more with the same amount of money'' if administrators are not
bound by congressional directives to maintain a certain number of
full-time employees.
   ``If we don't do this or something similar, we will end up
effectively undermining the effectiveness ... (of NIH) and it will
no longer be a major force in biomedical research,'' said Shapiro.
``It will not be able to be saved if we wake up 15 years down the
line and find that has happened.''
   Shapiro said the panel was not concerned about any quality
decline that has occurred up to now. ``We in some sense wept because
we said more could have been accomplished,'' he said. ``The
domination ... is not what it once was.''
   The report by the Institute of Medicine, which is a branch of the
National Academy of Science, said research at NIH makes ``invaluable
contributions to our knowledge and understanding of basic biological
process and their dysfunction in disease.''
   The report was prompted by a recommendation from the Reagan
administration's Office of Management and Budget that NIH research
be taken from the government and turned over to private companies.
   The committee of scientists said ``privatization, in the sense of
making the intramural (NIH research) program free-standing and
self-supporting, is undesirable and impractical.''
   ``None of the common forms of privatization would be as likely to
sustain the vitality of the research effort as would a more modest
restructuring,'' the report said.
   NIH, based in Bethesda, Md., is a confederation of 12 research
institutes, each dedicated to different diseases, types of disorders
or speciality areas. Basic discoveries made by NIH scientists are
made available to anyone and often form the basis of subsequent
applications developed by researchers at universities and in private
industry.
   Among the report's recommendations were:
   _An increase in salaries for senior researchers who are actively
recruited by universities, hospitals and biotechnology companies
which pay much higher wages. The report said 42 senior scientists in
the highest NIH salary range of between $77,000 and $99,500 were
lured away between 1983 and 1988 by salary increases ranging from 50
to 300 percent.
   _That Congress charter a foundation to allow private support of
up to 10 endowed positions for senior researchers.
   _That NIH be given more authority independent of its parent
agency, the Department of Health and Human Services. The report said
attempts by HHS to ``micromanage'' NIH ``are counterproductive and
cause NIH to be inefficient in carrying out its mission.''
   _That the NIH director receive a $25 million discretionary fund
to be used to respond quickly to research needs without the current
requirement of review by HHS.
   _That a personnel ``demonstration project'' be authorized by
Congress to give NIH flexibility in salaries, benefits and hiring
practices. This would include a limit on personnel costs, instead of
a ceiling on the number of positions, so NIH would have more control
over how its personnel dollars are spent.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here is the text of President Reagan's annual
Christmas message:
   The themes of Christmas and of coming home for the holidays have
long been intertwined in song and story. There is a profound irony
and lesson in this, because Christmas celebrates the coming of a
Savior who was born without a home.
   There was no room at the inn for the holy family. Weary of
travel, a young Mary close to childbirth and her carpenter husband
Joseph found but the rude shelter of a stable. There was born the
King of Kings, the Prince of Peace _ an event on which all history
would turn. Jesus would again be without a home, and more than once;
on the flight to Egypt and during his public ministry, when he said,
``The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have nests; but the
son of man hath not where to lay his head.''
   From his very infancy on, our Redeemer was reminding us that from
then on we would never lack a home in him. Like the shepherds to
whom the angel of the Lord appeared on the first Christmas Day, we
could always say, ``Let us now go even unto Bethlehem, and see this
thing which is come to pass, which the Lord hath made known unto
us.''
   As we come home with gladness of family and friends this
Christmas, let us also remember our neighbors who cannot go home
themselves. Our compassion and concern this Christmas and all year
long will mean much to the hospitalized, the homeless, the
convalescent, the orphaned _ and will surely lead us on our way to
the joy and peace of Bethlehem and the Christ Child who bids us
come. For it is only in finding and living the eternal meaning of
the Nativity that we can be truly happy, truly at peace, truly home.
   Merry Christmas, and God bless you!
   @s@ Ronald Reagan

   A guidebook published by the city's non-profit
tourism bureau is telling visitors to Boston how to get lost.
   The 144-page book, produced by the Greater Boston Convention and
Visitors Bureau, gives the wrong location for many downtown
landmarks.
   Even the Prudential Center, where the book is sold for $2 from
the tourism bureau's office, is identified on the guide's map as
being several blocks from its actual location.
   ``Unfortunately, errors like this happen,'' said Robert Cumings,
president of the bureau, which receives $1 million of its $3 million
budget from the state.
   The bureau was formed to promote tourism, but visitors using the
1988-89 Official Guidebook to get around Boston's Back Bay will find
nearly every major landmark incorrectly located.
   For example, the map places the Ritz-Carlton hotel three blocks
from its actual location at Newbury and Arlington Streets. Tourists
are told that The Four Seasons Hotel, on Boylston Street across from
the Public Garden, is on Newbury Street.
   Cumings, whose salary has risen 72 percent to $105,000 over the
past three years, told The Boston Sunday Globe that the errors have
been corrected, although the book was still on sale last week.

   Parents who want their kids to grow up to be
president should move to Virginia and give birth to a blue-eyed baby
in October, according to an article published Monday.
   ``Call him James. That's what six presidents' parents did,''
advises the January issue of Parents magazine. ``And there's no need
for a middle name _ almost half (of all presidents) didn't have
one.''
   What if James is a Jane? ``Don't despair! Last year the number of
women in elected office in the United States exceeded 18,000.''
   The article said that while Albert Einstein and Isaac Newton
showed early genius in their areas of expertise, few presidents were
``superkids.''
   More than half of all presidents had blue eyes, none was an only
child and Virginia was the most popular birthplace.
   But do you really want your child to have such a high-pressure
job?
   ``When 5-year-old FDR visited the White House in 1887, President
Grover Cleveland patted him on the head and said, `My little man, I
am making a strange wish for you. It is that you may never be
president of the United States,''' the article said.

   Mississippi's frosty weather is warming the
hearts of Dancer and Prancer, and they're playing reindeer games.
   ``They are having a ball in this cold weather,'' Shirley May said
of two female reindeer on her family's Christmas tree farm in the
green, rural Mississippi countryside. ``They are running out there
and having a great time, and I'm sitting here with a coat on.''
   Shirley and her husband, Raburn, brought the two reindeer from
White Mountain, Alaska, to Mississippi in July. Actually, a trio of
reindeer were flown in, but the third died of what May called
``shipping fever.''
   The reindeer were brought in to add a holiday touch to May's Lazy
Acres Christmas Tree Farm. Families can peek at the grayish-brown
animals not seen much in these parts _ other than on Christmas Eve.
   The Mays still plan to add a third reindeer _ possibly a buck _
early in 1989. They hope to one day own a herd the size of Santa's.
   In the meantime, they're making sure Dancer and Prancer are tuned
up for Christmas Eve. ``They will be well rested for Santa,'' May

   After 40 years, the thrill of the mystery
Christmas coconut is gone for Ed Clinch, but he's still a good sport
about it.
   Every year since 1948, a decorated coconut has been delivered to
Clinch as a practical joke from an unknown prankster. The gag is
wearing thin now for the 73-year-old victim, even though he still
good-naturedly accepts the gift.
   It started in 1948, with a bunch of buddies, Clinch recalled.
   ``I came back from the war telling a lot of stories about the
Philippines and coconuts. I think one of my pals got an idea from
that,'' he said.
   ``The first year, I took it to a party and we were throwing it
around and singing, `I Ain't Got Nobody.'''
   The coconut's delivery soon became an annual event. Coconuts have
been delivered to Clinch via ambulance, police canine corps, past
Peoria mayors, an FBI agent and even by the Bradley University
basketball team.
   Clinch said he has blackmailed his buddies, got mad at them and
tried every means of persuasion possible to uncover the joker.
   ``One time, every one of my friends admitted to it. What was I
going to do?'' he said.
   The 1988 coconut was delivered by a local radio station disc
jockey.
   ``It's a never-ending story. I don't know what to say except
Merry Christmas and Happy Coconut.''

   AIDS is now the ninth leading cause of death
among children 1 to 4 years old and the seventh leading cause of
deaths among young people age 15 to 24, a federal official said
Monday.
   If present trends continue, said Dr. Antonia Novello, the disease
soon will be the No. 5 killer of Americans from birth to their 24th
birthday.
   In a report to Health and Human Services Secretary Otis R. Bowen,
Novello said present statistics, ``however tragic, sorely
underestimate the true scope of pediatric AIDS.''
   As of Dec. 12, 1,291 cases of AIDS had been reported among
infants and children under age 13 and an additional 325 cases in the
13-to-19-year group. Of those, 717 who were under 13 at the time of
their diagnosis have already died, along with 174 who were
adolescents when diagnosed.
   ``The official figures include only those children whose
condition was reported to the Centers for Disease Control,'' she
said. ``Probably for every child who meets the CDC definition of
AIDS, another two to 10 are infected with HIV. It is estimated that
by 1991 there will be at least 10,000 to 20,000 HIV-infected
children in the United States.''
   HIV is the virus that causes AIDS, and health officials are
growing increasingly concerned that a large majority of those
infected eventually will develop AIDS and die.
   Novello, deputy director of the National Institute of Child
Health and Human Development, headed an HHS working group on AIDS
among children.
   Her report to Bowen said the ``problem of HIV infection among
adolescents is enormously greater than the official count suggests.''
   ``In view of the lengthy latency period between infection and
symptomatic disease, many of the more than 14,000 cases of AIDS
reported in persons in their 20s must surely have been contracted
when these people were teen-agers,'' she wrote. ``The repercussions
of HIV infection in adolescents are magnified by the potential of
these sexually active young people to become parents themselves,
transmitting the virus to yet another generation.''
   Citing demographic data that the current U.S. population of
people between 11 and 24 years of age ``is unusually small to begin
with,'' she said, ``If AIDS were to make serious inroads in this
group, the long-term consequences could be disastrous for the
nation's economy.''

   Wiley A. Branton was eulogized Monday as a
crack civil rights lawyer of the 1950s and 1960s whose ``life was
dedicated to protecting and defending the constitutional rights of
black people.''
   A funeral service for Branton, who died here Thursday of a heart
attack at age 65, was held in Washington Cathedral.
   The more than 1,100 mourners, led by Branton's widow Lucille,
included Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall, White House
national security adviser Colin Powell, Washington Mayor Marion
Barry and Lynda Robb, wife of Sen.-elect Charles Robb, D-Va., and
daughter of President Johnson.
   Branton will be buried on Wednesday in Bellwood Cemetery at his
hometown of Pine Bluff, Ark.
   Reviewing the legal career of his old friend, Washington lawyer
Vernon E. Jordan Jr., former president of the National Urban League,
said Branton's work as director of the Voter Education Project in
Atlanta resulted in the registration of more than 600,000 black
voters in the South in the 1960s.
   That cooperative effort helped create the momentum for passage of
the 1965 Voting Rights Act during the Johnson administration and
``made possible the election of blacks and a new breed of whites to
public office,'' Jordan said.
   ``Wiley Branton has argued his last case, he has written his last
brief, he has presented all the evidence and he has made his closing
argument,'' Jordan said. ``... We the jury find today that Wiley
Branton fought the good fight, finished his case and kept the
faith.''
   Marshall, who worked with Branton as civil rights lawyers in
Little Rock, Ark., during the 1957 struggle to achieve racial
desegregation of Central High School, said after the service that
Branton ``was truly a great American, a terrific lawyer and a
tactician who knew what to do for his people, and how to do it.''
   After serving as attorney for Freedom Riders, the young civil
rights activists who toured the South in the 1960s, Branton was
appointed executive secretary of the federal Council on Equal
Opportunity by President Johnson and was special assistant to
Attorneys General Nicholas Katzenbach and Ramsey Clark.
   He also was executive director of the United Planning
Organization, the anti-poverty agency for the District of Columbia,
and was dean of the Howard University Law School from 1978 until
1983. At his death, he was a partner in the Washington office of the
Chicago-based law firm of Sidley and Austin.

<HEAD>Amid The Flap Of Wings, Freedom and First Flight For Andean Condors</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE SIEGEL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An excited young Andean condor flapped her
wings and took off on her first flight as biologists freed three of
the birds into the wild to pave the way for the eventual release of
endangered California condors.
   The three birds were the first of up to 17 Andean condors,
donated by various zoos where they were born, that will be freed by
late 1989 so scientists can test the techniques they hope to use
when they release California condors, which are North America's
largest birds with 9{-foot wingspans.
   Only 28 endangered California condors remain alive, all in zoos
in Los Angeles and San Diego. Officials are trying to get the
carrion-eating vultures to breed in captivity in hopes of starting
to reintroduce them into the wild in five to 10 years.
   The release of the first three Andean birds started last Friday
night in a wet and snowy Hopper Mountain National Wildlife Refuge,
about 50 miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles. The three birds,
living in a net-covered enclosure set into rocks, were placed in a
roost box while scientists removed the netting, U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service biologist Teresa Nichols said Monday by phone from
Ventura.
   On Saturday morning, ``we opened the door, and the birds walked
out single file,'' Nichols said. At first, they stopped where the
net had been, then ``did their morning behavior _ stretching their
wings and trying to find sun to warm up,'' she added.
   Then, 8{-month-old condor Y1, born at San Diego Wild Animal Park
and the oldest of the trio, ``seemed to get very excited,'' Nichols
said.
   ``She started flapping her wings, jumping up and down and turning
in circles, extending her wings and flapping. ... She turned her
head into the breeze, jumped into the air and took her first flight.
She spiraled down, trying to soar awkwardly. She landed on some
rocks on a side hill beneath the release site.''
   The bird ``spent the rest of the day making short flights between
various rocks,'' while 6{-month-old condor Y3, born at Patuxent
Wildlife Research Center in Maryland, ``made some very short flights
among the rocks,'' Nichols said.
   Meanwhile, 6}-month-old condor Y2, born at the Buffalo (N.Y.)
Zoo, roosted on rocks without making a first flight.
   ``They're doing as we expected them to be doing,'' Nichols said.
``We're very pleased with how things are going.''
   Four more condors, kept in an enclosure in the nearby Sespe
Condor Sanctuary, will be released in late January or February, she
added.
   Efforts to save California condors have cost more than $20
million to date. The Andean condor release experiment will cost
about $440,000, officials have said.
   Some 1,000 to 2,000 Andean condors remain in the wilds of South
America. Thousands of California condors once flew free but their
numbers dwindled to the point that four of the last five breeding
pairs vanished in 1984-85. The Fish and Wildlife Service made a
controversial decision to round up the last six wild birds in 1986
to prevent their demise.
   Their path toward extinction has been blamed on development of
condor habitat and lead poisoning from eating carcasses of animals
shot by hunters.

   A woman who went undercover to help break up a
drug operation in Polk County has organized Grandparents for Drug
Free America.
   Pat Morrison, 44, of Salem said she decided to put together the
non-profit group for both educational and political purposes.
   Morrison has been the focus of media attention since she
participated in a six-week undercover investigation that led to the
arrests of six people Oct. 20-21.
   She said she became involved so police could break up the
methamphetamine lab that was supplying drugs to her daughters.
   One goal of the organization is to gain legislation for federal
controls on the distribution of chemicals used in the manufacture of
methamphetamine, she said.
   The educational side of Grandparents for Drug Free America would
encourage community involvement in reporting drug crime, Morrison
said.

<HEAD>Officials Concerned About World Food Supply In 1989</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Drought, floods and hurricanes wreaked havoc on world
food supplies in 1988, and experts are worried about the outlook for
next year, a U.N. official said Monday.
   ``The outcome of next year's harvest will be crucial,'' U.N. Food
and Agriculture Organization Director-General Edouard Saouma said in
his year-end statement. ``In 1989, global cereal output must
increase by an unprecedented 225 million tons, or 13 percent, to
meet food needs and rebuild stocks to acceptable levels.''
   During 1988 he said the world drew heavily from once-abundant
food reserves, depleting stocks to the lowest levels since the food
crisis of the early 1970s.
   ``For the first time since World War II, global cereal production
has declined in two successive years,'' Saouma said.
   Better harvests in Asia, Africa and Western Europe were unable to
offset crop losses in the Americas, Eastern Europe and the Soviet
Union, he said.
   Saouma also noted a severe drought in North America, the
traditional breadbasket of the world, reduced cereal output by
almost a third.
   Two successive hurricanes took a toll on harvest in some Central
American and Caribbean countries, and floods battered crops
elsewhere, particularly Bangladesh and Sudan, he said.
   Saouma said the locust invasion in Africa and the Middle East was
the most extensive in history, but concerted action has limited the
potentially enormous damage from the invasion, which is expected to
last two or three more years.
   Food production, he said, has not kept pace with population
growth in two-thirds of the countries in Africa; about half in Latin
American, the Caribbean and Near East; and a third of those in the
Far East.
   Angola, Benin, Bangladesh, Cambodia, Haiti, Laos, Lebanon,
Malawi, Mozambique, Nicaragua, Somalia, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Vietnam
and Ethiopia are ``facing unusual food shortages and require
exceptional food aid,'' he said.
   ``Our main multilateral food supply for use in times of
disasters, the International Emergency Food Reserve, is exhausted,''
he said.
   He repeated his proposal to make the voluntary reserve a legally
binding convention and to augment the 500,000-ton a year reserve
with a standby pledge of 1.5 million tons for emergencies.
   Saouma said a number of low-income, food-deficit countries could
have trouble meeting food needs in 1989 because the low stocks have
pushed up cereal prices. He also identified foreign indebtedness and
agricultural trade barriers as major obstacles for the Third World.
   Debt servicing alone absorbs more than 40 percent of the export
earnings of many developing countries, he said.
   Saouma also characterized 1988 as the worst financial year in
FAO's 43-year history. He said 80 countries owe the agency $111
million, with the largest debtor _ the United States _ owing $78
million.
   The Rome-based FAO coordinates agricultural projects in
developing countries and is the largest specialized agency in the
United Nations.

<HEAD>China Agrees to Fair Practice Provisions in Satellite Launchings</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China has agreed to a series of restrictions
concerning the terms under which Chinese-produced rocket boosters
will launch three American-made communications satellites, the State
Department said Monday.
   The restrictions basically are aimed at ensuring China will not
be able to compete unfairly against private American launch
companies.
   The agreement was initialed Saturday by U.S. and Chinese
representatives. It apparently sets the stage for AsiaSat, a
British-Chinese consortium, and AUSSAT, an Australian satellite
group, to have the satellites they plan to purchase in the United
States launched by Chinese rockets.
   As part of the agreement, China said it would abide by market
economy practices in pricing and insurance and would avoid other
government inducements, State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley
said.
   She said China also agreed to launch no more than nine
communications satellites during the next six years and to
distribute launch commitments proportionately during the agreement.
   Mrs. Oakley said the agreement ensures that U.S. national
security interests will be fully safeguarded.
   ``The agreement allows the Chinese to enter the international
commercial launch market in accordance with market principles and in
a way that will not materially impair the smooth and effective
functioning of that market,'' she said.
   Martin Marietta Corp., a major rocket manufacturer, said in a
statement Monday it is hopeful that the agreement will mean that
Chinese participation in satellite launchings will be ``fair and
non-disruptive.''
   Whether the agreement serves that purpose depends on the
specifics of how it is implemented, said a company spokeswoman, who
asked not to be identified by name.
   She also called for a broad international agreement on commercial
launch services among the United States, Europe, China and Japan.
   ``A level playing field is required if U.S. industry is to
compete and U.S. access is to be assured,'' she said.
   No American satellites have ever been launched by a non-Western
or communist country.
   In September, when President Reagan approved the plan, U.S.
commercial launch companies expressed opposition on grounds they
would not be able to compete with a country that has a state-run
rocket program and does not have to make a profit.
   The American launch market has picked up since the 1986
Challenger tragedy. Afterward, Reagan ordered that the space shuttle
be used only for military and scientific payloads, making private
rocket companies the only alternative for commercial satellite
producers.

<HEAD>Survey: 1 In 5 High School Students Smoked Pot, 1 In 2 Drank Last

<TEXT>
   One in five high school students smoked marijuana
in the last year, and half took a drink, according to a 24-state
survey by an Atlanta-based anti-drug group.
   The survey also reported findings ``shattering one widely held
notion about adolescent drug use'' _ that kids use drugs at school.
Less than 2 percent of the students surveyed reported using alcohol
or drugs on school premises.
   ``Students use drugs in their homes, in the homes of friends and
in cars, primarily at night and on weekends,'' said Dr. Ronald D.
Adams, the author of the report. ``We don't have a `school drug
problem.' We have a community drug problem.''
   The Parents' Resource Institute for Drug Education questioned
students in grades 6-12 in 24 states during the 1987-88 school year.
   More than 203,000 students filled in the group's questionnaire,
which was distributed at 302 schools, said PRIDE spokesman Doug
Hall. Although the survey is not a scientific sampling, the group
believes the results are ``very significant'' because of the large
number of students surveyed, from every region in the country, Hall
said.
   Students did not sign their names to the questionnaries, which
were machine-tabulated by the group to protect confidentiality, Hall
said.
   Among high school students, defined as grades 9-12, 20 percent of
those surveyed had used marijuana at least once in the previous
year. Fifty-eight percent had drunk beer, 56 percent had drunk wine
coolers and 46 percent had drunk liquor. Among seniors, 64 percent
said they had drunk beer in the previous year.
   Of the high school high students who drank, 30 percent said they
usually got drunk when they did.
   Four percent of the senior high students had tried cocaine.
Thirty-five percent had smoked cigarettes.
   Among junior high students, 31 percent had tried beer ; 30
percent, wine coolers; 18 percent, liquore; 16 percent, marijuana; 1
percent, cocaine; and 22 percent, cigarettes.
   More than half _ 51 percent _ of all students surveyed said they
found beer and wine coolers were at least ``fairly easy'' to obtain.
Twenty-six percent said the same for marijuana, and 12 percent said
so for cocaine.
   The questionnaires found some apparent ignorance about the
effects of wine coolers. Sixty-five percent of the students surveyed
said they were uncertain about any detrimental effects from wine
coolers, compared with 56 percent for beer _ although wine coolers,
which contain 4 percent to 6 percent alcohol, are more potent than
beer, which has an alcoholic content of 3 percent to 4 percent.
   The students were most likely to drink or to smoke marijuana at
home, at a friend's house or in a car. The largest percentages said
they had had beer, wine coolers or marijuana at a friend's house,
and liquor at home.
   The survey was conducted among schools in Alaska, Alabama,
Arkansas, California, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Idaho,
Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Missouri, Mississippi, New Mexico, New
York, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas,
Virginia, Washington, Wisconsin and West Virginia.

<HEAD>Survey Predicts Strong Job Market For College Graduates</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   College graduates face a happy new year in the job
market, according to a leading report released Monday.
   There will be an an 8 percent increase in corporate demand for
graduates with bachelor's degrees, and a 4.6 percent jump in
starting salaries, according to Northwestern University's 43rd
annual Lindquist-Endicott Report.
   The report also predicted new graduates with master's degrees
will be sought at a rate 14 percent higher than last year, and their
starting salaries will increase 3.5 percent.
   The 242 business and industrial firms surveyed nationwide for the
report painted a rosy picture of the 1989 economy, with 61 percent
expecting an improvement over 1988, 36 percent expecting no change,
and only 3 percent expecting a downturn, said Victor R. Lindquist,
director of placement at Northwestern and author of the report.
   ``Corporate America is confident the economy will remain strong
despite concerns by many so-called experts about the volatile stock
market, the deficit, trade balance, mega-mergers and the increased
competition in the marketplace,'' Lindquist said at a news
conference.
   Technical fields will remain the most lucrative for first-time
job-holders, the survey indicates. Starting salaries in engineering
fields for holders of bachelor's degrees will increase an average
2.5 percent, from $29,856 in 1988 to $30,600 in 1989.
   Those with bachelor's degrees who seek jobs in chemistry-related
fields can expect the second-highest starting salaries _ $28,488 _
up 5.1 percent from from $27,108 in 1988, the survey indicates.
   But the biggest salary jump will be in sales and marketing, with
the $25,560 predicted in 1989 up 8.8 percent from the $23,484
starting salary for graduates with a bachelor's degree in 1988.
   Salary increases for new master's degree holders will be up 2.4
percent to 5.8 percent over last spring, he said.
   The report is considered a leading indicator of job prospects for
college graduates. Of about 500 companies that received surveys this
year, 242 sent in responses used in the report, Lindquist said.
   The results have a margin of error of about 3 percentage points,
he said.
   About 70 percent to 80 percent of jobs being created are in the
service sector, Lindquist said, but he also expects a resurgence in
production.
   Five percent of firms surveyed reported difficulty meeting
minority hiring goals, and the number is expected to triple in five
years.
   The report also showed 47 percent of the employers surveyed use
some drug testing, and 7 percent more expect to implement such
programs in the next year.
   ``The drug user, once on the payroll, becomes a very, very costly
liability in time lost,'' Lindquist said.
   When questioned about child-care services, only 2 percent said
they pay part of on-site day care for employees' children, 5 percent
provide help paying for outside child care, and 29 percent had some
sort of referral service for employees.
   ``I suspect there'll be a tremendous change (in the number) by
the time we make a report next year,'' Lindquist said.
   Companies surveyed include major employers in banking, finance
and insurance, chemical, electronics, merchandising, public
utilities and other industries.

<TEXT>
   Austria said Monday it will allow the PLO
to call its representative in Vienna an ambassador, but will not
regard him as such and does not recognize the recently proclaimed
Palestinian state.
   Chancellor Franz Vranitzky told reporters, however, that his
government's position ``comes close to recognition.''
   Yasser Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization,
said after separate meetings with Vranitzky and Foreign Minister
Alois Mock that he had chosen Daud Barakat as ambassador to head the
PLO mission.
   Vrantizky and Mock said Barakat would be ambassador in title only
and Austria's ambassador to Tunisia would double as ``political
representative'' to PLO headquarters in Tunis.
   They said Austria does not recognize governments without
territory, but pledged political and humanitarian support for the
PLO.
   ``We will include Mr. Barakat in the list of ambassadors, but he
is not accredited,'' Foreign Ministry spokesman Walter Greinert said.
   Because Austria has not extended formal recognition of the
Palestinian state proclaimed Nov. 15 in Algiers, Barakat cannot
present credentials to President Kurt Waldheim, Greinert said.
   Waldheim received Arafat at his office in the former Hofburg
imperial palace opposite the chancellery.
   Arafat emerged an hour later flashing a V sign with his fingers,
but did not make a statement, and was driven off in a police
motorcade. The PLO chief has scheduled a news conference for Tuesday
before leaving for Yugoslavia.
   Waldheim hailed the resumption of the U.S.-Palestinian dialogue
in Tunis last week and expressed his hope that an international
conference on the Middle East would be held in the near future under
the U.N. aegis, the Austria Press Agency said.
   Austria's Jews and two other pro-Israeli groups wrote joint
letters to Vranitzky and Mock expressing displeasure about the
reception given Arafat on his one-day visit.
   Mock told reporters the proclaimation of an independent state by
the Palestine National Council, which acts as the PLO legislature,
and ``Arafat's significant speech in Geneva'' to the U.N. General
Assembly last ahad had revived prospects for peace in the Middle
East.
   ``We appeal to Israel to react positively to the PLO's move,
which was positively assessed virtually by the entire international
community, and to give peace a chance in the Middle East,'' Mock
said.
   He praised the PLO's ``full commitment'' to U.N. Security Council
Resolutions 242 and 338 as a basis for solution of the Middle East
conflict, the renunciation of terrorism and its commitment to the
right of all countries in the region to exist within secure borders.
   The foreign minister criticized Israel for what he termed
violations of international covenants and ``fundamental freedoms and
rights'' in the occupied territories. Palestinians in the West Bank
and Gaza Strip began a rebellion against Israeli rule more than a
year ago.
   ``In the last 1{ years the fourth Geneva agreement on the
treatment of the civilian population by a military occupation power
has repeatedly been violated by Israel,'' Mock declared.
   Earlier Monday, Vranitzky promised to support Arafat's campaign
for an international conference. The chancellor criticized Israel's
``misconduct'' toward civilians in the occupied lands and promised
medical and agricultural aid through the United Nations.
   Letters from the Austrian Jewish community, Austrian-Israeli
Society and B'nai B'rith said ``Austria puts itself in the service
of PLO propaganda'' by receiving Arafat.
   ``The PLO is conducting a hoodwinking tactic by talking peace and
at the same time continuing to aim toward destruction of the state
of Israel,'' they said.
   At the airport, Arafat said of the Israelis: ``Sooner or later
they will discover that peace is more important for them than
anything else.''
   Israel considers the PLO a terrorist group and refuses to deal
with it. The United States began direct contacts with the PLO last
week.
   Arafat said ``Yes, yes'' when asked whether he would visit other
European capitals, but would not say where he would go. The official
Yugoslav news agency Tanjug said he was expected in Belgrade on
Tuesday.

<HEAD>Study Says Two-Year Budgets Would Help Insulate Pentagon From
Politics</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM AHERN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Pentagon budgets should be approved for at
least two years at a time as part of the effort to insulate defense
spending from political pressures, a private study said Monday.
   The Defense Department also should streamline its complicated
procedures for buying weapons, but shouldn't do that by creating an
entirely new bureaucracy outside the four services, the study
concluded.
   The review, directed by a pair of former defense secretaries, was
prepared by the Foreign Policy Institute and the Center for
Strategic and International Studies, two Washington-based,
nonpartisan groups that study policy issues.
   Co-chairs of the study were Harold Brown and James Schlesinger,
who each were secretary of defense in the 1970s.
   The report's recommendations echoed reforms proposed by other
studies in the past decade, all of which have called for more
stability in the defense budget as way of making more efficient use
of taxpayers' money.
   Defense spending has long been one of the most popular areas for
legislators' attention, the study noted.
   ``Political agendas and `pork barrel' politics create serious
problems for the effective management of defense resources; yet
there has been little change in this area to date,'' it said.
   The study called for two-year budget cycles to replace the
current system of annual appropriations. ``Such a move would add
greatly to stability in defense programs and make possible more
sound and realistic budget planning,'' it said.
   The report also called for unspecified changes in the way the
Defense Department buys weapons.
   Creation of Pentagon offices designed to streamline weapons
purchasing hasn't done the job, the study said. ``Although the new
positions have been created, they have been superimposed upon the
old acquisition system without altering the real distribution of
power.''
   The two-year military budget cycle has been endorsed previously
by Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Senate Armed Services
Committee.
   Nunn said Monday that his committee will look carefully at the
nomination of former Sen. John Tower as secretary of defense in the
Bush administration.
   Tower was Nunn's predecessor as Armed Services chairman but that
doesn't entitle him to any special consideration, Nunn said.
   ``The committee will have a higher set of standards ... for the
entire team,'' from Tower down through the Pentagon's top set of
managers, Nunn told reporters.
   Asked if Tower will receive kid-glove treatment at his
confirmation hearing, Nunn said, ``We are not going to play the
old-boy game this go-around.''
   Nunn said he and Sen. John Warner of Virginia, the panel's
ranking Republican, will insist on seeing the full FBI report on
Tower. The agency conducted an extensive background investigation
following allegations of womanizing and drinking, and reports about
Tower's coziness with the defense industry.
   Nunn said he did not want to repeat the mistakes of Tower's early
tenure as chairman, when former top Pentagon official Melvyn Paisley
was confirmed. Paisley now figures prominently in the government's
defense procurement fraud case.
   Nunn also said he plans to introduce legislation early next year
providing for a broad new program of voluntary national service for
young Americans beginning at age 18.
   The incoming Senate majority leader, George Mitchell of Maine,
``wants to make that one of the top priorities for the Democratic
majority,'' Nunn said, adding he expects substantial Republican
support as well.
   Nunn said he hoped the idea, which would include both military
and civilian service and encompass expanded VISTA and Peace Corps
programs, could be enacted into law within two years.

   Middle school counselor Jay Levine has invested a
lot of time setting students on a course for life. Now he's doing
the same thing with his money.
   Levine, a counselor for seventh- and eighth-grade students at
Jackson Middle School for 3{ years, started his own scholarship fund
two years ago by donating $20,000 _ about half his annual income _
to the United Negro College Fund. He's pledged to give at least
$20,000 in each of the next four years until the fund reaches
$100,000.
   ``The biggest thing is I see too many students who don't have any
future goals to plan for,'' Levine said Monday. ``You have to have
some expectations to have something happen.''
   Levine, who earned his master's degree in 1971 in counseling from
Wayne State University, said he expects to award the first
scholarship in 1992, using the interest accrued from the investment.
   The United Negro College Fund will administer the trust. Students
who attended Jackson Middle School or Detroit's Southeastern or
Kettering high schools, where Levine formerly taught English, will
get priority in the application process.
   Mary E. Sims, the United Negro College Fund's Michigan area
development director, is helping Levine organize the program.
   ``The important thing he stressed ... is it's just too late when
they become seniors,'' she said. ``Many students need the incentive
way before their senior year. His whole purpose is to say, `Look,
here's some money that might be available if you hit the books.'''
   Sims said the unusual aspect of Levine's gift is that it is from
a high school counselor.
   ``We do have individuals who have established scholarships,'' she
said. ``Most are more affluent.''

   Prime Minister Ziad Rifai reshuffled his
Cabinet on Monday and King Hussein named a new national security
adviser, the official Jordan News Agency reported.
   Government sources who requested anonymity said the changes did
not signal any major shift in Jordan's economic or foreign policy.
   Former army commander in chief, Field Marshal Zeid bin Shaker,
was named chief military affairs adviser to Hussein, according to
the news agency Petra. Shaker also is to head the kingdom's public
security, intelligence and army departments, according to a source
in the prime minister's office.
   The post of commander-in-chief will be phased out, official
Jordanian television reported. It said the armed forces' general
chief of staff, Fathi Abu Taleb, will fulfill the responsibilities
of commander-in-chief.
   Adnan Abu Odeh, a minister at the royal court, was appointed
political adviser to the Jordanian monarch, the news agency reported.
   Amer Khamash, a member of Parliament, was appointed a special
adviser to the king, but the agency did not define his duties.
   The prime minister replaced three ministers in the 26-member
Cabinet, according to a high-ranking source in his office. The new
government is the fifth since Rifai took office in April 1985.
   Former Royal Court Chief Marwan Kassem was appointed Jordan's
foreign minister, replacing Taher Masri.
   Zuheir Malhas, who was health minister until 1985, took the post
again, succeeding Zaid Hamzeh.
   Yanal Hikmat, a former protocol chief at the royal palace, became
minister of tourism, replacing Zuheir Ajlouni, who became state
minister for prime ministry affairs. State ministers are advisers to
the prime minister.
   The former supply minister, Abdul Salam Kanaan, also was named a
state minister for prime ministry affairs. The new head of the
Supply Ministry is Fayez Tarawneh.
   Yousef Hamdan, a previous minister of municipal, environmental
and rural affairs switched jobs with the minister of agriculture,
Marwan Hmoud.
   The state minister for parliamentary affairs, Sami Joudeh,
dropped out of the government.
   The new ministers and royal court appointees were sworn in with
Hussein present at army headquarters on the outskirts of Amman, the
agency said.

<HEAD>Giant Agricultural Family Member Dies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OVIEDO, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   John Duda, who helped his Seminole County
family build one of the nation's largest agricultural empires, has
died after a long illness. He was 84.
   Duda, who died Saturday, worked behind the scenes to design
special farming, irrigation and packing equipment that is now widely
used in farming on organic soils.
   What A. Duda & Sons began as a 10-acre farm near Oviedo
mushroomed into a farming giant from Florida to California and
Australia. Today the company is diversified into vegetables, citrus,
sugar cane, sod, foliage, cattle and real estate development.
   As the son of Andrew Duda Sr., the family patriarch who emigrated
from Czechoslovakia with his wife and children in 1912, John Duda
and his brothers, Andrew Jr. and Ferdinand, learned about farming
from the land. They had no formal training or high school education.
   Born in Velcice, Czechoslovakia, John Duda joined the family
business in 1926. He retired as corporate vice president in 1976 and
served on the Duda board of directors until January of this year.
   ``They really exemplify a rags-to-riches story,'' said Henry
Swanson, retired Orange County agricultural extension agent.
``They're the biggest in Florida, and they've definitely left their
footprints on agriculture here.''
   Last year Forbes magazine listed the Duda family among the 400
richest people in America. At least 60 family members share 120,000
acres in Florida and a vegetable empire worth more than $550
million, the magazine said. With annual sales of $186 million, Duda
is one of the nation's five largest vegetable growers and the
biggest in Florida. Duda corporate spokesman Don McAllister disputed
the magazine's figures, but said the company's assets are not made
public.
   In recognition of his achievements in agriculture, John Duda
received an honorary doctor of agriculture service degree from the
University of Central Florida in 1982. Three years later he was
installed as a member of Florida's Agriculture Hall of Fame.
   The Duda family has not been without controversy.
Environmentalists have complained that the Dudas polluted Lake
Apopka by dumping millions of gallons of polluted water into the
lake from their farming operations. The state is now working to
clean up the lake and stop the discharge of water from farmland.
   Survivors include his wife, the former Julia Cicmanec; his
brother Ferdinand; five children from his first wife, Katherine, who
died in 1974; 19 grandchildren, and 11 great-grandchildren.

<TEXT>
   A key figure in a corruption scandal that has rocked
Italy's state-run railway has been arrested after returning from
abroad, police said Monday.
   Elio Graziano, who supplied the railway with disposable sheets,
was arrested Sunday when he stepped off a plane from Brazil, police
said.
   An investigation began after a rival company said that only
Graziano's company was informed the government was taking bids on
the $120 million contract.
   Graziano, who is accused of fraud and corruption, is one of 11
people charged in the case, which led to the resignation last month
of the president of the railway, Ludovico Ligato. The government has
named Mario Schimberni, former chairman of the Montedison chemical
conglomerate, as special railroad commissioner.
   Graziano, 56, left Italy before the arrest warrant was issued
Nov. 17. He told Italian journalists in an interview from New York a
few weeks ago that his business transactions with the railway were
always above-board.

<HEAD>Judge Asked To Lift Suspensions Of Dartmouth Students In Classroom
Clash</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HAVERHILL, N.H. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A lawyer asked a judge Monday to lift the
suspensions of two white Dartmouth College students for allegedly
harassing a black professor, saying the sanctions chilled free
speech on campuses nationwide. But a lawyer for the school said the
real issue was ``student misconduct.''
   ``This is a case with national repercussions,'' said Harvey
Myerson, a lawyer for the students, both former editors of a
conservative, off-campus newspaper. Their cause has attracted
support from several nationally known conservatives, including
William F. Buckley Jr.
   The students' classroom confrontation with Professor William Cole
erupted after the paper, the Dartmouth Review, called one of his
courses ``one of Dartmouth's most academically deficient.''
   Jack Middleton, a lawyer for the Ivy League school, defended the
suspensions, telling Grafton County Superior Court Judge Bruce Mohl
that ``this is a simple case, your honor, of student misconduct.''
   ``This is not a case which involves their right to publish,''
Middleton said. ``It involves a question of civility, which is
certainly a reasonable concern on the part of a college community.''
   ``Dartmouth College is a private institution and the code of
conduct under which it operates ... is a contract between the
college and its students,'' Middleton said. ``This court should
exercise great restraint before it acts as a super-disciplinary
board.''
   A Dartmouth disciplinary panel in March suspended Christopher
Baldwin, 21, of Hinsdale, Ill., and John Sutter, 22, of St. Louis,
until September 1989 for the confrontation with Cole, a music
professor.
   A third student received a shorter suspension and a fourth got
probation for the February classroom clash, which heightened racial
tensions on campus. All four students are white.
   Baldwin and Sutter are seeking a preliminary injunction to lift
their suspensions. Testimony before Mohl was expected to take a
week, said Arthur Ruegger, another lawyer for the students.
   Review staffers said they tried to obtain comment from Cole by
telephone on the critical article, but he declined, calling them
racist. The staffers said that on advice of the paper's lawyer, they
then went to Cole's classroom to give him a written statement
offering him a chance to respond.
   The students said Cole cursed and threatened them. Myerson argued
that Cole should have been punished, not the Review staffers.
   Middleton later asserted that ``Professor Cole is not on trial
here.''
   Baldwin, Sutter, the third suspended student and the Review also
filed a federal lawsuit charging they were targeted for their
outspoken conservative views, such as opposition to affirmative
action and women's studies courses at Dartmouth. The case is pending.
   The Review's supporters include such prominent conservatives as
Buckley and Sens. William Armstrong, R-Colo., and Gordon Humphrey,
R-N.H. Both senators attended a Washington news conference in July
to announce the state and federal lawsuits.
   One critic of the paper, Dartmouth President James Freedman, has
said that Review staffers are ``ideological provocateurs posing as
journalists,'' though he also defended the Review's right to exist.
   Myerson said the paper has been ``a thorn in the side'' of
Dartmouth administrators, and suggested that the staffers could not
get a fair trial from administrators and faculty on the disciplinary
panel who themselves have been the paper's targets. Middleton
dismissed the claim as demeaning to panel members.
   Myerson said Freedman, by denouncing the Review during a campus
rally shortly before the disciplinary hearing, fostered ``a
lynch-mob atmosphere.''
   Middleton replied, ``This is great rhetoric, but ... the evidence
of this case simply does not support it.'' He said the college
disciplinary code _ overhauled after a 1986 incident in which Review
staffers took sledgehammers to symbolic anti-apartheid shanties _
excludes the president from the disciplinary process so he can speak
out on important matters.
   Myerson also argued that the suspensions were far stiffer than
those meted out to other students found guilty of disorderly
conduct. Middleton countered that the misconduct may be
unprecedented in a Dartmouth classroom.
   Saying the editors ``do not have clean hands,'' Middleton noted
that they taped telephone conversations with Cole, as well as one of
his classes and the confrontation itself, without his consent _ in
apparent violation of state law.
   Baldwin acknowledged the taping, but called it ``common
practice'' for journalists. He said that in the recorded telephone
conversation between Sutter and Cole, Cole began yelling before
Sutter could ask for permission to tape.

<TEXT>
   Alleged police threats forced a Thai
student group to cancel a fund-raising concert for Burmese students
who fled a military crackdown, an organizer said Monday.
   The seven-band concert planned for Tuesday was to buy food and
medicine for students who fled the Sept. 18 coup in Burma, said
Watchara Petthong, the leader of Sajjatham, a university-based
political party.
   Petthong said a senior police official on Friday warded that Thai
and Burmese students would be arrested if the concert was staged.
   Authorities in Burma have killed more than 500 people since the
coup, which ended months of pro-democracy demonstrations.
   Gen. Chavalit Yongchaiyudh, Thailand's chief of army, last week
told its leader, Gen. Saw Maung, that he would try to persuade the
students to return home. Yongchaiyudh was the first foreign official
to visit Burma since the coup.

   The right-wing Likud bloc and the left-leaning
Labor Party settled their remaining differences Monday and agreed to
join in a coalition government, officials from both parties said.
   The agreement came after seven weeks of haggling following
indecisive parliamentary elections Nov. 1 that gave neither Likud
nor Labor, Israel's two main political blocs, a clear mandate to
govern the country.
   The agreement, which has not yet been signed, would severely
reduce the influence in a new government of the small religious and
right-wing parties, who had been negotiating with Likud's Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir to form a coalition.
   During the long negotiations, the religious parties had wrested
concessions from Likud that disturbed many Israelis who feared their
lives would be too strictly governed by Jewish law.
   In addition, Jews from the United States were deeply disturbed by
a promise Shamir made to push for ammendment of the ``Who-is-a-Jew''
law, which would have narrowed the definition of a Jew to exclude
those converted by non-Orthodox rabbis. Most U.S. Jews are not
Orthodox.
   The religious and right-wing partie still could be part of the
new government. Shamir was to meet with their leaders Monday night
to try to lure them into a broad coalition along with Labor. But
leaders of the parties expressed the fear that Likud might back out
of commitments it made to them earlier.
   Avi Pazner, an aide to Shamir, said the agreement would not be
signed ``for a day or two'' pending the negotiations with small
parties. ``We cannot drink `L'chaim' yet,'' he said, referring to
the traditional Hebrew toast meaning ``to life.''
   The new government will be similar in many ways to the coalition
that has governed Israel for the last four years. An important
difference is that it will be headed throughout the four-year term
by Shamir. In the last government, Shamir and Labor head Shimon
Peres traded jobs after two years.
   Likud gained the upper hand when it won 40 seats in the 120-seat
parliament to Labor's 39. The remaining seats were split among small
parties, the majority of whom favor Likud.
   In the new government, Peres will be finance minister, while
Likud's Moshe Arens is likely to be made foreign minister, Israel
radio said. Labor's Yitzhak Rabin will continue as defense minister.
   Officials said the two major parties resolved their last
remaining difference in a late afternoon meeting, when Likud agreed
to give Labor the powerful chairmanship of the parliament's finance
committee.
   Labor had insisted on controlling the position, saying a Likud
nominee would tie Peres' hands in the Finance Ministry. Labor agreed
to allow Shamir final approval of its nomination to the post.
   Earlier, Likud's Roni Milo, a deputy minister, said his party
gave in to Labor and dropped its demand to build 40 new Jewish
settlements in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. Labor
agreed to between five and eight settlements, he said.
   Officials said the broad-based government, which enjoys popular
support despite its shortcomings, will enable Israel to present a
unified front against pressure to negotiate with the Palestine
Liberation Organization.
   The United States last week reversed a longstanding ban on
contacts with the PLO, shocking Israeli officials who view the group
as a terror organization.
   ``It (the government) will strengthen Israel against outside
pressure,'' Pazner said Monday. ``Because it will be a centrist
government, it will be able to launch diplomatic initiatives that
enjoy the backing of a great majority of the people.''
   The small religious parties reacted with anger to reports of the
agreement between Likud and Labor and the possibility that many of
their earlier demands would not be met.
   ``Last week we met with Shamir and he promised us with much
festivity that we would get the Education Ministry. We are
incensed,'' said Yigal Bibi of the National Religious Party. His
party now is unlikely to get the post.
   With the new agreement, chances for passage of the
``Who-is-a-Jew'' ammendment appeared negligible. Labor opposes the
law, and Likud has not asked Labor to support it.
   The political program of the new government has yet to be drawn
up, and some hardline Likud members already were complaining Monday
about Labor's left-leaning policies.
   Likud strongly opposes Labor's land-for-peace proposals, as well
as Peres' proposal for an international Middle East peace conference.
   Both Labor and Likud oppose talks with the PLO. However, dovish
elements within Labor have begun calling for changing the party
platform to allow talks with the group.

<TEXT>
   A man already convicted of one murder
pleaded guilty Monday to the torture slayings of five other men,
whose remains he dismembered and put in curbside trash bags to be
hauled off to the city dump.
   It would be an impossible task, so no effort would be made to
find the bodies of the victims of Robert A. Berdella, said Albert
Riederer, Jackson County prosecutor, following the court hearing.
   Berdella, 39, pleaded guilty earlier to the murder of Larry
Pearson of Wichita, Kan., and was sentenced to life in prison
without possibility of parole. He pleaded guilty Monday to another
first-degree murder charge in the death of Robert Sheldon, and
guilty to four other charges of second-degree murder.
   He was given another life term without chance of parole in
Sheldon's death, and life sentences in the other four cases.
   Berdella said during the 90-minute hearing that he killed Sheldon
in April 1985 by putting a plastic trash bag over his head, tying it
with a rope and allowing him to suffocate. Pearson died the same way.
   The other victims, killed between 1984 and 1987, died after being
bound to a bed, gagged and injected with animal tranquilizers. One
of the victims bled to death, Berdella said.
   The other victims were Jerry Howell, 19; Mark Wallace, 20; Walter
Ferris, 25; and Todd Stoops, 25. All lived in the Kansas City area
or had Kansas City ties.
   ``He talked about having certain dark fantasies that came to
life,'' said Riederer, adding that no clearer motive emerged from
three days of questioning of Berdella last week that led to the plea
bargain in which Berdella avoided the death penalty.
   ``He felt abused or misused by certain people, including some of
the victims,'' Riederer said. ``There was revenge, or getting
control of these people.''
   Berdella, an art collector and operator of a shop that sold art
objects and antiques, became a household name in Kansas City when he
was arrested in April after a man wearing only a dog collar ran
screaming from his midtown house.
   The man told authorities he had been sexually tortured, beaten
and injected with drugs by Berdella.
   The arrest was followed by days of digging in Berdella's yard and
searching of his rambling house. Two skulls and a bag of teeth were
found along with hundreds of photographs of nude and sometimes
unconscious men.
   Riederer said that there were 26 or 27 different men in the
pictures and that all had been accounted for except two.
   No further charges were expected to be filed, Riederer said.

<HEAD>Former Deputy Prison Commissioner Charged</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former prison official has been
indicted on charges he sought political contributions from
underlings during Alabama's rough-and-tumble 1986 gubernatorial
election.
   Charles Bryan, 60, former deputy prison commissioner, was the
last of four people indicted following a two-year investigation.
   Montgomery County District Attorney Jimmy Evans said all the
indictments related to the campaigns of former Lt. Gov. Bill Baxley
and ex-Attorney General Charlie Graddick, whose battle for the
Democratic nomination for governor went from the voting booth to the
courtroom.
   Bryan, who turned himself in Saturday at the Montgomery County
Jail, is charged with illegally influencing the vote or political
action of people.
   He was released in less than an hour on $5,000 bond, jail
officials said.
   Indicted on the same charges last week were Birmingham private
investigator Andy Yeomans, Mobile private investigator Don Bekurs
and state prison Warden Jim Morrison of Elmore County. Each turned
himself in Thursday and was released on $5,000 bond.
   Yeomans and Bekurs were campaign aides to Graddick, and Bekurs
also worked in Graddick's state office. The indictments accused them
of using state-owned electronic equipment to eavesdrop at state
Democratic Party headquarters in Birmingham.
   Morrison and Bryan were accused of ordering subordinates to
solicit contributions or make donations to the Baxley campaign.
During the 1986 campaign, Morrison was director of external
corrections for the state prison system and Bryan was his boss, Hale
said.
   Bryan resigned the Department of Corrections in early 1987.
   Baxley, now a Birmingham attorney, and Graddick, a Montgomery
investment banker, were out of their offices Monday, their
secretaries said, and they could not be reached for comment.
   Graddick led the 1986 Democratic runoff by 8,756 votes over
Baxley. But a state Democratic Party subcommittee and the federal
courts ruled Graddick's lead came from illegal Republican crossover
votes and they gave Baxley the party's nomination.
   The resulting voter backlash helped Guy Hunt become Alabama's
first Republican governor in 112 years.

<HEAD>Former Cabinet Minister, 2 Others Expelled From Ruling Party</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The ruling party Monday expelled a former
Cabinet minister from its ranks 10 days after he resigned in a
quarrel over party election results.
   Kenneth Matiba, former transport and communications minister, was
ousted from the Kenya African National Union party along with Kimani
wa Nyoike, a jailed former legislator, and Joseph Kimotho Mugambi,
the vice-president of a party branch.
   Matiba resigned his Cabinet post Dec. 9 after challenging the
results of party elections in his central Kenya constituency.
   Peter Oloo Aringo, party chairman and minister for education,
said the party's governing council expelled Matiba and Mugambi
because of ``their unpatriotic and anti-nationalistic behavior'' in
questioning the party elections.
   Mugambi was party vice-chairman in northern Laikipia district.
   Matiba's expulsion from the party also automatically removes him
from Parliament and a by-election must be held in his constituency.
   President Daniel arap Moi, who also leads the party, told 4,000
party members at a seminar in Nairobi that Matiba had ``insulted the
presidency'' by sending supporters to the State House _ Moi's
official residence _ to protest the election results.
   He should have sent them to party headquarters at the Kenyatta
International Conference Center ``if he had any complaints,'' Moi
said.
   Matiba was first elected to Parliment in 1979 and has held
several positions in Moi's Cabinet in the past five years.
   Moi on Monday replaced Matiba with a political rival, Joseph
Kamotho.
   Nyoike, a former assistant minister in Moi's government, was
sentenced to a 20-month prison term Oct. 21 for failure to reveal to
the authorities an alleged plot by the rebel Kenya Patriotic Front
to overthrow Moi's government.

   The bodies of five Americans killed in a
missile attack on their plane by Polisario guerrillas in the Sahara
Desert have been returned to U.S. authorities, the State Department
said Monday.
   The bodies were handed over Friday by the guerrillas to U.S.
officials in Algiers, where the Soviet-armed group has its
headquarters.
   They were then flown to the U.S. Air Force base in Torrejon,
Spain, for a forensic examination and will be returned to their
families as soon as the procedure is completed, said a State
Department official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The five Americans were working for T & G Aviation of Chandler,
Ariz., which was under contract to the U.S. Agency for International
Development on a locust-spraying operation over the Sahara Desert.
   The Polisario Front, which has been fighting Morocco since 1975
for control of the Western Sahara, accepted responsibility for the
downing of the DC-7 aircraft Dec. 10 and the crippling of a
companion plane that landed safely after the attack.
   The Polisario apologized for the attack, which occurred over
remote desert terrain on the border between Morocco and Mauritania,
saying it mistook the planes for Moroccan military reconnaissance
aircraft.
   The United States said evidence gathered so far by an FBI
investigating team had not turned up any reason to doubt the
Polisario explanation.
   But the State Department official said the team has not been able
to get to the crash site because of concern for safety in the combat
zone. The team has interviewed the five survivors of the other plane
and examined the damage, he said.

   Actor Gary Busey remained in fair condition
Monday and was recovering well from head injuries suffered more than
two weeks ago in a motorcycle accident, but a hospital spokesman
said no release date was set.
   ``All the indications are that he is going to make a total
recovery,'' said Cedars-Sinai Medical Center spokesman Ron Wise.
   Busey, 44, had brain surgery to remove internal bleeding pressure
after he hit his head on a curb Dec. 4 following a fall from the
motorcycle he was riding without a helmet. Police blamed Busey for
the accident, but said no charges would be filed.
   ``His condition is still listed as fair. He still needs to be
watched. He had a very serious accident,'' Wise said. He said the
actor continues to walk and take other forms of exercise as part of
his recovery.
   ``Tons of mail have come in and fans have sent tremendous amounts
of flowers,'' Wise said. He said Busey's wife Judy suggest that fans
either make a donation to their favorite charity or to AIDS
research. ``She thought it would be a very good cause,'' Wise said.

<HEAD>Rate Plan Approved For Diablo Canyon Nuclear Plant</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB EGELKO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ratepayers may have to absorb up to $4.5
billion of the $5.5 billion cost of building the Diablo Canyon
nuclear power plant under a plan that was approved Monday by the
state Public Utilties Commission and immediately attacked by
consumer groups.
   The 28-year plan agreed to by Pacific Gas & Electric Co., the
commission staff and Attorney General John Van de Kamp will base
electric rates on how well the plant performs, starting with a 5
percent increase in January.
   But opponents immediately announced they would challenge the plan
in the state Supreme Court.
   Sylvia Siegel, executive director of the consumer group Toward
Utility Rate Normalization, said ratepayers had been victimized by a
``sellout by the PUC'' and accused the commission of ``abdicating
its responsibility to set just and reasonable rates.''
   Diablo Canyon began commercial operation in 1985, 13 years behind
schedule and at 17 times its originally planned cost. Design errors,
the discovery of the magnitude of the earthquake fault, federal
licening problems and legal challenges all contributed to the delay.
   In its initial assessment, the state commission's consumer staff
recommended allowing only $1.1 billion of Diablo Canyon to be
imposed on ratepayers.
   In the settlement approved Monday, the commission decided for the
first time in state history to base rates for a major power plant on
the level of its performance _ the more electricity it produces, the
more customers will pay.
   The commission staff estimates that under terms of the
settlement, customers will pay $3.5 billion and PG&E stockholders $2
billion. That would represent the largest amount a state regulatory
commission has required stockholders to pay for the construction
costs of an operating nuclear plant in the United States.
   Those figures are based, however, on the average lifetime
performance of similar nuclear plants nationwide, operating at 58
percent of capacity. The utility predicts that Diablo Canyon will
operate at 65 to 70 percent of capacity, which would add about $1
billion to the customers' share.
   Under the settlement, electric rates are scheduled to rise about
5 percent Jan. 1 and another 1.6 percent in each of the next three
years, with additional amounts in those years for inflation in the
cost of fuel. Those percentages would be higher in the years after
1989 if the plant operates as well as the utility is forecasting.
   PUC member Donald Vial called the plan ``reasonable, consistent
with the law and in the public interest.'' He said the utility would
have an incentive to operate the plant safely because the U.S.
Nuclear Regulatory Commission would order a shutdown of an unsafe
plant.
   But the plan is opposed by a number of consumer and environmental
groups, who argued that mistakes and mismanagement by the utility _
in particular, the failure to detect the magnitude of an earthquake
fault near the San Luis Obispo site _ would justify saddling company
stockholders, rather than ratepayers, with most of the construction
cost.
   Mothers for Peace, the San Luis Obispo group that has led the
opposition to Diablo Canyon, said the plan connecting electric rates
to performance would create ``a dangerous conflict between plant
safety and company profits.''

<TEXT>
   A jolly Benedictine monk and 21 affluent
teen-agers from the Northeast are playing Santa Claus to hundreds of
poor families in Appalachia.
   The group arrived during the weekend after a 14-hour drive from
Morristown, N.J., where the boys attend Delbarton School.
   Led by former Delbarton headmaster Giles Hayes, or ``Father
Giles,'' as he is known, they will spend five days helping
distribute clothing and toys to more than 700 families in
southeastern Kentucky.
   When the first caravan came here from New Jersey in 1981, it
consisted of a van with donations stuffed in the back seat. This
year, there were two semis and two rental trucks fllled with such
items as 350 pairs of tennis shoes from a store owner in Morristown.
   Donations from the Delbarton school make up half of the items
going into the Christmas basket program sponsored by the Christian
Appalachian Project. Contributions also are sent by families around
the country and from individuals and businesses in the area, said
Msgr. Ralph Beiting, who set up the non-profit CAP in 1957.
   By Saturday morning, the four trucks had been unloaded into the
CAP warehouse in Prestonsburg. Volunteers, along with a group of
students from Creighton University in Omaha, Neb., and the boys from
Delbarton stuffed boxes full of food and presents.
   ``Poverty in America is off the beaten track,'' Hayes said before
rushing off to Wheelwright to deliver Christmas baskets.
   ``You drive the roads in Kentucky, which are some of the best in
the country, and you say, `Poverty in America?' But you drive off
the roads and over a hill and up a hollow and you get a different
picture.''
   Though Hayes admits the school's contributions are only a bandage
to the plight of the families, he said that ``immersing'' the
Delbarton students in poverty will make them more sensitive when
they are in a position to do something about it.
   ``The only way for people to understand poverty is to have a
total immersing experience in it, to be present in it,'' he said.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court has reversed the last
of three disciplinary suspensions against the presidents of federal
employee unions for actively supporting Democrat Walter Mondale in
the 1984 presidential campaign.
   The ruling by the Second Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals in New
York vacates charges brought in 1985 by the Merit Systems Protection
Board against Vincent R. Sombrotto, president of the National
Association of Letter Carriers, and Moe Biller, president of the
American Postal Workers Union.
   After a series of hearings, the board in 1987 ordered Sombrotto,
Biller and Kenneth Blaylock, former president of the American
Federation of Government Employees, suspended from their government
jobs for 60 days under the 1939 Hatch Act. The three men already had
been on leave from their jobs at the time of the board's ruling.
   Blaylock's suspension was overturned in August by the 11th
Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals in Atlanta.
   The 1939 law _ aimed at protecting public employees from
``machine'' or coercion politics _ forbids government workers from
taking ``an active part in political management or political
campaigns.''
   The charges were brought after all three union presidents urged
their members through union magazines and newspapers to support
Mondale and oppose President Reagan in the 1984 election.
   Sombrotto and Biller also urged the respective 310,000 and
350,000 members of their organizations to contribute to union
political action committees.
   In the ruling issued last Friday and made public Monday, a
three-judge appeals court panel said the Merit Systems Protection
Board failed to show that Biller and Sombrotto had ``acted in
concert'' with the Democratic Party or the Mondale campaign
organization.
   ``It is not enough that the federal employee and the candidate
pursue the same political goals independently,'' the court said in
the 26-page ruling. ``The two must work in tandem or be linked
together for there to be a violation of the Hatch Act.''
   Biller and Sombrotto, while holding various union offices, have
been on leave from their jobs with the Postal Service since 1959 and
1971, respectively.

   Commercial watermelon growers and handlers will
be able to vote Feb. 6-21 on whether to support a proposed research,
advertising and sales promotion program, the Agriculture Department
said Monday.
   J. Patrick Boyle, administrator of the department's Agricultural
Marketing Service, said the program would operate at no cost to the
federal government and would be financed by an assessment of up to 2
cents per 100 pounds of melons.
   The fee would be paid by farmers who grow five acres or more of
watermelons and by ``first handlers,'' or dealers who buy directly
from farmers.
   A 29-member board representing producers, handlers and the
general public would administer the program, Boyle said.
   Two-thirds of those voting in the referendum are required for
approval of the program. Ballots, copies of the proposal and other
details are available from country extension agents where
watermelons are grown, he said.

   President-elect Bush said Monday he sees an
``enormous opportunity'' to forge a new relationship with the Soviet
Union and further the cause of peace.
   In a Christmas greeting to inaugural workers, Bush said he hopes
to strengthen that peace and add to the stock of good will among men.
   Bush and his wife Barbara attended the Christmas party in a stark
government warehouse adjacent to a converted machine-gun factory
where inaugural preparations are under way.
   The vice president donated a bright, red bat and Mrs. Bush a
stuffed bear to the workers' ``Toys for Tots'' drive.
   Bush said he and President Reagan had a ``fascinating'' meeting
with Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev in New York two weeks ago,
and he called the current period a ``promising time in American
history.''
   ``I am not euphorically optimistic about that (U.S.-Soviet)
relationship, but I see enormous opportunity,'' said Bush. ``What
more important assignment does a president have than to work for
world peace?''
   ``We're in a changing world. We see change inside the Soviet
Union. We've seen historic change in Pakistan recently. We hope to
be seeing more change, inextricable change toward democracy in this
hemisphere,'' he said.
   He told more than 500 workers he will be a president who will
``keep our forces strong and keep our defenses up.''
   ``But as we approach Christmas, I think it is important to note
that there is peace on earth, certainly between the major powers ...
and I'd like to add to that ingredient of good will towards men by
working hard to strengthen the peace so that our kids, your kis can
grow up in a world with much more promise of peace,'' he said.
   He predicted ``a rough battle when I get in there in terms of
getting this deficit under control. But when I campaigned and said I
want this to be a kinder and a gentler nation, I believe it very,
very much. And I'm going to work, with the help of all of you to
make that promise come through.''
   Bush joked, ``We are very generous in this line of work. You have
48 hours off for Christmas.''
   ``Only 24!'' a woman shouted.
   ``Make that 24 for some departments,'' said Bush. ``That makes us
double grateful to all of you (who) are willing to make that
sacrifice to make this inauguration the best one yet.''

   Richard Wiener, a candidate in the race to pick

state party leaders from the Midwest.
   The group includes the state party chairs from Ohio, North
Dakota, Minnesota, Kansas, South Dakota, Illinois, Wisconsin,
Nebraska and Indiana as well as vice chairs from several states.
   The 14 said they have worked closely with Wiener, know him well
and ``believe he is the best-equipped candidate to build an
effective campaign machine at the Democratic National Committee. We
know that our next chair must be a professional campaign manager
with a proven record of victory.''
   The announcement of support marked the second time that Wiener,
outgoing head of the association of state party leaders, has lined
up a block of endorsements from statewide party officials. A group
of Western leaders endorsed his candidacy several days ago.
   Not included on the new list was the vice chair from Wiener's
home state of Michigan. Nancy Austin Schwartz did not immediately
return a phone call seeking comment.
   The Democratic National Committee meets Feb. 9 and 10 to elect a
new chairman.

<TEXT>
   Two historic row houses once targeted for
demolition were turned over to low-income families Monday after a
$1.5 million renovation that officials said is helping to revitalize
a depressed section of north Philadelphia.
   ``It's like a Christmas present to me, because I was in a
must-move situation,'' said Tamara Fletcher, 26, who had been living
with her two sons in a home that recently was condemned. ``This
couldn't have come at a better time.''
   Eleven other families, some living in shelters for the homeless,
also will be moving into the brightly lit, blue-carpeted apartments,
which were refurbished through a public and private partnership
organized by National Temple Non-Profit Corp., a north Philadelphia
community group.
   ``North Philadelphia is on its way back,'' Mayor W. Wilson Goode
said during ribbon-cutting ceremonies Monday morning.
   The city provided no-interest loans and tax breaks, and funding
came from the Cigna Corp., Ford Foundation, National Trust for
Historic Preservation, William Penn Foundation and Mellon Bank
(East).
   The two houses that once belonged to wealthy 19th-century
Philadelphians were renamed the Waller House after doors were carved
through the common wall during renovation.
   The residents, all of whom earn less than 50 percent of the
Philadelphia-area median income, which totals $17,400 for a family
of four, will pay a maximum of 30 percent of their income for rent
and utilities.
   They had to apply through National Temple and must abide by rules
to keep up the apartments or face eviction, said Judy Burrell,
property manager.
   ``I am so excited,'' Ms. Fletcher said. ``If I have to stay up
day and night, I'm going to try to get things together, so I can set
my Christmas tree up.''
   Just a few years ago, the house into which she and her sons moved
Monday had been inhabitable.
   ``The front steps of the building had been stolen,'' said Henry
Magaziner, an architect who helped plan the renovation. ``The doors
were bashed in, the windows were busted, rain had been pouring into
the building, the roof was leaking.''
   A former owner, social worker Deborah Roye Morris, said she saved
the building from a wrecking ball in 1982. She drove by one day as a
hole was punched in one wall and was able to stop the demolition,
she said.
   City Housing Director Edward A. Schwartz said he has noticed
others taking action because of the renovation work.
   A number of people whose houses had been condemned in north
Philadelphia recently asked for a reprieve, offering to reinvest in
the community, Schwartz said.
   ``That's a sign that people are sitting up and taking notice,''
he said.
   The trend is also visible in some large mortgages that banks have
approved during the past six months, he said.
   Anti-drug efforts, job training, improved schools and commercial
development also figure into the picture, he said.
   ``So that gradually the elements that make a viable urban
comunity are put into place and people have confidence that they can
stay and move here and improve their quality of life.''

   A sports publication says President Reagan may
become a member of the board of directors of the Los Angeles Dodgers
baseball team after he leaves office, but the White House said
Monday it was too soon to consider such things.
   ``He has not considered any post-presidential matters and will
not until after January 20,'' said White House assistant press
secretary Mark Weinberg, who will be Reagan's press representative
after his term ends.
   The report in Sports, inc., the sports business weekly, quoted
Peter O'Malley, president of the Dodgers, as saying there had been
no formal discussions with Reagan but ``quite frankly, the idea does
appeal to me.''
   Federal law prohibits a White House occupant from making
commitments to post-presidential jobs before leaving office.
   Reagan's former director of communications, Thomas C. Griscom,
told the magazine the job sounded ``very much like something
President Reagan would enjoy.''
   Reagan's first job in radio involved broadcasting re-creations of
baseball games from wire reports. As an actor, he played the part of
troubled baseball great Grover Cleveland Alexander in the 1952 film,
``The Winning Team.''
   First lady Nancy Reagan threw out the ceremonial first ball in
October in Los Angeles as the Dodgers opened their National League
playoff series against the New York Mets.
   After the Dodgers won the World Series against the Oakland A's,
Reagan invited the team to the White House and told them on Oct. 26,
``In my job, you're president of all the people, and you're not
supposed to play favorites. But I must confess that after the World
Series began I just knew the winner was going to be a team from
California.''

   President-elect Bush said Monday that U.S.
national security officials should take part in a review of Third
World debt because of ``enormous problems'' in the Western
Hemisphere.
   The World Bank estimates Third World debt as $1.32 trillion,
including $442 billion in Latin America and the Caribbean.
   Bush said there is concern that private banks have not been
lending as much as they might.
   ``And so I do think that should be subject to a major review
which will include not just the Treasury but our national security
people because we've got enormous problems, particularly in our own
hemisphere, on Third World debt,'' he said.
   He did not point to any of the debtor countries, some of which
have long histories of military coups.
   Bush spoke of possible problems in forgiveness of debt.
   European creditor governments have forgiven some debt, especially
in the poorest countries of Africa. Debts owed to the U.S.
government could only be forgiven if Congress voted to do it, which
is considered unliklely.
   Some forgiveness of debt by private banks has also been widely
proposed.
   ``I think you have to be very careful of forgiveness of debt if
you want future loans,'' Bush said. ``So I think we've got to find a
more versatile answer than simply compelling private institutions to
write off the debt.''
   U.S. banks would be certain to question the legality of any
attempt to force them into debt forgiveness.
   Bush said forgiveness would dry up the $20 billion in additional
bank lending urged in 1985 by James A. Baker III, who was then
treasury secretary. Baker will be secretary of state under Bush.
   Sen. Bill Bradley, D-N.J., who has urged some forgiveness,
quickly said the rest of the world has known for years that Baker's
ideas were unworkable.
   ``I am happy that the president-elect recognizes that we need a
new approach,'' he said in a statement. ``If he is serious about
encouraging and supporting economic reform in the developing world,
he will have to consider interest or debt reduction in many cases _
as I have argued for six years.''
   Fifteen Third World countries with the biggest debts have begun
reducing them again, the International Monetary Fund reports.
   These countries, singled out by Baker in 1985, increased their
debt last year by $2 billion after reductions in 1985 and 1986. But
in the first six months of this year there was a $9 billion
reduction.
   The fund's Bureau of Statistics did not give a total for the debt
of the 15 countries in its study, made available Monday in the
official ``IMF Survey'' dated Dec. 12. The World Bank, sister
organization of the fund, released figures on Sunday that added up
to $519.3 billion for the 15.

   King Fahd of Saudi Arabia praised U.S.
negotiations with the PLO and the Iran-Iraq truce as he led his five
Gulf Cooperation Council allies into the oil giants' first peacetime
summit Monday.
   Leaders resplendent in gold-rimmed cloaks and white turbans heard
an opening speech by the Emir of Bahrain, Sheik Isa bin Salman al
Khalifa, before retiring behind closed doors to focus on
accelerating Iran-Iraq peace talks and supporting the quest for a
Palestinian homeland.
   ``The summit coincides with the emergence of a climate of peace
in the gulf, the end of the war between Iraq and Iran,'' said Isa.
``We hope this will contribute to normal relations and balanced
policies that in turn will return confidence and restore the
war-shattered bridges so that peace may be revived.''
   All Gulf Council states supported Iraq in the eight-year war that
ended in August with a U.N.-negotiated cease-fire.
   The council was formed at the beginning of that war. It binds
Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and
Qatar in an economic and military pact to strengthen security
because of the Iran-Iraq war and Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's
threats to export Iran's Islamic revolution.
   Isa praised Palestinians waging a year-old uprising against
Israel in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. He also pledged the
council's ``unwavering support'' for the state declared in the
occupied lands by the Palestine Liberation Organization.
   He promised the gulf states would help contain Lebanon's
protracted civil war and ``salvage the Lebanese people.''
   Earlier, Fahd lauded the United States for beginning last week a
dialogue with the PLO ``toward a genuine and just peace for the
Palestinian people,'' the Gulf News Agency reported.
   Washington reversed a 13-year ban on talks with what it called a
terrorist organization after PLO chairman Yasser Arafat renounced
terrorism and recognized Israel's right to exist.
   ``It is perhaps a good omen that the ninth GCC summit is convened
in an atmosphere of blissful breakthroughs, namely the end of the
war between two Moslem neighbors _ Iran and Iraq _ and the
commencement of direct negotiations between them.''
   Officials said the gulf leaders will discuss economic integration
during four-day talks and ways of mustering a united front within
the 13-nation Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to help
stabilize production and prices. Gulf Council states account for 40
percent of the world's proven oil supplies.
   Their charter calls for a gulf common market patterned after the
European Community, but critics say progress in that direction has
been painfully slow.

<HEAD>Britain to Pay Farmers Millions to Kill Hens, Destroy Eggs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government announced Monday it will help
farmers weather a national scare over food poisoning with payments
of more than $34 million to destroy millions of young hens and
surplus eggs.
   One British newspaper called the crisis ``the storm in an
eggcup.'' It already has cost a deputy health minister her job.
   Government officials have reported 49 outbreaks of salmonella
from eggs affecting 1,000 people, but they say many more cases are
unreported.
   The scare burst into the open Dec. 3 when Edwina Currie, an
outspoken deputy health minister, said most British eggs were
tainted by salmonella bacteria, a form of food poisoning that can be
fatal in rare cases. Egg sales plummeted by up to 60 percent, and
Mrs. Currie was forced to resign Friday.
   The same day, the government launched a $925,000 advertising
campaign to try to make Britons buy eggs again.
   Under Monday's $34.6-million package to bail out producers, the
government over the next four weeks will buy 400 million eggs to
burn _ the equivalent of two weeks' normal consumption, now unwanted
by wary consumers.
   In addition, 4 million hens will be destroyed, mostly by gassing.
That number equals about a tenth of the national laying flock.
   The bailout will allow farmers to trim their flocks and lower
their costs.
   Opposition legislators and media commentators complained that
farmers had no right to a subsidy from the Conservative government
of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.
   Opposition Labor Party legislator Clare Short said the government
had bowed to farming interests without making it ``conditional on
cleaning up their act.''
   ``The farmers are a big, powerful lobby, so the government
responded to them and shows no concern for members of the public,''
Ms. Short said.
   ``The storm in an eggcup is a good indication of the
Conservatives' instincts,'' commented The Independent, a British
national newspaper. ``They decided to protect producers at the
expense of consumers and taxpayers.''
   Some critics complained that Agriculture Minister John MacGregor,
who announced the payment in the House of Commons, did nothing to
clear up confusion over the extent of the danger.
   MacGregor said that if people boil eggs until they are hard and
avoid foods made with raw eggs ``then the risks are very, very small
indeed.''
   Farming organizations said the money, to be given in a single
payment, was not enough.

<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Employees of a federally owned
uranium-processing plant who still want safety improvements ended a
10-week strike and returned to work Monday for reorientation
sessions.
   The plant's operator, Westinghouse Materials Co. of Ohio, said
the safety and refresher orientations will take much of the week.
Westinghouse spokesman Bob Walker said production of uranium, used
in other Energy Department plants nationwide for the government's
production of nuclear weapons, will resume after the sessions.
   ``It's basically a reorientation, safety sessions, safety
training. Before we can restart production, we're going to have to
recertify people on a lot of equipment. So it's going to be several
days before we're going to start producing,'' Walker said.
   Operations at the plant 18 miles northwest of here, formally
known as the Feed Materials Production Center, will return to normal
after holiday vacations end at the beginning of January, Walker said.
   ``I think getting back to work is the beginning of the
solution,'' said David Day, president of the Fernald Atomic Trades
and Labor Council, a 14-union coalition at the plant. ``We had to
get back into the plant to help make things safe and to address some
of the other problems.''
   Westinghouse officials said as many as 400 employees returned to
work Monday. An additional 250 striking employees were laid off two
weeks ago because of declining demands from other Energy Department
operations for the Fernald plant's uranium.
   In order to return to work, the unions agreed to separate pending
safety grievances with Westinghouse from the three-year contract,
which union members approved Saturday by a 3-to-1 ratio. The strike
began Oct. 7, halting production.
   For Monday's reorientation, union workers were bused from the
plant's 1,050-acre site to a suburban Cincinnati movie theater to
see a film. They returned Monday afternoon to the plant for
classroom sessions.
   Union workers are concerned about exposure to radioactive
materials, including uranium and plutonium, a weapons-grade
substance to which plant workers occasionally have been exposed in
handling wastes accepted for temporary storage from other plants.
   The unions plan to continue negotiations on a separate agreement
covering health and environmental issues. The contract approved
Saturday includes a new health insurance program, and no pay
increase. Under the agreement, workers may pursue up to 4,000 safety
and health grievances against Westinghouse, which initially offered
to pay workers $150 each to drop their grievances.
   Officials at the 37-year-old plant are under pressure from the
state and a lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court by plant
neighbors, to clean up thousands of pounds and barrels of toxic and
radioactive wastes stored on site.
   The Energy Department has pledged itself to a cleanup at the
plant that is estimated to cost $1 billion, and has begun some
cleanup work and studies. But political leaders, employees and
neighbors are concerned that a long-term report, issued last week by
the Energy Department, recommends closing Fernald in a few years.
Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, has said he thinks the cleanup will get a
higher priority if the plant remains open.

<HEAD>Government Gives $91 Million to California S&L to Save Two Ohio
Thrifts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal regulators said Monday they are
contributing $91 million to an Oakland, Calif, savings institution
to rescue two Ohio S&Ls.
   The Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp., which insures
deposits up to $100,000 in the nation's 3,000 S&Ls, is providing
Golden West Financial Corp., one of the largest S&L holding
companies in the nation, with $91 million in cash. It also is
purchasing bad loans of the failed institutions for $29 million and
guaranteeing Golden West against some future loss.
   The FSLIC is receiving back 75 percent of the gains on some of
the loans owned by the failed institutions _ Ohio Valley Savings and
Loan Association, Steubenville, and First Border Savings Bank of
Piqua, which have $318 million in combined assets.
   Also, Golden West is paying $8 million over three years to FSLIC
in exchange for tax benefits created by the deal. In addition, it is
pumping $20 million into the acquired thrifts, whose six offices
reopened Monday as branches of World Savings and Loan of Ohio.
   The Federal Home Loan Bank Board, the parent agency of the FSLIC,
blamed the failure of Ohio Valley to losses on ``a large volume of
out-of-state commercial real estate loans and unsecured commercial
loans.'' It attributed First Border's insolvency to ``excessive
growth and speculation in financial futures markets.''
   The bank board so far this year has ``resolved'' the cases of 159
failed S&Ls, a post-Depression record, mostly through assisted
mergers. Bank board Chairman M. Danny Wall has said he wants to
finish another 40 cases in the next two weeks to take advantage of
expiring tax breaks.

<HEAD>Fitzwater: Bush Met Jim Bakker Before Campaign, But Asked for
Nothing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   George Bush met with television evangelist Jim
Bakker at a time when he was gearing up for his presidential run
against another TV preacher, Pat Robertson, but a Bush spokesman
said Monday the vice president ``didn't ask for anything or promise
anything.''
   Comments by White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater and Bush's
onetime press secretary Pete Teeley left some confusion over the
purpose for the November 1985 meeting at Bakker's headquarters in
Charlotte, N.C.
   Fitzwater, who attended the meeting, initially told a White House
press briefing Monday that it was to seek support for Bush's
forthcoming presidential race. But later he said he had misspoken
and that the meeting was not political, but rather was in Bush's
capacity as vice president _ ``a standard meeting of the kind that
we had hundreds of. The vice president didn't ask for anything or
promise anything.''
   Fitzwater, who was Bush's vice presidential press secretary and
will be White House press secretary when Bush takes office in
January, made the comments at his daily briefing at the White House
where he is currently President Reagan's spokesman.
   His account conflicted with that of Teeley, who at the time of
the Bush-Bakker meeting was working as a marketing consultant for
Bakker's PTL ministry.
   Teeley said Monday that Bush's meeting with Bakker was part of
``coalition building'' for the future presidential race and that the
vice president met with many evangelical leaders for the same
purpose, including the Rev. Billy Graham, the Rev. Jerry Falwell and
the Rev. Robert Schuler.
   ``Those things were done every day. ... It didn't matter where
you were _ Pittsburgh, Charlotte or Miami _ if you could meet with
some people who were active politically, you tried to sit down and
talk with them,'' Teeley said in telephone interview.
   Fitzwater, answering questions at Monday's briefing, initially
had said Bush ``was seeking his support for the campaign,
absolutely. ... You have hundreds of meetings like that when you're
running for president.''
   Later Fitzwater said that was not the correct characterization,
that the only support Bush sought was for the Reagan
administration's policies.
   In March 1987, Bakker stepped down from his PTL ministry, as his
sexual involvement with former church secretary Jessica Hahn created
headlines. At the time Bush met him, there had been no disclosure of
such activity by Bakker.
   A report Sunday in The Washington Post contained an allegation by
former Bakker bodyguard Don Hardister that Bush and Bakker talked
about a possible admihistration job for Bakker.
   Asked about that report, Fitzwater told reporters, ``I don't know
what Bakker thought. There was no talk of jobs or payoffs or
anything else. It was a simple meeting as the vice president had
with hundreds of other people and individuals asking their support
... asking his support for various policies and so forth.
   ``They talked about their Christian beliefs. They talked about
the Robertson campaign. It was just a friendly discussion,''
Fitzwater told the briefing.
   Bush met with Bakker and his wife, Tammy Faye, in November 1985,
as he was looking ahead to his race for the GOP presidential
nomination. Eventually he defeated Robertson, host of the popular
``700 Club'' Christian television show, in the primaries. The Bush
forces had been concerned about Robertson's unknown potential to
pull votes from the religious right.
   Besides Bush's own meeting with Bakker, the vice president had
three close associates whom Bakker hired as consultants: Teeley;
Doug Weed, a sometime guest host on the ``700 Club'' who worked as a
liaison for Bush's campaign with religious groups; and Dean Burch,
former head of the Federal Communications Commission and the
Republican National Committee.
   Weed currently works for the Bush presidential transition staff
as a liaison with religious groups.
   Teeley, who acknowledged earning $120,000 for his PTL work, said
his work for Bakker pertained to marketing and had no relation to
Bush or politics.

<TEXT>
   A winter storm over the Rocky Mountains on Monday produced snow
across much of the West, and rain was reported from the Texas
Panhandle through Oklahoma and into Kansas.
   Snow continued falling during the afternoon in the southern
mountains of Colorado, with between 4 and 8 inches accumulating in
the San Juan and Uncompahgre mountains. The snow caused poor
visibility and slippery roads.
   Rain and snow also continued in parts of New Mexico. The
combination of heavy rainfall and runoff from the mountains caused
some creeks to swell near Ruidoso, and minor flooding was reported.
   Winds gusted to 63 mph at Ruidoso and 58 mph at Albuquerque, and
snow advisories were posted for mountain areas of New Mexico.
   Areas of northern Arizona picked up some snow overnight and into
Monday morning. Flagstaff received 3 to 4 inches, and Pinetop and
Lakeside reported 2 inches along with blowing snow.
   Snow also fell in parts of Utah, where up to 7 inches was
reported in Provo, Orem and Springville.
   The storm also sent snow in the mountainous regions of northern
California, where snowfall totals were expected between 3 and 5
inches in the higher elevations.
   Elsewhere, a winter storm watch was posted for Tuesday in parts
of Michigan. Some areas of the Upper Peninsula could receive more
than 8 inches of snow, the National Weather Service said.
   Heavier rainfall during the six hours ending at 1 p.m. EST
included more than a third of an inch at Sacramento, Calif.; a third
of an inch at Crescent City, Calif.; and over a quarter-inch at
Ukiah.
   Snowfall during the same six hours included an inch at Kalispell,
Mont., and Winnemucca, Nev.
   Temperatures early Monday tumbled to well below the freezing mark
in parts of northern Florida. Considerable damage was reported by
some vegetable growers, but the citrus crop escaped with little or
no damage.
   Temperatures were in the teens and 20s in New York, New England
and parts of the northern and central Rockies, and from North Dakota
across Minnesota and into upper Michigan.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 7
degrees at Jackson, Wyo., to 79 degrees at Alice, Texas. The
nation's low Monday morning was 20 degrees below zero at Jackson.
   For Tuesday, the forecast called for a low pressure area moving
across the Mississippi Valley to spread rain across the Ohio Valley
and into the lower Great Lakes, with snow in Minnesota and upper
Michigan. A cold front trailing south from the low was expected to
trigger rain showers and a few thunderstorms from eastern Texas to
Missouri.
   Snow was forecast in in Utah and northern Arizona, in inland area
of the Pacific Northwest, and in Maine; rain showers in the
remainder of New England; and rain on the Pacific Northwest coast.
   Highs in the teens and 20s were forecast for the Dakotas,
Minnesota, Michigan, Montana, much of Wyoming and southeast Idaho;
in the 30s and 40s from the Pacific Northwest across the Great
Basin, much of the central and southern Rockies, the central Plains
and much of the upper Great Lakes; and in the 50s and 60s in most of
the rest of the nation.

   An 11-year-old Palestinian boy died Monday from
head injuries that his family said he suffered when he was pushed
from a military jeep in the occupied West Bank.
   An army spokesman confirmed the boy died but said a preliminary
investigation revealed no connection between the boy's death and the
army. He said the army was still investigating.
   In other violence, troops shot and wounded nine Palestinians in
clashes in the occupied Gaza Strip, Arab hospital officals said.
   The clashes took place in the refugee camps of Khan Yunis and
Nusseirat, where soldiers opened fire on dozens of masked youths who
hurled rocks at army patrols, Arab reports said.
   Palestinian doctors said 11-year-old Badr Karada of Nablus died
at east Jerusalem's Mukassad Hospital of trauma injuries to the
head, which he suffered Dec. 10. They said relatives told them he
was pushed from an army jeep after being detained by troops.
   Officials at St. John's Hospital in Nablus said the boy was first
brought there by residents of the city's Sumara neighborhood who
said they saw the child pushed out of an army jeep.
   The hospital officials said relatives claimed Karada was detained
while riding his bicycle near his home in Ras El Ein, a neighborhood
about a half- mile from where he allegedly was pushed from the jeep.
   ``We're not aware of any eyewitness reports that would connect
this boy to falling off a jeep or even being held by soldiers,'' the
army spokesman said. ``We are looking for someone who saw this.''
   Before Monday's death, 332 Palestinians had been killed during
the year-long Arab revolt against Israeli occupation of the West
Bank and Gaza Strip. Thirteen Israelis also have been killed.
   Also Monday, Palestinians shut shops and schools on the third day
of a general strike throughout the West Bank and Gaza. The army
imposed or maintained curfews on at least eight towns and refugee
camps that were scenes of unrest Sunday, the Arab reports said.
   Left-wing Israelis, meanwhile, announced formation of a human
rights group to monitor abuses in the occupied territories. The
group was named Betzelim, or ``image'' in English, a reference to
the biblical phrase ``God created man in his own image.''
   ``We formed the group to save the human image of Israel, that's
why we chose this name,'' Roni Tamor, one of the founders, said in
an interview.
   She said the organization of about 60 leftist authors,
journalists and lawyers would collect affidavits and statements
about abuses, as well as lobby parliament about human rights
violations.
   In another development, the attorney general's office ordered an
investigation into a complaint by two brothers from the West Bank
town of Taibe that they were severely beaten by agents of the Shin
Bet security service, the Hebrew-language daily Maariv reported.
   Abed El Nasser Jabli and Abed El Khaim Jabli said they were
beaten while detained on charges of illegal possession of weapons,
the newspaper said.
   At the United Nations in New York, Secretary-General Javier Perez
de Cuellar repeated his calls for Israeli troops to stop using live
ammunition against civilians.
   ``The secretary-general is naturally following the situation in
the occupied territories very closely. He is deeply concerned by
press reports of casualties sustained during the past few days, in
particular deaths resulting from the use of live ammunition,'' said
his spokeswoman, Nadia Younes.

<HEAD>Palme's Widow Identified Murder Suspect, TV Claims</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The widow of assassinated Prime Minister
Olof Palme picked out of a police lineup a 41-year-old Swede
suspected of his murder, Swedish TV reported Monday.
   The Channel 2 news program ``Rapport'' quoted an unidentified,
``well-connected'' source close to the investigation as saying that
Mrs. Lisbet Palme identified Christer Petterson as the killer.
   Palme was shot from behind on Feb. 28, 1986, on a central
Stockholm street as he and his wife were walking home unguarded from
a movie after saying good night to their son Marten, who saw the
movie with them.
   According to the broadcast, the source said both Mrs. Palme and
her son identified the suspect with varying degrees of certainty,
but it gave no details.
   After the murder, the son reported having seen a man who appeared
to be following his parents.
   Petterson's lawyer, Arne Liljeros; the prosecutor, and police
heading the investigation said they had no comment on the TV report.
``Rapport'' did not say when the lineup took place, but it
apparently would have been either Sunday or Monday.
   Petterson, who has a long criminal record including a
manslaughter conviction, was arrested on Wednesday. He pleaded
innocent, but a district court judge found the prosecution had shown
reasonable grounds to suspect him of Palme's murder and ordered him
held for investigation.
   Both sides agreed, however, that publication of Petterson's
picture in the foreign press and the fact that nearly three years
passed since the shooting assassination weakened the value of
witness identification. No reports emerged of any admissions made
during interrogation or that the police uncovered more tangible
evidence, such as the revolver used in the shooting.
   A scandal stemming from the murder investigation ended Monday
when the state awarded partial payment of a private investigator's
bill.
   The amateur detective, book publisher Ebbe Carlsson, will get
$4,107 of a $200,875 expense account he submitted, the national TT
news agency reported.
   The disclosure of Carlsson's private search and his attempt to
smuggle illegal surveillance equipment into Sweden triggered a
political crisis for the governing Social Democratic government. It
forced the resignation last June of Justice Minister Anna-Greta
Leijon, who secretly backed the project.

<HEAD>Technician Testifies Hairs Forcibly Removed From Lisa's Head</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SAMUEL MAULL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hairs that were yanked out of Lisa Steinberg's
head were found entangled in clothing fibers of the man accused of
beating her to death, a police laboratory technician testified
Monday.
   Detective Francis Callery said he also found hair from Joel
Steinberg's former live-in companion, Hedda Nussbaum, on the
exercise bar police confiscated during a search of the couple's
Greenwich Village apartment.
   Ms. Nussbaum, 46, testified two weeks ago that Steinberg beat her
on her legs and head with the bar.
   Steinberg, a 47-year-old disbarred lawyer, is charged with
second-degree murder in the fatal beating of Lisa, a child he and
Ms. Nussbaum illegally adopted shortly after her birth.
   Another prosecution witness, a neighbor of the couple, testified
Monday that she heard slapping and screaming at various times coming
from the Steinberg apartment before the night Lisa was fatally
injured.
   Lisa's death in an affluent, well-educated household attracted
wide attention and raised the issue of the responsibility of
neighbors, teachers and social workers to recognize and report
evidence of child abuse.
   Callery said the hair found in Steinberg's clothing ``in my
opinion, came from Lisa Steinberg.'' He added that for hair to be
entangled in clothing fibers ``there is usually some kind of
struggle.''
   Adrian DiLuzio, one of Steinberg's two lawyers, said outside the
courtroom after he cross-examined Callery that the technician's
testimony was irrelevant.
   ``You can't put any times on when the hair came off the head or
even the circumstances under which it came off,'' DiLuzio said.
   Lisa was removed unconscious from Steinberg's apartment the
morning of Nov. 2, 1987, and taken to a nearby hospital where she
died three days later.
   Steinberg denies that he hit the girl, but Ms. Nussbaum,
Steinberg's former live-in companion, said he told her the night
Lisa was fatally injured that he had ``knocked Lisa down and she
didn't want to get up.''
   The former neighbor who testified Monday, Joan Bonano, said she
called police three or four times after hearing yelling and sounds
of violence coming from the Steinberg apartment two floors above her
ground-floor flat.
   ``I heard noises like slapping, screaming, loud male voices, like
yelling,'' she testified.
   Mrs. Bonano also testifed that Ms. Nussbaum appeared increasingly
battered in the years before Lisa died, and that by November 1987,
Ms. Nussbaum was limping. Charges against Ms. Nussbaum were dropped
after prosecutors concluded she was too badly battered to have
prevented Lisa's death.

<HEAD>Federal Regulators Offer Cities Foreclosed Properties To House
Homeless</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal regulators said Monday they are
offering to make foreclosed properties from failed savings
institutions available to house the homeless in a half dozen cities.
   Karl Hoyle, a spokesman for Federal Home Loan Bank Board Chairman
M. Danny Wall, said the agency, which regulates the nation's 3,000
S&Ls, is talking with six or seven cities in Texas and in the North
and Midwest. He declined to identify them.
   Hoyle said the bank board would lend the properties _ in some
cases commercial buildings near soup kitchens _ to municipal
governments, which in turn would pay to administer them as temporary
shelters.
   ``That ball is in their court at this juncture. They have to
decide if they have the funds,'' he said. ``We would like to get it
done in the winter when this housing would be most useful to the
homeless.''
   Discussions with the cities started several months ago, Hoyle
said. Another effort, to persuade private groups to purchase
foreclosed homes from the bank board and rehabilitate them for poor
families, began about a year ago, he said.
   Wall disclosed the homeless initiative in a speech to a group
called the National Housing Conference on the same day that
President-elect Bush, in announcing the appointment of Rep. Jack
Kemp, R-N.Y., as secretary of housing and urban development, said
his administration would seek innovative solutions to the problem of
homelessness.
   On another topic, Hoyle said the bank board late Monday forwarded
to the Treasury Department the outline of a plan for a ``reinsurance
agency'' that would serve as a mechanism for channeling funds to the
ailing S&L industry.
   The bank board's insurance fund, the Federal Savings and Loan
Insurance Corp., has been paying for a record number of S&L rescues
this year through its normal income, primarily an assessment on
still-operating institutions.
   Wall has argued previously that the fees paid by S&Ls to the
FSLIC, as well as by banks and credit unions to separate insurance
funds, were meant to cover a ``normal'' level of failures, not the
``catastrophic'' level of the current thrift crisis.
   Through Monday, regulators said they have resolved the cases of
159 insolvent thrifts this year. More than 400 insolvent S&Ls remain
open and hundreds of others are close to insolvency.
   According to an administration source, who declined to be named,
the Treasury Department estimates the cost of restoring the thrift
industry to health at $60 billion to $75 billion if interest rates
remain unchanged and as high as $105 billion if interest rates
increase by 2 percentage points.
   The reinsurance agency would have oversight over three insurance
funds _ for banks, S&Ls and credit unions. It could collect premiums
from all three agencies, using it when one of the funds got in
trouble. It also could serve as the mechanism for further borrowing
to pay for the thrift crisis or as the conduit for any money
Congress wanted to spend on the cleanup.
   Bank board member Lawrence White, in an interview, said the
proposal leaves open who will pay for the S&L cleanup and whether
the new agency's expenditures would be counted toward the budget
deficit.
   ``I don't think it is intended to a back door way off getting
them (banks and credit unions) to pay for the FSLIC's current
problems,'' White said. ``The concept is both a funding mechanism
and a forward looking means of dealing with catastrophic costs'' in
the future.
   Meanwhile, The New York Times reported in weekend editions that
the Reagan administration, in its 1990 budget, will acknowledge for
the first time that some taxpayer money must be spent on the problem.

   A member of the PLO's executive committee
said Monday that PLO leader Yasser Arafat's statements which led to
PLO-U.S. talks were only ``Arafat's personal opinion.''
   The statement could represent a serious policy split within the
ranks of the governing body of the Palestine Liberation Organization.
   In Jerusalem, Israeli Premier Yitzhak Shamir told a conference on
the Nazi Holocaust on Monday that the latest PLO statements about
peace were a trick and said worldwide support for Israel was needed
to prevent ``a future holocaust.''
   Shamir said the United States and West Europe were deluded into
accepting the PLO and vowed that Israel would never negotiate with
the PLO, an umbrella organization which includes Arafat's mainstream
Fatah group. Shamir says the PLO is made up of terrorists bent on
driving Israel into the sea.
   Mustafa el-Zibri, a member of the PLO executive committee, said
Arafat's statements in Geneva explicitly recognizing Israel's right
to exist and renouncing all forms of terrorism, were ``incompatible
with the resolutions of the latest Palestine National Council
meeting.''
   He signed the statement with his guerrilla name, Abu Ali Mustafa.
The statement was telefaxed from Damascus, Syria, to The Associated
Press office in Nicosia. The office of the Popular Front for the
Liberation of Palestine in Damascus confirmed that he issued the
statement.
   The statement could represent serious dissent because of Zibri's
seat on the PLO's 15-member governing body, which includes
representatives of six Palestinian guerrilla groups as well as
independents. Fatah has three seats.
   Zibri is the sole committee representative of the Popular Front,
a Marxist group headed by George Habash. It was not known
immediately whether Habash endorsed his statement.
   The Palestine National Council, the PLO's legislative arm, met in
Algeria last month to declare an independent Palestinian state. It
implicitly recognized Israel's existence and renounced terrorism,
but it said it would continue attacking Israeli military targets in
the occupied territories.
   Habash later told Arafat, ``We're backing your efforts because
this is what the majority wants. But we don't believe moderation
will pay.''
   Arafat said Wednesday that the PLO recognizes the right of all
parties to the Middle East conflict ``to exist in peace and security
... including the state of Palestine, Israel and other neighbors.''
   He also said, ``We totally and absolutely renounce all forms of
terrorism, including individual terrorism, group and state
terrorism.'' He uses the term ``state terrorism'' to refer to
activities by the Israeli defense forces.
   His statements led to a U.S. announcement that the PLO met U.S.
conditions for direct contact and to the opening of U.S.-PLO talks
in Tunisia on Friday.
   Habash said Thursday the U.S. decision was only taken to end
American isolation and said ``we urge our masses to keep up the
struggle to force Israel and the United States to recognize the
state of Palestine.''
   Zibry's statement Monday said, ``The statements made by ...
(Arafat) in Geneva were incompatible with the resolutions of the
latest PNC meeting and he (Arafat) expressed only his personal
opinion.''
   ``His statements only whetted the U.S. appetite to extort
(concessions from) the Palestinian revolution and the PLO. The
United States is still seeking to scuttle the intefadeh,'' he said,
using the Arabic word for the year-old uprising of Palestinians in
the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza strip.
   ``We shall continue to exercise our legitimate rights ... in
struggling against the occupation with all means available,
including armed struggle, until ... establishment of the independent
Palestinian state on soil of the homeland.''

<TEXT>
   Novelist Isabel Allende declared Monday
that the defeat of military President Augusto Pinochet in a
political referendum was ``an historic moment'' and that democracy
has been restored to Chile.
   She made the comments at a news conference in Santiago during her
first trip back to her homeland after 13 years of self-imposed exile.
   The author of the best-selling ``House of the Spirits'' also said
Pinochet is a dictator like others who have ruled Latin American
countries.
   ``I'm not really interested in talking about him personally
because he's no different from other cases and is not a particularly
interesting person.''
   However, she said she wept when she learned in October that
Chileans rejected by 3.9 million to 3.1 million a proposal that Gen.
Pinochet remain in power until 1997.
   ``I believe the silent decision that every Chilean made on Oct. 5
is an historic moment in the return of democracy,'' she said.
   She was in Venezuela at the time and telephoned Santiago to
discuss the results with Hortensia Allende, widow of ousted civilian
President Salvador Allende. ``We couldn't talk, we just cried,'' she
said.
   Mrs. Allende's father was a cousin of Salvador Allende, the
Marxist who died when Pinochet toppled his elected government in a
bloody 1973 coup.
   Pinochet's referendum defeat obliged him to call elections for
next December. He is to hand over power in March 1990.
   Mrs. Allende, 46, has written three novels since she left Chile
in 1975 for self-exile in Venezuela, where she remained for 13
years. This year, she moved to San Francisco.
   She returned to Chile on Saturday for a two-week visit with
family and said of her homeland: ``It feels the same, like not a day
has passed.''
   But she said she had no plans to re-establish residence in the
country.
   She said that while abroad ``every time I've had a chance to talk
publicly about Chile and condemn the dictatorship I've done so.''
   ``I believe my mission ends with the arrival of democracy in
Chile,'' she said, adding: ``I believe it has arrived.''
   Mrs. Allende said she now is preparing a book of short stories,
including material culled from her third and latest novel, ``Eva
Luna.'' The book describes the experiences of an uneducated but
savvy peasant girl who seeks her fortune in a Venezuelan city.
   ``House of the Spirits,'' which was published in more than a
dozen languages, is the saga of several generations of a Chilean
family living in Santiago.
   Asked to comment on critics who compare her work with that of
renowned Colombian author Gabriel Garcia Marquez, she quipped:
``This must make Garcia Marquez unhappy.''
   She said she is influenced by Garcia Marquez and Pablo Neruda,
the late Nobel Prize-winning Chilean poet. She said her work and
Garcia Marquez' share only a style known as ``magical realism''
which mixes fantasy with reality.

involvement with plant in Libya</NOTE>

   Libya is capable of producing chemical weapons
and ``is on the verge of full-scale production,'' the State
Department said Monday.
   Registering concern, spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley urged all nations
to deny technology to Libya and also Iran and Iraq. She said Japan
had severed its connection with Libya's chemical weapons facility.
   Meanwhile, L. Paul Bremer, director of the department's
counter-terrorism office, cited two reasons for concern about Libya.
   ``This is a country which has a longstanding, close relationship
with some of the world's most murderous terrorist groups, the Irish
Republican Army, (Palestinian radical) Abu Nidal and the Japanese
Red Army,'' he said.
   ``Second, Libya has been willing in the past to provide very
destructive weapons to those groups without apparent concern how
much damage they could do.''
   Bremer, in an Associated Press interview, cited the supply of
SA-7 surface-to-air missiles and plastic explosives manufactured in
Czechoslovakia to the IRA.
   ``There is no evidence that the Libyans have exercised any
self-restraint on themselves,'' he said. ``The fact you've got the
Libyans with a chemical weapons capability, the historic ties and
the propensity to turn heavy-duty stuff over to terrorists makes it
a concern-raising situation.''
   Bremer said there was no evidence yet that Libya had provided
chemical agents to terrorists. ``It just isn't there,'' he said.
But, he added, ``you have to be concerned they either would turn it
over or use it themselves against another state.''
   Published reports place the chemical facility in the recesses of
a mountain chain 35 miles from Libya's Mediterranean coast. U.S.
concern is heightened by Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi's anti-Israel
stance and the country's alleged record of terrorist activities.
   American warplanes bombed Tripoli, the Libyan capital, in April
1986 in retaliation. A daughter of Gadhafi died in the air raid.
   Mrs. Oakley gave no indication the United States is contemplating
the use of force or would support others if they tried to disable
the facility. She noted that an international conference would be
held in Paris on Jan. 7 to discuss the proliferation of chemical
weapons technology and that a disarmament conference would take up
the problem in Geneva in February.
   ``We continue to call upon all nations to halt any contribution
they might be making to the Libyan chemical weapons capability, and
to take vigorous actions to curb the illicit use of chemical weapons
and their further proliferation,'' the spokeswoman said.
   The United States, seeking to isolate and weaken Gadhafi, has
barred export of American technology to the North African country.
It has also tried to persuade other nations to deny chemical weapons
equipment to Iraq and Iraq, which were accused by the Reagan
administration of using chemical weapons against each other's forces
in the Persian Gulf war.
   The Washington Post, in a story Monday, quoted unidentified U.S.
and Israeli analysts as fearing Gadhafi ``may be planning to provide
radical Palestinian or Japanese terrorists with the wherewithal to
launch the first chemical attack on Israel or Israeli interests
somewhere in the world.''
   Mrs. Oakley's statement did not deal with specific U.S. concerns.
   But she stressed that ``the United States is very concerned about
the spread of chemical weapons and the capability of spreading
chemical weapons in the Middle East.'' She also registered concern
about a proliferation of ballistic missiles in the region.
   ``The U.S. believes that Libya has established a CW (chemical
weapons) production capability and it's on the verge of full-scale
production of these weapons,'' Mrs. Oakley said.
   She said Japan had given assurances that its nationals were not
working at the Libyan facility and that Tokyo planned no further
involvement with a metallurgical plant that may have been connected
to the chemical weapons program. She said Japan was fulfilling its
pledge.
   After CIA Director William H. Webster charged Libya two months
ago with developing the capability for chemical warfare, Gadhafi
sent a memorandum to the United Nations denying the allegation.

<HEAD>Two Explosions Wreck Immigrant Housing, Kill One, Wound 12</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto CAN2</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   CAGNES-SUR-MER, France (AP) _ Two explosions wrecked a home for
immigrant workers Monday on the French Riviera, killing one resident
and injuring 12, police said. Authorities said they found evidence
that may link the blasts to Jewish extremists.
   They said the first pre-dawn blast demolished a car parked at the
entrance of the building, which housed 97 people, mostly North
African immigrants. Residents were rushing outside when a second
explosion minutes later ripped through a stairwell, killing a
Romanian immigrant.
   The victim was identified as Georghe Yordachescu, 50, a delivery
driver who had lived there about four years.
   Firemen said they found written tracts in the rubble from an
extreme right-wing Jewish group called Masada. The writings
contained the words ``Islam Must Be Beaten.''
   Tracts from Masada, named after a mountaintop fortress in Israel
held by Jews against Roman legions, were found last June outside
another immigrants' residence in nearby Nice when a bomb was
defused, police said.
   However, no explicit claim of responsibility was made by any
organization for Monday's explosions.
   The first blast hurled chunks of the parked car up to 300 feet
away, destroyed four other cars and damaged numerous vehicles. The
concussion broke windows in nearby buildings.
   President Francois Mitterrand condemned the attack, saying:
``Once again, the cowardice of a few struck immigrant workers. This
violence must be denounced and fought with the greatest firmness.''
   Foreign immigrants, especially those from North Africa, have
often been made targets of resentment and prejudice in France.
   An employee of a transportation company next door to the
residence reported, ``We were drinking coffee with a colleague when
the explosion blew out the door and all of the windows. We ran
outside and we saw that terrified residents of the center wanted to
jump from the windows.
   ``We shouted to them to remain in the building and we approached
it to help them. It was at that moment that the second explosion
happened. I was thrown 10 meters (about 33 feet) and my colleague
was hit full in the head by a piece of flying metal.''
   Six of those hurt required hospitalization. Cagnes-sur-Mer is
about six miles west of Nice on the French Riviera.
   The ground floor was badly damaged. Dozens of rooms were
destroyed and enormous pieces of concrete were sent flying.
   Some of those hurt suffered broken bones and cuts. Some had
jumped from the windows.
   Residents regrouped around a fire built in front of the building.
   ``We never received any threats,'' one said. ``Everything was
just fine at the center. We don't understand this attack.''

   A boiler at a copper mine exploded
Monday, killing one man and injuring two others, authorities said.
   The boiler at Magma Copper Co.'s new smelter was being cleaned
when it exploded, said Sandra Gerdon, Magma's assistant industrial
relations officer.
   Ronald Riggs, 47, of San Manuel, a Magma engineer, was killed in
the explosion.
   Eric Walker, 34, an employee of N.B. Harty General Contractors of
Dexter, Mo., was listed in critical condition at Tucson Medical
Center, where he was being treated for burns, said Pinal County
Sheriff's Cpl. Leonard Holcombe.
   The other injured man, Daryl Stepp, was treated at the San Manuel
Health Center and released, Holcombe said. He also worked for the
contracting company.
   San Manuel is about 45 miles northeast of Tucson in southern
Arizona.
   The contracting company was working to dislodge waste buildup
within a boiler at the company's new $150 million furnace complex,
Ms. Gerdon said.
   The federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration is
investigating the explosion.
   Magma completed installation of a $150 million Finnish-built
state-of-the-art flash furnace complex earlier this year, and fired
it up during the summer.
   Bob Savedra, treasurer and smelter safety representative for
Steelworkers Local 937, said a furnace had been shut down for the
last week to clean a buildup of material inside the boiler.

   A reward of nearly $7,000 was announced
Monday in hopes of finding out who is responsible for the deaths of
three cougars that were part of a program to re-establish endangered
Florida panthers.
   U.S. Rep. Bill Grant said that he and state and private game
officials hope to raise more money to get the reward up to $10,000.
   Three of five cougars caught in Texas and released into the
Osceola National Forest in June have died, threatening the
state-federal program aimed at finding a new habitat for Florida
panthers.
   Hunters have been blamed in two of the cougar deaths, while the
cause of the third death could not be determined, said Tom Logan,
chief of wildlife research for the game and fish commission.
   The two remaining cougars are believed to be in good health.
   Fewer than 30 panthers are believed to be remaining in the swamps
and scrubland of central and southern Florida, as their natural
habitat is chipped away by development.
   That is why wildlife authorities are attempting to establish
panthers in the Osceola forest in north-central Florida. They
brought the five cougars, which have habits similar to those of the
endangered panthers, to the forest to see how well they adapt.
   State officials have no firm leads in the deaths but expect the
reward money may help, said Woody Darden, spokesman for the Florida
Game and Fresh Water Fish Commission.
   ``We think at this point, the only real possibility of getting a
conviction is if somebody comes forward,'' said Darden. ``Most of
the time when people do something like this, they're going to talk
about it.''
   Conviction of killing one of the cougars carries a possible
prison sentence of five years and fine of up to $5,000.

<HEAD>Report Says Leftist Guerrilla Group Wants to be Political Party</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM WELLS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One of Colombia's leftist guerrilla
groups wants to abandon armed rebellion and become a political
party, a Bogota newspaper reported on Monday.
   The report in the daily El Siglo follows President Virgilio
Barco's Sept. 1 offer of freedom of political activity to leftist
rebel bands who give up armed revolt.
   El Siglo quoted Sen. Ricardo Villa Salcedo as saying the April 19
Movement, or M-19, has proposed immediate talks with the government
and that the group wants to disband and organize a party within six
months.
   ``The conditions are right for achieving an agreement between the
government and the M-19 in the next three months,'' Villa Salcedo
was quoted as saying.
   The Associated Press tried to call Villa Salcedo at his office,
but there was no answer. Parliament adjourned last week.
   In the last two months, El Siglo has been the medium for several
announcements by leftist guerrilla groups proposing peace talks with
the government.
   Earlier this year, M-19 kidnapped Alvaro Gomez Hurtado,
Colombia's leading member of the Conservative Party and owner of El
Siglo, who ran against Barco for president two years ago.
   He was released after two weeks with a message from M-19 that it
was interested in peace talks with the government.
   Last week, Barco told the final session of Parliament that
members of his Cabinet have been in direct contact with M-19.
   M-19 made its proposal during such contacts this month, El Siglo
quoted Villa Salcedo as saying.
   The senator and Barco both belong to the governing Liberal Party.
   Right-wing death squads have ravaged the ranks of a political
party that was organized three years ago with the help of rebels
from the Colombian Revolutionary Armed Forces. The squads killed 800
members of that party, the Patriotic Union, including its president,
Jaime Pardo Leal.
   The Colombian Revolutionary Armed Forces made known last month
through another federal senator that it, too, would like to enter
into peace talks with the government.
   Two other rebel groups, the People's Liberation Army and the
National Liberation Army, said in communiques they will never give
up trying to overthrow the government.
   Those two groups launched a major offensive last January.
   There are an estimated 10,000 leftist guerrillas in Colombia.
   M-19 has been inactive for the last six months. It takes its name
from the date of a 1970 presidential election that dissidents say
was fraudulent.
   M-19's bloodiest operation was seizing the Supreme Court building
in Bogota in 1985. The army retook the building, but 11 Supreme
Court justices and 85 other people were killed.

   A high school mathematics teacher
who repeatedly defied a new dress code requiring him to wear a tie
was fired Monday night.
   The Mason County Board of Education voted to fire teacher Bill
Webb for insubordination, accepting a recommendation of school
Superintendent Charles Chambers.
   Earlier, the board had delayed action on Chambers' recommendation
pending a closed-door session last week.
   ``First of all, we'll file the necessary papers for appeal,''
Webb said Monday night. ``I have work I have contracted to do in my
body shop, and probably after the first of the year, I will go hunt
a job.''
   The 46-year-old teacher, who lives in Gallipolis, Ohio, and owns
a farm and a body shop there, had said he expected to be fired. He
had already been suspended three times for not wearing a tie, and
the dipute engendered considerable controversy in Mason County.
   ``I felt all along that the board would back the superintendent
on his recommendation,'' he said.
   In August, Chambers issued a memo saying male teachers would have
to wear ties to work and that all teachers were prohibited from
wearing denim.
   Webb was suspended for four days with pay in September when he
refused to wear a tie after Principal Michael Whalen and Chambers
asked him to do so. In October, he was suspended for 11 days without
pay, and on Halloweeen the board suspended him indefinitely without
pay.
   A state hearing examiner has heard evidence on the second
suspension and a decision is expected by Jan. 5.

<HEAD>Rish Sentenced To Life For Kidnap, Murder Of Businessman Stephen
Small</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KANKAKEE, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman described by prosecutors as a
gold-digger who helped bury businessman Stephen Small alive in hopes
of sharing a $1 million ransom was sentenced Monday to life in
prison without parole.
   Nancy Rish was convicted Nov. 2 of murder and kidnapping for her
role in the 1987 abduction of Small, member of a prominent
publishing family, who suffocated in a homemade wooden box before
the money could be collected.
   Ms. Rish, 26, cried and hugged her mother when Circuit Judge John
Michela pronounced the sentence after a hearing in Kankakee County
Circuit Court.
   Her boyfriend, Daniel Edwards, was convicted of murder and
kidnapping in May and sentenced to die, but prosecutors said Ms.
Rish was not eligible for the death penalty.
   ``There was not one grain of remorse, not one grain of salt in
the tears of this woman for Stephen Small and his family,''
prosecutor Michael Ficaro, an assistant Illinois attorney general,
told the judge.
   Ms. Rish told Michela that witnesses against her lied and her
conviction was unfair. ``I just want to say I'm not guilty of those
charges and I never was,'' she said.
   Small, 40, was kidnapped Sept. 2, 1987 and buried in the box in a
remote area between Kankakee and the Indiana border. His body was
unearthed two days later.
   Small's late father was head of Mid-America Media Group, whose
broadcasting properties included 11 radio stations, and his uncle
was head of Small Newspapers Inc., and editor and publisher of the
Kankakee Daily Journal.
   Ficaro contended that Edwards and Ms. Rish wanted a lot of money,
``the big score,'' and decided kidnapping Small was the way to get
it. However, the defense maintained that Edwards' real accomplices
never were apprehended.
   During the trial, the jury saw photos of Small's body inside the
box, and heard chilling tapes of a kidnapper warning that Small
would die if the ransom was not paid. The ransom was never paid
because Small's wife could not understand the delivery instructions
on the muffled tape recording played to her over the telephone.

<HEAD>U.N. Chief Asks for 70 Peacekeepers to Oversee Cuban Withdrawal
from Angola</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar
on Monday asked the Security Council to approve a 70-member
peacekeeping force to monitor the withdrawal of 50,000 Cuban troops
from Angola.
   The council is expected to give its approval by Thursday for the
U.N. Angola Verification Mission, which a report by the
secretary-general said would cost about $20.4 million during the
31-month phased pullout.
   Cuba and Angola are expected to sign on Thursday a final pact to
cooperate with the force and a final agreement with South Africa on
the southern Africa peace plan.
   Under the plan, South Africa is to allow independence to
South-West Africa, the former German colony known as Namibia; Cuban
troops are to withdraw from Angola, and South African troops from
Angola and Namibia. South Africa has controlled Namibia in defiance
of a 1966 U.N. resolution demanding the territory's independence.
   The 70-member U.N. force Perez de Cuellar asked for is separate
and officially unrelated to a much larger force of 7,500
peacekeepers and 2,000 military police and civilian administrators
planned to monitor Namibian independence.
   Perez de Cuellar's report did not suggest which nations would
provide military observers for the unarmed force.
   But Foreign Minister Francisco Fernandez Ordonez of Spain was
quoted by a Madrid newspaper as saying his country has agreed to
send troops to Angola and Namibia.
   U.S. spy satellites are expected to provide much of the
intelligence data that South Africa insists on during the Cuban
withdrawal.
   Angola's state news agency quoted President Jose Eduardo dos
Santos as saying that Perez de Cuellar is trying to create a fund to
finance the Cuban withdrawal.
   In a meeting in Havana with Cuban leader Fidel Castro, dos Santos
said it would cost about $800 million, the agency said.
   Cuban troops went to Angola in 1975 to help the Marxist
government fight attacks by South African forces and U.S.-backed
rebels of the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola.
   In a statement issued from their Lisbon headquarters Monday, the
rebels claimed they killed 13 Angolan soldiers and captured the
northwestern Angola town of Ucua, in Luanda province, last week.
   The rebels said they killed eight government soldiers Thursday
when they attacked a military column in the southern Huila province
and destroyed 12 tons of arms.
   One rebel died and seven were injured in the clashes, they said.
   There was no way to immediately verify claims of the rebels, who
are not party to the U.S.-sponsored peace agreement.

   Seven Democrats and 11 Republicans are now seeking
the mayor's office in Chicago, but the rumored candidacy of former
Mayor Jane Byrne did not materialize before the Monday deadline for
filing nomination petitions.
   Mrs. Byrne, a Democrat who was the city's mayor from 1979 to
1983, had been reported in recent days to be a potential Republican
candidate. But her daughter, Kathy, showed up at the Board of
Election Commissioners minutes before the deadline Monday with a
denial.
   ``Jane Byrne is not a candidate. Merry Christmas,'' Kathy Byrne
told reporters, then departed.
   Edward Vrdolyak, a former Democratic powerhouse turned Republican
who was also said to be thinking about running, sent an aide to tell
reporters minutes before the filing deadline that he, too, wasn't
interested.
   ``Leaders in the Republican Party urged me to consider a
candidacy and I did so as a courtesy to my party,'' Vrdolyak said in
a statement. ``Instead, I will concentrate my time and energy on my
law practice and on assisting to build the Republican Party in
Chicago and Cook County.''
   That left the Republicans without a big-name candidate for the
Feb. 28 primary.
   On the Democratic side, Mayor Eugene Sawyer, named to the post by
the city council after Harold Washington died in November 1987,
squared off against a field that included Cook County State's
Attorney Richard M. Daley, son of the legendary Mayor Richard J.
Daley, and Alderman Timothy Evans.
   Though the deadline for primary candidates ended Monday,
independent candidates have until mid-January to file for the
remaining two years in Washington's second term.
   Other Democratic candidates are aldermen Lawrence Bloom and Juan
Soliz; former state Sen. James Taylor; and Sheila A. Jones, a
follower of political extremist Lyndon LaRouche.
   Republican candidates include Herbert Sohn, a physician-lawyer
who ran unsuccessfully three times against veteran U.S. Rep. Sidney
Yates; Kenneth R. Hurst, who filed an unsuccessful lawsuit to try to
get the election put off until 1989; and John J. Holowinski, a
former Democrat employed by the city's Department of Economic
Development.
   Winning the Democratic primary has been tantamount to winning the
general election in Chicago's recent history, although a white
Republican made a strong showing against Washington, the city's
first black mayor.
   Mrs. Byrne was derailed in a 1983 re-election bid when she and
Daley split the white vote, making Washington the Democratic
candidate. He went on to win the general election and become the
city's first black mayor.
   The racial issue remains alive in the 1988 campaign. Sawyer and
Evans, who are black, are battling to represent the black community,
although Daley has begun campaigning hard for the black vote. Evans
has criticized Sawyer and said he is Washington's true political
heir.
   The city's population is a little more than 40 percent white, 40
percent black, 15 percent Hispanic and less than 5 percent of other
races.

   The State Department, which last week opened
talks with the Palestine Liberation Organization, said Monday it
would judge PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat's renunciation of terrorism
on a ``case-by-case'' basis.
   ``Terrorism has been renounced in words,'' spokeswoman Phyllis
Oakley said. ``We shall see what happens now.''
   Mrs. Oakley declined to comment directly on an assertion by Salah
Khalaf of the PLO that Arafat's renunciation of terrorism ``in all
forms'' did not include military attacks against Israel.
   ``Our struggle will continue until we raise the PLO flag over
Jerusalem,'' Khalaf, known also as Abu Iyad, said Sunday. He is
second-in-command to Arafat in Fatah, the mainstream body of the PLO.
   A member of the PLO executive committee, Mustafa el-Zibri, said
in a statement Monday that Arafat's statements explicitly
recognizing Israel's right to exist and renouncing all forms of
terrorism were ``incompatible with the resolutions of the latest
Palestine National Council meeting,'' and they were just Arafat's
``personal opinion.''
   Zibri's statement could represent a serious policy split within
the ranks of the 15-member governing body of the Palestine
Liberation Organization, which includes representatives of six
Palestinian guerrilla groups as well as independents.
   Meanwhile, President-elect Bush said Monday in a brief exchange
with reporters that ``we would not start off by showing any
tolerance of PLO terror and I don't care if it comes from a faction
of the left or right or the center or whatever. ... I am concerned
about it; I have been and will continue to be concerned about it.''
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater declined comment on
Khalaf's remarks, saying, ``I don't need to tell you of the
commotion that this development has made in Middle Eastern affairs,
and we just aren't going to prejudice the process in any way at this
point.''
   Arafat's renunciation of terrorism at a news conference Wednesday
in Geneva was one of the reasons cited by Secretary of State George
P. Shultz for deciding to hold U.S. talks with the PLO.
   This reversed a 13-year ban and dismayed Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir and other Israeli officials as a regrettable move that would
not advance prospects for peace in the area.
   The first U.S. session with the PLO was held Friday in Carthage,
an ancient city near Tunis founded by the Phoenicians. Mrs. Oakley
said ``we have no further meetings planned at this point.''
   On Saturday, Assistant Secretary of State Richard W. Murphy said
the ``dialogue'' with the PLO would be suspended in the event of
terrorism incidents that were traceable to the group.
   ``We would look at all this on a case-by-case basis,'' Mrs.
Oakley said. ``And I am not going to get into the area of
speculation about what specific views we might have.''
   At the same time, she said the Reagan administration was ``deeply
concerned'' about an upsurge of violence on the Israeli-held West
Bank. Troops killed three Palestinian Arabs on Sunday, raising to
eight the death toll over a bloody weekend. Authorities said Arabs
stoned three Jewish residents, including a 9-month-old girl and
4-year-old boy.
   Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin said the U.S. move toward
the PLO had ``given legitimization to the uprising in the
territories.''
   Mrs. Oakley said there was no way to determine if the increased
violence was linked to the U.S. decision to meet with the PLO, which
Israel contends is behind the attacks on Israeli troops and settlers.
   However, the U.S. official admonished Israel not to engage in
``excessive use of force'' on the West Bank and in Gaza.
   Zibri's statement, issued from Damascus, Syria, said Arafat's
statements in Geneva ``expressed only his personal opinion.'' He
signed the statement with his guerrilla name, Abu Ali Mustafa.
   ``His statements only whetted the U.S. appetite to extort
(concessions from) the Palestinian revolution and the PLO,'' Zibri
said. ``We shall continue to exercise our legitimate rights ... in
struggling against the occupation with all means available,
including armed struggle, until ... establishment of the independent
Palestinian state on soil of the homeland.''
   Zibri is the sole representative on the executive committee from
the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, a Marxist group
headed by George Habash. It was not known immediately whether Habash
endorsed his statement.
   State Department spokeswoman Nancy Beck declined comment Monday
night on Zibri's statement.

   An accountant for a carpet-cleaning company
that bilked investors out of millions of dollars was convicted
Monday after jurors determined he accepted a bribe from company
founder Barry Minkow.
   Norman Rothberg, 52, was convicted of one count of conspiracy _
taking a bribe to cover up ZZZZ Best's frauds _ and four counts of
mail fraud.
   The 22-year-old Minkow, who was 16 when he created the ZZZZ Best
carpet cleaning company in his parents' garage, was convicted by the
same jury last week of 57 counts of fraud.
   Ten other defendants pleaded guilty to various charges.
   Jurors deliberated heard four months of testimony about the $25
million swindle that snared Wall Street brokerages, major banks and
small investors. Before his downfall, Minkow gained wide publicity
as an apparent boy genius in business.
   Convicting young Minkow ``wasn't something that was easy,'' said
jury foreman Mel Tiedemann, 32, after the trial ended. ``I had to
separate my emotions from my decision.''
   He noted that Minkow was ``just a kid'' and said, ``I wanted to
let him go. But I felt in my bones the guy was guilty.''
   The Securities and Exchange Commission, a federal grand jury and
the Police Department remained involved Monday in investigations
centered on the Minkow case.
   Last year, Police Chief Daryl Gates described ZZZZ Best as one of
several local companies linked to money laundering and drug
trafficking by East Coast crime families.
   Police Department spokesman Cmdr. William Booth said the
17-month-old statements are ``still valid and the investigation is
continuing.''
   Federal prosecutors say their work on the case now involves the
more complex securities fraud side, exploring such issues as whether
insider information was illegally used to profit from trading in
ZZZZ Best stock.
   During the trial, Minkow claimed that he was exploited by
mobsters who infiltrated his business.
   Sentencing for Minkow was set for February, and sentencing for
Rothberg was set for March.
   Prosecutors said Rothberg told a friend at the Ernst and Whinney
accounting firm that something was amiss at ZZZZ Best. Later, he
accepted $25,000 from Minkow to retract that statement, prosecutors
said.

   The head of a polygamist clan ``declared
war'' on the outside world when he began the confrontation that
ended in the death of a law officer, a prosecutor said Monday as the
case went to the jury.
   A jury retired for the evening after starting deliberations in
the trial of three clan members charged with second-degree murder in
the death of Utah Corrections Lt. Fred House, killed Jan. 28 during
a shootout that climaxed a 13-day standoff.
   In closing arguments, prosecutor Creighton Horton told state
district court jurors that clan patriarch Addam Swapp, 27; his
brother, Jonathan Swapp, 21; and brother-in-law, John Timothy
Singer, 22, deliberately chose a course of confrontation that led to
bloodshed.
   House was killed and Addam Swapp seriously wounded when the
shootout ended the police standoff at the clan's Marion farm. The
standoff began Jan. 16, when Addam Swapp bombed a Mormon chapel.
   Addam Swapp ``basically declared war on the church, state and
nation'' when he bombed the chapel, Horton said. Swapp contended he
was divinely inspired to commit the bombing, but Horton dismissed
the clan leader's claims.
   ``God didn't place those weapons in their hands. He didn't place
them around the house, he didn't load them, he didn't take the
safeties off, he didn't put his finger on the trigger and he didn't
fire,'' Horton said.
   Addam Swapp's attorney, John Bucher, countered that just because
clan members were well-armed did not mean they intended to use their
weapons.
   Singer has acknowleged firing the fatal bullet from his bedroom
window, but he maintains he was firing at the police dogs that House
was directing, not at the officer himself.
   Bill Morrison, Swapp's other lawyer, said his client has a
``deeply held religious belief in the sanctity of human life'' and
cried, ``Oh, Tim, why did you do it?'' after singer fired the shot.
   But prosecutor Dave Schwendiman said Singer and the Swapp
brothers had willfully and knowingly prolonged the confrontation and
could have accepted a peaceful compromise at any time during the
siege.
   The confrontation at the farm began after Singer and the Swapp
brothers bombed a nearby Mormon chapel on Jan. 16, the ninth
anniversary of the death of Singer's father, John Singer.
   John Singer's widow, Vickie, says her husband's death was the
result of a conspiracy between state authorities and church
officials angry at his open practice of polygamy and refusal to send
his children to public schools. The Mormon church officially
abandoned polygamy in 1890.

<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A law allowing political parties will be
adopted before parliamentary elections in 1990, but until then no
new parties will be permitted in Hungary, a junior minister said
Monday.
   Geza Kilenyi, the deputy justice minister, told reporters an
11-member constitutional court will be set up next year and will be
the only state organ competent to rule whether a political party is
constitutional or not.
   Parliament begins a winter session Tuesday that reportedly could
extend beyond the Christmas holidays _ extremely unusual in a
communist country.
   Hungary's parliament has grown increasingly lively this year,
with many deputies questioning the legislature's traditional
rubber-stamp role.
   Government spokesman Gyoergy Marosan said parliament's 15-point
agenda includes the 1989 budget and long-awaited laws on assembly
and association that will recognize, in principle, the right of
citizens to form political parties.
   Kilenyi said the law may not be considered until January because
of the large agenda.
   It is part of the government's ``package plan for democracy,''
including laws for a new constitution, presented to parliament last
month by Minister of State Imre Pozsgay, a leading reformer.
   The law on associations was ``a step forward,'' Kilenyi said,
that is needed to clear up ``legal uncertainties'' plaguing the
government and dozens of independent interest groups, associations
and trade unions that have mushroomed this year.
   Although these groups are legal, as their establishment does not
run counter to the constitution, there are no laws defining how an
organization can be established, what body is empowered to register
it or who is to exercise control over its operation, he said.
   A separate law would regulate the actual establishment,
registration and legal control of political parties.
   Referring to objections expressed by independent groups who feel
the associations laws should also apply to parties, Kilenyi
explained the party law would be directly linked to the new
constitution, likely to be adopted in 1990.
   The new constitution will not be committed to either a single or
multiparty system but also will not declare ``the leading role of
any party,'' Kilenyi said, referring to the traditional role of the
governing Communist Party.
   Still, it would leave no doubt that Hungary is a ``socialist
society,'' he said.
   A first draft of the party law is to be completed by Feb. 15,
Kilenyi said, but it would not be passed before the new constitution
is adopted. That is expected only by mid-1990, when elections are
scheduled.
   Among the communist states, Hungary always has been comparatively
tolerant of cultural freedoms and small enterprise.

   A school cafeteria's ceiling partially
collapsed Monday as pupils were eating lunch, and 32 were injured by
falling debris, authorities said.
   ``I heard it and looked up and then I saw it was cracked,'' said
13-year-old Carmell Suduth. She said she began running after hearing
a cracking sound and smelling dust.
   ``Something told me not to turn back,'' she said.
   None of the approximately 190 eighth-graders at West Middle
School was believed seriously hurt although several were treated at
hospitals and three were admitted.
   Officials at the school said material from one corner of the
ceiling came tumbling down. Students were struck by falling plaster
and a light fixture. The cafeteria is in the older section of the
70-year-old building.
   The school was evacuated and structural experts were called to
make sure the rest of the building was safe.
   Superintendent of Schools Thomas Brown said classes were called
off for the afternoon, and there would be no classes Tuesday. There
was no indication on what caused the collapse.
   Steve Molden said he shielded another student and took a blow
instead when he saw a chunk of plaster coming down.
   ``I was real shocked,'' he said. ``I saw a piece was going to hit
a girl who had already fallen down. I dove to prevent the piece from
hitting her and it hit me.''
   One student was listed in guarded condition and another in good
condition at St. Luke's Regional Medical Center. A spokesman for
Marian Health Center said another student was being kept there for
observation, but had not been formally admitted. The 29 other
injured students were treated at the two hospitals and released.

   President-elect Bush chose Jack Kemp on Monday
to be his secretary of housing and urban development, calling the
quarterback-turned-politician the ``idea man'' to lead a Republican
war on poverty.
   Rep. Kemp, the former pro football star whose advocacy of
``supply side'' tax cuts helped shape President Reagan's economic
policies, promised to be outspoken on urban issues as part of the
Bush administration.
   ``I plan to be audacious in my approach to these inner-city
problems of poverty and homelessness and joblessness,'' said Kemp,
the New York congressman who unsuccessfully fought Bush for the
Republican presidential nomination earlier this year.
   Bush called his former rival ``one of the premier architects of
the opportunity society that we are trying to create.''
   Bush, who has now named eight of his 14 Cabinet officers, was
ready to add to the list on Tuesday. Congressional sources,
commenting on condition they not be named, said the president-elect
would announce Samuel Skinner, a Chicago mass transit official, as
his transportation secretary.
   The sources also said Bush was likely to name the first black
member of his Cabinet on Tuesday.
   That could be Louis Sullivan, a medical educator from Atlanta who
has been the front-runner for secretary of health and human
services. A congressional source said Bush was also near an
announcement on another black, Julius W. Becton Jr., to be secretary
of veterans affairs, a new Cabinet post.
   Becton is a retired three-star Army general who now heads the
Federal Emergency Management Agency.
   Transition sources said there appeared to be ``a snag'' with the
Sullivan nomination that developed after quotations from him that
appeared in Sunday editions of The Atlanta Constitution suggested he
had pro-choice views on abortion. Earlier, transition officials had
said Sullivan had assured Bush during their meeting last week that
he shared the president-elect's anti-abortion views. Officials said
the remarks reported on Sunday were being looked into, but they
didn't know if the statements would disqualify Sullivan from the job.
   Around the country, meanwhile, 538 members of the Electoral
College, including Bush's brother Prescott in Connecticut and his
son Neil in Colorado, were casting the votes Monday confirming
Bush's Nov. 8 election victory.
   Bush, asked if he thought he would win, replied simply, with a
straight face, ``Yes.''
   His selection of Kemp won quick praise from outside as well as
inside the GOP.
   ``I believe he will be aggressive about supporting the housing
agenda. He's not the kind of person who would accept the mission and
then try and destroy it,'' said New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, a
Democrat.
   Alan Beals, executive director of the National League of Cities,
called Kemp ``an energetic activist'' who has ``showed a readiness
to press aggressively for new approaches.''
   Action is needed after two Reagan terms, Bush was told in a
meeting later with city, county and state officials.
   ``It's commonly known that housing programs have been cut up to
80 percent over the last eight years,'' Trenton, N.J., Mayor Arthur
Holland said after the meeting.
   ``That's the reason ... that you'll see whole families as in our
city showing up in shelters and soup lines. So that's got to be
addressed.''
   He said Bush ``was listening and receiving everything we said
well and really wants to help.''
   Kemp, who has long advocated creation of urban enterprise zones
to spur investment in inner cities and has proposed the sale of
public housing units to tenants, should give the HUD job new
visibility.
   The current HUD secretary, Samuel Pierce, who has held the job
since the beginning of the Reagan administration, worked quietly on
Reagan proposals to scale back housing programs.
   Meanwhile, congressional officials said transition aides were
searching for candidates for the Interior Department beyond the four
names backed by Western Republican lawmakers. One source, speaking
on condition of anonymity, said former Louisiana Gov. David Treen
had been mentioned.
   Western Republicans signaled Bush several days ago they could
support any of four contenders: Rep. Barbara Vucanovich of Nevada,
Richard Richards of Utah, former House Republican Leader John Rhodes
of Arizona and Wyoming oil and gas executive Warren Morton.
   Bush also met Monday with Lane Kirkland, president of the
AFL-CIO. Bush still must fill the posts of labor secretary, energy
secretary,interior secretary, and secretary of veterans affairs.
   Asked about energy secretary, Bush said he was leaning toward a
candidate with experience in the nuclear energy field ``because of
some of the problems we've been reading about'' concerning
deteriorating nuclear plants and because of the ``needs to diversify
our own energy base.''
   He did not elaborate.
   Kemp, 53, told reporters he would not speak out publicly on
foreign affairs, but expected to have a voice in the Cabinet on
domestic economic issues beyond housing.
   ``I'm going to be a good team player,'' vowed Kemp, who did not
seek re-election to the Buffalo, N.Y., district he has represented
for 18 years.
   About a future presidential run, Kemp said: ``I haven't ruled out
seeking office some day, nor have I ruled it in.''
   Kemp's appointment cheered conservatives, who had seen few of
their numbers win spots in the emerging Bush presidency.
   Kemp, who during the winter primaries depicted Bush as a member
of the establishment too wedded to government to resist raising
taxes, said Monday he took Bush at his word of not supporting a tax
increase.
   ``I did read his lips,'' he said.
   Kemp is an original sponsor of the 1981 legislation that resulted
in the tax cut embraced by President Reagan _ a role for which Bush
hailed him on Monday.
   ``Jack Kemp is an idea man and I'm now asking him to apply his
vision of opportunity to America's housing and urban development
needs,'' Bush said.
   Kemp said he was ``thrilled'' with the appointment to what in the
past has been viewed as a second-string Cabinet post, and said he
would seek a public-private partnership to ``wage war on poverty.''
   Answering questions on other topics, Bush said he would take an
intolerant view of any acts of terrorism by the Palestine Liberation
Organization, which has renounced such acts as the price for
diplomatic discussions with the Reagan administration.
   He also said he would support new initiatives on easing Third
World debt, although he voiced skepticism about any plan under which
banks would be asked to forgive loans.
   Later, in an afternoon talk to people working on his
inauguration, he said that ``as we approach Christmas, I think it is
important to note that there is peace on earth, certainly between
the major powers.''
   Pointing to the meeting he and Reagan had with Soviet President
Mikhail Gorbachev, he said, ``I am not euphorically optimistic about
that (U.S.-Soviet) relationship, but I see enormous opportunity.''
   The vice president donated a bright red bat and Mrs. Bush a
stuffed bear to the workers' ``Toys for Tots'' drive.

   PLO chairman Yasser Arafat hopes to be able one day
to turn to President-elect George Bush and call him ``brother
president,'' the Italian daily La Stampa quoted him as saying in an
interview released Monday.
   La Stampa correspondent Igor Mann said the Palestine Liberation
Organization leader told him recently in Tunis that ``in politics
one can believe only in onself and not much else.''
   But according to the interview, to be published in Tuesday's
editions, Arafat seemed to hold out hope for dealings with the Bush
administration.
   ``I say that President Bush is a professional, a WASP who has
behind him a nation born from an anti-colonial intefadeh,'' it
quoted him as saying, in an allusion to the Palestinian uprising in
the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   The United States last week reversed a 13-year ban on official
contacts with the PLO after Arafat renounced terrorism and accepted
Israel's right to exist. A meeting between PLO executive committee
member Yasser Abd Rabbo and U.S. Ambassador Robert Pelletreau took
place Friday in the Tunisian capital.
   U.S. officials have indicated the talks will not continue until
after Bush takes office on Jan. 20.
   ``I do not hold excessive illusions, the future is still to be
built,'' Arafat was quoted as saying. ``But I am confident in the
good sense of the American people, the famous common sense of Tom
Paine. I wish one day to be able to turn to Bush and call him
`brother president.'''

<HEAD>Amnesty International Seeks Release of Malaysian Prisoners</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Amnesty International on Tuesday called on
Malaysian authorities to release 16 people held without trial since
mass arrests a year ago under security regulations.
   Malaysian laws are ``seriously inadequate'' to safeguard against
arbitrary arrest, detention without trial, torture or other
degrading treatment, said the 32-page report on conditions under
Malaysia's Internal Security Act.
   The London-based human rights organization focused on the arrest
and detention of 106 people in October and November 1987, and the
government's claim they had threatened national security.
   Four former detainees provided testimony, Amnesty said, of
torture or other forms of ill-treatment, reporting that
interrogators forced some detainees to strip naked, crawl on the
floor, or stand in front of over-cooled air-conditioning ducts while
they were subjected to humiliating verbal abuse.
   Others were beaten, deprived of sleep, pulled by the hair and
subjected to mock sexual assaults, the organization said.
   The detainees included prominent politicians, trade unionists,
religious and community workers and environmentalists, it said.
   They were held without charge or access to lawyers and in
solitary confinement for 60 days, after which at least 40 were
served two-year detention orders, said Amnesty.
   It said the government alleged in March that the detainees had
exploited sensitive issues and threatened the stability and welfare
of the people, but that government officials acknowledged during
October meetings with its representatives that the 40 detainees had
not used or advocated violence.
   All but 16 were released during 1988. Amnesty said it considers
the 16 prisoners of conscience.
   The Internal Security Act empowers authorities to order
preventive detention without trial for activities deemed extremely
and imminently dangerous to the state and the public, while failing
to give clear criteria for identifying such activities, Amnesty said.
   It said the authorities had failed to distinguish between violent
activities that threaten national security and non-violent
activities that do not involve such a threat.
   The organization added that the courts uphold detention orders
solely on the basis of officials' assertions that they have such
grounds.
   Amnesty listed what it called pressing reasons for review of the
security act to ensure fundamental civil liberties granted by the
Malaysian constitution.
   It also urged the government to take immediate steps to prevent
torture and ill-treatment.

<HEAD>Lawsuit Alleges Neglect by Police Who Waited Outside As Girl Was
Raped</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman whose 12-year-old daughter was raped in
her home as police waited outside for nearly half an hour filed a
lawsuit Monday against the officers and the cities that employ them,
a lawyer said.
   The lawsuit, which also names the man charged in the attack,
claims that the officials were ``intentional and reckless and
callously indifferent to the rights of the family'' when they did
not act to save the girl and her brother from attack, said Edward T.
Stein, an attorney for the family.
   On Dec. 20, 1987, police waited outside the family's Calumet City
apartment before rescuing the girl, even though her mother had
escaped and was begging police to go inside, the lawsuit states.
   The woman's 10-year-old son was also inside, and was ``slapped
around'' by the intruder, who repeatedly raped the girl, Stein said.
The civil lawsuit asks for an unspecified amount in damages, naming
only the minimum amount of $15,000, he said.
   Named as defendants are the suburb of Calumet City, former city
policeman James Horka, who was fired over the incident; and
patrolmen Daniel Surufka and Kevin Beasley, who each served
suspensions. Also named are the village of Burnham and a village
officer who was at the scene, Gregory Giglio.
   Horka said later he was waiting for the landlord to arrive with a
key, rather than kicking down the door, because he feared that the
girl would be in worse danger if police forced their way in during
the attack.
   Thomas Bobak, attorney for Calumet City, said he had not seen the
lawsuit, but said the city will ``defend the appropriate parties in
due course.''
   The current and former police officers had unlisted telephone
numbers and could not be reached. Burnham Police Chief J.D. Crull
said he and Giglio could not comment on the pending litigation.
   Ben Valentine, the man accused in the attack, is scheduled to go
to trial Feb. 17.

   Leftist guerrillas proposed a
Christmas season truce Monday in the civil war they have fought for
nine years against the U.S.-backed government.
   The head of the joint chiefs of staff, Emilio Ponce, told
reporters the armed forces did not favor a cease-fire but would
abide by the civilian government's decision.
   President Jose Napoleon Duarte's administration made no immediate
response to the rebels' proposal for a cease-fire beginning Friday
and ending Jan. 2.
   In 1985, the civilian government said it would consider a truce,
but the armed forces high command rejected it and fighting continued
through the holidays. There was no Christmas truce last year or in
1986.
   In a broadcast Monday on clandestine Radio Venceremos, the rebels
called on El Salvador's armed forces to suspend all land, sea and
air operations and to restrict to barracks those troops not on
leave. The rebels also offered to cease their offensive action.
   They said if the armed forces agrees to a truce, delegations from
both sides should meet Wednesday or Thursday to work out details. If
the armed forces does not reply by Wednesday night or rejects the
overture, the rebels will continue fighting, the broadcast said.
   In November, the guerrillas declared a weeklong unilateral
cease-fire for the meeting of the General Assembly of the
Organization of American States in El Salvador.
   El Salvador's civil war has killed an estimated 65,000 people.

   A federal judge on Monday denied U.S.
District Judge Walter Nixon Jr. a new trial on a 1986 perjury
conviction.
   Nixon is the second federal judge ever to be convicted of a crime
while on the bench. He began serving a five-year prison term earlier
this year at Eglin Air Force Base near Pensacola, Fla.
   Nixon, who was based in Biloxi, Miss., was convicted of
committing perjury when he testified he never discussed a pending
drug case with a district attorney.
   At a hearing in September on Nixon's motion for a new trial, a
prosecution witness, Wiley Fairchild, testified that he had lied
during Nixon's trial.
   U.S. District Judge John Nangle said Monday that he had issued an
opinion denying the request for a new trial, but declined to give
details because the participants in the case had not received copies
of the ruling.
   In January, a U.S. House subcommittee is scheduled to continue
impeachment hearings on Nixon. Unless he is impeached, Nixon will
continue to receive his $89,500 annual federal judicial salary.

<TEXT>
   Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi put aside the
affairs of state for some sightseeing Tuesday, a day after talks
with Chinese leaders on a border dispute and other issues that have
divided the world's two most populous nations.
   No breakthroughs were reported on the border issue, which led to
war in 1962.
   Gandhi also discussed Tibet, trade and the Cambodian conflict in
the Monday talks which his official spokesman described as ``warm,
cordial and very friendly.'' He spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Chinese Premier Li Peng and Gandhi met most of Monday following
Gandhi's arrival from New Delhi for a five-day visit to Beijing,
Xian and Shanghai. Gandhi and his wife, Sonia, were later treated to
a state banquet at which Li acted as host.
   Gandhi's grandfather, Jawaharlal Nehru, was the last Indian
leader to travel to China, going to Beijing in 1954. Chinese and
Indian leaders last met in 1960, when then-Premier Chou En-lai went
to New Delhi.
   On Tuesday, Gandhi toured the Temple of Heaven, a 15th century
structure where China's emperors once prayed for good harvests and
performed sacrificial rituals.
   In the afternoon, he was to travel 40 miles northwest of Beijing,
the capital, to the Badaling section of the Great Wall. The
3,720-mile-long barrier was built over 2,000 years to keep out
invaders from the north.
   Gandhi's only scheduled meeting Tuesday was with 81-year-old
President Yang Shangkun, a former senior army leader who took over
the largely ceremonial state post last April.
   On Wednesday, Gandhi is to meet 84-year-old senior leader Deng
Xiaoping and Communist Party General Secretary Zhao Ziyang.
   China and India are expected to sign agreements on civil
aviation, border trade and science and technology. Consular offices
in Shanghai and Bombay may also be established.
   In comments throughout Monday, Gandhi and Li said Chinese-Indian
relations should follow a two-track policy of solving the border
dispute and improving other areas of their relationship.
   ``It is now time to look beyond the past,'' Gandhi said at the
banquet. ``It is now time to look forward to the future. It is now
time to restore the relationship between our two countries.''
   The pronouncements appeared to signal a change in Indian policy,
bringing it more in line with that of the Chinese. India said in the
past it would improve Indian-Chinese ties only after progress was
made on the border.
   Western diplomats said last week that Gandhi's political worries
and India's external problems could have sparked the change.
   China is improving its relations with the Soviet Union and
maintains strong relations with Pakistan, India's traditional enemy
on its northeastern border.
   China's strong international position may have convinced New
Delhi to adopt a more conciliatory attitude to Beijing, the
diplomats said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   At home, Gandhi faces an election year next year in which victory
is by no means assured.
   Li also praised India's position on the restive region of Tibet,
which India recognizes as part of China.
   The Indian spokesman also said Gandhi and Li discussed Cambodia,
but he refused to elaborate. India recognizes the current government
of Cambodia, which was installed by Vietnam after the Hanoi
government invaded the country in December 1978. China supports
Cambodian resistance groups.
   India was one of the first non-socialist countries to recognize
Communist China soon after Beijing's 1949 revolution. In the early
1960s, relations deteriorated over the border question and political
disagreements. The border remains heavily guarded despite eight
rounds of Indian-Chinese talks on the question since 1981, the last
of which took place in November 1987.
   India says China should return 15,200 square miles of territory
it took in the 1962 war.

   Two residents of a hotel who were
unaccounted for after fire swept through the building contacted
police Monday and said they were not home when the blaze broke out.
   Fire swept through the Morningside Hotel on Sunday, killing one
person and seriously injuring two others. Officials at first
expressed fears that the death toll would be higher, but gradually
the number of unaccounted-for residents dropped.
   The 105-room, four-story hotel, built in 1924, provided cheap
housing for transients and some long-term residents, many of whom
depend on Social Security or other limited income, authorities said.
   Fire Chief Luther Taylor said the fire was apparently started by
a discarded match in a third-floor apartment.
   Dawn Moore and her 2-year-old son, Matthew, were among the 120
residents forced out of the building Sunday.
   ``I lost everything _ dishes, clothes, a TV,'' she said. ``I
don't think we'll have much of a Christmas now. We'll manage the
best we can.''
   On Christmas morning last year, fire forced Ms. Moore and her son
out of an apartment on the city's west side. ``This being my second
fire, I was terrified,'' she said.
   St. Joseph County Coroner Louis Grwinski said Jewellus K. Wood,
49, a truck driver, died of smoke inhalation and burns.
   Two residents were hospitalized in serious condition. Philip
Scott, 39, was being treated for burns at Memorial Hospital of South
Bend, and Sue Davis, 36, was hospitalized at St. Joseph Medical
Center for smoke inhalation, said hospital representatives.

<HEAD>UNICEF Says African, Latin Debt Threatens 10 Years of Progress for
Children</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At least 650,000 children died needlessly
last year partly as a result of the economic crisis in Africa, Latin
America and the Caribbean, the United Nations Children's Fund said
in its annual report.
   Crushing debt has forced many developing nations to cut social
spending, overshadowing the progress most nations made in the last
decade in fostering better health and education for children and
their parents, said UNICEF executive director James P. Grant in his
annual report, ``The State of the World's Children.''
   ``By far the heaviest consequences are being borne by children,''
said Grant.
   ``Throughout most of Africa and much of Latin America, average
incomes have fallen by 10-25 percent in the 1980s,'' he said.
   ``In the 37 poorest nations, spending per head on health has been
reduced by 50 percent, and on education by 25 percent, over the last
few years,'' he added.
   ``In many of the countries for which figures are available, child
malnutrition is on the increase,'' the report says.
   Ten deeply indebted Latin American and Caribbean nations and six
in Africa have experienced a slowing down in the reduction of
mortality in children under age 5 in 1980-87, compared with results
in 1970-80.
   The nations are Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Costa Rica, Cuba,
Ecuador, Haiti, Jamaica, Mexico, Panama, Benin, Botswana, Liberia,
Madagascar, Nigeria and Togo, according to Tony Hewett, the deputy
director of UNICEF's information division.
   ``For these 16 countries alone, the number of child deaths in the
last 12 months is approximately 650,000 more than would have been
the case if the 1970-80 rate of decline in under-five mortality had
continued,'' said Grant.
   ``The majority of these deaths (approximately 400,000 in Africa
and the remainder in Latin America) could therefore be said to be
related to the slowing down or reversal of the development process
during the 1980s, which is a result of unprecedented borrowing,
rising interest rates, falling commodity prices, inadequate
investment of borrowed funds, and the demoestic and international
management of the resulting debt crisis,'' said Grant.
   Grant did not include nations convulsed by war or civil strife,
such as Angola, Chad, Ethiopia and Mozambique, in order to limit his
estimate of 650,000 annual deaths to strictly economic problems.
   The UNICEF report notes ``the developing world is now
transferring $20 billion a year more to the rich nations than it
receives in new aid and loans.''
   UNICEF joins the General Assembly and the U.N. Conference on
Trade and Development in calling for an economic ``Marshall Plan,''
providing more development aid to the developing world and writing
off the debts of some of the most deeply indebted nations.
   The impact of the economic crisis tends to cloud the achievements
of governments and UNICEF, which are saving the lives of at least
2.5 million children yearly, the report says.
   Vaccines are now saving the lives of about 1.5 million children
each year in the developing world, Grant notes.
   At the beginning of the 1980s, less than 5 percent of the Third
World's children were immunized, and diseases such as whooping
cough, measles and tetanus killed up to 5 million children annually,
his report says.
   Now more than half the developing world's children are immunized,
and many nations are approaching UNICEF's goal of 85 percent
immunization by 1990.
   China, with one-sixth of the world's children, is believed to
have just achieved 85 percent immunization; India, home of 20
percent of the world's infants, is now past the 60 percent mark, the
report says.
   Botswana, Cuba, Egypt, Gambia, Iraq, Jordan, Oman, Rwanda, Saudi
Arabia and Tanzania have almost reached the 85 percent immunization
target, and Algeria, Brazil, Kenya, Mexico, Morocco, Pakistan and
Turkey are on track to reach 80-90 percent coverage by 1990, it says.
   A new goal is the immunization of pregnant women against tetanus,
which extends protection to their newborns, said the report. Only 25
percent of pregnant woman are now immunized, and tetanus kills over
800,000 infants yearly.
   In 1980, the World Health Organization launched a campaign to
reduce the death rate from dehydration caused by diarrhea, then
claiming 4 million children annually.
   By promoting the use of inexpensive Oral Rehydration Salts, a
simple method for preventing almost all dehydration deaths, 112
nations now are saving the lives of 750,000 to 1 million children
annually, the report says.
   An expanded education campaign is now needed to teach more
parents in developing nations about the technique, the report says.

<HEAD>Consumer Reports Calls Viralizer Ineffective</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cold sufferers will get more relief from chicken
soup than from a heavily advertized gadget that blows hot air or a
fine spray of medication into the nasal passages, according to
Consumer Reports.
   The Viralizer is being marketed in full-page newspaper
advertisements as ``the hottest thing in cold and allergy
treatments.'' But Consumer Reports charged in its January issue that
the device does not relieve cold symptoms and may be harmful to
delicate nasal tissues, which it said could be dried out and damaged
by excessive heat from the machine.
   Robert Krauser, president of Viral Response Systems Inc. of
Greenwich, Conn., which manufactures the device, countered: ``The
only thing in the story that's true is that they quote the ad
properly where we say it's the most effective relief you will ever
receive or your money back.''
   ``Other than that, it was malicious, defamatory and inaccurate,''
Krauser said in a telephone interview Monday.
   He cited a study by the James N. Gamble Institute of Medical
Research in Cincinnati that ``strongly suggests'' the Viralizer
relieves headaches, runny noses and congestion and helps prevent ear
infections stemming from colds.
   But Consumer Reports said the study, which was paid for by Viral
Systems, tested the device on only 22 people and would not merit
publication in a medical journal.
   Krauser said the study used 37 people and confirmed earlier
studies involving more than 150 people.
   Consumer Reports also cited a June letter from the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration charging Viral Response Systems with making
claims that were ``false and misleading or otherwise contrary to
fact.''
   Krauser said those charges referred to claims made for the
medication in the spray used in the Viralizer, and said labeling and
packaging for the product was changed in response to the complaint.
   Krauser said the Viralizer, which sells for about $35, has been
sold since January 1987 and that the company's 1988 sales will be
about $2.5 million.
   He said 70,000 Viralizers were sold in 1987, and of 2,000
consumer response cards returned to the company, 250 were from
customers who said they were not helped by the device. Refunds were
offered to all 250 customers, and 89 of them accepted the offer, he
said.

<TEXT>
   Solidarity's Lech Walesa said Monday that
he submitted names of three prominent opposition figures to a state
television official for a proposed TV debate on union pluralism and
the economy.
   Walesa debated Alfred Miodowicz, head of Poland's official trade
unions, in a nationwide telecast on Nov. 30. At that time, he
suggested that further TV discussions take place between opposition
members and officials on various social and political problems.
   Walesa said he spoke Monday with Marek Tumanowicz, deputy news
director at state television, and proposed a first followup
television discussion that would deal with union pluralism and the
economy.
   He proposed that the opposition be represented by economist
Ryszard Bugaj, journalist Tadeusz Mazowiecki, a close Walesa
adviser, and Wladyslaw Frasyniuk, a Solidarity leader from Wroclaw.
   Walesa said that according to his agreement with Tumanowicz, the
authorities now would review the list and propose a date for the TV
discussion.
   Walesa, a founder of Solidarity and 1983 Nobel Peace laureate,
said he did not believe he would take part in the debate.
   Miodowicz heads what is known as the OPZZ trade union alliance.
Walesa's group, Solidarity, is an independent trade movement that
officials crushed under martial law in 1981 and later banned.

   China successfully launched a new model space
exploration rocket from a recently opened space center on southern
Hainan Island, the official Xinhua News Agency said Tuesday.
   It said the space capsule put into orbit by Weaver Girl I floated
in the atmosphere for 2{ hours before returning to Earth 40 miles
from the launch site.
   Xinhua provided no details of the new rocket, which is named
after a Chinese legend.
   But it said the launch marked the first time Chinese scientists
gained direct access to mid-layer atmospheric data in a low-latitude
equatorial area.
   China has three other launch sites, all in medium latitudes. The
Hainan base was designed specifically for research into space
physical phenomena at low latitudes, Xinhua said in an earlier
report.
   Rockets launched from Hainan, about 19 degrees north of the
equator, will be used for space experiments from a height of about
74 miles above the Earth's surface, said the agency.
   Weaver Girl I was developed by the Chinese Academy of Sciences
and the University of Defense Science and Technology.
   Its predecessors, Long March II and Long March III, have logged
highly successfuly records of placing communications and research
satellites into orbit since the nation launched its first rocket in
1970.
   The U.S. State Department said Monday that China and the United
States had agreed on measures to prevent China from undercutting
private American launch services, opening the way for use of Chinese
rockets to launch American-made satellites for foreign companies.

   Premier Noboru Takeshita tried his hand on Tuesday
at coaxing the Soviet foreign minister into some movement on a
longstanding territorial dispute that blocks accord on a peace
treaty, a Foreign Ministry official said.
   Earlier, Japan for the first time indicated a willingness to
upgrade economic ties with Moscow despite the impasse.
   Rival claims over the tiny Kuril Islands off Japan's northern
Hokkaido Island has kept Moscow and Tokyo from signing a treaty to
formally end World War II hostilities. This has stalled
Soviet-Japanese relations and hampered economic cooperation between
the two countries.
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze, heading into a
second day of talks with Foreign Minister Sousuke Uno and other
officials, met with Takeshita on Tuesday to deliver a letter from
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   On Monday, Shevardnadze and Uno failed to iron out disagreements
on the dispute during about 6{ hours of talks.
   The ministry official, who briefed reporters on the condition of
anonymity, quoted Takeshita as telling Shevardnadze that resolution
of the land dispute ``would be the basis for permanent and stable
relations.'' The premier ``hoped the Soviet side would give serious
consideration to the issue,'' he quoted Takeshita as saying.
   The official said Shevardnadze, without proposing a specific
date, said Gorbachev has put a trip to Japan on his political
schedule and that Takeshita was welcome to visit Moscow.
   Soviet and Japanese officials labored on an agreement that might
boost economic ties despite the row over the Kurils, which Moscow
has held since the end of World War II and which Tokyo wants back.
The Soviets ousted 17,000 Japanese residents and later consolidated
their occupation with 10,000 troops.
   Shevardnadze asked Takeshita what Japan's attitude would be if
the dispute is not solved, the Japanese official said, and Takeshita
replied that the problem should be tackled with eagerness.
   ``The Soviets have shown no basic change in their position'' on
what Japan calls the Northern Territories, the official said.
   But he saw hope in the continued meetings of the two foreign
ministers and their aides on the issue.
   Until now, Japanese officials said they expected no progress in
bilateral relations until the Kremlin agreed to negotiate the return
of the islands.
   But in his Monday meeting with Shevardnadze, Uno said: ``Japan is
prepared to develop ... economic relations'' with the Soviet Union,
a country he desribed as having ``great potential,'' the Foreign
Ministry official reported.
   Trade between the Soviet Union and Japan has been hindered by
sensitivity over the territorial dispute and by national security
concerns.
   Two-way trade reached $4.9 billion in 1987 _ about 1.8 percent of
Japan's trade _ and is expected to hit $4.98 billion this year.
   Gorbachev has ambitious plans to develop the vast Siberian
region, a feat that would require input from foreign investors,
including the Japanese.
   Before Shevardnadze's arrival, Japanese officials hinted at a
possible compromise on the territorial dispute, but a senior Foreign
Ministry official said Japan's demand for the islands' return
remains unchanged.

join 536 other Americans today in formally electing Bush president,
fulfilling the antiquated but surviving constitutional ritual of the
Electoral College.
   ``It was a nice honor, to get to cast a vote for my dad,'' Neil
Bush, a Denver oilman, said before performing his duty. ``It'll be
nice to be a small footnote in history.''
   In state capitals across the nation, designated electors were
meeting to carry out their constitutional obligation and cast their
electoral ballots.
   This sets the stage for the final ceremony in a joint session of
Congress on Jan. 4, when Vice President Bush, as president of the

   A top PLO official says President-elect
George Bush has a better grasp of the Arab-Israeli conflict than any
U.S. leader since Richard Nixon and offers improved hopes for a
peace settlement.
   The assessment by Khalid Hassan, a senior adviser to PLO chairman
Yasser Arafat, came as another leading figure in the PLO said its
renunciation of terror does not mean it will cease attacks on
Israeli military targets.
   Also Sunday, Arafat described as ``positive'' Friday's initial
talks between the United States and the Palestine Liberation
Organization on ways of resolving the Arab-Israeli conflict.
   Washington last week reversed its 13-year ban on official
contacts with the PLO after Arafat renounced terrorism and accepted
Israel's right to exist. The next meeting is expected after the Bush
takes office on Jan. 20.
   Hassan, a co-founder of the PLO's dominant Fatah faction, said in
an interview in Tunis that he expects Bush or James Baker, the
designated secretary of state, to make a clear policy statement on
the Middle East peace process soon after the inauguration.

   Americans' generosity is being tested this holiday season in
response to the earthquake in Soviet Armenia and to the needy at
home.
   By at least one measure _ United Way's projection for the year of
6 percent to 7 percent growth _ donations nationwide appear to have
increased.
   Charities in many communities say contributions of money,
clothing, toys and food are at least keeping pace with last year and
should pick up this week before Christmas.
   But in other cities, contributions have dropped, hampered by cold
weather, a shortage of bell ringers, shopping malls that banish
fund-raisers from entrances, weak local economies, or even a drain
on givers from campaign contributions earlier this year.
   Efforts to aid the victims of the earthquake in Soviet Armenia
appear to be having an impact on domestic giving in some cities, but
not in others, say spokesmen for the Salvation Army, American Red
Cross, Volunteers of America, United Way, food banks and other
charities.
   Among the nation's biggest cities, collections were reported up
in New York, Chicago, and Atlanta, but down in Los Angeles. In the
Midwest, Indianapolis, Kansas City, Mo., and St. Louis reported
healthy donations, while Minneapolis, Detroit and Iowa's cities were
having a more difficult time. And in the West, Phoenix and Tucson,
Ariz., showed drops, while Denver and Salt Lake City charities said
their contributions were on target.

   A review panel today recommended higher
salaries and greater independence for top scientists at the National
Institutes of Health, the government's chief research arm in the
fight against AIDS, cancer and other major diseases.
   The committee of the National Academy of Sciences also
recommended against turning NIH into an independent agency or
farming its projects out to private companies.
   The report said research at NIH makes ``invaluable contributions
to our knowledge and understanding of basic biological process and
their dysfunction in disease,'' but that this excellence is
threatened unless changes are made in management and salary levels.
   The report was prompted by a recommendation from the Reagan
administration's Office of Management and Budget that NIH research
be taken from the government and turned over to private companies.

<BYLINE>Is She Really THAT Clumsy?
^By HILLEL ITALIE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For years, Priscilla Presley has been a darling
of the tabloids, as fans followed her storybook romance with Elvis
and watched her square off with the Ewings in ``Dallas.''
   Now in ``Naked Gun,'' the latest production from ``Airplane''
creators David Zucker, Jim Abrahams and Jerry Zucker (``ZAZ''), you
can meet the ``real'' Priscilla Presley, a charming, alluring woman
with an endearing tendency to not look where she's going.
   ``It's opened up a whole new world for me,'' said Presley, whose
clumsy character fits right into the upside down world of ``Naked
Gun.''
   ``If someone had told me a couple of years ago, I'd be doing
`Naked Gun' with Leslie Nielsen I would have thought they were
crazy.''
   In ``Naked Gun,'' she's first seen at the top of a winding
staircase, a closeup affirming her status as one of the world's most
beautiful women. She gazes down at an admiring Nielsen and the two
are in love. She then proceeds to tumble down the stairs.
   ``I have go to back and see it two or three more times for things
that I missed in the script. You're laughing so hard watching it,
you have to go back and see it again,'' she said.
   It might strike movie fans as unusual to cast Presley in a
slapstick role, but her lack of comedic experience was exactly what
ZAZ _ as they call themselves _ was looking for.
   ``I loved the script and I wanted desperately to be in the
film,'' she said. ``During the interview I was asked if I had ever
done comedy, and I said I never had done it. I thought that was it
for me.''
   But as Presley learned, ZAZ wanted actors who could play
off-the-wall scenes with complete seriousness. ``They said don't
play funny. `You mean like it happens everyday?' I asked. I'm always
bumping into walls, right?''
   ``Naked Gun,'' based on the ZAZ TV series ``Police Squad,'' stars
Nielsen as Lt. Frank Drebin, a bumbling Los Angeles officer who must
prevent a corrupt businessman (Ricardo Montalban) from assassinating
Queen Elizabeth II while she visits the city.
   Presley plays Montalban's personal assistant, who falls in love
with Drebin and helps foil the murder plot.
   ``It was hard trying to get adjusted to all this funniness,''
said the actress, who played the very serious Jenna Wade in
``Dallas.''
   ``In one scene, Leslie and I are having dinner. He's making
suggestive comments and I'm licking his fingers. We must have done
it about five times we were laughing so much.''
   Presley, the daughter of an Air Force officer, was just 14 years
old when she met Elvis in West Germany in 1960 and agreed to return
with him to his Graceland mansion in Memphis, Tenn.
   Elvis and Priscilla were married in 1967 _ news cameras
faithfully recording the event _ and the following year a daughter,
Lisa Marie, was born. The marraige, however, could not withstand the
pressures of Elvis' unprecedented fame and the Presleys were
divorced in 1973.
   Priscilla remains protective of Elvis, who died in 1977. In
response to the succession of books written about the late rock 'n'
roll star, she decided to come out with one of her own, ``Elvis and
Me.''
   ``My book showed a much more human side. It gave him more
understanding,'' said Presley, who lives in California with
writer-director Marco Garibaldi and their 1-year-old son, Navarone
Anthony.
   She originally sought a quiet life after her divorce, and she ran
her own boutique before drifting into show business. She appeared in
commercials as a spokeswoman for Wella Balsam and made her
television acting debut in 1979 as co-host of ``Those Amazing
Animals.''
   Four years later, she auditioned for ``Dallas'' for the part of
Bobby Ewing's new girlfriend. She was understandably nervous; she
had limited acting experience and knew little about the show.
   ``I only knew about `Who shot J.R?''' she admitted. ``I didn't
think I'd get the part.''
   However, she hit it off with Patrick Duffy, who plays Bobby Ewing.
   ``Everyone told me if I passed the test with Patrick I was in. I
was a little bit reserved at first, I have a tendency of doing that,
but he just wants to have fun. If you go in with an ego, I think
Patrick will run over you.''
   She left ``Dallas'' after five seasons and is anxious to pursue
her career in movies.
   ``I'd love to be in the position of a Meryl Streep or Kathleen
Turner,'' she said. ``I'm getting good scripts, but those people are
out for those parts, too. At this point, I'd take a part just for
the experience; I have some dues to pay.''
   And she enjoyed the opportunity to have fun at her own expense in
``Naked Gun.''
   ``All we did was laugh at ourselves,'' she said. ``I did come in
uptight because I didn't know what had been written about me, but
this relaxed me a lot.''

<HEAD>Writer Says Chinese Communists Eroding Traditional Cultural Values</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANNIE HUANG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bo Yang, a widely known Chinese author,
says his first visit back to China in four decades has left him
alarmed by what he called the erosion of traditional Chinese values
under communism.
   That was one of several shocks Bo said he received during a
month-long visit to his homeland in November. But he added that he
was pleased to find many people were influenced by his critical
writings of Chinese society, in which he denounces authoritarianism.
   ``They said, `You speak the truth and you can be the savior of
the Chinese people,''' he told a reporter at his hillside apartment
in suburban Hsintien overlooking Taipei.
   Bo, 68, was born in Henan province in eastern China but was among
the 2 million people to flee to Taiwan with the Nationalist
government that lost a civil war to Mao Tse-tung's communist forces
in 1949.
   His provocative writing has since led to attacks by both the
Nationalist government on Taiwan and communist government in Beijing.
   As a newspaper columnist in Taiwan, Bo accused the Nationalists
of corruption and power abuse. In 1968, he was sentenced to nine
years in prison on charges of being a communist spy.
   Authorities in mainland China permitted the publication of Bo's
works but last year temporarily banned his book ``The Ugly Chinese''
and several essay collections, claiming they insulted the Chinese
people.
   Bo has remained surprisingly popular on both Taiwan and the
mainland even though his writings have told Chinese that their
culture, a source of pride for centuries, has many shortcomings.
   He is known for his scathing criticism of the Chinese people as
being too loud, too cruel, too selfish and too willing to tolerate
the abuse of power by authorities.
   Bo says the Chinese have their virtues but fears they are
crumpling under the communist regime.
   ``Under nationalization, where everything belongs to the
government, people have lost many of the traditional Chinese
virtues, such as modesty and politeness,'' Bo said in the interview
with The Associated Press.
   ``The communist system is more feudal than the traditional
(imperial) Chinese system. The Chinese communists have disrupted the
good Chinese values more completely and without feeling any shame.''
   The author said he was surprised that shop clerks in Shanghai
treated customers rudely and that quarrels frequently broke out on
city streets. He said when people would ask him for advice he would
reply: ``Chinese, please have a smile.''
   Bo returned to his hometown of Hui to visit two daughters left
behind in the civil war. He also traveled to Beijing, Shanghai and
Xian where he met scholars, writers and students.
   Bo said hundreds of high school and college students showed up to
speak with him when he appeared at a promotional campaign sponsored
by a publishing company in Xian, the capital of central Shaanxi
province.
   ``So many young people seemed to have lost their hope in the
country,'' he said, stroking a pet Siamese cat curled up on his lap.
``Some even boldly asked how the communists could be driven away.''
   Bo said other students traveled for hours by train and bus to
visit him at Hui.
   ``They wanted to hear some frank talk,'' he said. ``They have
lived too long in a closed-up society where few people speak the
truth.''
   Bo said he met many people, including university officials, hotel
clerks and street vendors, who had read ``The Ugly Chinese,'' which
was published in 1985 and portrays Chinese as selfish, unconcerned
about other people's rights and unwilling to face their problems.
The author argues that those qualities hurt democracy and favor
authoritarian regimes.
   The book was clandestinely passed around and photocopied in 1987
after it was banned on the mainland.
   ``I never knew that the book had such an impact in China,'' he
said.
   During the trip, Bo said, he collected about $35,000 of royalties
from Chinese firms for his 35 books published on the mainland. But
added that he had to scrap plans to set up awards for Chinese poets
and novelists with the money because the authorities disapproved.
   Bo's most recent project, which he began in 1983 and is about
two-thirds done, is translating into modern Chinese a 10th-century
Sung dynasty classic that covers 1,400 years of Chinese history. He
works 12 hours a day on it.

   Thailand is winning the war against
the dreaded disease leprosy. But that comes as little comfort to
thousands of lepers who are likely to spend the rest of their days
in colonies as objects of repulsion.
   Although contemporary medicine stresses leprosy is preventable,
curable and not particularly contagious, the tell-tale patches of
discolored skin cause marriage breakups; clawed fingers turn friends
into strangers; the erosion of flesh means the exile of lepers to
one of country's 21 colonies and leprosariums.
   But in these segregated worlds, Thailand's ``poorest of the
poor'' smile and press together their stubby, fingerless hands in
greeting, profusely thanking outsiders for coming to visit them.
They talk without embarrassment about their condition.
   ``Here, they are free to share their problems. They can take care
of each other. And nobody looks down on them,'' said the Rev.
Banchong Chaiyara, a 43-year-old Roman Catholic priest who oversees
projects to help some 1,500 lepers in northeastern Thailand.
   Banchong and others believe that after treatment lepers should be
integrated into society. But given existing prejudices this becomes
virtually impossible.
   In and around this provincial city are church-supported enclaves
and a large, self-contained leper community, Non Somboon, run by the
Thai government for 1,200 lepers and their famlies. It includes
individual homes, schools, farmland, even a jail (begging ``on the
outside'' appears to be the major offense).
   The network of church projects, some of them inside Non Somboon,
provides lifetime care. A kindergarten for children of lepers
stresses personal cleanliness and a nutritious diet as bulwarks
against the nerve- and skin-ravaging disease.
   There are dormitories for those undergoing treatment and classes
in shoemaking, sewing and carpentry for lepers to learn a trade and
earn income. Most residents are from poor rural families.
   The oldest, believed to be near 100, hardly ever stirs in a bed
at the Old Age Home. Her two children, both lepers, have died and
nobody can remember when she first came.
   One of the youngest is 14-year-old Phitsamai Boorapha, who
arrived several months ago crying in pain and watching the gradual
clawing of her little fingers.
   ``The other children didn't want to talk or play with me,'' the
shy girl said.
   ``I don't think I will be cured,'' Phitsamai said. When asked
about an occupation, marriage and other plans for the future, she
replied: ``I don't have any dreams.''
   Public ignorance about the disease and the disfigurement it
causes have traditionally tended to make lepers outcasts in many
parts of the world.
   In Thailand, some Buddhists believe leprosy is punishment for
sins committed in a previous life.
   Leprosy workers in Thailand tell of a patient who returned from
treatment to find he had been registered as dead by his parents. In
another case, parents hired killers to dispose of their diseased
child, but the child was later found abandoned in a forest by the
would-be killers.
   Banchong says a leper who turns out superb shoes at the
church-run workshop probably couldn't make it on the outside:
customers wouldn't buy his product if they knew about his disease.
   Nevertheless, Sister Mercedes, one of more than a dozen
Philippines nuns working with Banchong, notes progress since she
first arrived in 1969. She recalls hospitals turning away lepers,
whom she calls ``the poorest of the poor.''
   Now, she says, the government mounts impressive programs and more
are seeking treatment at the early stage of the disease, when cure
is relatively simple, rather than waiting in shame and secrecy as so
often in the past.
   ``I think the end is in sight,'' she said, reflecting government
statistics that show a decline in registered leprosy cases from
140,000 in 1954 to about 25,000 currently.
   However, the total number of lepers is conservatively estimated
at more than double this figure.
   ``By the time they found good medicine I had already lost my
fingers,'' said 70-year-old Naimak Jiranai. Now, both his legs are
gone and his face is very disfigured. He moves around on a crude
wheelchair.
   His wife had run away, he says, and his two children sold his
house and fields when he left to seek treatment. Eventually,
Naimak's leprosy was medically arrested, but Banchong said he has no
other home now but the colony.
   ``When I was a boy I broke the legs of frogs and was cruel to
other animals of the field,'' Naimak said. ``Maybe that's why I
became a leper.''

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This long-suffering nation has
embarked on a presidential campaign played out against a backdrop of
surging political killing. The winner's prize in the balloting March
19 is a stalemated civil war.
   Each passing week lengthens the list of dead, maimed and
displaced in the 9-year-old guerrilla war without providing
prospects for resolution of the insurgency either through
negotiations or by force.
   The result is a tiredness of spirit among the country's 5.5
million people, especially the two-thirds who eke out a living
raising corn and beans on small plots.
   The main contenders for the presidency are Alfredo Cristiani of
the Nationalist Republican Alliance _ the resurgent right-wing group
known as Arena _ and Fidel Chavez Mena of the incumbent Christian
Democratic Party.
   Cristiani, a U.S.-educated coffee grower and businessman, has a
narrow lead, but far from a majority, in the latest reliable poll.
   Arena trounced the flagging Christian Democrats in municipal and
legislative elections in March, winning an outright majority in the
60-seat unicameral legislature.
   One new factor is the political left, which is running candidates
for the first time since the mid-1970s. Leftist leaders acknowledge
they have no chance of winning, but say they hope to drum up support
for negotiations.
   Arena, citing its own polls, says it has the election wrapped up.
   But Sigifredo Ochoa, a retired army colonel, legislator and one
of Arena's top leaders, charged recently that some sectors in
Washington intend to ``impose'' Chavez Mena as president.
   Arena claims the United States, which has provided El Salvador
with more than $3 billion in aid this decade, helped rig elections
in 1984 and 1985 to ensure Christian Democratic victories.
   ``If Arena is deprived of its rightful victory, well, someone
asked me if we did not win the election would we resort to
nationalist guerrilla warfare. And I say a frustrated people could
do just that,'' Ochoa said.
   The Christian Democrats, as well as local and international human
rights groups, say Arena was closely linked to death squads that
killed thousands of suspected leftists in the early 1980s. Arena
denies the charges.
   The Christian Democrats' popularity has been drastically eroded
by nearly five years of unfulfilled promises, economic stagnation
and the widely held perception of official corruption.
   They have not been able to make any progress towards ending the
war, which pits about 7,000 Marxist-led guerrillas against the
56,000-member, U.S.-backed armed forces.
   President Jose Napoleon Duarte, a staunch U.S. ally, has been
diagnosed as having terminal liver cancer. Chemotherapy appears to
have arrested its spread, and his most fervent hope is to be able to
personally hand over power to his successor June 1.
   Duarte, 63, contines to work. But his prestige and influence are
greatly diminished.
   ``He is not only a lame duck, he has no power to do anything,''
said Ignacio Martin Baro, a Roman Catholic priest and vice-rector of
the Central American University.
   No one envisions peace negotiations with the leftist guerrillas
before the next administration takes over.
   Three rounds of negotiations between 1984 and 1987 proved
fruitless. The opposing positions have not changed significantly,
and there is little besides increased war-weariness to foster hope
of a breakthrough.
   Arena says it will talk with guerrillas, but Ochoa said that such
discussions would not be negotiations. He added that Arena, in
power, would propose a ``national plan'' drawn up with input from
outside the party.
   Ochoa contends the armed forces have had their hands tied by
human rights concerns and other factors. He maintains that
government troops could win in about two years without restraints.
   But the guerrillas have been persistent and apparently have the
moral and material support of many people in the countryside, the
campesinos. Even U.S. military advisers here say the rebels are a
thoroughly motivated fighting force.
   The war's stalemate apparently has contributed to this year's
steep rise in politically motivated killings _ summary executions by
the army, death squads and the guerrillas.
   The Roman Catholic Church's Legal Aid office has counted 169 such
killings _ 90 by the army, 46 by death squads and 33 by the rebels _
in the first nine months of 1988. That is a 70 percent increase over
the same period in 1987.
   ``There is growing frustration in the armed forces,'' said Martin
Baro of Central American University. ``How are they not going to be
frustrated if they've received (from the United States) all
conceivable aid for eight years, everything they wanted and more,''
but still can't defeat the outnumbered and badly equipped guerrillas.
   The guerrillas have condemned every previous election this decade
as ``a farce'' designed to further what they say is a U.S.-sponsored
``counterinsurgency project.''
   Radio Venceremos, their clandestine voice, said recently,
``Organized and combative struggle is the alternative to the
electoral maneuver.''
   But they have not overrun a significant military post in 18
months, and army officers say the rebels are concentrating on
``soft'' targets.
   The officers say that indicates rebel weakness relative to a year
or so ago.

<HEAD>West Germany and France Provide Impetus for European Unity</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KEVIN COSTELLOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   West Germany and France, bound by a new
defense agreement and headed toward creation of joint embassies, are
providing some of the greatest impetus for European unity.
   As the European Economic Community moves toward the removal of
internal barriers by the end of 1992, West Germany and France have
been pushing innovation in various key areas, including the economic
sphere.
   The moves come as Western Europe jockeys to compete more
effectively with the United States on world markets, and some
quarters call for a reduction of the 326,000 American military
personnel in Europe.
   ``It's obvious for all Europeans that the Americans won't be in
Europe forever'' Brig. Gen. Dominique Pennacchioni, the defense
attache at the French Embassy in Bonn, said in an interview.
   ``We know that we have to prepare in advance for the future. We
(the French and West Germans) are showing the way that should be
taken.''
   He stressed, however, that West Europeans view American troops as
indispensable, and the view is unlikely to change in the near future.
   France and West Germany, which have worked for decades to put the
bitter experience of the two World Wars behind them, have taken
these joint steps recently:
   _Approved a joint defense and security council. It will meet at
least twice a year starting in early 1989 to coordinate virtually
all aspects of defense, including disarmament, and will include the
heads of government as well as the foreign and defense ministers.
   _Created a joint economics council of their finance and economics
ministers, as well as the central bank presidents. The council will
meet four times a year starting in 1989 to reach agreement on
various economic issues, including inflation, currency rates as well
as some foreign trade questions.
   _Agreed to establish a 4,200-man joint French-German military
brigade that will be fully in operation in Boeblingen outside
Stuttgart by October 1990. It will include infantry, tanks and
artillery. As a preliminary move, a joint French-West German staff
of 52 soldiers already has been established in Boeblingen, with
troops scheduled to start gathering next year.
   _Made plans to open a joint embassy in Mongolia by 1990, with
another one in another country at a later date. The embassies could
be models for future such bilateral cooperation, possibly including
joint embassies with other countries.
   The joint military work probably is the most ambitious project _
and the one that has raised eyebrows within the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization.
   ``I have the impression that the other European countries have
some apprehensions,'' Gen. Pennacchioni said in the interview.
``They are afraid of a French-German leadership.''
   Said Lt. Col. Joerg Schweinsteiger of the West German Defense
Ministry: ``The Americans, British and Italians reacted critically
(to the joint military brigade). The Italians reacted very
critically. Perhaps that was a feeling that they were being excluded.
   ``Then we explained everything, and the criticism went down.''
   Schweinsteiger emphasized: ``You cannot view this as the first
step toward an initiative that would do without an American military
engagement in Europe. The French and the Germans view the American
presence as indispensable.''
   The West German Greens party took exception to the bilateral
defense council.
   A Greens member of Parliament, Thomas Ebermann, charged: ``The
agreement signals a step toward a German-French nuclear axis aimed
at Eastern Europe.''
   Bonn officials also have come up with another Euro-centric
defense idea, a proposal for a multinational European military
division of about 15,000 troops within NATO.
   ``It is a German initiative for another European effort to
improve defense,'' Gen. Wolfgang Altenburg, the West German chairman
of NATO's Military Committee, said during a recent high-level NATO
meeting in Brussels.
   It would include forces from West Germany, Britain, the
Netherlands, Belgium and possibly Luxembourg.
   ``The proposal was taken seriously, but not everyone applauded,''
said Josef Janning, an East-West expert at the Institute for
Political Studies at the University of Mainz.
   ``The West Germans have thrown two stones into the water and they
want to see which one makes the bigger ripples,'' said Janning, in
reference to the joint brigade and possible European division.
   Janning also said he saw wide-ranging economic motives in
French-West German economic cooperation.
   ``The French see the West Germans have the best contacts with the
East bloc. So the French see it's best to work with the Germans in
that area.''
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany has called for even closer
cooperation between West German and France in formulating a ``joint
European policy'' toward the Soviet Union and its East European
allies.
   West Germany and France also are developing major initiatives in
diplomacy, including the possibility of joint embassy receptions.
   Two French diplomats already are working in the West German
Foreign Ministry, and two West Germans are serving in the French
Foreign Ministry.
   Juergen Pfeifer, a spokesman for the West German Foreign
Ministry, said the joint French-West Germany embassy in
Communist-run Mongolia is to be open by 1990 with plans for a second
in an as yet undisclosed country.
   ``These integrated embassies could be a model for future
cooperation with another country,'' Pfeifer said in an interview.
``Both countries are functioning as a driving force for further
European cooperation.''
   The various measures come as a new poll indicates a rise in
respect between French and West Germans, compared with five years
ago.
   A French-German poll conducted by the independent polling firm
SOFRES said that 54 percent of the French surveyed considered West
Germany their best friend, while 67 percent of the West Germans
interviewed felt the same about France. The United States came in
second in both countries.
   In a similar poll in 1983, 48 percent of the French surveyed
rated West Germany at the top of their allies list, while 53 percent
of the West Germans placed France at the top of their list.

<HEAD>Ralph Bakshi Says `Tattertown' Began with High School Doodling</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JERRY BUCK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nick at Nite, the cable channel that has
revived old sitcoms for prime time, is getting its own new cartoon
series.
   But Ralph Bakshi's ``Tattertown'' will fit right in _ it's about
discarded objects that come to life.
   Bakshi said the concept of ``Tattertown'' began as doodling in
high school.
   ``It's been in development for 25 years,'' Bakshi declared.
``It's my monster. It started in high school as a comic strip. It
was an excuse to make fun of who we are by the objects we throw
away. `Tattertown' is a world where everything we once owned comes
alive.''
   ``Tattertown'' debuts Wednesday on Nick at Night with a Christmas
special that introduces Debbie and her stuffed doll Muffit.
   Debbie is the only human in a world where inanimate objects come
to life. Muffit becomes the evil ruler of this magical world, while
Debbie struggles to bring her back to the real world.
   Thirty-nine additional half-hour episodes will be shown on Nick
at Nite in 1989 and 1990.
   ``It's nostalgic, with cartoons and stuff from the 1920s and
'30s,'' said Bakshi, who is best known for such adult animated
features as ``Fritz the Cat,'' ``Heavy Traffic,'' ``Coonskin,''
``The Lord of the Rings'' and ``American Pop.'' He also produces
``Mighty Mouse: The New Adventures'' for CBS.
   ``Tattertown,'' he said, ``has a kind of 1926 style to it. This
is my first true-to-life thing for kids. My other cartoons were more
for adults. It's my first step into Disney's world of wholesome
stuff for kids. Still, I think adults will like the nostalgia of it.
   ``It won't be as satiric as `Mighty Mouse.' I think kids will see
those wonderful toys running around. I think they'll get it. You
can't talk down to them. We'll have three kinds of music. Paul
Whiteman white-bread music, Duke Ellington sophisticated jazz and
hot jazz like Fats Waller and Fletcher Henderson.''
   Bakshi was in his cramped studios located in what looks like an
old motel in Van Nuys. Drawings were pinned all over the walls, and
every inch of space was taken up with animators working on the
celluloid frames.
   One of his directors, Maurice Noble, worked on ``Snow White'' for
Walt Disney and on various cartoons at Warner Bros.
   Bakshi said he was approached by Nick at Nite after he completed
work on ``Mighty Mouse.''
   About half the animation will be done at his studios and the rest
overseas. ``We do more animation here than most companies,'' he
said. ``We do all the key posing and timing. Besides, my motto is if
you don't have animators around who can you yell at?''
   Bakshi grew up wanting to become another Al Capp, creator of the
newspaper comic strip ``Li'l Abner.''
   At the age of 21 he became the youngest animator in the business
at Terrytoons. He was soon promoted to director and at 24 was the
studio's creative director.
   On the side he drew ``Fearless Fosdick'' sequences for Capp's
``Li'l Abner.'' He made numerous attempts to start his own comic
strip, but he was turned down by all the syndicates.
   ``I quit Terrytoons and started my own studio when I was about
27,'' he said. ``I didn't know what I was doing. The first thing I
did was `Fritz the Cat.'''
   ``Fritz'' got an ``X'' rating when it was released in 1972. It
attracted a lot of attention, and Bakshi picked up a reputation as
rebel.
   ``I'm just an artist who runs a studio and tries to uphold the
rights of artists,'' he said. ``I'm not a rebel. I've had a lot of
troubles. I just want my freedom of speech. I want to be able to
express myself. I just want to do my job. `Fritz' was a great
cartoon. `Heavy Traffic' was better.''
   He leaned back in his chair. ``I'm not a rebel,'' he said. ``I've
mellowed out.''
   Bakshi will also produce and direct an animated special based on
Dr. Seuss' ``The Butter Battle Book.'' Ted Geisel, who writes under
the name of Dr. Seuss, is writing the script and lyrics for the
songs. Chuck Jones, who directed the Peabody Award-winning Seuss
classic ``How the Grinch Stole Christmas'' will be a consultant.

<TEXT>
   Ordinarily in the story of the first Christmas,
the man of the family is subordinated as a secondary figure. In
actuality, he carried out an essential and decisive role.
   That's the anomaly of Joseph, husband of Mary.
   The generally scant attention given him is pointed out by
Episcopal Presiding Bishop Edmond L. Browning, who suggests more
appreciation is in order for Joseph's heroism.
   He often ``is omitted from our recollection of events'' of
Jesus's birth or portrayed ``unobtrusively in the background,
leaning on his staff'' or leading a donkey, Browning says in his
Christmas message.
   The spotlight, meanwhile, is focused on Mary and the child.
   Yet Joseph guided and protected that family through dangers which
threatened it, Browning says, noting that it was no easy, placid
affair, but one beset with troubles.
   The burdens laid on Joseph began when he learned to his painful
dismay that the young woman to whom he was betrothed, Mary, had
become pregnant by someone else.
   Being a just, law-abiding Jew, yet not wanting to ``put her to
shame'' by openly renouncing her, the account says, he
broken-heartedly ``resolved to divorce her quietly.''
   Distraught and sorrowing, he then had a strange dream in which an
angel reassured him that Mary was pregnant by the Holy Spirit and
would bear a special son who would save people from sin.
   Wild or imagined, Joseph seized it as real and sure, claiming
Mary as his bride. When ordered to Bethlehem for a tax registration,
he took her with him, though it wasn't required, possibly to shield
her from Nazareth gossip.
   After they had traveled the 90 miles of dusty road and nightly
camps, with her in the late stages of pregnancy, they found the town
jammed, with no room in the inn.
   Joseph finally found a sheltering livestock cavern, and there he
helped Mary to a pallet of straw and cared for her as the child was
born.
   Later, Joseph had another strange dream _ and he again acted on
it for the sake of that child. The dream was that the king had
ordered the child killed.
   ``Rise,'' the angelic voice warned, ``take the child and his
mother, and flee to Egypt, and remain there till I tell you; for
Herod is about to search for the child to destroy him.''
   In the middle of the night, Joseph roused his wife, and hastily
assembling essential gear, they left with the child, heading south
toward Egypt.
   For many months, they were refugees, sleeping wherever they
could, surviving on what he could earn on work gangs or otherwise.
But he somehow provided for his family.
   Eventually, through another dream, Joseph decided they could
safely return and they did so, making that long trip back to
Nazareth.
   There, as Jesus reached boyhood, Joseph took over teaching him _
prayers, blessings, Scripture and the carpentry trade.
   When a lad of l2, Jesus showed an independent streak, getting
absorbed in conversing with Temple scholars in Jerusalem, while his
parents hunted him for three days before finding him.
   Joseph, the ``patient carpenter,'' was ``ever God's obedient
servant,'' Browning says, responding to each crisis to protect and
shield Mary and the child. Browning adds:
   ``Joseph was called by God to do what was socially unacceptable
in taking a pregnant Mary into his house; he was unable to find a
suitable place for her to give birth.
   ``He led his family into exile; he had to begin a new life. ...
Joseph is an important part of our understanding of the incarnation
because he helps remind us that God entered into the very core of
humanity.
   ``Joseph reminds us that God often calls the most lowly and the
most unlikely to be instruments of salvation. Joseph reminds us that
our relationships may not always be trouble-free or happy, but they
can be holy.''

   Christmas services provide an opportunity to draw
alienated Catholics back into regular worship, but priests tend to
``ridicule and demean'' them for attending so infrequently, says the
Rev. Andrew Greeley.
   Writing in U.S. Catholic, published by the Claretian Fathers, the
noted priest-sociologist-novelist says:
   ``One of the more twisted and sick kinks in clerical culture is
the propensity to ridicule and demean the `Christmas Catholics' and,
even when priests are on their best behavior, to patronize them.''
   Greeley says ``Christmas Catholics,'' who show up only on such
holidays, often are alienated from the church, having been hurt or
confused by it, and they ``need to know there's room for them in the
inn, too.''
   He adds, ``Welcoming the alienated and inviting them to come home
and stay home permanently is surely far more in the spirit of
Christmas than brutalizing them again.''

   On a day when it should have been
detecting drug smugglers, the U.S. Customs Service's $20 million
flying radar platform was towed to its hangar for repairs.
   The radar dome atop the four-engine P3 Orion had stopped spinning
in flight for the third time in a week this month. Radar specialists
inside couldn't produce those snazzy color-coded displays on their
computer screens, designating friendly and suspect planes more than
200 miles away.
   As the plane inched down the flight line to Customs' spanking new
$4.5 million hangar, the agency's war against airborne and seagoing
drug smugglers also slowed down.
   For the Customs Service air branch generally, and the
surveillance unit based here on the Gulf of Mexico, this can be the
best and worst of times.
   Less than a decade ago, Customs fliers felt like World War I
aviators, bouncing around in light single-engine planes, using
binoculars to spot the enemy.
   But Rep. Glenn English, D-Okla., and Sen. Dennis DeConcini,
D-Ariz., wanted a real Customs air force, and while many federal
agencies retrenched, the air interdiction program shot up like an
adolescent child.
   There are 88 Customs airplanes now, including detection aircraft,
trackers, interceptors and helicopters carrying officers ready to
swoop down and make an arrest.
   The program that employed 153 people in 1981 and cost $27.3
million now has a $165 million budget and 811 employees.
   But expansion has brought severe growing pains as equipment has
broken down, sometimes because it is too old and sometimes because
it is too new.
   Failures have plagued all seven airplanes here at Corpus Christi,
where the mission is the weakest link in stopping drug smuggling _
detecting smugglers' planes and boats and sorting them from the pack.
   ``We're looking for one little guy among hundreds,'' said Stanley
Adams, an air branch chief and pilot in Corpus Christi. ``We've
caught most of the idiots. Now we're up against the smart ones. They
do have the edge now, but it's a start.''
   At the top of the detection pyramid is the new P3 airborne early
warning flying radar platform. Lockheed, which designed the plane
for anti-submarine warfare and detection, modified it to include the
24-foot spinning radar dome atop the fuselage.
   Tied to a General Electric radar used by the military, the plane
has capabilities similar to an Air Force Airborne Warning and
Control (AWACS) aircraft. The P3 has done well when working, Adams
said, and in one crucial test near Colombia, it spotted virtually
all aircraft taking off from a known drug-producing region.
   But during a week-long visit by a reporter, the dome would stop
spinning when the plane's speed reached 200 knots, and it had to be
taken out of service while uneasy Lockheed experts tried to find the
problem.
   ``They want to do dog and pony shows, but the bugs are not worked
out yet,'' said one Customs air crewman, who insisted on anonymity.
``They shoved it out of the factory too quick.''
   Added another crewman, ``It was a political move. Instead of
working out all the bugs, they put it on the market.''
   The early warning radar isn't the only problem plaguing the
surveillance unit.
   Crewmen said the main radar in four P3s used for detection and
long-range tracking of smugglers has failed often, an event
witnessed by a reporter.
   The radar was built for an F-15 ``air superiority'' plane, an Air
Force jet that stays in the air an average of one hour and 20
minutes. But during P3 flights of six and even 12 hours, the radar's
guidance system goes haywire, giving operators false readings of
planes and boats traveling 800 miles an hour.
   Customs crews said that in an intense 10-day mission in the
Caribbean earlier this year, the guidance system on one P3 was not
functioning about three-quarters of the time, even though the
equipment was replaced twice during the operation.
   A reporter also witnessed the radar fail in one of Customs' two
twin-engine E2C Hawkeyes, a surveillance plane built for aircraft
carrier duty in the Navy.
   A dome radar aircraft with limited range, the Customs E2C
experienced a failure of its detector processor, the radar's
computer that tracks other airplanes.
   The two Hawkeyes given to Customs by the Navy have had so many
carrier landings they are ``ready for the boneyard,'' according to
one crewman who flies in them often.
   These failures are significant, because Customs Commissioner
William von Raab estimated that only 5 percent of the drug smuggling
planes flying over the southwestern border from Texas to California
are apprehended. Detection also is poor in the Gulf of Mexico, but
it is near 25 percent south of Florida.
   Von Raab predicted that when Customs can apprehend one-quarter of
the smuggler aircraft, drug pilots will think twice about the risk.
That has happened near Florida; many smugglers changed tactics,
dropping their loads to small boats rather than fly near the U.S.
mainland.
   When all the equipment is working, the surveillance planes here
fly only about 12 hours a day, giving smugglers a free ride half the
time.
   Despite such problems, Customs officials, crewmen and lawmakers
believe the air detection system will be an effective weapon when
it's finally in place _ perhaps by 1991.
   Customs is scheduled to receive another airborne early warning P3
next April and has proposed an eventual fleet of four.

   The airplanes will be supplemented by a system of tethered radar
balloons in the southeast, the Gulf of Mexico and all along the
southwestern border. Called aerostats, the balloons fly 10,000 feet
above the surface and provide coverage at lower altitudes, where
drug smugglers usually fly.
   Only four of 17 planned aerostats are now operational. Funds have
so far been approved for only eight more.
   ``Once we reach 1991, if we have the aerostats in place and
receive the kind of support we anticipate from the military, we will
have a very effective shield,'' said English. ``That's not to say
this will be the answer to the war on drugs. This does not mean
drugs won't come in, but it will be far more expensive, dangerous
and difficult.''
   Once the aerostat radar ``shield'' is operating from Florida to
California, the P3 flying detection platforms will come into their
own. These aircraft can see 360 degrees around and 200 miles away.
Radar specialists at two computer terminals inside can bring up
displays by simply touching their screens.
   As airplanes appear as small squares, the operator assesses their
speed, altitude, course and other data and assigns them colors:
green for friendly, yellow for unknown and red for hostile.
   The surveillance branch in Corpus Christi says 75 arrests
resulted from its detection program from July last year through
September of 1988.
   The single P3 AEW has operated only since July, and 15 of the
arrests have been made since then.
   In the 14-month period, 30 land vehicles or boats and 17
airplanes were seized, and five of the aircraft were taken since the
P3 detection platform has been flying.
   The entire air branch reported 438 arrests in fiscal 1988, up
from 250 in 1987 and 167 in 1986. Also in fiscal 1988, 71 airplanes,
176 vehicles and 22 boats were seized.
   The P3 detection platforms will eventually fly mostly ``defense
in depth'' missions, according to Customs officials.
   A concept already tested at least four times successfully,
Customs aircraft would fly long hours off the coast of producer
countries such as Colombia and observe virtually every air departure
from a known drug region. This would make it far easier to sort
suspicious from legitimate aircraft, one of the most difficult jobs
now facing the surveillance unit.
   In the first such endurance test off Colombia, the detection rate
was regarded as phenomenal, and the deterrent was so strong that
smugglers stopped flying once they realized something was amiss.
   ``The best hunting I've had,'' one radar operator said of the
three Customs Service and one Coast Guard aircraft that flew in
shifts for 16 hours a day.
   Adams, the surveillance unit air branch chief, said that without
such operations, the surveillance unit is reduced to playing ``a
chess game'' in the air.
   ``It's really hard to be in the right place at the right time,''
said radar operator Buck Benham, as he scanned the skies on his
radar scope in one of the four P3 trackers without the sophisticated
dome.
   Instead of chasing airborne suspects, Benham was trying to take
over the dome plane's detection job, which he likened to ``flying
around with a flashlight.''
   Customs can count on little help from countries south of the
border. Only two countries provide timely assistance, according to
aircrews: the Dominican Republic, which will launch a military
aircraft on request, and the Bahamas, which places officers on
U.S.-flown helicopters.
   Crewmen said it is difficult to gain cooperation from Mexico.
Calls for assistance in chasing boats and planes have to be routed
through the federal government in Washington, and the process can
take four hours. In that time, smugglers often dump their loads or
land south of the border.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ The future is, for better or worse, unknowable,
but that's never prevented enthusiastic prophets, soothsayers and
prognosticators from trying to divine its shape _ particularly when
a new year arrives that's only a short jump from a new millennium.
Here's a report on forecasts offered now and in the past, some odd,
some ominous, some benign, and all of them engrossing.

   Think of the years as numbers changing in a speedometer and we
can begin the countdown now.
   Yesterday, the last day of 1988, flipped over to 1989 today and
the last march of the nines began. Next year, a nine will move over,
be replaced by a zero and the total will read 1990.
   And before we know it, in the steadily rising speed of subjective
time, there will be three nines and then the days will roll up and
out and the weeks will roll up and out and the months will roll up
and out and finally, in a single moment of breathless magic, a zero
will come up for the year, another zero for the decade, a third zero
for the century and, with one to carry, to be carried oh so
carefully, we will have a whole new millennium in the life of
humankind.
   There, in the big roll of nines and zeros, will come the ultimate
for lovers of symmetrical milestones: the first day of a new year, a
new decade, a new century, a new millennium. It is a calendar
combination prophets and prognosticators can't resist. They are
already busy.
   In their latest crystal balls, they see a century in which the
deaf will hear and the lame will walk; most Americans will be
descended from non-Europeans; more than four million new jobs will
have to be found for people replaced by robots that never tire, eat,
get paid or join unions.
   They see a time when the life span will be stretched to 150 years
and the divorce rate will zoom because who can look at the same
husband for more than 100 years? A time when computer networks will
match a liver donor in Duluth with a patient in Dusseldorf. When
businessmen conferring by television continents apart will be able
to see each other, talk, sell, argue, exchange contracts and baby
pictures. When cars will be fully computerized and, after centuries
of frustration by horse, camel and raft, a man finally will be able
to answer the eternal question, ``Daddy, when will we be there?''
   A time of scary scientific discovery, especially in genetic
engineering, when society will have to deal with the questions of
whether man is ready to play God and is God ready to let him.
   Who will prevail among the soothsayers, the prophets of a bright
new world or the seers of doom and gloom? In that trade, history
indicates that the optimists and the pessimists run about
neck-and-neck.
   So far, the meek have not inherited the earth. But neither has
Big Brother. The year 1984 came and went without ``1984,'' the grim
scenario of an ultra-totalitarian state by George Orwell. Freedom
stirs in China. Mikhail Gorbachev sits in Stalin's office in Moscow.
   The world has not exploded in a nuclear Armageddon, and the
planet is alive, if not well. The 20th century has improved the
health of humans more than all the previous centuries combined, but
it has not been kind to the planet. Unlike all the centuries that
passed before, the 21st will inherit tons of man-made nuclear wastes
which will remain dangerously radioactive for 280,000 years.
   A hundred years ago, the prophets were predicting that technology
would cure most of society's ills. Now they're wondering how society
will survive technology.
   In the hot summer of 1988, the experts warned that a severe
``greenhouse effect'' may be awaiting us in the next century, that
carbon dioxide reaching the atmosphere from the vast burning of oil
and coal below could heat the earth, melt glaciers, raise sea
levels, parch the middle of the globe and produce bumper crops in
Canada and Siberia.
   In the same hot summer of 1988, Ronald Reagan and Mikhail
Gorbachev told us in Moscow that their two governments and others
would try to plan cooperatively for changes in climate. Could it
come to pass that the Cold War may one day end because the
superpowers will fear the changing earth more than each other?
   No area of human prophecy has produced worse batting averages
than the question of war or peace. The most recent to step up to the
plate was Edward C. Aldridge, Air Force secretary. Unveiling the new
stealth bomber, he predicted, ``We are ushering in a new age of
strategic deterrence.''
   About 200 years ago, Thomas Jefferson thought that submarines,
when invented, would prove so devastating they would prevent wars.
Victor Hugo, in 1842, predicted balloons would end war. So, by turn,
would the machine gun, the tank, the airplane and the atom bomb.
   Humans will live very differently but human nature is likely to
remain, as it has since the cave man, unchanged and ``unevolving,''
notes Timothy Willard, editor of The Futurist Magazine. ``Human
ability to solve problems has improved but human ingenuity will
continue to embrace both the constructive and destructive.''

   Willard and others preoccupied with the future think that small
wars are more likely than big wars in the next century. They think
that terrorists from the countless ranks of the have-nots are more
apt to create world tension than the major powers; that hunger is
more likely to bring war than ideology.
   For most other people, bursting technology will provide a new
world in the new century. According to Marvin Cetron, Arthur C.
Clarke, John Diebold, Isaac Asimov and other diviners of the future
in fact and fiction, we may expect...
   Homes and places of work will be computerized, robotized and, if
we're not careful, completely homogenized. Automated housekeepers
will heat, cool, ventilate, dust, vacuum, wash and take out the
garbage at the press of a button or voice command. Mood makers will
provide music, wind noises, thunder cracks and filmed images on the
wall of a crackling fire, falling snow or pelting rain.
   Appliances will hear and, unless choked, talk. At the moment,
though, in this century, talking machines are not selling. Buyer
resistance.
   ``My husband talks back to me,'' said one shopper. ``My kids talk
back to me. I don't want my dryer talking back to me.''
   Designers, however, are not giving up. They think the next
generation of consumers, now growing up with talking computers in
school, will be less intimidated by babbling machines.
   With small high-speed computers for brains, with TV cameras for
eyes, hydraulic manipulators for arms and grippers for hands, robots
will take over much of the heavy, dangerous or dull work now
performed by men and women. They already hobnob with radioactive
reactors, visit the bottoms of deep mine shafts, explore ocean
bottoms and defuse explosives.
   Homo mechanicus also paints, welds, grinds, mills, cuts, runs a
lathe and drill press, works on appliances, autos and planes without
a coffee break, says Cetron. A robot now in the works will be able
to return wrenches scattered on a workbench to a rack on the wall.
   Japan now leads the world in the production of robots. One of the
latest from Nippon is called King Kong. lt picks up a hospital
patient, places him or her in the bathtub and then returns him-her
to bed freshly bathed.
   It is hard to picture more national change than our century
produced. Nations rose and fell, disappeared and reappeared. Empires
and ideologies spread and shrank.
   But change there will be. By 2100, the population of the world is
expected to double from 4.9 billion to 10.4 billion. The poorest
nations will have the most people, in Africa, Asia and Latin
America, and the richest will have a hard time enjoying their dinner.
   The developed countries will drop from a quarter to a seventh
share of the world population. The United States will drop from
fourth to seventh in population rank, behind India, China, Nigeria,
the Soviet Union, Indonesia and Pakistan. The U.S. share of
something called the gross world product will drop from 22 percent
to 10 percent but, at that, the United States and Japan will have
the largest slices.
   Following cheaper labor, not the sun, the Hong Kong shirt-maker,
who took business away from the United States and Europe, will lose
it to the Mexicans and Thais, who will then lose it to the
Bangladeshi and Egyptians. So says Marvin Cetron.
   Economically, the center of gravity of ``Western civilization''
will shift from the United States and Europe to the United States
and the Pacific. U.S. trade with Asia will double that with Europe.
Stripped of empire, Europe's share of world commerce has already
shrunk to a fraction of what it was in 1900.
   In the quickening march of medicine and science, we are told, the
blind will see better, paraplegics will step from their wheelchairs,
new drugs will dissolve blood clots, and prevent or reduce heart
disease, ulcers, cholesterol buildup, hardening of the arteries,
hepatitis and some forms of cancer.
   Human tissue ``farms'' will provide everything from single cells
to lungs and hearts, and transplants will become as common as
tonsillectomies. Unless stopped, gene tinkerers will slow down the
aging process and make possible blond, blue-eyed babies on demand.
   ln that brave new world, with controlled drugs and hormonal
manipulation, basketball players will be 6 inches taller and baskets
will have to be raised; baseball pitchers will throw harder, batters
will hit longer and outfield fences will have to be moved back,
maybe as much as 100 feet.

   Arthur Clarke also predicts a new kind of pit stops for tiring
athletes during a game. Like mechanics swarming over a racing car,
trainers will swarm over the tired performer, test his blood, inject
the nutrients running low and send him back, refueled, to the fray.
   Humanity will travel fastest in the spaceships of the next
century but there is a reasonable chance it will travel farthest by
a different route, learning. Anyone with a home computer terminal
may be linked through computer networks to the wisdom of the ages,
to the great libraries and universities of the world. Students
hemispheres apart could listen to and question a lecturer in Oxford,
England. A ghetto high school in Harlem could be wired into the same
gathered knowledge enriching Groton.
   Togetherness will be strained to its outer limits. Four
generations alive at the same time in the same family will be
common. Within a family, computers and cable TV will make it
unneccesary to leave home to work, go to school, church, take in a
movie or concert, shop, reserve an airline ticket, place an
off-track bet or do any number of things together at the risk of
claustrophobia or fratricide.
   By or in the next century, it is expected that spacecraft from
Earth will have visited every planet except the distant Pluto; the
United States will build a permanent base on the moon; space
stations will be transmitting solar energy to Earth.
   There are also those who predict that robotized space factories
could be run from Earth with only occasional visits by human
technicians. Others consider the ultimate solution to prison
overcrowding: sentence them to jails in space. Some think there will
be human migrations of religious groups seeking a war-free society
and another Plymouth Rock out there.
   And least charming was the notion projected by the movie, ``Blade
Runner,'' in which all the earth becomes a miserable ghetto after a
nuclear war. The rich flee to the suburbs of space. Earth is left to
the poor.
   So far neither American nor Soviet space ships have found any
sign of life out there. Certainly not a trace of ``Ming, the
Merciless'' or other sinister folks Buck Rogers and Captain Video
used to battle, when we were young, with opticon scillometers and
cosmic ray vibrators not yet invented.
   Huge audiences were invited to ``live a million could-be years
over a thousand maybe worlds.'' Then and now, writers of fiction
could not be discounted in the march of prophecy. Edgar Allan Poe
wrote about crossing the Atlantic in a balloon 134 years before one
did; Edward Everett Hale, about an orbiting satellite 88 years
before sputnik; Jules Verne, about a man on the moon 100 years
before Neil Armstrong.
   Others did less well. In 1894, an obscure socialist named King
Camp Gillette wrote about a utopia in which most of the people of
North America lived in 40,000 cooperative skyscrapers near Niagara
Falls. Ultimately, Gillette did better as a capitalist by inventing
the safety razor.
   Sunday supplements bulged with cities of the future _ towering
buildings, bright and widely spaced, helicopters flitting between
them, separate serene streets for vehicles and pedestrians, traffic
moving in a majestic flow, industry sharply zoned, cities ringed by
a rich greenbelt of bucolic farms and parks.
   Among the designs that never got off the drawing board were
amphibious battleships, flying tanks and troop carriers that would
tunnel through mountains; a Ford Thunderbird to be called the
``Nucleon'' and powered by a nuclear reactor in the trunk; an
airliner that would carry 20 engines, six ``in reserve,'' 451
passengers, a crew of 155, including a librarian, gymnast, two
maitres d', two masseuses, two wine stewards, seven musicians and
nine bar stewards.
   H.G. Wells thought World War I was the last war; Herbert Hoover
thought the Depression was over in 1930; Louis B. Mayer was told,
``no Civil War picture ever made a nickel'' and thus passed up
``Gone with the Wind''; Congress considered closing the Patent
Office in 1900 because everything the country needed had already
been invented.
   Closing out the 19th century, The New York Times said the future
of democracy appeared bright and, with the fall of Napoleon, the
world appeared safe from dictators.
   On that New Year's Day, the Times exulted on the front page.
``The Century is dead; long live the Century!'' One wonders, with
awe, if a new century made one exclamation mark fit to print, what
will a whole new millennium bring?

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ The island of Madagascar split from the African
mainland more than 150 million years ago and went on its own
evolutionary course. But the island's many animals and plants which
are found no place else in the world are now threatened with
extinction by the encroachment of man. As smoke continues to rise
from the dwindling forests, environmental groups are digging in to
do battle.

<TEXT>
   This island off the East African coast
is to today's naturalists what the Galapagos Islands off South
America were to Charles Darwin, a study in evolution.
   But the island's unique and diverse plant and animal life is
under grave threat as man continues to torch the forest to clear the
land in what one newspaper calls a kind of ``national pyromania.''
   As a result, heading off the destruction of Madagascar's fragile
habitat has become the premier goal of many international
environmental groups.
   After Madagascar split from the African mainland more than 150
million years ago, its plants and animals went on their own
evolutionary course.
   Some became extinct, like the pygmy hippopotamus, elephant bird
and giant lemurs.
   ``There was a tremendous explosion of different forms from very,
very few ancestors,'' says Dr. Martin Nicoll, a zoologist who
represents the World Wildlife Fund here. ``Madagascar lets you look
at the limits of adaptability.
   ``You can make really nice biological comparisons. What do plants
have to do, for example, to live in a desert?''
   Madagascar's terrain ranges from rain forests to prairie to
desert.
   Ninety percent of the plant and animal species on the
226,658-square mile island are found nowhere else: from the lovable
lemurs to hundreds of species of orchids and more than 350 species
of amphibians and reptiles.
   There are 29 species of lemurs, primates whose name comes from
the Latin word for ghosts because of their largely nocturnal habits.
The closest living descendants of the common ancestor of humans,
monkeys and apes, lemurs were displaced by monkeys elsewhere in the
world. Here they had a chance to survive in isolation.
   Madagascar's equivalent of the woodpecker is a lemur called an
aye-aye. It detects insect larvae moving in decaying trees with its
sharp ears and then uses a skinny middle finger to reach in and pull
them out.
   The largest lemur is the indri, a black-and-white creature that
weighs about 15 pounds at adulthood and can leap 20 feet from
treetop to treetop.
   The indris, whose haunting calls are reminiscent of sounds
emitted by great whales, are the main attraction for the small but
growing number of tourists who visit this small reserve about 60
miles east of the capital of Antananarivo.
   A short walk through a rain forest, led by a guide, inevitably
turns up a family of the indris, staring down with their Teddy
Bear-like faces, bemused but not much interested in their visitors.
   The humans, whose slash-and-burn agricultural methods now
threaten wildlife and the nation's watershed, are late arrivals,
coming from Africa and the Malay Archipelago only 1,500 years ago.
Fourteen species of lemurs have become extinct since humans arrived,
and ecologists fear others are in danger of joining them.
   The island's population has more than doubled since 1950, and now
exceeds 11 million. Farmers are so desperate for land they are
felling trees on 70-degree slopes. Four-fifths of the island's land
is barren, and its forests have been reduced by half in the past
three decades.
   The government's agriculture department long encouraged farmers
to cut trees and burn the stumps to clear the ground for cash crops.
The savanna is burned to produce tender shoots for an estimated 10
million zebu cattle.
   ``In the West and in the East, not far from the capital, the
fires continue to burn,'' says U.S. Ambassador Patricia Gates Lynch.
``Sometimes you see the smoke trapped right here in the city.''
   The government and environmental organizations are working
together now to discourage slash-and-burn land clearing, though the
education process is slow.
   ``It's primarily a human problem,'' says Prime Minister Victor
Ramahatra. ``We must teach people that the natural environment is
their principal source of wealth.''

<HEAD>PERINET, Madagascar: of wealth.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The government has shifted course from the policies adopted in a
1975 socialist revolution and now follows the advice of Western
donors on economic policy. But a U.S. embassy economic report says
no economic reforms will work in the long run ``without corrective
action against Madagascar's single greatest self-inflicted problem:
the destruction of its environment.''
   The government also has broken out of the virtual self-imposed
isolation since President Didier Ratsiraka came to power in 1975.
   Nicoll says the government has cooperated with environmental
groups since the end of 1985. ``It is our No. 1 conservation
priority,'' he says.
   A recent issue of the daily newspaper Midi said an average of 3.7
million acres of land was being burned each year. Midi, an
independent journal, likened the the burning to ``national
pyromania.''
   Some peasants reportedly continue to burn the land to show their
displeasure with the steady decline in the nation's economy since
the revolution. Per capita income declined 24 percent between 1979
and 1983.
   The denuded hillsides are no match for heavy rains and occasional
cyclones. Great holes are carved in the landscape by erosion. The
Indian Ocean north of the island is red from the red clay soil
washed out to sea.
   The World Bank is organizing an international effort to halt the
degradation, which it estimates will cost from $300 million to $400
million over the next 15 to 20 years.
   Already 11 major projects aided by Western environmental groups,
universities and governments are under way. They include efforts to
save existing reserves and plans to create new reserves or national
parks.
   Nicoll, whose WWF is managing projects covering 10 reserves, says
efforts have to take into consideration the needs of the people who
live nearby.
   ``The people don't want to cut down the forest just because it's
there,'' says Yale University anthropologist Elearnor Sterling, who
is studying the aye-aye. ``They truly need the wood for firewood or
for land for agriculture. Many of them understand the problems in
the environment and would like to do something to help but they have
to feed their children.''
   Nicoll says the success of the Perinet reserve proves people can
be persuaded to change.
   ``I was there in 1985, during my first long-term stay in
Madagascar,'' he says. ``When you'd go into the reserve you'd meet
people walking along with an ax. Just about every day you'd hear the
chop, chop of an ax. You never hear that now. Tourism has done that.
Tourism has put that place into a sort of protected status. Nobody
would dare go in there now with an ax.''
   Western organizations are pushing tourism, which up to now only
brings a few thousand people to the island, many of them bird
watchers or naturalists.
   Ambassador Lynch, whose government is a major backer of
conservation projects, says, ``I think we're on the right track but
time is passing very quickly and the forests are burning fast.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ He was deformed at birth and when he was 2 his
legs were amputated up to the pelvis. But Kenny Easterday, 15,
thumbs his nose at his handicap and ignores the stares of strangers,
preferring to walk on his hands rather than ride in a wheelchair.
His spunk inspired a French-Canadian filmmaker to make a movie about
his life, called ``Kid Brother.''

   Fifteen-year-old Kenny Easterday knows the
sight of a 2-foot-tall boy with half a body walking on his hands or
zooming down the street on a skateboard causes heads to turn.
   Kenny's been stared at for so long, friends say he gets perturbed
if people fail to notice him.
   It's part of his cockiness, part of what has helped him to
survive.
   Kenny calls it his ``style,'' a tough, spunky veneer to protect
the kid inside him who has been poked, prodded, inspected and
rejected all his life. He insists _ by example more than words _
that he's no different from any other teen-age boy.
   ``I like torn-up shirts, jean jackets with holes in them, long
hair, earrings and hard-rock music _ and getting in trouble,'' he
says, his straight brown hair hanging limply over the collar of his
denim jacket.
   Kenny walks on long, calloused hands instead of using a
wheelchair, as if to prove he can be faster and tougher than people
without disabilities. He refuses to wear a prosthesis, insisting it
hampers his mobility while only serving to make his appearance more
acceptable to the public.
   Kenny was born Dec. 7, 1973, with mangled legs and sacral
agenesis, a disease that left a gap between the upper part of his
body and pelvis and legs.
   His backbone, incomplete at birth, was re-formed in an operation
when he was 6 months old. Before he was 2, his legs were amputated
up to his pelvis, reducing him to a height of about 2 feet.
   Despite appearances, there is little Kenny can't do, or at least
doesn't think he can do.
   He almost purposefully ignores questions focusing on the handicap
but quickly answers those generic to teen-agers.
   Ask him, for instance, about the two rhinestones in his left ear,
and he'll proudly boast about how he pierced his ears himself.
   Ask him what kind of music he likes, and he'll proffer a host of
rap and hard-rock groups. ``I like Motley Crue, AC-DC, Black
Sabbath, Bon Jovi, Def Leppard, Led Zeppelin ...'' and the list goes
on.
   Ask him what he wants to be when he gets older.
   ``I'd like to be a music teacher, or I might be a gym teacher, or
president of the United States,'' he says, laughing like he's being
tickled.
   ``He switches it all the time,'' taunts his 17-year-old brother,
Eddie. ``First he wanted to be a lawyer, then he wanted to be a
doctor.''
   ``I might be all these things, Eddie,'' Kenny retorts.
   It is that spirit that inspired French-Canadian filmmaker Claude
Gagnon to make a movie about Kenny.
   ``From the first moment I met him, I knew I wanted to make the
film with him,'' says Claude Gagnon, director of the movie, ``Kid
Brother,'' which premiered in November in Pittsburgh.
   ``I really wanted to be close to that kid and work with him. He
can fool around and be childish, but he's got a very serious side to
his personality.
   ``I think the thing that helped Kenny the most is that his family
never tried to overprotect him. When Kenny is around I never think
of things he can't do.''
   As an example of Kenny's ability, the director mentions a scene
in the movie in which Kenny swings with amazing agility from
playground monkey bars.
   ``Kenny can do so many things I'll never be able to do in my
life, and he knows it,'' Gagnon says. ``He's very proud of it. He
wants to show the world, `Here I am. Here's what I can do. Can you
do it?'''
   Gagnon says Kenny's mother, Sharon, didn't object to the film as
long as the family was portrayed accurately _ ``not everything in
pink and beautiful.''
   That's because Kenny's life hasn't been neat and pretty.
   Kenny grew up in a second floor apartment over a storefront _
with no elevator _ in nearby West Aliquippa, a rough, Ohio River
steel town shadowed by the 7-mile-long LTV Steel Corp. plant.
   His father, Jesse, is an unemployed maintenance worker who does
odd jobs, and his mother works evenings at a geriatric convalescent
center.
   His sister, Sharon, 20, hasn't lived at home for many years and
the two aren't on speaking terms, while Eddie grew up resenting
Kenny for not being a ``normal'' brother.
   In the midst of this have come a herd of reporters and
photographers to document Kenny's life. His parents usually decline
to talk to reporters.
   Reporters can be rude when they don't like what they hear, Kenny
says.
   During an interview in October in Seoul, South Korea, where Kenny
carried the torch for the International Paralympics, ``this reporter
got mad and walked out when we told him we don't go to church,'' he
says.
   Over the years Kenny has gotten accustomed to rudeness and
staring.
   ``He knows he surprises people and he's not scared by that
fact,'' Gagnon says. ``He tries to get the best out of it.''
   Prior to the movie and publicity about Kenny, however, ``people
would see him in the street and either cross or run away,'' the
director says.
   ``Today they ask to kiss him or shake his hand. All of a sudden,
they appreciate him. He's finally getting a lot of the love and
tenderness he deserves.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ They established their organic farm four decades
ago, shunning pesticides and chemical fertilizers at a time when
agriculture was rushing pell-mell in the opposite direction. But
Paul Keene and his late wife, Betty, held to their convictions and
today their chemical-free food products have found markets around
the world.

   The seed of the idea was planted in 1939
when Paul Keene, a young missionary to India, met Mohandas Gandhi.
   It eventually grew into Walnut Acres Farm, an oasis of natural
food in a fast-food world, a place frequented by people such as
naturalist Euell Gibbons, who lived 10 miles away until he died in
1975.
   The organic farm, one of the oldest in the country, has blossomed
into a $5 million-a-year business in the four decades since Keene
and his wife, Betty, put down roots in central Pennsylvania and
began tending the land without pesticides or other man-made
chemicals.
   ``You don't see the birds that are going to steal your grain from
you,'' Keene says. ``They need food, too.''
   The 108-acre farm the Keenes bought in 1946 is now nearly five
times that large and yields about 300 organic products that are sold
worldwide. The top sellers include preservative-free peanut butter,
granolas and other sugarless cereals, and freshly ground,
whole-grain flours.
   The basic tenet at Walnut Acres, according to Keene, is that
``food should be _ is _ the most important thing in life and one
should be more concerned about what one eats than anything else.''
   ``All joys and all outreach can only be appreciated if you're
healthy and don't have to worry about your insides and your
outsides,'' adds Keene, 78.
   George DeVault, editor and publisher of The New Farm, a magazine
published by the Regenerative Agriculture Association, acknowledges
Walnut Acres is a pioneer in organic farming.
   ``I think that in the very near future, that's going to be the
conventional way of farming,'' DeVault says. ``The present
chemical-intensive system we have now is not sustainable _ the
economics, the environment, the health concerns, the residue...
   ``People like Paul Keene have helped pave the way for a healthier
future for all of us.''
   Keene's desire to enrich the earth and its people was nourished
by Gandhi, whom he met nearly 50 years ago in British-ruled India.
Keene, the Yale-educated son of a minister, had gone there the year
before as a missionary.
   ``I said to him, `I'm teaching mathematics in a school in
America. I'm here and I'm learning a lot about India and I'm not
satisfied with this work I'm doing. What would you suggest?'
   ``He said, `Well, I can't advise you on the details. But the
first thing you should do when you get back is give away everything
you have.'''
   An inspired Keene returned to the United States in 1940 with his
wife, a British missionary's daughter, and taught one more year at
New Jersey's Drew University before quitting.
   The couple spent the next several years at organic farming
schools that stressed the need to ``go back to the soil.'' In 1946,
they borrowed $5,000 to buy their Penns Creek farm, 55 miles north
of Harrisburg.
   They worked the land without electricity, tractors or insurance.
They also refused to spray their crops and soil, a criterion in the
fledgling field of organic farming.
   Within a few years, Walnut Acres, the business, was born.
   ``We immediately said, `Well, it's not right that we own this
whole business and get all the profits,''' Keene says. ``So we gave
the business away.''
   The private, employee-owned business now encompasses 500 acres,
free of synthetic chemicals and tilled by modern methods, and a
full-time staff of 95. Mail-order business has grown 17 percent in
the past year alone, according to Bob Anderson, 43, Keene's
son-in-law and the company's vice president and general manager.
   As business flourishes, so does Walnut Acres' philanthropy.
   About $7,000 to $8,000 in donations from customers and employees
will be funneled this year into a community center in tiny Penns
Creek, built and run by Walnut Acres Foundation Inc., a non-profit
offshoot.
   Another $8,000 will go to a home and school for orphaned and
unwanted children in India that was ``adopted'' by the foundation 12
years ago. Last year, $33,500 was raised for an all-purpose building
at the school in memory of Betty Keene, who died in May 1987 at age
74.
   The lean, robust Keene uses his ``Greetings from the Farm''
essays in Walnut Acres' bimonthly catalog to muse over farming,
nature ``and the oneness of all life.'' Fifty-nine of his essays,
written over the past 30 years, were released by The Globe Pequot
Press in late November in a book entitled ``Fear Not To Sow Because
of the Birds.''
   Anderson says people are becoming more interested in diet and
nutrition, in part because of Surgeon General C. Everett Koop's
warnings about high cholesterol, smoking and obesity. ``Going
together with this has been a little bit more interest in gourmet
foods, and gourmet cooks start looking for purer ingredients,'' he
says.
   ``We're leaders in the field in letting people understand what
healthy eating is and what it means,'' says his wife, Ruth Keene
Anderson, 43, secretary and treasurer for Walnut Acres.
   Although exact figures are not available, experts say organic
farms account for 1 percent to 5 percent of the nation's farms. The
definition of organic varies from state to state, however, and the
ensuing confusion has prompted some to call for federal standards.
   The U.S. Department of Agriculture in 1980 defined organic
farming as a production system that avoids or largely excludes the
use of synthetic fertilizers, pesticides, growth regulators and
livestock feed additives. Organic farms rely on crop rotation, crop
residues, animal manure and mechanical cultivation.
   ``There is a need for greater uniformity,'' says Patrick Madden,
professor of agricultural economics at Pennsylvania State University.
   Vegetables, grain and other crops native to Pennsylvania are
grown at Walnut Acres. Rice, nuts, dried fruits and other
non-indigenous products are furnished by organic farms elsewhere
that meet Walnut Acres' standards.
   Chickens and Holstein cattle are raised naturally on neighboring
farms, with access to the outdoors, pesticide-free feed and no
growth stimulants. The meat is used for soups, stews and sauces.
   Walnut Acres products are sold at a store on the premises and in
health food shops around the country, as well as through the mail.
The items are by no means cheap. Peanut butter costs $3.29 a pound,
for example, while a 16-ounce can of chicken gumbo soup retails for
$2.75.
   Emma Mattern, 57, a 29-year employee who's now marketing manager,
tells workers not to pack or ship anything they wouldn't put in
their own pantry.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ When she won a national competition for young
musicians in her native Germany at age 7, the government allowed her
to drop out of regular school and be tutored at home so she could
spend more time practicing the violin. Today, at age 25, Anne-Sophie
Mutter is more than a child prodigy. She's an international star in
classical music.

   In her strapless Dior gown with a Stradivarius
tucked under her chin, Anne-Sophie Mutter is the glamour girl among
today's young classical violinists.
   The German-born musician is in the fast lane, zipping around in a
Porsche 911 convertible at up to 100 mph-plus on the Autobahn,
vacationing in her apartment in Monte Carlo. A fan club always
greets her in Japan.
   But aside from fashion, there is a practical reason for the
strapless Dior.
   ``I discovered the violin sounds much better on bare skin and it
is not so slippery,'' she says.
   The 25-year-old Miss Mutter indeed is serious about her music,
and she has the ear of serious musicians, such as Herbert von
Karajan, music director of the Berlin Philharmonic, and Mstislav
Rostropovich, cellist and music director of the National Symphony in
Washington, D.C.
   ``Miss Mutter's gifts include a consummate control of her
instrument, gleaming intonation, ripe sound and an assured,
nerveless stage demeanor,'' wrote Time magazine.
   Last spring, Miss Mutter made her sixth concert tour of the
United States, performing with major orchestras. In December, she
made her first American recital tour, playing solo in 12 cities, all
of the 14 appearances sold out.
   In January she will marry a fellow German, Detlef Wunderlich, a
lawyer. After the honeymoon, she will resume her schedule of 120
concerts a year.
   Miss Mutter started violin lessons at age 6. She won a national
competition for 6- to 24-year-old musicians at age 7 and the German
government gave permission for her to drop out of regular school and
be tutored at home in Wehr, near the southern tip of the Black
Forest. While she did play with her two older brothers and other
children, most of her time was spent with the violin.
   ``I just loved to play the violin and I wanted to play well
because I liked the sound,'' she recalls. ``So I practiced. I grew
up with music as something very precious and something very pure.
   ``My father took care I did not have a child prodigy career. What
can you decide yourself at the age of 6, 8 or 13?''
   Today she has an agent in each country and her father, a
newspaper publisher, coordinates them. Like most classical
musicians, she won't divulge her income.
   Miss Mutter only played a few concerts a year until she started
performing with Karajan.
   After that, she says, ``I didn't have to play with bad orchestras
or audition for each conductor or go through competitions.''
   She had her first personal contact with Karajan in 1976 at age 13
after she performed at an international music festival in Lucerne,
Switzerland. Karajan heard about it and invited her to audition.
   ``I didn't want to go,'' she recalls. ``For such a genius, what
could I do? I pursuaded my parents to postpone. We went on a holiday
to Spain.
   ``In December I flew to Berlin with my father and teacher. Both
were really nervous. I was not nervous. I understood there was not
the slightest bit of hope. Because I had nothing to lose, that is
why I survived this moment.
   She played a Bach ``Chaconne'' and afterward Karajan told her,
``I will be happy to play with you next year in Salzburg.''
   Miss Mutter made her first recording at 15, with Karajan, playing
a Mozart concerto in one take.
   She made four recordings in 1988 for release early in 1989,
including Tchaikovsky's ``Concerto for Violin and Orchestra in D
major,'' with Karajan and the Vienna Philharmonic and Witold
Lutoslawksi's ``Chain 2'' and ``Partita,'' the latter dedicated to
her by Lutoslawski.
   For the past three years Miss Mutter has been playing a 1710 Lord
Dunraven Strad. ``I like the sound,'' she says, ``very silvery and
quick responding, very good projecting.''
   Four years ago, she says with a twinkle, ``I made a very good
step. My parents were against my driving a sports car, saying,
`Don't risk your life.' I decided I will ask Maestro Karajan in
front of my father. He said it was a great idea.''
   Karajan helped her select and order the white 911 Porsche, with
its red leather interior and black convertible top.
   Since 1985, Miss Mutter has played chamber music with
Rostropovich and violist Bruno Giuranna.
   ``Shortly after I made my debut in Washington eight years ago,
with Rostropovich conducting, he said he wanted to return to chamber
music,'' she says. ``He had stopped playing with a string trio 30
years ago.
   ``We've played everywhere in Europe. It was a dream, to play this
repertory, apart from playing it with the greatest cellist and
greatest viola player. You can imagine what a lesson each concert
is. Every phrase you hear from both of them pushes you forward.''
   Krzystof Penderecki is composing a concerto for the
Mutter-Guiranna-Rostropovich Trio.
   The strapless stage dresses didn't begin as a trademark, Miss
Mutter says. She started needing gowns at 14, to perform with
Karajan in Salzburg. But where, at that age, would she find them?
She tried bridemaid's dresses, but found that the sleeves got in the
way. So she bought peasant blouses with elastic necklines so she
could pull the sleeves down on her arms.
   ``I only was looking for comfort. My neck is short, which is
perfect for violin playing without support under the instrument.
   ``One day I felt grown up enough to buy real dresses, not this
child stuff.''
   So she went to Paris and immediately found two dresses she liked
at Chanel.
   ``After I discovered how comfortable it is to have dresses made
for you _ everything fits _ I couldn't go back to a compromise.
   ``After I got a taste of it, I went to Dior. I prefer Dior, much
more simple. I have shoes made in different colors like the dress,
always the same style.''
   For her performances with the trio, Dior designers fashioned a
woman's tuxedo. ``I want to look as my partners look,'' she says.
``I needed different sleeves and a lot of volume in the back of the
jacket. We worked on that outfit for days.
   ``It's comfortable but you can't compare it to the liberty you
have in a dress. And it's so hot.''

   It seems like such a short time ago that
Hayley Mills, snub-nosed, towheaded and blue-eyed, was spreading
good cheer in a half-dozen pictures for Walt Disney.
   Her first movie, ``Pollyanna,'' at the age of 14, brought her a
special Oscar in 1960. Next came ``The Parent Trap,'' ``That Darn
Cat!,'' ``The Moonspinners,'' ``Summer Magic'' and ``In Search of
The Castaways.''
   Even as an adult it was difficult for her to stay away from
Disney. Her films appeared frequently on the Disney Channel and she
got more mail than any other star.
   She had left the Disney studio at 19, but two years ago she
returned for ``Parent Trap II'' for the Disney Channel.
   Now 41 and the mother of two teen-age sons attending school in
England, Mills is back on the Disney Channel. She stars as a junior
high school teacher in a new comedy series, ``Good Morning, Miss
Bliss.'' The show, made by NBC, is the first network production for
a cable channel.
   Mills plays Carrie Bliss, a teacher who dedicates her life to her
classroom. Yet Mills herself never had a special teacher when she
was growing up. Before coming to Los Angeles she attended boarding
schools in England. After that, she went to school on the movie set.
   ``I went to so many different schools I never had a normal
education,'' she says. ``When I worked at Disney I had three hours
of schooling a day. I usually did it 20 minutes here, 15 minutes
there, just to collect time. I'd march off to the little red school
house to listen to some incomprehensible lecture on Mesopotamia
while they were lighting the next shot.''
   Each half-hour episode of the new series focuses on the
classroom, although some scenes may take place at her home.
   ``I only have 16 kids in my class, but I appreciate what real
teachers have to cope with,'' Mills says. ``When you do a scene over
and over again in rehearsal there's no surprise left. It becomes
difficult to control the kids. They also have to spend four hours a
day in real school.''
   Her character, she says, is ``a very inventive teacher. She's
very committed to her profession. She always wanted to be a teacher
and she has great enthusiasm. She really relates to the kids as
individuals. She's the kind of teacher who believes fervently in the
vital importance of her role in their lives.''
   Mills says she has modeled her character on Christa McAuliffe,
the teacher killed aboard the shuttle Challenger. ``She was that
kind of inspirational teacher,'' she says.
   Dennis Haskins plays the principal, Richard Belding, who insists
the school and its classes be run exactly by the rules.
   ``Miss Bliss wants to open up the world to the children and give
them a sense of reality about history rather than just memorizing
dates,'' Mills says. ``Which brings her into conflict with the
principal, who runs the school in a very conventional way with every
guideline being the right and tested way.''
   Mills had to swap her home outside of London for an apartment in
Hollywood Hills to work on the series. ``One of the joys of working
in California is that every morning you can look out and see the
mist rise,'' she says. ``I'm up high enough that I can look down on
the city. Early in the morning the tall buildings are shrouded in
the mist.''
   In England, she lives in a little village along the Thames River.
Her older son commutes to college in London and the younger is in a
private boarding school.
   Mills has spent much of her time in recent years working in the
theater, but she has done an occasional film. She went to Israel for
``Appointment With Death,'' an Agatha Christie mystery also starring
Peter Ustinov, Lauren Bacall and Carrie Fisher. She worked in the
United States doing episodes of ``Amazing Stories'' and ``Murder,
She Wrote.''
   ``I came here in early 1988 to do the pilot for this show,'' she
says. ``It was a surprise when the producer rang up and said it was
on. I was completely unaware they had been negotiating.''
   Mills also has just had published a book called ``My God,'' which
is a compilation of how different famous people view God and life in
the hereafter. She co-wrote the book with Marcus McLaine, her
live-in companion of the past 4{ years.
   ``It was Marcus' idea and I said, `Let's do it,''' Mills says.
``I've always been very interested in God and religion. Marcus had
studied theology before he became a singer and songwriter. We wrote
to the heads of all the major religions and got a cross-section of
opinions from a lot of well-known people.''

   Richard Greenberg, a genial 30-year-old
playwright, has written a comedy that includes such topics as
yuppies, AIDS and the homeless _ all set against a backdrop of New
York in the late 1980s.
   It's a surprising mixture. Even more surprising, it works.
   The play, ``Eastern Standard,'' arrived on Broadway after a
sold-out run at off-Broadway's Manhattan Theater Club. Its cast
consists mostly of unknown young actors. The exception is Anne
Meara, who plays a foulmouthed bag lady almost redeemed by these
upwardly mobile youngsters.
   ``Almost'' is the key word here because nothing, these baby
boomers learn, is as easy or as black-and-white as it seems.
Stephen, an architect, loves Phoebe, a stockbroker. Drew, an artist,
loves Peter, a television producer. Peter has AIDS. Ellen, a
waitress, wants to help Mae, the bag lady. And Mae dupes them all.
   Ask Greenberg to explain how he put together this unlikely
combination of people and themes, and he launches into an extended
history of the play.
   ```Eastern Standard' was a collection of several different
impulses,'' says the author, relaxing in his agent's apartment.
   The play grew out of Greenberg's last full-length work, ``The
Maderati,'' a stylized farce about the Big Apple's young literary
set. Greenberg thought it would be his farewell to New York as a
playwright.
   ``I'm constantly saying `I'm never writing about New York
again,''' he says. ``But when `The Maderati' didn't quite come off,
I thought, `Well, all right, one more.' And I wanted to write it in
such a way that wasn't so brittle and artificial. I decided that
instead of inventing a world, I'd sort of figure out what the
strains and tensions of the real world were and bring them
together.''
   Putting such topics as AIDS or the homeless in a comedy has
perplexed _ and even angered _ some audiences.
   ``When you have a homeless person and a person with AIDS in a
play and you're funny, it really ruffles some feathers,'' he says.
``I think there's an idea that seriousness is the same thing as
sentimentality and unless you show what a devastating thing AIDS is
and dwell on that, people get very wary.''
   The comedy also has an ambiguity about its characters that can be
unsettling, Greenberg says.
   ``The thing about this play is that every character at one point
seems to be right and at another point seems to be wrong,'' he adds.
``You can really be in a quandary as to what you are supposed to
feel about them. There's a comfort in being told what you are
supposed to think. In `Eastern Standard,' you constantly have to
change your mind.''
   Especially, if most of the characters are yuppies, the one group
America loves to hate the most. Greenberg doesn't even like to use
the word.
   ``I call them the upper class or the upper-middle class now,'' he
says.
   Some critics didn't even think they were worthy of a play.
   ``I felt that some of the people who have launched these attacks
are living exactly the same way and the only thing that separates
them from the people they are attacking is that they are
attacking,'' the playwright says. ``I think there's an element of
hypocrisy in that.''
   Greenberg, who resembles a slightly disheveled preppie, looks and
talks a lot like the people he writes about.
   ``I know a lot of people like those in the play,'' he says, ``but
no character is directly based on anyone I know.''
   Greenberg began working on ``Eastern Standard'' in March 1987,
the day after ``The Maderati'' closed off-Broadway. Writing 20 to 25
pages a day, he had a first draft ready in a few weeks.
   ``I've worked harder on `Eastern Standard' than I've worked on
any other play, although it came very quickly in that first draft,''
Greenberg says. ``The arch, where it started and where it went to,
always has been the same, but the journey there has changed a lot.''
   The journey took the playwright to the Seattle Repertory Theater
where the play had its first full production last spring. Audiences
there were enthusiastic, although local reviews were mixed.
   ``Eastern Standard'' got to Broadway through the persistence of
producer Jessica Levy. It was Levy who first commissioned Greenberg
to write a play specifically for the commercial theater.
   ``I was flabbergasted by the idea that this was a commercial
commission and not for an institutional theater program,'' the
playwright recalls. ``Then I began thinking, `What makes plays
commercial?' and ended up creating the most abstruse, inaccessible,
unproducible thing I'd ever written.''
   He finally gave that play up and then started work on ``Eastern
Standard'' which Levy licensed to Seattle Rep before it came to the
Manhattan Theater Club and then Broadway.
   The playwright springs from the middle class, the split-level
suburbs of Long Island's Nassau County where his father was a movie
theater executive. His education was decidedly upper crust.
Greenberg went to Princeton and then tried the Ph.D. program in
English at Harvard before ending up at the Yale Drama School to
write plays.
   ``When I finally became a playwright, I thought, `Oh, this works.
I like it. This puts things together nicely,''' he recalls with a
smile.
   While in his third year at Yale, Greenberg had two one-act plays
accepted at Ensemble Studio Theater, a tiny but well-respected New
York theater company. One was a big hit.
   ``So I started being employed as a writer, doing TV and film
scripts, right out of school,'' he says. ``I don't know what I
thought I was going to do, but somehow I've managed to support
myself as a writer.''
   It's the writing for TV and films that drains Greenberg primarily
because they involve so much collaboration.
   ``Plays excite me. They wake me up,'' he says, although he's
never thought of himself as a Broadway playwright.
   ``I think for playwrights of my generation, Broadway has never
been a specific goal,'' he says. Greenberg thought he'd write plays
and have them done at small institutional theaters in New York or
beyond and maybe some of them would move off-Broadway.
   ``Now there is all sorts of attention, from all sorts of
directions, maybe because the play is controversial,'' Greenberg
says. ``The only way to have a play that isn't controversial is to
write about nothing. But it's odd having everything so public. The
idea of reveling in all that attention is very weird to me.''

^He Had Many Names, But Just Who Is That Christmas Child?</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Just who was that man whose birthday is
celebrated today?
   That, theologians say, is the main issue in regard to Jesus. Was
he just a man? A prophet? A great teacher? Or something more? Was he
God mirrored in humanity?
   A lot of questions were asked about him while he lived, questions
echoed ever since.
   Classic Christianity concluded he was something of a paradox,
``truly God and truly man.''
   He's certainly not considered all of God. Did it mean that he
manifests God, not in spite of, but because of his being truly,
unreservedly human, while all others fall short of it?
   The mystifying assessment resonates with anomalies and further
questions with which scholars have grappled through the centuries.
   The child, Jesus, took on a variety of names, both at the start
and through his robust, roving adult ministry.
   ``Emanuel,'' meaning ``God with us,'' was an early appellation,
as recorded in Matthew 1:23.
   The Magi from the East referred to him as ``king of the Jews,''
the same title pinned on him at his crucifixion by the Roman
governor Pilate.
   The names themselves weave a fascinating pattern of mystery in
Scripture _``son of God,'' ``son of man,'' ``son of David,''
``savior,'' ``messiah,'' ``the carpenter's son.''
   Opponents called him a ``winebibber,'' a ``friend of sinners''
who ``has a demon.''
   Many other names, peculiar, intriguing, cropped up in his time,
and before it.
   Jewish Scriptures, seen by Christians as referring to him, say in
Isaiah 53 that he was a ``man of sorrows'' by whose ``stripes we are
healed.''
   But Isaiah 9 calls him ``Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God,
Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.''
   The opening of John's gospel calls him the ``Word'' of God, ``the
true light that enlightens every man ... And the Word became flesh
and dwelt among us, full of grace and truth.''
   The missionary apostle Paul in 2nd Corinthians 4 calls him the
``likeness of God,'' a light that ``has shown in our hearts to give
the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of
Christ.''
   John the Baptist called him ``the Lamb of God, who takes away the
sin of the world.''
   When Jesus asked his apostles who they thought he was, one of
them, Peter, exclaimed, ``You are the Christ, the Son of the living
God!''
   He described himself variously in such graphic words as these:
   ``I am the light of the world.''
   ``I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life
for the sheep.''
   ``I am the door; if any one enters by me, he will be saved, and
will go in and out and find pasture.''
   ``I am the vine, you are the branches.''
   ``I am the resurrection and the life.''
   ``I am the way, the truth and the life.''
   The ``Father and I are one,'' he said, totally in accord, yet the
``Father is greater than I,'' but ``is in me and I am in'' him.
   Jesus also puzzlingly described himself as identical with the
poor, the naked, the sick, the hungry and the imprisoned.
   ``Truly, I say to you, as you did it to one of the least of these
my brethren, you did it unto me,'' he says in Matthew 25:40.
   The closing Book of Revelation (Rev. 21:6) pictures him as the
``Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end.''
   The missionary apostle Paul calls him the ``second'' Adam _ the
inception of a new, unflawed and spirit-quickening life within
humanity.
   Paul summmed up the bafflement of it all in 1st Corinthians 13:
   ``For now we see in a mirror dimly, but then face to face. Now I
know in part; then I shall understand fully, even as I have been
fully understood.''

<HEAD>At the Movies: ``Dangerous Liaisons''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Sexual depravity among the French aristocracy was depicted in
Choderlos De Laclos' 1782 novel ``Les Liaisons Dangereuses'' with
such sordid detail that it has been the target of censors ever
since. In recent times it has been converted into a hit play by
Christopher Hampton, who has now written a film version with the
anglicized title of ``Dangerous Liaisons.''
   Directed with zest by Stephen Frears, the movie marks a welcome
return to the traditional storytelling of films, playing dramatic
events against the convincing backdrop of a historical era. Even the
plot is pleasingly old-fashioned: The wrongdoers receive their
comeuppance at the curtain.
   ``Dangerous Liaisons'' ignores the political ferment of late
18th-century France to concentrate on the bedroom games of jaded
aristocrats. The plotters of the intrigue are a pair well-matched in
cool evil. The Marquise de Merteuil (Glenn Close) is brainy but
sex-obsessed, eager to avenge rejection by a former lover. Her aim:
to assure deflowering of his 16-year-old future bride (Uma Thurman).
   The notorious rake, Vicomte de Valmont (John Malkovich), greedily
accepts the challenge, but he decides that the conquest is too easy.
So he also proposes a greater achievement: seducing Madame de
Tourvel (Michelle Pfeiffer), a devout, married woman. Valmont's
prize if he succeeds: a long-postponed night with his co-plotter.
   The scene moves to the country estate of Valmont's indulgent aunt
(Mildred Natwick), where he plots his campaign. Both missions
completed, he is thrown off his game by falling in love with the
saintly de Tourvel. Meanwhile, the Marquise has taken a young lover
(Keanu Reeves). All this intrigue is resolved in a surprisingly
moralistic manner.
   ``Dangerous Liaisons' is made more accessible by straight-forward
American-style acting, and the language sounds contemporary despite
an overflow of aphorisms (``Vanity and happiness are
incompatible''). Glenn Close is inspired casting, displaying
calculated mischief in contrast to her ``Fatal Attraction''
dramatics.
   The Valmont role might better have been played by Tyrone Power or
Errol Flynn, but what Malkovich lacks in romantic dash he
compensates with intense dramatic skill. Michelle Pfeiffer delivers
another of her splendid performances, and newcomer Uma Thurman is
impressive as she moves from virgin to wanton.
   Norma Heyman and Hank Moonjean produced the Warner Bros. film,
which is superbly mounted. The rating is R for sexual content.
Running time: 120 minutes.

   Videos reviewed this week: ``Big Top Pee-wee,'' ``Casual Sex?,''
``Paramedics'' and ``Stormy Monday.''
   
   ``Big Top Pee-wee'' (Paramount Home Video; VHS-Beta,
$89.95-$29.95; Rated G)
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   
   Pee-wee Herman had a farm, e-i-e-i-o.
   And on this farm he had a talking pig named Vance, a pony who
could make pancakes and an entire circusful of strange but
good-hearted performers.
   Here is Pee-wee practicing animal husbandry and agricultural
science with smashing success but failing miserably at making
friends with the local townsfolk, a bunch of certified sourpusses
who clearly would like to string up our hero by his red bowtie.
   The one exception is Winnie, the local school marm, who seems
truly smitten with the androgynous Pee-wee. Something is wrong,
though; her blond tresses snarl painfully under Pee-wee's caress,
and she persists in making him detestable egg-salad sandwiches for
their lunch dates.
   The problem becomes clear when the circus, led by Kris
Kristofferson, drops in his yard a la Oz, after a storm. Here is the
girl of his dreams: Gina the trapeze artist, played by the comely
Italian actress Valeria Golino. Pee-wee's in love.
   Pee-wee, who is already a man-turned-boy, doesn't exactly turn
back into a man in this picture, but he does seem to be growing up.
Whereas ``Pee-wee's Big Adventure'' saw him curling a painted lip at
the prospect of a date with the local bike-shop bimbo, ``Big Top''
finds him as a full-blown romantic leading man, with lots of girl
trouble, a real make-out scene and even _ gasp! _ sex, represented
in a discreet yet cornball way.
   The story of how he wins over the poopy townspeople and helps the
circus put on the best show ever is classic Pee-wee, as written,
produced and performed by his alter ego, Paul Reubens. Full of all
the fun stuff that makes his Saturday morning show so enchanting,
the message here is that it's OK to be different. ``Big Top'' will
make kids of all ages feel good about themselves.

   ``Casual Sex?'' (MCA Home Video; VHS, $89.95; Rated R)
   
   ``Casual Sex?'' was an OK idea for a movie. Two single women _
one frightened of sex because of AIDS, her friend just plain
frightened of sex _ go off to a spa for a vacation of free-wheeling
manhunting.
   But ``Casual Sex?'' is not an OK movie. It's silly, predictable
and rarely funny.
   Melissa (Victoria Jackson) and Stacy (Lea Thompson) despair of
finding men with whom they can develop meaningful relationships.
Melissa nearly married the wrong man, but otherwise has avoided much
experience with men. Stacy counts off her former boyfriends, though
her sexual exploits came to a screeching halt with the AIDS scare.
   So they talk about having sex for the fun of it (Stacy recalls
the time when she'd say to a lover, ``Wow, that felt great. What's
your name again?''). But what they really search for is romance and
true love.
   At the ``Oasis Spa,'' Melissa and Stacy have the requisite number
of run-ins with awful, wrong men before true love strikes with the
men they both had overlooked.
   Jackson has an endearing deadpan delivery, and she and Thompson
hit it off as pals. Andrew Dice Clay brings comic relief playing an
oafish pickup artist with a heart of gold.
   Directed by Genevieve Rovert, ``Casual Sex?'' does try to deal
with the sexual mores of the 1980s and with AIDS in a mature and
humorous manner. It is probably an admirable effort _ but only
occasionally a successful one.

   ``Paramedics'' (Vestron Video; VHS-Beta, $79.98; Rated PG-13)
   
   Don't even bother to read this review let alone buy or rent
``Paramedics.'' You will only be wasting your time, unless you find
sophomoric double entendres about bimbos and chicks amusing, or
tired ethnic jokes a big laugh.
   Using the ``Police Academy'' format, this Stuart Margolin hybrid
dabbles in every formula of the trade. But where ``Police Academy''
had hilarity with its special breed of outrageous characters and
situations, ``Paramedics'' just crawls along squeezing laughs from a
dead storyline and lifeless characters.
   It stars George Newbern (``Adventures in Babysitting'') as Uptown
and Christopher McDonald (``Grease 2'') as Mad Mike, two rowdy
paramedics who use their custom-made city van to cruise the street
for women, much to the horror of their dreadful boss. He reassigns
the undynamic duo from their run in the posh part of town to a
rundown area where they stumble into a street gang war and get
involved in a heart transplant caper. In a fairly predictable
sequence of events, Uptown and Mad Mike emerge as heroes.
   But for all the action, ``Paramedics'' merely shuffles along.
   Also featured are Lawrence-Hilton Jacobs, Ray Walston and the
voice of Sally Kellerman as a dispatcher.

   ``Stormy Monday'' Paramount Home Video; VHS-Beta, $89.95-$29.95;
Rated R
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   
   It's America Week in Newcastle, and all that's tacky and
distasteful about the United States has come to persuade this
English industrial city to embrace the invasion.
   A clever setting for a romantic thriller, and ``Stormy Monday''
often is clever, as well as sultry and stylish. But it also can be
too elusive and too violent _ there are beatings, shootings,
bombings.
   Cosmo (Tommy Lee Jones) leads the Americans, while Finney (Sting)
is determined not to be pushed around and has brought the Krakow
Jazz Ensemble to mark America Week at the nightclub he owns and the
Americans want to buy.
   The musicians and the Americans all end up at the same hotel, as
do the movie's love interests, Brendan (Sean Bean), who works for
Finney, and Katie (Melanie Griffith), who had been involved with and
seems to work for Cosmo.
   Much of the goings on are shadier than the shady characters. Why
does Cosmo want control of Newcastle? At one point, he explains:
``We can't be shooting people around here. We are supposed to
improve the quality of life, provide jobs and make a lot of money.''
Yes, but ...
   Much of the cleverness involves the Polish musicians. When the
Americans are about to hold a flag-waving reception, Cosmo learns
his band is a no-show. So, the East Bloc band performs a Jimi
Hendrix-like ``Star Spangled Banner.''
   Writer-director Mike Figgis gets impressive performances from his
actors but makes too much of the violence and too little of the
motives for the knock-down, drag-out fight over Newcastle.

   ``Christmas Now Is Drawing Near'' (Saydisc) _ Sneak's Noyse.
   ``Thys Yool'' (Nimbus) _ The Martin Best Ensemble.
   ``Christmas Night'' (Collegium) _ The Cambridge Singers and the
City of London Sinfonia, John Rutter conducting.
   
   Sneak's Noyse, a British early music group, promises that its
carol collection is done with original instruments _ rebecs,
penny-whistles, citterns and such _ and at first it may sound as if
the consort includes a cat doing its death rattle.
   ``Oh Christmas now, is drawing near,'' the singers drone, doing
their best to sound like tipsy amateurs out yowling for drinks and
mince pies.
   Patience, however, will be rewarded. Among the 28 tunes is a
lovely version of ``Sweet was the song the Virgin sang,'' a
little-heard carol written down in the early 17th century. There's
an unfamiliar tune, collected in 1952, for ``The holly and the
ivy,'' and some delightful instrumentals: ``Fy, Nay, prithee John,''
and ``The Furry Day Carol.''
   If you must know what Furry Day is, the brief notes are no help.
To get the most from the recording, the listener ought to be reading
along in ``The Oxford Book of Carols,'' the handiest source of
seasonal musical lore. The book explains that ``furry'' is from the
Latin ``feria,'' which means holiday _ also the root of the word
``fair,'' as in village fair.
   Lucie Skeaping, the soprano for Sneak's Noyse, also appears on
Thys Yool, a more austere Christmas recording from the Martin Best
Ensemble.
   One of the jewels in this collection is a 14th-century song, ``As
I lay on Yoolis night,'' in which the narrator imagines being
present at the Nativity. ```Sing now, mother,' said the child,
`about what shall befall me hereafter when I become old.'''
   The mother responds with an eloquent shrug: ``Sweet son,
wherefore should I sing? I never knew anymore about you but what
Gabriel told me in his greeting.''
   On the rollicking side, there's the song ``Tapster, Drynker,''
which is simply an appeal for one more round.
   After the austerities of authentic antiquity, as presently
understood, John Rutter's polished collection of standards is balm
for the ears. Rutter, one of the rising stars in British choral
music both as a composer and conductor, serves up familiar favorites
starting with ``In dulci jubilo'' and on through ``Adam lay
ybounden,'' ``The Cherry Tree Carol'' and even, one dreads, ``O
Tannenbaum.''
   Wretched sentimentality is avoided, however, by the
professionalism and the sincerity of the performances.

   ``Everything's Different Now'' (Epic) 'Til Tuesday
   
   ``No one wants to be happier more than I do,'' Aimee Mann sings
on ``Everything's Different Now,'' the third album by her band, 'Til
Tuesday.
   It's an awful thing to say, but music fans have a vested interest
in seeing she doesn't get her wish. Mann has built a pretty good
career on romantic torment.
   She recently broke up with boyfriend Jules Shear, himself a
songwriter with the band Reckless Sleepers, providing her with a
mother lode of new material.
   Side 1 is a five-song suite that begins with the cautious
optimism of the title tune, co-written with Shear, and ends with the
angry Mann adding an expletive to the line ``life could be great''
that concludes ``(Believed You Were) Lucky.''
   The natural temptation is to run in panic when you hear one of
the songs is titled ``J for Jules'' and features a french horn.
Somehow, she makes it work. Mann is an imaginative writer, able to
give a new twist to an old subject, and her mournful voice is
brightened by strong pop melodies.
   ``I was counting to forever and never even got to 10,'' she sings
at one point. ``When we found a rip in heaven, we should have just
ascended then.''
   Side 2 strays slightly from the dominant theme. ``Limits to
Love'' is about a troubled girl who doesn't respond to the love of
her friends. On ``The Other End (Of the Telescope),'' Mann duets
with another noted wordsmith, Elvis Costello.
   If you think Mann has a tough life, consider Shear, whose band
released its debut album a few months ago. Not only is all his dirty
laundry being aired in public, but his ex-girlfriend's record far
outshines his.

   ``This Woman'' (RCA) _ K.T. Oslin
   
   K.T Oslin, who began her recording career at the age of 45, has
soared to country music stardom on the basis of her excellent
songwriting and a strong, expressive voice.
   Those strengths, as well as a glaring weakness _ squeaky-clean,
middle-of-the-road pop arrangements that undercut the gritty
real-life images of her lyrics _ are served up in equal measures on
``This Woman.''
   The follow-up to ``80's Ladies,'' her smash 1987 debut, ``This
Woman'' features nine songs that look knowingly at the good times,
bad times and silly games that make and break relationships.
   The best songs include ``Jealous,'' in which the singer fumes
over a man who doesn't know she's alive, while he runs after another
woman who doesn't know he's alive. Oslin's growling, angry vocal,
burning through a gorgeous piano melody, cannot be ignored.
   And ``Where Is a Woman to Go'' offers a hangin' out at the bar
tale from a woman's perspective. ``You know my daddy would die if he
knew his baby was seekin' refuge in a little 'ol bar 'cross town,''
she sings. ``But tell me where is a woman to go when she's feeling
low?''
   In fact, there's not a number on the album that really can be
called bad. But a nagging feeling persists _ how would these songs
sound with a nice little rough-edged band behind Oslin?
   Next time out, someone get This Woman such a band.

<HEAD>Star Watch: TV Villain Makes Good on Big Screen</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The strangest hit of the holiday season is a
gag-packed feature version of a television series that lasted only
four weeks, starring an actor better known for playing villains than
getting laughs.
   Leslie Nielsen, who has a long record of evil-doing in films and
television, is currently killing people with laughs in ``The Naked
Gun: From the Files of Police Squad!'' The Paramount Pictures
release is the work of Jerry Zucker, Jim Abrams and David Zucker,
who previously made ``Airplane!'' and who specialize in titles and
scripts with exclamation marks.
   Nielsen, 62, repeats the role of Lt. Frank Drebin, the incredibly
incompetent detective who appeared in the brief, lamented 1982
series ``Police Squad!'' The actor, who had appeared in
``Airplane!,'' recalled the inception of the show:
   ``Jerry and Jim and David invited me to lunch, and they even
pitched me! They didn't realize I was putty in their hands. Anything
they wanted me to do, I was willing.
   ``They mentioned doing `Police Squad' on television. Can you
imagine me doing Lt. Drebin on TV under the auspices of the Zuckers
and Abrams? Paradise!''
   Sad to say, ABC yanked ``Police Squad!'' after six chapters were
made and four aired. Why?
   ``It didn't belong on TV,'' Nielsen theorized. ``It had the kind
of humor you have to pay attention to. When you have a screen that
is bigger than life, you can see what is going on in the background.
You don't have to search for it.
   ``You can watch it at home and look around and say, `Gee, I'm
going to get that door painted,' or `Leave the telephone alone.'
There was no laugh track to bring the audience's attention back to
the screen. It belongs up there on the big screen, (in theaters)
where people have paid money to get in so they're not liable to
waste their money by not paying attention.''
   Nielsen explained that ZAZ (as the trio are called) originally
planned to make a feature of ``Police Squad!'' but couldn't find a
plot long enough. So they fashioned mini-plots for a TV series.
After years of trying, they came up with a story that pitted Drebin
against Vincent Ludwig (Ricardo Mantalban), the Los Angeles
businessman who is really a killer.
   A large part of the appeal of ``Naked Gun-Police Squad'' can be
attributed to Nielsen's straight-arrow playing of the outrageous
events. There is a certain madness in his method: ``The more
seriousness, the more credibility you present in your demeanor when
you're talking about insanity, the funnier it becomes.''
   Although he was something of a practical joker as a boy in Fort
Norman, Saskatchewan (``We didn't know that water bombs would freeze
on the way down from a second-story window''), Leslie Nielsen was
not considered much of a comedian in his early years. One of three
sons of a Royal Canadian Mountie, he served as a gunner in the Royal
Canadian Air Force and later studied at Lorne Greene's radio academy
in Toronto.
   Winning a scholarship to New York's Neighborhood Playhouse,
Nielsen moved into live television, appearing on 46 shows in one
year. His first movie was the title role in ``The Vagabond King.''
MGM signed him to a term contract, but he never rose from playing
leads in B pictures and second-leads in major films.
   Moving into television, he specialized in heavies. ``In episodic
TV they always needed a guest star,'' he said. ``The star was always
the good guy, so the best part was the heavy. The meaner and more
ferocious you were, the better the hero looked when he whipped you.''
   He also briefly starred in his own series.
   ``I began with `The New Breed,' and we did 36 shows in one year.
Then I did `Bracken's World,' `The Bold Ones' and `Swamp Fox' at
Disney, also `Shaping Up' and `Police Squad!' None of them went over
a year. Some had only six shows or less.
   ``But maybe it worked out all right in the long run,'' he said.
``Because now I'm doing `The Naked Gun' and I don't have any track
record with any one character that's endured.
   ``After 35 years in Hollywood, I finally realized that I had been
cast against type. I've finally found my home _ as Lt. Frank
Drebin.''
   The success of ``Naked Gun'' will undoubtedly lead to a sequel.
   ``Already they were working on a script,'' Nielsen disclosed.
``I'll be meeting in the Oval Office with President Bush, who will
send me to catch Mr. Big in the drug trade. I will be working
directly with the mastermind of the anti-drug campaign, Vice
President Quayle. They're thinking of asking Pat Sajak to play that
part.
   ``Of course Mr. Big will turn out to be Ricardo Mantalban. He
died in `Naked Gun,' but his evil twin is out there lurking. They
may even call it `The Wrath of Ludwig.'''
   He could be serious.

<HEAD>The Artists: A Mahlerian _ and Only a Mahlerian</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GRAHAM HEATHCOTE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When Gilbert Kaplan, a New York City publisher with
minimal musical training, told the experts he wanted to conduct
Gustav Mahler's Second Symphony, they told him it was possible but
``downright foolish.''
   ``And they were right,'' the American magazine publisher says.
   ``But what you don't know, you don't know,'' he says. ``Someone
once told me that a bumblebee, judged by aerodynamic principles, is
incapable of flying. But the bumblebee doesn't know that. So I kept
going forward.''
   Today, the 47-year-old has realized something of a fairy tale in
musical annals. An untrained rank outsider, he has conducted
Mahler's Second, ``The Resurrection,'' 13 times around the world and
has just released a recording.
   The Austrian composer wrote eight other symphonies, but Kaplan
has no interest in conducting them. He's sticking with the Second
Symphony.
   ``I certainly feel qualified to learn other things but I don't
think of myself as a conductor,'' he says.
   Kaplan, who gave his first performance in 1982 with the American
Symphony Orchestra, can't read music and has memorized the score.
Some critics have accused him of using his wealth to indulge
himself, while others have praised him.
   Married with four children, he publishes the magazine
Institutional Investor and conducts for free. He hopes to perform
the symphony next year in Japan, West Germany, Denmark, Venezuela
and Jerusalem.
   When Kaplan conducted with the London Symphony Orchestra in 1986
and sold out London's 6,000-seat Royal Albert Hall, Michael Kennedy
of the Daily Telegraph called his interpretation ``revealing and
moving.''
   ``This is no rich man's acted-out fantasy,'' he wrote. ``The LSO
do not play with this kind of subtlety in the matter of dynamics nor
with such careful instrumental balance unless the man with the stick
has got his message across.''
   Kaplan was in London in November for the release of his recording
with the LSO in Cardiff, Wales. He talked about his ``hobby,'' as he
sat in his Savoy Hotel suite overlooking the Thames and the Royal
Festival Hall where he conducted in 1984.
   ``I used to look across to the Festival Hall but I never thought
I would ever conduct there,'' he said.
   Kaplan studied music from age 7 to 10 ``like other American boys,
and I stopped as soon as I could.''
   In 1965, he was working on Wall Street when a friend took him to
hear conductor Leopold Stokowski rehearsing Mahler's Second with the
American Symphony Orchestra at Carnegie Hall.
   Kaplan was sufficiently intrigued to go to the concert. ``I had
never heard Mahler's music before and when I walked out of the hall
I was a different person,'' he recalled.
   ``The first time you hear Mozart's music, you think it is
charming. The first time you hear Mahler's _ if Mahler can reach you
_ you are changed in a very fundamental way. Even poor performances
produce enthusiastic audiences and when I turn around, I can always
spot the people who are hearing it for the first time.
   ``Mahler, more than any other composer, touches on very personal
matters which, as children, we think about and then we tuck away and
forget, to get on with our lives.
   ``Then Mahler pushes the buttons again and everything comes back
_ life, death, hope, despair, purpose _ all those things grownups
don't talk about.''
   Over the next 15 years, Kaplan heard every performance of the
Second Symphony in New York.
   ``Then I woke up one morning, and somehow I knew that one day I
was going to conduct a symphony. I know it sounds preposterous,'' he
said.
   ``I didn't know what it meant to conduct, didn't know that
Mahler's Second is one of the most difficult works to conduct. I
wasn't trying to prove anything. I wasn't climbing mountains and it
wasn't a mid-life crisis. I just knew I was going to conduct the
symphony. I was on a conveyor belt and no way of getting off.''
   As a member of the board of Carnegie Hall, he was able to get
advice from musicians and conductors. He talked to more people, read
and got nowhere.
   Then Kaplan found a young conductor, Charles Bornstein of the
Juilliard School in New York, took him to his Long Island home and
worked nine hours a day for 30 days, memorizing an 83-minute
symphony.
   The rest is history. The New York Daily News rated Kaplan's 1983
performance with the American Symphony Orchestra among the year's 10
best. Other orchestras invited him to conduct and critics have
praised his performances from Brazil to Japan.
   Mahler, who died in Vienna in 1911 at age 50, was a zealous
perfectionist whose musicians at the Vienna Opera called him ``the
tyrant.''
   Kaplan, who owns Mahler's original score, says: ``He was a great
notationist and could write down what he really wanted from the
musicians. ... He tells you, `Don't slow down here,' because he
knows the music has a tendency to slow down there.
   ``I try to conduct the music as closely as possible to what
Mahler wanted. I want people to hear what Mahler wrote, not
someone's idea of what he wrote.''

   Twenty-one years ago, the Chicago Transit
Authority came to mean a rock band as well as elevated trains around
the Loop. But the group had to shorten its name to Chicago when sued
by the Windy City's Mayor Richard J. Daley.
   Now the seven-man Chicago, which numbers its record albums rather
than names them, has ``19'' in the Top 100 on Cashbox magazine's
best-selling chart. A single from ``19'' _ ``Look Away'' _ moved
into the Top 10. The first single from the album, ``I Don't Wanna
Live Without Your Love,'' charted in the Top 10 in August.
   Chicago, having survived the death of guitarist Terry Kath, Peter
Cetera's leaving for a solo career and a slump, is going strong.
   ``I think you have a sophisticated and educated listener,'' said
Woodwinds player Walt Parazaider. ``More people are musical than in
the late '60s and '70s. Whether the crowd knows a B flat from a Z
diminished, they know if you're not playing well.''
   Chicago has had time to learn to play well. ``As we sit here 21
years later, five of the six originals are still in the band. Six
months after we began, we added Peter Cetera as bassist and lead
vocalist,'' Parazaider said.
   ``The idea Danny (drummer Danny Seraphine) and I had was, let's
put together a rock 'n' roll band with horns. We'd incorporate horns
as more than background licks. I think we've kept up with that.''
   The group has had time to get jaded, too, but Parazaider says
that hasn't happened. ``They say we've sold 80-to-100 million
records and had something like 33 top 40 hit singles.
   ``Every time I hear about a hit record, that's a thrill. Here's
people buying your music, something that you create. There's no
jaded part to Chicago. We are thoroughly pleased that people enjoy
what we're doing.''
   From their first album in 1969, ``Chicago Transit Authority,''
the group became a big underground success and became known as a
touring band.
   ``Janis Joplin and Jimi Hendrix took us on tour as opening act
before we had a record,'' Parazaider said, recalling that Hendrix
told him, ``Your horn section is like one set of lungs and your
guitar player is better than me.'' Joplin told him, ``When you get
as famous as I'm going to be, and you will, don't take it too
serious.''
   ``It meant a lot to me, a link to people that are legends,''
Parazaider said. ``That they respected us is great; I feel fortunate
we touched base with them at all. We take it serious but this isn't
brain surgery.''
   Touring, he said, has always been one of Chicago's strengths.
``The music we play on stage is free. But traveling, they can't pay
us enough for that. We do tours of 130 shows in 150 days. ... We're
always out there playing for whoever wants to hear us. You get
instant reviews.''
   Of course, album sales haven't been constant for two decades.
   ``Glitter rock hit, punk and new wave. We stuck to the music we
played and changed a little with the times. Around the 13th and 14th
albums, in the late '70s, there was a lull. The 13th was gold. Up to
then, they'd been multi-platinum. The 14th wasn't gold.
   ``After selling 50 or 60 million records for Columbia, they ran
for cover when things went bad.'' Columbia dropped Chicago in 1983.
   ``It hurt my feelings,'' Parazaider said. ``It's like you can hit
a grand slam last night and strike out tonight and they're going to
boo. Fame is a transient thing.''
   But he said he wasn't bitter. ``It was a learning experience. Now
I'm happy it happened. ... We got a slap in the face of reality and
we needed it.''
   At that time Chicago's management company advised the band to
produce its own album to be shopped around.
   ``After we finished the 16th album, the response at the different
record companies was tepid at best,'' Parazaider said. ``One label
said, `We'll get rid of the horns and sign a rhythm section.' That
hurts your feelings and makes you mad.
   ``Our manager, Howard Kaufman, said, `After the first single is a
hit the rest of the companies are going to be banging their heads.'
Our next single was No. 1, `Hard to Say I'm Sorry.''' ``16'' was a
gold album and ``17'' was platinum.'' Chicago records on the Reprise
label now.
   Parazaider, whose trumpet-playing Croatian father lives in
Chicago and whose mother was Czech, graduated from DePaul University
in 1968 in clarinet performance. He was inspired at 9 by seeing
Benny Goodman on television. ``Money wasn't abundant,'' Parazaider
recalled, ``but my father got me a teacher. When I was 14 the
teacher said I had surpassed him.
   ``He put me under the tutelage of the clarinetist in the Chicago
Symphony. The relationship lasted until he died in the '70s. He saw
the first big wave the band had in the early '70s and was quite
proud. He played in Carnegie Hall the week before we first played
there. He left me a note backstage, `OK, kid, just play in tune and
don't play too loud.'''
   The clarinetist plays saxophone, flute, keyboards and guitar but
not clarinet for Chicago.
   ``James Pankow (trombonist) arranges. Lee (trumpeter Lee
Loughnane) and I sightread the parts. I think our musicianship has
grown because of the stuff he has written that has challenged us,''
he said. Other members are Robert Lamm, Jason Scheff, who replaced
Cetera, and Bill Champlin.

   ``A Bright Shining Lie,'' Neil Sheehan's profile of
Lt. Col. John Paul Vann and his war in Vietnam, may turn out to be
an enduring handbook for powers bent on foreign adventures.
   The National Book Award in nonfiction, conferred on the author
Nov. 29, recognized literary merit and careful research. However,
the book is more than a well-written biography. It is a study of
futility on a world scale.
   Vann, a dedicated career officer, spoke out early in the war
against the brutality and ineffectiveness of U.S. strategy in
Southeast Asia. He learned at the battle of Ap Bac in 1962 how hard
it was to kill a man dug into a hole if that man was determined to
stay there until his enemy ran out of bullets and will.
   Sheehan, at the time United Press International's Saigon bureau
manager, discovered it was scarcely easier for reporters to get
across that simple reality in the face of prevailing wisdom back
home.
   A decade of escalating technology, rising troop numbers and a
burgeoning U.S. commitment did not change those basic lessons. But
the elusive light at the end of the tunnel captivated even Vann.
   In 1972, a civilian with the rank of major general and head of an
uphill program to win hearts and minds, Vann died still fighting a
war he thought he might win. He was director of the government's
Civilian Development Program and was killed in a helicopter crash
returning from battlefield inspection.
   Sheehan, who later reported for The New York Times and who helped
report on the Pentagon Papers in 1971, spent 16 years sifting the
evidence and then reciting facts so readers in a calmer time could
draw clear conclusions.
   ``We had also, to all the visitors who came over there, been one
of the bright shining lies,'' Vann remarked to a U.S. army historian
in mid-1963. Sheehan used those words as a frontispiece.
   While the book is a finely etched portrait of a complex zealot,
it also catalogs the false assumptions, self-delusions and
miscalculations that widened a hopeless war.
   Vann, as a young adviser, watched ragtag guerrillas humiliate
large U.S.-backed forces. He could not convince superiors that South
Vietnam's unmotivated army was in no shape to defeat the Viet Cong.
As a political analyst, he argued in vain that corrupt, autocratic
leaders could not win over disaffected peasants, however much
material and moral support they got from Washington.
   In 800 pages of lively prose, Sheehan never outlines in concrete
terms the underlying message, but even the casual reader sees it:
Exported ideology fares badly against a nationalist cause.

<HEAD>Nashville Sound: Travel Broadens Horizons for Country Star</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Singer Kathy Mattea's heart will always
belong to her native West Virginia even though she's strayed far
from home in the decade she's become a country music star.
   Mattea, from Cross Lanes, W.Va., had one of country music's
biggest hits in 1988, ``18 Wheels & a Dozen Roses.''
   ``I find traveling broadens the horizons,'' she said in a
telephone interview from Los Angeles where she was taping the TV
show ``Hollywood Squares.''
   ``But the funny thing is I've developed a stronger sense of home
that's a real comfort.''
   She's lived for 10 years in Nashville, Tenn., where she has been
working on her fifth album, scheduled to be in the stores next
spring. Clearly happy with her thriving music career, she regrets
only being too busy to visit her family and friends as much as she
would like: ``My success hasn't made a difference with my friends.
I've only lost touch with the ones who would have drifted away
anyway.''
   It took years of work and six failed nominations before the
28-year-old Mattea ``made it'' in October with her recent Country
Music Association award for single of the year for ``18 Wheels & A
Dozen Roses.''
   The event was a thrilling culmination to a year of rising record
sales, growing concert audiences on a tour headlined by George
Strait and her personal favorite _ her Valentine's Day wedding to
songwriter Jon Vezner.
   In 1978, she dropped out of West Virginia University and headed
for Nashville after she found herself spending more time with a
bluegrass band than on her studies. ``One of my band members was
moving there, so I tagged along,'' she said.
   It eventually proved to have been the right choice: ``It was a
town where I could flourish. I wasn't threatened by its size.''
   She had the usual round of jobs _ waitress and secretary, then
tour guide at the Country Music Hall of Fame. She was singing
demonstration tapes and advertising jingles when she signed with the
Mercury label in 1983. A year later, her self-titled first album
yielded three well-received singles and she was on her way.
   Mattea said she had always adored music and experimenting with
it. She sang at her local church and with a folk band in high
school. At the same time, she listened to all the pop music she
could and absorbed her elder brother's wide-ranging interests in
rock 'n' roll.
   ``Since the age of 2, I've known I'd be some kind of
entertainer,'' she said. ``I had a gut-level reaction to people like
(Bob) Dylan and early James Taylor. They just made me want to cry.''
   A teen-age passion for folk singer Buffy St. Marie's music led
Mattea to form an all-girl band, Buffy.
   She also played acoustic guitar and later, in Nashville, mixed
all her influences until a sound emerged. She calls it country-folk,
and the sound came to fruition on her 1986 album, ``Walk the Way the
Wind Blows.''
   Mattea is at a point in her career when thoughts of failure can
be frightening. ``Success is a subjective thing, and you find
yourself wondering, `Oh, God, can I really do this again?'''
   Coupled with that is anxiety about her image.
   ``I'm getting more comfortable with changing my hair and
make-up,'' she said. ``It's real interesting because the traditional
movement is so strong in country music.''
   She also hopes to challenge tradition with her next album, which
will include Celtic and Irish musical influences.

   Miracle cures and cheaper, healthier food are
on the horizons of biotechnology, but for companies able to cope
with the regulatory patchwork of the embryonic industry the future
holds huge earnings.
   The Industrial Biotechnology Association predicts that sales, now
estimated at $600 million, will rise to between $25 billion and $30
billion in the year 2000 and between $75 billion and $100 billion in
2025.
   ``The first impact is going to clearly be on the medical side,''
said James McCamant, editor of Medical Technology Stock Letter in
Berkeley, Calif.
   Genetically engineered products to cure AIDS and some cancers, to
make pork and beef leaner and healthier, and to protect crops from
insects, weeds and the weather, are just a few of the promises held
out by the industry.
   ``You will see biotechnology products all over the shelves in the
next few years. It will creep into your life and continue to
accelerate. Fifteen years from now we can't even speculate,''
McCamant said.
   The United States remains the leader in all aspects of
biotechnology _ diagnostics, medicine, forensics and agriculture,
analysts say. But Japan and Western European nations are making
inroads, partly due to a strong government role in financing and, in
some cases, looser regulations.
   ``Funding for the basic sciences has gone down in the last 10
years. We're being hit pretty hard by the Germans, the English and
the Japanese,'' said Jim Gramlich, director of the American Cyanamid
Co. agriculture research center in Princeton.
   California, Massachusetts, Wisconsin, North Carolina and New
Jersey are the states having the most companies with biotech
connections, said IBA spokeswoman Sherrod Shim. States benefit in
taxes and jobs by supporting biotechnology, and can be good sources
of startup funds, say state biotech center officials.
   However, in the long run, the New Jersey Center for Advanced
Biotechnology and Medicine hopes to attract federal support and
backing from pharmaceutical companies, said Robert Namovicz, the
center's executive director.
   Agencies like the National Institutes of Health and National
Science Foundation have responded to challenges from abroad in
recent years with more grants to universities and industry, but not
everyone sees that as an answer.
   ``They are good to a certain point. They're more directed toward
the research and what we're really about is developing a commercial
product,'' said Don Reed, chief financial officer of Massachusetts'
Cambridge BioScience Corp.
   U.S. companies have not yet taken their business to countries
with looser regulations, such as France or Italy, said Jeff Gibbs,
one of three authors of ``Biotechnology and The Environment:
International Regulation.''
   But it could happen, Gibbs said, even though the European
Community is studying whether to establish uniform rules that would
probably lean toward those in countries like Denmark and West
Germany, where the stronger influence of environmental groups has
led to tougher regulation.
   What companies are doing is taking advantage of the newness of
the U.S. regulatory environment. The Patent and Trademark Office,
facing a backlog of more than 6,000 biotech applications, asked the
industry association in early November to train more patent
examiners to handle the caseload.
   All over the country, companies are racing to develop new
products.
   Cetus Corp., of Emeryville, Calif., has worked to develop
polymerase chain reaction which lets scientists magnify a single
piece of DNA, the molecule that carries genetic information. Cetus
president Robert Fildes said PCR simplifies diagnosticians' task of
finding viruses from infected cells. It can determine in hours if a
cell has been infected with AIDS, for example, something that would
take six weeks using tests in a culture medium, Fildes said.
   Lifecodes Corp., of Tarrytown, N.Y., is offering DNA tests to
determine the guilt or innocence of criminal suspects from body
fluids. Company spokeswoman Karen Wexler said Lifecodes will soon
offer a kit that tests DNA samples of suspects' blood or semen to
match them to samples taken from the crime.
   Turf battles between federal agencies trying to decide
jurisdiction for each new biotechnology product and the constantly
changing science complicate the task of companies seeking a piece of
the market, said Jan Kurtz, with the science advisory board for the
federal Environmental Protection Agency.
   ``We're trying to make a patchwork quilt,'' Ms. Kurtz said.
``It's not easy to promulgate new legislation. The questions are all
new.''
   Faye Peterson, a Food and Drug Administration spokeswoman, said
the regulatory process does not differ greatly from other products
submitted to the agency. Regulation levels are appropriate and do
not require further expansion, an assessment shared by most company
officials, she said.
   However, Mike Cannell of the Wisconsin Family Farm Defense Fund,
Inc., a group opposed to biotechnology in agriculture for economic
and safety reasons, said, ``It doesn't take a black heart to imagine
the worst when the chemical companies are supplying most of the
regulatory data.''
   Groups like Cannell's and the Washington, D.C.-based Foundation
on Economic Trends contend the dangers of biotechnology haven't been
sufficiently examined. Critics point to herbicides and pesticides
that were once considered harmless and have been proven to pollute
groundwater as reason to doubt the motives of any industry that is
being regulated.
   The industry says fears of genetically engineered bacteria
running wild mislead the public and legislators into seeking to
toughen the regulatory road.
   ``The risks are sometimes greatly exaggerated of nature gone
wild. We all grew up on the same movies of giant spiders that
escaped laboratories and ate Chicago,'' said Hugh 'Andrade,
executive vice president of Schering-Plough Corp. in Madison and
vice chairman of the industry association.
   More plausible dangers involve weed-control experiments that
could backfire with the wrong gene implanted, letting the weed
reproduce, and even that would be highly improbable because
researchers start experiments with some idea of which genes
accomplish what ends, D'Andrade said.
   The specialized knowledge and costly equipment required will keep
the technology out of the wrong hands, and regulation coupled with
companies' wish not to damage their credibility will keep products
from being rushed onto the market without proper safeguards, he said.
   Lisa Drake, a spokeswoman for Monsanto Co. in St. Louis, said the
company is used to regulatory mazes but it's harder for smaller
firms. ``We're used to working within those kinds of boundaries. But
a lot of smaller companies are bothered by regulations because it's
so expensive and takes so much time.''
   Smaller companies living off initial investment capital all feel
pressure in an uncertain market to put products on the shelves, said
American Cyanamid's Gramlich. ``They can only survive so long in
savings and research contracts. I don't think any company can put 50
to 60 percent into research as some of these have and survive long.''
   Smaller companies like Epitope Inc. of Beaverton, Ore., can no
longer ask investors to wait, as in the early days of biotechnology,
said Michael Hubbard, president. ``They're not satisfied with
companies any more that say, `We're going to lose money for six or
seven years.'
   ``We've geared our work to very applicable things rather than
heading into long-term things like cancer treatment.''
   The competition also could reduce the number of companies.
Executives predict one-third of the industry will be acquired within
five years and nearly half within 10 years, according to ``Biotech
89: Commercialization,'' a report by Arthur Young Co. Analysts have
expected that to happen for some time.
   ``The progress of commercial biotechnology is unfolding with
remarkable logic,'' said the report. ``Neither unexpected challenges
(the stock market collapse) nor fully expected challenges
(regulatory issues, patent disputes) have stalled an industry that
has begun to show its strength.''

   A study of women with radically
different sex lives _ prostitutes and totally monogamous Indians _
found new evidence linking promiscuity to transmission of a virus
that can cause cervical cancer.
   Dr. Jose Azocar compared pap smear samples from the prostitutes
with those of Piaroa women, part of a strictly monogamous group that
lives in traditional villages scattered in this South American
nation's Amazon jungle.
   ``With this study the relation between the HPV virus and cervical
cancer is strengthened, as is the hypothesis that the mode of
transmission is sexual,'' said Azocar, a virologist with the
Venezuelan Scientific Research Institute.
   As early as the 1950s scientists observed that higher levels of
cervical cancer seemed to be associated with promiscuity. A solid
link between the human papilloma virus (HPV) and cervical cancer
wasn't made until the early 1980s by Harald Zur Hausen of Germany
and Ralph Richart of Columbia University. Using genetic engineering
to manipulate infected DNA, they found that the viruses most related
to cervical cancer were certain strains of HPV. Later research using
genetic material from the viruses confirmed their results.
   In 1985, Azocar began a similar study using viral genetic
material in cell samples from Caracas hospitals, and found that
nearly 80 percent of cervical cancers in Venezuela were associated
with HPV. Cancer is the No. 2 killer in Venezuela, and cervical
cancer is the most common form in women.
   ``It is widely accepted among scientists that HPV causes cervical
cancer, but it is thought that other factors are involved, including
many births, early onset of sexual activity, and promiscuity. I
wanted to see to what point these other factors were involved,''
Azocar said in a recent interview.
   Further study required control groups at the extremes of sexual
activity.
   ``It's hard to find a control group of monogamous people, and
with the Piaroa the girls are married off for life as soon as they
get their first period,'' Azocar said. ``The only thing they
required was that all the examinations be done by women
gynecologists.''
   Getting to the Piaroa, who had participated in an earlier AIDS
study, was difficult. The 7,000-member tribe lives in an area the
size of Austria roughly between the Parguaza River in southwest
Bolivar State and the town of Tama-Tama in Amazonas Federal
Territory.
   Most still live in villages of less than 100. They fish, hunt
small animals and birds and cultivate tubers and bananas as they
have for hundreds of years. Those in less remote villages may have
outboard motors for their canoes and wear western-style clothes, but
their limited exposure to modern society ensures that their
monogamous lifestyle is intact.
   Men of status may have two wives, but most have just one. There
is no one from outside the village to fool around with, and tribal
women are kicked out if they sleep with someone other than their
husbands.
   Azocar and his colleagues were flown by army helicopter to three
villages near the Parguaza River, 290 miles south of Caracas, where
they took samples from 125 women. No evidence of HPV or cervical
cancer was found.
   Examining a promiscuous group was easier. He conducted a
two-month campaign among prostitutes in several cities nearest
Piaroa territory for a cervical screening program and free
treatment. Police helped spread the word.
   A team of gynecologists took pap smears from 130 prostitutes.
Between 25 percent and 40 percent, depending on the city they lived
in, had HPV, and among these there was a high incidence of different
grades of pre-cancerous tumors.
   Both the Piaroa and prostitutes began having sex early, had
multiple births, similar blood lines, live in the same climate, eat
similar foods and are exposed to roughly the same frontier-style
living conditions.
   Sexually speaking, the major difference was the frequency of sex,
Azocar said. ``We showed that women who had many children and who
started sex at an early age didn't necessarily have HPV. This
provides solid data that cervical cancer is a sexually transmitted
disease _ that the virus is the most important factor causing it and
that promiscuity is the form of infection.''

   Miracle cures and cheaper, healthier food are
on the horizons of biotechnology, but for companies able to cope
with the regulatory patchwork of the embryonic industry the future
holds huge earnings.
   The Industrial Biotechnology Association predicts that sales, now
estimated at $600 million, will rise to between $25 billion and $30
billion in the year 2000 and between $75 billion and $100 billion in
2025.
   Genetically engineered products to cure AIDS and some cancers, to
make pork and beef leaner and healthier, and to protect crops from
insects, weeds and the weather, are just a few of the promises held
out by the industry.
   The United States remains the leader in all aspects of
biotechnology _ diagnostics, medicine, forensics and agriculture,
analysts say. But Japan and Western European nations are making
inroads, partly due to a strong government role in financing and, in
some cases, looser regulations.
   Agencies like the National Institutes of Health and National
Science Foundation have responded to challenges from abroad in
recent years with more grants to universities and industry, but not
everyone sees that as an answer.
   ``They are good to a certain point. They're more directed toward
the research and what we're really about is developing a commercial
product,'' said Don Reed, chief financial officer of Massachusetts'
Cambridge BioScience Corp.
   U.S. companies have not yet taken their business to countries
with looser regulations, such as France or Italy, said Jeff Gibbs,
one of three authors of ``Biotechnology and The Environment:
International Regulation.'' But it could happen, he said, even
though the European Community is studying whether to establish
uniform, probably stronger, rules.
   What companies are doing is taking advantage of the newness of
the U.S. regulatory environment. The Patent and Trademark Office,
facing a backlog of more than 6,000 biotech applications, asked the
industry association in early November to train more patent
examiners to handle the caseload.
   Turf battles between federal agencies trying to decide
jurisdiction for each new biotechnology product and the constantly
changing science complicate the task of companies seeking a piece of
the market, said Jan Kurtz, with the science advisory board for the
federal Environmental Protection Agency.
   ``We're trying to make a patchwork quilt,'' Ms. Kurtz said.
``It's not easy to promulgate new legislation. The questions are all
new.''
   Mike Cannell of the Wisconsin Family Farm Defense Fund, Inc., a
group opposed to biotechnology in agriculture for economic and
safety reasons, said, ``It doesn't take a black heart to imagine the
worst when the chemical companies are supplying most of the
regulatory data.''
   The industry says fears of genetically engineered bacteria
running wild mislead the public and legislators into seeking to
toughen the regulatory road.
   Big companies have the experience and financial strength to deal
with regulatory delays, but smaller companies feel the pressure.
They can no longer ask investors to wait as in the early days of
biotechnology.

<HEAD>White Has Folks Climbing Trees To Collect Pollen</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LUTHER, Okla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   All Karl White could get with his degree in
biology was a job climbing trees to collect plants.
   But the job happened to be for a company pioneering in allergy
work in the middle of hay-fever country, and now other people are
climbing trees for him.
   His Crystal Labs supplies 40 percent of the powdered mold, pollen
and other allergy villains purchased by labs that make allergy tests
and vaccines.
   ``Oklahoma is really the center point of all hay fever,'' White
said. Within 500 miles are deserts, trees, hills and mountains, not
to mention the Johnson grass and ragweed that flourish in the state
itself.
   The location may be perfect and the business lucrative, but White
says it also federally regulated, highly seasonal and workers can
face some unexpected hazards when they venture into the wild
collecting specimens.
   Crystal Labs produces up to 1,100 pounds a year of powder from
pollen, mold, animal skin, insects and food. His most expensive
product is mites, part of house dust, which sell for about $3,000 an
ounce when crushed to powder.
   Mold can be grown all year in the lab, but plants have to be
collected for pollen at just the right time _ just before the pollen
is released. The season begins in February with elms and runs
through October's goldenrod. That's the busiest time for White's
five employees and 20 contractors.
   The work can have complications: Well-meaning citizens often
assume that people collecting plants are doing something illegal.
   ``The most dangerous animal I have run into was humans,'' White
said. ``Almost everytime we go out and start collecting someone
turns me in thinking I'm trying to collect marijuana.''

<HEAD>New Explanation For Why The Magnetic North Pole Wanders</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BERKELEY, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Blobs of molten metal created where
Earth's core meets the overlying rock may explain why the magnetic
north pole wanders by about one degree every decade, a laboratory
experiment suggests.
   Unlike the geographic north pole, where Earth's lines of
longitude meet, geographers have noted changes for at least 1,200
years in the location of the magnetic north pole, which is where
compasses point.
   Scientists generally believed that changes within the planet's
liquid iron core were responsible for the wandering of magnetic
north. But blobs of molten core material created in the overlying
mantle may be at least as important, according to the study by
University of California scientists.
   To simulate conditions at the core-mantle boundary, about 1,800
miles below Earth's surface, they crushed samples of rock minerals
and liquid iron between diamond anvils at pressures about a million
times those at Earth's surface and used a laser to heat the samples
to more than 5,400 degrees Fahrenheit.
   The study found that molten iron reacts ``aggressively'' with the
rock minerals, known as perovskites, which are composed of
magnesium, iron, silicon and oxygen and which are thought to be the
main material in the lower mantle.
   Such reactions could create blobs of iron-rich metal alloys in
the lower mantle that might deflect magnetic field lines generated
in the core and could explain why the magnetic north pole wanders,
the scientists said.
   UC-Berkeley geophysicist Raymond Jeanloz presented the study
during the American Geophysical Union's fall meeting in San
Francisco.

<HEAD>`Biomuse' Could Let The Paralyzed Play Music</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STANFORD, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A synthesizer and computer can tap into
the body's ``symphony of electronic voices'' to let the paralyzed
make music by moving their eyes or dancers accompany themselves,
scientists say.
   Biomuse would let ``a dancer create music directly from the play
of muscle activity underlying the movement itself,'' said Hugh S.
Lusted and R. Benjamin Knapp of Stanford University's School of
Medicince in a research paper.
   The idea of making music from the body's electric signals isn't
new. But Lusted and Knapp wrote that electrodes placed on skin
``pick up many different signals simultaneously which merge to form
a background of noise,'' and the Biomuse computer can select desired
signals to make music.
   ``The body is literally a symphony of electrical voices, sounding
at different frequencies and intensities,'' they wrote. ``By placing
the pick-up electrodes on the upper arm, we can tune in to bicep
activity.
   ``Next, we instruct the processor to record the intensity of the
electricity coming from the bicep. Then we tell the device to
translate that electrical intensity to note number on the
synthesizer keyboard, such that low intensity (relaxed) gives low
notes and more muscle tension produces progressively higher notes.
   ``The slightest movement produces immediate sound from the
synthesizer. Thus, simply by tensing and relaxing one arm, the
musician can run notes up and down the keyboard.''
   It also could use other muscles, brain or heart activity. ``Since
the device can use any available nerve or muscle electricity as a
control signal to the synthesizer, a disabled person can learn to
make music _ even using eye movements,'' the scientists wrote.

<HEAD>Study Suggests Black Sea Fisheries May Be Threatened</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The surface layer of low-salt, oxygen-rich
water that supports abundant sea life in the Black Sea is only 44
percent as thick as it was 13 years ago, U.S. and Turkish
researchers say.
   The organisms in the relatively fresh surface water support
fisheries in the Soviet Union, Turkey, Romania and Bulgaria, but
scientists do not know how the change will affect the industry or
whether conditions will worsen.
   The study, sponsored by the U.S. National Science Foundation and
the Turkish government, included five Black Sea cruises by the U.S.
research ship Knorr from April through August. It found that the
surface layer extended to a depth of only 165 feet, compared with
375 feet recorded by researchers in 1975.
   University of Washington oceanographer James Murray, who
presented the study to the American Geophysical Union in December,
speculated that the change may be due to dams on Soviet rivers. He
said the dams already divert up to 50 percent of the water in some
Soviet rivers, keeping the fresh water from the Black Sea. But he
said natural variations also may be responsible.

<HEAD>Magnetic Device Lets Doctors Spot Potential Spinal Damage</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Surgeons who corrected Nicolasa Menchu's
scoliosis used a magnet during the operation, stimulating her brain
to make her limbs twitch and demonstrate that they hadn't damaged
any nerves or arteries.
   The surgery reduced the curvature of the 27-year-old Guatemalan
student's spine to remove the pressure on her organs that kept them
from functioning normally. The electromagnet, she says, ``saved me
from being paralyzed.''
   The spinal cord carries sensory signals to and from the brain.
Doctors generally use small electric shocks to the limbs and
electrodes on the scalp to test whether the spine is intact and
those signals are getting through.
   The use of the doughnut-shaped attached to the patient's head
lets doctors to be more aggressive with some spinal procedures, said
Dr. John R. Johnson, assistant professor of orthopedic surgery and
co-director of the Kenton D. Leatherman Spine Center of Norton and
Kosair Children's hospitals.
   About two years ago, Johnson and colleagues at the University of
Louisville School of Medicine heard that researchers in England were
stimulating the brain with a pulsed magnetic beam to diagnose
nervous-system disorders.
   Because the magnet can trigger nerve cells in only the part of
the brain that controls limb movement, they wondered if it might let
them test the spinal cord while avoiding some of the side effects of
electrical stimulation.
   In April 1987, they started testing magnetic stimulation on rats,
then on themselves, students and secretaries _ about 60 volunteers.
They found that the magnet triggered twitching of arms and legs if
placed over the correct region of the brain. The muscle activity is
measured and analyzed by a computer.
   The doctors have used the procedure on 48 patients, and it has
failed to trigger movement in about 20 percent. Harvey L. Edmonds,
research director for the anesthesiology department, said anesthesia
may be suppressing those patients' leg muscles.
   ``I'm very enthusiastic about it,'' said Dr. Susan Porter, an
anesthesiologist who has used the technique in about 20 operations
at the University of Kansas medical center. Porter said she foresees
other uses for the magnet, such as in monitoring the sciatic nerve
during hip surgery.

   It was the year they held a presidential election and half the
nation's voters decided to stay home.
   It was the year rescuers decided to free a trio of battered,
barnacle-encrusted gray whales trapped in the ice at the top of the
world. It was the year an early decision to let Yellowstone burn
altered the face of the showcase national park for a century to come.
   It was the year Oprah decided to diet, Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev decided he wanted to be president, Attorney General Edwin
Meese III decided to resign, evangelist Jimmy Swaggart decided to
confess his sins and Michael Spinks decided to challenge world
heavyweight champion Mike Tyson.
   Some decisions worked; others didn't.
   Soviets and Americans pulled together to free two surviving
whales, last seen cruising toward warmer waters. Soviet President
Andrei Gromyko bowed out, and Gorbachev took over. Oprah Winfrey,
the TV host, lost 67 pounds.
   In Yellowstone, however, officials realized too late they might
have made the wrong decision. By the time firefighters arrived,
unusually dry weather and high winds had fires ripping out of
control, forcing evacuation of towns and causing an uproar among
area residents.
   Swaggart preached on but lost much of his audience after the
Assemblies of God decided to defrock him. Spinks lasted for just 91
seconds and eight decisive blows.
   The wisdom of other decisions remained to be seen.
   Faced with the choice between Vice President George Bush and
Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, and frustrated by one of the
most low-down, dirty presidential campaigns ever, an ambivalent
electorate waffled and fidgeted and finally succumbed to
overwhelming inertia.
   ``I've always loved election years,'' President Reagan said, but
it seemed hardly anyone else did. Bush's 54-46 percent victory over
his Democratic opponent was based on a 50 percent voter turnout, the
lowest in 64 years.
   Political analysts looked at exit polls and determined that many
voters weren't voting for anyone so much as they were voting against
the other guy. They also determined that Bush lost 2 percent of his
supporters because they were turned off by his first major decision
_ to tap as his running mate Indiana Sen. Dan Quayle, the first
``baby boomer'' on a national ticket and a choice that surprised
even Bush's advisers.
   It was Democratic vice presidential candidate Lloyd Bentsen, the
silver-haired, smooth-talking senator from Texas, who provided the
only memorable line from the three nationally televised debates.
   ``Senator, you are no Jack Kennedy,'' Bentsen told a flustered
Quayle, after the 41-year-old senator had compared himself with the
late Democratic president.
   The Kennedy image haunted the campaign and the nation. The 25th
anniversary of his assassination became a time to reflect on
idealism lost and a world changed.
   Nowhere was that change more apparent than in U.S.-Soviet
relations.
   Kennedy, on the campaign trail himself 28 years ago, shunned
Nikita Khrushchev when he visited New York. But Gorbachev, the first
Soviet leader since Khrushchev to taste the Big Apple, had a
super-power lunch with Reagan and Bush on Dec. 7 and addressed the
United Nations, with no Khrushchev-style shoe-thumping. Instead, he
promised to trim 500,000 men and 10,000 tanks from the Soviet armed
forces.
   The visit ended abruptly when a devastating earthquake hit Soviet
Armenia. The Soviet leader rushed home to learn that an estimated
60,000 had died and 500,000 were left homeless as whole cities
crumbled under the quake's force.
   Rescue teams, doctors and planes loaded with supplies poured in
from around the world. It was the first time since World War II that
the Soviet Union had accepted disaster relief from the United States.
   Reagan paid his first visit to Moscow in June for a summit that
failed to break new ground in arms control. The president hammered
away on human rights issues, and Gorbachev later sent America living
proof of his commitment to change.
   Nobel laureate Andrei Sakharov, father of the Soviet dissident
movement, was allowed his first trip outside the Soviet Union after
years of agitation over Soviet human rights policies.
   Americans vigorously agitated for their own causes. More than
5,000 people were arrested in anti-abortion protests that began in
July in 32 cities and continued through the year. Roe vs. Wade, the
Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion, turned 15 years old,
intact.
   Anthony McLeod Kennedy, confirmed as a Supreme Court justice by a
unanimous Senate, inherited a pivotal vote on the abortion issue but
gave no hint of his views.
   Court dockets bulged with the celebrated cases of the
once-powerful.
   Former Philippine President Ferdinand E. Marcos and his wife,
Imelda, were indicted on racketeering charges alleging they
plundered their homeland of millions and defrauded U.S. banks. Harry
and Leona Helmsley, the king and queen of New York real estate,
pleaded innocent to dozens of tax evasion charges.
   Republican Evan Mecham of Arizona became the first governor in a
half-century to be impeached and removed from office, although he
was acquitted on criminal charges of concealing a $350,000 campaign
loan.
   Oliver North, John Poindexter, Richard Secord and Albert Hakim
pleaded innocent to charges of defrauding the government by selling
arms to Iran and giving the proceeds to the Contras at a time when
U.S. aid to the Nicaraguan rebels was banned.
   Congress refused to restore military aid to the Contras but
decided to approve humanitarian aid after the Nicaraguan rebels and
the Sandinista government reached a temporary truce.
   In a decision that stunned Israel, President Reagan authorized
talks with Yasser Arafat's Palestine Liberation Organization for the
first time in at least 13 years. ``Our object is not a dialogue,''
Secretary of State George P. Shultz said. ``Our object is peace.''
   Uneasy peace prevailed in the 8-year-old Iran-Iraq War after a
United Nations-sponsored cease-fire began Aug. 20. Peace talks
opened five days later; they were deadlocked within 24 hours. In
Afghanistan, Soviet troops began a withdrawal in 1988, but the
guerrilla war raged on.

   When it comes to bridal fashions, the word is options.
   A bride can choose a ball gown, a country dress, a sheath or a
tailored suit, say designers and editors who work in the bridal
field. There are no rules, only guidelines.
   She can look demure, like Cinderella at the ball or _ in a
departure from tradition _ alluring in a strapless or
off-the-shoulder dress with a low-cut neckline. Dresses with jackets
and detachable trains also make it easier to go from religious
service to post-ceremony party with maximum comfort.
   Holly McMunn, of Bridal Originals, says there are more choices in
fabrics, style and color for brides than at any time in the recent
past. She sees several strong directions.
   ``One type of bride wants a simple dress in a classic silhouette
_ a princess, empire or sheath style. Another type chooses an
elaborate dress,'' she says. There is also a demand for the fashion
statement dress _ particularly by older brides who may be remarrying
_ that reflects silhouettes currently in style, she says.
   While white and ivory remain the colors chosen by the
overwhelming number of brides, soft tinges of color are becoming
more popular, agree Modern Bride and Bride's magazine fashion
editors. One new tinge is ice-blue on satin dresses, which imparts a
silvery sheen to white.
   Still popular are color-themed weddings, in which a particular
color scheme is carried through in flowers and decorations, wedding
party attire, table linen, plates, even party favors.
   Some favored schemes include black and white, and white and a
deep tone such as hot pink, coral or strong turquoise. For spring
and summer, pastels such as mint and lemon yellow are popular.
   Cindy Rose, fashion director for Vogue-Butterick Patterns, says
the latest styles are available in sew-it-yourself patterns. Some
examples include dresses with bows at the shoulder or waist,
ruffles, leg-o-mutton sleeves and even modified bustles.
   According to Rose, ``Bridal dresses are frankly not as innocent
as they used to be _ with bustles and low necklines, they do call
attention to a woman's figure. Many brides want to look like a sexy
woman so the dresses they select have more style.''
   An advantage to having a home-sewn dress is the opportunity to
customize it with, for example, a detachable train, snap-off sleeves
or a coat, jacket or bolero.
   In keeping with the variety of bridal dresses, accessories are
similarly wide-ranging, according to fashion reports by Bride's and
Modern Bride.
   Modern Bride notes the popularity of hats, sprays of flowers for
the hair and bows worn at the back of the head. Bride's says jewelry
for the bride has become more dramatic than it used to be. Seen on
more brides are drop earrings, charm bracelets and antique pins and
earrings.
   For bridesmaids, dresses in floral prints and polka dots with low
necklines or halters worn under jackets are popular. For the mother
of the bride and the groom, soft pastel colors in fabrics like lace,
velvet, silk moire and taffeta are more popular than the glittery
dresses of several seasons ago.
   Rose says the use of expensive details such as re-embroidered
fabric for brides and their attendants is also growing.

   A Bride's magazine survey of florists across the country found
several new trends in wedding flowers.
   The most significant trend in bridal flowers is toward bright,
hot colors, according to a New York floral designer. Bright blue
delphinium and corn flowers are becoming popular. Other colors: deep
crimson pink, purple, jewel tones. The all-white bouquet is also
popular, especially when the color scheme in white and black.
   Other flower trends: more hand-tied, loose and airy bouquets;
Victorian style flowers, lots of laces and beribboned tablecloths,
more tulle and netting in bouquets.

   The sartorial role of the groom and his attendants is to
complement the attire of the bride and her attendants, says Bill
Blass.
   The designer of women's couture and of men's suits and
sportswear, Blass says it is most important that the men's attire
should be appropriate for both the occasion and the women's dresses.
   For a simple country wedding, a morning coat would seem
exaggerated. For a city wedding, a navy blazer and white flannel
pants would be a little too casual.
   Choose clothing suited to your build, your age, the time of year
and occasion and the circumstances of the wedding, he advises. And
don't overdress, even though this may be the biggest day of your
life.
   To Blass, it is never appropriate for a man to look like the
little figure on the top of the wedding cake. Instead, he suggests
quiet, classic clothing for men. In winter, a tuxedo; in summer
perhaps a white dinner jacket.
   ``You can't go out and rent a character for the day of the
wedding. What is appropriate is what suits you,'' says Tom Fallon,
an associate of Blass. ``We see some tragic mistakes when we pass a
church and notice a groom in a powder-blue tuxedo with a ruffled
shirt. You can see they are mortified because the clothes have
nothing to do with their life.''
   Fashions for grooms and groomsmen don't change much over the
years, and that's fine with Blass. On the other hand, not everyone
takes quite the classic approach.
   According to Ken Hall of After Six, manufacturers of dress
clothes for men, grooms are becoming more adventurous in selecting
bridal attire. They are moving away from the traditional clothing of
the past four years.
   ``There is a groundswell of interest in more free-wheeling
design, such as jackets with much broader shoulders, mess jackets
with nipped-in short waists and elongated, slightly wider lapels on
jackets,'' he says.
   Shiny, textured fabrics, especially in medium tones of gray and
in black tone-on-tone fabrics, are popular. Gray is more often
chosen than it was in the recent past and in some areas of the
country, such as the Midwest, midnight blue dress clothes are also
``in.''
   Even in traditional styles, unorthodox fabrics, such as
herringbones, are being used for the suits. The fabrics were first
found on European brands but now many American manufacturers are
offering them, he says.
   Hall says other trends include the return of the low-cut,
three-button vest to match the jacket, and the growing popularity of
double-breasted jackets.
   Fabrics differ little from summer to winter; worsted wool is
first choice.

   Why not actually serve the cake as dessert at the wedding?
   Cake baker and author Rose Levy Beranbaum, who wrote ``The Cake
Bible,'' knows perfectly well why wedding cakes may be the least
appreciated portion of the wedding food: Most are not nearly as
tasty as they look.
   She says that the tradition of the tasteless wedding cake can be
banished by baking your own; she includes a section on how to bake
and decorate wedding cakes in her book.
   Beranbaum, who once made wedding cakes professionally as well as
teaching others how to do it, has put away her cake pans now that
her book is out. But she says that with two days to spare and a
certain amount of patience, the bride, a doting relative, or friend
can bake a cake to serve 150 in the ordinary home oven.
   She presents formulas for a variety of cakes and icings and shows
how to decorate and how to calculate quantities for virtually any
size cake. Though the labor is one of love, not economics, a
homemade wedding cake is almost sure to cost substantially less than
a bakery cake _ ``even if you blow $100 on white chocolate for the
icing.''
   The reason most people undertake such a project is to have a
unique cake, which may be white, golden, carrot, chocolate or
cheese. The only requirements are tiers and icing.
   Beranbaum says that while baking a large cake is not necessarily
harder than baking lots of small cakes, the methods vary. For
example, large cakes actually take proportionately less baking
powder than small cakes do.
   The larger cakes also have a tendency to get too brown at the
edges before the centers are done. Aluminum strips can be used to
retard browning the sides so the center can be cooked through.
   Some tips: Use cake flour, not all-purpose or self-rising flour.
Make sure that the butter is softened before it's added to the
batter. If it isn't, the cake mixture won't be aerated properly and
the cake will be tough and flat.
   Oven temperature is critical in baking a large cake. She advises
that before baking a large cake, bake a small one and see if it
takes longer than the recipe. ``A cake that bakes fast might be a
little humped, but a cake that bakes slowly will never be tender, so
raise the temperature in a slow-cooking oven,'' she says
   A tiered cake needs support. In commercial bakeries, the supports
are wood dowels. Plastic straws work fine at home, she says.
   The simplest wedding cake to make is a white or yellow butter
cake with butter-cream icing. ``Give it two full days _ one day to
make the components and one day to put them together and decorate
the cake,'' she says.
   You can make some decorations ahead of time. For example,
marzipan roses can be stored for years. Most cakes don't have to be
refrigerated overnight, she says.
   As for transporting the cake, she says that there are only two
people fit for the job: ``The person who made the cake or the person
who is paying for it.''
   The safe method is to place the cake in a box whose sides are
rigid and keep the largest bottom layer from touching the sides.
Provided there are not too many bumps on the ride, the cake should
survive without a blemish.
   The cake that launched Beranbaum's reputation was a four-tiered
creation covered in what looked like dotted swiss fabric with a trim
of roses. She developed it for Bon Appetit magazine as an example of
what could be done at home.
   ``That cake changed my life,'' she says. ``I got so many calls I
decided to teach intensive classes in special occasion cake-baking.''
   The information she compiled for the classes and the experiences
she had baking the wedding cakes led her to develop the formulas and
expertise that are found in her book.

   Wedding traditions that once were thought old-hat are back.
   ``Bridal couples are getting pleasure by doing things the
old-fashioned way,'' according to Barbara Tober, editor of Bride's
magazine.
   For example, she says, ``calligraphy once again is in fashion for
invitations and people are thinking of toasts in advance and caring
about the fact that someone should say something at the reception.
   ``Couples are embracing the idea of dressing up, sending out
invitations in advance, putting announcements in the newspaper. They
have music, they carry flowers, they say their vows. Brides are
having attendants, throwing bouquets, wearing a garter and cutting
the cake,'' she says.
   The once-overlooked personal letter of thanks to friends and
family for wedding gifts is again in favor. Though pre-printed
thank-you cards are available, etiquette experts agree that the
sincere and courteous way of expressing thanks is with a
hand-written note.
   As the arbiter of the '80s, Judith ``Miss Manners'' Martin, put
it: ``The only time a handwritten thank-you note is not necessary is
when no wedding present has been received.''
   According to the Bride's Book of Etiquette, another exception to
the requirement for a note is acknowledging gifts from parents or a
spouse. However, it's also duly noted that parents and spouse will
appreciate a special letter of thanks.
   For all other thank-yous, the first requirement is to keep a
thorough and reliable gift record.
   Keep track of gifts in a wedding journal, a notebook, index cards
or even on a computer. Record the gift along with the name and
mailing address of the giver so it will be simpler to get the
thank-you note on its way quickly. Indicate when you've mailed it,
so you won't overlook any.
   While it has been traditional for the bride to acknowledge all
gifts, today it's also quite acceptable for the groom to share the
responsibility by writing to those whom he knows best.
   Etiquette requires the use of folded note paper in white, ivory
or the shade of the wedding invitation. The stationery can be plain
or embossed or printed with your name or initials. But the bride
shouldn't send stationery imprinted with her married name until
after she is married.
   A note should mention the gift and refer specifically to
something about it, such as its usefulness or style. If you are not
quite sure what the gift is, compliment an unusual or unique feature
such as color material. Mention your spouse's name in the note
since, as a rule, only the writer will sign it. Conclude with a
friendly closing sentence.
   The timetable for thank-yous calls for a note within two weeks of
the arrival of the gift. If the gift arrives on the wedding day or
during the honeymoon it should be sent within a month after the
honeymoon, says Bride's.
   A good reason for writing notes a few at a time is that it's
easier to make the words of thanks spontaneous and sincere than if
you tackle several dozen notes at once.
   If you expect to receive more gifts than you think you can
acknowledge right away, you can send printed cards to let donors
know the gift arrived safely and follow up with a personal note as
soon as possible.

   ``The champagne toast is one of the few times during the
reception when someone other than the bride and groom has center
stage,'' says Michel La Croix, chef de cave at Piper-Heidsieck.
Traditionally, the best man offers the first toast to the couple,
but others may do so.
   Whoever gives the toast should agree on the message with the
groom ahead of time.
   LaCroix's tips for a toast:
   The toast takes place after the bride and groom have been
received and the guests have taken their seats.
   The person giving the toast stands to the right of the couple
while the newlyweds remain seated.
   The groom rises after the toast and offers another to his bride
and her family. The bride may respond by welcoming the groom into
her family.
   Guests usually stand for the toast.

   When the wedding is over, the honeymoon is supposed to begin. But
most couples discover that the honeymoon phase doesn't last out the
first year of marriage, says psychotherapist Arlene Modica Matthews.
   The author of ``Why Did I Marry You, Anyway?'' (Houghton Mifflin)
says that some couples panic when they realize they aren't going to
live together without conflict. They shouldn't. ``Negative emotions
are a normal part of living with another human being and `happily
ever after' is a fiction,'' she says.
   The fact that most divorces take place in the first three years
of marriage shows that an unrealistic idealization of marriage can
be harmful.
   ``Any little disappointment makes them think they were wrong.
Since divorce is now socially acceptable, they take the easy way
out. Then they go out and marry the same kind of person again,'' she
says.
   By knowing what to expect and focusing on methods of
communicating in the first year of marriage, couples can resolve
inevitable stresses, which in turn gives the marriage strength to
endure.
   In an interview and in her book, Matthews identified a
three-stage pattern similar to the steps a baby takes along the
pathway to independence.
   In the first stage, each believes the other can fill all
emotional needs. It's soon succeeded by the realization that some of
your needs won't be instantly met: ``You start to think you made a
mistake, that your spouse tricked you.
   ``The third stage is to join the images and realize that your
spouse is an integrated human who has foibles and flaws as well as
wonderful traits. Ideally, you both emerge with a sense of constancy
in which you believe that the marriage will endure in good times and
bad,'' she says.
   ``This generation thinks it is a good idea to be completely open
when you are angry. Fights are healthier than sitting on your
negative feelings for a year and then simply leaving. But you have
to know how to reveal your feelings.
   ``Ask yourself: Is my spouse going to be receptive to hear this
now, and how can I phrase it so he or she will not feel unduly
attacked.
   ``Start your sentences with I _ as in `I feel hurt being ignored
at a party.' Stick with the issue at hand; don't make it a laundry
list of everything that's ever bothered you.''
   She says old-fashioned rules of politeness should not be
abandoned as soon as the wedding finery is taken off. The politeness
of courtship can be continued to a great degree and it is usually a
bad idea to be completely honest all the time.
   Between money and sex, she identified money as the more
troublesome issue. ``Most courting couples have terrific sex lives
but money is a taboo. All of us have learned illogical ways of
dealing with money and, because we are marrying later, we are used
to managing money. Two quirky patterns that are different create a
real problem.''
   Strategies for coping include hiring a financial consultant to
help you de-emotionalize the situation or even separating finances.
Many couples make the mistake of coming together financially without
discussing their differing patterns. She says it may make more sense
to start out separately and come together with more understanding
later on.
   Though sex is less likely to be a bone of contention in these
days of more open discussion, she says that it's normal for the
frequency of activity to decline after marriage.
   No matter what the problem, Matthews says that flexibility
usually helps solve it. ``The people who will adjust best to
marriage are those willing to try new ways of behavior in order to
figure out what they want and how to get it,'' she says.

   It sometimes seems as if Americans are marrying earlier and more
often.
   Statistics show that 36 percent of the weddings today are
remarriages, according to Bride's magazine.
   Furthermore, says Barbara Tober, editor of the magazine, half of
all Americans divorce and remarry in their lifetime and the majority
of women who divorce remarry within about three years.
   Paradoxically, even though ``they are trying very hard not to
divorce and to pick the right friend, partner and pal, if they
don't, they cannot stay in the marriage in these days of lengthened
lifespan and vigor,'' says Tober.
   According to Cele Lalli, editor of Modern Bride, one of the most
striking changes in recent years has been in attitudes towards
remarrying.
   ``In the past, one didn't advertise a remarriage; one just
unobtrusively did it. Today, people flaunt it. There is no sin in
making a mistake and it is wonderful to find happiness,'' she says.
   Weddings that are remarriages are being planned with just as much
dedication as the first-time wedding, but there are some
differences, agreed these authorities.
   For one thing, the couples usually make the arrangements and pay
for the wedding themselves. For another, if there are children from
an earlier marriage, they are often part of the wedding.
   The remarriage wedding may well be smaller than the average first
wedding today, but not always.
   Many of the parties are elaborate evening events with dinner and
dancing, says Lalli.
   According to Tober, a second or third wedding is often a more
intense though quieter event. There may be a much closer bond
between the couple and the guests they choose to invite. ``The
guests are often people who have been supportive during a divorce or
widowhood. They accept the new relationship. They are the people you
want in your life in the future,'' she says.
   Ralph Lamacchia, who produces bridal shows, says that companies
providing wedding services are now paying more attention to the
remarriage wedding market. Based on his observations of these events
at which a mix of local service providers and national companies
sell their wares, he says that ``couples seem more clear-minded
about the type of wedding they want.''
   The bride tends to choose a more practical dress that can be used
for other occasions, or at least she will buy a dress that reflects
her fashion style. The party is more likely to be at home or in a
restaurant, not at a catering hall or a hotel ballroom. Photography
is likely to be more creative and candid. They aren't going for
multiple albums.
   Wedding announcements and invitations tend to be less formal and
sometimes humorous. People are still self-conscious even though the
taboos have diminished quite a bit. He says that nonsectarian
ceremonies are more common at second-time weddings.
   Tober says that at remarriages, the issues of etiquette can be
more difficult to settle. For example, she says she receives letters
concerned with dissension in the family, such as where to seat
factions of the family, whether to invite former in-laws and how or
whether to include the children in the wedding.
   ``When I am asked if kids should be in the wedding, I say, `Are
they going to be in the marriage?' If they are, then have them in
the wedding. We even suggest that couples go on a honeymoon alone
first but have the children join them later,'' she says.

   A little help from their new friends in the bridal registry is
what couples-to-be are relying on in these days of greater interest
in home entertaining, but less time for shopping.
   Typically, the registrar helps coordinate dinnerware, flatware
and stemware patterns and also takes the bride _ increasingly
accompanied by the groom _through an ever-expanding list of choices
to make in other categories. Gift-givers use the registry to select
a gift that's wanted by the couple.
   The return to traditional weddings carries over in choices young
couples are making for their crystal, silver and china, say registry
directors in department and specialty shops. For example, there's a
renewed interest in crystal among bridal consumers, according to
Cleverley Stone, bridal registry director at B. Altman's in New York.
   She says that brides are registering for more items than they
used to, including candlesticks, vases and pitchers. They're
choosing more expensive stems, too. The average price per glass is
between $27 and $35. Many register for two stemware patterns to go
with the two sets of dinnerware that they select.
   Besides the silverware, fine china and crystal that are
traditionally listed, the nation's estimated 5,000 bridal gift
registries are increaslngly listing more unusual gifts desired by
brides and grooms-to-be.
   Some examples on recent lists include exercise equipment,
bicycles, fully-stocked picnic baskets, home electronic equipment
such as camcorders and computers, cooking appliances such as ice
cream makers and pasta machines, and art objects.
   There are, however, some distinct geographic differences.
California couples are registering for patio furniture, garden
tools, beach umbrellas, barbecue grills and bikes, according to Rose
Nahabedian, registry director at The Broadway in Glendale, Calif.
   ``Couples don't always register for fine crystal and china. Many
of my clients tell me they want to purchase those items later on in
their marriage,'' she says.
   In New York, art objects and handcrafts such as one-of-a-kind
serving dishes are popular with couples registering at Saks Fifth
Avenue's gift department.
   Another New York area trend is registering at non-traditional
shops such as Dean & Deluca, a gourmet food shop. A source at the
store noted that couples come to register for everything from pots
and pans to cooking tools. Also popular are gift certificates for
specialty foods.
   All over the country, interest in ethnic foods has enlarged the
range of utensils newlyweds want, says Anne Kupper, national
spokesman for the gourmet gadget chain of Williams-Sonoma. Pasta
machines, paella pans, even nutmeg and cheese graters are registry
items with this chain,.
   ``In the 15 years I've been with the company, I've seen some
things that haven't been listed for years come back _ like fondue
pots and pressure cookers, which make it possible for working
couples to cook quickly,'' says Kupper.
   Although it's customary to include inexpensive as well as
big-ticket items on a wish list, Michelle Kahn, bridal registry
director at Neiman Marcus in White Plains, N.Y., says that ``a
wedding celebration is one occasion for which you needn't be shy
about extravagant requests.''
   Some couples have registered for one-of-a-kind crafts such as a
$3,000 punch bowl by Dorothy Hafner or trendy silver, china and
crystal such as that bearing the Swid Powell label.
   With couples' wish lists growing more varied, the nation's bridal
arbiters are advising gift givers to be more original, too. Barbara
Tober, editor of Bride's magazine, says wedding guests should give
something the couple want, but also should personalize their gift.
   For example, a donor might match up wine goblets and wine, a
requested teapot with a basket of exotic herbal teas,, fragrant
soaps with chosen bath towels, family photos with a selected silver
frame, a set of parfait dishes with an ice cream maker, or a crystal
vase and a gift certificate for flowers-of-the-month.

   You're getting married in a month or two and you find yourself
daydreaming about all the things that might go wrong at the wedding
and in the marriage. Does this mean you should call the whole thing
off?
   No, say two authorities who have talked to many brides and
grooms. Jerilynn Ross, president of the Phobia Society of America,
says that it's normal and appropriate to worry about the unknown.
   Cele Lalli, editor of Modern Bride, sees the realization of
potential conflict as a sign of maturity in the age of divorce. Both
say it isn't the worries you should worry about, but what you do
about them.
   In a recent seminar she conducted for Bride's, Ross noticed both
brides and grooms-to-be had more fears than they realized and hadn't
discussed them.
   ``Merely learning that others worried about similar fears made
the participants feel better because they had felt their worries
were unique. In many instances, the partner was surprised to learn
of the fears,'' she says.
   This observation led her to conclude that communicating worries
may be all that's needed to relieve them. ``Even if you need to go a
third person such as a therapist or religious leader to get the
worry out, it's best to reveal it,'' says the psychologist who
counsels at Roundhouse Square Phobia Treatment Center in Alexandria,
Va.
   Lalli says that because couples getting married now are generally
older than couples in the recent past, there are more potential
wedding conflicts between them and the way their parents do things.
She sees this as a plus, not a drawback.
   ``That's what marriage is all about _ separating from the family.
Working out conflicts that may develop over the wedding is the often
the first opportunity to act as a couple,'' she says.
   One reason why worries may be more overt but less troubling is
that there is wider latitude in what's considered acceptable and
greater awareness of a need to communicate. Couples are less
inhibited about talking about conflicts, says Lalli.
   In general, both women agreed that issues that couples worry
about fall into one of two main categories: practical concerns
relating to the ceremony and party and philosophical concerns about
the durability of the bond they are assuming.
   Today's different way of life has created both the problem and
its solution. For example, higher costs force different financial
arrangements.
   ``Traditionally, the bride's family paid for just about
everything. Practically speaking today, that is difficult. If both
families want an extravaganza, they are more flexible about paying
for it. The traditional guidelines are not relevant,'' says Lalli.
   ``Because of greater mobility and fact that couples often meet
and live in a city other than the one where the bride grew up,
there's often some concern about where to have the wedding. Today,
the right decision is what is most convenient and least expensive,''
she says.
   Ross characterized most worries of couples about to be married as
normal worries about the future. It's only if the worries become
irrational, involuntary and inappropriate that phobia _ a
psychiatric disorder _ is involved.
   Despite role changes in recent years, Ross says men and women at
the seminar she conducted worried along traditional lines.
   ``The women all talked about their fears of being a good mother.
They felt the children were their primary responsibility. The men
talked about their fears of being the sole support of a family,''
she says.

   One effect of marrying later is that each partner is likely to
have been living independently. Marriage is therefore not merely a
merger of two people; it's also the combination of two sets of
household effects.
   Moving two people into one home is far from an effortless
endeavor. But you'll accomplish the feat more easily if you plan
ahead, make lists _ and learn how to pack and load a truck.
   According to Joann Alencikas, manager of customer services at
Ryder Truck Rental, it's wise to start about four weeks ahead of
time to organize the details of the move. Even those hiring a mover
should make an inventory of what they each have. The list can be
used to plan what to get rid of, what new items are needed and
finally to estimate the size truck required to move belongings.
   Those renting a truck should reserve it well in advance. During
busy summer weekends, the peak period of demand, a month is not too
long. At other times, a week or two is usually sufficient.
   When making a reservation, be prepared with a list of what you
need to move so you can get the right size truck. Rental trucks
range in size from a 1O-footer with 295 cubic feet or room for one
roomful of belongings to a 24-footer for seven rooms of furnishings.
A 15-foot van provides about 750 cubic feet of storage or three to
four rooms of furnishings.
   The majority of moves in the United States are do-it-yourself
moves, accordiing to Alencikas, primarily because of cost savings.
As an example, she says, it might cost about $420 to rent a 15-foot
van for a one-way move from New York to Boston, compared to about
$1,000 based on standard tariffs discounted at 30 percent for the
same move via a van line.
   You'll also be able to rent protective wrapping and hand trucks
and to buy bubble pack and cartons from do-it-yourself rental
companies, or, of course, you can save money by recycling
supermarket boxes and bubble wrap from wedding presents.
   Two to four weeks ahead of time, make an inventory and start to
pack and label possessions; close and open charge and bank accounts;
turn utilities on and off, and notify the old and new post offices
of your new address.
   Two weeks before the move, it's time to start packing.
   On moving day, it's time to start loading the truck.
   Some tips: Load the truck one-quarter at a time, solid from floor
to ceiling. Tie off each quarter with sturdy rope. Don't leave any
open spaces since a tight fit keeps the load from shifting and
protects goods from breakage. Fill in spaces with small boxes. Load
the heaviest items, such as major appliances, first.

   When Aimee Gauthier and Mike Reed wed last fall in Stamford,
Conn., her hobby of collecting 1930s and 1940s tableware and vintage
tablecloths and napkins occupied center stage.
   The tables holding the wedding feast were covered with the
tablecloths and set with her mixed collection of colorful Depression
glass and Fiestaware. The menu consisted mainly of food made by the
bride.
   It was a prime example of couples planning their wedding as a
very personal event.
   Gauthier-Reed says colorful tables are conducive to a festive
atmosphere. Though unassuming and not normally for a formal table,
the settings were a delightful surprise to guests at her wedding,
she says.
   Gauthier-Reed, a 25-year-old graphic artist, says she learned
some of her stylish ways by working as an assistant to Martha
Stewart, the food stylist and author of books on party-giving,
including ``Weddings.''
   She put Stewart's lessons on color to use at her own wedding to
create a relatively inexpensive event that was nevertheless original.
   The menu included a salad of thinly-sliced filet of beef and red
and yellow peppers, carrots and snow peas in vinaigrette dressing.
There was also tortellini salad with pesto, sesame noodles, tomato
and red onion salad and broccoli.
   Table garnishes included a mix of black, purple, red, yellow,
green and orange peppers and edible nasturtium flowers.
   ``We didn't have fancy food, just a simple menu of homemade food.
But everyone said it was the most elegant wedding they had gone to.
I think the table settings had a lot to do with that. It was a
unique way of expressing ourselves,'' she says.
   So pleased was she with the wedding and the enjoyment she got out
of using her rapidly-enlarging collection of dinnerware and
tablecloths from the 1930s and early '40s that she decided the
experience held the seeds of a new business idea.
   She has launched a business renting the pieces to others for
parties and special occasions.
   ``Depression glass was the poor person's colored crystal. It was
given away as a bonus when people bought their groceries. You could
also buy it for about a quarter a place setting,'' she says.
   Formerly scorned and found in junk shops, Depression glass and
other old favorites such as Fiestaware and Fire King dishes now
command good prices and are getting harder to find.
   Though her new business is unusual, it is not unique, she says.
She came across the idea in California where it appears to have
originated.
   ``I realized this business could be the perfect solution. I would
earn money to support our collecting and, after renting it out, I'd
get the whole collection back at the end of the day,'' she says.

   With wedding ceremonies as varied as they are these days, walking
down the aisle to a different drummer can be a most creative
experience.
   The American Music Conference has some ideas to consider when
planning music for the nuptial rites:
   _ If the wedding is in a religious setting, be sure to check with
the clergy or music director to determine what types of music are
allowed.
   _ If a music advisor or wedding planner is not available, talk to
friends involved in music, or music students at a local college.
   _ Resist the temptation to choose musical selections only because
you like them; the music should not distract from the ceremony, no
matter how beautiful or entertaining.
   _ If you choose a traditional wedding selection, like Wagner's
``Bridal Chorus'' or Mendelsohn's ``Wedding March,'' consider a
non-traditional grouping of instruments. Guitars, string ensembles
or electronic instruments can offer a different approach.
   _ To personalize the ceremony, ask friends who can sing or play
musical instruments well to participate. (However, if family and
friends aren't musical, paying for the performance is worthwhile.)
   _ Position musicians and singers near the front and to the side _
where they can be heard but won't upstage the wedding couple.
   _ Keep the music program simple. Experimentation is best left to
another time.
   The American Music Conference is a non-profit organization that
encourages participation in amateur music-making.

   For Bob Page, it started out as a hobby, visiting this estate
sale and that flea market.
   ``I was buying and selling pieces primarily as a diversion,'' he
says. ``Soon, people were asking me to be on the lookout for
particular patterns to replace pieces that had been broken or lost.''
   That was the beginning of what is now Replacements Ltd., a
Greensboro, N.C., company that specializes in discontinued china and
crystal patterns.
   Page, formerly an auditor for the state of North Carolina,
started the business in 1981 and now has an inventory of more than 1
million pieces of 20,000 patterns, and a network of 1,000 buyers.
The company buys and sells china and crystal by mail, phone order,
and direct purchase.
   For those who don't know the name of their china or crystal
pattern, Page suggests mailing a photocopy, with notes on colors and
markings. Or, for unidentified crystal, wrap a piece of tissue paper
around the glass and make a rubbing of any etchings with a soft-lead
pencil, he says. Then sketch the crystal's stem.

   William Karls, an autoworker for more than
nine years, isn't expecting to enjoy much of the $45,000 he won in
the state lottery.
   After paying overdue child support, taxes and bills, Karls says
he'll have $6,000 left for himself. But that will dwindle after he
and about 5,000 other workers see their jobs vanish at the Chrysler
Corp. plant here this week.
   ``For some of the workers, the shock still hasn't hit them yet,''
said Karls, 32. ``For some, it's not going to hit until the day (the
plant) closes.''
   Chrysler announced in January that it would end auto production
in Kenosha by the end of the year, laying off 5,500 workers, because
the plant is outmoded. The plant, which began making cars
commercially in 1902, builds the Omni-Horizon, Chrysler Fifth
Avenue, Dodge Diplomat and Plymouth Gran Fury.
   The announcement prompted outrage from workers and government
officials, who said Chrysler pledged to continue making cars in
Kenosha for five years when the company bought the plant from
American Motors Corp. in 1987.
   The union filed a lawsuit against Chrysler but withdrew it amid
negotiations over the shutdown. Gov. Tommy Thompson also threatened
to sue but eventually accepted a multimillion-dollar settlement.
   Chrysler officials said they may have been guilty of
over-optimism in stating that car production would continue, but
insisted they made no promises.
   Car production ends officially on Friday. Chrysler will continue
to employ about 1,000 of the most senior workers for engine assembly.
   Many of those losing their jobs said they will have to settle for
lower-paying and less stable work. Some already have been laid off.
   ``I'm 36 and everything has been pulled out from under me,'' said
Jackie Strecker, who has worked at the plant for 16 years. ``But
I'll survive. Most of us will.''
   Strecker sold her home in October to get money in case she needs
to move. She's also among 2,200 senior employees who will receive
full pay until a $20 million job bank provided by Chrysler as part
of the settlement with the union is depleted.
   With unemployment compensation, Strecker figures she should keep
receiving some income for six months. ``By that time, I'll have my
head together enough,'' she said, adding that she hopes to take
classes so she can start a business.
   Carol Tucks, who started working at the plant in 1979, signed
papers with her husband on a $20,000 car Jan. 27, the same day
Chrysler announced its pullout.
   The couple had felt secure because of their combined incomes. But
the announcement halted their plans to buy a new home and have
children.
   ``It's almost like the American dream is slipping through our
fingers,'' Tucks said.
   ``I am still very bitter at Chrysler,'' said Kenosha County
Executive John Collins. ``It was the fact that they pumped
everyone's hopes up. People went out and bought homes and cars.''
   Amid the bitter feelings toward Chrysler, a network of state,
local and company initiatives has emerged to soften the blow.
   Chrysler has diverted profits from 1988 Wisconsin car sales into
a trust fund _ estimated at $24 million _ to help workers and their
families meet housing and education costs.
   As part of the settlement with the state, Chrysler is providing
an executive to assist southeastern Wisconsin communities in
attracting jobs.
   An assistance center at the local United Auto Workers
headquarters is offering help with employment searches, job training
and basic education.
   Earl Welch, 41, hopes to get work repairing engines after he
finishes job training. ``To go from $14 an hour to around $8 an hour
is a big drop,'' he said. ``But you have to figure $8 an hour is
better than nothing.''

   South Korea said one of its goals for
1989 is to pare down its current account surplus to $9.5 billion
from this year's projected $13.8 billion.
   The Economic Planning Board said in its economic management plan
Monday that the proposed reduction would be achieved partly through
more liberal import regulations.
   South Korea has pledged to further open its markets to foreigners
to avoid trade friction from the United States and other countries
that have trade deficits with the nation.
   The planning board predicted that imports will rise about 24
percent next year to $65 billion, while exports will increase about
17 percent to $70 billion.
   The board also predicted the economy would grow by about 8
percent next year, compared with the 12.1 percent forcasted for this
year. It attributed the decline to the anticipated slowdown in
exports.

   Despite large November increases for gasoline
and heating oil, the government says wholesale prices continue to

predictions of a mounting inflation problem.
   Wholesale prices edged up just 0.3 percent in November as food
costs at the wholesale level showed no increases for the second
straight month, the Labor Department said Friday.
   The November increase, if it persisted for 12 months, would
amount to an annual inflation rate of just 3.3 percent, lower than
the 3.8 percent annualized rate for the first 11 months of 1987.

<TEXT>
   West Point-Pepperell Inc. said Monday that
it would hold a special shareholders' meeting in February to discuss
Farley Inc.'s unsolicited $1.4 billion bid.
   Farley, the Chicago-based maker of Fruit of the Loom underwear,
Acme boots and several other apparel brands, had pushed for the
meeting.
   Farley holds a 9.8 percent stake in Pepperell but says more than
50 percent of the company's stock already has been tendered to it
under its $48-a-share cash offer. The bid is contingent upon
Pepperell's ``poison pill'' anti-takeover defense being overturned,
either in court or by a vote of Pepperell board of directors.
   Farley is trying to replace Pepperell directors with a slate more
favorable to its takeover effort.
   Pepperell said in a statement Monday that its board probably will
meet later this week and is expected to set the shareholders'
meeting for Feb. 25.
   Pepperell, based in West Point, Ga., is the country's largest
publicly held textile manufacturer. It's brands include Gold Toe
socks, Arrow shirts and Martex towels.

<TEXT>
   The number of working oil and gas rigs increased
by eight to total 930 this week, marking the second consecutive week
the rig count has posted a gain, Baker Hughes Inc. reported Monday.
   Last week the count increased by 17 to 922. A year ago the count
was 1,168, Baker Hughes said.
   The count is a widely watched industry index of drilling activity
and reflects the number of rigs actively exploring for oil as of
last Friday, not the number of rigs actively producing oil.
   Houston-based Hughes Tool Co., an oil toolmaking company that
merged with Baker International Corp. of Orange, Calif., has kept
track of the number of working rigs since 1940.
   In December 1981, at the height of the oil boom, the rig count
reached a peak of 4,500. But oil prices plunged to less than $10 per
42-gallon barrel in the summer of 1986, prompting a collapse in the
rig count that bottomed out at 663 _ the lowest since Hughes began
compiling figures.
   The lowest level this year was the reported 880 rigs on May 2.
   Among major oil producing states, the biggest gains were posted
by Louisiana with four additional rigs, followed by Ohio, three;
Colorado, Kansas, Michigan, North Dakota, Oklahoma and Wyoming with
two each; and California, one.
   Texas had the greatest decline with 17 fewer rigs and New Mexico
dropped by one. Pennsylvania was unchanged from the previous week.

   Grain and soybean futures prices opened mixed to
mostly lower today on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Traders cited three factors for slipping prices, but singled out
confirmation of a big export deal to the Soviet Union as the main
culprit.
   Rumors that the Soviets would buy 400,000 tons of soymeal and 2.5
million tons of corn pushed prices higher on Friday. That in turn
prompted increased farmer selling over the weekend _ a second factor
pressuring prices today.
   But commodities also were hurt by reports of rain over the
weekend in the bean growing regions of South America and a forecast
calling for more during the week ahead.
   On the opening, wheat was 1{ cents lower to \ cent higher, with
the contract for delivery in December at $4.36 a bushel; corn was 1\

   Pillsbury Co. gave up its 2{-month fight and
agreed to a $5.68 billion takeover by British conglomerate Grand
Metropolitan PLC, two days after major courtroom setbacks.
   Grand Met will purchase all outstanding shares of Pillsbury
common stock for $66 per share in cash, $3 higher than Grand Met's
most recent tender offer, which was made last week.
   ``The shareholders got much, much more money than either the
marketplace was offering or Pillsbury's restructuring offered,''
Karl Cambronne, a lawyer for dissident Pillsbury shareholders.``I
think the shareholders did well.''
   Lawyers, investment bankers and company officials worked out the
deal's details Saturday and Sunday, and Pillsbury's board approved
the deal Sunday afternoon.
   On Friday, a judge in Delaware, where Pillsbury is incorporated,
issued preliminary injunctions to invalidate Pillsbury's ``poison
pill'' takeover defense and temporarily block the company's planned
spinoff of its Burger King Corp. Grand Met requested the rulings.
   Ruling in a separate lawsuit filed by dissident Pillsbury
shareholders, a Minnesota judge also temporarily blocked the Burger
King spinoff and said he probably would invalidate the ``pill.''
   Pillsbury decided to deal because the ``pill,'' its only
bargaining chip, was gone, said Stephen Carnes, an analyst with
Piper Jaffray & Hopwood in Minneapolis.
   Pillsbury common stock was trading at $39 a share the day before
Grand Met launched its $60-per-share hostile takeover bid Oct. 4.
Pillsbury's stock closed at 62\ Friday on the New York Stock
Exchange. It opened today at 65\.
   ``The price is fair,'' Carnes said. ``It's a good thing from
several standpoints. (The takeover fight has) been drawn out too
long. I think it's had an effect on the operations at Pillsbury, so
maybe (Grand Met) can start putting that back together quickly.''
   The takeover of Pillsbury is the latest in a wave of mergers and
recapitalizations that have swept through the foods industry in
recent years.
   It also comes less than a month after another giant of the
industry, RJR Nabisco, agreed to be taken over in a leveraged
buyout. The $25 billion deal was the largest in U.S. corporate
history.
   The tender offer made by Grand Met, the British real estate,
liquor and gambling conglomerate, expires at midnight Jan. 3 unless
extended, according to a statement issued by both companies.
   As of the close of business Friday, 61,848,918 of Pillsbury
common shares, representing about 72 percent of the company's more
than 86 million outstanding shares, had been tendered to Grand Met
and not withdrawn.
   Pillsbury's 15 board members urged stockholders to tender their
shares to Grand Met.
   ``We are pleased that we have succeeded in protecting the
interests of our shareholders, employees, franchisees and
communities, and that we have reached a negotiated agreement that
works to the advantage of everyone,'' said Philip L. Smith, chairman
and chief executive officer of Pillsbury.
   Ian A. Martin, chief executive of Grand Met's U.S. operations,
said Grand Met officials also are pleased with the agreement.
   ``Pillsbury is the perfect fit to enable Grand Metropolitan to
achieve its strategy of becoming a world leader in foods and
retailing, as well as the drinks sector,'' Martin said.
   Grand Met's products and services in the United States include
ALPO Petfoods and Pearle Vision Centres.
   Pillsbury, which started as Pillsbury Flour Mills with a single
flour mill in Minneapolis in 1869, makes Pillsbury flour, Green
Giant vegetables and a variety of other products. In addition to
Burger King, it owns Benningan's and Steak & Ale restaurant chains.
During the fiscal year that ended May 31, the company had nearly
$6.2 billion in revenues. It employs 104,000 people.
   Last month, Pillsbury announced it would make Burger King a
separate company, complete with its own board of directors and newly
issued stock. The spinoff was to occur today.
   The move had been widely viewed as a last-ditch effort by
Pillsbury to fend off Grand Met.

<HEAD>Leveraged Buyout Legacy: Stronger America or Debt Wasteland?</HEAD>

<BYLINE>By RICK GLADSTONE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It was a year that gave corporate debt a
frightening new dimension, a year in which everything from car
rentals to cheerleader outfits, TV Guide to Bloomingdale's, plumbing
supplies to paper towels, all somehow were affected by a
megabillion-dollar runup in borrowing.
   Within a few months of the worst stock market debacle in modern
times, American companies scrambled as never before to merge, spin
off, sell out, pare down and restructure _ all in the name of
efficiency, growth, competitiveness and long-term survival.
   The orgy of dealmaking, reminiscent of the 1920s corporate
borrowing binge that preceded the Great Depression, has raised
disturbing questions about the direction U.S. business will take as
it struggles to meet the mortgage.
   Since 1982, U.S. companies have doubled their debt to nearly $2
trillion. An estimated 25 percent of their cash flow is used to
service debt, money that theoretically could be used for investing
in research, training or expansion.
   In 1988 alone, the dollar amount of mergers and acquisitions
financed largely with borrowed money totaled more than $200 billion,
enough to wipe out the U.S. trade deficit and erase a good chunk of
Third World debt.
   Many economists are concerned about what will happen if highly
indebted companies someday cannot pay the interest they owe. They
say stores will shut, factories will close, tax revenues will
tumble, unemployment will soar.
   Some fear that the billions of dollars in investment needed to
keep American companies competitive could be sacrificed to pay debt,
giving foreign economic rivals such as the Japanese even more of an
edge.
   Others say bankers, insurers and pension funds that loaned the
money for takeovers will wind up holding securities that could sell
for 50 cents or less on the dollar _ a domestic version of the Third
World debt disaster.
   ``I must admit I view with alarm what's going on now,'' said
Sandra Shaber, an economist at the Futures Group, a Washington-based
consulting firm. ``These increased debt levels, if we go into
recession, would be quite worrisome.''
   The rising corporate debt already is rippling through the economy
in troubling ways, such as higher interest rates, increased
bankruptcies, layoffs and greater use of cheap part-time and
temporary workers to cut costs.
   Those 30 percent discount Christmas sales at Macy's and
Bloomingdale's haven't been meant to raise holiday cheer: The owners
of these stores need quick cash to service the enormous debt loads
of their restructured companies.
   When the diversified manufacturer Interco Inc. announced it was
closing two Florsheim shoe factories in early December, a huge debt
restructuring to thwart a hostile takeover was to blame.
   When workers of Trans World Airlines and Eastern Airlines asked
the government earlier this year to review whether the owners run
safe operations, they said high debt in those carriers were hurting
maintenance and preventing investment in new planes. Both airlines
were bought on borrowed money.
   Last July, the Revco D.S. drug chain became the first big
debt-financed takeover company to seek bankruptcy protection from
creditors. While it generates $100 million in cash a year, that's
nowhere near enough to service more than $1 billion in debt.
   ``It's our feeling that with the amount of money raised in the
buyout market in the last several years, the amount of deals done,
and the levels done, you're going to see a substantially greater
amount of defaulted and bankrupt companies coming out,'' said James
Bennett, chief executive officer of R.D. Smith & Co., a New York
firm that trades in distressed companies' bonds.
   Just in the last few months, Bennett says, the volume of
distressed bonds has equaled the total he'd seen in more than than
three years, and ``if you start to have a recessionary period,
there's going to be a ton of them.''
   The concern about corporate debt and its broader impact isn't
limited to economists, labor unions and bond traders. Even some of
the most aggressive promoters and beneficiaries of debt-financed
takeovers have expressed concern about whether the dealmaking has
gone too far.
   ``Today's financial age has become a period of unbridled excess
with accepted risk soaring out of proportion to possible reward,''
said Theodore J. Forstmann, head of the New York takeover firm
Forstmann, Little & Co.
   ``Every week, with ever-increasing levels of irresponsibility,
many billions of dollars in American assets are being saddled with
debt that has virtually no chance of being repaid.''
   Even as concern rises about the implications of rising corporate
debt, more managers are lining up lenders to help buy their
companies or prevent outsiders from doing so.
   A recent study by Drexel University finance professor George
Tsetsekos suggested that among companies that bought back their own
stock to boost share values after the October 1987 crash, one in
four was increasing debt levels, partly as an antitakeover move.
   Bank lenders, historically burned by bad real estate and Latin
American loans, haven't expressed much reticence about the latest
borrowing wave either, despite a blunt warning by Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan to carefully evaluate their takeover-loan
portfolios.
   A Fed survey earlier this year suggested that 15 percent of
commercial and industrial loans were related to mergers, and at some
big banks the figure was as high as 40 percent.
   One of the key catalysts in this new avalanche of debt is the
takeover tactic known as the leveraged buyout or LBO, in which a
buyer with practically no money can purchase a company using its
assets as collateral for loans, sell pieces of the company to repay
those loans and make a profit in the process.
   The result has often been a trimmed-down and highly efficient
private company liberated from the obligation of paying quarterly
dividends to shareholders and able to concentrate on its business.
But it may also result in so much indebtedness that management
becomes preoccupied with paying it back.

<HEAD>NEW YORK: ... paying it back.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The leveraged buyout has been extolled, denounced and intensely
debated. It has brought out both the best in management skill, the
worst in Wall Street greed and the concern of lawmakers.
   ``There's something seriously wrong when there's more of an
incentive for corporate managers to liquidate their own companies
for their own personal financial benefit than there is an incentive
for them to make the company more competitive,'' said Edward D.
Markey, D-Mass., one of several legislators expected to conduct
hearings into leveraged buyouts in 1989.
   Ironically, most ordinary American families probably don't even
notice how increased corporate debt is part of their daily routine.
Like an invisible gas, the leveraging of U.S. companies is subtle,
silent, gradual, everywhere.
   If they shop at Safeway, read TV Guide, rent a car from Avis, buy
Dolly Madison paper towels, shave with a Gillette Trac II, order
Goodyear radials for the car or install an American Standard
bathtub, some of their spending money goes to pay down an enormously
increased corporate debt.
   That's only a result of some of the biggest deals. The vast
majority of debt-financed restructurings affects smaller companies
rarely mentioned in the news but just as much a part of everyday
American life.
   For example, cheerleader uniforms supplied to most schools come
from Cheerleader Group Inc., a company formed from a $46 million LBO
engineered last June. Ten Midwest states use fire hydrants supplied
by Water Products Co., which underwent a $20 million management-led
debt restructuring in December.
   Despite the growing clamor about where all this debt is leading,
there are passionate defenders of LBOs who say the concept of debt
is widely misunderstood. In their view, debt is a tool, a way to
exploit money to maximum advantage, and should not be viewed as a
threat.
   ``One of the biggest missing ingredients in Congress right now is
information and understanding about LBOs,'' said Henry Kravis,
principal of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co., a small but powerful
investment firm that is the undisputed leader of the technique.
   ``We're not going to take the heart out of a corporation,'' he
told Fortune magazine in an interview. ``People who produce things
will stay. We look at the people who report to people who report to
people. We'll often cut fat at the corporate level.
   ``There'd be much less of this, and companies would be valued
more accurately, if chief executives felt the pressure from their
directors to do the cutting that they only do when they're
threatened by a takeover.''
   To a large degree, it was Kravis's firm that heightened the
controversy over debt-financed takeovers. Its biggest triumph so far
is the record $24.5 billion purchase of food-tobacco giant RJR
Nabisco Inc., announced Nov. 30 after a bidding brawl that some
considered a symbol of corporate gluttony.
   Many will be watching closely to see how RJR manages or even
survives under a quadrupled debt load of $23 billion. Some
forecasters believe Kohlberg's triumph also could become its
greatest defeat and help sour corporate America's appetite for
borrowed money.
   ``The Revco D.S. bankruptcy was a warning,'' said Robert H. Rock,
president of the Philadelphia-based business information firm MLR
Enterprises Inc., in the December issue of Corporate Restructuring,
an industry newsletter. ``The RJR Nabisco deal may lead us closer to
the brink.''

   The takeover wave that swept across the corporate
landscape in 1988 established new high-water marks for dealmakers
and obliterated the notion that some companies are invulnerable to
attack.
   ``A lot of companies thought they were safe because they were too
large,'' said portfolio manager Ernest Wiggins of the Fidelity Value
Fund in Boston.
   But after the megadeals reached in 1988 _ capped by the proposed
record $24.5 billion buyout of RJR Nabisco Inc. _ managers realized
``there is no such thing as being too big to be taken over,'' said
Michael Bradley, professor of finance and law at the University of
Michigan.
   Take the case of Edward P. Evans, who began the year as chairman
of Macmillan Inc. but left the publishing and information services
giant now owned by a British concern after one of the year's most
bruising takeover struggles.
   Evans had been given good marks by financial analysts for
improving the profitability of Macmillan since taking over in 1980.
   The stock market showed its appreciation by pushing the company's
stock price up more than 12-fold during his tenure. But it wasn't
nearly enough.
   The day before Macmillan's annual shareholders meeting last May,
a group led by Texan Robert Bass proposed a buyout at $64 a share, a
26 percent premium over the company's closing price that day.
   Six months later, Evans was gone and the company was no longer
independent despite deploying an arsenal of takeover defenses _ a
restructuring, hefty severance agreements for top executives, a
poison pill to deter hostile bidders and the assistance of a
friendly suitor.
   Company management recruited the acknowledged leader in the
leveraged buyout business in an effort to acquire the company itself
and was twice declared the winner in the bidding.
   But Evans ultimately lost to a persistent rival from Britain who
tripped him up in the courts and won the company by simply offering
more cash.
   William F. Reilly, Macmillan's president who was allied with
Evans but has stayed on after the acquisition by publisher Robert
Maxwell, says the defense strategy was like putting ``just a little
more glass on the bathroom floor.''
   It failed, he said, because ``nothing stops an all-cash offer.''
   Martin Sikora, editor of Mergers & Acquisitions magazine in
Philadelphia, said the value of takeover deals in 1988 may shatter
the record of nearly $205 billion set two years ago even though the
number of deals was down 16 percent through October from a year ago.
   He credits the growing presence of buyout funds _ set up
specifically to reap huge returns by buying an undervalued company
and either running it better or selling it in parts _ for driving
the stakes in the takeover wars higher. ``It has created competition
for deals,'' he said.
   Sikora estimates there is $25 billion to $30 billion invested in
such funds that could be used to borrow up to $300 billion for
takeovers.
   Fidelity's Wiggins said the huge amount of money expressly
earmarked for takeovers has enabled dealmakers to start considering
the larger companies as targets rather than simply the medium-sized
companies previously scrutinized.
   ``That's a lot better for me because the deepest discounts in
terms of market price versus private value is often in the big
capitalized stocks,'' Wiggins said.
   Peter Linneman, professor of finance in public policy at the
University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business, said recent
dealmaking shows how management's focus has shifted from running the
company well to getting returns for the shareholder.
   ``In the old days, management said it was its objective to
generate cash flow, and if the market doesn't see it, so be it ...
But what management has realized is, right or wrong, if the market
doesn't accurately reflect value, someone will come in who will,''
he said.
   Wiggins said he thinks the trend toward bigger deals should
continue, especially as foreign companies enter the fray more
heavily.
   Michigan's Bradley said the trend may depend on how the courts
ultimately view the growing efforts by various states to enact laws
giving corporate managements a veto over hostile takeovers.
   Linneman from Wharton said he doubts that Congress will amend the
tax laws to limit the deductibility of interest on money borrowed
for takeovers. ``You have corporate America on both sides of each
issue,'' he said.
   Charles Minter, a partner in the investment advisory firm
Comstock Partners, said the debt-financed buyout craze may turn out
to be a costly fad, like lending to the oil industry was in the
1970s.
   ``We see where the banks are lending their money, and stay away
from those areas,'' he said. ``There will be some deal that comes
along to break their backs.''

   Like the stock market crash of 1987, the Great
American Borrowing Binge of 1988 holds the potential for economic
disaster.
   But unlike the one-time shock of collapsing stock values _ which
the economy proved resilient enough to overcome _ the unprecedented
accumulation of debt threatens long-term indigestion.
   The economy's course is impossible to predict, of course. No one
knew when the current expansion began in 1982 that it would still be
going six years later, a peacetime record. The next recession may
turn out to be just a brief, mild slump.
   But some economists believe debt has made the economy so fragile,
the next time it falls, it may break rather than bend.
   ``What you have to worry about in all these things is whether
there's a serious threat of bank trouble,'' said Charles
Kindleberger, a retired Massachusetts Institute of Technology
economist.
   The crash of 1987 took the mania out of the stock market, but now
``leveraged buyouts seem to have picked up in a manic way,'' said
Kindleberger, author of a 1978 book, ``Manias, Panics and Crashes: A
History of Financial Crises.''
   Leverage is a concept Americans grasp young, when they first
notice that one child at the long end of a seesaw can hold up two on
the short end. A loan likewise expands a person's or company's
financial potential.
   But seesaws can suddenly tip the other way, and so can loans.
   Some corporate debtors may be gambling that they will be
protected from the consequences of their actions by the Federal
Reserve, the nation's central bank, which would open the money
spigots in a recession to keep them from defaulting.
   The problem is that easy money, while good for LBO artists, means
high inflation for everybody else. So far there is no sign that the
Fed is going easy on the money supply. In fact, it has tightened,
because the economy is growing strongly. The acid test will be the
next downturn.
   Here are the flash points:
   _Corporations are loading up on debt to finance takeovers, to
escape takeovers, or simply to take advantage of the tax
deductibility of interest payments. In the mid-1970s, corporations
had $5 of pretax profit for each dollar of interest they paid. Now
they scrape by with $2.
   _Banks are lending money for leveraged buyouts and commercial
real estate the same way they once lent liberally to Latin America.
Things are already shaky. Although 1988 will be a record year for
bank profits, it will also set a record for bank failures.
   _Business is not alone in the debt pileup. Families are borrowing
to make up for the stagnation in wages and salaries that began in
the 1970s, and household debt is at record levels.
   What makes leveraged buyouts a particular concern is that
borrowers admit in many cases that the only way they can pay off
their loans is by selling off assets. The question is, to whom?
   The crash of 1987 proved to stock investors that buyers, like
taxi cabs in the rain, become scarce just when you need them most.
Buyers may be just as scarce when the economy slumps and indebted
companies desperately need to sell assets to pay interest.
   Even aside from LBOs, corporate America has become so attracted
to debt that a AAA bond rating is almost an embarrassment in some
circles _ a sign to some that a company is not sufficiently
aggressive.
   It is true that companies in Japan and West Germany are more
heavily indebted than American companies. But banking companies in
those countries directly or indirectly own big stakes in the
borrowers so they make sure they will not fail. In the United
States, banks and bondholders are less sympathetic.
   Using a computer simulation, the Brookings Institution calculated
that one big U.S. corporation in 10 would run out of cash by the end
of the second year of a recession as bad as the last one.
   ``We are going to go into the next recession with basically half
the interest coverage we had prior to the 1980-82 downturn. We'd
have to expect that there are going to be more corporate defaults,''
said John Lonski, senior economist at Moody's Investors Service Inc.
   ``The great danger is the following: When a company finds itself
in a position where it has become difficult to satisfy its interest
obligations, it has to come up with cash to stave off bankruptcy. It
does it by laying off workers, reducing operations.
   ``But if many companies are forced to do this, what will then
happen is the recession will become all the more intense. That is
the great worry that all Fed policymakers face when they go ahead
and tighten the money supply,'' Lonski said.
   Other economists say the debt danger can be overdrawn. It is not
clear that raising money by issuing debt endangers the economy more
than raising money by selling stock, said Robert Dugger, chief
economist of the American Bankers Association.
   Any recession that is so bad that it triggers a cascade of
defaults ``is already so deep that everybody's pretty much wiped out
anyway,'' Dugger said.
   Still, economists agree that reversing the long decline in the
national rate of savings would put the economy on a sounder footing.
   Ironically, the Fed's success in wringing inflation out of the
economy in the 1980s raised debt burdens by setting off an explosion
of distress borrowing. Consumers, businesses and the government took
on new debt to service the old.
   Federal spending, which is often fingered as a culprit in the
American debt binge, may be getting more than its fair share of
criticism. The federal budget deficit is actually shrinking as a
portion of economic output and is smaller proportionately than in
Japan or West Germany.
   If Americans saved more, the United States as a whole _
government, corporations and individuals _ would not need to borrow
so heavily from overseas. The trade deficit would fall and
foreigners would not be able to buy up as many American factories
and Treasury bills.
   As 1989 begins, there are some reasons to think the debt binge
may be dampened soon.
   In the coming session, Congress will consider removing the tax
advantages of loading up on corporate debt by eliminating the
deductibility of some portion of junk bond interest payments.
   Federal regulators may press banks that make risky LBO loans to
build their loan-loss reserves or raise their capital above required
minimums.
   Aside from government action, the markets themselves are
beginning to put a lid on leveraged buyouts by shying away from the
riskiest corporate bond issues.
   In contrast to other debt crises, the credit risk of merger mania
is getting plenty of publicity. And that may be the best thing for
it.

<HEAD>Buyouts Buoy Stock Prices, But Scare Investors</HEAD>
<HEAD>With BC-YE--Mergers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

   The buyout binge on Wall Street played a major
role in putting the stock market averages in the plus column for
1988.
   But many observers worry that the participants in this frenzy
racked up short-term gains at the expense of potential long-term
pain in the marketplace.
   In early December, Jeffrey Applegate, an analyst at the
investment firm of Tucker, Anthony & R.L. Day Inc., calculated that
takeover activity directly accounted for nearly a third of the
overall increase recorded by one widely followed measure of stock
prices.
   At the time, Standard & Poor's composite index of 500 stocks
showed a 12.91 percent rise since the beginning of the year. Of
that, Applegate reckoned, 3.7 percentage points stemmed from
``takeover stocks.''
   Harder to quantify was the amount of the overall increase that
stemmed from buying in ``non-takeover'' stocks based on the
expectation, or hope, that the companies in question might someday
be bought out at higher prices.
   In fact, the takeover game has prompted a significant change in
the way many stock traders and analysts evaluate stocks for their
profit potential.
   Instead of looking at a company's business prospects or its
chances for earnings and dividend growth, the new way of gauging
value is to try to calculate what a stock might fetch if it were to
become a takeover target.
   Takeover specialists and their advocates say they are acting in
favor of all holders of the stocks that get ``put in play.''
   After all, they say, when a stock gets caught up in a bidding
war, everybody who owns it gets the benefit of the increase in its
price, along with the raiders and professional traders known as
arbitrage who generate most of the activity.
   If anybody has a complaint about this bidding, they argue, it
shouldn't be people who have a stake in higher stock prices.
   But the many skeptics and critics who have watched as the stakes
of the game reached new heights say it almost inevitably will lead
to trouble.
   If something comes along to curtail or stop the action, such as
legislation to discourage it, an important prop under the stock
market will be removed.
   And if the mania keeps up, they contend, it can only increase the
dangers of exessive debt and speculative risk.
   With the burgeoning bundle of money and credit being amassed in
buyout funds, ``the result is bound to be too much money chasing too
few good deals,'' said George Putnam III in his Boston-based
investment advisory publication The Turnaround Letter.
   ``In many ways a leveraged buyout is like buying stock on
margin'' _ in other words, with only a partial down payment, Putnam
added.
   ``However, in an LBO you can borrow 90 percent of the purchase
price, instead of 50 percent when you buy stock on margin.
   ``The last time you could buy stock by borrowing 90 percent of
the purchase price was 1929. Need we say more?''
   Analysts at Salomon Brothers Inc. say, ``restructuring activity
should extend into 1989, limiting downside risk in the market but
also continuing to alienate traditional investors.
   ``At present, there is essentially only one buyer of stocks: The
corporate insider.
   ``Companies that acquire their own stock or the shares of other
companies, nonmanagement groups that prepare leveraged buyouts and
raiders all possess `inside information' of the legal variety. They
have more knowledge than does a seller by virtue of who they are.
   ``By contrast, traditional investors, both domestic and foreign,
are highly skeptical about the process of restructuring companies
and the increased commoditization of U.S. equities. These investors
have therefore retreated from the market.''
   Detractors of the buyout wave tend not to mince words. Among the
ingredients in what he calls a ``recipe for disaster'' in the
market, Rochester, N.Y., investment adviser Charles LaLoggia cites
``investment bankers who are leveraging corporate America to the
hilt at monstrous interest rates at the height of the economic cycle
for no reason other than the fact these transactions generate huge
fees.''
   And buyouts by management have drawn some especially pointed
objections.
   ``The public has always felt that the market was dominated by the
big players, and program trading reinforced that view,'' said
Raymond F. DeVoe Jr. at Legg Mason Wood Walker Inc.
   ``The public has always suspected that the market was manipulated
by insiders, and the Boesky, et al., scandals confirmed that view.
   ``Now the public finds that you can't even trust the highly paid
management of your company to act in the stockholder's interests.''

   Corporate America's reliance on borrowed money
was never more prevalent than in 1988, when a flood of takeover
activity was unleashed.
   Businesses swallowed each other up with a vengeance, regardless
of size; and those that tried to resist were forced to make drastic
structural changes. To finance these acquisitions, leveraged buyouts
or restructurings many firms turned to the $180 billion public
``junk'' bond market _ where companies whose credit ratings are
below investment grade offer high interest rates to compensate for
bigger risks.
   Once a last resort in public financing, junk bonds played a
pivotal role in the wave of takeovers this past year and have gained
wider acceptance, and perhaps even more respect in the eyes of
investors and corporate executives.
   ``As more and more companies use high-yield debt to finance their
growth ... it becomes a regular alternative in terms of raising
capital,'' said Robert S. Waill, managing director for high-yield
research at L.F. Rothschild & Co. ``It's almost commonplace.''
   But all that has come at the expense of the high-grade corporate
market, which includes the elite 5 percent of U.S. companies with
investment-grade ratings, the nation's bread-and-butter
manufacturers. Fears of large corporate takeovers, and even bigger
debt loads, scared many investors away from bonds of indust~
companies this past year.
   Non-investment-grade companies are drawn to the junk bond
market's seemingly endless supply of funds, especially since it has
enabled them to offer a price high enough to persuade a target
company's shareholders to sell.
   Tax laws also have made junk bond financing attractive by
allowing interest payments to be deducted as a cost of doing
business. Companies that raise money through issuing new stock can't
do the same with stock dividends.
   And it costs less to borrow from the public than banks, even
though junk bond yields are usually around four percentage points
higher than comparable Treasury bonds.
   As of mid-December there were 148 public junk bond issues valued
at $27.17 billion, 56 percent of which were used primarily for
financing LBOs or acquisitions, according to the independent
financial-research firm Securities Data Co. Just three years ago,
about 27 percent of the $13.19 billion in junk bond issues were used
toward acquisitions, it said.
   Bond investors and traders are bracing for a deluge of big issues
in 1989, largely as a result of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co.'s
record $24.5 billion buyout of consumer products giant RJR Nabisco
Inc.
   While the bulk of the financing, $14 billion, will come from a
commercial bank syndicate, $5 billion will be through junk bonds.
Another $5 billion of existing RJR bonds is certain to be downgraded
to junk since the enormous debt load will make it harder for RJR to
pay off previous debts, therefore increasing the risk factor.
   It was that deal and other megadeals and proposals _ including
Philip Morris Co.'s $12.9 billion acquisition of Kraft Inc. _ that
sent the industrial bond market into a frenzy this past year. Bond
prices plummeted and trading came to a virtual standstill on fears
that any company, regardless of size, could become a takeover target
or aggressor, and in the process load itself up with new debt.
   The so-called ``event risk'' fears consequently have hurt
supplies. In November alone domestic industrial corporations sold
only two new bond issues in the United States, totaling about $250
million. That was down sharply from six bond issues totaling $1
billion the previous month.
   While investors suffered some losses on industrial bonds, they've
seen their rate of return on junk go up.
   Marshall B. Front, who manages mutual funds for the investment
banking firm Stein Roe & Farnham, said the high-yield bond portfolio
has a rate of return of 11.25 percent, compared with 7.2 percent for
the investment-grade bond portfolio and 17 percent for equities.
   ``The interest rates are very high and to some extent high-yield
paper represents less volatile surrogates to equities,'' said Gene
Wong, a managing director at Prudential-Bache Securities.
   Although mutual funds, insurance companies and pension funds hold
most of the outstanding junk bond issues, around 70 percent, foreign
interest has increased significantly. Foreign market share now
totals around 3 percent, compared to just a small fraction a few
years ago, according to a General Accounting report released in
February and analysts.
   The last six years of economic expansion have been a boon to the
junk market by helping to keep defaults down, but many portfolio
managers worry that an economic turndown will reverse that trend.
   ``We're concerned that the junk bond default rate has not been
tested in recent conditions and therefore we're not certain that the
total returns from junk are what they appear to be,'' said Philip R.
Roberts, a senior vice president for Aetna Life and Casualty Co.
   Aetna's $65 billion investment portfolio includes only $200
million of junk bonds.

<HEAD>Takeover Class of `88 Shows Diversity, Spunk</HEAD>
<HEAD>With BC-YE--Mergers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCY GORDON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The takeover class of '88 is a diverse, feisty
group that includes specialized investment firms, media moguls and a
casino czar.
   Its valedictorian is premier leveraged-buyout firm Kohlberg
Kravis Roberts & Co., which pulled off the coup of the year in late
November: the mammoth $24.5 billion leveraged buyout of RJR Nabisco
Inc. That deal eclipsed all previous corporate takeovers.
   Here are the top members of the class:
   _MOST AGGRESSIVE: Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, taking top honors for
the Nabisco deal after a battle royal against the company's
management and Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   Earlier in the year, KKR continued its acquisitive efforts at an
unrelenting pace with LBOs of battery maker Duracell Inc. for $1.8
billion and grocery chain Stop & Shop Cos. for $1.2 billion.
   Principal Henry Kravis says he lost eight pounds in five weeks
from sweating out the Nabisco negotiations. He must have passed up
the Oreos.
   _GREATEST CHUTZPAH: Carl Icahn, the owner and chairman of Trans
World Airlines Inc., which he took private in early September.
   Undaunted by the failure of his earlier $14.5 billion offer for
oil giant Texaco Inc., the wily corporate raider disclosed Dec. 13
that he had increased his stock ownership to 15.8 percent of
Texaco's outstanding shares.
   The disclosure by Icahn, Texaco's largest shareholder, stoked the
smoldering takeover speculation about the company and boosted its
stock price. _MOST PERSUASIVE: Coniston Partners, masters of
``strategic block'' investing.
   The trio has bought into huge companies like Allegis Corp. (now
called UAL Corp.) and Gillette Co. and amassed a hoard of cash,
instead of walking away with the companies themselves.
   The partners _ Paul Tierney Jr., Augustus Oliver and Keith
Gollust _ hardly fit the mold of corporate raiders. They're really
persuaders: It's the promise of a handsome return, which has
averaged more than 35 percent a year, that attracts people willing
to invest $5 million each to join their funds.
   _MOST COSMOPOLITAN: Asher Edelman, who became an American raider
in Paris this year.
   With profitable runs on major companies like Lucky Stores Inc.
and Fruehauf Corp. under his belt, Edelman has transplanted part of
his investment business to Europe.
   Frustrated by the high prices of U.S. companies and the legal
roadblocks that impede the swift stroke of the raider's hand,
Edelman plans to camps for at least six months a year in his
computer-equipped Paris apartment and work through a holding company.
   _MOST GLITZY: Donald Trump, the real estate and casino tycoon who
stretched his wings by agreeing in October to buy Eastern Airlines'
profitable shuttle service for a cool $365 million in cash.
   The irrepressible billionaire recently initiated his fourth foray
against a Nevada gaming giant, after vowing he would become a major
player in Las Vegas. Already the kingpin in rival Atlantic City,
N.J., Trump added Caesars World Inc. to his list of Nevada targets.
   Trump's latest grand design: he's talking about cashing in on
glasnost by building hotels in the Soviet Union.
   _MOST BRASH: Media mogul Rupert Murdoch, who acquired Triangle
Publications in August for around $3 billion.
   As part of the Triangle deal, Murdoch got the powerhouse TV
Guide, the most widely read magazine in the nation with a
circulation of around 17 million.
   The Aussie-turned-U.S.-citizen also broadened his empire during
the year by creating joint ventures with Walt Disney Co. and a group
of big U.S. hotel chains.
   _MOST PERSISTENT: British publishing tycoon Robert Maxwell, the
other media member of the class, who tried and tried again to buy
Macmillan Inc.
   The intrepid Maxwell finally succeeded on the third try, getting
the venerable publishing and information services giant for $2.5
billion in early November. Since then, he's been busy selling off
several Macmillan subsidiaries.
   _MOST CONTRITE: Miami industrialist Victor Posner, who paid a $7
million fine (including $3 million to aid the homeless), in a tax
evasion case in February.
   Posner also has been accused by the Securities and Exchange
Commission of participating in an illegal stock-parking scheme with
junk bond firm Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. and fallen speculator
Ivan Boesky.
   _MOST UNORTHODOX: Stephen Mernick, a 34-year-old Toronto real
estate developer and Orthodox Jew who recently acquired the assets
of Jim and Tammy Bakker's bankrupt PTL Ministries for $65 million.
   Mernick gets 2,200 acres of property, a 500-room hotel, the
Heritage USA Christian theme park, a TV studio and a 2,000-seat
church. The assets had been appraised before the sale at between $92
million and $110 million.
   When he entered the PTL bidding in October, Mernick said he was
interested in the assets ``purely as a real estate deal.''

   If a time machine could transport the leveraged
buyout artists of 1988 back to the 19th century, those in arrears
might be clanging chains in debtors' prison, denounced as dangerous
for selling pieces of paper called ``junk bonds'' that promise
rewarding returns.
   The comparison shows how the treatment of debt and its
consequences have changed so profoundly just in a short span of
Western history, economists and bankruptcy experts say.
   Once seen as a symbol of shame, scandal, weakness and failure,
owing money has been transmuted into status, confidence and power.
   ``A company taking on debt is now considered evidence that it's
strong,'' said Joseph Chervin, a bankruptcy lawyer at the New York
law firm of Rosenman & Colin. ``It's like a person taking on a
credit line. That's something you flex your muscles about. You feel
good about it.''
   The modern-day attitude toward debt is even more startling when
compared with the practices of ancient Rome, where creditors had the
legal right to cut debtors' bodies into pieces.
   ``Back in the old, old days, if you were a king or an emperor or
some high potentate, you could borrow and if you couldn't pay it
back you'd chop the head off the lender,'' said Robert Kavesh, an
economics professor at New York University. ``If you were an
individual and you couldn't pay it back, you'd be a slave of sorts.''
   William Shakespeare articulated England's taboo toward borrowed
money with the line in Hamlet, ``Neither a borrower nor lender be,
for loan oft loses both itself and friend and borrowing dulls the
edge of husbandry.''
   ``In other words,'' Kavesh says, ``stay out of debt.''
   A couple of hundred years ago, defaulting even on a petty debt
could land an English citizen, farmer or shopkeeper in a state
dungeon or on a boat to Australia, a one-time penal colony where
many debtors were exiled.
   Up until the late 18th and early 19th centuries, creditors in
England had extraordinary control over debtors' lives, with the
right to deprive them of their liberty until the debt was repaid.
   Historical accounts show that by the early 1800s there were eight
debtors' prisons in London alone, with inmate populations ranging in
size from less than a dozen to 600. Most prisons were squalid,
filled with vermin and disease.
   Debtors' prisons also were an important part of U.S. history.
What is now the state of Georgia was originally a debtors colony,
inhabited by violators of the so-called insolvent laws.
   Records on file at the New York Public Library show that in 1816,
nearly 2,000 people of New York state were incarcerated for
delinquent debts, more than half of them under $50 each.
   Debtors' prisons eventually were abolished, a partial result of
an industrialized society, the development of a rational banking
system and the evolution of bankruptcy laws. But there are
interesting relics of that era still on the books today, bankruptcy
lawyers say.
   For example, some state statutes enable creditors to seize
property of debtors without a court proceeding. In Pennsylvania, a
legal provision called a concession of judgment allows a creditor to
obtain a default judgment even if there's no default.
   ``That's certainly a right that goes back to the days of debtors'
prison,'' said Neal D. Colton, a creditors' rights attorney at the
Philadelphia law firm of Dechert Price & Rhoads.
   Others say the symbolic burning of a mortgage is a throwback to
the days when the yoke of debt could be joyfully discarded, the
shame of owing money forgotten. But even that rite has changed in
the era of borrowing to the hilt.
   ``Nowadays, what you find is the burning of the mortgage, instead
of liberation, is an invitation to refinance again,'' said Kavesh.
``It's an amazing turnabout.''
   On a larger scale, Wall Street giants such as Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc. and Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. pride themselves on
their ability to aggressively borrow billions of dollars for
takeovers through the sale of high-yield ``junk bond'' debt
securities. It remains to be seen how much of this debt will be
repaid, though, since most junk-bond issues haven't matured yet.
   ``For 2,000 years, debt was condemned by philosophers,'' said
James Grant, editor of Grant's Interest Rate Observer and a
prominent critic of the 1988 debt-financed takeover binge.
``Suddenly it's not only a stigma, but according to Drexel Burnham
Lambert, you're an idiot if you're not in debt.''

   By the numbers, the news about leveraged buyouts
and takeovers seems clear, precise and exact to the decimal points.
In a numerical sense the news is clear; doesn't everyone understand
dollars and cents?
   True, perhaps, but when did numbers ever tell the entire story?
   In the wake of these corporate convulsions, the business scene is
strewn with questions about ethics and responsibilities, about the
proper use of borrowed money, of the role of banks, of the future of
``junk'' bonds.
   So vast are the considerations that they begin with the ultimate
naivete: What's happening?
   In the past five years $375 billion of corporate equities have
been removed from markets. In the same period, the long-term debt of
non-financial companies has about doubled to around $2 trillion.
   Much of this debt is of unknown quality. That is, the repayment
ability of those raising the debt is unproven. If borrowers renege,
it will have a severe impact on some of the big lenders, such as
banks and private pension funds.
   Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan brings up another
consideration. He sees mounting private debt, particularly corporate
debt arising from takeover activity, as limiting the government's
options in managing the economy.
   Congress is concerned too, and it should be, since leveraged
buyouts are subsidized by taxpayers. That is, the interest payments
on such debt are tax deductible. Should Uncle Sam continue to
provide such an incentive?
   Have bondholders, whose investments fell sharply, been abused?
   The courts will see to that, because some institutional buyers of
corporate bonds, such as pension funds insurance companies, are
suing. They say they weren't told of management's plan to cheapen
existing bonds with new debt.
   But where do those with less clearcut rights turn?
   What, for instance, are the rights of employees whose company is
purchased so that it can be broken up, sold off, its local jobs
eliminated and its productive years ended?
   Doesn't the larger community have rights? Should it sit by idly
while a once viable division is removed from the tax rolls after the
town committed itself to new storm and sanitary sewers based on the
division's healthy future?
   So serious are the potential consequences of buying, selling and
sometimes dismembering entire companies, that it seems inevitable
that even more basic considerations will arise, such as the very
definition of a corporation.
   While such fundamental issues caused concern, few were fully
explored or in most instances even addressed in the chaotic year of
mergers, acquisitions, leveraged buyouts and takeovers.
   While the entire business of buying and selling companies creates
these issues, they were especially acute in regard to the officers
and directors of companies in which insiders sought control through
leveraged buyouts.
   It might seem a safe assumption that nobody should know more
about a company, including its real value, than those whose job it
is to run it. If you accept that assumption, however, you are
confronted with a puzzle.
   You must, for example, make sense of the attempted management
takeover of RJR Nabisco Inc. for $75 a share or $17.6 billion. That
is what management offered, and it was widely heralded as a bonanza
for shareholders.
   Quickly, however, a competing offer came from outsiders at $90 a
share, or close to $21 billion. It meant, in effect, that
management's offer was far less than the best. Left on the table, so
to speak, were funds equal to the assets of such well known large
companies as Wang Labs, Firestone or Inland Steel.
   The bidding did not stop there, however. It continued until it
exceeded $24 billion before management's own board of directors,
fulfilling its obligation to protect shareholders, agreed to an
outside group's offer.
   Had shareholders accepted management's first offer they would
have made perhaps the worst deal in U.S. business history.
   Thankful they hadn't accepted the low-ball offer from RJR Nabisco
management, many of these shareholders, along with civic-minded
individuals and institutions, remain concerned about what could have
been.
   Unlike the matter of existing bondholders, who felt they had a
clear-cut case for the courts, many of these issues seem to fall
into a judicial and regulatory no-man's land that might require
years to deal with.
   Are activities of corporate management covered by insider trading
laws? Should they? Who possibly could be more privy to inside
information than the managers of a company? Possessing it, did they
use it for their own benefit?
   In the past two years a number of insider cases, instances in
which nonpublic information was used for private financial gain,
have been prosecuted. In most instances, the numbers involved
``only'' millions, but in leveraged buyouts the numbers are well up
in the billions of dollars.
   If the Securities and Exchange Commission's insider trading
regulations are applied to leveraged buyouts the consequences could
make these other insider cases appear piddling.
   Question: Do immediate disclosure regulations apply in leveraged
buyouts? Should they?
   Consider that in matters involving a potential change in the
price of a stock, management is obligated to disclose information
immediately. Clearly, leveraged buyouts, which always affect prices,
aren't disclosed immediately.
   Another nagging question that could become an issue is this: What
assurance do shareholders have that managers in a leveraged buyout
haven't depressed operations, knowing that improvements can be made
later?
   Of all questions generated by the leveraged buyout binge, one _
more than any other _ seems likely to be answered on the same
dollars-and-cents terms in which the deals were originally proposed.
It concerns the junk bonds.
   So-called because they symbolize a very high degree of
leveraging, and therefore are theoretically more risky than
well-rated bonds, junk bonds face their first general test in the
next recession, whenever that comes.
   The question: Will the highly leveraged corporations that issued
junk bonds be able to sustain payments on these bonds if corporate
income is reduced because of a general recession?
   Or will these fantastic buyouts become incredible failures that
spread financial ruin?

<TEXT>
   Employees at a government-owned
uranium-processing plant returned to work today for the first time
since a 10-week strike halted production of a material critical to
nuclear weapons.
   About 400 workers were asked to report at 8 a.m. after union
members voted by a 3-1 ratio Saturday to approve a partial contract
settlement with the Westinghouse Materials Co. of Ohio, which
operates the plant 18 miles north of Cincinnati.
   Workers were taken by bus to a movie theater to attend seminars
to teach them how to handle, among other things, leaks of low-level
radioactive materials, said plant spokesman Bob Walker. He said
production would resume after the seminars, probably in several days.
   ``They have to go through a daylong orientation meeting for
retraining and safety,'' Walker said.
   ``We have had some problems with radioactive materials outside
their containment,'' said Pete Kelley, another plant spokesman.
   The seminars were scheduled to satisfy workers' complaints about
safety at the plant, Kelley said. The key issues in the strike,
however, were fringe benefits and retirement programs.
   The plant, formally known as the Feed Materials Production
Center, is the only one of 17 federal nuclear weapons facilities
that processes uranium other plants use. Uranium supplies have been
partly depleted since the strike began Oct. 7, Kelley said.
   During the strike, 250 Fernald workers received layoff notices as
a result of diminished production demands. The plant also became
embroiled in controversy when the U.S. Energy Department admitted
that radioactive material had leaked into the environment during the
plant's three decades of operation.
   The department has pledged to clean up the plant, although recent
reports indicate the department is considering closing it.
Westinghouse Materials President Bruce Boswell estimated a full
cleanup would take nine to 15 years.
   ``I think you could walk on it without rubber shoe covers,
without putting on a smock and worrying about touching things,''
Boswell told The Cincinnati Enquirer in an interview published
Sunday. ``But I'll be long dead and gone before the need to keep
monitoring the site is over.''
   Residents near the plant recently filed a $300 million federal
class-action lawsuit claiming radioactive waste emitted by Fernald
has harmed their health and property.
   The lawsuit names the plant's previous operator, National Lead of
Ohio Inc., and its parent company, National Lead Industries, as
defendants.
   Westinghouse, which took over the plant's operation Jan. 1.,
1986, is not named as a defendant.
   The labor agreement, approved by members of 14 unions represented
by the Fernald Atomic Trades and Labor Council, provides for no pay
increase, but allows the approximately 400 workers who were not laid
off to return to work and pursue up to 4,000 safety and health
grievances.
   Previously, Westinghouse had offered to pay workers $150 each to
drop their grievances.
   The agreement also provides for $1,600 to be paid to each worker
during the three-year life of the contract; a new health insurance
program; and the right of the unions to review, but not reject, the
hiring of subcontractors at the plant.

<TEXT>
   The Justice Department is investigating
whether Northrop Corp. officials received some of the $7.75 million
the company paid to South Koreans in 1984 in a failed attempt to
obtain a jet fighter contract, a newspaper reported today.
   It is unclear which Northrop executives are under investigation,
the Los Angeles Times reported.
   However, a grand jury earlier this year subpoenaed Northrop's
chairman, as well as four former Northrop executives who left the
Los Angeles-based aerospace company following disclosures about a
Korean hotel deal to be funded by Northrop.
   The Times, citing unidentified sources, also reported that a
Northrop consultant, once paid to introduce company officials to
Korean leaders, may have received as much as $1 million of the
payments.
   In Seoul, South Korea, authorities today arrested a South Korean
businessman and charged him with taking $3.5 million in bribes from
Northrop to promote the sale of the F-20 Tigershark fighter planes.
   The businessman, Lee Min-ha, allegedly collaborated with a former
Korean presidential bodyguard, Park Jong-kyu, who acted as an agent
for Northrop in trying to sell 200 F-20s to South Korea, prosecutors
said. Park, a relative of Lee, died in 1985.
   Tony Cantafio, a spokesman for Los Angeles-based Northrop,
declined to comment on the reports of broadened grand jury and IRS
investigations.
   The Internal Revenue Service has begun its own investigation of
Northrop's 1984 payments to the Koreans, apparently to determine
whether American recipients of the money properly reported the
income, the Times said.
   The federal grand jury here is investigating whether Northrop
violated the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act by making with
various payments to at least three organizations controlled by
Korean political operator Park Chong Kyu. The act bars U.S.
companies from making direct or indirect payments to foreign
government officials.
   Most of the payments apparently were made to build a hotel in
Seoul as an indirect way to help the Korean government finance
purchases of the F-20 fighters, the Times said.
   Northrop has said it invested in the hotel venture as part of a
legal ``offset'' agreement to demonstrate that in return for the jet
contract, the company was willing to help boost the Korean economy.
   Northrop also funded two other South Korean groups controlled by
Park, the Dong Yang Express Group and Bankaborrow, which apparently
were involved to help sell and finance the F-20, the newspaper
reported.
   But the aerospace firm never sold any of the fighters, the hotel
never was built and the money is unaccounted for.
   Northrop has filed a civil lawsuit in South Korea, alleging it
was defrauded in the deal. But the company never registered the deal
with South Korean authorities, and a former Northrop consultant has
alleged the payments were part of a lobbying fund.
   A parallel investigation of the funds by a panel of the House
Energy and Commerce Committee has uncovered evidence indicating that
Northrop consultant Jimmy Shin, a former Honolulu night club
operator, may have received $1 million of the money, the Times said.
   Through a subpoena, the subcommittee on oversight and
investigation obtained information on a $1 million bank draft to
Shin drawn on the Korea Exchange Bank's account with Manufacturers
Hanover Trust Co. That account is believed to be part of Northrop's
hotel fund, the newspaper said.
   Northrop has paid Shin $102,000 a year for several years for his
consulting work, including introducing Northrop officials to South
Koreans.
   The grand jury has subpoenaed Northrop Chairman Thomas V. Jones,
former Executive Vice President Welko Gasich, former Chief Financial
Officer William J. McGagh, former Vice President James Dorsey,
former Vice President Donald Foulds and Shin.
   The four executives resigned after the Korean hotel deal was made
public early this year. All declined comment on the latest
investigation, the Times said.

   Beazer PLC said Monday its Koppers Co.
subsidiary has sold its Industrial Specialty Chemical division to
Koppers managers for $190 million.
   A consortium of management investors led by former Koppers
President Glen C. Tenley, assisted by Sterling Group of Houston and
Chase Manhattan Capital Corp., purchased the division on Friday,
Beazer said.
   Frank M. Spinola, former general manager of industrial specialty
chemicals under Koppers, will be chief executive officer of the new
entity, officials said.
   The sale includes plants in Petrolia, near Pittsburgh, and in
Tuscaloosa, Ala. The division employs about 390 workers and makes
adhesives for tires and laminated wood, and chemicals for the paper
industry..
   Beazer, a British-American building materials and construction
company headquartered in Bath, Great Britain, said has sold or has
contracts to sell about $420 million in Koppers assets. The division
sold Friday is the largest Koppers asset sold so far.
   Beazer took control of Pittsburgh-based Koppers in June.

   The European Investment Bank said Monday it
would lend 800 million French francs, or around $133.5 million, to
the French aircraft maker Aerospatiale for assembling Airbus
A330-340 jetliners.
   The bank, which is the long-term investment agency of the
European Economic Community, said the loan was for 20 years. The
interest rate wasn't disclosed.
   Aerospatiale, based in Toulouse, France, is the French member of
Airbus Industrie, a European aircraft consortium. The other members
are companies from West Germany, Britain and Spain.
   The A330-340, the largest aircraft in the Airbus range, is a
long- and medium-range plane.
   The bank said the loan is earmarked for new buildings and
installations that will be used to improve assembly and research
facilities at the site in Toulouse. Aircraft components supplied by
factories in the other Airbus member countries are assembled at the
site.

   Prices fell slightly in a lackluster session on the
London Stock Exchange Monday as the approaching holidays and
upcoming balance of payments data for November gave little reason
for activity.
   ``There just hasn't been much trade around to speak of,'' one
market maker said. ``People are simply loath to do anything'' before
the Christmas holiday and the announcement of British trade figures
scheduled for Friday, he added.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-stock index fell 3.2
points or 0.18 percent, to 1770.5, also the intraday low.
   Volume was a subdued 369.3 million shares, compared with the
473.9 million shares which changed hands Friday.
   Although Wall Street opened on sound footing, it did llittle to
shore up support in the London market, dealers offered. By the close
of the London session, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up a
healthy 12.68 points at 2163.39.
   Commentators cautioned that trade figures due for release Friday
would likely keep players anxious and sidelined during the coming
week, unless unexpected news emerges to draw them off the fence.

   CSX Transportation Inc. announced
Monday members of the United Transportation Union have ratified a
labor agreement that will immediately reduce the size of train crews
on about 30 percent of its operations.
   The agreement covers CSXT employees on the former Louisville &
Nashville, Clinchfield, and Nashville, Chattanooga and St. Louis
lines, the company said.
   Under the deal, one of the two brakeman on most trains will be
eliminated.
   ``This breakthrough agreement is unique among major railroads
because we can now immediately run freight trains in the covered
areas with a locomotive engineer, a conductor and one breakman
without phasing in the reduced crews through attrition of the
workforce,'' said John Snow, CSX president and chief operating
officer.
   He said the result would be a more-efficient freight service.
   The agreement says employees in active service may elect to
receive a separation allowance of $50,000, transfer to another
location and receive up to $20,000 in relocation expenses, or accept
a furlough with rights to return, plus a $15,000 payment.
   Snow said the contract efforts are part of CSXT's goal of
reducing employment on its 19-state rail system to 30,000 employees,
while reducing its route milage to 15,000 from 20,000 miles.

million tons of corn also was behind increased farmer selling over
the weekend. That selling was a second factor pressuring prices.
   On top of that, the market reacted early to reports of rain over
the weekend in the soybean growing regions of South America and a
forecast calling for more during the week ahead.
   ``Even though the bears pushed it down a little bit, they never
really broke it,'' Lespinasse said.
   He said buying came from traders who discounted the bad news and
had faith in the underlying values in the commodities.
   On the close, wheat was { cent lower to 4\ cents higher, with the
contract for delivery in December at $4.37 a bushel; corn was 3}
cents lower to 1\ cent higher, with December at $2.70{ a bushel;
oats were 1 cent to 3{ cents higher, with December at $2.25 a
bushel; and soybeans were 5{ cents to 13{ cents higher, with January
at $7.94 a bushel.

<HEAD>Smith Barney, Citicorp Cutting Back London Operations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Citicorp and Smith Barney Harris Upham
International Inc. said Monday they were cutting back their equity
trading operations in Britain.
   Several brokerage firms recently have trimmed their British
operations, citing low trading volume following last year's stock
market crash and strong competition among market makers in the wake
of the Big Bang, the 1986 deregulation of Britain's financial
markets.
   Smith Barney said it was ending its fixed-income sales and
trading and other operations at its London office. Fifty employees,
some of whom will be reassigned, would be affected, the company said.
   The company said the move reflected a ``strategic refocus of its
major business sectors.''
   Citicorp's London brokerage firm, Citicorp Scrimgeour Vickers,
said it reduced the number of British stocks in which it makes
markets from 600 to 400.
   Citicorp's latest move would not involve any job losses, said
Martin Burton, head of market making at the firm. However the number
of market makers has already been halved this year from 80 to 40,
Burton said.
   Earlier this month, Morgan Grenfell Group PLC withdrew completely
from market making in British equities and government bonds, cutting
450 jobs. Last week, Kleinwort Benson Group PLC cut 35 staff from
its equity department.
   Market makers are the specialist brokers that continuously quote
prices in certain stocks on the London market's screen-based trading
system.

   ``While consumers spread holiday cheer, the Fed is casting itself

Lynch, in a weekend bulletin to the firm's clients.

<TEXT>
   Most Denny's restaurants, which boast an
``Always Open'' sign at each location, will change policy for one
day to allow employees to have Christmas off. But there's one
problem.
   Since the restaurants are always open, they never have to lock
the doors. In fact, some don't have locks on the doors and others
have locks that have never been used and for which keys cannot be
found, said Joe Herrera, director of marketing.
   This week, the chain is installing new locks on about 700
restaurants, Herrera said.
   ``This is all new to us,'' said Jerry Richardson, president of TW
Services, Denny's parent company.
   The La Mirada-based food chain also has to come up with closing
policies, but Richardson said the dilemma is the price to be paid
for holiday spirit.
   ``Since management has the day off, we thought our thousands of
field employees deserved the same courtesy,'' he said.
   About 200 of Denny's 1,221 restaurants are franchise operations
and about 50 or 60 of them will stay open, said Judy Lynes, a
publicist for Denny's.
   All the others will close at 7 p.m. Christmas Eve and stay closed
through Christmas Day for the first time since the chain of
restaurants was founded 35 years ago.

<HEAD>Media General Gets Back Sugarman-Controlled Stock</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Media General Inc. acquired California
investor Burt Sugarman's stake in the publishing company on Monday,
swapping a California paper mill for Sugarman-controlled Media
General stock.
   The $100 million deal also included a $44 million payment by
Media General to companies controlled by Sugarman.
   In a joint announcement, James S. Evans, president of Media
General, and Sugarman said an agreement was reached to sell Media
General's Pomona, Calif., paper mill to Sugarman's Giant Group Ltd.
and Barris Industries Inc., in exchange for Media General stock held
by Giant and Barris.
   The deal was part of a complete redemption of the 2.8 million
Media General shares held by Sugarman's companies, or 10 percent of
Media General's outstanding shares. Sugarman had said earlier that
the shares cost him $111.6 million, or an average of $40.14 per
share.
   Earlier this year, Sugarman failed in a bid to take over Media
General, whose publications include the Richmond Times-Dispatch, The
Richmond News Leader and several other daily and weekly newspapers.
Sugarman also unsuccessfully sought a seat for himself and two
associates on the nine-member Media General board at the company's
annual meeting in May.
   Sugarman offered $70 per share, or $1.8 billion, for the company.
   David L. Jordan, Media General's vice president, said Sugarman
has agreed to drop remaining attempts to take over the company,
including an appeal of a court decision that upheld the legality of
Media General's dual stock structure.
   D. Tennant Bryan, Media General chairman, and J.Stewart Bryan
III, vice chairman, control Media General's Class B shares, which
have more than 70 percent of the stock voting power. A merger
involving Media General would require approval of two-thirds of the
closely-held Class B stock.
   Evans said the agreement, subject to certain conditions that
could include a third-party purchase of the California paper mill,
represented Media General's continued shift toward communications
properties.
   However, the company will retain its interests in three other
newsprint mills.
   Sugarman is a Hollywood movie and television producer whose
programs include game shows such as The New Dating Game.
   George F. Shipp, vice president and stock analyst at Investment
Corp. of Virginia in Norfolk, said the deal announced Monday allowed
Media General to get rid of Sugarman by sacrificing an asset that
was not critical to its operations and without leveraging its
balance sheet.

<HEAD>Pepperell, Farley Proxy Fight For Board Set</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN A. BOLT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hostile suitor Farley Inc. has succeeded in
forcing West Point-Pepperell Inc. to call a shareholders' meeting to
vote on a new board of directors, the threatened textile giant said
Monday.
   Pepperell said in a statement from its West Point, Ga.,
headquarters it had confirmed that holders of about 27 percent of
the company's common stock _ including Farley's 9.8 percent stake _
had called for the meeting.
   The Pepperell board was required to call the meeting if requested
to do so by holders of 25 percent of its common stock. The statement
said the board, which probably would meet later this week, was
expected to schedule the meeting for Feb. 25.
   On Oct. 25, Farley offered $1.4 billion, or $48 per share, for
Pepperell, an offer which the company's directors dismissed as
inadequate. They claimed Farley's bid was an effort to get the
company befgs from a then-incomplete
takeover of J.P. Stevens & Co. Inc.
   Farley, the Chicago-based manufacturer of Fruit of the Loom
underwear and Acme boots, asked other stockholders on Dec. 1 to join
in requesting the meeting in an attempt to thwart management's
resistance to the tender offer.
   Farley's request for the meeting said it would propose to remove
Pepperell's 11 current directors, replacing them with an entirely
new slate.
   A Farley-backed board would be expected to rescind certain
``poison pill'' anti-takeover provisions from Pepperell's bylaws
that would increase the cost of the billion takeover attempt.
   However, the scheduling of a meeting does not guarantee Farley's
efforts to oust the board would succeed. Farley still must seek
support for its as-yet-unnamed nominees.
   Farley spokesman Jack Albertine said Monday the company's stake
in Pepperell, plus shares already tendered to Farley, give the
hostile suitor about 56 percent of Pepperell's outstanding stock.
However, the tenders do not carry voting rights.
   Farley objects to recent changes in the bylaws that allowed
management to purchase additional shares, resulting in a possible
$1.9 million profit to Pepperell Chairman Joseph L. Lanier Jr. and
$1.2 million to President Don J. Keller.
   Other changes benefiting management, including so-called ``golden
parachutes'' for directors, have ``effectively prohibited any
acquisition proposal or tender offer which lacks management's
support, no matter how beneficial to shareholders,'' Farley's
request for the meeting said.
   Farley also has filed lawsuits challenging Georgia's
anti-takeover statutes.
   Pepperell, the country's largest publicly held textile
manufacturer, has countered with lawsuits claiming Farley's bid
violates security and banking regulations because it is financed
with too much debt.
   It also charges that Farley's financial adviser, Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc., improperly has used information gained during
Pepperell's takeover this year of Stevens and that Drexel is a
full-fledged bidder in the deal and has failed to disclose that to
regulators.
   A federal district judge has agreed with portions of both
lawsuits, sending the case to the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals, where a hearing is scheduled Jan. 11.

<HEAD>Pillsbury Fits Well Into Grand Met's Strategy, Analysts Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By COTTEN TIMBERLAKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pillsbury Co. fits Grand Metropolitan PLC's
international expansion strategy, even though some Grand Met
shareholders have been concerned that Pillsbury was an ailing target
that nobody else apparently wanted, analysts said Monday.
   Mineapolis-based Pillsbury, which has suffered poor earnings,
management turmoil and discontent among franchisees of its Burger
King fast-food chain, said Sunday it agreed to be taken over by
Grand Met for $5.68 billion cash, or $66 a share.
   Grand Met originally offered $60 a share on Oct. 4 and no other
suitor stepped in during the 2{-month takeover battle, which largely
was fought in the courts and the newspapers.
   ``We see Pillsbury as a real opportunity and very much look
forward to get into it and work with the people there,'' Tim
Halford, a Grand Met spokesman, said Monday.
   Chairman Allen Sheppard was not available for an interview,
Halford said.
   When completed, the acquisition would be the largest, non-oil
foreign acquisition by a British company. British buyers _ already
among the biggest foreign purchasers of American properties _ have
stepped up purchases of U.S. companies in recent years, spurred by
the weaker dollar.
   Grand Met has been one of the more active buyers, engaging in
several billion dollars worth of transactions in the United States
and elsewhere in the past year.
   Also on Monday, Grand Met announced it acquired two European
restaurant chains for a total of about 20 million pounds, or about
$37 million at current exchange rates. They are the West German
Wienerwald, which operates 231 outlets, and the Spaghetti Factory,
with five restaurants in Switzerland.
   Pillsbury, whose products include Green Giant vegetables, Van De
Kamp's frozen fish, and Haagen-Dazs ice cream, fits in well with
Grand Met's strategy of focusing on foods, liquor and retailing and
expanding those businesses worldwide, analysts said.
   Grand Met's own brands include J and B Scotch whisky, Smirnoff
vodka, Alpo pet foods and Pearle vision care products.
   Andrew Buchanan, an analyst with Hoare Govett Ltd., said:
``Pillsbury represents a great deal for them, even at the higher
price.''
   ``It's a good strategy,'' Buchanan said. ``Number one brands in
the largest domestic market in the world should be susceptible to
internationalization.''
   Grand Met's strong liquor operations have little room for
improvement, said Ron Littleboy, an analyst with the investment firm
Nomura Securities in London.
   ``The other two areas, retailing and food, particularly food,
were starting to look like they were left behind, very much U.K.
oriented, very strong brands in the U.K., with no international
presence. That's what Pillsbury does.
   ``Pillsbury should give them those opportunities to see just how
good they are in food,'' Littleboy said.
   Although the analysts said they were confident Grand Met could
turn Pillsbury around, Grand Met's share price has been depressed by
shareholder concern over the acquisition.
   Grand Met's shares fell the equivalent of 1.8 cents to finish at
$7.89 in Monday trading on the London Stock Exchange.
   ``With so many people in the U.S. saying how badly managed
Pillsbury was, it has been harder for Grand Met to convince its own
shareholders what a good deal it is,'' Littleboy said.
   Grand Met's shares would be trading 15 percent higher had it not
been for the takeover, Littleboy estimated, which he said ``implies
skepticism, to say the least.''
   But ``given their (Grand Met's) record and their management,
personally I have confidence they can'' get Pillsbury on the right
track, Littleboy said.
   Here are details of other recent Grand Met acquisitions and a
disposal:
   On Friday, Grand Met announced the purchase of Sears PLC's
William Hill betting chain for $606 million cash.
   Grand Met lost in November a takeover battle for Irish Distillers
Co. PLC, which makes Irish whiskey. Irish Distillers was taken over
by friendly suitor Pernod Ricard SA, the French liquor company.
   In early October, Grand Met announced the sale of its 100-hotel
Inter-Continental chain to the Seibu Saison Group of Japan for $2.27
billion.
   Grand Met acquired the U.S. distiller Heublein Inc. for $1.3
billion last year. It bought U.S.-based Liggett Group Inc., a
tobacco company, for $450 million in 1980.

   The dollar rose against some foreign currencies
and fell against others Monday in light trading as major traders
prepared to close their books at the end of the year.
   Corporate customers and banks that deal in currencies are
unlikely to take big positions for or against the dollar in the last
two weeks of the year for fear of guessing wrong and spoiling their
year-end financial statements, said Frank Conte, vice president for
foreign exchange in the New York office of Barclays Bank PLC.
   ``Why risk it?'' Conte said.
   Dealers said there was still some talk in the market that the
Federal Reserve would hike its discount rate, although few believed
a Fed move will occur before the beginning of the new year. The
discount rate is what the central bank charges commercial banks for
loans.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar fell 0.08 yen to a closing 124.02 yen. Later, in London,
it was quoted higher at 124.05 yen. In New York, it fell to 124.08
yen from 124.14 yen.
   The dollar fell against the British pound in London and New York.
In London it cost $1.8230 to buy one pound, dearer than $1.8150 late
Friday. In New York the pound rose to $1.8209 from $1.8193.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday's
prices, included: 1.7645 West German marks, up from 1.7584; 1.4891
Swiss francs, up from 1.4820; 1.1998 Canadian dollars, down from
1.2305; 6.0270 French francs, up from 6.0090; and 1,300.75 Italian
lire, up from 1,296.50.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Friday's
prices, included: 1.7625 West German marks, down from 1.7635; 1.4870
Swiss francs, down from 1.4895; 6.0235 French francs, up from
5.9950; 1.9895 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9805; 1,296.50 Italian
lire, unchanged; and 1.1995 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2035.
   In Hong Kong, gold bullion rose 38 cents to close at a bid
$415.62 a troy ounce.
   Gold rose in London to a late bid price of $414.25 a troy ounce
from $412.25 bid late Friday. In Zurich, gold closed at a bid
$412.25, unchanged from late Friday.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery closed at $414.40 a troy ounce, up from $414 on Friday.
   Later, Republic National Bank of New York said gold was bid at
$414 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EST, up from $413.50 an ounce late
Friday.
   Silver bullion prices fell on the London market where the metal
was trading at a late bid price of $6.08 a troy ounce, compared with
Friday's $6.12. On New York's Comex, silver bullion for current
delivery closed at $6.110 a troy ounce, up from $6.082.

   The stock market climbed to a two-month high
Monday, extending its yearend rally despite worries about the
outlook for interest rates.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 21.97 to 2,172.68,
not far short of the 1988 closing high of 2,183.50 it reached on
Oct. 21.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 7 to 5 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
841 up, 598 down and 538 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 162.25 million

by a ``triple witching hour'' involving expiring stock-index futures
and options.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the

   The European Economic Community Monday
agreed to go ahead with a ban on imports of hormone-treated meat as
of Jan. 1 and tentatively adopted measures to counter any U.S.
retaliation against its ban.
   The United States has threatened retaliation against EEC imports
of, among others, boneless ham, canned tomatoes, fruit juices and
alcoholic beverages. Italy, Denmark and Spain would be most affected
by that.
   The EEC foreign ministers, meeting here Monday, accepted a
recommendation by EEC External Relations Commissioner Willy De
Clercq not to postpone the ban again.
   Late last year, the EEC delayed the ban's implementation until
Jan. 1.
   ``We do not envisage a new delay as there were no political or
technical reasons'' to do so, De Clercq told reporters.
   De Clercq said the ban will affect between $130 million and $150
million of U.S. meat exports a year. U.S. estimates have put the
figure at $170 million.
   ``We're extremely disappointed; we had hoped that reason might
prevail,'' said Thomas O. Kay, administrator of USDA's Foreign
Agricultural Service. ``If that's the decision that they've made, I
suppose we have no other recourse except retaliation.''
   Alfred Kingon, the U.S. envoy to the EEC, told reporters that if
the EEC counterattacked against U.S. retaliation, the United States
would itself take further steps. ``It is fair to assume we will do
something in response. We are working on it,'' he said.
   Klingon said the United States asked the EEC on Friday to delay
the ban for a brief period to allow a new U.S. administration and a
new EEC executive Commission, which both take office in January, to
settle the dispute. He said he was disappointed the EEC did not have
``the flexibility or the willingness'' to grant the request.
   De Clercq said the EEC will exempt pet food from its ban imports
of U.S. meat but added, ``We do not expect the Americans to accept
this.''
   He repeated the ban will be imposed for public health reasons.
But the United States argues the use of hormones to fatten animals
poses no health risk and has said the pet food exemption did not
remove its concerns.
   The EEC says pet food accounts for about half of the U.S. imports
but U.S. officials say it represents only 30 percent.
   The EEC foreign ministers also tentatively agreed to counter any
U.S. trade retaliation in reaction to the EEC ban on meat imports,
De Clercq said.
   This would involve a 100 percent duty on U.S. exports to the EEC
of honey, unshelled nuts, dried fruit and canned corn that total
$140.5 million a year. But De Clercq said a final decision will only
be made after Washington retaliates against the EEC hormone ban.
   Depending on the extent of U.S. retaliation, other products might
be added to the list, De Clercq said.
   Speaking of recent meetings with U.S. officials to avert a
trans-Atlantic trade war over the hormone ban, De Clercq said
``dialogue of the deaf'' was continuing.
   He said the EEC was interested in limiting the damage of the
conflict by finding ways to narrow the extent of a possible trade
war.
   In late November, De Clercq warned U.S. retaliation against the
EEC ban would spark both retaliatory measures and action against the
United States within the Geneva-based General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade.
   The EEC has said its ban on hormone-treated meat is legal under
the rules of the GATT, the 96-nation world trade organization.

<HEAD>Another Virus Found In Packaged Software</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Another virus has been discovered in packaged
computer software, raising further concerns about the safety of
commercially available programs.
   The latest virus was not dangerous and was spotted after only
about 400 copies of the software had been shipped, but it
highlighted again the vulnerability of software producers to viruses.
   ``This is widespread. This is affecting the biggest names in
software publishing you can think of right now, across the board,''
said Dr. Bruce Tizes, a director and owner of MacGuide magazine in
Lakewood, Colo.
   A virus is a fragment of computer code that attaches itself to
other programs and spreads through a computer system. Some can wipe
out or alter information, while others such as the so-called nVIR
virus cause no serious harm.
   The first known case of packaged software being secretly
corrupted was in early 1987 in Freehand, a program from Aldus Corp.
of Seattle. The hidden program flashed a message on the screen
conveying a ``universal message of peace'' but did not cause any
harm.
   The latest virus, a strain of nVIR, was found in seven programs
on a compact disk from Quantum Leap Technology Inc., of Coral
Gables, Fla. The virus was detected with special virus screening
programs.
   The disk is the second edition of a CD Rom called MegaROM that is
for Apple Macintosh computers. The virus infected the disk _ a type
of compact disk used to store computer data _ when it was being
prepared for duplication at Nimbus Records in Charlottesville, Va.,
according to John Sands, technical operations manager of the CD Rom
division of Nimbus Records.
   Sands said the virus came from a piece of software residing on a
hard disk drive for Macintosh computers that was manufactured by CMS
Enhancements Inc. of Tustin, Calif. He faulted CMS for not alerting
its disk drive customers, such as Nimbus, about the virus threat.
   CMS President Jim Farooque said in an interview Monday that he
had not been able to verify that the virus had come from his
company. He conceded some of his employees had told people at Nimbus
previously that the virus had come on a CMS floppy disk used to
prepare the hard disk for receiving data. But he said, ``It's
possible that ... they are communicating back and forth information
that may or may not be true.''
   Farooque said the company voluntarily was helping people get rid
of the viruses without admitting responsibility for them.
   Quantum Leap was alerted to the virus on Dec. 9 and began
alerting recipients of the infected MegaRom disks last week,
according to the president, Robert Burr. The infected disks are
imprinted with a green decorative pattern. Sands said new disks that
are virus-free and have a blue pattern are being shipped out as
replacements.
   Almost half of the infected disks were shipped to members of the
computer press for review. The disks are filled with programs, known
as shareware or freeware, that are available for free from places
such as computer bulletin boards.
   Computer viruses are far more widespread in commercially
available software than is generally realized, Tizes said. He said
MacGuide was assembling demonstration software from major publishers
for its own CD Rom disk and found seven strains of the nVIR virus in
programs from seven major publishers.
   ``Invariably the companies didn't know'' about the viruses when
he alerted them, said Tizes, a medical doctor. He said one had
already made a recall of the infected disks, which had been shipped
out to pilot customers.

   Takeover strategist Carl Icahn has purchased
another 1 million shares of Texaco Inc., raising his stake to 16.22
percent of the third-largest U.S. oil company, Icahn disclosed
Monday.
   In a routine filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
Icahn also included a letter addressed to Texaco's president James
Kinnear in which Icahn denied rumors of improperly acting in concert
with an unidentified investor to acquire Texaco stock. Icahn is
Texaco's largest single stockholder.
   ``I've read with interest newspaper reports that unnamed Texaco
officials have been speculating that I may be acting with another
investor or partner in connection with my Texaco holdings,'' Icahn
told Kinnear.
   ``While I think it is inappropriate for any Texaco official to
use the newspapers as a forum to speculate on my intentions, I will
nevertheless respond and tell you I am not acting with any partner
or other undisclosed person with respect to my Texaco holdings.''
   Texaco spokesman Peter Maneri, at the company's White Plains,
N.Y., office, said Texaco customarily declined comment on purchases
of its stock.
   In New York Stock Exchange trading Monday, Texaco rose 75 cents a
share to $51.37{.
   Icahn said in the SEC filing that he holds 39.67 million Texaco
shares, including the 1 million purchased from Dec. 13 to Dec. 14
for prices ranging from $51.37{ to $52.37{. He gave no reason for
increasing the stake.
   Icahn has been increasing his pressure on Texaco in recent weeks,
raising speculation he might resurrect a failed takeover bid for the
company, the largest U.S. oil concern behind Exxon Corp. and Mobil
Corp.
   Last week, Icahn stoked the rumors by disclosing he had purchased
2.6 million shares in early December for an average of $50.37{ a
share.
   Securities analysts have said Icahn's moves evidently reflect his
impatience at the pace of the company's post-bankruptcy
restructuring plan announced earlier this year. That plan has failed
to substantially raise the value of Texaco's 240 million shares
outstanding.
   Last spring, Icahn made an offer for Texaco valued at $14.5
billion, or $60 a share, as part of a shareholder proxy fight to
oust the company's board. But his strategy was defeated by
shareholders loyal to the board.
   But since then, Texaco's dismal stock performance has increased
the possibility that more shareholders would align themselves with
Icahn if he undertook another takeover attempt, analysts have said.

<HEAD>Platinum Takes Another Big Hit; Coffee Continues Percolating</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES LITKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Platinum futures prices closed sharply lower for the third
consecutive session Monday, but recovered some ground after key
South African producers implied the use of Ford Motor Co.'s
platinum-free catalytic converters might be limited to the United
States.
   On other markets, coffee futures prices continued to rise as a
dockworkers' strike in the major producing country of Brazil
promised scarce supplies during the peak consumption season; energy
futures dipped as temperatures rose; and grain and soybean futures
prices fought off early pressures to register modest gains.
   After platinum plunged the daily trading limit of $25 an ounce
for two straight sessions, officials at the New York Mercantile
Exchange increased the limit to $37.50 early Monday and the January
contract promptly hit the new floor.
   That's when South African producers mounted a counterattack,
implying to analysts that Ford's revolutionary catalytic converters
had replaced platinum with palladium _ a metal the plaqtinum
producers contend will be ineffective in dealing with the leaded gas
still very much in use outside the United States.
   ``That may have helped shore up platinum,'' said Bette
Raptopolous of Prudential-Bache Securities, New York, ``but it's a
good guess how much and how long.
   ``The U.S. market was responsible for 55 percent (of the platinum
used in catalytic converters), so if it's not a catastrophe for
platinum,'' she added, ``it's not far from one either.''
   Most of the West's supply of platinum comes from South African
mines. Ford, which announced its technological breakthrough last
week, has declined so far to reveal the new materials in its
converters.
   Platinum rose $4.50 for the spot month, with the contract for
delivery in December reaching $529.30 a troy ounce. But the precious
metal declined $29.20 to $30.70 an ounce for the deferred months.
Palladium, also traded at the New York Mercantile Exchange, was down
$2.15 to $4.40.
   Gold, meanwhile, was up 40 cents to 50 cents an ounce, with
December at the Comex at $414.40 a troy ounce. Silver was up 2.5
cents to 2.8 cents an ounce, with December at $6.11 an ounce.
   Coffee futures enjoyed a fourth straight session of gains at the
New York, Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange as a dockworkers' strike
in Brazil approached the one-week mark and other Central American
exporters and South American rival Colombia were saddled with
problems of their own.
   ``Either there's harvest delays because of bad weather, or
transportation problems getting to port,'' said Sandra Kaul, analyst
with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in New York.
   ``And even those that have the coffee in port are having trouble
because they're only allowed to export so much during each quarter
and they're already at quota,'' she added.
   Coffee futures climbed 3.13 cents to 5.89 cents, with December at
145.38 cents a pound.
   A turnaround in weekly weather forecasts was called the main
culprit in an across-the-board drop in energy futures at the New
York Mercantile Exchange.
   ``They got slapped down a notch because everybody was calling for
colder-than-usual temperatures and they got turned around,'' said
Jim Ritterbusch, vice president for trading and research at Carson
Petroleum Inc. in Chicago. ``Traders bailed out of their long
positions in heating oil and pulled everything else down.''
   Crude oil slipped 0.14 to 0.41 cents, with January at $16.31 a
barrel; heating oil was down 0.75 cent to 1.27 cents, with January
at 50.75 cents a gallon; and unleaded gasoline was 0.45 cent lower
to 0.22 cent higher, January at 45.35 cents a gallon.
   Grain and soybean futures prices were mixed to mostly higher on
the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Traders said both pits opened under pressure because of a lack of
confirmation of a big export deal to the Soviet Union that set up
Friday's rally.
   Rumors the Soviets would buy 400,000 tons of soymeal and 2.5
million tons of corn also was behind increased farmer selling over
the weekend _ a second factor pressuring prices.
   And on top of that, the market reacted early to reports of rain
over the weekend in the soybean growing regions of South America and
a forecast calling for more during the week ahead.
   ``Even though the bears pushed it down a little bit, they never
really broke it,''said Victor Lespinasse, a trader with Dean Witter
Reynolds Inc. in Chicago.
   Wheat was unchanged to 3{ cents higher, with December at $4.36{ a
bushel; corn was 3} cents lower to 1\ cent higher, with December at
$2.70{ a bushel; oats were 1 cent to 3} cents higher, with December
at $2.25\ a bushel; and soybeans were 7 cents to 13{ cents higher,
with January at $7.93{ a bushel.
   Livestock and pork futures prices were mixed at the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .38 cent lower to .45 cent higher, with December
at 73.65 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .03 cent to .32 cent
lower, with January at 83.85 cents a pound; live hogs were .35 cent
lower to .83 cent higher, with December at 44.65 cents a pound; and
frozen pork bellies were unchanged to .90 cent higher, with February
at 45.40 cents a pound.

<HEAD>Judge Approves Sale of Eastern Air Shuttle to Trump</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Inserts 2 grafs after 8th graf, ``Trump already,'' with Trump
comment</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   A federal judge on Monday approved the sale of
Eastern Airlines' Northeastern shuttle service to real estate
magnate Donald Trump, a $365 million deal that labor leaders had
challenged as a union-busting effort.
   Texas Air Corp., the Houston-based holding company that is
Eastern's parent firm, has been trying to sell off the profitable
shuttle, arguing that struggling Eastern needs the cash to survive.
   But the carrier's unions have argued that the shuttle sale is
simply a guise for Texas Air's true motive: to dismantle Eastern,
whose 30,000 workers are represented by three militant unions, and
eventually reconstruct it as a non-union airline.
   ``There is no doubt that an ongoing struggle has and will
continue to exist between Eastern and its'' unions, U.S. District
Judge Barrington D. Parker wrote in his opinion. ``However, the
court feels that equally plausible is the idea that management is
seeking to rebuild the company and place it on a sound financial
footing.''
   The transaction must still be approved by the Department of
Transportation, which must affirm that Trump can operate the shuttle
safely and manage it properly.
   The flamboyant Trump announced his agreement to purchase the
shuttle for cash on Oct. 12, saying he would turn the shuttle, which
makes hourly flights among Boston, New York and Washington, into
``an absolute diamond.''
   He said he would rename the service ``The Trump Shuttle,'' and
redecorate its 17 Boeing 727 jetliners, including painting them with
gold, red and black stripes.
   Trump already owns casinos in Atlantic City, N.J., a helicopter
service that flies between the gambling center and New York, the
Plaza Hotel in New York and other prestigious properties.
   Speaking from his New York office, Trump said he planned to begin
service on the new shuttle in February.
   ``This is now a business deal that does not have obstacles in its
path,'' he said.
   Phil Bakes, Eastern's president and chief executive officer, said
the carrier was ``gratified at the court's decision today.''
   ``We're committed to focusing our energies on solving the real
problems at Eastern,'' Bakes added. ``We want to resolve our
economic problems at the bargaining table and would welcome the
presence of the union leaders at the bargaining table to join us in
moving this airline forward.''
   Jack Bavis, chairman of the Air Line Pilots Association, said:
``We're diappointed in the outcome but we'll continiue to do
everything we can to secure the rights and future of Eastern
pilots.''
   Bavis also said the decision ``is not a major setback in our
efforts to prevent Texas Air from dismantling Eastern Airlines. We
are studying the options still available to us and will continue to
pursue this issue in Congress and elsewhere.''
   Joseph Guerrieri Jr., the Washington attorney for the
International Association of Machinists, said the union was
disappointed in Parker's ruling and would appeal it.
   ``Our concern is for the employees who remain with Eastern,''
Guerrieri said. ``We believe this is the death knell for Eastern.''
   The Transport Workers Union, representing Eastern's flight
attendants, also joined the suit.
   On Dec. 2, the unions asked Parker to block the deal, saying it
violated federal labor laws by undermining employees' working
conditions without bargaining over them first with union leaders.
   But Parker ruled that the shuttle deal did not trigger the labor
law's protections. He noted that in September, the courts had
approved a far more severe scheduling constriction by Eastern that
involved 4,000 layoffs, the elimination of service to 14 cities and
the curtailment of 15 percent of the carrier's flights.
   ``The impact of the sale to Trump Shuttle pales in comparison to
the impact of the September 1988 schedule change,'' the judge wrote.
   The shuttle, which employs 850 people and makes 62 flights daily,
has been one of Eastern's few profit-makers, earning an annual
average profit of $17 million over the last five years, according to
Eastern spokesman Robin Matell. Overall, Eastern lost $233.7 million
over the first nine months of 1988, he said.
   Parker wrote that if the unions are right and the airline is not
truly trying to improve itself, ``then Eastern's executives are
acting out a cruel hoax'' upon the government and the public.
   ``The passage of time should prove whether this is true,'' he
said.
   Trump, who testified before Parker on Dec. 7, has vowed to boost
morale at the shuttle and to recognize the unions but has declined
to guarantee current wages for the employees. Eastern has offered to
retain any shuttle workers who wish to remain with the company.
   Texas Air announced in February that it would sell the shuttle
for $225 million to a new subsidiary it planned to form. But
Eastern's unions blocked that transaction in the courts, and Texas
Air Chairman Frank Lorenzo announced in July that the deal had been
canceled.
   Since he acquired Eastern, the nation's sixth largest carrier, in
1986, Lorenzo has been embroiled in bitter disputes with the unions
representing the carrier's mechanics, pilots and flight attendants.
Lorenzo has sought wage concessions, while the unions have countered
with lobbying before Congress and public relations campaigns.
   The sale would give Trump all 17 aircraft, landing and takeoff
slots at airports in Boston, New York and Washington, 14 airport
gates and ground equipment.

<HEAD>New Owner Expected To Help Fast-Food Giant</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: INSERTS new grafs 5-6 with comment from Burger King chairman.</NOTE>

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The British owner-to-be of Burger King is expected
to beef up the chain's standing in the sizzling U.S. fast-food
competition but rivals aren't conceding anything yet, franchisees
and securities analysts said Monday.
   ``They've been almost rudderless. I see these guys from England
coming in and ending (Burger King's) state of confusion,'' said John
P. Uphoff, an analyst in St. Petersburg with Raymond James &
Associates.
   London-based Grand Metropolitan PLC succeeded in its 2{-month
effort to take over Minneapolis-based Pillsbury Co., Burger King's
parent, on Sunday when Pillsbury's board agreed to stop fighting and
accept a $5.68 billion offer for the entire company.
   Grand Met executives have indicated they will move quickly to
improve Miami-based Burger King, which has been criticized by
franchise owners and other industry figures as the company has
slipped further behind kingpin McDonald's.
   ``We're very optimistic,'' Burger King Chairman Jerry Levin said
Monday.
   He said management had not received any word directly from Grand
Met, but ``we believe they are committed to Burger King. We seem to
be performing relatively even with the industry and I certainly
anticipate we will now out-perform the market.''
   Upstart Hardee's and struggling Wendy's have also had
more-positive performances lately than No. 2 Burger King, which last
fiscal year totaled $5.4 billion in sales.
   ``I think that they really believe that Burger King is a diamond
in the rough,'' said Steve Lewis, who owns 23 Burger King
restaurants in the Northeast. ``Amid this whole takeover we (Burger
King) were the key to making this whole thing work.''
   Thomas Ferguson, president of Miami's Beacon Council, which
promotes the area's businesses and community, said: ``We see Grand
Met as a savior.''
   ``Pillsbury kind of treated Burger King like a stepchild and
didn't know what to do with it,'' Ferguson told The Miami News on
Monday.
   Ian Martin, Grand Met's chief executive for U.S. operations,
called Pillsbury ``a perfect fit'' in helping Grand Met become a
world leader in food, drink and retailing.
   ``Pillsbury foods and Burger King will play a vital role in
helping us to realize these objectives,'' Martin said in a
statement. ``The merger will greatly expand Grand Metropolitan's
established presence in the huge U.S. marketplace, while enabling us
to open new business opportunities for Pillsbury in global markets.''
   Burger King, founded in Miami 34 years ago by James McLamore and
David Edgerton, was sold to Pillsbury in 1967 for $18 million. It
had 274 restaurants. It now has 5,578.
   The subsidiary's profits have skidded from $119.2 million in the
1986 fiscal year to $48.2 million in fiscal 1988. It averages $1
million a year in sales per store, compared to $1.5 million for
McDonald's, $920,000 for Hardee's and $786,000 (in 1987) for Wendy's.
   McDonald's total sales for fiscal 1987 were $14.3 billion in its
more than 10,000 restaurants.
   Uphoff suggested the new ownership will want to improve Burger
King's marketing, in the aftermath of much-criticized campaigns such
as the ``Find Herb'' promotion of a few years ago.
   Jay H. Freedman of Kidder Peabody & Co. in New York said to play
catch-up with McDonald's, Burger King must improve consistency.
   ``Even if you can convince them to come in, if you don't give
them an acceptable visit with consistently speedy service, clean
restaurant and restrooms, they're not going to come back,'' Freedman
said.
   Burger King's competitors said they didn't expect the takeover to
have a major impact immediately on their business.
   ``It's going to take some time. Nothing's going to happen
overnight,'' said Dennis Lynch, spokesman for Wendy's, based in
Dublin, Ohio. ``Having a new owner will clarify at least who's
calling the shots, but that doesn't mean there's a strategic plan in
place.''
   For Wendy's, which has been recovering after slipping financially
the past two years, Lynch said the confused situation at Burger King
has ``given us an opportunity to tell our message positively.''
   Hardee's, based in Rocky Point, N.C., has been growing fastest
among the industry's leaders, said spokesman Jerry Singer, and
should hold its own against any new Burger King initiatives.
   From McDonald's Oak Brook, Ill. headquarters, spokesman Chuck
Ebeling said the successful recipe of good service, good value and
cleanliness is what the industry leader concerns itself with.
   ``We don't talk about our competitors or the industry,'' Ebeling
said. ``We speak only of McDonald's. Just because they change
ownership ... they're still Brand X.''

<HEAD>Board Approves Reorganization Plan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The board of directors of Wheeling-Pittsburgh
Steel Corp. on Monday approved the filing of a draft plan of
reorganization, a major step toward the company's emergence from
bankruptcy, the steelmaker said.
   A majority of the directors at a special meeting voted in favor
of filing the plan to U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Wheeling-Pitt said in a
statement.
   The company has been restructuring its debts and operations under
Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code since April 1985.
Creditors were owed about $890 million at the time of the bankruptcy
filing.
   The plan was drafted by the board's reorganization committee,
said Wheeling-Pitt Chairman Lloyd Lubensky, whose ownership of about
34 percent of the company's stock makes him Wheeling-Pittsburgh's
largest stockholder.
   The draft plan does not consider the claims of the United
Steelworkers or the effects of a new basic labor agreement which
must be negotiated, the company said in a written statement.
   The company said it anticipates negotiations will ultimately
result in a final plan of reorganization to be submitted to

<HEAD>Former Developer Receives Prison Sentence in Kansas</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KANSAS CITY, Kan. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge rejected a plea
agreement from developer John A. Kroh Jr. Monday and sentenced him
to two years in prison and ordered him to pay $650,000 in
restitution for bank fraud.
   The case is similar to one that resulted in a 10-year prison term
for Kroh Thursday in Missouri. U.S. District Judge Earl E. O'Connor
sentenced the former president of Kroh Brothers Development Co. to
serve the two-year term consecutively with the 10-year sentence he
received last week.
   In the Kansas case, Kroh pleaded guilty to two counts of an
eight-count indictment on Oct. 14. Under a plea agreement reached
with federal prosecutors, Kroh admitted he understated his
liabilities in financial statements to two Kansas banks from which
he was seeking loans.
   Prosecutors agreed to recommend probation, but O'Connor said he
could not go along with the recommendation, which he called a
tremendous break for Kroh.
   ``The defendant, in all likelihood, judging from the Missouri
case, would more than likely have been convicted here on all counts
just as he was there,'' O'Connor said. ``And in all likelihood a
sentence on the order of what was imposed there in Missouri would
probably have been appropriate here.''
   The judge ordered Kroh to make restitution of $400,000 to Capital
City Bank & Trust of Topeka and $250,000 to Kansas National Bank &
Trust of Prairie Village.
   The cases in the two states stem from the collapse of the Kroh
real estate empire.
   Kroh's brother, George Kroh, pleaded guilty in May to bank fraud
and conspiracy. He served two months in a federal prison. His
original three-year sentence was reduced in July, partly because he
agreed to testify against his brother.

   Black & Decker Inc. said Monday it is
voluntarily recalling two of its coffeemaking machines because of a

   The units being recalled are white Spacemaker Plus TM Thermal
Carafe Coffeemakers, Model PDC401 and Model PDC403, purchased after
July 1988.
   The company said that under certain circumstances, the units may
overheat, creating a fire hazard.
   Owners were asked to stop using them and return them to the

<HEAD>Universal Foods Acquiring Borden Subsidiary</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MILWAUKEE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Universal Foods Inc., which has been fighting a
takeover bid involving a British food conglomerate, announced Monday
it was acquiring Imperial Flavors Inc. of Winter Haven, Fla., a
Borden Inc. subsidiary.
   Milwaukee-based Universal Foods described the acquisition as
unrelated to the current $563 million takeover attempt by High
Voltage Engineering Corp., which is jointly owned by New York-based
investors Clifford Press and Laurence Levy and S&W Berisford PLC,
the British conglomerate.
   The company said the Imperial Flavors acquisition had been in the
works since early November, a month before High Voltage first
announced its offer for Universal Foods.
   High Voltage last week raised its offer for Universal to $35 a
share, a total of about $563.5 million based on Universal's roughly
16.1 million outstanding common shares. High Voltage's initial offer
of $30.50 a share was rejected by Universal earlier this month, and
the company said it would review the latest offer in due course.
   Universal's stock rose 87{ cents to $36 a share Monday on the New
York Stock Exchange.
   Universal Foods said the acquisition of Imperial Flavors, which
has annual sales of about $38 million, would ``allow for increased
sales opportunities and provide significant synergies.''
   Imperial Flavors manufactures and sells flavorings and other
ingredients to the dairy, ice cream, cultured products and bakery
industries.
   Universal Foods is a maker of food colors and flavors, yeast
products, frozen potatoes and Italian-style cheeses.

<HEAD>First Bank System Expects To Lose $300 Million In 1988</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TONY KENNEDY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   First Bank System Inc. will lose about $300
million in its current fiscal year, largely because it will book a
$500 million loss on the sale of a securities portfolio, the bank
holding company announced Monday.
   The bank will sell about $4.6 billion of its $7.5 billion
investment securities portfolio because interest rates have risen on
the money the bank borrowed to buy the securities, said Dick
Schoenke, First Bank vice chairman.
   Schoenke said the loss would not prompt the company to cut back
on employment or on its branch system.
   First Bank is one of the nation's 50 biggest bank holding
companies, and is Minnesota's largest banking concern.
   First Bank's expected $300 million net loss for the year would
follow profits of $49.6 million in 1987 and $202.9 million in 1986.
   When the securities sales are completed in the first quarter of
1989, total assets of First Bank System will be approximately $23
billion, down from the current $28.3 billion, Ankeny said.
   Most of the securities to be sold are government bonds, many of
which were purchased during the third quarter of fiscal 1986. The
$4.6 billion portfolio is earning about 6.93 percent interest,
nearly as much interest as the bank is paying on the $4.1 billion it
borrowed to buy the bonds and other securities, Schoenke said.
   Interest on the short-term loans the bank took out to buy the
securities was increasing, threatening to surpass the amount of
interest the bank is earning on the securities, Schoenke said.
   By selling the securities before they reach maturity, the bank is
losing the $500 million of equity it used to purchase them, Schoenke
said.
   ``We decided to take this action because the anticipated economic
costs, risks and other implications associated with the portfolio
hedging strategy could not be justified,'' said D.H. Ankeny Jr.,
chairman of First Bank. ``In doing so we have substantially reduced
our risk profile and helped position the company for improved
profitability.''
   The action has been reviewed by the Federal Reserve System and
the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. Even accounting for
the sales, First Bank still will exceed minimum regulatory levels
for liquidity, Ankeny said.

<HEAD>Court Rules Against Bank's Sale of Mortgage-Backed Securities</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge ruled Monday against Security
Pacific National Bank and the U.S. Comptroller of the Currency in a
dispute with securities dealers over the bank's sale of
mortgage-backed securities.
   U.S. District Judge Kevin Duffy in New York, ruling in a suit by
the Securities Dealers Association, rejected the comptroller's
decision to allow the bank to sell mortgage-backed securities backed
by its own mortgage loans.
   Bank spokeswoman Martha Goldstein said Security Pacific, the main
unit of the nation's sixth-largest bank holding company, was
considering an appeal. She didn't know if the decision would force
the bank to stop selling mortgage-backed securities pending appeal.
   Duffy ruled that the bank's sale of such securities would violate
the Glass-Steagall Act, Depression-era legislation that, among other
things, limits the rights of banks to enter the securities business.
The association's suit is against the comptroller, and Security
Pacific intervened on behalf of the defendant.
   The dispute centers on the decade-old practice of banks and
savings and loans to sell packages of mortgages on the so-called
secondary market, rather than selling single loans.
   The association maintained in its suit that banks should offer
the mortgage-backed securities through a dealer rather than
packaging and selling the securities themselves.
   In an unrelated matter, a Security Pacific official disclosed
that the bank had added $100 million worth of loans on Arizona real
estate to its list of non-performing loans in the fourth quarter.
The change is balanced by positive developments elsewhere and
doesn't affect the bank's predictions that fourth-quarter earnings,
scheduled for release Jan. 17, will show an increase over the third
quarter, said the official, Senior Vice President Jay Gould.

<HEAD>Mobile Home Manufacturer Fires 87 Who Failed Drug Tests</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EATONTON, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Horton Homes Inc. said Monday it had fired
87 employees who failed a recent round of drug tests, slashing by 13
percent the workforce at the mobile home manufacturer that is
Eatonton's biggest employer.
   The firings on Friday, which were precipitated by a round of drug
tests that began last Tuesday, also triggered a wave of calls by
job-seekers as word of the dismissals spread through the town of
5,000 about 60 miles southeast of Atlanta.
   Rudy Hicks, the company's personnel manager, said the company
undertook the drug testing because apparent employee drug use was
hurting production and quality.
   ``We just can't operate with (drug use),'' Hicks said. ``There's
too much dangerous equipment out there, and it was costing us a
fortune trying to put up with it.''
   Most of those fired after failing drug tests Friday were
production workers, although some were in management, Hicks said.
There is no union for production workers at the plant.
   Horton Homes instituted a voluntary drug rehabilitation program
three years ago, Hicks said, but it had only limited success.
Several months ago, Horton Homes started drug screening for new
employees and notified current workers they would be subject to drug
testing.
   Hicks said the latest tests came after various complaints by
plant employees about co-workers.
   ``When we heard that several times in the last two or three
weeks, we just decided to go ahead and drug test,'' he said.
   ``I'll promise you this. This wasn't done without a lot of tears
and a lot of concern. There's more than just jobs here. There's
homes. There's children. There's Christmases...''
   Horton hired National Health Laboratories to carry out the
urinalysis last Tuesday, testing for marijuana, cocaine, opiates,
amphetamines and PCP. The procedure included a re-test and
verification for samples indicating drug use.
   Of the 87 fired, 31 had participated in the company's voluntary
drug rehabilitation program at one time or another, Hicks said.
   Horton Homes officials had thought the tests would reveal a
higher number of drug users. Hicks said further testing was planned.
   Hicks said some of the fired employees possibly could return to
work at Horton Homes, but that could only occur under stringent
conditions for the employee's rehabilitation.
   Hicks said the firings had ``knocked fire out of production'' in
the plant Friday. But Horton Homes was swamped with job calls Monday
as news of the firings spread, he said.
   ``I had already closed applications for the rest of the year, and
now I'm probably going to have to open them back up,'' Hicks said.
``We probably won't do anything until after Christmas.''

<HEAD>China Makes Its First Loan to Soviet Union</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The state-run Bank of China has joined in a
syndicated $50 million loan to a Soviet bank, marking the first time
China has provided such credit to the Soviet Union, the official
China Daily said Tuesday.
   The daily said the nation's special foreign exchange bank is
participating in a loan repayable over seven years to the Soviet
bank Vnesheconombank.
   Other participants include Postipankki and Skopbank of Finland,
Algemene Bank of the Netherlands and Denmark's Copenhagen Bank and
Provinsbanken. The report did not say how much the Bank of China was
contributing to the loan package.
   The loan is another reflection of growing economic contacts
between China and the Soviet Union that have accompanied a recent
warming of political relations between the two former Communist
adversaries.
   The report said China also has joined in syndicated loans to
Yugoslavia and Hungary. It said the Bank of China enjoys a good
reputation in the West, and banks in the Soviet Union and Eastern
European countries have shown a strong interest in dealing with it.
