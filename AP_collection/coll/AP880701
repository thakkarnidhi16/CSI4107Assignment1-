   Police said Friday they were still
searching for the manager of a U.S. oil company who was kidnapped
by leftist guerrillas this week for a $2 million ransom.
   Giacomo (Jake) Gambini, 42, an Italian-born U.S. citizen, was
abducted by leftist guerrillas Monday as he left his office in
Sabana de Torres, 200 miles north of Bogota, police in the
Department of Santander said.
   They said the rebels belonged to the pro-Cuban National
Liberation Army and were demanding $2 million in ransom.
   Gambini's hometown in the United States was not immmediately
available. In a telephone interview with The Associated Press
Friday night, Charles Gambini of Galveston, Texas, confirmed that
his brother Jake had been kidnapped in Colombia, but refused to
comment further.
   Police said Gambini worked for the Piper company, which
according to industry sources provides technical advice to
companies searching for oil in northeast Colombia.
   The National Liberation Army has attacked several oil pipelines
and abducted technicians in an attempt to pressure the Colombian
government to cancel contracts with foreign petroleum companies.

   ``Buddy swung,'' singer Joe Williams said Friday
before opening the JVC Jazz Festival concert celebrating the music
of the late drummer and band leader Buddy Rich.
   ``He drummed the impossible drum,'' Mike Greene, president of
the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences, said in giving
a citation of merit to Rich's daughter Cathy Rich, who produced the
concert.
   The evening at Carnegie Hall was a mixture of the classy and the
homey. Williams and Mel Torme sang impeccably and with warmth.
Louis Bellson played a couple of exciting and varied drum solos.
There were film clips of Rich in the late 1930s and early 1940s
with the Artie Shaw and Tommy Dorsey bands.
   Williams sang ``There Will Never Be Another You'' and
``Honeysuckle Rose'' in front of the Buddy Rich Big Band. Torme
included ``Here's That Rainy Day,'' which he said was Rich's
favorite from a 1978 album they made, ``Together Again for the
First Time.''
   Cathy Rich sang a song praising her father while slides from the
family scrapbook were shown. The last number was the lengthy ``Two
in One Suite,'' with Rich's drumming recorded in Las Vegas in 1968
and the band playing. Annie Ross and Dominick Allen, souding very
good, sang new, sometimes treacly lyrics in praise of Rich.
   Also appearing were saxophonist Stan Getz, who played Thad
Jones' ``Yours and Mine,'' which he and Rich once heard together at
the Village Vanguard, and singers Jon Hendricks and Company and
Marlena Shaw.
   Rich, who died in 1987 at age 69, was a self-taught drummer
credited with ``the fastest hands in the world.'' His career
spanned vaudeville, the Big Band era and decades on the road.

   Bill Roberts, 63, a veteran
political manager who engineered President Reagan's early campaign
triumphs and a major figure in California Republican politics for
more than three decades, died Thursday.
   Among hundreds of California campaigns managed by Roberts,
either independently or with longtime colleague Stu Spencer, were
Reagan's successful campaigns for governor in 1966 and 1970 and
George Deukmejian's gubernatorial campaign in 1982.
   The most recent statewide campaign managed by Roberts was the

   Robert O. Fishel, American League Executive Vice
President and major-league executive for more than 40 years, died
Thursday, apparently of a heart attack at age 74.
   Fishel began his connection with baseball as an advertising
executive, handling the Indians' Radio Network account for a local

Browns by owner Bill Veeck, who had owned the Indians during
Fishel's time in Cleveland.
   Fishel joined the Yankees as publicity director in 1954 and
served with them for 20 years. He rose to a vice-presidency before
joining the American League in 1974 as a special assistant to AL
President Lee MacPhail, his former boss with the Yankees. Four
years later, Fishel was voted League Secretary and was elected
Executive Vice President in 1983.

<TEXT>
   International celebrities, including
music star Paul Simon, have joined in a campaign to save the
world's largest example of Portuguese colonial architecture in
downtown Salvador, one of the Western Hemisphere's oldest cities.
   The 91-acre district is now a slum.
   It is called Pelourinho, the Portuguese word for ``pillory,''
stemming from Salvador's former slave trade.
   Pelourinho's largely abandoned facades line the narrow streets
of the city that also was Brazil's first capital and sometimes is
known to outsiders as Bahia, the name of the coastal city's state.
   In addition to Paul Simon, other international celebrities
involved in the campaign include the Spanish crooner Julio Iglesias
and Akio Morito, president of the Sony Corp.
   Of the district's 978 buildings, some dating as far back as the
1500s, 300 are close to collapse, 48 are in ruins, and about 10
slide down hillsides every year in seasonal rainstorms, according
to Maria del Carmen, coordinator of the save-Pelourinho campaign.
   Pelourinho's spacious mansions housed the elite when Salvador
was, until 1763, the capital of Portugal's vast South American
Colony. Today it is a Skid Row, home to prostitutes, drug dealers
and muggers.
   ``Pelourinho must be the world's largest Baroque slum,'' said
the Bahia state secretary for culture, Gilberto Gil, who also is a
popular singer and composer. ``There are people in this city who
haven't dared venture into Pelourinho for the past 20 years.''
   But for the first time authorities, encouraged by private
business, have launched a massive campaign to clean up the winding
streets and half-collapsed mansions, which in 1987 were designated
by UNESCO as part of mankind's ``cultural heritage.'' The buildings
are protected from demolition by a local decree.
   ``If we don't do something now, the whole beautiful area will be
completely irrecoverable in 10 years,'' said Ms. del Carmen, an
engineer.
   But conversely, it was after the UNESCO designation that the
colonial buildings, arcades, courtyards and cobblestone streets
began fell into greater disarray.
   ``Landlords refused to invest in their properties, which were
inhabited by tenants who could pay almost no rent,'' Gil said.
``And they weren't allowed to tear down their buildings. So the
strategy was to let the buildings literally fall down _ with
tenants inside them.''
   So far, the so-called Historical Park of Pelourinho, operating
with 150 functionaries borrowed from various municipal government
offices, has raised the equivalent of about $7 million in
government grants and loans, Ms. del Carmen said. But organizers
hope a media campaign that began in February directed at foreign
and domestic business communities will bring in much more.
   Morita, Simon and Iglesias are featured in 60-second public
service announcements asking for donations and encouraging
businesses to invest in the area.
   ``We need Brazilians and others to feel responsible for the
area, to understand that Brazil was born here and want to leave
this for their children,'' Ms. del Carmen said. ``Most of the
people who actually live here exist in subhuman conditions and
could care less about Pelourinho.''
   Black groups have been some of the most active in rallying to
save the decaying center, as part of a slow but growing
black-consciousness movement in mixed-race Brazil.
   Pelourinho was a major port of entry for slaves from Africa from
the 1500s through 1888, when slavery was abolished in Brazil. One
of the area's most beautiful buildings, the Rosary of the Blacks
Church, was built over a period of 150 years by and for slaves.
   ``Every stone here was laid with the sweat of blacks,'' said an
area resident known only as ``Zoinho.'' ``We have to save this
area. It's a monument to our suffering.''
   Paulo de Jesus, 18, lives with his father and four brothers and
sisters in two rooms of a massively subdivided old home. He was
born in Pelourinho.
   ``I wouldn't leave this place,'' he said. ``This is my home. But
if you knocked down our old home and built an apartment building in
it's place, we'd be much happier.''
   Some residents are worried that increased property values will
drive out long-time inhabitants.
   ``We have to make sure we don't turn Pelourinho into a picture
postcard,'' Ms. del Carmen said. ``The sense of community here is
rich and very strong. We need to bring in jobs, schools, health
facilities and give people the chance to appreciate the fabulous
historicl setting.''

<HEAD>Reagan Sends Letter to Mexican President On Puerto Rican
Separatist</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Reagan sent a letter to President
Miguel de la Madrid regarding Mexico's refusal to extradite a
Puerto Rican separatist accused of being a terrorist, the U.S.
Embassy said Friday.
   U.S. Ambassador Charles Pilliod delivered the letter to de la
Madrid Friday afternoon, U.S. Embassy spokesman Arturo Montano said.
   He said he did not have any details of the message concerning
37-year-old William Morales, who was freed from a Mexican prison
June 24 and allowed to leave on a flight to Cuba.
   A spokesman at de la Madrid's office said the president would
respond to Reagan's letter ``as soon as possible.'' He did not
comment on the contents of the Reagan message but said de la Madrid
told Pilliod he has instructed the Foreign Ministry to respond to a
State Department protest delivered earlier this week to the Mexican
ambassador in Washington.
   In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said
Pilliod had personally carried the letter to de la Madrid but she
also would not discuss the contents.
   Mrs. Oakley said there had been no change in the U.S.
government's outrage at the release of Morales.
   The State Deparment has called Morales a ``convicted terrorist
and murderer.''
   Montano said Pilliod returned to Mexico Thursday night from
Washington where he had been recalled for consultations Tuesday.
Mexico did not advise the United States that it had released
Morales until Tuesday, U.S. officials have said.
   Mexican officials frequently characterized Morales as a
``political fighter,'' not a criminal, and local news reports
usually did not mention Morales conviction in Mexico for murder.
   Morales was released after serving five years of an eight-year
sentence for the 1983 slaying of a Mexican police officer and for
entering the country illegally.
   At the time of that killing, Morales was an escaped convict from
the United States, having fled in 1979 from a U.S. prison after
being convicted of weapons and explosives charges in New York.
   After his capture in Mexico the United States pressed without
success for his extradition.

   Officials could relax state restrictions
on pesticide spraying in an effort to control the pear thrips, an
insect blamed for defoliating thousands of acres of maple trees in
southern Vermont.
   Officials of the state Department of Forests, Parks and
Recreation, along with experts from the University of Vermont and
entomologists experienced with thrips from other northeastern
states, have come up with a research project designed to learn more
about the insect's habits, life cycle and impact on maple crops and
products.
   Pear thrips are insects whose feeding habits have damaged and
weakened thousands of acres of Vermont sugarbush, particularly in
Bennington and Windham counties.
   The plans that experts have laid to improve the lot of maple
trees may involve asking Gov. Madeleine Kunin to relax her 1986
policy strictly limiting pesticide spraying by state agriculture
and transportation officials.
   William Paine, deputy commissioner of agriculture, has done a
control pesticide test spray on a sugarbush in Londonderry with
state permission to discover the most effective stage to spray in
the thrips' life cycle.
   State forester Bill Guenther said recently the committee also
wants to check for trends using an earth-orbiting satellite that
takes color coded infrared snapshots of Vermont forest land.
   The photos, which would cost between $10,000 and $12,000, could
give foresters a better idea of what next year's maple crop will
look like since the camera picks up signs of weakness and disease
that human eyes can miss.
   Project members also plan to send out questionnaires to all
known Vermont sugarmakers, asking them to comment on the extent of
thrips damage.

   Ronald and Nancy Reagan recall the white lies they
told each other on their first date, and Reagan's daughter,
Maureen, remembers her surprise when a friend told her she found
the U.S. president sexy.
   These are a few of the tidbits of Reagan lore that British
television viewers will see on July 8, when the first of a
three-part series on the life of Reagan is broadcast.
   The film, shown to journalists Thursday, is filled with varied
assessments of Reagan.
   To Secretary of State George P. Shultz, the president is ``a
revolutionary and he's changed the agenda (in) the most sweeping
presidency in this country probably since Franklin Roosevelt.''
   Former budget director David Stockman calls Reagan's economic
policies ``the singular greatest episode of sustained economic
mismanagement in the 20th-century history of the United States.''
   But Mrs. Reagan says of her husband: ``I think he made people
feel good about themselves, good about the country. We now have a
strong economy, unemployment is down, interest rates are down. ...''
   The film traces Reagan to his Midwestern boyhood, interviewing
friends and schoolmates.
   Actress Olivia de Havilland recalls Reagan and the late actor
Errol Flynn lining up as soldiers so that Flynn's shoulder obscured
Reagan.
   She says Reagan quietly kicked the sand into a mound, ``higher
and higher, and finally, when the photographer said, `All right
everybody, let's smile,' the future president of the United States
stepped up on the mound and towered over Errol Flynn.''
   Interviewer Godfrey Hodgson asked Reagan why he spied for the
FBI on colleagues in the Screen Actors Guild of which he was
president.
   ``They (the FBI) came wanting some advice, some findings on
people that I had dealt with, and I got an insight into what was
happening to the motion picture business. It did give me a real
understanding of the communist menace,'' Reagan says.
   Mrs. Reagan recalls their first date when, mutually wary, they
both said they had ``early morning calls'' so that they could leave
early if they didn't like each other.
   They got home at 2:30 a.m, she says. ``I think by that time both
of us knew that neither one us of had an early morning call.''
   Maureen Reagan, Reagan's daughter by his first marriage to
actress Jane Wyman, says a friend who saw Reagan doing a TV ad
dressed as a cowboy exclaimed to her that ``he's so sexy.''
   ``I said, my father sexy? You must be kidding. `No no, he's
wonderful.' And he is wonderful,'' Miss Reagan says.
   During his 50-minute interview, Reagan describes his wife as ``a
helpmeet such as I think every man dreams of having, a relationship
that sort of matches your dreams of marriage when you were an
adolescent.''
   He laughs about claims that she interferes in policy-making.
   ``She doesn't go down and get involved in affairs like
disarmament or anything else. She advises me of what she thinks is
good for me, and I feel free to confide in her the things that are
going on.
   ``As a matter of fact she's a help just by my knowing that she's
up there when I go to meet her at the end of the day.''

<HEAD>Supreme Court Will Take Another Look at Death Penalty</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The constitutionality of the death penalty for
juvenile killers again will be on the Supreme Court's agenda next
term, a welcome surprise for capital punishment foes.
   Leigh Dingerson, head of the National Coalition to Abolish the
Death Penalty, said, ``It's very encouraging. I assumed it would be
another couple of years before they took the issue up in another
case.''
   Henry Schwarzschild of the American Civil Liberties Union said
the court's willingness to restudy the issue ``is very startling.''
But he cautioned against reading too much into the court's
announcement.
   ``It's foolish to try and predict what the court will do,'' he
said.
   The justices on Thursday provided a dramatic epilogue to their
1987-88 term by agreeing to consider banning capital punishment for
all juvenile murderers when the court returns for the next term on
the first Monday in October.
   Just 24 hours earlier, the court had come close to banning the
death penalty for those who commit murders before they are 16.
   Few expected it would move so quickly to re-examine capital
punishment for juvenile killers.
   But the justices said Thursday they will use cases from Georgia
and Missouri to reconsider the fate of young killers. The court
said it will decide sometime in 1989 whether use of the death
penalty for anyone under 18 when the crime was committed violates
the Constitution's ban on ``cruel and unusual punishment.''
   The court will consider overturning the death sentences of
Georgia death row inmate Jose Martinez High, who was 17 when he
participated in a 1976 murder, and Missouri death row inmate Heath
Wilkins, who was 16 when he committed a 1985 murder.
   High was just weeks shy of his 18th birthday when he took part
in a gas station robbery in Taliferro County, Ga., in which an
11-year-old boy was shot to death.
   Wilkins helped rob an Avondale, Mo., liquor store. Nancy Allen,
a store clerk, was fatally stabbed.
   The National Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty said 30
death row inmates nationwide _ out of a total of 2,100 _ were under
18 when they committed their crimes.
   Of the 100 men and women executed in the United States since the
Supreme Court reinstated capital punishment in 1976, three
committed their crimes when they were 17. Since 1948, no one has
been executed for a crime committed when he or she was younger than
17.
   If the Supreme Court bans the death penalty for those under 18,
it would affect most of the 37 states with death penalty laws _
including those that do not specify a minimum age for killers
subject to capital punishment and states that specify age limits
under 18.
   On Wednesday, four justices said the death penalty is
unconstitutional for those who were younger than 16 when they
committed murder. Three justices said the Constitution does not set
such age limits for executions.
   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor provided a fifth vote to throw out
the death penalty for a convicted Oklahoma killer who was 15 when
he helped kill his former brother-in-law. But O'Connor stopped just
short of calling for abolition of capital punishment for killers
under 16.
   A key vote in next term's cases will be provided by Justice
Anthony M. Kennedy, who joined the court in February, too late to
participate in the Oklahoma case.
   In other action Thursday, the court:
   _Agreed to study alleged race discrimination in Alaskan salmon
canneries, setting the stage for an important sequel to the court's
ruling on Wednesday that makes it easier for workers to prove their
bosses are guilty of illegal bias.
   _Cleared away the last legal obstacle to a $180 million
settlement _ with interest now worth some $240 million _ between
Vietnam veterans and manufacturers of the herbicide Agent Orange.
The court let stand rulings dismissing lawsuits by about 300
veterans who challenged the settlement, in which as many as 250,000
others could participate.
   _Agreed to decide whether states may ban virtually all lawyer
advertisements that feature testimonials or client endorsements.
The justices will review a California rule that presumes such ads
are false or misleading.

<TEXT>
   Even in the jet age, a 55-hour trip is a
pretty brisk pace for a U.S. Secretary of State.
   How does George Shultz do it? Also: Why?
   He does it by relying on what appear to be enormous reserves of
energy. But why did he decide to sweep through Guatemala, El
Salvador, Honduras and Costa Rica in his first trip to the region
since 1986?
   Some senior members of Congress are puzzled. Is Shultz trying to
lay the groundwork for a new U.S. drive to win support for the
Nicaraguan rebels known as Contras?
   And why did he ignore appeals from the Nicaraguan leader, Daniel
Ortega, that he stop in Managua?
   A senior official who briefed reporters before Shultz's
departure Wednesday said renewed aid for the Contras would not be a
major focus of the trip,
   Shultz apparently shunned Ortega because U.S. policy calls for
avoiding Sandinista leaders until they display what the Reagan
administration regards as serious interest in moving toward a
democratic system.
   From Ortega's perspective, that would be a lot easier to do if
the United States stopped trying to overthrow the Nicaraguan
government.
   Sandinista leaders have been appealing to the Contras to resume
peace talks, but the Contras say the Nicaraguan government would
have to take certain steps first.
   These include granting permission to open a television station
not run by the government, allow the taking of public opinion
polls, declaring a general amnesty and suspending military
recruitment.
   And so, round and round they go, with the prospect of renewed
fighting always there.
   Peace talks ended June 9. The cease-fire has lasted three
months, but the thousands of Contra soldiers who took sanctuary in
Honduras during the lull may be ready to fight again. They are
rested and have received food, clothing and medicine from the
United States.
   Shultz hopes the leaders of Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras and
Costa Rica will pressure Nicaragua to take a more flexible position
on peace talks with the Contras.
   U.S. aid to the rebels ended Feb. 29, and the mood on Capitol
Hill is strongly against a resumption. Ostensibly, the
administration is trying to decide what to do. Conservatives on its
right flank do not want to see the Contras foresaken.
   Critics have insisted from the start that President Reagan's
objective is to overthrow the Sandinista government one way or
another.
   Shultz's harsh rhetoric over the past six years has lent support
to this theory. ``The Sandinistas seek to build totalitarian
society on the back of a massive military machine,'' he said
Thursday in Honduras.
   The softened tone Reagan and Shultz have taken lately toward the
Soviet Union is not duplicated in this hemisphere. Cuba and
Nicaragua remain anathema to them, and a test of U.S. resolve in
Central America.
   The military takeover in Haiti was a setback to U.S. hopes. The
State Department has stopped ticking off proudly the number of
countries in the hemisphere deemed to have turned democratic since
Reagan entered the White House 7{ years ago.
   But Shultz made the point in Tegucigalpa on Thursday that
Nicaragua's per-person income is the lowest in the region while the
picture is brighter elsewhere.
   ``Nicaragua is out of step, a country isolated by its rejection
of freedom, growth and the security of its neighbors,'' he said.
   Fidel Castro is firmly in charge in Cuba, and Ortega may be in
Nicaragua. But there is an armed resistance in Nicaragua and Reagan
and Shultz have not lost hope the rebels will force a change in
Managua before the administration shuts down in January.

<HEAD>Traditional Pork Barrel Bill Comes Up Lean</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID GOELLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The first fiscal 1989 appropriations bill, a
bare-bones energy and water development package, is a Senate vote
away from heading to President Reagan's desk.
   The $17.83 billion package worked out by House and Senate
negotiators cleared the House on a 384-17 roll call Thursday and is
expected to win easy Senate approval next week following the July
Fourth recess.
   The spending bill, the product of a tight-money year, is more
noteworthy for what it lacks than what it contains.
   There is no money to begin construction of the superconducting
super collider and, lawmakers say, not a dime to start work on new
Army Corps of Engineers and Bureau of Reclamation water projects.
   Members of Congress and staffers say they can't recall when even
huge budget deficits prevented at least a few new dams or harbor
projects from being tossed into the traditional pork barrel bill.
   The administration is not happy about the lack of construction
money for the SSC, the multi-billion dollar high-energy physics
project that backers say is needed to keep the United States
technologically competitive.
   The White House, however, has not made any veto threats against
the energy and water bill as it has against a number of the other
12 spending bills under consideration in Congress.
   Leaders on both sides the Capitol agreed to give the Energy
Department $100 million next year to continue preliminary work on
the SSC, but they said a decision to build it should be made by the
next president.
   The bill contains money to continue construction work on more
than 200 corps and bureau water projects.
   Although the administration sought six new corps starts, the
House and Senate Appropriations committees approved none, taking
the position that just one new start would set off a clamor among
lawmakers for more.
   More than two-thirds of the money in the bill _ $13.16 billion _
is headed for the Department of Energy, with that agency's nuclear
activities for the Defense Department accounting for $8.1 billion.
   The non-defense portion of the department's budget would finance
a variety of activities, including research into solar and other
renewable forms of energy and environmental restoration and safety
programs.
   At the Senate's insistance, the bill contains $3 million to
study the ``greenhouse effect,'' the global warming trend that
scientists say threatens the Earth with climate changes and rising
ocean waters.
   The corps would have $11 million less next year than in fiscal
1988 to spend on dams, harbors and other work, including a growing
number of shoreline erosion projects.
   The Bureau of Reclamation, which operates irrigation and power
facilities in the West, would get $40 million more in fiscal 1989,
with more than 40 percent of the money going to three large
projects: Central Arizona, Central Utah and Central Valley in
California.

   Newly born Siamese twins with two heads but one
body were in stable condition today in a Hong Kong hospital with a
good chance of survival, a doctor said.
   The two boys, born Thursday, have two spines but only one pair
of legs and one pair of arms, said Professor C.Y. Yeung, head of
the Queen Mary Hospital's pediatrics department.
   Yeung said an operation to separate the twins, who weighed nine
pounds at birth, was ``almost impossible.''
   He said, ``So far they have a good chance to survive but cases
like that may have underlying problems in the future.''
   Yeung refused to give more details about the twins or identify
them. He said it was up to the parents to decide whether more
information should be released.

<HEAD>Challenger Widow Fears for Next Shuttle Crew</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The widow of space shuttle Challenger pilot
Michael Smith, who sued the makers of shuttle rockets blamed for
the Challenger explosion, says she will be praying for the safety
of the next shuttle crew.
   Shuttle Discovery _ which has undergone 210 modifications and
seven months of delay _ will be the first shuttle flight since
Challenger exploded in January 1986 killing all seven aboard. The
launch is scheduled for Sept. 4.
   ``I'll be saying my prayers for the crew and their families,''
Jane Smith told The Houston Post after giving a tearful deposition
on Wednesday to lawyers for U.S. government contractor Morton
Thiokol. ``I hope they'll be safe.''
   Mrs. Smith and her three children are the only relatives of the
Challegner crew who haven't settled a lawsuit with the government
or Thiokol. Last May, the 42-year-old widow filed a $1.5 billion
wrongful death suit against Thiokol, the government and the
director of NASA's solid rocket booster program.
   Since then, a Florida federal judge has denied two of her three
claims _ that Thiokol be banned from supplying booster rockets for
NASA shuttles and that the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration be named as a defendant in the lawsuit.
   Mrs. Smith's remaining claim _ which will be heard in a Virginia
federal court Sept. 12 _ is aimed at Thiokol's decision to
recommend the ill-fated launch.
   A leaking seal on one of the booster rockets was blamed for the
Challenger explosion.

<HEAD>Four Sentenced For Passing Secrets To U.S.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three former government officials and
a Nicaraguan businessman have been sentenced for passing economic
secrets to the United States, news reports said.
   The pro-government Nuevo Diario newspaper said Thursday that
Nora Aldana Centeno, a former planning official, and Mario Jose
Alegria Castillo, an official of the Superior Council of Private
Enterprise, were sentenced Wednesday to 16 years for passing secret
economic documents to U.S. Embassy officials.
   They were arrested in late May and were accused of ``taking
documents with the classification `secret,''' the paper said.
   Alegria Castillo, director of the council's Institute of
Economic and Social Research, also was charged with organizing ``a
network of informants in some Nicaraguan state institutions,'' it
added.
   Pedro Su Olivas, a Central Bank official, and Adrian Espinales,
of the Commerce and Industry Ministry, each drew a three-year term
for providing the information to Algeria which then passed it to
the United States.
   The opposition newspaper La Prensa called the 16-year sentences
``barbaric'' and said lawyers for all four defendants planned to
appeal.
   It quoted lawyers for Aldana Centeno and Alegria Castillo as
saying their clients had been convicted of a non-existent crime
because Nicaragua has no laws about revealing secret documents.

<HEAD>Dukakis Campaigns With UAW; Bush Returns To Maine</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Will be topped after 10 a.m. EDT appearance by Dukakis in
Dayton</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT GREENE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Republican George Bush and Democrat Michael Dukakis gave
contrasting pictures of the economy as Republicans continued work
on a party platform that they said would have more meat than the
Democratic document.
   The disagreements over how well off Americans really are
occurred as Dukakis prepared to visit a United Auto Workers union
hall in Dayton, Ohio, and Bush returned to his vacation home in
Kennebunkport, Maine, for a celebration of his mother's 87th
birthday today.
   Dukakis was returning tonight to Boston, where he and his wife,
Kitty, planned to celebrate the Fourth of July with Jesse Jackson
and his wife, Jackie.
   Jackson, who has pressed for an offer of the No. 2 position on
the Democratic ticket, will meet Monday night with Dukakis, said
Dayton Duncan, Dukakis' campaign press secretary. The aide gave no
indication what the two might discuss.
   The Massachusetts governor faced continued heat from opponents
in the Statehouse who criticized him for campaigning while the
state ended its fiscal year with a nearly $400 million deficit
Thursday and without a budget for the next year. A series of tax
bills and fee-raising measures to help the state pay for expanded
spending in fiscal 1989 was nearing enactment.
   Bush told a luncheon group in New York that paid $10,000 a
couple to hear him speak that the country has been enjoying an
economic recovery since late 1982, the longest peacetime expansion
in history. He said that two years ago economists predicted a
downturn that hasn't arrived.
   ``Wrong, wrong, wrong,'' Bush said. ``No wonder it's called the
`dismal science.'''
   Bush said: ``Liberals promise compassion but they deliver
misery.''
   Dukakis told employees at a Reynolds Aluminum Co. plant outside
Chicago that the average weekly wage for jobs lost between 1979 and
1985 was $440, while the average weekly pay for new jobs during
that period was only $270.
   ``Too many of our families are struggling to hold on, challenged
by change, anxious about their jobs, burdened by the rising costs
of health care and housing and college tuition, troubled by the
lack of quality affordable child care,'' Dukakis said.
   Republicans meeting in Los Angeles to draft a party platform
criticized the Democrats' platform document as lacking content and
trying to conceal a tax and spend policy.
   Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole of Kansas said the Democrats
kept their platform short because ``they don't have much to talk
about. ... I mean, who wants to talk about raising your taxes and
more regulation and more spending?''
   Dole, asked if he wanted the No. 2 job, said: ``I don't think
it's a question of wanting it. ... It's a question of winning the
election, helping your party and trying to help your country. I'd
want to be majority leader if I had my choice.''
   Rep. Jack Kemp of New York told reporters at the meeting he does
not expect to be picked by Bush as a running mate, but said Dole
might be.
   ``I'm not after it because I don't think it's going to be
offered,'' said Kemp, adding that from ``all of the signals, all of
the press reports coming out of the Bush campaign, it sounds to me
like they're leaning to Bob Dole.''
   Dukakis won the backing Thursday of the political action
committee of the National Education Association, the nation's
largest teacher union. The 1.9-million member union's board is
scheduled to meet today and almost certainly concur with the PAC's
choice.
   NEA officials said the endorsement applies only to the
Democratic nomination. The union won't make a final presidential
endorsement until Sept. 8, after both parties have held their
conventions.
   Jackson refused to comment on whether he would use the Dukakis
visit to disclose whether he wants to pursue the second spot on the
ticket.
   ``At this point, I will simply pursue the process and convey my
private conclusions to Gov. Dukakis'' later, he said.
   Bush and Dukakis played a game of role reversal Thursday in
response to a pair of polls that showed the two candidates tied or
Bush trailing Dukakis only slightly. Earlier polls have given
Dukakis double-digit leads.
   ``I can only say what I've been saying for 16 months,'' Dukakis
said. ``Early polls are meaningless.''
   Bush, in New York, declared ``I'm feeling like Harry Truman,''
and depicted himself as a comeback winner.

<HEAD>More Than 1 Million Children Official Non-Entities</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than one million children in China
officially do not exist because they were born outside state birth
control targets, rendering them unable to receive food rations,
schooling and job assignments, an official report said.
   The children, most of whom are under age 10, are commonly
referred to as ``black children.'' They are children whose parents
did not have their births registered or who were refused
registration by local authorities, the People's Daily reported
Thursday.
   Under China's one-child policy, officials in each county are
responsible for ensuring that each woman has only one child and
that the number of births in the county does not exceed the birth
target set by the state.
   Parents are penalized for having more than one child, and
officials are penalized if the county goes over the number of
births that it is allowed. Officials, however, are financially
rewarded if births stay within the target.
   Some parents did not register births of their second or
subsequent children to avoid paying the fine, the paper said. Fines
vary from region to region, but are generally $270 or more per year
for five years, a huge fine by Chinese standards.
   Some local officials, seeing their bonuses jeapordized by too
many births, simply refuse to register new babies, the paper said.
   In one city in southwestern China's Sichuan province, local
officials refused to register the births of 450 babies because the
birth target had already been reached, the report said.
   Without a residence permit, children are deprived of the rights
of a Chinese citizen. They do not receive their ration of rice and
edible oil, are unable to register for school and will not be able
to get a job, join the military or sit for college entrance exams
when they grow up, the newspaper said.
   The problem will become even greater when these children marry
and have children of their own, who also will be unable to get
residence permits, it said.
   The situation is most serious in the provinces of Hebei,
Shandong, Jiangxi and Guizhou. In each of these provinces, ``black
children'' number more than 70,000, the report said.
   State officials have called attention to the problem, saying
that the children are innocent victims, the newspaper reported.
   They said the situation not only hurts the children, it also
affects the nation's family planning and population control efforts
and creates social problems.
   China's birth rate hit 2 percent in 1986 and stayed there last
year. If the trend continues, China's population of 1.08 billion
will double by the year 2030, according to the United Nations Fund
for Population Activities.
   China has said that it must keep the birth rate at 1.5 percent
if it is to meet its goal of keeping the population under 1.2
billion by the year 2000.
   China will mark Asia's Three Billion Population Day today. In a
televised speech for the occasion Chinese Premier Li Peng said
Thursday, ``The country has listed family planning as one of its
basic national policies and taken the control of population growth
as a strategic task.''

Dislike U.S.</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Many Nicaraguans are critical of their leftist
government and don't believe it is democratic, but they think
Soviet policies are better than those of the United States,
according to a private poll.
   A survey presented Thursday as the first independent poll of
Nicaraguan opinion under nine years of Sandinista rule indicates
strong support for President Daniel Ortega, 85 percent opposition
to U.S. Contra aid, and 68 percent disapproval of U.S. policies in
Central America.
   Asked what they most admire about the United States, 42 percent
of those polled said ``nothing,'' which was the most prevalent
answer.
   The Reagan administration for the past seven years has supported
rebels attempting to overthrow the Nicaraguan government.
   The poll of 1,129 adults in Nicaragua was sponsored by the
Catholic University in Managua and research groups in California
and Mexico.
   William Bollinger, director of the cosponsoring Interamerican
Research Center of Los Angeles, said the newly formed, private
Nicaraguan Institute of Public Opinion used accepted scientific
polling methods, employing students at Catholic University, which
he described as the nation's most politically neutral university.
The students interviewed 1,129 adults selected at random in five
types of Managua neighborhoods on June 4-5.
   Bollinger did not offer a margin of error for the poll but he
said at a news conference that several steps were taken to ensure
its integrity and objectivity.
   But he did note that many educated people who might have given
anti-Sandinista views have fled to the United States, with their
homes taken over by government officials and military officers. He
said about 27 percent of those polled worked for the government,
and they were the most supportive of the Sandinistas.
   Thirty-eight percent of the respondents believed the ruling
Sandinistas' management of the Nicaraguan economy has been either
bad or terrible, while 36 percent described it as fair, and only 22
percent said it was good or excellent.
   Seventy-four percent of those interviewed said they rated their
family's economic situation worse than a year ago, while only 7
percent said it was better.
   Forty-eight percent said they did not consider the Sandinista
government democratic while 40 percent said they did. But there was
general support for Sandinista peace efforts and the government's
foreign policies.
   A majority supported incorporation of the Contras into the
country's political life but most of those interviewed also said
they doubted the fighting would end soon.
   The overall results show the U.S. economic blockade of
Nicaragua, along with U.S. support for the Contra rebels, has
alienated even many anti-Sandinista Nicaraguans, Bollinger said.
   The Soviet Union received higher positive responses than the
United States among all income levels on several questions, with
higher-income groups being more pro-Soviet and pro-Sandinista than
poorer and less-educated Nicaraguans.
   Future polls _ the research group plans one of people in several
Latin American countries later this year _ will attempt to obtain
more detail about reaction to Soviet policies, said Bollinger.
   Only 1 percent of the respondents described U.S. Central
American policy as excellent, 7 percent called it good, 17 percent
said fair, 40 percent said bad and 28 percent called it terrible.
   Asked the same question about Soviet policy, 14 percent said it
was excellent, 43 percent good, 14 percent fair, 9 percent bad and
4 percent terrible.
   In evaluating Ortega's management of the government over the
last four years, 42 percent said it was good or excellent, 29
percent fair and 21 percent bad or terrible.
   Bollinger said this is a high rating in Latin American terms. He
said in a similar poll conducted in El Salvador, only 13 percent of
respondents gave President Jose Napoleon Duarte a good or excellent
rating.
   The poll showed that 28 percent of those interviewed claimed
affiliation with the ruling Sandinista party, 9 percent with
liberal or conservative opposition parties and 59 percent said they
belonged to no party.
   Bollinger said the Nicaraguan government did not interfere with
the survey even though laws apparently are still on the books
prohibiting independent polling in the country.

<HEAD>Iranian Silkworm Battery Could Pose New Threat, US Commander Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Construction of a permanent Silkworm battery
by Iran near the entrance to the Persian Gulf and the feared
addition of a more advanced anti-ship missile to the Iranian
arsenal may heighten risks to passing tankers, says the commander
of U.S. forces in the region.
   Gen. George B. Crist, the Marine four-star who heads the U.S.
Central Command, told reporters Thursday that completion of the
Iranian Silkworm battery at Kuhe-Stak and the possible addition of
another Chinese anti-ship missile, the CA-08, could make passage in
or out of the gulf more dangerous.
   But he said that since a daylong naval battle on April 18, in
which Iran lost two of its four frigates, Iranian forces have
steered clear of U.S. warships and aircraft.
   ``They have been very careful not to engage us,'' said Crist.
   A crack team of electronics experts, sent from the United States
to the gulf, determined several weeks after the clash that, despite
reports to the contrary, Iran had not fired a Silkworm missile at
U.S. forces during the fray, he said.
   The false reports were generated by computers hooked up to
radars aboard U.S. warships that mistook a U.S. SM-1 missile fired
at an Iranian target for a Silkworm, he said.
   For about two years, Iran has had Silkworm missiles at the port
of Bandar Abbas near the Strait of Hormuz, with the ability to set
them up at temporary sites to fire within a matter of hours, said
Crist.
   But the permanent earth and concrete bunker, ``with a 57-mile
range missile, will cover the entire Strait of Hormuz. It will
allow Iran to have the missile ready to be fired within five
minutes,'' he said.
   Work on the bunker, first reported in early 1987, was
continuing, Crist said in his first briefing with reporters since
the United States allowed Kuwaiti tankers to fly the Stars and
Stripes last summer and began escorting them through the gulf.
   Crist said he was pondering what weapons would be needed to
destroy the bunker, but meanwhile was stationing the cruise USS
Vincennes, equipped with advanced Aegis radar and air-defense
missiles, in position to protect any merchant ship passing throught
the straits.
   Crist said the cruiser would be ordered to fire against any
Silkworm launched, regardless of its intended target.
   ``The threat is not to our ships'' which have been equipped with
defenses against missiles like the Silkworm, ``but to unarmed
merchant ships,'' said Crist.
   ``We are not at war with Iran,'' said Crist. Therefore, before
he orders the site bunker destroyed, ``Iran will have to do
something to violate international law,'' said the general.
   Stationing an Aegis cruiser at the Strait of Hormuz may make the
decision to fire easier, because if a Silkworm is fired, ``I think
it will be a little hard to tell who the target is,'' and the U.S.
warship will try to destroy the attacking missile, he said.
   And under the rules of engagement in the Persian Gulf, U.S.
warships and aircraft are under orders to respond agressively to a
ship, plane or shore installation they believe is attacking them.
   ``If they fired a Silkworm at me, I would go get them,'' said
Crist.
   Crist said that despite repeated protests from the United
States, China was continuing to sell advanced arms to the Iranians.
He could not specify the exact arms, but said that a ship from
China or North Korea unloaded weaponry from those countries about
once every three months at Bandar Abbas.
   He said Iran is believed to have about 20 Silkworms in the
southern gulf, probably kept at Bandar Abbas, and more such
missiles in the northern gulf, and he fears that China has also
sold Iran CA-08 missiles.
   The CA-08 has a more sophisticated guidance system than the
Silkworm, which he described as ``primitive,'' but carries a
500-pound warhead compared to the 1,100-pound warhead on the
Silkworm.

One</HEAD>

   Republican leaders are looking to construct a
conservative platform that builds on the party's triumphs in 1980
and 1984, while carving out expanded new planks on such hot issues
as drugs, AIDS, education and child care.
   Republican party chairman Frank J. Fahrenkopf Jr. and other top
GOP officials pledged at a platform hearing here Thursday that they
will offer American voters a clear picture of what policies a Bush
administration will pursue _ in contrast to what they called the
deliberate vagueness of the Michael Dukakis-inspired Democratic
platform.
   Nebraska Gov. Kay Orr, the platform chairman, told reporters:
``Every indication to me is that we will have much the same
platform we had in 1984. ... We clearly have been successful with
the American electorate with that platform.''
   She added that it would reflect ``a conservative political
philosophy.''
   Sen. Robert W. Kasten Jr., R-Wis., co-chairman of the platform
committee, said the Republicans' 1984 vow not to raise taxes, at a
time when Walter Mondale was promising a tax increase, ``was the
basis on which we won 49 states.''
   Kasten called the Democrats' 2,000-word draft platform approved
in Denver last Saturday ``a bland compromise'' designed to
camouflage the true intentions of Dukakis and his party. But as the
election nears, Kasten said, ``the disguise will come off and
Michael Dukakis will be exposed for the narrow-minded, liberal wolf
in sheep's clothing that he really is.''
   Kasten told reporters that while the 1988 GOP platform draws
heavily from the 1984 platform on taxes, the economy and defense,
the Republicans must pay more attention this time to such issues as
drugs, AIDS, education and child care.
   ``The debate and the discussion and the dissension will probably
be on those new issues which we're going to rassle with in the
platform committee,'' said Kasten.
   Five members of what will ultimately be a 106-member GOP
platform committee presided at the day-long hearing on the economy
and jobs, along with Fahrenkopf and Maureen Reagan, co-chairman of
the Republican National Committee.
   Fahrenkopf challenged the Democrats to ``meet us on the
battlefield of ideas'' with a platform that spells out ``not only
what we want to accomplish, but how we intend to get there.'' He
said the party platforms take on even more importance this year,
the first presidential election in two decades without an incumbent
in the race.
   The GOP platform will actually be written in New Orleans
starting Aug. 8, the week before the convention.
   At Thursday's hearing, drugs were a main concern.
   The platform committee heard an assistant police chief of Los
Angeles, Robert Vernon, call for draconian measures against drugs
and drug-related crime, including denial of business and
professional licenses to those who test positive for drugs.
   ``We are approaching a civilization crisis _ a literal
civilization crisis,'' said Vernon, who called for a World War
II-like mobilization to fight drugs. ``It should be unpopular and
costly to abuse drugs in any form.''
   Fahrenkopf and Kasten said later they felt taking away business
licenses might be going too far. But the Wisconsin senator added
that the toughest part of the drug issue ``for us to decide is the
mandatory vs. voluntary parts.''
   Los Angeles County Sheriff Sherman Block said drug education
must start in fourth grade, because it is too late once kids ``have
had the taste of big money'' from drug dealing. He said drugs were
draining hundreds of millions of dollars from the American economy,
and he questioned why the U.S. keeps sending aid to countries where
the drugs come from.
   ``It's like handing a firearm to somebody who is threatening to
kill you,'' said Block. ``There's no country in the world today
who, short of a nuclear attack, could mount the kind of offensive
that would even come close to equalizing the level of death,
destruction and human misery that is being generated by substance
abuse in this country.''
   A black businessman, Barry Baszile, testified that drug dealers
are entrepreneurs, too, and might turn to legal businessed if
economic development funds were available in black communities.
   Two former rivals to George Bush, Sen. Bob Dole and Rep. Jack
Kemp, said that to keep the White House, the Republicans must
attract independent and cross-over Democratic voters.
   Kemp told reporters flatly that he does not expect to be picked
by Bush as a running mate, and predicted Dole would be.
   Dole, asked if he wanted the No. 2 job: ``I don't think it's a
question of wanting it. ... It's a question of winning the
election, helping your party and trying to help your country. I'd
want to be majority leader if I had my choice.''

   An estimated 10,200 Electric Boat employees
went on strike at the company's shipyard here Friday after contract
talks with the submarine builder broke down.
   ``We expect the strike to be strong and well-supported,'' said
Robert Manning, a lawyer for the Metal Trades Council.
   Electric Boat, a division of General Dynamics Corp., is one of
only two shipyards making nuclear submarines for the Navy, and the
only manufacturer of subs capable of carrying the giant Trident
ballistic missile.
   Talks broke down at 11:20 p.m. Thursday after a three-hour
last-ditch effort, and the walkout began after midnight.
   No new talks were planned.
   Earlier in the day, the Navy awarded this year's third and final
SSN-688 fast-attack submarine contract to Electric Boat. The $347.4
million contract will go to EB's main shipyard in here and its
other plant, in North Kingstown, R.I.
   The strike does not affect the Rhode Island plant.
   In a letter to employees, shipyard General Manager Fritz G.
Tovar said a strike will not stop submarine construction at the
shipyard here. EB arranged to assign 3,000 salaried employees to
shipyard jobs in the event of a strike.
   The two sides stalemated over the union's demand for percentage
wage increases and the shipyard's insistence that it could afford
no more than cash bonuses to remain competitive in its pursuit of
Navy contracts.
   Union members voted earlier Thursday 4,921 to 3,140 to reject
the company's latest offer but returned to the bargaining table
with 4{ hours to go before the strike deadline in a last-ditch
effort to reach a settlement.
   Talks began in November to replace a three-year contract that
expired Friday. The last strike at the shipyard was in 1975, when
the union walked out for five months and the region's economy
sagged.
   In Hartford, state Labor Commissioner Betty Tianti said she
would meet on Friday with members of the state's congressional
delegation and others to see what could be done to lessen the
economic impact of the strike.
   The union wanted straight hourly wage increases of 5 percent, 4
percent and 4 percent over three years.
   Electric Boat's ``last, best and final offer,'' presented
Monday, calls for bonuses totaling $4,250 over three years for a
first-class mechanic making $12.02 an hour, said Thomas Sotir, vice
president of human resources.
   The company cited increased competition from the only other
submarine shipyard in the country, the Newport News Shipbuilding
and Drydock Co. of Virginia.
   Newport News, which pays its workers 60 cents an hour less than
Electric Boat, recently won two contracts for nuclear attack
submarines after it underbid Electric Boat.
   ``If the Navy wants to get into the cheapest subs around, why
don't they get Yugos?'' said Wes Lamphere, 27, of Griswold,
president of the foundry workers local. ``We don't want to make a
million bucks, we're not asking for the world. We just want to keep
up.''

   A bevy of high-powered female celebrities,
including Barbra Streisand, Elizabeth Taylor and Lucille Ball, were
the first women elected to the Friar's Club to comply with a recent
U.S. Supreme Court ruling.
   The 84-year-old private club's board of governors changed its
constitution to allow female members and elected the women Thursday
to honorary membership.
   Other newcomers were Barbara Sinatra, Carol Burnett, Eydie
Gorme, Dinah Shore, Phyllis Diller and Martha Raye. Liza Minnelli,
who applied for regular membership, was approved, according to
Friar's spokesman Al Rylander.
   The club's decision to admit women followed a U.S. Supreme Court
ruling that upheld a New York City anti-discrimination law. The law
prohibits private clubs from banning women.
   The Friar's Club has more than 1,300 members in New York, most
of them active in the performing arts. Frank Sinatra is its top
officer, the abbot.

   Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu,
who has faced protesters at airports over the past month, says he
filed a complaint with police against a white fellow plane
passenger who harassed him.
   The Rev. Christopher Ahrends, an aide to the Nobel Peace Prize
winner, said the incident occurred while he and Tutu were riding in
an airport bus to their plane at Jan Smuts Airport in Johannesburg
on Thursday.
   ``The man was with a number of other men on the bus. He seemed
to be talking about the archbishop and the men were sniggering,''
Ahrends said.
   ``As we walked up the aircraft steps behind him, he turned
around, looked down at the archbishop and said in a mocking tone,
`Hallo Desmond,''' Ahrends said.
   The archbishop, who is black, ignored the man, who persisted,
using an obscenity in commenting on Tutu's speeches about South
Africa overseas, Ahrends said.
   Tutu reported the encounter to a steward and later asked the
abusive passenger his name as they disembarked, Ahrends said. The
man, who spoke in Afrikaans, replied, ``I'm going to break your
bloody neck,'' Ahrends said.
   The aide called a police officer and a complaint was made at the
airport charge office.
   ``We will not tolerate threatening and abusive behavior towards
the archbishop, who was clearly hurt by the incident,'' Ahrends
said.

   John Zaccaro Jr., convicted of selling a
quarter-gram of cocaine to an undercover officer, has won
preliminary approval to serve his four-month sentence beginning
today under house arrest.
   The son of former vice presidential candidate Geraldine Ferraro
was to begin the sentence by 5 p.m., with his first 24 hours in
maximum security at Chittenden Community Correctional Center in
South Burlington, standard procedure for new inmates, said Addison
County State's Attorney John Quinn.
   Zaccaro, 24, was sentenced two weeks ago, but the sentence was
stayed 30 days pending appeal to the Vermont Supreme Court. If an
appeal had been granted, it may have been a year or more before the
court decided the case.
   But Zaccaro's lawyers dropped the request for the stay and asked
that Zaccaro start serving his sentence today. Judge Francis
McCaffrey agreed, deputy court clerk Kathy Moore said Thursday.
   Corrections Department spokesman John Perry said Zaccaro had
gained preliminary approval for a new state program under which he
would live in a department-approved apartment and could leave only
with permission.
   Under the program, Zaccaro could begin the 300 hours of
community service his sentence entails. The judge fined Zaccaro
$1,500 as well.

   A man accused of impersonating Grande Ole
Opry singer Jack Greene to buy a $700,000 horse farm and $350,000
worth of equipment has been arrested on forgery charges, police
said.
   Lawrence Irving Taylor was being held in the Fayette County
Detention Center on $3,000 cash bond pending grand jury action.
   Taylor, 55, was arrested June 17 at Blue Grass Airport, a week
after police said he signed a contract, under the name of Jack
Greene, to purchase the farm in Clark County.
   Taylor had been using his name for the past seven years, Greene
said Wednesday.
   Dee Teater, a real estate agent, said she became suspicious
after ``Greene'' agreed to buy the farm, ordered farm equipment and
promised to have the money wired into an escrow account.
   It never arrived, and Ms. Teater said she telephoned Nashville
and was told the real Greene wasn't in Lexington but was performing
at the Grand Ole Opry.
   Ms. Teater said she then went to the airport to meet Taylor, who
was arrested by detectives who accompanied her.

<HEAD>Study Shows Legal Testimony of Psychology Experts Often Wrong</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Courts trying to determine if defendants will
commit violent crimes in the future would do just as well to flip a
coin as to listen to the ``expert'' testimony of psychiatrists and
psychologists, a study published today indicates.
   The inaccuracy of judgments by trained clinicians raises
``substantial doubt that psychologists or psychiatrists meet legal
standards for expertise,'' says the report published in the journal
Science.
   The study was conducted by David Faust, an associate professor
of psychology at Brown University, and Jay Ziskin, a California
lawyer and psychologist.
   They found that laymen without degrees or clinical experience
often can make courtroom evaluations of violent defendants as
accurately as psychologists and psychiatrists.
   And making decisions by just the flip of a coin, Faust said,
often is more accurate than the judgments of the experts.
   Life or death decisions by juries may be influenced by
psychological experts who are called to testify in criminal trials
on the mental state of defendants, or their potential for violence.
   In many states, the punishment phase of capital murder trials
takes into consideration a prediction of the continued violent
behavior of the defendant. Prosecutors and defense lawyers
frequently call on psychologists or psychiatrists for opinions.
   But Faust, in a telephone interview Thursday, said the accuracy
of the these opinions is questionable.
   ``In many studies the error rate well exceeds the accuracy
rate,'' Faust said. ``There is virtually no evidence that experts
are any better equipped to make those judgments than are lay
individuals.''
   He said some studies have shown that experts are accurate in
their predictions less than half the time.
   ``If you flip a coin, you ought to be right 50 percent of the
time,'' said Faust. ``So there are studies showing accuracies of
less than chance.''
   Education, he said, often has little to do with predicting
violent behavior.
   ``One study using high school students showed that their
accuracy was similar to that of experts in predicting violent
behavior,'' Faust said.
   In the Science article, Faust and Ziskin cited a series of
studies that they said showed ``clinicians are wrong at least twice
as often as they are correct'' in predicting violent behavior.
   They said one study followed 967 patients who had been placed in
maximum security hospitals on the basis of a psychiatric
determination of dangerousness. They later were transferred to
ordinary mental hospitals. After four years, only half of the group
was still in the hospitals and only 26 patients who had been judged
potentially violent had actually committed violent acts during that
time.
   In the article, the authors said they conducted their research
to learn if expert psychological witnesses achieve ``reasonable
certainty'' of facts and aid in establishing the truth in trials.
   ``The scientific evidence clearly suggests that clinicians fail
to satisfy either legal standard for expertise,'' they said.
   Psychological clinicians often are unable to agree on diagnoses,
``much less provide trustworthy answers to ... more difficult
forensic questions, which often demand projections backward and
forward in time,'' the article said.
   Expert testimony often can have what the article called ``a
prejudicial effect on juries.''
   ``Confidence and accuracy can be inversely related, and yet the
jury may well accept the opinion of an expert who exudes confidence
over that of an opposing expert who expresses appropriate
caution,'' the authors said.
   Evidence from experts, they said, ``is readily subject to
abuse'' due to subjectivity and bias.
   ``The involvement of experts wastes many hours of already too
scarce court time and costs taxpayers millions of dollars,'' the
article says.
   When an expert testifies that a psychologist or psychiatrist can
predict violent behavior ``he endorses a falsehood'' and could
create the risk for malpractice suits against colleagues, the
researchers said.
   Faust, in the interview, said he has testified as an expert in
trials in the past, but now refuses to do so because of his belief
that his science, at its present state of development, is unable to
achieve the expected level of accuracy.
   Other experts said the question of reliability of psychological
testimony has been a matter of controversy, but that it is not
clear that such expertise is as unreliable as Faust and Ziskin
contend.
   ``I don't know of an opinion like that that is generally
accepted in the scientific community,'' said James C. Miller, a
professor of psychology at George Washington University. ``That is
a controversial position.''
   Dr. Jon O'Brien, a forensic psychiatry expert at Georgetown
University, said, ``no professional could give a guarantee that an
individual will or will not act violently.''
   But he said trials can still benefit from the testimony of
experts.

<HEAD>Commuter Planes to Have `Black Box' Recorders</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Within three years all but the very smallest
commuter aircraft must be equipped with so-called ``black box''
recorders under a new regulation from the Federal Aviation
Administration.
   Large jetliners already are required to have the recorders which
provide information about an aircraft's performance and provide a
30-minute loop tape of conversation in the cockpit.
   The devices have been critical in finding the cause of many
airliner crashes over the years. The National Transportation Safety
Board recently cited several commuter accidents in which
investigations were hampered because adequate information was not
available.
   But commuter planes of less than 30 seats are not required to
have the devices.
   Under a final FAA rule announced Thursday, multi-engine, turbine
powered commuter planes carrying more than six passengers and flown
by two pilots will be required to have cockpit voice recorders.
   Slightly larger commuter planes carrying 20 or more passengers
will have to be equipped with digital flight data recorders that
store such information as air speed, altitude, aircraft pitch and
heading.
   Commuter airlines must have the black box recorders within three
years of the effective date of the rule, which is expected to be in
90 days.
   The cockpit voice recorders must be included in new aircraft and
retrofitted into planes already in service. The flight data
recorders must be in both new and in-service aircraft with 20 or
more seats. There is no retrofit requirement for flight data
recorders in the smaller commuter planes of less than 20 seats.
   ``Although the FDR and CVR do not enhance safety by themselves
they have proven to be invaluable accident investigation tools and
have led to numerous improvements in aviation safety,'' said FAA
Administrator Allan McArtor.
   Last year Congress directed the FAA to expand its requirements
for the ``black box'' recorders to include commuter airlines, which
last year carried about 32 million passengers.

<HEAD>Angolan Rebel Leader Says He's Finally Getting Support From U.S.
Blacks</HEAD>

   Angolan rebel leader Jonas Savimbi says he has
been trying to get his message across to American blacks for seven
years and is finally making headway, even though his movement is
supported by South Africa.
   ``I can assure you here that we have made a very modest, small,
but firm start in talking to the black leaders,'' Savimbi said at
the National Press Club on Thursday.
   Before visiting Washington this week Savimbi went to Alabama and
Mississippi to seek support at black churches and from civil rights
leaders.
   He met with some success and appeared at the White House for a
meeting with President Reagan on Thursday accompanied by the Rev.
Ralph David Abernathy of the Southern Christian Leadership
Conference and a handful of other blacks.
   ``We have to do all that we can to see to Dr. Savimbi having the
support that is necessary,'' Abernathy said. ``I'm sure that he
needs our blessing and support and because of his location he is
facing many problems.''
   Savimbi has been treated as a pariah by American civil rights
leaders because his UNITA forces receive aid from South Africa in
their struggle against the Soviet-backed Angolan government.
   Opposition to him here has by no means disappeared. About 40
protesters shouting anti-Savimbi slogans demonstrated against him
in Fayette, Miss., last Saturday, and he said he encountered other
protests in the South.
   About 25 people demonstrated outside the National Press Building
during his appearance, and a man interrupted his speech from the
open door of the dining room to shout three times, ``Savimbi is a
murderer.''
   Savimbi says he first sought a meeting with the Congressional
Black Caucus in 1981 and again when he was here in 1986. He said
Thursday that he is still hoping for a meeting with the black
members of Congress this time.
   He said he wanted ``to explain the problems of UNITA in order
for the people to know, to listen and to judge. I think those are
the fundamentals of democracy.''
   Savimbi told the conservative Heritage Foundation that he saw
his first member of the caucus, Rep. Louis Stokes, D-Ohio, this
trip when Stokes chaired his meeting with the House Intelligence
Committee. He said Stokes treated him politely.
   The committee oversees U.S. aid to UNITA.
   To the criticism of his links with South Africa, Savimbi says he
opposes apartheid, but will take support from anyone willing to
give it. He says he is a Democrat who only wants freedom and
independence for his country.
   When he fought against Portuguese colonial rule of his African
homeland in the 1960s and 1970s, U.S. aid was unavailable to him
because the United States was allied with Portugal.
   So he turned to the Soviet Union, which rejected him, and then
to China, which gave him guerrilla training.
   UNITA lost to the Soviet-backed MPLA after the Portuguese left
Angola in 1975, so he retreated to the bush and sought support from
the only source available, South Africa.
   Congressional sources, who asked not to be identified, say he is
receiving an estimated $200 million to $300 million in direct South
African aid this year, plus the support of the South African
military in Angola and neighboring South-West Africa, or Namibia.
   U.S. conservatives favor his movement because of its opposition
to the Soviets. Conservatives succeeded in winning congressional
repeal of a law banning aid to UNITA and in 1986 Reagan announced
$15 million in military aid.
   While the details are classified, the aid continues and is
estimated to have climbed to between $30 million and $40 million
this year, including Stinger anti-aircraft missiles that Savimbi
credits with stopping air strikes against his headquarters.

<HEAD>Aspin Less Firm On Demand For Contract Freeze</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rep. Les Aspin says he and Defense Secretary
Frank C. Carlucci ``are on the same wavelength'' although the
Defense Department sharply criticized Aspin's call for a freeze in
new contracts to companies mentioned in the Pentagon bribery
investigation.
   The Wisconson Democrat, chairman of the House Armed Services
Committee, said he and Carlucci spoke on the telephone late
Thursday, shortly after a Pentagon spokesman had sharply criticized
Aspin's proposal.
   ``I called him up and when he talked, we discovered that we're
on the same wavelength here,'' Aspin said. ``I don't think we're
that far apart in what we're thinking. My goal is to make sure the
contracts that are being let now, not the ones involved in the
investigation, are free of any taint. That's his goal, too.''
   Aspin had called Wednesday for a delay of six to eight weeks in
awarding contracts to firms mentioned in the 2-year-old
investigation of fraud and bribery in Pentagon weapons-buying. No
charges have yet been filed.
   But Aspin, in an interview with the Associated Press, said he's
not wedded to the six-to-eight-week time frame. ``That's just an
idea I threw out,'' he said.
   Aspin said he plans to write Carlucci a letter outlining Aspin's
proposals. ``I need to get these ideas down on paper and then he
said he'd respond.''
   But, said Aspin: ``Carlucci and I have the same goals. He said
he's got people working to come up with a way to make sure the
current contracts aren't tainted.''
   Aspin and other committee members attended a closed-door
briefing Thursday by the Naval Investigative Service about the
case. Two legislators said later they expect numerous indictments.
   Rep. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., said officials ``are very, very
sure of their case...It's pretty ironclad.''
   Rep. Larry Hopkins, R-Ky., said, ``many, many indictments will
be forthcoming.... I don't think it will be too long before the
first of them will be coming down.''
   Rear Adm. Ted Gordon, director of the NIS, detailed the case for
the legislators. He outlined a ``series of interlocking rings of
people, kind of like the Olympic flag,'' in which several groups
operated independently, according to one source, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   Earlier, the Pentagon had rejected Aspin's call for a halt. A
freeze could raise weapon costs, force plant layoffs and hurt
military readiness, said spokesman Fred S. Hoffman.
   ``We would be glad to discuss with the Congress the question of
freezing awards of new contracts while the Justice Department is
investigating allegations of procurement fraud,'' Hoffman said.
``But at this point we feel it would be imprudent to apply such a
freeze or moratorium.''
   The investigation has also spawned its first two pieces of
reform legislation.
   One would overhaul and centralize the purchasing system while
the second would try to end to the so-called ``revolving door''
between the private sector and government.
   The first measure would create a single buying office, known as
the Defense Acquisition Agency, to replace the current mix of
purchasing agencies scattered throughout the Defense Department.
   The second would require Pentagon officials to wait two years
after they quit before working for a defense contractor.

<HEAD>House Judiciary Committee Approves Handgun Waiting Period</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES HANNAH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Rifle Association says it will
try to pluck a handgun waiting-period provision out of an anti-drug
bill when the measure comes up for a vote in the House.
   ``We'll work to break it out of the drug bill on the floor and
get an up-or-down vote on that issue only,'' said James Baker, the
NRA's chief lobbyist.
   On Thursday, the House Judiciary Committee tucked an amendment
into the drug bill that would require prospective purchasers of
handguns to wait seven days before taking possession, to allow for
background checks.
   ``We will be incapable of making substantial headway in our war
against drug trafficking unless we are also prepared to disarm drug
dealers and drug traffickers and drug users,'' said Rep. Edward
Feighan, D-Ohio, who offered the waiting-period amendment.
   The proposal withstood a challenge from Rep. Bill McCollum,
R-Fla., who attempted to substitute an amendment requiring that a
system be developed to identify felons who attempt to buy firearms.
The McCollum substitute was defeated 22-12, and the waiting period
was then approved by a voice vote.
   Feighan noted that Republicans on the committee did not ask for
a recorded vote, and said that is an indication that most members
do not want to be publicly reported as opposing ``such a sensible
gun-control measure.''
   ``The NRA is losing credibility in this institution and
nationally because they have opposed the most reasonable efforts at
gun control,'' said Feighan. ``Their insanity doesn't end.''
   The NRA contends that waiting periods don't work.
   ``We think that law-abiding citizens will be the only ones
affected and criminals will continue to evade the law,'' Baker said.
   During the waiting period, law enforcement agencies could try to
determine whether a prospective buyer has a criminal record or a
record of mental incompetency.
   The measure would exempt those who present dealers with
certificates from police stating that the purchasers' lives have
been threatened.
   Twenty-two states have some form of waiting periods, with
California having the longest at 15 days. The amendment would
supersede less stringent state waiting-period laws, but leave
stronger laws standing.

<HEAD>Britains in Tussle Over Proposed U.S. Garbage Shipments</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Government leaders are fretting over a plan to
import millions of tons of U.S. household trash to a dump in
northwest England.
   One lawmaker said in Thursday's debate in Parliament that the
United States should look into disposing its waste in its own
deserts rather than in Britain. Legislator Chris Taylor said he
feared creating the 130-foot-high dump on 390 acres in his home
constituency of Warrington could introduce U.S. crop diseases into
the area.
   ``Who would pick up the bill if the Colorado beetle infected the
Cheshire potato crop?,'' he asked.
   Americans should find a place ``in their deserts, perhaps, to
deal with their own garbage, rather than add to our own
environmental problems,'' said Taylor of Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher's governing Conservative Party.
   The garbage is to be shipped from the East Coast of the United
States at the rate of 1.5 million to 2 million tons a year for five
years by a British company, Power Water and Waste, according to
Environment Undersecretary Colin Moynihan.
   Several African nations have recently expressed outrage over
dumping of waste from Western countries, including the United
States, within their borders.
   In one case, the government of Guinea in West Africa said it
found 15,000 tons of toxic ash shipped from Philadelphia and dumped
on an island off its coast by a Norwegian company.
   Nigeria recently announced it was posting vigilantes around its
coast to block such dumping by foreign countries.
   Moynihan defended disposing of foreign waste in Britain as a
``legitimate trade.''
   But he said this particular plan ``gives grave cause for
concern.'' He said the waste ``is undoubtedly different in kind and
scale from the imports we have received so far.''
   He said U.S. household garbage contains garden and food waste,
so imports ``must involve the risk of pests and diseases being
carried with it,'' he said.
   The Cheshire County Council approved the plan, and Moynihan said
he would be holding talks later with that body.

   From 400 to 500 people may die in traffic
accidents during the Independence Day holiday weekend, according to
the National Safety Council.
   The council also estimated Thursday that an additional 19,000 to
24,000 people may suffer disabling injuries from traffic accidents.
   During last year's July 4th holiday weekend, 390 people were
killed.
   Safety Council statisticians said 400 deaths might be expected
during a three-day, non-holiday weekend at this time of the year.
   This year's three-day holiday weekend begins at 6 p.m. today and
ends midnight local time Monday.

<TEXT>
   A union representing 12,000 state
clerical workers and counselors went on strike at midnight
Thursday, its president said.
   Paul Krissel, president of the Pennsylvania Social Services
Union, said 56 percent of Pennsylvania's second-largest state
employees union voted to reject a three-year contract offer.
   Krissel said the strike would affect statewide operations in
welfare and unemployment offices, some bureaus under the Department
of Labor and Industry, and some counseling services in prisons and
mental institutions.
   He said the strike would become evident when offices opened in
the morning and picket lines went up outside. The bulk of the
membership is in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh and surrounding areas,
the union president said.
   John Taylor, a spokesman for Gov. Robert Casey, said supervisors
and non-striking employees will keep offices open.
   ``We're prepared to do whatever we have to do to maintain
services,'' the governor said at an afternoon briefing.
   PSSU struck for two days in 1985 and three weeks in 1975.
   At issue is the state's effort to institute a two-tier wage
scale and vacation package that the union said discriminates
against new employees and those at the lower end of the scale,
Krissel said.
   ``We seek a fair across-the-board wage increase for all workers,
as well as some added financial recognition for loyal, longer-term
employees,'' he said.
   Although 25 percent of the employees represented by the union
are not members, Krissel said he expected they would honor picket
lines. Union members in supervisory positions, about 2,000 people,
are barred from striking, he added.
   The state's largest union, the American Federation of State,
County and Municipal Employees, ratified a three-year contract with
the state last week.

   FBI affidavits unsealed in the Pentagon
bribery investigation list nine government contracts on which
agents allege that consultant Mark C. Saunders had insider
information.
   The affidavits, unsealed Thursday in Dallas, allege that
Saunders got most of his information from Navy procurement official
George Stone and passed it to another consultant, Thomas Muldoon.
   Here is a listing of each contract and some of the information
allegedly passed by Saunders:
   _From September 1987 through April 1988, Saunders got from Stone
a steady stream of information, including sealed bids of 10
competing companies, about a $120 million Marine Corps-Navy
contract for an Advanced Tactical Air Command Control system.
   _Saunders got advance word in December 1987 from Stone about a
$32 million contract for secure Navy radio equipment.
   _Stone called Saunders at home in January 1988 to give him the
names of the finalists, which he called the ``inside skinny,'' on a
$10 million Navy contract for a Tactical Environmental Support
System. Saunders told Muldoon that this data was hard to get and
now ``we can't even make any money on it.''
   _In November 1987, Saunders provided Muldoon with a draft of the
government's plan for acquiring a $50 million Fiber Optics Cable
System.
   _In August 1987, Saunders told Muldoon the company he was
working for rated poorly on the technical aspects of its bid for a
more than $100 million Digital Wide-Band Transmission System
contract.
   _In August 1987, Saunders told Muldoon about an internal Navy
split over how to handle a $10 million contract for a prototype of
a sonar system.
   _In July 1987, Saunders told Muldoon that a $100 million
Anti-Submarine Warfare Operation Center contract might have to be
restructured and rebid.
   _In November 1987, Stone told Saunders of a decision that day
about a $100 million Digital Communications Terminal contract.
   _The ninth contract was to be for radios, at an undisclosed
price. In this case, the FBI said, Saunders had been awarded a
$9,000 government subcontract to develop the government's plan for
buying the radios. The FBI said Saunders worked with Joe Bradley,
marketing vice president in Dallas for Varian Continental
Electronics, to rig his work so that Varian could win the radio
contract.
   The FBI said that in a series of conversations from September to
December of 1987, Bradley and Saunders discussed how to write the
acquisition plan ``to make it difficult for other companies to
compete with Varian.''

   Thanks to Astrid's Law, dogs' tails in
Sweden are safe from cosmetic trimming and barnyard animals are
guaranteed a better life, at least until they get to the
slaughterhouse.
   The law, which took effect July 1, was the result of a campaign
by children's author Astrid Lindgren, creator of Pippi Longstocking
and a host of other characters who have enchanted children in
dozens of countries.
   It was a remarkable achievement, even for a woman who once
helped bring down a government. It reflected the reverence with
which Swedes regard a storyteller who has spellbound three
generations.
   The law was Mrs. Lindgren's birthday present from the
government. When she turned 80 last November, Prime Minister Ingvar
Carlsson visited her Stockholm apartment to tell her the the Animal
Protection Law was being drafted and would be informally but
affectionately called ``Lex Astrid.''
   ``We are going to take much more consideration of the animals'
health and well being,'' he told her.
   Mrs. Lindgren, a farmer's daughter, long had agitated against
cruelty to animals, but the campaign gained momentum last year when
she wrote in an open letter to Carlsson: ``every pig is entitled to
a happy pig life.''
   She complained that calves often were locked in barns and
slaughtered ``without ever seeing a summer pasture.'' She asked
Carlsson ``to make life a little bit easier for many unhappy
animals in our country.''
   The wide-ranging law guarantees cattle the right to graze, and
cows and pigs the right to stalls with straw and bedding. It says
chickens should be freed from their coops within 10 years, and
animals should be protected from undue suffering before slaughter.
   It also outlaws the drugging of horses in racing and riding
competions and says animals may not be beaten repeatedly with a
stick or whip beyond ``a light strike.'' Riding schools and fur
farms must be licensed.
   It made Sweden the second country after Norway to ban the
cropping of dogs' tails for cosmetic reasons.
   It was not the first time Mrs. Lindgren ventured from her
fantasy world to shake up the politicians.
   In 1976 she wrote a satirical fairy tale widely publicized in
the daily press dramatizing her complaint against the system of
taxation that finances the generous social benefits of the Swedish
welfare state.
   Mrs. Lindgren calculated that she paid more than 100 percent in
taxes on her income, because of a quirky combination of local tax,
income tax and social tax for the self-employed.
   Her indignation at having to pay to write profitable books
contributed to a growing fatigue among the voters with the Social
Democratic Party, which had governed Sweden for 44 unbroken years.
   Right-wing opposition parties had decried the tax system as
unfair for years, but Mrs. Lindgren's lament had a far wider impact
in the 1976 election. The Social Democrats were ousted, returning
to power in 1982.
   Mrs. Lindgren has political punch because she is a non-political
national symbol whose books are universally embraced. They are as
much a part of growing up in Sweden as dancing around the maypole
in summer and eating herring at Christmas.
   Many of her 70 books have been translated into 60 languages and
have been the source of 29 films or television series. She has won
35 Swedish or international awards since publishing her first book
in 1944.
   Her stories were often set in rural Sweden, where children
romped through green forests in summer, skated on frozen lakes in
winter and went fishing in the autumn.
   Her most popular character is Pippi Longstocking, a rebellious
girl with red pigtails, a chest full of money and incredible
strength.
   Pippi mocks society's venerated institutions, such as charitable
old ladies, and doesn't go to school. The book was an instant hit
when it was published in 1945.
   Her books betray her early interest in animals: Pippi has a
horse who lives on the veranda and a monkey named Nilsson who
sleeps in the house. Emil, an endearing rascal from another popular
series, also has a horse and a pet pig.
   Mrs. Lindgren recently collaborated on an American production of
a Pippi Longstocking film and is working on a new book.

   Slum dwellers tied a man accused of burglary
to a 40-foot wooden cross, whipped him and tried to burn him alive,
but police rescued him, a newspaper said.
   Residents of Hauscar, a shantytown outside Lima, bound
20-year-old Jorge Arce to a stake which they dubbed the ``cross of
justice,'' the government newspaper La Cronica said Thursday.
   The vigilantes held him there for six hours, beating and
whipping him. They also doused him with cold water and shaved part
of his head.
   Police saved the victim as residents placed kindling at his
feet, and he was not seriously hurt, the report said. Authorities
refused comment, and it was unknown if he had been charged with any
crimes.
   Arce had been caught robbing a home early Wednesday, the report
said.
   Local residents formed vigilante groups in their crime-plagued
area after police cut patrols, according to Jorge Salvador,
spokesman for the Hauscar Neighborhood Association.

<HEAD>Court-Martial Conviction of Army Colonel Overturned</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Military prosecutors took too long to bring
Army Col. James E. Longhofer to trial, the U.S. Army Court of
Military Review ruled in overturning his 1986 court-martial
conviction, a published report says.
   Longhofer, 50, who headed the Special Operations Division in
1981 and 1982, was convicted in April 1986 of disobeying a lawful
order, dereliction of duty and conduct unbecoming an officer.
   The military appeals court ruled Thursday that the delay in
bringing Longhofer to trial violated the ``speedy trial''
requirement of military law, The Washington Post reported in
today's editions.
   The trial was not begun within 120 days after Longhofer was
charged, the court ruled, blaming the delay on Army prosecutors'
``inexplicable'' unfamiliarity with procedures for obtaining
security clearances for Longhofer's civilian attorney.
   ``Thank God for the Constitution and my lawyers,'' Longhofer
told the Post after the ruling. ``I'm going to ask that I be
restored to what I would have been had they not violated my
constitutional rights.''
   Longhofer spent 63 days in prison at Fort Leavenworth, Kan.,
before being released pending appeal. He originally had been
sentenced to two years in prison, a reprimand and $24,000 in pay
forfeiture, but his commanding officer later cut the penalties in
half.
   Allegations of financial illegalities by members of his unit
prompted Longhofer's suspension in December 1983.

<TEXT>
   A September 1986 tip that a private consultant
was peddling secret bid information on a Marine Corps contract
triggered the Pentagon bribery probe that now encompasses scores of
companies, consultants and officials, FBI documents show.
   Affidavits unsealed Thursday in Dallas say the FBI and the Naval
Investigative Service were told that a consultant had approached an
employee of a company that had bid on the Marine contract, offering
to provide competitors' costs and bid data and government bid
evaluations.
   With the employee's consent, agents recorded his conversations
with the consultant, who subsequently was confronted and agreed to
cooperate in recording conversations with other individuals.
   This group of recordings revealed, the FBI said, that defense
consultant William Parkin, a retired Navy missile buyer, ``served
as a middleman who paid government employees for inside information
and sold it to contractors.'' In January 1987, a court ordered
tapping of Parkin's office and home telephones.
   By April 1987, the FBI said, those wiretaps led agents to tap
the telephones and bug the offices of consultant William Galvin.
   By June 1987, taps and bugs were authorized for the office
telephones and office of consultant Melvyn Paisley, who had
resigned three months earlier as assistant Navy secretary for
research, engineering and systems.
   One month later, the FBI said it began tapping consultant Thomas
Muldoon's telephones in Washington. The FBI got a court order to
tap consultant Mark Saunders' telephones in Virginia in September
1987.
   The FBI later tapped or bugged consultant Donald Illeman in
Southern California. Illeman, who had not been previously
identified with the case, did not immediately return a telephone
message.
   Later taps or bugs were placed on consultants Fred Lackner,
Charles Gardner and Jim Rapinac.

<TEXT>
   An 18-year study that revealed the atomic
structure of Earth's most abundant protein could lead to higher
crop yields, better drugs to combat cancer and heart disease, and
even to more effective laundry detergents, scientists say.
   The study by biochemist David Eisenberg of the University of
California, Los Angeles, ``is very significant work,'' said Dr.
John Norvell, health science administrator at the National
Institute of General Medical Sciences in Bethesda, Md.
   ``It will add a lot to the understanding of how these complex
proteins work,'' and therefore may help researchers trying to
design proteins to combat several diseases, including diabetes and
cancer, Norvell said.
   Eisenberg and his students published their study today in the
journal Science. They spent 18 years bombarding crystals of the
protein, named RuBisCO, with X-rays before they successfully
produced computer images showing the three-dimensional arrangement
of the 37,792 atoms in the protein, which ultimately sustains life
by making every plant grow.
   ``Learning the structure of this protein will aid researchers
who are hoping to increase crop yields'' by altering the protein so
it makes plants grow more quickly, said Eisenberg, a physical
chemistry and molecular biology professor at UCLA.
   RuBisCO stands for ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate
carboxylase-oxygenase, a protein present in all green plants. It
transforms carbon dioxide into sugar to start photosynthesis, the
sunlight-aided process that makes plants grow.
   ``This protein is vital to all life,'' said retired UCLA plant
physiologist Sam Wildman, who discovered RuBisCO in 1947. ``We all
depend on photosynthesis (for food). This protein performs a key
function in photosynthesis. By knowing the structure, clever people
like Eisenberg can plot how to modify the structure so the plant
would make more matter, which is what we eat.''
   The study also is another step in helping scientists learn the
rules by which amino acids, the building blocks of life, form
complex proteins.
   Such knowledge eventually may help researchers design proteins
to kill cancers, destroy blood clots that cause heart attacks,
degrade toxic wastes and even make better laundry detergents,
Norvell, Eisenberg and Washington State University biochemist Bruce
McFadden said in telephone interviews.
   Plants on Earth produce 1.1 tons of RuBisCO each second, or 35
million tons per year, Eisenberg said. RuBisCO, which is 10,000
times smaller than the width of a human hair, constitutes half the
soluble protein in all plants, making it the most abundant protein
on Earth, he added.
   McFadden has already altered RuBisCO's structure to make
photosynthetic bacteria double their uptake of carbon dioxide. If
he can do the same thing in plants _ an effort that should be aided
by Eisenberg's study _ ``we hypothesize we will obtain
faster-growing plants. It could be in the offing in the next five
years,'' McFadden said from Pullman, Wash.
   Eisenberg and Fred Hartman, acting director of biology at Oak
Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee, said 10 years was more
likely.
   Success would create crops with ``twice the yield from the same
amount of acreage,'' Hartman said.
   Knowledge gained from the structure of RuBisCO and other big
proteins might help scientists design proteins that could be
injected to degrade nutrients and growth factors that promote
cancer, Hartman said.
   Eisenberg coined the name RuBisCO as a play on the brand name
Nabisco because Wildman once hoped to sell the protein as a cheap
food source and Eisenberg suggested it could be sold in cracker
form.
   The study took 18 years because Eisenberg had to have perfect
crystals of the protein, which is extracted from tobacco leaves,
get X-rays to hit the crystals properly and improve the computer's
ability to measure brightness of 40,000 points of scattered X-rays
and assemble them into a picture.

<HEAD>AMA Approves AIDS Policies</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: LEADS with 8 grafs to UPDATE with approval of policy to
violate confidentiality in some cases with AIDS patients. Picks up
5th graf, `Dr. Don...'</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM C. HIDLAY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The American Medical Association on Thursday
called on the states to trace the sexual partners of people
infected with the AIDS virus and urged prisons to test inmates for
exposure to the deadly disease.
   In addition, the AMA urged doctors, as a last resort, to breach
confidentiality rules and warn sexual partners of AIDS patients.
   The AMA approved the measures by voice vote along with a package
of other AIDS proposals before adjourning its annual policy-making
convention.
   ``I think that contact tracing (of sexual partners), at least in
the heterosexual community, has the potential to substantially
reduce the proliferation and spread of AIDS,'' said Dr. James
Sammons, executive vice president of the 295,000-member AMA.
   The AMA's 420-member House of Delegates also approved policies
aimed at prohibiting athletes from using steroids, posting health
warnings on tanning booths, urging airlines to ban smoking on all
domestic flights and evaluating whether health warnings should be
required on alcoholic beverages.
   The delegates passed an amendment that says doctors, as a last
resort, have an obligation to depart from their Hippocratic vow of
confidentiality to warn sexual partners of persons infected with
the AIDS virus.
   The policy says that doctors should try to persuade patients who
are infected with the virus to inform their sexual partners. If the
infected person refuses, the doctor should report the person to the
local public health department so the officials can warn the sexual
partners, under the policy.
   ``And if that fails, the doctor should tell the people who are
at risk directly,'' said Dr. M. Roy Schwarz, chairman of the AMA's
AIDS Task Force and the association's assistant executive vice
president for medical education and science.
   Dr. Don Chaplin, a delegate from Burlington, N.C., warned that
doctors must emphasize the need to protect the identities of AIDS
victims.
   ``I caution us to be very careful to do anything we can to
protect confidentiality and to fight any discrimination because it
would thwart our efforts to bring this disease under control,''
Chaplin said.
   The doctors' organization renewed its call for mandatory
AIDS-virus testing of all inmates because of the problems of
intravenous drug use and homosexuality in prisons, practices that
spread the disease.
   The AMA adopted a similar prison-testing proposal last year and
reapproved it Thursday despite objections from several doctors that
it would accomplish little.
   The doctors approved what Chaplin said would be ``broad
expansions on contact tracing'' of sexual partners to slow the
spread of AIDS among heterosexuals.
   Sammons said contact tracing had been effective in reducing such
other sexually transmitted diseases as syphilis and gonorrhea.
   The delegates also called on federal and state governments to
expand treatment programs for intravenous drug abusers because they
pose the most explosive potential for spreading AIDS into the
heterosexual population.
   By 1991, the nation likely will have 270,000 cases of acquired
immune deficiency syndrome, said an AMA progress report issued
during the convention. There is no known cure for the disease.
   Some of the other AIDS policies approved by the AMA call for
vigorous enforcement of existing anti-discrimination laws to
protect AIDS victims against bias in employment, housing and other
areas; and urge women to avoid breast feeding if they are infected
with the AIDS virus to reduce the chance of giving the disease to
their children.
   Another measure calls for the U.S. president to keep public
attention focused on the epidemic by creating a new national AIDS
commission, identical to the one that just finished its work.
   Such a panel would be a clearinghouse for AIDS research and
``provide the essential coordination between public and private
institutions that are addressing AIDS,'' the AMA said.
   In other action:
   _The rapid growth of the commercial tanning industry _ with an
estimated 17,500 parlors nationwide _ prompted the AMA to declare
that tanning booths ``pose potentially significant health risks.''
   Delegates voted to lobby the federal government to require
warnings in tanning parlors about the increased risks of skin
cancer caused by prolonged exposure to ultraviolet light in tanning
booths.

   A Soviet journalist said four delegates to a
nationwide Communist Party conference were suspected of
bribe-taking. Tass said the charge was made after a passionate
debate on the power of the press to criticize leaders.
   Vitaly Korotich, of the weekly magazine Ogonyok, gave a list of
the delegates to Mikhail S. Gorbachev at Thursday's session of the
party gathering, but he did not publically identify them, the
official news agency said. He demanded an investigation of the
allegations.
   The edition of Ogonyok published Sunday said delegates from the
Central Asian republic of Uzbekistan had taken bribes. It said
acceptance of bribes by delegates to the first general party
conference in 47 years was an indication that large-scale
corruption still exists in the Central Asian republic.
   Korotich said the investigation that uncovered the bribe-taking
was part of a larger probe that implicated the son-in-law of the
late Soviet leader Leonid I. Brezhnev.
   In January, Tass reported that Brezhnev's relative, Yuri
Churbanov, would go on trial for accepting bribes equal to 270
years' pay for the average Soviet factory worker.
   Korotich said the suspected bribe-takers could not be called to
account because of connections between the courts and the party,
Tass reported.
   He addressed a session on the third day of the conference. His
remarks were punctuated by applause and shouts from the floor,
where almost 5,000 delegates were seated.
   ``I would very much like it if the Party Control Commission and
the general procurator of the Soviet Union at last gave an
evaluation of what the investigators are saying, and either punish
those about whom we are talking or punish the investigators and
journalists who allowed themselves to put innocent people under
suspicion,'' he said to loud applause.
   In an apparent reference to Korotich later, Uzbekistan party
chief Rafik Nishanov said demagogues are operating ``under the
cover of perestroika,'' the name Gorbachev has given his plans for
social and economic reform.
   Korotich took the floor after Georgy Razumovsky, head of the
conference credentials committee, said a long investigation would
be needed to find out if Ogonyok's allegations were true.
   The editor said the magazine's material was supplied by
investigators who still were following a trail of bribery and
corruption tied to former Uzbekistan party leader Sharaf Rashidov
and Churbanov. Brezhnev died in 1982 and Rashidov in 1983.
   Brezhnev's son-in-law was first deputy interior minister while
Brezhnev was alive but was fired soon afterward. Two Uzbekistan
officials have been executed after being convicted of corruption.
   Soviet television showed Korotich, documents in hand, turning to
the dais with Gorbachev directly behind him. After a cut, it showed
the editor answering questions while Gorbachev straightened a sheaf
of papers.
   Korotich would not identify those suspected of bribery, saying
only: ``The four people listed in the documents are delegates to
the party conference.''
   The newspaper Sovietskaya Rossiya said Thursday the
investigation of Churbanov had been completed and he would be tried
on charges of systematic bribe-taking along with former Uzbekistan
Interior Minister K. Yakhyayev, two of Yakhyayev's deputies and
five regional police chiefs.
   It said two senior officials implicated in the case committed
suicide, but did not name them.
   The bribe-taking allegations were referred to the Credentials
Committee on Wednesday during a passionate debate about the power
of the state-run press to criticize party and government officials,
official reports said. Gorbachev's program of reforms has
emboldened the media to report more openly on once taboo topics.

   A former postman who pleaded guilty to
stealing $2.50 from an envelope should be ordered to clean up his
neighborhood with a ``broom, dustbin and plastic sack,'' a federal
judge recommended.
   U.S. District Judge Thomas A. Higgins on Thursday also ordered
Leon Watson, 33, to repay $315 that a January indictment charged he
removed from envelopes carried on his route.
   Watson pleaded guilty to one count in a plea bargain calling for
a maximum prison sentence of three years.
   That count charged him with stealing $2.50 from an envelope
planted in a mailbox by U.S. Postal Service officials, who became
suspicious of Watson after residents complained that they had
received envelopes that were supposed to contain money but did not.
   ``I want Mr. Watson to become a custodian,'' Higgins said.
   ``He should be given a broom, dustbin and plastic sack and be
made to keep good and clean'' parks and other public property near
his home as community service work, the judge said.
   Higgins also ordered Watson to perform 300 hours of community
service work and gave him a three-year suspended sentence.

<HEAD>Wire Service Guild Ratifies One-Year Contract With UPI</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wire Service Guild members at
United Press International voted 95-31 to ratify a one-year
contract with UPI, Guild President Kevin Keane said.
   UPI President Paul Steinle said Thursday's vote ``signals the
beginning of an era of peace between the guild and management, and
it's one more message to the news industry that we are here for the
long haul.''
   The vote, which came after 15 months of negotiations, was
counted at the guild's office in New York and announced during the
55th annual convention of The Newspaper Guild, the parent union of
the wire service local.
   The contract, which runs through July 1, 1989, covers about 700
UPI editorial and other employees in the United States.
   The agreement was reached May 26 with a new guild negotiating
team that took over after another team quit May 9 in a dispute with
the guild's executive committee.
   The old contract expired in April 1987. The new pact replaces
work rules imposed by the company when it declared an impasse Nov.
1.
   Three months after that, operating control of the financially
troubled news wire service was transferred from Mexican publisher
Mario Vazquez Rana to WNW Group, a media investment company whose
chairman is Earl W. Brian and whose president is Steinle.
   Keane said that with a wage increase that took effect Nov. 1 and
another scheduled for Nov. 1, 1988, the top minimum pay under the
new contract will be $670 a week starting in the employee's eighth
year of service. Under the old contract, top scale was $585 a week,
starting in the sixth year.
   The new pact also improves pensions, restores job security and
union dues checkoffs, and continues a health insurance plan put in
effect after Nov. 1, Keane said.
   The guild loses its agency shop provision, under which employees
had to pay a fee to the union as a condition of employment, Keane
said.
   ``The executive committee and the negotiating committee were
certain this was the best contract available to UPI employees,''
Keane said.
   Charles Dale, president of the parent Newspaper Guild, called it
``a settlement about which I can't say I'm proud, but ... an
agreement that was necessary _ necessary for us to survive and
equally necessary for UPI to obtain the breathing space needed to
regain the viability that has been so sorely in question.''
   The company, which lost $20 million in 1987, announced March 30
it would seek to reach profitability by eliminating 150 jobs,
focusing on business news and embarking on joint electronic
ventures.

<HEAD>Radiation Slows Multiple Sclerosis Progression Up to 4 Years,
Study Suggests</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: ``Maass'' in 9th graf cq.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MALCOLM RITTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Researchers have nearly halted the progression
of multiple sclerosis in some patients for up to four years by
aiming radiation at specific sites in the body, a new study says.
   The four-year response is longer than any seen with other
experimental therapies, scientists said.
   The radiation was aimed at depleting the body's supply of white
blood cells that are believed to cause symptoms of the disease by
attacking nerve tissue.
   An estimated 250,000 Americans have multiple sclerosis, an often
crippling condition that can include weakness, difficulty in
coordination, dizziness, and loss of balance.
   Patients in the study had chronic progressive MS, an unremitting
form that steadily worsens. The disease also has an
``exacerbating-remitting'' form, in which a patient suffers
isolated attacks.
   About a third of MS cases begin in chronic progressive fashion.
Of those that start out as isolated attacks instead, about 60
percent eventually convert to the chronic progressive form.
   While radiation is probably not the ultimate answer to multiple
sclerosis, study co-author Stuart Cook said, ``right now, if I had
chronic progressive MS, I would be very interested in taking part
in a trial that was using this.''
   ``I think it's promising,'' said Dr. William Sibley, chairman of
the National Multiple Sclerosis Society's committee on therapeutic
claims. ``What it needs is confirmation from another group.''
   The work is described in the July issue of the journal Neurology
by Cook, chairman of the neuroscience department at the University
of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey-New Jersey Medical School,
Raymond Troiano of the medical school, Corinne Devereux of the
Clara Maass Medical Center in Belleville, N.J., and colleagues.
   The researchers focused the radiation on the spleen and lymph
glands in the neck, under the armpits, in the chest and abdomen and
above the groin.
   Twenty-seven patients received radiation and 21 others
unwittingly received sham treatments, so that experimenters could
account for any psychological benefit from experiencing treatment.
The radiation treatments lasted about five weeks.
   Then the patients were followed for up to 48 months to see how
many deteriorated at least one notch on a disability-rating scale.
   When compared at six-month intervals, 20 percent to 30 percent
fewer of the radiation-treated patients than the sham-treatment
patients showed that deterioration.
   Researchers also analyzed results from the 17 radiation-treated
patients who showed the fewest remaining white cells three months
after treatment stopped. They showed only minimal deterioration in
MS disability, averaging less than one notch on the scale, when
checked for periods ranging up to four years, Cook said.
   The other irradiated patients fared significantly worse.
   No major side effects appeared in the irradiated patients, Cook
said. Nausea, hair loss, diarrhea and other problems sometimes led
to short-term postponements of therapy sessions, researchers said.
   One death apparently related to the treatment was reported, from
complications of a respiratory infection.
   As for risk of cancer, Cook said other researchers gave twice as
much radiation in a similar treatment program for Hodgkin's
disease, a form of cancer, and patients in that study have shown
low risk of developing additional cancer 15 years after treatment.
   The next step is to see if other researchers can duplicate the
results of the new multiple sclerosis experiment, and to compare
the radiation treatment to other experimental therapies, he said.
   Sibley said the radiation technique has been used for some time
in treating Hodgkin's disease, and its risks are well known and
minimal.
   ``It's probably less toxic than many of the other treatments
(for MS) that are being recommended these days,'' Sibley said.

<HEAD>Judge Orders Arrest Of Ex-president Accused Of Corruption</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge ordered the
arrest of former President Salvador Jorge Blanco if he does not
return from the United States within 15 days to face corruption
charges.
   Judge Juan Maria Severino Tejada announced Wednesday that he
ordered any qualified Dominican authority to try to capture Jorge
Blanco if he does not return. The judge's order also stated that
Jorge Blanco will be tried in absentia if he does not appear in
court within 15 days.
   Dominican authorities allowed the former president, who
complained of a heart condition, to fly to Atlanta in May 1987 for
medical treatment.
   Jorge Blanco, who was president from 1982-86, is one of nearly
20 former government officials accused of widespread corruption
during the former president's administration. They are accused of
misusing government funds to buy military equipment at inflated
prices and embezzling money from a public food program.
   The corruption investigation was ordered by President Joaquin
Balaguer after he took office. Blanco has called the charges
``political persecution.''
   It was unknown whether the former president intended to heed the
judicial order or remain in exile.

<HEAD>Former Government Official Jailed For Taking Bribes from US Firm</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former Australian government
employee was sentenced today to 15 months in jail after he admitted
taking bribes from an American aviation company. The Australian
manager of the firm also was jailed.
   Melbourne County Court Judge Mervyn Kimm said Leonard Calder
Freeman took bribes of unknown value while working as a purchasing
officer at the Australian Federal Government Aircraft Factory in
Melbourne.
   Freeman, 60, on Thursday pleaded guilty to seven counts of
taking bribes between 1983 and 1986.
   The former Australian general manager of the North Hollywood,
Calif.-based Citicorp Aviation Industry Resources Inc., Werner
Gunther Becker, also pleaded guilty Thursday to seven counts of
paying the bribes. Becker, 30, was sentenced today to 12 months.
   The judge said Freeman was paid 5 percent of the value of orders
for aircraft parts placed with the U.S. firm.
   ``You were in a position of trust and responsibility and you
grossly failed in that trust and responsibility,'' Kimm told
Freeman. ``You admitted in a police interview that you knew what
you were doing was against the law, but nevertheless you
continued.''
   Kimm said Freeman had had a similar agreement with the firm's
previous general manager, who died in 1983.
   The previous general manager had worked for a firm that was
taken over by Citicorp Aviation Industry Resources.
   At the man's funeral, Freeman approached Becker to see if the
deal was to continue, the judge said.
   Testimony indicated Becker contacted superiors in the United
States who advised him to continue to pay Freeman.
   The judge said Freeman gave the firm details of quotes provided
by other firms, and in some cases was able to place smaller orders
directly with the U.S. firm.
   Kimm set a minimum non-parole term of nine months for Freeman
and six months for Becker.

<DATELINE>COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mildred Gillars, known during World War II
as ``Axis Sally'' for her Nazi propaganda broadcasts and later
imprisoned for treason, has died at age 87.
   Ms. Gillars died Saturday at a hospital in Columbus, where she
lived in an apartment on the city's north side. Neighbors said she
had lived a quiet, private life teaching music to kindergartners
following her release from a West Virginia federal prison in 1961.
   ``She was brilliant,'' said a neighbor, Colleen Wiley. ``She
spoke and taught French and German. She was a great reader. ... We
thought the world of her.''
   There was no announcement of her death or obituary notice. A
private funeral service was held at St. Joseph Cemetery, her
attorney, James Sauer, said Thursday.
   During her trial on treason charges in 1949, Ms. Gillars said
she was born in Portland, Maine, in November 1900. She graduated
from high school at Conneaut, Ohio, and attended Ohio Wesleyan
University.
   She left the school before graduating and traveled to Germany,
where she took a job with German radio in 1940.
   ``Hello, gang,'' her broadcasts to Allied forces began. ``Throw
down those little old guns and toddle off home. There's no getting
the Germans down.''
   After the war, American military officials found her living in
cellars of bombed-out buildings in Berlin. She was shipped home in
August 1948 and was arrested by U.S. marshals who charged her with
treason.
   Ms. Gillars testified that she had fallen in love with a German
Foreign Service officer who talked her into making the broadcasts.
She said she loved her country and would never intentionally betray
it.
   She was convicted and sentenced to 10 to 30 years in prison. She
served 12 years in a federal prison at Alderson, W.Va.
   When released, Ms. Gillars moved to Columbus and taught music at
a kindergarten school.
   Sauer said he was not aware of any surviving relatives.

   The political action committee of the
National Education Association, the nation's largest teacher's
union, has given Democratic presidential hopeful Michael Dukakis
its backing for his party's nomination.
   The decision came Thursday during a closed-door meeting of NEA's
political action committee prior to the teacher group's annual
convention scheduled in New Orleans next week.
   Dukakis ``believes in and supports a view and a vision of
education policy consistent with our efforts to assure every child
a quality education,'' said NEA president Mary Hatwood Futrell.
   The endorsement, which applies only to the Democratic
nomination, won't become official until today, when the NEA board
of directors is scheduled to meet and is almost certainly to concur
with NEA-PAC's choice.
   NEA officials said the 1.9 million-member union plans to withold
a final presidential endorsement until Sept. 8, after both parties
have held their conventions.
   Dukakis picked up his first formal labor endorsement on
Wednesday from the 59,000-member National Treasury Employees Union,
a group that represents mostly federal Internal Revenue Service and
Customs Service workers.

<TEXT>
   Atlanta police officials are urging the courts
not to expand facilities for demonstrators during next month's
Democratic National Convention.
   Police said Thursday it would confound security plans for the
event.
   An umbrella dissident group, Alternative '88, is suing the city
of Atlanta in U.S. District Court for additional space for protests
near The Omni, the site of the July 18-21 convention.
   The city has leased two parking lots, covering about two acres,
about half a block from The Omni on Marietta Street. Several groups
have applied for parade permits down Marietta.
   But Deputy Police Chief Willie Taylor testified the premits were
denied because demonstrators might chose to lie down in Marietta
Street as a form of protest and that would block delegate access to
the convention hall.
   Judge Orinda Evans, who is hearing the case without a jury,
continued it until today after two days of testimony.

   The secretary of state's office says all
but about 600,000 of Minnesota's eligible voters are registered.
   Officials are crediting state incentive programs designed to
increase participation in elections with the high registration
numbers.
   About 85,000 Minnesotans have returned voter registration forms
that were mailed for the first time this year with their income tax
booklets.
   People applying for or renewing driver's licenses also receive
voter registration information, and Secretary of State Joan Growe
said Wednesday that the state has received about 55,000 forms back
from that effort.
   An additional 40,000 to 50,000 forms filled out by driver's
license applicants are believed to have been sent directly to
county auditors, Growe said. About 2,000 voter registration forms
obtained during visits to other state agencies also have been
returned, Growe said.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar hit its highest levels of the year
against the Japanese yen in Tokyo during Friday morning trading,
continuing its recent advance. Stock prices took a plunge.
   The dollar opened at 133.57 yen, up a strong 1.37 yen from its
previous day closing, and rose rapidly to end the week at 134.50
yen, up 2.30 yen from Thursday's close.
   It was the dollar's highest level since reaching about 133.95
yen on Dec. 2.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues, the market's main barometer, shed 265.87 points,
or 0.95 percent, to close at 27,503.53.
   An exchange dealer at a major commercial bank, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, said the local market seemed to be testing
whether Japan's central bank would take any action to stem the
dollar's rise.
   Earlier this week, Japanese monetary authorities, including
Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa, said the Bank of Japan would step
into the market if necessary to brake the dollar's upswing.
   But dealers said the central bank had not yet intervened to prop
up the yen and said the currency might fall even further against
the dollar.
   ``We see the dollar rising to the 135-yen range,'' said Nikko
Securities' Yoshio Ogawa.

   President Daniel Ortega said Secretary
of State George P. Shultz's trip to Central America could reignite
Nicaragua's civil war and that Sandinista troops will be on guard
despite the renewal of a truce.
   Ortega said Thursday he was extending a unilateral cease-fire
until July 31. He also proposed new peace talks with the
U.S.-backed Contra rebels, which have been fighting the leftist
government since 1981.
   The rebels have not yet replied to his proposal for a new round
of talks in Managua July 27-29.
   In Guatemala City, Shultz and leaders of the Nicaraguan
Resistance on Thursday discussed reviving the talks and using a
carrot-and-stick approach with the Sandinistas.
   Contra leader Alfredo Cesar said they talked about offering U.S.
aid to the Sandinistas to induce them to enact promises of
democratic reforms. They also discussed renewed military aid to the
rebels if the Sandinista refused.
   Contra commander Enrique Bermudez, who met with Shultz, said the
cease-fire announcement was not important. He said the rebels have
said all along that they have no intention of resuming the fighting
but will defend themselves if attacked.
   The rebels rejected a similar invitation for June, saying the
Nicaraguan capital did not have an ``atmosphere'' conducive to
negotiations.
   In a pastoral letter issued earlier this week, Nicaragua's
bishops pleaded with the combatants to resurrect the stalled talks
and heed the Nicaraguan people's ``heartbreaking clamor'' for peace.
   Ortega said Shultz had come to Central American bearing ``a
message loaded with hate for the people of Nicaragua, directed at
seeking how to isolate it and seek more resources in Congress to
continue the war against Nicaragua.''
   Shultz has criticized Nicaragua as a ``totalitarian society''
during his three-day trip and compared it unfavorably to the
region's four U.S.-backed democracies: Costa Rica, El Salvador,
Honduras and Guatemala.
   Ortega said ``many dramatic things can occur in the coming days
or weeks because something must come of this trip by Shultz _ a
military escalation.''
   In Washington, administration officials have said President
Reagan may ask Congress to renew military aid to the Contras.
   The United States has been funding the Nicaraguan rebels since
1981, but military aid to the Contras ran out shortly before the
peace talks began.
   Ortega spoke Thursday before 1,200 military officers and
announced the truce renewal shortly after returning from an
official visit to Cuba. His announcement came just hours before the
latest in a series of truces with the Contras was to run out.
   In Cuba, Ortega signed a $150 million assistance agreement under
which Cuba will pardon a $50 million debt and give economically
crippled Nicaragua oil, food and technical assistance with sugar
refineries and an industrial plant.
   Ortega said the pact shows ``the willingness of the Cuban people
and government to cooperate with the people and government of
Nicaragua to better face the critical situation that North American
aggression is imposing on us.
   ``While Cuba makes these decisions, the American government acts
in a contrary line,'' he said.
   The United States regards Cuba and Nicaragua as the hemisphere's
prime communist threats and has trade embargoes against both
nations.
   Ortega called his decision to extend the truce a ``demonstration
of common sense and responsibility because we don't want to give up
the possibility of a negotiated solution.''
   ``But this does not mean that we are going to let down our guard
... because we know that they (the Contras) are not going to keep
their word and are infiltrating forces from Honduras.''
   The Contras and the Sandinistas agreed to a 60-day truce and
peace talks on March 23. Ortega later renewed the cease-fire and
the Contras agreed to go along. Since then, talks between the two
sides have broken down and each has accused the other of violating
the truce.

   Guerrillas attacked a police
station with guns and rocket-propelled grenades early today, and a
taxi driver was wounded in the crossfire.
   Police said the guerrillas made a getaway in a car. The
guerrillas and police were not injured and the police station was
not badly damaged.
   No group immediately claimed responsibility, but suspicion fell
on the Irish Republican Army.
   The mainly Roman Catholic IRA is fighting to end British rule in
Northern Ireland and unite the predominantly Protestant province
with the overwhelmingly Catholic Irish Republic under socialist
rule.
   The 46-year-old cab driver was taken to a hospital and received
emergency surgery, a police spokesman said on condition of
anonymity.
   The spokesman did not say whether the cab driver was hit by
police shooting or by shooting by the guerrillas. The victim
appeared to have driven into the crossfire by accident.
   The British Broadcasting Corp. reported that a woman passenger
in the cab at the time was not injured.
   Police said they recovered a Soviet-made rocket-propelled
grenade-launcher, a grenade, two radios and ammunition from the
scene.
   On Tuesday, an IRA bomb exploded in a school bus carrying 12
girls, seriously injuring one of them.
   Police said the bomb was intended for the driver of the bus, a
part-time soldier. He was cut in the face and eyes. The IRA claimed
responsibility for the attack and said it regretted injuring the
14-year-old girl.

<HEAD>China Marks Day Of Three Billion In Asia</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chinese officials handed out cassette players
today to 18 family planning heroes and urged diligence in stemming
a new baby boom at a ceremony marking the Day of 3 Billion In Asia.
   The day was proclaimed by the Asian Forum of Parliamentarians on
Population and Development to draw attention to Asia reaching a
population of 3 billion this year.
   Speaker after speaker stood up at the Great Hall of the People
in central Beijing to warn that rapid population growth poses a
threat to economic development.
   ``We cannot think that we can have more children because of
economic development ... nor can we relax our efforts because of
progress in family planning,'' said Hu Keshi, forum vice chairman.
   China has limited most families to one child since the early
1980s in an attempt to keep its population, now 1.08 billion, from
exceeding 1.2 billion at the turn of the century.
   But the limit has been widely flouted in the past two years and
officials now tacitly acknowledge that ceiling will be exceeded.
   After several years in which the population grew by 1.1 percent
annually, it soared in 1986 and 1987 to 1.4 percent as a return to
family farming and private enterprise inadvertently encouraged
couples to have more children as potential sources of income.
   Another reason for the baby boom is that 360 million children
born during the last boom, from 1962 to 1975, have reached
child-bearing age, Peng Peiyun, head of the State Family Planning
Commission, told the gathering.
   She described China's population problem as severe and said,
``We must take a firm hand ... and never slacken our efforts.''
   Premier Li Peng delivered the same message in a speech on
national television and radio Thursday night, but noted the task
will not be easy and ``population problems cannot be solved within
a short period of time.''
   Officials have responded to the baby boom by intensifying family
planning propaganda, announcing punishments for local officials
whose districts exceed their birth quotas and rewarding successful
officials.
   At today's ceremony, 18 family planning workers, doctors and
representatives of local districts were given radio-cassette
players for ``outstanding performance in implementing our
population policy.''
   None of the speakers mentioned a growing phenomenon reported
Thursday in the official media in which families and district
officials fail to register babies that exceed the local quotas,
rendering them official non-persons. Such children lack residence
permits and cannot register for school or receive government ration
cards for rice and edible oil.
   Aprodicio Laquian, a representative of the U.N. Fund for
Population Activities in Beijing, said one reason for the boom is
that local governments often lack the funds to give couples
promised incentives for having only one child.
   The pull of tradition also is strong, and many women whose first
child is a girl have a second in hopes of bearing a son to carry on
the family line.
   But in a speech at the ceremony, Laquian said China's efforts
should be a lesson to other Asian countries with higher growth
rates, such as Bangladesh at 2.61 percent and Indonesia at 1.74
percent.
   He said India, growing at 1.72 percent per year, likely will
surpass China as the world's most populous country by the year 2050.

   Jack and Lorna Rhine, dryland farmers
who depend solely on rainfall, feel almost guilty talking about
their thriving wheat fields while farmers in the drought-stricken
Midwest and South pray for rain.
   ``They lose and we gain _ someone has to suffer to make anything
now,'' Jack Rhine said.
   Around them farms are dust-choked, but the Rhines have enjoyed
more than double the usual rainfall for this time of year and are
looking forward to one of their best winter wheat harvests ever. In
addition, they stand to benefit from wheat prices driven up by crop
damage elsewhere.
   ``We're just abundant, and you go 100 miles southeast of here
and it's dry,'' said Rhine on Wednesday.
   Abundance for the Rhines means 6 or 7 inches of rain in the last
two months, compared to about 3 inches during those months most
years and an average annual rainfall of about 14 inches.
   So far this year they also have managed to escape the hailstorms
that can wipe out a wheat field in an hour.
   The Rhines' 3,000 acres lie about 40 miles east of Denver and
the Rocky Mountains. A single dry creek runs across the property.
The only water their wheat gets comes from rainfall, and the Rhines
are more susceptible to moisture levels than farmers who irrigate.
   Rhine, vice president of the Adams County Farm Bureau, said most
farms along the Front Range are faring well this year. A string of
90-degree-plus days in the middle of June caused some heat stress,
he said, but not as much as in areas farther east and south.
   The Rhines plan to harvest their wheat in two to three weeks, a
couple of weeks earlier than usual. They expect to get 35 bushels
per acre, near the limit the thin soil can produce, Rhine said.
   On Wednesday, the Rhines had to stop tilling a fallow field when
the tractor wheels began kicking up clods of mud after a midday
rain shower.
   ``This is more like Hawaii or Florida weather than Colorado,''
said Mrs. Rhine.
   The Rhines haven't always been so lucky. Jack Rhine, 57, lived
in the same area in 1935 and remembers his wheat-farmer father
scraping by, growing just enough food to feed the family while the
fields turned to dust.
   The Rhines got their own farm in 1954, a year that brought a
poor harvest. They recall floods that washed away their crops, hail
that damaged their fields and more than a few dry spells.
   In the last five or six years, wheat cost more to grow than it
was worth at market, they say, and they lost some extra revenue
when two oil wells on their property went bust a few years ago.
   Rhine said that thanks to the drought in much of the country,
wheat prices, which recently topped $4 a bushel, likely will stay
higher than the $3.25 to $3.50 he invests per bushel.
   Other parts of Colorado haven't escaped the drought and
scorching temperatures, which come on the heels of a dry fall and
winter. Colorado State University agronomist Jim Echols has
predicted the state's winter wheat crop could be reduced by as much
as 25 percent.
   ``The drought helps us, but it's really a disaster for those
people,'' said Rhine. ''I don't think a person should brag very
much because it really isn't a very fair thing. ... It's worked
just the opposite other times.''

<HEAD>South Korean Construction Workers Killed In Iraqi Raid On Iran</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An Iraqi raid on a gas plant
construction site in Iran has left 13 South Korean construction
workers dead and 37 others injured, Daelim Industrial Co. reported
today.
   The South Korean contractor said the raid occurred Thursday in
Kangan, a town on the coast of the Persian Gulf about 550 miles
south of Iran's capital, Tehran.
   Officials said that eight Iraqi Air Force planes bombed the area
Thursday morning, firing six rockets and strafing the area with
machine gun fire, according to reports from Daelim's construction
manager in Kangan.
   The injured workers have been evacuated to hospitals on the
nearby coastal city of Bushehr, the officials said.
   Tehran's official Islamic Republic New Agency, monitored in
Nicosia, Cyprus, said Iraqi jets bombed ``an industrial-labor
complex'' on Iran's southern gulf coast, killing or wounding an
unspecified number of workers and causing some damage.
   Daelim has been building the gas plant under a $180-million
contract with Iran. Officials in South Korea said it was not known
yet how much damage was inflicted upon the plant under
construction. About 400 Korean workers reportedly were on the
project.
   South Korean Foreign Minister Choi Kwang-soo said South Korea
would take ``necessary diplomatic steps'' against Iraq as soon as
detailed information was obtained on the incident.

<HEAD>Vermont Castings Retires Its Answer to the Model T</HEAD>

<DATELINE>RANDOLPH, Vt. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's largest maker of woodstoves
threw a party to mark the demise of its popular Defiant model, the
victim of environmental regulations effective today that require
new stoves to burn more cleanly.
   ``The Defiant is a symbol of the end of an era,'' Vermont
Castings Inc. Chairman Duncan Syme said Thursday, calling the
woodstove his company's answer to the Model T.
   Syme decided to forego the gnashing of teeth and complaints
about government regulation. Instead, his company designed some new
stoves and threw a big party for the company's retiring mainstay.
   Born in 1975 of the energy crisis, a back-to-the-land ethic and
a desire by many to thumb their noses at OPEC and the big oil
companies, the Defiant quickly became a symbol of a lifestyle. More
than 130,000 stoves have been sold.
   Syme was an architect who was trying in the early '70s to
integrate woodstoves into some of his designs. ``We looked around
and didn't see any good ones,'' he said.
   He got together with his now deceased brother-in-law Murray
Howell, a Wall Street investment banker.
   ``We sensed that there was a consumer need for a good-looking
stove (on which) you could open the doors and celebrate this thing
of bringing flame into your livingroom,'' Syme said.
   They caught the market's wave just before it swelled and the
company became an overnight success. Sales have declined since the
heyday, but Syme said the company has settled into a comfortable
niche marketing colorful new stoves, often to upscale city dwellers
and suburbanites who want a livingroom showpiece.
   Thanks to the Defiant, Vermont Castings grew to become the
nation's largest woodstove manufacturer and now employs about 400
people, most of them at plants in Randolph and nearby Bethel.
   Responding to environmental concerns over woodsmoke pollution
and the new regulations, the company has introduced two new models
designed to cut down on particulates and some of the gasses in
woodsmoke.
   The new EPA rules require stove makers to cut particulates in
smoke by 77 percent effective today, and by 81 percent from the
pre-1988 standard in 1990. Vermont Castings officials, wary of a
patchwork of regulations in states concerned about winter haze,
helped the EPA devise the new rules, said David Kimbell, the
company's vice president for marketing.
   The new stoves meet the standards by burning wood more
efficiently, Kimbell said, adding that the company has been working
with a catalytic combuster designed to burn most of the woodsmoke.
   Syme, 50, who wore a straw hat and bow tie Thursday as he
addressed the crowd of Vermont dignitaries, company employees and
dealers who milled about among balloons, ale and other props under
yellow-and-white-striped party tents.
   ``This is like a commencement,'' he said. ``It's as if we've had
a fun time together these last four years in the ivy halls ... and
I think we're on the threshold of a new and exciting future.''

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A movie about a sensitive Israeli soldier who
increasingly resorts to violence against Palestinians and a
documentary on the growing hatred between Jews and Arabs highlight
this year's Jerusalem Film Festival.
   Organizers said the Arab-Israeli conflict, including the
seven-month Palestinian uprising in the occupied territories, would
be a key theme throughout the 10-day event.
   ``We wanted to show our concern and also place the festival in a
historical context,'' said festival spokeswoman Yael Munk,
explaining the selection.
   The festival was launched Thursday night with the documentary
``Walls'' about the effects of the uprising on Arab and Jewish
residents of Jerusalem and the short feature ``Dissolves'' about
the experiences of a young Israeli soldier in the West Bank.
   ``Walls,'' a collage of news footage and emotionally charged
interviews, shows how the uprising has further raised the barriers
of hatred and suspicion between Arabs and Jews in the disputed city.
   A Jewish slum resident tells film maker, Uri Goldstein, that he
would kill all Arabs if he were prime minister.
   On the other side of town, a Palestinian says that while he
still judges Jews on an individual basis, his children fear all
Jews and the words ``Jew'' and ``soldier'' have become synonymous.
   Another Jewish resident interviewed in the film says the
suffering of the Palestinians is nothing compared to what the Jews
have gone through in their 2,000-year history. Counters a
Palestinian: ``This is not a competition in suffering.''
   As an illustration, Goldstein shows a little girl playing on the
gravestone of two Israeli children killed after a bomb planted by
Palestinian guerrillas exploded on an Israeli bus.
   A few yards down the road, Palestinian teen-agers gather around
the grave of their friend who was killed in the uprising.
   The feature ``Dissolves'' tells the story of Gai, a sensitive
18-year-old from a liberal home who, fresh out of basic training,
is sent to the occupied West Bank.
   In the first scene, a dream sequence, Gai is chasing a young
Arab stone-thrower up a hill. When he finally catches up with the
stone-thrower, Gai stands frozen because he sees that the boy has
wet himself in fear. Nearby, Gai's right-wing comrade beats another
young Arab who shouts ``not in the face, not in the face.''
   In another scene, Gai's unit enounters Arab stone-throwers and
one of his comrades is struck in the head by a large brick thrown
from a roof. Gai chases the assailant, pulls him to the ground and
in a furious rage thrashes him with his rifle until he is pulled
off by two other soldiers.
   In the final episode, Gai returns home and tells his father, who
has spent many sleepless nights worrying about his son, that he has
killed an Arab woman.
   Other festival films dealing with the Arab-Israeli conflict are
``Shattered Dreams'' which tackles the theme from the point of view
of an Israeli in exile, and ``The Children of Dheishe,'' a
documentary about a kindergarten in a West Bank refugee camp.
   The festival, which was founded in 1984, offers 130 films from
39 countries, including a retrospective of films by U.S. director
Frank Capra.
   Ms. Munk said organizers received some cancellations, but that
no one turned down invitations for political reasons.

<HEAD>House Panel OKs Bill on Sale of Cable Programming</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rural satellite dish owners moved one step
closer to legally receiving cable television programming with a
House subcommittee vote approving a bill giving independent
distributors rights to sell the scrambled programming.
   The bill was approved Thursday by a narrow 13-11 vote of the
House Energy and Commerce telecommunications subcommittee, with
many supporters saying they would prefer the industry work out its
own solution.
   ``We are not convinced there is a true marketplace at work,''
said committee chairman Rep. Edward J. Markey, D-Mass.
   Under the bill, approved 13-11, any cable programmer that sells
its programming to at least one distributor other than a cable
operator would have to make that programming available to all other
distributors.
   Congress has been concerned that some cable programmers have
been unwilling to sell their programming to third-party
distributors, thus shutting out potential competitors.
   But ``the fate of this legislation rests as much in the hand of
the affected industries as it does in the hand of Congress,''
Markey said.

<HEAD>Voice of America Writer Sues To Publish Article Without Agency
Review</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A writer for the Voice of America says that
she should not be required to obtain prior approval from the
government to publish an article accusing the Reagan administration
of politicizing agency broadcasts.
   Carolyn Weaver on Thursday filed suit challenging federal
regulations that require Voice of America employees to get
government approval to publish articles or make speeches about U.S.
foreign policy or the agency's operation.
   Weaver's suit, the first court challenge to the rules, charges
that the clearance requirement is a form of prior restraint
prohibited by the First Amendment, according to her attorney,
Stephen M. Kohn.
   The regulations give the government the right to delete passages
or stop publication of publication of material it considers
``inaccurate, inconsistent with current foreign policy, or can
reasonably be expected to affect adversely U.S. foreign relations.''
   Employees must submit all books or manuscripts ``of official
concern'' for clearance by the U.S. Information Agency, which
operates the Voice of America. The regulation also covers employees
of the State Department and the Agency for International
Development.

<HEAD>Massachusetts' Fiscal Year Ends With No Budget _ Or Governor _ In
Sight</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER B. DALY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Massachusetts Republicans criticized Gov. Michael
S. Dukakis for campaigning for president out of state the day the
state's fiscal year ended with a nearly $400 million deficit and no
new budget in sight.
   The Dukakis administration has acknowledged that the state
government was technically $397 million short of funds for fiscal
1988, which ended Thursday, due to an unexpected slowdown in tax
payments and the cost of court-ordered corporate tax abatements.
   The shortfall comes at an awkward time for Dukakis, the probable
Democratic presidential nominee, who has stressed his managerial
skills on the campaign trail. For the last several years
Massachusetts has had only budget surpluses.
   To address the problem, the governor filed a supplemental budget
with the Legislature containing a 20-point plan to tap cash
reserves and make bookkeeping adjustments to close the $397 million
gap.
   But House Minority Leader Steven Pierce charged Thursday that it
was ``inconceivable'' that the Democratic governor would be out of
state campaigning with the budget crisis unresolved.
   Dukakis spokesman Steve Crawford said the governor would be
working in his office today, Saturday and possibly Monday.
   ``He is in constant contact with his office. His chief of staff
and his secretary of administration and finance are regularly
discussing the budget process with legislative leaders,'' Crawford
said.
   In recent years, the state government has often gone several
days or even weeks into a new fiscal year without a budget, which
must be balanced under the state constitution.
   Administration and Finance Secretary Frank Keefe said the
government could keep functioning without a budget through
Wednesday, when millions of dollars in checks must be issued to
cover the state payroll, welfare payments and other obligations.
   Lawmakers are nearing final approval of a series of tax bills
and fee-raising measures that would help pay for expanded state
spending projected for fiscal 1989.
   Meanwhile Thursday, the state Revenue Department was busy
opening envelopes in a drive to collect every possible tax dollar
that can be attributed to fiscal 1988 to help cover the $397
million deficit.
   For the coming year, the House and Senate have endorsed separate
budgets that call for spending approximately $11.8 billion, or
about 8 percent more than fiscal 1988. But the two versions differ
in details, and a team of negotiators plans to work through Tuesday
on a compromise.
   Dukakis and the Democratic legislative leaders have agreed on a
spending target of $11.8 billion next year, and they have embarked
on a program of at least $200 million in higher taxes, fines and
fees to support the higher spending.
   Dukakis already has signed a $40 million cigarette tax measure.
The House passed and sent to the Senate three more revenue bills
that would raise another $163 million by bringing the state income
tax back into conformance with federal rules, by closing a
corporate tax ``loophole,'' raising fines for traffic violations,
increasing wetlands filing fees and claiming unclaimed soft drink
and beer bottle deposits.
   Republicans have charged that Dukakis is knowingly
overestimating state revenues in order to claim that the budget is
in balance.

<HEAD>Researchers Studying Use Of AZT By Health Care Workers Exposed To
AIDS</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some doctors and other health workers
exposed to the AIDS virus are taking the drug AZT as a preventive
measure, despite potentially serious side effects associated with
the anti-AIDS medication.
   AZT _ the only federally approved anti-AIDS drug _ can cause
muscle aches, nausea, headaches and severe anemia. Additionally,
medical experts have mixed opinions about using AZT, now known as
zidovudine, to prevent infection after exposure.
   Dr. Julie Gerberding of San Francisco General Hospital said she
is often asked whether the side effects of AZT outweigh the chances
of infection after a health worker is pricked with an AIDS-tainted
needle.
   ``I've been bombarded with calls from health care workers around
the country,'' said Gerberding, who is directing a study on the
risk of AIDS infection among health workers.
   Researchers believe AZT may keep the AIDS virus from installing
itself on the genetic material of cells if the drug is taken soon
after exposure, thus preventing AIDS infection. However, the
medical community is split over whether the drug should be
administered before a patient develops AIDS symptoms.
   Dr. Paul Volberding, an AIDS authority at San Francisco General,
said the odds of AIDS infection in a health care worker with a deep
cut who comes in contact with the virus may run as high as one in
100. He said 22 health workers worldwide have become accidentally
infected.
   Last month, Burroughs Wellcome Co., the only maker of AZT, began
a nationwide study of health workers accidentally exposed to the
virus.
   Karen Collins, a spokeswoman for the drug company, said workers
are required to enroll within five days of exposure. Half will
receive a six-week supply of the drug free of charge and half will
get a placebo, she said.
   Researchers at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda,
Md., said Thursday they are seeking approval from the federal Food
and Drug Administration for a similar study that could start within
a month. The NIH study, which would concentrate on workers facing
``massive exposures'' to the virus, would not use placebos, said
Debbie Katz, who is coordinating the project.
   Gerberding said she knew two workers at her hospital who took
AZT after being exposed to the AIDS virus through tainted blood.
   William Owen, a doctor in private practice who treats AIDS
patients, said he prescribed the drug to a surgeon who cut his hand
with a scalpel while operating on a patient with acquired immune
deficiency syndrome.
   Since patients may acquire AZT through their personal
physicians, the number of people taking the drug as a preventive
measure is not known.
   ``Like everything else with AIDS, it's quasi-underground,'' said
Dr. June Fisher, who runs the city's Center of Municipal
Occupational Safety and Health, a health clinic.
   Volberding said he has enough faith in the drug's efficacy that
he could not in good conscience advise AIDS-exposed workers to
enroll in the Burroughs Wellcome study because he'd be afraid they
would get the placebo.
   However, Dr. Martin Hirsch of Massachusetts General Hospital
said if he was accidentally exposed to the virus he probably would
enroll in the Burroughs Wellcome study rather than take the drug on
his own.

<DATELINE>SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 2-year-old who was kidnapped as a
baby and adopted by an Israeli couple returned home clutching her
Brazilian parents and a teddy bear.
   Her mother said she would someday allow her child to decide if
she wants to meet her adoptive parents in Israel, even though her
lawyer said the Tel Aviv couple knew something was amiss in the
adoption.
   Bruna Vasconcelos arrived Thursday at Sao Paulo's international
airport with her parents, Rosilda and Luis Vasconcelos, on a flight
from London. They had stopped there en route from Tel Aviv.
   ``I feel as if Bruna and I never had been separated, that she
was never kidnapped,'' the child's mother told reporters while the
brown-haired girl played with their tape recorders and microphones.
The child also smiled and waved.
   The Vasconcelos' two-year ordeal started Oct. 13, 1986, when
their child, then 4 months old, was abducted from their home in the
southern city of Curitiba. One year later, the child was located in
Israel, and the couple regained custody after a court battle with
her adoptive parents.
   Asked if she would one day allow Bruna to visit her former
adoptive parents, Mrs. Vasconcelos said: ``When she is older, I
will tell her the whole story of what happened to her. Then she
will be able to decide on her own whether or not she wants to see
them again.''
   Shortly after arriving back in Brazil, the child, dressed in a
green jump suit, romped through the baggage-claim area, rode the
conveyor belt and wheeled around a pushcart. Occasionally, she
interrupted her play to embrace her parents.
   The family later boarded a plane for Curitiba, where Parana
state authorities planned a big reception and meeting with Gov.
Alvaro Dias.
   At a brief news conference held in the airport's press room,
Mrs. Vasconcelos, looking tired but composed, held Bruna on her lap
and said, ``I never doubted I would be reunited with my daughter.
It's a marvelous feeling having her back, and I owe it all to my
faith in God, luck, persistence and the many people who helped me.''
   Police say Bruna's kidnapping was the work of one of many
baby-trafficking rings that abduct or buy infants from mothers in
poor areas and sell them for hefty profits to childless foreign
couples.
   Adoption by foreigners is legal in Brazil, but it is a
time-consuming bureaucratic process that sometimes takes several
years. With phony or even legitimate papers obtained through
corrupt officials, the baby-trafficking rings can arrange an
adoption within weeks, police say.
   The Israeli couple who adopted Bruna, Yaacov and Simone
Turgeman, paid $25,000 to intermediaries but said they acted in
good faith, believing the high fee and documents were legal.
   But Shimon Schuber, the Israeli lawyer who helped the Brazilian
couple get their daughter back, said: ``The Turgemans may not have
known Bruna had been kidnapped, but they certainly knew something
was fishy. They knew the documents were phony.''
   Schuber, who accompanied Bruna back to Brazil, said: ``They had
to know something was illegal about the whole thing. No one goes to
Paraguay to adopt a Brazilian child and thinks it's all legal.''
   Almost immediately after her abduction, Bruna was taken across
the border to neighboring Paraguay, where she was handed over to
the Turgemans.
   About one year afterward, Bruna was located near Tel Aviv. Her
parents contacted Brazilian authorities for help in getting her
back, and earlier this month, the Israeli Supreme Court decided she
should be returned to her parents in Brazil.
   Mrs. Vasconcelos said that at first her relationship with the
Turgemans ``was just fine. They seemed understanding and were
willing to cooperate. But later the relationship deteriorated.''
She declined to say why.
   Olavo de Souza, a Curitiba radio reporter who covered the story
in Israel for more than a month, said the relationship soured when
the Israeli couple ``tried to convince the Vasconceloses to abandon
the idea of taking Bruna home.''
   ``When they saw the Vasconceloses would not consider such a
proposition, they filed an appeal in the Supreme Court to postpone
Bruna's return. But the court turned them down,'' Souza said.
   Mrs. Vasconcelos said the Turgemans treated her daughter well.
``But the way they raised her was nothing special,'' she said.
``They didn't do anything I would not do.''

<TEXT>
   A novice nun abducted by her family from a
renegade Catholic convent says she wasn't kidnapped and doesn't
want to press charges, but a convent official accused the woman's
parents of ``brainwashing'' her.
   Mary Susan Greve, 22, also known as Sister Mary Cecilia,
voluntarily appeared at the Hamilton County Sheriff's Department
Thursday with her parents, James and Susan, and the family's lawyer.
   ``She expressed to us that she has no animosity or any bad
feeling toward members of her family or anyone else, and that she
is where she is (with her parents) because she wants to be where
she is,'' said Raymond Hulgin, chief of detectives.
   Misdemeanor charges have been filed in New York state against
four of her relatives for the alleged abduction Sunday. Police did
not arrest the family members because the charges are misdemeanors
from another state.
   Ms. Greve, a novice at St. Joseph Novitiate Convent for 20
months, was allegedly pushed into a waiting car by her brother
David as she walked with two nuns on a street near the convent in
Roundtop, N.Y.
   Hulgin said the parents told police they took their daughter
because they were upset by a lack of communication with the
convent, which calls itself a traditionalist Roman Catholic
convent. The sect holds services in Latin and rejects the liberal
teachings of the Second Vatican Council of the 1960s.
   The sect, called the Society of St. Pius V, split from the
recognized Catholic traditionalist Society of St. Pius X in 1983
over philosophical differences. The sect is not recognized by the
Roman Catholic Church.
   A tape of the local police interview with Ms. Greve has been
mailed to New York State Police, who will use it to decide whether
to drop charges, Hulgin said.
   Ms. Greve appeared to be clear-headed and comfortable during the
interview, Hulgin said.
   ``She seemed to be in total control of herself. She had no
reservations about speaking to us,'' he said. ``She was very
cooperative. She gave us no firm commitment as to what her future
intentions were.''
   Despite Ms. Greve's statement to police, the convent's spiritual
adviser, the Rev. Clarence Kelly, said Thursday he was not
convinced she was acting on her own.
   ``I would like to talk to her without her parents present to
determine in fact that she is acting according to her own free
will,'' Kelly said.
   ``There was no question about the force used in her abduction.
Now she is being held in captivity for a number of days. I'm afraid
they've subjected her to some type of brainwashing,'' he said.
   In April, the family took Ms. Greve from the convent for a
medical check-up, but a nun was waiting for them in Cincinnati and
persuaded Ms. Greve to return to the convent, said her brother John.

   A determined black bear with a sweet
tooth forced its way into a Petersburg home and helped itself to a
chocolate birthday cake, police said.
   It returned later for seconds.
   Nancy Curtis said nobody was at home Wednesday when the bear
clawed and pushed its way in through a back door of her house in
this town about 100 miles south of Juneau. When she returned, she
said she found her bird feeder knocked over and animal droppings
outside the door.
   Inside, a trash can had been knocked over and the cake, meant
for her daughter's 23rd birthday, was gone. So was the bear. It
left behind only the candles and plate.
   ``Actually, she said the bear was really nice in not tearing up
the house,'' said Police Officer Luke Cramer.
   The bear returned about midnight, and would not leave the area
outside the house, Curtis said. She called the police.
   ``I rolled up with my lights out, but the bear evidently heard
the vehicle pull in,'' Cramer said. ``The bear either heard me or
smelled me and split. It definitely came back for seconds.''

<TEXT>
   City officials have pulled the plug _
at least temporarily _ on two entrepreneurs who want to reintroduce
the electric rolling chair to Atlantic City's famed boardwalk.
   Antique wicker rolling chairs that now transport tourists down
the wooden way are pushed by hand for a fee. But Ernest English and
Stuart McGinnis discovered that mechanical chairs were popular
several decades ago, and want to restore them in an updated version.
   They recently bought all 100 dormant licenses for electrically
propelled rolling chairs from the city. Then they created a
prototype of a new chair _ a version that looks more like an
enlongated, covered golf cart than the wicker original.
   That's when the rolling chair war began.
   ``It's a power play,'' English said. ``Rolling chairs can earn
about $350 a day, so it's a money thing. I understand that over 40
people came in this week looking for electric chair licenses. We've
become a commodity that everyone wants.''
   Atlantic City's legal definition of a rolling chair, contained
in a 1950 ordinance, is a wheeled vehicle for hire for the
transportation of two or three people. A later ordinance restricts
their length to 88 inches, or slightly more than seven feet.
   The prototype electric chair introduced by English and McGinnis
is 10 feet long and seats five plus the driver.
   City officials pulled the partners' licenses Thursday, ordering
the new contraption off the boardwalk after only four days in
business. They plan to meet with the men next week.
   English, 30, and McGinnis, 31, acknowledge their cart is
controversial, and plan to redesign it to make it more conventional.

   Stock prices took a plunge today as the dollar
continued its climb against the Japanese yen in Tokyo.
   The dollar opened at 133.57 yen, up a strong 1.37 yen from the
previous day's closing. It rose rapidly to end the week at 134.50
yen, up 2.30 from Thursday's finish.
   The dollar closed today at its highest level since Nov. 27, when
it finished at 134.75 yen.
   It ranged between 133.55 and 134.60 yen today, with spot volume
estimated at $9.8 billion.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues, the market's main barometer, shed 265.87 points,
or 0.95 percent, closing at 27,503.53.
   The loss came after a rally of 371.31 points over the previous
two trading days.
   ``Share prices fell because the stock market was adjusting
itself to the weaker yen,'' said a broker with a major securities
firm who spoke on condition of anonymity. But he noted that
activity was very heavy, with 2.6 billion shares traded in the
first section.
   Volume was up from 2.5 billion shares traded on the first
section Thursday. Among the issues posting sharp losses were
steels, heavy industrials and electricals, the trader said. Also
losing ground were constructions, nonferrous metals and textiles.
   Low-priced issues, including trading houses and shippings, held
on to earlier gains, traders said.
   Foreign exchange dealers said the Tokyo market seemed to be
testing whether Japan's central bank would take any action to stem
the dollar's rise.
   ``Right now it is unclear how far the government is willing to
let the dollar go,'' said an exchange dealer with a major
commercial bank. ``But it is rumored that Finance Minister (Kiichi)
Miyazawa sees the 138-yen level as acceptable.''
   The trader, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said he did not
believe the Bank of Japan had stepped into the market today to stem
the yen's slide. The central bank does not comment officially on
its market interventions.
   Earlier this week, Japanese monetary authorities, including
Miyazawa, said the central bank would use market intervention if
necessary to brake the dollar's upswing.

<HEAD>AMA Approves Policy To Warn Sexual Partners Of AIDS Patients</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM C. HIDLAY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's largest group of doctors says
physicians, as a last resort, must breach their centuries-old
tradition of confidentiality by warning the sexual partners of
those infected with the AIDS virus.
   The move during Thursday's final session of the American Medical
Association convention was part of a package of tough policies for
battling the AIDS epidemic, including calls for mandatory testing
of prison inmates and expanded programs for intravenous drug users.
   ``This is a landmark in the history of medical ethics,'' said
Dr. James E. Davis, the new president of the AMA.
   ``We are saying for the first time that, because of the danger
to the public health and the danger to unknowing partners who may
be contaminated with this lethal disease, the physician may be
required to violate patient confidentiality.''
   However, another AMA official said the policy was not new.
   ``This is a restatement of a position the AMA has had for at
least a half a year, and possibly as long as a year,'' said Dr. M.
Roy Schwarz, chairman of the AMA's AIDS Task Force and the
association's assistant executive vice president for medical
education and science.
   The AMA's 420-member House of Delegates said Thursday that as
the first course of action, a physician should try to persuade a
patient infected with the AIDS virus to notify his sexual partners.
   If the patient refuses, the doctor should report him to the
local public health department so that health officials can warn
his sexual partners, a practice called contact tracing.
   ``And if that fails, the doctor should tell the people who are
at risk directly,'' said Schwarz.
   Although the tradition of doctor-patient confidentiality goes
back to the Hippocratic oath, Schwarz said, ``The landmark
decision, if there is one, is that this is the first time somebody
has called for contact tracing in every jurisdiction.''
   Dr. James Sammons, executive vice president of the
295,000-member medical association, said contact tracing ``at least
in the heterosexual community has the potential to substantially
reduce the proliferation and spread of AIDS.''
   Sammons said tracing had been effective at reducing other
sexually transmitted diseases, such as syphilis and gonorrhea.
   Dr. Don Chaplin, a delegate from Burlington, N.C., warned that
doctors must protect the identities of AIDS victims.
   ``I caution us to be very careful to do anything we can to
protect confidentiality and to fight any discrimination because it
would thwart our efforts to bring this disease under control,''
Chaplin said.
   The notification policy was attacked by a gay-rights group,
which said it could make AIDS patients or those who suspect they
have been exposed to the disease wary of seeking treatment,
according to a report in The New York Times.
   ``If patients feel doctors are going to rat on them, whether
they're homosexual or heterosexual, they're not going to go to
their doctors,'' said Thomas B. Stoddard, executive director of the
Lamda Legal Defense and Education Fund in New York.
   The AMA also said that in conjunction with the notification
policy, it would back legislation to grant immunity to doctors in
states with strict patient confidentiality laws.
   The AMA also called for mandatory AIDS testing of inmates
because of the problems of intravenous drug use and homosexuality
in prisons, practices that spread the disease.
   The AMA adopted a similar proposal last year and reaffirmed it
Thursday despite objections from several doctors that it would
accomplish little.
   The delegates also called on federal and state governments to
expand treatment programs for intravenous drug users because they
pose the greatest danger for the further spread of AIDS into the
heterosexual population.
   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome destroys the body's ability
to fight disease. It is fatal and incurable.
   Before adjourning its five-day convention, the delegates also
approved policies aimed at prohibiting athletes from using
steroids, posting health warnings on tanning booths, urging
airlines to ban smoking on all domestic flights and evaluating
whether health warnings should be required on alcoholic beverages.

   The state Senate defeated a bill to create
a holiday honoring slain civil rights leader Martin Luther King
Jr., a proposal that touched off widespread criticism of former
Gov. Evan Mecham when he opposed it.
   The King measure fell two votes short of the 16 needed in the
30-member, Republican-controlled Senate.
   Two Republicans who initially supported the bill, John Mawhinney
of Tucson and Carol Macdonald of Safford, voted against it Thursday
in what they said was a protest against heavy-handed efforts by
Democrats to force a vote on the issue.
   ``I don't vote for extortion,'' Mrs. Macdonald said.
   Tucson Democrat Jaime Gutierrez said he believed that they voted
against the bill because they both face tough re-election fights
and do not want to alienate conservatives.
   Democratic Gov. Rose Mofford had campaigned for the bill and
still could try to designate a holiday by executive proclamation.
But Republican Attorney General Bob Corbin has said such a move
would be illegal and could subject a governor who tried it to legal
costs.
   Then-Gov. Evan Mecham, a Republican, in 1987 cited Corbin's
advice when he rescinded such a proclamation made by Mecham's
predecessor, Democrat Bruce Babbitt, for a King holiday for state
executive branch workers.
   The move incited nationwide criticism of Mecham, who was
eventually impeached and removed from office on unrelated charges.
   Babbitt, a former attorney general himself, has insisted such a
proclamation is legal.
   Mrs. Mofford has repeatedly refused to say what she would do if
lawmakers did not enact the measure. Gubernatorial chief of staff
George Cunningham said after Thursday's vote that she was still
studying options that included calling lawmakers back into special
session on the measure or going ahead with a proclamation.
   Senate President Carl Kunasek had blocked the King measure from
coming to the floor all session, and Democrats demanded a chance to
vote on it as part of their price for supporting a tax bill needed
to help eliminate a projected budget shortfall.

   Eighty classical Chinese paintings dating back to
the 14th century will be exhibited in five U.S. cities next year to
mark the 10th anniversary of Sino-American diplomatic ties, an
official report said today.
   The English-language China Daily called the selection of
paintings the finest ever allowed to leave China. It said the works
are from China's last two dynasties, the Ming and Qing, which ruled
from 1368 until a republic was established in 1911.
   The paper said the paintings, borrowed from the Palace Museum in
Beijing's former imperial palace, will be shown first in January at
the Honolulu Academy of Arts in Hawaii.
   From there they will move to the High Museum of Art in Atlanta,
Georgia= the Cleveland Museum of Art in Cleveland, Ohio, the
Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City and a fifth undecided
city.
   The International Arts Council of the United States began
negotiations with the Palace Museum two years ago to hold the
exhibit, the paper said.
   The United States and People's Republic of China established
diplomatic relations on Jan. 1, 1979, ending 30 years of
estrangement.

   A blind man whose newsstand was mistakenly
leveled by sanitation workers got a replacement from the city: the
stand the crew was supposed to have knocked down.
   City officials had at first refused to replace Rosario Civello's
newsstand in his old spot, but Mayor Edward I. Koch intervened.
   ``Everyone makes mistakes, including those of us in
government,'' Koch said. ``The important thing is to right those
mistakes.''
   The accident occurred Tuesday night when the Sanitation
Department destroyed a newsstand that Civello, who is blind,
operated for more than a decade. The crew had been sent to tear
down an abandoned stand across the street.
   Koch said he ``ordered that the newsstand be rebuilt or replaced
and turned over to Mr. Civello immediately without cost to him.''
   ``It's a great thing,'' said Civello. ``I'm not bitter any
more.''

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev made an emotional plea for
his proposals to redistribute power in the Soviet Union,
emphasizing that political change is essential if his economic
reform is to succeed where similar attempts failed.
   He took the floor for the second time before 5,000 delegates at
the Communist Party conference he called to assess his reform
program.
   In his 40-minute speech Thursday, Gorbachev suggested that
Soviet socialism will die if his proposals to restore more real
power to local legislative councils are blocked.
   ``Society is waiting for it,'' he said. ``The whole of socialism
is waiting for it.''
   Soviet President Andrei A. Gromyko, criticized by some delegates
Thursday for having ``fallen behind the times,'' opened today's
session, Soviet television reported without giving details.
   Pollution was among the topics raised today. Fyodor Morgun, the
head of the Soviet Union's new environmental protection agency,
said the rush to build giant factories had destroyed fertile soil,
ruined forests, raised air pollution above healthly levels and
contaminated water supplies.
   ``Those who created these problems should be identified and give
their due,'' Morgun said. His remarks to the closed-door session of
the first party conference in 47 years, were carried by Tass, the
official news agency.
   Gorbachev's speech ate into the schedule of a conference where
only 47 delegates of 261 who asked for the floor have spoken.
Officials originally said the gathering would end today.
   Also breaking into the schedule was a conflict over the
reformist journal Ogonyok's allegations that certain delegates from
the Central Asian republic of Uzbekistan took bribes.
   Uzbekistan's party chief, in an apparent reference to the
magazine's editor, Vitaly Korotich, countered that demagogues are
operating ``under the cover of perestroika,'' the name Gorbachev
has given his plans for reform.
   Among those waiting to speak, an official said, is Boris N.
Yeltsin, ousted as party boss in Moscow last fall for criticizing
the slow pace of reform.
   A Moscow area delegate demanded Yeltsin be given the floor so
the conference could hear his views.
   In his speech Thursday, Gorbachev said that a call he made in
his first speech Tuesday for vesting real power in legislative
councils, known as soviets, had been misunderstood.
   ``We do not abandon the leading role of the ruling party in the
country,'' Gorbachev said. ``On the contrary, we emphasize it.''
   Gorbachev proposed Tuesday that local party heads should be
elected chairmen of the soviets in a secret ballot.
   The proposal seemed designed to ensure that the Communist Party
retains its traditional control over Soviet society, but operates
through a forum elected by the people rather than a government
executive body.
   Under the proposed reforms, party leaders ``of all ranks'' will
be selected in secret ballot, multicandidate elections.
   Gorbachev did not say if this would apply to his own post of
general secretary nor whether he would stand for the proposed new
post of president to be elected by a proposed 2,250-member Congress
of Deputies.
   In Thursday's speech, Gorbachev recalled how earlier economic
reforms in the 1950s and 1960s were ``swallowed up'' because there
was no accompanying political change.
   His ``perestroika'' could go the same way without political
reform, Gorbachev indicated.
   ``Doubt, lack of confidence, that would be the greatest gifts to
the opponents of perestroika,'' he said.
   ``Socialism, Lenin, that is the creative activity of the
masses,'' he said. ``But that activity will die unless we reform
the political system.''
   Earlier, Gorbachev broke into a speech by a delegate who said
people feel party stalwarts cannot work under Gorbachev's reforms
if they previously carried out the now-discredited policies of
Leonid I. Brezhnev, who died in 1982.
   ``Maybe you have some concrete suggestions?'' Gorbachev asked
delegate Vladimir Melnikov from his position on the dais. ``We're
sitting here and don't know: Is he talking about me, or somebody
else?''
   ``I was referring first of all to Comrade Solomentsev, and to
Comrades Gromyko, Afanasyev and Arbatov,'' replied Melnikov, head
of the party in the Komi region of Siberia.
   The exchange was shown on national television in an extremely
rare attack on named members of the ruling Politburo. Such
criticism has not surfaced despite the recent growing independence
of the Soviet press.
   Gromyko and another Politburo member, Mikhail S. Solomentsev,
have been members of the policy-making Central Committee since the
1960s. Georgy A. Arbatov, one of the Soviet Union's foremost
experts on American affairs, has headed the U.S.A. and Canada
Institute since 1967.
   There are at least two delegates with the surname Afanasyev. One
is Viktor G. Afanasyev, editor of the Communist Party daily Pravda
since 1976.

   The owners of Blitz, a prize bull, should
not be compensated for the bull's death or the loss of his valuable
semen, a jury has decided.
   Alvene and Emily Leinweber had sued Ed and Karen Hinnenkamp for
$150,000, claiming Blitz was fatally wounded in 1983 while
defending his herd against a trespassing Hereford owned by the
defendants.
   The Leinwebers claimed Blitz was the foundation of their
breeding business, Palouse Pinzgauer Breeders, 11 miles north of
Colfax. They said Blitz had to be put to sleep months after the
alleged fight, since he couldn't stand up long enough to have his
semen extracted.
   Blitz's semen cost about $20 a sample and was sold throughout
the United States, the Leinwebers said.
   The Hinnenkamps acknowledged their bull broke out of its pasture
and flirted with Blitz's cows, but denied it attacked Blitz.
   After an eight-day civil trial in Whitman County Superior Court,
jurors decided Wednesday the Hinnenkamps were not liable for their
Hereford's rambling, nor were they negligent for not preventing the
bull's activity.
   The decision came despite an earlier plea from the Leinwebers'
attorney, Linda Schauble-Ruff, to award damages.
   ``The Leinwebers are approaching their golden years and were
looking forward to the (financial) comfort Blitz could have given
them,'' she told jurors. ``But that can't happen now. They've got
only 800 units of semen left to hoard.''
   Gary Libey, the Hinnenkamp's attorney, said Blitz could have
died from accidents other than a fight. He suggested Blitz may have
simply over-exerted himself while mating, injuring both hind legs.

   Despite gloomy reports of drought damage
to the nation's breadbasket, the Midwest is far from a basket case
and the final impact of the dry spell remains unclear, experts say.
   ``People are ready to write the whole Midwest off,'' said Jerald
Barnard, director of the University of Iowa's Institute of Economic
Research. ``I think there's a reason to have some moderation in
this.
   ``We're not likely to see a disaster, on one side, and we're
also not likely to see the crops come through unscathed,'' he said
in a telephone interview Thursday from his Iowa City office.
   At Iowa State University in Ames, researchers at the Center for
Agricultural and Rural Development said that because of the great
variation in the drought's impact it could be disastrous for some
farmers and beneficial to others. It recommended any government
relief programs target assistance to just those farmers hurt by the
drought.
   ``Crop farmers who lose all or almost all of their crops will
suffer obvious losses,'' said William Meyers, the center's
associate director. ``Livestock producers are caught in a tight
squeeze _ higher feed and forage prices cause early marketings that
are reducing current livestock prices.
   ``However, farmers whose crops are less affected by the drought
will gain significantly from higher crop prices, as will those who
have grain in storage,'' said Meyers.
   Meanwhile, a Federal Reserve Bank analyst in Chicago backed away
from an earlier warning that the drought could cut short a recovery
by farm banks.
   ``Farmers look like they have some staying power. Farm bankers,
too,'' said George Gregorash, banking analysis officer of the Fed
of Chicago, who surveyed agricultural banks in Iowa, Wisconsin,
northern Illinois and northern Indiana.
   Just two weeks earlier, in preparing an annual review of Midwest
farm banks, Gregorash made a more dismal assessment, saying the
drought ``could make the 1987 gains short-lived.''
   But after surveying bankers this week, Gregorash said, ``The
news is fairly good.''
   All of the analysts say the drought's final impact remains
unknown and point to the huge fluctuations in commodity markets
each time rain falls in the Farm Belt or is even forecast as signs
of the uncertainty.
   ``Changing weather is likely to result in wide swings in prices
between now and harvest,'' said Stanley Johnson, director of the
center at ISU.
   ISU said the best that can be hoped for, through a shift to
ideal conditions for the rest of the growing season, is average
national corn yields dropping 15.6 percent to 100 bushels an acre,
soybeans dropping 9.1 percent to 30 bushels an acre and wheat
dropping 6 percent to 36 bushels an acre.
   Average normal yields are 118{ bushels an acre of corn, 33 of
soybeans and 38.3 of wheat, said research associate Patrick
Westhoff.
   The most severe forecast, comparable to a drought like that of
Dust Bowl days, would reduce corn yields by 40 percent, soybeans by
27 percent and wheat by about 15 percent.
   A moderate scenario, based on a slight intensifying of current
drought conditions, would fall midway between the best and worst
outlook and would reflect conditions as severe as any drought of
the past 25 years, Westhoff said.

<HEAD>Vietnamese Officer Describes Guerrilla Attacks in Cambodia</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Khmer Rouge guerrillas planted
explosives that injured 33 people in Cambodia's capital last year
and tried to blow up a strategic bridge there in 1984, a Vietnamese
army officer said today.
   Col. Dinh Nhu Ninh, commander of an elite unit assigned to
protect Phnom Penh, provided a rare disclosure of guerrilla
infiltrations.
   But he said the capital has been very secure since Vietnam
invaded Cambodia in late 1978 and set up a pro-Vietnamese
government. He dismissed the Khmer Rouge, the main guerrilla
infiltrators, as ``leftovers of an army that was beaten up and
became bandits.''
   Ninh said the last members of his unit, 1,200 men, returned home
on June 6 as part of Vietnam's plan to withdraw 50,000 troops, or
half its force in Cambodia, by the end of the year.
   Vietnam says its military command and all military advisers
returned home on Thursday, turning responsibility for the war over
to Cambodian officers.
   About 50,000 Cambodians, according to official count, turned out
on the streets of their capital as about 300 Vietnamese commanders
left Phnom Penh and flew to Ho Chi Minh City, formerly Saigon.
   Hanoi acknowledged it lost 25,000 men in the war, but most of
the fighting was away from the capital. Ninh said that no
Vietnamese soldiers had been killed in Phnom Penh since he took up
his post in January 1979. There were no major attacks on the city
and most intrusions were on its outskirts, he said.
   Vietnam's army rarely provides details of operations. The only
reports of guerrilla infiltration into Phnom Penh have come from
highly exaggerated Khmer Rouge claims or sketchy accounts from a
few Western aid officials.
   Fanatic Khmer Rouge communists killed millions of people when
they ruled Cambodia from 1975 until the Vietnamese invasion.
   Ninh spoke with foreign journalists invited to cover the
Vietnamese pullout.
   He said the worst period was from March 23 to July 20 last year
when Khmer Rouge agents planted 44 Chinese-made explosives on the
outskirts of the city. The plastic-covered bombs, about 4 inches in
diameter and 1{ inches wide, exploded when touched, he said.
   ``The intention was to scare people,'' he said. ``They laid the
explosives in the people's water tanks, bus terminals, staircases
of people's houses, or on the road.''
   Ninh said 33 people, all civilians, were wounded, including six
Vietnamese living in Cambodia.
   The leader of the saboteurs, a Khmer Rouge battalion commander,
was sentenced to death and another suspect, a Khmer Rouge
underground activist, sentenced to life imprisonment, Ninh said.
   Authorities also captured 15 others whom the Khmer Rouge had
paid $500 for each bomb they placed, he said. They received shorter
jail terms or were put in political ``re-education'' camps.
   He said the second most serious attack was the firing of two
H-12 rockets into the city on Dec. 27, 1986. Both crashed into
paddy fields, causing no injuries, and a Khmer Rouge operative who
launched the rockets was captured, he said.
   Ninh also said six Khmer Rouge operatives were caught in an
abortive plot to blow up the Son Ngoc bridge, the capital's
biggest, which links its eastern and western sectors. The plot was
organized in 1983 and explosives were to be planted in early 1984,
he said.
   Ninh said the chief plotter, Mon Ly, was sentenced to death and
the five others were given prison terms or probation.
   While Ninh said guerrilla-related incidents in Phnom Penh were
declining, he did not discount claims by diplomats that the Khmer
Rouge was lying low to prepare for attacks in 1990, when Vietnam
says its last soldiers will leave Cambodia.
   He said some Cambodians in Phnom Penh reacted to this year's
pullout with apprehension about the return of the Khmer Rouge.
   Ninh said guerrillas also conduct limited psychological warfare
in Phnom Penh, distributing handwritten leaflets saying ``that
Khmer (Cambodians) should not fight Khmer. The Khmer should fight
the Vietnamese.''
   The Vietnamese colonel said military intelligence indicated the
Khmer Rouge exaggerated its strength in referring to ``Division
18,'' the unit that was behind the 1986 rocket attack and the 1987
explosions.
   ``A division should have about 10,000 soldiers,'' he said. ``But
they have only 250 people and call themselves a division. Nonsense.
They don't have any strategy or tactics.''

   The Lawrence Livermore nuclear weapons
laboratory was shut down today after an electrical transformer blew
up in a fireball seen a mile away, touching off a series of
explosions and fires.
   The blasts and fires Thursday night at the laboratory, where
nuclear weapons are designed, followed a power outage that plunged
the 500-building complex into darkness, said laboratory spokeswoman
Sue Stephenson.
   There were no injuries reported and the three fires were put out
in about an hour, she said.
   Most of the damage took place at the lab's main switching
substation, a long metal structure.
   ``The windows were turned brown by the flames and firefighters
chopped holes in the roof,'' said Stephenson, who estimated damage
to the building at $250,000.
   The fires began when the main transformer in the switching
building exploded, sending an electrical surge into transformers at
the two other buildings, said Jay Davis, the lab's emergency duty
officer.
   The other explosions and fires were at power transmission boxes
outside two other buildings. Those fires also burned some nearby
bushes.
   Davis said that when the main transformer blew up, it sent up a
fireball that was visible from his home, about a mile away.
   The fires were all several blocks from the high-security
building where plutonium is stored and did not affect any section
of the lab where nuclear materials are kept, Stephenson said.
   ``They are safe and secure,'' she said.

   Mary Borunda declared her everlasting love
for her husband Joe in a newspaper wedding anniversary
advertisement, but police say it was a love as thin as the paper it
was printed on.
   The same day the newspaper ran her ``happy fourth anniversary''
ad, it also reported that Mrs. Borunda was charged with soliciting
a gunman to shoot her husband.
   Mrs. Borunda already had paid the gunman $1,000 and was to
provide an additional $1,500 after her husband was killed during
what was to have been a staged house break-in, Detective Dan
Hulbert said Thursday.
   She was arrested Saturday on a tip provided by a relative,
Hulbert said.
   ``Then we see this happy ad in the (Joliet) Herald-News,'' said
Hulbert. ``It's getting to the point where I just don't know about
things any more.''
   The ad read: ``Happy fourth anniversary 6@29@88 to my wonderful
husband Joe Borunda. I'll love you always. Your wife Mary.''
   In the same Wednesday edition, the newspaper reported that Mrs.
Borunda, 44, was charged Tuesday with a single count of
solicitation to commit murder.
   She has entered a plea of innocent and is free on $1,000 bond
posted by her husband pending a July 11 court hearing.
   ``And he turns around and bonds her out, anyway,'' said Hulbert.
``Go figure.''
   Joe Borunda, 59, who is the woman's fifth husband, told police
he had several life insurance policies worth well over $100,000,
Hulbert said.
   ``That's the only motive we've determined so far,'' Hulbert said.
   Mrs. Borunda allegedly contacted one relative who declined to
help her find a gunman, then contacted a second relative who put
her in touch with someone willing to carry out the murder, Hulbert
said.
   ``The first relative was the one who tipped us,'' said Hulbert.
   Cliff Richards, an advertising manager for the newspaper, said
the advertisement was phoned in, making it impossible to confirm
whether Mrs. Borunda actually placed it.
   ``But the bill is going to her,'' said Richards. ``That's the
name and address given by the person who called.''

   Portugal has expelled the U.S. naval
attache to Portugal for photographing an Iranian ship loading cargo
in a Portuguese port, a published report said today. The U.S.
Embassy denied the report.
   The weekly Independent newspaper quoted unidentified sources as
saying the attache, Capt. William Barney, left Lisbon on Wednesday.
   But U.S. Embassy spokeswoman My Chau Bui-Griffin said Barney
left Lisbon in early May following routine transfer orders from
Washington.
   She said he had served as naval attache in Lisbon since March
1985.
   Mrs. Bui-Griffin declined to comment on the allegations reported
by the Independent. She said it was not U.S. Embassy policy to
comment on individual newspaper reports.
   The Portuguese Foreign Ministry and the prime minister's office
said no one was immediately available to comment.
   The paper said the attache at first said he was a journalist
when challenged by port authorities as he allegedly photographed
the Iranian ship at Setubal, south of Lisbon.
   Photographing state-owned installations is an offense in
Portugal in some circumstances.
   He later admitted he was a diplomat after being taken to a
Portuguese naval base for questioning, according to the report.
   It said Barney was recognized by several Portuguese naval
officers at the base.
   Portuguese state-owned companies sell arms to both Iran and its
enemy Iraq, and the weapons are loaded at the port of Setubal. The
newspaper did not say whether the cargo Barney reportedly
photographed included arms.
   The Indepdendent said Barney left Lisbon after Foreign Minister
Joao de Deus Pinheiro summoned U.S. ambassador Edward Rowell and
informed him of the Lisbon government decision to expel the
diplomat.
   The report gave no further details.

   Thunderstorms whipped through several Midwestern and Western
states today, bringing fierce rain and wind that ripped down trees,
overturned trailers and soaked areas from eastern New Mexico to
western Missouri.
   The storm produced severe weather in Oklahoma Thursday night as
winds downed large tree limbs west of Burlington. Winds roared to
60 mph at Rock, Kan., and dime-size hail fell northeast of Harper.
   In Arizona, winds gusted to 64 mph in Phoenix and hurled a tree
through a house as strong thunderstorm winds overturned trailers at
Black Canyon.
   Rain deluged parts of southern Florida _ more than 2 inches were
recorded in Key West and more than an inch in West Palm Beach.
Wichita, Kan., also received more than an inch of rain.
   Meanwhile, fog blanketed several areas in Georgia, South
Carolina and eastern Tennessee.
   Today's forecast called for widespread showers and thunderstorms
from the central and southern Plains through the lower Missouri
Valley, Arkansas and the central Gulf Coast into the southern
Atlantic coast and Florida; numerous thunderstorms from extreme
southeast Kansas into central and eastern Oklahoma; scattered
showers throughout much of New England, most numerous through
northern Vermont and New Hampshire into Maine; sunny skies remained
over the rest of the nation.
   High temperatures were forecast in the 70s or 80s across much of
the nation; in the 90s through much of the Great Basin and central
inter-mountain region, extended across Texas and the Gulf of Mexico
coast into Florida; in the 60s in the northeast states with 50s
expected for much of Maine; around 100 degrees across the Rio
Grande Valley of Texas; and between 100 and 110 degrees from the
valleys of interior California into the desert Southwest.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 38
degrees at Marquette, Mich., to 89 degrees at Phoenix, Ariz., and
Las Vegas, Nev.

   A shoplifter with a long history of
thefts was sentenced to 24 years in prison by a judge who told her,
``You're always going to be a thief.''
   Shirley York Doby, 35, of Little Rock was sentenced as a
habitual felon with seven prior theft-related convictions. Pulaski
County Circuit Judge Floyd J. Lofton cited a ``rap sheet as long as
my arm'' in justifying the sentence.
   ``You're just a thief, you're a habitual thief, you're always
going to be a thief, and there's nothing we can do about it,''
Lofton told Doby before sentencing. ``I intend to send you to
prison for as long as I can.''
   Lofton sentenced her to 24 years in prison on a charge of theft
of property, for which he had found her guilty at a non-jury trial
June 14.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar rose in early European trading today
after reaching a seven-month high in earlier trading in Tokyo. Gold
prices rose slightly.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends as Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 2.30 yen to close the week at 134.50 yen, the
dollar's highest level since Nov. 27 when it closed at 134.75 yen.
Later, in London, it was quoted at 134.05 yen.
   Foreign exchange dealers said the Tokyo market seemed to be
testing whether the Bank of Japan central bank would intervene to
stop the dollar's rise.
   ``Right now it is unclear how far the government is willing to
let the dollar go,'' said an exchange dealer with a major
commercial bank in Japan.
   ``But it is rumored that Finance Minister (Kiichi) Miyazawa sees
the 138-yen level as acceptable.''
   In Europe, the dollar slipped from its Asian peaks amid reported
dollar sales by the West German central bank, but was still above
its late Thursday level.
   In London, the British pound slid to its lowest level against
the dollar this year, trading as low as $1.69. At midmorning it was
quoted at $1.7023, the lowest level since last September, and
cheaper than $1.7085 Thursday.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Thursday:
   _1.8210 West German marks, up from 1.8170
   _1.5120 Swiss francs, up from 1.5060
   _6.1347 French francs, up from 6.1250
   _2.0555 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0530
   _1,351.25 Italian lire, up from 1,350.38
   _1.2172 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2126
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $435.90 an ounce, little
changed from late Thursday's $436.40. At midmorning, the city's
five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $436.50.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $436.75, compared with $436.50 late
Thursday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose 82 cents to close at a bid
$440.00.
   Silver was quoted in London today at a bid price of $6.68 a troy
ounce, up from Thursday's $6.66.

   Soviet authorities allowed 1,470 Jews to leave in
June, the sixth straight rise in the monthly emigration total, a
resettlement agency said today.
   It was the highest number of Jews allowed out of the Soviet
Union since June 1980 when 1,767 left the country, according to
figures published by the Intergovernmental Committee for Migration.
   In May, 1,145 Jews left the Soviet Union.
   A total of 6,017 have emigrated this year, which compares with
8,011 for all of 1987, the agency said.
   Only 127 of the June arrivals at its Vienna transit center went
to Israel, bringing to 840 the number who chose the Jewish state
this year, agency spokesman Regina Boucault said.

<HEAD>Lawmaker Again Attacks Premier</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A lawmaker belonging to the ruling
Nationalist Party charged today that a Cabinet official sought to
protect Premier Yu Kuo-hwa by covering up a bribe attempt.
   The allegation was the latest in a series of accusations
launched against Yu by lawmaker Wu Yung-hsiung.
   Next week, the Nationalist Party will hold a key party congress
during which the premier's conservative policies may come under
attack by younger politicians.
   Opinion polls indicate Yu, 74, is not as popular as other Taiwan
leaders, and some Nationalist lawmakers have called for his
resignation.
   Wu claimed that Wang Chang-ching, secretary general of the
Cabinet, was ordered to bribe him on Yu's behalf.
   The lawmaker claimed Tuesday that Yu told Wang to pay $11,360 to
silence Wu from attacking the premier during sessions of the
Legislative Yuan, Taiwan's highest lawmaking body.
   Wu has repeatedly accused Yu of having an affair with a
prostitute, but has failed to provide details other than a woman's
name. Yu has denied the allegation.
   Wang has denied that the money he paid Wu was a bribe. He said
the cash was a personal gift to help finance the lawmaker's trip to
visit labor welfare programs in Japan and the United States.
   Newspapers have reported that Wu's accusation has embarrassed
Yu's supporters as well as his opponents, who fear that the
allegations may be interpreted as part of a plot to force Yu to
step down.
   Today, Wu displayed a bundle of cash he claimed was handed to
him by Wang in April. He said he repaid the money Tuesday by check,
but did not make clear why he had waited two months.
   Wu said he used his own money for the trip to Japan and the
United States.
   The lawmaker refused to answer questions today as he left the
Legislative Yuan, other than to deny that his accusations were part
of a plot to topple Yu.
   Yu said at a weekly Cabinet meeting Thursday that he was not
aware of Wang's payment to Wu.

   Workers at eight cemeteries ratified a
new contract, ending a monthlong strike that forced funeral parlors
to store hundreds of bodies awaiting burial, but a strike continued
at nine other cemeteries.
   The 71 Eastbay members of Cemetery Workers and Greens Attendants
Local 265 approved the pact Thursday and were scheduled to return
to work today, union officials said.
   The settlement does not affect a strike by workers at nine
cemeteries on the San Francisco Peninsula who also walked off the
job May 30. There are no talks scheduled in that dispute, which
involves about 87 workers.
   No details of the Eastbay settlement were immediately available.
The major issue that prompted the strike was the cemetery owners'
use of contract workers to do jobs that Local 265 officials said
should be performed by union members.
   The striking workers included gravediggers, gardeners and
maintenance personnel.
   Cemetery owners attorney John Cantwell said he was unsure how
many burials have been delayed by the strike. In 1985, a six-week
strike by the same union local resulted in more than 800 bodies
going unburied during the walkout.

   Officials today denied Western reports that
police killed several peasants and brutally beat others who tried
to stop the release of polluted water from a reservoir near Beijing.
   The official Xinhua News Agency late Thursday issued the first
official report of the June 21 protest during which peasants tried
to stop a petrochemical company from releasing contaminated waste
water from a reservoir into a local stream.
   The peasants said the water would poison their wells and crops.
Officials said the water level in the reservoir had risen too high
and that there was danger of flooding.
   Wang Zuoseng, local Communist Party secretary, criticized
foreign reporting of the protest and accused Western reporters of
violating government regulations this week when they visited the
reservoir in Guce village.
   Authorities there turned away some Western reporters this week
and confiscated film and audio tapes.
   Guce, which is under the Beijing municipal administration, is 37
miles southwest of the city center.
   Wang cited the same regulation that was used last October to
expel 14 Western reporters from Tibet following violent
pro-independence, anti-Chinese riots by Tibetans in Lhasa.
   The regulation requires foreign reporters to apply for
permission when traveling to report in areas open to foreigners.
Reporters previously had interpreted it to apply to places outside
Beijing, and officials have never before invoked it in greater
Beijing.
   The new interpretation would significantly widen the scope of
the regulation and severely limit foreign reporting in China.
   At today's news conference, Wang said the July 21 protest was
much smaller than peasant witnesses have said. He denied witness
accounts that thousands of armed police were brought in and scores
of peasants were badly hurt.
   Villagers told The Associated Press on Thursday that more than
1,500 farmers clashed with at least 2,000 armed police, and 60 to
70 protestors were seriously injured when police beat them with
nightsticks and used electric cattle prods.
   Some villagers told Western reporters that three people were
killed, but those who spoke to the AP said they could not confirm
any deaths.
   ``What you're talking about is what a small number of people are
saying. I was at the site. I can assure you that there were no more
than 500 farmers,'' Wang said. He said about 200 unarmed local
police were at the scene.
   He denied that anyone was killed or seriously injured, but said
some people might have been slightly hurt during the scuffle.
   Villagers also said 150 people were arrested the day of the
protest, and that 10 remained in custody, but Wang said only five
people were being interrogated. He said they have not been formally
arrested or charged.
   He did not say if others had been detained and released.
   The waste stored in the Niukou Reservoir came from the
state-owned Yanshan Petrochemical Co. Wang said it was produced
after the plant dismantled its old waste treatment equipment and
before it had installed new equipment.
   Wang said he did not know what chemicals were in the water or
what affect they could have on human health and crops.
   By mid-June, the water in the reservoir had risen to a dangerous
level and had to be released to avoid flooding, he said. Beijing is
having its annual rainy season.
   Wang said the petrochemical company will compensate the farmers
for all losses they suffer in their summer wheat harvest and for 60
percent of losses of their autumn grain crop.

   Forty-three years after he died in
self-imposed exile in New York, the remains of composer Bela Bartok
are on the way to reburial in his native Hungary.
   The remains left England today on the second stage of their
journey. The liner Queen Elizabeth 2, which brought the remains
here from the United States on Thursday, set sail at 11:33 a.m. for
Cherbourg, France, and was expected to arrive there seven hours
later.
   In Cherbourg, the brown-painted, sealed wooden box will be put
on a train to begin a slow, five-day journey through France, West
Germany and Austria.
   Memorial concerts were scheduled today in Cherbourg and Sunday
in Munich, and the body was to lie in state Monday in Vienna before
the ceremonial state burial in Budapest next Thursday.
   ``Bela Bartok was one of the greatest musical figures this
century ... His genius has enhanced the reputation of Hungarian
culture throughout the world,'' British Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher said at a memorial concert Thursday night at Southampton
University.
   Bartok gave 50 piano performances in Britain between 1904 and
1938. He died in 1945 at age 64 in the United States, having quit
his homeland in disgust at the government's close ties with Nazi
Germany.
   ``We have no doubt that he belongs to Hungary,'' the composer's
son, Peter, 64, of Homosassa, Fla., told the concert audience.
Attending were David Mellor, Foreign Office minister of state
representing the British govrnment, and Hungarian Ambassador Matyas
Domokos.
   Peter Bartok and his brother Bela Bartok Jr., 78, who lives in
Budapest, the Hungarian capital, are accompanying their father's
remains from New York to Hungary.
   ``It was difficult for a long time for us to accept that his
grave should be disturbed, but finally we knew if we did not, the
opportunity to go home with our father won't always exist, and the
thought of not going with him we could not accept,'' Peter said.
   Two works of Bartok were performed at the concert.
   Violinist Gyorgy Pauk and pianist Peter Frankl, both
Budapest-born and living in Britain, presented the Sonata No.2 for
violin and piano, and Britain's Lindsay String Quartet played the
String Quartet No. 6.
   Quartet violinist Ronald Birks, asked later if Bartok's music is
difficult to play, replied: ``Very _ you have to know it.''
   On the platform was a painting of Bartok and violinist Yehudi
Menuhin, for whom the composer wrote his Sonata for Solo Violin in
1943.
   Hungarian artist Zsuzsi Roboz, a British resident, presented her
picture to the Bartok brothers for their father's old home in
Budapest, now a memorial museum.
   Peter Bartok said his father's bones were in the simple,
zinc-lined box that rested on the Queen Elizabeth 2 overnight and
that the box would be buried as it was.
   ``We thought of having an elaborate casket but the thought of
all the disturbance was repugnant to my brother and I,'' he said.
   He said ``someone cheated'' the family and the American Society
of Composers, Authors and Publishers, which arranged the funeral in
1945.
   ``We ordered a steel coffin because we were all sure that our
father would one day go home. But when we exhumed him in Ferncliff
cemetery (June 22) we found the coffin was wood which had
disintegrated,'' the younger brother said.

<HEAD>Report: Ford Offers Settlement In Fatal Church Bus Crash</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ford Motor Co. has offered out-of-court
settlements of less than $1 million to each of the families of the
24 children killed in a fiery May 14 church bus crash, a newspaper
reported today.
   Ford, which made the bus chassis, also offered payments to the
estates of the three adults who died in the accident near
Carrollton, and to the 40 survivors, based on the severity of their
injuries, The Courier-Journal reported today, attributing the
information to unidentified lawyers.
   Ford spokesman Robert Waite told the newspaper that ``delicate''
negotiations were under way, but would not comment on whether a
settlement had been offered.
   Lawyer Michael Hance, who represents the families of two of the
dead children, said a settlement was being offered by Ford and all
manufacturers responsible for producing the bus, including Sheller
Globe Corp. of Toledo, Ohio, which assembled it.
   Hance declined to disclose the size of the offers, but described
them as ``attractive financially'' to the families and also a good
deal for Ford.
   Sheller Globe's spokesman did not return phone calls seeking
comment, the newspaper reported.
   Lawyer Don Skeeters, a spokesman for the Radcliff firm of
Skeeters & Bennett, which is representing most of the remaining
plaintiffs, refused to confirm or deny that an offer had been made.
   Lawyers who have handled similar cases told the Courier-Journal
it would be highly unusual, if not unprecedented, for such a major
case to be settled so quickly, before lawsuits were even filed.
   Washington lawyer John Coale, who represents one family and has
been active in several air-disaster cases, said it would be
``unconscionable'' to settle so quickly without exploring whether
Ford might be liable for punitive damages. He predicted the cases
might be worth as much as $120 million.
   Coale, who represents the parents of Shannon Fair, who was
killed in the crash, said his client intended to take Ford to trial
even if all other plaintiffs settle out of court, although he
acknowledged it would be difficult for one client to finance such a
battle.
   Hance said he would present the bus makers' proposal today to
his clients, the parents of Patty Nunnallee and Sandy Brewer. In
Hance's view, the families must decide between accepting the
offers, which he called ``a sure thing,'' or the ``reality of
fighting one of the largest corporations in the nation for four or
five years.''
   While he described the offers as attractive, he said Ford might
be forced to pay $60 million to $70 million for compensatory
damages alone if the case is tried. The total value of the proposed
settlement offer is ``nowhere close to that,'' he said.
   Hance also said his clients, whom he described as more
interested in bus-safety reforms than money, also might refuse to
accept Ford's stipulation that settlement values be kept secret.
   The converted school bus, owned by the Radcliff First Assembly
of God Church, was returning 67 people _ mostly children _ to the
church after a day at the Kings Island amusement park near
Cincinnati. Police say the accident was caused by a drunken driver
traveling the wrong way on Interstate 71.
   However, investigators have said other factors combined to
increase the loss of life, including the bus' lone rear exit door
and crowded conditions inside.
   Authorities also cited the bus' gas tank, which ruptured and
burst into flames. The resulting smoke was blamed for all 27 deaths.
   The bus was apparently one of the last manufactured in 1977
before a new federal rule required bus fuel tanks be sheathed in
protective cages.

   Iraq's foreign minister today
acknowledged that his country had used chemical weapons in its war
with Iran.
   Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz was asked at a news conference about
Iranian allegations that Iraq had used the deadly weapons against
its Persian Gulf War foe.
   ``The U.N. report says both sides have used them. Iran started
its use. We were victims many times, since the early beginning of
the conflict,'' Aziz said.
   Asked whether both his country and Iran had used such weapons,
he replied: ``Both sides.''
   It was the first direct admission by Iraq that it has used
chemical weapons in its war with Iran.
   The United Nations Security Council has condemned the use of
chemical weapons in the Iran-Iraq war, and their general use is
outlawed by international agreement.
   On April 25, U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar said
there was evidence that both sides were using chemical weapons in
the 7{-year-old war.
   The U.N. chief had sent a physician from Geneva to visit both
Iran and Iraq and examine victims of alleged chemical attacks.
   Aziz repeated assertions that Iran started the war by invading
Iraq and that his country had the right to choose the means for its
defense.
   ``Every nation has the right to protect itself against
invasion,'' Aziz said.
   Aziz defended his country's use of chemical weapons in the war,
saying Iran was a ``great threat'' to Iraq.
   ``There are different views on this matter from different
angles. You are living on a civilized continent. You are living on
a peaceful continent,'' Aziz told Western reporters.
   Iran claims Iraq killed 5,000 people, mostly Iraqi Kurds, in a
mustard gas and cyanide attack on the Iranian-held Halabja
territory of Iraq in March.
   Iraq did not deny the charge then and said it would use all
necessary means to repel Iranian forces. It also accused Iran of
using chemical weapons.
   Aziz accused Iran of not only using chemical weapons, but also
of violating international accords on the treatment of war
prisoners.
   ``Lately 7,000 Iraqi prisoners of war disappeared. We don't yet
know what their destiny is,'' said Aziz.
   ``When we want peace, we have to respect all conventions. But
you cannot say I'm going to respect all these conventions and give
the other side the liberty not to respect them,'' he added.
   Aziz did not say when Iraq last used chemical weapons in its war
with Iran.
   Aziz also said that Iraq's recent war successes do not mean that
his country has changed its position of wanting to find a peaceful
solution to the conflict.
   On May 9, the U.N. Security Council condemned the use of
chemical weapons in the Iran-Iraq war and called on both sides to
refrain from future use of the weapons.
   Iran has pushed for Security Council condemnation of Iraq for
using chemical weapons. Diplomats said Iran was displeased that the
resolution did not single out Iraq.

   Procedures to warn the sex or drug-sharing
partners of people infected with AIDS virus are now under way in
every state, according to a new report from the national Centers
for Disease Control.
   The CDC reported Thursday that all 50 states encourage partner
notification, through programs by which infected people are urged
to inform partners with whom they have had sex or shared needles.
   Forty-eight states have in place ``referral on request''
programs to inform partners when an AIDS-infected patient asks them
to. The other two _ Georgia and Nebraska _ have programs to inform
partners in certain case, such as women of childbearing age or rape
victims.
   In addition, a Georgia law going into effect today specifies
that health authorities may contact spouses, sex partners or other
parties for disclosure purposes after first trying to inform the
patient that they plan to do so.
   AIDS, caused by a virus, is transmitted chiefly through sex or
contaminated drug needles. Partner notification, the CDC noted, has
been a key part of efforts to fight sexually transmitted diseases
since the advent of penicillin to treat syphilis in the 1940s.
   The CDC recommends that AIDS-infected people ``should be
instructed in how to notify their partners and to refer them for
counseling and testing.'' The agency also recommends that if
infected people cannot or will not get their partners to seek
counseling, ``physicians or health department personnel should use
confidential procedures to assure that the partners are notified.''
   ``All the states are giving counseling to patients about the
need to inform their sex partners and needle-sharing partners,''
said Dr. Kathleen Toomey, a CDC researcher.
   Having a third party notify people at risk ``has been shown to
be effective, but costly,'' the CDC said in its weekly report.
Because of limits on money and other resources, having patients
inform their own partners ``has played an increasingly important
role.''
   In four of the states offering outside notification of sex or
drug partners _ Colorado, Idaho, South Carolina and Virginia _ the
percentage of partners identified through the programs who agreed
to AIDS tests and showed signs of infection ranged from 14 to 39
percent, Ms. Toomey said.
   ``By identifying such individuals, the partner-notification
process can target risk-reduction messages to those at greatest
risk of acquiring or transmitting infection,'' the CDC said.
   More than 65,000 AIDS cases have been reported in the United
States; 88 percent have occurred among homosexual males or
injectible drug abusers, according to the CDC. More than 37,000
patients have already died.

<HEAD>Suspected Kidnapper Says He Planned Abduction For Months</HEAD>

   The suspect in the country's only
known fatal kidnap case said today he picked his victim, a Dutch
tycoon, at random and then spent two months planning the abduction.
   Ferdi Elsas, 45, said at his trial here that he began mapping
out the abduction of grocery baron Gerrit-Jan Heijn in July 1987.
Heijn was kidnapped Sept. 9, and his body was found April 4.
   Elsas said he chose his victim at random. His lawyer, Johannes
Weermeijer, told The Associated Press that Elsas ``knew Mr. Heijn
from the telephone directory.''
   There was no immediate word on the motive for the abduction.
Heijn's relatives paid $8 million ransom.
   The only other testimony scheduled to be given was that of a
forensic psychiatrist who has examined the suspect extensively.
Under Dutch trial practice, the hearing of witnesses is unusual.
   Elsas has confessed that he abducted and killed Heijn. If found
guilty, he could be sentenced to life in prison.
   Local press reports indicated that the psychiatric report
claimed that at the time of the abduction, Elsas bore only
``limited responsibility'' for his deeds.
   If the court accepted that claim, it could impose a limited jail
sentence followed by confinement in an institution for the
criminally insane.
   The soft-spoken Elsas is an unemployed business consultant with
an engineering degree from a Dutch university.
   Elsas told court president Ms. C.A. Terwee-Van Holten that he
shot and killed Heijn on the day of his kidnapping in a forest near
Renkum, in the eastern Netherlands.
   Heijn, vice president of the multimillion-dollar Ahold retail
concern, was abducted from his sprawling villa in Bloemendaal, one
of Haarlem's affluent suburbs, while on his way to a dental
appointment.
   On April 4, Heijn's body was dug up from a forest in the eastern
Netherlands after police arrested Elsas.
   Their arrest came after a bank employee discovered a 250-gilder
note from the ransom payment.

<HEAD>Soviets Arriving Tonight to Begin Missile Inspections</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Five Soviet teams will arrive in San Francisco
tonight to begin inspections intended to verify compliance with the
U.S.-Soviet medium-range missile treaty.
   The Soviet government notified the United States early today
that the five teams will land in San Francisco at 8 p.m. PDT, said
Kendall Pease, a spokesman for the U.S. agency working with the
Soviets.
   Under the treaty, the Soviets need not list the sites they want
to visit until they have been in the United States 48 hours, Pease
said.
   Other Soviets inspectors will inspect sites in the eastern
United States, but their arrival time has not been relayed to the
United States, Pease said.
   The United States annouced Thursday that a U.S. team would
arrive in Moscow this afternoon to begin inspections of Soviet
facilities.
   The teams have 60 days to carry out the ``baseline
inspections,'' designed to verify the exact number of missiles and
related components to be destroyed under the Intermediate-range
Nuclear Forces treaty signed at the Washington summit Dec. 9.
   The U.S. team will be headed by Brig. Gen. Roland Lajoie, chief
of the On-Site Inspection Agency.
   Under the terms of the treaty, the two sides must give each
other 16 hours' notice of their intent to make an inspection. The
U.S. team had not given notice of the exact sites to be inspected,
preferring to wait as late as possible, Pease said.
   In addition to the short-notice spot inspections, the INF treaty
allows the Soviets to station up to 30 inspectors for the next 13
years in Magna, Utah, site of Hercules Plant No. 1, where
medium-range American missiles were produced.
   The U.S. government, in turn, has the right to station
inspectors near a Soviet missile-producing site, the Votkinsk
Machine Building Plant.
   The treaty, the first to allow such on-site inspection, is
viewed as a trial for the proposed Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty,
which would slash arsenals of long-range superpower nuclear weapons
by 30-50 percent, and involve much more complicated verification
procedures.

   Roman Catholic bishops are urging supporters
of excommunicated traditionalist Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre to
affirm their loyalty to the pope and remain united with the church.
   On Thursday in Econe, Switzerland, Lefebvre defied the Vatican
and consecrated four bishops of his St. Pius X Fraternity,
declaring that the church had become corrupted with modernism.
   The Vatican denounced the rebel prelate for provoking the first
schism in 118 years and declared Lefebvre and the bishops expelled
from the church.
   The Vatican will announce its position on the priests and lay
supporters of Lefebvre in the coming days, Vatican spokesman
Joaquin Navarro said today. Under church doctrine, Lefebvre will
always be a bishop since he was appointed as a successor to the
Apostles, said a Vatican official.
   Navarro has estimated Lefebvre's supporters at 80,000 to
100,000. But other Vatican officials say around half a million
people turn to his priests for various church functions, and
Lefebvre says he has millions of sympathizers.
   ``Those who are sympathetic to Archbishop Lefebvre and may have
found it almost impossible to accept the renewal of the church life
endorsed by the Second Vatican Council are now faced with a painful
choice,'' said Cardinal Basil Hume, the archbishop of Westminister.
   ``I would urge them to reaffirm their loyalty to the successor
of St. Peter and to remain within the unity of the Catholic
Church,'' he said. ``To continue in support of the archbishop and
to worship with the fraternity of St. Pius X is to leave the
Catholic Church.''
   Vatican officials were visibly angered by the consecrations. A
concert scheduled Thursday evening at the Vatican was canceled to
express ``deep pain'' over the schism.
   Lefebvre rejected a last-minute appeal by Pope John Paul II
before elevating the bishops. Less than two hours later, the
Vatican said the five had excommunicated themselves by defying
papal authority.
   An excommunicated Roman Catholic is unable to receive the
church's sacraments, which include the eucharist and last rites,
also known as the sacrament of the sick.
   A Vatican statement said the consecrations were a ``formally
schismatic act.'' A schism is a formal rupture with the Vatican.
   Lefebvre's act provoked the first major split in the church
since the Old Catholics broke with the Vatican after the First
Vatican Council proclaimed the doctrine of papal infallibility in
1870.
   The Vatican identified those excommunicated as Lefebvre and the
four bishops: Bernard Fellay, Bernard Tissier de Mallerais, Richard
Williamson and Alfonso de Galarreta.
   Reports from Econe said Brazilian prelate Antonio de Castro
Mayer, bishop of Campos, assisted at the rites and also faced
excommunication. But Navarro said the Vatican was awaiting
clarification on his role in the ceremony.
   Lefebvre, an 82-year-old Frenchman, called the sanctions ``null
and void'' and told his supporters not to pay any attention to
them. He said canon law permits his actions ``in a state of
emergency.''
   He contended in his homily that the Vatican, not he, was on a
``schismatic course'' because it accepted ``errors once condemned''
that were leading to the destruction of the church.
   Lefebvre and his followers reject many of the modernizing
reforms of the Second Vatican Council of 1962-65, including
openings to other religions and Christian denominations.
   Interviewed at random, people in Lefebvre's audience, estimated
by organizers at almost 10,000, all said the sanctions left them
unshaken in their loyalty to the tradionalist faith.
   But the Vatican expects that many will have second thoughts.
Appeals are being readied by the Swiss, French, and West German
conferences of bishops, exhorting Lefebvre's followers to reject a
man who now is barred from receiving the sacraments.
   The Italian Episcopal Conference issued a statement expressing
its sorrow and saying the bishops and the church in Italy shared in
the suffering of the pope.
   But public opinion polls conducted in France and West Germany in
the past few years seem to support Lefebvre's claim that the
tradionalist movement has millions of sympathizers. Most favor
restoration of the 16th Tridentine Mass in Latin which was replaced
by the Mass in local modern languages, termed by Lefebvre a
``bastard rite.''
   Despite a ban issued 12 years ago that suspended him from his
priestly functions, Lefebvre has ordained 220 priests who are
officiating in 28 countries. He likes to compare the growth with
the decline in ordinations in the official church.
   The fraternity has seminaries in Switzerland, France, West
Germany, the United States and Argentina, with more being planned
in Gabon, Australia and Mexico. It claims to have chapels or
centers throughout the world, including a floating chapel anchored
in the Netherlands.

   A Palestinian woman died today from a bullet
wound she sustained six weeks ago when Israeli soldiers raided her
village in the occupied West Bank, hospital officials said.
   Fatima Kassem, 24, was shot in the head during a May 18 army
raid on the mountain village of Abwein, officials at Jerusalem's
Mukassad Hospital said.
   Her death brought to 214 the number of Palestinians killed since
the Arab uprising began Dec. 8. Four Israelis also have been killed.
   Also today, Arab hospital officials rejected army claims that
Mohammed Shabello, a 36-year-old street vendor from the West Bank
city of Nablus, died of a heart attack unrelated to a clash with
troops.
   Hospital officials said Shabello died minutes after inhaling
tear gas hurled by troops to subdue stone-throwing demonstrators in
Nablus on Thursday.
   Shabello's death, which was not included in the fatality count,
touched off a violent protest at the man's funeral Thursday, and
Israeli troops wounded one Arab during the clashes.
   Palestinian protesters are challenging Israel's rule in the
occupied territories and Arab east Jerusalem, which the Israelis
seized in the 1967 Middle East War.
   Israel's Supreme Court, in a ruling published today, said
procedures for detaining Palestinians without trial for up to six
months must be formalized. Human rights activists have deplored
current policy under which about 2,500 Palestinians are detained.
   A Jerusalem Post report today blamed the uprising for diplomatic
setbacks in relations with Poland, Greece, Ireland and Portugal.
   The newspaper said Poland had canceled plans to raise the level
of relations with Tel Aviv and Greece reneged on a promise to open
an embassy in Tel Aviv and upgrade Israeli representation in Athens.
   Israel's deteriorating image also prompted Portugal not to open
an embassy in Tel Aviv and Ireland to refuse to host a resident
Israeli ambassador in Dublin, the Post said, quoting sources in
Jerusalem.
   An Israeli Foreign Ministry official confirmed Greece said
several months ago it would not open an embassy because of the
uprising. But he said it was unclear whether the other countries
were acting because of the Arab rebellion. He spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   In other developments, police closed the Dar El Aytam boys'
school inside the walled Old City on Thursday after students from
the school stoned a police patrol. Two youths were detained, Israel
radio said.
   The school closing came as violence has been on the increase in
Jerusalem after four months of relative calm. In a leaflet issued
last week, underground leaders of the uprising called on Arabs to
make Jerusalem the focus of their disturbances.
   The army has also confirmed that 38 schools were closed in the
West Bank in an effort to quell the protests, mostly involving
young Palestinians.
   On Thursday, police fired tear gas at dozens of Palestinians who
gathered near a key highway in Arab east Jerusalem to stone Israeli
cars, capping a day of violence in the city, Israel radio reported.
   It said police used tear gas after the Arab youths stoned
Israeli cars on a highway linking the occupied West Bank settlement
of Maaleh Adumim, home to over 15,000 Jews, with Jerusalem.
   The radio did not say whether police made any arrests. Police
spokesman Rafi Levy could not be reached at his home or office for
comment on the report.
   Also Thursday, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir accused Arab states
of encouraging Palestinians in the occupied lands to keep up their
``destructive and futile'' actions. He vowed that the uprising
would fail.
   In a speech to leaders of the quasi-governmental Jewish Agency,
Shamir rejected the view that the recent Arab summit in Algiers
adopted moderate resolutions toward Israel.

   Colorado wildlife officials have set traps
around this posh ski resort to catch up to eight bears that have
been enjoying the city's lifestyle.
   The bears have been feasting on trash bins, said Bill Andree, a
state wildlife official. One of the sows even may have taught her
cubs to expect handouts from residents.
   Earlier this spring, officials believed there was only one bear
rambling around town, but recent sightings indicate there could be
as many as eight living in a 20-mile stretch from Vail to Beaver
Creek.
   The bears have become more aggressive, Andree said. Last
weekend, a bear chased a 14-year-old boy after he photographed the
animal.
   Residents have been warned not to camp or sleep out in backyards
or near food sources.
   Bears older than 3 years will be killed, Andree said. Younger
bears will be marked and released near Radium, 20 miles northeast
of here.
   State wildlife officials believe younger bears, if put in the
proper habitat, may learn to eat without bothering people.

<TEXT>
   The first American inspectors
assigned to verify Soviet compliance with the treaty to eliminate
intermediate-range nuclear weapons left for Moscow today.
   Their Soviet counterparts arrive in San Francisco tonight.
   The two U.S. inspection teams, each comprised of 10 experts,
traveled from Frankfurt's Rhein-Main Air Base.
   They were led by U.S. Army Brig. Gen. Roland Lojoie, director of
the On-Site Inspection Agency, which was formed Jan. 15, 1988 after
President Reagan and Mikhail S. Gorbachev signed the Intermediate
Nuclear Forces treaty in Washington. That accord eliminated
ground-based short- and medium-range missiles.
   ``We all feel this is a historic mission,'' Lajoie told
reporters before boarding a U.S. Air Force jet for Moscow. ``Its
impact on international relations cannot be underestimated. We are
proud to be a part of this important moment in history.''
   Lajoie said one team would travel to the Soviet city of
Votkinsk, the site of a plant that formerly built the Soviets'
SS-20 missiles. The SS-20s are covered by the treaty, along with
U.S.-built Pershing 2 missiles and cruise missiles based in western
Europe.
   The other U.S. team must tell the Soviets within 48 hours after
arrival where it intends to begin conducting inspections, Lajoie
said. He did not disclose which site that would be.
   ``We're going in with the attitude `Trust everybody, but always
cut the cards,''' Lajoie said.
   The general said that although there are 1,800 missiles whose
destruction must be checked, other related items _ including
storage and transport missile containers and special hauling
vehicles _ bring the actual number of items to be inspected to at
least 5,000.
   The inspection teams will be checking for numbers of missiles,
and individual components will be measured and weighed under the
inspection process agreed upon with the Soviets, said Lajoie.
   In the next two months, the inspectors will visit 126 sites in
the Soviet Union, including 33 in eastern Siberia, Lajoie said.
   The Soviets will inspect 26 sites in the United States and
western Europe, including 11 in the continental United States,
according to On-Site Inspection Agency officials.
   The U.S. teams include linguists and specialists in nuclear
missiles.
   Although the inspection teams are comprised of members of all
branches of the U.S. military and civilian government employees,
the inspection agreement calls for all of them to wear civilian
clothes during their stay in the Soviet Union.
   In London, NATO commander Gen. John R. Galvin said he was
confident the verification arrangements would work. He said he had
been surprised at the openness the Soviets have shown in the visits
to U.S. elimination sites so far.

<HEAD>Government Proposes Bill To Strengthen Residential Segregation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GREG MYRE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government proposed
legislation today that would strengthen residential segregation but
also would allow creation of the first legal multi-racial
neighborhoods.
   Government opponents condemned the three proposed measures,
saying they would force the evictions of thousands of blacks now
living peacefully but illegally in ``whites only'' areas.
   ``The government indicates once again its absolute obsession
with skin color as a norm on which to base South Africa's
political, social and economic life,'' said the anti-apartheid
Independent Party.
   Tian van der Merwe, member of Parliament for the anti-apartheid
Progressive Federal Party, called the measures ``so harsh and so
brutal'' that up to 200,000 blacks could be evicted on short notice.
   Under the Group Areas Act, all residential areas are segregated
by race. However, thousands of non-whites are living illegally in
neighborhoods designated for whites in Johannesburg, Cape Town and
other urban areas.
   One of the proposed measures, the Group Areas Amendment Bill,
would make it easier to confiscate property and to evict and
prosecute people living in areas not designated for their race
group.
   The maximum fine for a person living outside his group area
would be increased from $175 to $4,300. The maximum prison sentence
would be increased from two years to five years.
   The government has not strictly enforced the 35-year-old Group
Areas Act in recent years, angering conservative whites opposed to
integrated neighborhoods. The proposed bill is widely seen as an
accommodation to right-wing whites prior to nationwide municipal
elections in October.
   President P.W. Botha's governing National Party favors gradual
race reform but says it is committed to preserving white ``group
rights'' such as segregated schools and neighborhoods.
   The National Party has dominated South African politics for 40
years but has been losing ground to the extreme-right Conservative
Party, which opposes all concessions to the nation's 26 million
black majority. Under South Africa's system of apartheid, blacks
have no vote in national affairs.
   A second proposed bill, the Free Settlement Areas Bill, would
allow creation of residential areas open to all races. But before
such areas could be established, a government committee would check
``the necessity or desirability'' of an area being opened to all
races.
   A third bill would set up guidelines for multi-racial political
participation by residents in ``open areas.''
   The three bills are to be debated in the next session of
Parliament in August.

<HEAD>Small `Star Wars' Rocket Engine Successfully Tested</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Aerospace experts developing ``Star Wars''
technology have successfully tested a tiny, 2-ounce rocket engine
designed to power satellite-based missile killers.
   The engine tested at Rocketdyne's Santa Susana Field Laboratory
on Thursday is slated for use as a directional thruster for a
space-based interceptor in the Strategic Defense Initiative program.
   The goal is to neutralize incoming enemy nuclear missiles before
they re-enter the atmosphere by using lasers and interceptor
rockets.
   The new engine, dubbed by designers as the most efficient in the
free world, would guide the interceptor from its base on a
satellite toward an approaching nuclear missile. The missile would
be destroyed on impact.
   Officials from the Air Force Space Division, Rockwell
International and Rocketdyne called the test successful, praising
the engine's weight-to-thrust ratio, a measure of its power and
efficiency. Thrust is the forward force produced in reaction to
gases escaping rearward from the engine.
   ``The engines we were running with around five years ago were
1-to-20,'' said Ernie Bunch, a Rocketdyne engineer in the
space-based interceptor, or SABIR, program.
   The tiny engine tested has a weight-to-thrust ratio of
1-to-1,200, said Frank Patota, engineer in charge of the test area.
   The engine was fired, or pulsed, for five milliseconds and then
was shut off for 1@10 of a second. This cycle was repeated dozens
of times during each of the three testings. The result sounded like
machine gun fire.
   The interceptor rockets would be equipped with four of the
tested engines and four smaller thrusters.

   Presidential employees will get letters next
week telling them they face random drug tests in about 60 days, a
step the American Civil Liberties Union said today likely would not
have caught five White House drug abusers.
   Both President Reagan and his wife, Nancy, who has campaigned
extensively against drug use, expressed dismay Thursday at the
disclosure that two female National Security Council secretaries
had resigned and three Secret Service officers were suspended
during a drug probe.
   ``I think it's just evidence of what we've been saying. ... No
one is exempt,'' Reagan said, adding, ``This problem crosses all
kinds of lines.''
   Mrs. Reagan, through her spokeswoman Elaine Crispen, voiced
disappointment and said, ``Drugs are everywhere _ in the work
place, movie industry, sports fields and college campuses. It's
time everyone became involved and aware and intolerant of drug
use.''
   Her husband, however, advocated treatment rather than
intolerance for the White House employees implicated in the case.
   Reagan said during brief comments to reporters that ``if it's
just a case of using'' drugs rather than dealing, ``I would like to
see us do our best to get them into a drug treatment organization,
and that they will agree to accept a cure.''
   ACLU lawyer Lauren Siegel said urine testing is a serious
intrusion of privacy rights.
   ``The response of the president, which is to line up many
dedicated civil servants who have given a good part of their
careers to life in public service to pee on command in order to
prove their innocence is really not the best way to deal with this
problem in the White House,'' said Ms. Siegel in an interview on
ABC-TV's ``Good Morning America.''
   ``In the opinion of the ACLU, what happened at the White House
seems to make the case against drug testing because, in fact, these
people were caught as the result of a problem that was triggered by
somebody's legitimate suspicion,'' she said, adding that if the
White House had relied on drug testing ``these people may have
slipped right through.''
   Neither White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater nor Secret
Service spokesman Bob Snow would identify the individuals involved
or the illegal substances allegedly used. Published and broadcast
reports have said the probe focused on cocaine and marijuana use.
   Fitzwater said letters will be sent to the 1,600 presidential
employees next week warning that a mandatory, random program of
drug testing will commence 60 days hence.
   Fitzwater said the tests will be conducted six times a year,
with each round involving about 2 percent of the staff.
   Included are employees of the Office of Management and Budget,
the National Security Council and the offices of the vice president
and the first lady.
   Fitzwater said two female clerical employees ``admitted drug use
and were separated from the NSC'' several months ago. The spokesman
refused to say whether they had sensitive positions on the agency,
the White House unit that advises the president on a wide gamut of
foreign affairs and security issues.
   Adding to the disconcerting news was the alleged involvement of
uniformed members of the Secret Service _ the men and women who
guard the White House grounds, travel with the president to help
provide security and protect other key Washington locations such as
embassies and the vice president's home.
   Fitzwater said none of the allegations involved the
non-uniformed Secret Service agents who act as the president's
bodyguards.
   Snow declined to specify the sex of the uniformed officers
involved. He said some 960 officers serve in the uniformed division.
   Fitzwater said that on July 13, the Secret Service will begin
its own program of pre-employment drug testing for job applicants.
   The Washington Post, which first reported the drug investigation
and suspensions, quoted an unidentified source as saying that at
least one sale of cocaine allegedly occurred on White House
property. Fitzwater said that ``we have been advised that drugs
were not used or sold on the White House premises.'' Snow would not
comment on that, although he did say that no charges had yet been
filed.
   Snow said the three Secret Service officers _ who have Civil
Service protection _ were placed on administrative leave with pay,
and that their status will depend on whether charges are brought by
the U.S. attorney's office in the District of Columbia. The
officers were placed on leave during the past week, Snow said.
   The secretaries, who do not have Civil Service status, lost
their positions because they serve at the pleasure of the
president, officials said.
   The disclosure of the drug investigation shook the White House
at a time when Reagan's ``zero-tolerance'' anti-drug abuse campaign
is in disarray. Reagan has sought, so far unsuccessfully, to get
Democratic congressional leaders to take part in a bipartisan task
force on the problem.
   Moreover, the latest uproar came on a day in which Reagan
received recommendations from his Drug Policy Board, headed by
Attorney General Edwin Meese III. Among the proposals was one to
require companies doing business with the government to demonstrate
effective plans for a drug-free workplace.
   The board also recommended that federal student aid programs be
made conditional upon the adoption of effective anti-drug programs
by colleges and universities and said students with records of drug
offenses should not be given assistance.

<HEAD>Rescue Crews Find Five Bodies Of Victims of Helicopter Crash</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MADRID, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rescue workers today found the bodies of
five people, including one of Spain's top transportation officials,
whose helicopter crashed in a storm north of Madrid, a Civil Guard
spokesman said.
   The official said the bodies of Highway Traffic Chief Rosa de
Lima Manzano and four men were found near near the wreckage on a
4,800-foot-high peak near La Cabrera, a town 45 miles north of the
Spanish capital.
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the dead
included Miss de Lima Manzano, art critic Santiago Amon, Socialist
Deputy Alberto Alcitores Balbas, and Civil Guard pilots Manuel
Moratillo and Santiago Aizpurua.
   The official said the bodies had been severely burned.
   About 1,800 people, including members of the paramilitary Civil
Guard, the army and the civil defense had taken part in the search
in the Somosierra mountain range, the official said.
   Officials gave no cause for the accident but said a storm and
poor visibility may have been partly responsible.
   Before serving as the Interior Ministry's highway traffic chief,
Miss de Lima Manzano had been civil governor of the northern
province of Palencia, a post comparable to sheriff.
   The helicopter left Madrid on Thursday for Aguilar de Campo, 160
miles north of Madrid.

   A firecracker fuse that has apparently burned
out can be dangerous for up to a half hour after it appears to go
out, a federal safety official said today.
   Consumer Products Safety Commissioner Ann Graham acknowledged
that illegal fireworks are readily available across the country and
pose the greatest danger to people celebrating the 4th of July.
   She gave advise for the use of fireworks in an interview on
``CBS This Morning:''
   _Don't use illegal fireworks.
   _If a device appears to be a dud, stay away from the fuse for 30
minutes.
   _Don't allow young children to play with fireworks.
   _If children are allowed to use fireworks, it should only be
under parental supervision.
   _Read the label before lighting.
   _Have water available in case of fire.

<HEAD>Report Says National Security Agency Bugging Satellite Phone Calls</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CLEVELAND (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House Intelligence Committee is
investigating allegations that the National Security Agency engaged
in electronic eavesdropping of Congressmen and American citizens,
The Plain Dealer reported today.
   The alleged telephone bugging was accomplished through
interception of satellite signals, the newspaper said.
   It said the allegations surfaced during secret testimony earlier
this year by Margaret A. Newsham, 45, a former employee at Lockheed
Missiles and Space Co. in Sunnyvale, Calif.
   Maj. Alan Freitag, public affairs duty officer for the Defense
Department in Washington, said Thursday night he was not familiar
with Ms. Newsham or her allegations and could not comment on the
report.
   Ms. Newsham, a former software configuration management analyst
for space projects at Lockheed, handled classified assignments
overseas and possessed NSA special access clearances.
   She lost her top secret access after becoming a
``whistleblower'' on waste in a government program and making
accusations that she was sexually harassed, according to The Plain
Dealer, which said she was fired from Lockheed for alleged
time-card violations.
   Ms. Newsham told Rep. Louis Stokes, D-Ohio, chairman of the
Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, that the monitoring was
being done with the cooperation of British authorities and from
English soil, the newspaper said.
   While NSA eavesdropping on ordinary telephone calls is barred in
the United States, loopholes in the law allow the agency to do it
by monitoring microwave frequencies outside U.S. borders, said
James Bamford, author of ``Puzzle Palace,'' a book on the NSA.
   Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., who is said to have been among
those whose personal calls were monitored by the Pentagon security
agency, said he looked into the allegations after being informed of
them by The Plain Dealer. He said he does not believe they are true.
   Ms. Newsham was among sources confirming the existence of her
top-secret session with Stokes and two committee staffers, the
newspaper said.
   Asked about the allegations, Ms. Newsham's credibility or why
other members of the committee were not involved in the meeting,
Stokes said, ``I don't discuss intelligence business.''
   The military watchdog group Project on Military Procurement has
been working with Stokes on the probe, The Plain Dealer said.

<TEXT>
   It may have been the Chicago White Sox'
biggest victory since they won the American League's West Division
in 1983.
   Like a manager trying to spark a late-inning rally, Gov. James
R. Thompson worked the floor of the House and Senate and coaxed
lawmakers to go to bat for the American League club.
   They responded early today by narrowly approving an incentive
package to keep the team from moving to Florida.
   ``This is a political resurrection from the dead, a baseball
resurrection from the dead,'' a jubilant Thompson said. ``I even
told myself a couple times this was dead. But I decided I was not
going to let them go.''
   The deal would tie the team's rent on the new $150 million
state-financed stadium to attendance and give the state a share of
the team's gate receipts, television royalties and other revenue
when attendance tops 1.2 million.
   ``The Chicago White Sox are elated at the outcome of (the)
stadium vote,'' the team said in a statement.
   In St. Petersburg, Fla., officials who tried to lure the team
south conceded defeat.
   ``It was clearly their turn at bat and they hit a homer,'' said
Rick Dodge, the assistant city manager who led the negotiations
with the White Sox. ``We're obviously very disappointed about the
vote in Illinois.''
   Final passage came on a tense 60-55 vote in the House as time
ran out on the last regularly scheduled day of the 1988 session. A
short time earlier, the package cleared the Senate on a 30-26 vote.
   The city is also home to the Chicago Cubs, a National League
team. The new stadium will be built near Comiskey Park, the team's
current home.

<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A mountain-sized asteroid smashed into the
South Pacific 2.3 million years ago and exploded with a force of 12
billion tons of TNT, sending so much water vapor aloft that it
could have helped accelerate the last ice age, scientists reported
today.
   A study published in the journal Science says the asteroid, more
than a quarter-mile across and weighing more than 6 trillion
pounds, hit the ocean just southwest of South America, near
Antarctica, and splashed billions of tons of water vapor into the
upper stratosphere.
   Frank T. Kyte, a member of the research team at the University
of California at Los Angeles, said the asteroid actually could have
been much larger than a quarter-mile across, but researchers can
confirm only a minimum size.
   Kyte and his colleagues, Lei Zhou and John T. Wasson of UCLA,
calculated the size of the asteroid by studying the composition and
distribution of core samples taken from six sites on the Pacific
Ocean floor.
   He said the researchers were able to identify some of the
samples as unmelted asteroid material heavily laced with salt.
Other samples had metal grains, and all were rich in iridium, a
chemical characteristic of meteorites.
   Kyte said the asteroid would have hit the ocean at about 12,000
miles an hour. The energy of the mass and velocity would instantly
have been converted into an explosion that would have blasted water
aloft and vaporized most of the asteroid, he said.
   ``It would have made any atomic bomb look like a toy,'' Kyte
said in a telephone interview.
   The explosion would have equaled the force of 12 billion tons of
TNT, he said. The U.S. bomb dropped on Hiroshima in 1945 had a
force of 19,000 ton of TNT.
   In what he said is strictly speculation, Kyte said tons of water
vapor sent into the upper stratosphere by the blast could have
formed clouds that reflected sunlight away from the Earth. This, he
said, could have been sufficient to cause a rapid decrease in
global temperature and an increase within a season in the amount of
land covered by snow.
   Kyte said the asteroid hit the ocean about the time that the
last great glacier age started about 2.3 million years ago. But he
said he and his coauthors are not claiming that the asteroid
triggered the glacier age _ only that the two events occurred about
the same time and that the asteroid impact may have contributed to
the cooling.
   Most scientists believe the glacial age, which lasted until
about 10,000 years ago, was brought about by a gradual global
cooling, perhaps triggered by a movement of the continents that
blocked the exchange of warm water between oceans at the equator.
   Jim Kasting, an impact expert at NASA's Ames Research Center in
California, said he regarded as ``highly speculative'' the theory
that the asteroid impact could have added to the global cooling.
   Kasting said some studies have indicated that clouds, formed in
the upper stratosphere by water splashed aloft by an impact, could
actually contribute to warming the Earth by allowing sunlight to
pass through and then trapping heat reflected from the planet
surface.
   ``The clouds could warm or cool the planet, depending on their
thickness,'' he said.

   John Zaccaro Jr., convicted of selling a
quarter-gram of cocaine to an undercover officer, has won
preliminary approval to serve his four-month sentence beginning
today under house arrest.
   The son of former vice presidential candidate Geraldine Ferraro
was to begin the sentence by 5 p.m.
   Addison County State's Attorney John Quinn said Zaccaro might
spend his first 24 hours in a high security holding cell at the
Chittenden Community Correctional Center in South Burlington, a
standard procedure to keep new prisoners under observation.
   Zaccaro, 24, was sentenced two weeks ago, but the sentence was
stayed 30 days pending appeal to the Vermont Supreme Court. If an
appeal had been granted, it might have been a year or more before
the court decided the case.
   But Zaccaro's lawyers dropped the request for the stay and asked
that Zaccaro start serving his sentence today. Judge Francis
McCaffrey agreed, deputy court clerk Kathy Moore said Thursday.
   Corrections Department spokesman John Perry said Zaccaro had
gained preliminary approval for a new state program under which he
would live in a department-approved apartment and could leave only
with permission.
   Under the program, Zaccaro could begin the 300 hours of
community service his sentence entails. The judge fined Zaccaro
$1,500 as well.

<TEXT>
   ``The Greatest Show On Earth'' met one of
the world's most polite audiences today, and the American brand of
unbridled circus won some new fans.
   The Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Combined Shows made its
debut in Japan in a huge tent in this city on the northern island
of Hokkaido. The audience was the first in Japan to see an American
circus.
   A near-capacity matinee crowd of about 4,000 attended the debut
and clapped enthusiastically for the 200-member troupe, after a
little encouragement from the clowns.
   ``We had been prepared for a reserved, quiet crowd. This is not
Texas,'' ringmaster Dinny McGuire told The Associated Press after
the performance. ``But they clapped fervently. ... I did not expect
them to be as overwhelmingly demonstrative.''
   Ringling Brothers has brought a version of the 118-year-old show
to Japan as an experiment. It will give 44 performances in Sapporo,
then 96 shows in Tokyo in August and September.
   The Japan Educational Association, the local promoter of the
tour, wanted a production as big as the two Ringling troupes
touring the United States, said publicist Joe Gold.
   The $40 ticket price for adults _ about four times the average
price in the United States _ still is considered reasonably priced
entertainment in Japan.
   To help audiences understand the acts, ringmaster McGuire
learned his introductions in Japanese. Also, Japanese characters
were put on many of the clown costumes to identify them to children.
   Finally, ``we brought in 120 kids last week'' for a dry run,
Gold said.
   Ringling owner-producer Ken Feld said the production will cost
$10 million plus incidentals _ such as the $8 million tent.
   At the matinee, viewers first smiled instead of laughing and
clapped politely instead of loudly. But the clowns went into the
stands for direct contact with youngsters, then staged elaborate
stunts and broke the ice with a comedy high-wire act called the
``Mount Fuji Aerial Adventure.''
   ``Slapstick always plays well,'' said Glen Little, the head
clown, wearing a blue wig.
   Sachiko Okawara said she liked the performance ``very much.''
``The performancers, the animals, the costumes, the lights _ and
the band. The band was beautiful,'' she said.
   For 5-year-old Miku Kusakabo, the list of favorites was shorter:
``The elephants,'' she said through an interpreter, and nodded
vigorously when asked if she wanted to come back.

<TEXT>
   Jackie Gleason immortalized bus drivers with his
fictitious Ralph Kramden, that lovable Brooklyn loudmouth who
schemed with Ed Norton and sparred with Alice.
   Now the late comedian has been honored with the Jackie Gleason
Bus Depot.
   The Great One's widow, Marilyn, was on hand Thursday at the
dedication of the depot in Brooklyn, the borough of his birth and
the setting for ``The Honeymooners,'' the show on which he created
the Kramden character.
   Also participating were June Taylor, leader of the June Taylor
Dancers, and Joyce Randolph, who played Trixie on the 1950s
television show that lives on in syndication.
   Metropolitan Transportation Authority Chairman Robert Kiley
saluted Gleason as ``a great son of Brooklyn.''
   ``His bus driver creation, Ralph Kramden, may have been a
blowhard, but always, deep down, he was a hard worker and a decent
human being. He was, as he always said of (his wife) Alice, the
greatest.''
   About 1,200 people witnessed the dedication at the
919,000-square-foot building that employs 850 people.
   Merry and John Kelly came up from Philadelphia. They are leaders
of the Philadelphia chapter of the Friendly Order of Raccoons _ a
group patterned after the fictitious lodge to which Kramden and
friend Norton belonged.
   The Kellys wore raccoon hats and fancy jackets and saluted each
other.
   ``The Honeymooners'' theme song played during the dedication
ceremony, at which officials unveiled the logo for the depot _ a
moon rising over the New York skyline, evocative of the scene
displayed during the show's credits.
   The ties between the Transit Authority and Gleason were
long-standing. His mother was a subway change-booth clerk in the
1930s. And during ``The Honeymooners'' initial run, Gleason was
made an honorary member of the Transport Workers Union.
   The day after Gleason's death on June 24, 1987, at age 71, many
New York bus drivers drove with their lights on as a memorial.

<HEAD>Prosecution Witness Writes Botha To Recant Testimony</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A prosecution witness has
written President P.W. Botha to seek clemency for six black people
whose death sentences have sparked international outrage, a
newspaper reported today.
   Joseph Manete, who said that police tortured him so he would
give false testimony, reportedly described his police interrogation
and pleaded for the release of the so-called Sharpeville Six.
   ``I am writing this letter in order to tell you the truth ...
What I have told the court was not my words,'' according to a text
of the letter published today by City Press, the largest
circulation newspaper for blacks.
   Botha refused to intervene in the case, despite appeals from
many foreign governments to halt the hanging of the five black men
and one woman convicted of the mob killing of a black town
councillor.
   A day before they were due to hang in March, attorneys obtained
a stay of execution from the trial judge, Willem Human, on the
basis of a statement that Manete had given his lawyer.
   The lawyers said Manete wrote an affidavit saying police coerced
him into falsely identifying two of the defendants as being part of
the crowd that stoned and burned ouncilor Jacob Dlamini in
September 1984.
   During a hearing last month, Human said he had not relied on
Manete's testimony and had not been shown the affidavit. Human said
reopening the case to investigate interrogation of other
prosecution witnesses would be ``absurd.''
   Human gave the defendants until July 19 to seek a stay of
execution from the chief justice of the Appellate Court, P.J. Rabie.
   In the letter printed today, Manete described his interrogation,
saying that from the outset he told police he didn't know the names
of Dlamini's killers.
   ``They threatened and pressurized me,'' he wrote. ``One of the
white policemen pushed my head against the wall and I was clapped
several times on the face.''
   He said a policeman read him the names of the six defendants and
told him he would be imprisoned ``and tortured daily'' if he did
not name two of them as having been present at the killing.
Finally, Manete said, ``I agreed with them.''
   ``During the interrogation I was afraid that very soon I will
reach the point of no return _ that is death,'' he said.
   The six defendants are Mohalefa Sefatsa, Reid Mokoena, Oupa
Diniso, Theresa Ramashomola, Duma Khumalo and Francis Mokgesi.
   Manete said he was told to identify Khumalo and Mokgesi. He told
Botha other prosecution witnesses also were unhappy about
statements they had given under police interrogation.

<TEXT>
   When the lights flickered inside the
Cheyenne Club, the last call sounded for 19- and 20-year-olds
enjoying their last night of legal drinking in Wyoming until they
turn 21.
   The flickering marked midnight, the witching hour for those
working to make the most of the time before the state joined the
rest of the nation in making 21 the minimum legal drinking age at
12:01 a.m. today.
   ``I think everybody has one last chance and they are taking
advantage of it,'' said 20-year-old Michelle Wileman, of Cheyenne.
``I kind of have to, because I can't go back in and drink for the
next 10 months.''
   The clock on Wyoming's alcohol drinking age began ticking in
March, when Gov. Mike Sullivan and legislators reluctantly agreed
they could no longer hold out against ``federal blackmail'' _ the
withholding of federal highway funds because the state had not
raised its drinking age.
   After singing along to The Beastie Boys' ``You Gotta Fight For
Your Right To Party,'' the shoulder-to-shoulder crowd moved toward
the doors, waving to a network television crew and carrying a young
woman on their shoulders.
   Some went home; others waited outside for the bar to re-open and
serve non-alcoholic drinks to those under 21. Those affected by the
law were almost unanimously against it.
   ``What bothers me is Wyoming is recognized as the equality
state,'' said Cheyenne resident Jeff White. ``If we are the
equality state and the first to take chances on things like women
voting, we should take a chance on taking a stand.''
   ``My husband is 21, so I like to go to the bar with him,'' said
19-year-old Hope Green, of Laramie. ``For a year, we've been coming
to this bar together. All of a sudden, they say to me `He's
responsible, but you're not any more.' You can't do that.''
   Under the law passed by Congress in 1984, states had to raise
the drinking age to 21 or lose a percentage of their federal
highway funds. The law went into effect in 1986, and Wyoming
sacrificed $11.8 million in two years.
   Wyoming stood to lose another $8.2 million in federal funds if
the drinking age increase was not in place by today. Wyoming
officials said the state could have lost $41.3 million in highway
funds during the next four years.
   The reasoning behind the move made little difference to many of
those out Thursday night, such as Dianna Estes, who celebrated her
19th birthday in Laramie with a few last drinks.
   ``I don't live with my parents,'' she said. ``I make my own
decisions. If I can do all of that, I can drink responsibly.''

   Two cars rigged with explosives blew up

   The first explosion occurred on west Beirut's busiest street. A
police spokesman said the bomb went off on Hamra Street at about
11:50 a.m. (4:50 a.m. EDT) near the Grand Hotel in the
Syrian-policed neighborhood.
   The spokesman, who could not be identified in line with standing
regulations, could not immediately confirm a state radio report
that a man killed in the blast was the driver of the automobile.
   Thirty-two people were injured in that bombing.
   Later, a Mercedes Benz loaded with explosives blew up in eastern
Lebanon's Bekaa valley near a Syrian army checkpoint, police said.
They said 20 people, including two Syrian soldiers, were injured.
   The car, parked about 15 yards from a checkpoint in the town of
Bar Elias, exploded at 12:25 p.m. and set four other cars on fire,
police said.
   After the Beirut bombing, black smoke billowed from the southern
edge of Hamra Street as motorists, honking their horns, sped away
in panic.
   The street is lined with boutiques, cafes and other shops. Its
high-rise buildings house offices and banks. The explosion occurred
near the plush Versailles Cinema, which was closed because of
damage sustained in civil war fighting.
   Witnesses said Syrian soldiers fired automatic rifles in the air
to make way for fleeing cars.
   Lebanese policemen blocked traffic along the 1.5-mile-long
street to allow ambulances and fire engines to reach the scene.
   Today's blasts came nine days after a car bomb exploded in east
Beirut's Christian district of Karantina, wounding 19 people.
   There have been nine car bombings in Lebanon this year.
Ninety-four people were killed and 251 wounded in the previous
blasts.

   A World War II veteran plans to fly solo across
the Atlantic to return to the German battlefield where a sniper's
bullet left him a paraplegic 43 years ago, and West German
officials are waiting to honor him.
   Clark Harrison, 63, a real estate company owner and bank
chairman in suburban Decatur, took off at about 9:30 a.m. today
from DeKalb-Peachtree Airport in a single-engine Cherokee Piper
equipped with hand controls and an extra gas tank.
   ``What scares me the most is rolling around in this wheelchair
and getting in and out of it,'' he said. ``The easy part is the
flying. Once I get on the ground, that's the hard part.''
   The residents of Stolberg, West Germany, will be celebrating
what city manager Heinrich Romer called Harrison's ``spirit of
enterprise and courage'' as he completes a 4,669-mile solo
trans-Atlantic flight via Greenland and Great Britain.
   The reception at Stolberg's historic castle is scheduled for
July 11, the day Harrison hopes, weather permitting, to arrive at
the nearby airport in Aachen, West Germany.
   Harrison flies in a cramped two-seat cockpit filled with his
wheelchair, his luggage, a life raft, survival kit and an auxiliary
fuel tank. He gets in and out of the plane by crawling onto the
wing, which sits about three feet off the ground, and then pulling
the wheelchair up or letting it down with a strap.
   Harrison, a founding director of the Shepherd Spinal Center in
Atlanta, hopes his trip will raise enough money for a Center for
Independent Living at the hospital to help the newly paralyzed
learn to care for themselves.
   Supporters are pledging to the hospital up to $1 for each of the
4,669 miles he plans to cover.
   Harrison, who has already flown solo to Alaska and back, says
flying alone has great attraction for someone for whom more routine
tasks can be difficult.
   ``When I was a kid and I first got shot,'' Harrison said,
recalling his days as a 20-year-old infantryman, ``I was in a
hospital for a year and a half. They didn't know what to do with
us. We were just invalids. When that happens when you're young, you
miss out on a lot. So, when you have a chance to transport yourself
over great distances, it has a lot of appeal.''
   Harrison had planned to be a pilot in World War II because he
thought it would be glamorous. But he was assigned to the infantry
and joined the 104th Division for the Army's push into Germany
after D-Day.
   Four days after he arrived, he was shot by a sniper on the
battlefield near Stolberg he plans to visit. A friend dragged him
to a nearby farmhouse.
   Harrison, who finally learned to fly until age 55, plans to
guide his ``Spirit of Shepherd'' plane up the East Coast and across
Canada to the U.S. Air Force base at Sondrestrom, Greenland, where
he will spend July 4.
   Flying by visual flight rules about 2,000 feet above the ground,
Harrison then will cross the Greenland ice cap and go on to
Reykjavik, Iceland; Bagar Island in the Faeroe Islands; Stornoway,
Scotland; Biggin Hill, England, and Aachen, West Germany.
   The pilot said he might sell his plane in Germany and plans to
take a commercial flight home after a 10-day visit.
   Harrison said he's making the journey ``for me, for all
paraplegics, for everyone who feels trapped by their bodies.'' He
hopes the trip will inspire paralyzed people ``so when they think
they'll never be able to do anything, they'll remember that this
guy did that.''

<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis, with a grinning John Glenn
standing by, indicated today he does not think talk that Glenn is
``dull and boring'' and ran a disastrous presidential campaign four
years ago should disqualify the Ohio senator from the vice
presidency.
   ``Dull and boring? I kind of like that,'' said the Democratic
presidential nominee-to-be, who himself has been accused of failing
to excite audiences.
   As for the criticism of Glenn's failed 1984 effort to become the
Democratic presidential nominee, Dukakis said, ``I've won campaigns
and I've lost campaigns. I've run good campaigns and have had one
disastrous campaign, so I'm very sympathetic.''
   Glenn appeared with Dukakis at a United Auto Workers union hall,
the final stop on a Midwest campaign swing by the governor.
   While Dukakis emphasized economic and family issues in his
speeches, much of the attention was diverted to his continuing
search for a running mate.
   During a stop Thursday night in Terre Haute, Ind., Dukakis was
joined on stage by Rep. Lee Hamilton of Indiana, one of several
members of Congress mentioned as potential vice-presidential
choices.
   Monday night, back home in Boston, Dukakis and his wife will
have dinner with Jesse Jackson and Jackson's wife _ a meal certain
to include discussion of the Democratic vice presidential
nomination, which Jackson has said he deserves to be offered. ``I
think part of that will be discussed at some point,'' said Dukakis
aide Nick Mitropoulos.
   At the UAW hall today, there was no question who was the crowd
favorite for a spot on the Democratic ticket.
   ``I've been taking a poll all over America about running mates.
What do you think about John Glenn?'' Dukakis asked the union
audience.
   The response was loud applause and whistles. Dukakis turned and
shook Glenn's hand, then turning back to the microphone, said,
``Sounds unanimous to me.''
   Later, when he opened the event to questions from the audience,
14-year-old Tammy Watts asked him who his vice-presidential choice
would be.
   ``Who do you like?'' asked the candidate.
   ``John Glenn,'' she replied.
   ``I'm grateful for your advice and counsel,'' he said.
   Glenn, who became a national hero when as a Marine pilot and
astronaut he became the first American to orbit Earth, has served
on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and now on the Armed
Services panel.
   Hamilton was chairman of the House panel that investigated the
Iran-Contra affair. He joined the House Foreign Affairs Committee
as a freshman congressman in 1965, now is second in line behind
Chairman Dante Fascell and is seen as likely to come into the
chairmanship eventually. After the 1984 election, he was picked to
chair the House Intelligence Committee.
   Much of the speculation about the sort of running mate Dukakis
should choose has centered on the need for someone with experience
dealing with foreign policy and defense issues.
   Jackson has repeatedly cited his own qualifications for the vice
presidential nomination, beginning with his finish second to
Dukakis in the race for the top spot on the ticket.
   But while saying his strong showing in the primaries and
caucuses earned him the right to consideration for a place on the
ticket, Jackson has not said whether he actually would accept it if
offered.
   Recently the former civil rights activist said he had made his
decision, but he refused to disclose it, even to Dukakis.
   Their upcoming dinner might offer him the opportunity to do that.
   Mitropoulos said it was during a flight Wednesday from
Washington to Des Moines, Iowa, that Dukakis said he'd like to
invite Jackson and his wife, Jacqueline, to have a holiday dinner
with him and his wife, Kitty, at their Brookline, Mass., home.
   Nobody could say who would do the cooking or what the menu might
be.
   There also was a possibility they would go to the Hatch Shell on
the shore of the Charles River for the annual holiday concert by
the Boston Pops orchestra.
   Mrs. Dukakis' father, Harry Ellis Dickson, is a former associate
conductor of the Pops.
   Throughout all the speculation about the vice presidency,
Dukakis remained adamant about making his decision on his timetable.
   ``I have the luxury of having the time and being able to do this
thoughtfully and deliberately,'' he told reporters at an aluminum
company plant outside Chicago.
   ``I'm not going to hurry it,'' he said. ``I'll make a decision
when I'm ready to make a decision.''

   Human error and design flaws
contributed to the collision of two Army helicopters that killed 17
soldiers during night training at Fort Campbell, according to a
report released today.
   ``Human error-pilot error is presumed to be the cause of this
mishap,'' said the report released at a news conference.
   But the report added, ``Because the accident was fatal to the
crew of both aircraft, it is impossible to determine exactly what
caused the two aircraft to fly into each other.''
   The report said one of the two UH-60 Black Hawks did not have
its anti-collision strobe turned on as required at the time of the
March 8 accident.
   The report also cited other factors, including limited pilot
training using night-vision goggles and exterior and interior
design flaws of the Black Hawk.
   The report said there was no evidence of a mechanical
malfunction.
   ``There should be no action taken against anyone as no
foundation for negligence can be established,'' the report said.
``The accident was not due to lack of diligence, nor unreasonable
or unprofessional conduct.''
   The accident occurred when a Black Hawk returning from a solo
instruction flight collided with the lead helicopter in a formation
of three returning from a mission to pick up soldiers in the field.
   The lead helicopter, struck broadside, carried 13 soldiers; the
other craft carried four. All were killed. The other two
helicopters were not damaged and landed safely.
   The 17 victims belonged to the 101st Airborne Division at Fort
Campbell.
   The investigation concluded the collision ``was the result of
the two air crews' being unable to see each other in the final
moments of flight,'' according to a statement read by Maj. Randy
Schoel, public-affairs officer at Fort Campbell.
   ``Restrictions to vision caused by door posts and structural
components of the aircraft and the limited field of view of the
night vision goggles being used by both crews hampered their
ability to see and avoid each,'' Schoel said.
   The lights on the helicopter leading the formation could ``very
easily have been obscured and blended into'' city lights, Schoel
said.
   Crew members on the undamaged helicopters said there was little
warning that another helicopter was approaching.
   ``Up to the point of impact, the missions were formed just as
briefed,'' Schoel said.
   Chief Warrant Officer Steven Shockney, pilot of the third
helicopter, told investigators the lone helicopter did not have its
anti-collision strobe on. The strobe is attached to the front of
the Black Hawk.
   ``That is the one thing that really catches your eyes under
goggles,'' he said. ``If he would have had his anti-collision light
on, we would have seen him for miles and miles.''
   Investigators theorize the crew forgot to turn the
anti-collision strobe light on after a fuel stop, the report said.
   Compounding the problem, the report said, was the lack of
lighting on the helicopters. The report said the number and size of
position lights on the outside of the $4.6 million Black Hawk are
inadequate.
   Moreover, the pilot and co-pilot of the incoming helicopter
could have been tired, the report said.

<HEAD>Judge Gives Sugar Cane Workers Opportunity to Qualify for Resident
Status</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge has given thousands of foreign
sugar cane workers an opportunity to qualify for permanent U.S.
resident status under a program for seasonal farm workers.
   U.S. District Judge Thomas F. Hogan ordered the Immigration and
Naturalization Service to accept applications from sugar cane
workers to obtain legal resident status under streamlined
procedures to accommodate a Nov. 1 deadline.
   Under the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act, seasonal
workers have that date to file applications to qualify for the
program.
   Hogan also ordered INS to grant work authorization papers to the
applicants and barred the agency from initiating deportation
proceedings against those individuals.
   ``Equity demands that these sugar cane workers be afforded an
opportunity to stay in the country pending the final outcome
regarding the status of sugar cane'' in the program for seasonal
workers, Hogan said Wednesday.
   Hogan, who ruled in April that the Agriculture Department had
not justified excluding sugar cane harvesters from the program,
chided USDA for the continuing delay in drafting new regulations.
   He gave USDA until July 11 to propose the new regulations and
set an August 19 deadline for issuing the final rule.
   USDA could still issue regulations that exclude sugar cane
harvesters from the program, but the agency would have to give
Hogan further justification for its decision.
   USDA had sought to issue its new regulations in September, but
Hogan said further delays would not give the workers enough time to
qualify for legal status if the department ultimately decided they
could participate in the program.
   ``The court views with skepticism ... (USDA's) claims that,
despite at least three drafts which have been rejected, the agency
still is grappling with the drafting of the regulation,'' Hogan
said.

   Discovery will be moved to the
launch pad in a formal ceremony on the Fourth of July to be readied
for the first post-Challenger space shuttle flight, NASA said today.
   The five-member astronaut crew slated to fly on the next mission
will be on hand when the shuttle is rolled out on a huge tracked
transporter under the glare of spotlights at 12:01 a.m. Monday, the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration said.
   The 4.2-mile trip to Launch Pad 39B is expected to take six to
seven hours.
   Earlier this week the space agency announced it had officially
delayed Discovery's liftoff from late August until early September,
saying it was taking longer than planned to prepare the vehicle for
the first shuttle flight since the Challenger explosion on Jan. 28,
1986.
   NASA's working date for liftoff is Sept. 4.
   During the ceremony Forrest S. McCartney, director of the
Kennedy Space Center, will present the astronauts with an autograph
book to carry on their four-day mission that contains the
signatures of the 15,240 workers here who have labored to return
the shuttle fleet to space.

<HEAD>Early Reagan Campaign Manager Dies At 63</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTA MONICA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bill Roberts, a veteran political
manager who engineered President Reagan's early California
political triumphs, has died at age 63.
   Roberts, a major figure in California politics for more than
three decades, died Thursday of heart failure, said Adam Ortega, an
associate in his political consulting firm. He had been in failing
health in the past year.
   Among hundreds of California campaigns managed by Roberts,
either independently or with longtime colleague Stu Spencer, were
Reagan's successful campaigns for governor in 1966 and 1970 and
George Deukmejian's gubernatorial campaign in 1982.
   In Deukmejian's 1982 campaign, Roberts' off-the-cuff remark that
there was probably a hidden racist vote against the black
Democratic nominee that didn't show up in polls sparked a furor
that led to his dismissal as campaign manager. Deukmejian narrowly
beat Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley in that contest.
   Roberts and Spencer also worked on Reagan's presidential
campaign in Florida in 1976 and Roberts served as a consultant to
both the Republican National Committee and Reagan's re-election
campaign in 1984.
   Deukmejian's office issued a statement that the governor ``has
known Bill Roberts for over two decades and had great respect for
his considerable political skills ... and was saddened to hear of
his passing.''
   Roberts, a native of St. Louis, spent most of his life in
California.
   In 1960, Roberts and Spencer formed a campaign management firm
that pioneered many modern campaign techniques. Roberts' firms were
among the first to offer complete management of all phases of
campaigning.
   He is survived by two sisters, Mary King and Jane Thimmesch.

   Gunmen killed a physician, two
government officials, a former political candidate and a
12-year-old bystander in a series of attacks throughout the
country, military reports said today.
   A communist rebel also was killed when guerrillas and government
troops fought in a town called Mexico north of Manila, the reports
said. Four government militiamen and a soldier were wounded.
   Official reports from Angeles city, 50 miles north of Manila,
said two unidentified men barged into the clinic of Dr. Patricio
Santiago on Thursday night and fatally shot him as his wife watched.
   In a separate incident also Thursday in Angeles, two gunmen
killed district council member Almario Quiambao as he walked with
his wife on a street, the reports said.
   The slayings brought to 35 the number of people killed during
the past two months in Angeles, home of the United States'
sprawling Clark Air Base. Most of the killings have been attributed
to leftist and right-wing extremists.
   In Mexico town, 10 miles from Angeles, communist guerrillas
aboard a truck overtook a government patrol jeep and fired on the
troops, a military report said. The soldiers fired back and killed
one rebel, the report said, adding that a 12-year-old boy on a
bicycle nearby died in the crossfire.
   Thursday's two other slayings were in the village of Pandanon on
the central Philippine island of Negros, the Philippine News Agency
reported.
   It quoted a police report as saying that six men shot to death
Alfredo Magdato, a defeated vice mayoralty candidate in nearby
Murcia town. The gunmen then opened fire on village council member
Reynaldo Conlu, who was nearby and rushed to investigate, the
agency added.

<TEXT>
   The government is investigating reports that
Filipino donors were paid to give up a kidney for Japanese patients
willing to pay the price, an official said today.
   The Health and Welfare Ministry official, who spoke on condition
of anonymity, said the ministry started the investigation after
reports that a Filipino prison inmate was paid to donate a kidney
to a 51-year-old Japanese man in June.
   ``Our position is that the sale of kidneys by unrelated living
donors is undesirable and at this point we are trying to confirm
those reports,'' the official said.
   A person can live with one healthy kidney.
   The Japanese government is also investigating whether to ask the
Philippines to ban such operations there on Japanese citizens, the
official said.
   According to Noel Litan, executive assistant to Philippine
Health Secretary Alfredo Bengzon, two Japanese citizens have
received kidneys in Manila in the past month, and both operations
were performed at the private Kidney Center of the Philippines.
   He said one of the kidneys came from an inmate at a state
penitentiary and the other from a Japanese donor.
   Under Japanese law, patients are allowed to receive kidneys from
relatives or from the dead. The use of organs for transplant from
brain-dead donors is not recognized in Japan, and liver, pancreas
and heart transplants seldom are performed.
   Arrangements for the two Japanese nationals to undergo
transplant operations in the Philippines were handled by Tadashi
Nakayama, director of the Kidney Transplant Foreign Medical Affairs
Research Association.
   Nakayama told The Associated Press he did not know that the
kidney donor was a prison inmate and denied any knowledge of money
being paid to the donor or to his family.
   According to a report released Thursday by the Japan Society for
Transplantation, about 9,000 people are waiting for kidney
transplants in Japan. Only an estimated 572 people received kidney
transplants in Japan in 1987, the report said.
   ``It was a courageous decision by the Filipino doctor to conduct
the operation,'' Nakayama said. ``It was an emergency, the patient
was dying.''
   Nakayama said he agrees it is unethical to pay donors. He added
his non-profit organization, which charges $138,000 for 200 days of
medical care by a four-member team, lost money on the June case.
   ``The government here doesn't allow transplants from (unrelated)
living donors, but such operations are legal in the Philippines,''
said an employee of the private Japan Health Association's Kidney
Transplant Research Department, another group that refers kidney
patients to doctors in the Philippines.
   The employee, who refused to be further identified, said he
believes kidneys are being sold in the Philippines.

   Heavy rain soaked the central Plains today, bringing new life to
wilting crops and flooding parts of Kansas, but some farmers
complained that the wet weather was too little, too late.
   ``It's too late for this corn even if it does rain,'' said
Oklahoma farmer Ronald Limon, edging into chest-high stalks that
should be 3 feet higher by now. The struggling ears were pale; the
kernels were widely spaced.
   ``You can hear it rattle when the wind blows. And that's a bad
sign,'' Limon said Thursday hours before scattered rain fell on the
state. ``But we're thankful. It could be no ears at all.''
   A bill to guarantee up to $35 million in loans to help farmers
suffering through the drought was passed Thursday by the Wisconsin
Legislature and sent to the governor. It would provide about 3,500
potential loans to farmers whose debts totaled 40 percent of their
assets. Maximum loans would be $10,000 for up to three years at 6
percent interest.
   Widespread rain fell Thursday night and early today from New
Mexico to Missouri and from Mississippi to South Dakota. Chanute,
Kan., got 2.14 inches in the six hours up to 7 a.m. and 2.02 inches
fell at Joplin, Mo.
   But forecasters cautioned that the drought continues.
   ``The indications are that this is a temporary interlude,'' said
Lonnie Nine of the National Weather Service in Springfield, Mo.,
where 3.72 inches fell Wednesday and early Thursday. That city got
an additional 1.83 inches today. ``Over the long haul, we expect to
return to the dry, hot weather. Ten days from now, people will be
needing water again.''
   The rain came too late to help the wheat crop, said Paul
Nordquist, crop production specialist for the University of
Nebraska-Lincoln West Central Research and Extension Center in
North Platte.
   One example of the shortfall in precipitation is Iowa. Harry
Hillaker, acting state climatologist, said final statistics for the
first six months of the year are expected to show average state
rainfall came to 7.45 inches, driest on record, including more than
2 inches earlier this week in some areas. Normal rainfall in that
period is 15.72 inches.
   For some it was not only too late, but too much. Fields, roads
and bridges in northeastern Kansas were under up to 5 feet of water
Thursday. The heaviest rain reported was 12 inches in Douglas
County, Kan., south of Topeka.
   About 20 Douglas County residents had to be evacuated _ some by
boat _ because of flooding, county authorities said.
   ``I knew it was raining when I went to sleep, and when I woke up
water was rushing in the front door,'' said resident Steve Silvers.
``I panicked and grabbed everything I could and started yelling at
my neighbor across the street to see if she was OK.''
   The water washed away large chunks of asphalt from county roads
and uprooted fields of crops made fragile by the heat and drought.
Residents were allowed back in their homes Thursday.
   Thunderstorms brought cooler temperatures to the Plains and a
cold front pushed temperatures to record lows today around the
Great Lakes and from New England to North Carolina. Elkins, W.Va.,
got down to a brisk 32 degrees.
   But the heat wave that had gripped the Midwest claimed another
victim Thursday. An 80-year-old Oklahoma man died of dehydration
three days after he and his wife were found in a wheat field.
   Harry Archer died at a Cordell, Okla., hospital after attempts
to rehydrate him failed, said Washita County undersheriff Ron
Mazureka. His wife, Rhoda, 77, died earlier after collapsing of
heat exhaustion last weekend.
   In Alabama, an autopsy Thursday on a 77-year-old woman found
dead in her home revealed she died of heatstroke. The body of
Thelma Lane was found Wednesday as temperatures in Mobile hovered
in the 90s.

<DATELINE>PRESTON, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Amish man has been sentenced to seven
days in jail, and two dozen others believe they could soon follow,
in a long-standing clash between religious beliefs and a state
highway safety law.
   State law requires non-motorized vehicles to have a red-outlined
orange reflective triangle mounted on the back to warn approaching
drivers.
   But the Amish say displaying the signs would violate their
religion because of their bright color and because they are worldly
objects.
   Amish leaders and state legislators worked out a compromise law
two years ago allowing the Amish to use a white-outlined black
triangle during the day and the orange sign at night.
   But the Amish community has divided over the compromise. Some
refuse to use the orange sign at night and some, especially older
and more conservative Amish, use no signs whatsoever.
   Gideon D. Hershberger was one of 24 Amish men and women who
appeared Thursday before Fillmore County District Court Judge
Margaret Shaw Johnson.
   Hershberger was ticketed in October and again in February. He
refused to pay a $20 fine or perform five hours of community
service and was cited for contempt of court.
   After finding him guilty, Johnson offered him a choice of a $150
fine, doing 30 hours of community service or serving seven days in
jail. Hershberger chose jail. ``What else can a conscientious
objector do?'' he asked later.
   Each of the other defendants pleaded not guilty to violating
state law, but then admitted the facts against them were true.
   The judge found them guilty. ``Religious conviction in this case
is not a defense to the charge,'' she told one defendant.
   Though they were only fined, most of the Amish said they think
they'll eventually follow Hershberger to jail. They have until
November to pay fines or perform community service.

Over Wall</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   West Berlin police today chased nearly 200
squatters from a disputed piece of land near the Berlin Wall after
a monthlong struggle that pitted environmentalists against city
developers.
   When the removal order came, the squatters found an unusual
escape route _ over the Berlin Wall into the city's Communist side.
   East German border guards helped them over the barrier, which
divides the city of Berlin into Allied and Communist sectors.
   Most of the estimated 186 environmentalists who fled to East
Berlin had returned to West Berlin by noon. Nine protesters were
arrested in the raid. Eight have since been released, police said.
   The demonstrators were protesting plans to build a highway
through a park nearby.
   When more than 900 West Berlin police moved in to clear the
area, nearly 200 protesters were already sitting on the
13-foot-high wall.
   They earlier declared that they would seek ``political asylum''
in East Berlin if West German police tried to rout them.
   East German guards backed trucks up to the eastern side of the
wall to make it easier for the environmentalists to jump down and
escape the West Berlin police.
   One smiling East German guard even helped one of the protesters
by pulling his bicycle over the wall.
   The action to clear the squatters from the 10-acre piece of
property known as the ``Lenne Triangle'' occurred after it formally
came under West Berlin's control one minute after midnight.
   It was handed over under the terms of a deal worked out with
East Berlin this year.
   The protesters occupied the area on May 26 and quickly set up a
shantytown and erected barriers to protect them from police charges.
   The property has been the scene of frequent violent skirmishes
between police and demonstrators. Protesters often attacked police
with bottles, stones and Molotov cocktails, and officers responded
with tear gas and water cannons.
   Police could not legally enter the property until it came under
West Berlin control.

   Parliament today condemned a Romanian
plan to resettle ethnic Hungarians and called on Bucharest to
reconsider the move.
   The resolution made no reference to Romania's decision this week
to close a Hungarian consulate and expell its staff. It also didn't
mention the order to close a Hungarian cultural center in the
Romanian capital.
   Matyas Szueroes, head of the foreign relations committee that
drafted the document, appealed to Hungarians ``not to yield to
emotions'' regarding the ``disquieting developments reported from
Romania.''
   Hungary maintains the program of moving residents of 7,000
villages to new agricultural-industrial centers would destroy
ethnic Hungarian culture and tradition in Romania. Romania says it
would help villagers by providing services now enjoyed only in
cities.
   Romania's treatment of its 1.7 million Hungarian residents has
long been a sticky issue between the two Warsaw Pact allies.
   Hungary claims the Hungarian minority is discriminated against.
Bucharest says Hungary's criticism is interference in Romania's
internal affairs.
   Romania on Tuesday closed Hungary's consulate in Cluj in
Transylvania, home to most of Romania's ethnic Hungarians, to
protest a demonstration by 50,000 people in Budapest against the
resettlement program.
   Bucharest also insisted that the Hungarian Embassy move out of
rooms rented for a cultural center.
   Official media in Hungary reported that Romanian authorities
also were sending back some Hungarian travelers without giving any
reason for the move. A Hungarian border official, who spoke on
condition he not be identified, said today there was no official
ban.
   The parliamentary document, which is to be sent to the Romanian
legislature, said the beginning of the Romanian program would
further weaken Hungarian-Romanian relations.
   The document said Hungary hoped Romania ``would reexamine its
... plans and will refrain from their implementation.''
   ``This would remove an important obstacle to the rapprochement
between the Hungarian and Romanian people,'' the document said.
   On Thursday, Communist Party chief Karoly Grosz appealed for
dialogue with Romania.
   Grosz, who is also premier, said the tension was temporary and
warned against drawing long-term conclusions.
   He told Western journalists he would go ahead with a planned
visit to Romania because ``if we don't talk to each other we cannot
understand each other.''
   No date for the trip has been announced, but it is believed
Grosz will go to Bucharest after visits in July to Moscow, Warsaw
and Washington.
   On Thursday, a Hungarian diplomat in Bucharest said Romania had
declared Hungary's cultural center in the Romanian capital closed
and ordered the embassy to vacate the building.
   The cultural center was never issued a permit to start operation
and has been used as a storage for the embassy in recent years.

   Romania's move to shut down a Hungarian
consulate was unprecedented in the Warsaw Pact alliance and shows
how historically rooted ethnic strife can foul up Soviet-led
attempts to forge unity in East Europe.
   Seventy years after Romania gained the region of Transylvania
from Hungary, the two neighbors are still bickering over treatment
of the 1.7 million ethnic Hungarians who live in the fictional
homeland of Count Dracula.
   In the past two years, the dispute has escalated sharply,
pointing up the difference between Hungary's reform-minded
communism and the inflexible regime of Nicolae Ceausescu, which is
increasingly isolated even among its East bloc allies.
   Romania's decision Tuesday to close the general consulate in
Cluj-Napoca in Transylvania came in retaliation for an
anti-Romanian rally in Budapest, the Hungarian capital, on Monday
night. About 50,000 Hungarians protested Romania's plans to destroy
7,000 Romanian villages, including hundreds of Hungarian
communities.
   Today, the Hungarian parliament condemned the resettlement plan
and urged Bucharest to reconsider the move.
   Hungary maintains the plan would destroy the Hungarians'
cultural heritage and ultimately wipe out Hungarian and other
minorities in Romania.
   Romanian officials said the villages to be razed by the year
2000 would be replaced by agricultural-industrial centers designed
to remove differences between country and city dwellers.
   Hungarian officials at a mass meeting on Budapest's Heroes
Square Monday evening said Hungary probably will seek international
support to pressure Romania to cancel the project.
   But Ceausescu on Tuesday rejected Hungarian protests as
``nationalistic, chauvinistic, anti-Romanian and anti-Socialist.''
   Ceausescu's address indicated that relations have reached their
lowest ebb in post-war communist history.
   Hungary long has complained about acts of official
discrimination against its Hungarian minority across the border and
asserted that its people are denied important cultural and ethnic
rights.
   The ethnic Hungarians, known in Romania as Magyars, live in a
21,000-square-mile area of some of the most picturesque mountain
and farm land in the Balkans.
   The land was under Hungarian control for nine centuries but was
given to Romania on Dec. 1, 1919, as part of the dismemberment of
the Austro-Hungarian empire after World War I.
   Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler returned much of the land to Hungary
during World War II in appreciation of the loyalty of the country's
ruler, Adm. Nicholas Horthy. After the war the Allies gave
Transylvania back to Romania.
   The Romanians support their claim to the land by arguing that
Romanized Dacians, their apparent ancestors, stayed in the area
after the Romans withdrew from what is now Romania in the 3rd
century A.D.
   But Hungarian scholars maintain the Dacians withdrew along with
their Roman protectors south of the Danube river and that the
Magyars found a largely empty country when they drifted in from
Asia in the 9th century.
   Budapest relinquished its claim to Transylvania by signing the
1975 Helsinki agreements recognizing post-war borders, but the
Hungarian government and people remain deeply interested in the
area's Hungarian minority.
   ``Treatment of national minorities in Romania is synonymous with
South African apartheid,'' Hungarian poet Gyula Illyes said 10
years ago.
   The Romanian government says its treatment of the Hungarian and
German minorities is fair. It accuses Budapest of chauvinism and
interfererence in its internal affairs and says Hungary is trying
to regain Transylvania.
   Last April, Hungary strongly criticized Romania for decreeing
that Romanian-language place names must be used for cities and
villages traditionally known to the country's ethnic minorities in
their own language.
   In March, Hungary took the unprecedented action of approving
about $6 million to help thousands of ethnic Hungarian refugees who
have fled the shortages and harsh living conditions in Romania.
   The refugees, believed to number up to 20,000 now, also include
several hundred Romanian speakers who are seeking to settle in the
West.

<TEXT>
   President Kurt Waldheim today withdrew a
slander suit filed against Edgar Bronfman, president of the World
Jewish Congress, a spokesman said. Bronfman last year called
Waldheim ``part and parcel of the Nazi killing machine.''
   Spokesman Gerold Christian, told The Associated Press that
Waldheim cited three reasons for the move in a letter sent to the
Vienna prosecutor's office.
   ``First, the U.S. Justice Department has refused legal
assistance, which is in contrast to international legal norms,''
and this ruled out a quick court action, Christian said.
   ``Second, the (international) commission of historians, private
undertakings as well as international historians have determined
Waldheim's personal innocence.
   ``Third, there is an endeavor (on the part of the president) to
contribute to calming down and reconciliation,'' he said.
   The U.S. Justice Department said in December 1987 that it has
evidence of Waldheim's complicity in the transfer of civilian
prisoners to the Nazi SS for exploitation in labor camps during
World War II, the deportations of Jews from Greek islands to
concentration or death camps, the execution of Allied prisoners and
the execution of hostages and other civilians.
   Waldheim has denied wrongdoing.
   Christian said Waldheim stopped the suit also ``to calm things
down for Austria, because the country always has priority over
personal matters.''
   It was believed that Waldheim decided to stop legal proceedings
against Bronfman because there was virtually no chance for the
court action ever to take place in Austria, and even less chance
that it would take place in the United States.
   With the Justice Department unwilling to cooperate by having
Bronfman testify in a U.S. court, and with Bronfman refusing to
appear in an Austrian court, the lawsuit might never have been
resolved.
   A report issued by an international commission of historians in
February did not say if Waldheim was involved in wartime atrocities
but it made clear that as an intelligence officer in the German
army, he was aware of them and did nothing to prevent them.
   The document seriousl questioned Waldheim's integrity and led to
widespread calls for his resignation, but the Austrian head of
state refused to comply, insisting that the historians had cleared
him of all charges.
   Waldheim called on the Vienna prosecutor's office to sue
Bronfman on May 7, 1987, two days after the World Jewish Congress
president said he was ``part and parcel of the Nazi killing
machine'' while serving in the Balkans during the war.
   According to a presidential statement issued at the time, the
lawsuit was also based on a comment by Bronfman who reportedly said
if Waldheim ``has any patriotism in his soul whatsoever, his
doctors would find reasons for him to resign his post.''
   The third Bronfman comment cited by the president said
Waldheim's ``misdeeds and his lying about his past'' were so
obvious that it would be ``almost a crime against humanity to have
very much to do with this man.''

<TEXT>
   A Unisys Co. official whose home was searched
by the FBI in connection with the Pentagon procurement
investigation staged a campaign fund-raiser for U.S. Rep. Roy P.
Dyson, The Sun reported today.
   Dyson aide Katie Tucker told The Sun on Thursday that Dennis
Mitchell organized a cocktail party held July 9, 1987, at a
Manhattan hotel.
   Mitchell at the time was an assistant to Charles F. Gardner, a
former Unisys vice president who is currently a consultant to the
company. Mitchell is now marketing manager for the defense
electronics plant.
   Dyson's relationship with Unisys was first publicly noted on May
1 when the Maryland Democrat's top aide, Thomas M. Pappas,
apparently jumped to his death from his 24th floor New York City
hotel room. Dyson, Pappas and another aide were in Manhattan for a
$4,000 weekend paid for, in large part, by Unisys.
   The FBI searched Gardner's office on June 14 and Mitchell's home
the following week. Neither man responded to requests for
interviews by The Sun.
   Ms. Tucker said her boss remembered seeing Gardner at the party
but that he couldn't remember the names of any other guests.
   ``We have no idea who they are,'' she told The Sun. ``They
attended this fund-raiser that was put together by Unisys. That was
the one and only time we have had any contact with them.''
   William J. Beckham Jr., spokesman for Unisys, said his company
did not ``quote unquote arrange the fund-raiser,'' adding that if
Mitchell staged the event, he did so on his own. ``It was not a
company-sponsored, nor a company-supported activity,'' Beckham said.
   The newspaper also reported that on the same day as the
fund-raiser, Dyson received $1,000 campaign donations from three
other people whose offices or businesses have been searched by the
FBI.
   Federal Elections Commission records show that Dyson collected a
total of $16,000 in political contributions that day, the newspaper
reported.

   An inmate has been transferred from a
federal prison for violating a ban on working as a reporter, and
the prisoner's editor called the move punishment for criticizing
the warden in print.
   Dannie M. Martin, 48, whose June 19 article on conditions at
Lompoc Federal Penitentiary appeared in the San Francisco
Chronicle-Examiner, was moved Thursday to another facility, said
Lompoc Associate Warden Paul Hofer.
   ``I feel Dannie has been transferred as a punitive response to
material the Chronicle chose to print in order to keep its readers
informed on important issues,'' said Peter Sussman, editor of the
Sunday feature section that has published 20 articles by Martin in
the past two years.
   ``Convicts have the right to communicate with news media under
special mail rights and the paper had a First Amendment right to
publish,'' he added.
   Hofer said in a statement that Martin was transferred for
violating prison regulations against inmates working as journalists.
   Sussman said he could not discuss whether Martin was paid for
his articles.
   Martin, serving time for bank robbery, was put in an isolation
ward for 24 hours last week by Warden Richard Rison after a story
by Martin accused Rison of turning the prison into ``a caldron of
fear, hatred and violence.''
   The headline over the story read ``Gulag Mentality.''
   Among other things, Martin criticized Rison's policy of keeping
the recreation yard closed until noon. ``Those of us who work on
night jobs and ran and exercised in the mornings now sit in gloomy
cell blocks watching the sun shine through the window bars,'' he
wrote.
   Rison said that he put Martin in confinement to protect him from
other inmates angered by the article. He said a reference to
possible riots at the maximum-security prison could spark a
demonstration.
   Martin was returned to the general prison population after an
investigation determined he was under no threat.
   Hofer said Martin's intention to continue writing for the
newspaper ``jeopardizes the safe and orderly operation of the
institution and cannot be tolerated.''
   Martin's destination could not be released until he arrived
there, prison officials said.
   Martin's next article will appear Sunday and describes his stay
in confinement, said Sussman. Martin talks about his fear of
transfer in the report.
   The two San Francisco papers produce a joint edition on Sunday,
with the Examiner handling news and the Chronicle handling features.

<HEAD>Norden Drops Out Of Bidding Due To Pentagon Scandal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Norden Systems Inc., under investigation
for allegedly receiving confidential bidding information on a
Marines Corps air command system, has withdrawn its bid on the $120
million contract, its parent company said today.
   Norden became the first known contractor to fall out of a
competition in the wake of the U.S. Defense Department scandal.
Norden, based in Norwalk, had been considered a top contender for
the Advanced Tactical Air Command Control contract.
   The company, which manufactures radar systems and other military
electronic materials, is a subsidiary of United Technologies Corp.,
a leading defense contractor based here.
   Norden pulled out of the competition on June 24, 10 days after
investigators disclosed that the company was among those implicated
in the illegal sharing of classified or proprietary information
among Pentagon employees, private consultants and defense industry
contractors.
   ``No reassignments or change in duties have been made in
connection with the investigation,'' Larry Bingaman, a UTC
spokesman, said today.
   UTC made the letter public after an inquiry from a reporter,
Bingaman said. The Los Angeles Times reported Norden's withdrawal
from the competition in today's editions.
   ``We believe, at this point in time, that it is of paramount
importance for the public as well as the government to have full
confidence in the integrity of the ... procurement process,'' Louis
A. Antonucci, Norden manager of contracts, wrote in the letter.
   ``Given the background of the current investigation and that the
relevant facts have not yet been developed, we have concluded that
Norden Systems' withdrawal from the ... competition is the best
course for us to follow,'' the letter continued.
   The letter states that Norden ``would be pleased to reconsider
its decision'' to withdraw if the government were to delay a final
decision on awarding the contract until more details of the scandal
are known.
   On June 14, federal investigators searched Norden offices in the
East Norwalk section of Norwalk, Bridgeport and Trumbull. A day
later, the Shelton home of James E. Rapinac, a Norden senior vice
president for business development, also was searched.
   The contract that Norden sought calls for the construction of a
high-tech portable shelter used near a battlefield to control
aircraft in all kinds of weather. An FBI affidavit said the
contract is worth about $120 million.
   The affidavit said Navy civilian employee George G. Stone called
defense consultant Mark C. Saunders at home on Sept. 30, 1987, and
read him sealed bid figures on the contract by 10 potential
suppliers, including Norden. Norden had submitted its bid on Aug.
24, 1987.
   The documents said Saunders shared the information with Norden
consultant Thomas Muldoon.

   A jail inmate who swallowed four
batteries as a ploy for freedom probably will live but won't be
released, officials said.
   Terry Williams, 24, told jailers Tuesday morning that he ate the
AAA batteries the night before, Carter County Sheriff Bill Crumley
said Friday.
   Williams was been taken to a hospital for X-rays that revealed
three batteries moving through his digestive system and the fourth
still in his stomach, Crumley said.
   Williams, awaiting trial on drug charges, has suffered no ill
effects but could die if the batteries leak acid, Crumley said.
``He's taking some medicine that's supposed to help him pass the
things.''
   During his three months in jail, Williams has told jailers he
swallowed light bulb shards and mercury, but doctors found no
evidence to back up the claims and he did not fall ill, Crumley
said.
   Doctors at Woodridge Hospital, a mental health facility,
determined Williams behavior did not warrant additional treatment,
Crumley said.
   Williams is charged with selling marijuana, possession of drug
paraphernalia and conspiracy to sell drugs, the sheriff said.

   Transportation officials said today they would
investigate why airport workers in Reggio Calabria turned off the
runway lights and closed the airport for the night as a jetliner
with 103 people aboard approached for a landing.
   The domestic airline ATI, a subsidiary of Alitalia, said the
DC-9 was 60 seconds from touching down Wednesday when the control
tower broke radio contact and the lights went out. Officials said
the pilot quickly gained altitude and flew to Lamezia Terme, 100
miles north to the north.
   ``In no part of the world is an airplane authorized to approach
and then be abandoned at the moment of landing,'' Ettore Grion,
deputy operations director of ATI, was quoted by the AGI news
agency as saying.
   According to newspaper accounts, the jet left Rome 3{ hours late
Tuesday night because of air traffic congestion.
   As it approached Reggio Calabria, in southern Italy, the airport
control tower radioed that the airport closed at 1 a.m. and that
the pilot had 11 minutes to land.
   ``They told us they wouldn't wait a second longer. At 1 a.m.
they shut down,'' the Communist Party newspaper L'Unita quoted the
pilot as saying.
   Newspaper accounts said the pilot tried to make the landing on
time, but at 1 a.m. exactly the runway went dark.
   The Transport Ministry has ordered an investigation, a spokesman
said.

   The steel-blue early hairstreak
butterfly was spotted in Massachusetts for the first time in nearly
a century, a naturalist said.
   Edna Dunbar said she saw 20 early hairstreaks, considered one of
the rarest butterflies in the United States, in the beginning of
June on Mount Greylock, the state's highest peak.
   Dunbar saw four early hairstreaks on June 13, one of which she
netted. In the two weeks that followed, several more were spotted
by her and other Audubon members on Greylock.
   ``When I netted it, I knew it was something I hadn't seen
before,'' she said. ``I looked it up in the guide and realized what
I had.
   ``Naturally I was excited,'' she said. ``When a fisherman
catches a big fish, he gets excited. It's the same idea.''
   Chris Leahy, director of the Audubon Society's conservation
department and coordinator of the Massachusetts Butterfly Atlas
Project, called the early hairstreak ``one of the great mysterious
species'' of the world.
   ``It was last seen by Edward Scudder himself, the patron saint
of New England butterfly collectors,'' Leahy said.
   Scudder made the rare butterfly legendary by including it in a
book on butterflies in 1898, after he also sighted it on Mount
Greylock.
   Scudder ``wrote that he exulted over finding this rare
butterfly,'' Leahy said. ``Since then, nobody has seen it and it is
right at the top of the list of everybody's great finds.''
   Dunbar, a retired General Electric Co. secretary who lives in
Pittsfield, said she came upon the butterfly on a dirt road in the
Mount Greylock reservation near Adams. The hairstreak, which
usually dwells in treetops, was sitting in the road.
   Less than an inch long, the hairstreak is generally steel-blue
with black tips; it may also have a row of reddish-white rimmed
spots, a white fringe or a dusting of orange.

   Pope John Paul II on Friday appointed
Cardinal Achille Silvestrini to head the Holy See's highest
tribunal, in a small shuffle of the church's central administration.
   Silvestrini, an Italian elevated to cardinal on Tuesday, was one
of four new appointments to the Curia. He will head the Supreme
Tribunal of the Apostolic Signatura, whose jurisdiction includes
cases involving concordats between various nations and the Holy See.
   Until recently, Silvestrini served as the Vatican's foreign
minister.
   In other appointments, Cardinal Angelo Felici, an Italian, was
named prefect of the Congregation for the Causes of Saints;
Cardinal Eduardo Martinez Somalo, a Spaniard, was appointed prefect
of the Congregation for the Sacraments and Divine Worship, and
Cardinal Antonio Maria Javierre Ortas, another Spaniard, was made
head of the Vatican archives.
   They succeeded cardinals who had all turned 75, the age at which
Vatican officials are expected to turn in their resignations.

<TEXT>
   Gasoline stations across Poland on Friday
struggled to cope with demand when gasoline without ration coupons
went on sale legally for the first time since 1981.
   Customers at gasoline station No. 560 on Silver Street in Warsaw
waited an average of four hours in the hot sun to pay $2.69 a
gallon, compared with the ration price of $1.58 a gallon.
   By midday, station manager Roman Magnuszewski and his co-workers
had pumped as much gasoline as they normally had in an entire day
when the station sold rationed gasoline.
   Faces fell when a young man asked for 36.4 gallons at a cost of
$98, about the average monthly wage. He filled his car and six big
canisters, enduring hostile comments from fellow customers.
   At noon, a truck delivered more gas, reassuring those at the end
of the 120-car line monitored by police to prevent double parking.
The primarily male clientele read, picnicked, and played cards
while waiting.
   The delivery driver brought word that four more gas stations
would sell the unrationed gas, in addition to the two stations
initially authorized for Warsaw, a city of 1.5 million people. Some
of the customers made a mad dash for the newly added stations.
   ``People are satisfied because they can at least get gasoline
now,'' said Magnuszewski.
   State-run TV reported the new regulations and said customers
interviewed had thanked the state gas monopoly for the opportunity
to buy unrationed gas.
   The impatient customers at station No. 560 seemed to think
otherwise.
   ``It's a bad idea _ a scandal. It's very uncomfortable to stand
in this crowd of machines. I see the crowd and I don't want to
stand in line,'' said Krzystof Tom. He ultimately took a place in
line.
   Some people feared the new regulations are a government ruse to
raise prices even further.
   The government announced the regulations Tuesday.
   The Central Oil Products Monopoly initially planned to make the
unrationed gasoline available at 64 gas stations nationwide.
   The State Monopolys' director Jerzy Szewczyk said about 60
million gallons non-rationed gasoline would be sold at the higher
price this year, less than 10 percent of all gasoline to be sold in
Poland, and that if demand exceeded supply the price would be
raised.
   A sufficient supply of gas is a constant concern for Polish car
owners. Under current regulations, every private car owner receives
a monthly gas ration based on the car size.
   Owners of small cars are entitled to 6.2 gallons, while those
with medium and large cars can get 9.4 gallons. Additional gasoline
could be purchased on a black-market basis at some stations, but
even that source does not meet demand.
   The government introduced rationing in mid-1981 when panic
buying during the Solidarity period resulted in periodic shortages.
   Most of the oil Poland needs to manufacture gasoline comes from
the Soviet Union which has been reluctant to increase supplies to
its East bloc allies, especially now that it too faces energy
shortages. Poland lacks hard currency to buy much crude on the
world market.

<NOTE>EDS: UPDATES thruout with Shultz meeting with Arias. No pickup.</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz
met today with President Oscar Arias after discussing with
Nicaraguan rebels possible ways of making Arias' regional peace
plan succeed.
   Hundreds of flag-waving Costa Rican children greeted Shultz
after he flew here following visits to Guatemala, Honduras and El
Salvador.
   Shultz is on the last stop of his three-day Central American
tour. He spent Thursday night in Guatemala City. Adolfo Calero, a
leader of the Nicaraguan rebels, said today in Guatemala that the
administration and pro-rebel members of Congress are considering a
$30 million aid package for the rebels over a six-month period.
   A portion of the money, perhaps $7 million, would be placed in
an escrow account and released as military aid for the Contras if
Nicaragua's government does not meet democratic reforms mandated in
Arias' peace plan, Calero said.
   There was no immediate word on what Shultz and Arias discussed.
Administration officials said Shultz and rebel leaders only touched
briefly on the Contra issue.
   Arias won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1987 for drawing up a plan
that calls for cease-fires in Central America's wars, democratic
reforms, and an end to outside aid to insurgents.
   Shultz met with the rebel leadership after visiting El Salvador
and Honduras for talks with top officials Thursday. He began his
Central American tour in Guatemala Wednesday.
   Shultz said Thursday in Tegucigalpa, Honduras, that he has
shared ideas with Central American leaders on a diplomatic solution
to the Nicaraguan problem, but he gave no details.
   He said he planned to discuss these ideas with President Reagan
and members of Congress after his return to Washington.
   Contra supporters in the Congress have been discussing the
possibility of seeking approval for new military aid for the rebels
to be placed in an escrow account.
   The Contras have received no military aid since Feb. 29, and
congressional approval of a new package of lethal assistance
without conditions is thought to have scant support among lawmakers.
   Congress approved a $17 million humanitarian aid package in late
March after the rebels and the Sandinista government agreed on an
interim cease-fire.
   Efforts by the Sandinistas and the Contras to reach agreement on
a permanent cease-fire broke down June 9 and no new talks have been
scheduled.
   The Contras have said the Sandinistas backed away from their
earlier promises to enact democratic reforms. The Sandinistas have
said the Contras were just using the talks as a pretext to get more
U.S. military aid.
   A senior U.S. official who briefed reporters after Shultz'
meeting with the Contras said the possibility of resuming
negotiations was discussed.
   So far, the administration has said only that it plans to seek
renewed aid for the Contras, but no final decision on a package was
to be made until after Shultz's trip.
   The administration, by weighing the possibility of offering U.S.
assistance to the Sandinistas, appears to believe that Nicaragua
may be receptive to a proposal that would benefit it economically.
   Despite massive support from the Soviet bloc, the Nicaraguan
economy has continued to unravel, crippled by the civil war.
   On several occasions during his Central America trip, Shultz has
quoted Sandinista officials as saying Nicaragua's inflation rate
this year is running at 20,000 percent.
   Economic aid would be a sharp reversal of Reagan administration
policy. In addition to funding the Contras, the administration has
a trade embargo against Nicaragua.

   Four members of the same family were
stabbed to death and a fifth was wounded in an attack at two homes,
and police said they arrested a relative about a block from the
scene.
   Joselito C. Camangian, 23, an amusement park worker, was booked
today on four counts of investigation of homicide, said police
Detective Pat Kolstad said.
   The survivor, Candida Camangian, 26, was in serious condition at
Santa Clara Valley Medical Center after the Thursday night attack,
said nursing supervisor Carrie Wickware.
   Candida Camangian is the suspect's sister. Her twin sister, a
brother, a cousin and 15-year-old niece died.
   The supect was a native of the Philippines who came to Santa
Clara about five months ago, police said.
   ``We don't know the motive yet,'' said Kolstad. He added that
Camangian offered no resistance when he was arrested.
   An uncle, Elmer Gale, said he was preparing for his night job
when he heard a pounding at his door.
   ``I heard Candida (Camangian) yelling, `Uncle, uncle, please
open the door. My brother is stabbing my sister','' Gale said
today, adding that she then flung herself on him and sobbed, ``Lito
is stabbing my brother, too.''
   Gale said he slipped out a rear door and ran to a gas station to
telephone police. As he was calling, he said, Joselito Camangian
walked up.
   ``I was astonished, he was calm,'' a weary, shaking Gale
recalled. ``Then he tells me, `Uncle, I don't know what I did. Call
the police. I don't know what I did.'''

   The U.S. missile frigate Samuel B.
Roberts headed for home Friday, riding out of the Persian Gulf on
the back of another ship 11 weeks after an Iranian mine nearly sank
it.
   The 3,600-ton warship rode in a special cradle atop the Mighty
Servant 2, a heavy-lift cargo vessel the Navy chartered from a
Dutch salvage firm for $1.3 million.
   Emergency repairs to the frigate's badly ripped hull were made
at Dubai. Its early morning departure from the emirate in the
southern gulf was a surprise because U.S. military officials had
indicated earlier the Roberts would pass through the narrow Strait
of Hormuz at night for security reasons.
   As the Mighty Servant 2 and its piggyback cargo approached the
strait, the The U.S. missile cruiser Vincennes fired an artillery
salute. The Vincennes was on patrol near Hormuz, where Iran has
threatened shipping with gunboats and missile batteries since early
in its 8-year-old war with Iraq.
   About 30 of its crew members are accompanying the Roberts to
Newport, R.I., on a trip expected to take about 40 days. U.S.
officials said the frigate would be rebuilt at the shipyard in
Bath, Maine, where it was launched in 1986.
   Officials have denied reports the $400 million ship would be
scrapped, but hull damage from the April 14 mine explosion was so
extensive that salvage experts advised against trying to tow it
across the stormy Atlantic.
   Departure of the ``Sammy B.,'' as crewmen called their ship,
came 11 weeks to the day after it sailed inadvertently into what
U.S. officers said was a newly laid Iranian minefield and collided
with a submerged mine while trying to back out.
   Ten crewmen were wounded in the explosion, which wrecked the
engine room, broke the keel of the 453-foot vessel and started
fires and flooding.
   U.S. forces retaliated with attacks on two Iranian oil platforms
April 18 that led to a day of confrontation in the southern gulf in
which six Iranian naval craft were sunk or disabled.
   The Mighty Servant 2 is a ``semi-submersible'' ship, described
as one of only two in the world capable of carrying the Samuel B.
Roberts home. Both are owned by the the Dutch salvage firm
Wijsmuller Transport.
   Earlier in the week, the frigate was towed out of Dubai and
floated over the submerged deck of the cargo vessel, which was then
raised to normal level, leaving the Roberts high and dry.

   Thursday was the 49-year-old disc jockey's last day spinning the

``They've been paying me a lot of money, so I sure wouldn't leave

   XTRA-AM is a 50,000-watt station in Tijuana, Mexico, near the

   About 6,000 pounds of cocaine concealed
in blocks of melted chocolate was confiscated and three men were
arrested in what authorities described today as the largest seizure
of cocaine in the Northeast.
   The drugs have a street value of about $480 million, said Robert
Stutman, head of the federal Drug Enforcement Agency in New York.
   The cocaine was discovered June 24 aboard a U.S. cargo ship
coming from Ecuador into Port Newark, N.J., said U.S. Customs Agent
Peter Baish, in charge of the Newark office. Baish said it was a
``cold hit,'' meaning inspectors had no previous tip about the
shipment.
   He said inspectors decided to drill a hole in several of 1,200
cardboard cartons marked cocoa because it had come from Ecuador, a
frequent exporter of cocaine.
   The smugglers had poured melted chocolate on the bottom of each
carton, concealed the cocaine in a metal container and plastic
sleeve in the center and then poured melted chocolate over it,
letting it harden, Baish said.
   At least 779 of the cartons had cocaine in the middle, said
Stutman. He said officials were still opening the boxes.
   Customs agents resealed the boxes and watched as they were taken
to Toronto Imports Inc. in an industrial section of Hicksville on
Thursday, Baish said.
   When the men inside the warehouse began opening the boxes, some
50 law enforcement agents moved in, Stutman said.
   He said the three men arrested are believed to be connected to
the Ochoa family in Medellin, Colombia, which he described as one
of the largest producers and exporters of cocaine.
   They were identified as Absalon Borrero, 42, of Miami; Jaime
Caro, 48, of Anza, Colombia; and Oscar Nunez, 28, of Queens.
Stutman said they were charged with importation and distribution of
cocaine and conspiracy to distribute cocaine.

   Soviet President Andrei A. Gromyko was honored
with the chairmanship of a session of the national Communist Party
conference on Friday, one day after he was criticized for
contributing to the country's stagnation.
   Soviet television showed Gromyko, 78, standing at a lectern in
the Kremlin's Palace of Congress as he opened the morning session.
   On Thursday, Vladimir I. Melnikov, party boss in the Russian
republic's region of Komi, told the conference that Soviets want
high officials who served under Leonid I. Brezhnev removed.
   ``Those who in the past actively promoted the policy of
stagnation may not serve and work on the central party and
government bodies now,'' Melnikov said.
   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev interrupted to ask who
Melnikov had in mind, and among those the Komi official listed was
Gromyko.
   The official news agency Tass said a delegate later sent a note
to the conference organizers saying Gromyko, who spent 28 years as
foreign minister, had devoted his life to communism.
   But it added: ``We have worked him too hard. And comrade Gromyko
today has fallen behind the times.''
   When Gromyko was named to the largely ceremonial post of
president in 1985, observers believed this was a graceful way to
move the elder statesman out of the mainstream of Soviet
policy-making. The criticism of him at the conference might
indicate he will be eased out of the leadership entirely.
   The chairmanship of the conference is also largely ceremonial
and was rotated among most of the 13 members of the party's ruling
Politburo. Another of Melnikov's targets, Mikhail S. Solomentsev,
74, head of the party's Control Commission, chaired Friday's
afternoon session.

   When Rep. Lee Hamilton was picked to chair the
House panel investigating the Iran-Contra affair, the
well-respected but relatively little-known Indiana Democrat found
himself thrust into the limelight.
   During the weeks of nationally televised joint House and Senate
hearings, amid a cast of colorful characters like Fawn Hall and
Oliver North, Hamilton displayed the traits he was best known for
on Capitol Hill _ caution, fairness, even-handedness.
   When the hearings ended, Hamilton resumed his usual low profile.
But in recent weeks, he's been flirting with fame again, mentioned
as a possible running mate for Democratic nominee-to-be Michael
Dukakis.
   Hamilton appeared with Dukakis as the Massachusetts governor
made a campaign visit to Indiana on Thursday night. At a town
meeting in Terre Haute, local Democrats were selling
Dukakis-Hamilton buttons for a dollar each.
   ``Not bad, not bad,'' Dukakis said when he was presented with
one. ``Has kind of a nice ring to it, doesn't it?''
   Dukakis aides say the two got acquainted at a dinner before
Indiana's May 3 primary, which Dukakis won handily.
   ``I think there is a great deal of mutual respect,'' said
Dukakis spokesman Mark Gearan.
   Hamilton's office says he has complied with the Dukakis
campaign's request for detailed background information being sought
from prospective running mates on everything from his finances to
his driving record.
   Christopher Edley, issues director for the Dukakis campaign,
said the Massachusetts governor has consulted Hamilton on a variety
of issues, particularly foreign affairs.
   Hamilton, 57, joined the House Foreign Affairs Committee as a
freshman congressman in 1965. He is now second in line behind
Chairman Dante Fascell and is seen as likely to come into the
chairmanship eventually. After the 1984 election, he was picked to
chair the House Intelligence Committee.
   Many observers believe Dukakis will choose a running mate with
strong foreign affairs experience to make up for his own lack of
background in that area.
   But even with his foreign-policy expertise as a selling point,
Hamilton's chances of being tapped for the No. 2 spot on the
Democratic ticket appear remote. He himself plays down the prospect.
   ``I guess I still feel it would be rather unusual for him to
come to Indiana for a nominee,'' Hamilton told the Indianapolis
News. ``We're a relatively small state. We don't have a large
number of electoral votes.''
   And Hamilton might not even be able to deliver his home state in
the general election. Indiana is traditionally Republican.
   However, that rule doesn't seem to apply in Hamilton's district.
He was elected by a landslide in 1964 and has won re-election by
large margins. In 1976, the Republicans didn't even bother fielding
a candidate.
   The son of a Methodist minister, Hamilton shares some
personality traits with Dukakis. Neither could be described as
flamboyant. Both are cerebral types, lawyerly lawyers.
   They have in common a dogged competitive streak. Hamilton was a
high school basketball star in Evansville, Ind., leading his team
to the state finals, and he played college basketball at Depauw
University.
   Like Dukakis, Hamilton has a reputation for being earnest and
strait-laced. Hamilton for decades has sported a 1950s-style crew
cut. He told an interviewer last year that he has let his hair grow
out only once _ while he was attending Goethe University in
Frankfurt, West Germany on scholarship before going to law school
at Indiana University.
   ``It was the only time I ever let my hair grow long,'' he said.
``I just wasn't comfortable with it.''
   Hamilton appears to share Dukakis' conviction that a
well-managed government can cure many ills. When the Iran-Contra
hearings ended, many of the committee members, especially
Democrats, expressed dismay about the foreign-policy fiasco that
had unfolded in the testimony they heard.
   Hamilton agreed with his fellow legislators that the hearings
had been ``depressing.'' But he also struck a positive note, saying
``the process has been refreshing.''
   ``We know better what happened and what mistakes were made,''
Hamilton said. ``We can see more clearly what needs to be done to
make our system work better.''

<DATELINE>PRICE'S CORNER, Del. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Along just 35 miles of interstate,
State Police Cpl. Robert J. Durnan confiscated $7 million worth of
drugs, money and guns last year during otherwise routine stops for
traffic violations.
   ``You get a sense like you're absolutely doing something good,''
said Durnan, who isn't sure how many arrests he made on Delaware's
short segment of I-95. ``Nothing beats the thrill of making that
arrest.''
   Durnan, 35, is one of a special breed that federal Drug
Enforcement Administration official Ron Gospodarek calls ``super
cops.''
   In 33 states, highway patrol officers on routine patrol are part
of ``Operation Pipeline,'' using traffic stops to collar criminals
and make big drug busts instead of just writing speeding tickets,
he said.
   Nationwide, 8{ percent of the nation's cocaine seizures in 1987
were executed during traffic stops and $18.6 million in cash was
seized, according to the DEA.
   ``Operation Pipeline,'' which began slowly in 1983-84, has
forced a nationwide rerouting of drug traffic, said Gospodarek, who
coordinates the program.
   But it is also drawing criticism from defense lawyers and the
American Civil Liberties Union, who contend the stops are pretenses
for drug searches and therefore violate the Fourth Amendment
prohibition against unlawful search and seizure.
   In some cases the stops are discriminatory, said Atlanta
attorney Don Samuel.
   ``The real question is whether the people are stopped for
absolutely legitimate reasons and subsequently an officer's
suspicion is aroused and he then asks consent. Or if a cop sees two
Hispanic males in a Cadillac with Florida plates and sees them
going 66 mph _ that's not a legitimate stop,'' said Samuel.
   Samuel said the courts have not ruled definitively on the issue.
   ``Some courts say if the car's going 66 mph in a 65 mph zone,
that's a reasonable stop,'' he said. ``Other courts say if the only
person stopped is a Hispanic male driving a Cadillac _ that's not
reasonable.''
   State police and DEA officials say the key to the arrests is
good police work and that they do not have a profile of the type of
person to pull over.
   ``It's strictly a traffic officer who makes a legal traffic stop
and looks beyond it,'' said Gospodarek. ``A lot of troopers making
the seizures are the same guys over and over _ they're super cops.''
   The officers say their success is based on awareness.
   ``I believe after you've made your first one, it just gets in
your system. The adrenalin gets flowing,'' said Georgia State
Patrol Officer Mike Ralston, 34, who patrols I-75, a northward
route out of Florida. ``It makes you want to get back out there and
make another one.''
   ``I got it bad, I'll stay out there all night,'' said another
Georgia State Patrol officer, Benji Hodges. DEA estimates 15.4
pounds of cocaine an hour pass through Georgia on the interstate,
he said.
   Hodges, 27, and Ralston each seized about 400 pounds of cocaine
last year.
   ``It's a lot of fun, you never know what you'll get into,''
Hodges said.
   After making a traffic stop, officers look for a number of signs.
   Among those listed by Durnan, Hodges and other officers were
nervousness, signs of false walls or altered gas tanks, the smell
of air freshener, conflicting stories from driver and passenger, or
the driver of a car not listed as stolen who can't identify the
owner.
   Officers then ask permission to search the car or get a search
warrant, Gospodarek said.
   He and other officers interviewed said rarely does a driver
refuse consent.
   Albuquerque, N.M., defense attorney Nancy Hollander says that's
because stopped drivers aren't often asked. But several officers
said it's because traffickers are confident the drugs are well
hidden.
   Drug traffickers attempt to avoid areas of high numbers of
arrests, but they don't always succeed.
   New Jersey State Police Detective Walter Butz said he and his
colleagues have made ``lots of arrests where they had maps to avoid
New Jersey.'' He said the traffickers got lazy and ignored their
route instructions.

<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young says Jesse Jackson
is a realist and won't press a request to be Michael Dukakis'
running mate if it means the Democrats will lose in November.
   ``Every poll I've seen shows that the only instance in which
Dukakis is losing to George Bush is with Jesse Jackson on the
ticket,'' Young said Thursday.
   ``The Democratic party isn't suicidal, and neither is Jesse
Jackson. The last thing he wants to be is the vice presidential
nominee on a losing ticket,'' said Young.
   The mayor, in Cincinnati to speak at a black achievers banquet,
said having Sen. John Glenn of Ohio on the ticket would be an asset
for the Democrats.
   ``I think very highly of John Glenn,'' Young said. ``He has a
lot of credibility on issues such as defense, and would be
extraordinarily valuable to the ticket.''
   Young, an early associate of the late civil rights leader Martin
Luther King Jr., was ambassador to the United Nations during the
Carter administration. He is in his second term as mayor of Atlanta.

<HEAD>Office, Factory Construction Improved Building Outlook in May</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Construction spending advanced 1.1 percent in
May as strength in office and factory construction offset weakness
in other areas, the government reported Friday.
   The Commerce Department said building activity rose to a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of $407.1 billion in May following
a 0.2 percent dip in April.
   The May gain, the strongest since a 2.8 percent rise in March,
came entirely from gains in non-residential construction, which
rose 4.3 percent to an annual rate of $98.9 billion.
   The increase was led by a 7.8 percent advance in office
construction, which pushed this category up by 11 percent over May
1987, and a 7.7 percent advance in factory construction, where
activity was 22.8 percent higher than a year ago.
   Analysts said the rise in office construction, after a sustained
period of weakness, reflected strong activity in certain sections
of the country such as the Northeast and a halt to the giant plunge
in building which had occurred in the Southwest, hard hit because
of troubles in the oil patch.
   ``Cities such as Chicago, New York, Boston and Washington, D.C.,
are enjoying good economic growth and a fair amount of offfice
construction,'' said Richard Peach, senior economist for the
Mortgage Bankers Association. ``This is happening while the sharp
declines in other areas have at least bottomed out.''
   Peach said the big jump in factory construction reflected the
capital spending boom occuring as manufacturers rush to expand
capacity to meet sharply higher demand for U.S. exports.
   Residential construction fell 1 percent during May to an annual
rate of $193.4 billion, reflecting a 1.3 percent drop in
construction of single-family homes which offset a 2.4 percent rise
in the smaller apartment sector. Analysts do not expect much
strength in this area during the year, particularly because of high
vacancy rates in the apartment sector and the loss of tax
advantages for investing in housing real estate.
   Government construction projects edged down 0.3 percent in May
to an annual rate of $78.9 billion with highway construction, the
biggest segment in the government sector, suffering a 7.4 percent
decline.
   The various changes left overall construction spending 2.3
percent higher than it was a year ago.

   All they needed were nails and maybe
motorists could have done something constructive during the Friday
morning commute.
   Just before 7 a.m. a tanker truck was involved in a multivehicle
collision, spilling white latex paint across the westbound lanes,
divider and an eastbound lane of the San Bernardino Freeway.
   A little later a truck dropped 74,000 pounds of wallboard on the
northbound Pasadena Freeway.
   The paint spill in Baldwin Park was expected to shut down that
freeway at least until noon, said California Highway Patrol Officer
Mike Maas.
   The tanker driver suffered moderate injuries, Maas said.
   Two of the Pasadena Freeway's northbound lanes were blocked when
two trailers loaded with plasterboard overturned about 8:15 a.m.,
said CHP spokesman Dwight McDonald. There were no injuries.

   A new library will be named after a U.S.
Navy spy ship that Israel attacked in 1967, despite complaints the
action might be viewed as anti-Semitic.
   The Library Board on Thursday approved calling the building the
USS Liberty Memorial Public Library. Industrialist Benjamin Grob
and his brother, Theodore, said the name would have to be used when
they donated $250,000 toward the $1.1 million library.
   Thirty-four American sailors died in the attack on the Liberty
during the Six Day War. Israel officially apologized and paid
reparations.
   Critics said the Liberty had been used to generate hatred
against Jews and Israel.
   ``It is unfortunate they made a selection that will make a large
group of people in metropolitan Milwaukee very uncomfortable,''
said Howard Schoenfeld, president of the Milwaukee Jewish Council.
   Library board officials insisted the name was meant to honor the
sailors who died.

<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court has refused to
allow the Reagan administration to begin random drug testing of all
13,000 federal prison employees during an appeal of a ruling
prohibiting the program.
   In an order made public Friday, Judges Dorothy Nelson and
William Norris of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals denied the
administration's request to let the testing program proceed while
the case is appealed.
   U.S. District Judge Stanley Weigel blocked the program from
taking effect as scheduled May 23 and then issued a preliminary
injunction June 16 that continues the ban until a union's lawsuit
against the program goes to trial.
   Weigel said the government had shown no justification for
testing ``innocent, law-abiding and wholly competent'' workers. He
noted that the proposed drug testing would apply to clerical
employees outside the prison walls as well as armed guards.
   The Bureau of Prisons is appealing his ruling and asked the
appeals court for a stay that would have allowed testing to begin.
   The bureau was to have been one of the first federal agencies to
implement drug testing under a September 1986 executive order by
President Reagan, who ordered testing of all federal workers in
``sensitive'' jobs. The bureau has declared all of its employees
hold ``sensitive'' jobs.
   The program would require random testing of 5 percent to 10
percent of the Bureau of Prisons staff each year, with additional
testing of managers, probationary employees, and those involved in
accidents. Workers showing signs of illegal drug use could be
disciplined the first time and fired the second time.
   The suit by the American Federation of Government Employees
contends drug testing without individual suspicion of drug use
violates the constitutional ban on unreasonable searches and
seizures. The suit also claims violations of federal laws banning
discrimination against the handicapped and requiring discipline to
be based on job performance.
   The Supreme Court has agreed to rule on Reagan administration
drug testing programs involving customs employees and railroad
workers, in cases to be heard in the term that begins this fall.

<DATELINE>AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Salvage workers today resumed
efforts to raise a sunken tanker after toxic chemicals began
leaking from the ship, Dutch television reported.
   Television reports said workers sawed the Dutch chemical tanker
Anna Broere into two pieces and planned to hoist the parts from the
floor of the North Sea. It said none of the highly poisonous
acrylonitrile stored in tanks escaped during the operation.
   On Thursday, salvage crews had to flee when an acrylonitrile
tank suddenly sprang a leak during efforts to lift the ship, a
coast guard spokesman said. No injuries were reported.
   Workers used a 16-ton chain to separate the ship's back section,
which contains the engine room, from the front part where the tanks
are located, the television report said.
   Crews have been trying to salvage the ship and its dangerous
cargo since May 27, when the Anna Broere sank after a collision
with a freighter off the Netherlands' west coast. It was carrying
1,600 tons of acrylonitrile, a highly carcinogenic and inflammable
agent used by the plastics industry.
   The two sections were expected to lifted to the surface during
the weekend, the report said.
   Water samples taken during Thursday's salvage attempt showed a
sudden increase in the levels of acrylonitrile in the water at the
site, according to a coast guard official, who spoke on condition
of anonymity.
   He said that at about 9.30 p.m. Thursday, those levels rose to
more than seven times the amount considered safe by the Dutch
environment ministry.
   The divers immediately boarded small boats kept nearby for
emergencies after the release of the toxic chemicals, the spokesman
said.
   A first attempt to salvage the Anna Broere failed when two of
the four steel cables holding the vessel broke, causing the ship to
disappear in the waves again.

   Grasshoppers and other insects left hungry by
the drought are wreaking havoc on what remains in farm fields,
while young trees are depending on young people scooping buckets of
water from city lakes to sustain them.
   The good news is a low mosquito population this summer _ but
``I'd rather have the moisture on my grass,'' says Ross Green of
the Metropolitan Mosquito Control District in St. Paul.
   Yellowjackets and wasps may take the place of mosquitoes and be
more aggressive at picnics and near garbage cans as they search for
food, said University of Minnesota entomologist Jeffrey Hahn.
   ``It could be that they just die from a lack of food. But it
also could be that they will be driven to interact with people when
they might not normally do that,'' he said.
   Other insects also are taking a toll.
   ``We've definitely seen more treatment for grasshoppers than at
any time I remember,'' said Carlyle Holen, area extension agent in
crop pest management in northwestern Minnesota's Crookston office.
   ``Many thousands of acres have been treated over the past month,
and there still are fields that need treatment that perhaps the
farmers haven't even discovered yet,'' he said.
   Wheat-stem maggots, normally found in 1 percent of the fields in
the Red River Valley, are showing up this summer in 30 percent to
40 percent of the fields, Holen said. The maggots sever wheat and
barley stems.
   Dry weather appears to be responsible for a large drop in the
number of European corn borers that feed on corn plant leaves and
later bore into the stem.
   Record dryness coupled with near-record heat during the past few
months has stressed young trees and forced wildlife to change their
habits.
   Young trees planted in Minneapolis over the past several years
to replace those ravaged by Dutch elm disease are facing the dual
threat of insufficient moisture and hungry insects such as aphids
and bark beetles, said Hahn.
   The Minneapolis Park Board this week recruited 260 inner-city
young people to dip buckets into the city's lakes and pour the
water on young trees nearby. The lakes, highly popular for sailing,
swimming and picnicking, are down slightly.
   The city already maintains its 160,000 young trees planted in
the past 10 years with 23 water trucks. But the concern now is to
spread the word via the bucket brigade to homeowners.
   ``We thought that if people down at the lakes saw all the kids
down there watering the trees that are starting to wilt and dry,
people will catch on to the news that many of the small trees are
wilting and severely stressed and that they all should be out there
watering,'' said Parks Board special projects director Paul Domholt.
   Minneapolis, which draws all its water from the depleted
Mississippi River, has instituted limited lawn sprinkling
restrictions; adjacent St. Paul is seeking voluntary conservation.
Both cities have agreed to take stronger measures if the river
falls below a certain point.
   Duck-hunters face a shortened waterfowl season this year as the
birds move to regions with more moisture in search of nesting
sites, said Tim Bremicker, resource manager for the Minnesota
Department of Natural Resources.
   ``The drought quickly deteriorated a lot of the good breeding
wetlands,'' Bremicker said. ``The ducks then delay nesting or they
don't nest at all. They move into the northern parklands in
Minnesota, where we still have a lot of water _ comparatively.''
   Biologists also are concerned about other game.
   ``Any animal has a preferred climate, and when you move outside
that preferred climate birds or mammals become stressed,''
Bremicker said.

   The nation's three largest rivers set a
combined low-water record in June, running 45 percent below normal
for the month, the U.S. Geological Survey reported Friday.
   The Mississippi, normally the nation's largest river, slipped to
third place in terms of water flow, survey figures showed.
   Falling river levels, resulting from the nation's ongoing
drought, have stalled barge traffic, threatened water quality and
reduced availability of water for drinking and other uses.
   The June flow of the Mississippi, St. Lawrence and Columbia
rivers marked a decline from May, when their flow was 37 percent
below normal, the survey reported. Their total flow had been 8
percent below average in April, which is considered within the
normal range.
   The combined flow of the Big Three rivers averaged 481 billion
gallons per day during June, the agency said.
   The lowest previous combined June flow for the three, in 60
years of record keeping, was 484 billion gallons per day in 1934.
   Water experts monitor the three rivers as a quick check of the
nation's surface water resources, since they drain about half of
the 48 contiguous states.
   For June, the nation's largest river turned out to be the
Columbia, which averaged 182 billion gallons per day at The Dalles,
Ore. Even so, that was 42 percent below normal and the fourth
lowest in 60 years of record keeping. In May it had been 27 percent
below normal for the month.
   Second place for June went to the St. Lawrence River, which
averaged 162 billion gallons per day, measured at Massena, N.Y.
That was 11 percent below normal but not in record-low contention.
It was the first time the St. Lawrence fell below normal since July
1967.
   The Mississippi, though, fell to its lowest June level ever at
the Vicksburg, Miss., measuring station. It managed only 136
billion gallons per day, 4 billion below the old record from June
1934 and 61 percent below normal for the month. In May, the
Mississippi had its second lowest flow for the month, trailing May
of 1934.
   The Geological Survey also reported that the Ohio River
decreased sharply in June, averaging 17 billion gallons per day at
Louisville, Ky. That was 59 percent below normal for the month and
the sixth lowest ever.
   And the Missouri, at Hermann, Mo., averaged 30 billion gallons
per day, 46 percent below normal and the third lowest flow on
record.

   More than 10,000 workers went on strike
Friday against Electric Boat, maker of the Navy's nuclear
submarines and the largest employer in the area, and no new
contract talks were scheduled.
   The members of unions belonging to the Metal Trades Council
walked off their jobs at midnight after voting 4,921-3,140 to
reject the company's offer to pay them lump-sum bonuses in each of
the next three years instead of higher wages.
   Negotations between the MTC, which represents more than half of
Electric Boat's 18,000 workers, broke down about a half-hour before
the old three-year contract expired at midnight Thursday.
   State Labor Commissioner Betty L. Tianti said state mediators
had been in touch with both sides, but neither side seemed
interested in meeting.
   About 300 workers, some chanting obscenties, picketed outside
four gates Friday morning. About 80 state and local police stood
by. The pickets dwindled to about 50 by mid-afternoon.
   Police reported arrests of two men, one accused of setting off
fireworks and the other accused of driving his car through police
barricades in front of the plant.
   Owners of bars and liquor stores near the plant on the Thames
River followed police requests to close Thursday and Friday.
Grocery stores also stopped selling beer.
   The last MTC strike against Electric Boat lasted five months in
1975 and had an estimated $42 million ripple-effect on the economy
of southeastern Connecticut.
   Electric Boat, a division of General Dynamics Corp., is one of
two shipyards making nuclear submarines for the Navy and the only
manufacturer of giant subs capable of carrying the Trident missile.
   The shipyard has eight attack submarines and seven Trident
submarines under construction, officials said.
   EB general manager Fritz Tovar said a strike will not stop
construction. The company arranged to reassign salaried employees,
he said, adding there was also the possibility of hiring permanent
replacements and subcontractors.
   EB offered employees bonuses worth 5 percent of a worker's wages
during the first contract year and 4 percent during the second and
third years of the pact. The union demanded wage increases of 5
percent, 4 percent and 4 percent.
   Electric Boat's ``last, best and final offer,'' presented
Monday, called for bonuses totaling $4,250 over three years for a
first-class mechanic making $12.02 an hour, said Thomas Sotir, vice
president of human resources.
   Electric Boat insisted it could afford no more than cash bonuses
to remain competitive in its pursuit of Navy contracts.
   The Navy on Thursday awarded Electric Boat this year's third and
final SSN-688 attack submarine contract, worth $347.4 million.
Contracts for two other attack subs were awarded recently to
Electric Boat's only rival, the Newport News Shipbuilding and
Drydock Co. of Virginia, which pays its workers 60 cents an hour
less.

   Cleaning up environmental contamination and
correcting existing problems at the nation's nuclear weapons plants
could cost between $40 billion and $70 billion, according to a
government report released Friday.
   And the Department of Energy report said the price tag could be
as high as $110 billion in order to maintain the environmental,
safety and health standards at the plants through the year 2045.
   The report was released by Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, who had
requested it as chairman of the Senate Governmental Affairs
Committee.
   Glenn said the report puts a price tag on the department's
``shameful neglect'' toward the health and safety of the public.
   ``We have a choice of paying the price with money or with the
health and safety of our children and grandchildren,'' Glenn said.
``Those who would choose to poison our own people in order to make
nuclear weapons should be asked what the weapons are supposed to
protect us from.''
   The department issued two sets of estimates: an ``expected''
projection representing the most likely requirements for each site;
and a ``high'' projection of what could be required to meet more
stringent interpretations of existing laws, regulations and
policies that could reasonably be imposed on the defense plants.
   ``Within those bounds, the cleanup of contaminated sites and
corrective actions could require between $40 billion and $70
billion in addition to an ongoing base program of $700 million per
year,'' the department concluded.
   However, Glenn said the estimate does not include the cost of
high-level waste disposal, long-term monitoring, the
decommissioning of abandoned nuclear reactors and modernizing the
weapons complex.
   ``The figure of $110 billion is labeled a `high' estimate by
DOE, but I believe it is more likely to be a floor rather than a
ceiling,'' Glenn said.
   The department's evaluation included 18 defense plants. It said
most of the remedial cleanup actions could be completed within 20
years.
   Environmental corrective actions could include such things as
improvements in stack exhaust, construction of radioactive waste
treatment facilities, upgrading drinking water supplies and other
activities.
   The department cautioned that the cost projections do not
represent proposed action by the Reagan administration. It said the
report identifies ``needs'' and will be used to formulate
long-range plans, but that a decision to adopt the actions has not
been made.
   By far the largest single price tag for cleanup and corrective
actions is for the Hanford nuclear reservation in Richland, Wash.
The facility, established in 1943, recycles uranium and extracts
plutonium from irradiated nuclear fuel.
   The department estimated that cleanup and other costs at Hanford
could reach $48 billion and that it could take until the year 2045
to complete the job.
   ``The Department of Energy has finally admitted the size and the
scope of the defense waste cleanup problems at Hanford,'' said Sen.
Brock Adams, D-Wash., adding that when estimated costs of other
projects not included in the report are added, the total price tag
for Hanford could reach $64 billion.
   The department said a sampling of possible major environmental
projects at the defense production plants includes:
   _An environmental restoration program at Los Alamos National
Laboratory in New Mexico, $1.4 billion.
   _Environmental restoration at the Hanford site, $650 million.
   _A buried waste program at Idaho National Engineering Laboratory
in Arco, Idaho, $500 million.
   _Environmental restoration at the Rocky Flats plant in Golden,
Colo., $345 million.
   _A basin closure program at the Savannah River plant in Aiken,
S.C., $70 million.
   _Groundwater and soil investigations at Lawrence Livermore
National Laboratory in Livermore, Calif., $59 million.
   _Waste pit and silo cleanup at the Feed Materials Production
Center near Fernald, Ohio, $40 million.
   _Cleanup of polychlorinated biphenyls at the Portsmouth Gaseous
Diffusion Plant near Piketon, Ohio; $38 million.
   _Environmental, health and safety actions at the Mound plant in
Miamisburg, Ohio, $30 million.
   The agency also said major safety and health projects could
include plantwide fire protection at the Savannah River plant, $200
million; an upgrade of the ventilation system at the Fernald plant,
$55 million; and an asbestos management program at Los Alamos, $52
million.

<HEAD>New Traditionalist Bishop Says Fight Just Beginning</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HANNS NEUERBOURG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of a traditionalist Roman Catholic
seminary in Connecticut, who was excommunicated as soon as he
became a bishop, said Friday he feels ``some sorrow'' for Pope John
Paul II and the fight has just begun.
   Bishop Richard Williamson also said history will prove
Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre, who consecrated four bishops Thursday
in defiance of the pope, is right in opposing modernism in the
church. The Vatican excommunicated all five men after the ceremony
in Econe, Switzerland.
   Williamson, a Briton who converted from the Anglican Church,
recalled that the early Christian theologian Athanasius was
excommunicated in the 4th century but eventually made a saint.
Athanasius was a champion of orthodoxy in the 4th century intrigues
over what became known as the Arian heresy.
   ``It was proved that Athanasius was right all along,'' he told
The Associated Press in a telephone interview from Econe, the site
of Lefebvre's Swiss seminary.
   The schism created by the consecrations and resulting
excommunications was the first major split in the church since the
so-called Old Catholics broke with Rome in 1870 after the doctrine
of papal infallibility was proclaimed.
   When asked what practical consequences he expected the Vatican
sanction to bring, Williamson said:
   ``The fight has just started. I hope that the issues begin to
clear and we will come out of this dreamland in which the devil has
got vast numbers of people asleep, completely unaware there is a
problem. The archbishop said today that he hopes this event will
lance the abscess of modernist Rome.''
   Williamson shrugged off a statement by Vatican spokesman Joaquin
Navarro, who predicted 80 percent of Lefebvre's followers will
leave him after the excommunication.
   ``Poor Father Navarro,'' he said. ``He lives in a different
world than from the world I live in.''
   He was asked whether followers might be shocked by a sentence in
Lefebvre's letter to the four new bishops that mentioned
``antichrists occupying the chair of Peter and the posts of
authority in Rome.''
   In response, he said Christians believe there are ``many
antichrists'' doing the work of ``the Antichrist, the one who is
coming at the end of the world.''
   ``Any enemy of the church is an antichrist,'' he said. ``It is
strong language but you have to remember what the church was 30
years ago and see it today. There is no comparison. There has been
a tremendous work of destruction since the Second Vatican Council.''
   His reference was to the 1962-65 council that produced reforms
Lefebvre says are spreading the ``cancer of liberalism'' in the
church.
   Williamson said he was ``not sorry that the archbishop refused
to enter into any compromise with those who do not understand
tradition.''
   To a question about whether the traditionalists were in schism,
he replied that church documents prove Lefbvre is on the ``side of
the absolute truth and Rome is not. Therefore it is obviously not
the archbishop who can be in schism.''
   Williamson, 48, said he did not know of the traditionalist
movement when he converted to Catholicism in 1971. When asked why
he went to Lefebvre's seminary, he said:
   ``I was sent there by a mainstream priest who did not agree with
the archbishop. He is an Irishman who said, `If you keep on opening
your big mouth there is only one place for you and that's Econe'.''
   He said he planned to return on July 7 to his own seminary in
Ridgefield, Conn., which he said has 38 students.

   The nun abducted from a New York convent is
relaxed and well and unwilling to press charges against her family,
police said Friday.
   ``She told us that she was not injured, and that she was not
being held against her will,'' said Ray Hulgin, chief of
detectives. ``She was relaxed and smiling. ... We feel comfortable
that she is in total control of her situation.''
   Mary Sue Greve, 22, abducted Sunday by her family from the
Roundtop, N.Y., convent where she was a novice nun, was interviewed
Thursday by sheriff's investigators.
   Police in New York and Ohio have been looking for the woman,
also known as Sister Mary Cecelia, since her father, James, and
brothers Dave, Mark and John pushed her into a waiting car Sunday
as she walked with two nuns on a street near St. Joseph Novitiate
Convent in the Catskill Mountains.
   Dave Greve has said that the abduction took place so the family
could raise objections with Miss Greve about the convent and its
priest, the Rev. Clarence Kelly.
   The convent is operated by a group of conservative Catholics
associated with Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre, the French prelate who
was excommunicated Thursday after a long dispute with the Vatican.
The sect has rebuffed modernist reforms instituted after the Second
Vatican Council of the 1960s and follows traditional practices,
including conducting Mass in Latin.
   Dave Greve said his sister still wants to become a nun and that
the family is searching for a convent for her to join.
   The family, through attorney James Condit, contacted Hamilton
County authorities Thursday afternoon. New York State Police have
misdemeanor arrest warrants for Miss Greve's father and brothers.
   Hulgin said the investigators' conversation with Miss Greve was
tape-recorded and mailed to New York authorities.
   Sgt. John Vansteenburg of the New York State Police said
Thursday that the warrants against the family would ``most
definitely'' be dropped once the tape was received and the reports
from Hamilton County confirmed.
   Hulgin said investigators did not delve into the particulars of
the kidnapping or what had transpired since Sunday.
   ``Our concern was that she was not a victim,'' Hulgin said.
   Miss Greve and her parents ``won't be around for a while,'' Dave
Greve said Thursday. ``This has been tough on all of us. Mary Sue
is very upset, and I'm a nervous wreck. But (Mary Sue) looks great
to me.''

   A severe drought in Mexico's
northwestern grainbelt is rapidly depleting wells and irrigation
dams, leaving farmers with little more to do than ``stare at the
sky.''
   Vital cropland sits idle, cattle are dying and the government is
wondering how it will pay for all the food it will have to import.
   ``We've got 15,000 tractors and 2,000 harvesting machines doing
nothing,'' said Nicolas de los Rios, research chief for the
Confederation of Agriculture Associations in the northwestern
Pacific coastal state of Sinaloa.
   Recent rains in other important agricultural areas prevented a
national catastrophe, although wheat yields are down about 15
percent and other crops are expected to be off due to late planting
and low soil moisture.
   But farmers and cattle ranchers in the northwest are facing what
some have said is the worst drought in nearly half a century.
   Most affected are Sinaloa and the northwestern border state of
Sonora. They have been dry for nearly a year.
   ``Sinaloa is experiencing its worst drought in memory,'' Rios
said in a telephone interview.
   More than 20,000 head of cattle have died in Sonora alone,
Arturo Ortega, president of the state Cattle Ranchers Union, told
the Mexico City newspaper El Universal.
   Insufficient moisture in Baja California and Chihuahua still
threatens non-irrigated fields and pastureland.
   Cattle losses in Chihuahua, Mexico's largest state bordering
Texas and New Mexico, are into the thousands and large parts of the
state bypassed the corn-planting season due to parched cropland.
   Chihuahua began importing cattle from the United States last
week.
   ``In other years farmers would be working intensely right now,''
said Kenneth Shwedel, an agriculture economist in Mexico City for
the National Bank of Mexico.
   Instead, said Shwedel, ``They're staring at the sky.''
   It has rained in the northeastern border state of Nuevo Leon,
whose capital is Monterrey. But the state government in this
semi-arid industrial center announced this week a plan to seed
clouds so to raise dam-water levels.
   De los Rios said 970,000 acres of cropland have been left
barren, meaning production of soybean, rice, sorghum and corn will
drop by 1.1 million tons in Sinaloa alone.
   ``We're talking about a loss of 15 billion pesos ($6.5 million)
in direct salaries to workers,'' he said.
   Agriculture production on the northwestern desert lands depends
largely on irrigation, but low water levels in the dams forced the
cancellation of the spring planting season in some areas.
   All of Mexico's soybeans, half the sorghum and most of the corn,
beans and rice are planted during the spring cycle.
   De los Rios said the water supply in Sinaloa's seven dams has
fallen to 8 percent to 10 percent of total capacity.
   Sonora's 17 irrigation dams are down to about 25 percent of
capacity, and the supply is dropping, said Hector Roman de Vega,
president of the state Confederation of Agriculture Organizations.
   ``Cultivations of soybean and sesame have been restricted to
almost zero in the entire Yaqui and Mayo valleys,'' de Vega said.
The two valleys total nearly 775,000 acres.
   Shwedel said the federal government's inflation-fighting program
will face some tough challenges because of the drought.
   ``We're walking on a tightrope,'' he said.
   Under a plan to reduce inflation that hit a record 159 percent
last year, the government has pledged to reduce spending and froze
wages and prices of dozens of basic consumer goods.
   Although many crops have been salvaged, Mexico still is faced
with spending $100 million to $700 million more than it did last
year on imported food and feed, according to Shwedel. In 1987,
Mexico spent $1.3 billion, he said.

<NOTE>EDs: Subs 5th graf, ``COSTS,'' to include cap on supplemental
premium</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here are some highlights of the catastrophic
health insurance bill signed into law by President Reagan on Friday.
   HOSPITAL _ Full coverage for 365 days a year of hospital bills
after a once-a-year deductible estimated at $564 in 1989. The
deductible is indexed to rising hospital costs. Medicare now
charges a deductible for each hospital stay during a year and
provides full payment for just 59 days a year.
   DOCTOR BILLS _ Full payment of ``reasonable and proper'' doctor
bills after a $1,370 annual cap is met. Medicare continues to pay
80 percent of charges, after a $75 deductible. Both the initial
deductible and the 20 percent patient co-payment will count toward
the $1,370 cap. Patient remains responsible for that portion of
fees thatexceed the amount allowed by Medicare.
   DRUGS _ Medicare pays 50 percent of outpatient drug costs, after
a $600 annual deductible, starting in 1991. Medicare pays 60
percent the following year and 80 percent in 1993 and thereafter,
with the deductible to be indexed to rising drug costs. Medicare
now has no across-the-board prescription drug coverage.
   COSTS _ To be paid solely by Medicare beneficiaries. Current
Part B premium of $24.80 to increase by $4 a month in 1989. By
1993, the ``catastrophic'' monthly premium is projected at $10.20,
in addition to whatever the regular Part B premium is at that time.
More than 60 percent of total program costs are to be financed by
an additional supplemental premium that is linked to federal income
tax liability. The supplemental starts at $22.50 a year per $150 of
tax liability in 1989, rising to $42 a year per $150 of tax
liability in 1993. There is an $800 cap per covered person on the
total supplemental premium in 1989, rising to $1,050 in 1993.
   NURSING HOME _ Expands number of days per year for skilled
nursing facility care from 100 days to 150 and reduces co-payment
from $67.50 a day after 20th day to $20.50 a day for first eight
days, then none. No provision for long-term custodial care.
   RESPITE CARE _ 80 hours per year home health services to relieve
unpaid care providers. This is a new benefit.
   HOME HEALTH CARE _ Expands present coverage of up to three weeks
of care per illness for five days per week to up to 38 days of care
per ilness for seven days per week.
   HOSPICE CARE _ Expands present 210 days per year to 365 days per
year as long as patient is certified as terminally ill.
   MAMMOGRAMS _ A mammogram examination every other year for women
over 65. This is a new benefit. Payment initially will be limited
to $50.
   MEDICAID _ The bill phases in, over four years, a requirement
that state Medicaid programs pay all Medicare premiums, deductibles
and co-payments for the elderly and disabled with incomes below the
federal poverty line but too high to qualify for Medicaid coverage.
This improvement varies widely from state to state depending on
what the state already does.
   SPOUSAL IMPOVERISHMENT _ Gradually raises the income that may be
retained by a spouse remaining in the community when the husband or
wife has to go to a nursing home at Medicaid expense. Starting Oct.
1, 1989, the spouse at home can keep at least $786 per month, or
122 percent of the federal poverty level for a two-person family.
Spouse is also allowed to keep up to $12,000 in liquid assets.

   Cars packed with explosives blew up
Friday on a busy block in west Beirut and near a Syrian army
checkpoint in the Bekaa valley, killing one person and injuring 52,
police said.
   A spokesman for a PLO splinter group, the Fatah-Uprising, blamed
supporters of Palestine Liberation Organizaton leader Yasser Arafat
for the two blasts, which occurred 30 minutes apart.
   The first explosion sent flames shooting across west Beirut's
crowded Hamra Street, killing one person and injuring 32, a police
spokesman said. The street is west Beirut's main commercial strip.
   The spokesman said a green Renault 12 rigged with 22 pounds of
explosives went off at about 11:55 a.m. (4:55 a.m. EDT) in front of
the downtown Grand Hotel. The explosion shattered windows in the
hotel and nearby buildings.
   Police could not confirm a state radio report that the person
killed was the automobile's driver.
   They said most of the injured were treated at hospitals for
wounds caused by flying glass and later released.
   Syrian soldiers fired their AK-47 automatic rifles in the air to
make way for ambulances and fire engines and to disperse onlookers,
many of them worried about family members who happened to be in the
area.
   ``My 17-year-old son was in a nearby barber's shop. Was anyone
hurt there?'' a frenzied woman asked a member of the local Red
Cross.
   Syrian soldiers and intelligence agents also harassed
journalists, hitting reporters with rifle butts, slapping
photographers and confiscating cameras.
   Police earlier had defused a bomb found in a Mercedes Benz that
had been parked near the Helou police barracks in West Beirut's
busy Mar Elias street, they said.
   In the second blast, police said a Mercedes Benz exploded 15
feet from a Syrian army checkpoint in the Bekaa valley town of Bar
Elias. Two Syrian soldiers were among the 20 wounded.
   Police said the car was packed with about 44 pounds of TNT and
blew up about 12:25 p.m. (5:25 a.m. EDT). The explosion set four
other cars on fire, police said.
   The explosions, the seventh and eighth car bombings in Lebanon
this year, came nine days after a similar explosion killed one
person and wounded 18 others in East Beirut's Christian district of
Karantina.
   By police count, the previous six car bombings killed 94 people
and wounded 251. There have been no claims of responsibility for
any of the bombings.
   In Damascus, the spokesman for the Syria-backed Fatah-Uprising
blamed the car bombings on Arafat's Fatah guerrillas.
   ``Such criminal acts are directed against the Syrian army and
its national role in Lebanon,'' Col. Abdul Hadi al-Nashnash said in
a statement, and were designed to ``create tension in other areas
of Lebanon.''
   Earlier, the leader of Fatah-Uprising was quoted as saying that
all Fatah guerrillas would be driven from Lebanon. Col. Saeed Mousa
charged that Arafat was trying to create an independent province in
the southern port city of Sidon.
   Arafat troops evacuated the Chatilla refugee camp in Beirut on
Tuesday and went to Sidon after Mousa's followers overran the
devastated area Monday. Fatah-Uprising is besieging the shantytown
of Bourj el-Barajneh on the city's southern edge.
   ``Arafat is currently seeking to concentrate his forces in Sidon
to create a canton ... but he will fail there as he had failed in
Beirut,'' Mousa was quoted as saying in an interview published
Friday in the Beirut daily Ad-Diyar.
   Mousa broke away from Arafat's Fatah, the largest PLO faction,
in 1983 and set up headquarters for Fatah-Uprising in Damascus, the
Syrian capital.
   By police count 127 people have been killed and 527 wounded
since the latest round of fighting for control ofr two Beirut camps
broke out May 1.

<TEXT>
   Manfred Woerner became NATO's top
political official Friday and warned that the West still remains
under military threat from the East bloc despite Soviet efforts at
reform.
   The former West German defense minister spoke to reporters
shortly after taking over from Britain's Lord Carrington as the
alliance's secretary-general. Woerner, 53, is the first West German
to hold the post since the alliance was formed in 1949.
   ``We face a Soviet policy that inspires many hopes but has not
given any tangible indication that its military effort will
slacken,'' he said.
   Woerner called on the Soviets and their East European allies to
follow what he called the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's
example of maintaining only the military forces needed for
defensive purposes.
   ``That would be a decisive new turn for the foreign and security
policy of the Soviet Union and conclusive evidence of the
well-publicized `new thinking in the Soviet Union and Warsaw
Pact,''' he said.
   His comments echoed those of Gen. John Galvin, NATO's supreme
military commander in Europe, who warned the West not to be lulled
into a false sense of security by Gorbachev's reforms.
   Galvin, speaking to a group of American reporters today in
London, said Moscow has shown no change in military policy.
   ``I see a lot of wishful thinking, a lot of romanticism, about
the way things are going,'' Galvin said. ``On the military side ..
. I can find nothing really that has changed.''
   The two spoke as American and Soviet inspectors traveled to each
other's countries to begin the task of verifying compliance with
the superpower intermediate-range nuclear missile treaty signed in
December.
   Woerner is the seventh NATO secretary-general. The appointment
holds no fixed term.
   Fluent in English and French, he holds a doctorate in
international law and served as a conservative Christian Democratic
Union member of the Bundestag, or West German parliament, for 23
years before resigning this year to take the Brussels appointment.
   Woerner was Bonn's defense minister for nearly six years.
   As NATO secretary-general, Woerner is chairman of the main
decision-making bodies, including the North Atlantic Council and
the Defense Planning Committee, which coordinate the members'
national policies. The secretary-general also heads an
international staff of 1,500.
   On Wednesday, Woerner will travel to Norway for his first
official visit to a member country. Last fall, after Carrington
announced his plans to retire, Woerner and former Norwegian prime
minister Kaare Willoch engaged in a rare public contest for the
NATO appointment.
   It ended when Oslo withdrew Willoch's nomination and on Dec. 10,
the alliance foreign ministers approved Woerner's appointment.

   Gov. Dick Bryan has filed as a
Democratic candidate for U.S. Senate, saying that incumbent
Republican Sen. Chic Hecht has become ``a captive of the ideology
of the far right.''
   Bryan, 50, also said Thursday he has collected $1.8 million of
his anticipated $3 million campaign warchest.
   The governor, halfway through his second four-year term, said he
was sure that despite the intense campaign schedule planned for the
next several months he could complete work on a proposed state
budget that must be ready for submission to the 1989 Legislature
next January.
   He also said Democratic Lt. Gov. Bob Miller was getting briefed
on the budget proposal so that he could take over smoothly as
governor in January should Bryan defeat Hecht.
   Bryan criticized Hecht's support of increased defense spending
and said Hecht repeatedly has voted against federal funding for
education and to oppose nuclear arms treaties. Hecht is completing
his first term.

   The man who may become the nation's foreign
minister said Friday it should be Israel's policy to deport
Palestinian activists and to open fire on rioters to crush the
7-month-old rebellion in the occupied lands.
   A Palestinian woman died of gunshot wounds to the head suffered
in an army raid on her village May 18, said officials at Mukassad
Hospital in Jerusalem.
   Only a harsh crackdown can restore Israel's ability to deter
revolt among the 1.5 million Palestinians of the West Bank and Gaza
Strip, said Benyamin Netanyahu, a former ambassador to the United
Nations and a leading candidate in the November parliamentary
election.
   Netanyahu could be the next foreign minister if his right-wing
Likud bloc wins the election. Likud and the rival center-left Labor
Party share a tenuous ``national unity'' coalition and recent polls
show them running even in the election campaign.
   Soldiers shot Fatima Kassem, 24, during a raid on Abwein, an
isolated West Bank mountain village, and killed another villager,
the hospital officials said.
   Her death brought to 214 the number of Palestinians killed since
violence began Dec. 8 in the West Bank and Gaza, which Israel
captured from Jordan and Egypt in the 1967 war. Four Israelis also
have been slain.
   Netanyahu told The Associated Press on Friday that Israel should
``expel the main core of inciters who plan, organize and execute
the riots. ... We are talking about hundreds of people.''
   Thousands of Arab activists have been arrested in the past seven
months, but Netanyahu said prison terms no longer serve as a
deterrent. Local leaders are replaced as soon as they are arrested,
he said.
   Israel's expulsion of 21 Arabs has brought condemnation from
abroad, including criticism by U.S. officials who say the action
violates international law and human rights conventions.
   Netanyahu told Israeli reporters Thursday the United Nations
spent several minutes censuring Israel when four Arabs were
expelled earlier this year, and said the censure would last only a
few minutes more if Israel depoarted hundreds. He resigned as
ambassador four months ago to become a candidate.
   The former ambassador told the AP on Friday authorities must let
soldiers and Israeli civilians shoot with ``intent to neutralize''
Arabs throwing stones and firebombs.
   He said it should be Israel's declared policy to open fire on
Arabs throwing firebombs and rocks. ``If a rioter throws a
firebomb, he should know he could be shot to death,'' Netanyahu
declared. ``The vast majority of the Israeli voters favors much
tougher measures, and this cuts across the political spectrum.''
   Netanyahu said the policy must be valid for Israeli soldiers and
Jewish settlers alike. ``Settlers should be allowed to use force to
protect their lives,'' he said.
   He also demanded more restrictions on television camera crews,
contending that their presence feeds the violence, but said the
restrictions should not apply to print and radio reporters.
   Israel already puts severe limits on media access, frequently
declaring sites of violence to be closed military areas.
   The Labor Party, led by Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, has said
the violence must stop before peace talks can begin, but also
favors trading occupied territory for peace. Likud opposes
territorial concessions.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, head of the Likud bloc, said
Friday the rebellion's aim goes beyond ending the occupation to a
``confrontation over everything: our existence, our independence.''
He said domestic debates over territorial compromise weaken
Israel's negotiating position.
   A report in the Jerusalem Post said the Arab revolt had caused
several diplomatic setbacks for Israel.
   Quoting sources in Jerusalem, it said Poland and Greece
retreated from plans to raise the level of relations, Portugal
decided not to open an embassy in Israel and Ireland refused to
accept a resident Israeli ambassador.
   A Foreign Ministry official confirmed Greece had decided not to
open an embassy because of the uprising, but said he did not know
if that was the reason for decisions by the other countries.

   Attackers believed to be opposed to the expansion
of New Tokyo International Airport burned five construction trucks
and three buses in two separate incidents Friday, police said.
   No injuries were reported in the arson attacks. Police found
time-ignition devices in both areas and were investigating whether
the same people may have been behind both attacks.
   In Narita, 40 miles northeast of Tokyo and four miles northwest
of the airport, attackers burned four construction trucks and
damaged the office walls of Tsurushima Kenki Co., which leased the
equipment, police said.
   In Sekishiro, 63 miles northeast of Tokyo, four buses and a
four-ton truck were destroyed in a parking lot, police said.
   Friday's attacks raised to seven the number of sabotage
incidents this year suspected to have been conducted against
companies involved in the expansion of the airport.
   Farmers and radical opponents have clashes with police over the
years to protest the airport and more recently the construction of
two new runways.

   A British-Chinese liaison team on Hong Kong set
up a permanent base in the colony Friday, nine years to the day
before Britain is scheduled to hand the territory back to China.
   The Joint Liaison Group is a forum for China and Britain to
discuss arrangements for the transfer of the colony to Chinese
sovereignty in 1997. The group has discussed issues such as the
territory's defense and participation in international
organizations.
   Established under the 1984 British-Chinese agreement on Hong
Kong's future, the liaison group has met three times annually for
three years, rotating between Beijing, London and the colony.
   The group established a permanent base in Hong Kong because the
two sides will need closer cooperation in the final years before
the turnover.

   Rapid economic growth pushed Japan's unemployment
rate down in May to its lowest level in 37 months, while the number
of job holders hit a record 61.06 million, the government announced
Friday.
   Unemployment in May fell 0.1 percentage point from April to a
seasonally adjusted 2.5 percent, the Management and Coordination
Agency said. It represented a sharp turnaround from the record high
rate of 3.2 percent registered in May 1987.
   Officials said the 61.06 million workers was up 1.3 million from
May 1987.
   It was the greatest annual increase since November 1973, when
the number of jobs grew by 1.35 million.
   Led by strong domestic economic demand, Japan's economy grew
during the first three months of this year at a 11.3 percent annual
rate, its fastest rate of growth in 11 years.

<HEAD>Democrats Want High-Tech Look, Down to Balloons and Bunting</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID SIMPSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Even the balloons and bunting are supposed to
have a high-tech look at this month's Democratic National
Convention.
   ``We want the people to see this thing as an organized, unified
convention _ people who've got their act together,'' Dan Lee,
deputy chief executive officer for the July 18-21 event, said in an
interview Friday.
   Bold tones of red, white and blue will be replaced by ``soft
blues, soft reds and gray tones'' on the podium. Lee said this
``more futuristic look'' will be used around The Omni and, to some
degree, will replace traditional bunting.
   ``It's not exactly bunting,'' Lee said of the decorations
planned for the skyboxes for VIPs. But he promised plenty of color
using paint, bunting and flags.
   Balloons in some entry areas will take the form of ``air
tubes,'' thick air-filled creations ``that will be intertwined in
some of the architectural structures,'' Lee said.
   Although Michael Dukakis' campaign has yet to set final plans
for the demonstration following his acceptance speech, Lee
suggested balloons won't simply drop from nets.
   ``There are a lot of different ways to use balloons these days _
balloon structures, different ways of releasing them,'' he said.
   Still, Lee promised the celebration of the nominee will include
``lots of flags, confetti, balloons, noisemakers, lots of
traditional things.''
   Less dramatic moments in the convention are being planned with
an eye toward projecting a calm, uncluttered image, a main goal of
the podium design.
   In past conventions, Lee said, ``there were always a lot of
people walking behind the speaker and everything. We just wanted to
eliminate a lot of that.''
   So only a handful of convention officials will have seats on the
main speakers' platform, and they will not be in the line of prime
camera angles. Party staffers will be seated with reporters beside
the platform.
   Above, two giant screens will project closed-circuit views of
the speaker, promotional films or graphics illustrating speeches,
Lee said.
   For the first time, the party will broadcast floor proceedings
and interviews with various officials over a satellite feed, making
it available to anyone with a satellite dish.
   Don Fowler, the convention's chief executive officer, has said
previously the convention's futuristic look will be enhanced by the
computer terminals which will be used to record and count many
preliminary votes.
   The traditional roll calls for the presidential and vice
presidential candidates still will be held, however.

Combative Style</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Manfred Woerner, NATO's new secretary
general, has a dapper and often combative style that led to a
fashion magazine cover and scandal over the firing of a general
falsely accused of homosexual contacts.
   Woerner, who is NATO's seventh general secretary since the post
was created in 1952, took over the alliance's highest civilian post
on Friday. He was the first West German appointed to the post.
   The 53-year-old former West German defense minister replaces
Britain's Lord Carrington, who held the job since June 1984.
   His appointment followed a failed bid by Norway to have its
former prime minister, Kaare Willoch, named to the post.
   Nominees are generally agreed upon in negotiations between the
European allies, and the tussle sparked a rare public dispute that
embarrassed officials at the alliance's Brussels headquarters.
   Early in his political career, the former West German air force
pilot created a dashing image for himself. He was often
photographed climbing into the cockpit of a Fiat G91 fighter or
relaxing in sports cars.
   During his parlimentary career, Woerner retained his reputation
as a stylish public official with a knack for oratory.
   In 1977, the Duesseldorf-based Der Herr men's fashion magazine
featured him in a cover photo and story.
   But the air force reserve colonel is also known for his penchant
for combativeness and controversy.
   In a 1970 budget speech to the Bundestag, or West German
parliament, his attacks on the then-governing Social Democratic
government were so stinging that former Chancellor Willy Brandt
stormed out of the session.
   Woerner was also the subject of intense public debate in 1983
and early 1984 over a widely publicized scandal involving his
firing of a top NATO general, Guenter Kiessling.
   The defense minister dismissed the West German general following
reports that alleged he had frequented homosexual bars in Cologne.
   The rumors were subsequently proven false, forcing Woerner to
reinstate Kiessling one month after his dismissal.
   During the scandal, Woerner survived repeated calls for his
resignation by opposition leaders.
   Woerner was born in Stuttgart, the son of a prosperous textile
retailer. As a child, he belonged to the Jungvolk, a junior branch
of the Hitler Youth organization.
   He has a doctorate in international law and was voted into the
Bundestag in 1965. He served four years as the Christian Democrats'
party chairman and has been a member of its national executive
committee since 1973.
   Woerner was defense minister for nearly six years.
   He is fluent in English and French, NATO's official languages.
   The new NATO secretary has said he regards narrowing the Soviet
superiority in conventional arms as the key challenge for NATO.
   He is also a proponent of plans for closer Franco-West German
defense cooperation and opposes the withdrawal of all nuclear
weapons from Western Europe.

   Democrat Michael Dukakis auditioned Sen.
John Glenn for vice president Friday before a cheering homestate
crowd and said he rather liked ``dull and boring'' _ a description
sometimes attached to both men.
   After his joint appearance with the Ohio senator to wind up a
quick Midwest campaign trip, Dukakis returned to Boston for a
holiday weekend that will be capped by a Fourth of July dinner with
Jesse Jackson.
   Republican George Bush was in Kennebunkport, Maine, celebrating
his mother's 87th birthday. He planned to spend the holiday
campaigning in Michigan, Illinois and Missouri.
   As he approached the final two weeks before the Democratic
National Convention in Atlanta, Dukakis had his party's
presidential nomination firmly in hand and was deep into the
business of choosing a running mate, a process he was determined to
keep as closed to scrutiny as possible.
   When pressed for a vice presidential preference, Dukakis
repeatedly offered no hint of his choice and said he would ``make a
decision when I'm ready to make a decision.''
   He told reporters in Ohio that he expected to notify those he
doesn't choose before making any public announcement.
   ``I generally have the practice of notifying people I don't
pick,'' he said. Might Jackson receive such notice over dinner on
Monday?
   Dukakis shook his head from side to side.
   ``We're going to have dinner and listen to some good music,'' he
said.
   Dukakis invited Jackson and his wife, Jacqueline, to join him
and his wife, Kitty, for a holiday dinner at their home in
Brookline, Mass., and then attend a Boston Pops concert. Kitty
Dukakis' father, Harry Ellis Dickson, is a former associated
conductor of the orchestra.
   Meanwhile, Mayor Andrew Young of Atlanta said he doubted Jackson
would press to be the vice presidential nominee.
   ``Every poll I've seen shows that the only instance in which
Dukakis is losing to George Bush is with Jesse Jackson on the
ticket,'' said Young. ``The Democratic Party isn't suicidal and
neither is Jesse Jackson. The last thing he wants to be is the vice
presidential nominee on a losing ticket.''
   As for Glenn, Young said the senator would be ``extraordinarily
valuable to the ticket.''
   Twice during his Midwest trip he shared a platform with a local
favorite and each time he gave the crowd a teasing hint that their
choice might also be his.
   With Rep. Lee Hamilton standing by during an appearance in Terre
Haute, Ind., Dukakis said, ``Somebody handed me a button, `Dukakis
and Hamilton.' That has kind of a nice ring to it, doesn't it?''
   The crowd responded with a cheer.
   Twelve hours later he was in an auto workers union hall in Ohio
sitting across a stage from Glenn, the former astronaut who is the
state's senior senator.
   ``I've been taking a poll all over America about running
mates,'' said Dukakis. ``What do you think about John Glenn?''
   The crowd erupted with loud cheers and whistles. Dukakis turned
to the senator and shook his hand. Returning to the microphone, the
Massachusetts governor added, ``Sounds unanimous to me.''
   At a news conference after his speech, Dukakis was asked if he
agreed with assessments that Glenn was ``dull and boring'' and had
run a disastrous campaign for president four years ago.
   Glenn, standing behind Dukakis, grinned and blushed. Dukakis
smiled.
   ``Dull and boring,'' said the candidate, whose has heard those
words used to describe him. ``I kind of like that.''
   As for the rap against Glenn's 1984 campaign, Dukakis said,
``I've won campaigns and I've lost campaigns; I've run good
campaigns and have had one disastrous campaign. So I'm very
sympathetic.'' Dukakis lost the governor's office in 1978 but
rebounded in 1982 and was resoundingly re-elected in 1986.
   Glenn refused to comment on whether he deserved to be called
dull and boring.
   In fact, at the UAW hall, Glenn was positively animated compared
to Hamilton the night before. A highly respected member of the
House who was a senior member of the special committee that
investigated the Iran-Contra affair, Hamilton has a professorial
speaking style. He hardly moved while sharing the stage with
Dukakis.
   When Glenn entered the union hall he drew louder applause than
Dukakis.
   Smiling broadly, the senator gave a double thumbs up sign to the
crowd and then pointed to Dukakis, who also looked happy with the
crowd reaction.

<HEAD>Gorbachev Proclaims Party Conference a Success</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev on Friday
proclaimed the national Communist Party conference a success.
   Gorbachev spoke after the conference of 5,000 party members
adopted resolutions in what the Tass news agency called an
``unusually stormy and long'' debate.
   The conference formally closed after Gorbachev's address,
according to Tass.
   The Soviet Communist Party leader called for construction of a
monument to the victims of dictator Josef Stalin in Moscow, saying,
``I think we must agree to this, and such a monument must be
constructed in Moscow.''
   Gorbachev, summing up the work of the four-day conference, said
``the conference has created the necessary impetus to perestroika,
deepening of perestroika and the guarantee of its irreversibility.''
   Referring to his proposals to restructure the Soviet government,
strengthening its legislative branch and giving the president new
powers, the Soviet leader said ``the conference will continue
living in the society, in the discussions in the society, but now
we know how we must transform the political system.''
   Tass said the conference adopted a packet of six resolutions,
saying the debate on bureaucracy, inter-ethnic relations, and
glasnost, were particularly thorny.
   It did not immediately say what the resolutions said.
   Gorbachev also gave a lengthy critique of the work of former
Moscow party boss Boris Yeltsin, who appealed to the conference
earlier in the day to absolve him of blame for his criticism of the
slow pace of reform.
   Yeltsin's criticisms cost him his job and his spot on the ruling
Politburo. Gorbachev said Yeltsin was chosen to run the Moscow
party organization because of his experience and energy but
ultimately proved he could not handle the job.
   Gorbachev praised the open atmosphere of the conference.
   ``One of the heroes of our conference was glasnost because our
conference was a result of the atmosphere of sincerity that is
being reflected in our society. We also discussed its limits,'' he
said.
   He called on the Soviet media to ``publicize the real
achievements of the real heroes of perestroika,'' and proclaimed
that no one has a monopoly on the truth.
   In an apparent reference to the time of Stalin, he said ``the
printed word was a servant of arbitrary totalitarianism.'' In
contrast, he said the conference had showed how the interparty
debate must be carried out.

   Lower-ranking government officials and
intellectuals linked to the banned trade union Solidarity met
secretly this week to try to reopen dialogue stymied since the
imposition of martial law in 1981.
   The discussions, which one participant described as ``in the
nature of a first meeting,'' focused on the possibility of an
``anti-crisis pact'' in which the two sides would unite behind a
program to end the country's economic crisis.
   ``It was certainly a success that this meeting took place,''
according to the participant, referring to the virtual absence of
direct talks between the government and opposition in Poland since
the imposition of martial law in 1981.
   Martial law was lifted in 1983, but opposition groups including
the Solidarity trade union remain officially banned.
   The four-hour meeting Tuesday took place with the knowledge of
Polish leader Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski and Politiburo member Jozef
Czyrek, said a source familiar with the event. He said it might
lead to meetings with participation of higher-ranking officials.
   The participant, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
meeting ended with a decision for a later meeting that ``would be
more concrete, devoted to selected problems.'' No date was set.
   About 25 people were invited by Marek Goliszewski, editor of the
monthly newspaper Konfrontacja (Confrontation), and its editorial
board. The publication, linked with the official national unity
organization PRON, began publishing in January and has been
promoting the anti-crisis pact idea.
   Goliszewski confirmed he called the meeting. Other sources from
the opposition and the official side, demanding anonymity, provided
details to The Associated Press.
   Among those reported attending from the opposition were
Solidarity advisers Bronislaw Geremek and Ryszard Bugaj Andrzej
Stelmachowski, president of the Catholic Intellectuals Club of
Warsaw, and Aleksander Paszynski, head of a nationwide association
of private entrepreneurs which has applied for official recognition.
   From the authorities were Col. Stanislaw Kwiatkowski, head of
the government public opinion polling center Mariusz Gulczynski,
deputy director of the Institute of State and Law of the Polish
Academy of Sciences, and a parliamentary communist party leader,
Ryszard Wojna, the sources said.
   The meeting was known to be controversial within the opposition,
which is wary of being used. One Roman Catholic intellectual,
lawyer Tadeusz Mazowiecki, said he stayed away because, ``I thought
it wasn't wise to hold such a meeting at this time.''
   ``There were no politicians, there was no Walesa,'' said the
participant, referring to Solidarity chief Lech Walesa.
   Of the representatives from the official side, he said, ``They
are important advisers, but of lower rank.''
   ``The discussion was definitely a political one ... An outlining
of positions or stands,'' he said. ``And I think that the next
meeting will be more pragmatic or technical.''
   The sources said some of the participants insisted it not be
publicized. It took place on ``neutral grounds,'' a hall at Warsaw
University, he said.
   The source familiar with the meeting said it was an opportunity
for the government to poll a broad spectrum of the opposition on
what solutions it might accept to solve Poland's problems.
   The nation was hit by a wave of strikes last month and there has
been little public enthusiasm for government economic reform steps,
including steep price increases, to save Poland's debt-burdened and
inefficient economy.
   ``Both sides expressed approval of the need for rapid changes in
the economy,'' the source said. ``But the opposition stressed the
opinion that the changes have to be very radical.''
   The most emotional discussion was reported to focus on trade
unions, with the opposition demanding legalization of Solidarity, a
suggestion rejected by the officials. The opposition side said it
was willing to hear other government proposals that would create
``trade union pluralism,'' the source said.
   The sides agreed on the desirability of independent
associations, political discussion clubs and a ``coalition'' form
of governing in which ``representatives of independent circles''
would enter the government and the parliament, the source said.
   But the officials taking part in the discussion said they had no
authority to make firm offers and would have to consult with their
superiors, while the opposition stressed that it was not interested
in ``artificial'' actions from the government or attempts to split
its ranks, said the source.
   Geremek proposed talks on an ``anti-crisis pact'' in an
interview published by Konfrontacja earlier this year. Czyrek, the
Politburo member, repeated the formulation in an interview
published in May.
   However the two sides have been at odds publically over what the
pact would cover and who would be the government's negotiating
partner.
   Officials have said the government could not talk to groups paid
by a foreign power, or people who want the situation in Poland to
worsen, descriptions normally applied by the official media to
Solidarity.
   The source said such language was absent from Tuesday's meeting.

   There are post-mortems, and then there are
postal mortems. Just ask H. Sam Ansell Jr.
   Ansell, owner of the Truesdale Funeral Home here, recently
received a $100 check from an Alletta DeMuir Rue for embalming her
mother and a letter praising the staff for its efforts.
   The letter bore a 2-cent stamp postmarked Nov. 17, 1930, in
Detroit. It also thanked founder George P. Truesdale for extending
credit for the work done on her mother, who apparently died in the
Kalamazoo area and was buried elsewhere.
   ``You have been most kind in letting us have this time to pay
and we sincerely thank you,'' wrote Rue, who listed a return
address in Detroit.
   The check was dated April 4, 1930, and issued by the Bank of
Detroit. But that name had been crossed out and subsituted in
handwriting with that of Jackson Park National Bank in Chicago.
   ``I rather doubt I can present that for payment to a bank,''
Ansell said.
   David Mastervich, an account representative at the post office
in nearby Kalamazoo, said the letter probably encountered a fate
common to long-delayed mail.
   ``We probably moved some equipment that's been there 50 years
and they found a letter under it,'' he said. ``At least no one can
say it didn't get delivered.''
   The Kalamazoo-Portage telephone directory listed two people
named Rue. One number had been disconnected, and a woman who
answered the phone Friday at the second listing said no one named
Rue lived there.

   This tiny Upper Peninsula community is
preparing for its annual crawl of fame: the self-styled world
championship turtle races.
   The charity event, sponsored by the Curtis Lions Club, is
expected to draw at least 3,000 fans Sunday to the resort town on
Lake Manistique. Visitors can enter their own turtles for $3, but
the same fee can be used to rent reptiles drafted for the day from
the nearby Seney National Wildlife Refuge.
   ``It is sort of a rent-a-turtle affair,'' said Dick Nunemaker, a
Lions Club member who co-founded the event nine years ago.
   The turtles race, if that is the proper word, down a 12-lane,
12-foot-long raised wooden track. The course record is about five
minutes, Nunemaker said, adding, ``I have to talk very slowly in
announcing the races.''
   Although only one winner is named, the also-crawls are tended
carefully. Les Walstron, a retired conservation officer who gathers
the four- to eight-inch mud turtles from the Seney refuge, feeds
them all the minnows they can eat before returning them to their
usual surroundings.

<HEAD>Mine-Damaged U.S. Warship En Route From Persian Gulf to Newport,
R.I.</HEAD>

   The U.S. warship severely damaged by an
Iranian mine on April 14 slipped quietly out of the Persian Gulf on
Friday aboard a larger vessel and headed for repairs in the United
States, the Pentagon said.
   The missile frigate USS Samuel B. Roberts was being carried
aboard the Dutch heavy lift ship, Mighty Servant II, a 25,743-ton
semi-submersible cargo vessel that was to take 30 days to carry the
Roberts to its home port of Newport, R.I.
   For security reasons, the Pentagon would not say when the ship
departed Dubai and when it passed through the Strait of Hormuz at
the mouth of the gulf.
   Before the Roberts was hit, it was on duty in the gulf escorting
merchant shipping which has been a target of attacks in the 8-year
Iran-Iraq war.
   The commander of U.S. forces in the region, Gen. George B.
Crist, declined during a meeting with reporters on Thursday to
discuss the Roberts' movements, but he warned Iran against trying
to attack the stricken vessel.
   ``Let them just try,'' he said.
   The Roberts hit a submerged mine on April 14 after stumbling
into what Crist said was a newly laid minefield 50 miles northeast
of Qatar. U.S. officials said Iran had sewn the mines.
   The blast wounded 10 U.S. sailors and ripped a 25-foot gash in
the hull of the 445-foot long, 3,600-ton frigate.
   U.S. forces retaliated by attacking two Iranian oil platforms
April 18, starting a day of fighting in which six Iranian naval
craft were sunk or damaged.
   Crist said Iranian attacks against merchant shipping in the gulf
had dropped off after April 18. However, he said the Iranians were
continuing work on a permanent bunker for Silkwork anti-ship
missiles at Kuhe-Stak, which overlooks the narrow Strait of Hormuz.
   The frigate USS Vincennes, equipped with advanced Aegis radar
and anti-missile missiles, has been posted near the strait with
orders to protect merchant ships from attacks by the Chinese-made
Silkworms.
   About 30 of the Roberts' sailors were accompanying the ship
home. About 140 other crewmen returned to the United States last
week.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wheat and barley farmers this month will get
about $190 million as final settlement for participating in last
year's federal price support programs, the Agriculture Department
said Friday.
   The subsidies are ``emergency compensation'' or so-called
Findley payments under the USDA's price support apparatus. The
payments will be in cash and will be issued ``as soon as possible''
through local offices of the department's Agricultural
Stabilization and Conservation Service, said Milton Hertz, head of
the agency.
   Wheat farmers will get about $170 million and barley producers
about $20 million. The final wheat payments are based on a rate of
9\ cents per bushel, and barley at 5 cents per bushel.
   Last January wheat farmers collected $335 million in advance
Findley payments, which are the the result of an amendment by
former Rep. Paul Findley, R-Ill. There were no advances for barley
producers.
   In all, farmers have collected about $3.2 billion under the 1987
wheat program and around $294 million in total barley payments,
according to USDA estimates.

<TEXT>
   A former governor's declaration of New
Mexico as a sanctuary state was vague enough to be construed as
carrying the weight of law, and a journalist and minister can use
it as a defense against alien smuggling charges, a judge has ruled.
   Then-Gov. Toney Anaya declared New Mexico a sanctuary in 1986, a
largely symbolic action aimed at people fleeing war in Central
America. It was rescinded when Gov. Garrey Carruthers took office
in January 1987.
   Demetria Martinez, a free-lance religion writer, and the Rev.
Glen Remer-Thamert, a Lutheran minister, were indicted by a federal
grand jury in December on charges of conspiring to smuggle two
pregnant Salvadoran women into the country in 1986.
   The minister contends he tried to help the women because of his
religious beliefs and because he considered them to be refugees
fleeing a war-torn country. He also maintains the women were to put
their babies up for adoption in the United States because they
feared conditions in their homeland.
   The U.S. attorney's office has said Remer-Thamert was motivated
by a so-called adoption-for-profit scheme.
   Martinez has maintained she accompanied Remer-Thamert in her
role as a journalist and should never have been indicted.
   Prosecutors have tried to prevent the minister from using his
religious beliefs as a defense. They also have tried to prevent
both defendants from using the sanctuary declaration.
   U.S. District Judge John Conway ruled Thursday the pair should
not be prohibited from offering evidence ``which could arguably
show that the defendants reasonably relied upon the proclamation.''
   ``The proclamation, while interesting, never mentions the fact
that it is symbolic only,'' Conway wrote.
   Trial is scheduled July 13.

<TEXT>
   Mikhail S. Gorbachev on Friday night closed a
national Communist Party conference on his program of
``perestroika,'' saying resolutions endorsed by the delegates lead
the way to a ``democratic image of socialism.''
   The four-day conference, the first held by the party since 1941,
was unprecedented in the openness of criticism of past and present
leaders.
   Gorbachev pointed out one key to the four-day conference _ the
attempt to overcome the party's Stalinist legacy _ when he called
for construction of a monument to the victims Josef Stalin.
   ``I think we must agree to this, and such a monument must be
constructed in Moscow,'' he said in his closing address. ``This
would be an honest step, and it will be supported by the entire
Soviet people.''
   Gorbachev spoke after the conference of 5,000 party members
adopted resolutions in what the Tass news agency called an
``unusually stormy and long'' debate. The meeting, which was called
by Gorbachev to pass judgment on his 3-year-old policy of
restructuring Soviet society, formally closed after his address.
   The Soviet leader also engaged in a long critique of the work of
former Moscow party boss Boris N. Yeltsin, who appealed earlier in
the day to the conference to absolve him of blame for criticizing
the pace of Gorbachev's reforms last fall.
   That criticism cost Yeltsin his job and his spot as a candidate
member of the ruling Politburo.
   Summing up the work of the conference, Gorbachev said, ``Through
democratization, economic reform and changes in the political
system we willmake perestroika irreversible. We will reach a
fundamentally new state of our society, a new human and democratic
image of socialism.''
   He called for the policy-making Central Committee and other
organs to urgently settle questions related to political reforms so
they can begin to be implemented at a fall session of the Supreme
Soviet.
   Referring to his proposals to restructure the government's
legislative branch and give the president new powers, Gorbachev
said ``the conference will continue living in the society, in the
discussions in the society, but now we know how we must transform
the political system.''
   Tass said the conference adopted a package of six resolutions,
saying the debate on bureaucracy, inter-ethnic relations and
Gorbachev's policy of ``glasnost,'' or more openness, were
particularly thorny. It did not say what the resolutions said.
   The Tass report said there were several votes on amendments, and
that the conference rejected proposals by space scientist Roald
Sagdeyev on elections to government councils.
   An amendment calling for the Communist Party newspaper Pravda to
be taken out of the hands of the policy-making Central Committee
received only 56 votes, it said.
   Gorbachev praised the open atmosphere of the conference.
   ``One of the heroes of our conference was glasnost because our
conference was a result of the atmosphere of sincerity that is
being reflected in our society. We also discussed its limits,'' he
said.
   He called on the Soviet media to ``publicize the real
achievements of the real heroes of perestroika,'' and proclaimed
that no one has a monopoly on the truth.
   In an apparent reference to the time of Stalin, he said ``the
printed word was a servant of arbitrary totalitarianism.'' In
contrast, he said the conference had showed how the interparty
debate must be carried out.
   Before the conference debate ended, however, the long-simmering
feud between Yeltsin and Kremlin No. 2 leader Yegor K. Ligachev
broke into the open.
   Yeltsin was judged as being politically mistaken by the party,
but he said Friday his only mistake was poor timing.
   Gorbachev said Yeltsin was chosen to run the Moscow party
organization because of his experience and energy, but ultimately
proved he could not handle the job.
   Ligachev, at whom much of Yeltsin's criticism was leveled, took
the floor Friday evening to oppose his return, saying Yeltsin
committed many errors and still hadn't learned his lesson.
   The 57-year-old Yeltsin, a leading reformer and former protege
of Gorbachev, was fired from his Moscow job as head of the Moscow
Communist Party after he attacked the slow pace of reform during a
speech in October to the Central Committee. The speech has not been
published.
   Yeltsin was reassigned as first deputy of the state construction
committee, a ministerial-level post. He was dropped from the
Politburo in February but retained sufficient status in the party
to be chosen a delegate.
   ``I think my only mistake was that I spoke too early, before the
70th anniversary of the October Revolution,'' Yeltsin said. It was
a time when the party was trying to display unity and celebrate its
successes.
   ``Taking to heart what happened, I ask the conference to change
the decision of the plenum of the Central Committee,'' Yeltsin told
the delegates. ``If you find it possible to do this, you will
rehabilitate me in the eyes of Communists.''
   Yeltsin took the floor to answer questions from many delegates
about the circumstances of his ouster and about his demand that
Ligachev resign. He had told Western reporters during the
U.S.-Soviet summit meeting in Moscow that Ligachev was the party
official most responsible for holding back Gorbachev's reforms.
   Ligachev said Yeltsin had ``not drawn the necessary conclusions
from his mistakes and the principled criticism of his party
comrades.''
   Other delegates also criticized Yeltsin, charging that he had
been tactless on a visit abroad and gave interviews to foreign new
agencies just to boost his own prestige. Some rose to Yeltsin's
defense in an open debate.
   Earlier Friday, the nation's top environmental official demanded
punishment for planners responsible for pollution disasters, and a
reformist publisher defended the new openness of the press.
   At other times during the conference, delegates have openly
disagreed on the concrete results of Gorbachev's drive for
perestroika, which was launched after he took power in March 1985.

   Annie Jeffrey is unable to walk and spends
most of her time on her front porch, praying, reading the Bible and
waiting to die among the squalor of her rundown home.
   A health official said Friday he does not want to do anything to
take away her right to do what she wants. Mrs. Jeffrey, 88, said
she does not want or need anything else.
   ``When you get as old as I am you have to be satisfied,'' she
said. ``There's a time to put down all the stuff you picked up in
your young life and get ready to meet Jesus.''
   She said she doesn't want to leave her porch, where she's been
for three weeks, because that's where she wants to die. Neighbors
and friends take food to her.
   ``I feel satisfied,'' Mrs. Jeffrey said. ``That's why I stay
here.''
   Jim Hollis, environmental supervisor for the Shelby County
Health Department, said there is nothing the department can do
except accuse Mrs. Jeffrey of violating disposal laws, and it does
not want to do that.
   After Mrs. Jeffrey's living conditions were publicized,
neighbors arrived Thursday and picked up junk from her yard.
   The Rev. A.L. Jones has tried to persuade Mrs. Jeffrey to allow
someone to help her. He wants to get her to a hospital to find out
why she can't walk.
   Jones called the wood frame house a death trap. It has no
electricity, gas or running water. ``If she was a dog, the humane
society would have been over there to do something for her,'' he
said.
   Jones said some of her five stepchildren in California and
Chicago are to arrive this weekend, and he hopes they will take her
with them.
   But Mrs. Jeffreys said she barely knows her stepchildren and
would rather stay at the house where she has lived since 1935. Her
husband died in 1940.
   Delores Smitherman of Montevallo said she took Mrs. Jeffrey into
her home for three months after learning in January that the
woman's feet were badly swollen. Mrs. Smitherman said a doctor
``gave her two prescriptions, but she said that if she could go
home she could use a home remedy.''
   After the swelling went down Mrs. Jeffrey insisted on going home.

   The government has proposed the death
penalty for people who smuggle women out of the country and sell
them into prostitution.
   Prime Minister Moudud Ahmed introduced the bill Thursday in
Parliament, saying capital punishment was needed to halt ``this
gruesome crime against our mothers and sisters.'' The measure is
expected to pass.
   The smugglers recruit their victims with promises of finding
jobs for them as servants in India, Pakistan and the Middle East.
Dhaka newspapers said other women and children were kidnapped.
   Border police last week said they foiled an attempt to smuggle
135 women and children across the border to India. Authorities say
they have rescued more than 400 women from smugglers this year.
   More than 50 alleged smugglers have been jailed. Under the law,
the maximum penalty they face if convicted is life imprisonment.

   Scalding, chemical-filled
water from a broken pipeline sprayed technicians at a
government-owned steel factory, killing five people, officials said
Friday.
   Officials of the Iron and Steel Corp. plant at Newcastle in
Natal province said a sixth man was in critical condition with
severe burns covering most of his body.
   The head of the maintenance department, and four technicians and
engineers died Thursday following the morning accident. They had
been testing a new valve in a hot water pipeline at the plant's
coke ovens when a two-foot-thick pipe fractured and 176-degree
water sprayed over the men.
   A spokesman for Newcastle hospital said they suffered third
degree burns over 80 to 100 percent of their bodies, and that a
chemical in the water had worsened the effects.

   The State Department said Friday it welcomes
China's statement of support for a negotiated political settlement
in Cambodia, and Secretary of State George Shultz will discuss the
issue with Chinese leaders during his visit to Beijing later this
month.
   The Chinese statement ``mirrors our own views that a Vietnamese
withdrawal and free and fair elections and a secure atmosphere are
essential conditions for a lasting solution to the Cambodian
conflict,'' department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley told reporters.
   Mrs. Oakley also said the current announced withdrawal from
Cambodia of 50,000 Vietnamese occupation soldiers, including senior
command elements, ``if fully implemented would represent a positive
step toward stability in the region.''
   She added, however, that ``the announced withdrawal would still
leave in Cambodia at leaart 50,000 to 70,000 Vietnamese troops
whose presence would prevent any genuine expression of Cambodian
political self-determination.''
   ``We continue to maintain that the resolution of the Cambodian
problem would require a settlement agreement which provides for
complete withdrawal of Vietnamese troops from Cambodia.''
   Vietnamese forces invaded Cambodia in 1978, ending bloody rule
by the Khmer Rouge, blamed for the death of millions of Cambodians.
Mrs. Oakley said it is not known if the current withdrawal will
lead to a total Vietnamese pullout from Cambodia, and she did not
address concerns about a possible Khmer Rouge return to power in
Cambodia after the Vietnamese leave.
   However, Shultz's talks in Beijing later this month will be
preceded by extensive meetings in Bangkok with leaders of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations.
   The United States has been working closely with ASEAN countries
in seeking an end to the Vietnamese occupation of Cambodia as well
as a solution to the Khmer Rouge problem.
   A senior U.S. official said later the United States has made it
clear to China, the strongest supporter of the Khmer Rouge, that
return to power by the Khmer Rouge is out of the question. The
United States hopes that Cambodian Prince Norodom Sihanouk will be
able to find a solution to the future government structure, added
the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.

<HEAD>Minnesota Court Orders Another Hearing In `Almost Incredible'
Abuse Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY R. SANDOK</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A juvenile court's decision to return two
young children to a home with a ``severe and prolongued'' history
of child abuse must be reconsidered, the Minnesota Supreme Court
said Friday.
   In a 5-2 decision, the state's high court said the child abuse
documented in 1982 ``is almost incredible'' and sent the case back
to Hennepin County juvenile court for further findings.
   ``The history of child abuse in the home has been both severe
and prolonged,'' Associate Justice Glenn Kelley said in the
majority opinion.
   In 1982, the father was convicted of second-degree assault for
physical abuse against his seven children, who range in age from 8
to 20. In 1983, a juvenile court judge found that he had sexually
abused the two youngest children, court documents state.
   But a juvenile court ruled last year that the two youngest
children, who had been in foster care since 1982, should be
returned to the home anyway. The five older children had already
returned to their parents, the court said.
   The dissenting judges said that instead of merely studying the
case further, the courts should terminate the parents' rights to
the youngest children immediately. ``The courts have exercised
judicial caution long enough,'' Justice Rosalie Wahl said. ``It is
unconscionable to prolong these proceedings.''
   According to court documents in a 1982 order taking the children
from him, the father once forced several of the children to stand
on stools and placed a chain that had been positioned over a roof
beam around their necks as he threatened to kick the stool from
underneath each child.
   On other occasions, the father chased a child with a bowie knife
and held it to the child's throat, the documents state. He also
once ordered several children outside, clad only in their
nightgowns, when the wind-chill was 80 degrees below zero.
   The mother also was physically abused by the father, according
to court documents.
   Friday's order stems from a July 1987 juvenile court ruling that
denied a social services petition to terminate parental rights for
the two youngest children.
   The five older children had testified at that time that
conditions in the home had improved, the court said. But the ruling
noted that the testimony ``came from children who for most of their
lives had been physically abused by their father and who had
themselves never volunteered to report the continued abuse.''

   The kickoff Friday of the 125th
anniversary observance of the Battle of Gettysburg thrilled Allen
Nelson for a very personal reason: His father fought in it.
   Nelson, 70, a retired career Army officer, drove in from
Sanford, Fla., for the ceremonies. He wore the uniform of a Union
colonel as he watched mock soldiers pass in review to mark the
start of the battle, which was fought here July 1-3, 1863.
   His father, Pvt. George H. Nelson, fought with the 2nd Vermont
Volunteers at Gettysburg and later was wounded in the Battle of the
Wilderness in Virginia.
   Nelson, whose father was in his 70s when he was born, was the
only known first-generation descendant at the national park, where
what many historians view as the central battle of the Civil War
took place.
   The opening event drew only about 1,000 spectators, well below
park officials' estimates that 20,000 or more visitors would be at
the battlefield for each day of the anniversary.
   Last weekend, more than 100,000 visitors attended a three-day
re-enactment of the battle on private property several miles from
this Adams County community.
   ``I do think that a lot of people think last week was the actual
anniversary,'' said Bob Moore, the battlefield park's media
director. ``I think some people mistakenly thought that once the
events of last week were over, that that was the end of it.''
   The first day's schedule mirrored the first day of the battle.
Not much happened.
   But just as the fighting intensified on the second day and
reached its climax with the Union victory on the third, the pace of
events will pick up Saturday and Sunday, with a symbolic exchange
of battle flags, a dedication of the newest monument at the
battlefield and a relighting of the Eternal Peace Light Memorial.
   ``Obviously, Friday and Saturday are when the people are
hopefully going to be here,'' Moore said.
   The last time there were overflow crowds in Gettysburg was 1938,
the 75th anniversary of the clash between Union and Confederate
troops. That was the last major reunion of soldiers who fought here.
   Nelson was here then with his father, who was in his mid-90s. He
remembers touring the battlefield and being able to envision what
happened.
   But he said he didn't hear much about the battle from his father
or the other veterans.
   ``He didn't talk too much about it,'' said Nelson. ``Most of the
veterans wouldn't talk too much about it. I guess they wanted to
forget.''
   Those who turned out Friday were quickly gripped by the
fascination of the once bloody ground, later the scene of Abraham
Lincoln's famous Gettsyburg Address.
   ``We've come a long way to see this,'' said Londoner John
Funnell. ``It's fantastic.''
   His wife, Betty, agreed, but said she was still hoping for one
more thrill at Gettysburg.
   ``I would like to see something like Rhett Butler,'' she said,
referring to the dashing character in ``Gone With The Wind.''

   An Amish farmer who won a new pickup
truck in a grocery store contest will trade it in for a horse-drawn
buggy because the truck doesn't fit into his religion's simple
lifestyle.
   Leroy Hostetler won the fire-engine-red Ford Ranger, worth
$7,500, when his name was drawn from hundreds of thousands of
entries last month in a Village Market Food Centers drawing in
Huntington, Ind.
   The farmer, who operates 105 acres with his brother outside this
town of 1,000, learned that he had won Wednesday when the owner of
the local Village Market store, Allan Murk, drove out to his farm.
   Hostetler doesn't have a telephone, in keeping with Amish custom
of dressing simply and spurning modern conveniences like phones and
electrical appliances.
   Hostetler was surprised at winning, Murk said. But ``everybody
envisions what they'd do with something if they won. I think he had
in mind buying himself a new surrey, buggy, whatever you want to
call it.''
   Hostetler should have some money left over once he trades in the
pickup. Murk said a new carriage should cost $1,800 to $3,000.

<TEXT>
   Pilot error most likely caused the
collision of two Army helicopters that killed 17 soldiers during
night training at Fort Campbell last March, according to a report
released Friday.
   ``Pilot error, to wit, a reasonable mistake in judgment is the
most probable explanation for the cause of this accident,'' said
the report, compiled by an investigation board of six Fort Campbell
officers, all aviators.
   But the report concluded: ``There should be no action taken
against anyone as no foundation for negligence can be established.
The accident was not due to lack of diligence, nor unreasonable or
unprofessional conduct.''
   ``Up to the point of impact, the missions were formed just as
briefed,'' said Maj. Randy Schoel, public affairs officer at the
Army base.
   The report said there was no evidence of a mechanical
malfunction in the two UH-60 Black Hawks involved in the March 8
crash.
   ``Nor can it be confirmed that there were any procedural errors
on the part of either crew,'' Schoel said.
   The report, however, cited other factors, including exterior and
interior design features of the UH-60 Black Hawks and limited pilot
training with night-vision goggles.
   Compounding the problem, the report said, was the lack of
lighting on the helicopters. The report said the number and the
size of position lights on the outside of the $4.6 million Black
Hawk are inadequate.
   The helicopters were made by Sikorsky Aircraft division of
United Technologies Corp. In Stratford, Conn., company spokesman
Robert Stangrone said the company not seen the report.
   But he said: ``All aircraft have some degree of field-of-view
limitation. Obviously, the ideal cockpit is a glass bubble with an
unobstructed view. It's a matter of design tradeoffs that consider
structural integrity, ballistic tolerance, survivability and so on.
... Design and operational tradeoffs also determine the extent and
intensity of exterior aircraft lighting.''
   The investigation found that the collision ``was the result of
the two air crews' being unable to see each other in the final
moments of flight,'' according to a statement read by Schoel.
   The report said one of the two helicopters may not have had its
anti-collision strobe light turned on as required. ``That's the
only item in question _ the strobe light,'' Schoel said.
   ``Because the accident was fatal to the crew of both aircraft,
it is impossible to determine exactly what caused the two aircraft
to fly into each other,'' the report said.
   The accident occurred when a Black Hawk returning from a solo
instruction flight collided with the lead helicopter in a formation
of three returning from a mission to pick up soldiers in the field.
   The lead helicopter, struck broadside, carried 13 soldiers. The
other carried four. All 17 victims, who belonged to the 101st
Airborne Division at Fort Campbell, were killed. The other two
helicopters landed safely.
   Crew members on the undamaged helicopters said there was little
warning that another helicopter was approaching. The pilots were
wearing night-vision goggles, which amplify very small amounts of
light.
   ``Restrictions to vision caused by door posts and structural
components of the aircraft and the limited field of view of the
night-vision goggles being used by both crews hampered their
ability to see,'' Schoel said at the news conference. The report
did specifically cite the door posts.
   The lights on the helicopter leading the formation could ``very
easily have been obscured and blended into'' city lights, he added.
   Pilots wearing night goggles are supposed to scan left and right
repeatedly because the goggles provide only a 40-degree field of
view, Schoel said.
   One of the helicopters involved in the crash was in a climbing
right-hand turn with its crew members looking to the right as it
turned while the crew members of the other helicopter to the left
were looking straight ahead, Schoel said.
   The helicopter making the right turn ``would have been slightly
nose up, left wing high ... so the field of vision to the left
would have been obscured,'' Schoel said.
   Stangrone said one effort being made to enhance cockpit
visibility is smaller instrument panels that allow for a larger
wind screen. ``This effort is paced by computer technology that
will result in smaller black boxes and instrument displays,'' he
said.

<TEXT>
   Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci announced
today that the Pentagon has suspended payment on $1 billion in
contracts that may have been tainted by bribes and fraud.
   The suspensions will not damage national security, he said.
   Carlucci said that he took the action as a result of documents
in the case unsealed by a judge in Federal District Court in
Dallas. The affidavits disclosed that a defense consultant passed
along inside information on nine Navy contracts worth more than
$522 million in a conversation that was monitored by the FBI.
   Additionally, Carlucci said the department was beginning
suspension procedures against three individuals and a company named
in the documents, reviewing existing contracts with four implicated
companies, and freezing new contracts on nine weapons systems.
   ``The affidavit provides the department with evidence concerning
individuals and companies,'' he said.
   ``The Navy has initiated suspension procedures with respect to
George Stone, Mark Saunders, Joe Bradley'' and the Continental
Electronics Division of Varian Associates Inc., he said.
   Carlucci said the companies and officials involved were being
notified of the Petagon action.
   And he said the department would take further actions as
evidence in the case becomes public.
   `Wherever we have specific evidence, we will take action. As I
have indicated previously, we do not need to wait (for)
convictions, or even trials, for that matter,'' he said.
   ``We are in an ongoing dialogue with the Department of
Justice,'' which is conducting the investigation, he said. ``The
Department of Justice quite correctly points out that what they are
dealing with is grand jury information, and (it) would be
inappropriate for them to supply this information to us at this
time. But as soon as they are able to, they will be supplying
information to us, and as soon as we get the information, we will
act.''
   Until Pentagon officials see what is in other affidavits in the
case, he said, ``until we have all the information from the
Deparment of Justice, we can't make ... judgements. All we can do
is wait for the wheels of justice to take their course.''
   Carlucci said the current actions did not gravely impair
national security, but that additional suspensions might.
   ``If you say `impact on national security', clearly anything
that slows down the process of producing defense equipment or
requires us to reopen contracts has an impact on our ability to get
equipment in the field,'' he said.
   ``If you are talking about grave or serious impact on readiness
or modernization programs, I would not yet put what we have done
today in that category. But clearly it has an impact,'' he said.
   Carlucci said the Pentagon was reviewing existing contracts with
four companies named in the affidavit, Litton Industries Inc.,
Norden, Hazeltine, and Emhart. Of the four, only Litton has been
named by the Pentagon as among the top 100 companies with which it
does buiness.
   The largest single weapons system on which payments are being
frozen is called the Anti-Submarine Operating Center, a $712
million system of shore-based command and control centers to
coorinate efforts to locate, and in time of war destroy, submarines.
   The second most costly weapons system mentioned by Carlucci was
the Digital Communications Terminal, a $150 million program to
develop a hand-held computerized unit to compose messages to be
transmitted in short bursts by military field radios to minimize
the possibility that they could be intercepted or decoded by enemy
forces.
   The next largest was the Advanced Tactical Air Command Central,
a $118 million program to replace existing installations that used
advanced electronics to coordinate air defenses.
   The other six weapons systems on which new contract actions were
being suspended were: the Tactical Environmental Support System, a
$58 million Navy program; a $51 million fiber optical project; the
Digital Wideband Radio set, being developed at a cost of $49
million; a $38 million anti-submarine warfare electronics display
unit; the $30 million Bancroft radio for tanks and the Marine
Corps' light armored vehicles; and a $6.3 million project to
develop very low frequency and low frequency communications gear.

   John Zaccaro Jr. began his
four-month sentence for selling a quarter-gram of cocaine to an
undercover officer by reporting to jail Friday before being put
under house arrest.
   Zaccaro, 24-year-old son of former vice presidential candidate
Geraldine Ferraro, was booked at Chittenden Community Correctional
Center and then left to begin a special house arrest program for
non-violent criminals.
   ``He's come and gone,'' said Philip Scripture, Chittenden
superintendent. ``He was processed, fingerprinted, photographed and
left at 2:30. We treated this as a routine booking.''
   After booking, Zaccaro was to be released to the field
supervision officer to participate in the state's house arrest
program.
   ``It's like being in jail, but without the walls,'' said
Scripture, adding that Zaccaro would be required to stay in his
residence.
   ``He would have a schedule whereby he could leave for work or
community service. He would not be allowed to consume alcohol or
drugs, and parole officers would stop by his place unannounced,
require him at times to blow into an alcohol sensor, or give a
urine sample,'' Scripture said.
   ``He must have a phone so that there can be telephone cheks to
make sure he is there and he would have to request the opportunity
to have visitors.''
   Under the program, Zaccaro could begin the 300 hours of
community service also part of his sentence. The judge ordered
Zaccaro to pay a $1,500 fine as well.
   To be eligible for house arrest, an offender must have committed
a non-violent crime and have been sentenced to fewer than 121 days
in jail, a limit Zaccaro meets by one day.
   Zaccaro was arrested two years ago after selling $25 worth of
cocaine to undercover Officer Laura Manning during Middlebury
College's annual Winter Carnival weekend.
   Zaccaro's conviction still will be appealed to the Supreme
Court. The defense claims Zaccaro was only prosecuted because of
his mother's fame and was treated much more harshly than others
charged with cocaine dealing.

<HEAD>Pay For Teachers Reaches New High</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Average beginning teacher salaries pushed
past $18,000 for the first time this past school year and average
pay for the entire profession reached a record high of $28,085, a
union survey revealed Friday.
   Teachers earned 17 percent more on average than all American
workers in 1987 and 10 percent more than all government workers,
the American Federation of Teachers said.
   ``The public is really supporting teachers. It's the seventh
straight year salaries have exceeded inflation,'' said F. Howard
Nelson, an assistant research director of the AFT, which released
the survey on the eve of its biennial convention.
   The AFT survey of state departments of education found starting
salaries for the school year that just ended were $18,557, up 5.4
percent from a year earlier and more than double the $9,085
beginners were paid in 1977.
   The average salary for all teachers was up 5.5 percent over
1987, and Jewell C. Gould, the AFT's director of research,
predicted a similar increase for the school year starting this fall.
   The AFT salary data shows Alaska at the top of the pay scale
with average salaries of $40,510 and South Dakota at the bottom
with $19,758.
   But the AFT also ranked the states by cost-of-living and by how
teachers' pay compared to salaries of other workers.
   The adjustment for differences in the cost of living ``shows
that Michigan, Alaska, California and Minnesota pay teachers the
most. Louisiana, Arkansas, Hawaii and South Dakota (are) on the
bottom.''
   Adjusted for inflation, the record $28,085 average salary is
just $665 more than teachers earned in 1972. The average 1972
salary of $9,705 is the equivalent of $27,420 in today's prices.
   Likewise, the beginning salary of $6,970 in 1972 is the
equivalent of $19,739 in today's dollars _ more than today's
starting salaries.
   Gould singled out Pittsburgh, Rochester, N.Y., and the state of
Connecticut as places that are ``setting a new standard for teacher
salaries.''
   The 665,000-member AFT represents nearly a half-million of the
nation's 2.4 million public school teachers, primarily in big
cities. The 1.9 million-member National Education Association,
which opens its convention Monday in New Orleans, has 1.5 million
members.
   ``Connecticut reported the highest salary increase _ 15.8
percent for 1987-88,'' pushing its average pay level to $33,776,
fifth in the nation, the AFT report said.
   Al Fondy, president of both the Pittsburgh and Pennsylvania
Federations of Teachers, said that under a new four-year contract,
average salaries in Pittsburgh will rise from $38,000 to $46,000 by
1991, with top-scale veterans earning $51,000.
   Rochester has a contract that will push its top scale past
$55,000, plus the possibility that lead teachers will earn nearly
$70,000.
   Although teaching pays more on average than other government
work and more than the average job in the private sector, the
report said the average male, year-round worker earned 14 percent
more in 1987 than the average teacher, who gets summers off.
   The average female, year-round worker made only 73 percent as
much as teachers, most of whom are women.
   The AFT said Alaska, California, Connecticut, Michigan, New York
and New Jersey all have starting salaries in excess of $20,000,
while only Vermont and Idaho start teachers off at less than
$15,000.
   Although they earn more on average in real dollars than they did
in 1972, today's teachers are also more experienced, with nearly 16
years in the classoom compared with less than 11 years then, the
AFT said.

<HEAD>Six-Month Sentence for Man Who Said Kuwaiti Money Was for CIA-Iran
Ploy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge sentenced a former Kuwait
Airways sales manager to a six-month prison term Friday for
stealing $2.5 million from the airline in what the defendant
claimed was a plan with the CIA to woo moderates in Iran.
   The sentence was criticized immediately by a prosecutor as being
too lenient.
   Robert M. Sensi received a three-year sentence with all but six
months suspended for 21 counts of mail fraud, theft and interstate
transportation of stolen securities.
   A further order crediting Sensi with the four months he spent in
a British jail following his 1986 arrest means he will only serve
two months.
   U.S. District Judge George Revercomb acknowledged that the
sentence ``will strike some as extremely lenient.''
   But the judge said the Kuwait government had not produced ``all
knowledgeable witnesses'' who might have supported Sensi's claim
there has been ``some knowledge, some acquiesence, perhaps some
complicity on the part of others.''
   Sensi, 37, had contended that he was authorized by the Kuwaiti
royal family to spend the money, including $1 million to help
finance an initiative with the CIA to make contact with moderates
in Iran.
   During the trial, Sensi testified that he met with CIA Director
William J. Casey in 1986 before embarking on a trip to Iran where
he planned to meet with the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
   Sensi was arrested in London on the first leg of the trip to
Iran.
   Outside the courtroom, Assistant U.S. Attorney Theodore Shamanda
said: ``We accept the judge's sentence as one that is within his
power to impose.''
   But Shamanda added that ``as the trial prosecutor, I do believe
that to be too lenient. When you steal $2.5 million of your
employer's money and get a six-month sentence, what signal does
that send to the community?''
   Sensi could have received five-year prison terms for each of six
mail fraud counts and 10-year sentences for each of the 14 theft
and interstate transportation of stolen securities counts.
   Revercomb imposed the sentence after he rejected Sensi's motion
to set aside the verdict on the basis of newly discovered evidence
to support his claim that the royal family authorized his
expenditures.
   In May, Sensi's lawyers produced an affidavit from the airlines'
former New York manager who said he was aware of a special bank
account used by Sensi to funnel the money from the Kuwait Airways
accounts.
   Inder Sethi, who couldn't be located to testify at the trial,
said in the affidavit that ``it was clear to me that many people,
both in the United States and in Kuwait, were aware of Mr. Sensi's
activities.''
   ``To the best of my knowledge, no one questioned the propriety
of Mr. Sensi's actions during the entire time that I served as a
regional manager,'' the affidavit said.
   But Thomas J. Whalen, who represented Kuwait Airways in a
related civil suit, said in another affidavit that when he
interviewed Sethi last year, Sethi denied any knowledge of special
accounts kept by Sensi.
   ``Mr. Sethi said that he was shocked, or used some similar term,
when he learned about what Sensi had done,'' Whalen said.
   Before taking the bench, Revercomb met with Sethi in his
chambers. Based on his conversation, the judge said he determined
that Sethi's statements did not provide sufficient evidence to
warrant setting aside the verdict and ordering a new trial.

   The State Department said Friday it agrees

reconciliation is needed to end the conflict in his country.
   Asked to comment on a program advanced in Washington by Savimbi
to end the civil war in his country, department spokeswoman Phyllis
Oakley told reporters, ``In general, we strongly support the
objectives of ending foreign troop presence in Angola, achieving
genuine independence for Namibia (South-West Africa) and obtaining
national reconciliation in Angola. That is the basic message of Dr.
Savimbi's proposals. ... We stand ready to assist in pursuit of
these goals.''
   Savimbi said during his Washington visit this week that he
supoprts the current negotiations involving the United States, the
Angolan communist government, Cuba and South Africa on the
withdrawal of Cuban forces from his counry and independence for
Namibia.

   A simmering feud in the Soviet leadership
dominated the floor Friday and the first national Communist Party
conference since 1941 adjourned with a burst of candor not seen
since the Soviet Union's infancy.
   Mikhail S. Gorbachev encouraged both sides in the long-rumored
dispute over dismissed Moscow party boss Boris N. Yeltsin to have
their say.
   Yeltsin asked the conference to clear him of blame for an angry
outburst against party conservatives last fall that cost him his
job and a non-voting membership on the ruling Politburo.
   His most powerful opponent, Kremlin No. 2 man Yegor K. Ligachev,
took the floor to say Yeltsin committed many errors and had not yet
learned his lesson.
   More delegates also rose to criticize the wayward one-time
protege of Gorbachev. They accused Yeltsin of being tactless on a
trip abroad and giving interviews to foreign new agencies just to
boost his own prestige. One claimed Yeltsin drove an underling to
suicide.
   Others defended Yeltsin in an open debate, the highlights of
which were shown on television. The broadcast did not break away
even for live coverage of Gorbachev's speech closing the conference.
   Tass, the official news agency, said Yelstin told his 5,000
fellow delegates that his only mistake in criticizing the
bureaucracy last October was in speaking too soon.
   Extraordinary criticism of the Communist establishment was a
hallmark of the four-day meeting, including at least one call for
resignations of the old guard.
   Yeltsin, 57, is an outspoken reformer who became popular with
Muscovites by demanding that stores provide more food and better
consumer goods. Gorbachev brought him into the leadership, but
joined in denouncing him after Yeltsin's speech to an October
meeting of the policy-making Central Committee.
   Yeltsin's speech to the closed meeting has not been published,
but reports said he offered to resign out of frustration over his
inability to control the entrenched bureaucracy in Moscow's party
organization. His comments later were branded ``politically
erroneous,'' and he was fired.
   He rekindled the controversy during last month's U.S.-Soviet
summit in Moscow by calling for Ligachev's resignation during an
interview with Western television correspondents
   In an account carried by Tass, Yeltsin told the conference
Friday: ``I think my only mistake was that I spoke too early,
before the 70th anniversary of the October Revolution.
   ``Taking to heart what happened, I ask the conference to change
the decision of the plenum of the Central Committee. If you find it
possible to do this, you will rehabilitate me in the eyes of the
Communists.''
   Ligachev, widely viewed as a conservative counterweight to the
reform-minded Gorbachev, took the rostrum Friday evening as one of
the final conference speakers.
   Defending his own credentials as a supporter of perestroika, as
Gorbachev's ambitious modernization program is called, Ligachev
said Josef Stalin had executed some members of his family and
expelled others from the party.
   He helped his region become self-sufficient in food while
working as a party leader in Siberia, Ligachev said, whereas ``the
district where you, Boris, worked for nine years now has rationing
of food.''
   Ligachev also denounced Yeltsin for criticizing the old guard.
He credited veteran Politburo members Andrei A. Gromyko, Mikhail S.
Solomentsev and Viktor M. Chebrikov with helping Gorbachev gain
power at a crucial meeting of the Central Committee three years
ago. Without their efforts, Ligachev said, ``others might be
sitting here now'' on the dais.
   He said the leadership is united behind Gorbachev, and declared:
``There are neither conservatives nor reformers among the
leadership.''
   Yeltsin has ``not drawn the necessary conclusions from his
mistakes and the principled criticism of his party comrades,''
Ligachev said.
   Gorbachev, in his closing speech Friday, dealt Yeltsin the final
blow.
   He defended the decision to give Yeltsin the floor, saying ``We
must remove all the shrouds of secrecy,'' then reviewed events that
led to his dismissal, confirming many reports that have circulated
in Moscow for months but never appeared in the official media.
   Taking responsiblity for the decision to promote Yeltsin to the
key Moscow party post, Gorbachev said the Politburo saw his
excesses but did not act quickly enough.
   ``At a certain stage, we saw that something was wrong,'' he
said, and it became apparent Yeltsin ``was not up to the task'' of
running Moscow.
   According to Gorbachev's account, Yeltsin began losing his
temper, barking orders and ``being rude,'' and attacked his own
party organization.
   ``At first we thought he might be right,'' Gorbachev said. ``But
when he began changing one after another of the party functionaries
we became concerned and told him so. It was a time when practical
problems had to be solved, but he did not act accordingly.''
   He said the Politburo supported Yeltsin until, during
Gorbachev's vacation last summer, the Moscow party chief wrote him
asking to be relieved of his responsibilities.
   Gorbachev said he kept the letter confidential until they met
when he returned from vacation. ``We decided to wait'' after the
70th anniversary celebrations the first week in November, he said,
but then Yeltsin spoke out at the Central Committee meeting.
   As Gorbachev recounted the story, he referred to a record of the
secret proceeding. He said the Central Committee wanted to accept
the resignation but he decided to wait until after the anniversary.
   When the celebrations were over, Gorbachev went to the Moscow
party headquarters to participate in the meeting at which Yeltsin
was ousted. He said at the time that Yeltsin was overly ambitious.

<HEAD>Reagan To Nominate Stalon To Additional Time On FERC</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan intends to nominate Charles
Stalon, a holdover member of the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission, to serve additional time on the commission, the White
House announced Friday.
   Stalon, 58, filled an unexpired term when he came to the
commission in 1984. That term ran out last October. The law permits
him to stay on for a year as long as no successor has been sworn in.
   On Thursday, the president said he intends to nominate Elizabeth
Moler of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee staff to
Stalon's seat.
   Friday's announcement said Stalon, if confirmed, would fill the
remainder of the term of Michael Naeve, who resigned in March.
Naeve's term would have expired in October 1989.
   Stalon, who fills one of the two mandatory Democratic seats, has
been an intellectual force behind many of the commission's
deregulatory initiatives natural gas and wholesale electricity led
by the chairman, Martha O. Hesse.
   Fourteen Democratic senators wrote Reagan several months ago
asking him to renominate Stalon.
   Trade publications two weeks ago carried reports that Sens.
Bennett Johnston, D-La., chairman of the Energy Committee, and
James McClure, R-Idaho, the ranking Republican member, had asked
Reagan not to renominate Stalon because he could not be confirmed.
   Stalon said he did not know what was behind the opposition to
his renomination.
   The announcement still does not settle the commission's
membership uncertainties. Ms. Hesse has not been confirmed as
chairman a year after her nomination. Anthony Sousa has resigned
effective later this month and Charles Trabandt's term expires in
October.

western Kentucky, where low water levels have blocked river traffic
since Wednesday.
   The National Weather Service released June precipitation figures

   Experts say the drought has cost its 42,400 farmers and ranchers
almost $600 million in profits and may represent their biggest
disaster in 25 years.
   Bob Williams, economist with the Mississippi Cooperative
Extension Service, said the losses were ``wiping out most of the
profits you'd expect for this year.''
   The losses already represent 20 percent of Mississippi's total
farm production, which usually adds up to $3 billion each year, the

<TEXT>
   The excommunication of Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre
marks one of the few times in recent years that the Roman Catholic
Church has pronounced someone removed from the body of believers.
   In the church's history, excommunication often had political
consequences and could even result in the death penalty.
   Today, however, the censure is intended to cut off an
individual's participation in the church's spiritual life and
persuade the offender to repent.
   The penalty has been applied to leaders, from Henry VIII to
former Argentine President Juan Peron, as well as rebels against
church teaching, such as Martin Luther.
   Peron, president of Argentina from 1946-55 and 1973-74, was
excommunicated in 1955 after launching an anti-clerical campaign.
It was lifted after he repented, according to Vatican sources.
   Excommunication was even applied to communist voters in 1949
under the militantly anti-communist Pope Pius XII, an action aimed
at the Italian Communist Party. In recent years, however, the
church has dropped all mention of communists or their supporters
being excommunicated.
   ``It's certainly now a purely religious punishment,'' a Vatican
official said Friday, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   ``During earlier times in Christian society, it had many social
and political effects, but that doesn't exist any more,'' the
official added.
   An excommunicated Catholic cannot participate in worship or
receive the sacraments and is refused a Christian burial.
   In the early days of the church, Catholics were advised to shun
people who had been excommunicated. By the 15th century, the church
decided that such behavior was only necessary with the most serious
offenders, those known as ``vitandi,'' a Latin term meaning to be
avoided.
   Most of those excommunicated, including Lefebvre, are considered
``tolerati,'' to be tolerated.
   Among the actions that can cause excommunication are abortion,
violation of the confidentiality of confession and consecration of
a bishop without Vatican approval. It was the latter act that
resulted in Lefebvre's excommunication Thursday.
   During the Holy Roman Empire, from about 800 to 1806,
excommunication was considered grounds for the death penalty,
although it was not always carried out.
   Political considerations sometimes played a part in
excommunications.
   Roman Emperor Frederick II was excommunicated twice, in 1227 and
1239, because his growing empire threatened the independence of the
Papal States.
   Another major excommunication battle occurred in the 16th
century over Henry VIII's request for a divorce. The king tried
from 1527-33 to persuade the Vatican to grant him an annulment.
   The church did not budge, and Henry subsequently declared the
English church independent of Rome. He was promptly excommunicated
by Pope Clement VII.
   Perhaps the most significant excommunication was that of Martin
Luther, the founder of the 16th century Reformation and of
Protestantism.
   In 1517 Luther complained about the church practice of selling
indulgences in exchange for a reduction in the penalty for sin. He
widened his criticism, attacking papal authority and calling for a
greater role for individual conscience. Pope Leo X excommunicated
him in 1521.
   In recent years, the Vatican has excommunicated government
officials who have attacked the church and Roman Catholic priests
who have refused to give up government positions.

<HEAD>Fed Voted In May To Push Interest Rates Higher</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Top policy-makers at the Federal Reserve voted
in mid-May to push interest rates higher as a way of fighting
inflationary pressures, according to minutes of the discussions
released Friday.
   The Federal Open Market Committee, which sets monetary policy
for the central bank, voted 9-2 at a meeting on May 17 to tighten
credit conditions slightly in the weeks following the meeting.
   The two dissenters, Lee Hoskins, president of the Federal
Reserve Bank of Cleveland, and Robert Parry, president of the
Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, argued that a more
substantial tightening move was needed to dampen inflationary
pressures.
   Fed policy-makers met again on Wednesday and Thursday of this
week and many analysts believe the central bank discussed boosting
its discount rate, the interest it charges to make bank loans.
   An increase in the discount rate, which was last raised in
September, is the strongest signal the central bank can send of its
intention to push interest rates higher.
   The minutes of the May meeting confirmed what many analysts had
already suspected, that the Fed moved in late May to tighten credit
conditions because of concerns that the economy was growing so fast
in the first part of the year that it was putting severe pressures
on prices and wages.
   The last tightening move followed two earlier moves to push
interest rates higher in late March and in early May. The central
bank's goal was to restrain credit and thereby restrain overall
demand in the economy.
   It accomplished this objective by restricting slightly the
amount of money that banks have available to make loans, thus
pushing up the price of that money _ interest rates.
   A variety of interest rates, including the bank prime lending
rate, and mortgage rates, did move higher in the spring, partly as
a result of the Fed's tightening moves.
   The minutes of the May meeting showed that Fed officials
remained concerned about the rate of economic growth.
   ``The members generally agreed that some further tightening of
reserve conditions was needed to counter the risks of rising
inflationary pressures in the economy,'' the minutes said. ``A
failure to act in a timely fashion not only would be inconsistent
with the committee's commitment to achieving price stability over
time but would in fact compound the difficulties of accomplishing
that objective.''
   The two dissenters argued that the central bank should be doing
more than the small tightening steps it was contemplating.
   Hoskins and Parry argued that ``the risks were considerable that
price and wage inflation would accelerate from rates that were
already too high.'' They said unless the Fed did more it ran the
risk that it would have to drive interest rates up even more
sharply later in the year to get inflation under control.
   The minutes said that Parry argued that the two tightening moves
that had occurred in the weeks prior to the meeting were of
``insufficient magnitude to have much effect on the economy.''
   Many economists are looking for a boost in the discount rate
before the end of the month to 6.5 percent from the current 6
percent. They believe the Fed will be forced to act to keep this
rate in line with other rates, which have been pushed higher.
   They argue that the Fed will hike the discount rate now rather
than run the risk that an increase later would become an issue in
the presidential campaign.
   The FOMC, made up of the Fed governors and presidents of six of
the Fed's regional banks, also reviewed monetary policy through the
first half of the year to decide whether any changes were needed in
the monetary growth targets.
   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan will reveal the results
of those deliberations when he testifies before the Senate Banking
Committee on July 13.

   The Federal Aviation Administration
Technical Center celebrated its 30th anniversary Friday, touting
its many research developments and contributions to passengers
safety.
   ``We have some of the finest scientists in the world who live
here. This is probably one of the finest research environments in
the world,'' said Edward T. Harris, the center's director, who
officiated at a small cake-cutting ceremony.
   The center is believed to be the largest research facility of
its kind in the world. More than 2,000 people work at the
5,059-acre complex and it has an annual payroll of $85 million for
employees and contractors.
   The center just outside Atlantic City has helped develop
fire-retardant seat cushions, emergency evacuation chutes that
won't melt in a fire, floor lights to guide passengers through
smoky aisles, computer programs for air traffic controllers and a
new warning device to help pilots avoid mid-air collisions well
before other planes are in sight.
   Researchers also are working on projects that include finding
ways of detecting bulk explosives and plastic weapons to avoid
terrorist hijackings, and using satellites to assist air
controllers with overseas flights, Harris said.
   The technical center is largely responsible for keeping the
aviation industry in line with projected air traffic growth, he
said.
   U.S. Rep. William Hughes, D-N.J., proposed a broadened role for
the center.
   ``There has to be a more direct link between our research
facilities and universities and colleges. We're losing
opportunities, and this is an ideal site to develop a National
Aviation Institute, which would provide undergraduate and graduate
training ...,'' Hughes said.
   Such an institute, although still in the planning stage, would
incorporate the expertise of specialists in the aviation industry,
government and universities, FAA officials said.
   Technical center employees do much of their work in
laboratories, such as a giant hangar where fires are set in a
hollowed-out aircraft fuselage or the airport security lab that is
surrounded by barbed wire. But research also takes place in the air
with test aircraft.

   An amusement park worker was in
custody Friday after the stabbing deaths of four relatives and the
wounding of a fifth, a crime neither police nor the uncle who
summoned authorities can explain.
   Joselito C. Camangian, 23, who arrived in Santa Clara from the
Philippines about five months ago, was arrested late Thursday at a
gas station about a block from the duplex where the bodies of his
brother, two sisters and a niece were found.
   The slayings apparently occurred late Thursday, but authorities
had not established a motive, Sgt. Pat Kolstad said. A 13-inch
kitchen knife, believed to be the murder weapon, was found in a
yard three houses from the scene, he said.
   Elmer Gale, Camangian's uncle, said that after the rampage, his
nephew said calmly, ``Maybe I'm going crazy. ... I don't know what
I did,'' and told him to call police.
   Kolstad and relatives said Camangian had undergone drug
rehabilitation in the Philippines about five years ago, but
couldn't say what drug was involved or whether there had been a
relapse since he came to the U.S. He was listening to rock music on
the radio when he suddenly began attacking family members, Kolstad
said.
   Camagian, who had started work this week at a pizzeria at Great
America amusement park, was booked for investigation of four counts
of homicide and one count of attempted homicide, police said.
   Officers arrived in response to a call from Gale, who lives in
the other half of the duplex where the stabbings occurred.
   Gale ran for help after his niece, Candida C. Camangian, 26, and
her brother, Ric Camangian, 29, came to his home for help. Both
were wounded; the man later died.
   ``I heard a woman screaming, asking for help at my door,'' Gale,
48, said on Friday. ``It was my niece. She told me to call an
ambulance because her brother, `Lito,' was stabbing people.''
   Moments later, Ric Camangian arrived, clutching an abdominal
wound.
   ``I brought him inside, locked the door, and went for help,''
said Gale.
   Gale, who does not have a telephone, said he went to a shopping
center, where a gasoline station owner helped him call police. As
the two were talking, the suspect appeared.
   ``I was scared because I thought he was holding something,''
said Gale. ``But he wasn't. He approached me calmly and said,
`Maybe I'm going crazy. I stabbed somebody and I don't know what I
did. Call the police.'''
   In all, 11 relatives lived in the duplex, but they were not all
at home at the time of the attack, police said.
   Another sister, Cynthia Camangian, said, ``My sister said that
for some reason Joselito had a knife in his hand. Erlinda and
Candida tried to grab the knife. ... They thought he had an enemy
outside. And then just after that, he started stabbing.''
   Some victims had defensive wounds on their hands, and there were
signs of a ``substantial struggle'' in the house, Kolstad said.
Outside, blood was smeared around the doors of the duplex and the
pavement around it.
   Gale said he had seen Camangian that day and saw nothing strange
in his behavior.
   Candida Camangian was listed in serious condition at Santa Clara
Valley Medical Center with a chest wound, according to nursing
supervisor Carrie Wickwire.
   In addition to Ric Camangian, 29; police identified the victims
as his sisters Emerenciana Camangian, 26, and Erlinda Camangian,
30; and a niece of the siblings, Laraina Rodrigues, 15, who was
visiting from Atlanta.

<HEAD>Composer's Remains Arrive In France On Journey Home For Burial</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHERBOURG, France (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A memorial concert for Bela Bartok was
held at the harbor terminal in this Normandy port city following
the arrival Friday of the composer's remains en route to reburial
in his native Hungary.
   The concert, attended by Bartok's sons, Bela Jr. and Peter, was
part of a ceremonial procession that will take the remains by train
in a sealed wooden box through France, West Germany and Austria to
Budapest, the Hungarian capital.
   The first stop on the journey from New York, where Bartok died
in 1945, was Southampton, England. The remains arrived in Cherbourg
aboard the liner Queen Elizabeth II.
   A memorial concert is planned Sunday in Munich, followed by a
lying-in-state Monday in Vienna and a ceremonial state burial in
Budapest on Thursday.
   Bartok, born in 1881, left Hungary in 1940 in disgust at the
Hungarian government's close ties with Nazi Germany, and lived his
last five years in self-imposed exile in the United States.
   ``We have no doubt that he belongs to Hungary,'' Peter Bartok,
64, of Homosassa, Fla., said in Southampton.
   ``It was difficult for a long time for us to accept that his
grave should be disturbed, but finally we knew if we did not, the
opportunity to go home with father won't always exist, and the
thought of not going with him we could not accept.''
   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, in a program tribute
for a concert in Bartok's honor Thursday night at Southampton
University, described him as ``one of the great musical figures
this century.''

<HEAD>Rural Satellite TV Distributor Offering Cable Programs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A package of cable TV services that includes
popular premium channels should be available to many rural home
satellite dish owners this summer, the National Rural
Telecommunications Cooperative said Friday.
   The services will be made available under an agreement the
cooperative reached with six major programming services on
Thursday, just hours after a House panel approved a bill requiring
cable networks to sell their programming to independent
distributors.
   The agreement is the first involving an independent distributor
and premium cable services. The cooperative said it will add the
channels to the program package it now markets through rural
utility systems in 45 states.
   Included in the agreement are HBO, Cinemax, The Disney Channel,
Nickelodeon, Netlink USA and The Nashville Network.
   Congress has been concerned that some cable programmers have
been unwilling to sell their programming to third-party
distributors, thus shutting out potential competitors and depriving
the nation's nearly 2 million dish owners of easy access to
scrambled cable programming.
   Most of the popular cable programmers scramble their signals.
Dish owners with a decoder can subscribe directly with these cable
programmers, but they have to subscribe separately with each.
   The House Energy and Commerce telecommunications subcommittee on
Thursday voted 13-11 to require programmers who sell to one
distributor other than a cable company to sell to all other
distributors. But subcommittee members also urged the industry to
work out its own solution, and indicated the bill might be dropped
if the industry showed competitive forces were at work in the
marketplace.

   Parliament accused Romania on Friday of
violating human rights and urged its Eastern European neighbor to
reconsider a plan to resettle ethnic Hungarians.
   Newspapers reported that Romania began turning back Hungarian
tourists. It expelled a group of Hungarian diplomats Tuesday.
   A Parliament resolution adopted Friday said the fellow
Soviet-bloc nation had violated ``the funamental human, national
and nationalities-related rights.''
   It did not mention Romania's decision to close a Hungarian
consulate and expel its staff, or the Romanian order closing a
Hungarian cultural center in Bucharest.
   The resolution said a planned resettlement project that may
affect 7,000 Romanian villages, including many where ethnic
Hungarians live, would be ``contrary to the spirit of humanism as
well as to the concept of socialism.''
   Hungary says the plan to move residents of 7,000 villages to new
agricultural-industrial centers would destroy the culture and
traditions of Romania's ethnic Hungarian minority. Romania says it
will help villagers by providing services now found only in cities.
   Relations reached an unprecedented low this week and Hungarian
leaders appealed to Romania not to make the situation worse.
   ``We will always be cooperating partners,'' Parliament Speaker
Istvan Szueroes said when he presented the resolution on Romania.
``Unfortunately, (relations) are still further deteriorating.''
   He said Hungary was prepared to proceed with preparations for a
proposed meeting of premiers.
   Some newspapers said Hungarians trying to enter Romania were
being turned back, and at some border points only people in transit
through Romania were allowed to cross. the evening daily Esti
Hirlap, however, quoted a Hungarian border official as saying
``there is no ban'' on Hungarian travel.
   Romania's decision to close a consulate in Cluj in
Traynsylvania, where most of the 1.7 ethnic Hungarians live, came
after 50,000 people marched past the Romanian Embassy in Budapest
on Monday to protest the resettlement plan.
   In its resolution, Parliament said carrying out the program
``would ... impose new burdens on Hungarian-Romanian relations,''
the resolution said.

<HEAD>Reagan Urges All Nations to Sign Nuclear Non-Proliferation Pact</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan, noting the 20th anniversary
of the signing of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, called on
all nations Friday to join in the quest to prevent the spread of
the world's most dangerous weapons.
   ``I firmly believe that nuclear war can never be won and must
never be fought,'' Reagan said in a statement. ``If we are to
succeed in halting the spread of nuclear weapons, the nations of
the world must continue to work together.''
   Sixty-one nations signed the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of
Nuclear Weapons 20 years ago. Today, 136 countries are parties to
the accord.
   Two nuclear powers, China and France, are not parties to the
treaty. Among the other countries that do not participate in it are
Argentina, Brazil, Israel, India, Pakistan and South Africa.
   Reagan called the treaty ``one of the international community's
most vital instruments for preventing the spread of nuclear weapons
and strengthening international peace and stability.''
   He said, ``I call on all countries that have not yet adhered to
the Non-Proliferation Treaty to do so to demonstrate their
commitment to preventing the spread of nuclear weapons and to
strengthening the foundations of peace. I also urge all parties to
the treaty to rededicate themselves to achieving its objectives.''
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater noted in a separate
statement that ``the nuclear-weapon states which are parties to the
treaty have agreed not to assist non-nuclear-weapon states to
acquire nuclear explosives. The non-nuclear-weapon states in turn
pledge not to acquire nuclear explosives.''
   ``These mutual pledges acknowledge that the technology of
nuclear weapons and nuclear explosives cannot be distinguished and
that their further spread threatens the security of all nations,''
Fitzwater's statement said.

<DATELINE>HICKSVILLE, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An estimated 6,000 pounds of pure
cocaine, sealed in blocks of chocolate, was seized at a Long Island
warehouse in what may be the nation's largest drug bust outside
Florida, officials announced Friday.
   The seizure, valued at $480 million, is likely to drive up the
price of coke in the New York City area this summer, some officials
said.
   Three Colombian nationals, thought to be members of a major
Colombian drug cartel, were arrested in a raid of the Toronto
Imports warehouse in Hicksville by 50 agents Thursday night, said
Robert Stutman, special agent in charge of the Drug Enforcement
Administration in New York.
   U.S. Customs inspectors stumbled on the cocaine shipment June 24
during a routine check aboard the Allison Lykes at a port in
Newark, N.J., according to Peter Baish, agent in charge of U.S.
Customs in New Jersey.
   The shipment was from Ecuador and the inspection was ``a cold
hit,'' he said, explaining that inspectors had no tip or advance
warning of the contraband.
   ``This was a picture perfect case,'' Baish said. ``The hit is
phenomenal for us.''
   He said the agents were attracted to the shipment, 1,200 cartons
marked ``industrialized cocoa powder,'' because Ecuador is a source
country for cocaine.
   They sunk a drill into one of the cardboard boxes and hit a
metal box hidden in the inner core of the hardened chocolate, said
Baish.
   Agents opened the carton and found the cocaine inside the metal
box, he said. They re-sealed it and kept a surveillance on the
shipment with the help of electronic monitoring devices, he said.
   When the shipment was picked up Thursday, narcotics agents
followed the trucks, said Art Stiffel of U.S. Customs in New York.
   The trucks were intercepted before reaching the warehouse and
undercover agents took the place of the drivers, according to
Stiffel.
   He said the drivers were not part of the scheme and were unaware
of the contents of their cargo.
   The agents and the three defendants unloaded the boxes into the
warehouse. A few hours later when the suspects began moving some
cartons out to their cars, agents made the arrests.
   Oscar Nunez, 28, of Jamaica, N.Y., Absalon Borrero, 42, of
Miami, and Jaime Caro, 48, of Anz, Colombia, were charged with
importation and distribution of cocaine and conspiracy to
distribute cocaine.
   They were ordered held without bail at their arraignment before
U.S. Magistrate A. Simon Chrein in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn.
   Stutman said the suspects are believed to be members of the
Ochoa family, of Medellin, Colombia, one of three leaders in
cocaine production and importation.
   Each box weighed about 66 pounds. Each package of cocaine within
weighed six to eight pounds and was marked with the initials of the
person who had ordered it, said Stiffel. Stutman said 779 of the
1,200 cartons contained cocaine.
   ``This is the largest seizure in the U.S. outside of Florida,''
said Stutman. ``And there are only two seizures in Florida that are
greater.''
   Stutman declined to comment on whether Toronto Imports was
connected to the scheme. He said more arrests are expected in the
case.
   Authorities believe that agents have been successful in plugging
up ports in Florida which is putting pressure on smugglers to seek
other areas, such as the Northeast, as ports of entry.
   Stiffel estimated that the cost of cocaine around New York City
will increase by $4,000 a kilogram because of the seizure.

<HEAD>Government Proposes Bill To Strengthen Residential Segregation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID CRARY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government on Friday
proposed tough measures to enforce residential segregation, and
critics said it could mean mass eviction of blacks from white areas.
   ``The new amendment has a clear political message _ apartheid is
alive and well,'' said Mahomed Dangor, spokesman for a group which
has fought to block evictions of blacks living illegally in
whites-only areas.
   Government opponents condemned the proposal to tighten
enforcement of the Group Areas Act, which segregates residential
areas by race.
   The government has not strictly enforced the 35-year-old act in
recent years, angering conservative whites opposed to integrated
neighborhoods. The proposed amendment is viewed as an accommodation
to right-wing whites prior to nationwide municipal elections in
October.
   ``The government indicates once again its absolute obsession
with skin color as a norm on which to base South Africa's
political, social and economic life,'' said the anti-apartheid
Independent Party.
   Tian van der Merwe, a Parliament member for the anti-apartheid
Progressive Federal Party, called the new measures ``so harsh and
so brutal'' that up to 200,000 blacks could be evicted on short
notice.
   The Group Areas Amendment bill calls for hiring inspectors to
check for violations of the law. It would make it easier for
authorities to confiscate property and to evict and prosecute
people living in areas not designated for their race group.
   The maximum fine for a property owner who allows a person to
live outside his race group area would be increased from the
current $175 to $4,300. The The maximum prison sentence would be
increased from two years to five years.
   The bill also would negate a court ruling that violators cannot
be evicted until alternative housing is found.
   A second bill proposed Friday, the Free Settlement Areas Bill,
would allow the creation of the first legal multiracial residential
areas, subject to approval by President P.W. Botha and other
officials. No neighborhood could be intergrated against the wishes
of its residents.
   Botha's National Party favors gradual race reform but is
committed to preserving white ``group rights'' such as segregated
neighorhoods and schools.
   The National Party has held power for 40 years but has been
losing ground to the far-right Conservative Party, which opposes
all concessions to South Africa's 26-million black majority.
   The Labor Party, which controls the mixed-race chamber of
Parliament, said the Group Areas Act ``cannot be amended and must
be repealed.''
   ``We once again call on the Nationalist government to repeal
this immoral, ungodly, and iniquitous act that has been, and still
is, the cause of so much hurt, pain and suffering,'' the party said.
   South Africa has a housing surplus in white areas and a severe
shortage in black townships. Many whites have been moving from
inner cities to suburban areas, leaving urban landlords little
choice but to rent to non-whites in ``white'' neighborhoods such as
Hillbrow in Johannesburg and Woodstock in Cape Town.
   The bill is to be debated at the end of August, in the next
session of Parliament.
   Also Friday, anti-apartheid church leaders called for an end to
executions in South Africa and said they would not comply with a
directive to submit a church publication to censors.
   The decisions were among more than 30 resolutions adopted at the
close of a five-day conference convened by the South African
Council of Churches, to which most major Protestant denominations
belong.
   On Thursday, leaders of 16 churches affiliated to the council
deliberately defied a state-of-emergency regulation by announcing
their opposition to participation in nationwide municipal elections
Oct. 26. Calls for an election boycott are outlawed under a
regulation implemented June 10.
   The clergymen, like many other anti-apartheid activists, oppose
black participation in local elections until the black majority
obtains full political rights on the national level.

<HEAD>Iran-Contra Prosecution Says North Doesn't Need More Secret
Documents</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iran-Contra prosecutors on Friday urged a
judge to reject fired White House aide Oliver L. North's renewed
attempts to obtain secret documents concerning other covert
operations he participated in or that came to his attention.
   Independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh claimed in court papers
that North's latest request shows he wants ``to embark on a fishing
expedition into the nation's most sensitive classified materials.''
   He accused North of trying to ``convert the discovery rules into
a vehicle for rummaging through files that are irrelevant to the
charges in the indictment, thereby delaying the trial of this
matter.''
   North is awaiting trial on charges he conspired with President
Reagan's former national security adviser, John M. Poindexter, and
two arms dealers to divert U.S.-Iran arms sale profits to the
Nicaraguan rebels.
   His lawyers recently asked U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell
to reconsider his refusal to force the government to produce
classified documents about other covert operations that he knew
about or participated in while a National Security Council aide.
   North is requesting documents about covert operations that used
``commercial cutouts, foreign bank accounts, or other methods or
techniques similar to those allegedly used in connection with the
Iranian initiative or in connection with the support for the
Nicaraguan resistance.''
   Material sought includes documents about covert operations
undertaken ``without an express, written presidential finding''
authorizing the activity.
   Walsh contended that none of the materials is relevant to any
defense North might offer that he acted with authority of higher
government officials.
   No date has been set for North's trial.
   Gesell has also ordered separate trials for Poindexter and arms
dealers Albert Hakim and retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard V.
Secord.

<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Iraqi official acknowleged Friday
that his country used deadly chemical weapons in its 7{-year-old
war with Iran but claimed the Iranians had used them first.
   The comments by Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz appeared to be the
first direct admission that Iraq has used chemical weapons, which
are outlawed by international agreement.
   But Aziz defended his country's use of chemical weapons, saying
Iran was a ``great threat'' to Iraq.
   ``When we want peace, we have to respect all conventions. But
you cannot say I'm going to respect all these conventions and give
the other side the liberty not to respect them,'' Aziz told
reporters in Bonn.
   In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley
declined to comment on the acknowlegment by Aziz, except to repeat
that the United States had condemned the use of chemical weapons in
the Iran-Iraq war, which began in September 1980.
   A U.N. team arrived Friday in Tehran to investigate accusations
that Iraq used chemical weapons in a recent attack on Iran,
according to Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency.
   The IRNA report said Iraqi chemical weapons killed 60 people and
injured 4,000 in a June attack on the western Iranian city of
Ahwaz. Only 100 of the injured were hospitalized and 10 of those
were in critical condition, said the report, monitored in Nicosia.
   On April 25, U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar said
there was evidence that both countries were using chemical weapons
in their war.
   The U.N. chief had sent a physician from Geneva to visit Iran
and Iraq and examine victims of alleged chemical attacks. On May 9,
the U.N. Security Council condemned the use of chemical weapons in
the Iran-Iraq war.
   ``The U.N. report says both sides have used them (chemical
weapons),'' Aziz said. ``Iran started its use. We were victims many
times, since the early beginning of the conflict.''
   Asked if it was true both sides had used such weapons during the
conflict, Aziz replied: ``Both sides.''
   Iran also claims Iraq killed 5,000 people, mostly Iraqi Kurds,
in a mustard gas and cyanide attack on the Iranian-held Halabja
territory of Iraq last March.
   Iraq did not deny the charge then and said it would use all
necessary means to repel Iranian forces. It also accused Iran of
using chemical weapons.
   Iran denies that its forces have used such weapons.
   Aziz also accused Iran of violating international accords on the
treatment of prisoners.
   ``Lately 7,000 Iraqi prisoners of war disappeared. We don't yet
know what their destiny is,'' said Aziz.
   Aziz repeated assertions that Iran started the war by invading
Iraq and that his country had the right to choose the means for its
defense.
   But the Tehran government blames Iraq for starting the war,
pointing out that Iraq bombed Iranian airfields in September 1980
and saying Iran's military responded to that attack.
   Aziz also said that Iraq's recent war successes do not mean that
his country has changed its position of wanting to find a peaceful
solution to the conflict.
   ``We hope they (Iran) will draw the correct conclusions from the
present situation _ that the path to war leads ... only to
continued killing and destruction,'' he said. ``But the question
still remains whether they will reach that reasonable conclusion.''

<HEAD>Soviet Delegate Urges Approval of Compromise Draft</HEAD>

<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union, West Germany and France
on Friday praised a compromise proposal at the stalled 35-nation
conference on European security.
   Speaking at a plenary meeting, Soviet chief delegate Yuri
Kashlev indirectly criticized Romania, an East-bloc ally.
   He said the question facing the conference is whether it can
overcome a ``game of extremist counter-amendments'' that could sink
the compromise package worked out by nine neutral and nonaligned
countries last month.
   The Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe began in
November 1986. It is being attended by all signatories to the 1975
Helsinki conference including the United States, Canada and all
European states except Albania.
   Romanian delegate Dumitru Aninoiu reportedly rejected at an
earlier meeting most of the human rights provisions in the
compromise plan, saying the nations that drafted the proposal had
bowed to Western demands.
   Kashlev, referring to the Romanian position, said Friday the
question ``now is whether we will be able to adopt a final document
representing a new word in the (conference), particularly in the
military and humanitarian fields, or whether we will fail to do so
because some states are playing a game of extremist
counter-amendments in an attempt to ignore the legitimate,
reasonable and minimalistic positions of other delegations.''
   His unusual criticism of a Soviet-bloc member came as West
German and French foreign ministers Friday joined other delegates
in praising the compromise plan designed to end the deadlocked
conference.
   ``The overall draft ... is a forward looking document that
offers a basis for consensus and thus to our concluding efforts,''
West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher told the
conference. ``We must not lose any more time.''
   Foreign Minister Roland Dumas of France said the proposal, which
also calls for the convening of a human rights conference, ``is not
only the base the 35 nations can work on, but also the balancing
point'' that could lead to a final agreement.
   Neither Genscher nor Dumas indicated when they thought the
conference might end.
   Among the remaining obstacles are Romania's opposition to the
compromise and NATO and Soviet-bloc differences on whether to keep
tactical nuclear weapons off the agenda, as the West insists.
   A final document must receive the approval of all 35 nations.
   Genscher, referring to Romania, said the principle of consensus
``does not imply that a state can cling to proposals for which,
during the long negotiations, it has been unable to gain the
support of any other participating state.''
   Dumas told reporters he planned to confer with Romanian
delegates in search of a solution. ``I can't say that the Romanian
attitude will block the conference,'' he said.

   A jury Friday convicted Gary Heidnik of
murdering two of six women he abducted and kept shackled in his
basement torture chamber.
   The case focused on whether Heidnik knew right from wrong when
he raped and killed women he lured to his North Philadelphia home.
The defense argued he is schizophrenic and not responsible for his
actions.
   Heidnik, 44, was convicted of first-degree murder, kidnapping,
rape, aggravated assault and involuntary deviate sexual
intercourse. He was acquitted of one count of the latter charge.
   Judge Lynne Abraham set Saturday morning for the start of a
penalty hearing. Prosecutors have said they would seek the death
penalty.
   Jurors, chosen in Pittsburgh because of pretrial publicity here,
began deliberating Wednesday afternoon, and issued their verdict at
3:30 p.m. Friday. ``Thank God it was guilty of first-degree,'' said
Teresa Lomax, sister of Sandra Lindsay, one of the women who died
in Heidnik's house and who according to testimony had been sawed
apart, some of her remains fed to other captives.
   ``Thank God that the jury listened to the case,'' she said. ``He
deserved, `Guilty, guilty, guilty.' Now I'm hoping for the death
penalty. That was a brutal way for my sister to die, tortured.
Nobody deserves to die like that.''
   Another victim's sister, Diane Dudley, whose sister Debbie was
electrocuted when Heidnik touched live wires to her chains while
she stood in a water-filled pit, said, ``I feel good. He got what
he deserved.''
   ``Now I hope he gets the chair and Debbie can rest in peace,''
Ms. Dudley said.
   Defense attorney A. Charles Peruto Jr. called the verdict ``a
big letdown.'' He said Heidnik spoke to him after the verdict but
declined to reveal the conversation.
   ``Whatever he said, he had no emotion,'' Peruto said.
   Assistant District Attorney Charles Gallagher said, ``The jury
did an excellent job.
   ``It is a difficult task for a jury to perform, that is, to sit
in judgment upon one's peer. This case presented very difficult and
complicated legal issues, all of which the jury pondered for quite
a bit of time and came to a just decision.''
   During the polling of the jury, the 44-year-old Heidnik stared
straight ahead, showing no emotion.
   The sole innocent verdict came in a charge involving Josefina
Rivera, a prostitute Heidnik seized in November 1986.
   It was Ms. Rivera who eventually escaped and brought police to
Heidnik's so-called ``House of Horrors,'' where he had imprisoned
the women.
   Peruto had argued Heidnik was insane, a ``fruitcake'' who
suffered from schizophrenia first diagnosed in 1963, for which he
was discharged from the Army.
   ``This man conducted repeated sadistic acts on six defenseless
persons,'' Gallagher argued. ``What he did was premeditated,
deliberate murder. He knew what he was doing and he knew it was
wrong.''

   Space workers will hold a special
Fourth of July ceremony when they move Discovery to the launch pad
to be readied for the first space shuttle mission since the
Challenger tragedy.
   One of the five astronauts slated to fly the early September
mission and NASA officials will watch from a flag-bedecked
grandstand as the spaceship is rolled out of an assembly building
into the glare of spotlights at 12:01 a.m. Monday.
   Discovery will be perched upright on a giant tracked transporter
for the six-to-seven-hour trip over a 4.2-mile course to Launch Pad
39B.
   The move is timed to avoid thunderstorms and lightning, which
often occur during the daytime this time of year.
   In a brief ceremony as the move begins, Forrest S. McCartney,
director of the Kennedy Space Center, will present the astronaut
with a book containing signatures of the 15,240 workers here who
have labored to return the shuttle fleet to space.
   Commander Rick Hauck and his crew, Dick Covey, George Nelson,
Mike Lounge and Dave Hilmers, will take the book into space with
them on a four-day mission. Hilmers planned to be here for the
rollout ceremony.
   After Discovery is on the pad, employees and their families will
be able to drive by between 8 a.m. and 11 a.m. Monday to get a
close look before a service structure encloses the spaceship.
   Jim Harrington, shuttle operations director here, said delays in
preparing Discovery placed the rollout date on the Fourth of July.
   ``We didn't plan it that way,'' he said. ``We had hoped to do it
earlier.''
   Asked if a rollout on the nation's birthday might have an
emotional impact, Harrington replied, ``No doubt it will have an
effect. The biggest effect and the biggest morale booster we can
give ourselves is to move the shuttle out to the pad, because
that's where it belongs. The name of the game here is to get the
vehicle ready to fly, and that's what we're going to do.''
   He said checks of systems will begin as soon as Discovery is on
the pad, and workers will begin preparing the spaceship for
critical firing of its three main engines on July 24. With the
craft bolted firmly to its launch mounts, the engines will be
ignited for 19.4 seconds to test modifications and to give the
launch team countdown practice.
   The shuttle fleet has been grounded since Challenger and its
crew of seven were lost in an explosion 73 seconds after liftoff
Jan. 28, 1986.
   Earlier this week, the space agency announced it had officially
delayed Discovery's launch from late August until early September
because it was taking longer than expected to prepare the vehicle.

   The prosecution sought a life
sentence Friday for a man charged with kidnapping Dutch supermarket
tycoon Gerrit-Jan Heijn, killing him and collecting $4 million in
ransom.
   Prosecutor Onno van der Veen made the demand after a day of
testimony in the trial of Ferdi Elsas, a 45-year-old unemployed
business consultant.
   Elsas is charged with abducting and killing Heijn, vice
president of the Ahold concern, the Netherlands biggest supermarket
chain.
   Ahold also owns the Giant Food and Bi-Lo supermarkets in the
United States.
   Van der Veen said Elsas ``killed a man in cold blood ...
according to a well-devised plan.'' Elsas has said he picked his
victim at random and planned the kidnapping for months.
   Heijn's family paid $4 million in cash and diamonds for his
release, but Elsas told the court Friday he had shot and killed the
56-year-old kidnap victim with a 9mm pistol near Heijn's makeshift
grave the day he was abducted.
   ``It was money and diamonds that motivated Elsas, and everything
else was subordinated to that,'' van der Veen said.
   The court said it would rule July 13.
   Under the Dutch penal system, a life sentence means 20 years'
imprisonment. A prisoner may be released for good behavior after
serving two-thirds of his term.
   Heijn disappeared Sept. 9 after leaving his home to go to a
dental appointment. His body was exhumed April 4 in a forest near
Renkum in the eastern Netherlands.
   Elsas gave the court on Friday a description of Heijn's final
hours:
   ``The two of us sat in the sun for a while and drank some orange
juice. He (Heijn) had never suspected what was going to happen to
him,'' Elsas said.
   Hank Heijn, the victim's widow, and three of their children
attended the trial.
   In October, when Heijn's kin demanded some sign he was alive,
they received his little finger. Elsas told police he cut the
finger off after he killed the grocery baron.
   At the end of the eight-hour trial, Elsas, reading from a
prepared statement, said: ``Words cannot compensate the loathsome
crimes I have committed and the immeasurable grief I have caused to
the Heijn family.
   ``I want to say that I am sorry. I now live in a nightmare from
which I shall never awake.''
   A forensic psychiatrist told the court Elsas was not fully
responsible for his deeds at the time of the abduction.
   If the court accepts that finding, it could impose a limited
jail sentence followed by open-ended confinement to an institution
for the criminally insane.
   Police arrested Elsas in a raid on his home in a small Amsterdam
suburb after a huge search.
   Elsas' arrest followed discovery of a 250-guilder note from the
ransom payment in January by a bank employee in the Dutch capital.
   The note was traced back to a supermarket where the suspect did
his shopping. Police recovered nearly all the ransom.

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev won Communist Party backing
Friday for sweeping changes that would limit top officials to 10
years in office and create a stronger presidency that he might
assume while remaining party chief.
   The four-day national conference of 5,000 party members, the
first since 1941, closed with Gorbachev saying the reforms would
point the way to a new ``democratic image of socialism.''
   He also found himself in the middle of an open feud between the
No. 2 Kremlin leader, Yegor K. Ligachev, and former Moscow party
chief Boris N. Yeltsin, which was played out on television and gave
millions of viewers an unprecedented look at cracks in the party
monolith.
   Alexander Lukyanov, secretary of the party Central Committee,
told a late-night news briefing that several resolutions were
approved.
   He said the conference backed Gorbachev's proposals to allow
elected party officials only two five-year terms, with no
exceptions.
   He also said the new, stronger presidency would have the powers
Gorbachev requested to settle matters of foreign policy and head
the Defense Council, a position traditionally held by the party
chief.
   Also approved was Gorbachev's controversial recommendation that
party leaders lead the corresponding legislatures, all the way up
to combining the job of president and party general secretary. That
could enable Gorbachev to take an even firmer grip on power by
assuming a stronger presidency while retaining the party leadership.
   Georgy Razumovsky, a non-voting member of the ruling Politburo,
said 209 delegates voted against that provision, an extremely rare
show of dissent in the party.
   An amendment calling for the party newspaper Pravda to be taken
away from the policy-making Central Committee and turned over to
the party as a whole received only 56 votes, said Tass, the
official news agency.
   Assessing the results of the conference just before it closed
late Friday night, Gorbachev said: ``Through democratization,
economic reform and changes in the political system we will make
perestroika irreversible. We will reach a fundamentally new state
of our society, a new humane and democratic image of socialism.''
   Perestroika, or restructuring, is the name Gorbachev has given
the ambitious reform program on which he embarked soon after
gaining the leadership in March 1985.
   In his final address, Gorbachev also proposed a final break with
the Stalinist past by building a monument in Moscow to the
dictator's millions of victims and said elections for stronger
local and national legislatures should be held next spring.
   Tass said Gorbachev presided over an ``unusually stormy and
long'' debate on resolutions. That reflected the extraordinary
spirit of open criticism permitted during the meeting.
   The main drama on the final day was provided by the bitter
personal dispute between Ligachev and Yeltsin. Gorbachev devoted
much of his final 40-minute speech to a critique of Yeltsin's work
as Moscow party chief before his dismissal last November.
   Yeltsin appealed to the conference to absolve him of any blame
for accusing entrenched bureaucracy of slowing down the pace of
reform. That criticism cost him his Moscow job and his non-voting
seat on the Politburo.
   He has identified Ligachev in foreign television interviews as
the official most responsible for holding up reforms, and called on
him to resign.
   Ligachev thundered back in a speech Friday that he made his
region self-sufficient in food while working as a party leader in
Siberia, but ``the district where you, Boris, worked for nine years
now has rationing of food.''
   Gorbachev broke in at one point to quiet delegates and make sure
Yeltsin could finish his address. As he closed the session he gave
a lengthy account of Yelstin's failings.
   Resolutions adopted by the conference were not published
immediately but Razumovsky, a Gorbachev protege, told the news
conference the Soviet leader has won his fight to reform the
political system.
   About the dissenting votes, Razumovsky said: ``Nothing of the
kind has happened for a long time at a similar forum.''
   In his closing remarks, Gorbachev said the Central Committee and
other party organs should settle questions of political reform on
an urgent basis so a fall session of the Supreme Soviet can begin
to implement it. He said elections for the new legislatures could
be held next April.
   Referring to his proposals for a new 2,250-member Chamber of
People's Deputies, a smaller and more active Supreme Soviet, and
for presidential powers over defense and foreign policy, he said:
``the conference will continue living in the society, in the
discussions in the society, but now we know how we must transform
the political system.''
   Stalin has become the object of increasingly sharp criticism
since Gorbachev's glasnost policy of greater openness made such
comment possible, but the decision to build a monument to his
victims is the most definitive step Soviet authorities have taken
to repudiate him.
   ``I think we must agree to this, and such a monument must be
constructed in Moscow,'' Gorbachev said. ``This would be an honest
step, and it will be supported by the entire Soviet people.''

   Ethiopia said Friday its forces
have recaptured two more towns from rebels in northern Tigre
province, leaving only one key center in guerrilla hands.
   State radio said the 3rd Revolutionary Army drove guerrillas of
the Tigrean People's Liberation Front from Axum and Adwa, about 70
miles northwest of the Tigrean capital of Mekelle, in an ongoing
counteroffensive this week.
   Rebels seized all the main towns in the province except Mekelle
in February and March.
   In the previous 10 days, the Marxist government led by Mengistu
Haile Mariam has reported recapturing all key centers except
Inda-Selassie, about 40 miles west of Axum.
   State radio reports suggested the guerrillas were driven into
the barren mountains of western Tigre.
   There was no way to verify independently government or rebel
communiques about insurgencies which have raged for 14 years in
Tigre and 27 years in neighboring Eritrea province.
   Eritrean guerrillas are fighting for control of the province.
Tigreans demand more autonomy for their area.

   China on Friday urged all Cambodian factions to
form a coalition government as Vietnam withdraws its forces,
shifting policy in an apparent effort to keep the Cambodian Khmer
Rouge from becoming dominant.
   China said that once an interim government is established, ``a
freeze should be imposed on Kampuchean (Cambodian) forces of all
factions and these factions should refrain from'' interfering in
free general elections.
   The Chinese government, the main ally of the communist Khmer
Rouge and other factions in Cambodia's anti-Vietnamese resistance,
previously insisted no national reconciliation could take place in
Cambodia until Vietnam withdrew all its troops. Vietnam invaded
Cambodia in late 1978, ousted the Khmer Rouge government and
installed another communist regime.
   Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen and some countries, including
the United States, have expressed concern that Vietnam's withdrawal
will create an opening for the Khmer Rouge to again seize power.
   The Khmer Rouge came to power after defeating the U.S.-backed
government in the spring of 1975. According to some estimates, up
to 3 million Cambodians were killed under the Khmer Rouge regime.
   China has backed a three-party anti-Vietnamese coalition headed
by former Cambodian Prince Norodom Sihanouk. The coalition includes
Sihanouk's followers, the Khmer Rouge and a non-communist group
under Son Sann.
   The Khmer Rouge is believed to have a stronger fighting force
than its coalition partners.
   In a proposal issued by the Foreign Ministry, China said Vietnam
should withdraw all of its estimated 140,000 troops ``at the
earliest possible date,'' and the three resistance groups and Hun
Sen should form a provisional government headed by Sihanouk while
Vietnam pulls out.
   Vietnam said this week it had begun withdrawing 50,000 troops
and its military command from Cambodia in an operation to be
completed in December. It said it will have removed all of its
forces by 1990.
   The Foreign Ministry proposal called for ``practical and
effective international supervision'' of Vietnam's troop
withdrawal, the maintenance of peace in Cambodia and free elections.
   It did not elaborate on which countries it envisioned joining in
the supervision or if they should send troops to form a
peacekeeping force.
   China's proposal appeared timed for consideration by the four
Cambodian parties at informal talks to be held in Indonesia later
this month.
   Its conciliatory tone was in sharp contrast to other recent
Chinese statements that have called Vietnam's troop withdrawal plan
inadequate and a possible hoax.
   The U.S. State Department said last week that China had signaled
in private its willingness to support a Cambodian government
without the Khmer Rouge, but China's Foreign Ministry denied that.
   The new statement, however, appeared an effort to acknowledge
concern over the Khmer Rouge and guard against the group taking
sole power.

   A bomb exploded outside the Angolan
national airline in the capital city of Luanda, injuring 10 people,
the official Angolan news agency ANGOP said Friday.
   The blast on Thursday damaged the front of the building that
houses the airline TAAG, the agency said in a report monitored in
Lisbon.
   ANGOP blamed unidentified ``enemies of the Angolan people'' for
what it said what a terrorist action aimed at civilians. ANGOP said
10 people were hurt, but gave no particulars.
   Also Friday, the Angolan rebel movement UNITA said it killed 82
soldiers, including three Cubans, in five attacks in four provinces
Tuesday and Thursday.
   It listed rebel casualties as one killed and 24 wounded.
   UNITA, standing for the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola, said in a statement distributed in Lisbon
its actions included a commando raid Wednesday night on workshops
at the railroad station in the central city of Huambo.
   The rebels said they killed 22 soldiers and destroyed machinery,
warehouses and offices at the station on the Benguela Railroad, the
main route for transporting minerals from Zambia, Zaire, and
eastern Angola to the Atlantic port of Lobito.
   UNITA, supported by the United States and South Africa, has been
fighting since 1975 to force the Marxist government of Angola to
share power.
   The Soviet Union and Cuba support the government.
   The southern African nation is a former Portuguese colony.

   Secretary of State George P. Shultz
ended a visit to Central America Friday and leaders of Nicaraguan
guerrillas said they discussed with him ways to win congressional
approval for aid to the rebels.
   Alfredo Cesar, a leader of the rebels known as Contras, met with
Shultz on Thursday and later said the package discussed could
include direct U.S. aid to the leftist Sandinista government if it
fulfills promised democratic reforms.
   The United States cut all aid to the Nicaraguan government in
1981.
   Shultz spent six hours in San Jose after a flight from
Guatemala, where another rebel leader, Adolfo Calero, said there
was discussion on a $30 million aid package for the insurgents.
   Calero said there have been informal talks about the possibility
of setting aside $7 million and releasing it as military aid the
Sandinistas do not meet promises for greater democracy.
   All sides agreed that no decisions have been made on a Contra
aid package. The Reagan administration has said only that Congress
will be asked to approve an unspecified amount of additional
assistance.
   The rebels have received no military aid since Feb. 29. Congress
approved a $17 million humanitarian aid package in late March after
the rebels and the Sandinistas agreed on a temporary truce.
   Calero said Shultz responded positively to the idea of a new aid
package in which a portion would be earmarked for military
assistance and placed in an escrow account.
   ``There is no doubt in my mind that he's very enthusiastic about
it, very enthusiastic,'' Calero said.
   Reagan administration officials accompanying Shultz seemed
annoyed that the Contra aid issue was deflecting attention from
Shultz's principal message during his three-day tour of Costa Rica,
El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala: that the region's democratic
countries are progressing while Nicaragua is lagging far behind.
   At an airport arrival ceremony in San Jose attended by hundreds
of flag-waving school children, Shultz said there has been a
two-thirds decline in living standards in Nicaragua over the past
four months.
   But Shultz did not mention a new aid package for the Contras.
   Shultz met with Costa Rican President Oscar Arias and then told
reporters at a news conference only that the administration is
``seeking obviously to support those who stand up and are ready to
struggle'' against the Sandinistas.
   Arias said Shultz had proposed a meeting with the foreign
ministers of the four countries he visited to be held before a
scheduled Central American summit that would include Nicaragua in
early August.
   Arias, who won last year's Nobel Peace Prize for his regional
peace plan, said the Shultz suggestion specifically excluded
Nicaragua from the proposed foreign ministers meeting.
   He also said he told Shultz that talks between the Sandinistas
and Contras have not failed yet and suggested neither side has put
its final bargaining position on the table. Arias said he hoped the
two sides would agree to meet this month.
   The idea of approving military aid and placing it in an escrow
account has been discussed in recent weeks by pro-Contra lawmakers
in Washington.
   Calero said he expects legislation to be introduced soon in the
Senate, with the campaign spearheaded by Democratic Sens. David
Boren of Oklahoma and Ernest Hollings of South Carolina.
   Joining them is Sen. Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H., Calero said.
   According to Calero, the aid package would be for the six-month
period between October 1988 and March 1989.
   The most innovative aspect of the aid proposal is the pledge to
provide economic aid to the Sandinistas if they meet Contra demands
for democratization.
   Cesar, meeting with reporters Thursday, called the package a
``carrot and stick'' approach, noting that Sandinista
non-compliance with promised reformed would trigger military aid
for the Contras.
   The Carter administration sought to woo the Sandinistas with
economic aid after the triumph of the revolution in July 1979.
About $120 million was spent, but the Reagan administration
suspended the program in April 1981, citing alleged Sandinista
efforts to export their revolution.
   Shultz said Friday that the Sandinistas are continuing to
subvert their neighbors.
   ``I want to make it absolutely clear that the United States will
not tolerate the subversion or destabilization of the democratic
governments of Central America,'' Shultz said.

   Salvage workers on Friday sawed in
two the wreck of a sunken tanker loaded with a deadly chemical as a
preliminary to raising the hulk, Dutch television reported.
   None of the Dutch-flagged Anna Broere's cargo of 1,600 tons of
highly toxic acrylonitrile leaked from its tanks during the
hourlong operation, the TV report said.
   Salvage crews fled on Thursday when an acrylonitrile tank sprang
a leak during efforts to lift the ship, but no injuries were
reported.
   The chemical, a highly carcinogenic and inflammable agent, is
used by the plastics industry.
   Workers on Friday used a 16-ton chain to separate the ship's aft
section, which contains the engine room, from the fore part, where
the tanks are, the report said. It said this was done to facilitate
hoisting the wreck to the surface later.
   The sawing operation marked the latest episode in efforts to
salvage the ship and its hazardous cargo after the Anna Broere
collided with a freighter 40 miles off the Netherlands on May 27.
   The 180-foot fore section and the 60-foot aft section are
expected to be raised over the weekend, the report said.
   A first attempt to salvage the Anna Broere failed last month
when two of the four steel cables holding the vessel broke.
   A coast guard official said water samples taken Thursday showed
a sudden increase in the levels of acrylonitrile in the water at
the site, and divers quickly boarded small boats kept nearby for
emergencies.
   The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that at
about 9.30 p.m. Thursday, the levels rose to more than seven times
the amount considered safe by the Dutch Environment Ministry.

   About 220 West German environmentalists scampered
over a 13-foot-high section of the Berlin Wall into Communist
territory Friday to dodge police trying to clear them away from a
disputed spot near the wall.
   Most of them returned to West Berlin later in the day. Police
said nine protesters were arrested, but eight were released later.
   Authorities issued a removal order Friday after a 5-week
struggle that pitted environmentalists against city developers. The
demonstrators were protesting plans to build a highway through a
nearby park.
   When more than 900 West Berlin police moved in to chase away the
squatters, the protesters were already perched on the wall.
   They had earlier declared they would seek ``political asylum''
in East Berlin if West German police tried to remove them.
   East German border guards helped the protesters over the
communist-built barrier, which splits Berlin into Allied and
communist sectors. Some guards backed trucks up to the eastern side
of the wall to make it easier for the environmentalists to jump
down and escape West Berlin police.
   One smiling East German guard helped one protester by pulling
his bicycle over the wall. Others greeted cheering protesters with
coffee, warm sausages and cigarettes.
   The protesters were occupying a 10-acre piece of land which
formally came under West Berlin's control at one minute after
Thursday midnight. Before then, police could not legally enter the
area.
   The property was handed over under a deal worked out with East
Berlin this year.
   The protesters began occupying the land May 26. They set up a
shantytown and put up barriers to protect themselves from police.
   The area became the scene of frequent violent skirmishes between
police and demonstrators. Protesters often attacked police with
bottles, stones and gasoline bombs. Officers responded with tear
gas and water cannons.
   West Berlin officials have repeatedly asked protesters to leave
the area, saying it could contain live ammunition from World War
II. The area, not far from where Nazi leader Adolf Hitler's bunker
was located, was the scene of fierce battles in the final days of
World War II.
   Officials have said plans for the proposed highway are not yet
finalized and have charged that many of the protesters are intent
only on provoking violence with authorities.
   East Germany's state-run newspaper Neues Deutschland last week
reported West Berlin police were using ``terror tactics'' against
the protesters, indicating offical Communist approval of the
environmentalists' actions.

released Friday.
   The report shows that Glenn made between $1,280,906 and

reports by May 15. Glenn requested and was granted an extension.
   The reports are only guideposts to actual wealth because

   Glenn's largest holdings include interest in Florida hotels. His
income included his $89,900 Senate salary, rent, dividends and
capital gains from the sale of stock. He also listed a Marine Corps

<HEAD>Criminal Libel Charges Against Editor Dropped</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID REED</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A prosecutor dropped criminal libel
charges against a weekly newspaper editor Friday at the request of
two legislators who said the case was causing the poor, rural area
too much adverse publicity.
   State Rep. B.J. Gordon and state Sen. Frank McGill, whom editor
Jim Fitts accused of unspecified corruption and stealing, delivered
letters to Solicitor Wade Kolb on Friday asking him to drop the
charges.
   ``I see no useful purpose in furthering the prosecution of Jim
Fitts,'' McGill said in his letter. ``I realize that vengeance is
not mine but God's,''
   Gordon, a Baptist minister, wrote, ``God in his own time will
rectify all situations.''
   Kolb, who agreed to drop the rarely used counts of criminal
libel, said of Gordon and McGill: ``Even though both felt seriously
harmed, they didn't want to harm (Williamsburg) County. ... They
were distressed by the negative publicity that has made the county
look bad.''
   Fitts, the 62-year-old editor of a small weekly newspaper, The
Voice, was indicted by a grand jury Monday and faced a possible
sentence of a year in jail if he was convicted. He was not
immediately available for comment on Friday's action, a newspaper
employee said.
   Wallace Connor, the attorney for the lawmakers, said: ``Nobody
ever thought this would reach the proportions that it did. I've
never in my 40 years of practice here seen anything that got such
national attention.''
   The case set off a legal battle involving First Amendment rights
that caught the attention of journalists across the United States.
It was only the fourth criminal libel suit involving journalists in
South Carolina in 40 years and the first in the nation since 1984.
   In his column of May 17, Fitts, who is black, wrote, in part:
``I will say to you, without fear of contradiction, if every black
in Williamsburg County would start stealing today and steal every
day for the rest of their lives, they could not steal as much as
those two have stolen during their time in power.'' He did not
elaborate.
   Gordon, who is black, and McGill, who is white, signed warrants
against Fitts shortly after reading the column.
   The two politicians have denied Fitts' charges.
   But The State newspaper reported Friday that an investigation
completed in February by the State Law Enforcement Division
concluded that Gordon, while chairman of a center for mentally
retarded adults that he founded in 1976, diverted state grant money
and used it for personal benefit.
   A prosecutor concluded there was not enough evidence of criminal
activity to present to a grand jury, the law enforcement division
said.
   Connor said the State story had nothing to do with Gordon's
decision to drop the libel charge. ``I didn't see that there's
anything there (in the State story) that would have justified him
(Fitts) saying what he did in the newspaper,'' Connor said.
   Kolb said Gordon and McGill told him last week that they were
going to ask him to drop the charges after the grand jury
indictment was unsealed Monday.
   Although McGill said, ``I trust that the matter will be laid to
rest,'' the American Civil Liberties Union is considering asking
permission from Fitts to ask a judge to declare the state's
criminal libel law unconstitional, state ACLU director Steve Bates
said Friday.
   ``In any event this whole affair points out the need to abolish
the criminal libel statute, because it is an invitation to
politicians to intimidate and silence their opponents in an attempt
to hide the truth,'' Bates said.

   The front stoop and archway of a Manhattan
apartment building collapsed Friday, killing two girls and
seriously injuring a third, authorities said.
   The bodies of two girls, one 10 and the other 11, were recovered
by rescue workers, according to Lt. Mitchell Stern of Emergency
Medical Services.
   A 13-year-old girl was in critical but stable condition with
multiple trauma, said John Clark, administrator on duty at Bellevue
Hospital.
   The accident occurred at 3:10 p.m. when decayed ironwork
supporting a granite facade and a staircase gave way, officials
said.
   ``They had rotted over the years _ they're 100 years old _ and
they had not been adequately maintained and they rusted,'' said
Mayor Edward I. Koch who visited the scene Friday evening.
   ``I heard a thud and there was some smoke rising up,'' said Bob
Shapiro, 30, an emergency technician who lives across the street.
   ``There were hands reaching out of the rubble. There were hands
of a little girl. We were removing the rubble and the next thing I
knew the police were right behind us,'' said Shapiro.
   One elderly woman complained of chest pains when she and about
60 other people were evacuated from the building. She received
medical treatment at the scene.
   The names of the victims were withheld pending notification of
relatives.

<HEAD>U.S. Military Attache Transferred After Seized By Customs Agents</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Diplomatic sources said Friday that a
U.S. military attache left Portugal after customs agents detained
him and claimed he was illegally taking photographs of an Iranian
ship in the port of Setubal.
   A newspaper had reported the attache, Navy Capt. William Barney,
was expelled but that account was denied by both the U.S. Embassy
and the diplomatic sources, who spoke with condition they not be
identified.
   The sources said the Portuguese government expressed its
displeasure to the United States over the incident earlier this
year and Barney was transferred in May at the end of a three-year
tour of duty.
   A report in the weekly Independent newspaper had said Barney was
expelled and left Lisbon Wednesday. It later acknowleged it might
have erred about the date of the attache's departure.
   U.S. Embassy spokeswoman My Chau Bui-Griffin said Barney left
Portugal in early May following routine transfer orders from
Washington. She said Barney had served as naval attache in Lisbon
since March 1985. She declined comment on the Independent's story.
   According to the diplomatic sources, Barney was detained by
customs agents while photographing an Iranian ship loading arms in
Setubal, 25 miles south of Lisbon.
   Setubal is the port where arms sold by Portuguese state-owned
companies to both Iran and Iraq are loaded for shipment. Iran and
Iraq have been at war since September 1980.
   Photographing some state-owned installations is prohibited by
Portuguese law.
   The diplomatic sources did not specify when Barney allegedly was
detained, but the state-run television network RTP said the
incident occurred in the first week of April. It said the
government advised Washington not to renew Barney's posting in
Lisbon.
   The Portuguese Foreign Ministry declined comment on the reports.
   Portugal and the United States are allies in the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization.

<HEAD>Publisher Says Private Probe Showed Iran Ordered Premier Killed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CECILIA LONNELL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A publisher who ran a private
investigation into the unsolved 1986 assassination of Prime
Minister Olof Palme said Friday he believed Palme was killed on
orders from Iran.
   Ebbe Carlsson said Iran wanted Palme eliminated because he was
ending illegal deliveries of Swedish arms to the Tehran government
and because he was appointed by the United Nations to mediate an
end to the Iran-Iraq war.
   A gunman shot and killed Palme on a Stockholm street on Feb. 28,
1986. Police have failed to establish a motive and have offered a
$8.3 million reward for the killer.
   Carlsson is employed at Bonniers, one of Sweden's main
publishing houses which publishes everything from books to weekly
magazines.
   The disclosure of Carlsson's unofficial probe created a
political storm and led to the resignation June 7 of Justice
Minister Anna Greta Lejion, who approved his secret mission and
wrote a letter of introduction to foreign intelligence agencies.
   Carlsson said he was pursuing a possible Middle East connection
to the assassination, a link that police investigated but failed to
prove.
   Critics said Carlsson's maverick operation bordered on the
illegal _ his bodyguard was caught smuggling outlawed surveillance
equipment into Sweden _ and added nothing to the official probe.
   Breaking his silence over the episode, Carlsson said on Swedish
radio: ``Iran is conducting a holy war, where they put everything
into the survival of their nation, and they did not want any
mediation or meddling.''
   He also said, ``I think that Olof Palme was murdered because
Iran felt it was more difficult to buy war material since he had
become premier (in 1982).''
   Iran and Iraq have been at war since September 1980.
   Carlsson indicated he believed Iran contracted the murder to
Kurdish extremists living in Sweden who also had a grudge against
Palme.
   Several reports during the police investigation mentioned a
small group of leftist Kurdish exiles known as the Kurdish Workers
Party as perhaps organizing the killing. The Kurds are an ethnic
group seeking a separate state in part of Iran and Iraq.
   The Palme government had classified the group as a terrorist
organization and sentenced two of its alleged members to life in
prison for the killing of two defectors from the group.
   Carlsson said police received ``a lot of tips about the behavior
of the Kurds in connection with the murder,'' and that ``my simple
contribution'' was drawing a possible link between the two theories.
   Attorney General Hans Stark said Friday he would open a
preliminary investigation against two Security Police officers who
gave Carlsson classified information on the Palme case.
   But Stark, releasing a 42-page report on the Carlsson incident,
cleared the heads of the Security Police and the national police of
irregular behavior.

   The grownups paid $40 a ticket without a
murmur and the children proved that kids are kids the world over
when the Greatest Show on Earth made its debut in this very
unfamiliar part of the world on Friday.
   The Ringling Bros. and Barnum and Bailey Circus roused some
familiar reactions even though it was performing 5,000 miles from
home. The cavorting clowns and the dancing elephants still helped
make the Big Top a big hit.
   Ringmaster Dinny McGuire was ecstatic about the reception here
following the afternoon performance and Susannah Smith, vice
president for public relations, said the evening performance ``went
even better.''
   ``Some of the kids were dancing in the aisles,'' she said.
   ``We have been prepared for a reserved, quiet crowd. This is not
Texas,'' McGuire said after the first performance.
   ``But they clapped fervently ... I did not expect them to be as
overwhelmingly demonstrative in their response.''
   The first Ringling show ever to play in Japan opened in a huge
tent in this northern city, its first time under canvas in 32
years, won the hearts of a reserved but less-than-capacity audience
of about 4,000 people.
   After slow start, the audience warmed to the troupe and
applauded enthusiastically.
   ``I told you this during the dress rehersal, but today was the
real test because we had real people _ and they loved it,'' circus
owner Kenneth Feld told the 200 members of his troupe after the
show.
   ``You really are `the greatest show on Earth,''' Feld said.
   Feld has brought an all new version of the 118-year-old show to
Japan as an experiment.
   It will give 44 performances in Sapporo, then 96 shows in Tokyo
in August and September. Feld said the circus will go on to play in
Osaka in southern Japan in October before returning home.
   The testing of the Japanese entertainment waters comes at a time
when the Bolshoi Circus from the Soviet Union, already well-known
here, also is touring Japan.
   But Feld says the Soviets ``don't compare with us. They're very
plodding. They can't match our rhythm and tempo. That's the secret.
Tempo.''
   The Ringling tour of Japan is being promoted locally by the
Japan Educational Association, which asked Feld to bring a show as
big as the two Ringling troupes touring the United States, said
show publicist Joe Gold.
   Feld also liked the idea because Japan is a wealthy nation that
can afford hefty admission prices, Gold said. Adult tickets went
for $40, about four times the average price in the United States.
   Feld created a new ``gold unit'' with the best of the acts from
the ``blue'' and ``red'' units touring America, and world-class
acts from other countries.
   To help audiences here understand the acts, ringmaster McGuire
had to learn his introductions and explanations in Japanese. Also,
Japanese characters were put on many of the clown costumes to
identify them to the children.
   Finally, ``we brought in 120 kids last week'' for a dry run,
Gold said. ``We ... went through the clown routines to find out
what worked and what didn't.''
   Feld said the production cost $10 million, including $8 million
for the tent.
   After Friday's matinee, a smiling Mrs. Sachiko Okawara, asked
about performance, said she liked ``The performers, the animals,
the costumes, the lights _ and the band. The band was beautiful.''
   For 5-year-old Miku Kusakabo, the list of favorite items was
much shorter: ``The elephants,'' she said through an interpreter,
and nodded vigorously when asked if she wanted to come back again.

   China marked the 67th anniversary Friday of the
founding of its Communist Party by issuing a new party theoretical
journal and by cautioning the 47 million party members that their
mission is a serious one.
   ``Each member from the day he joins the party is constantly
tested,'' the party newspaper People's Daily said in a front-page
editorial. ``As times change, so do the tasks and the tests.''
   It said members' main tasks now are to uphold China's
market-style economic reforms and fight growing corruption that has
accompanied the new prosperity.
   ``There are a handful of members, including some officials ...
who instead of using their power to benefit the people and the
country abuse it for personal gains,'' the paper said. ``We must
resolutely expel (them).''
   China's Communist Party convened its first congress on July 1,
1921, at a girls' school in Shanghai's foreign quarter. When police
got word of the session, delegates fled to nearby Hangzhou and
finished their meeting in a boat on a scenic lake, posing as
holiday-makers.
   Fewer and fewer members today are interested in Marxist
ideology, as evidenced by the creation of the new, livelier party
journal.
   The old party bi-monthly, Red Flag (Hong Qi), which put out its
last issue in June, carried lengthy, jargon-laden essays on such
topics as the relationship between art and the masses and ``Basing
Planning Work On the Foundation of the Law of Value.''
   The new journal, called Seek Truth (Qiu Shi), takes its name
from senior leader Deng Xiaoping's pragmatic slogan, ``Seek truth
from facts.'' He advanced the slogan in the 1970s as a counterpoint
to Mao Tse-tung's emphasis on theory and the ideology of class
struggle.

<TEXT>
   A high Panamanian official accused the
United States on Friday of preparing for a military intervention of
Panama, probably over the Fourth of July holiday weekend.
   Jose Maria Cabrera, Panama's vice minister of foreign affairs,
told a news conference that evidence of ``imminent military
action'' included troop mobilization in the Canal Zone. He said his
government was convinced that President Reagan ``has decided to
pass from a policy of destabilization and economic aggression to
one of armed aggression.''
   ``We consider the threat is very serious and we feel it is
necessary to denounce it before the governments of Latin America
and the world,'' Cabrera said following a meeting of Latin American
diplomats here.
   He said ``armed action'' could take place within days, probably
over the weekend as the United States celebrates its Declaration of
Independence.
   Cabrera claimed that U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz's
mission to Central America was to gain regional support for U.S.
policy in Panama.
   The United States has tried to force out Panama's de facto
ruler, Defense Forces chief Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, since
Noriega was indicted last February on U.S. drug trafficking charges.

   More than 100,000 cases of AIDS have been reported
worldwide, with more than half of them in the United States, the
World Health Organization said Friday.
   The Geneva-based group said the United States listed 65,099 AIDS
cases, the highest national total and a 5.7 percent increase in 2{
months. The U.S. rate of 8.9 cases per 100,000 is the highest in
the industrialized world.
   WHO said 138 countries reported a total of 100,410 cases by June
30. The May 30 total stood at 96,433 cases worldwide.
   Organization officials, however, estimate there are more than
150,000 cases and that 5 million to 10 million people may carry the
HIV virus, which causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
   According to the WHO figures, AIDS cases were registered for the
first time in Sierra Leone, which had three cases, and the islands
of Comoros, which had one case.
   A special survey of 30 European nations said that male
homosexuals made up 56 percent of AIDS victims, followed by
intravenous drug abusers at 21 percent and heterosexuals at 7
percent.
   The breakdown varied among individual nations.
   Among AIDS victims in Britain, the share of drug abusers was
only 2 percent, while that of homosexuals was 84 percent. In Spain,
54 percent were drug abusers and 23 percent were homosexuals.
   AIDS is caused by a virus that wrecks the body's immune system,
leaving victims susceptible to infections and cancer.
   It is spread most often through sexual contact, needles or
syringes shared by drug abusers, infected blood or blood products,
and from pregnant women to their offspring.

   Anatoly Karpov defeated Garri Kasparov in
the 14th round Friday, cutting the world champion's lead in World
Chess Cup competition to one game. Kasparov resigned on his 38th
move.
   With only one round remaining, Kasparov leads with 10.5, one
point ahead of his fellow Soviet. Kasparov is assured at least a
tie for first place even if he loses his final game Sunday and
Karpov wins, since a win counts one point and a draw one-half.
   Experts said Karpov's victory demonstrated that he remains
remains a threat to Kasparov's domination of international chess.
   With Karpov playing white, the players followed a variation of
the Gruenfeld defense that occurred several times during their 1987
world title match in Seville, Spain.
   Afterward, Karpov told reporters: ``I stood better throughout
the game.'' Asked about the two games he lost to Kasparov during an
Amsterdam tournament in May, he said, ``I think this result was
more important.''
   The two Soviet players' bitter personal and professional rivalry
has stretched over a record series of matches totaling 129 games _
19 victories for Kasparov, 17 for Karpov and the rest draws.
Kasparov, 25, took the championship from Karpov, who is 12 years
older.
   The tournament at Belfort, in eastern France, is the second of
six making up the World Chess Cup, in which the world's top 24
players are competing for total prizes of $1.2 million. It is
widely regarded as the most important chess event after the world
championship.
   In the final round Sunday, Kasparov will play Andrei Sokolov of
the Soviet Union and Karpov is pitted against Boris Spassky, a
former world champion who is a native of the Soviet Union but lives
in France.

   An 8-month-old boy who became the world's
youngest transplant recipient by receiving a heart three hours
after his birth headed back to his Canadian home Friday.
   Paul Holc made such good progress since the Oct. 16 transplant
that doctors at Loma Linda University Medical Center let him go
home sooner than the usual one-year wait for baby transplant
recipients, a hospital spokeswoman said.
   The blond, blue-eye child slept in his mother's arms at Los
Angeles International Airport as they waited for a 2:10 p.m. plane
to Vancouver, British Columbia.
   Nine weeks before Paul was born, doctors discovered through a
prenatal procedure that he had a hypoplastic left heart syndrome, a
fatal heart defect that made a transplant a necessity.
   Paul received a donor heart from a brain-dead Canadian girl.
   The procedure was done by Dr. Leonard Bailey, the Loma Linda
surgeon known for placing the heart of a baboon in Baby Fae in
October 1984. The girl lived 20{ days after the implant.
   Paul and his parents Gordon and Alice Holc live in a Vancouver
suburb. Once home, Paul will continue to take medication. He must
return to Loma Linda once a month until he is one year old.

   An earthquake rattled parts of
the Southern California desert Friday and was felt as far south as
San Diego, but police had no immediate reports of injuries or
damage.
   The 5:26 p.m. earthquake registered 4.1 on the Richter scale and
was centered 23 miles southeast of Palm Springs, near the town of
Borrego Springs, said Steve Bryant of the California Institute of
Technology in Pasadena.
   ``It was just like a rolling feeling. It wasn't that strong,''
said Indio police dispatcher Dan Montgomery.
   A quake of magnitude 4 can cause moderate damage in the local
area, but authorities throughout the desert reported no damage or
injuries.
   The Richter scale gauges gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude.

   The military and news reports said
Friday that attacks throughout the country killed a physician, two
government officials, a former political candidate and a
12-year-old bystander.
   In Angeles, 50 miles north of Manila, two men barged into the
clinic of Dr. Patricio Santiago Thursday night and shot him in
front of his wife, military reports said.
   Also Thursday in Angeles, two gunmen killed district council
member Almario Quiambao as he walked with his wife on a street, the
reports said.
   The shootings brought to 35 the number of people killed in the
past two months in the town, home to the sprawling U.S. Clark Air
Base. Most of the killings have been attributed to leftist and
right-wing extremists.
   In Mexico town, 10 miles from Angeles, communist guerrillas
aboard a truck overtook a government patrol jeep and fired on the
troops, military reports said. The soldiers fired back and killed
one rebel, the reports said, adding that a 12-year-old boy on a
bicycle nearby died in the cross fire.
   Four militiamen and a soldier were wounded, the military reports
said.
   Thursday's other slayings were in the village of Pandanon on the
central Philippine island of Negros, the Philippine News Agency
reported.
   The agency quoted a police report as saying six men shot Alfredo
Magdato, a defeated vice mayoralty candidate in nearby Murcia town.
The gunmen then turned their fire on village council member
Reynaldo Conlu and killed him, PNA said. Conlu had been nearby and
was rushing to investigate, the agency added.
   On Friday, gunmen fired on a barrack of army musicians at a
military camp, breaking windows but causing no casualties,
officials said.
   Officers at Camp Crame, headquarters of the Philippine
Constabulary in the Manila suburb of Quezon City, said the
attackers and their car vanished.
   Renegade soldiers loyal to deposed President Ferdinand Marcos
raided the band's armory June 12 and stole 24 rifles, but failed in
their bid to free comrades jailed for taking part in coup attempts
against President Corazon Aquino.
   Col. Douglas Tansiongco of the constabulary's operations center
said in a telephone interview he did not think renegades from that
incident were involved Friday.

   Uganda on Friday announced a devaluation
of its currency, raised prices of fuel and other consumer goods and
increased taxes in a budget designed to curb inflation.
   Finance Minister Crispus Kiyonga told the governing National
Resistance Council that the exchange rate of Ugandan shillings
would be halved from 60 to a dollar to 120.
   He said prices of petroleum products would be more than doubled
and similar increases would be imposed for other items ranging from
cigarettes and soft drinks to beer and sugar.
   But in a bid to boost agriculture, the mainstay of this East
African nation's economy, the minister announced producer-price
increases of more than 100 percent for coffee, cocoa, tea and
soybeans.
   Uganda, with a population estimated in 1985 of 15.3 million, has
a foreign debt of $1.2 billion.
   President Yoweri Museveni told the council, ``If you have a
father who dies you have to pay for the debts and loans that he had
acquired.''
   Museveni, who came to power in a coup in January 1986, has
frequently said his government inherited huge foreign debts but it
would honor them.

<TEXT>
   A lawsuit against a blood bank filed by
an AIDS victim who became a spokeswoman for others with the disease
has been settled out of court 1{ years after her death, an attorney
said.
   A condition of the settlement between the family of Amy Sloan
and the Central Indiana Regional Blood Center was that the amount
would not be disclosed, said attorney Charles Vaughan Sr.
   Mrs. Sloan died in January 1987 at age 25. Her husband, Steve
Sloan, said he was satisfied with the settlement, which was
announced Thursday.
   ``There have been so many emotions, ups and downs. There were
times Amy and I wondered if justice would be served,'' he said. ``I
am pleased and hope I have the opportunity to say more later on.''
   Mrs. Sloan learned she had AIDS in 1984, the same week she
realized she was pregnant. She gave birth to a healthy son in 1985.
   The lawsuit claimed she contracted acquired immune deficiency
syndrome from a blood transfusion she received in 1982 while being
treated at Home Hospital for ulcerative colitis.
   She sued the hospital, the blood center and two doctors with the
blood center in Indianapolis.
   Mrs. Sloan had discussed her disease on national television,
before state officials and in other forums, saying her goal was
``to get some help for those people who are sick. ... This is a
terrible disease, and we all need to work together to get some kind
of cure.''
   Skip Whaley, a lawyer representing the blood center, said he
could not comment on the case. Larry R. Fisher, the hospital's
lawyer, said only that the suit against the hospital was dismissed.
   Under Indiana law, plaintiffs in a malpractice suit cannot sue
for a specific amount of damages, only for just and reasonable
damages limited to $500,000, said Vaughan. He declined to elaborate.

<TEXT>
   A three-wheeled, superlightweight car built by a
team of Japanese auto workers set a new world record for fuel
consumption Friday, consuming fuel at the rate of 6,409 miles per
gallon to win the annual Shell Mileage Marathon.
   The tiny car, driven by Masaki Oka, consumed fuel more
efficiently than 60 other vehicles to win the competition at the
Silverstone race track in Northamptonshire, southern England. It
was the first non-British entry to win the contest since it began
in 1978.
   The four auto workers who built the car, employees of the Honda
motorcycle firm in Suzuka, Japan, beat the previous record of 5,691
mpg set in Canada in 1986 by a team from the University of
Saskatchewan.
   A French team finished second in Friday's contest, and Britain's
Shell Research Team came in third.
   The defending Silverstone champion, a team from the mechanical
engineering department of King's College, London, was out of the
contest Friday with technical problems.
   The mostly three-wheeled vehicles drive six laps around a
2{-mile course at about 15 mph. Their fuel consumption is carefully
measured.
   The cars weigh from 300 to 400 pounds and have very thin tires
to reduce road friction. Children as young as 11 have been selected
as drivers to minimize weight.
   The Honda team, which has won three similar contests in Japan,
received a trophy and $1,810 for their victory.

   The burning roof of a car dealership
collapsed onto firefighters Friday, killing five of them in a
shower of fiery debris, authorities said.
   The fire, which destroyed the building and contents of
Hackensack Ford, apparently started shortly after 3 p.m. in the
ceiling space above the rear service section of the building, said
Fire Chief Anthony Aiellos.
   Aiellos said the roof collapsed as the firefighters inside the
building were cutting a hole in the false ceiling in order to
attack flames between the ceiling and the roof.
   ``All of a sudden the entire 60 foot square inside ceiling fell
on them,'' he said, adding that four other firefighters inside at
the time escaped injury.
   Aiellos said the men were spraying the space between the ceiling
and the roof trying to create a ``fog'' to decrease the heat of the
fire. ``They did what they were supposed to do,'' he said.
   Killed were Capt. Richard Williams, Capt. Richard Reinhogen,
firefighters William Krejsa, Leonard Radumski and Stephen Ennis,
officials said. They were the city's first firefighters killed in
the line of duty, Aiellos said.
   The fire apparently started in the ceiling above the
dealership's service area. All the dealership's employees were
evacuated without injuries, a Hackensack police spokesman said.
   The fire was under control by 6:30 p.m. All of Hackensack's 100
firefighters answered the alarm, as well as units from surrounding
towns.
   Fire investigtors were picking through the debris to try and
determine the cause of the fire, but Aiellos said the roof collapse
may make it impossible to find the exact cause.
   Witnesses said a series of explosions rocked the building
shortly after the fire began.

<HEAD>Timber Industry Approves Environment Plan for Amazon</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER MUELLO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Conservation groups applauded a
decision Friday by the international timber industry to promote
environment-conscious logging in the Amazon jungle, the world's
largest tropical rainforest.
   The U.S.-based World Wildlife Fund said the decision _ the first
of its kind by the timber industry _ could slow destruction of the
Amazon rainforest, a key regulator of the world's weather.
   The International Tropical Timber Organization, an association
of 42 producing and consuming countries, approved a $4 million
logging and conservation project in the remote jungle state of
Acre, on Brazil's border with Bolivia, 2,800 miles northwest of Rio
de Janeiro.
   The project calls for ``integrated'' development of jungle
products, such as Brazil nuts and rubber, as well as timber. It
also calls for loggers to consult with environmental groups,
government agencies, native Indians and local workers to plan
long-term development to preserve the rainforest.
   ``This was the big one. We hope the Acre project can serve as a
model not just for the rest of the Amazon but for all tropical
forests,'' Adam Markham, press spokesman for the World Wildlife
Fund, told the AP at the end of a 10-day meeting of the Timber
Organization.
   The organization's members control 95 percent of the world's
$5.6 billion tropical timber trade.
   As timber trade shifts away from the shrinking forests of Africa
and southeast Asia, the mahogany-rich Amazon is seen as the next
great source of hardwood.
   But conservationists are worried about the effect on the climate
of uncontrolled logging in the Amazon basin, a 2 million
square-mile region as large as Europe that covers parts of seven
South American countries and contains a third of the world's
rainforest.
   Already the Amazon forest is disappearing at the rate of some 27
million acres a year, mostly at the hands of small farmers and
ranchers who cut and burn the trees, Markham said.
   ``The rainforest is a gaseous sink for carbon dioxide. The trees
soak it up. If we cut them down, there's no way to get rid of the
gas. And that contributes to the greenhouse effect,'' he said.
   The greenhouse effect is a gradual warming of the Earth's
surface because of excessive carbon dioxide and pollutants in the
atmosphere that trap the sun's heat, like a greenhouse. It is
thought to be a possible cause of the current drought in the U.S.
Midwest.
   The Acre project, which will get about $3 million from the
Brazilan government and the rest from the Timber Organization, is
the largest approved since the organization was founded in 1986.
   Smaller conservation programs, similar to the Acre project, were
approved for Bolivia and Ecuador.
   Other proposals approved at the Rio meeting were:
   _Development of a ``news market service,'' to help producing
countries market better.
   _Standardization of timber specifications among member
countries, to cut waste caused by conflicting measurements.
   _Improvement of harvesting and processing equipment.
   The next meeting of the organization is scheduled for November
in Yokohama, Japan.

   A 3,500-pound female hippopotamus, apparently
fearing for the safety of her 2-week-old baby, attacked and
seriously injured a keeper at the St. Louis Zoo on Friday,
officials said.
   Rick Coonrod, 47, was one of two keepers escorting the zoo's
hippopotamuses from an outdoor yard into indoor stalls through a
series of chutes when the female hippopotamus suddenly spun, said
zoo director Charles Hoessle.
   The mother, being separated from her baby, struck a gate and
knocked Coonrod into a moat, then attacked him before returning to
her baby, Hoessle said. The baby was born to the hippopotamus June
17.
   ``She apparently bit him and stomped on his leg,'' Hoessle said.
``The report we have is that he does have a broken leg _ apparently
not a life-threatening injury, but he does have a broken leg.''
   A spokeswoman at Barnes Hospital, where Coonrod was taken, said
the keeper was in serious condition with a broken leg and
lacerations of his head and right arm.
   ``You can never predict what an animal will do, particularly
when she's protecting a baby,'' Hoessle said. ``We have a very good
safety record. It's just an unfortunate thing to happen.''

   Youngsters and workers at a
children's shelter bade farewell Friday to the partially deaf boy
who was reunited with his mother this week after an eight-month
separation.
   Jose de Jesus Garcia Aguilera _ known to the world as Sabath
before Tuesday's reunion with his mother _ passed out pieces of
angel food cake to children, social workers and reporters gathered
at the going-away party at the shelter where he had been staying
since last November.
   A handwritten sign on a wall read: ``Adios Jesus (Sabath).''
   The boy, nicknamed Chuy, had started packing early for the bus
ride Friday night with his mother and aunt to his hometown of
Tampico, on the Gulf Coast about 300 miles south of Brownsville,
Texas.
   Chuy caused a stir after he was picked up Nov. 7 near downtown
Juarez because he could not convey his identity or his hometown. He
speaks only a few words and communicates mostly through gestures
and drawings.
   Because he seemed to like American food, Mexican child welfare
authorities contacted their U.S. counterparts, thinking the child
might be an American. The FBI even got involved in the effort to
identify him.
   But his family was eventually traced, and he was reunited
Tuesday with his mother, Micaela Aguilera de Garcia of Tampico. She
said the boy, one of five children, had run away while on a trip to
visit his father in Monterrey.
   Before he left Friday, Chuy ran around the playroom at the
children's shelter, eagerly handing pieces of cake to social
workers, reporters and about 20 playmates. Then he walked shyly to
his mother and thrust out a piece of cake at arm's length.
   Social worker Leticia Cota stood in a doorway, watching Chuy hug
his friends and pose for pictures. ``I'm glad to see him back with
his family, but it's sad to see him go,'' she said.
   Juan Ramon Hernandez, director general of the Juarez office of
Integrated Family Development, said welfare authorities were
considering putting Chuy into a shelter in Tampico because of the
conditions the family lived in.
   Ms. Aguilera had previously told people that she worked as a
maid. But when officials in Tampico visited the family's home this
week and interviewed neighbors, they discovered the family's living
quarters were cramped and that Ms. Aguilera worked late hours as a
waitress in a bar, Hernandez said.
   ``It's better this way,'' Hernandez said, adding that Ms.
Aguilar would be allowed to see her children if they are put in a
shelter. ``We're here to protect children, not to protect the
parents.''

   An 18-year study that revealed the atomic
structure of Earth's most abundant protein could lead to higher
crop yields, better drugs to combat cancer and heart disease, and
even to more effective laundry detergents, scientists say.
   The study by biochemist David Eisenberg of the University of
California, Los Angeles, ``is very significant work,'' said Dr.
John Norvell, health science administrator at the National
Institute of General Medical Sciences in Bethesda, Md.
   ``It will add a lot to the understanding of how these complex
proteins work,'' and therefore may help researchers trying to
design proteins to combat several diseases, including diabetes and
cancer, Norvell said.
   Eisenberg and his students published their study today in the
journal Science. They spent 18 years bombarding crystals of the
protein, named RuBisCO, with X-rays before they successfully
produced computer images showing the three-dimensional arrangement
of the 37,792 atoms in the protein, which ultimately sustains life
by making every plant grow.

   Researchers have nearly halted the progression
of multiple sclerosis in some patients for up to four years by
aiming radiation at specific sites in the body, a new study says.
   The four-year response is longer than any seen with other
experimental therapies, scientists said.
   The radiation was aimed at depleting the body's supply of white
blood cells that are believed to cause symptoms of the disease by
attacking nerve tissue.
   An estimated 250,000 Americans have multiple sclerosis, an often
crippling condition that can include weakness, difficulty in
coordination, dizziness, and loss of balance.
   Patients in the study had chronic progressive MS, an unremitting
form that steadily worsens. The disease also has an
``exacerbating-remitting'' form, in which a patient suffers
isolated attacks.

   Thanks to Astrid's Law, dogs' tails in
Sweden are safe from cosmetic trimming and barnyard animals are
guaranteed a better life, at least until they get to the
slaughterhouse.
   The law, which took effect July 1, was the result of a campaign
by children's author Astrid Lindgren, creator of Pippi Longstocking
and a host of other characters who have enchanted children in
dozens of countries.
   It was a remarkable achievement, even for a woman who once
helped bring down a government. It reflected the reverence with
which Swedes regard a storyteller who has spellbound three

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev on Friday night closed a
national Communist Party conference on his program of
``perestroika,'' saying resolutions endorsed by the delegates lead
the way to a ``democratic image of socialism.''
   The four-day conference, the first held by the party since 1941,
was unprecedented in the openness of criticism of past and present
leaders.
   Gorbachev pointed out one key to the four-day conference _ the
attempt to overcome the party's Stalinist legacy _ when he called
for construction of a monument to the victims Josef Stalin.

suspended payment on $1 billion worth of contracts alleged to be
tainted as a result of the military procurement investigation.
   Carlucci acted on the basis of information included in
search-warrant affidavits that were unsealed by a federal
magistrate in Dallas on Thursday. In the documents, the FBI said it
eavesdropped as a Navy procurement official passed along inside
information on nine contracts worth more than $522 million.
   Carlucci also announced that the Pentagon was beginning
suspension procedures against three individuals and a company named

   ``Every administration since the Medicare program was passed has
worried about the seemingly uncontrollable cost increases in our
government health care programs,'' Reagan said at a ceremony in the

   ``Whoever the president in office, program costs have exceeded

   The man who may become the nation's foreign

   A Palestinian woman died of gunshot wounds to the head suffered
in an army raid on her village May 18, said officials at Mukassad
Hospital in Jerusalem.
   Only a harsh crackdown can restore Israel's ability to deter
revolt among the 1.5 million Palestinians of the West Bank and Gaza
Strip, said Benyamin Netanyahu, a former ambassador to the United

<HEAD>Indian Epic Sells Out In Japan</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Silence has greeted Peter Brook's lavish nine-hour
odyssey based on the rambling Indian epic ``The Mahabharata,'' but
for the cast, the silence is golden.
   Playing to nearly packed houses in Tokyo, the last stop of a
year-long worldwide tour, Brook's adaptation of good's triumph over
evil pits two warring clans in ferocious battle to gain control of
a vast ancient Indian kingdom.
   The epic, which comprises the world's longest poem, narrates a
way of life in its dealings with feelings of hatred, love and
jealousy _ basic human emotions often hidden under a polite facade.
Audiences in New York, Copenhagen, Paris and Glasgow have responded
with awkward, embarrassed laughter.
   ``That has been true with many audiences all over the world,''
said Malika Sarabhai, the only Indian national in the performance.
``We used to get very upset in the beginning.
   ``In America, they laughed at everything,'' said Sarabhai, an
accomplished dancer-actress in India. ``Anytime when there was
something tense going on stage, they would laugh ... because they
are embarrassed. They don't like ... to be confronted with very
deep, very basic emotions.''
   In Tokyo, the silence has been louder; the Japanese audience has
laughed the least. Many Japanese, Brook said, have discovered that
``India is really the root of their culture.''
   Kenichiro Shirahama, a theater critic and author of several
books on plays, said ``The Mahabharata'' has allowed the Japanese
``to re-evaluate the meaning of life.''
   ``Japan has drawn its culture from the centuries-old traditions
of Korea, China and especially India,'' he said, ``but in their
pursuit of money, the Japanese have forgotten how to live.
   ``By watching the play, the people are reminded of the richness
of life and human nature.''
   In Tokyo for an eight-week engagement as part of the six-month
Festival of India, ``The Mahabharata'' has earned rave reviews from
the local media, and Saison Theater personnel say tickets for the
nine-hour marathon sessions were sold out well in advance before
the opening last month.
   Originally written in the ancient Indian language of Sanskrit,
the epic under Brook's direction is staged in English and lines up
a multinational cast of 50 people from over 15 different countries.
   The cast of the Centre International de Creations Theatreales
company, based in France, has already toured in Europe, the United
States and Australia.
   Ironically, India has not been part of its itinerary.
   Marie-Helene Estienne, Brook's assistant, blamed the logistics
of transporting a company of 50 plus into a nation notorious for
its red tape, but said a movie on the play, next on the director's
agenda, will open in New Delhi by September 1989.
   Doordarshan, India's government-run TV network, will sponsor the
play's move to celluloid and will also cast the same group of
actors, with one notable difference: The play will be cut to six
hours, ``the shortest length of time in which the story can be
told,'' Brook said. Doordarshan, he added, initially wanted only
two hours.
   The epic is played out an a stage packed with dry earth,
complete with a pond in the front and a rippling stream in the
back. Outdoor and indoor scenes within acts are signaled by
changing floor mats, brought out by the actors themselves doubling
as stagehands.
   The story is about two groups of cousins, the Kauravas and the
Pandavas, who fight over control of an ancient Indian kingdom. The
climax of the story is an 18-day battle, in which the Pandavas,
representing good, are victorious.
   Around this core are woven thousands of subplots, which nearly
fill an entire encyclopedia of 18 books.
   ``The play is very true to `The Mahabharata,' very true to the
spirit,'' Sarabhai said. ``Had I not been proud of the production
both as an Indian and as a woman, I don't think I would have stayed
party to it.''

<HEAD>Efforts Under Way to Save Brazil's Coastal Forest</HEAD>

   Environmentalists are mobilizing
to save what's left of Brazil's once-vast Atlantic forest, the
nation's picture-postcard front door.
   One of the species of trees near extinction is the brazilwood,
or pau-Brazil, which gave the country its name.
   When Portuguese explorers discovered Brazil in 1500, the
Atlantic forest covered some 170,000 square miles along a
3,000-mile coastal strip.
   Today, with 80 million of the country's 143 million people and
most of its heavy industry crowded into the coastal zone, only
about 3 percent of the original primary forest remains _ in
scattered patches.
   Some of the forest's rare monkeys, birds and trees, many found
nowhere else in the world, face extinction.
   ``We are in the process of destroying an entire ecosystem. But
there's still time to save what's left and prevent total tragedy,''
said Rodrigo Lara Mesquita, the chairman of a group called the
S.O.S. Atlantic Forest Foundation.
   The foundation has strong economic and political influence.
   Mesquita is an heir of the family that for a century has
controlled the influential O Estado de S. Paulo newspaper and media
group. Others running S.O.S. include two multimillionaire
industrialists, the president of the country's largest university
and a retired admiral.
   Since 1986, the foundation has raised the equivalent of more
than $4 million for nationwide newspaper and television publicity.
It intends to collect more, for the satellite mapping of the forest
zone and for actual conservation programs where the remaining
forest is thickest.
   ``This group is powerful and well organized,'' said Russell A.
Mittermeier, international vice chairman of the Washington-based
World Wildlife Fund and a consultant to the Atlantic Forest
organization. ``It's not radical, as unfortunately was the case
with many well meaning but ineffective environmental groups that
sprang up in the United States in the 1960s. I'm very optimistic.''
   Mittermeier has been coming to Brazil since 1971, principally to
work with Atlantic forest's endangered monkey species.
   He said in an interview in Rio de Janeiro that Brazil probably
has the best chance for success of the ``three highest-priority
ecological problems in the world'' _ the tropical South American
Andes in Colombia, Ecuador and Peru; the African island of
Madagascar, and the Atlantic forest.
   ``Here in the Atlantic forest it really is possible to save the
remnants,'' Mittermeier said. He mentioned specifically the
muriqui, South America's largest primate, of which fewer than 100
remain; the Golden Lion Tamarin, another endangered monkey, with
about 400 left; the increasingly scarce red-tailed parrot; the rare
and valuable jacaranda tree, and the almost extinct pau-Brazil.
   ``Today, with few exceptions, the only place you can still see
pau-Brasil is in a botanical garden,'' lamented Mesquita.
   Early Portuguese pioneers chopped down all the brazilwood they
could find to extract dye. Later settlers hacked away the coastal
forest to make way for sugar-cane and coffee plantations and for
settlements.
   The S.O.S. Atlantic Forest Foundation's logotype is a stylized
green-yellow-and-blue Brazilian flag, but with part of the green
ripped away.
   A foundation poster shows a map of Brazil with an outline of the
Atlantic Forest as it existed in 1500, with the words, in
Portuguese, ``I Used to be Like This.'' Then there is a map showing
the scattered forest pockets left today and the words, ``I Wound Up
Like This.''
   The foundation's first specific project is to be in a
still-relatively untouched forest zone covering 3,500 square miles
along the coasts of the southeastern states of Sao Paulo and
Parana. It intends to set up two ecological bases and buy a
patrol-type boat to sound the alarm against illegal tree cutting
and the banned netting of coastal fish, shrimp and oysters.
   ``Invasion of that region has long gone unpunished,'' S.O.S.
Chairman Mesquita said. ``But we think we can stop it. We're
organized, we've got money, and we have access to the authorities
and the media.''
   The foundation also supported lobby efforts in Brazil's Congress
to place in the draft of a new constitution the legal concept of
``ecological crime.''
   ``We're also attempting a process of environmental education,''
said Ibsen de Gusmao Camara, the former admiral who now is a member
of the S.O.S board. ``A lot of Brazilians think development
automatically means physical occupation. It's not that they
purposely want to destroy the environment. They just don't know any
better.''
   ``We'll never see the Atlantic forest again as it once was,'' he
added. ``That's impossible. But we will put a stop to the
destruction and preserve and build up the forest's `genetic
library'.''

<TEXT>
   Two public television documentaries this week
give names and faces and unique stories to a part of the population
that is often faceless, especially on TV _ the elderly.
   One of the films is an uplifting fairytale romance, the Academy
Award-winning short documentary ``Young at Heart,'' airing
Wednesday.
   The other is a realistic profile of six elderly women. ``Acting
Our Age'' is half of the two-hour premiere installment Tuesday
night of ``P.O.V.,'' standing for ``point of view,'' a new
documentary series on PBS.
   The film is by Michal Aviad, an Israeli filmmaker who decided to
examine the effects of aging, both physically and psychologically,
on a half-dozen thoughtful and intelligent women coping with
different lifestyles _ married, divorced and widowed, some lonely,
some not.
   ``There's nobody that's young that's not going to get old,
unless they die,'' says Enola Maxwell, 66, one of the women Ms.
Aviad profiles.
   Ms. Aviad allows her subjects to speak for themselves; as a
result they are portrayed sympathetically but realistically.
   Mrs. Maxwell is surrounded by an extended family, but Irja
Friend, 74, is struggling with loneliness. ``The older I get, the
fewer chances I have, and the ones that I had I rejected. It's
painful not to be wanted, and I found that you just simply have to
do without. No one wants you for a spouse or a mate or a lover.''
   Not the case for the adoring couple profiled in ``Young at
Heart,'' Wednesday on PBS, which won this year's Academy Award as
best short-subject documentary.
   It is a bald-faced love story with a happy ending. Louis
Gothelf, 85, and Reva Shwayder, 84, two artists _ he paints
portraits, she paints flowers she grows in her garden _ found that
being old doesn't mean an end to romance.
   The film was made by Sue Marx, Gothelf's daughter, and Pamela
Conn.
   Gothelf and Mrs. Shwayder met when they went on a painting tour
of England and were seated next to each other on the plane. They
talked all the way. Once they arrived, it sounded like something of
a twist on ``A Room with a View.''
   Louis had a large room with lovely scenery out the window. Mrs.
Shwayder was stuck with closet-like accommodations. She showed up
at his door with her luggage, and the rest was history.
   They decided to live together, because as Mrs. Shwayder says,
``When you're young you should get married. But when you're old,
what difference does it make?''
   The film is captivating in its simplicity. Gothelf and Mrs.
Shwayder are two wise, funny people whose bodies might be old, but
whose minds are young and open.
   Mrs. Shwayder has an especially good line that will likely end
up tacked on a lot of walls _ ``Housework is the worst enemy of an
artist.''
   The camera follows the couple to an art gallery where they both
coo over a John Singer Sargent portrait, but later argue the
relative merits of various examples of modern art.
   Mrs. Shwayder points out that Gothelf learned to paint in the
'20 and '30s, but she didn't begin until the 1950s, so she has a
more modern view.
   Later in the film, we learn that Gothelf's wife had Alzheimer's
disease, a progressive disorder that affects the mind. He cared for
her through 10 years of sickness before she died.
   Mrs. Shwayder had lost her entire family. Her son died of cancer
in his 40s. Then her husband passed away. Her other son later
drowned while scuba diving.
   Gothelf shows a portrait he painted of Mrs. Shwayder a few weeks
after the tragedy. He couldn't get her to smile.
   In one of the film's loveliest scenes, he paints a new portrait,
this time with Mrs. Shwayder where she's happiest, at her easel.
   Sitting together in the evening, cocktails in hand, Mrs.
Shwayder sums up the sentiment that leads the two to a marriage,
documented in the film: ``We're both getting older,'' she says. ``I
hope if anything happens to him, I'll be able to take care of him,
and if anything happens to me, he'll take care of me. That's what I
call love.''
   This is what viewers will call a very nice program.

   The television documentary, much neglected in
recent years, gets a special 10-week showcase on public television
beginning tonight.
   The summer series ``P.O.V.'' _ filmmaker jargon for point of
view _ will present a selection from among the best documentaries
produced in recent years by independent filmmakers.
   ``Each film has a point of view,'' said executive producer Marc
N. Weiss. ``That makes them more interesting. People can look at
them and agree or disagree.''
   The first two-hour program presents two documentaries:
``American Tongues,'' by Louis Alvarez and Andrew Kolker, takes a
humorous look at how American speech varies from region to region.
The film won a Peabody Award this spring. The second film is
``Acting Our Age,'' by Michal Aviad, a paean to the spirit of six
elderly women facing life and advancing age.
   The premiere also includes previews of the other documentaries.
   ``We're going to show 12 documentaries during the 10 weeks,''
said Weiss. ``We looked at an extraordinary number of documentaries
to make our selection. When we asked for submissions we got 500
entries.
   ``That's just the tip of the iceberg. There are more than 25,000
independent filmmakers in this country. They're not all turning out
films all the time. It takes several years. They have difficulty
raising money. The very best documentaries get made because the
filmmaker got a bug. They latched onto something. They feel very
passionate about the subject they're filming. It's something they
want to explore.''
   Public television commissions only about a dozen documentaries a
year outside of the venues of the National Geographic Society,
Jacques Cousteau and other nature films. Documentaries once
flourished on the three commercial networks but have been virtually
replaced by newsmagazine shows.
   The only real sanctuary for the documentary today is cable TV's
Discovery Channel, which offers 18 hours a day of documentaries
concerning nature, science, technology, history, human adventure
and world exploration.
   Documentaries are also occasionally shown in theaters. The
Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences awards Oscars each year
for best feature and short-subject documentaries.
   ``This whole thing had its genesis at a film festival in Utah
about a year and a half ago,'' said Weiss. ``David Fanning of
`Frontline' mentioned during a discussion that Britain's fourth
channel had bought a lot of documentaries by independent American
filmmakers. An executive of the British channel said they have such
a backlog of films that they're running them as a special package.
   ``After the discussion, I went to Fanning with the idea that we
should do something similar here. He said the only way it would
work is if we had a consortium of stations behind it.''
   Fanning arranged a meeting of Weiss, Henry Becton, president of
WGBH in Boston, and Barry Chase, vice president for public affairs
of PBS. It ended up with ``P.O.V.'' having the same board of
directors and stations as ``American Playhouse.''
   Weiss pointed out that the primary audience for most
documentaries has been at schools and libraries.
   ``Very few filmmakers make any money,'' he said. ``They do it
because they care about a subject. Many fall by the wayside because
they haven't got the money. On the other hand, that kind of
tenacity is what makes these films extraordinary. All of the work
has an emotional punch and plenty of intellectual meat.
   ``Filmmakers only get a few shots. That's why they pick their
subjects so carefully. And they're independent because they don't
want to comform to a format.''
   Weiss, who has been an independent filmmaker much of his career,
said he hopes ``P.O.V.'' will lead to a series. ``People need to
know when to tune in,'' he said. ``It needs some consistency. We're
issuing a viewer's guide to help people find this current series.''
   He said he believes ``P.O.V.'' will attract viewers who quit
regular television because they have found nothing to interest them.
   ``People are pretty bored with the documentaries they see on the
networks,'' Weiss said.

<HEAD>Italian Communist Party Suffering `Most Difficult Moment'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY BETH SHERIDAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Italy's Communist Party is desperately searching for
a recipe for success following its third electoral drubbing in a
year, when just a little over a decade ago it came close to winning
power.
   Their most recent setback came at the end of June when they lost
ground in local elections in northern Italy.
   ``This is one of the most difficult moments in our history,''
said Achille Occhetto, the new leader of the party, which is the
largest Communist Party in the West and Italy's second largest
political party.
   The Communists' dramatic decline reportedly helped force out the
70-year-old Alessandro Natta as the party leader. His resignation,
following a heart attack, marked the first time in the party's
history that a Communist leader had stepped down in Italy.
   Occhetto, 52, inherited a party divided over its identity and
unsure how to appeal to an electorate, which is less blue-collar
and more conservative than in the past.
   ``We've said we don't want to follow the Russians, the (Italian)
Socialists or the Americans,'' said a Communist senator, Stojan
Spetic. ``We're still searching for an answer.''
   The prolonged search has hurt the Communists' morale _ and their
popularity.
   A year ago, the Italian Communist Party _ known as the PCI, its
initials in Italian _ suffered its worst defeat in parliamentary
elections in 20 years, slipping to 26.6 percent of the vote.
   In May, the Communists dropped to 21.9 percent of the vote in
local elections, down from 25.8 percent in 1983. The balloting in
late June in the north reduced their share of the vote in two
regions from 19.8 percent to 15.7 percent.
   Meanwhile, the Socialist Party of former Premier Bettino Craxi
has surged, challenging the Communists for leadership of the left.
   Many Communists are pinning their hopes for revival on Occhetto.
   Occhetto is ``perfectly conscious of the necessity and the
urgency of creating a new PCI,'' said La Repubblica, the
left-leaning Rome newspaper.
   One of the party's pillars, the blue-collar working class, has
declined in number during Italy's economic and technological boom.
   Young people who traditionally voted heavily for the Communists
are now spreading their votes among different parties.
   ``Today's young people don't have idealistic values,'' Sen.
Spetic said in an interview. ``They are much more pragmatic. They
want work, careers.''
   In a speech to party members, Occhetto noted the shrinkage in
the party's traditional bases of support and said this ``puts in
question even us, and it is from this consideration that we ought
to draw our new course.''
   It would not be the first time the Italian Communists changed
course.
   In the 1970s, Communist leader Enrico Berlinguer proclaimed the
party's independence from the Soviet Union. Gone were the days when
the party was known as ``the other church'' with its ``pope'' in
Moscow; Italian Communists sought to achieve power through the
democratic system.
   The party, which had been kept out of the government since 1947,
won 34 percent of the votes in the 1976 elections _ just four
points below the dominant Christian Democrats.
   But Berlinguer was unable to persuade the Christian Democrats to
give him Cabinet seats, and he had to settle for being consulted on
major issues.
   Since then, the Socialists have enhanced their reputation as an
alternative through Craxi's position as head of the governing
coalition for three years, up to mid-1987.
   Since the death of the charismatic Berlinguer in 1984, the
Communist Party has wrestled over what kind of alternative it
should be.
   Party officials talked of re-examining its revolutionary roots,
or seeking a social democratic line _ perhaps even changing its
name.
   A poll by L'Espresso magazine of 234 Communist supporters who
had voted recently for a different party indicated that the largest
group _ 30 percent _ complained of the lack of a clear Communist
political line.
   An invigorated brand of communism in the Soviet Union has not
given new luster to Italy's party.
   Mikhail S. Gorbachev's criticism of Stalin and rejection of some
Marxist principles have been seen as indictments of the history of
the Italian party, which supported Stalin in its early days.
   ``It is the lethal combination of the Craxi (Socialist) effect
and the Gorbachev effect which has thrown the PCI against the
ropes,'' Enzo Bettiza, a former European Parliament deputy from the
Liberal Party, wrote in the newspaper La Stampa of Turin.

   Palestinian singers usually known for
sentimental love songs have found a new kind of music: political
anthems calling for violent revolt against Israel and glorifying
young Arab stone-throwers.
   Israeli authorities have blacklisted the songs on grounds they
incite rebellion, but they are distributed secretly in recorded
form and are heard widely in Arab east Jerusalem and the
Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   The current No. 1 hit, ``Insurrection,'' urges Palestinian
children to ``rise up with your stones.'' It booms from music
stores and portable radios in east Jerusalem when Israeli police or
soldiers are not around.
   In Bethlehem, junior high school students came from classes
recently chanting the refrain of the song ``Intefadeh'' (Arabic for
uprising): ``With firebombs and stones, I make my revolution.''
   Arab youths also gather around stereos at home and sing along to
ballads such as ``Palestinian,'' whose lyrics say: ``I fight for my
identity, I fight for freedom, I fight for spring.''
   In Jerusalem, police have raided several music stores,
confiscated tapes of songs about the uprising and charged store
owners with incitement.
   In the occupied territories, troops confiscate tapes of banned
song if they find any during house searches, but they don't look
specially for them, said a military official.
   ``We act whenever we can, but this is not our first priority. We
are too busy with other things.''
   Since the Dec. 8 start of the uprising, dozens of militant,
anti-Israeli songs have surfaced in the occupied lands. They range
from mournful ballads about the more than 200 Palestinians killed
in clashes to stirring anthems glorifying teen-age stonethrowers.
   Intefadeh songs are recorded in makeshift studios in Jerusalem,
taped from Syrian television or smuggled from Arab countries. Some
tapes are sold under the counter in music stores, while others are
copied at home and passed along to friends.
   Among the two most popular song collections are ``I Am The Son
of Gaza'' by the Syrian band ``Palestine Roots'' and ``Intefadeh''
by Riad Awad, a singer from the West Bank city of Tulkarem.
``Palestine Roots'' also sings ``Insurrection,'' while Awad has
recorded ``Palestinian.''
   Awad and others are part of the so-called ``Western wave,'' a
new musical style popular among the young. It builds on Arabic
music traditions, but also uses synthesizers and electrical
guitars, placing greater emphasis on rhythm.
   Palestinian music store owners say that before the uprising,
sentimental love songs were the top sellers.
   ``Today, 95 percent of my customers ask for intefadeh or
nationalistic songs,'' said an east Jerusalem music store owner.
   His store was raided earlier in June after he played
``Insurrection'' over loudspeakers. Police confiscated dozens of
intefadeh tapes and charged the owner with incitement. He was
released on bail the equivalent to $1,300.
   Since the raid, he has restocked his supply, keeping the tapes
in two small boxes under the counter. But he no longer plays
intefadeh songs loudly, and scrutinizes customers to make sure they
are not undercover police officers.
   Distribution of intefadeh songs is often unorthodox. A friend of
the Jerusalem-born Palestinian singer Mustafa Kurd recently made
the rounds of the music stores, carrying a single copy of Kurd's
latest tape ``The Children of Palestine.''
   Shopowners who wanted it made copies in their stores.
   At a music store in Jerusalem's walled Old City,
``Insurrection'' was booming from loudspeakers one recent day,
mingling with the sales pitches of street vendors in the
cobblestone street. Riot police patrolled nearby, but took no
notice.
   ``I play this because I believe in it,'' said the store owner.
``When the cops come, I just change the tape.'' He added that he
was free on bail after being charged with incitement following a
raid.
   Military officials said all songs and written material calling
for violent revolt against the 21-year Israeli occupation are
illegal and subject to confiscation.
   However, the officials added, military officers have not
compiled a list of banned material because they can't keep up with
the number of intefadeh songs flooding the occupied territories.
   But the songs also have their critics in the Palestinian
community.
   Hussein Barghouti, a literature teacher at the West Bank's Bir
Zeit University, said most have little to do with art.
   ``Art is buried in these songs. What remains is sloganism,''
said Barghouti who writes songs for a Jerusalem band. ``As a human
being, you are touched only on a superficial ideological level.''
   He added that the quality of the songs might improve if they
were written by the young activists confronting Israeli soldiers
with their stones and slingshots.
   ``But the kids are too busy to write songs,'' he said.

<DATELINE>FENGYANG, China (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wu Fengqi remembers living on a people's
farm commune and being so poor he had neither a table to eat from
nor a bed to sleep on. Today he has his own family farm, and he's
rich by Chinese standards.
   Thus it is that the 50-year-old Wu scoffs at the idea being
tossed around in Beijing, China's capital, that tiny family farms
in some areas should gradually give way to more efficient
large-scale cooperative ventures.
   ``The peasants won't support group farming,'' he said. ``They
would resist.''
   Nine years ago, Wu's production brigade secretly defied the
commune and government policy by dividing up its land and letting
each farmer be responsible for growing his own share.
   Production took off, and Fengyang County, in central China's
agricultural heartland of Anhui province, became a national pioneer
in the family contract system that has revolutionized the Chinese
countryside. Again leading the nation, by 1982 all 45 communes in
Fengyang, each with about 10,000 people, had been broken up.
   Today, as the first decade of China's agricultural reform
closes, the system is praised for lifting tens of millions out of
poverty. But serious doubts have arisen about the future ability of
family farmers to feed this country of 1 billion people.
   For example, farmers paid artificially low prices for
state-bought grain are planting more lucrative vegetables and
fruit, leading to three straight discouraging grain harvests after
a record 407-million-ton crop in 1984.
   Land under cultivation has decreased and irrigation systems,
once kept up by communal labor, have fallen into disrepair.
   Some experts maintain that the family farmer, on his average 1.5
acres of land, has outlived his usefulness.
   Rural residents, millions of whom now are finding jobs in small
factories in the countryside, are being encouraged to cede their
land to professionals or groups who can carry out mechanized
farming on larger tracts. Some areas are experimenting with
allowing farmers to lease land to more ambitious tillers of the
soil.
   In Fengyang, however, ``the conditions are not ripe for
large-scale group farming,'' said a local official, Deng Zeyuan.
Few factory jobs are available in an area where 500,000 of 580,000
people are farmers, he said, and group farming still brings up
memories of the ``leftist mistakes'' and ``extreme poverty'' of the
past.
   Under the newly devised cooperative system, farmers who
voluntarily form a cooperative may do so and the state is now
encouraging this in some areas.
   Rural residents who find jobs in factories can turn over their
land to other farmers, but since the land all belongs to the state,
normally they would not be paid for use of it.
   A few areas, however, are experimenting in allowing farmers to
lease land and receive benefits from future crops. Although the
state owns the land, it has assured farmers that it will not evict
them against their will to form larger farm groups.
   Farmer Wu doesn't like the concept and wants to continue as he
is because he and others in Fengyand have come so far along.
   He said he earned 30 fen (8 cents) a day working on the commune,
and ``even though we worked a whole year we only had food for half
a year.''
   Begging, common in Anhui for centuries, continued after the
Communist takeover in 1949, and during the hard times, people
starved, he said.
   In 1979, in the first year of the family contract system in his
village, Wu claimed, he and his eight children produced more than
the entire 98-member work brigade turned out in the past. Last year
his extended family earned 17,000 yuan ($4,600) from grain and
other crops, before expenses.
   Wu said 17 of the 19 households in the village now have brick
homes, and their former mud homes are used as cowsheds. About half
have television sets, and many have tape recorders and electric
fans.
   Down a rocky dirt road, Gao Mingzhen, 32, recalled how her
relatives received 110 yuan ($30) a month raising geese on the
commune. Last year, she said, her goose and chicken farm took in
150,000 yuan ($40,500), of which she reinvested 87,000 yuan
($23,500) in four incubators.
   She also bought two trucks, is installing a refrigerator house
and a hatchery, and last year financed her own trip to Japan.
   He Xizhang, a county magistrate, spoke proudly of the
achievements made under the family contract system.
   ``Our history in Fengyang is one of going from begging to coping
to contributing to the country,'' he said.
   He added that the area, once dependent on the state for grain
and other handouts, now exports food to other parts of the country.
Grain production has grown steadily, from 163,000 tons in 1978 to
540,000 tons in 1987.
   The annual per capital income in that period climbed from 81
yuan ($22) to 480 yuan ($130), on a par with farmers nationwide.
Farmers must sell a contracted amount of their grain crop, usually
about 40 percent, to the state at fixed prices, but can sell the
rest on the free market at prices about 20 percent higher.
   Electricity, available to almost no farmers in 1978, now reaches
almost every home; half the farmers have brick houses.
   Not all in Fengyang are properly clothed, Magistrate He said,
and some live in three-story homes while others still are in mud
huts. But ``people feel deeply that the reforms have brought them
prosperity.''
   Nonetheless, primitive methods are still used on family farms.
   Women in conical straw hats plant rice stalk by stalk; men plow
fields behind plodding water buffalo.
   Irrigation, crucial in this area plagued by alternating drought
and flood, is done either by operating small wooden pumps or
tossing water from one paddy to another by bucket.
   Some farmers, lacking threshing facilitities, lay their wheat
across the highways to let passing trucks help separate the grain
from the chaff.
   Like elsewhere in China, family farmers in Fengyang worry about
rising prices and must struggle to obtain fertilizer, pesticides
and diesel fuel, which are in short supply and often fall into the
hands of speculators or those with political influence.
   Agricultural official Liu said the province can supply only 70
percent of fertilizer needs. Some of that is obtainable only on
free markets, where prices can far exceed state-set levels.
   County official Deng said someday Fengyang will follow the
example of prospering coastal areas, where farms are being turned
over to talented farmers while surplus farm population is shifted
to jobs in construction and light industry.
   Fengyang also needs to have more mechanized farming, Deng said,
while stressing that the family farm should be retained.
   ``We're still exploring,'' he said.

   The Commerce Department said Thursday the new debt total was $99

   Egypt's decision to cut the price on its crude
oil exports for the first half of July has raised prospects of a
possible price war, depressing oil futures prices to their lowest
levels of the year.
   The contract for August delivery of West Texas Intermediate, the
benchmark U.S. crude oil, dropped 27 cents Thursday to $15.16 per
barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   It was the lowest level for WTI since Dec. 21, 1987, when the
near-term contract also finished at $15.16.
   Among refined products traded on the exchange, the July contract
for home heating oil slipped 0.64 cent to 40.88 cents a gallon.
   The July contract for unleaded gasoline settled at 51.94 cents,
down 0.68 cent from the previous strong session, when prices soared
on speculation that demand would grow as the July 4th holiday
neared. Traders attributed Thursday's decline largely to
profit-taking.
   John O'Connell, a senior analyst for Refco Inc., said Egypt's
announcement made traders even more bearish about the outlook for
oil prices than they had been in recent weeks.
   Traders have been worried about overproduction by oil nations,
who have created a glut that has been depressing prices.
   Egypt's senior oil ministry official, Hammad Ayoub, said his
country would reduce its oil export prices by up to $1.85 a barrel
for the first half of July.
   Ayoub declined to comment further. But in a later interview with
the Middle East News Agency, he blamed the deterioration in world
oil prices on some OPEC countries that are exceeding the production
quotas agreed to by all but one of the cartel's 13 members.
   O'Connell said the action by Egypt, which is not a member of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, could prompt some
OPEC countries to increase their production to remain competitive.
   ``The (oil futures) market is nervous about what Kuwait and
Saudi Arabia might do'' if other OPEC members cheated further on
their quotas, O'Connell said.
   Ayoub did not mention any OPEC countries by name, but said that
all countries should remain committed to their quotas and ``stay
away from unclear selling tactics.''

   Italians are riding the range in Arizona. West Germans are
inspecting plantations in South Carolina. And Japanese are teeing
up wherever they find a nice golf course.
   Heading into the Independence Day weekend, tourism officials
were predicting the lure of the cheaper dollar would help bring a
record 30.2 million foreign visitors to the United States this year.
   The expected increase is modest, up less than 2 percent from
29.7 million last year. And not all of the visitors are tourists.
Many come for business, as students, or to visit friends and
relatives.
   But the financial power of foreign visitors _ they are expected
to spend a record $22.1 billion here this year _ is reshaping the
hospitality business.
   ``The U.S. is on sale,'' William D. Toohey, president of the
Travel Industry Association of America, told foreign tour operators
last month in a gathering held in Dallas in May.
   Americans are learning to provide the amenities they get when
they travel abroad. Multilingual signs are popping up. Some
big-city hotels now have same-day delivery of Japanese newspapers.
   Tourism professionals also say they have to cater to the
particular tastes of specific nationalities.
   It turns out many West Germans have a fascination with the
pre-Civil War South, while Europeans of all kinds feel they haven't
seen America without a pony ride way out West.
   ``I have 82 Italians here right now,'' Bob Cote, the owner and
camp cook of the Tanque Verde Ranch outside Tucson, Ariz., said
Thursday. ``Cowboys and Indians are typically American, so that's a
strong image for them.''
   Although for some foreigners the United States has not become a
major travel bargain _ it is not much cheaper for Canadians than it
used to be and has become more expensive for Mexicans _ shifting
exchange rates have doubled the power of currencies such as the
Japanese yen and West German mark since early 1985.
   The 11.8 million Canadians who are expected to arrive this year
vastly outnumber visitors from other countries, while Mexicans are
second at 6.4 million, according to projections of the U.S. Travel
& Tourism Administration.
   But the border nations are getting less notice lately than the
free-spending Japanese, who are in third place and rising rapidly.
   About 2.8 million Japanese are expected this year, up 30 percent
from 1987, the fastest growth rate of any major country. The growth
should continue under Japan's Ten Million Program, which seeks to
double the annual number of Japanese tourists going abroad to 10
million by 1991.
   Hawaii has been a popular Japanese tourist spot, drawing about
1.2 million Japanese visitors. Tourism officials have tried to help
by putting up many signs in Japanese _ perhaps too many.
   ``Some of them have come to me and said, `We're going to visit
in a foreign land; we ought to be able to fend for ourselves,'''
said Gene Cotter, senior vice president for marketing at the Hawaii
Visitors Bureau. ``You're damned if you do and damned if you
don't.''
   A step at a time, cautious Japanese tourists have ventured from
Hawaii, to the West Coast, to New York City, where shopping at
Tiffany's and bus tours through Harlem are popular.
   Around 1986, the Japanese began to discover Washington. All
Nippon Airways, which began direct flights between Tokyo and
Washington that year, says an expansion to daily service has been
held back only by a lack of pilots and planes.
   The United States is a paradise of fairways and greens to the
Japanese, some of whom do most of their golfing back home on
multi-tiered driving ranges because it is so hard to get a tee time
on crowded courses.
   Japanese visitors tend to stick to well-traveled routes, while
Europeans are more willing to rent a car and discover America. But
even the Europeans don't spend a lot of vacation time in heartland
states such as Iowa.
   Farmers from more than 25 countries are expected to compete in
the plowing match during the World Ag Expo at the Amana Colonies in
September, but sightseers from abroad are fairly scarce in Iowa,
said Skip Strittmatter, marketing manager for the state Bureau of
Visitors and Tourism.
   South Carolina capitalized on the popularity of the ``North and
South'' television series about the Civil War, which was shown
twice in West Germany, by offering a free trip to the Palmetto
State in a joint promotion with a German women's magazine, Das Neue
Blatt.
   The states, locales and tourist attractions that are most
successful in attracting foreign visitors are the ones who began
their efforts before the dollar's big decline, said Hawaii's
Cotter. Hawaii, for example, has representatives spread from
Vancouver, British Columbia, to Thailand and Brunei.
   Disney World in Florida is famed for its marketing to Latin
America.
   In Washington, D.C., Hogate's restaurant expects 60 percent of
its customers will come from abroad this year, the culmination of
marketing efforts that Harriet Epstein has pushed for seven years.
   The French want window seats, the Japanese like ice cream and
the Germans would rather have a Budweiser than a German beer,
Hogate's discovered. The homework, and the sales calls to tour
operators, paid off.
   ``When the tidal wave started to turn in our direction, we were
on the receiving end,'' said Ms. Epstein, the sales director. ``Our
name was on the tip of their tongues.''

<HEAD>Post-Crash Times Tough On Many Stock Market Newsletters</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: New for PMs.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Newsletter editor Michael B. Woods remembers
better times for analyzing over-the-counter stocks.
   ``Last year this time, you could see it when we picked a
stock,'' he said. ``It moved right away. Now, we pick a stock, it
may not budge.''
   Meet another group of the walking wounded from last October's
stock market crash _ entrepreneurs who produce the nation's
investment newsletters.
   Woods and other small purveyors of stock-market advice are
finding their readership has slipped almost as badly as the Dow
Jones average over the past year.
   ``This will be the first year my business will not have grown,''
said Robert J. Nurock, publisher of the Astute Investor, based in
nearby Paoli. ``Even given the fact that I missed calling the
crash, the response to my advertising has been especially poor.''
   Nurock said subscriptions to his Astute Investor have dropped by
28 percent since peaking in January 1987.
   Since the crash, individual investors, wary of the impact of
program trading on the market and the prospect of another collapse,
largely have abandoned stocks. The market for advice, good or
otherwise, is off sharply.
   Even before October, dark clouds were gathering for the
newsletters. The emergence of mutual funds as major investment
vehicles reduced the need to choose individual stocks. At the same
time, the five-year bull market created a proliferation of
investment advice in newspapers and magazines and on television.
   ``Suddenly, we had all this competition,'' said Woods, 36, a
former newspaper reporter. ``We were like the race tracks when
casino gambling came along.''
   Martin Zweig, a widely known market pundit and editor of two New
York newsletters, agreed.
   ``It used to be when you were right, business was good,'' he
told the Philadelphia Inquirer. ``Now you never know. Basically,
the business hasn't been healthy for a couple of years now.''
   Newsletter issuers range from Standard & Poor's Corp. of New
York to individuals armed with little more than a home computer and
their hunches.
   Some publications have thrived in the post-crash environment.
Zweig said the subscription base of his Zweig Forecast has
increased by 4,000, to 14,000, since late November. Overall revenue
is running 80 percent ahead of last year, he said.
   A one-year subscription to Zweig's newsletter, published every
three weeks, costs $245.
   Zweig, a former finance professor and a graduate of the
University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, attributes his
circulation surge to performance. According to a rating of
investment newsletters by Hulbert Financial Digest, Zweig Forecast
was the second-best performer in the five-year period that ended
March 31, posting an 18.9 percent annual return on a portfolio of
selected stocks.
   ``We basically called the crash,'' Zweig said. ``On Oct. 19, we
were only 8 percent invested in stocks.''
   Similarly, James Stack, publisher of InvesTech Market Analyst, a
newsletter published out of Whitefish, Mont., said he began
recommending that his clients get out of the market in April 1987.
By early October, he was out of the market.
   ``Our subscription rate is up 28 percent over the past eight
months,'' said Stack, a former IBM engineer who began his
newsletter six years ago.
   Stack noted he did not escape the year unscathed: clients who
heeded his advice to abandon the market in April found themselves
sitting on the sidelines during last summer's run-up.
   ``We were getting out while the bull market was still going
strong,'' he said. ``We had a 2.5 percent cancellation rate in
August, which is phenomenally high for us. It was very depressing.''
   Woods, a Philadelphian who edits the New York-based publication
OTC Review Special Situations, said circulation peaked at 5,000
subscriptions in the spring of 1987. Since then, subscriptions to
the monthly newsletter, priced at $150 annually, have dropped by
half despite a relatively robust recovery by over-the-counter
stocks.
   The owner of the newsletter, Robert J. Flaherty, asked Woods to
edit it at home and contracted circulation services to an outside
firm. Woods said his April 1 move into a second-floor bedroom was
not a response to the crash, but he acknowledged that industry
cost-cutting is in vogue.
   ``A lot of newsletters are running close to the bone now,'' he
said. ``So far, I haven't suffered any real personal damage, but
there's no doubt we are in for some lean times.''

<HEAD>Former Bank Officers Enter Guilty Pleas In Continental Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRENDA C. COLEMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former officer of Continental Illinois National
Bank & Trust Co. and a former Oklahoma banker will seek probation
after pleading guilty to charges related to Continental's historic
near-collapse, a lawyer says.
   But prosecutors plan to seek prison terms for John R. Lytle, who
admitted misapplying bank funds, and William G. Patterson, who
admitted helping Lytle with the scheme.
   Both entered into a plea agreement Thursday before U.S. District
Judge Milton I. Shadur, nearly two months after a trial of the pair
ended in a mistrial.
   ``It definitely closes the chapter on the Continental Bank-Penn
Square relationship,'' said Assistant U.S. Attorney Joseph Duffy
after Shadur accepted the defendants' guilty pleas and set
sentencing for Aug. 30.
   Each man could get 5 years in prison and a $5,000 fine, but
Lytle's attorney said the defendants would seek probation.
   ``We are looking forward to getting all this behind Mr. Lytle
after a long, long road,'' said attorney James Streicker.
   Penn Square failed in 1982, and Continental came close to
collapse two years later after the largest run on deposits in
banking history, following disclosure that it held millions in poor
energy-related loans. The government kept Continental's doors open
with a record $4.5 billion bailout.
   Lytle, 53, a former vice president who once headed Continental's
oil and gas lending operation in Oklahoma, said: ``I feel we've
come to an agreement that's fair to everyone.''
   Patterson's attorney, Warren Bickford had no comment. His
client, who once had assets valued at $2 million, left the
courtroom in tears.
   Lytle and Patterson were indicted on charges of wire fraud and
misapplication of bank funds, and went to trial in March. But after
seven weeks, the proceeding ended May 3 when the jury became
deadlocked and Shadur declared a mistrial.
   A new trial on eight counts each of wire fraud and three counts
each of misapplication of bank funds was scheduled to begin in
September.
   Lytle was accused of buying millions of dollars in poor-quality
loans from Penn Square Bank in return for kickbacks from Patterson.
   Patterson, 38, former head of energy lending at Penn Square in
Oklahoma City, was accused of arranging the kickbacks in the form
of $585,000 worth of unsecured personal loans to Lytle between 1980
and 1982.
   The jury in the first trial cleared a third defendant, Oklahoma
drilling contractor Jere Sturgis, of wire fraud charges for his
alleged role in a scheme to defraud Continental.
   Patterson was accused of manipulating Lytle and Sturgis in
schemes to save his own failing bank.
   The government said Lytle was caught in spiraling personal debt
to finance a luxurious lifestyle and accepted kickbacks from
Patterson in exchange for taking risky energy loans off Penn
Square's hands at Continental's expense.
   The indictment cited Lytle's involvement in $44 million in loans
made by Continental to 12 Penn Square customers. It did not say how
much was recovered by the Chicago bank.
   In Thursday's guilty plea, Lytle and Patterson admitted
arranging for Continental to buy a $2.25 million loan made by Penn
Square to one of its customers to cover a bad business deal of his
partner, who was already millions of dollars in debt to Penn
Square, Duffy said.

<HEAD>RAIN
   Heavy rain muddied parts of the Plains Thursday and today,
bringing relief to farmers but causing some flooding in Kansas.
   Some fields in northeastern Kansas, plus roads and bridges, were
under up to 5 feet of water Thursday. The heaviest rain reported
was 12 inches in Douglas County, Okla.
   </HEAD>
<HEAD>BEEF PRICES
   Dean Kleckner, president of the American Farm Bureau, said beef
prices should be dropping as a result of the drought. He made the
comments to about 300 representatives of farm organizations, food
processors and retailers attended a three-day conference in St.
Louis on agricultural competitiveness and quality sponsored by the
Department of Agriculture.
   Cattle are being sold in droves because of poor pasture
conditions, he said.

<HEAD>WHEAT RESERVES</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   A federal analyst told the National Association of Wheat Growers
that drought will cut the nation's wheat reserves by as much as
half by next June 1.
   Bruce Weber of the U.S. Agricultural Stabilization and
Conservation Service told the growers meeting at Steamboat Springs,
Colo., on Wednesday that the drought could drop the current
inventory of 1.2 billion bushels down to 600 million or 700 million
bushels by next June. That would be the lowest wheat inventory
since three years of sales to the Soviet Union in the early 1970s
diminished the stockpile to 350 million bushels, he said.

<TEXT>
   U.S. supercomputer manufacturers said Friday they
were disappointed with the Japanese government's failure to
purchase U.S.-made supercomputers despite Japan's commitment last
year to encourage such procurements.
   A bilateral agreement to promote, though not guarantee, Japanese
public-sector purchases of U.S. supercomputers went into effect
last August after the United States complained that the Japanese
government was favoring Japanese supercomputers over their American
counterparts.
   ``I think disappointed is the word'' to describe U.S. computer
makers' feeling toward Japanese government procurement of American
supercomputers, John McPhee, director of the U.S. Commerce
Department's Office of Computers and Business Equipment, told
reporters at the Foreign Correspondents Club of Japan.
   Supercomputers are advanced-technology computers that perform
complex calculations at rapid speed and are used in such fields as
science, engineering and the military.
   McPhee said the first three government procurements in Japan
since the agreement went into effect, by the state-run Tohoku and
Hokkaido universities and the High Energy Physics Laboratory, went
to NEC and Hitachi, which along with Fujitsu are Japan's leading
computer makers.
   ``It's curious to us as we look at the data to see that (U.S.
firms) have 80-85 percent of the supercomputer market in the rest
of the world, but a relatively small share of the private sector in
Japan, and until recently had no installations in the Japanese
government,'' McPhee said.
   McPhee headed a delegation of six U.S. supercomputer
manufacturers which conducted a trade seminar and exhibition in
Tokyo this week. The delegation consisted of Cray Research Inc.,
ETA Systems Inc., Evans & Sutherland Computer Corp., Myrias
Computer Corp., Prime Computer Inc., and Scientific Computer
Systems Corp.
   ``The solutions (to performance problems) that these firms bring
to the market are an attractive package for Japanese users,''
McPhee said.
   The delegation came to Japan to familiarize potential Japanese
clients with their technology and to study possible joint marketing
of their products with Japanese partners, said Lee Adamson, Prime
Computer's senior manager for engineering and scientific sales
support.
   ``We're having tremendous interest with prospects for
accounts,'' Adamson said. ``My experience on this mission with
prospects we've talked to and the excitement and interest of our
subsidiary in Japan for the mini-supercomputer market has been very
good, and we expect some major sales in the Japanese market.''

<HEAD>Japan's Current Account Surplus Continues To Fall</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Strong economic growth cut the broadest measure of
Japan's trade surplus by 19 percent in May from a year earlier and
pushed down the jobless rate to a three-year low of 2.5 percent,
the government said Friday.
   The surplus in the current account, the broadest measure of a
nation's commerce, including trade in goods and services as well as
capital transfers, fell to $5.79 billion from $7.12 billion in
April and $7.11 billion in May 1987, the ministry said.
   May was the second month in a row that the surplus declined from
both previous-month and year-earlier levels.
   During the first three months of the year, Japan's economy grew
at an annual rate of 11.3 percent, its highest level in 11 years.
   The expansion of the economy fueled heavy demand for imports,
including steel, lumber and non-ferrous metals, the Finance
Ministry said. Exports were led by such products as computers and
semiconductors.
   Unemployment in May fell 0.1 percentage point from the previous
month to a seasonally adjusted 2.5 percent, the Management and
Coordination Agency said. The May rate represented a sharp
turnaround from the record high of 3.2 percent registered in the
same month a year earlier.
   The number of job holders hit a record 61 million, up 2.2
percent from 59.8 million a year earlier.
   The official said the number of jobs increased in virtually all
industrial sectors, with companies becoming increasingly eager to
hire new workers to meet growing demand.
   The chief exception was agriculture, which registered a drop of
50,000 jobs during the month, the agency said.
   A 2.5 percent unemployment rate was last registered in April
1985.
   Japan's unemployment rate would be higher if calculated by U.S.
and European methods.

   The stock market inched ahead today, bidding to
extend its early-summer rally.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose .89 to 2,142.60 in
the first half hour of trading.
   Gainers slightly outnumbered losers in the overall tally of New
York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 492 up, 455 down and 458
unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 43.23 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   More than a third of that activity came in a few utility issues,
which were involved in short-term trading strategies based on their
quarterly dividend payments.
   Analysts said worries about inflation had been diminished in
recent days by rainfall in the drought-plagued Farm Belt and
declines in world oil prices.
   The easing of inflationary expectations has sparked a rally of
late in the bond market, pushing yields on long-term Treasury bonds
below 9 percent.
   However, brokers said traders appeared cautious about making
large commitments today on the eve of the long July 4 weekend. The
markets will be closed on Monday for the holiday.
   Gainers among the blue chips included American Express, up | at
27~; International Business Machines, up \ at 127|, and American
Telephone & Telegraph, up [ at 26~.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
.03 to 154.50. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up .05 at 309.30.
   On Thursday the Dow Jones industrial average rose 19.73 to
2,141.71. The average finished the first half of the year with a
gain of 202.88 points, or 10.46 percent.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by nearly 3 to 1 on the
NYSE, with 1,177 up, 410 down and 382 unchanged. Big Board volume
came to 227.41 million shares, against 159.59 million in the

declines in world oil prices.
   The easing of inflationary expectations has sparked a rally of
late in the bond market, pushing yields on long-term Treasury bonds
below 9 percent.
   However, brokers said traders appeared cautious about making
large commitments today on the eve of the long July 4 weekend. The
markets will be closed on Monday for the holiday.
   Losers among the blue chips included International Business
Machines, down [ at 127\; DuPont, down } at 92[; General Electric,
down \ at 43|, and American Telephone & Telegraph, down [ at 26|.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
.50 to 153.97. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was off .48 at 308.77.

<HEAD>Many Companies Confused About Toxic Release Reports</HEAD>

   Thousands of companies may still be unaware of
the need to meet today's deadline for reporting release of any one
of 328 different toxic chemicals into the environment last year,
says an industry representative.
   ``There's a tremendous amount of misunderstanding out there,''
said Theresa Pugh, dealing with the issue for the National
Association of Manufacturers.
   The confusion arises because many businesses have assumed the
law applies only to chemical companies, and no one has been able to
mount a loud enough publicity campaign, she said.
   ``Throughout NAM in the past month, we've had about 1,000 calls
inquiring whether a business is covered by the law, and I can count
on the fingers of one hand those that weren't,'' she said Thursday.
   A New York public relations firm chimed in today with evidence
backing up her point: Interviews with representatives of 81
companies covered by the new law found only 24 had a program to
answer questions at installations using the chemicals.
   ``Many companies in the food, transportation and instruments
industries appear to be largely unprepared,'' said a statement from
Ketchum Public Affairs, part of Ketchum Communications Inc.
   The 1986 law requiring the reports was one response of Congress
to the disastrous leak in Bhopal, India, of methyl isocyanate in
1984 that killed almost 3,000 people.
   The law potentially applies to almost all manufacturers _ the
Standard Industrial Classification Codes 20 through 39 of the
Commerce Department. The Environmental Protection Agency has
certain discretion to expand it.
   The agency estimates that 30,000 installations probably should
file five-page forms on an average of 10 different chemicals _ a
total of 1.5 million pages.
   Not every company must report _ only those with 10 or more
employees that manufacture, import or process 75,000 pounds per
year of any of the chemicals, or use 10,000 pounds per year. These
threshold quantities decline in future years.
   Companies that process a chemical make it an ingredient of a
product, for an example. An example of use, on the other hand, is
cleaning with a chemical.
   Affected companies must report all deliberate and accidental
releases as well as leaks. If measurements or calculations are
unavailable, ``engineering judgment'' may be used.
   Reports must be made to EPA and to state authorities.
   Environmentalists are counting on the accessibility of the data
in computer form to generate political support for a broader and
tighter program of regulation.
   ``I'll tell you what the public reaction is going to be: It's
not going to like the fact that the environment is used as a
dumping ground for all these chemicals,'' said Debbie Sheiman of
the Natural Resources Defense Council.
   Chris Cathcart of the Chemical Manufacturers Association, whose
trade group has sent emissaries from its own ranks and from members
into hundreds of newspaper offices to explain what's coming, said,
``It would not be a good thing ... if people just drew conclusions
from the numbers.''
   The association has encouraged member companies to release forms
publicly as they file them, and Cathcart said the group is telling
people, ``You should talk to people you have confidence in'' if
anything about the reports arouses concern.
   Some of the numbers are going to be huge: about 2.2 billion
pounds of toluene, a common petrochemical, are released to the air
nationwide each year.
   No one has a good idea of the total for all the covered
chemicals, or the damage being done.
   The 328 chemicals were specified by Congress from lists used by
New Jersey and Maryland programs. EPA says slightly more than half
can cause cancer, at least in animals, and 44 percent are acutely
toxic.
   Several years ago, EPA estimated that airborne chemicals were
causing 2,000 annual deaths from cancer.

   More than 10,000 submarine builders at the
Electric Boat shipyard went on strike today after refusing to
accept the company's offer of lump-sum bonuses instead of wage
increases over the next three years.
   The Metal Trades Council, representing more than half of the
shipyard's 18,000 workers, negotiated with the company until a half
hour before the midnight deadline before announcing an impasse.
   No new talks were planned, union and company officials said
early today.
   About 300 chanting pickets marched outside the gates of the
giant yard under sunny skies this morning. City police reported two
arrests, one of a man setting off fireworks and another of a man
who allegedly drove his car through police barricades in front of
the plant, nearly hitting some pickets.
   Company officials didn't know how many people stayed off the job
today. Union officials said 5,000 blue-collar workers normally
report for the first shift.
   The submarine workers voted 4,921-3,140 Thursday to reject the
latest contract offer from Electric Boat, a division of General
Dynamics Corp.
   Electric Boat is one of only two shipyards making nuclear
submarines for the Navy, and the only manufacturer of giant subs
capable of carrying the Trident ballistic missile.
   Electric Boat General Manager Fritz Tovar said a strike will not
stop submarine construction. The company made arrangements to
reassign 3,000 of its 8,000 salaried employees to new jobs within
the yard, he said.
   Electric Boat offered employees bonuses worth 5 percent of a
worker's wages during the first contract year and 4 percent during
the second and third years of the pact. The union demanded wage
increases of 5 percent, 4 percent and 4 percent.
   The shipyard said it could not afford to raise base pay if it
was to remain competitive in its pursuit of Navy contracts.
   ``We have maintained steadfastly that not increasing the base
(pay) is what is going to close the competitive disadvantage we
have with Newport News Shipbuilding,'' said Electric Boat spokesman
Neil Ruenzel.
   Pickets went up one minute past midnight outside the shipyard's
main gate, located along the Thames River that flows into eastern
Long Island Sound.
   ``No one likes to see a strike,'' said Metal Trades Council
President Joseph Messier. ``The company doesn't like to see it, the
union doesn't like to see it, the community doesn't like to see it,
but it just comes down to you've just got to do what you've got to
do.''
   The last strike at the shipyard was in 1975, when the union
walked out for five months and the region's economy sagged.
   Electric Boat's final offer, presented Monday, called for
bonuses totaling $4,250 over three years for a first-class mechanic
making $12.02 an hour, said Thomas Sotir, vice president of human
resources.
   Earlier Thursday, the Navy awarded this year's third and final
SSN-688 attack submarine contract to Electric Boat. The $347.4
million contract will go to Electric Boat's main shipyard here and
its other plant, in North Kingstown, R.I., which is unaffected by
the strike.
   Newport News, which pays its workers 60 cents an hour less than
Electric Boat, recently won two contracts for nuclear attack
submarines after it underbid Electric Boat.

<HEAD>Grain, Soybean Futures Open Higher</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Futures prices of grain and soybeans opened
sharply higher today on the Chicago Board of Trade amid forecasts
for a long, dry Independence Day weekend in the Midwest, analysts
said.
   Corn prices got an additional boost from indications that the
Soviet Union was in the market for U.S. and Argentinian corn. Talk
of Soviet purchases helped drive corn futures up their daily
trading limit of 10 cents a bushel at the opening bell, said Dale
Gustafson, an analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. in Chicago.
   Early advances in the other trading pits were limited by
profit-taking ahead of the long holiday weekend, he said.
   ``This is a nervous trading market and it will stay that way
today unless someone changes their weather forecast at midday,''
Gustafson said.
   Thursday's monthly grain stocks report from the Agriculture
Department, which showed larger-than-expected stocks of corn, wheat
and soybeans, also offset some of the bullish enthusiusm,, he said.
   In early trading, wheat was 9 cents to 14 cents higher with the
contract for delivery in July at $3.98{ a bushel; corn was 1{ cents
to 15 cents higher with July, on which the daily price limit has
been removed, at $3.42 a bushel; oats were 2 cents to 13 cents
higher with July at $3.55 a bushel; soybeans were 10{ cents to 22{
cents higher with July at $10.02 a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were sharply lower, with pork futures
down their daily limits, in early trading on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange.
   The sharp declines in pork futures were linked to Wednesday's
USDA hogs and pigs report, which showed an unexpectedly large U.S.
hog herd, analysts said.
   Live cattle were unchanged to .90 cent lower with August at
63.70 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .20 cent to .87 cent lower
with August at 73.10 cents a pound; hogs were 1.50 cents lower
across the board with July at 44.82 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were 2 cents lower across the board with July at 35.25
cents a pound.

   Big jumps in factory and office building boosted construction
spending 1.1 percent in May, offsetting declines elsewhere, the
government said today in a report that suggested U.S. manufacturers
are actively investing for the future.
   The Commerce Department said that building activity rose to a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of $407.1 billion in May following
a 0.2 percent dip in April. In March, construction shot up 2.8
percent.
   The department's report put factory construction at 22.8 percent
above the same level last year, a reflection of strong growth in
America's manufacturing industries because of increased demand,
primarily higher exports.
   But the report also showed a 1 percent decline in residential
construction in May, another indication that higher interest rates
have hurt the housing industry by making mortgage loans
unaffordable to many potential homebuyers.
   In other economic news early today, stocks retreated in
pre-weekend profit taking after a broad gain Thursday but the bond
market rose on the strength of the dollar.
   The U.S. currency's resilience came despite moves Thursday by
West Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Austria and Belgium to
raise their interest rates, which would tend to weaken the dollar.
   The markets also ignored a $99 billion rise in the U.S. foreign
debt for 1987, reported Tursday by the Commerce Department. The
increase to $368.2 billion underscored fears by many critics that
the country is living beyond its means and is losing its worldwide
political and economic might.
   ``As long as the United States has to rely on foreign financing
of such magnitudes, events could at literally any moment trigger a
sharp turndown in our economy,'' said C. Fred Bergsten, director of
the Institute for International Economics in Washington.
   But the Reagan administration contends that the leap in the
nation's debt during its tenure largely reflects the investment
attractions in this country, with foreigners pouring in money to
buy real estate, factories and securities.
   The other big market news Thursday was in Chicago's commodity
pits, where soybean and grain speculators drove prices up sharply,
ending a two-day decline caused by rainfall on the water-starved
farm belt.
   The buying rush came after the National Weather Service issued
its latest 30-day outlook late Wednesday, calling for almost no
rainfall in the critical areas.
   Elsewhere Thursday, the Commerce Department said orders to U.S.
factories for manufactured goods fell 0.6 percent in May,
reflecting a sharp drop in demand for aircraft that was offset by
strength in other areas.
   It was the largest one-month decline since a 1.4 percent drop in
August, but economists weren't concerned because orders had been up
sharply in March and April. They said the May decline actually
could be good for the economy by giving overworked factories an
opportunity to catch up with unfilled orders.

   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 5.86 to 2,135.85
by noontime on Wall Street.
   Losers held a 3-2 lead over gainers in the overall tally of New

<TEXT>
   Canada's one-dollar coin, nicknamed the Loonie
because one side depicts a swimming loon, will entirely replace the
paper dollar bill within two years, the government has announced.
   The Loonie was introduced last year under a plan to save
taxpayers 175 million Canadian dollars, or about $145 million, over
20 years because coins have a longer circulation life than paper
bills.
   But public acceptance of the gold-colored, 11-sided coin has
been limited and most banks and stores still provide customers with
dollar bills.
   Many Canadians have hoarded Loonies, believing the coin will
share the demise of the Susan B. Anthony dollar coin introduced in
the United States in 1979 and overwhelmingly rejected.
   But the federal government, acting upon recommendations of the
Royal Canadian Mint and House of Commons, says production of dollar
bills will cease on June 30, 1989, and the bills will cease to be
legal tender about one year later, the normal life span of a paper
dollar.

   Seven babies are born every second in Asia and the
continent may be only days away from reaching 3 billion
inhabitants, an occasion causing some concern in the world's most
crowded corner, experts said Friday.
   China, faced with a motherlode of maternity, marked the occasion
with a ceremony and speeches that urged its citizens to keep
practicing birth control. In Tokyo, a group of experts gathered to
debate the significance of the approaching milestone, its effects
on the family and the growing problem of feeding all those people.
   Takashi Sato, Japan's minister of agriculture, said ``excessive
population growth will result in shortages of food, resources and
energy ... and environmental destruction beyond national boundaries.
   ``Without global-level responses to the issues of population,
food, environment and development, it would be difficult for the
world to welcome a peaceful 21st century,'' said Sato, chairman of
the Asian Forum of Parliamentarians on Population and Development,
which sponsored the conference.
   In July 1987, the world's population passed 5 billion, double
the population in 1950.
   According to United Nations estimates, Asia's population will
reach 3 billion at 47 minutes after midnight Greenwich Mean Time on
Aug. 10 (8:47 p.m. EDT Aug. 9). Asian experts, however, predict the
milestone will be reached within days.
   Professor Gayl D. Ness of the University of Michigan estimated
that Asia's population would grow to 3.5 billion by the end of the
century and to 4.5 billion by 2025, while the world population
reaches 8.2 billion.
   Rice production will have to increase 50 percent by 2025 to feed
the continent, Ness said, but great gains already have been
registered by farmers in China, Japan and Southeast Asia.
   The 21st century targets ``are well within the realm of
possibility if the agricultural transformation continues. This, of
course, requires sensitive government policies,'' said the
sociologist and researcher on Asian population.
   Asia has made ``substantial progress'' in lowering fertility
rates, and Asian countries were the first to adopt policies to
limit population growth, he said.
   But Ness noted disparities in different regions of Asia. East
Asian countries such as China and Japan, which has 122 million
people, have rapidly declining fertility rates.
   But in South Asia, India is still experiencing 2.08 percent
annual growth in its population of 818 million; Pakistan has 3.45
percent growth with 115 million people; and Bangladesh has 2.67
percent growth rate from a current base of 110 million, according
to U.N. figures.
   ``The challenge lies ahead in completing the demographic
transition and bringing birth rates down to match the fall in the
death rates,'' Ness said.
   He and other panelists were critical of the United States for
withdrawing money from the U.N. Fund for Population Activities
because of the fund's support for abortion.
   The population growth also has caused some social changes.
   Professor Toshio Kuroda, director emeritus of Tokyo's Institute
of Population at Nihon University, noted that China ``expects the
family to care for the aged ... but the family is undergoing
tremendous change in China with the one-child family.''
   China, the world's most populous country with 1.08 billion
people, has since the early 1980s limited most families to one
child. But the limit has been widely flouted in the past two years.
   In Beijing, Chinese officials marked the Day of 3 Billion In
Asia with a ceremony in the Great Hall of the People.
   They handed out cassette players to 18 family planning workers,
doctors and others for ``outstanding performance in implementing
our population policy.''
   Speakers warned that rapid population growth poses a threat to
economic development.
   ``We cannot think that we can have more children because of
economic development ... nor can we relax our efforts because of
progress in family planning,'' said Hu Keshi, forum vice chairman.

   Polluters should be punished for allowing rampant
industrial waste to push the Soviet Union to the brink of an
ecological disaster, the head of the country's new environmental
protection committee said Friday.
   Fyodor Morgun, chief of the committee that was created in
January, told a Communist Party conference that ``the grave
ecological situation has emerged because of the ill-considered
drive to build gigantic plants.''
   Morgun said the natural fertility of soils is declining, topsoil
is decreasing and forests are ``in an unsatisfactory condition.''
   The air in all industrial centers is polluted ``above the
hygienic standards'' and ``the quality of water in the rivers
worsens nearly everywhere,'' he said.
   He said the Caspian and Baltic seas are polluted and called the
Aral Sea ``a disaster zone.''
   ``Behind the facts of outrages upon nature and damage done to
human health are certain people in science, design institutions and
builders, members of state commissions, with whose blessing
facilities were put into operation which destroy nature,'' Morgun
said.
   ``Those who are responsible for the problems should be mentioned
by name and be punished according to their deserts,'' he added.
   Morgun addressed the 5,000 delegates at the conference a day
after a steelworker from the Urals city of Nizhny Tagil criticized
government leaders for their failure to tackle problems he said had
reached the proportions of ``a Chernobyl-like catastrophe.''
   Steelworker Veniamin Yarin lent force to his appeal by depicting
the situation in his city, where 10,000 people demonstrated earlier
this year against failure to close two 45-year-old coke-fired
furnaces at the city's steel mill.
   One Soviet media report said 54 children were stillborn in the
city last year. Nizhny Tagil has a population of 403,000.
   Yarin said the government should devise an emergency program for
up to 60 Soviet cities he said were polluted beyond all norms.
   The environment has become an issue of great concern to many
Soviets as Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy of ``glasnost,'' or
openness, has revealed the extent of ecological damage in candid
media articles.
   The Ural Mountain region is in particularly bad shape. The area
was heavily industrialized during World War II as the Soviets moved
their factories eastward, away from the invading Nazis.
   The Communist Party daily newspaper Pravda said in December that
another Urals industrial city, Ufa, was unfit for human habitation.
   Environmental damage is also a sensitive issue in the Baltic
republics, whose delegations each mentioned the need to tackle what
the Estonians term an ecological ``catastrophe'' in written
platforms submitted to delegates.
   The Communist Party chief of Uzbekistan referred Thursday to the
catastrophic drop in the level of the Aral Sea, a vast inland sea
seriously depleted by schemes to irrigate the arid republics of
Central Asia.
   A newspaper account in 1983 said excessive tapping of the sea
for irrigation had halved its depth in a decade and caused the
shoreline to recede 40 miles in a few years.
   Morgun is head of a committee established in January to deal
with the mounting environmental problems. He said measures have
been outlined to improve the situation, but did not immediately
give any details.

   After a quarter century on the job, the ZIP
code _ like most of us _ has gained a little weight. But it still
helps smooth the flow of nearly half the world's mail.
   Friday marked the 25th anniversary of that string of numbers
bringing up the rear of every American address, a system ordered
into use by by then-Postmaster General J. Edward Day, who says he
simply got tired of waiting for bureaucrats to finish studying the
idea.
   Day's original five-digit system held sway for 20 years and is
still the most commonly seen.
   An expanded version was introduced in 1983, though, adding four
more numbers to bring the total to nine _ a voluntary addition
officially called ``ZIP Plus 4'' but referred to in postal circles
as ``Son of ZIP.''
   The basic system, says senior assistant postmaster general John
G. Mulligan, has been a ``roaring success.''
   The United States, with only about 6 percent of the world's
population, has 50 percent of the world's mail volume, Mulligan
points out.
   By way of comparison, the New York metropolitan area handles
about the same volume of mail as all of Great Britain, and the
Chicago area's mail is about equal to Japan's, said Day, who now is
retired from government service and is living in a Maryland suburb
of Washington.
   In the 25 years since the introduction of ZIP _ which stands for
Zone Improvement Program _ U.S. mail volume has more than doubled,
but the Postal Service employs only about 15 percent more people,
Mulligan said. And the ZIP system is a big factor in that labor
saving.
   ``No direct calculation of the exact savings has been made,''
Mulligan said in an interview. ``It's hard to separate the effect
of the ZIP code from other things. But believe me, I think it's up
there in the several billions of dollars.''
   In 1963 the United States Post Office carried 67.9 billion
pieces of mail, sorted by human beings at a maximum rate of 800
items an hour. Now reconstituted as the U.S. Postal Service, the
agency handled 153.9 billion pieces last year. With ZIP codes the
mail can be sorted by machines at a rate of 27,000 to 35,000 pieces
an hour.
   Public acceptance has been ``amazing,'' said Mulligan, with ZIP
codes on about 97 percent of the items mailed. Even better, he
added, 95 percent of mail comes in with correct ZIP codes.
   A variety of coding systems had been under study when Day lost
patience. What he did was simply to announce, during a speech in
December 1962, that a new coding system would take effect the
following July 1.
   It worked. Years of study ended and within six months the agency
decided on a five-digit system, divided the nation into regions and
assigned a code to each of the more than 30,000 post offices in the
country.
   The system took effect July 1, 1963, accompanied by promotional
hoopla organized by the Post Office and grumbling by people afraid
they would lose their identities to some anonymous numbers.
   The ZIP code divided the nation into 10 slices, each starting
with a different number, from ``0'' in New England to ``9'' on the
Pacific Coast.
   The next two numbers designate a major city in the area, for
example 606 is Chicago. Finally, the last two numbers localize the
address to a neighborhood post office. And the four newly added
digits in the code narrow the delivery down to one side of a city
block or even one floor of a large office building in a major city.

   The stock market gave ground today in a flurry
of pre-holiday weekend selling.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 4.80 to 2,136.91
by 2 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by more than 4 to 3 in the overall
tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 519 up, 750
down and 487 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 195.30 million shares with two
hours to go.
   About half of today's activity came in a few utility issues,
which were involved in short-term trading strategies based on their
quarterly dividend payments.
   Analysts said worries about inflation had been diminished in
recent days by rainfall in the drought-plagued Farm Belt and
declines in world oil prices.
   The easing of inflationary expectations has sparked a rally of
late in the bond market, pushing yields on long-term Treasury bonds
below 9 percent.
   However, brokers said traders appeared cautious about making
large commitments today on the eve of the long July 4 weekend. The
markets will be closed on Monday for the holiday.

stock fell 1] Thursday on disappointment over the size of the
quarterly earnings gain posted by the company.
   Today National said it would buy back 4.1 million of its common
shares and 4.1 warrants to buy its stock from Schlumberger Ltd.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell

<TEXT>
   Eastern Airlines and its parent, Texas Air Corp.,
on Friday canceled a contract calling for Eastern to sell its
popular Northeast shuttle service to another Texas Air subsidiary.
   Eastern gave no explanation for the ``mutual'' cancellation in a
terse news release and said no other details would be forthcoming.
   ``This is one of those releases where we can't make any comment
beyond the text. The release will have to speak for itself,'' said
Eastern spokeswoman Karen Ceremsak.
   Spokesmen for Eastern's Machinists union, which battled the
proposed sale in court, and for Houston-based Texas Air did not
immediately return telephone calls.
   The sale of the profitable Washington-New York-Boston shuttle
routes to the newly created Texas Air subsidiary would have brought
the financially ailing Eastern $225 million, company officials have
said.
   In March, U.S. District Judge John H. Pratt in Washington,
ruling on a suit filed by the Machinists, said Eastern, by taking
steps to sell the shuttle, had flouted a July 1987 order that
barred it from transferring 6,000 ground crew members to the other
Texas Air subsidiary.
   But on June 7, the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington lifted
that injunction. The appeals court said Pratt had erred in holding
Eastern in contempt for taking the steps.
   The International Association of Machinists, which represents
about 13,000 Eastern workers, has long contended that Texas Air
aims to break up the carrier it bought in 1986.
   The Machinists union and Eastern are holding secret contract
talks guided by federal mediators. The union has rejected deep pay
and benefit cuts the company calls necessary to return to
profitability.
   Eastern has lost a total of nearly $1 billion in the past 10
years.

   Share prices rose fractionally Friday on the
London Stock Exchange as the market plodded along in the absence of
any market-affecting news.
   The start of the weekend and Monday's Independence Day holiday
in the United States kept many participants sidelined. In addition,
some players were taking a wait-and-see attitude amid speculation
that British interest rates could rise over the next week.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index closed 0.6
point, or 0.03 percent, higher at 1,858.2.
   On Wall Street, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was down
6.22 points at 2,135.49 as the London session drew to a close,
after opening about 3 points higher. Dealers said Wall Street was
not providing a substantial influence on London share prces.
   Fears of another increase in British interest rates, following
Tuesday's half-percentage-point rise to 9.5 percent in bank's base
lending rates, were triggered by renewed strength in the dollar,
dealers said.

<HEAD>China Sets Up Largest Airline in Reorganization of Flag Carrier</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China's largest airline, Air China, was
established Friday under a plan to revamp the Civil Aviation
Administration of China, the state-run flag carrier that has been
criticized for mismanagement and inefficiency.
   The government announced more than a year ago plans to bring
competition into civil aviation and separate CAAC's government
functions from its business management by creating six airline
companies.
   ``The establishment of Air China is an important achievement for
CAAC in implementing the civil aviation system reform plan,'' Hu
Yizhou, director general of CAAC told a reception at Beijing's
Great Hall of the People.
   Vice Premier Tian Jiyun and representatives of major
international airlines that fly to China attended the reception.
   A large red-and-white banner across the stage bore the words
``Air China'' and the airline's logo, a red phoenix.
   Attendents were dressed in the airline's new uniforms, designed
by Pierre Cardin. The sophisticated two-piece wool outfits and
peaked cap, all in vibrant blue, contrast sharply with the
ill-fitting, blue-gray pantsuits worn by CAAC stewardesses.
   Air China will be the nation's major international carrier,
operating 32 overseas routes to 31 cities in 24 countries. It also
will operate 44 domestic routes to 30 cities.
   The airline, with a fleet of 46 planes and a staff of nearly
1,000, is the third and largest to be established under CAAC's
decentralization plans.
   China Eastern Airlines, based in Shanghai, and the Chengdu-based
Southwest China Airlines were formed earlier this year under the
decentralization plan. CAAC now has a strictly administrative role
and will no longer manage airline business. The airlines operate as
enterprises responsible for their own profits and losses.

   Ford Motor Co. has offered settlements of
less than $1 million to each of the families of 24 children killed
in a fiery church bus crash, The Courier-Journal reported Friday.
   Citing unidentified lawyers close to the case, the newspaper
also reported that Ford, which manufactured the chassis of the bus
involved in the accident, offered payments to the estates of the
three adults who died and to the 40 survivors of the May 14 crash,
based on the severity of their injuries.
   Lawyer Don Skeeters, a spokesman for the firm that represents
many of the families, would neither confirm nor deny the report.
   Michael Hance, who represents the families of two of the dead
children, said the settlement was being offered by Ford and all
manufacturers responsible for producing the bus, including Sheller
Globe Corp. of Toledo, Ohio, which assembled it.
   Hance declined to disclose the size of the offers, but described
them as ``attractive financially'' to the families and also a good
deal for Ford.
   Robert Waite, a spokesman for the Dearborn, Mich.-based Ford,
said ``delicate'' negotiations were under way but declined comment
on whether a settlement had been offered. Sheller Globe's spokesman
did not return phone calls.
   The wreck occurred as the converted school bus, owned by the
Radcliff First Assembly of God Church, was returning 67 people to
the church after a day at an amusement park. Police say the
accident was caused by a drunken driver traveling the wrong way on
Interstate 71.
   But investigators have said other factors combined to increase
the loss of life, including the bus' lone rear exit door and
crowded conditions inside. Authorities have also pointed to the
bus' gas tank, which ruptured in the crash and burst into flames,
with the smoke from the resulting fire blamed for all 27 deaths.
   The bus was apparently one of the last manufactured in 1977
before a new federal rule required bus fuel tanks be sheathed in
protective cages.
   Prominent mass-disaster lawyers said it would be highly unusual
for such a major case to be settled even before lawsuits were filed.
   Washington, D.C., lawyer John Coale, who represents one family
and has been active in several air-disaster cases, said it would be
``unconscionable'' to settle so quickly without exploring whether
Ford might be liable for punitive damages.

   Marie Lemoin came to the United States with a
bag full of dreams and a fist full of dollars.
   The French woman is part of the wave of foreigners taking
advantage of the weak dollar to visit America and splurge on goods
that have become bargains in terms of their own currencies.
   Ms. Lemoin, 21, arrived in New York this year carrying a
suitcase, a satchel stuffed with guidebooks and slick tourist
brochures and a wad of travelers' checks and assorted U.S. currency.
   She said she never expected her money to go so far.
   But Yvonne Gomez and her husband, Ramiro, of Sao Paulo, Brazil,
stopped in New York en route to a European vacation, expecting to
pick up a lot of bargains.
   ``We're taking his wallet to my favorite places _ Saks and
Bloomingdale's,'' said Mrs. Gomez, anticipating her shopping spree
at two of New York's most stylish department stores.
   Nigel and Rosy Collins of London took their vacation in the
United States for the same reason. They estimated their week-long
trip would cost about half what they would have paid two years ago.
   They may have been carried away in their enthusiasm, since the
dollar is only 10 percent cheaper against the pound than it was at
the end of June 1986.
   ``Everything is so warm, so new, so cheap,'' he said.
   ``And you have Don Johnson,'' his wife added, referring to the
star of popular television detective series ``Miami Vice.''
   Foreigners have been lining up to get into the Empire State
Building, to catch a ride on the Staten Island ferry past the
Statue of Liberty, and to buy half-price tickets for Broadway
shows. They have been packing restaurants in Chinatown and Little
Italy.
   Elsewhere, record crowds are converging on the beaches, popular
tourist attractions in southern Florida and California.
   And the numbers are expected to swell during the summer.
   The rise in foreign tourism is due largely to the weak dollar,
which has doubled the buying power of the Japanese yen and West
German mark since early 1985. Most other nations' currencies also
buy more here.
   By the end of the year, the U.S. Travel and Tourism
Administration predicts a record 30.2 million foreigners will have
visited the United States as tourists, on business, or on visits to
friends and relatives.
   ``I'm hearing French, German and Japanese everywhere. It's like
a language school outside my office,'' said Michael Finley,
superintendent of Florida's 1.4 million-acre Everglades National
Park, where attendance is up more than 40 percent over last year.
   Nearly half of the foreign visitors will come from neighboring
Canada and Mexico, the tourism administration said. But more
Japanese and Europeans are expected to visit than ever before.
   ``Projections are that British, German, and French travel to the
U.S. will hit a new record, and Japan will hit a new record
again,'' said Ron Erdmann of the agency's research office.
   The number of visiting Brazilians also is expected to increase,
in part due to that government's decision to rescind the 25 percent
surtax on overseas plane tickets and on U.S. dollars purchased for
foreign travel.
   Executives at the Resort Hotel Association of Miami Beach, said
they thought they were overly optimistic when they sent their
London tourism office 20,000 brochures touting package deals to the
Florida beach resort.
   ``We were gambling. But in 10 days, we ran out,'' said Murray
Gold, executive director of the association. ``The requests coming
in are phenomenal. We never expected it.''
   Ms. Lemoin, who left France a year ago to study languages in
Sheffield, England, said at first she did not think she could
afford a trip to America. Her home is in Toulouse.
   ``My aunt always told me the first place I should visit was `the
States,''' she said. ``But I thought it would be too expensive.''
   It only took an outing in New York's Greenwich Village and Soho
areas to dispel that notion.
   ``I've been able to buy whatever I want,'' she said, looking out
into New York Harbor from the top of the 110-story World Trade
Center.
   ``I hope to have a lot more of these before I go home,'' she
said, pointing to a huge bag stuffed with a variety of souvenirs,
including T-shirts, postcards, coffee mugs and an apple-shaped key
ring emblazoned with ``I Love New York.''
   And that was just the beginning, she said.
   She pulled out a color pamphlet from the Arizona tourist ageny
and said: ``I'm disappointed the only place I won't get to see is
the Grand Canyon.''

<HEAD>Corn Closes Limit-Up On Drought Fears, Export Rumors</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Corn futures prices closed sharply higher Friday
on the Chicago Board of Trade, with most contracts up the limit for
daily trading on a combination of drought fears and rumors of
Soviet purchases.
   Forecasts for a warm, dry Independence Day weekend in the
Midwest also supported wheat and soybean futures, but oat prices
dropped sharply on indications that U.S. millers were importing
oats from Argentina, analysts said.
   ``Corn was very strong and rumors of Russian buying were
rampant,'' said Victor Lespinasse, a trader for Dean Witter
Reynolds Inc. He said the Soviets were believed to have purchased
500,000 to 1 million metric tons of U.S. corn and an unknown amount
of Argentine corn.
   Most corn contracts advanced the 10-cents-a-bushel limit and the
limitless contract for July delivery soared even higher.
   Gains in the wheat and soybean trading pits, while substantial,
were held down by Thursday's monthly grain stocks report from the
Agriculture Department, which showed larger-than-expected stocks of
corn, wheat and soybeans, Lespinasse said.
   At the close, wheat was 10 cents to 17 cents higher with the
contract for delivery in July at $4.01 a bushel; corn was 9{ cents
to 14 cents higher with July at $3.41 a bushel; oats were 21 cents
lower to 3 cents higher with July at $3.32 a bushel; soybeans were
1{ cents to 28 cents higher with July at $9.90 a bushel.

<HEAD>All U.S. Ford Plants Shut for Two Weeks Vacation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ford Motor Co. is shutting all its U.S. factories
for a two-week summer vacation beginning Saturday, allowing the No.
2 automaker to set up the plants to build 1989 models, the company
said Friday.
   Meanwhile, General Motors Corp., the nation's largest automaker,
was still organizing its summer vacation and model changeover
schedules, which will be scattered through July and August.
   Ford has used a nationwide July vacation shutdown for model
changeovers for the past several years, eliminating the need for
temporary layoffs, spokeswoman Judith Muhlberg said.
   ``It's very efficient. Europe shuts down a month in August,''
she said.
   In the United States, however, workers will have to make up the
lost production time with overtime later in the year because of
surging car and truck sales, which have left Ford with low
inventories.
   During the shutdown, some skilled workers at every plant will
have to stay in the factories, installing new tooling and equipment
for next year's models, Ford spokesman Pete Olsen said.
   GM has scheduled a temporary shutdown of its Fiero plant in
Pontiac next week and a two-week model changeover at its Lake Orion
assembly plant beginning July 15.
   The Fiero plant will end production of the sporty,
plastic-bodied two-seater later this summer at the end of the 1988
model run.
   GM's heavy-duty truck assembly line in Pontiac also will close
temporarily starting July 15 and its medium-duty truck assembly
line closes from Aug. 5-8.
   But demand for light-duty trucks is so high that GM's Pontiac
East assembly plant will continue production through the Aug. 4
changeover to 1989 models, as will the Pontiac West plant during an
Aug. 12 changeover.
   Chrysler Corp. reports its model changeover shutdowns a week
ahead of time. The only plant closed is Newark, Del., which shut
for 16 weeks beginning June 17 for modernization and retooling. The
plant, which built the Dodge Aries and Plymouth Reliant K-cars,
will build the new Dodge Spirit and Plymouth Acclaim sedans.

<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The billionaire Hunt brothers, who settled a $714
million debt for Penrod Drilling Co., are on the verge of settling
a sister company's $704 million debt with 18 of the world's largest
banks, a Hunt Energy Corp. vice president said.
   The $704 million debt is against Placid Oil Co., which is being
reorganized under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.
   The proposed Penrod settlement filed Thursday with U.S.
Bankruptcy Judge Harold Abramson would resolve all issues
surrounding some $760 million in loans to Penrod Drilling, while
bringing the Hunt family trusts that run Penrod out of Chapter 11
bankruptcy protection. The proposal must be approved by the
bankruptcy court.
   In addition, Hunt Energy Corp. Vice President Tom Whitaker said,
the reorganization plan for Placid is ``just around the corner.''
   Penrod, the world's biggest independent offshore oil-drilling
company, and Placid Oil sued 23 of their lenders for fraud and
misrepresentation in 1986 after defaulting on $1.5 billion in bank
loans. Two of the banks since have been dropped from the case.
   The suit sought $14 million in damages, alleging that the banks
_ one group of which had sued to recover $760 million in past due
loans to Penrod _ conspired to drive Penrod and Placid out of
business by forcing them to agree to an unreasonable payment
schedule while offering their competitors more favorable terms.
   In August 1986, the trust estates of William Herbert Hunt,
Nelson Bunker Hunt and Lamar Hunt filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection for the trust partnership that owns Penrod Drilling.
Penrod itself was not under bankruptcy court protection.
   Under the consensual proposal filed Thursday, bank creditors
would receive a $50 million payment and a $500 million secured note
from Penrod Drilling, plus a 50 percent interest in the company,
which is subject to repurchase by the trust estates.
   Some trust real estate will be transferred to the banks, subject
to a $200 million purchase option.
   The trust estates would be released from prior liability to
their bank creditors when the reorganization is complete. Also, the
banks, trust estates and individual members of the Hunt family
would drop claims and counter-claims stemming from the bank loans.
   The proposed settlement has been approved by the group of banks
led by First Chicago, Citicorp and Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co.
   A Hunt estates statement said, ``When approved by the court,
this plan by the trust estates and their bank creditors settles all
issues surrounding the bank loans to Penrod Drilling Corp.''
   There had been speculation that any settlement might require
William Herbert Hunt, manager for the Penrod partners, to
relinquish his power in Penrod's daily operations. However,
Whitaker said the agreement would not affect Hunt's position or the
day-to-day operations of Penrod.
   Whitaker said there was no timetable to the repayment plan. He
also said there should be no problems gaining bankruptcy court
approval of the plan because both sides of the dispute have agreed
to it.
   Penrod employs about 2,300 workers and will have revenue of more
than $250 million this year, Whitaker said.

<HEAD>Coleco Running Short Of Funds</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WEST HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Coleco Industries Inc., which has
enough funds to carry on business through next Thursday only, could
file for protection from its creditors next week, company chairman
Morton E. Handel said Friday.
   Handel would not confirm that his struggling company would
indeed file for protection under Chapter 11 of the federal
bankruptcy law, but he said in a telephone interview that if
anything is to happen, it would be next week.
   ``There really is nothing happening today,'' Handel said.
   Handel, recuperating at home from open-heart surgery, said 12
foreign and domestic lenders, whom Coleco owes $103 million, agreed
to provide money to the company through next Thursday.
   On Thursday, the West Hartford toy company gave up on its plan
to restructure its debts after having repeatedly extended a
deadline for a securities swap by its bondholders.
   Coleco has tried to restructure its finances since March, when
it proposed exchanging $335 million of bonds for a combination of
new bonds and stock. The company said the exchange would save it
millions of dollars a year in interest payments and supply cash for
the business.
   The original exchange terms were rejected by some of the
bondholders, who contended the swap would have reduced the value of
their investment without requiring similar sacrifices from Coleco's
stockholders and bankers.
   ``Unless they can pull a takeover of the company in the next few
days, this sounds like the end,'' said Sean McGowan, an analyst
with the investment firm Balis Zorn Gerard Inc. in New York.
   Handel said Coleco had not received any offers to buy the
company and was not approached by any prospective buyers. He said
other banks are willing to lend Coleco money if it can work out
arrangements with existing lenders.
   The company's current banks have provided short-term financing
to keep Coleco afloat since June 1. But the shortage of money
forced the company to virtually halt production.
   If it survives, Coleco will have few products for store shelves
at Christmas, the crucial season for toy manufacturers.
   The company produces such well-known toys as Cabbage Patch Kids
and Scrabble board games.
   Coleco lost $47.4 million in the quarter that ended April 2. It
has lost money in four of the past five years, including $215
million the last two years.

   The stock market pulled back Friday in a flurry
of pre-holiday-weekend selling.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 10.13 to
2,131.58, closing out the week with a net loss of 11.38 points.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 4 to 3 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
617 up, 848 down and 473 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 238.33 million
shares, against 227.41 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 308.92 million shares.
   Close to half of the day's activity came in a few utility
issues, which were involved in short-term trading strategies based
on their quarterly dividend payments.
   Analysts said worries about inflation had been diminished in
recent days by rainfall in the drought-plagued Farm Belt and
declines in oil prices to their lowest level of the year.
   The contract for August delivery of West Texas Intermediate, the
benchmark U.S. crude fell 22 cents a barrel to $14.94 on the New
York Mercantile Exchange Friday, hitting its lowest levels since
1986.
   The easing of inflationary expectations has sparked a rally of
late in the bond market, pushing yields on long-term Treasury bonds
below 9 percent.
   However, brokers said traders appeared cautious about making
large commitments on the eve of the long July 4 weekend. The
markets will be closed on Monday for the holiday.
   Energy stocks were broadly lower for the second straight
session. Exxon lost } to 44|; Amoco ] to 72]; Chevron [ to 45\, and
Atlantic Richfield [ to 80].
   Losers among the blue chip industrials included Ford Motor, down
{ at 52}; International Business Machines, down } at 126|; DuPont,
down | at 92\; Alcoa, down | at 52|, and American Telephone &
Telegraph, down \ at 26{.
   Cooper Tire jumped 3] to 41. The company said it knew of no
reason for the activity.
   National Semiconductor dropped ] to 12| in active trading. The
stock fell 1] Thursday on disappointment over the size of the
quarterly earnings gain posted by the company.
   On Friday National said it would buy back 4.1 million of its
common shares and 4.1 warrants to buy its stock from Schlumberger
Ltd.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $11.72 billion, or 0.43
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dropped .79 to 153.68.

<HEAD>Bond Prices Rise</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bond prices rose modestly Friday, supported by a
strong dollar, fresh foreign demand and lower oil prices.
   The Treasury's key 30-year issue rose about $1.50 per $1,000 in
face amount. Its yield, which moves inversely to its price and is a
possible signal of other interest rate trends, declined to 8.83
percent from 8.85 percent late Thursday.
   Analysts noted that there was strong foreign demand for bonds
despite the upcoming long Independence Day weekend. Most traders
closed up shop at 3 p.m. EDT to get a jump on the three-day weekend.
   ``That demand, I would suspect, is being spurred by the strength
of the dollar,'' noted Mitchell Held, chief financial economist at
Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co.
   A stronger dollar attracts foreign capital and boosts bond
prices, while a weaker dollar discourages foreigners from investing
in the United States, incites higher inflation and erodes bond
prices.
   Lower oil prices also supported bond prices by removing the
specter of inflation, at least for the moment. The near-term
contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude oil,
settled below $15 a barrel, its lowest level in nearly two years.
   Bond traders ``may be looking a little more at the (oil)
markets,'' said William Sullivan, director of money-market research
at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   ``They have tended to ignore energy-related developments this
year because thoughts were dominated by the dollar, but oil's
downturn was so dramatic that it takes on a little more importance
to the interest rate market,'' he said.
   A Commerce Department report that construction spending rose 1.1
percent in May had little effect on trading.
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term
government issues rose 1-32 point to 1-16 point, intermediate
maturities rose 5-32 point to 3-16 point, and long-term issues
gained 3-16 point, according to figures provided by Telerate Inc.,
a financial information service.
   The movement of a point equals a $10 change in the price of a
bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Merrill Lynch Daily Treasury Index, which measures price
movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities of a
year or longer, rose 0.08 to 110.33. The Shearson Lehman Daily
Treasury Bond Index, which makes a similar measurement, rose 1.49
to 1,154.65.
   In corporate trading, industrials and utilities also rose.
Moody's Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures price
movements on 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years or
longer, rose 0.92 to 285.95.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills were unchanged at 6.55
percent. Six-month bills were off 2 basis points at 6.68 percent
and year bills fell 4 basis points to 6.99 percent. A basis point
is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, was quoted late in the day at 7~ percent, down from 8\
percent late Thursday.

   The dollar rose further Friday, strengthened by
pre-holiday buying and the lack of central bank intervention to
dampen the momentum of the U.S. currency's recent advances.
   Gold prices rose slightly in late U.S. trading after steadying
in Europe. Republic National Bank of New York quoted gold at
$437.25 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT, up from $435.10 at the same
time Thursday.
   Money brokers said there was a widespread view in
foreign-exchange markets that the dollar is heading higher for now
because the key industrialized democracies will tolerate the move.
But they said the advance will be slow and orderly, orchestrated
through occasional dollar-selling by central banks.
   Traders at a major Japanese bank in New York, who spoke on the
condition they not be identified, said they saw some significant
orders for dollars Friday from large security companies, further
bolstering the dollar's value.
   Some expressed short-term concern about possible intervention on
Monday by the Bank of Japan in the Tokyo market if the dollar rises
too sharply. But others disagreed.
   ``I don't think there's that much fear of intervention,'' said
James Chorek, currency analyst at Money Market Services in Chicago.
``If there was, you'd have seen it today.''
   In Tokyo, the dollar jumped 2.30 yen to close the week at 134.50
yen, its highest level since Nov. 27 when it closed at 134.75 yen.
Later in London, it was quoted at 134.05 yen. By the time trading
ended in New York, the dollar was worth 134.43 yen, higher than its
133.04 yen-level late Thursday.
   In London, the British pound slid to its lowest point against
the dollar this year, trading as low as $1.69. Late in the
afternoon it was quoted at $1.7023, the lowest level since Oct. 27,
and cheaper than $1.7085 Thursday. In New York, the pound fetched
$1.6960, cheaper than its $1.7115 level Thursday.
   Other late-dollar rates in New York, compared with late Thursday
included: 1.8203 West German marks, up from 1.8155; 1.5135 Swiss
francs, up from 1.5040; 1.2202 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2131;
6.1425 French francs, up from 6.1163; and 1,352.50 Italian lire, up
from 1,344.75.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Thursday:
1.8213 West German marks, up from 1.8170; 1.5130 Swiss francs, up
from 1.5060; 6.1375 French francs, up from 6.1250; 2.0530 Dutch
guilders, unchanged; 1,352.50 Italian lire, up from 1,350.38;
1.2190 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2126.
   Gold prices drifted in a narrow range Friday in Europe but rose
mildly in New York after a big midweek decline. On the Commodity
Exchange, gold for current delivery rose $1.90 a troy ounce to
$437.20.
   Earlier in London, gold closed at $437.50 a troy ounce,
unchanged from Thursday. In Zurich it rose, closing at $437.50 vs.
$436.50 late Thursday. In Hong Kong, gold rose 82 cents an ounce to
close at $440.
   Silver bullion prices rose on the London market, where the metal
was trading at $6.74 a troy ounce, compared with $6.66 Thursday. On
the New York Comex, silver for current delivery rose 2.5 cents an
ounce to $6.703.

<HEAD>Allis-Chalmers Files Reorganization Plan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MILWAUKEE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Financially troubled Allis-Chalmers Corp., once
a giant farm equipment manufacturer, on Friday filed a formal
reorganization plan that would formalize the sale its principal
businesses.
   The plan, the final step required to emerge from Chapter 11
bankruptcy protection, must be approved by U.S. Bankruptcy Court
for the Southern District of New York.
   The company, which sought protection from its creditors last
year, said in a statement that the sales of major assets would
raise between $400 million and $425 million, which would be
distributed to creditors.
   Allis-Chalmers already arranged for the sales of its assets.
Last week the company announced an agreement to sell its pump
business to International Telephone and Telegraph Corp. for $71
million.
   Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Wendell F. Bueche called
the agreement ``the final final agreement necessary to complete our
reorganization plan strategy for the sale or merger of our
principal businesses as going concerns.''
   In April Allis-Chalmers said it has agreed to sell its air
quality control business for $245 million to Snyder General Corp.
of Texas.
   The company estimated that, after the payment of priority claims
and secured debt, unsecured creditors will recover approximately 16
to 21 percent of their claims.
   The reorganized Allis-Chalmers would, under the plan, include an
office in West Allis, Wis., and two wholly-owned operating
subsidiaries. They are Houston Dynamic Service Inc., which operates
a machinery repair facility in Houston, Texas, and KILnGAS R&D,
Inc., which has four employees in its current development phase and
manages a coal gasification project at East Alton, Ill.
   Allis-Chalmers said that the plan was conditional, among other
things, on the closing of previously announced sales of the
company's air filter, pump and power generation services businesses.
   The company's existing common stock holders would receive no
cash distributions and approximately 20.6 percent of the
reorganized company's common stock.
   ``The company's goal is to have the plan consummated by year-end
1988,'' Bueche said.

<HEAD>Corn Futures Post Limit Gains; Oat Rally Called Over</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Corn prices soared the limit for daily trading Friday but oat
futures dropped sharply in what analysts said might be a signal of
the end of a record-breaking rally.
   Wheat and soybeans advanced strongly in other action on the
Chicago Board of Trade.
   On other markets, pork futures plunged the daily trading limit
while cattle futures were mixed; crude oil prices dropped below $15
a barrel; precious metals were slightly higher; and stock-index
futures retreated.
   Forecasts for a warm, dry July 4 weekend in the drought-stricken
Midwest underpinned gains in most grain and soybean markets.
   ``Corn was very strong and rumors of Russian buying were
rampant,'' said Victor Lespinasse, a trader for the investment firm
Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. He said the Soviets were believed to have
purchased 500,000 to 1 million metric tons of U.S. corn and an
unknown amount of Argentine corn.
   Most corn contracts advanced the 10-cents-a-bushel limit and the
limitless contract for July delivery rose even higher.
   Gains in the wheat and soybean pits, while substantial, were
slowed by Thursday's monthly grain stocks report from the
Agriculture Department, which showed larger-than-expected stocks of
corn, wheat and soybeans, Lespinasse said.
   But it was another story in the oat pit, where prices dropped
sharply on ideas that the drought-driven rally in that market was
over.
   Lespinasse cited rumors of oat imports from Argentina. Other
experts said the reality of yield losses had finally caught up with
the futures market.
   The U.S. oat crop, grown primarily in the northern Great Plains,
``is basically at maturity or close enough to maturity that very
little more damage is going to be done to it now than is already
known,'' said Walter Spilka, grain analyst with Smith Barney,
Harris Upham & Co. in New York.
   Oat futures prices, which hit a record $3.94 a bushel Thursday,
likely will slip as supply-and-demand factors replace
drought-damage fears, Spilka said.
   ``I think we've seen our highs for the year,'' said independent
oat trader Jay Homan.
   The full extent of damage to the corn crop probably will become
apparent next week as stunted plants pass through the critical
pollination stage and speculation will continue to drive the
soybean market for another month, he said.
   ``You've got reality (in the oat market), then you're a week
away from reality (for corn) and a month away from reality (for
soybeans) and that's how the market traded today,'' Homan said.
   The National Weather Service issued a 6-to-10-day forecast after
the close calling for hot, dry weather in most major growing areas
for the period July 7-11.
   Wheat settled 10{ cents to 15{ cents higher with the contract
for delivery in July at $4.00{ a bushel; corn was 9} cents to 15
cents higher with July at $3.42 a bushel; oats were 21 cents lower
to 3 cents higher with July at $3.32 a bushel; soybeans were 2
cents to 17{ cents higher with July at $9.88{ a bushel.
   As expected, pork futures plummeted their daily limits at the
opening on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and remained locked
limit-down all day in reaction to Thursday's surprising USDA report
showing larger-than-expected increases in both the U.S. hog herd
and the breeding intentions of hog producers.
   Live cattle were unchanged to .95 cent higher with August at
64.60 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .60 cent lower to .42 cent
higher with August at 73.67 cents a pound; hogs were 1.50 cents
lower across the board with July at 44.82 cents a pound; frozen
pork bellies were 2 cents lower across the board with July at 35.25
cents a pound.
   Crude oil prices slumped below $15 a barrel to their lowest
levels in almost two years after fluctuating wildly on the New York
Mercantile Exchange.
   Analysts were divided on the reasons for the drop. Some cited
technical factors while others pegged the drop to Saudi Arabia's
desire to see lower oil prices.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 18 cents to 22 cents
lower with August at $14.94 a barrel; heating oil was .03 cent to
.10 cent lower with August at 41.02 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .39 cent lower to .29 cent higher with August at 48.35
cents a gallon.
   Precious metals futures advanced slightly in light, choppy
trading on the Commodity Exchange in New York.
   Gold was $1.90 to $2 higher with August at $439.60 a troy ounce;
silver was .40 cent lower to 2.5 cents higher with July at $6.703 a
troy ounce.
   Stock-index futures retreated on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, where the contract for September delivery of the Standard
& Poor's 500 index finished 2.5 points lower at 272.90.

<HEAD>CSX Loses $160 Million In 2nd Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   CSX Corp. on Friday reported a
second-quarter loss of $160 million mainly because of a $778
million special charge that will in part cover severance payments
to laid-off employees.
   Excluding the charge, second quarter earnings would have been
$332 million, or $2.12 per share. In the year-ago quarter, the
transportation, energy and technology conglomerate earned $114
million, or 74 cents a share.
   Of the special charge, $592 million will be used for costs
related to reducing the rail labor force to about 30,000 employees.
   About 8,200 employees will receive payments ranging from $30,000
to $50,000, except for locomotive enginemen who are covered under
an existing program that calls for payments of $75,000.
   The remaining $186 million of the special charge covers various
costs and claims pending against CSX and certain subsidiaries.
Those costs are expected to result from litigation and negotiated
settlements.
   CSX President and Chief Operating Officer John W. Snow said the
employee reduction program is part of CSX Transportation's effort
to match the number of rail employees with the operating
requirements of the rail system. CSX Transportation is a subsidiary
of CSX Corp.
   Snow said CSX Corp., since its formation in 1980, has reduced
the physical base of CSX Transportation from 26,748 route miles,
3,343 locomotives and 175,281 freight cars at year-end 1981 to
21,494 route miles, 2,633 locomotives and 116,063 freight cars at
year-end 1987.
   For the first six months of 1988, CSX lost $95 million, compared
with earnings of $199 million, or $1.29 per share for the first
half of 1987.
   Without the special charge, first half earnings would have been
$397 million, or $2.52 per share.

<HEAD>Oil Prices Fall; Construction Spending Rises</HEAD>

   Crude oil prices have fallen to their lowest levels in almost
two years, a development that helped cool inflation concerns and
lift bond prices.
   The contract for August delivery of West Texas Intermediate, the
benchmark U.S. crude oil, plunged 22 cents per 42-gallon barrel
Friday, piercing the $15 level to settle at $14.94 on the New York
Mercantile Exchange.
   Along with the fall in oil, bond prices were boosted modestly by
a stronger dollar and fresh foreign demand. The yield of the
Treasury's key 30-year bond, which falls when prices rise, dipped
to 8.83 percent from 8.85 percent late Thursday.
   In other economic news, construction of offices and factories
increased strongly in May, the government said Friday in a report
that indicated healthy economic growth.
   On Wall Street, stock prices fell and the Dow Jones average of
30 industrials dropped 10.13 points to 2,131.58, closing out the
week with a net loss of 11.38 points.
   Overall construction spending advanced 1.1 percent in May, the
Commerce Department said. The increase was led by a 7.8 percent
advance in office construction and a 7.7 percent advance in factory
construction.
   In contrast, residential construction fell 1 percent.
   The big jump in factory construction reflected the capital
spending boom occurring as manufacturers rush to expand capacity to
meet sharply higher demand for U.S. exports.
   Analysts said the rise in office construction, after a sustained
period of weakness, reflected strong activity in certain sections
of the country such as the Northeast and a halt to the giant plunge
in building which had occurred in the Southwest, hard hit because
of troubles in the oil patch.
   ``Cities such as Chicago, New York, Boston and Washington, D.C.,
are enjoying good economic growth and a fair amount of offfice
construction,'' said Richard Peach, senior economist for the
Mortgage Bankers Association. ``This is happening while the sharp
declines in other areas have at least bottomed out.''

   Crude oil prices plunged through the
psychologically important $15-a-barrel level to their lowest price
in almost two years during a chaotic trading session.
   The contract for August delivery of West Texas Intermediate, the
benchmark U.S. crude oil, plunged 22 cents a barrel on Friday to
settle at $14.94 on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   Crude prices have not finished as low since Dec. 10, 1986, when
the near-term contract closed at $14.92 per 42-gallon barrel.
   The price on near-term contracts has dropped from $16.83 a
barrel since the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
agreed on June 14 to extend its previous production quotas, which
have not prevented an oversupply of crude oil.
   Prices of refined products traded on the exchange were mixed
Friday. The July contract for home heating oil edged down 0.06 cent
to 41.02 cents a gallon. The July contract for unleaded gasoline
settled at 48.35 cents, up 0.29 cent from Thursday's session.
   Traders noted that the chaotic activity was unusual for what
typically is a subdued session ahead of the long Independence Day
weekend.
   Crude prices fluctuated in a wide range, trading up to $15.44 a
barrel early in the session before dropping below $15 after noon.
   The lower prices were met with strong buying from investors on
the sidelines. ``There's good buying around here,'' said Madison
Galbraith, a trader at Merrill Lynch Energy Futures. ``The sellers
are the ones who are hurting.''
   Analysts were divided over the reason for the selloff. Some said
that consistently lower oil prices finally convinced investors it
was time to swallow their losses and sell off contracts that were
purchased at higher prices.
   ``They're having to cut their hurt,'' Galbraith said. ``Those
who bought above $16 a barrell ... are trying to get out.''
   But others suggested some of the selling might have been
undertaken on behalf of Saudi Arabia, which hoped lower prices
would choke off oil revenue for Iran, removing a financing tool in
Iran's 7-year-old war with Iraq.
   Lower oil prices could cut off ``the supplies of money to Iran
and bring the war machine to a grinding halt,'' said Peter Beutel,
an assistant director at Elders Futures Inc.
   In addition, some speculated the Saudis would rather lower
prices than see U.S. oil companies explore for oil.
   The decline came on the heels of a sharp drop in the previous
session.
   On Thursday, the near-term contract of West Texas Intermediate
fell 27 cents to finish at its lowest level since Dec. 21, 1987.
The drop came amid fears of a possible price war after Egypt
announced it would cut the price on its crude oil exports for the
first half of July.

   General Motors Corp.'s Chevrolet, Buick, Pontiac
and Oldsmobile divisions Friday extended through Sept. 28 buyer
incentive campaigns that were to expire on Tuesday.
   Many of the Chevrolet rebates will be leaner, but Buick rebates
will continue unchanged except for the LeSabre, which was dropped
from the program, a spokeswoman said.
   Chevrolet also dropped its double rebate on the Nova and
Spectrum subcompacts, said spokeswoman Mary McElyea. As intended,
the program increased the number of import owners who shopped at
Chevrolet dealerships, but irritated some domestic-car owners.
   Chevrolet trimmed rebates by $100 to $400 on Beretta and $300 on
Corsica and the Cavalier two-door model and by $250 on Camaro, to
$500. Rebates increased by $100 to $500 on Cavalier four-door and
wagon and $60 on Nova and Spectrum.
   Chevrolet also added the Sprint to the program, with a $300
rebate, McElyea said.
   Rebates on Chevrolet trucks remain unchanged and range from $300
on the S-10 pickup EL model to $750 on the four-wheel-drive S-10
Blazer.
   Buick rebates range from $1,000 on Electra-Park Avenue to $400
on Skylark. Buick also added a range of option-package discounts.
   Meanwhile, Oldsmobile's rebates included $1,000 on the
Oldsmobile Ninety-Eight; $500 on Cutlass Ciera; $400 on Cutlass
Calais, and free air conditioning on the Cutlass Supreme and
Supreme SL.
   Pontiac said its rebates range from $600 on the Fiero to $250 on
the Sunbird.
