<HEAD>Delegates Say Time Has Come For Bush To Sharpen Fuzzy Image</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   George Bush must sharpen a personal image
that has grown fuzzy over the last eight years and show Democrat
Michael Dukakis for the liberal he is if the GOP is to win the
presidency, say delegates to the Republican National Convention.
   ``His image was fairly sharp with the American people eight
years ago,'' said Rep. Carlos J. Moorhead of California. ``As vice
president, he's had to step out of the limelight, but when he comes
back into the spotlight, his independent image will become clear
again.''
   Oregon state Treasurer Anthony Meeker said Bush has suffered an
image problem ``because he has been No. 2. As soon as he can
transcend that, an image transplant will have occurred.''
   Many delegates believe Bush's major opportunity to strengthen
his image will come tonight when he delivers his acceptance speech
to the convention.
   ``People are telling him to be himself, but you know sometimes
you can try too hard,'' said Rep. John P. Hiler of Indiana. ``If
he's just relaxed and tries to deliver the kind of acceptance
speech George Bush can deliver and he does a good job, I think
you'll be surprised by how quickly George Bush starts to pick up
momentum.''
   Barry McCarty, a North Carolina delegate, said Bush ``needs to
take off the gloves.''
   ``The Democrats have done everything they could to cover up what
Mr. Dukakis is _ a rabid liberal. Bush has to pull that mask off,''
McCarty said.
   Colorado delegate Syl Morgan-Smith said Bush ``has got to frame
his campaign around his record, and tell the truth about the
Dukakis record.''
   ``He's got to get to the point, tell the truth, and he's got to
come out of the chutes raising hell,'' she said.
   Others warn Bush against trying to be someone he's not.
   Alan ``Punch'' Green, Bush's Oregon campaign chairman, said he
advised the vice president to ``stay the way you are. Every time
you try to change it, it comes out phony.''
   Added Ken Chlouber, a miner and state legislator Colorado: ``You
can't Reaganize George Bush. He's going to have to plow his own
ground.''
   Delegates believe that once the vice president outlines his
agenda and goes after the Democrats, he will surge ahead of Dukakis
in the polls.
   Surveys taken immediately after the Democratic National
Convention last month showed Dukakis enjoying the traditional
post-convention bounce, and leading in some surveys by 17 or 18
percentage points. But Bush narrowed that double-digit lead to an
almost dead heat as the Republican convention neared.
   House Minority Leader Bob Michel of Illinois said the GOP
convention was orchestrated ``with the hope of the vice president
improving his lot by 10 points. I think we've accomplished some of
that.''
   ``I saw some polls last week that showed the race was narrowing.
... The Democratic convention is wearing off and George Bush will
benefit from our convention,'' said Iowa Sen. Charles Grassley.
   J.E. Brown, a state representatives from Texas, likened the
convention attention to ``volleyball at the Olympics.''
   ``Nobody's ever seen it _ then it's on TV for five days and the
next thing you know, everybody you call and ask what they're doing
... they're going to play volleyball.''
   A Bush surge in the polls may not be enough. Historically, no
candidate since President Truman has won the presidency after
trailing in the polls prior to the convention.
   History professor and Georgia Rep. Newt Gingrich is unfazed by
that information.
   ``We're a party that twice nominated a man who made movies with
chimpanzees. Why do you think that we would worry about historical
precedents,'' he said.

   George Bush tapped Sen. Dan Quayle as his
running mate in hopes of turning baby boomers into GOP boosters,
but analysts say younger Americans may prove too diverse for the
overture to pay off.
   Although the roughly 75 million Americans born between 1946 and
1965 shared such formative experiences as Vietnam and Watergate,
there is no evidence that such generational links create a voting
bloc, pollsters note.
   ``They cross all income, occupational and ideological lines,''
pollster Peter Hart said Wednesday.
   Bush and his strategists portrayed the selection of Quayle, 41,
as a daring bid for the loyalties of the younger generation, noting
that he is the first baby boomer on a major-party ticket for
national office.
   Campaign chief James A. Baker III called it ``a bold stroke,''
and Bush said: ``Do I need help in this area? Sure. And have I
gotten it by the selection of a young, experienced United States
senator? I think so.''
   Pollsters say, however, that some of the values shared by
younger Americans just don't mesh with Quayle's beliefs.
   ``Quayle fits on the economic stuff pretty well'' as a proponent
of deregulation, entrepreneurship and low taxes, said public policy
researcher Edward H. Crane, president of the Cato Institute in
Washington.
   But Crane, whose nonpartisan group has been a leader in
analyzing the baby-boom generation, said Quayle's foreign policy
views are more hawkish and his social views more conservative than
those of many baby boomers.
   ``He doesn't have that combination of views that I would argue
is unique to baby boomers,'' Crane said. ``So he won't be able to
appeal to a large group of them.''
   Young Americans are the least reliable voters, and Republican
pollster Neil Newhouse said Quayle may be able to improve turnout
among the one-third of baby boomers who already identify with the
Republican Party. He said the next step, drawing new adherents, was
possible even if difficult.
   ``Will it encourage younger Democrats, younger independents, to
cross party lines for a candidate of their generation? Who knows?''
he said. ``But there's a shot at that happening.''
   There are some openings for Quayle. Hart, a Democratic pollster
who studied the baby-boom generation for Rolling Stone magazine,
said that younger adults could find it easier to relate to him ``at
least in terms of appearance and metaphor.''
   And Newhouse noted that baby boomers are less strongly committed
to either political party than are older Americans.
   ``It goes beyond whether you are liberal or moderate or
conservative to what kind of concerns you have,'' Newhouse said.
``If he can demonstrate shared concerns over the things the
baby-boom generation is concerned about'' _ such as day care and
education _ ``then he can have a tremendous impact.''
   Another Republican pollster, Linda DiVall, also said Quayle's
candidacy could have an impact, so long as it was not overstated,
simply through the message his selection sent to younger voters.
   ``I don't think anyone is saying that Dan Quayle single-handedly
is going to deliver the baby-boom generation,'' she said. ``But I
think it's the first time that either of the major parties has made
an absolute gesture of basically passing the torch a couple of
generations and saying, `This is the future leader of our party,
this is the way we're going to go.'''

   Vice President George Bush
apparently is losing no time taking President Reagan up on his
offer to march as a ``foot soldier'' in the Bush campaign for the
presidency.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Wednesday that a
joint appearance with Bush has been penciled in as a ``possible
political event'' on the president's schedule while he is in Los
Angeles next week.
   Fitzwater said Reagan, vacationing at his ranch north of here,
planned to watch on television Wednesday night as Bush formally
became the GOP nominee for president.
   He said the Reagan-Bush appearance next week was planned for
Wednesday, a day when the president had not scheduled any public
appearances. He did not know whether the event would be a
fund-raiser, a rally, or something else.
   The event would be the third joint Reagan-Bush appearance in
less than two weeks.
   Last Friday, in their first political duet since the president
endorsed Bush at a Washington fund-raising dinner May 11, they
appeared before a group of Reagan political appointees whom Bush
described as ``the field commanders of the Reagan revolution.'' The
president predicted, ``We are going to hold the White House with
George Bush.''
   On Monday night, addressing the Republican National Convention
in New Orleans, Reagan reversed Bush's ``field commanders''
metaphor and promised that ``I'll leave my phone number and address
behind just in case you need a foot soldier.''
   Bush was watching the president's speech on television at the
vice president's residence in Washington.
   On Tuesday morning, the two got together at Belle Chasse Naval
Air Station near New Orleans as Bush arrived and Reagan departed
for three weeks of vacationing and political fund-raising in
California.
   ``Nancy and I want you to know that you have all our support all
the way,'' he told Bush. The vice president then took Reagan aside
and told him privately of his choice of Sen. Dan Quayle of Indiana
as his running mate.
   Reagan telephoned Quayle from the ranch Tuesday night to
congratulate him, Fitzwater said.
   The presidential spokesman said he did not think the second-term
senator would be handicapped by his relative youth and inexperience.
   ``He's a young man, but he has accomplished a lot in his 41
years,'' Fitzwater said.
   He recalled that Quayle was one of those who recommended that
Reagan veto the Pentagon spending bill that Defense Secretary Frank
C. Carlucci and other advisers had urged him to sign. In vetoing
the measure, Reagan argued that it would cripple his ``Star Wars''
system of space-based missile defense, among other things.
   Fitzwater quoted Quayle as telling the president, ``We can paint
our opposition in gray, or we can paint them in bold colors.''
   ``The president chose to go with the bold colors, and I think
this is a bold selection,'' the spokesman said.
   The tentative Bush-Reagan appearance next week would be
sandwiched between previously announced fund-raisers for Sen. Pete
Wilson in Irvine on Tuesday and for the California Republican Party
in Thousand Oaks and Rep. Robert Lagomarsino in Santa Barbara on
Aug. 27. Lagomarsino is the president's congressman. Reagan votes
in Solvang, Calif.

   The presidential election will give Americans
a choice of wealthy candidates: two millionaires and two men who
stand to benefit from large inheritances.
   Three of the four were born into wealth: Vice President George
Bush, the newly named the GOP standard-bearer; Dan Quayle, whom
Bush named as his running mate Tuesday, and Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, the
Democratic vice presidential nominee.
   Quayle and Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis both
are in high income brackets, but both their bank accounts do not
yet contain the funds from million-dollar-plus inheritances of
which they are beneficiaries.
   Besides being born rich, both Bush and Bentsen became
millionaires through their own business ventures.
   Bush was born to privilege in Connecticut, the son of a wealthy
investment banker and U.S. senator. He grew up with maids, cooks
and a chauffeur, before going off to elite Yale University. Staked
by his family, he went to Texas to make his own fortune in the oil
business, ultimately entering politics.
   On his tax returns last year, Bush reported total income of more
than $300,000, including income from the blind trust that was set
up when he became vice president. His wealth has been estimated at
upwards of $2 million.
   Bentsen's father was a self-made land baron in the Rio Grande
Valley of Texas, and Bentsen earned his own wealth through business
dealings in Houston between his service in the House and his return
to Washington as a senator.
   Bentsen's exact worth is unknown, but a source close the senator
would not argue with estimates that it exceeds $10 million. ``I
don't know what my net worth is,'' Bentsen said Wednesday.
``Frankly, I haven't made out a financial statement that has given
me my net worth in a number of years.''
   Dukakis, noted for his frugality, has a net worth of at least
$500,000 in property, investments and salary.
   Dukakis is beneficiary of two trust funds valued at $1 million
each that were set up by his late father, Panos, a Greek immigrant
who was a physician. Half the proceeds, however, go to his father's
alma mater, Bates College in Maine.
   Quayle is the scion of the privately-owned Central Newspapers
Inc., an Indianapolis headquartered publishing empire whose
holdings include the Indianapolis Star and the Arizona Republic.
Quayle is an heir to the portion of the company that is not held in
trust.
   In addition, on his personal financial disclosure statement in
Congress, he listed stock in Central Newspapers valued at more than
$250,000. The exact figure is not required on the financial
disclosure forms.
   Besides the stock in Central Newspapers, Quayle listed two
retirement accounts totaling up to $65,000, and his wife's stock in
Central Newspapers valued at between $100,000 and $250,000.
   Quayle promised Wednesday that a full financial disclosure would
be forthcoming and said his worth is less than the $200 million
reported in a news account.
   He also joked that reports of his wealth have ``caused me a lot
of problems at home because my wife has asked me about that.''
   Except for Quayle, all the candidates have released their
personal income tax returns. Bentsen released his on Wednesday,
along with records on his holdings in a blind trust.
   The opening of the blind trust, prompted by Bentsen's race as
Dukakis' running mate, shows interests in mineral leases and land,
and ownership of mutual funds and of common stock in more than a
dozen well-known companies such as Chevron, Boeing, Exxon, Johnson
& Johnson and Unisys.
   The records showed his gross earnings averaging $772,181 over
the past five years, including a high of $1 million in 1983.
   They also showed he has assets ranging from $5.1 million to more
than $7.9 million.

<HEAD>`Last Temptation' Opens In Eight More Theaters</HEAD>
<DATELINE>UNIVERSAL CITY, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Universal Pictures has added eight
theaters for showing the ``The Last Temptation of Christ,'' which
set box office records last weekend amid protests from Christian
groups.
   A spokesman for Universal said each theater will be in a
different city and they will bring to 17 the number of screens
showing the movie.
   The openings were expected by this weekend in Detroit; Austin,
Texas; Houston; Santa Ana, Calif.; San Diego; Phoenix, Ariz.;
Tucson, Ariz.; and Philadelphia.
   Last weekend, the movie played to sold-out crowds in seven U.S.
cities and two in Canada, earning $401,211, a $44,579 per-screen
average.
   Five of the theaters taking on ``The Last Temptation of Christ''
for this weekend are owned by American Multi-Cinema. Previously,
movie chains such as General Cinema Theaters, Edwards Cinemas and
Luxury Theaters all said they would not show the film.
   Last week, an estimated crowd of 25,000 protesters gathered
outside Universal Studios to protest the film, based on a novel of
the same name by Nikos Kazantzakis and directed by Martin Scorsese.
Demonstrators also marched and handed out leaflets to moviegoers at
theaters showing the film.
   The protesters consider the movie sacrilegious, particularly a
scene in which Jesus on the cross hallucinates abandonment of his
role as redemeer, makes love to Mary Magdalene and raises a family
with her.
   Scorsese on Wednesday bought a full-page advertisement in the
trade paper Daily Variety. The open letter expressed thanks to MCA
Chairman Lew Wasserman and other executives of MCA Inc., parent
company of Universal, and to Garth Drabinsky, chairman of Cineplex
Odeon, which co-distributed the film with Universal.
   ``Without your help, `The Last Temptation of Christ' could never
have been made, nor could it have been released,'' Scorsese wrote.
   In Texas, 50 members of the Richardson Unitarian Universalist
Church signed a petition asking Universal Pictures to show the
movie in the Dallas area.
   ``So far, everybody's been boycotting, picketing and trying to
ban it without having seen it,'' said Rev. Dick Nelson. ``We're
just saying, `Let's have it here so if people want to see it they
can go see it,'' Nelson said.
   The petition was signed by church members on Sunday.

   It's hot. Miserably hot. And a record-busting
sizzling spell has the country in a sweaty summertime lather.
   International Falls, Minn., known as the ``Icebox of the
Nation'' for its subzero winter temperatures, tied an all-time
record with an oven-like 98-degree reading July 6. It had 90-plus
readings 14 times so far.
   Harvard University shut down because of heat for the first time
in its 335-year history. New York City streets melted into goo.
Cranky inmates set fire to a 144-year-old granite jail in Lawrence,
Mass. Fires burned near Old Faithful in Yellowstone National Park
and Mount Rushmore. And about the only thing brisk were sales of
pools and air conditioners.
   ``It's been a long summer,'' said heat-weary meteorologist Ed
O'Lenic of the National Weather Service. ``You basically have to
tell people bad news day after day. It gets old after a while.''
   Relief won't come soon enough. For most of the nation,
forecasters predict two to three more weeks of above normal
temperatures and below normal rain, with only an occasional break.
   The Miserable Summer of '88 and its triple whammy of heat, haze
and humidity began with a late spring high pressure system over the
Great Plains that blocked the jet stream from delivering cooler,
cleaner air from Canada and hobbled the production of thunderstorms.
   ``It's like being in a tropical rain forest,'' said Anthony Gigi
of the National Weather Service in steamy, sticky New York.
   Michigan autoworkers, chafed by 100-degree temperatures, staged
wildcat strikes at two Chrysler Corp. plants to escape factories
that felt like blowtorches. Chrysler responded with extra fans,
ice, soda pop and optional four-hour shifts.
   ``It's murder,'' said Fred O'Brien, recording secretary of
United Auto Workers Local 1264. ``We have enough fans to lift the
roof, but they just blow hot air.''
   There should be less hot air inside the Wisconsin state Capitol.
Gov. Tommy G. Thompson reversed himself on a veto and gave the
go-ahead for air conditioning to be installed inside the
70-year-old building in Madison.
   In New York City, where things crackle at a feverish pace year
round, people are more gruff than normal as eight records were
broken or tied and the temperature reached 90 or above 32
oppressive times by Tuesday.
   ``Everybody's nerves are totally frayed,'' said Robert Louden, a
former cop and hostage negotiator who teaches a security course at
John Jay College.
   ``There's a shorter wick. It takes less to set off the
firecracker. I notice a lot more horn-blaring. Things seem to
provoke people who don't have a good handle on their own aggression
and anxiety,'' Louden said. ``It's a chore just to walk. You want
to be left alone.''
   Albert Mehrabian, professor of psychology at the University of
California at Los Angeles, said the combination of unbearable heat
and the squalor of the inner city ``can result in anger,
frustration, anxiety and aggression.''
   Adding to New Yorkers' woes, dozens of beaches have been closed
by medical waste washing ashore. Heavy power demand has caused
electrical shortages. A combination of heat above and leaky steam
pipes underneath literally melts asphalt, forming bumps on streets.
And a fourfold increase in the region's mosquito population is
blamed on a dry June, rainy July and a humid August.
   ``It's really rough out there,'' said John Lockett, 65, who has
been shining shoes outside Grand Central Terminal for 27 years.
``People are wiping the sweat off their brows and they're not
smiling. Nobody's smiling.''
   Death and injury have accompanied the fiery heat.
   Two New York men, both in their 20s, died of heat stroke
following separate foot races.
   The number of broken necks has increased in Chicago and
Milwaukee, both of which have shattered records for most days above
100 degrees. The injuries occur when people dive into shallow
water, doctors said.
   And heat-warped rails were blamed for an Amtrak train crash that
injured 165 people and spewed wreckage over the Montana plains near
Saco.
   The homeless, whose misery usually is worst in winter, were
allowed to stay in air conditioned shelters in Atlantic City, N.J.,
and other cities. In Chicago, social workers set up tanks of ice
water on the sidewalks, but somebody stole the tanks, authorities
said.
   Meteorologists say there is no proven connection between the
Miserable Summer of '88 and the greenhouse effect, a canopy of
gases in the earth's atmosphere that some scientists say will trap
heat and push temperatures higher over time.
   But others are not so sure.
   ``It's a signal we're getting things out of balance. Something
is not right in this picture,'' said Irvin Mintzer of the World
Resources Institute in Washington, D.C.

<HEAD>Zia Was Longest Serving Pakistani President</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in Thursday AMs report.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Mohammed Zia ul-Haq was a
dictator who blended firmness with political shrewdness in a
formula that kept him in power 11 years, longer than anyone else in
Pakistan's 41-year history.
   Zia imposed martial law and executed the man he overthrew, but
did not instill the fear of prison and midnight knocks on the door.
   He was a zealous Moslem who stamped Islamic law on his nation,
but did not enforce such cruel punishments as amputation for theft
and stoning to death for adultery.
   A Western diplomat said a few years ago: ``Zia is something of a
paradox. By and large he's had an unfavorable press in the West,
but he's not nearly as bad as people make out.''
   Zia, 64, died Wednesday when his military plane exploded after
taking off from Bahawalpur, 330 miles south of Islamabad.
   He was a strong ally of the United States, and his regime was
helped by international politics and luck. Soviet military
intervention in Afghanistan in 1979 led to more Western aid, and
good harvests produced more food in the early 1980s.
   Recently, however, he has had difficulty with the unprecedented
opposition generated by Benazir Bhutto, the daughter of the prime
minister he overthrew, and other political leaders.
   Zia called himself a ``reluctant ruler'' in an interview with
the Los Angeles Times earlier this month, but added: ``I am not a
person to just give up in disgust and walk away. I am determined to
stay here until I solve all of the many problems that continue to
face our country.''
   The man whose surname means ``Light of God'' was a career
military officer and had spent 30 years in the army before Prime
Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto made him a full general and army chief
of staff on March 1, 1977.
   Zia banned alcohol in officers' messes and tried to instill the
Islamic principles of Imam (faith), Taqwa (abstinence) and Jihad
(readiness for holy war).
   Some military colleagues called him ``Bhutto's butler'' because
of the deference he showed the prime minister, so they were
surprised when he seized power in a bloodless coup July 5, 1977.
   Other observers, who had described Zia as ``dumb like a fox,''
were not surprised.
   Once in charge, Zia arrested the Cabinet and proclaimed martial
law. He had Bhutto tried later that year for conspiracy to murder a
political opponent, who was not killed, three years earlier.
   Bhutto was hanged in 1979, and his daughter, Benazir, has became
Zia's main political opponent.
   At first Zia had deferred to Bhutto and expressed hope that the
former prime minister would compete in elections scheduled for
October 1977.
   After studying secret documents on Bhutto's years in power,
however, he called his predecessor an ``evil genius'' who had run
the country ``on more or less Gestapo lines, misusing funds,
blackmailing people, detaining them illegally and even, perhaps,
ordering people killed.'' The trial ensued in September and Zia
canceled the elections.
   Last month, after announcing that ``free, fair and impartial''
national elections would be held in November, he made election
rules that hobbled the opposition.
   Zia kept up his nation's military strength to guard the borders
with India, with which Pakistan has fought three wars since
partition and independence from Britain in 1947.
   He supported Moslem guerrillas fighting the Soviet-backed
communist government in neighboring Afghanistan. After the Soviet
troop withdrawal from Afghanistan began May 15, the Kremlin accused
him of continuing to funnel arms to the insurgents.
   Mass arrests and floggings occurred even after Zia lifted
martial law and his public image was stern, but acquaintances said
he was warm in private and aides report many instances of kindess.
   According to one story, ``He was on a trip through the interior
when he heard about a village boy who was sick. He directed the
local authorities to get the child examined at state expense or
flown to another country if the proper treatment was not available
in Pakistan.''
   Zia resisted a cult of personality and did not permit his
portrait to hang in government offices or public places, unlike
previous military leaders in Pakistan. He was married with five
children.
   The general was the first head of state to use the national
language Urdu at all state functions, instead of English, and
encouraged officials to wear national dress.
   He was born into a middle-class family Aug. 12, 1924, at
Jallunder in what now is the Indian state of Punjab, and became a
devout Moslem in his youth.
   In June of this year, he issued a presidential decree making
Islamic law supreme, thus bringing much of Pakistani life under the
supervision of Islamic scholars and priests.
   ``His great passion in life is Islam,'' a close aide said.
   One acquaintance of Zia said: ``During his prayers, he forgets
everything worldly. He forgets his status as a general and head of
state, and even as a father and a husband. I have seen him crying
like a baby at the Prophet's tomb at Medina.''
   Several Pakistani and Western analysts said Zia believed running
the country was destiny, not duty, and in 1983 he declared: ``It's
not important what people say about you now, but what history
remembers after you've gone.''

   A Dutch hot air balloon took a
record number of 50 people to the skies and landed safely after a
20-minute flight, its captain said.
   Balloonist Henk Brink, his wife Eveline, four crewmen and 44
passengers on Wednesday improved the 1979 record set by Cristopher
Davey of Great Britain, who took off with 31 other people near
Muenster, West Germany.
   ``Everybody enjoyed it immensely,'' Brink told The Associated
Press shortly after touching down smoothly in a field a few miles
from the airfield where he had alighted.
   Brink's 151-foot-high balloon, carrying a twin-level passenger
basket and six propane burners, made the flight at an altitude of
330 feet.
   In 1986, Brink set a speed record for crossing the Atlantic by
balloon, completing the trip from Newfoundland to the Netherlands
in 51 hours and 15 minutes.

   President Samuel K. Doe has banned the
national student union and ordered an end to all campus politics
because of what he called ``disobedience to constituted authority.''
   The order Wednesday also authorized heads of all public and
private schools to dismiss students for any misconduct, agitation
or engaging in campus politics.
   Doe said he was concerned by ``the increase of vandalism and
destruction of properties on school campuses, as well as students'
disobedience to constituted authority.''
   Students at C.H. Dewey High School, 30 miles from the capital,
Monrovia, recently set the school on fire, causing damages
estimated at more than $10,000. Doe banned Dewey High School
students from enrolling in any other school until theirs is
reconstructed.
   The Liberian National Students Union was founded in 1959 to
unite university and high school students.

<HEAD>City Using Loitering Arrests To Crack Down on Drugs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TACOMA, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The City Council has given police
permission to arrest convicted drug dealers and illegal users for
loitering in parts of the city known to be drug hangouts.
   The council approved the ordinance on Tuesday and declared that
the drug problem was an emergency, requiring that a 10-day comment
period for new ordinances be waived.
   ``We have a grave emergency, and we need these emergency
measures,'' said Councilman Tom Stenger just before the 6-0 council
vote.
   Under the ordinance, 40 police officers specially trained to
recognize tactics of drug sellers will start cruising the city
Thursday, said Mark Mann, a police department spokesman.
   The ordinance permits police to arrest people who:
   _Show physical characteristics of drug intoxication or use, such
as needle marks.
   _Possess drug paraphernalia.
   _Were ordered by a judge to stay away from particular areas of
the city.
   _Are physically identified by police as a member of a gang known
to deal drugs.
   _Transfer small objects or packages for currency in a furtive
fashion.
   _Run when police appear.
   _Attempt to conceal themselves or an object that police believe
is related to a drug deal or behave in any manner that police
believe looks like drug-deal behavior.
   Councilman Jack Warnick cautioned police about violating
people's civil rights, saying, ``we're giving the police
extraordinary powers and hope they will be extraordinarily careful
in their use of those powers.''
   Kathleen Taylor, executive director of the American Civil
Liberties Union of Washington, said from Seattle that based on
accounts she had read of the measure, ``I think there are some
serious civil liberties problems with the ordinance, and we're
going to look into them further.
   ``Specifically, there are problems with the loitering
sections,'' she said. ``They're going to arrest people for merely
being in a certain location. People who have already served time
(for drugs) aren't supposed to carry the burden with them. They
would be the target for special treatment.
   ``People may be arrested for hanging out in their own
neighborhood. The breadth of the ordinance is very likely to cause
people not at all engaged in illegal activity to get caught up in
some sort of police action.''

   Here, at a glance, are highlights of the
third day of the Republican National Convention:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>THE NOMINATION</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   George Bush won the Republican presidential nomination in a
ceremonial roll call of the states. His adopted state of Texas put
him over the top.
   Bush promised that he and newly minted running mate Dan Quayle
would work like a ``couple of pit bulls'' to whip the Democrats
this fall.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>BUSH</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Bush made the convention a family affair, and he and his wife,
Barbara, were surrounded by their grandchildren as the Republican
National Convention awarded him the party's presidential nomination.
   Their five children were delegates.
   Bush toured the Superdome earlier Wednesday, checking out the
podium and the TelePrompTer he will use Thursday when he accepts
the nomination.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>GRAMM</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Phil Gramm lauded George Bush as ``the greatest vice
president this nation has ever had'' as he placed Bush's name in
nomination.
   Gramm, the Texan best known for the budget-cutting plan that
bears his name, described Bush as a certifiable war hero committed
to a strong defense. On the other hand, he said, Michael Dukakis
would ``wimp America and endanger peace.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>QUAYLE</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Quayle, at a joint news conference with Bush, was bombarded with
questions about his wealth, his military record and his private
life.
   He refused to divulge details of a 1980 Florida vacation with
Washington lobbyist Paula Parkinson. And he dismissed as ``a cheap
shot'' any suggestions that he joined the National Guard in 1969 in
order to avoid going to Vietnam.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>ALSO-RANS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Bush campaign aides revealed that the vice president had
considered 12 people for a running mate.
   They were Sen. Bob Dole and his wife, former Transportation
Secretary Elizabeth Dole; New Hampshire Gov. John Sununu,
California Gov. George Deukmejian, South Carolina Gov. Carroll
Campbell, Gov. Jim Thompson of Illinois, Sens. John Danforth of
Missouri, Alan Simpson of Wyoming and Pete Domenici of New Mexico
and Nancy Kassebaum of Kansas; Rep. Jack Kemp, Attorney General
Richard Thornburgh.

<TEXT>
   Delegates to the convention say Bush should step out from
President Reagan's shadow and ``come out of the chutes raising
hell'' to capture the White House.
   Some delegates believe Bush must sharpen his image to succeed,
with the advice ranging from declaring his independence from
President Reagan to using fewer hand gestures, wearing horn-rimmed
glasses and standing straight. Others prefer that Bush ignore the
suggestions and be himself.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>DOLE</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Bob Dole, joining ranks with George Bush after being
bypassed as a running mate, told the convention that Michael
Dukakis is one of those ``liberal doom-sayers who believe that
America cannot be trusted.''
   Dole repeatedly dubbed Dukakis ``the Massachusetts liberal'' and
said he was unprepared to deal realistically with foreign policy
challenges. ``He is one of those liberals who is uncomfortable when
America stands on the side of freedom,'' Dole said.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>BENNETT</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of Education William J. Bennett said Democratic
leaders are embarrassed by efforts to teach schoolchildren values
and the pledge of allegiance.
   Bennett, in a brief address to the Republican National
Convention, said the Reagan administration has sparked controversy
by calling for teaching school children moral values and the
Judeo-Christian tradition. But ``there are some fights worth
having,'' added Bennett, who leaves his post next month.

   More than 900 households in this

because of the drought, officials said.
   Water in the Ben George Reservoir along Tidioute Creek, which
normally supplies most of town's water, were expected to drop to

Wednesday night.
   Three 450-gallon water tanks have been brought to the area.
Authorities in this town 40 miles southeast of Erie also planned to
tap into a test well.
   An advisory for boiling drinking water would be put into effect
because water from the well won't be chlorinated and will be high
in iron and sodium content.

<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Republicans led by standard-bearer George
Bush are making clear that they are not going to let Democratic
presidential nominee Michael Dukakis forget his Belgian endive
remark.
   Bush and other party leaders appeared at a Wednesday breakfast
of Midwestern Republicans less than a day after Bush's selection of
Indiana Sen. Dan Quayle as his running mate.
   Bush, Kansas Sen. Bob Dole and Agriculture Secretary Richard
Lyng all hammered Dukakis for suggesting in Iowa that farmers could
bolster their operations by growing different crops _ like Belgian
endive.
   ``I don't think that Belgian endive is the answer to American
agriculture,'' Bush said. ``My wife likes Belgian endive, but I
hate them.''
   ``Poor Michael, he can't be blamed,'' Lyng said. ``He grew up in
the city and he doesn't know the difference between Belgian endive
and corn.
   ``I don't know how many truckloads of Belgian endive it would
take to surplus the market,'' Lyng said. ``It wouldn't take very
damn many.''
   ``I thought it was part of his foreign policy,'' said Dole.

   No, it's not the latest variation on ``The
People's Court,'' but a ``rent-a-judge'' program has actress
Valerie Harper delighted about her starring role in a real-life
courtroom this week.
   The trial of multimillion-dollar suits and countersuits filed
between Miss Harper and her former employers, Lorimar and NBC-TV,
opened Wednesday following a bitter dispute over the television
series ``Valerie.''
   Miss Harper was fired from ``Valerie'' last summer after a
heated dispute with Lorimar and the show's producers. They claimed
she threw tantrums and was difficult to work with. She claimed they
fired her without reason.
   Also at issue was a dispute over Miss Harper's request for an
increase in her $56,750-per-episode salary.
   Under an unusual ``rent-a-judge'' program that brought the
dispute to trial about four years faster than usual, all parties
agreed to share costs of about $15,000 a week to hire retired
Superior Court Judge William Hogoboom and a staff of court
personnel to handle the case.
   ``I'm very glad to finally have my day in court,'' Miss Harper
told reporters. ``And it's wonderful to have it settled in a very
timely fashion.''

   Debra Murphree, who claims she posed nude for
evangelist Jimmy Swaggart, was stunned to receive a six-month jail
term in an unrelated prostitution case because she has begun to
chang her ways, her lawyer says.
   ``Obviously she committed the crime,'' said defense attorney Tom
Weymann. ``But it's a shock, given the circumstances.''
   Since the Swaggart scandal, Weymann said, Miss Murphree has
returned to her hometown of Patoka, Ind., and has been living with
her parents and three children, ages 7, 8, and 10. She was making
arrangements to return to school to study interior design, her
lawyer said.
   Miss Murphree, 28, was sentenced Wednesday for a 1987 arrest at
a suburban New Orleans motel. She pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor
charge of prostitution May 20, three months after she identified
herself as the woman at the center of the Swaggart scandal.
   Swaggart never acknowledged any encounter with Miss Murphree,
but tearfully confessed from the pulpit that he had committed
unspecified sins.
   Miss Murphree sold her story about Swaggart to Penthouse
magazine, accompanied by a series of explicit photos showing the
poses and acts she said Swaggart asked her to do in the motel room.

   No charges will be filed against
the wife of pop singer Lionel Richie for allegedly beating another
woman she found with her husband, prosecutors said.
   Brenda Richie, 35, and dancer Diane Alexander, 22, ``view this
as a very unfortunate and situational incident,'' Los Angeles
County Deputy District Attorney Eldon Fox said Wednesday.
   ``But for the noise and screaming from this incident, law
enforcement would not have been contacted, both complainant and
suspect agree,'' Fox said.
   Mrs. Richie was arrested June 29 after a noisy brawl with her
husband and Miss Alexander at Miss Alexander's apartment. Richie,
39, and Miss Alexander have known each other for four years.

industry right after he takes his final sky hook.
   Abdul-Jabbar announced Wednesday that he has signed an agreement

him in all entertainment fields.
   The 7-foot-2 center, the National Basketball Association's
all-time regular season scoring leader with 37,639 points, is under
contract to play one more season with the defending NBA champion
Lakers. It will be his 20th professional season.
   A couple of entertainment projects already are planned when his
time on the court ends, including a Home Box Office special that
will incorporate film of Abdul-Jabbar's career and of his final

   Sen. Daniel Inouye's thoughts lately have
centered on winning the vote for Senate majority leader, but he
says his gaze sometimes reflects memories of the day he became a
hero during World War II.
   Inouye, D-Hawaii, won honors that day as a soldier with the
Japanese-American 442nd Regimental Combat Team during an assault in
Italy's Po Valley. It was also the day he lost his right arm.
   That morning he couldn't find his good luck charm _ a silver
dollar won in a poker game that he said had already stopped a
bullet.
   ``I told my friend Terry, `Today's my day. I'm going to get it.'
... To this day he reminds me of that,'' he said recently.

   Feisty designer Pauline Trigere is kicking off a
new advertising campaign with a ``Dear John'' letter that teases
powerful Fairchild Publications chief John B. Fairchild.
   ``After all these years, and so many terrific collections _ is
it really over between us?'' the 75-year-old Paris-born designer
asks. ``You don't call. You don't write. I still love you.''
   The ad, which will appear in The New York Times Magazine on
Sunday and later in several other national fashion magazines, is
Trigere's response to being left out of the influential trade paper
Women's Wear Daily, which critiques designer collections.
   ``For three years our name has not appeared in Women's Wear at
all,'' Miss Trigere said Wednesday. ``I don't know why. Whenever I
see Mr. Fairchild we always talk very friendly.''
   ``I think it is very courageous,'' said John Weitz, a fashion
designer who says his name also has received scant mention in the
magazine. ``How wise it is, I don't know.''
   Fairchild, who is rumored to bar WWD reporters from mentioning
certain people in fashion and social circles, declined comment on
the advertisement.

   For the atheists of America, it's been a long
week. Just listen:
   ``This is my 10th Republican National Convention and, God
willing, not my last,'' said Gerald Ford.
   ``With God's help, and the help of George Bush, we will redeem
the American dream,'' said Thomas Kean.
   ``As Americans,'' said Pat Robertson, ``we are not ashamed to
pledge allegiance to a flag that is a symbol of one nation under
God.''
   Despite being subjected to ``intense bigotry and hostility''
ever since he hit town, 35-year-old Bob Sherman is gamely going
about his duties for the monthly American Atheist Press, which
declares itself ``the leading watchdog for the separation of church
and state.''
   As the magazine's Chicago bureau chief, Sherman is on the alert
for any and all incidents of atheist-bashing. Just the other day,
he says, an Illinois delegate turned to him and said, ``We don't
need any atheists here. Why don't you get lost?'''
   Ongoing crusades by the atheists include stamping out
``religious graffiti on our currency'' and ``offensive, secular
religious editorializing in our pledge of allegiance.''
   At the convention, things aren't going well. ``They've mentioned
the `G' word frequently,'' he said sadly. ``They haven't said the
`A' word once.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   The Washington delegation, on the other hand, cheers lustily at
the mention of the ``G'' word.
   Hushed and attentive during invocations and benedictions, the
Washington delegates shout ``amen'' when each prayer is over. When
the Rev. Billy Graham gave the benediction, they raised their hands
heavenward.
   They say grace at restaurants and read their Bibles on breaks.
And they managed to persuade the management at their hotel to pull
the plug on the movie channel.
   They've been less successful on tawdry Bourbon Street, where
several have witnessed for Christ outside the strip joints.

   ``Somebody asked me yesterday, was I disappointed I didn't get a
call. I said I got a call. I'm not disappointed.''
   At an early morning breakfast packed with supporters, Sen. Bob
Dole's quip got a laugh. But the crowd laughed even harder when
Dole, who didn't get the job, poked gentle fun at Sen. Dan Quayle,
who did.
   ``He called me,'' Dole said. ``He was shaving. First time.''
   For Dean Banker of Russell, Kan., Dole's hometown, the humor was
reassuring. Still, it wasn't until he'd ``looked him in the eye and
shook his hand'' that Banker knew his old friend was OK.
   ``We Kansans are notorious for not wearing our hearts on our
sleeves. I was concerned about him,'' Banker said. ``But having
seen him today, his spirit, his vivaciousness, I can tell you that
he is OK.''
   Banker owns a clothing store on Main Street in Russell, where
Dole was among his first customers. As a sign in the window
attests, ``Bob Dole Suited Up Here First.''

   Dan Quayle drew the most attention, and the warmest applause, in

tomorrow or past to the back,'' Quayle said. Pause. ``Past to the
back. That's a Hoosierism. You'll get used to them.''

<HEAD>GOP Strikes Back at Democratic Fund-raising Challenge</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GARY LANGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Republican fund-raisers, rising to their
stiffest Democratic challenge in decades, are working this
convention week on their fall strategy and celebrating their
success so far.
   Their challenge comes from Robert Farmer, the vaunted Democratic
money man who has pledged to raise $50 million for Democratic
nominee Michael Dukakis' effort in the fall presidential campaign.
   That sum, though unprecedented for a Democrat, has instilled
newfound fervor in Republican campaign donors.
   ``We're concerned about it,'' said Fred Bush, chief fund-raiser
of Vice President George Bush's campaign. ``There seems to be a lot
of interest in fund raising on the Democratic side. I've never seen
that before.''
   Bush, no relation to George Bush, is responding by marshaling
his own forces _ more than 600 contributors of $10,000-plus who are
in town for the Republican convention. In addition to a full slate
of parties, the top 200 fund-raisers held a 1{-hour meeting to plan
their efforts in each state.
   ``Our guys understand. They know what's going on out there,''
Fred Bush said in an interview. ``A lot of them have come to us and
said, `I don't want the Democrats to beat us on fund raising. What
can I do?'''
   One thing they could do was attend a $1,000-per-plate lunch at
the city Convention Center to benefit the Republican National
Committee. The goal: a whopping $4 million, compared with $2.5
million at the Dallas gala in 1984.
   ``It's our one big gala every year,'' said RNC spokeswoman
Katherine Murray. ``It's an opportunity for us to honor the new
nominee and vice presidential nominee. It's a celebration of our
all being here together.''
   It's also a chance for corporations to get in good with the GOP
by reserving tables at $100,000 each. And it's a way for the
Republicans to stroke their wealthy supporters with a personal
appearance by the nominee.
   So far the Republicans have done well at raising money. For
starters they have raised the legal limit of $8.3 million in
privately donated money the campaign can spend directly. That
supplements $46 million from the federal government for direct
spending.
   They also have come up with about $7 million, of a $25 million
goal, for state party accounts to be spent in coordination with the
presidential campaign, and several million dollars more for general
party-building. A separate item is the RNC's operating budget,
beneficiary of Thursday's gala.
   If the Democrats meet their goal, ``they're going to do better
than they've ever done,'' said Fred Bush. ``And we Republicans are
going to try to match them, or even beat them.''

   Not only did Clarksville inventor Freddie Roberts fly the remote
control lawn mower for several minutes in the park, he even made it
fly loops, turns and upside-down.
   ``I made it for fun and to silence a few critics who think I'm
crazy, including my wife,'' Roberts, 44, said Monday.
   ``Who says a lawn mower can't fly? This one can fly but it can't
cut grass ... unless we have a crash landing.''
   The flying mower, made of balsa wood and Styrofoam, weighs less
than 5 pounds and is equipped with a model airplane engine. It is
guided by a model-airplane radio remote control.
   Roberts, a model airplane enthusiast for 30 years, also flies
gyrocopters, ultra-lights and is getting his pilot's license.
   ``I plan to build a (remote control) flying Santa Claus and
sleigh with reindeer for Christmas,'' he said.

   A head start and a filibuster couldn't
stop City Council's meeting this week from becoming Durango's
fastest council meeting ever _ 11 minutes.
   The previous record of 12 minutes was set in 1984, when Bill
Casey was mayor.
   Casey, still a member of the council, tried a good-natured
filibuster Tuesday to protect his place in the record book, but
other council members cut him off by voting to call the question on
the one item on the agenda.
   Mayor Greg Bell banged the gavel to end the meeting at 7:40 p.m.
The meeting started at 7:29 p.m., a minute early.

   When Alfred Wilhelm traveled from Germany
to Oshkosh in search of his roots, he never expected to hit paydirt
in a cemetery by meeting one of his living relatives there.
   The 38-year-old Bavarian was diligently copying birth and death
dates from headstones in the Riverside Cemetery last year when
Wilhelm Mauritz walked by.
   Mauritz, 84, was born in a farmhouse near the German-Austrian
border in 1904. His father, Joseph, wrote to three uncles living in
Oshkosh and asked them to sponsor their voyage to America. They
complied, and the Mauritz family came to America in 1905 on the
steamship Pennsylvania.
   But Mauritz's father did not forget his German relatives,
keeping in touch with them through letters and photographs. The
letters and photographs came back to his son via Wilhelm.
   The two first met last year when Mauritz struck up a
conversation with Wilhelm at the cemetery. Wilhelm explained he was
from Munich, researching his family history and then brought out a
photograph _ a copy of the same picture Mauritz had at home.
   The woman in the photograph was Katharina Drachsler, Wilhelm's
great-great-grandmother. She was also a great-aunt to Mauritz'
first wife, Rosa.
   ``That took me by surprise when he took that picture out and
says, `Where is this lady buried?''' Mauritz recalled.
   Wilhelm, who is on a second visit here, said he started tracing
his family history 10 years ago. ``My grandpa also searched for
family and I followed him,'' he said.

<HEAD>It Took Two Ballots to Award an Honorary Degree to Quayle</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOUG RICHARDSON</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Sen. Dan Quayle won an honorary degree from
his alma mater, DePauw University, in 1982 _ but it took more
ballots than will be required tonight to give him the Republican
vice presidential nomination.
   Faculty members at the Greencastle, Ind., liberal arts college
first voted not to award Quayle the degree, but relented after the
university president said he had already invited Quayle to be the
school's commencement speaker.
   Professors were troubled that Quayle's youth, brief record in
Congress and mediocre academic record made him a bad candidate for
the honorary doctor of laws, DePauw Professor O. Ralph Raymond said
Wednesday night.
   ``It wasn't that his career was undistinguished, it was just
that it was such a short career,'' said Raymond, a specialist on
Soviet affairs who opposed the degree award.
   ``I hope honorary degrees mean something ... and I think
prematurity tends to trivialize them,'' he said. ``I was simply
trying to protect two institutions, the university and the honorary
degree.''
   Raymond said some faculty members thought Quayle, at 35, needed
a longer record of accomplishment.
   He added that ``certainly there were some people quite bothered
by the fact that we were honoring a person whose intellectual
achievements were unimpressive,'' said Raymond, who never taught
Quayle. ``We like to see students achieve a little bit more than he
did.''
   The arguments of Raymond and other opponents of the degree
initially carried the day when the faculty voted 32-24 against
giving the award.
   But then DePauw President Richard F. Rosser said he had already
extended Quayle an invitation to speak at commencement and pick up
the degree.
   About 16 faculty members, wanting to avoid embarrassing Rosser,
later switched their votes, clearing the way for the award that
Quayle listed on his official campaign biography in 1986.
   Quayle is a 1969 graduate of DePauw and an attorney trained at
the Indiana University law school.
   Another dispute followed the degree spat when two reporters at
student radio station WGRE broke the story.
   They were fired for reporting on what Rosser claimed was an
off-the-record meeting. A news supervisor at the station quit to
protest.
   Quayle, who once worked as a reporter at his father's newspaper,
wrote a letter to the university to urge the reporters'
reinstatement.
   He said the firings ``could have a chilling effect on freedom of
the press.''
   The students didn't get their jobs back, Raymond said.
   Rosser is now president of the American Association of
Independent Colleges in Washington, D.C. He could not be reached
for comment Wednesday night.

   Joaquin Rabago feels an affinity for this
Mediterranean-style city with its easygoing atmosphere and
cosmopolitan foods, but he may be one of few visiting journalists
who's seen much of New Orleans.
   Rabago, the Washington bureau chief of EFE, an international
news wire serving Spain and Latin America, says the French Quarter
makes him nostalgic for Spain.
   ``The atmosphere, the smells. The food is the best I've had in
the states by far,'' he said. ``There's some indolence about it,
savoir vivre. Things you don't find in other cities in the United
States.''
   Joel Southern, meanwhile, has gotten acquainted mainly with the
inside of the press room at the Louisiana Superdome, site of the
Republican National Convention.
   Southern, here with the Berns Bureau, a Washington-based radio
service, said of the work area: ``I probably know this room better
than anyone else. One day was about 32 hours long. Yesterday was 25
or 26.''
   Both Rabago and Southern are among the 12,000 journalists in
town for the convention, many of whom don't have their own
headquarters and work out of a common press room equipped with
telephones and typewriters.
   While he's glad to be in New Orleans, Rabago says he can't
understand why the Republicans chose this city for their convention.
   Cabbies are telling him tales of former jobs in the oil drilling
business, he said, underscoring the gap between the upbeat
Republican economic theme and the downbeat Louisiana economy.
   And then there is the French Quarter.
   ``All that eroticism and voluptuousness doesn't seem to fit into
their message, particularly the conservative sector,'' he said.
   Though the city may remind Rabago of Spain, it doesn't remind
John Ralston of home.
   ``This place is much more decadent than Las Vegas,'' said the
reporter for the Las Vegas Review-Journal. ``There's no place in
Las Vegas where you can look from the street and see topless and
bottomless dancing, and women dancing in the streets virtually
taking their clothes off.''
   The media visitors to New Orleans range from correspondents for
Japanese newspaper groups to Chris Holly, a reporter for the Herald
of Rock Hill, S.C., circulation 30,000.
   ``We have a pretty hot Republican team here. They're going
places and we couldn't afford to ignore them,'' said Holly. Lee
Atwater, George Bush's campaign manager, is from South Carolina,
and Gov. Carroll Campbell was on Bush's short list of vice
presidential possibilities.
   Kawauchi Takas, Washington correspondent for the Mainichi
newspaper group in Japan, said his predecessor had given him some
tips on convention coverage: ``If you go to a Republican
convention, the first thing you notice will be the smell of the
perfume. If you go to a Democratic convention, the first thing you
notice will be the smell of sweat.'' He laughed. ``I think my
predecessor's advice was not quite correct.''
   Unlike reporters from bigtime news organizations, many of those
in the common press room are searching for local stories _ with
mixed success.
   Reporters from Southern's bureau had just completed sending a
story to Guam but weren't having much luck for a client in
Edmonton, Alberta.
   ``We tried to find the Canadian observers down here, but we
couldn't,'' Southern said. ``I tried a few free trade questions on
some Michigan delegates, but they weren't in a position to say
anything intelligent,'' said Matt Kaye.
   Yoichiro Miwa, chief of The Nishi-Nippon Shimbun (West Japan)
Daily's Washington bureau, said the 14-hour time difference means
``we must work everyday until very late at night, sometimes very
early in the morning. It's very difficult for us to find sleeping
time. We are workaholics.''
   Still, he added: ``I would like to go to the French Quarter. It
is very popular in Japan.''

<HEAD>Drought-Damaged Harvest Will Reduce Canadian Grain Exports</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Dollar figures U.S.</NOTE>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BRADLEY</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The rich soil of the Red River Valley
normally produces 40 bushels of red spring wheat per acre, helping
make Canada the world's second-largest wheat exporter. The drought
of 1988 has changed that.
   Farmer Glenn Whitmore, harvesting 300 acres in St. Norbert just
south of Winnipeg, is getting just 10 bushels an acre from fields
parched by the sun and infested with weeds and grasshoppers.
   ``Well, at least we've got the seed back,'' Whitmore, 35, said
with resignation as he rode a mower over stunted foot-high stalks
of wheat. ``I don't know if there's any lessons in farming. You
just take it one year at a time.''
   Things are worse in southern Saskatchewan, the country's major
wheat producer. Many farmers failed to get any crop at all in
conditions likened to the dust bowl of the 1930s.
   Wheat and barley yields overall will be 50 percent below normal.
   In Alberta, Canada's other breadbasket province, the weather has
been whimsical to the point of perversity. Southern areas felt the
full impact of the drought while farmers in the northern Peace
River region had 22 inches of rain and could collect bumper crops
if their fields dried out long enough for harvesting.
   Across the prairies, experts predict a harvest down at least 30
percent from last year, and that means Canada's 105,000 grain
farmers will find it harder to fill orders from the Soviet Union,
Japan, China and other traditional markets.
   ``It's a terrible year,'' said John Morriss of the Canadian
Wheat Board, the Winnipeg-based government marketing agency for
prairie grain. ``We're going to have substantially reduced
exports.''
   After selling 31.6 million metric tons of wheat and other
prairie grain last year, earning about $2.5 billion despite a
global price war, there may be just 15 million metric tons
available for export this year.
   A metric ton is equivalent to 2,205 pounds or 1.1 short tons.
   One of the major grain cooperatives, United Grain Growers Ltd.,
estimated Wednesday that the 1988 harvest of six major grains will
total 31.7 million metric tons, only 69 percent of last year's 45.9
million tons.
   The reduction is even greater in comparison with the record 51.4
million metric tons harvested in the West two years ago.
   ``It's sort of worse than people had hoped or thought,'' said
United Grain official George Weaver. ``Farmers that thought they
might get 15 to 20 bushels an acre found they were getting 12 to
15.''
   The company forecast a wheat harvest of 15.3 million metric
tons, down 40 percent, while barley and rye harvests will be 40 to
50 percent of normal in many areas.
   ``We went into the season with virtually no snow or moisture
reserves in the soil,'' said Dave McIntyre of the Alberta Wheat
Pool, ``and some areas have still seen virtually no rain since last
August.''
   Things appear much brighter for the 279 floor traders at the
Winnipeg Commodity Exchange who have handled record volume this
summer as speculators gambled on the future price of grain and
prices almost doubled.
   ``I've never seen so much action,'' said Bill Craddock, an
independent dealer who also farms 3,000 acres of wheat, barley,
canola and flax.
   He said the wildcard in the market is the farmer who's been able
to fill his bins with grain but may let prices rise further before
selling any of it. ``A lot of farmers are just holding on,''
Craddock said.
   Most farming towns across the Canadian prairies became towns
because of the local grain elevator and railroad loading bay, but
the Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta wheat pools expect to handle
just 60 percent of normal traffic this season because of the
drought.
   That could have a devastating impact on isolated communities
where elevators are closed down, while the reduced volume also
threatens jobs at grain-handling ports such as Thunder Bay and
along the St. Lawrence Seaway.
   ``We depend on people coming into the town,'' said Manno Wiens,
owner of a car repair shop in Oak Lake, west of Winnipeg, where the
grain elevator is to close later this year. ``If a farmer blew a
tire, he'd buy one from me. Now he'll do it elsewhere.''
   Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's government is providing $2.3
billion in aid to farmers this year and so fa, there has been no
mass exodus from the land, due largely to crop insurance that
covers up to 100 percent of losses.
   But the drought of 1988 will be remembered. As McIntyre said,
``Fathers who are thinking about handing over their farm to their
kids are hesitating and saying, ``Maybe you'd better think about it
again.'''

<HEAD>Pollsters Doubt Quayle's Ability To Sway Female Voters</HEAD>

   George Bush has a problem with women voters,
and Dan Quayle's blond good looks and youthful charm aren't enough
to help him out, analysts of women's voting trends say.
   The gender gap, the difference between political preferences of
men and women, has been nettlesome for the Republican presidential
candidate this year. Polls show a significant lead for Democratic
nominee Michael Dukakis among women voters.
   Bush advisers, some GOP delegates, and the vice president
himself cited an appeal to women as one explanation for the
selection of the Indiana senator as Bush's running mate.
   ``We need the female vote. He'll do the trick,'' said Sharon
Estrada, a delegate from Billings, Mont. ``He's very cute.''
   But the suggestion that Quayle is attractive to female voters _
based on physical appearance rather than issues _ sparked
disagreement and even outrage among some women.
   ``Oh, come on _ that's stupid,'' said Delaware delegate Lynn
Glaze, who led a futile effort to add support for the Equal Rights
Amendment to the GOP platform. ``Women will vote on the economic
issue, on the day care issue. They're not going to vote for someone
because of his looks.''
   ``This is not a screen test _ this is about an election,'' said
Jane Danowitz, executive director of the Women's Campaign Fund, the
largest women's political action committee.
   ``It appears like the Republicans are attempting to woo the
women's vote rather than win it. It's a sad strategy,'' she said.
   Rep. Bill Green, R-N.Y., warned that the gender gap is ``the
major threat George Bush's campaign faces.''
   Dukakis has enjoyed an advantage among women over Bush that is
as large as 32 percentage points in a Harris poll taken in late
July. Other polls in the last six weeks have shown Dukakis' lead
among women to be at least 12 percentage points.
   The Dukakis campaign believes the figure currently is about 18
points, said Nikki Heideprim, Dukakis' adviser on the women's vote.
   Republican analysts saw the selection of Quayle, the 41-year-old
conservative Indiana senator, as a choice that carried appeal to
his generation of young adults born after World War II, and to
women voters.
   ``I think he will be someone who will help the ticket with all
the voters, and particularly women voters of that generation,''
said Bush pollster Robert Teeter.
   At his first news conference with Quayle, Bush cited both those
factors as well. He called Quayle ``a running mate who has record
of strong appeal to young people and to women voters in his state
because of his record.''
   Nancy Neuman, president of the League of Women Voters, said Bush
underestimated women voters if he believed Quayle would help
improve the GOP ticket's support among women because of his
appearance.
   ``Do you think anybody would have said that about Geraldine
Ferraro?'' she said, referring to the 1984 Democratic nominee for
vice president. ``It's sexist.
   ``The idea that somebody's telegenic and gorgeous and that's why
people will vote for him is patronizing,'' Neuman said.
   Political analysts say they believe the gender gap is driven by
differences in the way women and men feel on key issues,
principally economic and social ones.
   Democratic polltaker Mark Mellman says the gender gap is
becoming institutionalized _ that women tend to identify more with
the Democratic Party.
   ``The fact the Bush people would even think the looks of a
candidate would be important, I think shows how profound their
misunderstanding is of the nature and sources of their problem with
women voters,'' Mellman said.
   Quayle has been an opponent of the Equal Rights Amendment and is
a fierce opponent of abortion. He supports Bush's plan for tax
credits to low-income families for child care, beyond the existing
child care credit, and opposes national standards for day care.
   Quayle, his supporters point out, won a landslide re-election
with 61 percent of the vote over a female opponent in 1986. He
showed strength among both women and men voters, although his
opponent ran an underfinanced campaign.
   Quayle has been popular with middle-aged and older women as a
campaigner in Indiana. He frequently hugs an elderly woman or
accepts a peck on the cheek when working the crowds at county fairs
and parades.
   After his selection, Quayle said, ``Women ought to resent the
suggestion that they would vote for somebody on looks. That is an
insult to women. I think it's absolute nonsense. It is demeaning to
women.''

   Dan Quayle has not yet been nominated for
vice president and already Republicans are comparing him to Thomas
Jefferson and John F. Kennedy.
   Sen. John Warner of Virginia, who served with Quayle on a Senate
subcommittee, told an audience that whenever he heard the Indiana
senator speak, ``I'd say, `there stands the next Thomas
Jefferson.'''
   And, added Warner, ``he does have the same fire in his belly as
our great forefather Thomas Jefferson of Virginia.''
   Former president Gerald Ford made the comparison with Kennedy, a
Democrat.
   ``In 1960, the American people voted for John F. Kennedy for
president and he was the relatively same age as Dan Quayle,'' said
Ford. ``John Kennedy had been in the House and Senate 14 years
before he was elected president and Dan Quayle's had 12 years.''
   What Quayle thinks of those references isn't known. But he
doesn't like it when people say he looks like movie idol Robert
Redford.
   Whether, indeed, he looks like Redford seems to be in the eye of
the beholder. In the parlance of politics, it's an issue. They are
both male. They are both blond.
   The so-called resemblance became a point of contention in the
1980 Senate race and Redford took umbrage. The actor, who once
played the role of a presidential office seeker in ``The
Candidate'' sent Quayle a telegram telling him to stop the
look-alike references in his congressional campaign literature.
   Quayle said the news media had made the comparison, not he, and
after he was elected sent Redford an autographed picture of himself.
   And this week, he told reporters he considered the so-called
Redford look ``a stigma.'' He wasn't asked how he felt about being
painted as another Jefferson or Kennedy.
   Meanwhile, fellow senators were trying to publicize Quayle who,
at 41, hasn't had a chance to become a legend. He is a Republican
vice presidential candidate who is not, as Spiro Agnew once said of
himself, a household word.
   To help him get known, eight fellow senators Wednesday took
turns telling reporters how much they liked him.
   ``We know him well,'' said Strom Thurmond, R-S.C.
   ``He's attractive because of his looks, he's attractive because
of his enthusiasm,'' said Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.
   ``I think Dan Quayle, although he's 41 years of age, he's going
to send a message to the American people that the Republican Party
respects young people who achieve,'' said Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M.
   Oh, yes, he's also rich, but the senators said that should not
hold him back.
   ``Let's not start this business of who's wealthy,'' Sen. Alfonse
D'Amato, R-N.Y.

   George Bush, surrounded by his grandchildren
and other relatives, watched from his hotel room Wednesday night as
his oldest son announced the roll call vote that delivered the
Republican presidential nod he has awaited so long.
   The vice president grinned and applauded as son George W. Bush,
a delegate from Texas, announced the 111 votes that put the state's
``favorite son and the world's best father'' over the 1,139
delegates needed for nomination.
   ``It is a special moment,'' Bush said. ``The conclusion was
foregone, but it's special.''
   In what looked like a Bush family production, scenes of the vice
president in his hotel suite, seated on a couch with his six of his
10 grandchildren swarming over him, were flashed on the large
screens of the Superdome as the balloting progressed.
   His wife, Barbara, sat for a while in the hall alongside Sen.
Dan Quayle, Bush's vice presidential choice, then later joined her
husband to watch the roll call.
   All of Bush's five adult children are delegates to the
convention. His Mexican-born daughter-in-law, Columba, delivered
the final seconding speech for his nomination from the floor in
Spanish.
   Son Neil announced the Colorado vote, daughter Dorothy Bush
LeBlond called out the Maine tally. Son Marvin announced the vote
from Virginia vote, speaking after the Texas count had been posted.
   As the Texas vote approached, Bush exclaimed, ``Here we come.
Here's the big moment.'' Then, turning to his wife, he pointed to
the scene on television and said: ``There's Junior,'' referring to
his son by his nickname.
   Bush told reporters that his acceptance speech was ``all ready''
and that he was ready to go.
   Earlier, Bush had vowed to show off three generations of his
family to America, claiming ``I get my strength from my family.''
   The vote was the culmination of a campaign that began officially
on Oct. 12, 1987, and seemed on the verge of ending after his
third-place finish in the Iowa caucuses. But Bush bounced back with
a victory in the New Hampshire primary and then swept 16 primaries
on Super Tuesday, a showing that left little doubt this convention
would belong to him.
   Bush's first bid for the presidency in 1980 and stunned many
observers with his victory over Ronald Reagan in Iowa. But Reagan
was not to be denied and Bush ended up as vice president.
   His down-the-line loyalty in that post earned him support from
many conservatives and he picked up additional political support as
a tireless campaigner and fund-raiser for Republican candidates, a
base that proved more difficult to shake than his GOP rivals
imagined.
   During a news conference hours before he was to be nominated,
Bush reacted indignantly to criticism of his introduction Tuesday
of his three Mexican-American grandchildren as ``the little brown
ones.''
   ``Those grandchildren are my pride and joy, and when I say
`pride' I mean it,'' he said, his voice rising angrily.
   ``For anyone to suggest that that comment of pride is anything
other than what it was, I find it personally offensive,'' he went
on. ``And P.S., I don't want to see these kids hurt.''
   The three youngsters _ Jeb Jr., Noelle, and George P. _ are the
children of Bush's son, Jeb, and his Mexican-born wife, Columba.
   His family was also the subject of Bush remarks moments later
when he visited the California delegation.
   ``I'm saying to myself, you're going to have share more to show
where you get your strength,'' he told the delegates. ``And I get
my strength from my family.''
   Bush said he intended to put them ``under the spotlight'' at the
convention. After he delivers his acceptance speech Thursday, Bush
will be joined at the podium by his four sons and daughter, their
spouses and 10 grandchildren.
   The vice president and his advisers were clearly impressed by
the family images projected at the Democratic convention last month
at which presidential nominee Michael Dukakis was joined on the
podium by his wife and three children, his mother and actress
cousin. In addition, there was the prominent role given the five
children of Jesse Jackson.
   Bush commented after that convention that Dukakis ``did a good
job at the convention with his speech and showing those wonderfully
warm pictures.''
   Bush aides said that after the convention, Bush and Quayle would
set out on a joint campaign trip through Indiana, Ohio and Illinois
_ the latter two states, key industrial battlegrounds in the fall
election.
   Bush will head off without Quayle on Monday to address a VFW
convention In Chicago and then fly to the West Coast for
appearances in Washington and California, where he will make a
joint appearance with Reagan.
   Looking ahead to the campaign, Bush said he and Quayle were
``going to tell the truth, and it's going to see like you've
engaged a couple of pit bulls. ... We will be telling the truth
about where we want to lead this country, spelling out my
priorities.''

<HEAD>Robertson Says Divisions In Evangelical Vote Doomed His Campaign</HEAD>

   Pat Robertson said his Republican
presidential campaign sank partly because evangelicals aren't a
``monolithic'' voting bloc willing to give him the overwhelming
support that black voters handed to Jesse Jackson.
   ``I learned they were not a monolithic group,'' Robertson said
at a news conference on Wednesday, the day after he addressed the
Republican National Convention. ``The second thing I learned was
that if they had supported me in the strength that the black people
supported Jesse Jackson, I would be standing on the platform
(tonight).''
   That's when Bush is scheduled to formally accept the party's
nomination.
   ``The blacks supported Jesse in numbers as high as 97 percent in
many of the primaries,'' Robertson said. ``Evangelicals on the
other hand were divided.
   ``They were not monolithic,'' he said. ``That's not a bad thing,
but it limits their effectiveness.''
   Robertson had been considered something of a wild card in the
Republican presidential field, but he was never able to move beyond
his base of fundamentalist Christians and quickly fell by the
wayside. Some have compared his role in the Republican Party with
Jackson's among Democrats, but the two candidates have resisted
such comparisons.
   On Wednesday, however, Robertson conceded that one of the major
flaws in his campaign was that he was unable to mobilize his
political base as effectively as did Jackson.
   Robertson said he garnered a plurality among fundamentalists
during the early tests, but probably never won more than half of
those voting.
   ``I was coming out No. 1, but I wasn't coming out with 60, or
70, or 80, or 90 percent of them like Jesse Jackson was among black
people,'' Robertson said. ``I don't think I even had more than
half. That's sort of the polls I've read.
   ``The biggest thing I was facing was not antagonism, but
apathy,'' he said.
   The former television evangelist conceded that other Republican
candidates were able to make significant inroads into his base.
   ``Each candidate spoke to the evangelicals addressing their
concerns, they all addressed the issues,'' he said. ``There was no
clear choice, like this is this good guy, and this is the bad guy.
   ``If I were a candidate in the future, I think more and more of
the evangelicals would say `this man is the leader among us,'''
Robertson said.
   Robertson expressed confidence that he would be handed a role in
the fall election campaign, but said no details had been spelled
out.
   ``I'll be doing some traveling myself,'' Robertson said. ``I'm
sure they want our help.''
   In addition, Robertson said he would launch a voter registration
drive among fundamentalists, where he said there are large numbers
still uninterested in politics despite his campaign.
   Robertson was evasive on questions about his future in the
Republican Party, but said there are no signs that his backers are
leaving the political arena.
   ``The people who are there now want to continue, so that's the
start of a base,'' Robertson said.
   He rejected suggestions that that stance represented a threat to
GOP unity, or that his forces would seek to take control of the
party's machinery.
   ``I don't like the concept of takeover,'' Robertson said. ``It's
not necessary to do that.''
   He conceded the potential for conflict between his backers and
the party establishment.
   ``There are cultural differences between some of the
evangelicals and some of the wealthier members of the Republican
Party,'' Robertson said.

   At age 67, Democratic vice presidential
nominee Lloyd Bentsen follows a low-fat diet, takes a common
medicine to keep his cholesterol level down and ``is in excellent
health,'' his doctor says.
   ``I would say he's in better physical condition than men 20
years younger than he is,'' says Antonio M. Gotto Jr., a Houston
internist.
   Bentsen's wife, Beryl Ann, kidded about whether he had the body
of a 41-year-old, said Wednesday: ``You bet. No question about it.''
   Bentsen is the oldest of the four men on the Republican and
Democratic tickets this year. Democratic presidential nominee
Michael Dukakis is 54, Republican nominee George Bush is 64, and
his running mate, Sen. Dan Quayle of Indiana, is the youngest at 41.
   Bentsen's doctor said the senior senator from Texas spends 18
minutes a day on a treadmill or plays a vigorous game of tennis
three to four times a week.
   Gotto said Bentsen also inherited good genes from his father,
who is 94 and in good health, and takes responsibility for his
health by avoiding tobacco and limiting his intake of alcohol,
eating right, and keeping his weight, 167 pounds, in check for his
6-foot-1 frame.
   ``He follows a diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol of the
type recommended by the American Heart Association,'' Gotto said in
a statement released Wednesday along with the senator's income tax
returns for the past five years.
   Those returns show Bentsen and his wife paid an average of
$264,453 annually in federal taxes on gross earnings averaging
$772,181 between 1983 and 1987.
   Gotto, Bentsen's personal physician since 1986, last examined
him in April and prescribed a low dose of lovastatin, a drug to
reduce his cholesterol level from 245 milligrams per decaliter. In
early 1986, Bentsen's cholesterol level reached 267.
   Government guidelines say cholesterol counts of 245 are
considered ``high risk.''
   Gotto said that after the senator used the drug for a month, his
cholesterol level fell to 200, a level the government guidelines
say is desirable.
   Bentsen's spokesman, Jack DeVore, said the senator continues to
take medicine for his cholesterol level, but that he requires only
the lowest dose available.
   Results of the April physical were ``completely normal with the
exception of a slight elevation of systolic blood pressure to 148
and two small lesions on the skin,'' Gotto said.
   A followup examination found Bentsen's blood pressure was normal
and the skin lesions had disappeared.
   In his financial disclosure report, Bentsen, a former insurance
executive, did not declare his net worth. On the campaign trail in
Lubbock, Texas, Bentsen said he did not know the precise figure.
   ``Frankly, I haven't made out a financial statement that has
given me my net worth in a number of years. (I) don't know what it
is,'' Bentsen said.
   However, he added later, ``I have paid a lot of taxes.''
   A source close to the senator who spoke on condition of
anonymity said he would not argue with other estimates that
Bentsen's net worth exceeds $10 million.
   Bentsen also revealed Wednesday that he had opened a blind trust
because of his race for vice president. Holdings in the trust
include interests in mineral leases and land, mutual funds and
common stock in more than a dozen well-known companies such as
Chevron, Boeing, Exxon, Johnson & Johnson and Unisys.
   Bentsen's income tax returns for the years 1983 through 1987
show that he and his wife earned a high of $1,020,607 in 1983 and a
low of $597,906 in 1984. He paid his highest taxes of $403,932 in
1983 and a low of $155,329 the following year.
   The couple had gross earnings of $604,587 and taxes of $253,098
in 1985; gross earnings of $718,237 and taxes of $298,495 in 1986;
and gross earnings of $919,566 and taxes of $211,411 in 1987.
   The three-term senator and his wife also distributed an average
of $21,381 in charitable contributions during each of those five
years, about 2.8 percent of their income. Their federal taxes over
the five years averaged 34.2 percent of adjusted gross income.
   Bentsen also issued new financial disclosure forms, which mixed
his blind trust income and assets with other holdings and earnings.
   The new figures considerably increased his reported worth from
the financial disclosure report he filed with the Senate last May,
which did not include details of the blind trust's holdings.
   The new figures show assets ranging from $5.1 million to more
than $7.9 million; income ranging from $894,000 to more than $2
million; and liabilities ranging from $260,000 to $615,000.
   In his May statement, which covered his assets, income and
liabilities as of the end of 1987, Bentsen reported income ranging
from $296,000 to $418,000, assets of $1.4 million to $2 million,
and liabilities of $100,000 to $250,000.
   The disclosure forms only require a range of figures for all
categories. In addition to his other earnings, Bentsen earns
$89,500 annually in Senate salary.

<HEAD>Despite Drawbacks, Zia Was a Key US Ally</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Mohammed Zia ul-Haq, who guided
Pakistan for 11 years, enjoyed close ties with the United States
despite liabilities that would have doomed that relationship had he
governed a less strategically important country.
   Zia's refusal to be intimidated by the presence of over 100,000
Soviet troops in neighboring Afghanistan overrode all other
considerations in Washington, enabling Pakistan to be among the
largest recipients of American assistance.
   Zia, who died Wednesday in a plane crash along with U.S.
Ambassador Arnold L. Raphel and an American brigadier general,
allowed U.S.-backed Afghan rebels to use Pakistan as a staging
ground for attacks on Afghanistan. He also permitted Pakistan to be
used as a safe haven for 3 million Afghan refugees.
   So dependent was the Reagan administration on Pakistan for
achieving its policy goals in Afghanistan that Washington
soft-pedaled other aspects of Zia's rule that many in Congress
found objectionable.
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz, in New Orleans on Wednesday
for the Republican national convention, credited Zia with inducing
the Soviet Union to begin withdrawing its forces from Afghanistan.
   The Reagan administration normally favors multiparty democracy
but essentially remained silent in the face of Zia's scornful
attitude toward his country's political parties.
   He decreed that the Nov. 16 national elections would be
conducted on a non-party basis, meaning that the largely illiterate
Pakistani population will not have the benefit of party symbols
when they cast their ballots.
   ``If you have the spirit of democracy, why insist on the form?''
Zia asked an interviewer recently. ``Why must there be parties?''
   There are also congressional concerns about Pakistan's role as
source of supply for U.S.-bound heroin.
   But the greatest concern to members of Congress was the
suspicion that Pakistan under Zia's rule was developing _ or
already has developed _ a nuclear weapons capability.
   U.S. law prohibits aiding countries that acquire uranium
enrichment technology and do not put it under the International
Atomic Energy Agency's safeguard system.
   Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, has criticized the Reagan
administration for aiding Pakistan even though that country has not
provided ``ironclad assurances'' that it is not building nuclear
weapons.
   Leonard Spector, an expert on the spread of nuclear weapons, has
said ``available evidence leaves little doubt'' that Pakistan is
indeed developing nuclear arms.
   President Reagan has certified repeatedly that Pakistan has not
developed such a capability and therefore is eligible for continued
U.S. assistance. The U.S. aid program totals $3.28 billion over six
years, a generous sum in an age of worldwide aid cutbacks.
   To Sen. Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H., Zia's critics overlooked his
role as a ``bulwark against Soviet imperialism,'' a sentiment he
repeated Wednesday while attending the GOP conclave in New Orleans.
   After Zia's death, the State Department was quick to reaffirm
support for Pakistan.
   ``We have a long history of close and friendly cooperation with
Pakistan,'' department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said. ``At this
moment of extreme trial, I want to reiterate our commitment to
Pakistan and our full support for the acting president and his
government.''
   Former United Nations Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick wondered
whether Pakistan's strong stand on Afghanistan would continue under
Zia's successors and whether the country would be able to contain
Islamic fundamentalists.
   She called Zia ``a very strong person, very important to the
whole geopolitical strategic constellation of the region, very
important to the freedom fighters of Afghanistan.''

<HEAD>People Succeed Computers at End of Social Security Phone Lines</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Inundated by requests for its new personalized
benefit estimates, the Social Security Administration has added 366
new phone lines answered by people instead of a computer.
   ``Obviously, many, many Americans were getting busy signals,''
Phil Gambino, a spokesman for the agency, said Wednesday. ``Now
people are getting through on the first ring. We're hoping those
who got a busy signal last week will call us back.''
   Social Security Administrator Dorcas R. Hardy unveiled the new
``personal earnings and benefit estimate statements'' on Aug. 4.
   To get them, workers must fill out an application form,
SSA-7004, that they can obtain by calling a toll-free number _
1-800-937-2000 _ or writing the Consumer Information Center,
Department 55, Social Security, Pueblo, Colo. 81009.
   The request forms also are available at any of the 1,300 local
Social Security offices nationwide.
   Because people were confused by the computer or the computer
didn't understand the addresses being given and asked for repeats,
it was handling only about 2,500 calls an hour, Gambino said.
   To handle the heavy public demand, he said the agency added 216
more lines answered by employees and contracted for another 120
lines through a private company, all on the same 800 number.
   Gambino said the agency has received nearly 700,000 requests for
the forms in the first two weeks the service has been available.
   Once the forms are filled out with a participant's estimate of
his or her future earnings, Social Security will calculate
estimates of monthly retirement benefits in today's dollars at ages
62, 65, and 70.
   Based on the agency's own records, the statement also will
include the monthly benefits for a worker and family upon
disability or death.
   Social Security officials said recipients should receive the
detailed financial statements, listing the amount of various
benefits they have earned or will have earned, two to four weeks
after the agency receives the request form.

<HEAD>Navy Announces Delivery Delay on $3 Billion Carrier</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Navy says it has agreed to delayed
delivery of the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier George Washington
under a mutually agreeable proposal by the contractor, the Newport
News Shipbuilding & Drydock Co.
   The delay will total six months and push the scheduled delivery
date for the huge Nimitz-class carrier from Dec. 29, 1991, to July
3, 1992, the Navy said.
   The change will not affect the price of the carrier, the Navy
said. The service said it approved the delay to help Newport News
set up ``the most cost-effective and efficient construction
schedule possible'' for carrier work that will extend at least
through 1998.
   Newport News Shipbuilding, a division of Tenneco Inc., is the
only shipyard in the country capable of building the
nuclear-powered carriers. The yard is in the midst of constructing
the Abraham Lincoln, which is scheduled to be delivered Dec. 29,
1989, and the George Washington.
   Last fall, at the Navy's urging, Congress agreed to add funding
for two additional nuclear carriers to ensure that replacements are
available when two older, conventionally powered carriers are
retired in the 1990's.
   During the debate, Newport News officials said awarding such
contracts now would save taxpayer money by avoiding disruptions to
the company's labor force.
   According to Lt. Bruce Cole, a Navy spokesman, the Navy
approached Newport News after receiving congressional approval and
asked the company ``to propose the most cost-effective carrier
construction schedule, to include those they were already working
on.''
   ``The company responded that a 30-month interval between ship
deliveries would be more efficient than the 24-month interval that
was originally set for Lincoln and Washington,'' said Cole.
   ``At no cost to the government, we have accepted a 30-month
interval between the Lincoln and Washington as well as a 30-month
interval between deliveries for the two that will follow.''
   Jack Schnaedter, a spokesman for Newport News, said the company
``proposed a 30-month interval because we think that will be the
optimum for ensuring workforce stability _ avoiding big
fluctuations.''
   ``It's really just a matter of keeping the workforce stable,
that's all, as we move from one carrier to the next,'' he said.
   The Navy estimates the Lincoln and Washington will cost a total
of $6.12 billion, while the two follow-on carriers ordered this
year will cost an estimated $6.325 billion.
   Newport News receives slightly more than half of those totals,
with the remainder going for the nuclear reactors and other
equipment purchased separately from other contractors by the Navy.
   The Navy informed Congress of its acceptance of the new delivery
date for the Washington in a quarterly Selected Acquisition Report,
filed Tuesday. The acquisition report is mandated by Congress to
help keep tabs on the cost and production schedules of all major
weapon programs.
   The George Washington will be the sixth Nimitz-class carrier
delivered to the Navy by Newport News.

<HEAD>Graves Give New Insights Into Major Civil War Battle</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Bones, buttons and bullets uncovered at
recently discovered graves near the Antietam battleground in
Western Maryland are providing new details about a pivotal Civil
War battle that included the bloodiest day in American military
history.
   Researchers for the Smithsonian Institution and the U.S.
National Park Service say the graves are of four members of the
famed Irish Brigade from New York.
   The four died Sept. 17, 1862, as wave after wave of Irish
Brigade soldiers smashed against the Confederate line and were cut
down by rifle fire on a day that saw 24,000 soldiers, Union and
Confederate, fall in battle.
   Examination of a shoulder blade and teeth found in one of the
sites shows that a 45-year-old man helped lead the Union charge.
   ``This gentleman was in the front rank as the Irish brigade
tried to dislodge the Confederate troops on that day,'' Stephen
Potter, an archaeologist for the U.S. National Park Service, said
at news conference Wednesday.
   Potter said discovery of ``buck and ball'' ammunition indicates
that the Irish Brigade was not well-armed for the battle it met
that day.
   The Irishmen, he said, were carrying smooth-bore long guns
loaded to fire a marble-sized ball and two buckshot pellets.
   ``These were, in effect, combat shotguns,'' he said, that killed
best at close range.
   Based on the Confederate slugs that killed the 45-year-old New
Yorker, said Potter, the rebels were using rifled long guns that
were lethal from long distances. As a result, he said, the
Confederates were able to kill the Union troops at 200 yards, long
before the Yankees could charge to within the effective range of
their weapons.
   The burial sites were found in April by three amateur
archaeologists searching a field near the boundaries of the
federally owned battleground near Hagerstown, Md. A team from the
Smithsonian and the Park Service excavated the site and sifted tons
of clay soil to find artifacts.
   Dennis F. Frye, Park Service historian, said the Battle of
Antietam, named after the creek which flows through the grounds, is
considered by many to be pivotal in the Civil War. Though it ended
in a draw, Frye said the battle halted the South's first invasion
of the North, persuaded France and England to withhold recognition
of the Confederate government, and encouraged President Lincoln a
few weeks later to issue the Emancipation Proclamation that freed
the slaves.
   The battle also marked the first time that the Union army
retained command of a battleground after a clash with Southern
troops.
   ``It was the bloodiest single day in United States military
history,'' said Frye. ``In 12 hours of fighting, there were four
times more casualties than on D-Day,'' the Allied invasion of
Europe in World War II.
   The battle, which Confederates named the Battle of Sharpsburg _
after the nearest village _ pitted 40,000 Confederate troops under
Gen. Robert E. Lee against 46,000 troops of the Federal Army of the
Potomac, under Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan.
   Though undefeated, Lee withdrew the next day across the Potomac
River into Virginia. McClellan, who had 40,000 troops in reserve,
later was criticized for not attempting to the block the Southern
withdrawal.
   The attack by the Irish brigade came at midday. The Union troops
were sent against a Confederate line dug in along a sunken road.
Within a few hours, bodies were piled like cordwood and that small
road became known to history as ``the bloody lane.''
   Douglas Owsley, a physical anthropologist at the Natural History
museum, said the recently discovered shoulder blade showed evidence
of arthritis and that teeth from the same body were heavily worn.
This suggests, he said, that the soldier was about 45 years of age.
   ``This makes him somewhat unique,'' said Owsley, since most of
the soldiers in the Irish Brigade were young volunteers. Because of
the unusual age, he said there is a chance that the middle-aged
soldier may be identified by name.
   At the same site, researchers also found three Confederate rifle
slugs. From their position, Potter said it was obvious that the
45-year-old New Yorker was hit in the chest by all three slugs.
   The site also included a cross, a religious medal, a cuff button
bearing the New York state crest and a blouse button of the type
used by the Irish Brigade.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Unisys Corp. will plead guilty in federal
court to three counts of labor mischarging on a $9.2 million Army
contract in Arizona, a company spokesman says.
   The contract involves administrative and computer work for the
Army Information Systems Command at Fort Huachuca, Ariz. The case
is not related to the ongoing Pentagon bribery investigation, in
which Unisys also has been mentioned although no charges have been
filed.
   The company's plan to plead guilty to three counts in the
contract probe being conducted by the U.S. attorney's office in
Tucson, Ariz., was outlined in a filing required by the Securities
and Exchange Commission to describe any company actions that might
affect stockholders, according to Bill Beckham, a Unisys spokesman.
   The Unisys-Army probe is one of three federal investigations,
outside of the Pentagon case, made public in a July 19 letter from
Unisys Chairman W. Michael Blumenthal to employees.
   The letter by Blumenthal, who was treasury secretary in the
Carter administration, said the investigations were under way
before the November 1986 merger between the Sperry Corp. and
Burroughs, which created Unisys. The Fort Huachuca contract
involves a former Sperry office in Sierra Vista, Ariz.

<HEAD>Eastern Airlines Defends $30 Million Payment to Continental</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The president of Eastern Airlines says paying
sister carrier Continental Airlines $30 million to hire and train
pilots in the event of a strike is the equivalent of a corporate
``insurance policy.''
   Eastern President Phil Bakes was questioned about the plan
during cross-examination Wednesday by lawyers challenging Eastern's
plan to curtail service to 14 cities and lay off 4,000 employees.
   Three unions are seeking to prove in the case that Texas Air
Corp., the parent company of Eatern and Continental, is trying to
break the power of organized labor at Eastern by transferring
assets of the financially troubled airline to its non-union
subsidiaries, such as Continental.
   Bakes said the $30 million payment to Continental will assure
the company has 400 pilots in case Eastern pilots honor a walkout
by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace
Workers.
   The machinists' union, the Air Line Pilots Association and the
Transport Workers Union obtained an injunction temporarily blocking
Eastern's plans to reduce its service and close its Kansas City hub
by Sept. 1.
   U.S. District Judge Barrington D. Parker is conducting hearings
to determine whether to issue a preliminary injunction.
   The unions also are trying to undermine the company's argument
that the service cutbacks are needed because the airline is short
on cash.
   The unions contend that the planned layoffs cannot take place
unless Eastern negotiates with its employees under the Railway
Labor Act.
   Bakes testified that in addition to the $30 million payment for
pilot hiring and training, Eastern loaned Continental $40 million
in June at an interest rate of 17.5 percent. Asked by the judge to
explain the loan, Bakes said the company didn't want its money to
be idle.
   Eastern wants to concentrate its service along the East Coast
and to the Caribbean and Latin America. Bakes testified earlier
this week that the Kansas City hub has lost money virtually since
Eastern opened it in 1983.
   He testified that the operational changes would save the company
$100 million.

Airborne Division, became the chief U.S. defense representative to
Pakistan in July 1987.
   Pentagon officials said he had accompanied U.S. Ambassador
Arnold L. Raphel and Pakistani President Mohammed Zia ul-Haq
Wednesday on a trip to eastern Pakistan to view a demonstration of
the M-1 tank.
   The Pakistani C-130 transport plane carrying the men exploded
shortly after taking off Wednesday from the city of Bahawalpur,
killing all aboard, according to Pakistan's official radio. The
Pentagon later confirmed that Wassom had been aboard the plane.
   Wassom received numerous honors during his more than 26 years of
active duty, including the Defense Meritorious Service Medal, the
Legion of Merit with Oak Leaf Cluster and the Bronze Star.
   Wassom, who was promoted to general in September 1985, held a
bachelor's degree in industrial arts from Western Kentucky
University and a master's degree in international relations from
George Washington University.
   He also graduated from the U.S. Army Command and General Staff
College and the National War College.
   A native of Rockwood, Tenn., he was trained as an artillery and
missile officer and served in Vietnam. He rose through a variety of
command positions with the 101st Airborne Division in the 1970s
before becoming head of the 528th Army Artillery Group in the U.S.
Army Southern European Task Force in 1980.
   In 1981, Wassom became deputy director of the staff for the
Army's chief of staff in Washington, then in 1983 became the chief
of staff for the 101st at Fort Campbell, Ky. He later served as the
assistant division commander for the 101st before assuming the post
in Pakistan.
   ``He was a very capable guy who was extremely well liked,'' said
one Pentagon official, who asked not to be named.
   ``Everybody respected him,'' added an Army official. ``He was a
comer.''

   Democratic vice presidential candidate
Lloyd Bentsen is aiming his pitch at Democrats who strayed from the
party to vote for Ronald Reagan as he tours his home state on
behalf of the Democratic ticket.
   Although confident of his own popularity in Texas, Bentsen has
to persuade some of his more conservative state supporters to vote
for Michael Dukakis if Democrats are to win the state's 29
electoral votes.
   Bentsen on Wednesday appealed to those voters both in public and
in private, as he traveled from the city of Fort Worth to the
ranching area of San Angelo to a medical center in Lubbock to the
oil town of Tyler.
   ``I know that this county is principally Republican,'' Bentsen
told the 250 people gathered for a picnic at Fort Concho in San
Angelo. ``I also know that Lloyd Bentsen carried this county by 58
percent last time.''
   He told them that Dukakis' selection of a Texan for the ticket
showed the Massachusetts governor was ``reaching out ... ready to
listen to differing viewpoints.''
   He then traveled to Lubbock, where he was greeted at the airport
by a dozen supporters carrying ``Bentsen _ U.S. Senator'' placards
_ but none of the Dukakis-Bentsen signs he'd like to see.
   He attended a demonstration of a new program to diagnose rural
patients via television at the Texas Tech medical center, and then
slipped away to meet with some 200 to 300 longtime supporters of
his Senate campaigns to make his pitch in private. The meeting was
closed to the press.
   Later, in Tyler, he met with another support group _ again out
of the view of reporters. And again, Bentsen's Senate paraphernalia
was in abundance but nothing for the Dukakis-Bentsen ticket.
   Robert Cargill of nearby Longview, one of those invited for the
dinner sponsored by East Texans for Texas, said Dukakis' addition
of Bentsen to the ticket might be enough for him to support it.
   ``Maybe,'' he said.
   Bentsen is also explaining to his constituents, both in his
appearances and through television ads, why he is running at the
same time for re-election to his Senate seat.
   Texas law allows him to do that, and if he didn't his Republican
opponent, Rep. Beau Boulter, would automatically win a six-year
term. If he won both races, Bentsen could resign from the Senate
and force a special election, giving the Democrats a chance to hold
the seat.
   As he traveled, Bentsen was peppered with questions about his
personal wealth and his health, as a result of the release of
records Monday by his Washington office.
   The disclosures showed the 67-year-old senator is in good
health, although he has been treated for high cholesterol. His
financial records revealed he has earned more than $3.8 million
over the past five years, but they don't disclose his net worth.
   ``I don't know what my net worth is,'' he said. ``Frankly, I
haven't made out a financial statement that has given me my net
worth in a number of years.''
   As he's been hunting for conservative votes, Bentsen also has
been taking some shots at Republican George Bush's choice for a
running mate, Indiana Sen. Dan Quayle.
   ``I guess we'll have an early season on quail,'' he told
reporters.
   Bentsen brushed aside the age difference between him and the
41-year-old Quayle.
   ``It's not the miles on you, it's the depth of the tread,'' he
said.

   Democratic presidential nominee Michael
Dukakis and former rival Jesse Jackson are scheduled to appear
together next week for the first time since the Democratic National
Convention last month, a Dukakis aide says.
   Dukakis and Jackson plan to attend a march marking the 25th
anniversary of the civil rights march in Washington, D.C., by
Martin Luther King Jr. They plan to march together, Dukakis aide
Donna Brazile said.
   Jackson endorsed Dukakis at the convention and has spoken to the
Massachusetts governor by telephone several times in the month
since the convention. But Dukakis and aides for weeks have been
unable to say when the two would campaign together.
   Brazile said she expected Coretta Scott King, the widow of the
slain civil rights leader, to march with Jackson and Dukakis.

<HEAD>South Carolina Reactor Shut Down After Power Surge</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Department of Energy has moved to shut
down a nuclear reactor used in weapons production in the wake of a
power surge that occurred last week while operators were seeking to
restart the reactor.
   Ernest C. Baynard III, assistant secretary for environment,
safety and health, said Wednesday night that the incident involved
the P-Reactor, one of three reactors located at the Savannah River
Plant in South Carolina.
   ``They're bringing it down to zero power level,'' he said.
   The two other Savannah River weapons reactors also are shut down
_ one of them for a scheduled maintenance outage and the other due
to safety concerns.
   Baynard said the government is particularly concerned that
operators of the reactor continued building up power despite the 2
percent ``power spike'' _ an abrupt and unexpected increase in
temperature and pressure.
   ``In simple terms, it's not the machine that bothers me so much
as the reaction of the people running it,'' he said. ``So we've had
a lot of discussion with them (Savannah River Plant officials)
about what we need to do here.''
   In Aiken, S.C., a spokesman for the Du Pont Co., which operates
the complex for the Energy Department, said the reactor had been
shut down while an independent review panel investigates the Aug.
7-9 restart process.
   The spokesman, Clif Webb, said the review panel has ``questions
and concerns'' about the operators' decision to continue to build
power in the reactor although there were indications of problems in
maintaining a nuclear reaction.
   According to Webb, the reactor was shut down Aug. 9, then
restarted briefly after tests showed that the problem was a buildup
of helium in the reactor vessel.
   Du Pont then proposed this week that the reactor be shut down
early for routine testing that had been scheduled for September, so
that the reactor would be out of service while the review panel
studied the restart incident, Webb said.
   Jim Gaver, an Energy Department spokesman at the Savannah River
Plant, said Wednesday night that the concern of the oversight panel
``is not whether that restart process was safe, but a question
about the procedures and the contractor's checks and balances.''
   The concern is whether it would have been more prudent to
examine unusual reactor readings at a lower power level, Gaver said.

   Fire swept toward the Sacred Valley of the
Incas and forced the closing of a world famous Andes hiking trail,
and police arrested a campesino for allegedly starting the blaze, a
Civil Defense official said.
   About 550 military and civilian firefighters were sent Wednesday
to the isolated zone between Machu Picchu and Cuzco, in the
2-mile-high Andes about 330 miles southeast of Lima, Civil Defense
spokeswomen Rebeca Anaya said.
   Flames cut a swath up to a half-mile wide and 13 miles long
through grass and forest-covered mountainsides.
   The mountaintop Inca ruins of Machu Picchu, one of Latin
America's most famous tourist attractions, have not been threatened
by the fire, which started just four miles south of the site,
officials said.
   Anaya said winds pushed the flames away from Machu Picchu
southeast toward the Urubamba River valley, known as the Sacred
Valley of the Incas for the dozens of ruins there. But she said the
fire forced closure of the trail leading to Machu Picchu.
   She said police arrested an area campesino for starting the
blaze in an attempt to clear land for planting.
   There have been no reports of injuries to humans in the fire.

<HEAD>50 Years Later, Martians Again Invade Airwaves</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK HAMPSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Martians landed in central New Jersey and
swept north toward New York City, tearing up rail, phone and power
lines, crushing houses and trees, slaughtering thousands of
soldiers sent to stop them.
   The invaders' apparent objective, broadcaster Douglas Edwards
intoned Wednesday, was to ``crush resistance, paralyze
communication and disorganize human society.''
   ``Very bad news, Doug,'' said his colleague, Steve Allen.
   Maybe, but nothing to worry about.
   Fifty years after Orson Welles caused national hysteria with his
radio drama ``The War of the Worlds,'' Martians are again invading
the airwaves in a new production based on H.G. Wells' novel.
   ``This is not a nostalgia piece,'' director David Ossman said
before Allen and Edwards taped their parts in the drama, which will
be broadcast Oct. 30 on public radio stations. ``It's supposed to
be realistic and contemporary. (The listener) should react as if
it's really happening.''
   Some changes have been made in Howard Koch's original script:
Intercontinental Radio News has become Satellite News. Crowded
interstate highways have replaced parkways, and lasers, Amtrak and
jet fighter planes have been added, as have interviews with
contemporary figures such as science fiction writer Ray Bradbury
and scientist Carl Sagan.
   And news of the invasion is broadcast to the nation not by the
secretary of the interior, as in 1938, but by the vice president.
He is not identified by name, but he has just returned from Texas,
where he was preparing for a final pre-election campaign rally.
Plans call for an actor to mimic George Bush.
   Although Welles' production included a mild disclaimer _ it was
introduced as a radio play at the beginning and before intermission
_ the new version will have none.
   ``We're going to go seamlessly onto the air,'' said producer
Judith Walcutt. Alluding to the fact that Welles was not punished
50 years ago, she said, ``At least there's no precedent for suing
the producer.''
   Welles' role, that of astronomer Richard Pierson, will be played
by Jason Robards. Other players include Scott Simon and Terry Gross
of National Public Radio.
   The adaptation of Koch's original script is not without humor.
After the vice president's address, Edwards intones, ``This action
may prove to be an asset to his standing in the polls.''
   Edwards recorded his part in Jacksonville, Fla., while Allen did
his simultaneously at WNYC radio, later moving to a rooftop near
Wall Street for a final broadcast in which he is overcome by poison
smoke unleashed by the Martians.
   The entertainer said he was one of those fooled in 1938.
   ``I didn't hear the beginning of the show,'' Allen said. ``I was
17, and I was on the ninth floor of a run-down hotel on the near
North Side of Chicago with my mother and aunt. Take three otherwise
normal people who believe the world is about to end, turn them
loose in Chicago, and you have a situation comedy.
   ``We raced down the hall and pressed the elevator buzzer. The
gentleman running the elevator opened the door with a big smile
that quickly faded, because he became hip we were coo-coo. My aunt
said, `They're up in the air!' He said, `Who is?'''
   However gullible the audience this time around, Ossman _ whose
baby son Orson was present for the taping _ said he expected no
hysteria. ``Instead of frightening people, it will give them a lot
of fun.''

<TEXT>
   A demonstration by a group of ``skinheads''
sparked a shouting match with a group of young Republicans who
briefly were aligned against them with some anarchists in town for
the GOP convention.
   Emotions ran so high during the confrontation Wednesday at
Lafayette Square that 50 police officers stood two-deep to protect
the skinheads while they held forth on a stage, promoting their
separatist beliefs.
   One person was arrested later as the skinheads were escorted
from the park by a phalanx of police.
   The stage and a sound system were set up for demonstrations
during the Republican National Convention, but _ as has been the
case all week _ neither GOP politics nor presidential nominee
George Bush was a topic.
   The afternoon's bitter exchanges were the most heated at the
stage in three days of demonstrations.
   Most of the protests have been uneventful with many of the
90-minute time slots for demonstrations going unclaimed.
   The skinheads, with shaved heads, military boots and camouflage
pants, railed Wednesday against minorities, blaming blacks, Jews
and Hispanics for the world's ills.
   The crowd shouted back, ``No fascists, no KKK!''
   One cluster in the crowd, carrying signs denouncing fascism and
Nazism, was joined in chants by the college-aged Republicans, some
of whom were wearing suits, with their green guest passes to the
convention still hanging around their necks.
   Then about 20 members of a third group calling themselves
anarchists showed up with anti-racist leaflets and joined in the
shouting.
   The anarchists have been at the stage during the week with their
own ``guerrilla theater,'' advocating a dismantling of government
in favor of community rule.
   The exchanges grew more and more heated as the skinheads on
stage harangued the audience with denunciations of minorities.
   The young Republicans jeered and called the skinheads communists.
   The people on stage responded that those out front were
ignorant, prompting cries of ``Nazi scum.''
   ``We stand behind our separatist beliefs,'' a speaker retorted.
``Segregation is the only way.''
   A small number of passersby laughed in disbelief.
   After the demonstration ended, about 25 of the police encircled
the half-dozen skinheads and escorted them safely to their cars two
blocks away.
   Earlier, the young Republicans had jeered gay activitists who
called for stepped-up efforts to fight AIDs.

<HEAD>Rising GOP Right-Wing Star Hits Dukakis</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Texas Sen. Phil Gramm, one of the potential
leaders of the Republican right wing, delivered a blistering
declaration to party delegates that Michael Dukakis would ``wimp
America and endanger peace.''
   The senator from Bush's adopted home state praised George Bush
as ``the greatest vice president this nation has ever had'' as he
placed Bush's name in nomination Wednesday before the convention
roll call.
   But Gramm, a Democrat-turned-Republican widely assumed to have
presidential aspirations, turned the focus back on the Democratic
nominee on a night that was otherwise devoted to Bush.
   ``He taxed the poor, taxed the rich, taxed the young, taxed the
old and taxed the middle class,'' Gramm said of Dukakis. ``He taxed
businesses, and he taxed families.''
   He said Dukakis broke his promise to voters in his first term as
governor of Massachusetts by raising taxes, and in his second term
increased state spending and brought on Massachusetts' $400 million
deficit. He said Dukakis has opposed ``every major new weapons
system that we have deployed.''
   Gramm elicited loud shouts of ``no'' from the delegates as he
asked:
   ``Given his record, is there anybody here who doubts that a
President Dukakis would raise our taxes?
   ``Is there anybody here who doubts that a President Dukakis
would spend our workers into poverty?
   ``Is there anybody here who doubts that a President Dukakis
would cut defense, wimp America and endanger peace?''
   Gramm's selection to deliver Bush's nominating speech added a
touch of Texas to the Republican convention as a counterpoint to
the heavy Texas influence of the Democratic convention in Atlanta
last month. It was the Texas delegation's vote _ by arrangement _
that gave Bush the delegate majority and the presidential
nomination during the roll call.
   In Atlanta, the podium was filled with Texans in the Democrats'
calculated effort to win that major electoral state in the fall _ a
plan capped by the selection of Gramm's senior colleague in the
Senate, Lloyd Bentsen, as the Democratic vice presidential nominee.
   Gramm, best known nationally for the Gramm-Rudman
deficit-reduction law, became a Republican only five years ago. He
bolted the Democratic Party as a congressman, rejecting it as not
conservative enough, and won election to the Senate in his new
party.
   He was disqualified by the U.S. Constitution from joining the
ticket as Bush's running mate by their shared Texas home. As a
favorite of many in the GOP's most conservative wing, Gramm is
considered a likely presidential candidate in 1982, should Bush
falter _ although Bush's elevation of running mate Dan Quayle to
the upper reaches of party leadership may displace him.
   The nominating speech, delivering Gramm a prime-time television
audience and his most visible party platform, triggered a planned,
flag-waving demonstration on the floor of the massive Superdome
convention hall as 50,000 bright balloons fell from the high
ceiling.

   A popular picnic spot on the outskirts of Minsk
was a killing field during the purges of Josef Stalin and contains
the graves of 500 people shot during the dictator's bloody reign,
according to Soviet news reports.
   Moscow News said Wednesday that a recent report in a
Byelorussian newspaper about the discovery of the graves in Kurpati
Forest, outside the Byleorussian capital of Minsk, had ``stirred
the whole republic.''
   ``From 1937 to 1941, every day they shot people who were brought
here by cars,'' according to Moscow News, a weekly at the forefront
of Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy of glasnost, or
openness.
   The thickly forested area of about 32 acres was surrounded
during the 1930s and 1940s by a solid wood fence topped by barbed
wire, witnesses said.
   ``Residents of surrounding villages tried to bypass this
terrible place where from which day and night were heard shots,
screams, cries and pleadings,'' Moscow News said.
   One witness was quoted as saying people were shot in batches and
that dogs guarded the area.
   The fence surrounding the forest was eventually taken down and
in recent times the site was a favorite place for city-dwellers,
unaware of the bloody past of the area, to rest and have picnics.
   Stalin launched a bloody purge against Byelorussians in June
1937.
   ``The Great Terror,'' Robert Conquest's chronicle of Stalin's
purges, says many Byelorussian officials, writers and other
cultural figures were accused of being Polish spies or otherwise
anti-Soviet and expelled from the Communist Party. Many were
arrested and executed.
   The espionage charges and other allegations touched industrial
enterprises, the Academy of Sciences, the banks, cement industry,
bread supply organization and railways, Conquest wrote.
   Western historians estimate up to 20 million people were killed
in Stalin's purges. There is no breakdown on the number of victims
in Byelorussia.
   Moscow News said the Byelorussian government and prosecutors
office launched an investigation after the newspaper of the
republic's writers' union published a report on the discovery.
   Moscow News did not say when the discovery was made or when the
Byelorussian newspaper article appeared.
   A government commission exhumed human remains and found 500
graves at Kurpati. Investigators also discovered signs of a
previous exhumation and are trying to learn who was responsible,
Moscow News said.
   Some of the graves were destroyed when a gas pipeline was run
through Kurpati and a road built, the newspaper said.

   The Minuteman statue, a symbol of revolutionary
readiness, appears to have retreated a bit under a barrage of heat
and humidity.
   A black resinous substance has dripped from the musket of the
113-year-old statue, making it appear as if the Minuteman melted
beneath the 90-degree plus heat, officials said Wednesday.
   ``When it gets hot, and I expect the inside of that statue must
be very hot, the substance liquefies,'' said Bob Nash,
superintendent of the Minute Man National Historic Park in Concord.
   The most likely explanation is that a material applied to the
monument in 1975 to make a protective plaster casting of the
monument seeped into the statue and has been liquefied by heat and
humidity, said Ed McManus, a National Park Service conservator in
Boston.
   ``It's rabbit skin glue that got into the interior of the
gunstock, the musket stock, when molds were made to reproduce the
statue in plaster,'' McManus said. ``The rabbit skin glue is
soluble, so that's dissolving and dripping out.''
   The glue was often used in the 1970s to generate casts of
delicate sculptures. The substance is applied as a liquid and then
hardens, creating an impression that is then transferred to plaster.
   This summer is the second time the substance has leaked, Nash
said.
   McManus said rainwater has built up in the statue, which was
cast in sections, and the resulting humidity made the resin run. He
said the substance doesn't pose any threat to the monument, but the
statue probably will be cleaned out.
   ``It's primarily a cosmetic problem,'' he said.
   The Minuteman statue was sculpted in 1874 by Daniel Chester
French, who later designed the statue of a seated Abraham Lincoln
at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C.
   The Concord statue depicts the citizen-soldier, a musket in one
hand and a plow in the other, surveying the Old North Bridge. In
1775, a small group of Minutemen, nicknamed for the time it took
them to prepare for battle, drove British soldiers off the bridge.
   Concord draws on the battle for its claim as the birthplace of
the American Revolution.

   The northern spotted owl, an elusive denizen of
virgin forests in the Northwest, has emerged to silence chain saws
in big sections of ancient timber stands of Washington and Oregon.
   Prodded by environmental groups, the U.S. Forest Service intends
this fall to approve a ban on logging and other development in
347,700 of the 1.3 million acres of old-growth forest within 13
national forests in the two states, government and environmental
officials said Wednesday.
   The plan, aimed at protecting the spotted owl and other wildlife
from the effects of logging in their unique forest habitat, has
drawn sharp criticism from the timber industry.
   Timber spokesmen contend that the spotted owl needs no such
protection, and that the move is just one of several environmental
steps to cripple or shut down the industry, which is in the midst
of a record cutting year.
   Old-growth timber, which is anywhere from 200 to 600 years old,
is prized by the industry for its higher-quality grain. Old-growth
species include cedar, hemlock, Douglas fir and spruce.
   ``I see it as one more thing by those who are trying to put the
timber industry out of business,'' said Bob Dick, a spokesman for
the Washington Forest Protection Association, a pro-timber
organization based in Olympia. ``When is enough enough? When do we
stop setting things aside and start managing what we have?''
   An environmentalist said steps to protect the owl, which will
nest only in the ancient trees, and its forest habitat probably
will protect neither in the long run.
   ``The future of the Northwest ancient forests is dire unless
Forest Service policies are changed,'' said Jean Durning, the
Northwest regional director of the Wilderness Society. ``There is
far less ancient forest left than the Forest Service has recognized.
   ``And clear-cuts are being plopped into the middle of extensive
stands so fast that in very few years we will have no major intact
stretches of ancient forest.''
   Logging companies this year expect to equal last year's all-time
highest yield of nearly 5 billion board feet from the national
forests of Washington and Oregon, which produce up to half the
timber taken from the nation's public forest lands.
   The owl-protection plan is scheduled to be signed soon by Forest
Service chief F. Dale Robertson, said Grant Gunderson, an agency
wildlife biologist based in Portland, Ore., who helped write the
plan. A 30-day period in which the public may comment began Aug. 11.
   The Forest Service's goal is to protect the native habitat of
not only the spotted owl, but a broad array of other wildlife,
Gunderson said.
   The owl is the focus of the Forest Service's plan because it is
viewed by federal wildlife biologists as as the best ``indicator
species'': If the owl's habitat is protected, then many other
wildlife in the same ecosystem also will thrive, they said.
   Despite warnings from environmentalists, the U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service does not include the spotted owl on its list of
endangered species. The Forest Service believes that about 1,600
pairs live in Northwest forests.
   The owl and other wildlife in old-growth forests already are
protected from development in 751,000 acres of old-growth forest
designated as federal wilderness areas or set aside for research,
said Sandy Knight, another Forest Service biologist, who is based
in Washington state.
   The Forest Service chose to set aside additional acreage to
protect the owl only after several environmental organizations
filed a complaint with the Department of Agriculture in 1984,
contending that failure to protect the spotted owl would violate
the National Forest Management Act of 1976 by failing to maintain
viable populations of native wildlife, Durning said.
   The timber industry, however, considers closure of the areas in
question an overreaction. ``We see this as just one more chink in
the land base we have to have to meet timber demand,'' Dick said.
   The Forest Service calculates that the net effect of the
protection plan will reduce by about 5 percent Northwest forest
land available for timber harvest, for a loss of 163 million board
feet.

   A noisy but healthy baby boy was found
abandoned in a Roman Catholic church after his bawling disrupted a
Mass in an adjoining chapel.
   The infant, about 15 months old and 35 pounds, was discovered
Monday morning at the foot of an altar in St. Dominic's Church,
officials said.
   ``There was no note, no bag of clothing. Just the little guy,''
said Michael Hancock, an investigator for the San Francisco
Department of Social Services.
   The Rev. LaSalle Hallissey said the child appeared to have been
well cared-for.
   The baby was dressed in blue overalls and wore a gold bracelet
inscribed with the name ``Austin.'' After an examination at San
Francisco General Hospital, he was taken to the Children's Home
Society to await placement in a foster home pending an
investigation.
   Investigators said they had few leads to the child's parents,
although at least two witnesses said they saw a woman near the
altar Wednesday morning. Hallissey said he recalled seeing a
``youngish, stylishly dressed woman.''

   Two bank robbers fled West Germany
in a hijacked bus Thursday after killing a teen-age hostage, then
escaped with another hostage in a car provided by Dutch officials,
police said.
   The bandits had taken 25 people hostage in the bus, which
crossed the border into the Netherlands early Thursday. They
released two women and three children but demanded a getaway car in
return for the freedom of the remaining captives, Dutch police
spokesman Jan Houdel said.
   Houdel told The Associated Press that at about 6:30 a.m., the
hijackers sped off in a BMW provided by Dutch authorities and
headed west. About 30 minutes earlier, two captives on the bus were
injured when the bandits fired two shots, Houdel said. Their
conditions were not immediately known.
   The other captives escaped after the hijackers left the bus, he
said.
   Houdel said Dutch police were in pursuit of the car. There was
no information on the person still held captive.
   West German police spokesman Horst Fechner said a 15-year-old
boy shot Wednesday night had died in a Bremen hospital, where he
was taken after being dumped at a highway rest area. His identity
was not released.
   Fechner also said a West German police officer died in a car
crash while pursuing the bus. No further details were immediately
available.
   Reporters who had been following the bus after it left Bremen
earlier Wednesday said the young man was shot at about 11 p.m. (5
p.m. EDT), after police at the rest area grabbed a woman who
apparently was an accomplice of the bank robbers.
   Two hostages taken when the gunmen robbed a bank Tuesday in
Gladbeck were freed at the rest area.
   As the bus roared back onto the highway, the gunmen opened fire
inside the vehicle, their bullets smashing windows, Associated
Press photographer Peter Maer said.
   ``They started firing wildly,'' said Maer.
   Many passengers could be seen standing in the back of the bus,
Maer said, but he did not know whether the bandits were shooting at
the hostages or just at the windows.
   Police grabbed the woman at the rest area, then one of the
bandits aimed his gun at the young man's head and fired, reporters
at the scene said. Two passengers pulled the victim out of the bus
and left him on the ground, they added.
   Earlier Wednesday, the gunmen had seized the vehicle at a bus
stop in Bremen. They drove off three hours later with about 25
hostages aboard after freeing five elderly passengers.
   The ZDF television network showed film of one bandit, identified
by law officials as 31-year-old Hans-Juergen Roesner, holding his
pistol against the head of a small girl outside the bus in Bremen.
   Captor and hostage then re-entered the bus, and the vehicle left
the bus stop at 9:50 p.m. (3:40 p.m. EDT).
   Journalists reported seeing the bus drive onto the highway
connecting Bremen and Hamburg minutes later.
   Earlier, Roesner used the bus radio to demand a fast getaway car
with a handcuffed policeman as hostage inside, or else ``there
would be shooting,'' according to police spokesman Hermann Scholz
and ZDF.
   About 100 heavily armed police officers, many with pistols drawn
and crouched behind cars, had been surrounding the bus in Bremen.
   Roesner radioed during the Bremen siege that he and his partner
had been joined by a woman friend, and witnesses said the woman was
also armed.
   Lawmen identified Roesner's male accomplice as 32-year-old
Dieter Degowski. They did not know who the woman companion was.
   Scholz said that after five passengers were freed, unhurt,
Roesner offered to let the rest of them go. In exchange, he
demanded that a police officer be left inside a getaway car,
handcuffed and wearing only a bathing suit to make sure he carried
no weapon, the spokesman said.
   In an interview with ZDF earlier in the evening, Roesner also
demanded $157,000 to $210,000.
   ``If our demands our not met, there will be shooting,'' Roesner
said.
   On Tuesday, the two gunmen fled a bank in Gladbeck, about 135
miles southeast of Bremen, with two hostage bank employees and
$227,000 in a police-supplied automobile.
   Police lost the trail after the robbers switched cars.
   The two gunmen surfaced in Bremen, walking into a vegetable
market, firing shots which hurt no one and taking a woman hostage,
said another police spokesman, who spoke on condition he not be
identified.
   Minutes later, at about 7 p.m. (1 p.m. EDT), ``with the new
hostage they went by foot to a bus stop and climbed into a bus with
about 30 people on board,'' said the spokesman.
   From time to time, Roesner left the stationary bus, parked not
far from the Bremen airport, to talk to reporters.
   He said he was ``totally ticked off'' that police had not given
up their search. He also warned against any attempt by police to
storm the bus.
   ``We have guns, too,'' Roesner said.

Discussion</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   In the battle of insults the Democrats are
ahead to stay. Republican convention scriptwriters say that's all
right, claiming they have sworn off name-calling in favor of
something called comparative comment.
   The GOP line is a fine one. Invisible, in fact.
   ``Comparative discussion on the issues is not negative,'' said
Lee Atwater, Bush's campaign manager. Comparative discussion means
that before denouncing Michael Dukakis, Republican orators speak
highly of George Bush.
   At their Atlanta convention, the Democrats volleyed insults at
Bush. He was born with a silver foot in his mouth, he was a
toothache of a man. Bush was born on third base and thinks he
tripled.
   ``Where was George?'' the Democrats chanted.
   Republicans said their convention would skip epithets in favor
of substance, an admirable resolve and probably a good idea since
they show little knack for pithy putdowns.
   The quotable political insult is a one-liner. Republican insults
tend to take longer.
   Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas did manage a quickie Wednesday night,
calling the Democratic presidential nominee ``one of those liberals
with strange ideas _ Dukak-eyed ideas _ yes Dukak-eyed ideas _
about the way the world works.''
   But Dole is the Republicans' wisecracker. He said he'd called
Sen. Dan Quayle, the youthful GOP vice presidential candidate and
found him shaving, ``for the first time.''
   More typical are orators like Alexander Haig, the defeated
presidential candidate, who told the convention that the Democratic
ticket is like a bat, ``flying erratically for brief periods at low
levels and hanging upside down for extended periods in dark, damp
caves up to its navel in guano.'' Bush monitors tried to get Haig
to tone down his talk, but he wouldn't.
   Or the double bank shot of Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas, who said
the Democrats weren't nasty to Bush ``because they're tacky, nasty
low-rent people'' but, rather, because they are trying to avoid the
real issues.
   Jerry Curry, running for Congress in Virginia Beach, Va., got a
moment on the platform and used it to say ``I suspect that neither
Dukakis nor Jim Wright ever met a Communist they didn't love ...''
That harks back to themes of another, unpleasant political era, but
it passed with scant notice.
   ``The question is not where's George,'' said Sen. Alan Simpson
of Wyoming. ``The question is who's Mike?'' That invited a chant,
but there was none. Apparently these Republicans are not into
responsive readings.
   Dukakis said he didn't think the GOP shots would do him any
political harm. He's already unloaded what Atwater called the
Oscar-winner of offensive remarks, blaming President Reagan for
ethical shortcomings in the administration. ``The fish rots from
the head first,'' Dukakis said.
   ``That is the yardstick,'' said Atwater. ``I'll guarantee you
will not see that kind of invective coming out of here.''
   But outrage _ scripted outrage _ is another matter. ``I'll be
damned if I will stand by and let anyone with a smirk and a sneer
discredit ... George Bush,'' former President Gerald R. Ford told
the convention in rebuttal to Sen. Edward M. Kennedy's ``Where was
George?'' taunt.
   Later, Ford said he hadn't identified Kennedy because ``I
couldn't remember the name of that creature.'' He also called
Kennedy ``some non-entity.'' Those are not memorable gibes, but
it's a beginning.
   New Jersey Gov. Thomas Kean, the keynote speaker who didn't get
to the microphone until the convention was half over, used a show
business simile for his keynote insult. ``The Dukakis Democrats
will try to talk tough,'' he said. ``But don't be fooled. They may
talk like Dirty Harry but they will still act like Pee Wee Herman.''
   Dirty Harry is the tough cop played by actor Clint Eastwood. Pee
Wee Herman is a squeaky-voiced movie and television weakling, or
wimp.
   While Kean's was a better-than-average GOP taunt, the need for
an explanatory footnote illustrates one of the insult problems in
New Orleans. Snide political remarks lose punch when they have to
be explained. GOP remarks often need explanation.
   Sen. Gramm, placing Bush's name in presidential nomination
Wednesday night, seized the dreaded wimp issue, making the word
into a verb and using it to slap the ``amnesia merchants'' of the
Democratic ticket.
   ``Is there anybody here who doubts that a President Dukakis
would cut defense, wimp America and endanger peace?'' he asked.
   Score two for Gramm because that is inventive as well as
insulting. Until he commandeered ``wimp,'' the ``W'' word had been
used by Bush's detractors and avoided by his fans.

   The National Weather Service says areas
throughout the United States hit by drought, high heat or the
threat of forest fires will continue to suffer.
   The service's 30-day forecast for mid-August to mid-September,
released Wednesday, said the Dakotas, Nebraska, Iowa and the
western Great Lakes area, the farming heartland already withered by
drought will continue to be dry.
   The same area, and the Eastern region from North Carolina to
Maine, also are expected to continue to endure higher-than-normal
temperatures, while the risk of forest fires will continue high in
the timberlands from Minnesota west to Washington and south through
California the weather service said. It warned that the risk will
be ``extreme'' for parts of Wymoning, Montana, Idaho, Oregon,
Nevada and California.
   Higher than normal rainfall is predicted for the Texas-Louisiana
Gulf Coast and for the Southeast, from Florida to North Carolina,
the weather service said.

<HEAD>25th Anniversary March Aimed At Reviving King's `Dream'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Organizers of a march to commemorate the
largest civil rights demonstration in U.S. history say they want to
revive the vision set Martin Luther King Jr. set forth in his ``I
have a dream'' speech 25 years ago.
   The Rev. Joseph E. Lowery, president of the Southern Christian
Leadership Conference and a chief planner of the commemorative
march said many people who attended the 1963 ``March on
Washington'' with King are concerned about the state of the dream.
   ``While the dream has been realized in some respects,'' he told
a news conference on Wednesday, ``in other aspects it has been
deferred, it is in a holding pattern.''
   Leaders of the march will call for legislation to relieve
poverty and joblessness, improve housing and human rights and
combat drugs and AIDS, the acquired immune deficiency syndrome,
Lowery said. They also will urge a moratorium on testing of nuclear
weapons and stiffer sanctions against South Africa.
   Organizers said they expected about 100,000 people to attend the
march Aug. 27.

<HEAD>Insurance Group Reduced Payments To Hopsitals</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new study indicates that changes by the
federal government and efforts by the Blue Cross and Blue Shield
health insurance plans to contain hospital costs may be working.
   According to the study released Wednesday the private payers
reduced their payments to hospitals by $4.8 billion over a
three-year period.
   The study appears to counter claims made in 1983 when the
federal government changed the way it reimbursed hospitals for
Medicare patients and experts predicted that would result in
hospitals recouping losses from private insurors such as Blue Cross.
   Richard Scheffler, a California health economist who conducted
the study, covering the years 1983 to 1986, said hospitals tended
to apply the guidelines set under Medicare's prospective payment
system to their private patients as well.
   ``It (the prospective payment system) ended up profoundly
changing the overall operation of the hospital,'' Scheffler told a
news conference.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   He said some of the savings realized by Blue Cross and Blue
Shield plans resulted from Medicare-driven changes at hospitals and
some from the private insurors's own cost-containment strategies.

   Soprano Angelina Reaux confidently mixes acting
with singing Kurt Weill songs in ``Stranger Here Myself,'' now
running at the off-Broadway Susan Stein Shiva Theater in the Public
Theater complex.
   Her full-bodied operatic voice is sure and attractive and her
acting isn't overdone. Her show is effective to a degree but isn't
a completely rewarding evening of theater. The ingredient that's
missing is the ability to convey the emotion of the songs through
the sound of her voice.
   The stage is set as a hotel room with a few small tables, lamps,
a chair and a red spread on the bed. Miss Reaux wears a black
dress, has a small, battered suitcase. She sings one song after
another, not making a story line, but acting each of them.
   In ``The Barbara Song'' from ``The Threepenny Opera,'' when she
recounts saying no to men but not saying no to Macheath, she lies
on the bed and grabs the headboard as though she's in bondage.
   In the title song, ``I'm a Stranger Here Myself,'' with its
catchy melody and lyrics by Ogden Nash, from ``One Touch of
Venus,'' she's tipsy while really delivering the song. The next,
``Surabaya Johnny,'' has her whimpering, reaching toward a bottle
of pills, apparently considering suicide. Then she lightens the
mood again with ``Foolish Heart,'' also from ``One Touch of Venus.''
   Her operatic voice is perfect for ``Lonely House'' from ``Street
Scene'' but low-down irony is needed for ``Solomon Song'' from
``Threepenny Opera'' and Miss Reaux doesn't deliver it.
   There are survivors in Kurt Weill songs, there's tragedy,
heartbreak, abuse, hopeless love, daydreams of ships coming in and
rescuing a life. They're greatly to be enjoyed by people who like
strong songs instead of wimpy ones; they're enjoyed less by people
who prefer upbeat sentiments and situations.
   Miss Reaux has sung a great deal for conductor Leonard
Bernstein, which is a strong recommendation. Her show, which had
three instrumentalists, was directed by Christopher Alden.
   However, anybody who has heard Teresa Stratas, also an opera
singer, sing Weill knows that she can be bawdy, despairing,
misguided, hard-hearted or swaggeringly stoical just through the
sound of her voice. That has a stronger impact that Miss Reaux
singing as she acts out the songs' sentiments.

<TEXT>
   U.S. and Soviet officials say their
historic joint nuclear weapons test explosion could be the first
step toward a world without atomic bombs.
   Wednesday's Joint Verification Experiment was the culmination of
a four-year effort to slow the nuclear arms race and a product of
better U.S.-Soviet relations.
   It was the first time Soviet scientists joined their American
counterparts in the control room at the top-secret Nevada Test Site
to monitor a nuclear weapons explosion. Forty-five American
scientists and diplomats will gather similar data Sept. 14 at the
Soviet's Semipalatinsk test site.
   The detonation beneath this picturesque, 7,500-foot mesa had 12
times the force of the Hiroshima bomb. The scientists watched the
surface affects of the underground explosion, 30 miles away, by
television.
   ``It was a resounding success,'' said James Magruder, the test
controller for the experiment dubbed Kearsarge.
   The blast registered 5.4 on the Richter scale of ground movement
at the National Earthquake Information Center in Golden, Colo., and
caused some high-rise hotels in Las Vegas, 100 miles away, to sway.
   C. Paul Robinson, the U.S. ambassador to the negotiations that
led to the test, called the test ``a step down the road to a more
stable world.''
   ``How far we go depends on what we negotiate on weapons
themselves,'' Robinson said. ``I hope we can take the process to
the point where there is no need for weapons at all.''
   Igor Palenykh, head of the Soviet delegation to the talks in
Geneva, told reporters that the Soviet Union's goal is a total ban
on nuclear testing.
   ``As far as the Soviet Union is concerned we are prepared at any
time to cease nuclear testing along with the United States,'' he
said through an interpreter.
   About 35 anti-nuclear protesters turned out at the gates of the
1,350-square-mile site and 12 were cited for trespassing or
blocking traffic, then released.
   The size of the blast was listed officially as between 100 and
150 kilotons.
   The ability to measure the size of U.S. and Soviet tests is
critical in monitoring treaties signed in 1974 and 1976 limiting
the size of nuclear tests to no more than 150 kilotons. The
treaties were never ratified by the U.S. Senate.
   Thirty seconds after detonation, Viktor Mikhailov, leader of the
Soviet scientific team, answered a phone and raised his right hand
with an OK signal, indicating the Soviets had received the data
they were seeking from their monitoring equipment. Mikhailov's
signal was greeted with applause.
   U.S. and Soviet scientists monitored the test with sophisticated
equipment housed in unmanned trailers a few hundred yards from
ground zero.
   Later, Mikhailov joined scientists, diplomats and military
officials from the two superpowers at a crowded news conference.
   Mikhailov said he had been apprehensive about coming to the
United States and meeting his counterparts. But, he said, he grew
to trust and respect the Americans and felt the feeling was mutual.
   ``We have cut a window into their hearts,'' he said of the U.S.
scientists he has worked with since spring.
   The test, he said, could play a major role ``in the path leading
to a nuclear-free world.''
   The Soviet scientists first visited Las Vegas and the test site
last January a month after an agreement by President Reagan and
Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev cleared the way for such exchanges.
Reagan had been trying for nearly four years to orchestrate the
joint verification tests.
   The Soviets returned in March, living at a test site base camp
in Mercury, 65 miles northwest of Las Vegas.

   Tommy Andrade discreetly recorded the dinner
reservation for ``Jones,'' and winked.
   ``It was a celebrity, but they want privacy,'' said Andrade,
maitre d' at the Fairmont Hotel's ritzy Sazerac Restaurant. ``It's
an alias, of course.''
   But of course.
   The stars of the Republican National Convention aren't just
politicos. They also include the likes of actor Charlton Heston,
evangelist Billy Graham, and billionaire real estate developer
Donald Trump.
   ``The people who use aliases, they want complete privacy,''
Andrade said. ``They have stressed complete privacy. They only
allow myself and one waiter into the private dining rooms.''
   A bunch of senators used the alias ``Jackson'' to reserve party
space in the Sazerac. The Rev. Jerry Falwell's private table was
held Wednesday night under the name of an assistant, Andrade said.
   Curious pedestrians are cued by the arrival of stretch
limousines, and some surge forward in hopes of a handshake,
autograph, or greeting. Jere Smith, a spokesman for Phillips
Petroleum, said his bosses from Oklahoma were embarrassed when
people bolted into busy streets to peer through their limousine's
tinted windows. A few onlookers posed for photographs beside the
luxurious wheels, he said.
   Trump said his invitation to the convention revelry came from
Vice President George Bush. They both were checked into the
high-rise Marriott, overlooking the Mississippi River. ``I'm
looking at this as a vacation. I'm really here to watch,'' Trump
said.
   Heston wowed Michigan delegates during a Wednesday gathering
with a blast at Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., who led the
``Where was George?'' chant during last month's Democratic National
Convention.
   ``It would have occurred to me to say to the senator, `George
was dry, sober and home with his wife,''' said Heston, a native of
St. Helen, Mich.
   Heston also appeared at parties sponsored by the National Rifle
Association. So did strongman actor Arnold Schwarzenegger, a
Republican whose wife, Maria Shriver, is kin to the Kennedys.
   But Schwarzenegger didn't make a much-anticipated visit to a
confab of the Mississippi delegation, said chairwoman Evelyn
McPhail.
   ``I was looking forward to meeting Arnold Schwarzenegger,'' said
Ms. McPhail, who hasn't seen any of the muscleman's films. ``I've
only heard of him because of his weightlifting. I'm not a
moviegoer.''
   The Mississippi delegation chief endorses using celebrities to
get attention for political causes. ``If it doesn't have an
influence on how people vote, at least it's magnetism in getting
them to listen,'' Ms. McPhail said.

   A drunken man stole a steamroller and led
deputies on a slow-speed chase during which the road flattener
clipped parked cars before crashing to a halt, authorities said.
   Rudolph Soria, 28, was first spotted aboard the steamroller
early Wednesday by two sheriff's deputies on patrol, Deputy John
McQuarrie said.
   ``It did not look like the man's personal vehicle and it did not
look like the street needed straightening,'' McQuarrie said.
   The two deputies followed the stolen roller as it moved at 5
mph. California Highway Patrol officers joined in the pursuit and
watched as the steamroller hit two or three parked cars before
crashing into a building 10 minutes later.
   Soria fell off and suffered a cut to his head, authorities said.
   He was booked for investigation of drunken driving, possession
of stolen property and resisting arrest, and was being held on
$1,500 bail.

   Here, at a glance, are highlights of the
third day of the Republican National Convention:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>THE NOMINATION</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   George Bush won the Republican presidential nomination in a
ceremonial roll call of the states. His adopted state of Texas put
him over the top.
   Tonight he delivers his acceptance speech. Press secretary
Sheila Tate said the address will be ``thoughtful, quiet,
personal.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>BUSH</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Bush made the convention a family affair, and he and his wife,
Barbara, were surrounded by their grandchildren as the Republican
National Convention awarded him the party's presidential nomination.
   Their five children were delegates.
   Bush toured the Superdome earlier Wednesday, checking out the
podium and the TelePrompTer he will use Thursday when he accepts
the nomination.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>GRAMM</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Phil Gramm lauded George Bush as ``the greatest vice
president this nation has ever had'' as he placed Bush's name in
nomination.
   Gramm, the Texan best known for the budget-cutting plan that
bears his name, described Bush as a certifiable war hero committed
to a strong defense. On the other hand, he said, Michael Dukakis
would ``wimp America and endanger peace.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>QUAYLE</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Quayle, at a joint news conference with Bush, was bombarded with
questions about his wealth, his military record and his private
life.
   He refused to divulge details of a 1980 Florida vacation with
Washington lobbyist Paula Parkinson. And he dismissed as ``a cheap
shot'' any suggestions that he joined the National Guard in 1969 in
order to avoid going to Vietnam.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>ALSO-RANS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Bush campaign aides revealed that the vice president had
considered 12 people for a running mate.
   They were Sen. Bob Dole and his wife, former Transportation
Secretary Elizabeth Dole; New Hampshire Gov. John Sununu,
California Gov. George Deukmejian, South Carolina Gov. Carroll
Campbell, Gov. Jim Thompson of Illinois, Sens. John Danforth of
Missouri, Alan Simpson of Wyoming and Pete Domenici of New Mexico
and Nancy Kassebaum of Kansas; Rep. Jack Kemp of New York, Attorney
General Richard Thornburgh.

<HEAD>IMAGE</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Delegates to the convention say Bush should step out from
President Reagan's shadow and ``come out of the chutes raising
hell'' to capture the White House.
   Some delegates believe Bush must sharpen his image to succeed,
with the advice ranging from declaring his independence from
President Reagan to using fewer hand gestures, wearing horn-rimmed
glasses and standing straight. Others prefer that Bush ignore the
suggestions and be himself.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>DOLE</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Bob Dole, joining ranks with George Bush after being
bypassed as a running mate, told the convention that Michael
Dukakis is one of those ``liberal doom-sayers who believe that
America cannot be trusted.''
   Dole repeatedly dubbed Dukakis ``the Massachusetts liberal'' and
said he was unprepared to deal realistically with foreign policy
challenges. ``He is one of those liberals who is uncomfortable when
America stands on the side of freedom,'' Dole said.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>BENNETT</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of Education William J. Bennett said Democratic
leaders are embarrassed by efforts to teach schoolchildren values
and the pledge of allegiance.
   Bennett, in a brief address to the Republican National
Convention, said the Reagan administration has sparked controversy
by calling for teaching school children moral values and the
Judeo-Christian tradition. But ``there are some fights worth
having,'' added Bennett, who leaves his post next month.

<HEAD>No Strings Pulled to Stay Out of Vietnam, Quayle Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A George Bush aide said Wednesday that Dan
Quayle was asked, before being selected as running mate, whether
strings were pulled to get him into the National Guard and avoid
service in Vietnam. Quayle said none were, the aide recounted.
   ``The question was, I believe, was there any pull or some
influence in some way for him to get into the National Guard. My
impression is the answer is absolutely not,'' Robert Teeter told
reporters.
   ``He, at some point said, `I simply applied, like anyone
else','' said Teeter, who oversaw Bush's vice presidential
selection process.
   Quayle himself, in an interview on CBS, said he was ``almost
certain'' that the governor or lieutenant governor of Indiana were
not asked to help him get in the National Guard in 1969.
   ``Many of us got in,'' he said, adding that he was speaking on
the basis of recollections that are 20 years old.
   At the time, men Quayle's age were being drafted into the Army
and many were sent to Vietnam.
   In an interview with ABC News, Quayle said he chose the National
Guard _ rather than risking the draft _ because that course allowed
him to fulfill his military obligation and still attend law school.
   But if his National Guard unit had been called up _ none were
during the Vietnam War _ he said he ``would have gone and served
very proudly.''
   And he told CNN: ``I was willing and ready to serve my country.
I chose to serve my country in the National Guard like millions of
other people.''
   The question arose as every aspect of Quayle's life came under
intense scrutiny following his surprise selection by Bush Tuesday.
   An NBC-owned Washington, D.C. television station, WRC-TV, said
Quayle ``may have received help from then Indiana Gov. Edgar
Whitcomb.'' Citing Republican sources it did not name, the station
said Quayle was working as an administrative assistant in the
governor's office in 1969 and Whitcomb moved Quayle to the top of a
``lengthy'' waiting list for enrollment in the guard.
   However, Quayle's biography showed that he had not started
working for Whitcomb until 1971, two years after he joined the
National Guard.
   Jeff Nesbit, Quayle press secretary, told of the television
station's report, said: ``I can say nothing more than what he
(Quayle) said. Basically some of the other folks he went to college
with wanted to get in and most of them got in. What he said has to
stand at this time.''

<HEAD>Israel Deports Four, and 105 Reported Beaten in Territories</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SERGEI SHARGORODSKY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Israeli army partially lifted a three-day
curfew in the Gaza Strip today after deporting four Palestinians
and ordering 25 more expelled in an effort to break the uprising in
the occupied lands.
   Israel Televison said a 9-year-old Palestinian girl was killed
in the West Bank on Wednesday when soldiers put down a riot, and
hospital officials said they treated 105 Arabs beaten by Israeli
troops in Gaza.
   The army reported three Palestinians wounded in the strip, and
hospital officials and Israel radio said six Palestinians were
wounded in the Nablus area of the West Bank. The army said it had
no reports from Nablus.
   The fatality brought to 248 the number of Palestinians killed in
the 8-month-old uprising against Israel's 21-year occupation of the
West Bank and Gaza. Four Israelis also have been killed.
   The curfew in the seaside Gaza Strip, which had confined about
650,000 Arabs to their homes, remained in effect in several refugee
camps and towns, affecting about 160,000 people.
   More than 70,000 Palestinians remained under curfew in the West
Bank.
   The army described the four Gazans deported Wednesday as members
of outlawed Palestinian guerrilla groups and inciters of the
uprising.
   The four _ Mohammed Gharableh, Yusri Al Hums, Ahmad Abu Muailek
and Fathi Shakaki _ were taken to Lebanon and offered $50 dollars,
which they refused.
   ``We shall return to the land from where we were expelled,''
Shakaki vowed upon arrival in the Syrian-controlled Bekaa Valley.
   The expulsions brought to 33 the number of Arabs deported since
the revolt began Dec. 8.
   The United and other countries oppose Israel's deportation
policy, which Israel defends as the most effective means of
deterring violent protests.
   The army also handed deportation orders to 15 more Arabs from
the West Bank and 10 from Gaza, accusing them of ``taking direction
from terrorist organizations.'' One other West Bank Palestinian
awaits deportation.
   Fifteen of the 25 were described as leaders of the Palestinian
local committees or their operational arm, the ``striking forces''
which the army statement said ``strive to undermine the Israeli
control and create alternative administration.''
   Meanwhile, Palestinian activists in Nablus used loudspeakers to
call for a two-day mourning strike for the death of two desert
detention camp inmates. Israeli troops killed them during a riot by
prisoners.
   The riot occurred Tuesday in Ketziot near the Egyptian border.
The prisoners threw stones and other objects at guards and began
climbing camp walls before authorities restored order.
   Maj. Gen. Yitzhak Mordechai, Israel's Gaza Strip commander,
visited the prison Wednesday and appointed a committee to
investigate the riot.
   The prison opened in March to hold Palestinians jailed for
participating in the uprising.
   Muhammed Naamri, an East Jerusalem Arab attorney who visited the
prison Wednesday but was only permitted to speak to the guards,
said the inmates declared a two-day hunger strike and were refusing
to leave their tents.
   He quoted guards as saying the riot was triggered by news
reaching Ketziot of the Gaza curfew.
   In Gaza City, just 15 people were allowed to take part in the
funeral of 25-year-old Assad Jabri Shawa, one of the killed
inmates, a local Arab reporter said.
   Meanwhile, Dr. Ahmed Yazeji, chief surgeon at the city's Shifa
Hospital, said 105 Palestinians were treated for beating injuries,
mostly bruises. He said the beatings looked as though they were
caused by ``clubs and rifle butts and kicking with heavy military
boots.''
   He added that 90 percent of the victims said they were beaten in
their homes by troops searching for people suspected of throwing
stones.
   An army official said he could not confirm the injuries, but
that the number appeared greatly exaggerated.
   Scattered Palestinian protests were reported Wednesday in Gaza
and the West Bank, which was paralyzed by a general strike.
   In the West Bank town of Jenin, 9-year-old Rasha Artawi was
killed while troops dispersed a riot, Israel TV said. It quoted
Arab reports as saying the girl was killed by a stray bullet.
   However, Israeli army officials told the television that a local
doctor said the girl was killed by a stone. An army spokesman
reached by The Associated Press said he had no information about
the case.

<HEAD>Company Apologizes For Forcing Workers To Remove U.S. Flag</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ASHLAND, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Armco Inc. has apologized for ordering steel
workers to remove an American flag the workers had hung before
Japanese steel customers toured the company's Ashland Works.
   ``We now realize that we were wrong in asking our employees to
remove the flag and that we have offended many people,'' Armco
spokesman Bill Scaggs said Wednesday, reading from a statement.
``For that error in judgment, we apologize.''
   The company had said the flag was hung primarily to embarrass
the Japanese, not to show patriotism. Workers denied that.
   Scaggs delivered the apology to Michael Hewlitt, president of
United Steelworkers Local 1865, and vice president Charles Whitlock
in a rare appearance by a management official at the union local's
hall.
   Scaggs said that local and divisional company officials made the
decision to apologize because the incident, which attracted
national attention, hurt relations between the company and the
plant's 3,200 workers.
   Mike McCormick, the 37-year-old cast house helper who hung the
3-by-5-foot flag on a crane in the Amanda furnace, said he was not
trying to embarrass the Japanese, who visited Monday.
   ``I was just proud to be an American steel worker,'' he said.
``I think our industry has come a long way. That's the only message
I was trying to send.''
   Hewlitt said the union was satisfied with Armco's apology.
   The flag is now hanging in the employee lunchroom at the plant.
   ``This whole thing got blown out of proportion,'' said
McCormick, ``and I'm sorry it got to this point.''

<HEAD>Composer's Birthday Wish: A Good Voice</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROLYN LUMSDEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LENOX, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leonard Bernstein says he would trade his
considerable conducting and composing talents for a good voice.
   ``If I could get up on the stage and sing one phrase of Verdi or
Bizet or Wagner so that people would be moved, I would give up
everything for that,'' the nation's best-known composer said
Wednesday.
   ``I can sing, but I empty rooms,'' he confessed.
   The composer of ``West Side Story'' and ``Candide'' held a rare
news conference at the Tanglewood Music Center to talk about the
four-day extravaganza planned there next week in honor of his 70th
birthday.
   Among those at the celebration that starts on his birthday, Aug.
25, will be such friends as actress Lauren Bacall, diva Bevely
Sills and record producer Quincy Jones. Actress Elizabeth Taylor
and publisher Malcolm Forbes are planning to arrive in a hot-air
balloon, Tanglewood officials said.
   Bernstein, however, played down the festivities that organizers
have promised will be one of the music world's great occasions.
   ``I'm not celebrating anything. I'm just at Tanglewood,'' he
said, chain-smoking and sweating after a vigorous hour spent
conducting the student orchestra in preparation for Sunday's
performance of his ``Songfest.''
   The flamboyant maestro, wearing a trademark red bandanna around
his neck, forbade any mention of the word ``birthday.''
   ``Every time someone says that word I feel a year older.''
   Bernstein was a member of the original Tanglewood Music Center
class of 1940, where he became a protege of the festival's founder,
Serge Koussevitzky.
   ``I feel I built the bloody place,'' he said Wednesday.
   When Koussevitzky retired as conductor of the Boston Symphony
Orchestra in 1949, he tried to have the young Bernstein named as
his successor. The orchestra's trustees, however, considered
Bernstein too young and tainted by popular music.
   Bernstein declined Wednesday to sum up his prodigious
accomplishments as recording artist, conductor, composer and
musician.
   ``That's your problem,'' he told the 50 reporters and admirers
at the news conference. ``I'm too busy. I can't think about things
like that, to assess myself or to place myself in various
categories of ranks or to decide whether I've achieved everything
or a portion or a fraction.''
   ``I feel as though I've lived many, many lifetimes ... more than
I had any right to expect.''
   He said the only birthday gift he wanted was more time to write
music.
   ``I have everything. I am blessed and grateful. I have no
further requests of fate except time. ... Of course, I'd like to
see a few more grandchildren.''
   He refused to talk about the pieces he is working on, except to
say he was collaborating with choreographer Martha Graham on a
ballet and experimenting with ``song cycles'' and other vocal
compositions.
   One recent experiment was conducting Puccini's ``La Boheme'' in
Rome with a cast of young Americans.
   ``I've always associated `Boheme' with Greenwich Village and my
life as a young bohemian,'' he said.

<HEAD>`Texas Proudly Casts 111 Votes For ... The Best Father In America'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HARRY F. ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It was nomination day for George Bush, but it
might well have been Father's Day. No cards could have been sweeter
for a father than the public and affectionate tributes Bush's five
children paid him at the Republican convention.
   One by one, as the clerk called the roll of the states, the four
sons and one daughter of Bush _ all delegates _ announced the votes
for their respective states, adding a personal touch to a ritual
that was as unnecessary as it was overlong.
   It fell to George W. Bush, the oldest at 42, to announce the
vote from Texas that put his father over the top. Other states
passed their turn to accord the Bush home state the privilege.
   ``The great state of Texas proudly casts 111 votes for a man we
respect and a man we love,'' said George W., a director of a
Dallas-based oil company. ``Texas casts all its votes for her
favorite son and the best father in America.''
   Later, he told a reporter, ``there was never any question in my
mind, although I was there in Iowa (_ the caucus where Bush placed
third _ ) that this moment would come for George Bush. I'm happy
for him, and I'm honored that I had the chance to put him over.''
   The nominee's daughter, Dorothy Bush LeBlond, announced Maine's
vote.
   ``I have never been prouder than I am at this moment to be able
to cast all 22 votes from the state of Maine to the most decent,
the most honest, the most caring man ever to seek the presidency,''
she said. ``The man who made me proud every single day of my life
and a man who will make America proud, the next president of the
United States, my beloved father, George Bush.''
   Bush and his wife were babysitting for their 10 grandchildren at
their hotel, watching the proceedings on television. When he had
officially wrapped up the nomination, the picture was transmitted
to the five huge screens in the convention hall to the delight of
delegates.
   As the Texas vote approached, Bush exclaimed, ``Here we come.
Here's the big moment.'' Then, turning to his wife, he pointed to
the scene on television and said: ``There's Junior,'' referring to
his son by his nickname.
   Playing to prime-time television, the Republicans took the
unusual step of staging their 20-minute celebration of the
uncontested nomination before the vote, dropping 50,000 balloons on
the delegates while drums rolled, the band played and state flags
waved.
   Jeb Bush, 35, Florida's Secretary of Commerce announced that
state's vote ``for the next first lady of the United States,
Barbara Bush, and the next president, George Bush.''
   Neil, 33, president of a Denver oil and gas firm, was the first
Bush child to take one of the floor microphones.
   ``I am proud to cast Colorado's votes for a man I dearly love, a
man who's been there when I needed him,'' Neil said.
   And Marvin, 31, a partner in an investment advisory firm in
Charlottesville, Va., stood at his state's microphone and said:
   ``I'm not going to sugarcoat it for you. I'm proud. I'm proud to
be a delegate and resident of the Commonwealth of Virginia, but I'm
especially proud to cast all 50 of her votes for a man who is
adored by his wife and five children, his five in-laws and his 10
grandchildren _ and the next president, my dad, George Bush.''

<HEAD>Soviets Sign Pact To Make Holocaust Material Available to U.S.
Scholars</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union will make available millions
of Nazi documents, photographs and other records of the Holocausrt
captured in Eastern Europe by Soviet troops at the end of World War
II for inclusion in the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, according
to officials planning the museum.
   The U.S. Holocaust Memorial Council on Wednesday announced that
the materials will be made available for the first time to Western
scholars, investigators and legal experts through an agreement
signed with the Soviets in Moscow on July 29.
   ``We're obviously thrilled,'' said Miles Lerman, chairman of the
Committee of International Relations for the council.
   ``We have tried before to get this information, but were always
unsuccessful,'' added Lerman, who led a six-person delegation on a
visiting tour of Soviet archives for two weeks in July.
   The accord will give the council access to the materials for
copying and inclusion in the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum which
is to be located near the Mall and expected to open in 1991.
   Council officials estimate that 30 percent to 40 percent of the
material currently available about the Holocaust is scattered in
dozens of archives in the Soviet Union.
   Lerman credited ``the new spirit of glasnost'' for Soviet
willingness to make the records available.
   Until now, the Soviets would only release information requested
for specific cases, like an identity card used as evidence in the
case against former concentration camp guard John Demjanjuk who was
sentenced to death in Israel in April.

<HEAD>Dollar High, Share Prices Lose Ground</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar stayed higher after a jump at the
opening, while share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange lost some
of their ground gained during Thursday's trading.
   The dollar, which opened at 134.00 yen, moved in a range of
133.73-134.10 yen, to close at 133.93, up 0.78 yen from Wednesday's
close.
   After opening the day's trade at 28,291.11 points following
Wednesday's rebound, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected
issues, the most widely used index of the market, edged down 49.50
points from Wednesday's close, or 0.18 percent, to finish at
28,129.36 points.
   The foreign exchange dealers attributed the dollar's jump to the
0.25 yen gained on Wall Street overnight.
   ``The dollar is basically firm, but profit-taking pushes it down
when it surpasses the 134.00 mark,'' said a dealer at a U.S. bank's
Tokyo office. ``As a result, the dollar is unlikely to move out of
the range of 132.00-134.00 for a while,'' he added, requesting
anonymity.
   A stock dealer who also asked to remain anonymous said
Thursday's trading was slow. ``Basically, it was a little break for
the market after its hectic trade yesterday,'' he said, adding that
the slow trading was partly because the steel and finance related
stocks did not do well.
   The stock market traded 500 million shares in the first session,
but it slowed down during the afternoon session, trading 250
million shares.

   Police increased patrols in a tense
neighborhood after a reputed local leader of a Los Angeles-based
gang was killed in a gun battle authorities believe was perpetrated
by the group's main rival.
   Joseph Ray Winston, 17, died early Wednesday in a small,
dimly-lit park near a public housing project known for its gang
activity. He became the first gang member killed in a drive-by
shooting in Portland, where the Los Angeles-based Crips and Bloods
have been active for about two years. The gangs were depicted in
the movie ``Colors.''
   Shortly after the shooting of the Crips leader here, more than
two dozen officers, many with their guns drawn, dispersed a group
of about 25 gang members in what police called an extremely tense
situation.
   Winston, who had told police he was a leader of the Crips at the
Columbia Villa housing project, was sitting in the park about 12:30
a.m. when an unknown number of people opened fire from a passing
car, said police Sgt. Bob Kauffman.
   Police believe Winston or others in the park returned fire. More
than 25 shots were were fired, police said. Shell casing were found
scattered over a two-block area.
   Two teen-age girls who were near Winston were wounded.
   About the same time, a shot from a passing car was fired into
the housing project. Police weren't sure if the shootings were
related.
   Members of the gangs had argued Tuesday, police said.
   ``We don't know what the friction was about,'' said homicide
Sgt. Larry Neville. ``This is going to be a difficult investigation
because no one wants to tell us anything.''
   The Crips and Bloods originated in Southern California in the
1960s and 1970s. Police say they are heavily involved in selling
crack, a highly addictive form of cocaine.
   The gangs, lured by the prospect of untapped markets for crack,
have been moving into other parts of the country, authorities say.
   Authorities have identified about 90 transplanted Californians
among the estimated 600 people in Portland who consider themselves
gang members.
   City officials recently announced an anti-gang program.
   ``We were afraid something like this would happen,'' said Mayor
Bud Clark. ``That's why we took the steps we did.''
   A reporter at the scene said that shortly after the shootings,
about 100 residents gathered near the park, and scuffles broke out.
   About 25 Crips members emerged from the housing project and
pushed through the crowd, authorities said. They shouted that
Winston was ``our home boy'' and that ``someone was going to pay''
for his death, authorities said.
   The gang members ignored a police request to disperse. The
officers then formed a semicircle and began walking toward the
crowd, shining flashlights at them. Several officers had police
dogs and many had their guns drawn, witnesses said.
   The officers again told the gang members to disperse. The group
moved away, but stayed in the general area.
   Police were worried about a retaliatory attack by the Crips, who
reportedly outnumber the Bloods in Portland.
   ``We are going to have a very high level of uniform presence in
areas where we know gangs are active,'' said Deputy Police Chief
Dan Noelle. ``We are also going to be taking some tactical steps,
which I cannot discuss. We want to make it uncomfortable to be a
gang member.''
   Police said they had no suspects in the shootings.

   Sen. Bob Dole hailed the selection of fellow
senator Dan Quayle as the Republican vice presidential candidate
while assailing Michael Dukakis as ``the Massachusetts liberal''
who would undermine the nation's defenses.
   Dole, 65, who came to the Republican National Convention
believing he had a chance to be tapped by George Bush for the
ticket's No. 2 spot, showed no sign of disappointment Wednesday
night as he pledged to work for Bush's election and portrayed
Quayle as ``articulate'' and ``dynamic.''
   The Kansas senator said Dukakis' bid for the White House should
be rejected by the nation because he is ``one of those liberal
doomsayers who believe that America cannot be trusted ... who is
uncomfortable when America stands on the side of freedom.''
   In a speech that was just four pages long, Dole called Dukakis a
liberal 17 times, six times calling him ``the Massachusetts
liberal.''
   Dole, the Senate minority leader, ran for vice president in 1976
and vainly sought his party's presidential nomination this year and
in 1980. He described himself as ready and eager to serve as George
Bush's ``point man'' in the Senate next January.
   ``I promise to beat back any Democratic schemes to raise your
taxes, or any effort to weaken our national defense,'' he said.
   He then launched his attack on Dukakis, sharply criticizing the
Democratic nominee's inexperience in foreign policy and his
declared opposition to military aid to Nicaragua's Contra rebels,
new-model nuclear missiles, the B1 bomber and the ``Star Wars''
strategic defense system.
   He asserted that Dukakis is ready to ``throw the Monroe Doctrine
away'' when it comes to confronting communism and Soviet influence
in Nicaragua and Central America.
   ``He speaks Spanish freely on the campaign trail, but he is not
concerned whether Spanish-speaking people in Central America have
the right to be free,'' Dole said.
   ``The governor is one of those liberals who is suspicious of
America's strength, embarrassed when America asserts its rights,
uncomfortable when America stands on the side of freedom,'' he
declared.
   Dukakis is ``one of those liberals with strange ideas _
Dukak-eyed ideas _ about the way the world works,'' he said.
   Dole said Dukakis does not understand that recent U.S. foreign
policy successes were made possible only by the rebuilding of the
nation's military strength.
   ``Liberals like the Massachusetts governor ... don't understand
that a strong America keeps the peace and a weak America invites
danger,'' he said.
   ``In the world according to Mike, America needs an OK from the
United Nations before it can act,'' he declared.
   Dole contended that improved relations with the Soviet Union
resulted because President Reagan ``said no to aggression.''
   ``Knowing when to say yes and when to say no,'' he said, ``it
separates leadership from mere office holding; it separates leaders
from technocrats.''
   Kansas delegates staged a brief but enthusiastic demonstration
on the Superdome floor when Dole was introduced by Sen. Nancy
Kassebaum, R-Kan.
   The Kansans brought more than 800 Dole signs into the arena,
distributing them among other delegations for the demonstration.
   Dole reciprocated by going to the Kansas section following his
speech and sitting with the delegation, shaking hands and posing
for pictures. He stayed until Gov. Mike Hayden cast Kansas' 34
votes for Bush in his first-ballot nomination.

   The General Assembly has approved a $35.7
million assessment to cover the first three months of operations of
the U.N. force that will monitor a cease-fire between Iran and Iraq.
   The truce begins Saturday, and peace talks between Iran and Iraq
start Aug. 25 in Geneva, mediated by U.N. Secretary-General Javier
Perez de Cuellar.
   America's share of the cost of the U.N. Iran-Iraq Military
Observer Group is $10.9 million for the first three months,
according to the assessment formula for peacekeeping operations.
   The 159-member General Assembly on Wednesday adopted by
consensus its budget committee's recommendation for the assessment.
   A total of 1,300 personnel from 24 nations, including 350
unarmed military observers, will monitor the cease-fire.
   The General Assembly asked the secretary-general to report back
by Oct. 1 on the first phase of the operation.
   A U.N. report said the observer force should cost $75.6 for six
months. The United States was expected to pay about $23 million of
the total.
   Japan has pledged $10 million in extra contributions to the
peacekeeping costs, and Morocco has promised to donate $2 million.
   The Security Council created the U.N. Iran-Iraq Military
Observer Group on Aug. 9 after Iran and Iraq agreed to observe the
cease-fire.
   Prior to Wednesday's vote, members of the General Assembly
observed a minute of silence and offered eulogies for Pakistan's
President Mohammad Zia ul-Haq, who died earlier in the day in a
military aircraft crash.
   The U.S. ambassador to Pakistan, Arnold L. Raphel, was among
other victims who were aboard the C-130 transport.

   The nation's second-largest city wanted a
monument to rival the Statue of Liberty, and architects responded
in Southern California fashion, with some far-out designs that
would make Lady Liberty drop her torch.
   The entries unveiled this week include a giant transparent bird
and a 4-block-long dollar bill, but they seem unlikely to knock the
Pyramids off the Seven Wonders of the World list.
   The West Coast Gateway Committee received 150 designs in all,
including a towering baseball mitt and giant naked statues in plain
view of hundreds of thousands of daily freeway commuters.
   Judges on an international committee formed by Mayor Tom Bradley
whittled the selections down to five this week, with semifinalists
including the gargantuan bird with an egg that lowers onto a
surface street.
   ``The jurors certainly chose the unexpected,'' Nick Patsaouras,
chairman of the Gateway Committe, said Wednesday.
   ``We wanted a symbol of Los Angeles,'' said Patsaouras. ``And we
wanted it to stand the test of time, into the 21st century. I'm
very happy with our entries.''
   Backers hope that the final design will be built over the Santa
Ana Freeway near City Hall with $40 million in corporate donations
raised in the way the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics were funded.
   The $100,000 contest was financed by a Japanese real estate
company that owns two Los Angeles skyscrapers.
   Bradley was credited with putting the monument plans in motion,
deciding just as New York celebrated the 100th anniversary of the
Statue of Liberty last summer that Los Angeles should have its own
monument to welcome newcomers to U.S. shores.
   In February, Bradley kicked off the contest for a design,
calling the monument drive ``uniquely a Los Angeles project.''
   Monument official David Jay Flood promised it would be singular
and not be a ``statue that would probably only be appreciated by
pigeons.''
   The architects who responded did not let them down. The plans on
display at the California Museum of Science and Industry burst with
imagination.
   And while the temptation is to label the collection typically
Californian, only one semifinalist is from California. The others
are from Massachusetts, New York, Austria and the Soviet Union.
   The baseball mitt design was accompanied by a giant bat and a
giant white baseball, and a regulation-sized baseball field.
   The jury turned it down, and rejected a giant bald head that
peers down on the freeway and a design of four giant hands colored
red, yellow, black and white.
   Another monument was a rainbow. One had a large butterfly
floating overhead attached by guy wires.
   Some designs had so many wires and sails and metal rigging that
they looked like the wreckage of a Wright brothers plane.
   Except for the bird monument, designed by Vilen Kunnapu of the
Soviet Republic of Estonia, the four other semifinalists were
mechanical-looking structures, functional and high-tech.
   The design by Austria's Irmfried Windbichler combined towering
fountains of water, ``a landmark to be seen for miles by
approaching motorists.''
   Dagmar Richter of Cambridge, Mass., termed her semifinalist
project a ``linear structure ... and part vessel for social
gathering.''
   Hani Rashid of New York put forward a stagelike structure
praised for its ``theaters, galleries and general use of open
spaces.''
   Los Angeles' Neil Denari had a large video screen with the face
of George Washington sticking out on the design. It is accompanied
by the message: ``The measurement of the American dream is The
Dollar.''

<HEAD>Government Approves Use of Anti-Baldness Formula</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KALAMAZOO, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The first anti-baldness drug that has
received federal approval for sales will reach stores within six
weeks, but a consumer publication is questioning the substance's
effectiveness.
   Upjohn Co. announced the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's
approval of presecription sales of Rogaine on Wednesday.
   ``We're very pleased,'' said Lawrence C. Hoff, president and
chief operating officer for the Kalamazoo-based company. ``The
development of Rogaine represents the first large-scale scientific
study of a pharmaceutical agent for hair growth.''
   In Washington, FDA spokesman Bill Grigg confirmed late Wednesday
that the agency had approved use of Rogaine. The FDA allowed Upjohn
to make the announcement at the company's request, Grigg said.
   Upjohn said it has tested Rogaine on about 2,300 balding
individuals at 27 medical centers. It said 39 percent of those who
twice-daily applied the 2 percent minoxidil solution experienced
either dense or moderate hair growth.
   The formula will reach stores within six weeks. Price hasn't
been determined, the company said. Rogaine is available in 44
countries, including Canada and Mexico.
   Despite approval, Rogaine's effectiveness has been questioned by
Consumer Reports magazine.
   The independent consumer magazine, in its September issue, said
Upjohn's tests may exaggerate how well bald spots respond to the
formula.
   ``The study excluded men who were very bald, those with hair
only on the sides and a smooth, `billiard ball,' appearance on
top,'' the magazine said.
   While a small portion of participants did see some regrowth of
hair and a shrinking of their bald spots, no one grew back a full
head of hair, Consumer Reports said.
   Company officials said Rogaine won't work for everyone, adding
that continued use for up to four months is necessary before hair
growth can be noticed.
   ``Because Rogaine is a treatment not a cure, cessation of
Rogaine treatment in patients with hair growth will lead to the
loss of the hair within a few months,'' said Richard DeVillez,
director of dermatology at Upjohn.
   Upjohn said it will continue to conduct tests on the
effectiveness of Rogaine.
   ``Because it's a first, it's important to us to monitor and
analyze its use and acceptance in the medical community. To do this
we will be conducting a postmarketing surveillance survey,'' Hoff
said.

<HEAD>Another Occupational Hazard: Pizza Cutter's Palsy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Every occupation has its special hazards, it
seems, even slicing up pizza.
   In a letter in today's New England Journal of Medicine, a doctor
describes a case of what he calls pizza cutter's palsy.
   He said he decided to bring this to the attention of the medical
world ``because of the ubiquitous demand for pizza in Western
nations.''
   Dr. H. Royden Jones Jr. of the Lahey Clinic Medical Center in
Burlington wrote that pizza cutter's palsy is a weakness of the
hand muscles. It comes from pressing the handle of a roller-blade
pizza cutter into the palm of the hand while slicing pizzas. This
puts pressure on the ulnar nerve.
   He diagnosed the problem in a man whose hand was so weak that he
had trouble putting the key into the ignition of his car.
   Solving the disability is easy enough. ``This palsy is relieved
by using another cutting instrument,'' Royden reported.

<HEAD>Greek Immigrant Feeds Thousands To Say Thanks</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A Greek immigrant who treasured the
candy, sugar and clothes he got in U.S. relief packages as a child
has found a way to say thanks over and over again: an annual picnic
for thousands of senior citizens.
   ``From the day I walk into this country, that's about 37 years
ago, I never had a sad day yet,'' restaurateur Lou Pappan said at
his 14th summer picnic Wednesday. ``I never met a person in this
country I did not really like.''
   The 12-hour picnic, a country hoedown in Bradys Run Park, has
become a summertime tradition for senior citizens in Beaver County,
a depressed patch of steel country about 25 miles west of
Pittsburgh.
   ``It's wonderful. Once a year you get out of the house and under
the trees. I think Lou's the most wonderful person in the world,''
said Elsie White, 58, of Coraopolis.
   She has been to all of Pappan's picnics and this year brought 33
senior citizens in a bus.
   ``I enjoy the bingo,'' said Rudolph Hiber, 77, of Aliquippa.
``I've been on a pension for 17 years. It's nice to meet some
people.''
   This year's picnic featured spaghetti and meat sauce, rolls and
tapioca pudding served on covered picnic tables in humid, 95-degree
weather. County Recreation Director Jack Hilfinger said more than
3,000 people were on hand by noon, and Pappan said he had expected
6,000 through the evening.
   He said the bash will cost him $30,000.
   Volunteers, many of them Pappan's employees, began serving cold
drinks at 9 a.m. Entertainment included a bluegrass band, square
dancing and contests for crafts, food and paintings.
   Pappan, 57, began throwing the picnics in 1975 to thank
Americans for helping Greece during World War II.
   ``This country's got a heart so big,'' Pappan said. ``Of all the
countries I could have went to, here I am. I came to the United
States, the best country in the world.''
   Pappan, born Illiasi Demetrios Papankolaou, grew up in
Makrakomi, Greece, where his father operated a restaurant. He
didn't speak English when he came to live with his uncle in Beaver
Falls in 1951.
   As a boy in the poverty-stricken Greek village during World War
II, Pappan said he watched some of his friends die of starvation.
He searched the skies for American aircraft that would bring help.
   ``They dropped big boxes full of clothing and also food,'' he
said in his thick Greek accent. ``We got sometimes white sugar,
sometimes brown sugar. We even received sometimes chocolate bars.
It was a very big deal.''
   Some of the clothing lasted years, Pappan said.
   ``I remember a pair of pants and a shirt I used to wear in my
high school days,'' he said. ``I graduated from high school wearing
those pants.''
   After Pappan enlisted in the U.S. Army during the Korean War, a
sergeant who called him ``Alphabet'' convinced him his Greek name
was too difficult for Americans to pronounce.
   He opened his first Pappan's Family Restaurant in 1964 near
Beaver Falls. Now about 1,200 people work at his 18 Roy Rogers
restaurants, 14 Pappan's Family Restaurants and three specialty
restaurants in western Pennsylvania. He says his food business will
gross about $20 million this year.
   Pappan acknowledges that publicity about the picnic is good for
business, but says ``it's better for our soul.''
   ``I want to die as a nice man instead of a rich man.''

   Dick Bigelow has been parading around the
Republican National Convention all week with a thick, green
``bush'' atop his straw hat _ in honor of GOP ticket-topper George
Bush.
   He sported a new adornment on the chapeau when he arrived at the
Superdome on Wednesday night: tucked among the plastic leaves was
an actual stuffed quail _ a tribute to the No. 2 man on the GOP
ticket, Dan Quayle.
   ``It wasn't easy to find. I had to search all over town,'' said
Bigelow, an alternate delegate from Castro Valley, Calif. His
search ended at a riverfront shopping mall where he found the bird
encased in a lamp.
   ``I took the lamp apart, took the quail out and then I had the
lamp sent back to California,'' he said.
   Bigelow said it was worth the $235 cost.
   ``Everybody says, `Like that hat.' It's a symbol,'' he said.

   Democrat Lloyd Bentsen and Republican Dan
Quayle had been on opposite sides of the debate podium even before
the two senators were selected to be their parties' vice
presidential candidates.
   The senators went head-to-head four months ago on public
television's MacNeil-Lehrer NewsHour over a trade bill eventually
vetoed by President Reagan because of a provision that would
require companies to warn workers of plant closings.
   The Public Broadcasting Service has released a transcript of the
April 22 show, billing it as ``the only known televised debate
between the two candidates.''
   The Senate eventually approved the trade bill, Reagan vetoed it
and Bentsen devised the successful strategy of putting the
plant-closing provision into a separate measure that Reagan allowed
to become law.

   Greek-American delegates staged a

not all Greeks support Democratic presidential nominee Michael
Dukakis.
   Delegates sporting ``Greeks For George Bush _ '88'' buttons
waved the blue and white flag of Greece on the convention floor
Wednesday as the roll of the states was called on Bush's nomination.
   ``I knew Michael before he was a Greek-American,'' said Andrew
Natsios, former chairman of the Massachusetts Republican Party.
``Michael is a Yankee-Greek.''
   Dukakis has enjoyed enormous financial support from the Greek
community, and there have been celebrations in his father's
hometown in Greece over Dukakis' candidacy.
   But Natsios and other Republicans say the Massachusetts governor
never paid much attention to his immigrant roots and only began to
discuss his heritage as a campaign strategy to woo ethnic voters.

   Here is a transcript of the speech by Sen.
Phil Gramm of Texas nominating Vice President George Bush for
president at the Republican National Convention Wednesday night.
   Thank you, thank you, thank you. (Applause).
   Can you imagine, can you imagine how hard it is to be the Gramm
of Gramm-Rudman?
   Trying to do the Lord's work in the devil's city. Trying to
balance the budget and always seeing those terrible headlines:
Gramm-Rudman Cuts, Gramm-Rudman Slashes, Gramm-Rudman Denies ...
I'm still waiting for the headline: Gramm-Rudman Saves Taxpayers
Money.
   And I've finally figured out why that headline is never written
_ the people writing those headlines think that the money
government spends comes from heaven. So, when government doesn't
spend it, it's lost.
   But you and I know the real story.
   The money government spends does not come from heaven. It comes
out of the pockets of the working men and women of America, and
when government does not spend our money, it's not lost. It stays
with families to invest in the American dream and, my friends,
that's what this election is all about.
   Do you remember what the world was like in January of 1981 when
Ronald Reagan and George Bush took the oath of office?
   The amnesia merchants of the Atlanta convention want us to
forget that when the Democrats left the White House, inflation and
interest rates were at the highest levels in American history.
Prices outstripped wages, workers grew poorer, retirees saw their
lives' savings destroyed. People couldn't build or buy their own
homes or invest in their own businesses.
   Remember how we resented it when Jimmy Carter told us we had to
learn to live on less? Of course that turned out to be the good
part. The bad part was that the tax and spend policies of the
Democrats forced us to do it.
   The amnesia Democrats of Atlanta may have forgotten all that,
but we have not forgotten and, so help us God, we are not going to
allow them to do that to America again.
   Under the leadership of Ronald Reagan and George Bush, we've cut
taxes so that working people could keep more of what they earned.
We gave people incentives to work, save and invest _ and they have
worked, and saved, and invested.
   With government off our backs and out of our wallets, the genius
of our people re-emerged.
   Inflation, the No. 1 problem in the '70s, has been virtually
eliminated. We have created 17 million new permanent, taxpaying
jobs with a future. Interest rates have plummeted and home
ownership, always part of the American dream, is again part of the
American reality.
   But while the world calls our economic rebirth a miracle, the
Democrats call it a disaster. They long for the failed policies of
the past.
   The Chinese communists may be coming out from behind their
ideological Great Wall to recognize that government is the problem
and free enterprise is the answer, and perestroika may be
permeating the walls of the Kremlin, but the message of economic
freedom and opportunity has yet to register with the Democrats.

<HEAD>NEW ORLEANS: the Democrats.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   For four years, Jimmy Carter and the Democrats slashed defense.
   Readiness and morale in the military sank. Pay lagged behind
inflation and our young service men and women were forced to turn
to welfare and food stamps to feed their children, and the American
flag drooped in shame.
   Our planes didn't fly and our ships didn't sail because we
didn't have the spare parts or enough mechanics. And all over the
world the enemies of freedom were on the march.
   Under the leadership of Ronald Reagan and George Bush, all that
has changed.
   We have built and deployed new weapons. We have recruited and
retained some of the finest young men and women who've ever worn
this, the uniform of our country. And they wear that uniform with
pride all over the world tonight. And we intend to keep it that way.
   But the Reagan-Bush program has done more than rebuild defense,
more than stop inflation, more than put America back to work and
more than rebuild our position of world leadership. It has
rekindled pride and confidence in our great nation, something that
many thought had been lost, perhaps forever.
   That's our record.
   What is the Michael Dukakis record?
   In 1974, in his first campaign for governor, Michael Dukakis
promised the people of Massachusetts that he would not raise their
taxes. He broke that promise the next year with the largest tax
increase in the state's history. People called it Taxachusetts.
   He taxed the poor, taxed the rich, taxed the young, taxed the
old, taxed the middle class. He taxed businesses and he taxed
families. By the time the voters turned him out of office in 1979,
they were carrying a tax burden 44 percent above the national
average.
   Dukakis got a second chance as governor in 1983. This time, he
proved he could spend as well as tax. State spending in
Massachusetts grew twice as fast as federal spending. A billion
dollar surplus turned into a $400 million deficit.
   While Ronald Reagan and George Bush worked to rebuild defense,
Michael Dukakis opposed every major new weapons system that we've
deployed.
   Given his record, is there anybody here who doubts that a
President Dukakis would raise our taxes? (Crowd: ``No!'')
   Is there anybody here who doubts that a President Dukakis would
spend our workers into poverty? (Crowd: ``No!'')
   Is there anybody here who doubts that a President Dukakis would
cut defense, wimp America and endanger peace? (Crowd: ``No!'')
   Is there anybody here who doubts that a President Dukakis would
expand the power of government and its control over our businesses,
our families, our churches, and our lives. (Crowd: ``No!'')
   No, we don't doubt it, and by the time this election's over, the
American people aren't going to doubt it and that's why there's not
going to be a President Dukakis.
   George Bush's record of service to America spans nearly five
decades. From naval aviator to vice president George Bush has shown
again and again his love for his country, his countrymen and the
values that made America great and strong. He has never failed to
answer his nation's call to service.
   To each mission, he has brought integrity, determination and the
skill to get the job done.
   George left home and joined the Navy the week he graduated from
high school on his 18th birthday. When he got his wings at the
Corpus Christi Naval Air Station, George Bush was the youngest
pilot in the Navy.
   In the South Pacific he flew 58 combat missions. In those
missions, as in everything else he's done in his life, George Bush
showed that quiet courage that Texans and Americans have always
looked to at a time of crisis and danger.
   When he took off during an attack on the fleet and his engine
failed, George Bush didn't panic, he didn't break radio silence. He
ditched the plane and led his crew to safety.

   On a bombing run at Chichi Jima, his plane was hit, both his
crewmen were killed. As flames swept over the wings and cockpit,
George Bush remembered the first obligation of a leader is to
accomplish the mission.
   He stayed on his bombing run and dropped two tons of TNT right
on the target. He turned his crippled plane out to sea and bailed
out. The Japanese sent boats to capture him, but his fellow pilots
hovered over him, strafing the Japanese to keep them back.
   With blood streaming down his face, with a .38 revolver in one
hand, he paddled away from the shore with the other hand to be
rescued by a submarine.
   Let me read from his citation for the Distinguished Flying Cross.
   ``By his superb airmanship, courageous actions, and loyal
dedication to duty, Lieutenant Bush reflected great credit upon
himself and upheld the highest traditions of the United States
Naval Service,'' signed, Franklin Delano Roosevelt.
   My friends, my friends, when Michael Dukakis vetoed that bill
providing for the pledge of allegiance to the American flag in
Massachusetts public schools he did not represent the views of
George Bush.
   We will never have to worry about George Bush's willingness to
stand up for America.
   He knows from real life experience that peace comes through
strength, not through wishful thinking.
   The commitment of George Bush and Ronald Reagan to a strong
national defense has brought peace. It has brought the Soviets to
the bargaining table and produced the unprecedented elimination of
a whole class of nuclear weapons.
   Under George Bush's leadership, we can keep America strong and
at peace. We can let the real competition begin, a competition of
vision and ideas.
   Building on the bedrock achievements of the Reagan-Bush years,
we can move beyond simply maintaining the little freedom which
exists on this Earth.
   The defense of freedom today begins in Nicaragua and
Afghanistan, but the competition of vision and ideas can never end
until all the world is free, including the people of Central
America and Cuba and Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union itself.
   George Bush, warrior when his country needed warriors, came home
from the war and married the girl whose name was painted on the
side of his plane _ Barbara.
   He came home to continue his education and to put the American
free enterprise system to work for him and for his family. George
took his family and moved to Midland, Texas, and started in the oil
business.
   He learned the business working for others and went into
business for himself. He met the payroll, paid the bills and
pioneered new technology used today around the world.
   In time, George Bush turned again to public service, being
elected as Houston's first Republican congressman since
Reconstruction. In the House of Representatives he fought against
excessive government spending and for civil rights.
   He later served as ambassador to the United Nations, and when
history was made with the opening of relations with communist
China, George Bush was sent to Peking to represent our nation.

   He came home to head the Central Intelligence Agency where he
strengthened the intelligence community while working to guarantee
the rights of our citizens.
   Through it all, George Bush found time to be a devoted husband
and a loving father to five children and grandfather to 10.
   George Bush is the greatest vice president this nation has ever
had. He has always made us proud.
   When the Soviet Union targeted a new class of nuclear weapons at
Western Europe, destroying the military balance and threatening
peace, Vice President Bush flew to Europe to meet with our NATO
allies.
   Prime Minister Thatcher of Britain, President Mitterrand of
France, Chancellor Kohl of West Germany, and the others. They know
George Bush; they trust him; they respect him.
   And from those meetings came their decision: They would deploy
missiles in Europe.
   The threat was answered, the alliance held and Moscow
understood. And as a result, today we have an INF treaty and the
Soviet missiles are being withdrawn and destroyed. Now, that's what
leadership is about.
   As chairman of the South Florida Task Force, George Bush put
together this nation's first really successful effort to protect
our children from illegal drugs. While Michael Dukakis opposes
mandatory sentencing for the thugs who sell drugs to our children
and opposes the death penalty for drug pushers who murder our
police officers, George Bush knows that the only way you can deal
with drug pushers is to grab them by the throat.
   And with George Bush as our president, that's exactly what we're
going to do.
   Under his leadership we can and will rid America of illegal
drugs.
   America is not a great nation because brilliant and talented
people came to live here. America is a great nation because our
system offers incentives and opportunities for greatness.
   America has produced extraordinary results from plain, ordinary
common people like you and me.
   The genius of America's success lies not in the brilliance of a
few, but in the spirit of enterprise, work and family of all of us
who call ourselves Americans.
   Our program has rekindled that spirit to bring greater
prosperity to more people than ever before. But we have only
scratched the surface of what America can be.
   With George Bush as our president, with Dan Quayle as our vice
president building on the success of the last eight years, there is
no limit to the future of the American people.
   I am honored to place in nomination the name of a man who has
served America in war and in peace, who has the experience, the
character and the strength to lead this great land we love.
   Mr. Chairman, I nominate, for president of the United States,
George Bush of Houston, Texas.

<HEAD>Text of Dole Speech</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here is a transcript of the speech by Sen.
Bob Dole of Kansas to the Republican National Convention Wednesday
night.
   Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
Thank you very much. I accept the nomination as majority leader of
the United States Senate.
   Let me underscore my priorities for 1988.
   First of all, I am committed to electing George Bush president
of the United States in November.
   I am committed to electing Republicans to Congress.
   So tonight, I am asking you to help us strengthen our party in
the House, and to help us regain the majority in the United States
Senate.
   I am ready and eager to serve as George Bush's point man in a
Republican controlled Senate come January. I promise to beat back
any Democratic schemes to raise your taxes, or any effort to weaken
our national defense.
   Let me congratulate my colleague Dan Quayle _ our next vice
president.
   I talked to Dan yesterday, I called to congratulate him. I
interrupted him. He was shaving _ for the first time.
   And I can say to my friends all across America I am proud to
have been his leader in the United States Senate. He is young, he's
dynamic, he's articulate. And he's already had 12 years experience
in Congress. If only the Democratic nominee had had half as much we
would be in a stronger position.
   This year's election represents a crossroads for America. The
alternatives have never been more obvious or the consequences more
important.
   The issues will be defense and deficits and detente and drugs.
But the bottom line question is: what kind of country will America
be as it enters a new century. Will we be truly strong, or barely
strong enough? Will we be self-confident, or self-doubting? Will we
be on the march, or at a standstill?
   Strength and security _ the founding fathers saw these two words
as an essential link between them 200 years ago. And we Republicans
see it today. We are secure as individuals only when the country we
live in is strong and confident. And when our country is weak and
uncertain and lacking in will, we are all vulnerable.
   The link between the strength of our nation and the security of
our people seems obvious. But there are always some, and there are
some out there now who never get the picture.
   These people _ the liberal doom sayers _ believe that America
cannot be trusted. They believe that the disarming of America is a
noble goal. They do not understand that America must be strong if
America is to be free. We understand _ all of us in this hall; in
this party and across the country; and of course, George Bush
understands, and George Bush has understood for a long, long time,
the importance of freedom.
   But the Democratic nominee does not. He is undoubtedly a fine
man. He did an excellent job in gaining his party's nomination. He
will work hard between now and November. But unfortunately, he is
one of those liberals who does not know where to draw the line, and
this puts America at risk.
   He seems willing to throw away the Monroe Doctrine. He says he
can live with Soviet client states in Central America. Oh, yes, he
speaks Spanish freely on the campaign trail. But he is not
concerned whether Spanish-speaking people in Central America have
the right to be free.
   And that's the difference.
   The governor is one of those liberals who is suspicious of
America's strength; embarrassed when America asserts its rights;
uncomfortable when America stands on the side of freedom.
   One of those liberals who knocks our president, questions his
principles, and assails his policies. One of those liberals who
suffers a sudden lapse of memory when it comes to the outrages of
the ayatollah, Colonel Gadhafi, Comandante Ortega and other Third
World tyrants.

<TEXT>
   One of those liberals with strange ideas _ Dukak-eyed ideas _
yes, Dukak-eyed ideas _ Dukak-eyed ideas about the way the world
works.
   And think about the last time this kind of liberal occupied the
White House. Think about the four years of malaise and
mismanagement, of disaster.
   Think about all the countries that fell into the Soviet orbit.
Think about Cambodia, where Marxism led to genocide. And think
about Ethiopia, where Marxism led to famine. And Nicaragua, where
Marxism has led to a Soviet beachhead in the Americas. And think
about all these places where the liberals did not know where, or
how, to draw the line.
   And then, and then, think about Grenada, where Ronald Reagan and
George Bush did draw the line, and where its people now have a
democracy. And think about Libya, where Reagan and Bush drew the
line, and they silenced the terrorists. And think about
Afghanistan, where by drawing the line, this administration, Ronald
Reagan and George Bush helped a courageous people survive, and kept
alive their dreams of freedom.
   And think about Angola. And because we backed the freedom
fighters in Angola, a negotiated settlement is possible that could
result in the departure of 40,000 Cuban mercenaries.
   And yes, think about the Persian Gulf, think about the Persian
Gulf. Because we insisted, you insisted, that the American Navy
should draw a line protecting freedom of the seas, and because of
that the end of the Iran-Iraq war is in sight.
   Now I ask you this question, would this have happened if the
liberals had been in the White House? (Crowd: ``No!'')
   Would there have been an improvement in relations with Moscow
and an INF Treaty? (Crowd: ``No!'')
   You got it right both times.
   And you're right and I'll tell you why: because these liberals
define arms control this way: the Soviets arm, while we control.
   And liberals like the Massachusetts governor never get the
picture. They fail to understand that a strong America keeps the
peace. And a weak America invites danger.
   Harry Truman understood where to draw the line in 1947. And
because he did, Greece is a free nation today.
   John F. Kennedy understood where to draw the line in 1962, and
because he did, the Soviet missiles were yanked out of Cuba.
   And those kind of mainstream Democrats who still believe in a
strong national defense are now outcasts in their own party. And
today's liberals, led by Jesse Jackson and Michael Dukakis, will
never understand. They don't have a clue.
   For them, it's always mourning in America _ mourning with a
``U.'' A time to mourn America's recovery, a time to mourn
America's strength, a time to mourn America's new sense of purpose.
   But on the other hand, George Bush understands that strength and
freedom are two sides of the same coin.
   And as a young pilot he risked his life for his country in the
skies of the Pacific. As Ronald Reagan stated Monday evening, he
has helped give this country eight of the best years it has ever
had. That's why I'm proud of George Bush. That's why George Bush is
going to be elected in November of this year.
   And George Bush and Dan Quayle support SDI because it provides
defense against the accidents that cause war, and this keeps the
peace. He supports the B-1 bomber and the stealth bomber and the MX
and Midgetman missiles. Because they deter aggression. And this,
too, keeps the peace.
   George Bush and Dan Quayle support freedom fighters around the
world. And what does the Democratic candidate support? What
programs to keep America truly strong and free?
   Let me list them for you. (Pause.)
   I haven't lost my place, I just can't think of any. There's
gotta be one out there somewhere.
   His idea of national defense is ``one if by land, and two if by
sea'' _ if you can get through the polluted waters of Boston Harbor.
   In the world according to the Massachusetts liberal, defending
liberty is dangerous and it costs too much.

<TEXT>
   But there's a real world out there. Where America must provide
real leadership.
   In the world according to the Massachusetts liberal, America
should get an OK first from the United Nations before we ever do
anything.
   But there's a real world out there. And sometimes America must
act on its own to protect our interests, and your interests and
your children's interests.
   And in the world according to the Massachusetts liberal,
communism and terrorism and drugs are just issues to be managed.
   But there's a real world out there where America must defend the
freedoms we cherish, and stand against those who would take those
freedoms away.
   And finally, let me remind Americans _ all Americans,
Republicans and Democrats and independents _ there is no owner's
manual for the Oval Office. You don't learn to lead a nation
through on-the-job training or by having Harvard professors come to
Washington for a seminar.
   So, this campaign really boils down to one thing, keep one thing
in mind in this campaign, and that's leadership. And leadership
involves many things, but chief among them is knowing when to say
yes and when to say no.
   There's nothing more important. It is the mark of character in a
leader. It can change the course of history.
   In the early 1980s, for example, the Massachusetts liberal and
his fellow liberals were saying yes to the nuclear freeze and
George Bush was saying no. George Bush knew that the freeze the
Massachusetts liberal supported would have frozen in place 1,500
nuclear-tipped Soviet missiles aimed at the heart of Europe, and
frozen out of Europe our missiles.
   The Massachusetts liberal predicted that this would prolong the
Cold War.
   Well, he had it exactly wrong. It was only after our missiles
arrived in Europe that the Soviets began to bargain. And they
bargained until all of the intermediate-range missiles were gone.
And the bargaining is not over yet.
   Because Ronald Reagan and George Bush had said no to the huge
Soviet military build-up that took place the last time the liberals
were in charge, and no to the Soviet expansionism of the Carter
years _ because they said no to Soviet aggression _ Ronald Reagan
and George Bush were able to say yes to improved relations with the
Soviet Union.
   So knowing when to say yes and when to say no _ it separates
leadership from mere office-holding, it separates leaders from
technocrats.
   And so, yes, the 1988 election is very serious business.
   We're electing a president, and also the next leader of the free
world.
   And I realized this fully just three months ago in Moscow. I was
with President Reagan as he put his final seal on his historic arms
control treaty with the Soviet Union.
   And while there, I was seated next to Mikhail Gorbachev at a
state dinner. And for nearly three hours, I had an opportunity to
exchange views with him, face-to-face. And let me tell you, I was
impressed. Gorbachev is smart. He's shrewd. And believe me, he is
committed to the goals of the communist world he leads.
   After dinner, as I was driven back to my hotel, our car passed
through Red Square, and past the forbidding skyline of the Kremlin.
And I thought about Gorbachev, I thought to myself, and I thought
what might lie ahead. And I knew that the free world could not
afford to deal with this hard-as-nails communist with an untested,
unprepared, unsure president _ someone who did not know where to
draw the line, someone who did not know when to say yes and when to
say no.
   Today, we look at the world and our place in it, and say, thank
God for Ronald Reagan.
   Four years from now, we'll be meeting again. We will think about
the world again, we will think how fortunate it was that the
American voters _ Republicans and Democrats and independents _
didn't make a mistake in 1988. And we'll say in 1992, thank God for
George Bush!
   Thank you very much.

   Mounting fines against Yonkers have been further
delayed while a federal appeals court decides whether the judge who
imposed them exceeded his authority to punish the city for
resisting housing desegregation.
   The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals continued a stay Wednesday
of potentially crippling fines leveled against the city and four
city councilmen for refusing to approve the court-ordered
desegregation plan.
   The three-judge panel did not say when it would rule on whether
to uphold the contempt citation and fines imposed by U.S. District
Judge Leonard B. Sand. On Aug. 1, the council refused by a 4-3 vote
to endorse the affordable housing plan that would integrate the
state's fourth-largest city. The plan calls for 200 units of
low-income housing and 800 units of moderate-income housing to be
built in the predominantly white east side.
   The escalating fines against the city began at $100, doubling
daily. The fines would surpass the city's entire $337 million
budget in 22 days. The city's fines had accumulated to $26,500 when
the appeals court ordered them temporarily halted last week pending
the appeal of the contempt order.
   The appeals court also stayed Sand's $500-a-day fines against
the four councilmen, who were to be jailed on Aug. 11 before the
2nd Circuit stepped in.
   The City Council again rejected the housing desegregation plan
early Tuesday by the same vote.
   At the hearing before the appeals court Wednesday, Yonkers
attorney Michael W. Sculnick said Sand had exceeded his judicial
discretion in imposing the crippling fines.
   Calling the council hopelessly divided, Sculnick said the city
should not be made to suffer. He said Sand should have bypassed the
council and deemed the housing plan approved himself or else
appointed a housing commission to implement the plan.
   ``The city is stuck. It is incapable of complying with the
federal court's order,'' said Sculnick. He said the four councilmen
had their own political agendas and were playing ``what amounts to
a game of chicken'' waiting for the other guy to change his vote.
   Linda Thome, an attorney for the Justice Department's civil
rights division, said the fines must be reimposed because ``it is
essential that the city be required now to comply with the federal
court's order.''

<TEXT>
   Three scared brothers hid a teen-age
friend's body in a vacant house for 10 days after an accidental
shotgun blast killed him, police say.
   Preliminary autopsy results performed Wednesday indicated that
William Dennis Bowen III, 14, died of a shotgun wound to the head,
said George Pinckney, a police spokesman.
   Tests were being conducted to determine, among other things,
whether Bowen died instantly, Pickney said.
   After questioning the brothers, ages 12, 14 and 15, authorities
believe the Aug. 7 shooting was an accident, Pinckney said. Bowen
had been reported missing by his parents on Aug. 8.
   No charges have been filed and the investigation continues.
   Names of the brothers were not released because they are
juveniles.
   Bowen's body was discovered Tuesday, after one of the youths
told an adult about it.
   The four had been playing with a shotgun they had found in an
apartment of a relative of the brothers, the youth told police. The
relative wasn't at home. After the weapon discharged, the brothers
stashed Bowen's body in a vacant house next door, police said.

   A judge seized Maria DeSillers' BMW and scheduled a
hearing to decide whether she should be found in contempt of court
for failing to surrender other items allegedly bought with money
donated for her son's liver transplants.
   The $13,500 car was towed away Wednesday from the Coral Gables
office of her attorney. It will remain in storage until the
conclusion of the case, Dade Circuit Judge Francis Christie said.
   Christie scheduled the hearing for next Wednesday. He delayed a
decision on whether Ms. DeSillers can retain a burial plot near the
grave of her son, Ronnie, 7, who died last year after three
unsuccessful transplants.
   Ms. DeSillers' attorney, Roy Black, said he was pleased to have
a chance to present witnesses next week, but refused to comment on
the day's other developments.
   Earlier, Christie made no comment when denying the defense
motion that sought to oust Karen Gievers as curator of Ronnie's
estate. Ms. Gievershas been seeking the car, jewelry and other
items she said Ms. DeSillers purchased with donations for her son.
   Ms. DeSillers' attorney in financial matters, Frank Johnson, who
brought the motion, charged Ms. Gievers has been ``spending money
that was not necessary'' from the estate since her appointment by
Christie on March 7.
   Johnson asked for three days to produce expert testimony from
trust companies to back his motion that a new curator be appointed.
   But Ms. Gievers' lawyer, Michael Dribin, characterized Johnson's
request ``a further delaying tactic.''
   He accused Ms. DeSillers' attorney of seeking an indirect
continuance of Christie's Aug. 8 court order demanding Ms.
DeSillers surrender the contested belongings.
   Christie had extended the court deadline for Ms. DeSillers'
surrender of the items five times before Wednesday's hearing.
   Ms. Gievers has charged Ms. DeSillers spent up to $200,000 of
the nearly $700,000 raised in donations for her son's medical
expenses.

<HEAD>Premiere Tonight of New Work That May Be Mozart's</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Music lovers attending tonight's performance by
the Chicago Symphony Winds can expect to hear the American premiere
of a new work of Mozart's.
   Then again, maybe not.
   The question of the authenticity of the score _ a wind band
arrangement titled ```Harmoniemusik,'' which is part of Mozark's
opera ``The Abduction From the Seraglio'' _ along with that of
other scores found periodically, remain the topic of scholarly
debate.
   The piece was discovered last year in West Germany by Bastiaan
Blonhert, a Dutch musicologist.
   In a letter to his father dated July 20, 1782, Mozart wrote that
he hoped to complete a wind arrangement of the opera quickly ``or
else someone will step in front of me and reap the profit.''
   Whether he actually completed the work is not known. However,
musicologist H.C. Robbins Landon said that a newspaper article
written in August 1782 advertises a wind band performance of the
work, noting that ``tickets are available from the lemonade seller
at the new market.''
   The copy found in West Germany is not in Mozart's handwriting.
Nor is it in the handwriting of any of the copyists Mozart was
known to employ.
   While more evidence is certainly in order, Landon said, ``I find
a great deal in the music itself that leads me to believe that this
is Mozart's work.''
   Whoever crafted the work, Landon noted, was ``certainly not a
hack.''

<HEAD>Elton John Sells Out Two Hollywood Bowl Shows In Record Time</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Elton John, the bespectacled piano-playing
pop star known for his outlandish costumes and fiery performances,
sold out two shows at the Hollywood Bowl in 24 hours, a record for
the landmark venue, officials said.
   The single day sell-out for shows scheduled on Sept. 23-24 was
the fastest run on tickets for a multiple show at the 18,000-seat
arena, spokeswoman Sarah McMullen said Wednesday.
   It will be John's first appearance at the bowl, nestled in the
Hollywood Hills, since his ``Too Low For Zero'' tour in 1982. The
upcoming dates are part of his 15-city ``Reg Strikes Back'' U.S.
tour that kicks off in Miami on Sept. 9.
   The 41-year-old singer is known for his many hit recordings
during the 1970s and '80s, including `Your Song,'' ``Goodbye Yellow
Brick Road,'' ``Rocket Man,'' ``Island Girl,'' ``Pinball Wizard''
and ``I'm Still Standing.''

   A housewife who admitted she helped her
late husband hijack a plane to Cuba nearly two decades ago says she
was a severely battered wife at the time and was driven to the
crime partly out of terror.
   Linda Joyce Grinage of Albany pleaded guilty Wednesday in U.S.
District Court to the least of three charges against her, that of
interfering with the crew of an Eastern Airlines jet bound for
Miami from New York on Jan. 2, 1969.
   ``I knew what my husband had planned,'' Mrs. Grinage said. ``I
was terrified of my husband. If he told me to walk off the side of
a building I would have done so.''
   But the 39-year-old woman, who is also known as Haziine Eytina,
said in response to a question by Judge Jacob Mishler that she
voluntarily participated in the crime, during which a 2-year-old
boy was taken hostage.
   ``I went into the cockpit and obstructed everyone from leaving
the cockpit,'' she said in a barely audible voice.
   The bespectacled woman, wearing a white dress and a pink bandana
on her head, was accompanied by her attorney and her second
husband, Mylo Eytina, also an attorney.
   Grinage also was charged in an indictment with air piracy and
interference with a flight crew with a deadly weapon. Both of those
charges, which are expected to be dismissed at an Oct. 28
sentencing, carry maximum life terms.
   She admitted to the least of the charges, interference without
the use of a weapon. Grinage, who is being held without bail at the
Metropolitan Correction Center in Manhattan, faces a maximum of 20
years in prison and a $10,000 fine.
   Grinage and her first husband, Tyrone Ellington Austin of New
York City, were accused of diverting the plane to Havana after
taking a 2-year-old Long Island boy hostage, putting a gun to his
head and threatening to kill him. The child, his mother and the
other 146 people on board were freed unharmed when the plane landed
in Havana.
   Grinage and Austin remained in Cuba for an unknown period of
time.
   Austin was killed in Manhattan in 1971 in a gunfight with police
during a bank robbery.
   Grinage has been living in the Albany area for about 10 years
with her husband and five children. She was arrested here last
month after the FBI received an anonymous tip.
   Her attorney, Edward Wilford, said his client had wanted to turn
herself in a number of times but ``just couldn't bring herself to
do it.''
   ``She was not a fugitive,'' Wilford said outside the courthouse.
``She lived in the open as a housewife. She wasn't sneaking
around.''
   He said her husband was ``shocked and amazed'' when he learned
of his wife's involvement in the hijacking.

<HEAD>Thunderstorms Cause Injuries, Evacuation; Heat Abates in Some
Regions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Thunderstorms continued this morning in various parts of the
nation after forcing 50 people to evacuate a motel and injuring 14
people at a circus tent.
   Meanwhile, areas that have been scorched by record heat could
look forward to some relief today, forecasters said.
   In Branson, Mo., a storm tore the roof off the Music Country
Motor Inn, blowing it into the parking lot of a country music show.
One person suffered minor injuries and several cars were damaged,
police said. The American Red Cross helped the people displaced
from the motel find new lodging.
   Authorities in Lavallette, N.J., said a 30-foot-high circus tent
was mostly empty Wednesday night when a furious thunderstorm with
high winds knocked it down, slightly injuring 14 people. The tent
over Vidbel's Old Tyme Circus of Wyndham, N.Y., collapsed minutes
after Wednesday night's first show ended, and after patrons had
been advised to leave early.
   A heat wave departed Ohio after delivering a final blast of
scorching temperatures that set records across the state, prompting
unprecedented use of electricity.
   And with forecasters predicting a cold front, Illinois residents
looked today for some respite from the scalding summer heat that
brought record triple-digit temperatures to most of the state.
   A storm that stalled over Denver dumped up to 2 inches of rain
Wednesday, flooding Interstate 25 with two feet of standing water
that closed the highway at rush hour.
   In Michigan, severe thunderstorms produced large hail and
damaging winds. Gusts up to 65 mph at Mount Pleasant downed many
trees and severely damaged three homes, and a thunderstorm at
Webberville knocked trees onto parked cars.
   Thunderstorms extended from southeastern Wisconsin across lower
Michigan into northern Ohio early this morning, and widely
scattered showers and thunderstorms continued across the southern
and central Plains. A few storms also developed in South Dakota.
   Showers also were widely scattered in Washington state, northern
Idaho and northwestern Montana. A few showers and thunderstorms
also lingered over Arizona and New Mexico.
   Cloudy skies prevailed to the north of a cold front in the
north-central United States, while the South and West enjoyed fair
skies.
   The nation's high Wednesday was 114 degrees at Borrego Springs
and Palm Springs, Calif., and Laughlin, Nev.
   Today's forecast called for cooler temperatures through the
Middle Atlantic states and the lower Ohio Valley. Showers and
thunderstorms were expected from the mid-Atlantic Coast through the
lower Ohio Valley into eastern Iowa and southern Wisconsin, and
from the central Rockies through the central Plains, Arkansas,
eastern and southern Texas and the Gulf Coast region into Florida.
   Highs should be in the 80s or 90s across much of the nation;
near 100 in the Tennessee Valley; in the 70s along the Pacific
Coast into the Pacific Northwest, and from the upper Mississippi
Valley through the Great Lakes region into New England; in the
upper 60s in northeast Minnesota and northern Maine; and 110 from
the desert Southwest into the California valleys.
   Temperatures at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 46 at Yellowstone Park,
Wyo., to 95 at Phoenix.

<HEAD>Conference: `Time is Now' To End Corporal Punishment In Schools</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES LITKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A coalition calling for an end to corporal
punishment in the nation's schools says the most difficult obstacle
may be the attitude of parents who practice it at home.
   ``A study several years back found that 90 percent of parents
use corporal punishment in their own homes. That tells us we've got
a lot of educating to do,'' Adrienne Haeuser of the National
Association of Social Workers said Wednesday as educators, lawyers
and doctors gathered for the first conference of its kind in a
decade.
   More than a million incidents of corporal punishment are
reported in the nation's public schools each year, ranging from
paddling to confining students in small spaces such as closets,
according to U.S. Department of Education figures.
   ``In large part, the parents don't quite understand the
consequences (of corporal punishment at home),'' Ms. Haeuser said.
``They learn from their parents, and they figure if they got hit,
it's OK to hit their own children.''
   Keynote speaker Bob Keeshan, known to millions of children as
TV's Captain Kangaroo, called corporal punishment a failed practice.
   ``It rates an `F' because it does not meet its stated purpose of
maintaining discipline, and because it treats the symptoms and not
the cause of the underlying unruly behavior,'' Keeshan said.
   ``With that behavior a child is crying out, `Help me, help me.'
And we answer with the compassion of the paddle.''
   The theme of the three-day conference, which brought together 23
prominent medical, legal and educational organizations, is ``The
Time is Now.'' Organizer Robert Fathman said the groups are banding
into a coalition to capitalize on a growing movement by state
legislatures to outlaw corporal punishment.
   Eleven states and a number of school districts, ranging in size
from Chicago's to that of Seaford, Del., which has a population of
5,250, have outlawed corporal punishment in schools since New
Jersey became the first state to do so in 1867.
   But, Fathman said, five states have passed measures banning the
practice since 1984, six state legislatures have similar bills
pending and another six will face the issue during their 1989
sessions.
   The purpose of this week's conference, Fathman said, is to
provide organizational skills and information to parents, educators
and other interested people so they can campaign to eliminate the
practice in schools.
   Fathman said black children, who represent 16 percent of the
country's school-age population, make up a disproportionate 32
percent of those punished, and that children ``in the Deep South
are 4,000 times more likely to be paddled than their counterparts
in the Northeast,'' where Connecticut is the only state without a
law barring the practice.
   In a joint statement preceding the opening of the conference,
the American Medical Association, the American Bar Association, the
American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Psychological
Association denounced corporal punishment and called on legislators
to ``enact laws accordingly.''

<HEAD>Hand-Held Metal Detectors To Be Used In Five Schools</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Worried by an increase in weapons found in city
schools, Schools Chancellor Richard Green has proposed buying
hand-held metal detectors and hiring new guards to make unannounced
checks in five high schools.
   The plan would cost $2.8 million, far less than the $9 million
estimate for an earlier plan calling for walk-through metal
detectors, Green said at a news conference Wednesday. The first
proposal was deemed too costly, he said.
   Green said more than 150 students were found carrying guns
during the past school year. The total number of weapons possession
incidents last year was 1,960, compared with 1,495 in the 1986-87
school year.
   If the plan is approved by the Board of Education, students who
carry weapons or assault staff will be transferred to one of five
Outreach Centers, currently used for counseling dropouts. The metal
detectors will also be used there.
   Students now can only be suspended for five days twice in a
school year, and then usually transferred to another school,
returned to their home school or occasionally placed in an
alternative program.
   ``It's going to go a long way in getting rid of guns and ending
assaults on teachers,'' said Sandra Feldman, president of the
teachers union.
   But Rob Levy, staff counsel to the New York Civil Liberties
Union, said the metal detector policy was wrong. ``Searches should
be based on individualized suspicion,'' he said.

   Two bank robbers who roared
out of West Germany after killing a teen-age hostage on a hijacked
bus sped back today with two female hostages and a wounded female
accomplice, police said.
   Police spokesman Hermann Wahl said the BMW the bandits extorted
from Dutch authorities in return for hostages' freedom was parked
in front of a regional television and radio affiliate in the Rhine
River city of Cologne.
   The gunmen left the Netherlands about 6:30 a.m. in the
high-powered car and returned to this country, where on Wednesday
they killed a teen-ager among 25 hostages on the bus.
   A West German police officer was also killed Wednesday in a car
crash while pursuing the bus, and two hostages were shot and
wounded early today before the hijackers left the Netherlands,
authorities said.
   Their conditions were not known.
   Police said the remaining 23 hostages either escaped or were
freed after the bus rolled to a stop about 1:45 a.m. in the
Netherlands, two days after the crime spree began.
   Police spokesman Hermann Wahl in the city of Recklinghausen, 40
miles north of Cologne, said the female accomplice apparently was
shot today in the Netherlands when two of the hostages tried to
flee.
   Hesse state radio in Frankfurt said the bandits stopped at a
pharmacy after returning to West Germany to get medicine and
bandages for her.
   West Germany's ARD television network showed lengthy footage of
the chase, including shots of one bandit counting a wad of cash.
   Wahl said that after most of the hostages were set free near the
Dutch border town of Oldenzaal, the assailants, their companion and
two female hostages got into the BMW and raced back into West
Germany at about 8 a.m.
   He said the condition of the bus hostages was ``good'' and they
were being examined by doctors.
   Wahl identified the gunmen as Hans-Juergen Roesner, 31, and
Dieter Degowski, 32. The accomplice's name was not released. Wahl
said she joined the hijacking after it started, but did not specify
when.
   The crime spree began Tuesday with a bank robbery in the West
German city of Gladbeck. The robbers escaped with two hostages and
$227,000 in a car provided by police.
   The gunmen next surfaced Wednesday in the West German city of
Bremen, about 135 miles from Gladbeck. There, police said they
opened fire in a vegetable market and took a third hostage. No one
was injured.
   The bandits then commandeered a nearby passenger bus and drove
away with 30 hostages. Five elderly people were later freed.
   Along a West German highway en route to the Netherlands, the
hijackers shot a 15-year-old boy on the bus and dumped him at a
highway rest stop.
   The victim, an Italian whose identity was not released, died
later in a Bremen hospital, police said.
   A West German police officer was also killed and two others
injured in a car crash while pursuing the bus. No further details
on that incident were immediately available.
   Police in the Netherlands said the hijackers freed five hostages
after crossing the border, but demanded a getaway car in return for
freedom for the remaining captives. During the stand-off, the bus
sat in a deserted parking lot about 115 miles southwest of Bremen.
   Police cordoned off the area, and onlookers and reporters were
kept at least 1.5 miles away.
   The ZDF television network showed film of one bandit holding his
pistol against the head of a small girl outside the bus in Bremen.
   ARD television showed lengthy footage of the chase, including
shots of one bandit counting cash.
   The female accomplice had earlier been seized by West German
police when the bus stopped at a highway rest area, but police let
her go when one of the gunmen threatened to shoot a hostage.
   Two hostages were freed there at the rest area. Associated Press
photographer Peter Maer said that as the bus headed back onto the
highway, the gunmen opened fire inside, their bullets smashing
windows.
   Many passengers could be seen standing in the back of the bus,
Maer said, but he did not know whether the bandits were shooting at
the hostages or just at the windows.

<HEAD>Botha Says Mandela May Not Have To Return To Prison From Hospital</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GREG MYRE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DURBAN, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President P.W. Botha said today that
African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela may not have to
return to prison from the hospital where he is being treated for
tuberculosis.
   Botha said Mandela had been cooperating with the government and
he now expects ``positive results'' from his standing offer to free
the 70-year-old black leader in return for renunciation of violence.
   In his speech to the provincial National Party congress in
Natal, Botha did not explain what he meant by cooperation. However,
it was seen as a strong suggestion of a change in the way Mandela's
case is being viewed, possibly because he is being treated for
tuberculosis at Tygerberg Hospital in Cape Town.
   The outlawed African National Congress is the major guerrilla
group fighting the while-ruled government and apartheid, its policy
of racial segregation. Mandela has been in prison since 1962 and is
serving a life term for sabotage and conspiracy to overthrow the
government.
   ``The government, in a responsible way, will consider the matter
and if we get the cooperation we have so far got from Mr. Mandela,
I believe we will get positive results,'' Botha said.
   ``Personally, I don't think that at his age and condition it
would be wise for him to choose to go back to prison and I hope he
will make it possible for me to act in a humane way so that we can
have peace in South Africa.''
   Botha's speech followed a meeting with Justice Minister Kobie
Coetsee, who visited Mandela at the hospital on Wednesday.
   ``He appears to be comfortable and appears to have taken the
first steps towards recovery. He appears to be satisfied with his
treatment and surroundings,'' Coetsee said of Mandela.
   ``He looks as though he is almost his old self and he is already
enjoying jokes. I think it will be in his own interest to remain in
the medical care of the specialists who are attending him at the
moment.''
   Asked what cooperation Mandela had given, Information Minister
Stoffel said: ``For example, Mandela did not try to use the
occasion (of his hospitalization last week) as a propaganda stunt.''
   He said it was not Mandela, but his lawyer and friends, who
demanded outside medical attention and revealed the nature of his
illness.
   Stoffel Van der Merwe, the information minister, said the
government was not expecting Mandela to sign anything, or even
publicly disavow the guerrilla group's policy, but it expected that
he would not participate in or promote violent activities.
   Tom Lodge, a University of the Witwatersrand academic who is
South Africa's foremost expert on the congress, said in a radio
interview: ``I don't think Mandela will accept anything other than
unconditional release.'' But he said that ``if he is ill, it is
unlikely that he would be involved ... in violence.''
   Van der Merwe said last month that Mandela already had served
enough time for his crime and security was the the only reason he
was still in prison.
   The government ``would like to see old men like him go out of
jail,'' van der Merwe said today. ``It cannot do that if the result
will be lives lost in South Africa.''
   Mandela has rejected previous offers by Botha to free him if he
renounces violence, responding that the government must end
apartheid and legalize the African National Congress.
   In a major policy speech today, Botha said he was unwilling even
to discuss the possibility of a black majority government in South
Africa.
   ``We don't want to be a second Rhodesia, we don't want to be a
second Zaire. We are standing here in a firm way,'' he said to loud
applause from the crowd of about 500.
   Last year, the government unconditionally freed Govan Mbeki, 77,
an elderly African National Congress official who was imprisoned
for life at the same time as Mandela.
   Mbeki said he had not renounced violence or the congress. After
a few public appearances, the government banned him from addressing
audiences, giving newspaper interviews or leaving his home of Port
Elizabeth.
   Under apartheid, South Africa's 26 million blacks have no vote
in national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and
maintain separate districts, schools and health services.

   A drug used to treat patients complaining
of chest pain also could help prevent recurring heart attacks in
four out of five heart patients, according to a study published in
today's edition of the New England Journal of Medicine.
   Surprisingly, however, the study found that the drug, diltiazem,
increases the chance of a subsequent heart attack in patients whose
hearts pump abnormally, experts said.
   Even so, the results may trigger an increase in the use of the
drug, which is now primarily used to treat angina, doctors said.
   The drug was tested in 38 hospitals in the United States and
Canada on patients who had recently suffered a heart attack, said
Dr. Arthur Moss, a clinical professor of medicine at the University
of Rochester and the principal investigator for the study.
   The results suggest the drug may be quite effective in
decreasing the likelihood of a second heart attack in the majority
of patients, Moss said. But the study also surprisingly suggests
that patients who suffer pulmonary congestion should not be given
diltiazem because the drug increases the chance of a subsequent
heart attack.
   ``We now know when to prescribe this drug and when not to,''
Moss said. ``That's what this study was all about.''
   Diltiazem is a calcium entry blocker, the newest class of drugs
to be introduced in the fight against heart disease. Nitrates and
beta blockers are the other types commonly prescribed by doctors.
   The study involved 2,466 heart attack patients, who were given
either 240 milligrams of diltiazem a day or a placebo. Patients
were recruited from 1983 to 1986 and followed for 12 to 52 months.
   Overall, the drug only decreased additional heart attacks 11
percent, which was not statistically significant, Moss said.
   But in patients who had normal or near-normal heart pump
function _ 1,909 patients or 80 percent of the total group _
diltiazem decreased the chance of another heart attack by 25
percent, Moss said.
   In patients whose hearts had pumping problems, the drug not only
didn't help, but it increased the chance of a heart attack by 25
percent.
   Dr. John Schroeder, a cardiologist and professor at Stanford
University, said he was surprised that the drug increased the
chance of heart attack in any group and that overall results were
not higher.
   ``But the bottom line is that this is the first study to show
that diltiazem can be effective,'' Schroeder said. ``I think it
will mean that more patients will be routinely put on this drug on
a long-term basis.''
   Dr. George Beller, a cardiologist and professor at the
University of Virginia, said he was also somewhat surprised about
the increase in heart attacks in the group suffering pulmonary
congestion.
   ``This is one of the first reports that seems to identify
that,'' he said.
   Diltiazem and two other calcium entry blockers were introduced
in the past decade, Beller said, and research into how effective
they are in various applications is in its early stages.
   Nitrates have been used for more than 50 years, and beta
blockers were developed in the 1960s.

   Pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem extremists
holding at least two American hostages said today they will not
release any captives unless all their demands are met.
   The typewritten statement from Islamic Jihad was delivered to
the Beirut office of the Reuters news agency along with a
black-and-white photograph of American hostage Terry Anderson.
   Islamic Jihad, or Holy War, has admitted holding Anderson and
Thomas Sutherland. A total of 18 foreigners, including nine
Americans, are missing and believed kidnapped in Lebanon.
   Anderson, 40, of Lorain, Ohio, is the chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press. He is the longest-held
foreign captive, kidnapped in Moslem west Beirut on March 16, 1985.
   Anderson's photograph was released with the Arabic-language
statement in the group's normal way of proving the statement is
authentic.
   The photograph, the 10th of Anderson released by Islamic Jihad,
showed the captive from the chest up with a bushy beard and an
untrimmed moustache. He was wearing a sweatshirt and looking
straight into the camera without his glasses.
   On Wednesday night, a telephone call to Reuters, purportedly
from Islamic Jihad, said British hostage Terry Waite, an Anglican
church envoy, may be freed on a Shiite anniversary Monday if the
British government shows ``good intentions.''
   The developments came during speculation that Iran might use its
influence on its supporters in Lebanon to release the hostages. A
cease-fire in the Iran-Iraq war is scheduled to start Saturday, and
Iran has been making conciliatory statements toward the West since
accepting the U.N.-sponsored cease-fire on July 18.
   But the Islamic Jihad statement released today said: ``None of
the captives will be released until our demands are met in full.''
   The statement outlined the demands as:
   ``The release of all our mujahedeen (holy fighters) from all
Arab and foreign prisons (including 17 Shiites convicted in the
1983 bombings of the U.S. and French embassies in Kuwait and now
held in Kuwaiti prisons).
   ``The release of all Lebanese and Palestinian mujahedeen from
the prisons of Israel and its surrogates in the (southern Lebanese)
security zone and (Christian) east Beirut.
   ``The unconditional withdrawal of all the Israeli forces and
their allies from south Lebanon.
   ``The reconstruction of south Lebanon and Beirut which have been
devastated by the American-Israeli plot and compensation for our
oppressed people in Lebanon for all the losses it suffered.''
   The statement said any expected rapid release of the hostages is
``a mirage assumed to be water by a thirsty man.''
   ``We are the only side that decides the fate of the captives, be
it at the level of releasing them, executing them or maintaining
their detention.''
   The Wednesday night caller said in Arabic, ``British hostage
Terry Waite is alive and we might release him if the government of
(British Prime Minister Margaret) Thatcher showed good intentions.''
   Waite, 48, disappeared Jan. 28, 1987 after leaving a west Beirut
hotel to negotiate the release of hostages with representatives of
Islamic Jihad.
   There was no way to authenticate the telephoned statement, which
would be the first admission by Islamic Jihad that it holds Waite.
No group has formally claimed responsibility for his abduction.
   In addition to Anderson, the group has admitted holding
Sutherland, 57, of Fort Collins, Colo. Sutherland, acting dean of
agriculture at the American University of Beirut, was abducted June
9, 1985.
   Islamic Jihad repeatedly has warned not to trust the
authenticity of telephone statements attributed to it.
   But a man claiming to speak for Islamic Jihad announced the
release of three French hostages in a May 4 telephone call to the
east Beirut headquarters of the Christian radio station, Voice of
Lebanon. The three were released in Moslem west Beirut less than an
hour later.
   The telephone caller said Wednesday that Waite would be released
``on the occasion of Ashoura,'' a Shiite anniversary of the 7th
century killing of Imam Hussein, the prophet Mohammed's grandson
and one of the sect's most revered saints. The occasion falls on
Monday.
   Britain's ambassador to Lebanon, Alan Ramsey said he had no
information related to the phone statement.
   The British government this month sent a high-level diplomat to
Tehran for talks. Archbishop of Canterbury Robert Runcie, the
spiritual leader of the Anglican church, met in London with a top
Iranian diplomat in an effort to gain the release of Waite and two
other British hostages in Lebanon.

   A hermaphrodite who had undergone
extensive surgery to correct his condition has been declared a male
in an unusual court ruling, a move he hopes will end a lifetime of
sexual harassment.
   ``I've always known inside that I was male, but I wanted
something tangible,'' said Scott Brenatelli, 28, who spent one
month as a policewoman and was once sent to a female prison.
   Circuit Judge Nath Doughtie issued the ruling Tuesday, based on
medical evidence and testimony.
   According to records, Brenatelli was born with hermaphroditism,
a condition in which a person has both male and female reproductive
organs.
   He said he was taunted as a child and tormented as an adult
because of his birth defect. Because his gender was incorrectly
listed as female on his birth certificate, Brenatelli spent much of
his life as Linda Schaefer, an unpopular and unruly girl who
dressed in boy's clothing.
   ``Now maybe I can finally get my birth certificate and my life
straightened out,'' said Brenatelli, who has served prison time for
convictions of insurance fraud, grand theft and failing to appear
in court. He was released from prison in May and has lived near
Gainesville since then.
   Bernatelli was hired as a police officer in Cocoa in 1980 under
the name Linda Schaefer. He was fired a month later and sued the
department, claiming he was dismissed because officials learned he
was taking male hormones and planning to have corrective surgery.
   Police officials said he was fired because they learned he had
been arrested in Orlando on charges involving the improper transfer
of a car title. The lawsuit was settled out of court in 1983 for
$1,500.
   After several operations to correct his defect, Brenatelli
married as a male. The couple paid another man $2,500 to impregnate
the wife, and she bore a son, according to court records.
   Brenatelli said he hopes the court ruling will help him gain
joint custody of his son and correct past news accounts that refer
to him as a transsexual.
   He is now suing the Orange County Sheriff's Office in Orlando
for allegedly sending him to a female prison after his 1987
convictions. He was later transferred to Lawtey Correctional
Institution for men.

<TEXT>
   Comedian Jay Leno says he has rejected
offers to become the host of late-night comedy talk shows on
television because he doesn't want to compete with Johnny Carson.
   Carson's network, NBC, recently made Leno the official vacation
replacement for Carson on ``The Tonight Show.''
   The comedian, appearing here this week, acknowledged his debt
and loyalty to NBC and ``The Tonight Show.'' ``It's kind of like
your first girl,'' he said. ``You usually remember that.''
   Mindful of Joan Rivers' ill-fated defection to the Fox Network
after years as Carson's backup, Leno said, ``I've already been
offered shows on other networks, and I've turned them down. I don't
want to go up against Johnny.''
   But he wouldn't mind sitting behind Carson's desk permanently
someday.
   ``Sure, I'd take the job if it were offered to me, but Johnny
isn't going anywhere. He likes doing it, and his ratings are
high,'' Leno said.

<DATELINE>JASTRZEBIE, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Work stoppages today crippled four
coal mines in southwestern Poland and spread in the key Baltic port
of Szczecin, where bus workers joined longshoremen on strike,
opposition activists said.
   The protests, which began Tuesday with an occupation strike at a
major mine in Jastrzebie, were called to demand pay raises and
legalization of the banned Solidarity trade union movement.
   More than 2,000 workers at the Andaluzja coal mine went on
strike today, Solidarity leaders said. The mine is about 40 miles
from three other coal mines closed by strikes. Its director, Henryk
Pyka, confirmed a strike had begun.
   Solidarity leaders said about 600 bus workers in Szczecin also
launched a sympathy strike today, paralyzing public transportation
in the city. Solidarity spokesman Wojciech Maziarski said about
1,000 dock workers were on strike there in the second day of a
stoppage.
   Workers at the Moszczenica mine near Jastrzebie refused to pick
up their tools late Wednesday, declaring support for other striking
miners, said Adam Kowalczyk, a Solidarity leader.
   Kowalczyk said about 700 workers were occupying the mine, which
employs about 11,000 workers and is one of the nation's largest. He
said workers put up a huge Solidarity banner over the front gate
and demanded louspeakers.
   Witnesses said police moved in to seal off the area.
   The coal mine is in the rich mining region of Silesia, where
workers at the July Manifesto mining complex put down their tools
Tuesday. Witnesses and Solidarity officials said there were about
5,000 miners in the complex today.
   More than 400 miners struck for a second day at the Morcinek
coal mine 12 miles away near the Czech border.
   
   ``There is a strike mood in many parts of the country,'' said
Bogdan Lis, a Solidarity leader. ``One should expect that there
will be more strikes.''
   The strikers are demanding legalization of Solidarity, along
with improved working conditions and higher pay to offset 60
percent inflation and nationwide price increases of 40 percent.
   Communist authorities, coping with the second serious wave of
strikes this year, declared the stoppages illegal and appeared to
have cut off telephone lines to several key Solidarity spokesmen.
   The state-run PAP news agency, in a dispatch late Wednesday,
said the governing Politburo discussed general labor unrest issues
at a meeting Tuesday.
   PAP said that while the government must ``conduct constant
dialogue with workers ... strike blackmail, which is accompanied by
calls to repeat a situation of complete chaos in the life of the
country, can only deepen economic problems.''
   ``There can be no return to anarchy,'' PAP said in an apparent
reference to strikers' efforts to revive Solidarity, which was born
eight years ago this month during a nationwide strike wave.
Solidarity was declared illegal in 1982.
   Solidarity leaders said a third round of talks at the July
Manifesto mine Wednesday proved inconclusive.
   Strike leaders and management discussed the creation of an
independent union that would not be called Solidarity, but no
agreement was reached, Solidarity officials said.
   Jan Kostecki, a Solidarity leader in Szczecin, said dock workers
went on strike after a fruitless round of talks with management
there. About 7,000 people are employed in the port, Poland's second
largest after Gdansk.
   ``We support all of the demands of the July Manifesto mine
workers,'' said Andrzej Andrzejczak, head of the strike committee
at the Morcinek mine, which has about 2,300 workers.
   Police sealed off the July Manifesto mine on Tuesday after about
4,000 workers refused to pick up their tools. About 9,000 workers
are employed at the July Manifesto mine, one of Poland's largest
and a key producer of high-grade export coal. It is 280 miles
southwest of Warsaw.
   Miners leaving the July Manifesto facility early Wednesday said
the wage demands were based on hardships caused by Poland's
economic situation.
   Poland's miners are paid nearly twice the national average wage,
which in July was $106 a month at the official exchange rate. They
receive extra benefits because of the vital role they play in the
nation's economy.
   Poland is the world's fourth largest exporter of coal and its
mining operations are essential to its steel, power and
shipbuilding industries.
   Five strikes in Poland from April 25 to May 10, and brief work
stoppages or strike threats in 25 more work places, constituted the
worst labor unrest in the country since the 1981 martial-law
crackdown.
   The workers in those strikes also demanded the legalization of
Solidarity, along with wage increases.

   Two police officers accused in a spree of
robberies while off-duty were released after victims and witnesses
failed to identify them in a lineup, authorities said.
   About 14 victims and witnesses viewed the lineup, with none
picking out either officer, officials said Wednesday. All spoke to
The Detroit News and Detroit Free Press on condition of anonymity.
   During the spree, which took place late Monday and early
Tuesday, two gunmen dressed in police uniforms took part in at
least five street holdups.
   The officers were tied to the case when the patrol car they
drove Monday was reported missing while the robberies occurred
Tuesday morning. A driver's license belonging to one of the robbery
victims was found in the vehicle, officials said.
   Investigators say they are now considering other possibilities,
such as other officers committed the crimes, or Detroit police
reservists wearing officers' uniforms, or imposters using stolen or
phony uniforms.
   The two officers returned to duty Wednesday, officials said.
They will be confined to office work while the investigation
continues.
   No warrants have been issued in the case, said Wayne County
Prosecutor John O'Hair. Police Chief William Hart declined to
comment Wednesday.
   ``No one has been charged and, as far as I know, no one has been
suspended,'' said John Goldpaugh, lawyer for the Detroit Police
Officers Association.

   A design error will force workers to take
down and rebuild the center section of a partially completed $16
million bridge near downtown Minneapolis, the state Department of
Transportation has confirmed.
   The mistake will cost up to $200,000, take three to four weeks
to correct and force an overnight shutdown of interstate ramps
leading to Minnesota Highway 12, a department spokesman said.
   ``It's not that uncommon on a project this size, but correcting
it usually does not involve taking the steel down,'' said Al Pint,
state corridor manager for the I-394 project.
   The bridge will carry car pool, van and bus traffic between
I-394, downtown Minneapolis and I-94. Interstate 394, a freeway
running west from Minneapolis to Wayzata, is scheduled to be
completed in 1992. Construction began in 1984.
   A state survey crew discovered the design error Aug. 8 when it
conducted a required steel erection inspection.
   Pint said the state's design consultant, Edwards & Kelcey of
Edina, inadvertently included a rise in camber in a 30-foot section
of the bridge, which is more than a half-mile long. Bridge
specifications called for a lowered camber, or convex curve.
   Pint estimated that correcting the error could cost $100,000 to
$200,000, which the state might have to help pay because it
accepted the faulty design.

<TEXT>
   Police investigating a burglar alarm at
night shot and killed a man in his home who jumped an officer after
mistaking him for an intruder, a lawyer for the officers said.
   ``It was a tragic series of accidents,'' attorney Michael
Vincent said Wednesday. ``The preliminary indications are that this
was a case of mistaken identity by the homeowner and mistaken
identity by the police officers.''
   Leonard Bontekoe, 31, was killed Sunday night after he
apparently mistook Ypsilanti police Officer Eugene Rush for a
burglar, jumped on him and grappled for his gun, Vincent said. The
struggle prompted Officer Ted Justice to shoot in defense of his
partner.
   Vincent is representing both Justice and Rush, who were placed
on administrative leave while the shooting is investigated.
   The officers were dispatched to Bontekoe's house to investigate
a burglar alarm that went off during a thunderstorm Sunday night,
Vincent said. Rush entered the home through an open door and was
jumped by Bontekoe.
   ``He was knocked backward out of the door, while this man
grappled for the officer's gun,'' Vincent said. ``Officer Justice
fired in defense of himself and in defense of his partner.''
   It was unclear whether Rush, who was dressed in a black
raincoat, and Justice, in a yellow rain slicker, had identified
themselves as police.
   Police have said Bontekoe, who was nearsighted, wasn't wearing
his glasses when he saw a man come through his back door.
   According to normal procedures, police going into an unlocked
door during a suspected burglary wouldn't announce their presence
and would go in with guns drawn, police said.

<DATELINE>DELANO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Labor leader Cesar Chavez plans to end his
fast Sunday at an outdoor mass at the United Farm Workers union
compound in Delano, a spokeswoman announced today.
   Chavez, 61, plans to end the fast Aug. 21 at an 11 a.m. Mass at
the union's retirement village in this town about 150 miles north
of Los Angeles, union First Vice-President Delores Huerta said.
   If Chavez sustains his fast until Sunday, he will have gone 36
days without food to protest the use of certain pesticides on
California table grapes. The fast began July 17.
   Dr. Fidel Huerta, Chavez's physician, repeated fears about
Chavez's condition and said he was unsure if Chavez could sustain
the fast until Sunday, said UFW spokeswoman Lorena Parlee.
   ``Cesar's condition has deteriorated. He's increasingly
experiencing nausea, vomiting and cramping,'' Dr. Huerta said.
   Chavez has dramatically cut back his activities and hasn't
appeared in public since Aug. 11 because of his weakened condition.
   He canceled a scheduled public appearance with the Rev. Jesse
Jackson on Sunday but allowed media to briefly photograph and
observe a private meeting between the two in a small room at the
union's retirement village.
   Dr. Huerta has been urging Chavez for days to break the fast.
Chavez has lost more than 27 pounds. His body has consumed all of
his fat deposits and now is burning muscle tissue, doctors reported
over the weekend.
   ``All of his systems are being affected by the fast,'' Ms.
Parlee said.
   Dr. Huerta and two other physicians have said the hunger strike
could cause ``the possibility of irreversible damage to his
health,'' Ms. Parlee said.
   Chavez launched this fast to protest use of five pesticides on
table grapes and call attention to the union's boycott of
California table grapes.
   This is the longest fast by Chavez, who went 25 days without
food during the 1968 grape boycott to recommit himself to
non-violence. He conducted a 24-day fast in 1972 to protest
adoption of a right-to-work law in Arizona.

   A gunman critically wounded his wife and her
companion in a busy hospital clinic before fatally shooting
himself, police said.
   James Howard Jr., 49, died of the self-inflicted wound Wednesday
night in Grady Memorial Hospital's surgical emergency clinic,
police Sgt. Dean Gundlach said.
   Howard's 36-year-old wife, Marguerite Howard of College Park,
and her 29-year-old companion, Henry Ector of Atlanta, were in
critical condition today, said hospital spokeswoman Beverly Thomas.
   Two other people suffered minor wounds.
   The clinic is a long room adjacent to smaller operating rooms
and waiting areas. Police said the man, wearing the uniform of a
private security company, came to the clinic about 6:30 p.m. and
began arguing with his wife and her companion, who was awaiting
treatment of a leg problem.
   Witnesses said the man pulled a revolver and opened fire about 7
p.m.
   Mrs. Howard was shot three times, twice in the head and once in
the arm and neck, Gundlach said. Ector was struck in the forehead.
   Bonnie Collett of Alpharetta and her 9-year-old great-niece,
Julie Garner of Dawsonville, who were among a group of relatives
accompanying an accident victim, were slightly wounded by flying
fragments, said Renee Yates, Mrs. Collett's daughter.
   ``She was so upset,'' Mrs. Yates said. ``He (the gunman) was
sitting right next to my aunt. Mother said she got down under
something and hid and (a bullet) grazed one of her arms and then
grazed one of (the child's) ears.''
   ``All I can do is thank God I'm alive,'' said Avon Francis of
Decatur, who was waiting for a prescription when she heard noises
she did not immediately recognize as gunshots.

   President Mohammed Zia ul-Haq, whose
11-year rule of Pakistan was the longest in that country's 41-year
history, died in a plane crash Wednesday at 64.
   The military transport in which Zia and 29 others, including
U.S. Ambassador Arnold L. Raphel, were flying exploded shortly
after taking off from Bahawalpur, 330 miles south of Islamabad.
   Zia overthrew Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto in a bloodless
coup July 5, 1977, and stamped Islamic law on his nation, including
practices such as public floggings. Bhutto was hanged in 1979.
   Under Zia, Pakistan was a strong ally of the United States,
particularly in support of the ``mujahadeen'' against the
Soviet-backed government in neighboring Afghanistan, following the
Soviet Union's 1979 military intervention in Afghanistan.

<TEXT>
   A small earthquake rattled central Utah early
today, but there were no reports of damage or injury.
   The quake struck at 6:44 a.m. and registered 4.6 on the Richter
scale of ground motion, according to the U.S. Geological Survey's
National Earthquake Information Service at Golden, Colo. It was an
aftershock of an earlier temblor.
   Initial reports of the quake came from Price, East Carbon and
Helper. The quake's epicenter was 34 miles south of Price.
   The Carbon County sheriff's office said it received numerous
calls, and the Emery County sheriff's office also received a few
calls from residents asking about the earthquake.
   The central Utah area was hit by three quakes on Sunday, the
largest of which was 5.6 on the Richter scale. The temblors caused
minor damage and were followed by about a dozen aftershocks on
Monday.
   Seismologists had said aftershocks could continue through
mid-week.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude. Thus a reading of 4.5 reflects an earthquake 10 times
stronger than one of 3.5.
   An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause slight
damage in a populated area and a 4 can cause moderate damage in the
local area.

   George Bush, savoring victory after a
10-month quest for the Republican presidential nomination, said he
was ``upbeat and ready to go'' today, preparing an acceptance
speech billed as thoughtful, quiet and personal.
   Aides said Bush has been working on tonight's speech for weeks
and was expected to sandwich some last-minute practicing into a
full day of events at the Republican National Convention.
   Press secretary Sheila Tate characterized the speech as
``thoughtful, quiet, personal.''
   During the campaign, Bush said today at a breakfast for Texas
delegates, he will spell out differences between his views and
those of Democratic rival Michael Dukakis _ ``differences I think
are so fundamental that the American people will find them hard to
believe.''
   ``But that's only half the equation, putting his record in
shape,'' Bush said. ``The other half is spelling out with clarity
what I want to do as president of the United States.
   ``And yes I've been a loyal vice president but now the gears
shift tonight and I'm going to be the nominee of this party for
president and I'm going to set the agenda.''
   He told the cheering delegates, ``I'm upbeat and ready to go.''
   Bush had been expected to appear at the breakfast with his new
running mate, Sen. Dan Quayle of Indiana, but he said Quayle was
elsewhere in the hotel, working on his own acceptance speech.
   Bush also planned to attend a rally for his wife, Barbara, and
then a $1,000-per-plate luncheon at the Convention Center expected
to raise $4 million for the Republican National Committee.
   The vice president watched the tally that handed him the
nomination on television in his hotel suite with Barbara and other
family members, including six of his 10 grandchildren.
   ``It is a special moment. The conclusion was foregone, but it's
special,'' Bush told reporters as his oldest son, George W. Bush, a
Texas delegate, announced the vote that clinched the nomination.
   All five of Bush's adult children are delegates to the
convention and Wednesday night's session _ looking at times like a
Bush family production _ included a seconding speech in Spanish
from his Mexican-born daughter-in-law, Columba.
   Asked about his acceptance speech, Bush said, ``All ready. Feel
comfortable about it. Ready to go.''
   It will be Bush's first appearance before the convention,
although he spent about 30 minutes Wednesday morning testing the
equipment on the podium while the Superdome convention hall still
was empty.
   ``I'd like to do it without my specs,'' Bush said, claiming he
planned to remove the wire-rimmed glasses he usually wears for
speaking engagements as he reads from the TelePrompTer on the
podium.
   ``We'll do all right. I'll do OK,'' Bush said of the speech.
   Aides appeared intent on lowering expectations for what could be
the most important speech of his life.
   ``We're a little nervous about the TelePrompTer. He's not used
to it,'' said media adviser Roger Ailes.
   Added press secretary Tate: ``He says he's not William Jennings
Bryan,'' the fiery late 19th century orator and three-time
presidential candidate.
   However, she said, ``he will give a good speech. The (Michael)
Dukakis speech lacked any specifics. George Bush feels strongly
that he needs to lay out where he will lead.''
   Speechwriter Peggy Noonan, who has been working on the speech
with Bush since mid-July, said that Bush was continuing to
fine-tune the speech _ which so far has been through at least four
drafts.
   Bush aides said Wednesday that after the convention, Bush and
Quayle would set out together on a campaign trip through Indiana,
Ohio and Illinois _ the latter two states key industrial
battlegrounds in the fall election. Bush will go on alone for
campaign stops in the Pacific Northwest, followed by a mid-week
appearance with President Reagan in southern California.
   At a news conference with Quayle on Wednesday, Bush said they
were ``going to tell the truth, and it's going to seem like you've
engaged a couple of pit bulls. ... We will be telling the truth
about where we want to lead this country, spelling out my
priorities.''
   Meanwhile, the Bush campaign disclosed the complete list of 12
also-rans for the No. 2 spot on the ticket.
   They included Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas and his wife, former
Transportation Secretary Elizabeth Dole; New Hampshire Gov. John
Sununu, California Gov. George Deukmejian, South Carolina Gov.
Carroll Campbell, Gov. Jim Thompson of Illinois, Sens. John
Danforth of Missouri, Alan Simpson of Wyoming and Pete Domenici of
New Mexico, Rep. Jack Kemp of New York, and Attorney General
Richard Thornburgh.
   Bush called those 11 on Tuesday before talking with Quayle, Bush
chief of staff Craig Fuller told a group of reporters.
   The 12th person on Bush's list, Sen. Nancy Kassebaum of Kansas,
was not called because she had removed herself from contention,
Fuller said.

<TEXT>
   A writer who shared a screenplay
credit and an Oscar nomination for ``Full Metal Jacket'' has waived
his right to a preliminary hearing on charges of stealing thousands
of library books, officials said.
   In a time-saving move, Jerry Gustav Hasford, 41, of San
Clemente, Calif., agreed Wednesday to waive the hearing and was
ordered to appear for arraignment Oct. 3, Deputy District Attorney
Teresa Estrada-Mullaney said.
   He faces two counts of grand theft and a single charge of
possessing stolen property, she said. Hasford has denied the
charges.
   The prosecution contends Hasford stole more than $20,000 worth
of books from libraries in London, Los Angeles, St. Louis, San Luis
Obispo, Sacramento and Longview, Wash., Ms. Estrada-Mullaney said.
   ``Both sides agreed that because there are many witnesses from
all over the country and from England, we would only present our
evidence once,'' Ms. Estrada-Mullaney said.
   The case surfaced when campus police at California State
Polytechnic University, San Luis Obispo obtained a search warrant
in March and discovered about 10,000 books in a rented storage unit.
   The charges relate to only a portion of those 10,000 books
believed to have been taken from more than 70 libraries, Ms.
Estrada-Mullaney said.
   Hasford shared an Academy Award nomination for best screenplay
adaption for ``Full Metal Jacket'' with Michael Herr and director
Stanley Kubrick.

   Marilyn Quayle, the wife of Indiana Sen. Dan
Quayle, today defended her husband's conduct and said she gets
upset when ``people hit the low blows'' at him.
   ``Any wife would get upset when someone they love is being
attacked in a way that you feel is very unfairly,'' Mrs. Quayle
said on CBS-TV.
   Mrs. Quayle, a 38-year-old attorney and the mother of three
children, said there was nothing unusual about her husband's
decision to join the National Guard during the Vietnam War. ``He
wasn't a draft dodger,'' she said.
   She also dismissed ting weekend that her husband
and two other congressmen spent in Florida at a condominium where
lobbyist Paula Parkinson stayedalk about a golf eight years ago.
   ``Any one who know Dan Quayle knows that when he gets near a
golf course that is all he thinks about,'' she said. ``When he's
home with me, that is something else, but on a golf course, it is
golf.''
   While she expected her husband would be put under the microscope
after George Bush tapped him as his running mate on the GOP
presidential ticket, Mrs. Quayle said she doesn't like some of the
questions that have been asked.
   ``I don't have anybody.
   She later attended Indiana University's law school in
Indianapolis and worked for the state attorney general's office and
judicial disciplinary commission.
   In 1972, fellow law student William Neale introduced her to Dan
Quayle, also a law student. They were married 10 weeks later in
November 1972.
   Neale remains a close friend of the Quayles.
   ``The thing I like so much about the two of them is they haven't
lost their perspective,'' said Neale. ``They're still the kind of
people you would like to have as your neighbors.''
   After law school, the Quayles moved to Dan's hometown of
Huntington where they opened a law practice. James Tucker said
Marilyn did most of the legal work because her husband also was
working as associate publisher of the Huntington Herald-Press,
owned by his father, James C. Quayle.
   The couple's first child, Tucker, was born in 1974. Their two
other children, 12-year-old Benjamin and 9-year-old Corinne, were
born after Quayle launched his political career in 1976.
   The family now lives in McLean, Va., outside Washington. Mrs.
Quayle has suspended her legal career to rear the children just as
her mother interrupted her professional career to rear a family,
James Tucker said.
   During the Quayles' years in politics, Mrs. Quayle has been an
active campaigner for her husband. Often, she and her sons will
make a series of appearances at fairs and parades while Quayle and
his daughter campaign at other events.
   Mrs. Quayle said her family has not yet adjusted to the national
attention they are receiving.

   President P.W. Botha vowed today to
oppose black majority rule as long as he is in power and said 80
percent of white voters would support segregated residential areas
in a referendum.
   In a policy speech at the governing National Party's congress in
Natal province, Botha said he was prepared to hold a referendum
among whites to determine whether they wished to retain segregated
residential areas. He said 80 percent would vote in favor.
   ``Equally, I have reason to believe that if such a referendum is
held among the Indian and colored (mixed-race) communities, some 70
percent will favor the protection of their own residential areas,''
Botha said. ``I invite the coloreds and the Indians to prove the
opposite.''
   When Parliament reconvenes next week, it is expected to take up
three new bills relating to segregation. They would allow the first
legal multiracial areas, but at the same time strengthen
enforcement of existing apartheid laws and make it easier for
authorities to evict blacks from squatter camps and whites-only
areas.
   Parliament has chambers for whites, Indians and people of mixed
race. The leader of the mixed-race chamber, Alan Hendrickse, says
his Labor Party will oppose the new apartheid laws.
   The 26 million black majority has no representation in
Parliament.
   ``I'm not even considering to discuss the possibility of black
majority government in South Africa,'' Botha told the party
congress. ``That won't happen under my leadership.''
   He said if black leaders have suggestions for increasing their
share of power in their own communities or in regional governments,
``they should come forward with practical proposals.''
   Most black leaders say they are unwilling to have discussions
with the government on a new constitution until all blacks,
including members of banned groups, are free to choose whether they
would participate. Most say they are not interested in negotiating
reforms which will leave ultimate power in the hands of the white
minority.
   Under apartheid, South Africa's black majority has no vote in
national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and
maintain separate districts, schools and health services.

   Two masked gunmen shot and
killed a Roman Catholic workman today in a house in north Belfast,
police said, and authorities defused a parcel bomb sent to a
leading Protestant politician.
   A police spokesman said the gunmen walked into a house in
Cliftonville Road and opened fire at close range, striking the
workman in the head and chest.
   The victim's identity was not immediately released, but he was
in his 20s and lived in County Tyrone in the center of the British
province, said the spokesman, speaking on condition he was not
identified.
   No group immediately claimed responsibility.
   On Monday, two gunmen entered a grocery store on the Shankill
Road, a Protestant enclave in west Belfast, and shot and fatally
wounded its 44-year-old owner, Frederick Otley.
   The Irish Revolutionary Brigade, a group previously unheard of
in Northern Ireland, claimed responsibility for that killing.
   Elsewhere, police said a parcel bomb was delivered today to the
home of a leading Protestant politician, Ken Maginnis, in
Dungannon, 40 miles west of Belfast, but was defused by British
army bomb disposal experts.
   Maginnis, the Official Unionist Party's security spokesman,
became suspicious of the cigar-box-sized parcel and called police
instead of opening it, the spokesman said. The parcel contained an
unspecified amount of explosives, he said.
   The outlawed Irish Republican Army has been fighting to drive
the British from the predominantly Protestant province and unite it
with the overwhelmingly Catholic Irish Republic.

   _Il Messaggero of Rome (moderate): ``(Quayle) adds a touch of
youthful energy to Bush's fortunes in the Midwest ... (he is)

one, Bush, has gone for the boy ...
   ``Dan Quayle's right-wing politics seem likely to count for more
than his youth on the campaign trail. Bentsen is there to do that
for Dukakis, but that makes more sense. George Bush clearly
assesses the mood of America as still Reaganite, seeking
continuity, not movement towards the center.
   ``He feels his best hope of `making it one more for the Gipper'
is to offer more of the same, but with added youthful good looks.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   The Daily Telegraph (Conservative): ``By passing over better
known and more powerful Republican figures and choosing a young,
brash 41-year-old senator of limited experience as his election
partner, George Bush has taken a gamble.
   ``Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, Dukakis's running mate and 26 years older
than Quayle, has said drily that he looks forward to comparing
their respective records of accomplishment. Well he may ...
   ``In reality the Reagan years have been distinguished not so
much by their conservatism as by the force of new ideas. Mr. Bush
has not so far shown himself to be gifted in this respect, and it
is a main weakness. It is very hard indeed to see this weakness
being redeemed by the amiable but light-headed senator from
Indiana.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   The Financial Times (independent): ``The Midwest is going to be
decisive and Mr. Quayle is a proven local vote getter... His youth
and good looks might help close Mr. Bush's large gender gap with
women, though his opposition to abortion will not, nor will the
party platform, if it is promoted seriously.
   ``It is possible that Mr. Bush has come up with a clever choice,
but it is a gamble and one wide open to counterattack. Mr. Quayle's
public record is very thin ... and it is impossible to say with any
confidence that he is qualified to be the proverbial heartbeat away
from the presidency, let alone to sharpen the blurred image Mr.
Bush himself conveys to the public at large.''

<TEXT>
   Indiana Jones has survived a close scrape with an
archaeologist who objected to filming his next adventure inside the
Mesa Verde cliff dwellings.
   The regional office of the National Park Service has decided the
filming would have no adverse impact on the spectacular,
700-year-old mud-and-sandstone cliff city in southwestern Colorado,
regional director Lorraine Mintzmyer said Wednesday.
   That reversed the finding of the park's archaeologist, Jack
Smith.
   The ruling was sent to Colorado state historic preservation
officer Barbara Sudler, who has no power to veto the permit.
However, her objections could stall the filming pending a review by
the President's Council on Historic Preservation.
   The Park Service's action was protested by Terri Martin, Rocky
Mountain regional director of the National Parks and Conservation
Assocaition, who said: ``We didn't set aside our great national
park to be used as Hollywood stage sets.''
   The Mesa Verde ruins are seen every year by an estimated 750,000
visitors, who may walk through the dwellings of the Anasazi Indians
on guided tours.
   The Lucasfilms Ltd. movie, which would be the third in the
Indiana Jones series, deals with ``pothunters,'' people who destroy
ancient ruins in search of gold and artifacts.
   Lucasfilms spokesman Don Levy said Wednesday the company would
treat the ruin carefully. ``It's important to leave land the way we
found it, to take care to protect that land,'' he said.

Honnef, police said. One hostage was killed in the gunbattle and
the other seriously injured, police said. The two bank robbers and
their accomplice also were hurt.
   Another hostage and a policeman died Wednesday when the robbers
and their accomplice held about 25 people in a bus they
commandeered.
   The hostage drama ended this afternoon after police stopped a
speeding car carrying the two bank robbers, their accomplice and
two women hostages.
   Police spokesman Horst Fechner said officers stopped the car by
setting off exploding devices that emit a powerful flash of light,
then closed in from both sides. Hesse state radio said a special
tactical unit led the assault.
   Fechner said that in the gunfire that ensued, one of the women
hostages was killed and the other received ``life-threatening
injuries.'' He said he could not release their names.
   The spokesman said the two gunmen, Hans-Juergen Roesner, 31, and
32-year-old Dieter Degowski, were seriously injured and their
female accomplice received minor injuries. Her name was not
released.
   Fechner is the police spokesman in the city of Recklinghausen,
where a special command post had been set up to coordinate the
police strategy.
   Ambulances and medical rescue helicopters sped to Bad Honnef.
Many people stopped their cars and watched the gunbattle, leading
to massive traffic jams.
   The ordeal started when the gunmen took two hostages during a
bank robbery Tuesday morning in the northwestern town of Gladbeck
and later fled in a car provided by authorities. They escaped with
two hostages and $227,000. Police provided $162,000 of the money to
try to ensure the hostages' safety.
   The gunmen surfaced Wednesday in Bremen, 135 miles northwest of
Gladbeck. Police said they opened fire in a vegetable market and
took a third hostage. No one was injured.
   The bandits then commandeered the nearby passenger bus and drove
away with about 30 hostages. Five elderly people were freed before
the bus careened along the autobahn for several hours late
Wednesday and early today.
   Police spokesman Hermann Wahl in the city of Recklinghausen near
Gladbeck said a policeman died in a crash and two others were
injured while pursuing the gunmen.
   The armed robbers also shot to death a 15-year-old Italian boy
aboard the bus after police captured the robbers' accomplice. She
was later set free, and the bus crossed the border into the
Netherlands.
   It was not clear when the gunmen were joined by the female
accomplice. Wahl said she was shot today in the Netherlands when
two hostages tried to flee.
   The hijackers shot and wounded two of their captives about 6
a.m. today before freeing most of the hostages, Dutch police
spokesman Jan Houdel said. Their condition was not known.
   The spokesman said that after freeing all but two captives near
the Dutch border town of Oldenzaal, the gunmen, their wounded
companion and two women hostages got into a high-powered BMW sedan
and raced back into West Germany at about 8 a.m.
   ``We assume they are looking for a hospital,'' Wahl said at the
time.
   After racing through the Ruhr industrial area, the car carrying
the bandits stopped in the center of the Rhine River city of
Cologne late this morning and was immediately surrounded by
journalists.
   ``We aren't going to negotiate with police any more, because we
know that leads to nothing,'' said Degowski. ``I want to say
through the news media, that the police should back off.''
   He sat in the back seat of the dark gray BMW sedan, pointing a
pistol at a young woman hostage squeezed beside him.
   The woman, who was not identified, said she felt ``good.''
   ``I was afraid before, because I thought the police might move
in and I'd be killed,'' she said. It was not immediately known if
the young woman was the hostage later killed.
   Roesner, the other gunman, sat at the steering wheel and
criticized the police. He occasionally waved his pistol at the
crowd of reporters.
   After a little more than an hour, the car sped away toward Bonn,
10 miles to the south, and into the final police roadblocks.
   Throughout the ordeal, the West German news media provided
close-up shots of the gunmen and their victims, including one of
the gunmen putting a pistol to a hostage's head.
   West Germany's ARD television network also showed footage this
morning of one of the bandits counting money.
   The television showed bullet holes in a taxicab used by
journalists as they tried to chase the bus across northwestern
German highways early today. The gunmen fired the shots from the
fleeing bus.
   ``The Hostage Drama as a Media Event,'' commented the
Frankfurter Rundschau daily newspaper under a front-page photograph
of Roesner and Degowski.

<HEAD>Jury May Be Near Verdict In Hunt Silver Trial</HEAD>

   A federal jury has indicated it could be close
to a verdict in a multimillion-dollar lawsuit accusing the Hunt
brothers of attempting to corner the silver market.
   The six-member civil jury late Wednesday notified U.S. District
Judge Morris E. Lasker that it had answered all but one of the 27
questions it had to resolve in order to reach a verdict.
   The panel began its fourth day of deliberations this morning.
   The jury indicated in a note to Lasker that it was stuck on the
question dealing with the issue of damages to be awarded.
   Because the 11-page verdict sheet requires the jury to make a
finding of some anti-trust, civil racketeering or fraud violation
before considering damages, trial observers said that seemed to
indicate the panel had voted in favor of Minpeco SA on at least one
of its allegations.
   Minpeco, a mineral marketing company owned by the Peruvian
government, is suing the Hunts for $150 million and seeking treble
damages under federal antitrust and civil racketeering statutes.
The trial began in February.
   Minpeco said Nelson Bunker Hunt, 62; William Herbert Hunt, 59,
who also has extensive real estate holdings; and Lamar Hunt, 56,
owner of the National Football League's Kansas City Chiefs,
conspired unsuccessfully with several Middle Eastern businessmen to
corner the world silver market.
   Minpeco said the Hunts bought unusually large amounts of silver
bullion in an alleged effort to manipulate world silver prices
between 1979 and 1980 in the failed attempt to corner the market.
   The Hunts denied the allegations. They said that unstable world
political conditions drove up silver prices and that they suffered
enormous losses when the silver market collapsed in March 1980.

<HEAD>Originality of Ohio GOP Cartoons Questioned</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 5th graf, `The similarities ...' to CORRECT spelling of
MacNelly.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>DAYTON, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A cartoonist hired by the Ohio Republican
Party to lampoon Democrats says any similarity between his cartoons
and those published by Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonist Jeff
MacNelly is strictly coincidental.
   But MacNelly, who draws for the Chicago Tribune, said he might
turn the matter over to an attorney.
   ``It concerns me enough that I think I'm going to call the
Tribune lawyer and have them call the Ohio Republican Party and see
what the deal is,'' MacNelly told the Dayton Daily News.
   The Daily News reported today that four cartoons drawn by Ed
Wilson for the Ohio GOP are virtually the same as the MacNelly
drawings published four years ago, except that the political
figures have been changed. In two others, the artwork is strikingly
similar but the subject matter is different, the newspaper said.
   The similarities were found by Daily News staff artist Randy
Palmer, who saw some of Wilson's cartoons last weekend and compared
them with panels he saw in a book of MacNelly's cartoons, the
newspaper said.
   Wilson, who is in New Orleans for the Republican National
Convention, expressed disbelief when told of the similarities and
said they are coincidental.
   ``Oh, I don't think that's (plagiarism) the case,'' Wilson told
the Daily News. ``Why would I do that?''
   MacNelly has not seen Wilson's cartoons, but they were described
to him by an editor of the Tribune who received copies of the
drawings from the Daily News.
   One of MacNelly's cartoons shows President Jimmy Carter standing
in a trash can while he speaks at a lectern. An adviser is saying,
``No. No. No. Stand ON your record, not IN it. Now you've got it
all over your suit.''
   Wilson's cartoon features Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis,
the Democratic presidential nominee, also standing in a trash can
behind a lectern. A voice from the auditorium is saying, ``No. No.
No. Stand ON your record. Not IN it.''
   MacNelly's cartoons are syndicated by the Tribune Syndicate Co.
and were published in his 1984 book ``Directions.''
   Wilson, who also worked for Ohio GOP in the late 1970s, said he
has seen MacNelly's work but not the cartoons in the book.
   ``I didn't even know he (MacNelly) had a book out, to be honest
with you,'' Wilson said.
   Wilson, 41, who has been drawing cartoons for 10 years and was
hired by the Ohio GOP six weeks ago, has drawn about 30 cartoons
for the Republicans. The cartoons have been attached to press
releases and, on at least two occasions, handed out to the public.

<HEAD>Dukakis In Miami To Address Greeks; Chides `Desperate' Republicans</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis today congratulated George Bush for
winning the Republican presidential nomination but then quickly
criticized his fall rival as a leading player in the Reagan
administration's ``non-existent'' war on drugs.
   The Democratic presidential nominee refused to answer directly
when asked whether he thought Indiana Sen. Dan Quayle, Bush's
running mate, should have served in Vietnam instead of joining the
National Guard.
   ``For them as for us this has been a long marathon,'' Dukakis
said in congratulating Bush and his wife, Barbara. ``Now we have
the official nominees of both parties. The fat is in the fire; the
campaign lies ahead.''
   Dukakis then said that he was eager to debate Bush and that one
of the topics should be the federal government's anti-drug efforts.
   He criticized a White House order reportedly issued Wednesday
that told federal agencies not to cooperate with a congressional
investigation into why suspicions that Panama's Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega was involved in drug trafficking were not passed on to
Congress and other federal agencies.
   Dukakis accused the Reagan administration of ``stonewalling''
the investigation.
   ``I think the White House does not want to cooperate ... because
they are embarrassed by this. They should be embarrassed by this,''
Dukakis said.
   He promised tough drug-law enforcement and drug education in
early elementary school grades and said Reagan's anti-drug effort
has failed because there is no drug czar directly accountable to
the president and that an administration committee set up to
coordinate anti-drug programs has done little constructive work.
   ``The vice president is on the committee. He doesn't show up at
meetings,'' Dukakis said. ``This war against drugs is
non-existent.''
   Dukakis has indirectly criticized the 41-year-old Quayle by
listing the accomplishments of his running mate, Texas Sen. Lloyd
Bentsen. But Dukakis chose his words carefully today when asked at
a morning news conference about reports Quayle may have used family
influence to get into the National Guard.
   ``I can only speak for myself,'' Dukakis said. ``I served my
country. I did so proudly.'' Dukakis was an Army private in Korea.
   Dukakis told a friendly audience of Greek-Americans that, if
elected, he would ``restore pride and competence and respect for
the law.
   He attributed GOP convention attacks on him to a ``pretty
desperate Republican Party.''
   ``I don't think the American people are interested in this kind
of thing,'' the Massachusetts governor said. ``I think they want a
president who is going to be strong and optimistic and confident
about this country. That's the kind of person I am.''
   Then, as he did earlier Wednesday in Minnesota, Dukakis touted
the 18-year Senate experience of his running mate, Texas Sen. Lloyd
Bentsen, and implied Quayle was not ready to be the nation's No. 2
leader.
   ``Nobody has questioned whether Lloyd Bentsen is qualified for
the job or ready to step into the presidency if that became
necessary,'' Dukakis said.
   He used that tack repeatedly to promote Bentsen over Quayle
while Dukakis aides were more direct in characterizing Quayle as
too inexperienced for the vice presidency.
   Today, Dukakis delivered his standard stump speech to a
convention of Greek-Americans, invoking the ancient Athenian oath
of public service he frequently adds to his speeches and promising
if elected to strengthen NATO and work for peace in Cypress.
   Dukakis, as he often does before Greek-American audiences,
devoted a significant portion of his speech to the issue of
government ethics.
   ``Respect for the law is the most basic, the most conservative
and the most important principle of our democratic society,''
Dukakis said. ``And it's why I want to restore pride and competence
and respect for the law to the highest office in the land.''
   Dukakis was heading from Miami to Alabama, where he was to tour
the Marshall Space Center in Huntsville and then a Baptist church
in Birmingham. It is unusual for the nominee of one party to
campaign during the other party's convention, but Bush broke
tradition by campaigning during the final two days of the
Democratic convention.

   When Randy Callison objected to
seeing police officers driving around in his confiscated Corvette,
an officer said the department was just keeping it in condition.
   ``I`m really steamed about it,'' said Callison, 33. ``Nobody's
told me anything at all, but they're out driving my vehicle around
... hot-rodding it.''
   The city's point is that it isn't Callison's car anywmore.
``Hopefully, within three or four months, we'll have title and
we'll sell it at a public auction,'' Medira Beach City Manager Paul
Williams said.
   Callison said Tuesday was the second time he saw his car on the
streets since his arrest July 24 on a drug charge. He thought it
was sitting in an impound lot.
   Chief R.R. Menard, Lt. Matthew McShane and a detective have been
taking turns driving the car to and from work to keep it in
condition, McShane said.
   ``In this particular case, the point I have to emphasize is it's
not because it's such a toy of a car,'' McShane said. ``It's such a
specialty type of vehicle that for that car to sit up for any
length of time would be far more detrimental to it.''
   Williams said the city insured Callison's Corvette and uses it
along with two other confiscated cars.
   Police said they seized the 1984 Corvette after stopping
Callison for failing to use his turn signal and discovering trace
amounts of a white powdery substance in a film container.
   Callison is scheduled to go to court Sept. 12 on a charge of
possession of cocaine.
   The car was confiscated under the Florida Contraband Forfeiture
Act which allows seizure of cars, boats and other valuables used in
the commission of a felony. Before assuming ownership of
confiscated property, however, an agency seeking forefeiture must
prove its case in court.

   A 12-year-old girl who climbed an
electric pylon caused a blackout for more than an hour in one of
Brazil's largest cities, police said today.
   The blackout Tuesday night hit the entire metropolitan area of
Porto Alegre, a city of 1.1 million people 960 miles southwest of
Rio de Janeiro, police Inspector Laureci Nunes said by telephone.
   Nunes said Jenicia Henrique da Silva, 12, was running away from
a group of boys who threatened to rape her when she climbed a
high-tension pylon near her house in Cachoeirinha, an industrial
suburb of Porto Alegre.
   The girl climbed to the top of the 130-foot-tall tower and hung
on to one of the wires carrying 230,000 volts, Nunes said.
   ``She grabbed the negative wire. If she had closed the circuit
she would have caused incalculable damage and turned into a
cinder,'' he said.
   The government electric company ordered power shut off while
firemen persuaded her to climb down, Nunes said.
   The blackout lasted from 7 p.m. until nearly 8:30 p.m. and
caused tremendous confusion throught greater Porto Alegre, the
police inspector said.
   ``People were trapped in elevators, traffic was tied up,
hospitals were operating on one-third power, and steel mills
suffered fantastic losses,'' he said. Nunes said it was the third
time the girl had climbed an electric pylon and that she was sent
to a juvenile hall.

   Sen. Dan Quayle, scheduled to become the
Republican vice presidential nominee tonight, is discovering that
he has a tough task persuading his party of his worthiness for the
job.
   Praised by George Bush as one of the party's ``rising young
stars,'' the youthful Indiana senator exulted in the spotlight
Wednesday but ran into some long shadows cast by questions about
his experience, wealth, military record and a 1980
sex-and-influence scandal.
   Today, Quayle was to have accompanied Bush to talk to Texas
delegates, but Bush told the group his running mate was ``upstairs
working on his speech.''
   Quayle will deliver his prime-time acceptance speech after his
name is put into nomination by Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas, war hero
and onetime Bush primary opponent, campaign sources said. The rules
were changed earlier this week to dispense with a roll call on the
vice presidential nomination and approve the choice with a voice
vote.
   Bush put in a pitch for the Indiana senator. ``Texans will like
this man. He is going to be a great vice president.''
   While some delegates said they were thrilled with the choice of
the conservative senator as Bush's running mate, others wondered
what Quayle brings to the ticket and whether he had skeletons in
his closet.
   ``We don't know much about Dan Quayle. ... He's a very
attractive and up-and-coming young star. They just brought him
along faster than people thought,'' said Rhode Island delegate
William B. Anderson of Barrington.
   At a joint news conference Wednesday with Bush and in media
interviews later, Quayle got a sampling of what concerns he will
have to address.
   He denied suggestions he had a sexual relationship with
Washington lobbyist Paula Parkinson in 1980: ``There's nothing to
it,'' he said. However, he declined to give a detailed accounting
of the episode, in which Mrs. Parkinson said she shared a vacation
home with several lawmakers, including Quayle. He did say he has
not seen her since the golfing vacation.
   Later Wednesday, during a combative interview on Cable News
Network, Quayle said a questioner was ``trying to create something
that doesn't exist, as if something was wrong.'' Asked to elaborate
on his activities that weekend, Quayle replied,``I went down and I
played golf and I came home and anybody that knows me, that's
exactly what I did.''
   A ``cheap shot'' is how Quayle characterized questions about his
decision to join the National Guard after graduating from college,
avoiding the possibility of being drafted and sent to Vietnam.
   ``I have a deep affection for those men and women that have
sacrificed their lives in Vietnam. ... To imply anything
differently is just simply wrong,'' he said.
   He later told ABC that he chose the National Guard because it
allowed him to fulfill his military obligation and still go to law
school, adding that if his unit had been called for service in
Vietnam, ``I would have gone and served very proudly.''
   Quayle, who comes from a wealthy publishing family, said reports
that he was worth $200 million were ``not correct.'' But he did not
elaborate, saying only that he would release tax returns that will
show ``it's far less.'
   As for suggestions that he lacks experience for the job, Quayle
told reporters, ``I know perhaps as much about national security as
anybody, with few exceptions.''
   He said his experience on the Senate Armed Services Committee
and in national security matters ``gives me a very important
background ... about what needs to be done to preserve the freedoms
and the opportunities in this country. I feel prepared.''
   A baby-boomer who has demonstrated appeal among Indiana's
blue-collar workers, marginal Democrats and women voters, Quayle is
seen by Bush strategists as the spark that can help ignite the
ticket and bridge the so-called gender gap.
   Bush aides praise Quayle's campaigning skills, painting him as
an exuberant, vigorous politician reminiscent of John F. Kennedy.
After the convention, Bush and Quayle will set out on a joint
campaign trip through Indiana, Ohio and Illinois _ the latter two
states key industrial battlegrounds in the fall election.
   But before that trip, Quayle must sell himself to many delegates
skeptical about his youth and experience. Aides say much of his
acceptance speech may well be extemporaneous comments praising
Bush, attacking Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis and stressing
his own experience on national security and defense issues.
   California Gov. George Deukmejian called the choice of Quayle
bold and imaginative at Quayle's appearance Wednesday before that
state's delegation. Afterward, Deukmejian said:
   ``I think we have to see him out there speaking to many groups,
answering questions, meeting with the media. So I don't think today
you can draw any conclusions'' on whether Quayle will help Bush in
California, an important campaign battleground.

   Security forces today killed three
people and wounded at least nine when they opened fire on Moslem
crowds who defied a curfew imposed after the death of Pakistan's
president, officials said.
   Army troops also patrolled the streets of three Indian border
towns to control Moslem violence caused by the death of Mohammed
Zia ul-Haq, who led Pakistan _ India's main adversary _ for 11
years.
   Moslems are a minority in mostly Hindu India. Pakistan is a
Moslem-dominated state where Zia had declared the superiority of
Islamic law.
   The two nations have fought three wars since both gained
independence from Britain in 1947. Nevertheless, India's government
declared three days of mourning as a show of respect for Zia.
   At a special meeting in New Delhi, Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi
and his Cabinet observed a minute's silence in memory of Zia, who
died in a fiery plane crash Wednesday in eastern Pakistan.
   In Srinagar, the summer capital of Jammu and Kashmir state,
authorities imposed an indefinite curfew when Moslem crowds tried
to set fire to two bridges after Zia's death was announced
Wednesday night.
   Police were ordered to shoot at violators.
   A pro-Pakistani crowd defied the curfew and tried to set fire to
Hindu shops, said District Commissioner Shafi Pandit, a senior
civil administrator in the state. Police fatally shot three people
and wounded nine, he said.
   Troops also were sent to the nearby towns of Baramulla and
Anantnag after rampaging crowds tried to set fire to Hindu homes,
shops and temples, Pandit said.
   Police and unruly mobs also battled in the city of Tankipora,
and several were reported injured, according to news reports.
   Security forces in many towns in Gujarat, another state along
the India-Pakistan border, also were placed on alert.
   In New Delhi, the federal capital, police stepped up security in
Moslem-dominated Old Delhi and around embassies. Riots between the
Moslems and Hindus often break out in the congested lanes in Old
Delhi that surround Jama Masjid, Asia's largest mosque.

<HEAD>Negotiator Urges U.S. Moves On Sea-Launched Missiles</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union's chief arms negotiator today
accused the United States of refusing to discuss ways to monitor
long-range, sea-launched cruise missiles, a main issue at strategic
arms talks.
   The envoy, Alexei Obukhov, said ``necessary prerequisites'' have
been reached for completing a draft treaty halving both sides'
strategic nuclear arsenals, but he again linked progress to limits
on the sea-launched missiles.
   A U.S. official termed the Soviet proposals ``quite
unrealistic'' and Obukhov's account misleading. ``Neither side has
come up with adequate procedures for verifying this class of
weapons,'' said the official.
   He spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Both sides still disagree over U.S. plans for a space-based
missile defense system in the latest round in the strategic arms
limitation talks, which began July 12, Obukhov told reporters.
   Washington wants to keep the sea-launched missiles outside the
strategic arms treaty limits, saying it is too hard to guard
against cheating.
   But Obukhov said the verification issue is ``quite solvable''
and added, ``This channel for continuation of the race in strategic
offensive arms must also be reliably blocked.''
   He said the Soviets have proposed several ways to monitor the
missiles, including inspections of ships and production sites.
   ``We wait for the American side to participate in a businesslike
discussion of these proposals,'' he said. ``As of now, we still
haven't had this discussion because of the unwillingness of the
American side.
   ``Tempo is important. We shouldn't lose the high pace of the
talks,'' he said. ``Simply declaring one's readiness to work
constructively is not enough.''
   Obukhov reiterated the Soviet position that a new commitment by
both sides to the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty must be part
of a strategic arms treaty.
   Moscow says the planned U.S. space-based missile defense, the
Strategic Defense Initiative, violates the ABM treaty. The Reagan
Administration has a more lenient view of the initiative, popularly
known as ``Star Wars.''
   Obukhov said Soviet officials will emphasize Moscow's rejection
of that ``broad'' ABM interpretation when the two sides meet for a
regular review of the pact in Geneva starting on Wednesday.
   The superpower arms negotiations began in March 1985. Both sides
agree that the strategic arms treaty should reduce each country's
long-range nuclear arsenal by half over seven years.

   Michigan's Amish don't have to mark their
horse-drawn buggies with triangular orange slow-moving vehicle
signs, which they say violate their religious rights, the state
Court of Appeals has ruled.
   Overturning traffic tickets issued to three men, the three-judge
panel ruled unanimously Wednesday that ``the state has failed to
come forward with proof in court of a compelling state interest''
to override the men's right to exercise their freedom of religion.
   David Dreyer, attorney for the Amish, said some of his clients
felt they might have to leave the state if the court ruled against
them.
   ``They take it very seriously,'' Dreyer said.
   The defendants are members of the Old Order Amish _ estimated by
Dreyer at 100 to 200 families in Michigan.
   Jerry M. Swartzentruber, Henry E. Troyer and Amos P. Gingerick
were ticketed in October 1980 for failure to display a slow-moving
vehicle emblem on their buggies. The reflectorized orange triangle
is required on any vehicle going slower than 25 mph.
   One defendant testified in district court that the Amish
attempted to lead a plain, humble way of life. He said that
requiring the emblem would mean they were trusting in the symbols
of man rather than in the protection of God.
   The appeals court said prosecutors offered no proof that the
warning signs improved public safety and said they didn't refute an
Amish proposal to use reflectorized tape and red lanterns as an
alternative.
   ``In future cases if the state does nothing more than rely on
the statute in the face of the proposed alternative, traffic
citations may not be enforced,'' the appeals court said.
   Paul Pemberton, city attorney for Beaverton who prosecuted one
of the cases, said he may seek a rehearing, seek permission to
appeal to the Supreme Court or continue to issue citations against
Amish not carrying the warning sign.
   ``In all likelihood that's what will happen, because the
citizens of the county deserve protection,'' he said. ``We have
zero enforcement tool left. This is a public safety issue, as far
as we're concerned. This is not a question of a fundamental
religious tenet.''

   Air force teams today recovered the
bodies of President Mohammed Zia ul-Haq and the U.S. ambassador as
investigators searched for clues to what caused Zia's military
plane to explode.
   Businesses were closed today across the country as a three-day
period of mourning began, and soldiers were posted at government
buildings under a state of emergency declared by the head of a
caretaker government, Ghulam Ishaq Khan.
   Air force investigators flew to the scene today as unofficial
reports and rumors circulated that Zia's American-made C-130 was
sabotaged or shot down.
   The remains of the plane lay strewn across a sandy plain near
the Indian border in Punjab province. The plane exploded Wednesday
after taking off from a nearby airport.
   Soldiers slid the flag-draped coffins of Zia, U.S. Ambassador
Arnold Raphel and 28 others onto planes bound for Islamabad and
other Pakistani cities where relatives of the victims were waiting.
   The government had originally put the death toll at 37.
   Most of the wreckage lay in a 100-yard radius. A wing lying
about 1,000 yards away was the only piece not charred and mangled
when the turpo-prop aircraft fell to the ground shortly after
takeoff from Bahawalpur airport.
   Ishaq Khan said he could not rule out sabotage but was awaiting
for a probe to be completed.
   A Pakistani air force crash investigation team flew to the scene
today in search of the plane's flight recorder. A similar U.S. team
was also expected, but no details were disclosed.
   Unofficial reports and rumors circulated that the C-130 was hit
by an anti-aircraft missile or a helicopter or was shot down by
India.
   The United News of India news agency today quoted a ``highly
placed Pakistani military official'' as saying a sophisticated time
bomb may have caused the explosion.
   It quoted the official, who was not identified by name, as
saying the pilot did not radio any message to the control tower. He
said the pilot probably would have had time to radio if the plane
had been attacked by a missile.
   Heavy security surrounded the crash site which was covered with
weeds and stagnant pools. The site is about eight miles northwest
of the airport and 330 miles south of Islamabad.
   An army brigadier who identified himself only as Zaidi said some
witnesses reported seeing the plane explode shortly after takeoff,
but others said it was only smoking when it lost altitude and
crashed.
   ``If it burst in the air it would be spread over a large area
but it is all in one area,'' he said. But he said the far-flung
wing was ``a puzzle to investigators.''
   Businesses were shuttered in official mourning for Zia. It was
not immediately clear what civil rights were curtailed by the state
of emergency.
   A funeral for Zia, a close U.S. ally, was set for Saturday. The
U.S. Embassy said Secretary of State George P. Shultz would attend.
   The people killed aboard the plane included U.S. defense adviser
Brig. Gen. Herbert M. Wassom and five top Pakistani generals. The
group had been inspecting a military unit near Bahawalpur.
   The Indian border states of Jammu and Kashmir were placed under
curfews today after pro-Pakistanis tried to set two bridges ablaze.
Indian news reports said three people were killed and nine wounded
by security forces when a crowd defied the curfew.
   Pakistan was created from Moslem-dominated areas of
predominantly Hindu India when the subcontinent became independent
of Britain in 1947. The two countries have fought three wars.
   A U.S. official in Washington, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the United States will help Pakistan investigate
the crash. ``There is no confirmation of any foul play, but we are
not taking anything for granted,'' the U.S. official said. ``An
incident like this arouses suspicion.''
   Zia allowed his country to be used as a staging ground for
U.S.-backed guerrillas fighting Soviet and government troops in
neighboring Afghanistan. Since the Soviet troop withdrawal began
there May 15, the Kremlin has accused Pakistan of continuing to
funnel arms to the insurgents.
   ``The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR sent to the
interim president of that country ... our deepest condolences,''
Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov announced at a news
briefing.
   Afghan Foreign Minister Abdul Wakil also expressed condolences
but declined to speculate whether it could affect Islamabad's
policy.
   Rajiv Gandhi, India's prime minister, said he was ``deeply
shocked and distressed'' by the death of Zia and sent condolences
to the president's family. The Indian government declared three
days of mourning for Zia.
   Zia, 64, ruled Pakistan for 11 years, longest of anyone in the
nation's 41-year history.
   Ishaq Khan pledged to continue Zia's foreign policy of close
ties with the United States and with fellow Moslem nations. He said
he would proceed with Zia's vision of an Islamic society under a
Moslem code of law.
   There were no reports of major unrest.

   Thousands of people rallied today in
Burma's two largest cities to demand an end to authoritarian rule,
diplomats said, and the government prepared to choose a replacement
for the nation's ousted leader.
   An Asian diplomat in the capital of Rangoon cited reports that
100,000 people, including students and Buddhist monks, marched
along the streets of Mandalay, the nation's second-largest city,
350 miles north of Rangoon. According to 1984 figures, Mandalay is
a city of 600,000 people.
   A Western diplomat in Rangoon said at least 1,000 protesters
were present at the start of a demonstration in front of Rangoon
General Hospital. It was the third straight day of demonstrations
in Burma's capital.
   Japan's Kyodo News Service, reporting from Rangoon, later put
the number of Rangoon protesters at 15,000. It also said thousands
rallied in Mandalay.
   Security forces made no attempt to interfere with the peaceful
protests in both cities, said the diplomats, speaking on condition
of anonymity. Kyodo said soldiers armed with bazookas were seen in
parts of Rangoon, along with tanks and armored personnel carriers.
   Meanwhile, accusations mounted that Rangoon's security forces
shot unarmed civilians last week during massive anti-government
riots. Estimates of those killed range from 95 to more than 3,000.
Security forces allegedly shot doctors and nurses outside the
hospital during the rioting, which ended the 17-day rule of
hard-line President Sein Lwin.
   Sein Lwin resigned last Friday as state president and chairman
of the Burma Socialist Program Party after five days of massive
protests. He had replaced Ne Win, who resigned last month after 26
years of authoritarian rule.
   Diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, cited reports
that the party's central committee of the Burma Socialist Program
Party has been meeting daily since Sein Lwin's ouster to prepare
for an emergency party session Friday, presumably to choose a new
chairman.
   The legislature also is to hold an emergency session the same
day, presumably to name a new president.
   The state-run Radio Rangoon said 52 people arrested in last
week's rioting were freed today, including 43 students. According
to official reports, 155 people had been released in Rangoon since
Tuesday.
   Several prominent figures arrested July 29-30 still are being
held. They include the country's leading dissident, Aung Gyi. Sein
Win, the Burmese correspondent of The Associated Press, also
remains in custody.
   U.S. State Department officials and a number of Rangoon
diplomats say they can at best estimate the number of dead
nationwide as ``in the hundreds'' given the limited movement of
diplomats last week in Rangoon and elsewhere.
   Dozens of tourists and some journalists witnessed the mass
demonstrations last week in Rangoon, but they returned with vague
accounts of killings. Only one photograph of a corpse was seen in
Bangkok.
   One senior Western diplomat told newsmen that a grisly ``battle
of the bodies'' accounted in part for the lack of information about
numbers killed.
   ``When someone is killed, (the protesters) try to get it so they
can display the bodies and government tries to get it to cremate
it,'' he said.
   After demonstrations in March, diplomats learned that the bodies
of a number of young protesters gunned down by police had been
taken swiftly to a cremation ground and burned.
   Bertil Lintner, a Swedish journalist and Burma scholar, says
3,000 persons were killed in Rangoon alone, including 600 who died
at the Rangoon General Hospital. He was not in Rangoon last week,
but cited witnesses to the demonstrations he later interviewed by
telephone from Bangkok.

   Vietnam will send home 257 Thai
fishermen allegedly caught poaching in its territorial waters,
Radio Hanoi said Wednesday.
   The domestic broadcast, monitored by a Western embassy in
Bangkok, said the fishermen would be freed from Kien Giang and Minh
Hai provinces, on the southernmost tip of Vietnam facing the Gulf
of Thailand.
   Years of careless exploitation has depleted the resources in
Thai waters, and Thailand's fishing fleet, the world's largest,
often is caught poaching in the waters of neighboring countries.
   Securing the release of fishermen in communist Vietnam has been
difficult because of the strained relations between the two
countries. Thailand backs guerrillas fighting the decade-long
Vietnamese military occupation of Cambodia.
   A Thai Foreign Ministry official, who requested anonymity, said
Vietnamese authorities repatriated 10 Thai fishermen on Aug. 12
after the Thai government paid $5,000 in fines.
   The fishermen were captured Oct. 17 following a shootout in
which two Thais were killed. The Vietnamese government reduced the
fine by half because of the two deaths, the official said.

<TEXT>
   The government is recalling all but four
commercial attaches in its 23 diplomatic missions for lack of
funds, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Thursday.
   ``Heads of missions have been instructed to recruit account
clerks locally,'' said Ernest Rusita, the ministry's permanent
secretary. The change will cut costs by eliminating the travel,
housing, education and medical expenses for the attaches and their
families.
   Rusita declined to say how much the government spends on the
current 23 commercial attaches and their 96 dependants.
   He said commercial attaches will remain in New York, London,
Rome and Nairobi because those missions generate enough revenue to
cover the costs.
   New Vision, the government-owned newspaper, said the staff
reductions stemmed from a 30 percent budget cut at Uganda's foreign
missions.
   The returning attaches will be given new jobs in Uganda.

   The world has 884 million people over the age of
15 who can't read or write, with one out of every four living in
China, according to a United Nations report.
   The communist government has made significant progress in
teaching Chinese to read, reducing illiteracy from about 80 percent
in 1949 to 20 percent of its 1 billion people today. It seeks to
teach the rest to read within five years, but there is resistance
in rural areas where many still find little use for schooling,
particularly for girls.
   Figures released in 1985 showed that more than 10 percent of the
Communist Party's then-40 million members couldn't read.
   The report of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and
Cultural Organization, was delivered at a regional meeting in the
northeast China city of Harbin.

<HEAD>Laurel's Demand for Elections Gets Little Support</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The call by Vice President Salvador
Laurel for new presidential elections has attracted little support
and is widely regarded as an attempt to revive his flagging
political fortunes.
   On Aug. 13, Laurel accused President Corazon Aquino of
incompetence and suggested both step down so an election could be
held. She has not responded, but said at the time that he did not
support her during coup attempts in 1986 and 1987.
   The vice president has met with opposition leaders, including
Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile and members of former President Ferdinand
Marcos' New Society Movement.
   Marcos was driven into exile in February 1986 by a
civilian-military uprising that Enrile, his defense minister,
helped lead. Enrile also was Mrs. Aquino's defense minister until
she fired him last November after a coup attempt involving some of
his followers.
   Enrile says Laurel has been asked to lead a united opposition.
Previous attempts at an opposition alliance have foundered over
personal rivalries.
   No major political figure has endorsed Laurel's proposal for
elections. Several politicians who had criticized Mrs. Aquino even
rallied to her defense, along with the nation's two Roman Catholic
cardinals and nearly all the press.
   Laurel's elder brother, Sen. Sotero Laurel, declared his support
for the president in a speech to the Senate.
   Some commentators speculated the vice president's announcement
indicated a secret alliance between opposition politicians and
military dissidents who sponsored several coup attempts against
Mrs. Aquino. Laurel denied it.
   Political observers said the tepid reaction measured the slide
in Laurel's political fortunes since the mid-1980s, when he was
among the best-known opponents of Marcos.
   Salvador Laurel was born into a politically illustrious family
and seemed to have a bright future in a country where family
connections carry great weight.
   His late father, Jose, was president of the Japanese puppet
government in World War II and his brother Jose Jr. was speaker of
the House of Representatives before Marcos abolished Congress in
1972 and governed by martial law.
   Critics say the vice president's impatience, poor political
timing and clear presidential ambitions have been his undoing.
   Columnist Luis Teodoro, a professor at the University of the
Philippines, wrote in The Manila Standard: `One of the reasons for
media's antagonism is the perception that Laurel is unpopular with
the public at large. No other politician ... can arouse as much
antagonism among ordinary folk.''
   Sheila Coronel wrote in her Manila Chronicle column: ``I think .
.. that Laurel deserves to be taken seriously. And it is not
because he represents the second highest office in the land. He
symbolizes something far more important: the mindlessness and
opportunism of our politics.''
   Laurel's decline began when he agreed to shelve his presidential
ambitions and become Mrs. Aquino's running mate in the February
1986 presidential election. He was under pressure from the
influential Catholic hierarchy, which feared he could not unite the
opposition.
   Both Mrs. Aquino and Marcos claimed victory in the election,
which was widely viewed as fraudulent. The Marcos-controlled
legislature declared him the winner but the uprising drove Marcos
from the country.
   Mrs. Aquino also named Laurel prime minister, but then abolished
the office. He was foreign secretary, but resigned in September,
citing a lack of influence and ``fundamental differences'' with
Mrs. Aquino.
   ``I feel like a member of a basketball team who is supposed to
be the captain, because I was supposed to be the prime minister
originally,'' Laurel said. ``But they never passed the ball to me.
They benched me and it's already the fourth quarter and I'm still
on the bench.''
   After that, Laurel made highly publicized visits to military
camps, encouraging soldiers to demand that ``communists'' be purged
from the government.
   He later claimed to have a secret intelligence report naming the
alleged communists. It turned out to be a list of public figures
the military deemed liberal or left-leaning.
   His nephew and protege, Benjamin Laurel, was defeated for
governor of the family stronghold province Batangas four months
later. Several leading members of his United Nationalist Democratic
Organization, including Senate floor leader Orlando Mercado, left
the party for pro-Aquino groups.
   The Rev. Joaquin Bernas, a Jesuit university president and
Aquino adviser, described Laurel as ``the master miscalculator'' of
Philippine politics.
   ``This misreading of the people's pulse could mean that he will
end his political career not with a bang but with a whimper,''
Bernas wrote in The Manila Chronicle.

<TEXT>
   The Israeli government
today outlawed Palestinian popular committees, saying every Arab
who continues to be a member of such committees or to assist them
will be arrested and put on trial.
   Popular committees are grass-roots groups carrying out the
directives of the Palestinian uprising's underground leaders. The
groups organize protests and patrols and supply food and medical
assistance to needy Palestinians.
   The government accused the committees of being an arm of the
outlawed Palestinian guerrilla groups and of organizing violence.
   ``The committees have a double aim: to impose by violent means
the orders of the PLO and the uprising's leaders on the population
and to undermine the Israeli authorities...and to create
alternative mechanisms instead,'' the defense ministry said in a
statement.
   The move followed deportation orders issued Wednesday against 25
Gaza Strip and West Bank Arabs, mostly members of the popular
committees, and Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin's warnings of a
crackdown on the popular committees.
   Meanwhile, Israel partially lifted a curfew in Gaza, and 17
Arabs were treated for beating injuries, bringing the number of
such cases to more than 250 in four days, Red Cross and hospital
officials said.
   Elsewhere, Israeli soldiers reportedly shot and wounded a
Palestinian teen-ager today during clashes in the West Bank with
Arabs protesting the explusion Wednesday of four Palestinians and
the deportation orders against the others.
   The European Community, meanwhile, officially protested the
deportations.
   The International Committee of the Red Cross complained that the
detention without trial of thousands of Palestinians in a harsh
desert prison violated international humanitarian agreements.
   And a London-based human rights organization, Amnesty
International, denounced the government policy of beating rioters.
   The wounded youth, Said Alshami, 19, was shot in the right leg
after Palestinians in central Nablus clashed with soldiers, said an
official at Al Ittihad hospital. Seven of the 25 Palestinians to be
deported are from Nablus.
   The army, attempting to deal with the violence, imposed curfews
on nine refugee camps and towns in the West Bank where 85,000 Arabs
live. It lifted a three-day curfew from parts of the occupied Gaza
Strip, but left the restriction in force against 180,000
Palestinians in the area.
   In half a dozen West Bank cities, Palestinian merchants
shuttered their shops to protest the deportations and the shooting
deaths of two Palestinians in a riot in Ketziot Prison this week.
   A 9-year-old Palestinian girl died today from a rock injury in
the head apparently sustained during a clash with soldiers in the
town of Jenin on Wednesday night, Arab news reports said. The army
confirmed Rasha Artawi was killed by a rock, but said it was
unclear how the injury occurred.
   The death raised to 248 the number of Palestinians killed in the
eight-month-old uprising. Four Israelis also have died.

   Franklin Delano Roosevelt Jr., who as
the third son of Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt lived by the values
synonymous with his family's name, died of lung cancer on his 74th
birthday.
   Roosevelt, a resident of nearby Millbrook, was admitted to the
hospital July 21 and died Wednesday, said Charles Gill, a Vassar
Brothers Hospital spokesman.
   ``It was a very late diagnosis and very fast-moving,'' said his
son, Christopher Roosevelt.
   Roosevelt entered politics in 1949, four years after his
father's death, defeating the Tammany Hall candidate for the 20th
Congressional District seat in Manhattan. He served three terms
before retiring in 1955.
   He failed twice to win the New York governor's office once
occupied by his father.
   ``He inherited a concern for the well-being of the community
that he used to benefit his state and nation, defending democratic
ideals with valor and serving in Congress under two presidents,''
said New York Gov. Mario Cuomo.
   When first elected to Congress, Roosevelt said his victory was
``proof that we are experiencing a revolution in American
politics'' and predicted the end of ``big-city party organizations
formerly held by irresponsible clubhouse loafers.''
   Although he held several appointed posts, Roosevelt never won
another election. In 1954, he lost the Democratic nomination for
governor to Averell Harriman and the election for attorney general
to Republican Jacob Javits.
   Roosevelt, who bore a striking resemblance to his father and
even shared the habit of throwing his head back when he laughed,
ran again for governor in 1966 on the Liberal ticket to force
Democratic bosses to open the nominating process to primary voters,
Christopher Roosevelt said.
   Roosevelt, who served in the U.S. Navy during World War II, was
awarded the Navy Cross, Legion of Merit, a Purple Heart, a Navy
commendation medal and seven campaign ribbons for meritorious
service.
   A graduate of Harvard University and the University of Virginia
Law School, Roosevelt was a close friend of John Kennedy.
Roosevelt, who campaigned for Kennedy, was Kennedy's undersecretary
of commerce and the first chairman of the Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission under President Lyndon Johnson.
   At the time of his death, Roosevelt was chairman of the
executive committee of the Mickelberry Corp. and chairman of the
board of the Park Avenue Bank in New York.
   Roosevelt is survived by his wife, Linda; brothers James and
Elliott; five children from previous marriages; and eight
grandchildren.
   The funeral will be private, according to Christopher Roosevelt.
A memorial service will be held Sept. 15 in New York.

this morning in a shootout between two groups at a drug-prone
Brooklyn housing project, police said.
   Two men in a passing car fired on two men on the street in a
section of Red Hook, said Sgt. Maurice Howard, a police spokesman.
One of the victims, whose body was found nearby, was shot in the
chest and died at Methodist Hospital.
   The other was shot in the face and was in critical condition at
Kings County Hospital.
   Later, an associate of the two people shot earlier fired into a
group of people on a corner with an M-16 automatic rifle, wounding
seven people, Howard said.
   They were all taken to hospitals. The most seriously wounded was
identified as Stacy Sutton, 21, who was in critical condition,
Howard said.
   The motive for the first shooting was unknown, but the second
was ``apparently a retaliation for the first,'' Howard said.

   A wildfire near Helena, Mont., tripled in size today, growing
into a ``wall of flame'' that destroyed at least three homes and
forced dozens of residents to flee.
   Elsewhere, firefighters in Yellowstone National Park kept an eye
on park routes, including a 14-mile stretch of roads reopened
Wednesday, when wildfires also were contained or brought under
control in Oregon, Idaho, North Dakota and Utah.
   About 1,400 firefighters from 15 states fought the raging fire
in Montana's Elkhorn Mountains, about 15 miles south of Helena. The
blaze was estimated this morning at 17,000 acres, more than three
times its 5,000 acres a day earlier. Strong, erratic winds had
fanned the flames overnight.
   No injuries were reported.
   ``We know there have been some homes lost, but we don't know how
many,'' said Jack Kendley, a fire information officer at the scene.
``Things were pretty hectic last night. We're still kind of
reeling.''
   At least three homes burned during the night, said Ed Schild of
the Lewis and Clark County sheriff's office. Firefighters managed
to save eight or nine buildings, said Art Howell, with the
Interagency Fire Dispatch Center.
   An orange glow lit the skies southeast of Helena in the predawn
hours, and smoke clouds thousands of feet high had an orange
underlining.
   ``When I saw that wall of flame, all I wanted to do was get
out,'' said Carol Williams, who was ordered to leave her McClellan
Creek home Wednesday night.
   Authorities evacuated more than 50 residents in the McClellan
Creek, Jackson and Crystal creek areas in a mountainous Helena
suburb, authorities said.
   Evacuees, issued arm tags by the Red Cross identifying them as
area residents, spent much of the night moving personal belongings,
farm equipment and vehicles to safer areas.
   A bar-restaurant at Montana City became an overnight fire
refugee center. A restaurant employee said at least a dozen cars
and pickups, loaded with chairs, beds, tables and household
belongings of area residents, were parked nearby. Some led horses
to safety.
   Red Cross spokesman Gary Yundt said evacuee stations at the east
and west edges of the fire registered about 55 residents forced
from their homes by the advancing flames.
   The fire made a ``major run'' Wednesday afternoon, burning into
more timber on the eastern slopes of the Elk Mountains, said fire
information officer Bob Krepps. The blaze was sparked Aug. 9 when a
four-wheel-drive vehicle caught fire.
   Temperatures in the 90s, low humidity and winds caused to fire
to take off, and the same weather conditions were expected again
today, Krepps said.
   Firefighters also braced for weather-related problems at fires
in drought-dried southeastern Montana.
   Ron Smith, a fire information officer at Lame Deer, Mont., said
fire crews were strengthening lines on three nearby blazes totaling
about 14,000 acres, in anticipation of a storm front today.
   ``If that front is pushing high winds ahead of it, it can be
disastrous,'' he said Wednesday night. ``It's predicted to be 100
degrees, 2 percent humidity and with high winds. All that adds up
to a real ugly situation.''
   The lightning-sparked fires on the Northern Cheyenne Indian
Reservation have been burning since the weekend.
   Yellowstone officials today monitored park routes, including a
14-mile road that was reopened Wednesday, that could be blocked by
fires and burned trees knocked down by wind.
   Officials at the northwestern Wyoming park opened all roads and
entrances Wednesday despite a 66,500-acre fire, said park
spokeswoman Amy Vanderbilt.
   One Yellowstone campground remained closed because of fire, and
one was closed to provide a support camp for firefighters battling
a 109,000-acre fire.
   The fires are among several involving more than 260,000 acres of
the nation's oldest national park.
   In neighboring Bridger-Teton National Forest, firefighters
battled a new, lightning-caused fire 2 miles west of the starting
point of a fire that burned in a massive timber blowdown in the
Teton Wilderness.
   In Wyoming's Bighorn National Forest, firefighters completed
part of a containment line Wednesday around a 3,000-acre fire, said
spokeswoman Harvalou Buchanan.
   Crews also contained a 2,650-acre fire in eastern Oregon, while
cool, damp weather eased the danger in critically dry forests in
western Oregon.
   In west-central Idaho, Nez Perce National Forest officials
offered a $5,000 reward for information about an apparent arson
responsible for a 2,175-acre fire, said spokeswoman Mary Zabinski.
The blaze was brought under control Wednesday.
   Firefighters in northern Utah controlled two fires, one 600
acres and one 70 acres, authorities said.
   Near Grassy Butte, N.D., firefighters contained a blaze that
burned 2,400 acres in the Little Missouri National Grasslands and
expected to have it under control tonight.
   The blaze, believed to be lightning-caused, also scorched five
oil wells, said U.S. Forest Service spokesman Mark Hatcher.
   Firefighters early today contained a fire believed to have been
started by lightning in the Point Pelee National Park in Point
Pelee, Ontario, just over the border in Lake Erie. An estimated
1,000 acres of marsh land and a boardwalk were damaged.

<HEAD>World Mourns Death Of Pakistani President</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Pakistan, Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Islamic nations on Thursday mourned the death of Pakistan
President Mohammed Zia ul-Haq, and world leaders called for
stability in the nation he led for 11 years.
   Western allies praised his strong support for guerrillas
fighting the Soviet-backed government in Afghanistan.
   Even India, Pakistan's longtime adversary, expressed its grief
and declared a three-day mourning period. Moslems demonstrated in
Indian states along the Pakistani border after his death was
announced, resulting in fatal clashes with security forces.
   Zia, U.S. Ambassador Arnold Raphel and 28 others were killed
Wednesday when Zia's military transport plane crashed in
southeastern Pakistan. Investigators have not determined its cause,
and caretaker President Ghulam Ishaq Khan ordered a state of
emergency.
   China, an ally of Pakistan, expressed shock over the
``tremendous loss,'' the official Xinhua News Agency reported.
Chinese Premier Li Peng and President Yang Shangkunremi said they
``sincerely hope that the Pakistan government and people ... will
remain united and maintain stability and continue to make concerted
efforts for the preservation of peace and the development of the
economy.''
   The Soviet Union also sent condolences and said it hoped for
improved relations with Pakistan. The two countries were on
opposite sides of the Afghan conflict, and both joined the United
States and Afghanistan in signing agreements in Geneva calling for
the withdrawal of more than 100,000 Soviet troops from Afghanistan.
   Afghan President Najib expressed condolences to Ishaq Khan but
did not mention Zia by name, Radio Kabul said. Najib said he hoped
the new president will end the ``violence in (the) relationship''
between the south Asian neighbors.
   Hungary, however, said Zia had obstructed peace in Afghanistan.
   The United States, one of Pakistan's strongest supporters,
reaffirmed its backing for the country. ``At this moment of extreme
trial, I want to reiterate our commitment to Pakistan and our full
support for the acting president and his government,'' said State
Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley.
   Islamic nations mourned Zia, a devout Moslem who earlier this
year put the country under Islamic law.
   Iranian President Ali Khamenei called Zia a ``competent leader
and a good friend'' and expressed confidence that ``the strong will
of the Pakistani people will fill the vacuum created by (Zia's)
death,'' according to Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency.
   Individual cables expressing ``deep grief and sorrow'' were sent
by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, Sultan Qaboos of Oman and
President Ali Khamenei of Iran.
   The United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Qatar and Kuwait also called
for official mourning periods, with flags throughout the region
lowered to half- staff. Other nations with periods of mourning
included Nepal and Bangladesh, which was created in a 1971 civil
war that split Pakistan.
   In Britain, mourners visited the home of Zia's brother, Mohammad
Inam ul-Haq, a physician who lives near Manchester. His son said
the family was ``devastated.''
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher praised Zia's support for the
Afghan guerrillas. British newspapers warned of instability in
Pakistan.
   ``It is a measure of President Zia's shrewdness as a political
operator that he started by being underestimated and ended by being
overestimated. A truer measure of his stature is that his sudden
death leaves Pakistan in a mess,'' The Independent said.

<TEXT>
   Paula Parkinson, the woman who held center
stage in the sex-and-influence scandal that briefly touched Dan
Quayle, says she never had an affair with the senator and is tired
of talking about it.
   ``She didn't sleep with Quayle,'' said society columnist Rudy
Maxa, Mrs. Parkinson's longtime confidant. He is now acting as an
informal spokesman for Mrs. Parkinson, who once worked as a Capitol
Hill lobbyist for an insurance industry group.
   Quayle, tapped by George Bush for the No. 2 spot on the
Republican ticket, was one of three congressmen who shared a
cottage with Mrs. Parkinson during a January 1980 golfing vacation
in Atlantis, Fla. Quayle has said he did not have an affair with
her.
   ``That has been covered and there is nothing to it,'' Quayle
told a news conference Wednesday at the Republican convention in
New Orleans.
   Maxa said Mrs. Parkinson ``has no particular feelings one way or
another'' about the Quayle candidacy.
   She also was pictured in a November 1980 Playboy article on the
Women of Washington wearing only a garter belt and a sash across
her midriff. She later claimed she had a videotape of herself
having sex with an unidentified member of Congress.
   In 1981, the Justice Department investigated Mrs. Parkinson's
activities but uncovered no criminal activities.
   Since the incident, Mrs. Parkinson has divorced her first
husband. She remarried several months ago and now lives in a small
town near her native Dallas, Maxa said in a telephone interview.
   He said she will not reveal her new married name or speak with
reporters.
   As for interviews, he said, `She has, for the longest time, been
tired of the press.'' But he said she might be willing to tell her
story if she is paid.

   A shooting at a location known for drug violence
led to a second shooting Thursday, and a young man was killed and
eight people were injured, police said.
   The first shooting, at the Red Hook Housing Projects in
Brooklyn, occurred about 12:23 a.m., police Officer Hugh Barry said.
   An unidentified man was approached by six men who opened fire
with semiautomatic weapons. The victim, in his 20s, was taken to
Methodist Hospital, where he was pronounced dead. A companion was
wounded.
   The site has a history of drug-related violence, Barry said.
   An hour later, two men in a car opened fire on a group of young
people standing outside, wounding seven of them, police said.
   The motive for the first shooting was unknown, but the second
was ``apparently a retaliation for the first,'' according to Barry.
   A 21-year-old woman was hospitalized in critical condition with
a gunshot wound to her right side, Barry said. The other victims
were listed in stable condition or released from hospitals, he said.

<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Even before the Republican National
Convention ended Thursday, Houston began campaigning to persuade
GOP officials to hold their next quadrennial gathering in Texas'
largest city.
   Donald Ward of the Houston Convention and Visitors Bureau was
making the rounds this week distributing red, white and blue
stickers that read ``Houston '92 Convention'' and talking with
various Republican groups.
   ``I think Houston will host one of the national political
conventions in 1992, I really do,'' said Ward, who made a similar
recruiting trip to Atlanta for last month's Democratic convention.
   Ward said Houston has one big thing going for it: No matter who
wins the November election, a Houston resident will be at the White
House.
   Republican presidential nominee George Bush calls Houston home,
even if his current address is a hotel room. And Democratic vice
presidential candidate Lloyd Bentsen's residence is a Houston
condominium.
   Surely the hometown factor gives Houston a leg up, Ward said.
   ``We are in a very unique position. Either way it goes, the
president or the vice president will be from Houston,'' he said.
   Houston made a determined pitch to win this year's Democratic
convention, although it was passed over for Atlanta by Democratic
National Committee Chairman Paul Kirk.
   Ward said the city has several advantages to offer in trying to
lure a convention.
   First, the new George R. Brown Convention Center is massive,
with 43 permanent meeting rooms and enough temporary rooms to give
each state delegation its own, he said. Both state party
conventions were held there this year, with the Democrats sending
some 10,000 delegates and alternates.
   In addition, Ward said Houston has more than enough hotel space,
so no delegate would be more than 30 minutes from the hall.

<HEAD>2 Teams Sent to Aid Pakistani Crash Investigators</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States has ordered two teams of
specialists to Pakistan to assist authorities investigating the
cause of a plane crash that killed the country's president and the
U.S. ambassador, the Pentagon said today.
   Dan Howard, the Defense Department's chief spokesman, said one
team of eight accident investigators had already left the United
States and will arrive in Pakistan on Friday.
   That team includes military and civilian experts and will help
search for the cause of Wednesday's crash.
   ``We expect them to be there for about two weeks,'' Howard said.
   The second team will include six U.S. military forensic
specialists who will assist the Pakistanis in identifying the
victims of the crash. That team is being sent from West Germany,
Howard said.
   The Pentagon spokesman said he was aware of reports speculating
that the plane crash was not an accident, but had seen nothing to
indicate sabotage or a military attack.
   ``My answer to all these questions is we just don't know,'' he
said. ``That's why we offered an investigating team. I don't think
I can offer any useful commentary on the causes of the crash until
they've conducted their investigation.''
   State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said, meanwhile,
that the declaration of a state of emergency in Pakistan had not
interfered with civil liberties and that the situation in the
country was calm.
   She praised a speech Wednesday night by Acting President Ghulam
Ishaq Khan reafirming the tenets of Pakistan's foreign policy and
``its continuing steps toward democracy'' along with a decision to
proceed with elections scheduled for mid-November.

<HEAD>Search Launched for Abominable Snowman; Mammoth Remains Found</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Zoologists are heading to Siberia to search for
the abominable snowman, while remains of a mammoth have been found
elsewhere in the frozen expanse, news reports said Thursday.
   The official news agency Tass said fishermen from the Siberian
city of Yakutsk discovered the fossilized mammoth in permafrost
near the Khroma and Indigirka rivers. Scientists said the skeleton
was well preserved because it had been frozen in the ground for at
least 15,000 years in northwestern Siberia.
   The remains soon will be taken to Yakutsk, where they will be
assembled, Tass said.
   The newspaper Socialist Industry reported that 12 scientists,
sportsmen and enthusiasts planned to search in the Tyumen region of
western Siberia for the abominable snowman.
   The expedition will follow the same route that a Leningrad
explorer used several years ago. The explorer, Vladimir Pushkaryov,
disappeared in the region while interviewing residents who tell
legends about the mysterious creature they call Kompolen, the
newspaper said.
   A group of tourists also disappeared in the area, and the
expedition will look for them as well as the abominable snowman,
the newspaper reported. It did not say when the expedition would
begin.
   The hairy behemoth said to roam the snowy expanses of Siberia
and other areas is a favorite legend among supersititious Soviets.
Tass reported in January that the Soviet Culture Ministry had set
up a Society of Cryptozoologists to search for the snowman.
   In March, a newspaper said a Mongolian adventurer claimed to
have made plaster molds of an abominable snowman's footprints and
photographed the creature sitting on a rock. The sighting was
alleged to have occurred in the Altai Mountain range of extreme
western Mongolia, just south of Siberia.

   The government asked the Soviet Union to scale down
a planned military exercise in the Sea of Japan beginning Friday,
Foreign Ministry officials said Thursday.
   The request, presented to the Soviet government by the Japanese
Embassy in Moscow on Wednesday, included shortening the duration
and reducing the size of the Soviet exercise, officials said.
   The Soviet Union earlier announced it would conduct the
artillery exercise in the Sea of Japan west of Hokkaido, Japan's
northernmost island, starting Friday and lasting until Aug. 30.
   Japan expressed fears the exercise could hurt fishermen
operating near the exercise area, especially about 500 squid
catchers.
   Moscow complied with a request from Japan on Aug. 10 to cut the
size of an earlier drill, which was also held in the Sea of Japan,
the officials said.

   The government of Congo will host the next

Angola and independence for South-West Africa, also known as
Namibia, the State Department announced Thursday.
   The talks will be held in Brazzaville starting Aug. 24, and the
U.S. team will be headed by Assistant Secretary of State for

   Representatives of Angola, South Africa, Cuba and the United

round of talks in Geneva earlier this month and will work on
timetables for the Cuban withdrawal, she said.
   South Africa has already begun to pull out of southern Angola
and has promised to relinquish its control of Namibia and grant it
independence. But Cuba and Angola still insist on a multi-year
staged withdrawal of Cuban troops while the United States wants the
pullout to last a year or less.

<HEAD>Embattled Refuge Scheduled for Designation as Shorebird Reserve</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM GARDNER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>RENO, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Stillwater National Wildlife Refuge becomes
the nation's second Western Hemisphere Shorebird Reserve this
weekend, but the honor may be a hollow one for the ailing swamp.
   ``Things are looking pretty bleak right now,'' said Norm Saake,
a waterfowl biologist for the Nevada Department of Wildlife. He
predicts that 80 percent of the marshes in the 164,000-acre refuge
will be dried up by the end of the summer.
   Racked by back-to-back drought years that have distilled the
wetlands to a suffocating, toxin-ridden stew, the refuge 60 miles
east of Reno has become a murky grave to more than 7 million fish
and 2,000 birds in the past 18 months.
   Steve Thompson, a wildlife biologist at Stillwater, estimates
the marsh areas will barely total 3,000 acres by dedication time
``if we're real lucky. We're getting down to the last ponds now.''
   After 1986, the most recent year of heavy precipitation,
Stillwater swelled to 23,628 acres of managed marshland, Thompson
said. By the following year, it had dwindled to one-third of that,
and now, after two abnormally dry years, barely 4,000 acres of
marshes remain.
   ``It's just a shadow of what it was,'' Thompson said. ``It's
been a tough year.''
   Saturday's dedication will make the refuge the fourth Western
Hemisphere Shorebird Reserve in North and South America and the
second in this country, according to Laurie Hunter of the National
Audubon Society in New York. The other U.S. site is the Delaware
Bay shoreline in New Jersey and Delaware.
   The selection was made by the Western Hemisphere Reserve
Network, a conservation group made up of government and private
agencies, including the Audubon Society.
   ``It's quite an honor,'' Thompson said. ``I think part of their
reasoning was to draw some attention to the place. It's in dire
straits.''
   Stillwater is one of the last remnants of prehistoric Lake
Lahontan, which once covered all of western Nevada. Most of the
former lake bed shriveled long ago into dry sinks that fill up only
during very wet years.
   The refuge drew wide attention in February 1987 when the
increasing salinity of its evaporating waters killed an estimated 7
million fish in the Carson Sink, one of several former lakes that
comprise the refuge. An unrelated outbreak of avian cholera killed
about 1,500 water birds.
   Since then, the lakes have shrunk to ponds, finally killing even
the most salt-tolerant fish. The water that's left in the Carson
River by the time it reaches Stillwater is also polluted by
agricultural runoff and natural elements from the soil like
arsenic, boron and mercury.
   While the fish can withstand the toxic levels during high-water
years, the concentration of chemicals, loss of oxygen and growth of
algae become intolerable as the water evaporates.
   ``It's just poor quality water that's killing these fish,''
Thompson said.
   The situation is worsening for birds as well as fish. Avian
botulism has claimed 650 birds in recent weeks, and scientists
search the refuge daily, looking for dead and dying birds to be
burned or buried in an effort to keep the disease in check.
   While scientists are concerned about the possible effects of the
toxic water and disease on this fall's migrating waterfowl, Saake
said the dying wetlands could discourage birds from making their
usual stop at Stillwater along the Pacific Flyway.
   ``We don't have enough water to keep them attracted here,'' he
said.
   For migrating birds, Stillwater is a ``critical stepping stone''
in the 6,000-mile route between Arctic breeding grounds and
wintering areas in the southern United States and Central and South
America, Ms. Hunter said.
   ``Because it is one of the most important inland staging areas
for migrating birds in North America, Stillwater has worldwide
ecological value,'' she said.
   Efforts to win more water for the refuge, chiefly by acquiring
Carson River water rights, are pending in Congress. One measure
calling for a federal Environmental Protection Agency study to
determine whether treated sewage could be routed to Stillwater has
passed and is on President Reagan's desk.
   Another measure, still in hearings, would shift $1.2 million
earmarked for flood control work to buying farmers' water rights
for the sanctuary.
   Sen. Chic Hecht, R-Nev., calls both of his proposals ``a start
on the long road back'' for Stillwater.
   Between Hecht's work in Washington and efforts by private
environmental and wildlife groups, Saake said, Stillwater's current
peril and Saturday's dedication as a shorebird reserve may provide
the attention that could save it.
   ``There's finally light at the end of the tunnel, just because
it's so bad,'' he said.

   Republican vice presidential candidate Dan
Quayle questioned a former Indiana National Guard commander about
the service and whether the Guard would be called to active duty in
the Vietnam War, the Indianapolis News reported today.
   Retired Maj. Gen. Wendell C. Phillippi _ who was managing editor
of The News and worked for Quayle's grandfather, Eugene C. Pulliam
_ told the newspaper that the Indiana senator questioned him about
aspects of the guard.
   Phillippi said he does not recall details of conversations that
took place surrounding Quayle's enlistment in the Guard _ a move
some observers have criticized as an attempt to avoid combat in
Vietnam.
   ``I imagine I was talking to Danny one day,'' Phillippi said.
``He was a newspaperman, you know. We got to conventions together.
I'd known him and his parents and his wife's parents for many, many
years.''
   ``He wondered if it was subject to call,'' Phillippi said in a
telephone interview with the newspaper.
   Phillippi, who retired from The News in 1984, said he called on
his ``multitude'' of friends within the guard when Quayle applied
in 1969 _ even though he had relinquished his command five years
earlier.
   Later, when personnel from the adjutant general's office sought
his advice, Phillippi suggested that Quayle should be given
consideration.
   ``I was asked about Dan Quayle's abilities and capabilities, and
I recommended him very highly for acceptance in the National Guard
after I left the National Guard _ as I did with many other men,''
Phillippi told the newspaper. ``That's about all I know about it.''
   Phillippi said he never talked to Pulliam about his grandson's
military service, but the topic did arise in conversations with
Eugene S. Pulliam, the son of Eugene C. Pulliam and Quayle's uncle.
The younger Pulliam was then assistant publisher of The News and
The Star; he now serves as publisher of The News and The Star.
   ``Lord, I talked with Gene every day,'' Phillippi said. ``We
discussed many people (interested in guard duty). If anyone was
interested, they were sent to me. Obviously, we were interested in
recruiting the best people _ and (Quayle) was one of them.''
   Eugene S. Pulliam said he does not remember any such
conversation.
   ``Well, I don't have any recollection at all of talking to
Wendell about that,'' Pulliam said. ``I know he was very active in
the guard ... but I have no recollection of mentioning Danny or
anybody else.''
   Jeff Nesbit, Quayle's press secretary, said today that ``phone
calls may have been made'' on behalf of the senator. Top aides in
George Bush's campaign said they were still looking into the
controversy.
   Quayle will be nominated tonight as Bush's running mate.
   Two ex-adjutants general disagreed on whether Quayle would have
even needed any help in getting into the National Guard.
   John S. Anderson, a Democrat and adjutant general immediately
before Quayle joined the guard, said there was a waiting list for
guard service. John N. Owens, a Republican who assumed the position
in January 1969, said there was room for anyone who wanted to join.
   Quayle, born on Feb. 4, 1947, drew number 210 for the year 1970
draft. The ceiling for the draft that year was 215, Col. Billie
Holmes, deputy director of the Indiana Selective Service told The
News on June 15, 1970.

   Playboy founder Hugh Hefner, 62, who had a
palimony suit slapped on him earlier this year, intends to have
January Playmate of the Month Kimberley Conrad sign a prenuptial
agreement before the two head for the altar.
   The couple announced their engagement in July and are expected
to wed next year. Hefner has been single since his first marriage
ended in divorce in 1952.
   Robyn Radomski, spokeswoman for Playboy Enterprises Inc.,
wouldn't divulge details of the agreement, but said Ms. Conrad, 26,
``won't get control (of the company) in the event of a divorce of
if anything happens to Hef.''
   Employees and shareholders apparently expressed concern after
Hefner's former lover, Carrie Leigh, filed a palimony lawsuit,
which she later dropped.
   Hefner's daughter, Christie, runs Chicago-based Playboy as
president and vice chairwoman. Although Ms. Hefner has been praised
for improving operations at the publishing and entertainment
company, Playboy on Wednesday announced a $5.1 million loss in the
fourth quarter.

   The secret to a good marriage, says actor Jeff
Bridges, is to not have sex _ with his co-stars, that is.
   ``Kissing all those pretty girls up on the screen has got to be
tough on (my wife), though she says it's not so bad,'' said
Bridges, who has worked with Jessica Lange, Rachel Ward, Kim
Basinger and Karen Allen among others.
   ``I really like to get as close as I can to the people I'm
working with,'' the actor said in an interview in the Sept. 5 issue
of US magazine. ``I like to even get intimate with my co-stars, but
not sexually.''
   Bridges, 38, who is starring in ``Tucker: The Man and His
Dream'' about maverick automaker Preston Tucker, has been married
11 years to photographer Susan Geston.

   A Willie Nelson concert to benefit the
depositors of a failed bank has been rescheduled for another stage
after a university president canceled the original show.
   Plans for the singer to perform at Baylor University were
scrapped after University President Herbert Reynolds, citing
``concern for the health and well-being of the American people,''
canceled the program Tuesday.
   Although Reynolds didn't elaborate, Eugene Baker, a spokesman
for the Southern Baptist university, said the cancellation
concerned the country star's personal behavior. Although Baker
wouldn't go into detail either, Nelson has been married three
times, sports shoulder-length hair and an earring and drinks on
stage.
   Promoter Tom Gresham said Wednesday from Austin that Nelson
authorized him to proceed with plans for a Nov. 14 concert at the
Heart O' Texas Coliseum to benefit the depositors of the failed
Leroy Bank, a private bank northeast of Waco.

   Before he took up residence at ``Frank's
Place,'' actor Tim Reid was ready to live as a hermit in Nevada.
   ``I had bought 200 acres of land near Tahoe and severed all my
other relationships _ and there had been many _ and figured I would
just club a woman and drag her off to the mountains for a
weekend,'' Reid said in an interview in Sunday's Parade magazine.
   But after meeting Daphne Maxwell, Reid said he decided to forgo
the cloistered existence. She went on to become his second wife and
co-star in the series.
   His new focus is to bring his view of black life to television.
``It's not enough anymore for a black to be able to play parts
written for whites,'' Reid said. ``Too often, I've seen talented
blacks gain some power only to lose it because they are afraid they
won't be hired again if they write their kind of stories.''

   The Philharmonic canceled a planned visit to Athens at the last

   A teen-ager who sought revenge on two
roommates who stiffed him for the rent is facing a possible prison
term for his scheme of revenge.
   Michael Gist went on a spree of overseas dialing that he figured
his roommates would have to pay for. The call he will pay for,
perhaps with a prison term, is a bomb threat to the U.S. Embassy in
Beirut, Lebanon.
   Michael Gist, 18, originally of Canoga Park, Calif., pleaded
guilty Wednesday in U.S. District Court in Minneapolis to one count
of making harassing telephone calls, a misdemeanor. Magistrate
Floyd Boline ordered a presentence investigation and released Gist
on a $5,000 unsecured bond.
   The telephone harassment charge is punishable by up to six
months in prison and a $50,000 fine. However, under a plea bargain
with the U.S. Attorney's office, Gist would serve a maximum
sentence of three months if Boline approves.
   Gist moved to Minnesota from California in July, according to
Assistant U.S. Attorney Richard Vosepka.
   During Wednesday's court appearance, Gist told Boline that he
was angry with his friends for moving out without paying the rent
on their apartment in the Twin Cities suburb of Fridley.
   Since the apartment telephone was still in the other roommates'
names, Gist said he and his girlfriend decided to spend the night
of Aug. 5 making overseas calls.
   In his call to the U.S. Embassy in Beirut, Gist spoke with the
embassy switchboard operator. Gist said he asked to speak with
someone ``higher up,'' but was told no one else was available
because it was 4:10 a.m. in Beirut. Gist said he then told the
operator that a bomb would go off at the embassy at noon.
   ``Then he asked me what my name was,'' he said. Gist hung up.
   The long-distance operator came back on the line to ask the
embassy if the call had been completed and the switchoard operator
described the call as a bomb threat, Vosepka said.
   The operator immediately gave Gist's telephone number to the
embassy, which notified the State Department in Washington. The
State Department called the FBI, which had agents staking out
Gist's apartment in about an hour, Vosepka said. FBI agents
arrested Gist the following evening.

<HEAD>Getty Museum Decides Marble Head of Achilles is Fake</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A marble head of Achilles that was once
regarded as one of the J. Paul Getty Museum's significant
antiquities has been determined to be a fake, a museum spokeswoman
said.
   The marble head had been dated 350-340 B.C. and was believed to
have been created by the Greek sculptor and architect Skopas as a
temple decoration depicting a Trojan War scene at Tegea.
   ``Following extensive research by our staff and outside
scholars, we have concluded that the head is not a Greek original
of the 4th century B.C.,'' said Lori Starr, the museum's
spokeswoman.
   Ms. Starr said the head was removed from display last September
``when there was sufficient doubt to warrant a thorough
investigation.''
   In 1986 the museum's handbook described the head as ``one of the
few orignial Greek sculptures in Western European or American
collections that can be placed within the context of a specific
monument.''
   Ms. Starr would not reveal details of the investigation pending
a settlement with the anonymous dealer who sold the head to the
museum in 1979.
   The Getty has also removed from its galleries a marble stele, or
stone slab, identified as an archaic Attic grave relief. Ms. Starr
said the museum has been reconsidering the piece for several years.
   The museum will publish a report on both items when research on
the stele is complete, Ms. Starr said.
   Achilles was the mythological hero slain by an arrow to his
heel. Attica is the peninsula of Greece where Athens was built.

Indiana guard official, campaign official's comment</NOTE>

   George Bush today polished a speech to accept
the Republican presidential nomination as campaign aides tried to
defuse a controversy about whether newly picked running mate Dan
Quayle had used influence to get into the National Guard during the
Vietnam war.
   Brushing aside the issue, Bush declared at a fund-raising
luncheon, with Quayle at his side, ``I don't think I could have
selected anybody that'll do more to help the election than Dan
Quayle of Indiana. He is going to be outstanding on this ticket.''
   Quayle told the enthusiastic crowd, ``I'm darn proud to have
George Bush as our presidential nominee. I can't wait to get out
there. ... I can't wait to take this campaign to the American
people.''
   Neither mentioned the controversy.
   Bush campaign chief James A. Baker III said his staff was
``continuing to explore'' the issue with Quayle. Marilyn Quayle
said her husband, who was 22 at the time, ``wasn't a draft dodger.''
   Jeff Nesbit, Quayle's press secretary, said it was the
``collective recollection'' of Quayle and his father, newspaper
publisher James Quayle, ``that phone calls may have been made on
his behalf.''
   A retired executive of the Pulliam family newspaper empire,
Retired Maj. Gen. Wendell C. Phillippi, who worked for Quayle's
grandfather, said he had contacted a ``multitude'' of guard
acquaintances on behalf of Quayle, The Indianapolis News reported
today.
   Bush campaign spokeswoman Alixe Glen said, ``Not a single
thought is being given'' to dropping Quayle from the ticket.
   Tonight, Bush goes before the Republican National Convention
with a 20-minute speech that he calls the most important one he's
ever given. Senate Republican leader Bob Dole, himself a war hero,
was to nominate Quayle, a conservative, 41-year-old senator as
Bush's running mate.
   ``I'm upbeat and ready to go,'' Bush told cheering Texas
delegates at a breakfast gathering on the final day of the
Republican National Convention.
   ``I've been a loyal vice president, but now the gears shift
tonight, and I'm going to be the nominee of this party for
president and I'm going to set the agenda,'' he said.
   Recently revived in the polls, Bush still faces the challenge of
defining his vision of the nation's future and dealing with voters'
remaining questions about his ability to lead and what he stands
for.
   Less than 24 hours after Bush picked Quayle, questions were
raised about his service in the guard.
   Quayle told NBC-TV that in 1969 he had ``let a number of people
know I wanted to get into the National Guard,'' and added, ``If
phone calls were made, I can't answer, I don't know the specifics
of that.''
   Bush campaign chief Baker, appearing on ABC-TV today, said
Quayle ``basically said, `Look, I really wanted to serve in the
guard. I was anxious to do that. ... I wanted to go to law school,
I was anxious to do that, and if some people helped me, they helped
me.''
   Added Baker: ``I think, frankly, he's talking about help from
his family, which really wasn't particularly unusual, given the
circumstances of the time, given the attitude, if you will, of many
baby boomers at the time, toward that situation.''
   Bush pollster Robert Teeter said Quayle, during the search for a
running mate, had said no one helped him get into the guard.
   John Owens, adjutant general of the Indiana National Guard from
January 1969 until August 1972, said Indiana ``had vacancies
galore'' in its guard units during his years. However, John S.
Anderson, adjutant general immediately before Owens, told the
Indianapolis News there was a waiting list for Guard service.
   Reacting to the news, Rep. Tom Tauke, R-Iowa, said, ``If they
pulled strings to get him out of going (to Vietnam), he's got a
problem. It happened 20 years ago, but it is still a problem.''
However, Senate Minority Leader Alan Simpson of Wyoming said,
``It's a bunch of crap. There's about 10 million people in the
National Guard who should be offended by all of this.''
   Amid the final day convention celebrations, Bush attended a
rally for his wife, Barbara, before going to a $1,000-a-plate
luncheon expected to raise $4 million for the Republican National
Committee.
   Introducing his wife earlier, Bush said strategists had told him
he had to be more dynamic. ``So here we go, the introduction, with
feeling, with demonstrable emotion, the next first lady of the
United States,'' Bush said.
   Acting like a television game show host, he called out, ``Come
on up, sweetie pie. Come on up.'' The audience laughed and
applauded.
   Meanwhile, there was encouraging news for him in a new public
opinion poll. Several polls after last month's Democratic National
Convention gave Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis
leads of 17 points or so, but recent surveys have suggested the gap
has narrowed to next to nothing.
   The latest, published today by The Washington Post, showed a
Dukakis lead of 49 percent to 46 percent _ within the poll's
3-point margin of potential sampling error. The survey was
conducted from Aug. 11 through Tuesday, the day Bush named Quayle,
among 1,119 likely voters nationwide.
   Bush swept uncontested to the GOP presidential nomination
Wednesday night in a balloon-filled celebration that ran past
midnight. Before it was over, thousands of people had already left
the Louisiana Superdome.
   For Bush, it was a family affair. All five of his now-adult
children were delegates to the convention, and his Mexican-born
daughter-in-law, Columba, delivered the final seconding speech for
his nomination in Spanish.
   By design, Bush's oldest son, George W. Bush, delivered the 111
votes of the Texas delegation that put the state's ``favorite son
and the world's best father'' over the 1,139 delegates needed for
nomination.
   From a hotel suite nearby, Bush watched the proceedings on
television, surrounded by grandchildren and other relatives.
   ``It is a special moment,'' he said. ``The conclusion was
foregone, but it's special.'' All of his children and his 10
grandchildren will be on stage with Bush tonight to share in his
moment of triumph.
   The convention's first order of business will be to ratify
Quayle as the vice presidential nominee and applaud his acceptance
speech.

   A George Bush victory in November would
likely pit Bush loyalists against Reagan administration
officeholders in a mad scramble for government jobs, Republican
Party analysts say.
   While the competition for such high-ranking jobs wouldn't be
nearly as publicized as the scramble for the No. 2 spot on Bush's
ticket, the jockeying would be fierce.
   The face of the Cabinet would change, as it does with any new
administration, but the most grisly competition would involve
sub-Cabinet-level jobs, like assistant secretaries and agency heads.
   Even before Bush came to this city to claim the presidential
nomination, two longtime vice presidential associates _ former
Pennsylvania Gov. Richard Thornburgh and Wall Street investment
banker Nicholas F. Brady _ were put in the Cabinet, although Brady
is still awaiting confirmation.
   The Bush influence also was seen in President Reagan's
nomination of Texas Tech University President Lauro F. Cavazos as
secretary of education, since the vice president had promised a
month earlier that he would put a Hispanic in the Cabinet.
   Both Reagan and Bush scoffed at suggestions the president was
helping the vice president get off to a quick start on Cabinet
formation. But it is not expected that Thornburgh, Brady and
Cavazos would be asked to relinquish their jobs in a Bush
administration.
   Ed Mahe, a veteran Republican Party consultant and activist,
said Cabinet changes are automatic when administrations change,
even if the incumbent party wins.
   But he said the real battle lines will be drawn in the
sub-Cabinet positions such as deputy secretary agency chairman and
so forth.
   Mahe said that, for the most part, it is ``standard operating
procedure'' for such senior political appointees to offer their
resignations _ and then let the president decide whether they
remain.
   In Bush's case, he said, ``I would expect for him to have that
opportunity to start from scratch. He has every right to expect
them to submit them (resignations) and even demand it.''
   Mahe said the most intense competition will likely be between
longtime Bush loyalists and conservative Reagan administration
figures who started government services in lesser jobs but moved to
key top-level posts during the course of Reagan's two terms.
   ``So I think there will be intense jockeying by Bush-type people
trying to get in, and Reagan-type conservatives trying to stay
in,'' he said.
   Former Attorney General William French Smith, a longtime Reagan
friend who is attending the convention as a delegate from
California, said, ``There is always jockeying for jobs, and there's
not always rationality to it. It's a strange process.''
   ``It turns not just on the connection with the candidate, it may
turn on something entirely different,'' such as the Senate
confirmation process, he said.
   Alan ``Punch'' Green, a convention delegate from Portland, Ore.,
said he expected that ``there would be major changes in the Cabinet
to match the Bush personality.''
   ``You see it now in Nick Brady at Treasury and Dick Thornburgh
at Justice, and you'll see it in Jim Baker'' going to the State
Department, he said.

   The United States can afford a national
day care program if ``fantasy'' programs like President Reagan's
Star Wars defense plan are cut, the wife of Democratic Presidential
candidate Michael Dukakis said Thursday.
   Kitty Dukakis said the question is whether to pay for ``exotic
weapons programs that have little chance of working, or do we
provide the best for our children, whether it's in day care or
education?''
   ``Our country is the only industrialized nation in the world
without comprehensive child care policies,'' Mrs. Dukakis said.
   Mrs. Dukakis spoke to reporters following her visit to the day
care center at St. Ambrose University, where she sang songs and
chatted with 12 youngsters aged 2 to 5 years.
   Mrs. Dukakis said her husband will create a national day care
partnership program ``representing labor and industry, business and
education, family and government.''
   ``He will establish a new office of child care which will have
the job of assuring that quality, affordable, acceptable child care
will be available for all who need it,'' she said.
   Asked how Dukakis would pay for the program, Mrs. Dukakis said
``I think you have to make tough choices, and Michael has talked
about that; whether we have a fantasy called Star Wars or we
provide decent, affordable day care.''
   In an interview with The Associated Press, Mrs. Dukakis said she
does not intend to wield much influence over her husband's conduct
of the presidency, should he win it.
   ``He doesn't need me coaching him. We share a great deal, we
will continue doing that,'' she said. ``I understand he is the
ultimate decision-maker, he is the elected officer and I'm
comfortable with that.''
   Mrs. Dukakis said her other interests as first lady, if her
husband defeats Republican George Bush in November, will be the
arts, a national beautification and preservation program, the
homeless and a national substance abuse program.
   ``I agree with Mrs. Reagan that we have to say no to drugs, but
we have to (increase) funding for these other parts of her
program,'' Mrs. Dukakis said.
   Mrs. Dukakis said the record of Sen. Dan Quayle, R-Ind., Bush's
vice presidential choice, is suspect.
   ``I think women of this country are going to vote on the issues,
on records, character ... Mr. Quayle, as senator, voted against
Head Start, voted against the Farm Credit Bill and the drought
relief bill.
   ``In terms of family issues, when you are against (the) Equal
Rights Amendment and against money for Head Start, then you have
problems,'' she said.
   She said Republican attacks on her husband's record as governor
of Massachusetts as a free-spending liberal who would raise taxes
to support new programs fail to point out his real accomplishments.
   ``My husband has cut taxes five times,'' Mrs. Dukakis said.
``They don't talk about that.
   But ``No credible candidate can ever say he wouldn't raise
taxes, especially with the deficit situation,'' she said.

<TEXT>
   A security guard convicted of raping
and killing a woman will get a new trial because of insufficient
evidence that the rape occurred while the victim was alive, a state
appeals court has decided.
   In a ruling filed this week, the 4th District Court of Appeal
said the 1979 bludgeoning and strangling of 22-year-old Savannah
Anderson was ``a most heinous murder.'' But it reversed the
conviction of Robert Lloyd Sellars, saying that jurors in his 1986
trial were not instructed properly on the law regarding rape.
   ``Unfortunately, the failure to properly instruct on rape
tainted the first-degree murder verdict as well,'' Presiding
Justice Harmon Scoville wrote in the opinion.
   County Deputy District Attorney Richard King said Wednesday that
he will challenge the ruling in higher courts and take Sellars to
trial a second time if necessary.
   ``We are shocked and we are confused,'' King said. ``We feel
this decision was clearly erroneous as a matter of law.''
   Attorney Jennifer Keller, who represented Sellars, said she
believes the justices acted properly in overturning the conviction
because the rape allegation was not supported by the evidence.
   Sellars, who worked at the Irvine apartment complex where Ms.
Anderson lived, was arrested in 1984, five years after she was
killed.
   An Orange County Superior Court jury found Sellars guilty of
first-degree murder along with a special-circumstance allegation _
that the offense was committed during the commission of a rape.
Sellars was sentenced to life in prison without possibility of
parole.

<HEAD>Small Quake Felt In Central Utah</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRICE, Utah (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A small earthquake, an aftershock of a series
of quakes on Sunday, was felt Thursday in central Utah, but there
were no reports of damage or injury.
   The magnitude of the 6:44 a.m. quake was 4.6 on the Richter
scale, said Jim Pechmann, a seismologist at the University of
Utah's Seismograph Stations.
   A second tremor, 1.0 magnitude, was recorded in the same area at
6:56 a.m., the university said.
   The Carbon County sheriff's office said it received numerous
calls, and there were reports of the temblor being felt in Emery
and Sanpete counties.
   On Sunday, central Utah and western Colorado were rocked by
three quakes, the largest of which was about 5.6 on the Richter
scale of ground motion and caused some minor damage. About a dozen
aftershocks followed Monday.
   The tremors occurred in an area where there had been no known
faults.
   The epicenter of Thursday's temblor was believed to be in
approximately the same area as Sunday's, about 34 miles south of
Price and 14 miles east of Ferron, Pechmann said.
   It was an aftershock of Sunday's quakes, he said. Seismologists
had said aftershocks could continue through mid-week.
   ``An aftershock of this size is not considered unusual given the
size of last Sunday's main shock,'' Pechmann said.
   Every increase of one number on the Richter scale means a
tenfold increase in magnitude.
   An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause slight
damage in the local area, 4 moderate damage, 5 considerable damage,
6 severe damage. A 7 reading is a ``major'' earthquake, capable of
widespread heavy damage; 8 is a ``great'' quake, capable of
tremendous damage.

<HEAD>Challenger Accident Led To `Clam-Up' In NASA, Spokesman Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Many in NASA responded to the Challenger
shuttle accident with a ``massive clam-up'' that led to a feeling
of mistrust by the news media toward the space agency, a spokesman
said Thursday.
   James McCulla, director of media services for the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration, said in a speech that
following the Jan. 28, 1986 Challenger explosion, there were orders
from agency administrators that no one was to talk to the media
about the possible causes of the accident.
   ``This caused some of our NASA people to desert their usual
openness with the press,'' said McCulla. ``You had a massive
clam-up, like never before. Our reputation with the mass media was
hurt.''
   He said there were stories alleging that NASA was attempting to
cover up the causes of the Challenger accident and there arose a
feeling of mistrust toward NASA.
   Before the accident, he said, NASA enjoyed the reputation of a
``Mission Impossible'' organization, an agency that could tackle
the difficult assignments and accomplish success because it had
``the best and the brightest'' engineers and leadership.
   But after Challenger exploded and killed seven crew members, the
agency came under close scrutiny of the press, a presidential
commission and Congress, and ``you could see how the image (of
excellence) disintingrated,'' McCulla said.
   Some scientists and engineers in the agency were confused by the
media spotlight and resented the criticism, he said. Some of the
technical leaders were proud of the job NASA had done in the Apollo
lunar program and the agency's other accomplishments, he said, and
``they couldn't understand why it (NASA) was being torn down and
raked over the coals'' after the accident.
   With NASA now in the final stages of preparation for returning
the shuttle fleet to flight, McCulla said the era of what he called
``NASA bashing'' news stories is over.
   ``The stories now look toward the future,'' he said.
   McCulla said the space agency has not abandoned its plans to fly
ordinary citizens in space. One of the seven who died aboard
Challenger was Christa McAuliffe, a Concord, N.H. school teacher
who had been selected as the first to fly in the citizen-in-space
program.
   NASA public relations leaders ``fought hard'' for that program,
McCulla said, and there still are plans to fly a teacher in the
future, but not until there is ``total confidence'' restored in the
space shuttle.
   ``After we've got that sort of confidence, the teacher will go
for a ride,'' he said. ``How far down the road that will be, I
don't know.''

   Twenty-five wide-eyed kids from Georgia,
beneficiaries of a man who took an airline promotion very, very
seriously, began a four-day Southern California fling Thursday with
a backstage look at Hollywood.
   Clark Howard, a retired travel agent, flew 26,338 miles on 68
flights in 48 days in a marathon-on-wings to earn the free ride
West in an Eastern Airlines promotion.
   The 30-member entourage, 25 youngsters and five chaperones that
included Howard, arrived at Los Angeles International Airport at
11:08 a.m. It was the first plane ride ever for many of the
youngsters, ages to 9 to 15.
   ``At first I was nervous, but after the plane settled down it
didn't feel like it was moving. It felt like it was just sitting
there,'' Marcus Williams, 12, said inside the airport terminal.
   ``I want to see all of the beaches and the ladies and Disneyland
and Hollywood and the mansions and Beverly Hills,'' said Donald
Cunningham, 11.
   First stop on the tour was Universal Studios, where Frankenstein
and Woody Woodpecker are the official greeters at the VIP entrance.
   ``We are giving them a very special day here at the tour,'' said
Universal spokesman Jim Yeager, adding that the tour includes
backstage views of movie making and the Miami Vice, Star Trek, King
Kong and Conan the Barbarian action shows.
   From there, a caravan through Hollywood and Beverly Hills and a
swim at Venice Beach round out their first day West. None of the
youngsters had ever seen the ocean.
   A day-long tour of Disneyland on Friday, a trip to the San Diego
Zoo on Saturday and a visit to Manhattan Beach on Sunday completes
the excursion. They leave for home Sunday afternoon.
   Eastern offered 60 free tickets to anyone making at least 60
flights totaling more than 25,000 miles in 60 days as part of its
60th anniversary celebration, said Paula Musto at the airline's
Miami headquarters.
   ``We sort of forgot about it. We didn't think anybody would take
us up on it,'' she said. The 30 round trip tickets would have cost
about $9,000, she said.
   The children, wearing ``Partners Against Drugs'' T-shirts, were
selected on the basis of their participation in the ``Just Say No''
anti-drug program.
   The entourage included 12 youngsters from Big Brothers-Big
Sisters of Metro Atlanta and 13 children from the Super program
sponsored by the Boys Clubs of Metro Atlanta and the Metro Atlanta
Council on Alcohol and Drugs.
   ``This trip may not change their entire lives,'' said Judy
Weisberg of the Big Brothers program. ``But if it makes them feel
good about themselves, it's worth every penny.''
   Howard, 33, said he decided to earn the free tickets as soon as
he heard of the promotion because he wanted children to use them.
   ``I want the kids to have a good time,'' he said. ``but what I
think is much more important than that is that I want the kids to
have a much greater feel for what this country is and what's out
there for them.''
   Howard describes himself as ``mostly retired,'' although he does
work as a consultant for a publishing house and as host of a travel
show on WGST radio in Atlanta.
   ``I can't think of an air travel deal that occurred that I
didn't do over the years,'' he said.
   The most intense period of travel for Howard on this particular
odyssey was eight flights a day between Atlanta and Columbia, S.C.,
or Charlotte, N.C., for four consecutive days.
   WGST will pay for the children's hotel rooms in California, but
Howard paid the $2,110 for the 68 flights he took between May 6 and
June 25 out of his own pocket. He chose most of them for their low
pricetags.
   Flight attendants who served Howard going one way would do a
double take when they saw him on a return flight a few moments
later.
   ``They don't know whether you're a company inspector, a spy from
a competitor or a drug courier,'' Howard said.

   An intentionally flawed space shuttle
booster rocket was successfully fired today in the last of a series
of tests for Morton Thiokol's redesigned booster before resumption
of manned U.S. space flights.
   The two-minute horizontal test firing, the fifth full-scale test
of the booster, sent clouds of dust billowing thousands of feet in
the air as hundreds of NASA and company observers cheered.
   ``Fantastic! It looked really good. This is it,'' said John
Thirkill, vice president of space operations for Morton Thiokol.
   If engineers deemed the test a success after inspecting the
prone rocket, and National Aeronautics and Space Administration
workers can plug a tiny fuel leak in Discovery, NASA officials will
be able to set a firm date in late September or early October for
the first shuttle launch in 32 months.
   Kennedy Space Center workers today planned to clamp a
4-inch-long clamshell-like device over the gas leak and fill it
under pressure with a sealing compound while Discovery remained on
the launch pad.
   To reach the leak, workers used a routing tool Wednesday to cut
two holes in the rear wall of Discovery's 60-foot-long cargo bay
and two more in the adjoining hull of the steering engine
compartment.
   The holes, separated by structural supports, enable a technician
to put both hands into the compartment.
   The tiny leak of nitrogen tetroxide gas was 12 inches from the
newly drilled access panels, on a fitting in a vent line. The leak
was detected more than a month ago and has been stopped by putting
pressure on the line. However, it must be plugged before launch to
prevent additional leakage.
   Because Discovery is standing vertically on the launch pad, the
rear wall of the cargo bay is parallel to the ground, forcing the
technicians to work on their hands and knees or on their stomachs.
   The repair and subsequent testing are expected to take about a
week, said NASA spokeswoman Lisa Malone.
   When the leak was discovered last month, officials at first
feared they might have to move Discovery to a hangar for repairs,
which could have delayed the launch as much as two months. But
engineers came up with the innovative idea for making the fix on
the pad.
   The repair was delayed until the launch team conducted a
successful test firing last week of Discovery's three main engines,
powered by liquid fuel. The leak is in a separate engine system
used to steer the shuttle in orbit.
   Scores of improvements have been made to Thiokol's 126-foot-long
booster, but the main emphasis has been on reworking the field
joints that hold together the rocket's cylindrical segments.
   The Challenger explosion was blamed on a faulty joint that
allowed a plume of super-hot gas to burn through an O-ring seal and
ignite the main liquid fuel tank.
   For today's booster test, two of the three field joints _ the
case-to-nozzle joint and the igniter-to-case joint _ were riddled
with 11 intentional flaws to test the joints to their limits as the
rocket burned 1.1 million pounds of propellant in 120 seconds. The
unflawed joint was a control.
   Among the defects were separations in the bonded adhesive
insulation that helps hold the joints together, and channels that
would allow the fiery gas to reach the joint's middle O-ring, one
of three designed to contain heat from the burning fuel.
   The joints also are equipped with heaters to keep their
temperatures at a minimum of 75 degrees. Freezing air the night
before the doomed Challenger launch were found to have contributed
to the joint's failure.
   With the exception of the flaws, the rocket is virtually
identical to a version Morton Thiokol successfully test-fired on
June 14 and to those now attached to Discovery.

   A retired executive of the Pulliam family
newspaper company said today that he made phone calls to ease the
way of Republican vice presidential candidate Dan Quayle into the
Indiana National Guard during the Vietnam War.
   Senior aides to George Bush were ``continuing to explore'' the
controversy even as Quayle's nomination approached. Campaign
spokeswoman Alixe Glenn said, ``Not a single thought is being
given'' to dropping Quayle from the ticket.
   In 1969, Quayle was 22, no longer deferred from the draft and
vulnerable to being conscripted and sent to Vietnam. National Guard
units were rarely activated for Vietnam duty, and many men joined
the guard as a way to avoid the draft and likely Vietnam duty.
   Quayle is a member of the Pulliam family which controls a number
of newspapers including the Indianapolis News. The question of how
Quayle joined the guard arose as every aspect of Quayle's life came
under intense scrutiny on the day he is to be nominated as Bush's
running mate at the Republican National Convention.
   Retired Maj. Gen. Wendell C. Phillippi _ who was managing editor
of The News and worked for Quayle's grandfather, Eugene C. Pulliam
_ said he contacted guard acquaintances on behalf of Quayle.
   Phillippi, according to The News, said he called on his
``multitude'' of friends within the guard when Quayle applied in
1969.
   ``I was asked about Dan Quayle's abilities and capabilities, and
I recommended him very highly ... as I did with many other men,''
Phillippi told the News in a telephone interview from his home in
Brown County, Ind.
   Marilyn Quayle said her husband ``wasn't a draft dodger.''
   Quayle, a hardliner on defense matters, has said he sought guard
duty so he could attend law school. A Bush aide said the matter was
discussed with Quayle during the process that led to his selection
for the Bush ticket, and Quayle had denied that he used influence
to gain admittance to the Guard.
   Rep. Bob Dornan, co-chairman of Bush's campaign in California
said, ``it requires a Checkers-like speech (of contrition), and he
must do it _ must do it _ quickly, before this gets out of hand.''
   Well after midnight today, the Bush inner circle met to discuss
Sen. Quayle's performance on the first day of his vice presidential
candidacy _ a day dominated by questions about the Indianan's
qualifications to be a heartbeat from the presidency, and about his
military record.
   Quayle's press aide, Jeff Nesbit sought this morning to describe
the sequence of events in 1969.
   On the issue of whether telephone calls were made to try and get
Quayle in the Guard, Nesbit said the ``collective recollection'' of
Quayle and his father ``was that phone calls may have been made on
his behalf.'' He did not elaborate.
   Nesbit said the reason that Quayle stumbled at questions about
his military record was that ``his recollection of what happened
back then is a little fuzzy.''
   Robert Teeter, who oversaw the vice presidential selection
process which resulted in Quayle's selection on Tuesday, had said
Wednesday that his military service had been raised during the
interview process.
   ``The question was, I believe, was there any pull or some
influence in some way for him to get into the National Guard. My
impression is the answer is absolutely not,'' said Teeter. ``He, at
some point said, `I simply applied, like anyone else.''' said
Teeter.
   If there were calls made on Quayle's behalf, it may not have
been necessary. John Owens, adjutant general of the Indiana
National Guard from January 1969 until August 1972, said the
Indiana ``had vacancies galore'' in its guard units during his
years.
   However, John S. Anderson, adjutant general immediately before
Owens, told the Indianapolis News there was a waiting list for
Guard service.
   Quayle told NBC that in 1969 he had ``let a number of people
know I wanted to get into the National Guard,'' and added, ``If
phone calls were made, I can't answer, I don't know the specifics
of that.....''
   ``No one should be ashamed of guard service,'' Phillippi said.
``And he (Quayle) should not be called a draft dodger because he is
subject to call at any time of the day or night during his entire
enlistment.''
   Bush's campaign chairman, James Baker III, appeared on ABC-TV
today and said Quayle had ``basically said, `Look, I really wanted
to serve in the guard. I was anxious to do that. ... I wanted to go
to law school, I was anxious to do that, and if some people helped
me, they helped me.''
   Added Baker: ``I think, frankly, he's talking about help from
his family, which really wasn't particularly unusual, given the
circumstances of the time, given the attitude, if you will, of many
baby boomers at the time.''
   Baker promised there would be ``full disclosure'' of the issue.
``We are continuing to explore it with him,'' he said. Baker led
the meeting of key Bush strategists who critiqued Quayle's
Wednesday performance and discussed _ among other things _ how to
defuse the National Guard controversy.
   George W. Bush, Bush's eldest son, told reporters today that
``the thing that's important is he didn't go to Canada. ...
Remember, in 1968, Canada was an option. He didn't go. Let's keep
it in generational perspective.''
   The Indiana senator was not a nationally known figure at the
time Bush tapped him.
   On Wednesday, Quayle called the questioning of his decision to
join the guard ``a cheap shot. I have a deep affection for those
men and women who sacrificed their lives in Vietnam.'' More than
58,000 Americans were killed in the war.
   And he told CNN: ``I was willing and ready to serve my country.
I chose to serve my country in the National Guard like millions of
other people.''
   Former Gov. Edgar Whitcomb, a Republican, denied a report that
he had intervened for Quayle.
   ``No, I never heard of it,'' he said of Quayle's interest in
joining the guard. He said Quayle _ who later was a junior aide in
his office _ was not known to him at the time he was seeking a
Guard appointment.
   ``I would say for sure no one contacted me about it and I had no
letter from someone trying to get him into the National Guard,'' he
said.
   Whitcomb said the guard was ``certainly no refuge for draft
dodgers; we had units called and they served active duty in
Vietnam.'' Quayle's was not among them.

cover part of their crop losses from the drought, Deputy Secretary
Peter C. Myers announced Thursday.
   Myers said farmers in all of the state's 102 counties have eight
months in which to apply for the loans to cover part of their
actual losses.
   To be eligible, he said, they must be able to repay the FmHA
loans and any other loans, must be unable to get credit elsewhere
and must have adequate security.
   Illinois is the 13th entire state designated eligible for FmHA
emergency drought loans. Others are Alabama, Delaware, Indiana,
Iowa, Maryland, Missouri, New Jersey, North Dakota, Ohio,
Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and West Virginia.

   Every Wednesday, summer and winter, Joe
Bailey pulls down the shade on the front door and hangs a sign in
the window _ ``Gone Fishing.''
   He's gone from the store, and off the air.
   Wednesdays off have been a tradition since Bailey's Country
Store opened for business and later developed a sideline into the
longest-running radio talk show in Kentucky.
   For 41 years, the program dispensed advice, humor, announcements
and commentary, but little music, from 8:30 to 9 a.m. every day
except Sundays and Wednesdays .
   ``I play only one record. Usually, it's an oldie, something out
of the 1930s, and stuff you won't hear anywhere else,'' said
Bailey, who took over the microphone six years ago from his
brother, Bart.
   Bailey broadcasts from one corner of the store at Williamsburg.
Just a few feet away are racks of clothing, including bib overalls,
washboards and tubs, nails, lanterns and dozens of items that would
be difficult to find in big city discount houses.
   ``I can look around and see what bargains are available and tell
people about them. We don't sell groceries because we'd probably
eat up the profits,'' said Bailey, whose show has five sponsors.
   While he is on the air, Bailey may be interrupted by telephone
calls from listeners with such questions as:
   ``I want to buy a cow. You know where one's for sale?''
   ``When's the best time to make sauerkraut?''
   Other callers, interested in astrology, will telephone in
advance to ask ``if the signs are right for weaning a baby or
setting a hen to hatch.''
   Bailey also handles announcements of yard sales and church
meetings. ``I receive lots of queries about lost dogs. In fact, I
get everything you get in a newspaper's classified ads column, and
then some.''
   There is no broadcast on Sunday when the store is locked because
``that's a day of rest,'' Bailey said. ``I need it.''
   The store was started by his father, Virgil, after the former
Harlan County coal miner moved to Whitley County in 1936.
   ``Dad also came up with the idea for the radio program and used
to drive to Corbin every day to broadcast live over station WCTT.''
   When the four sons _ Joe, Bart, Ed and Bob _ took over, they
decided to have remote broadcast facilities installed at the store.
   ``My brothers have retired and I'd like to join them but
somebody's gotta work,'' said Bailey, now 39.
   The practice of closing on Wednesdays is nothing new, he said.
``It's an old mountain tradition. People who own a business often
do a little farming and that seems to be a good day for it.''
   Bailey does break the rule on the last Wednesday before
Christmas. ``We stay open as a courtesy to last-minute shoppers.''
   He describes the radio program as a community service.
   Asked why the show is so popular, he will grin and reply: ``It's
free and probably overpriced at that.''

<HEAD>Iranian Says Iran Would Retaliate If Iraq Delays on Truce Plan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Any attempt by Iraq to delay
implementation of a U.N. peace resolution would force retaliation
by Iran, President Ali Khamenei of Iran said Thursday.
   Also on Thursday, the commander of the U.N. observer force that
will monitor a cease-fire arrived in Tehran from Baghdad for talks
with Iranian officials, the official Islamic Republic News Agency
said. The truce in the 8-year-old war is set to begin Saturday
morning in the Persian Gulf.
   Another 24 U.N. truce observers arrived in Baghdad, joining
about 100 others already there.
   In another development, anti-government Mujahedeen Khalq rebels
claimed that thousands of political prisoners have been executed in
Iran in recent weeks.
   Khamenei made the statement during an inspection tour of the
southern war fronts, IRNA reported in a dispatch monitored in
Cyprus.
   The Iranian agency quoted Khamenei as saying Iran takes the
various clauses of Security Council Resolution 598 as a whole.
   IRNA quoted him as saying any attempts to delay the withdrawal
of forces to international borders, or the demarcation of borders,
or the formation of a body to determine the aggressor in the war
would ``force us to strike back at the enemy with a stronger blow.''
   Iraq agreed to the U.N. resolution shortly after it was approved
in July 1987. Iran agreed to the resolution last month, clearing
the way for a cease-fire.
   The head of the 350-man U.N. observer force, Gen. Slavko Jovic
of Yugoslavia, flew to Tehran Thursday after talks with Iraqi
officials in Baghdad, U.N. officials in the Iraqi capital said.
   The Mujahedeen Khalq, or people's holy warriors, said in a telex
from its office in Baghdad that thousands of mujahedeen political
prisoners and hundreds of ``innocent residents'' have been killed
in mass executions in the past few weeks. It gave no precise
figures.
   The group, the largest of the exile movements battling Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini's government, said the bodies of those executed
were secretly buried in mass graves.
   Official Iranian media have reported that a dozen or so
mujahedeen were publicly hanged last month, but the numbers
reported by the rebel group are much higher.
   There was no immediate Iranian comment on the claims by the
mujahedeen, which could not be independently confirmed.

   Labor leader Cesar Chavez plans to break
bread during Holy Communion on Sunday, ending what will be a 36-day
hunger strike, but his doctor doubts the United Farm Workers
president can last that long without food.
   Chavez plans to end the fast _ a protest of pesticide use on
California table grapes _ at an outdoor Mass in this town about 150
miles north of Los Angeles, First Vice President Dolores Huerta
said Thursday.
   Chavez, 61, suffered ``increasing problems with vomiting'' on
Wednesday, and his attending physician, Fidel Huerta, expressed
fear he might become dehydrated.
   ``Cesar's condition has deteriorated. He's increasingly
experiencing nausea, vomiting and cramping,'' Huerta said in a
statement.
   Chavez began the fast July 17.
   Chavez has lost 31 pounds and has been steadily weakening for
the last two weeks. He hasn't appeared in public since Aug. 11, but
allowed the media to briefly photograph a private meeting with the
Rev. Jesse Jackson on Sunday.
   Huerta and two other physicians who examined Chavez on Monday
said he runs the threat of possible irreversible damage to his
health by sustaining the hunger strike. Chavez has refused their
requests to enter the hospital.
   Chavez went 25 days without food during the 1968 grape boycott
to recommit himself to non-violence, and he conducted a 24-day fast
in 1972 to protest adoption of a right-to-work law in Arizona.

<HEAD>Gov't Hints It Will Free Jailed Black Leader Soon</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID CRARY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government Thursday gave
its strongest hint yet that it soon will free jailed black leader
Nelson Mandela, reportedly suffering from tuberculosis.
   President P.W. Botha praised Mandela's cooperative attitude and
said he hoped the 70-year-old leader of the African National
Congress would not have to go back to prison from the hospital.
   Botha said he expects ``positive results'' from his standing
offer to free Mandela if Mandela renounces violence.
   Other officials indicated the government was considering
Mandela's release more seriously than ever before.
   The South African Press Association quoted unidentified
government sources as saying the release was imminent. The sources
suggested that militant supporters of the guerrilla movement might
start a campaign aimed at questioning whether Mandela, in the event
he renounces violence, was able to think for himself.
   The congress is the major guerrilla movement fighting for
black-majority rule. Mandela has been in prison since 1962 and is
serving a life term for sabotage and conspiracy to overthrow the
government. Surveys indicate he is the most popular leader among
South Africa's blacks.
   The Mandela family had no immediate statement, and the congress
said it would comment after studying the text of Botha's speech.
   A close associate of the family, speaking on condition of
anonymity, told The Associated Press that Mandela recently
reaffirmed his confidence in the congress and gave no indication he
was prepared to accept a conditional release. The source said Mrs.
Mandela was likely to visit her husband within the next day or two
to discuss the developments.
   Wynand Malan, an anti-apartheid member of Parliament, described
Botha's remarks as ``disturbing and regrettable'' and called for
the president's ouster. Malan said Botha ``wants to strip an ill
and ageing man of his credibility with his own people before he is
allowed to go free.''
   Information Minister Stoffel van der Merwe also said Mandela had
cooperated since he was transferred Aug. 12 from Cape Town's
Pollsmoor Prison to nearby Tygerberg Hospital.
   ``He did not try to use the occasion as a propaganda stunt,'' he
said. He noted that it was not Mandela, but his lawyer and friends,
who requested outside medical attention and disclosed the nature of
the illness.
   Another official, speaking on condition of anonymity, reported
progress in recent talks between Mandela and senior members of the
government. He declined to elaborate.
   Botha, addressing leaders of his National Party in Natal
province, said: ``The government, in a responsible way, will
consider the matter and if we get the cooperation we have so far
got from Mr. Mandela, I believe we will get positive results.
   ``Personally, I don't think that at his age and condition it
would be wise for him to choose to go back to prison, and I hope he
will make it possible for me to act in a humane way so that we can
have peace in South Africa,'' Botha said.
   Botha met before his speech with Justice Minister Kobie Coetsee,
who visited Mandela at Tygerberg on Wednesday.
   ``He appears to be comfortable and appears to have taken the
first steps toward recovery,'' Coetsee said of Mandela. ``He looks
as though he is almost his old self and he is already enjoying
jokes.''
   Doctors said Mandela probably will have a complete recovery.
   Van der Merwe said the government was not expecting Mandela to
sign anything, or even publicly disavow African National Congress
policy, but expected that he would not promote violent activities.
   However, Botha said in his speech, ``I am prepared to release
Mandela if he would say he rejects violence as a means for
political ends.''
   Tom Lodge, a University of the Witwatersrand academic who is a
leading expert on the ANC, said, ``I don't think Mandela will
accept anything other than unconditional release.'' But he added:
``If he is ill, it is unlikely that he would be involved ... in
violence.''
   Van der Merwe said last month that Mandela had already served
enough time for punishment of his crime and the only purpose in
keeping him in prison was national security.
   Mandela has rejected previous offers of freedom if he renounced
violence. He has said the government must end apartheid, legalize
the African National Congress and grant political rights to blacks.
   Last year, the government unconditionally freed Govan Mbeki, 77,
a congress official imprisoned for life at the same time as Mandela.
   Mbeki said he had not renounced violence or the congress. After
a few public appearances, the government banned him from addressing
audiences, giving interviews or leaving his hometown.

<HEAD>Roy Rogers Pulls Ad After School Food Workers Complain It's
Demeaning</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN SHANAHAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Roy Rogers television commercial that school
cafeteria workers found demeaning for its portrayal of them as drab
and lazy servers of unappetizing food will be pulled, a spokesman
for the chain said Thursday.
   ``I think they've stooped to a new low by advocating that
children ought to eat junk food on a daily basis,'' said Charles
Hughes, president of Local 372 of the State, County and Municipal
Workers, AFL-CIO, which has more than 8,000 school cafeteria
workers.
   Hughes called the TV spot ``despicable'' and said he hoped
schoolchildren ``will not wind up over the years like Trigger, who
Roy Rogers has stuffed.'' Trigger was the screen cowboy's horse.
   The commercial starts with the tune, ``See You in September,''
and shows a series of cafeteria workers holding trays of
unappealing food close to the camera.
   ``The ad very clearly sends a message that one of the things you
ought to be dreading as Labor Day approaches is a return to the
school cafeteria,'' said City Councilwoman Ruth Messinger.
   Rick Sneed, public relations director for Marriott, which owns
the Roy Rogers chain, said the ad was intended to be a spoof of the
way cafeterias were years ago.
   Sneed said the company got calls from food service managers
complaining that ``that's not the way cafeteria workers look now
and it's also not the type of food served now _ macaroni and
cheese, sandwiches and so forth.''
   Sneed said the company does not feel that the commercial is
demeaning. ``Marriott has over 65,000 employees that work in
cafeterias and the last thing we're going to do is try and offend
somebody,'' he said.
   The ad began about 10 days ago and was to run until Sept. 9, but
Sneed said, ``It's our intent to pull it as soon as we can. It will
not run its full course.''

   China has been given approval to buy an
additional 2 million metric tons of U.S. wheat at subsidized
prices, the Agriculture Department said Thursday.
   Acting Undersecretary Richard W. Goldberg said the wheat will be
sold to China at competitive world prices under the department's
EEP or Export Enhancement Program.
   Under various authorizations or initiatives since Jan. 26, 1987,
China has bought about 7 million tons of U.S. wheat under the EEP
program. The previous authorization was for 2 million tons on April
5. Of that amount, only 10,000 tons remain for use, which is added
to the latest authorization.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushels
of wheat.
   Under EEP arrangements, exporters can sell U.S. commodities at
reduced prices to meet foreign competition and then collect free
government surpluses of grain or other commodities as bonuses or
subsidies.
   The Soviet Union also has been a big buyer of U.S. wheat under
EEP, with purchases totaling about 13 million tons since April 30,
1987.

   Lebanon postponed presidential elections
Thursday after hard-line Christians opposed to Syria's role in the
country missed a Parliament session where a Syrian-backed candidate
was favored to win election.
   Christian radio stations said two shells crashed near President
Amin Gemayel's palace in suburban Baabda after the session was
called off. They said there were no casualties.
   Police said they could not confirm the report and Gemayel's
spokesmen refused to comment.
   Interior Minister Abdulla Rassi accused the Lebanese Forces of
``forcefully preventing'' 15 members of Parliament from attending
the meeting. The military denied that.
   The Parliament lacked a quorum, preventing the election of
Suleiman Franjieh, a feudal lord opposed by the Lebanese Forces,
the main Christian militia.
   Only 38 Parliament members showed up, with 51 required for a
quorum.
   Gemayel's Phalange Party and the National Liberal Party of
Israeli-leaning Dany Chamoun, which back the Lebanese Forces,
boycotted the session.
   ``I shall set a date for a new session after speedy and
extensive consultations with parliamentary blocs,'' House Speaker
Hussein Husseini told reporters.
   The constitution stipulates that a president should be elected
before Sept. 23, when Gemayel's six-year term expires.
   In Washington, U.S. officials expressed regret at the
postponement and urged balloting before the constitutional deadline.
   ``We regret that a consensus candidate has not yet been found,''
said State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley.
   After the session was canceled, British Ambassador Alan Ramsey
told reporters: ``Some rethinking should be done in Damascus.''
   He appeared to suggest that Syria, Lebanon's main power-broker,
might reconsider its outright support for Franjieh in his bid to
seek a new term.
   Franjieh's campaign office said he would not drop out of the
race.
   Rassi accused the Lebanese Forces of ``forcefully preventing
more than 15 Christian Parliament members from reaching the
session'' to vote for Franjieh, 78.
   ``Some were forced by gunmen to go back home and at least two
deputies were detained,'' Rassi said, identifying them as Michael
Daher and Elias Hrawi, both Maronite Catholics like Franjieh.
   ``Daher was later released but I do not have any word about
Hrawi's fate yet,'' said Rassi, who is Franjieh's son-in-law.
   Kazem Khalil, a Shiite Moslem deputy who lives in east Beirut,
also said he was ``forbidden at gunpoint from leaving my house to
go to Parliament,'' he said.
   The Lebanese Forces commander, Samir Geagea, denied the charge,
saying ``Rassi is merely trying to cover up for his father-in-law's
failure'' to get elected.
   Franjieh, president from 1970 to 1976, alleges Geagea led a 1978
raid on his mansion that killed his eldest son and 30 bodyguards.
   The Lebanese Forces had vowed to block his return to power,
saying he would certainly seek to rekindle the dormant civil war.
   The Christian milita maintains good relations with Israel, which
controls a border enclave in south Lebanon.
   Franjieh, Syria's closest Christian ally in Lebanon, was the
leading contender among two dozen aspirants. The civil war erupted
in 1975 while he was in office and he is widely disliked for asking
Syria to use its military to intervene. Syria has 40,000 troops in
the country.

<TEXT>
   Three people have been hospitalized and the
town council split by arguments over a police car, which forced
officers to patrol in a dump truck when it broke down and made
headlines when it was replaced.
   Council President Bill Henderson collapsed Saturday in the
mayor's office upon hearing that a councilman got into a shouting
match with a Canadian disc jockey who helped raise money to buy a
new police car.
   Henderson was in satisfactory condition Thursday at Veterans
Medical Center in Altoona after being admitted for chest pains the
day before, said hospital spokesman Jim Mielnik.
   The disc jockey, Scruff Connors of CHTZ-FM in St. Catherines,
Ontario, had to be hospitalized for exhaustion after he arrived in
Portage two weeks ago to present the town with a new car. He had
raised about $12,000 from his listeners and contributed about
$4,500 himself.
   Connors was released from a hospital in nearby Johnstown last
week and was back in Portage when he encountered Councilman John
Mutsko on Main Street.
   Henderson said Wednesday that Mutsko, who had voted against
accepting the cruiser, made an obscene remark and told the disc
jockey to drive the car back to Canada.
   Connors returned Sunday to Canada, and Mutsko was charged with
harassment and disorderly conduct.
   Another councilman, George Calaba, has been in the hospital
twice since January for stress that Mayor Howard W. Smith says was
created by arguments over the cruiser.
   Police officers in this town of 3,510 people began using the
borough's dump truck in mid-July when their lone cruiser broke down.
   Connors began raising money for the car when he heard the news,
which made headlines in the United States and Canada. Medley, Fla.,
also donated an unmarked detective's car to Portage, which Smith
picked up last week.

<HEAD>Namibian Guerrilla Leader Says South Africa Really Wants
Independence</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The leader of the guerrilla
movement seeking independence for Namibia says he believes South
Africa is sincerely committed to ending its rule over the territory.
   Sam Nujoma, president of the South-West African People's
Organization, commented in an interview with the Argus News Service
published Thursday in the South African company's newspapers.
   SWAPO has been fighting since 1966 for independence in Namibia,
also known as South-West Africa. South Africa said this month it
would begin implementing a U.N. independence plan for Namibia if
agreement was reached on withdrawal of Cuban troops from
neighboring Angola.
   Nujoma was quoted as saying his guerrillas would observe a
cease-fire in Namibia starting Sept. 1 and thereafter would fight
only in self-defense.
   ``Let us believe that this time, the South African government is
serious,'' he was quoted as saying.
   The report said Nujoma made a major concession by saying SWAPO
would not delay the peace process by insisting that an independent
Namibia take possession of Walvis Bay, a South African enclave
which is only major port serving the territory.
   Nujoma also was quoted as saying he would not allow the African
National Congress, the main guerrilla movement fighting for
black-majority rule in South Africa, to maintain bases in Namibia.
   SWAPO is widely considered the likely winner of independence
elections envisioned under the U.N. independence plan.
   Nujoma, interviewed in Zambia, was quoted as saying a SWAPO
government might adopt a one-party socialist system if there was
enough public support. But he said it would not launch a sweeping
expropriation of private property.
   South African President P.W. Botha, in a policy speech today,
endorsed the peace initiative but said his government would insist
that the United Nations prove its impartiality before independence
elections in Namibia.
   In Namibia's capital, Windhoek, police on Thursday blocked all
entrances to the high-rise building that houses the University of
Namibia, arrested two students and said they wouldn't leave until
leaders of a class boycott were handed over.
   Police arrested 37 students from the campus after peaceful
demonstrations on Wednesday. Some of the 2,000 students have been
participating in a four-week boycott in sympathy with pupils in
northern Namibia.
   The students in northern Ovamboland have been demanding that
South African troops move their bases away from schools which may
be caught in cross-fire between the soldiers and SWAPO guerrillas.
   In Washington, the State Department said that the government of
Congo will host the next round of four-nation talks on the
withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola and independence for Namibia.
   The talks will be held in Brazzaville starting Aug. 24, and the
U.S. team will be headed by Assistant Secretary of State for
African Affairs Chester Crocker, said spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley.
   Representatives of Angola, South Africa, Cuba and the United
States will seek to consolidate the gains they made in their fifth
round of talks in Geneva earlier this month and will work on
timetables for the Cuban withdrawal, she said.

<HEAD>Mother Suspected Of Unusual Form Of Child Abuse</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An occupational therapist was charged
with assault after doctors secretly videotaped her smothering her
1-year-old son in his hospital bed and then reviving him,
authorities said.
   The child had been hospitalized eight times since he was 7 weeks
old for what authorities had thought were respiratory attacks and
had suffered numerous, similar attacks at home, according to a
police complaint.
   Jane Swanson Wilken, 36, of South St. Paul was charged Wednesday
with third-degree assault. She is accused of blocking the breathing
of her son, Matthew, until he lost consciousness.
   The incident was recorded on videotape in the sleeping
laboratory at Children's Hospital in St. Paul, where doctors were
diagnosing the child's recurring respiratory attacks.
   The mother, who knows cardiopulmonary resuscitation, revived the
boy on some occasions and paramedics revived him other times, the
complaint said.
   Hospital officials became suspicious of the mother after the boy
was brought in for the seventh time on June 2, the complaint said.
Doctors initially believed he suffered from a breathing disorder,
but tests proved negative.
   Video surveillance began on June 9 and was conducted for seven
days. On June 14 around 10:30 p.m., videotape shows Mrs. Wilken
pressing her son's mouth and nose against her chest while he slept,
the complaint said.
   The video shows the boy struggling to escape before he went
stiff and then limp, the complaint said. When a respiration monitor
alarm went off, the videotape shows Mrs. Wilken calling for help
and giving her son mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.
   Tests indicate the boy has not suffered brain damage, the
complaint said.
   According to police, the boy was released from the hospital to
the care of his father, James Wilken, at the couple's home. Mrs.
Wilken was ordered to move in with her mother and father, who is a
physician.
   Ramsey County Attorney Tom Foley said the case apparently
involves a psychiatric disorder known as ``Munchausen syndrome by
proxy.''
   ``In this case, everybody believes a small child has a serious
illness and it brings attention to the mother,'' Foley said. ``She
acts like a `model' mother being able to take care of this sick
child.''
   The disorder is derived from Baron von Munchausen, an
18th-century German who became well known for elaborate lies.
   John Wodele, executive assistant to Foley, said Thursday that
Mrs. Wilken has cooperated with the investigation and is expected
to surrender to authorities by early next week.
   Mrs. Wilken's lawyer, Linda Gallant, declined to comment beyond
saying that her client is cooperating.
   Wodele said charges were not filed immediately because child
protection measures were in place. ``We're also dealing in an area
that's new to us,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   About 355 million bushels of government-owned
feed grains have been set aside as a reserve to meet potential
demand for emergency livestock use under the recently passed $3.9
billion Drought Assistance Act, the Agriculture Department said
Thursday.
   Deputy Secretary Peter C. Myers said the grains are owned by the
department's Commodity Credit Corp. and are held in warehouse in 40
states. The grains include 250.4 million bushels of corn, 79.7
million bushels of sorghum and 25 million bushels of barley.
   Myers said additional stocks of CCC feed grains can be made
available if demand from eligible farmers proves greater than
current projections.
   The drought relief measure was signed by President Reagan on
Aug. 11. Myers said final rules as to eligibility requirements for
the grain will be issued soon. The program will be carried out by
county offices of the department's Agricultural Stabilization and
Conservation Service.

   Moving with unusual speed,
President Reagan announced Thursday he will nominate veteran
diplomat Robert B. Oakley to replace Arnold L. Raphel, the U.S.
ambassador to Pakistan who was killed in an airplane crash.
   The White House said the president was placing telephone calls
to Nancy Ely-Raphel, the ambassador's widow, and Sara Raphel, his
mother.
   The announcement said the president also planned to call Judy
Wassom, wife of Gen. Herbert M. Wasson, chief U.S. military
representative in Pakistan, who was killed in the crash Wednesday
along with Pakistani President Mohammed Zia ul-Haq.
   ``The president is expressing condolences and sympathy on behalf
of the nation,'' White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said.
   Fitzwater said the president and First Lady Nancy Reagan, along
with Vice President George Bush and his wife, Barbara, had sent
messages of condolence to Zia's wife and family.
   The White House said Reagan and Bush also had sent messages to
Ghulam Ishaq Khan, the newly named acting president of Pakistan.
Reagan's message said, ``Let us all rededicate ourselves to the
task of regional peace and reconstruction to which President Zia
dedicated his life. As you carry out your heavy responsibilities in
his absence, please count on the United States for support.''
   The White House statement said Reagan told Zia's widow that the
Pakistani president ``was a great statesman whose loss will be
mourned by his people and the world.''
   Pakistan is one of the United States' more important allies.
   Fitzwater said the president had asked Secretary of State George
P. Shultz to lead a U.S. delegation to Zia's funeral Saturday in
Islamabad. Oakley, now senior director of Middle East, South Asia,
and North Africa affairs for the National Security Council, will
join several members of Congress in the delegation.
   In Washington, the State Department declined to speculate about
the cause of the fatal plane crash but praised the Pakistani
government's decisions to hold elections in November as scheduled
and to stick to the foreign policy pursued by Zia.
   At the Pentagon, spokesman Dan Howard said eight U.S. accident
investigators was due in Pakistan Thursday to help search for the
cause of the plane crash.
   A second group, including six U.S. military forensic
specialists, will assist the Pakistanis in identifying the victims
of the crash. That team is being sent from West Germany, Howard
said.
   State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley, whose husband is
Reagan's choice to replace Raphel in Islamabad, told reporters that
Acting President Ishaf Khan had reaffirmed Pakistan's pro-U.S.
foreign policy ``and its continuing steps toward democracy.''
   She said Ishaf Khan had indicated elections would be held as
scheduled by Zia in mid-November.
   ``These are sound first steps,'' Mrs. Oakley said, and ``a
welcome sign.''
   Robert Oakley, 57, was a resident fellow at the Carnegie

<HEAD>Alaska Voters Consider 1994 Olympics Issue</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A ballot issue crucial to Anchorage's
bid for the 1994 Winter Olympics will be decided in Tuesday's
election, along with lopsided primary races in both parties for the
state's lone congressional seat.
   Anchorage is one of four cities in the running for the 1994
winter games, with the winner to be decided by the International
Olympic Committee next month. The other finalists are in Norway,
Bulgaria and Sweden.
   In 1985, Anchorage voters endorsed the Olympics bid by a 2-to-1
margin, but they were not told at the time that the city would have
to sign a financial agreement. Tuesday's vote will determine
whether they would back financial guarantees.
   In July, a poll sanctioned by the Anchorage Organizing
Committee, the group trying to bring the Olympics here, showed
voters evenly divided on the question.
   If the referendum proposal passes, the Anchorage municipal
government would agree to become jointly liable for the AOC's
costs, should their efforts at private fund-raising fall short. But
at the same time the proposal specifies that the committee is
expected to raise the needed funds itself.
   Any bond issue to build stadiums or other Olympics facilities
would have to be approved by another referendum, the proposal
states.
   Earlier this year, IOC President Juan Samaranch said that for
Anchorage to stay in the running, there would have to be a
significant margin of victory in the election to reassure the IOC
that the city is committed to staging the games.
   The AOC has said private money, mostly from television
contracts, will cover the cost of holding the games.
   Supporters say the games would boost Anchorage's image, but
opponents say they doubt the games can pay for themselves and
dismiss the image argument.
   In the twin congressional primaries, Rep. Don Young, an
eight-term Republican, and Democrat Peter Gruenstein, a former
state prosecutor making his first try for statewide office, both
face only minor opposition.
   Gruenstein has been ignoring his primary competition to aim
verbal jabs at Young, who admitted in a fund-raising appeal June 30
that this fall he ``will be embroiled in a tough re-election
battle.''
   Young for the third time is being challenged for the Republican
nomination by George Johnston, an ARCO Alaska employee from
Anchorage whom Young defeated by a 50-to-1 margin in the 1986
primary.
   Gruenstein is opposed for the Democratic nomination by Eugene
Vick of Juneau and Ryal White of Anchorage, both relative unknowns.
White ran in the Democratic primary for governor in 1986 and lost.

<HEAD>Jordan Says Confederation With Palestinian State No Longer
Automatic</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN RICE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>AMMAN, Jordan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jordan no longer views confederation with
an eventual Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip as
automatic, a palace official said Thursday.
   The development makes U.S. proposals for Middle East peace more
unlikely than ever before.
   The palace official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Jordan no longer wants to be a ``screen'' separating the United
States and Israel from negotiating directly with the Palestine
Liberation Organization.
   ``Once the Palestinian state is there, we Jordanians are going
to look at the relationship and decide if we are going to accept a
confederation,'' the official said. ``It's a choice.''
   Ever since the United States arranged the Camp David accords
between Egypt and Israel in 1979, U.S. officials have said their
Middle East peace plans depend on Jordan overseeing a Palestinian
entity on the territories Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East
War.
   Until the war, Jordan considered the West Bank part of its own
territory, and Egypt held a mandate over the Gaza Strip.
   Only five months ago, U.S. Secretary of State George P. Shultz
told reporters in Amman that he envisioned a Palestinian mini-state
tied to Jordan much as California and Texas are tied to the United
States.
   But on July 31, King Hussein renounced sovereignty over the West
Bank to honor Arab summit declarations making the PLO ``the sole
and legitimate representative of the Palestinian people.''
   After Hussein's announcement, State Department officials in
Washington insisted their peace plans were still alive.
   The palace official said Jordan was still involved in any
Arab-Israeli peace efforts and noted that Jordan shares Israel's
longest border. But he stressed that the PLO was in charge of
dealing with the Palestinian issue.
   The concept of a confederation between Jordan and a Palestinian
state was enshrined in a February 1985 agreement between Hussein
and PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat.
   Most PLO officials, however, insisted that an independent state
should precede a confederation. Jordan argued for recovery of the
occupied lands before settling their status.
   Jordan hoped a confederation would ease fears of an independent
Palestinian state on Israel's border and coax the United States and
Israel into an international peace conference to settle the long
conflict.
   ``It was an instrument to make the international conference
work,'' the palace official said.
   Most officials still regard some form of confederation as
inevitable because Jordan and the West Bank have strong family and
economic links and a separate West Bank may not be economically
viable.
   While Jordan has cooled on the confederation plan, PLO officials
who conferred with leaders in Amman this week reiterated their
support for such a plan.
   They told reporters privately, however, that they received no
response from the Jordanians.
   Ironically, Jordan's decision to step aside in favor of the PLO
appears to have prompted PLO leaders to consider the explicit
recognition of Israel.
   U.S. officials cite the PLO's formal refusal to accept Israel as
a key reason for refusing to deal with the organization.
   PLO officials say an upcoming meeting of the policy-making
Palestine National Council probably will establish a provisional
government and approve a ``declaration of independence'' for the
West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Discussions on the form of a government are still under way
within the PLO. But officials said it almost surely will be based
on acceptance of U.N. Security Council Resolution 181, the measure
that created Israel and called for a Palestinian state.
   It would also sidestep clauses in the PLO charter that demand
Israel's eventual replacement with a ``democratic secular state.''
   PLO officials hope such a plan will win Western support and
create a potential bargaining partner for Israel and the United
States in peace talks.

<TEXT>
   Jerry Dorris is one person who would like to see
the Republican National Convention last longer. Business at his
video rental store is up 20 percent as a prime alternative to all
the political talk.
   ``I wish the conventions were each two months long and were held
every year,'' said Dorris, owner of Landmark Video in the Empire
State Building, where comedies and action adventures were
alternatives to acceptance speeches.
   ``The majority of our customers want to be entertained after a
day of work. They don't want to be bored by the convention. The
general comment is they've had enough and they'd much rather watch
a movie,'' Dorris said Thursday.
   A spot check of other stores indicated movie fans have elected
to tune out the George Bush and Dan Quayle show, which has filled
prime time for the three networks, and flicked to fantasyland
instead.
   ``The Manchurian Candidate'' was doing well in some areas, but
political movies such as ``All The President's Men,'' ``The
Candidate'' with Robert Redford and ``Advise and Consent'' gathered
dust on the shelves.
   Nor was there much demand for Ronald Reagan's ``Bedtime For
Bonzo'' or ``Knute Rockne _ All-American,'' the movie where he
first asked his mentor to win one for the Gipper.
   ``People are pretty bored with the convention,'' said Sue
Granat, salesperson at New York City's Videoroom, where rentals are
up 25 percent.
   ``There hasn't been a good convention since the Democrats in
1968. That had drama and violence,'' she said.
   Rentals also increased during the Democratic gathering in
Atlanta, but the earlier convention at least had some electricity
between Jesse Jackson and Miachel Dukakis, store officials said.
   At the Video Circus, rentals were up 33 percent for the week.
   ``Everyone is complaining, coming in here and saying they don't
want to be bored,'' said store owner Frank Lopez. ``I guess it's
important, but it's quite monotonous after a while. I mean, really,
four days of that stuff?''

   Four affiliates of the ruling United
National Party and two government militiamen were shot to death in
attacks that military officials blamed Thursday on Sinhalese
radicals.
   Members of the Sinhalese People's Liberation Front, a group of
radicals opposed to an India-sponsored peace plan, allegedly fired
at a group of militiamen in Moneragala district in southern Sri
Lanka, said officials who asked not to be identified. The militants
killed two militiamen and abducted the son of one of them.
   A member of the UNP, Lionel Abeysuriya, was shot and killed in
the town of Tissamaharana, also in the south. In the Akuressa
district, three supporters of the governing party were shot and
killed, officials said.
   The Sinhalese extremists have vowed to kill all supporters of
the peace plan aimed at ending the Tamil separatist war on the
island. They say it grants too many concessions to the minority
Tamils.
   The extremists have been blamed for the deaths of about 400
government officials and ruling party supporters since the accord
was signed July 29, 1987.

   Residents said Thursday they will ban
further excavations around the gold-filled tomb of the father of
Alexander the Great until plans for a museum are approved.
   ``The finds from Vergina should be displayed in a museum here,
where they come from. People are protesting because they're tired
of government promises that it will be built one day,'' said Mayor
Andreas Vlazakis.
   Artifacts from the tomb _ including priceless gold-decorated
armor, gold wreaths and jewelery _ are displayed in the Salonica
Museum, 44 miles away.
   Vergina first made headlines in 1977 when Professor Manolis
Andronikos of Salonica University unearthed the tomb of King Philip
of Macedon beneath a mound in the village.
   Andronikos, who has excavated at Vergina for 50 years, said he
wouldn't challenge the digging ban, but added: ``I feel very bitter
and I hope reason will prevail.''
   Alexander the Great became ruler of Macedon when his father was
assassinated at a wedding feast in 336 B.C.

   Firefighters didn't believe a 12-year-old
girl and her sister when they reported smelling smoke, but the
girls wouldn't give up.
   It turned out the house next door was burning, and the neighbor
says the sisters saved her life.
   Cheryl Price called the Fire Department on Monday and reported
that her two daughters had called her to say they smelled smoke at
their home. Cybil, 12, and Laura, 9, were home alone and thought
their own house was burning.
   But when firefighters arrived, they could find no smoke or fire.
   ``The two little girls kept saying they could smell smoke, but
we couldn't find anything,'' Fire Chief Larry Causey said. ``They
contended that they smelled smoke and they were not going to give
up. They were very persistent on it.''
   Moments later, firefighters rushed into the house next door and
found Kay McDonagh asleep with a pot of chicken burning on her
stove. Neither of her two smoke detectors were working.
   ``I had been to Columbia, and when I came home I took some
medicine for a bronchial infection,'' Ms. McDonagh said. ``I put
some chicken on to boil and laid down to rest. The next thing I
know, 10 firemen are tromping into my house.''
   They arrived just in time, she said.
   Ms. McDonagh credited the girls with saving her life.
   ``If they hadn't been that caring and thoughtful, and if they
had waited until they saw flames, the smoke inhalation may have
gotten to me,'' she said. ``There's a very good possibility that I
may have died.''

<TEXT>
   Izvestia, which published a letter saying works of
some former Soviet leaders now in disfavor were being purged from
libraries, said Thursday they were only being moved and would be
readily available.
   The government newspaper was seeking to quiet a storm that arose
after the letter appeared Tuesday saying librarians were ordered to
take the works off their shelves.
   The letter, signed by I. Zavgorognyaya, said the Soviet Union
was creating new ``blank spots'' in its history by removing
information that should be in libraries regardless of the authors'
current political status.
   Among those mentioned were Leonid I. Brezhnev, whose tenure in
1964-1982 is being criticized by Mikhail S. Gorbachev's Kremlin as
a period of stagnation and corruption.
   Izvestia quoted the Ministry of Culture on Thursday as saying
few people were interested in reading the works of Brezhnev or
Konstantin U. Chernenko, who led the Soviet Union for a year and
was Gorbachev's immediate predecessor.
   According to Izvestia, the ministry said it could not use 40
percent of its library fund because there is no space for new books.
   Any books removed from the shelves will be provided to readers
``at their first demand,'' the newspaper said.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov told a regular
news briefing Thursday some libraries have dozens of copies of some
books, such as collected works of previous Soviet leaders.
   He said the libraries had been given permission to remove some
copies in order to make space for new books.

Theater</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A chief deputy constable who banned officers in
his precinct from working off-duty security jobs at a theater
showing ``The Last Temptation of Christ'' said he did so because he
believes the movie is sacrilegious.
   Chief Deputy Constable Glen Cheek of Precinct 5 imposed the ban
for deputy constables earlier this week. The movie, which has
angered conservative Christian groups and caused protests in other
cities, opens Friday in Houston at one theater.
   ``I feel the film is simply in bad taste and sacrilegious, and I
just didn't want them working there,'' Cheek said.
   Cheek imposed the ban without consulting Constable Steve Radack,
who was in New Orleans for the Republican National Convention. But
Radack said Wednesday he supports the decision.
   ``It is my personal opinion that the movie is sacrilegious,''
Radack said.
   Constables are officers of the court who serve warrants and
other legal papers, and also have powers of arrest.
   The film by director Martin Scorsese, which has drawn good
crowds despite vehement protests, was scheduled to open in eight
more theaters across the country this weekend after opening in nine
last weekend.
   Because of the protests, officials of Cineplex Odeon's Spectrum
theater in west Houston sought extra security. When Cheek rejected
the request, the theater sought to hire Harris County deputies.
   However, Harris County Sheriff's Chief Deputy Tommy Thomas said
the theater was within Houston city limits and therefore not within
the jurisdiction of county authorities.
   Radack said he understood that one deputy from Precinct 5
normally works at the theater weekdays and two on weekends, but
that six had been requested for the opening of ``The Last
Temptation of Christ.''
   Houston Police Deputy Chief Bill Gaines said he was unsure
whether officers would be allowed to work at the theater.
   ``Normally, we would not let off-duty people work where there is
likely to be a confrontation or unruly crowds,'' Gaines said.

   Police inspecting a shipment of live

Middle Eastern and southeast Asian heroin.

<HEAD>Death Toll Rises to 24, Speed Limit Reportedly Was Lifted</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Two people died of injuries suffered when a
passenger train speeding from Leningrad to Moscow derailed and
caught fire, raising the death toll to 24, a local official
reported on Thursday.
   Soviet media differed on the probable cause of the incident
Tuesday evening near Bologoye, about 180 miles northwest of Moscow.
   Tass news agency said a preliminary investigation indicated
Bologoye stationmaster V. Khrustalev prematurely raised a speed
limit imposed when inspectors discovered a deviation in the track.
   The government newspaper Izvestia said repairs had been
completed on the section of track, but were poorly done.
   Izvestia said 83 people remained hospitalized Thursday.
   Boris A. Petrov, deputy Communist Party head of the Kalinin
region where the accident occurred, said in a telephone interview
that two of the 107 people initially hospitalized after the crash
had died.
   Petrov said the only foreigners among the 760 passengers aboard
the Aurora were a group of 32 Brazilian tourists and that none of
them was hurt.
   An official of the Brazilian Embassy in Moscow, however,
speaking on condition of anonymity, said 34 Brazilians were aboard
and some suffered minor cuts from broken window glass.
   The route between Moscow and Leningrad, the Soviet Union's two
largest cities, is one of the busiest in the country, and trains
typically operate at capacity.
   Media reports said it is the only high-speed route in the Soviet
Union, normally posted for speeds of up to 120 mph.
   Tass said in a Russian-language report that three hours before
the accident, Khrustalev had removed a 60 kilometer-per-hour (just
over 37 mph) speed limit imposed a day earlier by an inspection
crew that had noticed a deviation of about one inch in the track.
   ``The motive for his decision still has to be clarified: whether
he received inaccurate information, or he himself thought that
there no longer was any danger. In either case, the repair work
carried out by senior engineer N. Gavrilov was not completed,''
Tass said.
   It said the locomotive engineer spotted the variation in the
track and tried to brake, but too late. The locomotive passed over
the spot but the passenger cars tore away and derailed.
   Fire broke out immediately and engulfed the train. Investigators
believe it was caused by leaking fuel from the restaurant car.
   Medical specialists from Moscow, Leningrad and other major
Soviet cities were flown into Bologoye to help, the reports said.
   About 15 trains were delayed in Moscow, stranding hundreds of
people. But in Leningrad buses took tourist groups to the airport
for a special flight to Moscow.

<TEXT>
   Citing the state's interest in promoting
marriage, the California Supreme Court refused Thursday to allow a
man who saw his lover killed in a car crash sue for emotional
distress and loss of her companionship.
   Although a lover's emotional injuries may be as real and
foreseeable as those suffered by a spouse or a parent, who have the
right to sue, society would suffer ``an intolerable burden'' if
suits were not limited to relationships recognized by law, the
court ruled.
   The 6-1 ruling did not repeal the court's landmark 1976 decision
allowing one member of an unmarried couple to bind the other to an
implied promise of financial support.
   ``The state has a strong interest in the marriage
relationship,'' wrote Justice Stanley Mosk for the majority. ``To
the extent unmarried cohabitants are granted the same rights as
married persons, the state's interest in promoting marriage is
inhibited.''
   He also said allowing a suit by a lover ``would impose a
difficult burden on the courts,'' which would have to decide
whether the relationship was ``stable and significant'' and
contained ``the emotional attachments of the family relationship.''
Such an inquiry would also threaten a ``massive intrusion into the
private life of the partners,'' Mosk said.
   In dissent, Justice Allen Broussard said there was no legal or
social reason to prevent one member of a couple living together to
sue for emotional damage caused by seeing the other partner injured.
   Such emotional injuries are to be expected, ``given the
widespread reality and acceptance of unmarried cohabitation,''
Broussard said.
   He also noted that the ruling effectively forbids such lawsuits
by members of homosexual couples, who cannot legally marry.
   The suit was filed by Richard Elden, who was injured in a
December 1982 crash in Pasadena that killed Linda Ebeling, with
whom he shared a home.
   Elden sued Robert Sheldon, the driver of the other car, accusing
him of running a red light. He sought damages not only for his
physical injuries, but for his emotional trauma caused by seeing
Ms. Ebeling killed, and for loss of love, companionship, emotional
support and sexual relations.
   His lawsuit for physical injuries was later settled, but the
second claim was dismissed by Los Angeles Superior Court Judge
George Xanthos, whose ruling was upheld by a state appeals court.
   Those rulings, and Thursday's Supreme Court decision, rejected
rulings by a few appellate courts allowing suits by one member of a
couple who claimed a ``stable, significant relationship,''
equivalent to marriage.
   Mosk said the number of unmarried couples living together had
increased dramatically, and that there was no doubt ``some of these
couples are bound by emotional ties as strong as those that bind
formally married partners.''
   However, he said a ban on lawsuits by unmarrieds was justified
by public policy, and by the need to limit the range of lawsuits
that can be filed for an act of negligence.
   Married couples ``are granted significant rights and bear
important responsibilities toward one another which are not shared
by those who cohabit without marriage,'' including duties of
financial support, Mosk said.

   The leader of the guerrilla

   Sam Nujoma, president of the South-West African People's

   SWAPO has been fighting since 1966 for independence in Namibia,
also known as South-West Africa. South Africa said this month it
would begin implementing a U.N. independence plan for Namibia if
agreement was reached on withdrawal of Cuban troops from
neighboring Angola.
   Nujoma was quoted as saying his guerrillas would observe a
cease-fire in Namibia starting Sept. 1 and thereafter would fight
only in self-defense.
   ``Let us believe that this time, the South African government is
serious,'' he was quoted as saying.
   The report said Nujoma made a major concession by saying SWAPO
would not delay the peace process by insisting that an independent
Namibia take possession of Walvis Bay, a South African enclave
which is only major port serving the territory.
   Nujoma also was quoted as saying he would not allow the African
National Congress, the main guerrilla movement fighting for
black-majority rule in South Africa, to maintain bases in Namibia.
   SWAPO is widely considered the likely winner of independence
elections envisioned under the U.N. independence plan.
   Nujoma, interviewed in Zambia, was quoted as saying a SWAPO
government might adopt a one-party socialist system if there was
enough public support. But he said it would not launch a sweeping
expropriation of private property.
   South African President P.W. Botha, in a policy speech today,
endorsed the peace initiative but said his government would insist
that the United Nations prove its impartiality before independence
elections in Namibia.
   In Namibia's capital, Windhoek, police on Thursday blocked all
entrances to the high-rise building that houses the University of
Namibia, arrested two students and said they wouldn't leave until
leaders of a class boycott were handed over.
   Police arrested 37 students from the campus after peaceful
demonstrations on Wednesday. Some of the 2,000 students have been
participating in a four-week boycott in sympathy with pupils in
northern Namibia.
   The students in northern Ovamboland have been demanding that
South African troops move their bases away from schools which may
be caught in cross-fire between the soldiers and SWAPO guerrillas.
   In Washington, the State Department said that the government of
Congo will host the next round of four-nation talks on the
withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola and independence for Namibia.
   The talks will be held in Brazzaville starting Aug. 24, and the
U.S. team will be headed by Assistant Secretary of State for
African Affairs Chester Crocker, said spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley.
   Representatives of Angola, South Africa, Cuba and the United
States will seek to consolidate the gains they made in their fifth
round of talks in Geneva earlier this month and will work on
timetables for the Cuban withdrawal, she said.

   Six more people died Thursday after
drinking liquor spiked with methanol, bringing the death toll from
recent poisonings to 32, officials said.
   The number is expected to rise because at least 15 other people
are reported in critical condition at city hospitals.
   Two people who allegedly helped make the lethal brew were
arrested Thursday, bringing the number in custody in the case to
13, said Police Commissioner V.K. Saraf. No charges have been filed
yet.
   Police in the western state of Maharashtra are looking for the
man they believe sold the moonshine, Saraf said.
   Bombay, the capital of the western state of Maharashtra, has
more than 100 illegal distilleries, some large enough to make 220
gallons a day.
   A bottle of illicit liquor costs the equivalent of 72 cents, or
one-sixth the price of regular Indian whiskey.

   The Republican Party raked in a whopping $4
million Thursday at an elaborately staged fund-raiser loaded with
lawmakers, corporate chiefs, all manner of celebrities _ and Leo
Nadeau.
   ``You're wondering: Who the hell is Leo Nadeau?'' the
silver-haired man on the stage at the New Orleans Convention Center
told approximately 4,500 mystified guests, most of whom paid $1,000
apiece for their seats.
   The answer: He was George Bush's tail-gunner 45 years ago, when
Bush served as a Navy pilot in the Pacific theater during World War
II. ``We were just a couple of kids,'' Nadeau said. ``But we became
men overnight.''
   Nadeau and other men and women _ wealthy ones, mostly _ honored
Bush and his running mate, Sen. Dan Quayle of Indiana, at the
fund-raising luncheon, which the Republican National Committee
called one of its most successful ever.
   A final tally was not in, but spokeswoman Katherine Murray said
the event raised $4.2 million to $4.4 million for the committee's
operating budget, double what the RNC raised at its gala at the
1984 convention in Dallas.
   While it was the committee's best-ever showing for a
$1,000-per-plate event, it was not an overall fund-raising record.
The RNC pulled in $5.8 million at a higher-priced dinner-dance in
1984, Murray said.
   The luncheon was staged on a ``Road to Victory'' theme, with a
strip of black carpet leading from a huge mockup of a riverboat to
a mockup of The White House. Bush, Quayle and their wives arrived
in a antique fire engine led by a marching band; celebrities in the
audience ranged from Muhammad Ali to Sen. Strom Thurmond of South
Carolina.
   As well as the private and corporate donors who paid $1,000 per
seat, nine corporations underwrote the luncheon with $100,000
donations.
   Quayle, in his remarks, called the Republican Party ``the party
of the great middle class.'' And Bush rewarded the crowd with a
preview of his acceptance speech, saying he would seek to
illustrate the record of his opponent, Gov. Michael Dukakis, and to
lay out his own plans to take over from President Reagan.
   ``Tonight we shift gears. Tonight I will be the nominee, the
standard bearer, of this great party,'' he said. ``And I will spell
out, with clarity, where I want to lead the United States.''
   Bush also stressed his fidelity to Quayle, who was embroiled in
a controversy over whether he used family connections to join the
National Guard in 1969, at a time when he was eligible for the
Vietnam draft.
   For his part, Nadeau spoke of his and Bush's wartime experience
as he introduced the vice president.
   ``There are millions of Americans like me, men and women who've
seen the face of war,'' he said. ``When we elect our next commander
in chief, we will have made sure he is someone who has the courage
and experience we can depend on for our lives and our livelihoods.''
   Bush rose and hugged his old war buddy.

<HEAD>American Psychiatrists Give Mental Boost to Chinese Counterparts</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Nearly 400 American and Chinese psychiatrists are
in Beijing to trade ideas on mental health, a discipline once
regarded as irrelevant in the socialist wonderland of Marx and Mao.
   ``This is very important to the development of Chinese
psychiatry,'' said Yang Deson, vice president of Hunan Medical
University, of the four-day conference this week on advances in
psychiatry.
   ``Ninety percent of China's top psychiatrists are here,'' he
said.
   About 170 American psychiatrists from the American Psychiatric
Association and more than 200 Chinese are attending the seminar,
which takes up such topics as schizophrenia, depression, child and
geriatric psychiatry and counselling patients with AIDS.
   The Chinese psychiatrists are presenting papers on such topics
as drug abuse in Beijing, child mental health in conjunction with
China's one-child population policy and the use of traditional
herbal medicine in treating chronic mental illness.
   Dr. Melvin Sabshin, medical director of the Washington-based
association, said he was impressed with the quality of China's
epidemiological studies and the emergence of younger,
better-trained psychiatrists.
   Sabshin, who is making his sixth visit to China since 1978, said
it was his ``impression that since the Cultural Revolution there
has been more of an acceptance of psychiatry.''
   Marxist ideologues have long regarded mental illness as an
outgrowth of class oppression and dismissed psychoanalysis and
counselling as bourgeois indulgence.
   During the rabidly leftist 1966-76 Cultural Revolution, the
study of psychiatry was suspended and many psychiatrists were
persecuted. China now acknowledges that mental illness can't be
treated with political dogma, and has encouraged the study of
mental health.
   But, according to Yang, China today has only 7,000
psychiatrists, less than half of whom have graduated from
full-course medical universities. By comparison, the United States,
with one-fourth China's 1 billion people, has 35,000 psychiatrists.
   Yang said older practitioners like himself who went to school
before the Cultural Revolution were trained in Soviet methodology.
Although Chinese now recognize the United States as leader in the
field, Pavlovian theories of stimulus and response are still
carefully studied.
   Very few Chinese are trained in Freudian psychoanalysis, partly
because of past political condemnation of Freud's ideas on sex,
Yang said.
   Chinese psychiatrists are also hampered by social attitudes
toward the mentally disturbed. Yang said counselling ``is still
regarded as shameful, a stigma,'' and most of his patients suffer
from major psychoses that neighborhood committees, the powerful
community overseers responsible for settling social discord, are
unable to handle.
   Sabshin noted that this narrow definition of the psychiatrist's
role is prevalent throughout the Third World. He said he had often
seen ``barefoot doctors'' dispersing medicine to people with
anxiety, depression or sexual problems, while only those with
``permanently severe psychosis'' are sent to mental health
specialists.
   China has about 350 mental hospitals, but only 100,000 beds for
an estimated 10 million people suffering from mental illness. While
there is no record, as in the Soviet Union, of confining political
dissidents to mental hospitals, China's Public Security Bureau has
warned that the mentally ill are a growing source of crime and has
set up 16 of its own asylums.
   Yang said mental problems in China, such as emotional and
personal conflicts, family disharmony and sexual problems, are
similar to those in the United States. One new element in China is
mental illness related to business pressures and failures as China
abandons socialist egalitarianism for market-oriented reforms, Yang
said.
   With young medical students still reluctant to pioneer work in
Chinese psychiatry, it's going to be very hard to meet the nation's
rising mental health needs, he said. China, Yang said, ``needs 10
times as many psychiatrists.''

   The body of President Mohammed Zia
ul-Haq was flown to Islamabad on Thursday while investigators
searched a sandy plain 330 miles away for causes of the air
disaster that killed him and the U.S. ambassador.
   A six-man honor guard gently lifted the coffin, draped in the
nation's green-and-white flag and chains of white flowers, from the
ramp of a C-130, the same type of U.S.-built military transport
that crashed Wednesday after taking off from the Bahawalpur airport.
   Killed with Zia were U.S. Ambassador Arnold Raphel; Brig. Gen.
Herbert M. Wassom, the Defense Department representative to
Pakistan; and 27 other people, including five ranking Pakistani
generals. They had witnessed a field trial of the M-1 tank, which
Pakistan is considering buying from the United States.
   Two more C-130s brought the bodies of the other victims to
Islamabad earlier in the day.
   There have been reports, none confirmed, that the crash was
caused by a bomb on board or an anti-aircraft missile. Rumors
spread that it was shot down by India, whose border is 80 miles
from Bahawalpur.
   Ghulam Ishaq Khan, the Senate chairman who became acting
president under the constitution, declared a state of emergency and
10 days of national mourning. He said Wednesday night that sabotage
could not be ruled out.
   Opposition political leaders were silent but there was some
rejoicing Thursday in Karachi, where Benazir Bhutto's Pakistan
People's Party has a large following. People carrying PPP flags
marched in small groups and party supporters distributed candy to
celebrate the end of Zia's 11-year rule.
   Ms. Bhutto, whose father Zulfikar Ali Bhutto was the prime
minister Zia overthrew in 1977 and had executed in 1979, said
Wednesday after the crash: ``Life and death is in the hands of God.
We will not say anything.''
   General calm was reported around the country. Government offices
were closed for three days, by order of Ishaq Khan, and most shops
did not open Thursday.
   United News of India quoted a ``highly-placed Pakistani military
official'' in New Delhi as saying the pilots of the four-engine
Hercules turboprop did not communicate with the control tower. UNI
quoted him as saying the explosion occurred about 40 seconds after
takeoff, probably in the cockpit.
   He said the pilots would have had time to contact the tower if
the plane had been hit by a missile, the UNI reported.
   At the scene in southeast Pakistan, a Pakistan army brigadier
who identified himself only as Zaidi said some witnesses reported
seeing the plane explode but others said it emitted smoke, lost
altitude and crashed.
   The main wreckage lay within a radius of 100 yards, and ``if it
burst in the air it would be spread over a large area,'' he said.
One wing was 1,000 yards away, however, and Zaidi said that was ``a
puzzle to investigators.''
   Pakistani and U.S. teams were searching for the flight recorder,
the ``black box.''
   Wreckage in the concentrated area was charred by fire but a copy
of the Koran, the holy book of Islam, had escaped the flames.
   At the Islamabad airport, weeping relatives walked in a measured
pace to meet the plane carrying the body of the president, who was
64 and a devout Moslem. Floodlights washed away the evening gloom.
   About 300 relatives and state officials, guarded by soldiers
with machine guns and sentries on rooftops, were at the airport to
receive Zia's coffin.
   Men stood in twos and threes, sobbing, with their arms around
one another. Cries and moans rose from the crowd.
   Soldiers formed a chain around the casket and mourners as they
moved slowly across the tarmac to a bus-sized ambulance.
   A state funeral for Zia, a close ally of the United States, is
scheduled for Saturday at a race course in the neighboring city of
Rawalpindi. Secretary of State George P. Shultz will attend.
   In Washington, officials said the United States was sending two
teams of experts to help investigate the crash.
   State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley praised Ishaq Khan's
reaffirmation of Zia's domestic and foreign policies as ``firm
first steps,'' and said civil liberties had not been restricted
under the emergency.
   President Reagan said he will nominate Mrs. Oakley's husband,
57-year-old diplomat Robert B. Oakley, to replace Raphel as
ambassador to Pakistan.
   Letters of condolence arrived in Islamabad from world leaders,
including Reagan and Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi of India, with
which Pakistan has fought three wars since the subcontinent gained
independence from Britain in 1947.
   Three days of mourning were declared in India and in Bangladesh,
which was East Pakistan until a 1971 civil war in which India sided
with the secessionists.
   Some of the deepest sorrow was expressed by leaders of
Afghanistan's Moslem resistance, to which Zia gave unwavering
support.
   ``In the mountains of Afghanistan, commanders and mujahedeen
(guerrillas) hearing of his death will be very sad,'' said Masood
Khalili, spokesman for the Jamiat-i-Islami insurgents. ``No doubt
for all Afghans he was the greatest leader in the Islamic world.''

   Strikes spreading through Poland
crippled production at five vital Silesian coal mines Thursday and
paralyzed Szczecin's port and public transport, opposition leaders
said.
   Workers demand higher wages, better working conditions and that
the outlawed Solidarity trade union federation be made legal again.
   Strikes that began Tuesday when employees occupied the July
Manifesto mine, near Jastrzebie in southwestern Poland, spread to a
fifth mine Thursday.
   Transportation workers in Szczecin also walked out, joining a
shutdown by dock workers in the nation's second-largest port. The
largest is Gdansk, home of Solidarity leader Lech Walesa, who
expressed support Thursday for the ``just struggle.''
   Poland's communist government, which crushed and outlawed
Solidarity after imposing martial law in December 1981, declared
the strikes illegal.
   ``The law clearly states that a strike only can be proclaimed to
defend economic and social interests of a given working group, but
it deems political strikes impermissible,'' said the official news
agency PAP.
   The latest labor unrest follows the pattern of five major
strikes and 25 threats or brief work stoppages between April 25 and
May 10 that constituted the worst labor unrest since martial law.
Participants in those strikes also demanded legal status for
Solidarity.
   Workers at the Jastrzebie Mine at Jastrzebie began a strike
Thursday, according to mine director Jerzy Swiderski. He said he
did not know how many of the 8,400 employees were involved, but
Solidarity activists put the number at 1,500.
   About 600 bus drivers and other employees of Szczecin's
municipal transport system stopped work Thursday morning, snarling
public transportation.
   Witnesses said general cargo operations were said at a
standstill on Szczecin's docks, where Solidarity spokesman Wojciech
Maziarski said 2,000 workers remained on strike.
   In his first statement on the latest labor unrest, Walesa said:
   ``I support the just struggle of the miners, port workers and
other strikers. This is the only way to lead Poland on the road to
reforms. The workers are defending Solidarity because it is for
them the key condition of preparing, winning and carrying out
economic and political reforms.''
   More than 2,000 workers occupied the Andaluzja coal mine in
Piekary Slaskie on Wednesday night, mine officials and Solidarity
activists reported. The Andaluzja mine is 42 miles northeast of the
four others now closed in Silesia, Poland's most industrialized
region.
   About 1,000 workers at the Moszczenica mine near Jastrzebie also
refused to pick up their tools Wednesday night, said Adam
Kowalczyk, a local Solidarity leader. The mine is one of Poland's
largest, employing about 11,000 people.
   Police moved in Thursday and sealed off the area, witnesses said.
   More than 400 miners remained on strike at the Morcinek coal
mine near the Czech border. They declared a sympathy strike
Wednesday with an estimated 5,000 workers who have been holed up in
the July Manifesto mining complex near Jastrzebie for three days.
   Strike leaders and management at July Manifesto discussed
creating an independent union that would not be called Solidarity,
but no agreement was reached, Solidarity officials said.
   No talks were held Thursday, according to mine officials and
Solidarity activists.
   Management and strikers said negotiations were at an impasse.
Strikers want Solidarity advisers allowed in the mine, a demand
management has refused.
   Czeslaw Czerwiec, a spokesman for the Manifesto mine strikers,
said security forces hampered efforts by supporters and relatives
to bring food to the mine.
   ``We're not getting enough to eat,'' Czerwiec said. ``They're
making it tough for us.''
   He said miners would strike until their demands were met.
``We're fighting for everyone,'' he said.
   Police on Tuesday surrounded the July Manifesto mine, about 280
miles southwest of Warsaw, after workers refused to pick up their
tools. About 9,000 workers are employed at the mine, which is key
producer of high-grade export coal.
   Miners say wage demands were based on hardships caused by
Poland's worsening economy, which is strapped by a 60 percent
inflation rate.
   Poland's miners are paid nearly twice the national average of
$100 a month and receive extra benefits because of their role in
the nation's economy.
   Poland is the world's fourth-largest exporter of coal and its
mining operations are essential to the nation's steel, power and
shipbuilding industries. Coal exports are also crucial because
Poland relies heavily on the sales to obtain hard currency to
service its $39 billion foreign debt.
   While workers continue to support the July Manifesto strike,
there is no sign of widespread unrest of the kind that spawned the
union eight years ago.
   Workers at the Lenin shipyard in May declared a sympathy strike
in support of steel workers in Nowa Huta who had shut down
production there.
   The Solidarity commission in the Lenin shipyard in Gdansk has
issued a call for workers to participate in a rally Friday in
support of the strikers.

   Davy Crockett is more than the ``king
of the wild frontier'' to his descendants, who are meeting at a
state park that bears his name.
   ``David was quite a man in his time,'' said Joy Bland of Paris,
Tenn., a great-great-great-great-granddaughter of the Tennessee
pioneer. ``We think he made quite a contribution to our state in
many ways.''
   More than 100 people who have traced their roots to Crockett
began gathering at David Crockett State Park near here Thursday.
The reunion coincides with David Crockett Days, an annual festival.
   ``We want to keep the knowledge of him alive,'' Ms. Bland said.
``I learn something different every reunion.''
   To be a full member of the four-year-old Descendants of David
Crockett organization, people must trace their lineage to one of
Crockett's six children, two stepchildren or two wives. Those who
are simply interested in Crockett can join as associate members.
   The man who historians say called himself David, not Davy,
Crockett was born in northeast Tennessee on Aug. 17, 1786. He
represented the region as a state lawmaker and then was a
congressman in 1827-31 and 1833-35. He died in Texas defending the
Alamo in 1836.
   Ms. Bland said Crockett's record of public service often becomes
lost in the folklore surrounding him, but the frontiersman is
partly to blame.
   ``He liked to hunt, and he liked to talk about it,'' Ms. Bland
said. ``He only shot big bears.''
   Walt Disney Studios recently announced plans for a new
television series about Crockett. In the '50s, the orignal Disney
series starring Fess Parker had every kid in America wanting to
dress in coonskin.
   ``I really hope they will try to teach the public something
about the man that he was,'' said Ms. Bland. ``If children have
heroes today, it ought to be someone like him.''

   The largest house on Long Island
has been sold for $22 million, or a bargain $170,000 for each of
its 130 rooms, a newspaper reported Thursday.
   Developer Gary Melius sold the Otto Kahn Mansion two weeks ago
to an unidentified Japanese businessman, according to Newsday.
   Melius confirmed the sale but told Newsday he had signed a
non-disclosure clause. The newspaper said it learned the selling
price from a source close to the deal.
   Melius, who bought the house in 1984 for $1.5 million and spent
millions more restoring it, said he was selling it at the request
of his wife, dropping plans to turn it into condos, a tennis club
or health spa.
   ``It was too much money and too much time,'' he said. ``It was
consuming us.''
   The mansion, built on 443 acres overlooking Cold Spring Harbor,
was dubbed Oheka by its first owner, Otto Herman Kahn. It was
second largest house in the nation at the time of construction.
   The home was sold in 1938 to the New York City Sanitation
Department as a weekend retreat for employees. It was a government
training center during World War II and later was a private
military academy.
   Melius' original asking price was $52 million with complete
renovations. He estimated that there was still $8 million to $15
million worth of restoration work still to be done.

   An intentionally flawed space shuttle
booster rocket performed successfully Thursday in the last
test-firing required before the resumption of manned U.S. space
flights, officials said.
   ``We're ready to go launch,'' Alan McDonald, Morton Thiokol vice
president for engineering, said on examining the booster after the
122-second, horizontal test.
   The $20 million firing was a ``redundancy verification test'' to
make sure the booster's new joints do what they're supposed to:
contain super-heated gases during launch. The failure of the seals
on one joint led to the explosion of shuttle Challenger and the
death of its seven-person crew in 1986.
   Engineers deemed the test a success after preliminary inspection
of the prone rocket. If that evaluation holds, and National
Aeronautics and Space Administration workers are able to plug a
tiny fuel leak in the shuttle Discovery, the space agency will be
able to set a firm date in late September or early October for the
first shuttle launch in 32 months.
   The fifth full-scale test of Morton Thiokol's redesigned booster
sent clouds of dust billowing thousands of feet in the air as some
300 NASA and company observers cheered.
   ``Fantastic! It looked really good. This is it,'' said John
Thirkill, vice president of space operations for Morton Thiokol.
   ``We have had no indication of any anomaly,'' said Royce
Mitchell, solid rocket motor project manager at the Marshall Space
Center in Huntsville, Ala. ``It looks like just an absolutely great
test from top to bottom. ... The end of September is still within
our sights.''
   Morton Thiokol and NASA engineers planned to begin tearing down
the motor Monday and expected final test results within two weeks,
said company spokesman Rocky Raab.
   McDonald said preliminary indications were that every safety
feature intended to prevent leakage had worked and there was no
immediate evidence of problems in any of the four flawed joints. He
said he believed the joints were the safest parts of the shuttle
launch vehicle.
   ``The hardware and the data will tell us this booster is ready
to fly,'' Mitchell said.
   With the $470 million redesign and motor testing, Morton Thiokol
has run five or six times the number of tests that were done prior
to the first shuttle launch, and in half the time, he said.
   David Ewing, the company's deputy director of program
management, called the redesign result ``very, very robust. We've
put on the belt and suspenders and we've even added garters.''
   The test firing at Morton Thiokol's test bay 25 miles west of
here capped the company's 2{-year effort to revamp the rocket
blamed for the January 1986 explosion that destroyed Challenger,
killed its seven-member crew and grounded the nation's space
program.
   Scores of improvements have been made to the 126-foot-long
booster, most related to reworking the field joints which hold
together the rocket's cylindrical segments.
   The Challenger explosion was blamed on a faulty joint that
allowed a plume of super-hot gas to burn through an O-ring seal and
ignite the main liquid fuel tank.
   For Thursday's booster test, two of the three field joints, the
case-to-nozzle joint and the igniter-to-case joint were riddled
with 14 flaws intended to test them to their limits as the rocket
burned 1.1 million pounds of propellant. The third joint was left
unflawed as a comparison.
   ``We're demonstrating that the motor is so fault-tolerant that
even with flaws that deliberately circumvent all the safety factors
that we've built in, it's still a safe motor,'' Raab said.
   Among the defects were separations in the bonded adhesive
insulation that helps hold the joints together, and channels cut
with an Exacto razor knife that would allow the fiery gas to reach
the joint's middle O-ring, one of three designed to contain heat
from the burning fuel.
   The joints were equipped with heaters that maintain their
temperatures at a minimum 75 degrees Fahrenheit. Freezing
temperatures the night before the doomed Challenger launch were
found to have contributed to the joint's failure.
   With the exception of the flaws, the rocket is virtually
identical to a production-quality version Morton Thiokol test-fired
June 14 and to the pair now attached to Discovery.
   The June 14 test, said Raab, was an ``unequivocal'' success, as
were the three that preceded it in the past year. Thursday's test
had been scheduled last month, but was delayed when a worker
over-pressurized a joint, causing slight damage that since has been
repaired.

<HEAD>Robertson Defends Quayle's Military Service</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former presidential candidate Pat Robertson
on Thursday said controversy swirling around Republican vice
presidential pick Dan Quayle's military service is
``reprehensible.''
   ``I think we've got to give him a break,'' Robertson said. ``He
served six years in a branch of service and it was honorable
service.''
   Robertson's comments came as he toured state delegations from
Iowa and Minnesota, and was questioned by reporters about the
Quayle controversy.
   Quayle is being dogged by reports that influential family
members interceded on his behalf to obtain a slot in the National
Guard in 1969, during an era when the guard was frequently used as
a method of avoiding the draft and service in Vietnam.
   Robertson is no stranger to controversy over military service.
   California Rep. Paul McCloskey, who served with Robertson during
the Korean War alleged that Robertson's father, a U.S. senator,
used his influence to keep Robertson from being posted in a combat
zone.
   ``The National Guard is not something to be ashamed of,''
Robertson said Thursday. ``I think the National Guard is honorable.
I think the Army Reserve is honorable.''

   Republicans could lay out $1,000 for a
festive but faraway look at the national ticket on their
convention's closing day, but many opted for cheaper thrills.
   Vice President George Bush and Indiana Sen. Dan Quayle, a day
into their formal anointment as the GOP's top twosome, rode an
antique fire truck into the New Orleans Convention Center for
Thursday's big-ticket luncheon.
   ``Wasn't it thoughtful _ they gave us these little binoculars at
the door,'' said Bertha Bajorek of Metairie, La., who sat at the
most distant table from the podium in the mammoth center.
   She focused the small red magnifiers toward the wide head table,
and, ever-faithful, said it was a fine view. ``Of course, it's hard
to make out details,'' she said.
   At the next table, Nevada Rep. Barbara Vucanovich said she
didn't mind the long-distance luncheon with the candidates. ``We
can actually carry on a conversation back here without all the
noise,'' she said, gesturing to three House colleagues at her round
table. ``We're not on parade ourselves when we're this far out.''
   Sure enough, hoards of photographers converged on tables with
celebrants who looked remotely famous.
   Robed singers from Greater St. Stephen Baptist Church rocked
from a stage at one end of the exhibition hall; across the way, an
orchestra's instruments rested in readiness for a fanfare.
   The nominees and their wives rolled into the hall aboard the
Terrytown Volunteer Fire Department's restored 1927 Ahrens-Fox
truck, which worked blazes in New Orleans for 41 years. ``We've
been polishing it for days,'' said Dan Dauterive, its regular
driver, who temporarily lost his job to a Secret Service agent.
   About 4,000 people consumed beef tenderloin and sliced chicken
breast with tarragon during the luncheon, which was aimed at
raising $4 million in one lick.
   Less-extravagant delegates explored the French Quarter, a dozen
blocks from the convention center but light-years from hometown
ways. ``That Bush-Quayle luncheon, that's not quite our economic
bracket,'' said David Barkhausen, an Illinois delegate. Shucking
pinstripes for walking shorts, he paid a hot dog vendor $1 for a
soda, then headed down Bourbon Street.
   ``It's been difficult to get down here during the convention.
It's been an exhausting week,'' Barkhausen said. ``Besides, there
have been a lot of free diversions.''
   And that has bartenders and restaurant employees peeved.
   ``We've lost business,'' said Bobby Moore, a bartender at a tiny
saloon. The bar and an adjacent restaurant have laid off four
workers and closed an upstairs dining room since last weekend
because of sluggish business, he said.
   ``Oh, they've spent a little. But you can only make so much from
Perrier and Coca-Cola,'' Moore said.
   Catherine Clement, a New York delegate, said she headed to the
French Quarter for the first time on Thursday. ``I've spent a few
dollars,'' she said, ``but I haven't had time to spend a lot.''
   J. Garfield DeMarco, a New Jersey delegate, balanced himself
against a wrought-iron fence as fast-talking Emanuel Gaines
smoothed polish on his black shoes. The shine cost $5. But Gaines
plays a game with customers: ``I'll shine your shoes for $5, but
it'll be free if I can't guess where you got them,'' he sings.
``But if I guess where you got 'em, that's double the price _ and
maybe a tip.''
   DeMarco didn't bite. What's the answer? ``You got them on your
feet!'' Gaines exclaimed.
   ``I'm going to have to recruit you to help raise money for the
party,'' DeMarco told Gaines.

<HEAD>Diseases Spread, One Cholera Death</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sewage networks have burst and contaminated
water in Khartoum, the capital of Sudan, and up to a million people
are threatened with deadly disease in the aftermath of devastating
floods, a Cairo daily said Friday.
   Government authorities and international relief agencies in
Sudan were reported to have stepped up efforts Thursday to fight
more than 5,000 cases of disease caught by drinking unclean water.
   The Egyptian state-run newspaper al-Ahram, quoting unspecified
sources, said in its early Friday edition that one person had died
of cholera in Omdurman, across the Nile River from Khartoum.
   Egyptian television said in a Thursday evening newscast that the
Sudanese Red Crescent reported 5,211 people as suffering from
severe diarrhea, 70 percent of them young children.
   The television said Sudanese health authorites and international
agencies identified the cases as typhoid, malaria and cholera and
increased their efforts to treat them.
   The Red Crescent is the equivalent in Moslem countries to the
Red Cross.
   Dr. Nicholas Ward, a World Health Organization adviser,
predicted earlier that 400,000 people, most of them under five
years of age, would develop diarrhea and gastro-intestinal
diseases, and 4,000 of them probably would die.
   Left untreated, as many as 40,000 people could perish, Ward
predicted.
   Ward, a diarrheal diseases and immunization specialist, went to
Sudan from his base in North Yemen to help coordinate the
government's response to the crisis resulting from the floods.
   He said the government recruited 300 doctors and medical
students for about 120 emergency clinics and increased staff at 127
existing health units.
   The price of water soared to 10 times its previous level since
the floods. Those unable to pay have had to drink from huge,
brackish pools left behind by the rainstorms and contaminated by
human waste from broken sewer pipes and swamped pit latrines.
   Torrential rains Aug. 4-5 left more than 1.5 people homeless. In
Khartoum alone, 70 people died, 213 were injured and nearly 115,000
houses were destroyed. Another 21 people perished in accidents
caused by the floods, bringing the known death toll to 91.
   International relief poured in from the United States, Europe
and Arab countries. But Osman Omar, Sudan's minister of public
works, was quoted by Egypt's state-run Middle East News Agency
quoted as saying Thursday that the amounts flown in met only 5
percent of needs.
   Distribution of relief supplies, handled by the government, has
been slow. Many affected areas in central, eastern and northern
Sudan were isolated.
   Officials previously denied accusations that the government was
witholding relief from some of those affected, and compared the aid
to a ``drop in the ocean.''
   Omar stressed that any foreign relief would continue to be
chaneled through the government. ``The government is capable of
bearing its responsibilities without any outside advice or
intervention,'' MENA quoted him as saying.
   Besides flood relief scenes, Egyptian TV also showed swarms of
locusts covering the sky in western Sudan, a potential threat to
any remaining crops if the locusts flew on to central Sudan.

   The United States' syphilis rate last year was as
bad as any since 1950, prompting federal health officials to call
Thursday for more emphasis on interviewing patients with venereal
diseases and warning their sex partners.
   Final statistics for 1987 show 35,241 cases of syphilis reported
in the United States _ 14.6 per 100,000 people, equaling the 1982
rate as the highest since 1950's rate of 16.7, the national Centers
for Disease Control reported.
   Reported U.S. cases of syphilis have risen 30 percent in two
years, from 27,143 or 11.5 per 100,000 in 1985, the CDC said. The
number of cases in 1986 was not included in the report but was
estimated at 28,500.
   ``The increase ... was greatest for blacks and Hispanics _
groups for which incidence rates were already high,'' the
Atlanta-based agency said in its weekly report.
   Between 1986 and 1987, among Americans 15-64, the syphilis rate
for black males rose 36 percent, from 106 per 100,000 people to
145; the rate for black females shot up 43 percent, from 56 per
100,000 to 79.
   The rate for Hispanic males rose 7 percent, from 66 to 71 cases
per 100,000, while the rate for Hispanic women rose 24 percent,
from 18 to 22.
   In contrast, the rate for white males dropped from 6.4 to 5.7
cases per 100,000 _ apparently due to a drop in syphilis among
homosexual men _ and the rate for white females rose, but still at
small levels, from 2.2 to 2.6, the CDC said.
   Previously reported drops in the sexually transmitted disease
rates among homosexual men indicate ``changes in sexual behavior''
due to the spread of AIDS, the CDC said.
   ``The increases in incidence of syphilis ... suggest that
efforts to achieve similar behavioral changes in minority
populations have not been successful,'' the agency said.
   ``Homosexual men ... have taken `safe sex' messages seriously,''
said Dr. Joel Greenspan, a CDC specialist in sexually transmitted
diseases. ``They have changed their behavior. Minority people, and
particularly heterosexuals, have not gotten that message.''
   The increase in syphilis appears to be concentrated in a few
urban areas; 57 percent of all U.S. cases last year were reported
in Florida, California and New York.
   In its report, the CDC suggested several steps to curb the
increase in syphilis, including a move to ``re-emphasize the
traditional methods of syphilis control _ interviews and sex
partner notification.''
   The agency also suggested screening for sexually transmitted
diseases in high-risk populations, assuring better access to
medical care with speedy service and evening hours, and further
surveillance efforts to monitor the problem.

   George Bush formally launched his quest for
the White House Thursday night, depicting himself as the underdog
in the race against Michael Dukakis and pledging to ``run hard, to
fight hard, to stand on the issues.
   ``And I mean to win,'' he told the Republican National
Convention.
   Bush crafted his prime-time acceptance speech as his high
command sought to quell a controversy over running mate Dan
Quayle's Vietnam-era stint in the National Guard. ``I'm proud to
have Dan Quayle at my side,'' said Bush.
   The script for the convention's final session called for
Quayle's nomination, followed by the 41-year-old senator's
acceptance speech, followed by Bush's turn at the Superdome podium
_ followed by one more spectacular blizzard of balloons.
   He began his prepared speech with a self-deprecating promise,
saying, ``I'll try to keep my charisma in check.'' And the son of a
wealthy and influential Connecticut family fashioned himself an
everyman, talking of his days living in a ``little shotgun house''
in Texas, where he ``lived the dream _ high school football on
Friday night, Little League, neighborhood barbeque.''
   ``I am a quiet man,'' he said. He said he wouldn't attack
Dukakis by name, but that didn't stop him from going after his
rival.
   ``...My opponent won't rule out raising taxes, But I will,''
Bush said in a speech that assailed Dukakis' policies without
mentioning the Democratic nominee by name.
   ``Congress will push me to raise taxes, and I'll say no, and
they'll push and I'll say no, and they'll push again. And all I can
say to them is no new taxes, period.''
   Bush's wife Barbara preceded her husband to the convention
podium, continuing a Bush emphasis on family to match Dukakis' in
Atlanta last month. She praised her partner of 43 years as a ``man
who is as strong and caring and decent as America herself.''
   Vice presidential aides passed the word that there would be no
news conference about Quayle and questions over whether strings
were pulled two decades ago to ease his way into the Indiana
National Guard and avoid almost certain service in Vietnam.
   Campaign chairman James A. Baker III previously promised a
``full disclosure,'' and said, ``We are continuing to explore it''
with Quayle.
   Dukakis campaigned in Miami, where he sidestepped questions
about Quayle, but said he was proud to have served in the Army in
Korea.
   GOP convention week polls charted a dwindling Democratic lead in
the fall campaign as Bush addressed the delegates and a TV audience
of millions.
   ``I'm the one'' who favors the death penalty in certain drug
cases, he said. ``I'm the one'' who opposes giving as weekend
furlough to a first degree murderer.''
   An ebullient Bush spent his day making the rounds of the
convention city, introducing his wife Barbara to one audience as
``sweetie pie.'' The party raised $4 million at a fundraiser at
which the ticketmates lashed out against Democratic ``failed
liberal.''
   In his prepared remarks, Bush said America was at peace and
prosperous after ``two great terms'' under Ronald Reagan. Now a
change in leadership will be made, he said, adding, ``When you have
to change horses in midstream, doesn't it make sense to switch to
the one who who's going the same way?''
   Bush sought to turn Dukakis' Democratic convention rhetoric back
on him. Dukakis said the election wasn't about ideology, but about
competence, and Bush saw an opening.
   ``Well it's nice of them to want to play on our field,'' he
said. ``But this election isn't only about competence, for
competence is a narrow ideal. Competence makes the trains run on
time, but doesn't know where they're going. Competence is the creed
of the technocrat who makes sure the gears mesh but doesn't for a
second understand the magic of the machine.''
   Said Bush:
   ``Two parties this year ask for your support. Both will speak of
growth and peace. But only one has proved it can deliver. Two
parties this year ask for your trust, but only one has earned it.''
   The vice president said the night marked the beginning of his
campaign.
   ``I mean to run hard, to fight hard, to stand on the issues, and
I mean to win.''

<TEXT>
   Newspaper requests for immediate,
unrestricted access to documents relating to the FBI search of
Unisys Corp. offices as part of the Pentagon procurement probe have
been denied by a federal judge.
   U.S. District Judge Diana Murphy on Wednesday denied the request
by the Star Tribune and St. Paul Pioneer Press Dispatch to see
search warrants and supporting FBI affidavits about the FBI
searches.
   The FBI obtained warrants in mid-June to search offices in three
Unisys buildings in Eagan as part of the nationwide investigation
into alleged defense contractor fraud.
   The newspapers' requests to unseal the information were turned
down earlier by U.S. Magistrate J. Earl Cudd. His decision then was
appealed to Murphy.
   Murphy did order unsealed small portions of the documents,
mostly information the U.S. attorney's office said it did not mind
unveiling. That included the names of FBI agents Joseph Glover and
Phyllis Sciacca, whose affidavits provided reasons for the warrants
and the exact locations searched.
   Murphy also opened parts that provide information identical to
what already has been unsealed in a similar Dallas case. The
information is expected to be made available Friday.
   Remaining under seal are details of what led the FBI to search
the Minnesota offices, what information the government was looking
for and any potential targets of prosecution. Cudd's original order
sealing that information until Sept. 14 remains in effect.
   The newspapers argued that much information about the
investigation already has become public and that potential targets
of the probe already know about it.
   The U.S. attorney's office, however, said information specific
to the Minnesota searches has yet to be known publicly and that
disclosure could prompt targets to destroy documents and otherwise
avoid scrutiny.
   The FBI conducted dozens of searches throughout the nation in
mid-June, seeking information about alleged bribery of defense
officials by defense consultants and the use by defense companies
of improperly obtained contract information.

   George Bush at long last claimed the
Republican presidential nomination Thursday, and portrayed the
election as a choice between ``two very different ideas of the
future'' _ America as ``a rising nation'' or one in decline.
   In remarks prepared for delivery to the closing session of the
Republican National Convention, Bush described himself as the
underdog determined ``to run hard, to fight hard, to stand on the
issues.''
   The vice president cited campaign themes of his Democratic
opponent, Michael Dukakis, and tried to turn them to his advantage.
   ``Some say this isn't an election about ideology, it's an
election about competence,'' said Bush, a reference to Dukakis'
speech accepting the Democratic presidential nomination.
   ``But this election isn't only about competence, for competence
is a narrow idea,'' said the Republican nominee. ``Competence makes
the trains run on time but doesn't know where they're going.''
   On jobs, he said, ``Someone better take a `message to Michael:'
tell him we've been creating good jobs at good wages.'' The need to
create good jobs at good wages, is a favorite Dukakis campaign
theme.
   Bush conceded that ``I may not be the most eloquent ... I may
sometimes be a little awkward, but there's nothing self-conscious
in my love of country. I am a quiet man _ but I hear the quiet
people others don't. The ones who raise the family, pay the taxes,
meet the mortgage.
   ``I hear them and I am moved, and their concerns are mine.''
   He praised his running mate, Sen. Dan Quayle of Indiana, under
fire over his National Guard service at a time when many draftees
were being sent to Vietnam.
   He called Quayle ``a young leader who has become a forceful in
preparing America's workers for the labor force of the future. ...
I'm proud to have Dan Quayle at my side.''
   Paying tribute to President Reagan, Bush said he spent the last
7{ years helping ``a president conduct the most difficult job on
earth.
   ``Ronald Reagan asked for, and received, my candor. He never
asked for, but he did receive, my loyalty.''
   But the time had come, he said when ``you must see me as I am:
the Republican candidate for president of the United States.''
   He said the election was between ``not only two very different
men but two very different ideas of the future.''
   ``My opponent's view of the world sees a long slow decline for
our country, an inevitable fall mandated by impersonal historical
forces.
   ``But America is not in decline. America is a rising nation.''
   He said he and Dukakis have contrasting views on such questions
as whether the Pledge of Allegiance should be required in the
schools, on school prayer, the death penalty, gun control, abortion
and taxes.
   Bush vowed to ``do whatever it takes to make the sure the
disabled are included in the mainstream.''
   He pledged to stop ocean dumping and said, ``Our beaches should
not be garbage dumps and our harbors should not be cesspools.''
Bush said he would order the FBI to find out who was responsible
for the recent dumping of medical waste that washed up on beaches
in New York and new Jersey.
   He repeated his call for tougher ethical standards, saying
``there are those who have dropped their standards along the way,
as if ethics were too heavy and slowed their rise to the top.'' He
made no direct reference to the Reagan administration officials
accused of ethical violations.
   Earlier in the day, Bush appeared at a tribute to his wife,
Barbara, and said that he was told ``you've got to be a little more
demonstrative'' after seeing Michael Dukakis and his wife, Kitty,
openly display their affection toward each other at the Democratic
convention in July.
   Recently, Bush has often said that he is not given to public
displays of affection or emotion.
   ``Here we go,'' he said, looking at his wife who was seated to
his right, ``the introduction with feeling.
   ``Come on up, sweetie pie.''
   With that, Mrs. Bush stepped forward and they hugged.
   ``Thank you very, very much ... sweetie,'' he said.
   Then she told the audience, ``I hope you don't take your eyes
off him and see if he looks at me adoringly.''
   Later, she said, ``Nobody ever had a better husband.''

<TEXT>
   Television ratings for the Republican
National Convention dropped again Wednesday night, and ABC easily
outdistanced its two rivals for the largest share of the dwindling
audience.
   The A.C. Nielsen Co. reported that ABC had an average rating of
8.7 on the night Vice President George Bush secured the party's
presidential nomination. NBC and CBS tied with ratings of 6.7.
   The three-network total of 16.7 was down from 19.9 on Monday and
17.6 on Tuesday. By contrast, the third night of the Democratic
National Convention drew a cumulative rating of 22.1.
   Each rating point represents 866,000 homes with television.
   For the first three nights of the GOP convention, the three

   Winning a $20 million lottery brings a sense of
freedom, 12 industrial workers are learning.
   Fred Bird, 40, of Painesville, one of the winning workers at
Kennametal Inc. in Solon, said he was no longer interested in
winning the prizes the company gives to workers who are on time
every day for a year.
   ``Now they can give their toasters to somebody else,'' he said.
   Bird and his 11 co-workers each contributed $2 for 24 chances at
the prize. One of their plays, selected randomly by the lottery's
computer, turned up the winning combination Wednesday: 12, 17, 25,
26, 32 and 36.
   The prize will be paid out over 20 years, with each winner's
annual share amounting to $66,666.67 after taxes.
   ``I figured sooner or later we'd get it,'' said Matt Goodlin,
48, of Mentor, who bought the winning ticket.
   Members of the group over the years had spent several thousand
dollars to buy lottery tickets, Goodlin said. They bet $700 in
January on a record $32 million ``Super Lotto'' drawing.
   Goodlin and some of the others in his group went to work
Thursday morning to announce their triumph.
   ``They already knew by the time we got there. Somebody told
them. Most of them were very happy,'' Goodlin said.
   Robert Repas, 34, of Maple Heights, said he joined the ``Super
Lotto'' group just five weeks ago. Repas, whose wife had a baby
three days ago, said his share of the winnings would help with new
family expenses.
   Jimmy Robins, 49, of Willoughby, said that as soon as the
winning numbers were announced, he knew the group had won.
   ``I called Matt, then Matt started calling. That started the
whole chain reaction, and by the time it was over with, everybody
was up half the night,'' Robins said.
   Except for Kenneth Stephens, 48, of Chardon, the co-workers said
they plan to keep their jobs, which pay from 25,000 to $28,000 a
year. Stephens said he was considering resigning from Kennametal.
   ``I've got some money now,'' he said.

   Activists plugged waste outlets at a
state-run plant Thursday, a news report said, and a 14-nation
conference called for a war on the pollution environmentalists
blame for killing thousands of seals.
   A report in the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet said the death toll
among harbor seals off Sweden's west coast had reached more than
5,000, or 75 percent of the area's harbor seal population.
   Seals in other regional waters have also died. An estimated
total of 7,000 harbor seals have died since April, about half the
population in the North Sea waters of West Germany, the
Netherlands, Norway, Denmark and Sweden.
   Divers from Greenpeace, an international environmental group,
plugged the pipeline dumping chemical waste from the NCB wood pulp
plant in Vallvik, 140 miles north of Stockholm, the national news
agency TT reported.
   They stopped up 28 of 30 outlets on the pipeline in about an
hour, but abandoned their operation after talks with company
officials. The company's production manager promised the protesters
he would take up their complaints with the board of directors, TT
reported.
   Other activists climbed the plant's 300-foot chimney with a
banner reading ``Beautiful Promises, Dead Seas'' to slam the
government's failure to curb discharges at the plant, the news
agency said.
   Greenpeace said the factory washed about 7,900 gallons per
minute of waste containing toxic chlorine into the Baltic Sea.
   Activists from the group also stood vigil outside the prime
minister's office where the conference was held, demonstrating with
six black-painted oil barrels representing a total of 858 metric
tons of toxic heavy metals which they say are discharged into the
Baltic and North seas per day. A metric ton is equivalent to 2,205
pounds or 1.1 short tons.
   Meanwhile, the emergency international meeting of government
scentific advisers and members of ministries called Thursday for
more resources and research to rescue the North and Baltic seas
from what they described as the threat of death by pollution.
   The one-day conference concluded that future action should zero
in on the most serious pollutants in one of the world's most
heavily populated industrial areas, but no list of priorities was
drawn up.
   Opening the meeting, Swedish Prime Minister Ingvar Carlsson
announced the creation of a government-funded International
Institute for Environmentally Sound Technology.
   Carlsson initiated the meeting with letters last month to 13
heads of government following the discovery of a mysterious viral
epidemic devastating seal herds. Environmentalists and others were
also worried about a bloom of poisonous algae choking tons of North
Sea fish to death.
   Environmentalists maintain the seal-killing virus, which reduces
immunity and leads to pneumonia, was caused by pollution. But
scientists have failed to pinpoint the origins of the disease.
   Environment Minister Brigitta Dahl told a concluding news
conference that Britain and the East bloc countries at the meeting
_ the Soviet Union, Poland and East Germany _ showed no
reservations about tightening pollution controls. They had been
criticized in the past as the worst offenders.

   The state College Board on Thursday
approved a two-year lease for a black fraternity to move into a
vacant building on the all-white fraternity row at the University
of Mississippi.
   The 20-member black fraternity, Phi Beta Sigma, had been
restoring a building along the same street, but the structure was
torched by arsonists Aug. 4.
   The lease agreement will allow the black fraternity to move into
the building that once housed the Phi Kappa Theta fraternity.
   ``We think that hopefully, by the first of October, the Phi Beta
Sigmas will be in there,'' Ole Miss Chancellor Gerald Turner said
of the renovation project.
   Renovation of the Phi Kappa Theta house is expected to cost
$15,000 to $20,000, all paid for by private funds, officials said.

   The effectiveness of last winter's influenza
vaccine may have been reduced by a mid-season drift in the
predominant flu virus, federal health researchers concluded in a
report on the 1987-88 season.
   Health officials reported late last year that the predominant
strain of flu, A-H3N2 _ one of the three major flu types _ appeared
to be ``drifting,'' or changing into a somewhat different form.
   ``Because these variations were not recognized until the fall of
1987, the ... influenza vaccine (which contains vaccine against all
three major types) could not be modified to include the new
variant,'' the national Centers for Disease Control said Thursday
in its weekly report.
   ``As a result, the efficacy of the vaccine, at least in certain
high-risk persons, may have been reduced,'' the agency concluded.
   CDC officials earlier this spring said the recommended 1988-89
flu vaccine should contain a new formula to better protect against
the new A-H3N2 strain, known as the Sichuan flu.

   Three recent outbreaks of food poisoning in the
Northeast apparently were caused by Salmonella bacteria in Grade A
eggs, federal health officials said Thursday.
   The Centers for Disease Control reported outbreaks of
gastro-intestinal illness among:
   _at least 88 students in May at a Fort Monmouth, N.J., prep
school, where ice cream made with raw eggs was served;
   _at least 47 people in a training session held in June at an
Asbury Park, N.J., hotel, where scrambled eggs were served;
   _at least 12 restaurant patrons at a May brunch at a Livonia,
N.Y., restaurant, where omelets were served.
   The CDC, as is its custom, did not identify the specific
locations involved. The outbreaks were caused by Salmonella
enteritidis, a common Salmonella bacteria, researchers reported.
   Investigations found no improper food handling, the CDC said.

<HEAD>Gunmen Kill Catholic Worker in Northern Ireland</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two masked gunmen killed a
Roman Catholic worker renovating a house Thursday, police reported,
and British soldiers defused a letter bomb sent to a leading
Protestant politician.
   The gunmen walked into a house Belfast and fired at close range,
striking 32-year-old Michael Laverty in the head and chest, a
police spokesman said. No group claimed responsibility.
   Laverty, a surveyor, was renovating the house, the spokesman
said, on condition of anonymity in keeping with official policy.
The slain man was from Stewartstown, County Tyrone, about 50 miles
west of Belfast, police said.
   On Wednesday, two gunmen entered a grocery store in a Protestant
enclave in west Belfast and killed the 44-year-old owner, Frederick
Otley.
   The Irish Republican Brigade, previously unknown in the British
province's secretarian warfare, claimed responsibility.
   In 1985, an informer accused Otley of terrorist crimes on behalf
of the Protestant paramilitary Ulster Volunteer Force. He was
charged with a bombing meant to kill a force member during an
internal feud, but the charges were dropped when the informer
recanted.
   The Irish Republican Army has been fighting to drive the British
from the Protestant-dominated province and unite it with the
overwhelmingly Catholic Irish Republic. Militant Protestant groups
also attack Catholics. The parcel bomb was sent to Ken Maginnis,
the Official Unionist Party's security spokesman who represents
Northern Ireland in the British Parliament.
   A similar packet sent two weeks ago to the Rev. William McCrea,
another member of Parliament from Northern Ireland, also was
defused.
   Maginnis said he called the bomb disposal squad after the
package arrived at his home in Dungannon, County Tyrone, 40 miles
west of Belfast.
   ``For some reason I felt uncomfortable,'' he said. ``I saw
something attached to the parcel _ I am not saying what _ and I
called the anti-terrorist officers.
   ``People in political and public life have got to realize the
terrorists are prepared to kill not only them, but also members of
their families.''
   Police said the parcel, about the size of a cigar box, contained
commercial explosives.

<HEAD>Honorary Degree for Quayle From Alma Mater Was Initially Opposed</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A 1982 dispute about an honorary degree for
Sen. Dan Quayle was rooted in faculty members' dislike of Quayle's
conservative politics, the former president of DePauw University
said Thursday.
   ``There was real strong sentiment about Quayle because he was a
conservative Republican,'' Richard F. Rosser said. ``I didn't care
if he was a Democrat or Republican. At that time, at his age, he
was holding the highest public position of any DePauw alumnus.''
   On Thursday night, Quayle was unopposed for the Republican vice
presidential nomination.
   Faculty members initially rejected Rosser's request to give
Quayle, a 1969 graduate of the small liberal arts college in
Greencastle, Ind., an honorary doctor of laws at the 1982 spring
commencement, where he was the featured speaker.
   The faculty later relented and approved the degree.
   Faculty members argued against the honorary degree by claiming
Quayle, then 35, was too young and had unimpressive public service
and academic records, DePauw professor O. Ralph Raymond said in an
interview Wednesday.
   ``It wasn't that his career was undistinguished, it was just
that it was such a short career,'' said Raymond, a specialist on
Soviet affairs, who opposed the degree award.
   ``Certainly there were some people quite bothered by the fact
that we were honoring a person whose intellectual achievements were
unimpressive. We like to see students achieve a little bit more
than he did.''
   Rosser, now president of the National Association of Independent
Colleges and Universities in Washington, D.C., conceded Thursday
that Quayle ``was no Phi Beta Kappa. He was not a distinguished
student.''
   DePauw has refused to provide Quayle's college records.
   However, Rosser said Quayle's academic performance shouldn't
have been an issue after his graduation. Quayle was being
recognized for public service, Rosser said.
   The degree spat was followed by another embarrassment for Quayle
when the two student radio reporters who broke the story were
fired. Their student boss said they had reported on what Rossner
said was an off-the-record meeting.
   Quayle, who once worked as a reporter at his father's newspaper,
wrote to the university to urge the reporters' reinstatement,
saying the firings ``could have a chilling effect on freedom of the
press.'' DePauw was the birthplace of the Society of Profession
Journalists, Sigma Delta Chi.
   The students did not get their jobs back, Raymond said.

   Israel banned local committees that carry out
leadership orders in the Palestinian uprising, and reports Thursday
said soldiers beat more than 250 Arabs during four days of unrest
in the occupied Gaza Strip.
   Palestinians began a two-day general strike in the West Bank to
protest Israel's policy of deporting those it considers activists
in the 8-month-old rebellion. Masked youths passed word of the
strike, some shouting through loudspeakers.
   A three-day curfew was lifted from much of the Gaza Strip before
dawn Thursday, but 180,000 Arabs in 11 refugee camps and
neighborhoods still were confined. About 85,000 West Bank
Palestinians from nine villages and camps were under curfew.
   Israel radio said soldiers wounded six Palestinians in the
occupied West Bank _ four in the Amari refugee camp and two
teen-agers in Tamun village. Hospital officials said five
Palestinians were wounded in Gaza's camps, including a 14-year-old
boy.
   Army spokesmen confirmed the Tamun shootings and said the
Palestinians attacked an army patrol with knives.
   An Amnesty International report said soldiers had beaten
thousands of Palestinians in the past eight months. The Foreign
Ministry said it was checking the allegations, but claimed that the
London-based human rights group consulted biased sources.
   At least 247 Palestinians have been killed since the rebellion
began last Dec. 8 among the 1.5 million Palestinians of the West
Bank and Gaza, which Israel captured from Jordan and Egypt in the
1967 Middle East war. Four Israelis have died.
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin said outlawing the committees
would create legal means of ``dealing with the activists'' of the
uprising.
   The Defense Ministry said every Palestinian who serves on or
assists the ``popular committees'' will be arrested and tried.
Israel radio said punishment for conviction would be 10 years in
prison.
   Popular committees carry out directives of the uprising's
underground leadership, organizing demonstrations and patrols, and
supplying food and medical aid to needy Palestinians.
   The government accused the committees of organizing violence and
of being connected to outlawed Palestinian guerrilla groups,
including factions of the Palestine Liberation Organization.
   ``The committees have a double aim: to impose by violent means
the orders of the PLO and the uprising's leaders on the population
and to undermine the Israeli authorities ... and to create
alternative mechanisms instead,'' the Defense Ministry said.
   The move followed deportation orders issued Wednesday against 25
Gaza Strip and West Bank Arabs, mostly members of the popular
committees.
   ``Outlawing the committees would create legal means of dealing
with their activists and, of course, their leaders,'' Rabin told
Israel radio Thursday.
   Rabin said 200 to 300 popular committees members were in jail
without trial and estimated several hundreds more are still free.
   Police arrested a 17-year-old Israeli suspected of setting the
fire near Tel Aviv earlier this month that killed three Arab
workers from Gaza, Israel army radio said. Violent Gaza riots last
week were said to have been inflamed by news of the burning deaths.
The unrest resulted in the three-day curfew.
   Red Cross and hospital officials in Gaza said about 270
Palestinians were treated for beating injuries since the curfew
began Sunday night, including 17 treated Thursday.
   Of those, about 40 Arabs suffered fractured bones and most of
the rest suffered bruises and contusions, said an official at Gaza
City's Shifa Hospital, where most of the injured were treated. The
official said most of the injuries came during overnight
house-to-house searches.
   Israeli military officials said they did not keep exact figures,
but estimated the number of beating victims in the last four days
at about 135.
   ``Most were curfew violators who suffered only light injuries,''
one official said. ``The beatings were a result of a tremendous
effort we made not to endanger lives.''
   The hospital, Red Cross and military officials spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   One victim, Fathi Jamil, 40, said from his hospital bed at Shifa
that soldiers chasing Palestinian protesters in Jabaliya refugee
camp beat him up inside his home Wednesday. He showed a reporter
bruises the size of oranges on his right arm and left leg and two
cigarette burns on his chest.
   Another patient, Ahmed Mahmoud Salameh of Gaza City, said he was
hit by rubber bullets after soldiers entered his home and dragged
out his 15-year-old son. Salameh, 47, said he ran outdoors to stop
the troops. His right eye was bandaged, and hospital officials said
he lost it when he was struck by a rubber bullet.
   The Arabic-language daily Al Quds quoted sources as saying the
PLO was preparing to recognize Israel and would announce a
government-in-exile headed by Mahmoud Abbas, a top aide to PLO
chief Yasser Arafat. Abbas headed a delegation that visited Jordan
last week.
   This month, Israeli officials seized a Palestinian ``declaration
of independence'' from an east Jerusalem office that called for an
independent Palestinian state.

   When Dan Quayle enlisted in the National Guard
in 1969, the United States was faring poorly in Vietnam, volunteers
for active military service were in short supply and the nation's
college campuses were awash in protest.
   And short of becoming a draft dodger, the Guard looked pretty
safe _ if you could get in.
   During the war, the United States sent 3.4 million servicemen
and women to Southeast Asia; only about 9,000 were in mobilized
Army and Air National Guard units. By the time the fighting ended,
there would be more than 58,000 American casualties; 97 would be
Guardsmen in those mobilized units.
   In 1969, 3.46 million men and women were on active duty in the
armed forces and to maintain that strength, the Selective Service
had to draft 283,586 individuals. By contrast, 389,000 individuals
were in the Army National Guard in 1969 and most of those units
weren't expanding.
   ``Waiting lists to get into the Guard became a reality
nationwide during the Vietnam War, but it happened at different
times in different locations,'' said Maj. David Super, a Pentagon
spokesman and specialist on Guard and reserve issues.
   ``Some units in some states were hard to get into; others
weren't,'' Super said.
   ``The National Guard was a legal alternative to the draft and
many chose to pursue it,'' said Dan Donohue, the chief spokesman
for the National Guard Bureau at the Pentagon.
   Quayle, the Republican vice presidential candidate, has said he
decided to join the Guard in 1969 so he could attend law school. He
has dismissed questions about whether he was trying to avoid combat
in Vietnam as a ``cheap shot.''
   ``I was willing and ready to serve my country,'' Quayle said.
``I chose to serve my country in the National Guard like millions
of other people.''
   Accoding to reports Thursday, Quayle received a high-level
endorsement that eased his entry into the Guard, but it's unclear
whether he needed the help.
   John S. Anderson, a Democrat and adjutant general of the Indiana
National Guard until 1969, said the Guard service had a waiting
list. John Owens, a Republican and successor to Anderson, said
Indiana ``had vacancies galore'' in his units.
   Whether Quayle needed help or not, Retired Maj. Gen. Wendell C.
Phillippi _ who was managing editor of The Indianapolis News and
worked for Quayle's grandfather, Eugene C. Pulliam _ said he
contacted his ``multitude'' of friends within the guard when Quayle
applied, the News reported.
   ``I was asked about Dan Quayle's abilities and capabilities, and
I recommended him very highly ... as I did with many other men,''
Phillippi told the News. Later, Phillippi said he made only one
call on Quayle's behalf.
   Ironically, Quayle could have attended law school without
worrying about Vietnam or the Guard. Six months after Quayle
enlisted, Congress approved a draft lottery system and in December
1969, Quayle received a number high enough _ 210 _ to push him
outside the induction zone.
   Quayle was 22 in 1969 when he graduated from college and lost
his college deferment from the draft. He enlisted in the Guard in
Indiana as a private on May 16, 1969, and was trained first as a
welder, then a clerk-typist and later as an information specialist
with the 120th Public Affairs Detachment of the Indiana Guard.
   He received an honorable discharge on May 18, 1975.
   At the time of Quayle's enlistment, as is the case now, National
Guard units were subject to mobilization. But the policy of the
Johnson and Nixon administrations was to rely on active-duty forces
to fight the war.
   The only exceptions occurred in 1968, shortly after the seizure
of the U.S. spy ship Pueblo. Four tactical fighter squadrons from
the Air National Guard were mobilized in January and then in May,
20 Army National Guard units were called up, including an Army
Ranger company from the Indiana Guard.
   Only a portion of the mobilized units were sent to Vietnam, and
all were demobilized by the end of 1969.
   Dan Howard, the Pentagon's chief spokesman, said Thursday the
Guard didn't ``look like too safe a place to me,'' because those
who were sent to Vietnam saw combat and ``won 55 Silver Stars, 681
Purple Hearts, one Distinguished Flying Cross, 16 Distinguished
Service Medals, six Legions of Merit and over 1,000 Bronze Stars.''
   ``I can't speak to the motives of any individual who volunteers
for the Guard, who volunteers for active duty or whatever,'' Howard
said. ``I'm simply pointing out that the National Guard served very
honorably in Vietnam.''

   The White House announced Thursday
it will tell the General Accounting Office that it cannot provide
information GAO is seeking involving possible illegal activities by
Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega of Panama.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater added that the
administration ``will respond ... in an appropriate manner'' if the
GAO ``reformulates its request in a manner consistent with its
stautory authority and the legal principles involved.''
   Fitzwater said the White House acted on the advice of the
Justice Department.
   The GAO, acting on a request by Sen. John F. Kerry, D-Mass., and
Rep. Bill Alexander, D-Ark., is making a study of ways that
information about drug trafficking by foreign officials influences
decisions by the United States on foreign policy.
   Noriega has been indicted on drug trafficking charges by two
federal grand juries in Florida. The United States has sought, in
vain so far, to have him removed from power in Panama.
   ``The General Accounting Office's request for information on
Gen. Noriega asks for a broad range of sensitive intelligence
material, information from open law enforcement files, and material
reflecting the deliberative decision-making process of the
executive branch,'' the White House spokesman said.
   He said administration officials had met with the GAO in an
effort to narrow the request, but the GAO declined to do so.
   The White House informed the congressional watchdog agency on
July 13 ``that we would need to complete a legal review of the
issues raised by their request before responding,'' Fitzwater said.
   ``The Justice Department has just completed that review and has
concluded that the subject matter of the request is beyond GAO's
statutory authority,'' he said.
   Fitzwater said that ``consistent with the legal advice we have
now received from the Justice Department, we will be informing GAO
that we cannot participate in the study as currently designed.''
   ``The administration is prepared to meet with GAO to discuss the
legal issues involved,'' he said. ``Moreover, if GAO reformulates
its request in a manner consistent with its statutory authority and
the legal principles involved, we will respond to any such new
request in an appropriate manner.''
   In Miami, Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis
accused the administration of ``stonewalling'' the General
Accounting Office probe, which potentially could delve into
Republican nominee George Bush's knowledge about the Noriega case.
Administration officials argued they needed time to ``review'' the
GAO's requests for information.
   ``I think the White House does not want to cooperate because
they are embarrassed by this. They should be embarrassed by this,''
Dukakis said.
   Nancy R. Kingsbury, who is directing the study by the GAO,
Congress' investigative agency, said the administration's total
lack of cooperation is unusual. Past GAO-executive branch disputes
focused on specific documents, she noted.
   The order not to cooperate, until further notice, came from
Nicholas Rostow, special assistant to the president and legal
adviser at the National Security Council, according to Ms.
Kingsbury and an administration official, insisting on anonymity.
   The White House order apparently will apply through most if not
all of the presidential campaign, in which questions have been
raised about Vice President Bush's knowledge of Noriega's alleged
drug trafficking.
   Bush has played a central role in the administration's overall
anti-drug effort, but has denied having early knowledge or
suppressing evidence about any Noriega ties to the drug world.
Noriega for years provided intelligence information to the CIA,
which Bush once headed.
   The GAO is seeking information from the departments of defense,
state, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the CIA, the Justice
Department and the National Security Council.
   ``All executive branch agencies have been instructed by the
White House not to take any action on your request until various
legal issues have been analyzed by the administration,'' State
Department Comptroller Roger B. Feldman write Ms. Kingsbury earlier
this month. Feldman said that Rostow is ``acting as the
administration's point of contact on this matter.''
   Rostow's office said he was not available to comment.
   In a letter made public by Alexander, Rostow wrote Ms.
Kingsbury: ``your request seeks access to sensitive law enforcement
and intelligence files covering a substantial period of time.
   ``The request raises important statutory and constitutional
issues. The administration is analyzing them now, and when its
deliberation is complete, I shall reply further.''
   The administration official in California said the GAO may
eventually get some, all, or none of the information it seeks. ``We
have said we are going to review this and until we do the review,
we are not going to turn anything over,'' he said.
   Ms. Kingsbury said the Noriega study is part of a larger
inquiry, to examine how information about drug trafficking by
foreign officials affects U.S. foreign policy decisions.
   ``We didn't anticipate'' the trouble with the administration,
said Ms. Kingsbury, who is GAO associate director for foreign
economic assistance programs.
   If the stalemate isn't resolved, she said, the GAO can issue a
``demand letter'' for the information and go to court in an attempt
to enforce it.
   She acknowledged the administration has ``wiggle room in areas
like foreign intelligence gathering and law enforcement.''

   It is 1969, Danny Quayle is graduating from
college and at 22 years old he is facing the shared dilemma of his
generation: what to do about Vietnam. He's lucky, he has options.
Nineteen years later, his decision casts a shadow on the Republican
National Convention.
   The Bush campaign wanted a baby boomer, they got one, and he
carries the baggage of his generation. This is not World War II
we're talking about, this is the Vietnam War and millions of kids
were trying to avoid it.
   In Quayle's case, he is wrestling with the image of a rich kid
who chose law school over Vietnam and traded on his family
influence to make his dreams come true.
   Stripped of the veneer of 1988 presidential politics, it comes
down to this from John DeCamp of Nebraska, a Vietnam veteran and
former state senator who is among 2,277 delegates voting on
Quayle's vice presidential nomination:
   ``Back there in the 60s you had boys with money and influence
who didn't want to go to Vietnam finding a way to get into the
National Guard.
   ``And then you had other boys without so much money, and some of
them didn't want to go to Vietnam, but they volunteered or got
drafted and they went and some of them like me got shot at a lot
and a great many of them just plain got shot and killed.''
   Some 153,300 wounded, 58,153 killed.
   ``Let's face it, the question is whether a rich kid's family got
him into the Guard when other people were getting drafted,'' DeCamp
said.
   That's one question, anyway.
   Quayle is being dogged by several.
   Most important for him is to explain why, given the opportunity
and even the inevitability of serving in the armed forces in
Vietnam, he chose to pursue a National Guard appointment instead.
   On top of that, he hails from the immensely wealthy and
influential Pulliam family, and revelations that a prominent
Pulliam employee interceded with the Guard on Quayle's behalf
raises the ``silver spoon'' imagery that the Republicans prefer to
avoid.
   Thirdly, Quayle presents himself as extremely tough on national
defense issues and is eager to provide a contrast to Democrats who
he criticizes as not tough enough. That won't be easy if he is
forced to defend his military record.
   In 1969, Quayle wanted to go to law school after graduating from
DePauw University. But he was losing his student deferment from the
draft and the war was at a peak. Without some sort of intervention,
Quayle would surely be drafted and probably sent to Vietnam.
   So the grandson of publisher Eugene Pulliam went to talk to a
former Indiana National Guard commander who worked as managing
editor of a newspaper, the Indianapolis News, owned by his family.
He got in the guard and he went to law school.
   The same year, 283,586 young men were drafted into the armed
services. Thousands more volunteered.
   Yet, even among defense-minded Republican activists, everything
is relative.
   ``The thing that's important is he didn't go to Canada,'' said
George W. Bush, the nominee's eldest son. ``Remember, in 1968,
Canada was an option. He didn't go.
   ``Let's keep it in generational perspective.''
   Indeed, Quayle was nothing special for his generation in 1969.
Vietnam was not a popular war and it took a non-stop draft to keep
up the military.
   ``If he got in the National Guard to dodge the Vietnam War, that
may be an issue with some Vietnam veterans, I don't know,'' said
GOP delegate Noble Cody of Cookeville, Tenn. ``But I'll tell you
one thing: If I had a son that age and knowing what I do now about
that war, I'd do everything I could to keep him out of it.''
   From Oregon delegation chairman T.J. Bailey: ``I am a Vietnam
veteran ... and I truly do not resent Dan Quayle for not having
gone. It is a way a number of my lifelong friends opted. We have to
examine the sanity and wisdom of people who resent him for not
being shot at.''
   Jerry Prevo, chairman of the Alaska delegation, said, ``I guess
the question still remains,'' if he didn't join the Guard, ``would
he have been drafted? I think a lot of people who had the potential
of getting out of going to Vietnam used that potential, that
connection, in those years.
   ``That was 20 years ago. People make mistakes when they're
young. If we held up everything we did as young people none of us
would be considered worthy of doing something for our country.''
   ``Baby boomers will understand, but the older generation may
hold it against him,'' said Samuel Atkins, a Watkinsville, Ga.,
attorney and Pat Robertson supporter. ``I see it as a bruise, but
not something that will injure the man permanently.''

   The younger brother of Afghanistan's
Soviet-backed leader has defected to the United States with his
family and is being accepted as a refugee, Reagan administration
officials disclosed Thursday.
   The Afghan ruler, Najibullah, and his brother, Saddiq, were said
to have been at odds for some time. Saddiq was under death threat
and was protected for several months by an anti-government faction
that then spirited him out of Afghanistan to Pakistan, said the
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The two brothers go by single names. Najibullah also goes by the
name Najib.
   Saddiq, 37, his wife, Soraya, and their two young sons reached
the United States on Wednesday from Frankfurt, West Germany, and
have been given sanctuary, the official said.
   ``He was accepted in this country as a refugee,'' the official
told The Associated Press. ``No special deals were made, but the
processing was expedited. Elaborate security precautions have been
taken.''
   Saddiq, who was described as an intellectual, apparently joined
the forces of Ahmed Shah Massoud, the rebel field commander who has
led the fight against Afghan troops and Soviet forces in the
strategic Panjshir valley.
   He also was believed to have joined the Jamiat-i-Islami party,
one of the largest opposition groups.
   Some years ago, a U.S. official said, Saddiq served as
Afghanistan's banking representative in Hamburg, West Germany. He
broke with his brother, and claimed he was kidnapped and forced
back to Afghanistan, said the official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   ``It certainly doesn't do anything for the image of the leader
of Afghanistan for his brother, who had a privileged position, to
defect,'' the official said.
   Earlier Thursday, the State Department, expressing satisfaction
with the pace of the Soviet troop pullout from Afghanistan, urged
Moscow to withdraw all remaining soldiers by year's end _ six weeks
before the deadline set by the Geneva accord.
   ``We see no reason why the Soviets cannot meet their
often-stated goal of completing the withdrawal by the end of 1988 _
nine years to the month from their invasion,'' the department said
in a statement.
   ``The Soviet withdrawal is indispensable to the ability of the
Afghan people to determine their own future and of the Afghan
refugees to return home in safety and honor,'' it said.
   The Geneva accords signed last April call for completing the
Soviet army's pullout by Feb. 15. Half the troops were to have been
removed by last Monday, a deadline the State Department said the
Soviets met.
   ``The vast majority of Afghanistan is now free of Soviet
troops,'' the statement said. ``Soviet combat units remain deployed
in only two corridors in northern Afghanistan. The bulk of Soviet
troops remaining in that country are in the Kabul area and along
the road heading north from Kabul to Termez, the Soviet border
town.''
   On Wednesday, after Pakistani President Mohammed Zia ul-Haq died
in an air crash, U.S. and Soviet diplomats held an unannounced
meeting in Washington. Zia had played a leading role in arranging
the Afghan troop withdrawal.
   A U.S. official, who spoke only on condition that he not be
identified, said the Soviets assured the Americans that the
withdrawal would not be affected by Zia's death.
   Millions of Afghan refugees are in Pakistan. The State
Department on Monday accused the Soviets and the Afghan army of
leaving 10 million to 30 million mines deployed, making the
refugees' return difficult.
   The Soviets denied the allegation on Tuesday. There was no
mention of the mines in the statement, which was read by department
spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley.
   She said U.S. military assistance to the rebels would be
continued and that the Soviets had not stopped helping the Afghan
army.
   ``I am not prepared to get into the question of the degrees or
if they slowed down,'' Mrs. Oakley said. ``What we are saying is
they have not stopped. Therefore our assistance will continue.''
   The Soviets had an estimated 115,000 troops in Afghanistan
before the pullout began. The statement did not give precise
figures. It said the Soviets had withdrawn roughly half their
combat units and an unspecified number of supply units.
   ``The Soviet Union has evacuated all of its forces from roughly
two-thirds of the major garrisons at which troops were deployed
three months ago,'' the statement said.

<HEAD>Heat Relief In Upper Midwest; Records Fall In Carolinas</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A cold front stretching from the central Plains to the
mid-Atlantic Coast states brought heat relief Thursday to the Great
Lakes and mid-Mississippi Valley, but records continued to fall in
the lower Ohio Valley and the Carolinas.
   The high of 105 in Raleigh, N.C., tied the all-time high in more
than a century of record-keeping set on July 23, 1952. Greensboro,
N.C., also tied its all-time high with a 102 reading.
   Records for the date were set or tied in Cape Hatteras, N.C.,
93; Charlotte, N.C. 100; Greer, S.C., 101; Lynchburg, Va., 98;
Louisville, Ky., 99; and Roanoke, Va., 96. Earlier in the week,
records were falling across a far wider area stretching as far west
as Minnesota and Iowa.
   Rain finally ended in southern Michigan, where strong
thunderstorms had produced severe weather. Some of the rainfall
totals Wednesday and Thursday topped the 2-inch mark.
   At Lansing, the rainfall for the month of August now totals 4.05
inches, almost twice as much as fell in the months of May, June and
July combined.
   In central Wisconsin, storms brought more than an inch of
rainfall at Coon Valley, and nearly an inch near La Crosse.
Lightning strikes were blamed for power outages in the area. A
thunderstorm watch was posted for parts of northern and central
Illinois.
   In New Jersey, residents cleaned up Thursday from violent storms
that felled trees, knocked down a 30 foot-high circus tent and
disrupted power to more than 90,000 customers.
   The storms Wednesday spawned a tornado with winds up to 140 mph
that left a path of destruction four miles long and a quarter-mile
wide in Trenton. The twister moved cars a dozen feet, ripped up
roofs and toppled trees.
   A 28-year-old migrant worker was struck by lightning as he
worked in a pepper field and remained hospitalized in critical
condition Thursday. In Lavallette, 14 people suffered minor
injuries when the circus tent came down in high winds.
   Thunderstorms also produced brief, heavy rains along the Gulf
Coast region, with Galveston, Texas, getting more than one-third
inch of rain in only 15 minutes.
   Heavier rainfall during the six hours ending at 2 p.m. EDT
included 1.95 inches at New Orleans, La.; 0.94 inch at Corpus
Christi, Texas; 0.80 inch at Sioux City, Iowa; 0.65 inch at Wausau,
Wis.; and 0.57 inch at McAllen, Texas.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 62
degrees at Caribou, Maine, to 106 degrees at Needles, Calif. The
early-morning low for the nation was 31 degrees at Truckee, Calif.
   The forecast for Friday called for scattered showers and
thunderstorms along a weakening cold front extending from western
Kansas across the southern Ohio Valley to the mid-Atlantic Coast
states; and storms also in parts of Oklahoma, Texas, the Gulf Coast
region, the northern Plains and southern Plateau.
   Higs in the 70s were forecast along the Pacific Coast and
Washington state, and in the northern Mississippi Valley, the Great
Lakes and much of New England; between 95 and 100 in central Texas,
Oklahoma, Mississippi, the Tennessee Valley and South Carolina;
between 100 and 110 in the desert Southwest and the valleys of
California; and in the 80s and 90s in most of the rest of the
nation.

<TEXT>
   Two men held captive by Colombian rebels for 10
months said Thursday they tended gardens, played chess and picked
the banjo with their captors, but still longed for their freedom.
   Jason McLachan, 21, and Stephan Koneman, 22, met with reporters
at a hotel near O'Hare International Airport for a morning news
conference. They were reunited with their families Wednesday night.
   ``The hardest part was waiting to be freed,'' said McLachan.
``For us, it's something that happened in our lives and we're glad
it's over.''
   The two men, both geography majors, were canoeing down the
Amazon River last fall when they were captured by members of a
leftist rebel group who believed them to be CIA agents, said Elmer
Koneman, Stephan's father. The two were taken captive Oct. 4.
   McLachan said the rebels _ men and women of varying ages _ never
mistreated them, but kept them isolated at different camps in the
Amazon jungle. The rebels carried handguns and kept their captives
under constant supervision.
   ``A lot of people had been saying we disappeared,'' McLachan
said. ``For us, it was everyone else who disappeared.''
   The rebels, members of the Colombian Revolutionary Armed Forces,
held the two until Sunday, Koneman said.
   Their release was announced earlier this week.
   McLachan said their captors ``wanted to know what these two
gringos were doing down there.'' After talking with the rebels, the
students convinced them they were not political agents.
   ``My Spanish is now `muy bien,''' he said. ``But without Steve,
it (captivity) would have been more difficult.''
   Koneman, recalling the rebels' camp in the jungle, said there
was no way to determine whether the guerillas had attacked anyone
or were selling drugs.
   ``Probably the two of us were the most bizarre thing there,'' he
said, referring to their white skins.
   Koneman and McLachan said they were in good health, and had
never feared for their lives.
   ``It never got tense that way,'' McLachan said.
   But after 10 months of a diet that included alligators, toucans
and piranha fish, the two agreed that a homecoming hamburger was in
order.
   Koneman's father said earlier the families had all but given up
hope.
   ``We basically went through a period where for so long we felt
that all was lost,'' he said Wednesday. ``It's a marvelous
resurrection.''
   ``It wasn't until I saw him on television yesterday that I
really thought, `My God, this guy is coming home,''' he said.
   A Roman Catholic bishop negotiated with the rebels for four or
five months before gaining the young men's release.

   The spokesman for the Vietnam Veterans of
America said Thursday that National Guard service was regarded as
``cushy duty'' to avoid the draft and that questions about Dan
Quayle's military service were relevant.
   Mike Leaveck, director of public relations for the Vietnam
Veterans of America, said his organization has received several
dozen calls from members ``upset'' about revelations about Quayle's
National Guard record.
   But at least one Medal of Honor winner from the Vietnam War said
criticism of Quayle and the National Guard is ``a bum rap.''
   ``Four of my very close friends in the National Guard were
killed in Vietnam,'' said George ``Bud'' Day, a retired Air Force
colonel and former prisoner of war from Fort Walton Beach, Fla.
   ``These guys that went to the Guard were very good guys. They
got in there and served their country,'' said Day, who headed
Veterans for Reagan in 1984. ``I applaud this guy. If that's the
worst thing they can dig up on this guy, they should make him
president.''
   Leaveck, in a telephone interview from the group's Washington
headquarters, said ``Questions about what did you do during the
Vietnam War, we think, are very relevant for anyone in public life,
particularly of our generation.''
   
   
   ``A lot of people served in the National Guard during those
years, a lot of them served in the National Guard in order to avoid
military service in Vietnam. That's a well known, accepted fact. We
can't comment on what his motivations may have been. ... A lot of
people went into the National Guard because they liked it.''
   But, he added, ``actually the National Guard was considered
cushy duty. ... We've had a lot of calls from our members who are
upset.''
   However, a spokesman for the American Legion said he was
concerned that the impression will be conveyed that National Guard
service is ``somehow dishonorable.'' John Minnick, Legion spokesman
in Washington, said the Guard was important for national defense
and also in domestic emergencies.
   But Minnick said Quayle's military service was ``a legitimate
issue.''
   Leaveck described Quayle as ``non-supportive'' of his group's
position on veterans issues. He said in particular Quayle opposed
continuation of veterans' counseling center program, opposed
compensation for diseases related to Agent Orange exposure, and has
not supported legislation allowing court review of Veterans
Administration benefit decisions, which the VVA backs but some
other veterans groups oppose.
   The VVA has 35,000 memers, is congressionally chartered and
composed entirely of Vietnam veterans.
   The American Legion, the largest veterans group with nearly 3
million members, including 800,000 Vietnam veterans. It is based in
Indianapolis, Ind., Quayle's home state. Minnick said service in
the Guard was not sufficient to qualify for membership in the
American Legion, and that Quayle is not eligible, while Bush and
Democrat Michael Dukakis are.

   A laughing Donald Trump accused New York Post
publisher Peter Kalikow on Thursday of beating up on him in the
newspaper, persuading Trump to buy advertising while his reporters
write unflattering stories.
   ``You son of a gun, you're killing me,'' Trump said at a
breakfast at the Republican National Convention. ``Rupert, come
back!''
   Trump was called to the microphone by Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, who
was being honored by the New York GOP delegation. Kalikow, who
bought the financially ailing paper in March from publisher Rupert
Murdoch, was sitting nearby.
   When Trump launched into a comical monologue about the Post,
aiming his comments at Kalikow, he sounded half-serious. Kalikow
laughed but looked uncomfortable.
   Post editor Jane Amsterdam said Trump had not tried to
strong-arm the Post into going easier on him.
   ``I don't think the Post can be muscled,'' she said from New
York City. ``He's entitled to react to the New York Post any way he
wants to. The Post is fair and it's tough and it's generally very
good. ... And he's a big boy.''

   George Bush used the most important speech of
his life Thursday night to portray himself to the American people
as a man who may ``sometimes be a little awkward,'' who is
reserved, but who nevertheless can lead a nation.
   ``What it all comes down to, after all the shouting and the
cheers, is the man at the desk and who should sit at the desk,''
said Bush.
   ``My friends, I am that man.''
   Accepting his party's nomination for president, Bush defined his
vision for the job, but also sought to expose the inner man. By
doing so, he indirectly attacked the images attached to him.
   The image of Bush, the boring speaker:
   ``I may not be the most eloquent, but I learned early that
eloquence won't draw oil from the ground. I may sometimes be a
little awkward, but there's nothing self-conscious in my love of
country.
   ``I am a quiet man but I hear the quiet people others don't.''
   The wimp image:
   ``My life has been lived in the shadow of war _ I almost lost my
life in one. I hate war. I love peace. We have peace. And I am not
going to let anyone take it away from us.''
   The rich-kid image _ evoked at the Democratic convention by
keynote speaker Ann Richards, of Bush's being ``born with a silver
foot in his mouth.''
   ``My parents were prosperous; their children were lucky,'' Bush
said. ``But there were lessons we had to learn about life.'' He
learned them, he said, by moving to Texas where he ``lived in a
little shotgun house, one room for the three of us. Worked in the
oil business, started my own...''
   Bush said certain traditions guide him.
   ``One is that there is a God and He is good, and His love, while
free, has a self imposed cost: We must be good to one another,''
Bush said.
   And he said:
   ``I believe public service is honorable. Every time I hear that
someone has breached the public trust, it breaks my heart ...
   ``I want a kinder, gentler nation ...
   ``I say it without boast or bravado; I've fought for my country,
I've served, I've built ...I will keep America moving forward,
always forward... That is my mission. And I will complete it.''

   Democrat Lloyd Bentsen pressed his vice
presidential campaign among conservative oil-country businessmen
and then to Jesse Jackson supporters Thursday, and he refused to
criticize Republican counterpart Dan Quayle's service in the
National Guard during the Vietnam war.
   ``I'm not going to question that,'' said Bentsen, a World War II
bomber pilot. ``I'm a strong supporter of the National Guard and
always have been. One of my own sons served in the National Guard.''
   Bentsen passed up the chance to criticize Quayle over reports
that George Bush's vice presidential running mate sought to enter
the Indiana National Guard in 1969 and avoid being drafted for
active duty in Vietnam.
   Instead, the senator and former Houston businessman sought to
explain to his East Texas audiences about his dual candidacies _ as
Michael Dukakis' running mate and for re-election to the Senate. He
reassured them he would remain committed to advancing their
business interests if he is elected vice president on the ticket
with Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis.
   In a speech before the East Texas Regional Development Group in
Longview, Bentsen said he rejected the ``old shibboleths'' about
the vice presidency being an unimportant job. ``Now the vice
president is in the loop,'' he said.
   Bentsen shook hands as he strolled down the main street of the
oil city of Kilgore, starting at Larry Tate's stripper well and
ending up at ``The World's Richest Acre,'' where there were once 24
wells that produced more than 2.5 million barrels of crude oil in
the 1930s through the 1950s.
   City Manager Ron Cox said there once were 1,200 wells in Kilgore
but now there were only about 200.
   Standing in the moist East Texas heat, Bentsen told local oilmen
of his work to repeal the windfall profits tax, which will be
accomplished if President Reagan signs trade legislation approved
recently by Congress.
   ``I understand very much the kind of predicament we're in here
in East Texas,'' said Bentsen, chairman of the Senate Finance
Committee.
   Ronnie Patton, owner of the Patton Corp., a supplier of drilling
rigs and equipment, said his business was bad.
   ``The phones are dead. There ain't anybody calling,'' he said.
   Rusty Howell of Marshall Exploration told Bentsen he hoped the
trade bill would result in ``jobs and money, dollars'' for East
Texas.
   ``So whenever you're up there in the White House, just remember,
stick some of that money down here to us,'' he said.
   Howell told reporters afterward that he had ``mixed emotions''
about Bentsen leaving the Senate if he's elected vice president.
   ``I'm definitely going to vote for Lloyd for senator,'' he said.
``In all probability, I will vote for him for (vice) president.''
   At the end of the day, Bentsen held a closed-door meeting with
the other end of the Democratic party spectrum _ a group of Jesse
Jackson's supporters in Dallas.
   Juggling his two campaigns, Bentsen selected public events for
vice presidential bid and met privately with Senate supporters.
   The senator's staff said his entire nine-day swing through Texas
was a vice-presidential trip, but Senate campaign buttons and signs
were everywhere and Dukakis' name was scarce.
   After dinner and breakfast with supporters of his Senate
campaign in nearby Tyler, Bentsen said he had explained why he
teamed up with Dukakis, a Massachusetts liberal, just as Lyndon B.
Johnson ran with John F. Kennedy in 1960 while simultaneously
running for re-election to the Senate.
   ``I'm visiting with them as to why I went on the ticket, and
that I felt in this election we were playing for all the marbles,''
he said.
   Quitting the Senate campaign would automatically give a six-year
term to his opponent, Rep. Beau Boulter, R-Texas.
   ``I'm sure they'd like that. But we're not going to do that,''
he said. ``I certainly expect to (win),'' he said. ``Lyndon Johnson
did.''
   Bentsen's fellow senator from Texas, Republican Phil Gramm, who
placed Bush's name in nomination for the presidency at the GOP
convention in New Orleans, said Thursday he thought Republicans
could win the White House without Texas' 29 electoral votes.
   Asked if he was surprised at Gramm's concession that the GOP
might lose Texas in the November elections, Bentsen smiled and
said: ``I think he's made a very good forecast.''

   Police set off flash grenades on a
crowded highway and opened fire Thursday, capturing two bank
robbers who took more than 30 hostages in two days of gun battles
and international chases that left three people dead.
   A woman hostage was killed in the final shootout that also
seriously wounded the gunmen and a second woman hostage, and
slightly injured a female accomplice. A 15-year-old hostage and a
policeman were killed Wednesday, one day after the bandits robbed a
bank in a small northwestern town and commandeered a bus carrying
30 passengers.
   At least three other people were injured in the two-day ordeal,
in which the pistol-waving bandits met with pursuing journalists
several times, letting reporters inside the captive bus in Bremen
and holding a roadside news conference in Cologne.
   The bandits, Hans-Juergen Roesner, 31, and Dieter Degowski, 32,
had traded the bus and all but two hostages for a BMW sedan after
they crossed over into the Netherlands.
   Officers stopped the sedan on a crowded autobahn at 1:45 p.m. by
setting off exploding devices that emit a powerful flash of light,
said police spokesman Horst Fechner.
   A police vehicle from a special tactical unit rammed the back of
the getaway car, and the two sides started shooting, said Juergen
Hosse, president of Cologne's police department.
   ``The criminals opened fire, and we shot back,'' Hosse said,
adding that police don't know who fired the bullet that killed the
woman hostage.
   The other hostage received ``life-threatening injuries,'' said
Fechner, a police spokesman in the northwestern German city of
Recklinghausen where a special command post was set up to
coordinate police strategy. He refused to identify the wounded
hostage.
   Later Thursday, police spokesman, Harald Treutinger said the
wounded woman's condition had improved.
   Police refused to say where they had taken the gunmen and their
woman accomplice. Treutinger said an investigation had begun but no
charges had been brought.
   Authorities said the inquiry could lead to charges of murder,
hostage-taking and other crimes with a maximum penalty of life in
prison for the two gunmen. It was unclear what charges the woman
could face.
   The ordeal began Tuesday, when the gunmen took two hostages
during a bank robbery in Gladbeck, 50 miles north of Cologne. After
daylong negotiations, they fled in a car provided by authorities.
They carried with them about $227,000, of which $162,000 was
provided by police to ensure the hostages' safety.
   They surfaced Wednesday in Bremen, 135 miles northwest of
Gladbeck, where police said they opened fire in a vegetable market.
No one was injured.
   Joined by a female accomplice, the bandits commandeered a city
bus and drove away with about 30 hostages.
   Four elderly passengers, a child and the two original hostages
were freed, and the bus careened along the autobahn for several
hours late Wednesday and early Thursday.
   Hermann Wahl, another Recklinghausen police spokesman, said an
officer died in a crash pursuing the gunmen, and the robbers shot
to death a 15-year-old Italian boy aboard the bus Wednesday.
   Wahl said the boy, who was not identified, was killed after
police grabbed the robbers' accomplice. Officials identified her
only as ``Marion Irma L.''
   She later was allowed to rejoin the gunmen, and the bus crossed
the border into the Netherlands near the Dutch town of Oldenzaal
early Thursday.
   The gunmen demanded a high-powered BMW as an escape vehicle and
threatened to shoot hostages, and police provided the car.
   The robbers shot and wounded two captives, then freed all but
two female hostages, said Dutch police spokesman Jan Houdel. The
condition of the wounded captives was not known.
   A shootout ensued, and the female accomplice was shot in the
leg. The gunmen, their wounded companion and two women hostages
then sped back to West Germany.
   After speeding through the Ruhr industrial area, the car stopped
in the center of Cologne on Thursday morning and was immediately
surrounded by journalists.
   ``We aren't going to negotiate with police any more, because we
know that leads to nothing,'' said Degowski. ``I want to say
through the news media that the police should back off.''
   He sat in the back seat of the BMW, pointing a pistol at a woman
hostage squeezed in beside him.
   The woman said she felt ``good'' and added, ``I was afraid
before, because I thought the police might move in and I'd be
killed.'' It was not immediately known if she was the hostage who
later was killed.
   Roesner sat at the steering wheel and criticized the police. He
occasionally waved his pistol at the reporters.
   The robbers ordered a Cologne journalist to get into the car as
a third hostage. They released him before they sped into the trap
set up outside Bonn by the special police commando unit.
   Herbert Schnoor, interior minister of North Rhine-Westphalia
state, criticized the news media and said the interviews with the
bandits endangered the hostages.
   ``At no point did the police have the help of the media in the
attempt to protect the hostages,'' said Schnoor, whose state
includes Gladbeck.
   But a poll taken by the respected Wickert Institute in Tuebingen
said 93 percent of the respondents could not understand why police
did not act sooner to end the ordeal. Eighty-nine percent of the
the 1,708 West Germans questioned said the top state politicians
responsible for law and order should resign.

<HEAD>Fundamentalists Challege Requirement To Have Numbers For Children</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of Christian fundamentalists Thursday
challenged the requirement that children age 5 and older must have
Social Security numbers to be claimed as exemptions on their
parents' tax returns.
   A lawsuit by 137 parents filed in U.S. District Court contends
that the requirement of the 1986 Tax Reform Act violates their
religious beliefs and is an invasion of privacy.
   ``The ability to invade the privacy of American citizens in this
age of computers is far more likely with this mandatory universal
numbering system than with either universal drug testing or
fingerprinting,'' said the complaint.
   The law requires that parents place the Social Security numbers
of children age 5 and older on tax returns to claim each child as a
dependent.
   Attorney Michael P. Farris said most of the parents are
born-again Christians, many of whom believe that the requirement
contracts with Christ's teaching to ``render under to Caesar that
which is Caesar's and render to God that which is God's,'' he said.
   ``They believe that God ordained parents as the ones who are to
be responsible for children rather than the government,'' Farris
said. ``Taxes belong to Caesar but children belong to God.''
   Another group believes that the Social Security number used as a
law enforcement tool is a precursor to the ``mark of the beast''
prophesied in the Bible, he said.
   According to the prophecy, the mark is a number that every
person would need to buy their soul in a world ruled by the
anti-Christ, Farris said.
   Most of the parents claimed the exemptions on their tax returns
but did not provide Social Security numbers, he said. But one
family with nine children did not claim the exemptions ``just to be
safe,'' he said.
   The Internal Revenue Service sent warnings to these parents that
the numbers would be required on their 1988 returns, said IRS
spokeswoman Ellen Murphy.
   Failure to include the number will result in a $5 penalty but
parents wouldn't automatically lose the $2,000 exemption claimed
for each child.
   Parents who don't comply in 1988 could be asked to prove their
child is a dependent.
   Congress adopted the requirement when it raised the exemption
from $1,000 to $2,000 as part of the tax-reform legislation passed
two years ago.
   ``One of the reasons why Congress changed the law was because
through the years our taxpayer compliance measuring programs had
indicated a fairly high incidence of parents who are living apart
claiming their children on both returns,'' Murphy said.
   ``With the increase in the value of the personal exemption ...
obviously the revenue impact of the non-compliance was going to be
increased,'' she said.
   Farris said a number of the plaintiffs educate their children at
home in violation of state laws that require attendance at public
schools.
   They fear that Social Security numbers could be used to
cross-check children to ensure they are attending school.
   Virginia, for instance, requires children to have Social
Security cards to attend public school, said Farris, who is a staff
attorney for the Home School Legal Defense Association in Great
Falls, Va.
   The group helps parents in the home-school movement but is not a
party to the case.
   Murphy said the IRS does not share Social Security numbers or
any other tax information with other government agencies, except
for tax enforcement.

   Here are excerpts from the prepared text of
the speech by Vice President George Bush to the Republican National
Convention on Thursday night as he accepted the party's
presidential nomination.
   ... I accept your nomination for president. I mean to run hard,
to fight hard, to stand on the issues _ and I mean to win.
   There are a lot of great stories in politics about the underdog
winning _ and this is going to be one of them.
   And we're going to win with the help of Sen. Dan Quayle of
Indiana _ a young leader who has become a forceful voice in
preparing America's workers for the labor force of the future. Born
in the middle of the century, in the middle of America, and holding
the promise of the future _ I'm proud to have Dan Quayle at my
side. ...
   ... Tonight is for big things. But I'll try to be fair to the
other side. I'll try to hold my charisma in check. ...
   ... I seek the presidency for a single purpose, a purpose that
has motivated millions of Americans across the years and the ocean
voyages. I seek the presidency to build a better America. It is
that simple _ and that big. ...
   ... Some say this isn't an election about ideology, it's an
election about competence. Well, it's nice of them to want to play
on our field. But this election isn't only about competence, for
competence is a narrow ideal.
   Competence makes the trains run on time but doesn't know where
they're going. Competence is the creed of the technocrat who makes
sure the gears mesh but doesn't for a second understand the magic
of the machine.
   The truth is, this election is about the beliefs we share, the
values we honor, the principles we hold dear. ...
   ... Things aren't perfect in this country. There are people who
haven't tasted the fruits of the expansion. I've talked to farmers
about the bills they can't pay. I've been to the factories that
feel the strain of change. I've seen the urban children who play
amidst the shattered glass and shattered lives. And there are the
homeless. ... What we must remember if we are to be responsible _
and compassionate _ is that economic growth is the key to our
endeavors. ...
   ... Look at the world on this bright August night. The spirit of
democracy is sweeping the Pacific rim. China feels the winds of
change. New democracies assert themselves in South America. One by
one the unfree places fall, not to the force of arms but to the
force of an idea: freedom works. ...
   ... The tremors in the Soviet world continue. The hard earth
there has not yet settled. Perhaps what is happening will change
our world forever. Perhaps not. A prudent skepticism is in order.
And so is hope.
   Either way, we're in an unprecedented position to change the
nature of our relationship. Not by pre-emptive concession, but by
keeping our strength. ...

<HEAD>Nuclear Weapons Ban Part of Constitution Draft</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congress has approved a ban on
production of nuclear weapons in Brazil as part of the country's
new constitution, which is expected to be finalized this year.
   The two-chamber Congress, doubling as a constituent assembly,
passed an amendment Wednesday night specifying that ``all nuclear
activity in national territory will only be allowed for peaceful
ends.''
   But it rejected a clause that also would have banned the
transportation, storage or import of atomic weapons, according to
Rep. Fabio Feldman, one of the amendment's sponsors.
   Congress has been working since February 1987 on the new
constituion, Brazil's eighth.
   Brazil announced last year it had acquired uraniun-enrichment
technology, which theoretically could give it the capability to
build an atomic bomb.
   The government repeatedly has said its nuclear energy program is
only for peaceful ends. But scientists and politicians have
expressed concern about the destination of Brazil's enriched
uranium.
   Brazil signed the Tlatelolco Treaty for non-proliferation of
nuclear weapons in Latin America, but failed to ratify it.
   The uranium is processed at a navy base in Ipero, in
southeastern Brazil, where the navy is developing a reactor to
power a nuclear submarine.
   The project was kept semi-secret during military rule here from
1964 to 1985. Its existence was officially revealed last year by
President Jose Sarney, a civilian who took office in 1985.
   Navy Minister Adm. Henrique Saboia said in an interview Thursday
with the Rio newspaper Jornal do Brasil that the ban doesn't affect
the government's nuclear program.
   ``The country already has taken on the obligation and the
political decision not to build an atomic bomb,'' he said.
   Brazil and Argentina are the only South American countries with
nuclear technology, although Argentina is more advanced.
   Brazil has one finished nuclear plant, a 626-kilowatt reactor in
Angra dos Reis, 90 miles southwest of Rio. The plant broke down
frequently after it started working in 1985 and was dubbed
``lightning bug'' because it goes on and off.
   In 1975, Brazil signed an agreement with West Germany for
construction of up to eight more nuclear plants and transfer of
technology. But only two were started, and work on them has all but
stopped because of budget cuts.

<TEXT>
   Democratic Senate candidate Bob Kerrey, who
won the Medal of Honor and lost part of a leg in the Vietnam War,
said Thursday that Dan Quayle should be honest about his military
service record.
   ``Don't drape yourself in a flag and forget what it was like to
be 20 and what it was like for your number to come up,'' Kerrey
said in a telephone interview.
   Kerrey said Quayle, a Republican U.S. Senator from Indiana and
George Bush's choice as a presidential running mate, should admit
that he wouldn't have joined the National Guard unless he was under
the threat of the draft.
   ``I wouldn't have thought of going to Canada or to jail or ask
my dad to make some calls to the draft board,'' said Kerrey. ``But
I also was not overwhelmed by patriotic verve.''
   Kerrey, 44, enlisted in the Navy, were he became a member of the
elite SEALS.
   Still, the former Nebraska governor said, ``I don't have hostile
feelings toward Dan Quayle because he got in the National Guard
instead of waiting for the draft.''
   However, if Quayle or his influential publishing family pulled
strings to keep him out of combat, ``that's a different story.''
   Quayle, a hardliner on defense, said he sought guard duty so he
could attend law school.
   Quayle was 22 in 1969, no longer deferred from the draft and
vulnerable to being conscripted and sent to Vietnam. National Guard
units were rarely activated for Vietnam duty, and many men joined
the guard to avoid the draft and likely Vietnam duty.
   Retired Maj. Gen. Wendell C. Phillippi, who worked for Quayle's
grandfather, Eugene C. Pulliam _ said Thursday that he contacted
guard acquaintances on behalf of Quayle.

<HEAD>Catalonian, ETA Separatists Claim Responsibility for Bomb Attacks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BARCELONA, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Catalonian separatists who said they
were targeting heroin dealers claimed responsibility for a bomb
attack that injured three people Thursday, officials said.
   The bomb exploded outside the Bar Maite in Barcelona's run-down
El Rabal neighborhood about 2:30 a.m. It seriously injured a
relative of the bar's owner and a passer-by, a spokesman for the
civil governor's office said. A 10-year-old girl who had been
sleeping in a back room was slightly hurt, he said.
   The Basque terrorist group ETA meanwhile claimed responsibility
for a string of bombings in northern Spain that damaged seven
French firms and ripped up tracks along a railway line Sunday.
   The spokesman for the civil governor's office said a caller
speaking on behalf of the separatist group Terra Lliure told a
local radio station the group had planted the bomb in El Rabal
because the bar had been a hangout for heroin dealers. The
spokesman demanded anonymity.
   This year, at least 100 people have died of heroin overdoses in
Spain, 25 of them in Barcelona.
   Police say the deaths are due to an abrupt increase in the
purity of the heroin. They blame international traffickers who are
offering a high-quality product to capture a wider share of the
Spanish market.
   Terra Lliure stands for Free Land in the Catalan language and
supports independence for the four-province region of Catalonia, of
which Barcelona is the capital.
   The group previously has claimed responsibility for several
attacks in Barcelona, including a March 17 explosion at the British
Consulate and a bomb blast outside the U.S. Embassy last October.
   ETA, which stands for Homeland and Liberty in the Basque
language, claimed responsibility for Sunday's bombings in a note to
the daily newspaper Egin.
   The blasts at six car dealerships and a dairy caused more than
$810,000 in damage. Police safely exploded bombs outside two other
dealerships.
   In the note, ETA repeated a January offer to negotiate an end to
its attacks, which have killed more than 600 people _ mostly
police, civil guard and military officers _ since the group took up
arms in 1968.
   The government of Socialist Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez has
said it would not begin talks with ETA unless all attacks cease.
   Next week will mark the six-month anniversary of ETA's
kidnapping of Emiliano Revilla, a businessman still being held
hostage by the Basque group.

   Both sides in a strike involving 2,000
nurses hailed a tentative agreement reached Thursday that would
provide a 20 percent wage hike over three years and boost top
annual pay for some nurses to $50,000.
   ``Overall, it's a good, solid contract and it's one of the best
contracts in the country,'' said Maureen Anderson, spokeswoman for
the California Nurses Association.
   ``We're obviously very, very pleased,'' said Karen Henry, chief
negotiator for Affiliated Hospitals, which represents the six
hospitals that were struck.
   The nine-nurse negotiating team recommended union members
approve the contract, but Anderson noted the vote was not
unanimous. A ratification vote was scheduled Friday.
   If the agreement is ratified, nurses would end the two-week-old
strike and return to work Monday at St. Francis, Children's,
Marshal Hale, St. Mary's and Mount Zion hospitals in Francisco and
Seton Medical Center in Daly City.
   Ratification by the nurses also would send about 1,700 hospital
service workers honoring the strike back to work. Striking licensed
vocational nurses, technicians, dietary and housekeeping workers
represented by Local 250 of the Hospital and Health Care Workers
Union this week approved a new contract that ended their three-week
strike.
   However, they continued to honor picket lines at the six
hospitals and at another hospital until the nurses settled their
dispute.
   Under the proposed contract, nurses would receive a 7.5 percent
increase retroactive to Aug. 1, a 6.5 percent increase in August
1989 and a 6 percent hike in August 1990. Nurses with 10 and 15
years experience would get an additional 2 percent hike.
   A full-time, nightshift nurse with five years experience would
earn $50,000 by 1990, said Anderson. A similar nurse on the
dayshift would earn $43,541 by the final year of the contract.
   ``We look forward to prompt ratification of the agreement so
that hospital operations can return to normal as soon as
possible,'' said John G. Williams, president of the Affiliated
Hospitals board of directors and chief executive officer of St.
Francis Memorial Hospital.
   All the hospitals remained open during the strike, but with some
reductions in services.
   Nurses striking a seventh hospital, French Hospital in San
Francisco, are negotiating separately.
   Local 250 first went on strike July 26 at all seven Affiliated
Hospitals in a dispute over sick leave and health benefits. On Aug.
2, registered nurses struck six of the seven hospitals over pay,
overtime, work hours and staffing improvements. Nurses at the
seventh hospital, Pacific Presbyterian, are not unionized.
   On Aug. 6, Local 250 and the CNA walked out in separate strikes
at French Hospital, which does not belong to Affiliated Hospitals.

<HEAD>Carlucci Expected To Accept Findings On Iranian Plane Downing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci was
expected to accept the finding of military investigators that human
error led the USS Vincennes to mistakenly shoot down an Iranian
airliner on July 3, Pentagon sources said Thursday.
   President Reagan earlier said the United States accepted
responsibility for the tragedy and was willing to compensate the
families of the 290 people killed in the incident, although many
members of Congress have expressed reluctance to make such payments.
   The announcement by Carlucci, expected as early as Friday, would
mark the first public acknowledgement by the Pentagon that the loss
of life was caused by U.S. servicemen rather than an equipment
failure or specific action taken by Iran.
   The report implicitly ascribes some blame for the incident on
Iran, however, by noting that since the tragedy Iran has changed
the manner in which its civilian aircraft operate over the Persian
Gulf, climbing to 25,000 feet while over land, the sources said.
   In the past, Iranian civilian aircraft, including the A-300
Airbus, reached 25,000 feet as they travelled over the gulf itself.
   The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said military
investigators found that radar operators aboard the Vincennes
misread data and mistakenly identified the airliner as hostile.
   The error stemmed from pressure on members of a crew facing
their first experience in combat, as well as confusing behavior by
the Iranian airliner, said the sources.
   The report was expected to differ with comments made on the day
of the tragedy by the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Adm.
Willam Crowe, in finding that the plane was ascending or levelling
off when it was hit and that it was in a civilian air corridor
rather than outside it, the sources said.
   ABC News said Thursday evening that the report contradicts
earlier Pentagon claims that the Airbus was putting out two
identification signals _ one civilian and the other military.
Instead, it said, the airliner's transponder was transmitting only
civilian signals and the military signals picked up by the
Vincennes came from a distant plane.
   The report was expected to be consistent with Crowe's comment
that the Vincennes mistook the A-300 Airbus for an F-14 fighter in
part because the jet took off from a joint military-civilian
airfield minutes after the Vincennes ended a surface engagement
with Iranian gunboats, the sources said.
   Some mysteries remain: why the airliner flew into a combat area
and why it ignored repeated broadcast warnings by the Vincennes.
   In earlier versions of the report, senior U.S. military
officials recommended that the servicemen responsible for the error
not be punished. It was not clear whether Carlucci would take more
drastic action, according to the Pentagon sources.
   Crowe, who passed the report up the chain of command to
Carlucci, recommended that the servicemen receive a non-punitive
letter of censure in their files, a step that might damage their
careers, the sources said.
   There was no indication that the Pentagon would formally censure
the commander of the Vincennes, Capt. Will C. Rogers III.
   The investigation was carried out by Rear Adm. William Fogarty,
then given to Gen. George Crist, the commander of U.S. forces in
the Persian Gulf, and then went to Crowe for Carlucci.
   Sources said that the report itself was about 70 pages long,
with an additional 1,000 pages of documentation gathered by Fogarty
and his team.
   The report is said to exonerate the sophisticated Aegis radar
and tracking system aboard the Vincennes, one of the most advanced
ships in the Navy.

<HEAD>GOP Chairman Assesses Quayle Controversy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Republican Party chairman Frank Fahrenkopf on
Thursday attributed the controversy over vice presidential nominee
Dan Quayle's military service to the fact that Quayle was a
``surprise'' candidate to the news media.
   ``I've never see anything like it,'' Fahrenkopf said in an
interview. ``It's almost like one reporter would talk to another
reporter and they would come and ask another question. It was like
dominoes going down among the press.
   ``It just started taking off and it had a life of its own,
saying that he was going to be removed from the ticket. That's not
the case.
   ``I was with the vice president this morning between 9 a.m. and
10 a.m.. At that time he said he was firmly in support of the
ticket and of Dan Quayle and this would all pass. And at a luncheon
he said it again. Later in the afternoon I was with him. At no time
was there any question, yet the press was running around like it
was a given fact.
   ``So it's just part of the convention process, and a part of a
candidate who was a surprise being named, and people starting to
look into his background.''

   Federal regulators announced Thursday they
will spend $1.3 billion to help a group of outside investors
acquire 12 insolvent Texas thrifts in the fourth consolidation
under a government plan aimed at recapitalizing ailing thrifts in
the Southwest.
   The Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp., which insures most
of the nation's S&Ls, said it would provide a $499 million note to
help the new company, to be known as American Federal Bank F.S.B.,
restore positive net worth. The total cost to FSLIC is expected to
reach $1.3 billion.
   The FSLIC said the 12 thrifts had combined assets of nearly $2.4
billion and liabilities of $3 billion.
   The merged institution, which will have $3.7 billion in assets,
is to have headquarters in Dallas.
   The Federal Home Loan Bank Board, regulators of the thrift
industry, said the merger was conducted in conjunction with a
subsidiary of Lone Star Technologies Inc. of Dallas, one of the
world's leading manufacturers of tubular pipe.
   The subsidiary, LSST Financial Services Corp. has agreed to
provide $48 million in the deal.
   It will work Gibson Group Inc., a private investment group
organized by William E. Gibson, executive vice president of
Continental Illinois National Bank and Trust in Chicago, and
Continental Illinois Corp.
   Gibson will be president and chief executive officer of the new
institution.
   Thursday's merger was one of the biggest deals under the
government's ``Southwest Plan,'' which is aimed at ridding the
region of money-losing thrifts.
   ``We now have consolidated 24 of the 109 Texas thrifts that were
insolvent when we started the Southwest Plan,'' said M. Danny Wall,
chairman of the bank board. ``Today's transaction shows that
private investors are willing to bring in hard cash for the
opportunity of participating in the Texas thrift recovery.''
   To accomplish the acquisition, all 12 associations were placed
in receivership, the bank board said.
   The bank board said two of the 12 Texas thrifts _ Mercury
Savings Association of Wichita Falls, and Ben Milam Savings & Loan
of Cameron _ had been in the federally assisted management
consignment program, which replace the management of ailing thrifts
with those from healthy ones.
   A third, Richardson Savings & Loan Association of Dallas, had a
$77.6 million loss in the first quarter of 1988, the 10th-worst
earnings record nationally among thrifts.
   The 12 thrifts had combined assets of nearly $2.4 billion and
liabilities of $3 billion.

   Barbara Bush used her national political
convention speech Thursday night to extol the virtues of her
husband and speak from the heart about the death of a daughter.
   Taking the podium shortly before Republican presidential nominee
George Bush was to make his acceptance speech, Mrs. Bush said,
``You've nominated for the presidency a man who is as strong and
caring and decent as America herself.''
   In remarks to the 2,277 Republican National Convention
delegates, which were received warmly, she said, `You're looking at
a woman who couldn't be happier with her life.''
   Mrs. Bush said, ``I have my causes,'' such as eliminating
illiteracy, but added that she also has ``five wonderful children,
each of whom has married an equally wonderful person, and in turn
given me 10 exquisite grandchildren.''
   She also recalled the death of their 3-year-old daughter, Robin,
to leukemia, saying it was ``the hardest thing we ever faced
together.''
   ``When she was gone, I fell apart,'' she said. ``But George
wouldn't let me retreat into my grief. He made me share it and
accept that his sorrow was as great as my own. He simply wouldn't
allow my grief to divide us and push us apart.''
   Earlier Thursday, the Bushes had a light-hearted exchange at a
brunch given for Mrs. Bush by the National Federation of Republican
Women.
   Bush quipped about criticism from some quarters that he fails to
show emotion.
   ``Here we go with an introduction with feeling, demonstrable
feeling,'' Bush said from the podium. ``Come on up, sweetie pie.''
   When Mrs. Bush joined her husband, she turned to him and
exclaimed, ``I hope you can't take your eyes off me,'' then told
the audience, ``and see if he looks at me as adoringly as I looked
at him.''

<HEAD>Court Repeals Victim's Right To Sue</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An injury victim has no right to sue the
other party's insurance company for dragging out payments, the
California Supreme Court ruled Thursday, overturning a
multimillion-dollar 1979 decision.
   The 5-2 decision bans such lawsuits in the future once the
ruling becomes final. It allows pending cases to continue, but
limits them severely by requiring proof of the wrongdoer's
liability before the insurer can be sued _ a restriction that
eliminates most cases, which are settled without an admission of
liability.
   A 1979 ruling in the Royal Globe case allowed an injury victim
to sue the other side's insurance company for violating laws
requiring claims to be handled in good faith, with claims paid
promptly once liability is clear.
   Such lawsuits often carry punitive damage awards far higher than
the insurance benefits involved. Supporters viewed the lawsuits as
a way to enforce the state's largely toothless laws regulating
insurers; opponents in the insurance industry said the lawsuits
were a form of legal intimidation and drove up insurance rates.
   Thursday's majority opinion by Chief Justice Malcolm Lucas said
the Royal Globe ruling ``has generated and will continue to produce
inequitable results, costly multiple litigation, and unnecessary
confusion unless we overrule it.''
   In dissent, Justice Stanley Mosk, the author of the Royal Globe
decision, said the court had ``replaced Royal Globe with a `Royal
Bonanza' for insurance carriers ... total immunity for unfair and
deceptive practices committed on innocent claimants.''
   The lawsuit involved Parveni Moradi-Shalal, who was hit by a car
driven by a Fireman's Fund insurance policy-holder in 1983. Her
$750,000 lawsuit said the company made no effort to settle the
policy claim for several months after being asked; it settled five
months after she sued the driver.
   The high court dismissed her lawsuit, saying it was not based on
a determination by a judge that the other driver was liable for the
accident.

<TEXT>
   Bob Dole, nominating Dan Quayle for No. 2
spot on the Republican ticket, lauded his Senate colleague Thursday
as a man ``ready and willing to make the tough choices.''
   ``Just let the Democrats try to use experience as a measuring
stick in this campaign,'' said Dole. ``Just let they try.''
   ``Whenever I needed him, Dan was there, ready and willing to
make the tough choices, to cast the tough votes, to transform
President Reagan's vision of America into the law of the land,''
Dole said.
   Dole and his wife, former Transportation Secretary Elizabeth
Dole, both were under consideration for the Republican vice
presidential nomination before George Bush selected Quayle.
   Nowhere in four-minute speech did Dole allude to the controversy
surrounding the circumstances under which Quayle joined the
National Guard during the Vietnam War.
   Instead, Dole, the Senate Republican leader, concentrated on
Quayle's service in Congress and his family.
   ``He's already spent 12 years as a congressman and a senator,
tackling the vital national and international issues that affect
the lives of all Americans and the future of the country,'' Dole
said. ``That is 12 more years of national experience than Michael
Dukakis _ and he is running for president.''
   Following Dole to the podium were Sens. Richard Lugar of
Indiana, Nancy Kassebaum of Kansas and Alan Simpson of Wyoming and
Rep. Jack Kemp of New York.
   Lugar, the senior senator from Quayle's home state of Indiana,
misspoke during his address and told delegates he was endorsing the
nomination of ``the next president of the United States.''
   Simpson, in his seconding speech, said, ``We are the party of
the future and Dan Quayle is the future of our party.''
   Quayle was the only candidate whose name was placed in
nomination, and under rules adopted by the convention earlier this
week, was nominated by acclamation.

<TEXT>
   Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., said
he received assurances Thursday from the leftist Sandinista
government it will extend indefinitely a cease-fire with the
U.S.-backed Nicaraguan rebels.
   Dodd made a brief stop Thursday in Nicaragua and met with
President Daniel Ortega and his brother, Defense Minister Humberto
Ortega.
   ``There are no preconditions on talks'' with the rebels, known
as Contras, Dodd said at Augusto Cesar Sandino Airport shortly
before leaving. ``They said they would extend it (the cease-fire)
indefinitely.''
   The Sandinistas and Contras signed an agreement March 23 to seek
a negotiated settlement to the 7-year-old war. Both sides suspended
offensive military operations on March 21, the start of the talks.
   High-level talks broke off June 9 and each side charged the
other with breaking the cease-fire, which the Sandinistas have been
extending on a monthly basis. The current cease-fire was due to
expire Aug. 31.
   Ortega on Thursday renewed his call for a new round of talks to
take place in Managua on Aug. 26. The rebels, citing restrictions
on their freedom of movement, have said they will not return to the
capital and asked the president to take part in any future
discussions.
   Dodd said he discussed with the Sandinistas the latest U.S.
Senate package to provide humanitarian aid to the Contras.
   ``Obviously they are not happy,'' Dodd said, adding that the
possibility of renewed U.S. military aid to the rebels was ``very
open'' and that the government ``should know about that.''
   The United States has backed the Contras in their battle to
overthrow the Sandinistas since 1981, almost two years after the
new government came to power in a 1979 revolutionary war.
   U.S. military aid for the rebels expired in February. On Aug.
10, the Senate voted for a Democratic proposal to provide the
Contras with $27 million in non-lethal humanitarian aid after Oct.
1 and a possible second vote on $16.3 million in stockpiled
military aid later this year.
   Speaking in Spanish earlier outside the Foreign Ministry, Dodd
said U.S. relations with Latin America would improve with the
election of Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis.
   ``I have hope that if Dukakis wins that the relations between
the United States and Latin America will be much better,'' Dodd
said.

   Michael Dukakis ventured into an
historic Baptist church in the Deep South on Thursday to ask black
voters to join him in resolving that ``we will not rest until every
form of bigotry and racism and religious intolerance is banished
from this land.''
   The Democratic presidential nominee promised the predominantly
black congregation at the Sixth Avenue Baptist church to reverse
the ``indifference'' and ``blind eye'' of the Reagan administration.
   ``After eight long years, this nation needs a president and a
vice president who understand that civil rigths can never be a
sometime thing,'' said Dukakis, who was warmly received at the
Birmingham church.
   The Massachusetts governor came to Alabama from Miami, where he
termed the Reagan-Bush war against drugs an illusion.
   Dukakis accused President Reagan of ``stonewalling'' an
investigation of Panamanian leader Manuel Antonio Noriega's alleged
involvement in drug trafficking and said Vice President George
Bush's anti-drug efforts was ``a failure.''
   ``This war against drugs is non-existent,'' he told reporters.
Dukakis said little about the controversy over GOP vice
presidential candidate Dan Quayle's Vietnam-era service in the
National Guard.
   Some black leaders, including Jesse Jackson, had criticized
Dukakis for not using a recent appearance in Mississippi to outline
his views on minority concerns. On Thursday, he cited a long list
of problems demanding solutions, including a lack of affordable
housing, job training, prenatal care, quality schools and anti-drug
programs.
   ``We can remain frozen in the ice of our own indifference, or we
can invest in the prenatal care and early childhood education that
will give every child in America a healthy start and a fair shot at
the American dream,'' Dukakis told the congregation at the Sixth
Avenue Baptist Church.
   Dukakis paid tribute to four young girls who were killed 25
years ago in a racial bombing at a nearby black church.
   ``We can turn our heads and wish that hate crimes never took
place or ... we can provide the moral leadership we need to banish
racial and religious violence forever in this country,'' he said.
``And that leadership must begin in the White House.''
   Dukakis saluted Martin Luther King Jr., Jackson, Alabama's Rosa
Parks and other civil rights leaders.
   ``I am proud to be here tonight with hundreds of brave men and
women in this congregation who have marched and fought and
struggled against all odds to create a better world, not only for
your children but for all children everywhere,'' Dukakis said.
   ``Those of you who fought and struggled are true American
heroes. And while your names may not appear in history books, you
have made history.''
   He added: ``What better time than now to resolve that we will
not rest until every form of bigotry and racism and religious
intolerance is banished from this land.''
   Dukakis himself sought to steer clear of the controversy over
whether Quayle joined the Indiana National Guard to avoid combat
duty in Vietnam.
   Dukakis said, however, that he was proud to have served in Korea
in the aftermath of the Korean War. Dukakis aides, though, pointed
to the controversy to question Bush's judgment in picking Quayle.
   Dukakis congratulated Bush on winning the Republican
presidential nomination and then harshly criticized Reagan's order
Wednesday that the State and Defense departments and the CIA not
cooperate with a congressional investigation of Noreiga's alleged
drug ties.
   ``If we're serious about fighting the war (on drugs), we can't
have any stonewalling from the federal government or the White
House,'' Dukakis said before he headed for campaign appearances in
Alabama.
   The General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of
Congress, is trying to determine when U.S. intelligence agencies
first suspected Noriega of involvement in drug trafficking and when
Bush and other administration officials were alerted.
   ``I think the White House does not want to cooperate ... because
they are embarrassed by this. They should be embarrassed by this,''
Dukakis said.
   The Massachusetts governor was asked whether, if elected
president, he would put his vice president in charge of anti-drug
efforts. He replied that he would appoint a full-time drug czar
directly accountable to the president.
   He noted that Bush had served in that role as vice president.
   ``It was a failure,'' Dukakis said. ``What's the point of
repeating failure?''
   Dukakis at first refused comment when asked whether Quayle
should have enlisted for active duty in the military in 1969
instead of entering the Indiana Nationl Guard.
   Pressed on the issue, Dukakis said:
   ``I can only speak for myself. I served my country. I did so
proudly. It was an important issue in my life. I can only speak for
myself.''
   Touring the Marshall Space Flight Center at Huntsville, Ala.,
Dukakis declared his support for the multibillion-dollar space
station program. He also promised to revive the National Space
Council, a Cabinet-level agency that oversaw the U.S. space program
before it was abolished by President Nixon.
   ``In recent years, our space program has lost the sense of
purpose that made it such a source of accomplishment and pride,''
Dukakis said at Huntsville.
   ``We are no longer the unquestioned leader in space,'' he said.
``Some have begun to doubt our ability to compete in this vast new
frontier. I don't buy that at all, and I hope you don't either.''
   Dukakis planned to spend the night at St. Louis and campaign
Friday in Missouri, Illinois, Arkansas and Texas. His Saturday
schedule includes appearances in Texas and Tennessee.

   Here is a transcript of the speech by Sen.
Bob Dole of Kansas nominating Sen. Dan Quayle of Indiana for vice
president at the Republican National Convention on Thursday night.
   Thank you. Thank you.
   Mr. Chairman, four of my congressional colleagues and I are here
for the purpose of nominating the next vice president of the United
States.
   We are here to nominate one of the bright young lights in the
Republican Party, a man I am proud to say is my colleague, the
junior senator from Indiana, Dan Quayle.
   You know, senators get a lot of mail. Party leaders more than
most. And almost every one of these letters asks for help with some
problem.
   Well, three years ago, I received a handwritten plea from a
6-year-old girl who after several days of long, long Senate
sessions had a very special problem.
   She wrote, and I quote: ``I have my second-grade play tonight.
Please make sure my daddy can come home and watch me.''
   I knew Corinne Quayle was from a political family because she
invited me to come along, too.
   Corinne and her brothers, Tucker and Benjamin, and their mother,
Marilyn, share Dan Quayle with the people of Indiana and the United
States Senate.
   Dan Quayle is a dedicated public servant and a devoted family
man.
   And whenever I needed him, whenever I needed him, Dan was there
_ ready and willing to make the tough choices, to cast the tough
votes, to transform President Reagan's vision of America into the
law of the land.
   Whether it was the budget or defense, tax reform or the INF
treaty, Dan Quayle was there, a forceful advocate, and a staunch
supporter of the Reagan revolution. And now he is ready to carry
that revolution forward.
   And believe me he is ready, and just let the Democrats try to
use experience as a measuring stick in this campaign. Just let them
try.
   Now, I don't mean to suggest their presidential candidate lacks
experience. He's got plenty of experience, plenty of experience _
experience in raising taxes again and again, experience in vetoing
the pledge of allegiance in public schools, experience in
increasing spending year after year after year in Massachusetts.
   And I just don't believe the American people want that kind of
experience in the White House.
   It sounds like a Dukak-eyed idea to me.
   But Dan Quayle's got experience, too. He's already spent 12
years as a congressman and a senator, tackling the vital national
and international issues that affect the lives of all Americans and
the future of our country.
   That is 12 more years of national experience than Michael
Dukakis _ and he is running for president.
   As I said at the start, Dan Quayle is a man I know and trust. I
am honored to nominate him for vice president, Mr. Chairman.
   And for the purpose of debate only, I yield the balance of my
time to the outstanding, distinguished senior from Indiana, my good
friend, Sen. Dick Lugar.

   A new American Medical Association report
concludes that only two chemicals used previously in pesticides are
known to cause cancer in humans, but an occupational health expert
Thursday called that finding ``questionable.''
   The report was written by the AMA's Council on Scientific
Affairs to inform physicians about the potential hazards of
pesticides, particularly as they affect farmers and other workers
who come in frequent contact with them.
   After reviewing the medical literature on the topic, the
report's authors concluded only the chemicals arsenic and vinyl
chloride have been proven to cause cancer in humans.
   Vinyl chloride was used previously as an aerosol propellant, but
was removed from all pesticides more than a decade ago. The use of
arsenic in pesticides, once common, has dropped off considerably,
although it is now used in wood preservative.
   The council report, published in Friday's Journal of the AMA,
said delayed health effects of pesticides on humans have been
difficult to detect, and called on the federal Environmental
Protection Agency to work harder to identify dangerous substances
and eliminate them from the environment and the workplace.
   It also acknowledged that many chemicals used in pesticides have
been shown to cause genetic damage or cancer in animal and
laboratory tests, but said such tests are ``not reliably predictive
of human carcinogenicity.''
   The authors concluded that the primary hazard of pesticide
exposure is severe short-term reactions to touching or inhaling
very large amounts.
   But Samuel Epstein, professor of occupational and environmental
medicine at the University of Illinois-Chicago and a nationally
recognized expert on toxic chemicals, called the authors' positions
``extreme.''
   ``The report fails to recognize an overwhelming consensus in the
informed independent scientific literature, as well as a wide range
of national and international experts, who believe that information
derived from valid, well-designed animal carcinogencity tests
creates a strong presumption of cancer risk to humans,'' he said.
   ``To dismiss such data pending confirmation in human studies is
nothing short of irresponsible. It took multimillion-dollar
research involving millions of subjects before evidence of the
carcinogenicity of tobacco obtained in animal studies could be
confirmed in humans,'' Epstein added.
   AMA spokesman Dr. Alan Engelberg defended the council's report,
saying medical literature on the subject is frequently conflicting.
   ``This is a muddy area. All the results aren't in, and that's
why we're calling for more study,'' he said. ``Sometimes, that
looks like a smokescreen. But very little is clear at this time.''
   Epstein said the report also failed to address the fact that
many pesticides producea wide range of other toxic effects in
workers, such as sterility.
   ``And nowhere is there any mention of risk to homeowners,''
concluded Epstein. ``People often dump a lot of this stuff on their
lawns, and there is a complete failure to discuss it.''
   But John McCarthy, spokesman for the National Agricultural
Chemicals Association, which represents pesticide manufacturers,
responded, ``If it's not an obvious problem with occupational
exposure, and that's what the study is saying, it makes no sense
that it would be a problem outside that group.''

   Here is a transcript of remarks by Barbara
Bush to the Republican National Convention Thursday night.
   Thank you, I think you're about as happy tonight as I am. And
thank you, my dear friend Louis Sullivan, for that very kind
introduction.
   And thank all of you for that warm welcome.
   You know, I've always felt I was the world's luckiest woman. Now
I know it. I'm married to an extraordinarily special man. I have
five well, happy, doing children, all of whom married wonderful
people. And 10-plus perfect grandchildren.
   I have caring, loyal friends, such as yourselves.
   I've had the opportunity to work for a more literate America.
And I care deeply about other problems, such as leukemia, the
homeless, and many other problems facing us.
   You know, I've loved George Bush almost since the day I laid
eyes on him. Now I realize that won't get him a lot of votes, so
let me explain why I respect him.
   First of all, George was always there when the children needed
him.
   By now, you may be getting tired of hearing all the important
jobs George has held. And he has. All those jobs have demanded
tremendous energy and commitment from him.
   But do you know what I respect about George? In spite of all
those jobs, our family has always felt an enormous part of his
life. The children and I have always felt as important as the work
he was doing. And this has given our children confidence.
   I remember, I called George one day when the boys were small and
I said, ``I'm desperate. I don't know what to do. Your son's in
trouble again. He just hit a ball through the neighbor's upstairs
window.''
   And George said, ``Wow, what a hit.'' And then he said, ``Did
you get the ball back?''
   A reporter once asked what his proudest accomplishment was. And
he paused a moment and then said, ``Our kids still come home.'' He
meant it.
   George is always there when someone needs him.
   I won't give you great detail, but let me give you an example.
   Once, when he is business, my husband had to fire a man who was
an alcoholic. He didn't pass this painful task off to someone else;
he did it himself.
   But George just didn't fire the man. First, as support he went
with him to tell his wife. And she said, ``Thank heavens, for 10
years I have worried and wondered why no one knew.'' It was as if a
burden had been lifted from her.
   And then do you know what George did? He attended A.A. meetings
with the man. And today that man is a friend and supporter of my
husband's. He may be in the audience tonight.
   George has always been there when I needed him, too.
   The hardest thing we ever faced together was the loss of a
child. I was very strong over the months we were trying to save
her. At least, I thought I was. Maybe I was just pretending.
   But when she was gone, I fell apart. But George wouldn't let me
retreat into my grief. He held me in his arms and he made me share
it and accept that his sorrow was as great as my own.
   He simply wouldn't allow my grief to divide us apart, push us
apart, which is what happens so often when there's a loss like that.
   As long as I live, I will respect my husband for the strength of
his understanding.
   I guess what I'm really trying to say to each of you here
tonight is that you should feel proud of what you've done at this
convention.
   And what you've done is this _ you've nominated for the
presidency of the United States a man who is as strong and caring
and decent as America herself.
   Thank you very, very much.

   A group of foreigners distributed
leaflets and staged a brief protest Thursday in central Prague
demanding more freedom in Czechoslovakia and withdrawal of Soviet
troops before police hustled them away. The government later said
it expelled them. An activist in Rome said that eight Italians were
expelled after giving out leaflets earlier this week, but that five
or six other protesters remained in police custody after they were
arrested in Prague on Thursday.
   The demonstration, timed to mark this weekend's anniversary of
the Soviet-led invasion that crushed reform 20 years ago, were
staged by members by the Radical Party, a Europe-wide movement that
has its strongest following in Italy.
   Eight party members held a 75-foot banner across the width of
Wenceslas Square on Thursday that proclaimed ``Together for
Democracy _ 1968 _ Russian Troops Out of the Country _ Freedom _
Human Rights,'' and was adorned with a drawing of a tank.
   Hundreds of people gathered to look at the Czech language
banner. Within three minutes, uniformed and plainclothes police had
hustled the protesters into waiting patrol cars.
   A smaller banner with the word ``freedom'' in Czech fluttered
from the statue of King Wenceslas farther up the square, but police
quickly tore it down and arrested the two people who displayed it.
   The official news agency CTK accused the protesters of
attempting ``a provocation'' on Wenceslas Square. It said the
leaflets stemmed from ``a campaign unleashed by the Western media
against Czechoslovakia under the cloak of the so-called Prague
Spring.''
   The stay of ``these foreign nationals, who misused their visit,
was terminated,'' the news agency said in a brief report that did
not mention how many people were expelled or where they were sent.
   In Rome, a Radical Party official said eight Italians were
expelled from Czechoslovakia Thursday after they gave out leaflets
calling for protests to mark the 20th anniversary of the Soviet
invasion. Party spokesman Antonio Stango said they were detained in
the cities of Kolin, Brno, Bratislava and Budejovice on Tuesday and
Wednesday.
   He also said five or six party members were arrested because
they took part in the demonstration in Prague on Thursday. One of
them is Giovanni Negri, a member of the European Parliament, Stango
said.
   He said the detainees were still being held by police but he had
no details on their condition.
   An American, Antonia Elizabeth Brown, and several Belgians were
also detained in connection with the Prague protest, he said. He
did not know Brown's hometown.
   In Brussels, Radical Party worker Alexander de Berlingh had said
Wednesday that seven Italians and one Spanish woman were presumed
detained after distributing the leaflets in Brno.
   There was no explanation for the different numbers of Italians
arrested in the two reports of party officials.
   Other leaflets were handed out in Slovakia and in the Prague
area, de Berlingh told The Associated Press. De Berlingh said 20
people, mostly Italians, took part in the leaflet distribution and
Thursday's protest.
   At least two underground groups have distributed leaflets in
recent days calling on citizens to mark the anniversary by staging
peaceful protests, wearing the national flag or dressing in the
flag's colors of red, white and blue.
   The Radical Party, which has three deputies in the European
Parliament, distributed thousands of the leaflets around
Czechoslovakia this week, an activist said. The pamphlets called
for freedom, human rights, Soviet troop withdrawal and the release
of political prisoners.
   Wenceslas Square was the scene of fierce protests by thousands
of people after Soviet and Warsaw Pact troops and tanks invaded
Czechoslovakia Aug. 20-21, 1968, to crush the ``Prague Spring,'' a
Communist-led reform under then-party leader Alexander Dubcek.
   The CTK news agency said police who broke up the protest were
summoned ``by Czechoslovak citizens who were on the square.''
   Some onlookers were heard denouncing the protesters as ``fools''
or ``idiots.''
   Others murmured support for the protesters. ``Finally, some
brave people,'' one Czech said. As the demonstrators were detained,
another bystander commented, ``What kind of democracy is this?''

   Here is a transcript of remarks by Illinois
Gov. James Thompson introducing Vice President George Bush at the
Republican National Convention Thursday night.
   Mr. Chairman, my fellow Republicans, my fellow Americans.
   The nomination of a candidate for the office of president of the
United States is more than the tribal roar in a convention hall,
more than the sum total of cold caucus days in the dead of winter
on the prairie or in the mountains, more than the raucous shouts
and endless images of primary trails across a nation.
   The presidential nomination of a political party represents more
than the singular and personal triumph of one leader's voice amidst
the chorus of philosophy and alliances and loyalties.
   More than this, the nomination of our presidential candidate
defines the soul of our party and the character and common sense of
the campaign which we now bring to the nation. So that our fellow
Americans _ whose allegiance and approval we want _ may know who we
are, it is imperative that they know who George Bush _ the man and
the leader _ is.
   The American people understand the triumph of the Reagan-Bush
years _ when America regained her voice and place in the world;
when an economy in shambles was rescued and revived; when American
competitiveness was brought back.
   The American people understand that the world is a more peaceful
place today because the Reagan-Bush team brought those who used to
bristle behind their missiles to the bargaining table so that
generations of our children and grandchildren could live in peace.
   The American people are grateful to Ronald Reagan and George
Bush for this and for much more. But that is not what this election
is about. This election is about the future.
   The George Bush that I know believes that as we strengthen our
economy, we must not let the engines of that economy despoil our
land and our air and our water. The George Bush that I know loves
this land of ours, and a Bush administration will protect it.
   The George Bush that I know believes that the future begins with
family _ he has always been sustained and strengthened by his
family.
   The George Bush that I know wants hope and opportunity for all
the children of America; the chance to learn and the opportunity to
earn; to make their way in a world of equality. But, he knows that
what government does is not a substitute for what good-hearted
people can do with encouragement and self-help.
   The other candidate for president believes that a new government
bureaucracy can best tell us how to and where to care for our
children. But George Bush believes that the American family and the
American neighbor and the American church know best how to care for
our children.
   And the George Bush that I know believes that freedom from
criminals is more important than freedom for criminals.
   The George Bush that I know seeks peace. But George Bush knows
that America cannot hide behind its own borders without the risk of
the toxic waste of unchallenged tyranny may someday wash up on our
shores if we shrink from defending freedom anywhere in the world.
   Maybe you don't need to be shot from the skies at the age of 20
in the defense of your country, or run the spies and the spooks
from Langley, to know that it's a dangerous world from decade to
decade. But my guess is, it sure helped. George Bush knows that we
have to be brave, and strong, and daring, but we have to be
``careful out there.''
   My fellow Republicans, let's take a closer look at America's
best hope for progress without risk, for change and for growth
without destruction of the accomplishments we have gained, and the
values that hold us together. All of us, as Americans.

<HEAD>China Approves Five-Year Plan of Price and Wage Reform</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM ABRAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China's top Communist Party leaders have agreed
on a five-year plan to press forward with price and wage reform,
reduce bureaucratic interference in business and attack public
corruption and waste.
   The ``tentative plan on price and wage reforms'' was passed at a
three-day meeting this week of the Politburo, the party's top
decision-making body.
   The official Xinhua News Agency reported Thursday the meeting
was held at the coastal resort of Beidaihe, with General Secretary
Zhao Ziyang presiding.
   The plan also called for strict measures next year to bring
inflation under control, especially by reining in spending in
unauthorized new buildings and other capital construction.
   Details of the plan were not provided, but it appeared to
represent solid support for Zhao Ziyang and others who advocate
more aggressive steps to reform China's inefficient economy by
shifting to a more market-oriented economic system.
   Speculation has arisen that Zhao is encountering resistance from
economic conservatives who feel the reforms are moving too fast,
creating unacceptable levels of inflation and fostering social
instability.
   ``China's economy is full of vitality and is developing
vigorously,'' Xinhua said. ``The time is favorable to the price and
wage reforms.''
   Inflation the first half of the year approached 20 percent,
partly as a result of the loosening of price controls and
producers' inability to meet rising consumer demand.
   Xinhua said that in the next five years the state will continue
to control prices of a few important commodities and labor but will
liberalize prices for most goods and subject them to market
regulation.
   Price reform will focus on ``correcting those exceptionally
irrational problems in prices which seriously hamper the economic
development and the growth of markets,'' it said.
   The report said the overall objective of wage reform is to see
that the living standards of most wage earners do not drop.
   The government acknowledged that last year, when the inflation
rate was said to be 7.3 percent, about 20 percent of urban wage
earners reported a decline in their living standards.
   Chinese sources said this week that China will soon give its
workers large raises and link further pay increases to the
inflation rate. One source said the average worker, who now takes
home 910 yuan ($246) a year, will soon get an extra 30 yuan a
month, equal to a 28 percent raise.
   The 17 Politburo members at the meeting agreed that revamping
China's economic system was crucial to success in price and wage
reforms.
   A key goal for 1989, according to the plan, will be to raise
economic efficiency by making enterprise managers responsible for
their profits and losses and by strengthening markets.
   In a meeting with Japanese journalists at Beidaihe Tuesday, Zhao
said the government will give priority to enterprise reform. He
said the key to better efficiency lies in making all enterprises
compete for markets, promoting the better ones and eliminating the
inferior ones. Communist China's first bankruptcy law, which draws
up rules for the closure of losing businesses, will go into effect
Nov. 1.
   China will also forge ahead with reform of its political system,
including the separation of party and government functions and the
running of businesses, Xinhua said.
   Also in 1989, the government will reduce the purchasing power of
government and semi-official groups, ``while taking tough measures
to counter extravagance and waste to keep the party and government
organizations honest,'' the agency reported.
   Authorities will crack down on embezzlers, bribetakers, seekers
of exorbitant profits, speculators, hoarders and those who impose
economic blockades or local protectionism.
   China's current pricing system, with its artificially low
ceilings on the prices of many raw materials and food items, has
led to widespread corruption among officials who seize large
quantities of hard-to-obtain goods and sell them at far higher
prices on free markets or the black market.
   Xinhua said the Politburo at an earlier meeting decided to draw
up the price and wage reform plan, and on June 2 the Party Central
Committee formed groups of experts to study the matter.
   The State Council, or cabinet, discussed the plan at an Aug. 5-9
meeting.
   Xinhua said the Party Central Committee will take up the plan
again at its full session next month.
   Zhao told the Japanese journalists the plan will be ready for
implementation by the beginning of 1989.

<TEXT>
   Before an uproarious Republican National
Convention, George Bush claimed the presidential nomination
Thursday with a declaration that the election is a choice between
``two very different ideas of the future:'' America as a rising
nation or one in decline.
   In remarks to the convention's closing session, Bush described
himself as the underdog determined ``to run hard, to fight hard, to
stand on the issues.''
   ``They call it a swiss cheese economy,'' he said of his
Democratic opponents. ``Well, that's the way it might look to the
three blind mice. But when they were in charge, it was all holes
and no cheese.''
   Bush chuckled when some began singing, ``Three Blind Mice.''
   Bush also addressed the desire for change after nearly eight
years of the Reagan presidency, a desire the vice president's
campaign advisers believe is one of his biggest hurdles.
   ``But when you have to change horses in midstream, doesn't it
make sense to switch to one who's going the same way?'' he asked.
   The new presidential nominee closed his speech by asking the
delegates to stand and join him in reciting the Pledge of
Allegiance to the flag.
   His wife, Barbara, was the first to join Bush on the podium.
They kissed and then turned and faced the roaring crowd. Then came
the four Bush sons and a daughter and 10 grandchildren.
   The vice presidential nominee, Indiana Sen. Dan Quayle, his
wife, Marilyn and their children, joined the Bush family on the
podium.
   It was the scene Bush had promised the previous day when he said
he would drop his reluctance to put his family in the spotlight.
   For 10 minutes it was only family. Then the politicians joined
them, the men whom Bush defeated in the fight for the nomination _
Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas, former Gov. Pete du Pont of Delaware, Rep.
Jack Kemp of New York, and television evangelist Pat Robertson.
   Thousands of red, white and blue balloons and flakes of confetti
drifted down on the celebrating crowd.
   The demonstration died down after 15 minutes.
   Bush was introduced by Gov. Jim Thompson of Illinois and by a
videotape that showed him shaking hands with Soviet Leader Mikhail
Gorbachev as well as playing with one of his granddaughters.
   Also featured on the video was President Reagan saying, ``I
trust George Bush. America can trust him too.''
   The huge hall erupted into cheers and flag-waving with the
announcement, ``Ladies and gentlemen, the vice president of the
United States,'' and Bush strode alone to the podium.
   Hundreds of young people who had filed into the hall during the
video fueled the demonstration, which went on for seven minutes.
   It was a night Bush had awaited for eight years, ever since the
1980 campaign when he lost out to Reagan and ended up with the
party's vice presidential candidate.
   Barbara Bush watched her husband's speech from the VIP box,
where she sat between the Rev. Billy Graham and Greek Orthodox
Archbishop Iacavos. Also seated in the box were the vice
presidential nominee, Indiana Sen. Dan Quayle and his family.
   In his acceptance speech, the vice president cited campaign
themes of his Democratic opponent, Michael Dukakis, and tried to
turn them to his advantage.
   ``Some say this isn't an election about ideology, it's an
election about competence,'' said Bush, a reference to Dukakis'
speech accepting the Democratic presidential nomination.
   ``But this election isn't only about competence, for competence
is a narrow idea,'' said the Republican nominee. ``Competence makes
the trains run on time but doesn't know where they're going.''
   On jobs, he said, ``Someone better take a `message to Michael:'
tell him we've been creating good jobs at good wages.'' The need to
create good jobs at good wages, is a favorite Dukakis campaign
theme.
   Bush conceded that ``I may not be the most eloquent ... I may
sometimes be a little awkward, but there's nothing self-conscious
in my love of country. I am a quiet man _ but I hear the quiet
people others don't. The ones who raise the family, pay the taxes,
meet the mortgage.
   ``I hear them and I am moved, and their concerns are mine.''
   He praised his running mate, Sen. Dan Quayle of Indiana, under
fire over his National Guard service at a time when many draftees
were being sent to Vietnam.
   He caled Quayle ``a young leader who has become a forceful in
preparing America's workers for the labor force of the future. ...
I'm proud to have Dan Quayle at my side.''
   Paying tribute to President Reagan, Bush said he spent the last
7{ years helping ``a president conduct the most difficult job on
earth.
   ``Ronald Reagan asked for, and received, my candor. He never
asked for, but he did receive, my loyalty.''
   But the time had come, he said when ``you must see me as I am:
the Republican candidate for president of the United States.''
   He said the election was between ``not only two very different
men but two very different ideas of the future.''
   ``My opponent's view of the world sees a long slow decline for
our country, an inevitable fall mandated by impersonal historical
forces.
   ``But America is not in decline. America is a rising nation.''
   He said he and Dukakis have contrasting views on such questions
as whether the Pledge of Allegiance should be required in the
schools, on school prayer, the death penalty, gun control, abortion
and taxes.
   Bush vowed to ``do whatever it takes to make the sure the
disabled are included in the mainstream.''
   He pledged to stop ocean dumping and said, ``Our beaches should
not be garbage dumps and our harbors should not be cesspools.''
Bush said he would order the FBI to find out who was responsible
for the recent dumping of medical waste that washed up on beaches
in New York and new Jersey.
   He repeated his call for tougher ethical standards, saying
``there are those who have dropped their standards along the way,
as if ethics were too heavy and slowed their rise to the top.'' He
made no direct reference to the Reagan administration officials
accused of ethical violations.
   Earlier in the day, Bush appeared at a tribute to his wife,
Barbara, and said that he was told ``you've got to be a little more
demonstrative'' after seeing Michael Dukakis and his wife, Kitty,
openly display their affection toward each other at the Democratic
convention in July.
   Recently, Bush has often said that he is not given to public
displays of affection or emotion.
   ``Here we go,'' he said, looking at his wife who was seated to
his right, ``the introduction with feeling.
   ``Come on up, sweetie pie.''
   With that, Mrs. Bush stepped forward and they hugged.
   ``Thank you very, very much ... sweetie,'' he said.
   Then she told the audience, ``I hope you don't take your eyes
off him and see if he looks at me adoringly.''
   Later, she said, ``Nobody ever had a better husband.''

presidential nomination.
   ... Mr. Chairman, fellow Republicans, I accept your nomination
for vice president of the United States of America. ...
   ... Since 1980, I have been a United States senator from Indiana
_ and very proud of it. Before that, I was a member of the United
States House of Representatives _ and proud of it. And, as a young
man, I served six years in the National Guard, and, like millions
of Americans who have served in the Guard and who serve today _ and
I am proud of that. ...
   ... I would have been quite happy spending my life in
Huntington, in the newspaper business, watching my kids grow,
seeing a community with plenty of opportunity to go around. But I
looked around me in the mid-70s and I saw threats to the future of
my family and to the values that could once be taken for granted in
our country.
   Beyond my town, there were communities torn by crime and drugs,
and there were neighborhoods where the very word ``opportunity''
didn't exist because there were no jobs.
   I decided to try to change these things: to make opportunity
replace despair, and to make the future just as good as the past
for the families of the many Huntingtons of great our land.
   That was 1976, when I was first elected to the House of
Representatives. ... In those Jimmy Carter years, the people
running things thought government was the answer, instead of part
of the problem. They thought high taxes and big spending would
solve anything. I think you know the rest. None of their policies
worked and the American people knew it. ...
   ... We do not need the future the Democratic Party sees, the
party of George McGovern, Jimmy Carter, Walter Mondale, (crowd
boos) _ just wait, it gets better _ Ted Kennedy and, now, his
buddy, Michael Dukakis. That future has America in retreat. That
future has higher taxes and a guaranteed loss of job opportunities.
And that future has more government intervention in the lives of
all of us.
   The future under George Bush means peace and economic
opportunity for all. ...
   ... I am privileged to be the first person of my generation to
be on a national ticket. I don't presume to talk for everyone of my
generation, but I know that a great many will agree with me when I
express my thanks to the generation of George Bush for bringing us
to an era of peace and freedom and opportunity.
   My generation has a profound debt to them. We will pay it by
making sure that our children and the generations that follow will
have the same freedom, the same family values and a future bright
with opportunity for all.
   Thank you very much. Good night. God bless you. Let's go on to
victory.

   The main Iranian rebel group claimed
Thursday the government in Tehran has executed thousands of its
activists and supporters in recent weeks and secretly buried them
in mass graves.
   The Mujahedeen Khalq, or People's Holy Warriors, said in a
statement telexed from its headquarters in Baghdad, capital of
Iraq, that most of those killed had spent years in prison.
   It added that hundreds of civilians in western Iran were
publicly hanged for supporting rebel forces that pushed into the
region from bases in Iraq last month.
   There was no independent confirmation of the claim, which the
Mujahedeen Khalq said was based on ``reliable reports from Iran,''
but the Financial Times of London reported from Tehran on Wednesday
that ``systematic executions of left-wing prisoners'' had been
carried out since April.
   Edward Mortimer, the correspondent, said the executions
accelerated after the Mujahedeen Khalq's National Liberation Army
of Iran moved into western Iran after Iran announced July 18 that
it would accept a U.N. Security Council cease-fire resolution.
   Mortimer said families of executed prisoners wre jamming Behesht
Zahra cemetery in Tehran, where the slain were buried in special
plots. He said 58 bodies were buried between July 27 and Aug. 10.
   Some Iranian leaders, including Chief Justice Mussavi Ardebili,
publicly demanded that imprisoned rebels be executed.
   Ardebili said on Tehran radio Aug. 5: ``There is no need for any
trial. The crime is clear ... and the punishment is also clear. I
pray to God that all of them are destroyed.''
   Iran's former revolutionary prosecutor, Habib Ladjevardi,
criticized authorities recently for showing clemency to political
prisoners who repented. Ladjevardi helped send hundreds of alleged
government opponents to their deaths.
   The Mujahedeen statement said Iranian authorities carried out
the mass executions in retaliation for widespread support given the
rebel invaders.
   It said the government's purpose ``is to slow down the process
of its inevitable overthrow, a process that has accelerated in the
wake of the regime's acceptance of the cease-fire.''
   According to the Financial Times, another reason for the
executions was an official ``desire to placate angry radicals after
the cease-fire.''
   Both the paper and the Mujahedeen statement said executions were
most numerous in Kerend in southwest Iran, where townspeople
welcomed the invaders.
   Attacks by Liberation Army into western Iran have increased in
recent months and Iranian leaders have publicly acknowledged rebel
incursions.
   Iran claimed the army killed 4,800 rebels last month and drove
the rest back into Iraq. Its official Islamic Republic News Agency
reported in recent days that scores of captured Mujahedeen fighters
were publicly hanged in several western towns.
   Another Iranian opposition group, the outlawed pro-Moscow Tudeh
Communist Party, said ``group after group'' of Mujahedeen
activists, political prisoners and ``collaborators'' were executed
in the past month.
   The Mujahedeen Khalq was allies of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini
in the Islamic revolution that ousted the late Shah Mohammad Reza
Pahlavi in February 1979, but the fundamentalists later turned on
the Mujahedeen and other leftist and liberal factions.
   In its latest statement, the rebel group said about 70,000
people have been executed in Iran since Khomeini's revolution.
   Amnesty International, the human rights group based in London,
lists about 6,000 but says it believes the true figure is much
higher.

   The Republican National Convention observed a
minute of silence Wednesday night in memory of President Mohammed
Zia ul-Haq of Pakistan and U.S. Ambassador Arnold L. Raphel, who
were killed in an aircraft explosion.
   Among the 35 others aboard the aircraft were Brig. Gen. Herbert
M. Wassom, chief U.S. defense representative to Pakistan, and
several Pakistani army generals. All were reported killed.
   It was not clear what caused the explosion.
   Zia was a close U.S. ally and ruled Pakistan for 11 years,
longest of anyone in the nation's 41-year history. In accordance
with the constitution, he was succeeded by Senate chairman Ghulam
Ishaq Khan, who declared a state of emergency and 10 days of
national mourning.

   Democrat Michael Dukakis' ``socialist
agenda'' could wreck the U.S. economy, former Arizona Gov. Evan
Mecham told a conservative youth group Wednesday.
   The former governor also told the mostly college-age Young
Americans for Freedom he might try to win back the office he lost
through impeachment conviction in April.
   Responding to questions, Mecham, a George Bush delegate to the
Republican National Convention, acknowledged that many people were
``not enthused'' about the prospect of a Bush presidency.
   ``I suggest that they look at the alternative of absolute
disaster that would be wrought upon America and the world by a
Dukakis presidency,'' Mecham said.
   ``I assure you that the Dukakis socialist agenda will so
unsettle investor confidence that it will wreak havoc on our
economy in unprecedented proportions,'' he said.
   Later, Mecham told reporters he might seek to regain the
governorship in 1992 ``if there wasn't somebody better to run that
I could support.''
   Mecham was convicted on impeachment charges of misusing $80,000
from the governor's protocol fund by loaning it to his auto
dealership, and of trying to thwart an investigation of an alleged
death threat.

<HEAD>GOP Strikes Back at Democratic Fund-raising Challenge</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GARY LANGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Republican fund-raisers, facing true
competition from their Democratic counterparts for the first time
in decades, are striking back this week by trying to raise $4
million at one event.
   ``We're concerned about it,'' said Fred Bush, chief fund-raiser
of Vice President George Bush's campaign. ``There seems to be a lot
of interest in fund raising on the Democratic side. I've never seen
that before.''
   Fred Bush, no relation to the vice president, is squaring off
against vaunted Democratic money man Robert Farmer, who has pledged
to raise $50 million for Democratic presidential nominee Michael
Dukakis' effort in the fall campaign.
   It remains to be seen if Farmer can deliver: that sum would be
unprecedented for a Democrat. But he has succeeded in instilling
newfound fervor in Republican campaign donors.
   ``Our guys understand. They know what's going on out there,''
Fred Bush said in an interview this week. ``A lot of them have come
to us and said, `I don't want the Democrats to beat us on fund
raising. What can I do?'''
   For one thing, they can attend a $1,000-per-plate lunch at the
city Convention Center on Thursday to benefit the Republican
National Committee. The goal is $4 million, compared to $2.5
million at the Dallas gala in 1984.
   ``It's our one big gala every year,'' said RNC spokeswoman
Katherine Murray. ``It's an opportunity for us to honor the new
nominee and vice presidential nominee. It's a celebration of our
all being here together.''
   It's also a chance for corporations to get in good with the GOP
by reserving tables at $100,000 each. And it's a way for the
Republicans to stroke their wealthy supporters with a personal
appearance by the nominee.
   But Thursday's lunch is by no means the only event for
fund-raisers this week. More than 600 contributors of $10,000-plus
are in town, Fred Bush said, and they're being treated to a full
plate of parties and receptions.
   There's also some hard business: a 1{-hour meeting for about 200
top fund-raisers to organize GOP efforts in each state, with
campaign chairman James Baker as host of the event.
   So far the Republicans have done well at raising money. Fred
Bush said the Republicans already have collected the $8.3 million
limit to supplement the Bush campaign's federal financing of $46
million; about $7 million, of a $25 million goal, for state party
accounts to be spent in coordination with the presidential
campaign; and several million more for general party-building. A
separate item is the RNC's operating budget, beneficiary of
Thursday's gala.
   ``Our goal is to keep pace with the Democrats,'' said Fred Bush.
``All this big money they're raising _ we're trying to do it too.''

   ABC will premiere new episodes of ``Mission:
Impossible'' beginning Oct. 23 as part of the network's delayed
fall season, the network announced Wednesday.
   ABC's earlier plans for ``Mission: Impossible,'' prompted by the
writers strike, involved the refilming of old scripts in Australia.
Now that the strike is over, ABC will shoot 13 all-new episodes,
not remakes. The series, starring Peter Graves as Jim Phelps, will
still be produced in Australia.
   In addition to ``Mission: Impossible,'' ABC will introduce
``Roseanne,'' a new situation comedy starring Roseanne Barr, on
Oct. 18.
   Seven old ABC series will have their season premieres in
October. They are ``Perfect Strangers,'' ``Full House'' and ``Mr.
Belvedere'' on Oct. 14; ``Who's the Boss?'' on Oct. 18; ``Growing
Pains'' and ``Head of the Class'' on Oct. 19; and ``Just the Ten of
Us'' on Oct. 28.
   Premiere dates for other shows will be announced in the near
future, an ABC statement said.

   Democrat Michael Dukakis on Wednesday
criticized Republicans for using their convention for ``a trip down
memory lane'' while ignoring GOP policies that have hurt American
families and failed to help economically depressed regions.
   Dukakis, during a lakefront rally on Minnesota's Iron Range,
also touted the qualifications of his running mate, Texas Sen.
Lloyd Bentsen, and implied that Indiana Sen. Dan Quayle, the
certain Republican vice presidential nominee, was not qualified to
be president.
   ``Nobody ever asked any questions about whether Lloyd Bentsen
was qualified to be president of the United States,'' Dukakis said
a day after George Bush tapped Quayle, a 41-year-old conservative,
to fill out the Repubican ticket.
   Dukakis told the rally the Republicans were using their
convention in New Orleans to celebrate the Reagan presidency
because they did not want to discuss rising interest rates, the
soaring trade and budget deficits and economic distress in the
Midwest and other parts of the country.
   ``The Republican Party has been celebrating the past,'' he said.
``When you think about what's going to happen to them in November,
you can't blame them.
   ``While they're partying on Bourbon Street, we're talking to
people on Main Street,'' Dukakis said. ``While they're talking
about labels, we're talking about jobs. While they take a trip down
Memory Lane, we're looking to the future.''
   In Boston, the Massachusetts governor's campaign office issued a
statement saying Dukakis was saddened by the plane crash that
claimed the lives of Pakistani President Mohammed Zia ul-Haq, U.S.
Ambassador to Pakistan Arnold L. Raphel and 35 others.
   ``President Zia will be remembered for his steadfast opposition
to the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan and for ensuring that 3
million Afghans had a place of refuge in Pakistan,'' Dukakis said
in the statement.
   Dukakis, on the first day of a four-day campaign trip designed
to help him steal some of the spotlight from the GOP gathering,
went to great lengths to praise Bentsen, 67.
   Referring to legislation to give workers 60 days' notice before
a plant closing, Dukakis told the rally: ``We've got to have a vice
president who led the fight and didn't oppose the fight.'' Quayle
opposed the plant-closing measure, along with Reagan and Bush.
Reagan allowed it to became law without his signature.
   At a news conference after the rally, Dukakis used praise of
Bentsen to criticize Quayle.
   ``I think Senator Bentsen is a tremendous asset to me and to the
Democratic ticket because he is so steady and so mature and has
demonstrated a capacity for leadership,'' Dukakis said.
   The Democratic nominee said ``that's a judgment the American
people are going to have to make'' when asked if he thought Quayle
was qualified to step in as president in the event of a tragedy.
But he then left little doubt about his true feelings.
   ``I would just point out that nobody ever asked any questions
about whether Lloyd Bentsen would be qualified to be president of
the United States,'' the Massachusetts governor said.
   He cited Bentsen's leadership in winning passage of the
plant-closing law, a major trade bill, welfare reform and
catastrophic health care legislation, something Dukakis referred to
as a ``legislative grand slam.''
   Among those appearing at the rally with Dukakis were former Vice
President Walter Mondale, Rep. James Oberstar and Hubert H.
``Skip'' Humphrey III, Minnesota attorney general and Senate
candidate.
   Dukakis used the event to reiterate his support for Oberstar's
National Economic Development Act, which would create a fund to
invest in economically weak areas of the country. Dukakis has
endorsed spending $500 million on such a program.
   ``Prosperity in some places and depression in others is not
acceptable,'' said Dukakis, who earlier had mentioned the loss of
8,000 jobs on the Iron Range in the last 10 years. ``That's
something the Republican Party might want to take a look at.''
   The rally was interrupted for several minutes when an
anti-abortion protester screamed, ``What about the unborn'' into an
amplified bullhorn.
   ``Here's someone who wants to debate,'' Dukakis said as a Secret
Service agent and several people at the rally forcibly removed the
man from the crowd. ``Maybe we can get the vice president to
debate.''
   From the Iron Range, Dukakis flew to Minneapolis for a private
fund-raiser for the Democratic National Committee and then was
headed to Miami, where he was to spend the night before addressing
a Greek-American organization's convention.
   Other stops on his trip this week include Alabama, Missouri,
Illinois, Arkansas, Texas and Tennessee. He returns to Boston on
Saturday night.

   Sen. Dan Quayle and his wife, Marilyn, had
slipped away for what they suspected would be a last private lunch
when they got word George Bush was trying to reach him with an
offer for the No. 2 spot on the ticket, Quayle revealed Wednesday.
   Quayle said that when it appeared Bush might let his prospective
running mates know of his decision on Tuesday, ``my wife and I did
the only thing that spouses might do when you think that a call
might come and it might be your last private lunch and so we took a
walk down Bourbon Street.''
   They chose a seafood restaurant for lunch, and then their beeper
went off.
   ``Marilyn said, `Well, there it is,''' Quayle said in an ABC
interview.
   Back at their hotel, Quayle said, there was a message to call
James A. Baker, Bush's campaign chairman. Bush came on the line and
offered the Indiana senator the post, Quayle said.
   ``I went like this to my wife,'' Quayle said, raising his hand
in a thumbs-up gesture. ``And said, `yes sir.' And here we are.''

<HEAD>Hispanic Agent Complains of Mormon Superior</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HOLDEN LEWIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>EL PASO, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Mormon who is a now high-ranking FBI
official tried to destroy a Hispanic agent's career for racial and
religious reasons, the agent testified Wednesday in a
discrimination suit against the bureau.
   Sammy Martinez, testifying in a class action by Hispanic agents,
said he was falsely accused of wrongdoing by John Walser, now
executive assistant director of the FBI, when Walser was his boss
in Mexico City in 1986.
   ``I know there was a contract on me,'' Martinez said, explaining
that in FBI jargon, a contract ``means someone's out to get you''
and sabotage your career.
   Martinez testified that he had been discriminated against, and
that he did not believe the incident would have happened were he
non-Hispanic or Mormon. Walser did not return an Associated Press
phone call to his office Wednesday.
   The 311 Hispanic agents who have joined the lawsuit being tried
in U.S. District Court contend the FBI discriminates against
Hispanics in hiring, promoting and disciplining. They want damages
and a change in the way the FBI promotes agents and handles
discrimination complaints.
   About 400 of the FBI's 9,000 special agents are Hispanic, or 4.4
percent. Nationally, 8 percent of the population is Hispanic.
   Martinez said Walser accused him of a security violation; the
agent did not specify what it was. Martinez was demoted and
assigned to Los Angeles _ a post he asked not to be assigned to
``because I knew Hispanic agents there had complained about Mormon
superiors.''
   Before Martinez was transferred from Mexico City, he filed an
internal equal employment opportunity complaint protesting Walser's
actions. He said he found out later that the chief of the equal
employment opportunity office mailed the confidential complaint to
Walser.
   Martinez said he appealed his demotion and transfer, and the FBI
did not resist. He was reinstated to his previous grade and
transferred to Washington, where he works in the same division as
Walser, he said.
   When defense attorney Alan Ferber reminded Martinez that Walser
has adopted four Mexican children and that his brother-in-law is
Hispanic, Martinez said he studied Mormon theology to further
understand Walser.
   ``The Book of Mormon says Mexican-Americans are cursed with dark
skin and are defiled,'' Martinez said. ``It says when they are
brought into the church, they become white and delightsome.''
   Martinez said he believes Walser is biased against Hispanics,
but that he did not know whether the alleged bias is based on
religious belief.
   Ferber said Walser likely will be called as a defense witness
next week. In his opening arguments Monday, Ferber prominently
mentioned Walser's adoption of four Mexican children and implied it
would be a central argument in the FBI's defense.
   Plaintiff co-counsel Hugo Rodriguez said Wednesday that other
agents with complaints about Mormon superiors are expected to be
called.

<HEAD>Chinese Leader Says Plan Would Free State Enterprises</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM ABRAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chinese leader Zhao Ziyang said the Politburo was
working on a five-year economic plan that would allow state-run
enterprises more autonomy, but he added that inflation threatens
reform, news reports said Wednesday.
   Zhao, general secretary of the Communist Party, also said the
first Chinese-Soviet summit meeting in three decades is possible if
Moscow first urges Vietnam to withdraw its troops from Cambodia.
The statement represented a softening of previous Chinese stances.
   Vietnam has announced plans to withdraw 50,000 troops, half of
its force, from Cambodia by the end of the year and the rest by
early 1990.
   Zhao's remarks came Tuesday in an interview with Shinji Sakai,
president of Japan's Kyodo News Service, at the coastal resort of
Beidaihe. They were reported Wednesday by Kyodo staff members who
attended and the official Chinese Xinhua News Agency.
   Zhao, a leading proponent of economic reform with senior leader
Deng Xiaoping, said the Politburo was convened Monday to discuss
the comprehensive five-year program. The Politburo is China's
highest decision-making body.
   The general secretary said the package would be adopted in
principle by the Politburo and could be put into effect starting at
the beginning of next year.
   Zhao said the government will give priority to reform of
state-run enterprises _ giving them more independence and making
them liable for losses. The key to better efficiency lies in making
all enterprises compete for markets, promoting the better ones and
eliminating the inferior ones, he said.
   China's state-run enterprises operate under the control of local
party officials and central planners. The nation's private
enterprises already enjoy a large measure of autonomy.
   Zhao also told the Japanese that price reform, another key goal,
cannot succeed unless the economy becomes more efficient.
   The government is moving to lift price controls and let prices
be determined by market value, but producers cannot keep up with
rising demand. He said the problem helped push consumer inflation
rates to near 20 percent in the first half of the year.
   ``Whether we can in the course of reform check excessive price
rises will be the deciding factor in whether the reform program for
the next year is carried out smoothly,'' Zhao said. ``Sharp
inflation could erode people's confidence in economic reform.''
   The government raised interest rates on loans and savings
accounts Tuesday in an effort to discourage capital investment and
encourage personal savings. State banks have also announced they
will curtail loans to cool off the economy, which grew at an
excessively rapid pace of 11 percent in the first half of the year.
   Zhao denied reports in the foreign press that the annual summer
policy meetings at the Beidaihe resort broke down in late July
because of a split over how to handle rising prices.
   ``We didn't even have a meeting then,'' he said. ``How could we
suspend it?''
   The general secretary said in regard to Chinese-Soviet relations
that the Soviet stance on Vietnam's withdrawal from Cambodia
remains the key to whether a Chinese-Soviet summit will take place
in the near future.
   In saying that a summit hinged only on Moscow's urging Vietnam
to leave Cambodia, Zhao appeared to tone down China's past tough
conditions for high-level talks. Previously, China stressed that
the Soviet Union must first bring about an actual withdrawal by
exerting its influence.
   Zhao said he was confident senior leaders from the two countries
will meet when conditions are ripe.
   Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev has sought an end to decades of
hostility between the two communist giants and proposed a summit
with Deng and other Chinese leaders.
   Deng, however, has said he will meet Gorbachev only when the
Kremlin removes what China calls the ``three obstacles,''
particularly Soviet support for Vietnam's invasion of Cambodia.
   The other two obstacles, now being lifted, are Soviet troops in
Afghanistan and military tensions along the Chinese-Soviet border.
   China, the main backer of the communist Khmer Rouge and other
resistance forces fighting the 10-year occupation by Vietnam, and
the Soviet Union will meet with Chinese leaders later this month to
discuss the Cambodian question for the first time.
   Zhao said he hoped the vice minister-level talks would resolve
differences between the two countries in one session. He gave no
date.

   A storm that stalled over the metropolitan area
dumped up to 2 inches of rain Wednesday afternoon, flooding
Interstate 25 with two feet of standing water and closing the
highway at rush hour.
   I-25, the main north-south route through Colorado, bisects the
southern Denver area.
   Mike Baker of the National Weather Service said that at one
measuring point 2 inches of rain fell in a two-hour period, and
most of it within 60 minutes. He said there were other rainfall
reports of .81 within an hour and .54 within an hour in the
metropolitan area.
   Baker said the storm remained stationary over the region for
about an hour.
   Police said roads throughout the area were closed temporarily
and motorists were stranded, but no major accidents were reported.

   Rain and floods in central Shaanxi province
killed 163 people, bringing the toll of storm-related deaths this
year to more than 1,600, the official Xinhua News Agency said
Wednesday.
   It said the latest weekend storm set off mountain torrents that
destroyed 3,000 homes, 14,326 acres of farmland, 167 miles of roads
and 16 bridges.
   The government air-dropped food supplies to stranded people,
according to the Central Flood Control Headquarters.
   It said typhoons and floods have caused $1.2 billion in damage
in the first seven months of the year.
   In Henan province east of Shaanxi, rains and flash floods killed
34 people and destroyed 20,000 homes over the past nine days,
according to Radio Beijing, monitored in Tokyo.
   In northeastern Heilongjiang province, Xinhua said 120,000
people are working to buttress the banks of the rain-swollen Nen

   A Moscow city court convicted two men of smashing
46 Jewish gravestones, the weekly newspaper Moscow News said
Wednesday, after the vandalism raised fears of a tide of
anti-Semitism.
   The paper said survivors were divided on whether the attack at
Moscow's Vostryakovo Cemetery stemmed from anti-Semitism or
represented only a random act.
   Moscow News, which reported the May 15 vandalism soon after it
occurred, said Alexander Yershov and Pavel Lyashenko were found
guilty after an emotional trial attended by many survivors of those
whose graves were smashed.
   Yershov and Lyashenko had been drinking beer, cognac and
champagne before and during their visit to the grave of Lyashenko's
father in a different part of the cemetery, the newspaper said.
   It said Yershov was sentenced to 13 months of corrective work at
his workplace and Lyashenko was given a 2{-year term in a labor

officials said no immediate reports were made of injuries or damage.
   The quake registered 6 on the open-ended Richter scale and its
epicenter was about 250 miles north of Jakarta, the capital of

   Excess liquid chlorine leaked into a city
swimming pool Wednesday, sending dozens of people to the hospital
complaining of coughing, burning throats, and stinging eyes,
authorities said.
   Thirty-two people were transported to hospital emergency rooms
in ambulances and police vans, said E.F. Fowler, a district fire
chief. Ten people were admitted to hospitals for observation
overnight, but no serious injuries were reported.
   Some victims were administered oxygen by firefighters and
Emergency Medical Services personnel who responded. Other victims
were taken to personal doctors or hospitals by relatives or friends.
   Jack Duncan, city director of parks and recreation, said the
problem was in the pool's circulation system, which filters and
treats the water. City officials were still conducting their
investigation late Wednesday, he said.
   The pool was closed immediately after the leak, which was
reported at 11:34 a.m.
   About a cubic yard of the chlorine, which is added to water as a
disinfectant, had leaked before the system was shut off, Fowler
said. Although it was discharged into the water, the chlorine
quickly mixed with the air.
   ``It was a small amount as far as chlorine leaks,'' Fowler said.
``When we got there, it had dissipated.''
   Jane M. Caldwell of Raleigh said she was in the pool with her
8-month-old daughter, Maura, when lifeguards yelled for swimmers to
get out. Part of the pool began turning yellow, she said.
   E.C. Neal of Raleigh said he was in the pool with his 8-year-old
daughter, Jennifer.
   ``In the shower room the smell of the gas was really strong,''
he said. ``Lucky this was not on a weekend when there are a lot of
people here.''

<HEAD>Three Chilean Labor Leaders Convicted For Calling Strike</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court on Wednesday convicted
three labor leaders of violating internal security laws for calling
a national strike that challenged the economic policies of military
leader Augusto Pinochet.
   The strike led to anti-government riots in which three people
died.
   In another case, the court upheld a ruling that journalist
Fernando Paulsen be tried on charges of slandering the armed
forces, and a military prosecutor ordered opposition politician
Felipe Sandoval arrested on similar charges.
   Leaders of the National Workers' Command, Chile's main labor
confederation, called an illegal general strike on Oct. 7 to
protest the economic policies of Pinochet's right-wing military
government.
   The court on Wednesday ordered Workers' Command President Manuel
Bustos confined for 541 days to the city of Parral, about 210 miles
south of Santiago, and his vice president, Arturo Martinez,
confined for the same amount of time to the town of Channaral,
about 600 miles north of the Chilean capital.
   The court issued a 60-day suspended sentence for the labor
movement's strike coordinator, Moises Labrana.
   A lower court dismissed the charges, but the prosecutors
appealed to the Supreme Court, which overturned the earlier ruling.
   The high court upheld a ruling calling for Paulsen to face a
military trial on charges of slandering the armed forces. Paulsen
is deputy director of the leftist opposition magazine Analysis,
which published an article suggesting that the military accepted an
inflated price in buying navy helicopters.
   A military prosecutor ordered the arrest of Sandoval, a leader
of the Christian Democratic Party's youth wing, on charges of
slandering the armed forces in a television appearance.
   Chilean law allows military prosecutors to order arrests.

   Polish folk dancer Sigmund Irinauch came out of
hiding Wednesday and said it was harassment, not love, that caused
him to defect to Israel.
   In his first public appearance since he disappeared in Haifi,
Israel, on Aug. 9, the 29-year-old Irinauch said he left Poland
because authorities hounded his family after he helped organize
labor strikes.
   He denied earlier reports by Israeli newspapers and Haifa police
that he defected because he fell in love with an Israeli dancer he
met two years ago at a folk dancing festival in Canada.
   ``I would like very much to return to Poland, but I think it
will be better both for me and for my family if I stay here,'' said
Irinauch, who wore a white polo shirt and spoke through a Polish
interpreter on Israel Television.
   ``The reasons for my defection have to do only with me and my
family, and they are much more serious (than his reported
romance).''
   The woman's friends said earlier she told him she was engaged
before he came to Israel, but he decided to defect anyway. They
said the woman and her fiance agreed to help Irinauch defect.
   Irinauch said his problems with communist authorities began
after he helped organize workers' strikes in April and May in his
native Krakow.
   ``I was a law student, and we organized protests,'' he said. ``I
was one of the chief organizers and was chosen to represent the
rest before the authorities. As a result, the authorities started
to harass not only me but my family as well.''
   He gave no details about what form the harassment took.
   The Krakow strikes were part of a 15-day national wave of labor
unrest. Security police put down the strike at the Lenin steelworks
outside Krakow on May 5, arresting 38 people.
   Irinauch said his maternal grandmother is Jewish, which means he
too is Jewish by Israeli law and therefore would qualify for
automatic citizenship.
   He said he decided to live at the Ayelet Hashachar kibbutz, or
collective farm, in northern Galilee and enrolled in an intensive
Hebrew class. Irinauch said he chose the kibbutz because it offered
foreign volunteers work, room and board.
   Irinauch came to Israel with the 46-member Slovianki Polish folk
dancing troupe and was described as one of its star dancers.
   Troupe members, who were performing at a folk festival in Haifa,
searched for Irinauch for hours before departing for Poland last
week. The dancer left them a note telling them he was staying
behind.

   Ten-year-old Heather Ostrom, a rock-music fan
who likes singing to large audiences, drew thunderous cheers at the
Republican National Convention on Wednesday with her rendition of
the national anthem.
   ``Glad it's over!'' the Bonney Lake, Wash., girl cried to her
mother, Carolee, when she bounced away from the podium. ``I sounded
froggy, like Peewee Herman.''
   Heather, a professional singer since she was 5, belted out ``The
Star-Spangled Banner'' a cappella with a country lilt. When she was
through, she flashed a shy grin, and the place erupted with
applause.
   She admitted to a slight case of nerves.
   ``It was really a neat experience, but when you're starting to
sing it, it's scary. You don't ever get used to it. But when I got
started, it was just great,'' she said in an interview after she
joined the Washington state delegation on the convention floor,
receiving hugs and congratulations.
   ``I really like singing before larger audiences than to two or
three people,'' said Heather, a blonde clad in a new white knit and
lace dress.
   The national anthem is fun to sing ``because of all the high
notes'' and isn't as difficult as many people think, she said.
   But she confided, ``I do get a little tired of it.''
   Heather often appears with her 11-year-old sister Kirsten and
their mother. The three sang for about 15 minutes as delegates
arrived at the convention hall, performing mostly pop and
inspirational music.
   Heather said she prefers rock music, probably will become an
artist rather than an entertainer and listed ``my mom and my
sister'' as her favorite singers.
   She said her older sister wasn't jealous that she was invited to
sing at the convention by Republican National Committee Chairman
Frank Fahrenkopf, who learned of the family from state party
chairman Jennifer Dunn.
   ``It all evens out _ she got to do the David Letterman Show,''
said Heather, who will be a fifth grader this fall.

   The rich soil of the Red River Valley
normally produces 40 bushels of red spring wheat per acre, helping
make Canada the world's second-largest wheat exporter. The drought
of 1988 has changed that.
   Things are worse in southern Saskatchewan, the country's major
wheat producer. Many farmers failed to get any crop at all in
conditions likened to the dust bowl of the 1930s. Wheat and barley
yields overall will be 50 percent below normal. In Alberta,
Canada's other breadbasket province, the weather has been whimsical
to the point of perversity. Southern areas felt the full impact of
the drought while farmers in the northern Peace River region had 22
inches of rain and could collect bumper crops if their fields dried
out long enough for harvesting.
   Across the prairies, experts predict a harvest down at least 30
percent from last year, and that means Canada's 105,000 grain
farmers will find it harder to fill orders from the Soviet Union,
Japan, China and other traditional markets.

   Israel on Thursday outlawed grass-roots

than 250 Arabs in four days of unrest in the occupied Gaza Strip.
   Also on Thursday, Palestinians launched a two-day general strike

deems activists in the eight-month uprising. Word of the impromptu
strike was passed around the West Bank by masked youths, many of
whom shouted their message on loudspeakers.
   A three-day curfew was lifted before dawn Thursday from much of
the Gaza Strip, but 180,000 Arabs in 11 refugee camps and
neighborhoods remained confined to their homes. In addition, 85,000
West Bank Palestinians from nine villages and camps were under

   ``We're ready to go launch,'' Alan McDonald, Morton Thiokol vice

   The $20 million firing was a ``redundancy verification test'' to

contain super-heated gases during launch. The failure of the seals

predicts that 80 percent of the marshes in the 164,000-acre refuge
will be dried up by the end of the summer.
   Racked by back-to-back drought years that have distilled the
wetlands to a suffocating, toxin-ridden stew, the refuge 60 miles
east of Reno has become a murky grave to more than 7 million fish
and 2,000 birds in the past 18 months.

<HEAD>Lee Horsley Returns to Series TV in Western for CBS</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHRYN BAKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When Lee Horsley was starring in ``Matt
Houston,'' it just wasn't done for a TV actor to cross over into
films.
   ``Now seems to be the wonderful time to cross over from
television into feature films. Everybody seems to do it,'' said
Horsley, who will star this season in the CBS Western, ``Paradise.''
   ``Back when `Houston' was on the air, you couldn't get arrested
if you were on television. It was unheard-of. No one would touch
you. That was tough. Going out and trying to have a feature career
after havin' a television show.''
   So he cheered when friend and co-TV detective hunk Tom Selleck
finally scored last year with the feature film ``Three Men and a
Baby'' after several attempts at movie success.
   ``Tom's great, a neat, neat guy, and I was glad it happened,''
Horsley said.
   Horsley would still like to cross over into feature films. He
starred in the cult favorite ``The Sword and the Sorcerer,'' but
otherwise found TV miniseries, such as ``Crossings,'' and theater
more available. He was interviewed in New York recently during a
run with ``Mack and Mabel'' in New Jersey.
   Horsley became popular in the detective series ``Matt Houston,''
but actually started out in musical theater, appearing in the road
productions of ``West Side Story, ``Oklahoma!'' and ``1776,'' among
others.
   He was born in the quaintly named Muleshoe, a small West Texas
town, but was raised in Colorado and considers it home, though he
and his family live in Los Angeles.
   He's an avid horseman and had wanted to do a Western ``forever.''
   ``I've just been crazy for the Western to come back, and I hope
that this is a ticket to it. I really hope it will work.''
   Horsley plays Ethan Cord, a mysterious former gunfighter who
inherits his late sister's four children, sent to him in the
depressed mining town where their mother thought he was a
successful merchant.
   The romantic interest is a local businesswoman, played by Sigrid
Thornton (of ``The Man from Snowy River''), who is cool toward Cord
but begins to warm toward the children.
   ``This particular show, the reason it's so exciting is it really
has all the elements I like,'' Horsley said. ``It has that
possibility of going in those directions _ the good guy and the bad
guy, the Code, the relationship with the kids. There's so many
wonderful ways to round it out that I think is real special, so I'm
real excited.
   ``To be able to work with two of my favorite things, kids and
horses, that's not all bad either. It's outdoors, which I love. I'm
a little bit claustrophobic. The thought of going back to episodic
television and being on a soundstage seven days a week did not
appeal to me.''
   The show will have an uphill battle in the ratings. CBS is
putting it on Thursday against NBC's hit comedy lineup. It's
lead-in will be the CBS News documentary series ``48 Hours,'' which
hasn't scored very high in the ratings.
   Horsley said he's been approached to do movie Westerns, but he
turned them down. ``It's amazing how badly written some of these
Westerns are,'' he said.
   David Jacobs and Robert Porter co-created ``Paradise.''
   ``They do not look like cowboys, so I got a little concerned,''
Horsley joked. ``But the dialogue is right on the money. It's
better than anything I've ever come up with as far as the flavor,
and being a Western buff myself, there's not too much that gets
by.''
   The show seems to have elements of ``Shane'' in it, not to
mention the potential for the subtle romance of ``Gunsmoke.''
   Horsley said he was concerned about returning to ``the episodic
triangle,''
   ``But I guess now I am ready to do it again, and I'm especially
excited about this show. It's one that hopefully if all goes well
will be comfortable to run for a period of time.
   ``Being a period piece it's certainly not going to get stuck
with your standard private-detective kind of syndrome. It takes a
long time to beat after you do something like that, so I think all
the right elements are there.
   ``Also, I'm gettin' older,'' he said, ``an older daddy. And
episodic's pretty comfortable.''

   ENGLUND'S `NIGHTMARE'' CONTINUES... Robert Englund, the
classically trained actor who's made a career recently out of

<HEAD>A Singing Legend Wants All to Know: She's Still Here</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT WOLF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It's a song that nightly rouses theater audiences.
It's also the title of Eartha Kitt's impending book.
   After four decades in a career filled with fame and misfortune,
Kitt wants all to know: ``I'm Still Here.''
   ``I sing the song because it relates to my own experience,'' the
veteran performer said of her second-act show-stopper in
``Follies,'' Stephen Sondheim's 1971 musical, which has been
running for more than a year at London's Shaftesbury Theater.
   ``That's why it's wonderful when I see young people coming
around asking for an autograph. It makes me feel as if I'm still
here,'' she said.
   She joined the cast July 4, replacing Dolores Gray as the
hard-bitten Carlotta, a woman who turns the memory of her ``good
times and bum times'' into a classic Broadway hymn to resilience.
   Kitt has parlayed her own ``bum times'' into a career that rode
out divorce and political harassment to find her making her London
musical debut at what she thinks, but isn't sure, is the age of 60.
   ``All I knew was I had to survive because I was being abused by
everybody that came along and anybody I was thrown to,'' she said.
   Her life has made headlines as often as her work.
   Kitt was born on a cotton plantation in South Carolina, the
illegitimate child of a half-black, half-Indian woman who was raped
by the white son of the plantation owner. When she was five, she
was sent to live with an aunt in Harlem _ a time marked by poverty
and hunger.
   The difficulties continued even when her burgeoning career
brought the money that comes with fame. Her marriage in the 1960s
to William McDonald ended in an acrimonious divorce.
   In 1968, she denounced the Vietnam War in front of Lady Bird
Johnson, wife of the late President Lyndon B. Johnson, in a remark
that led to a CIA dossier denouncing Kitt as ``a sadistic
nymphomaniac with a vile tongue.''
   Today, thoughts of these events leave her bemused as much as
bitter.
   ``Why did they make such a furor over a little person like
myself?'' she said, pausing during the interview to focus on the
needlepoint seat cushion she is making, or to tend to her
6-week-old pet dove named Folly.
   ``I was ostracized for telling the truth,'' she said. ``You're
asked a particular question and you expect them to want to hear
your particular opinion, and when the truth rings against their
ears ... you get knocked out of the box.''
   Kitt found work difficult to come by after the CIA allegations.
But 1978 proved a turning-point of sorts, when she returned to
Broadway in the musical ``Timbuktu!'' and was invited back to the
White House by President Jimmy Carter.
   However, the White House invitation failed to provide the
necessary balm.
   ``I'm still waiting for the government to say I'm sorry,'' she
said. ``America is supposed to be run by the people for the people,
not by one schnook in the White House.
   ``I don't think America should be run by one person anymore.
She's gotten too big and spread herself out too much,'' she said.
``She's dissipated herself from the inside, and if she allows it to
continue, she's not going to have anything left for us, the
citizens of the country.''
   The marriage last year of her only daughter has left her feeling
lonely and vulnerable.
   ``I always worked because there was somebody I could do
something for, like my daughter,'' said Kitt, dabbing at her eye
with a handkerchief. ``Now, she's gone, and it hurts. It's one of
the feelings I'm writing about in the book.''
   ``I'm Still Here'' is the third memoir she has written. It is to
be published in Britain in September 1989, by Sidgwick and Jackson.
   ``It never becomes remote, no,'' she said of her past. ``The
pains are too great.''
   But despite ``the empty-nest syndrome,'' Kitt takes solace in
her fans and her work, and in being back in England.
   ``Paris and London are the places that made me realize there is
an Eartha Kitt inside of me somewhere,'' said the performer, who
first came to London in 1949 as a dancer with Katherine Dunham's
troupe.
   ``The British people helped me cultivate my own sense of humor
and not be afraid of it. You're not as easily forgotten in these
countries as we are in America.
   ``It amazes me that wherever I go, the public is there,'' she
said. ``Believe me, no one's more grateful than I am.''

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Never has the Federal Reserve Board made an
interest-rate decision that wasn't controversial, and its latest
one _ a half percentage point increase to 6.5 percent in the
discount rate _ continues the tradition.
   Perhaps the most controversial aspect of it was the timing _
right before a presidential election, a sensitive time politically
and economically and, therefore, a time when the Fed usually does
not jiggle the economic levers.
   Moreover, it came just days after Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan
extolled the economy's health before Congress, offering little
suggestion at the time that any quick action was needed on interest
rates.
   But, as it was in the past and most likely will be in the
future, the most detailed controversy is coming not from politics
but from the field of economics itself, where seldom is heard a
noncontroversial word.
   Among the disputes is whether the Fed acted pre-emptively to
rein in the economy before it began straining; or after the fact,
that is, merely to catch up with increases that already had
occurred in other interest rates.
   Some say the Fed's constraint saved the economy. Others say it
has given business a case of jitters that could curtail production.
Some say it could pitch the economy headlong into its first
official recession in six years.
   ``If the intent of the discount rate increase was to settle down
the market, the Fed missed the mark,'' says Dale Stuard, president
of the National Associaiton of Home Builders. It over-reacted to
inflation, he contends.
   Others, such as Wright Investors' Service, express a sense of
confusion over the move, observing that consumer spending already
had slowed from an annual rate of 4.4 percent two years ago to just
half that over the past year.
   Economic strength currently derives from business fixed
investment and net exports _ they accounted for half the economic
growth in the past year _ prompting Wright to ask if these were not
areas to be encouraged, not stifled.
   It was widely believed that such was, in fact, the Fed's policy,
and that it was being fulfilled; that is, the economy was in the
process of shifting to manufacturing and exports from consumer
goods and services.
   A commonly expressed fear is that the Fed conceivably might have
focused undue attention on the inflation threat, setting off a
psychological reaction that could reinforce and accelerate the rise
of interest rates.
   As Wright observes, the inflation threat is not clearcut. The 83
percent factory utilization rate and the jobless rate of around 5.4
percent are typical of levels that existed prior to 1970, a period
when inflation was relatively tame.
   Not only had consumer spending been moderating but home-buying
plans had turned mediocre, a trend the National Association of
Realtors termed a reaction to interest rate increases that already
had taken place.
   With such evidence of moderating pressure, therefore, why the
sudden, forceful and unexpected move by the Fed? Pondering that
question, said Stuard, could produuce a good case of jitters that
``could push rates even higher.''
   Paul Havemann, vice president of HSH Associates of Riverdale,
N.J., which calls itself the country's largest publisher of
mortgage information, tends to agree.
   ``The ... quick speed with which lenders raised their rates is
something of an overreaction,'' he said.
   ``We've seen this happen before: The stock market has trouble
digesting two such events, so they overreact. That spills over into
the credit markets, and lenders _ closely tied to those markets _
are carried along.''
   The financial and economic people might continue to argue in
this way, never reaching a consensus on whether the Fed was right
or wrong. But that is the nature of economics.
   Economists are used to an indefinite world. It is the political
people who want answers. They will strive to understand the Fed's
action, but they might strive in vain.
   The Fed does not try to explain its actions.

<HEAD>A Land Where Ecumenism is a Fighting Word</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: AP writer Rick Hampson covered the peace pilgrimage led by
Cardinal O'Connor to Ireland in late July.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By RICK HAMPSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It was to have been the highlight of Cardinal
John O'Connor's ``peace pilgrimage'' to Northern Ireland: an
ecumenical service at the Cathedral of St. Patrick where Catholics
and Protestants, historic antagonists in Ulster, would pray
together for peace.
   But when the New York archbishop and several hundred other
American pilgrims arrived at the cathedral in Armagh on July 25,
Protestants were almost as scarce as the snakes Patrick is reputed
to have driven from the island centuries ago.
   The only Protestant on the altar was a retired Church of Ireland
bishop, and although several ministers sat with the congregation,
they asked that their names not be released.
   On his flight back to New York, however, the cardinal said he
was not surprised. To explain, he recalled his last visit to
Northern Ireland in 1984, saying:
   ``We had a dinner with a bunch of Protestant clergy, probably 20
or 30 of us in all. It was very amiable, very constructive. But
before it was over, one of them, who appeared to be speaking for
many, said, `You know, if my people even knew that I was having
dinner with you, they would disown me'.
   ``Now, I think enough of that continues (so) that those clergy
who came to the service in Armagh ... felt it was a little much at
this time for them to go up into the sanctuary.''
   The Armagh service showed that Ulster is one of the few places
in Christendom where many Protestants, especially Presbyterians,
still see ecumenism as a threat.
   Although O'Connor had invested much hope in the pilgrimage's
three ecumenical services, only the one in Armagh occurred in an
area where Catholic-Protestant relations are tense.
   That, however, was where the Protestant response was weakest _
possibly because the pilgrimage coincided with the Anglican
Church's Lambeth Conference in England, which many Protestant
leaders attended as participants or observers; possibly because of
the pilgrimage's distinctly Catholic character.
   Whatever the excuse, the fact remains that ecumenism remains a
fighting word in Northern Ireland.
   The province's most famous politician-preacher, the Rev. Ian
Paisley, went to the Vatican (``Harlot City,'' he terms it) in 1963
to protest the ecumenical council called by Pope John XXIII. And he
marched illegally on Belfast City Hall to protest the lowering of
the flag when the pope died.
   When a Presbyterian minister walked across the street five years
ago to extend Christmas greetings at the local Catholic church, he
was nearly fired, and his family was threatened. Paisley's
followers accused him of ``ecumenical tendencies.''
   Protestants like Paisley regard ecumenism as a Catholic plot to
weaken Protestant resolve and trick them into accepting the
unification of the province, which has a 2-1 Protestant majority,
with the predominantly Catholic Irish Republic to the south.
   The pilgrimage's other ecumenical services _ at the Shrine of
Our Lady of Knock and at Christ Church, Dublin _ took place in the
republic, where interdenominational relations are relatively good.
   ``The clergy here have no problems, no problems at all,'' Dean
James Grant, a local Church of Ireland minister, said after the
service at Knock. ``We get along here, and if this is reported in
the North, it may help there.'' But the North, he allowed, was
something else again.
   Northern Ireland's troubles are really about economics and
politics, not religion. But ``Protestant'' has become shorthand for
``Unionist'' _ one who wants Ulster to remain part of Great Britain
_ and ``Catholic'' has become synonymous with ``Nationalist'' _ one
who wants a united Ireland.
   In Dublin, the pilgrims were offered a final reminder of how
long Protestants and Catholics have been feuding in Ireland when
they attended Mass at St. Mary's Pro-Cathedral.
   Asked what the term ``pro-cathedral'' meant, an O'Connor aide
said it was a temporary designation, usually for a church that is
being used while the cathedral is under construction or repair.
   But St. Mary's has been a pro-cathedral since its construction
in 1825; the original cathedral, Christ Church, was lost when the
Church of England broke with Rome in the 16th century, and the
Vatican has never revoked the cathedral's consecration.
   So the Catholic archbishop of Dublin still sits in a
pro-cathedral, four centuries after the Protestant Reformation. In
Ireland, that's only yesterday.

   Roman Catholic bishops have approved a
one-month criterion as a guide on the time that should elapse when
sufficient priests are not available to hear individual confession
before allowing general absolution.
   Church law says general absolution _ extending forgiveness to a
group without individual confession _ should be allowed only when
there is serious need, such as conditions preventing individual
confession and absolution for ``a long time.''
   Results of a mailed ballot among bishops brought those approving
the one-month rule to 205, to 72 against, more than the required
two-thirds majority. The decision was subject to approval by the
Vatican.

<HEAD>U.S.-Soviet Friendship Exchanges on Increase</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BITTE LARSSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Young Americans and Soviets are getting
together more and more these days _ at high school proms and
conferences and in organizations that range from orchestras to
peace groups.
   It's ``citizen diplomacy,'' says Valentin Seveus, a Swede who
runs a three-way exchange program for teen-agers from the United
States, the Soviet Union and neutral Sweden.
   ``In the United States there is a wish to show that the Russians
are ordinary people like you and me,'' he said. ``It is an
extremely important thing.''
   The Soviets, under Mikhael S. Gorbachev's glasnost (openness)
policy, want to open their country to the outside world, and their
programs often are organized under the banner of peace, said
Seveus, who operates out of Stockholm.
   Swedes, who cultivate their non-aligned position to pursue
issues like peace and disarmament, actively promote such projects.
   ``It's always easy to reach people when you work with peace,''
Seveus said.
   U.S.-Soviet exchange programs were cut off by the United States
when relations soured after the 1979 Soviet invasion of
Afghanistan. The contacts were renewed under a cultural agreement
signed by President Reagan and Gorbachev at the 1985 U.S.-Soviet
summit meeting in Geneva.
   Liza Malott of Reagan's U.S.-Soviet Exchange Initiative said
about 100,000 Americans are now going to the Soviet Union annually,
mostly on private tours, in contrast to 10,000 Soviets who visited
the United States last year.
   The proportion is even more lopsided when it comes to youth, but
the number of youngsters is climbing on both sides, Ms. Malott said.
   Seveus, 46, founded Cooperation for Peace in 1983 to promote
student get-togethers through summer camps or conferences, working
through parallel Soviet and U.S. organizations. Teen-agers from
Poland, India and other countries also have taken part.
   Seveus' latest program, Peace Quest, brought 50 teen-agers
together for six weeks visiting each others' U.S., Soviet and
Swedish hometowns.
   On a stopover in Sweden, the Americans said their visit to the
Soviet Union had changed some of their preconceptions. They visited
private Soviet homes, looked in on the Supreme Soviet of the
Republic of Ukraine and met with representatives of the Russian
Orthodox Church and youth groups.
   ``They took us very seriously and we freely discussed everything
... with straight answers,'' said a group leader, Elisabeth
Bentley, a nurse from Barre, Mass.
   ``Peace work at this stage in the U.S. is so new,'' she added.
``We would like them to go back (home) and get involved, make
speeches, form clubs ... you know, throw a stone in the water with
all the ripples.''
   ``It's been fantastic,'' said one traveling youth, Andy De
Braber, 17, of Grand Rapids, Mich. ``In a few weeks so much has
happened, it's almost hard to absorb.''
   Ina Dubovik, 17, an English major from Minsk, U.S.S.R., said she
joined the tour as a way to ``fight for peace.'' As the leader of
her school's International Club, she said she was looking forward
to reporting back on her experiences.
   Ms. Dubovik said the members of her group were leaders in Soviet
youth groups or international clubs.
   Another American group leader, Susanne Sklar, 30, of Chicago,
called the Soviet youth the future ambassadors and leaders of their
country.
   The Soviet press closely covered the group, she said, and
members were on Soviet television and radio several times.
   One of the breakthroughs in the youth exchanges was the case of
Samantha Smith, an 11-year-old Maine schoolgirl.
   In 1983, she won the hearts of millions of Soviets when she
visited at the invitation of the late Yuri V. Andropov, then the
Soviet president, whom she had written about her concerns of
superpower tension. She died in a plane crash two years later.

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Professor Josiah Thompson is an expert on
such noted philosophers as Kierkegaard, Nietzsche _ and Sam Spade.
   Spade? What in the name of Humphrey Bogart is going on here? A
career change, that's what.
   In 1976, Thompson, driven by a ``thirst for experience,'' left
his tenured position as professor of philosophy at Haverford
College _ a prestigous Quaker school in Pennsylvania, came to San
Francisco and became a private detective.
   He couldn't have picked a better city in which to set up shop.
   San Francisco's hills are steeped in the lore of Dashiell
Hammett and his legendary sleuth, Sam Spade, the ``blond Satan''
whose hair darkened when brought to the screen by Humphrey Bogart
in ``The Maltese Falcon.''
   There's even a bronze plaque on a San Francisco street,
recalling a murder that took place only in Hammett's mind: ``On
approximately this spot Miles Archer, partner of Sam Spade, was
done in by Brigid O'Shaughnessy.''
   Thompson, whose previous writings were mostly limited to the
academic world, has recounted his metamorphosis in a book
appropriately called ``Gumshoe: Reflections in a Private Eye''
(Little, Brown, $17.95).
   He was born 53 years ago in East Liverpool, Ohio, where his
father sold dishes. During World War I, his father took a pair of
field glasses from a dead German and gave them to the youngster.
   Thompson, whose nickname is Tink, still uses the glasses on
cases. He keeps them hanging over his desk and has used them on
stakeouts.
   Even though slightly built, he played halfback in high school,
closing his eyes ``on every play.'' Later, he was under fire in
Lebanon as an ensign with a Navy Underwater Demolition Team, the
elite Frogmen.
   Why did he become a professor in the first place, going from
football bruises and the sound of warfare to the safety of a
college campus?
   ``I had plenty of money when I got out of the Navy, with
demolition and combat pay,'' he said. ``I was a good student in
high school so I went to Oxford and from there took the line of
least resistance.''
   When that line became a cul-de-sac, he took a sabbatical and
grabbed a job with an established detective agency in San Francisco.
   During his apprenticeship and as his own boss, Thompson has
worked on such headline cases as the defense of Black Panther Huey
Newton on assault and murder charges, and the defense of William
and Emily Harris in the Patty Hearst case.
   There were also other, less publicized capers, ranging from
recovering $30,000 from under the floorboards of an attic in a drug
case to retrieving a kidnapped child from India.
   Thompson's wife, Nancy, sells real estate. They have two adult
daughters and a son who plays soccer in college. He never carries a
gun and he thinks the most dangerous part of his job is ``mistaken
identity.''
   ``I was taken for a spy on a case in Morocco,'' he said. ``And
one time in Canada, while working on a drug case, word got around
that a hit man was being brought in. When people heard I was from
California, some of them thought I was the guy. The bars would
clear when I came in.''
   While honing his skills as a gumshoe, Thompson has become
fascinated by Hammett and Spade, so much so that on one case he
took the time to interview some of Hammett's relatives.
   Hammett, through Spade, was a bit of a philosopher, he says.
   ``In order to love, one must put off hardness and shiftiness,''
Thompson said. ``The ability to lie effectively, to appear
different than one really is, all the disguises essential in the
world of power, become, in the world of love, temptations, artful
excuses to avoid the nakedness love requires, to avoid love.''
   Hammett knew this, he said.
   ``That's why in the last line of The Maltese Falcon he makes
Spade `shiver' as he looks down the cold barrel of his future.''

<HEAD>Promotions for TV News: Too Cute, Coy, Concocted?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD DE ATLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a television news commercial filmed in
documentary style, a camera takes the viewer into a hospital, past
waiting news reporters in the corridors and up to the rooftop
heliport.
   A trench-coated reporter is interviewing an accident victim as
he is being eased onto a stretcher. And the victim has been brought
to the hospital in the news team's helicopter.
   Watch WTNH in New Haven, Conn., and you'll get the story ahead
of everyone else, the announcer explains. Especially the story just
shown. It never happened.
   Across the continent in Los Angeles, viewers of KNBC see news
anchorman John Beard and anchorwoman Linda Alvarez share a fan
letter. The fan says Beard deserves a hug and a ``there, there''
pat when he's telling folks bad news.
   Then Beard reads a compliment for ducking under his desk during
the Oct. 2 earthquake. Wrong anchorman. That was morning news
anchorman Kent Shocknek.``Yo, Kent, mail call,'' Beard says,
rapping the desk top.
   Promotions for television news shows _ cute, coy or concocted _
have slipped out of the narrow restrictions that once dictated that
such spots feature only the depth and capability of the news team.
   The new generation of commercials are forged from years of
behind-the-scenes wars between news and promotion departments. Did
one side win?
   ``I would say it's kind of a meeting of the minds,'' said Jay
Curtis, member services manager of the Broadcast Promotion &
Marketing Executives. ``The advertisements are taking the content
of news and fitting it into the form of promotion.''
   Curtis estimated that concocted news events were featured in 20
percent of the 600 news promotions the BPME received recently for
its gold medallion awards.
   Although the scenario for the WTNH commercial ``was not based on
a specific event, it was indicative of things that happen at
hospitals,'' said WTNH Promotion Manager Donald Cohen. He said
there had been no negative comments from the public or journalists
about the spot.
   WTNH, an ABC affilliate, has been running a neck-and-neck
ratings war with WFSB, the Hartford-based CBS affiliate, Cohen said.
   ``I find that promotion directors use as a litmus test for
themselves whether they can make their news No. 1,'' Curtis said,
adding that the tighter the market, the tougher the promotion
campaign. ``When the news gets the numbers, everything else falls
into place.''
   ``They were a pretty boring station when they hired me,'' said
former KNBC promotion manager Vince Manze, now an executive vice
president with Steve Sohmer, Inc. ``My mandate was to put some life
in the station. The network had taken off, the local station had
not,'' he said.
   Cohen said he was prepared for criticism of the WTNH commercial.
``I was ready to explain the thinking that went behind the spot,
and we were prepared to put the word `dramatization' over it.''
   But Cohen said the viewers of WTNH were sophisticated enough to
understand the commercial was not a real event.
   ``But we wanted to make sure we were doing something that was
actually related to covering the news,'' he said.
   The commercial for KNBC was one of several spots devised by
Chuck Blore and Don Richman Inc. that involves on-camera reporters.
   The first series of ads featured weather reporter Fritz Coleman
and sports reporter Fred Roggin facing off on the basketball court
or marathon course. In the former, Coleman fries Roggin with
lightning after the sportscaster's half-court razzle dazzle.
   The newest KNBC spot features KNBC anchorwomen Kelly Lange and
Colleen Williams discussing the propriety of anchormen and
anchorwomen doing such a commercial. The women decide not to, and
walk off the basketball court.
   ``You can't play around with the news,'' Blore said in an
interview. He said his guidelines for promoting KNBC's news forbade
him from concocting events, but had to grab the attention of the
public. He and KNBC management settled on using personalities from
the station, usually in a scripted comedy piece.
   ``A couple of years ago, it would have been shocking to put news
people in a comedy situation,'' said Blore. ``I was even a little
hesitant about it.'' For one of the commercials, Blore associate
Bill McDonald had to write 19 scripts before finding the right
balance between promoting the news and avoiding perceived
credibility damage.
   The trend is not pleasing to everyone in the industry.
   ``I think it's easy to do bizarre and different and silly
campaigns and avoid the nuts and bolts of what goes into the
news,'' said KABC Los Angeles Director of Advertising and Promotion
Bob Burris.
   His station, rated No. 1 locally, concentrates on the experience
and recognition of its reporters, anchormen and anchorwomen.

   Housing construction rose a moderate 2.4
percent in July, the government reports, but economists warn that
rising mortgage rates could make the two-month housing rebound a

   The Commerce Department said Wednesday that new homes and
apartments were built at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.49
million units last month after advancing 4.4 percent in June.
   Housing starts dropped a sharp 12.1 percent in May to the

   Japan will increase investment in Mexico,
import more Mexican goods and ``seriously consider'' Mexican
proposals for reducing its massive foreign debt, Japanese officials
say.
   On Wednesday, the officials praised Mexico's attempt to
restructure its economy and said Japan, one of the world's
mightiest creditors and exporters, look forward to increasing
imports of Mexican goods.
   Mexico's inflation-fighting plan, a pact between government,

   Two big institutional shareholders of Texaco
Inc. want a voice in nominating directors to Texaco's board, and
some analysts say the move could run into stiff resistance from
Texaco management.
   Officials of the California Public Employee Retirement System
and the New York State Employees Retirement Fund will ask for a
formal, long-term role in choosing Texaco directors. They plan to
make the request at a meeting on Aug. 24 with Texaco President
James W. Kinnear, said Richard Koppes, general counsel of the
California fund, on Wednesday.
   Two seats on the Texaco board are expected to open within the

<HEAD>Housing Starts Up for 2nd Straight Month In July</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The government says housing starts rose for the second straight
month in July, but some economists say rising interests rates could
make the construction rebound short-lived.
   The Commerce Department reported Wednesday that new home and
apartment construction was up 2.4 percent last month after rising
4.4 percent in June.
   Housing starts dropped a sharp 12.1 percent in May, and
economists blamed rising mortgage rates for the slowdown.
   The June-July recovery was attributed to stabilized mortgage
rates, but that trend was thrown into question last week when the
Federal Reserve boosted the discount rate, the interest it charges
for loans to member banks.
   A variety of other interest rates _ including mortgage rates _
moved higher as a result of the Fed action. Fixed-rate mortgages
averaged 10.57 percent nationwide by the end of last week and
analysts predicted mortgages soon would top 11 percent.
   The Commerce Department report had little impact on financial
markets.
   Bond traders brushed off the July figures, and Treasury issues
closed narrowly mixed.
   Meanwhile, the dollar surged against major foreign currencies,
despite action by the Fed and the West German central bank to limit
the dollar's climb against the West German mark.
   On Wall Street, stocks finished mixed in a slow session. The Dow
Jones industrial average closed up 4.45 points to 2,025.96.
   The Commerce Department also reported Wednesday that housing
permits, considered a good barometer of future activity, fell in
July by 5.4 percent to an annual rate of 1.41 million units.
   Economists were pessimistic about the construction report.
   ``I believe we have seen the peak for housing starts this year
as rising interest rates cut into sales,'' said Richard Peach, an
economist with the Mortgage Bankers Association, a trade group.
   Sales of homes and other high-priced items usually are the first
to fall off when the Federal Reserve tries to dampen inflation by
raising interest rates.
   Michael Sumichrast, an economist and publisher of a construction
industry newsletter, said that if mortgage rates climb to 11.5
percent or higher, it could hit the housing industry hard. He said
home sales already have been hurt by big price increases in many
parts of the country.
   Separately, a private survey found fewer housing units were
built during the second quarter of 1988 than the same period a year
ago.
   For the April-June period, new housing construction slipped 9
percent to 406,882 units, compared with 446,955 units built during
the second quarter of 1987, the F.W. Dodge Group of McGraw-Hill
Information Services Co. said.
   George A. Christie, chief economist for F.W. Dodge, said most of
the decline was in rental housing, where high vacancy rates have
hindered new apartment construction.
   Construction of single-family homes remained steady during the
period, he said.

<TEXT>
   Oil futures prices are in the grips of the
summer doldrums, traders say, keeping to a relatively narrow range
amid a lack of market-moving developments.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, oil futures finished mostly
lower Wednesday in dull trading. Contracts for September delivery
of West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude oil,
edged down 2 cents a barrel to close at $15.47. Other contract
months also posted marginal losses.
   Futures prices of refined products traded on the exchange also
fell. Contracts for September delivery of wholesale heating oil
slipped 0.10 cent to finish at 43.93 cents a gallon. September
gasoline rose 0.51 cent to 46.62 cents a gallon, but most other
gasoline contract months declined.
   Analysts said the declines stemmed mainly from technical market
factors rather than any fresh news developments.
   Chris McCormack, an energy futures broker for Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc., said oil prices were unaffected by a report late
Tuesday that U.S. crude stocks fell by 3.6 million barrels,
gasoline inventories rose 1.5 million barrels and distillate stocks
rose 1.4 million barrels in the past week. The weekly data were
compiled by the American Petroleum Institute, an industry group
based in Washington.
   The market also was unimpressed by the API's monthly report
published Wednesday, indicating demand for petroleum products
declined in July but imports reached their highest level in about a
year.

<HEAD>After Prime Hike, What's Next for CDs, Other Bank Products?</HEAD>

   In keeping with the recent rise in the prime
rate, consumers can expect to see comparatively higher rates on
bank products like certificates of deposits or money market
accounts, right?
   Not necessarily, some experts say.
   ``The consumer increasingly is losing out,'' contends Robert K.
Heady, publisher of Bank Rate Monitor, a North Palm Beach, Fla.,
newsletter that tracks bank interest rates. ``It seems to be a
different ballgame in 1988.''
   Heady says banks have been slower than usual this year in
raising their CD and deposit rates to keep pace with increases in
lending rates like the prime, which is used to calculate a wide
range of fixed- and adjustable-rate loans.
   As an example, he uses the period between May 11, the first time
banks raised the prime this year, and Aug. 10, the day before the
latest half-percentage-point increase lifted the key lending rate
to a three-year high of 10 percent.
   During the May 11-Aug. 10 period, the prime rose a full
percentage point, to 9.5 percent from 8.5 percent.
   Six-month CD yields rose on average a half percentage point, to
7.42 percent from 6.92 percent, while 1-year CDs rose about the
same amount, to 7.72 percent from 7.23 percent.
   The 2{-year CD average rose 0.39 point to 8.04 percent from 7.65
percent, and 5-year CDs increased an even smaller 0.28 point to
8.40 percent from 8.12 percent.
   Yields on money market accounts, which averaged 5.69 percent in
May, rose to around 5.83 percent, Heady says.
   Banks and most economist say the current spread is justified for
many reasons.
   To start with, there is the cost of federal deposit insurance
and reserve requirements with which banks have to contend. And
banks have to protect themselves from possible loan defaults.
   Besides, banks and economists say, yields on bank products like
CDs often are set by the prevailing rates in the credit markets.
The spread between long- and short-term rates there has narrowed in
recent months.
   ``You have to take into account the whole structure of interest
rates,'' said Irwin Kellner, chief economist for Manufacturers
Hanover Trust Co. ``The actual cost of money to any bank depends on
funding strategy over the past few weeks and few months.
   ``It's not just simply the latest CD rate ... subtracted by the
prime rate.''
   Moves in the prime rate typically lag changes of almost all
market-related interest rates.
   Still, Edward Yardeni, chief economist for Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc., believes ``there's a little greed involved'' when
it comes to some increases in banks' lending rates, vs. their cost
of funds.
   But ``there's no conspiracy here,'' he adds. ``There's no evil
motivation involved. It's just the way the market works.
   ``If you see an opportunity to make a little money, then you'll
do it.''

<HEAD>U.S. Still Subsidizing Food Exports Despite Drought</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Farm subsidies in the United States and Europe
that were enacted to cope with domestic gluts are continuing even
though the drought has cut stockpiles and raised prices.
   Subsidies encourage overproduction, keep farmers dependent on
their governments for support, hurt farm exports of developing
nations and cost taxpayers billions of dollars.
   The drought created an opportunity to phase out the subsidies by
pushing up worldwide market prices closer to the prices that the
United States and Europeans guarantee to their farmers.
   In fact, though, governments are not curtailing their subsidy
programs. One reason is that since the drought began, the rise in
world prices has made the programs more tolerable because they are
less expensive to finance.
   The drought, in effect, has lessened the budgetary urgency of
curbing farm supports.
   The durability of the farm programs helps explain why
agriculture is such a contentious issue in world trade.
   ``Whenever weather conditions allow you to spend more for farm
programs, you will. Whenever weather conditions allow you to cut
back on spending, you don't. It's a ratchet effect,'' said Robert
Paarlberg, a farm trade expert who teaches at Wellesley College in
Wellesley, Mass.
   If the weather returns to normal, farm subsidies could become
hugely expensive next year because this year's higher prices are
likely to encourage overplanting in Europe, Australia, Argentina,
Brazil and possibly North America.
   If bumper crops push prices down, programs that support prices
will automatically pay heavy subsidies to farmers to protect them
from the consequences of overproduction.
   In contrast, if next year is another drought year, another set
of farm policies aimed at reducing stockpiles could contribute to
shortages and a run-up in prices.
   The U.S. government has been reducing stockpiles to remove an
``overhang'' of inventories that depresses domestic farm prices.
But if crops are small next year, a possible lack of adequate
stockpiles could cause prices to soar.
   The best evidence of the difficulty of reducing farm programs is
the persistence of export subsidies, which both the United States
and Europe use in an expensive battle for foreign customers.
   The drought has led to a reduction _ but not an elimination _ of
the use of the subsidies, which benefit foreign consumers more than
farmers at home.
   The biggest beneficiary of the U.S. Export Enhancement Program
has been the Soviet Union. The Soviets have bought nearly 13
million metric tons of subsidized American wheat since 1985, when
the program was begun to combat subsidies by the European Economic
Community.
   Through the program, the United States gives away food
stockpiles that were purchased with tax dollars in order to help
U.S. exporters offer food at lower prices to customers who might
otherwise buy subsidized European food.
   Since 1985, the program has aided in achieving $5.4 billion in
export sales. But of that, the government contributed food bought
with taxpayer dollars for $2.9 billion.
   While the ostensible purpose of the export program is to keep
U.S. exports competitive in world markets, the program is also used
to get rid of excess farm products that would depress domestic
prices.
   For example, the program has been used to ship more than 60,000
head of dairy cattle to such places as Iraq, Indonesia, Egypt,
Turkey, Morocco and Algeria. The cattle were exported because
slaughtering them for beef would have depressed U.S. beef prices.
   Because of the high cost of transporting live animals,
government subsidies have ranged as high as $1,000 a head on cattle
that are sold overseas for $1,400 a head.
   Seventy-three percent of all wheat exports this year have been
subsidized under the Export Enhancement Program, making wheat the
main commodity covered by it. Others have included barley, rice,
sorghum, eggs, frozen poultry and vegetable oil, as well as the
dairy cattle.
   Agriculture Secretary Richard E. Lyng vowed in June that the
United States would continue the export program in spite of the
drought.
   ``It's impossible for us to make firm forecasts,'' he said.
``But I'll tell you this, that we will not neglect our export
trade.''
   Europeans deny they have been the aggressors in export
subsidies. The European Economic Community's farm supports are
being curtailed for budget reasons, said Derwent Renshaw,
agricultural counselor for the trade bloc's office in Washington.
   Farm lobbyists are unenthusiastic about export subsidies because
they depress world prices, but end up supporting them because they
promote exports and reduce stockpiles.
   The National Farmers Union, for example, supports the program as
a second best because the government did not require as large of a
set-aside for idling crop land as the group wanted.
   Talks on reducing farm subsidies are being conducted under the
auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the
Geneva-based body that overseas international commerce.
   A midterm progress review on the talks is scheduled for Montreal
in December. The United States has been hoping to come up with at
least a framework for subsidy reductions by then, but the outlook
for that appears dim.
   Paarlberg faults the Reagan administration for setting
``hopelessly grandiose'' goals in the GATT talks.
   ``We could have had an agreement on export subsidies if that had
been focused on,'' he said.
   Progress in Montreal is still possible, but it will depend on
conditions in the preceding weeks, such as the weather and the
European budget situation, said Leonard Condon, the deputy
assistant U.S. trade representative for agricultural affairs.
   ``We're talking about tough issues here and political leaders
don't like to resolve tough issues until they have nowhere else to
go,'' Condon said.

<HEAD>Scherer Proxy Vote To Be Announced In One Week</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM S. BERGSTROM</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Dissident family shareholders pushing for a
buyout of R.P. Scherer Corp. say they are confident they won two of
three board of directors seats considered instrumental in their
attempt, but are unsure of the third.
   Scherer stockholders cast proxy votes at a meeting Wednesday to
fill the three seats. Results were scheduled to be announced next
Wednesday, said Peter R. Fink, the pharmaceutical capsule company's
president and chief executive.
   In national over-the-counter trading, Scherer closed up $1.37{ a
share to $26.25.
   John S. Scherer and his sister Karla Scherer Fink, the estranged
wife of Peter Fink, have spearheaded the effort to win the three
seats as a prelude to attempting to arrange a buyout of the company.
   The two, who are children of the company's late founder, Robert
P. Scherer, control 38.2 percent of the company's outstanding
shares. Karla Fink filed for divorce from her husband several
months ago.
   John Scherer said he was encouraged by a state Court of Appeals
ruling Wednesday that barred the voting of a 9.8 percent block of
the company's stock in the proxy contest.
   Schere and his sister are beneficiaries of a trust at
Manufacturers Bank of Detroit that holds the block and have sought
to prevent the bank from voting the shares, saying it had a
conflict of interest because of business dealings with Scherer.
   The trustee had indicated it planned to back management in the
proxy fight.
   In a statement released after the meeting, John Scherer said the
pair was ``confident our candidates had won the two board
seats...We were not certain about the third seat. But as the
meeting progressed and we learned the bank could not vote the
trust, our optimism increased.''
   About 200 people attended the calm, hourlong annual meeting at a
Troy hotel. Arguments for both sides drew applause.
   Karla Scherer Fink urged selling the company now, in the wake of
two yearas of record corporate earnings. ``There is no guarantee
this level of profitability will continue,'' she said.
   ``There are interested potential buyers watching closely what
goes on here today,'' she said. ``But they will not come forward in
the kind of hostile environment the management has created.''
   But Peter Fink said, ``A stockholder who seeks full value for
his or her investment in Scherer will not find it on the auction
block today.''
   The board determined after thorough analysis that shareholders
would best be served if the company remained independent, he said.
However, Fink also said there had been no offers to date to buy the
company.
   While management does not intend to ``put a for-sale sign on the
door,'' he said, ``If a bona fide offer were to emerge, it would
clearly be our board's duty to give it thorough and full
consideration.''
   Scherer, which employs about 2,800 people at 22 facilities in 13
countries, is the world's largest maker of gelatin capsules for the
pharmaceutical and nutritional supplement industries. The company
had $290.7 million in sales and $15.1 million in net income in its
last fiscal year, ended March 31.
   Karla Fink and her brother control about 38.2 percent of the
company. The support of another shareholder, Cilluffo Associates,
brought the total shares backing the pair to 39.9 percent.

<HEAD>Kodak Decides to Keep Sterling Household Products Business</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH PICHT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   No one was willing to pay Eastman Kodak
Co. its asking price for the profitable household products group of
the recently-acquired Sterling Drug Co., so Kodak has decided to
keep it.
   Kay Whitmore, Kodak's president and executive officer, said
Wednesday that Kodak had decided not to sell the Lehn & Fink unit
of Sterling, which makes Lysol disinfectant, D-Con pesticides and
other products.
   Whitmore also said the unit ``is too important to lose.''
   Kodak bought Sterling Drug for $5.1 billion earlier this year in
a ``white knight'' maneuver to thwart a hostile takeover attempt of
Sterling by Swiss pharmaceutical giant F. Hoffman-LaRoche & Co.
   Published reports and rumors on Wall Street in recent weeks
indicated Kodak was planning to sell the Montvale, N.J.-based Lehn
& fink unit, which had sales of $594 million last year.
   Many stock analysts believe that if Kodak could have found a
buyer, it would have sold the unit with little hesitation.
   ``I'm not surprised they're keeping it,'' said Mark Obenzinger,
an analyst with the brokerage firm Wood, Gundy & Co. in New York.
``They couldn't get the price they wanted. They paid top dollar for
it, so they have to get top, top dollar for it.''
   Eugene Glazer, an analyst for Dean Witter Reynolds in New York,
expressed similar sentiments but noted that one reason Kodak needed
to get a higher price for the unit was to cover the hefty tax bill
that would have been levied on the deal.
   Tax law changes in 1986 make it harder, or at least more
expensive, for buyers to sell off the unwanted businesses of
acquired companies, Glazer said.
   Because of the new law, Kodak would have to pay ``hundreds of
millions'' of dollars in taxes if it sold Lehn & Fink, he said.
   ``So Kodak had to add that onto the price and I think that
discouraged people from buying,'' Glazer said.
   Lehn & Fink still does not fit into Kodak's strategic plans, but
analysts said it is a successful and well-run company that will not
hurt Kodak's bottom line.
   Whitmore told Lehn & Fink employees in Montvale Wednesday that a
study about the relationship between Kodak and the household
products unit had turned up many positive things.
   He said he envisioned Lehn & Fink marketing products that might
be developed by Kodak's chemical division; Kodak using its strength
in convenience store outlets to get Lehn & Fink products onto more
store shelves; and Kodak helping market Lehn & Fink's products
overseas.
   Whitmore said that while Kodak originally just had interest in
Sterling Drug's pharmaceutical operations, Kodak's broader strategy
always had included expansion of Sterling's consumer products
presence.

<HEAD>AMC To Sell 40 Percent Of Its Theaters</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   AMC Entertainment Inc. announced
Wednesday it planned to sell about 40 percent of its screens for
about $200 million to New York-based TPI Enterprises Inc.
   The Kansas City movie theater chain, which owns almost 25
percent of TPI's stock, will manage the theaters that are sold. The
theaters also are expected to retain the AMC name, and AMC would
retain its ability to negotiate films for all of the screens.
   The AMC sale, which involves 605 of AMC's 1,549 screens, is not
expected to affect the company's estimated 7,800 employees.
   TPI operates a paging and mobile telephone business in Puerto
Rico and recently acquired Shoney's South Inc., a restaurant
company.
   Analysts said that although the transaction immediately would
pump much-needed cash into debt-burdened AMC, it was unclear how
much revenue AMC would lose in the long term because of the sale.
   AMC's debt has swollen to about $376 million due to an
aggressive expansion that began a few years ago. Although AMC grew
under the expansion to become the country's second-largest movie
exhibitor, its debts and losses also have increased.
   AMC's losses more than doubled, to $13.7 million, in its latest
fiscal year, ended March 31. AMC then reported that its
first-quarter losses amounted to $7.6 million, more than half of
all of last year's losses.
   Steven Zell, AMC's senior vice president of finance, would not
say where the 605 screens were, but he said they were in 90
theaters mostly in the Southeast. All the theaters are in buildings
for which AMC has long-term leases, he said.
   Zell said AMC thought that it was important to reorganize its
balance sheet and reduce the company's debt. He said AMC was
expected to receive $150 million in cash and a $50 million note
from TPI for the screens.

   The dollar fell against most major currencies in
moderately active European trading early today. Gold prices rose.
   Dealers said the market pushed the dollar lower in a technical
reaction to its sharp rally Wednesday.
   In Tokyo, where the business day ends before Europe's begins,
the dollar rose 0.78 Japanese yen to a closing 133.93 yen. Later,
in London, it fell back to 133.72 yen.
   Other dollar rates at mid-morning, compared with late

   The dollar drifted higher against the Japanese yen
today, while share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange lost ground.
   Opening at 134.00 yen, a 0.85 yen leap from Wednesday's close,
the dollar ranged between 133.73 and 134.10 yen, finishing at
133.93 yen, up 0.78 yen.
   The foreign exchange market remains bullish toward the dollar
for the moment, due to the currency's quick recovery despite the
wide U.S. trade deficit for June, according to a commercial bank
dealer who requested anonymity.
   ``The dollar is basically firm, but profit-taking pushes it down
when it surpasses the 134.00 mark,'' another bank dealer said,
adding that the dollar will stay within the 132.00 to 134.00 yen
range for a while.
   Spot trading totaled $4.155 billion, down from Wednesday's
$5.256 billion.
   After opening higher at 28,291.11 points, the Nikkei Stock
Average of 255 selected issues, which gained 282.31 points the
previous day, edged down 49.50 points from Wednesday's close, or
0.18 percent, to close at 28,129.36 points.
   The afternoon session slowed down, with a total of 750 million
shares, compared with 500 million shares traded on the first
session.
   The market's loss is just a little break after the previous
day's hectic business, said a stock dealer at a major securities
firm in Tokyo, requesting anonymity.
   Steel- and finance-related stocks did not do as well as on
Wednesday, he added.
   Other brokers said the loss is, in part, due to profit-taking by
institutional investors centering on giant-capital issues.

<HEAD>Newspaper Officials Disappointed With JOA Restraining Order</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JUSTIN BURKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge stunned the publishers of the
Detroit News and Detroit Free Press by temporarily blocking today's
scheduled merger of the newspapers' business operations, saying the
plan would do ``irreparable'' harm.
   U.S. District Judge Joyce Hens Green issued an emergency order
Wednesday preventing the joint operating agreement between the
newspapers from taking effect. The JOA will be postponed until at
least Sept. 17.
   Former Attorney General Edwin Meese III approved the JOA before
leaving office last week. Both newspapers sought the agreement
under an antitrust exemption of the Newspaper Preservation Act.
   William B. Schultz, an attorney representing a group of
advertisers and readers, had argued that Meese arbitrarily ignored
an administrative law judge's finding that neither daily qualified
for the antitrust exemption as a ``failing newspaper.''
   Green agreed with Schultz' contention, saying, ``Consolidation
of the Free Press and the News will harm their employees, their
advertisers and their customers as well. ... Besides being
immediate, these injuries will also be irreparable.''
   Knight-Ridder Inc., which owns the Free Press, has said it will
close the morning newspaper if the partial merger doesn't go
through, meaning the loss of 1,500 jobs. Alvah Chapman, the
company's chairman, has said the Free Press sustained $100 million
in operating losses since 1979.
   ``I am very disappointed,'' said Free Press Publisher David
Lawrence. ``It (the decision) seems to me to be so cruel to all the
individuals involved.
   ``The people of the Free Press have gone through 28 months of
uncertainty and now they still don't know what will happen to them
and this newspaper.''
   Frank Hawkins, spokesman for Miami-based Knight-Ridder, said the
parent company was studying its options.
   Louis Weil, publisher of The Detroit News, said he was stunned
by Green's decision, issued in Washington, D.C.
   ``Everything was ready to go,'' Weil said. ``But now with the
restraining order we will go back to what we were doing before and
that is putting out a fine newspaper.''
   Green scheduled a hearing for Sept. 8.
   Both papers rank among the nation's 10 largest in terms of
circulation but each has posted significant losses in recent years
in a continuing battle to dominate Detroit's newspaper market.
   Since applying for the joint operating status in May 1986, the
two newspapers together have lost $45 million to $50 million, said
Philip A. Lacovara, an attorney for the Free Press.
   Officials of Knight-Ridder and Gannett Co. Inc., owners of the
News, said they expected the JOA to return the newspapers to
profitability.
   Under the partial merger, the Free Press would remain a morning
newspaper while the News, which has published as a 24-hour paper,
would publish evening editions on weekdays. The papers would
publish joint weekend editions. About 500 jobs at the two papers
would be eliminated by the consolidation.
   In 1987, the Free Press had a circulation of 639,720 daily and
724,342 on Sundays while News' circulation was 678,720 daily and
839,319 on Sundays, according to the Audit Bureau of Circulation.

   Four months after leaving home, Richard and
Maureen Johns are camped on the edge of despair, living in a tent
with their four young children and searching for the good job
supposedly here for the asking.
   The family remains unfazed by a summer of searing heat and
sinking finances. They came here from Pittsburgh 2{ months ago and
have been sleeping in a 9-by-9-foot tent and eating in a screened
canopy at the Western Village Park and Campground while Johns looks
for a steady, decent-paying job.
   ``No, no,'' said Mrs. Johns, when asked whether her spirits had
fallen. ``I'm not depressed yet. ... If we're living here in
November, then I'll be concerned.''
   As her husband talked with a reporter, Mrs. Johns prepared
peanut butter and jelly sandwiches for the children: Mary
Katherine, 7; Ben, 5; Elizabeth, 4 and Brian, 2.
   Bikes were scattered about the campsite. Some belongings were
kept under a tarp next to the tent. The family's 1976 Ford station
wagon was parked nearby.
   Johns said he moved his family out of their Pittsburgh home June
1 after reading news accounts about plenty of jobs around Carlisle,
a small central Pennsylvania town in an area with a rising economy.
The town sits near an important north-south junction, Interstate 81
and the Pennsylvania Turnpike.
   ``Coming from job-depressed Pittsburgh, it sounded great,'' he
said.
   Once here, Johns, 33, who has training in electronics, could
find only fast-food and truck-driving jobs. He has worked several
temporary jobs, including one for the telephone company, but has
yet to come up with something permanent.
   He has sought help from the state Job Service and local programs
and had expected his search would end by this month.
   Experienced campers, the Johns enjoyed the prospect of a summer
outdoors, but now worry about how they'll meet another $235 monthly
payment on Sept. 1 to stay at the campground.
   ``The money's getting tight,'' Johns said.
   The site has electricity and restrooms. Relatives have given
them a small refrigerator and electric skillet. They drive about 15
minutes away to a roadside spring for drinking water. For a change
of scene, they've driven to nearby state parks and a cousin gave
them tickets to Hersheypark amusement park.
   ``The kids consider it a vacation,'' Johns said. ``They love it.
They really enjoy it.''
   Married eight years, the Johns endured similar frustrating job
hunting in Pittsburgh. He said he sent out 240 resumes and got only
one interview. Although they invested many improvements into their
Pittsburgh home, they feel no point in returning and are trying to
sell the house. The real estate agent believes it will be tough
with so many houses on the market, they said.
   ``The saying is, `The grass is always greener on the other
side,''' Johns said. ``Back in Pittsburgh, the grass is dead.''
   He said he refuses to give up on central Pennsylvania and feels
it has an optimism about the economy that is missing in western
Pennsylvania, which has been hurt by the slump in steel, coal and
other core industries in the last decade.
   ``If I stay and be persistent, something is going to come up,''
he said. ``There's no alternative. I can't go back to Pittsburgh.
There is nothing to go back to.''

<HEAD>Drought Will Save Government $10 Billion in Farm Payments</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Higher prices for drought-reduced commodities
and cutbacks in subsidy payments will mean a two-year saving of
$10.6 billion for major farm price support programs, according to
Agriculture Department projections.
   When USDA's proposed operating budget was sent to Congress last
February, net price support outlays by the department's Commodity
Credit Corp. were estimated at $17.7 billion for the current year
and $17.1 billion for the fiscal year that will begin Oct. 1.
   The revised estimates, based upon a ``mid-session review'' of
USDA budget figures, are tentative and still subject to revision.
However, as of now, they call for commodity price support spending
to drop this year to around $13.1 billion and in fiscal 1989 to
$11.1 billion.
   Spending on farm supports soared to a record $25.8 billion in
1986, the first year of a new farm law passed in 1985. The law
authorized gradual reductions in ``deficiency payments'' made to
farmers when market prices are depressed. It also allowed other
adjustments, including the lowering of basic price support loan
rates for major commodities.
   Outlays for support edged down to $22.4 billion in 1987 but were
expected to decline more in future years as lower adjustments were
made in the law's various formulas, including reduced dairy
supports.
   But rising exports, followed by drought this year, boosted
commodity prices sharply. That has lessened the need for large
deficiency payments for some crops.
   Not all commodities have shared in the expected cost reduction.
Some programs, including cotton and rice, will be more costly to
operate in the coming year.
   But the anticipated savings in direct payments to farmers was an
important arguing point in favor of the recent $3.9 billion drought
relief measure signed Aug. 11 by President Reagan. Corn, soybeans
and spring wheat areas have been the hardest hit.
   According to a summary provided at the request of The Associated
Press, most of the $10.6 billion in savings this year and next will
come as a result of reduced payments to producers of feed grains,
which include corn, sorghum, oats and barley.
   Feed grains payments in fiscal 1987 totaled nearly $14 billion.
This year's payments are expected to decline to $8.2 billion and in
1989 those will drop to less than $2.73 billion, according to the
estimates.
   Last February, USDA budget analysts said feed grains payments
might be about $12.6 billion this year and $11.1 billion in 1989.
   Some other payments and comparisons, included:
   _Wheat, $2.84 billion in 1987, $556.9 million in 1988 and $695.5
million in 1989. Earlier, this year's payments were forecast at
$1.08 billion and 1989's at $1.52 billion.
   _Rice, $905.9 million in 1987, $124.6 million in 1988 and $1
billion in 1989. The earlier forecast was $189 million in 1988 and
$320 million in 1989.
   _Upland cotton, $1.79 billion in 1987, $756.8 million in 1988
and $2.61 billion in 1989. The earlier forecast was $42 million in
1988 and $229 million in 1989.
   _Dairy, $1.17 billion in 1987, $1.18 billion in 1988 and $681.9
million in 1989. The earlier forecast was $1.23 billion in 1988 and
$936 million in 1989.
   _Wool, $152.1 million in 1987, $136.7 million in 1988 and $84.7
million in 1989. The earlier forecast was $125 million in 1988 and
$127 million in 1989.

   Agriculture Department scientists say they
have not forsaken the Asian cockroach. They're still looking for
ways to kill it.
   The pest invaded Florida two years ago and has been a target of
USDA eradicators since then, the department said Wednesday. And the
anti-roach campaign will continue at least through the next fiscal
year.
   Ralph A. Bram, head of research on insects affecting humans and
animals for the department's Agricultural Research Service, said
that contrary to reports, the agency has ``not closed out any
research program aimed at controlling these pests.''
   Bram said the agency's research budget next year is for $243,700
to be spent on cockroaches, the same as this year. The work is done
at the agency's laboratory in Gainesville, Fla., in cooperation
with the University of Florida.
   The agency said recent published reports implied that another
USDA scientist, Richard J. Brenner, said the cockroach will spread
to all of the contiguous 48 states.
   Bram said there is no way of knowing exactly how far north the
cockroach will migrate. Because of winter temperatures, he said, it
is doubtful the insect would survive father north than Maryland on
the East Coast, Tennessee in the central area, and lower Washington
state in the West.

   The Agriculture Department has announced
allocations totaling $110 million for 46 projects under the
Targeted Export Assistance program for the fiscal year that will
begin Oct. 1.
   Under the program, various trade organizations get money to
carry out overseas promotion of designated agricultural products.
The program is aimed at countering or offsetting adverse effects of
unfair foreign trade practices on U.S. exports.
   In most cases, the sponsoring organizations put up some of their
own money in carrying out a specific project, although the amount
of those contributions vary and are subject to negotiation with the
department.
   The $110 million for 1989 is the same as for this year, a level
set by Congress in the 1985 farm law.
   Officials said Wednesday the biggest amount, $8.9 million, will
go to the U.S. Meat Export Federation to promote red meat, variety
meats and related products. Other leading recipients include
American Soybean Association, $8.8 million; Cotton Council
International, $7.9 million; and the California Raisin Advisory
Board, $7.7 million.

   The state Fair Employment Commission
awarded more than $100,000 to a former Silicon Valley saleswoman
who accused her boss of making crude sexual jokes and forcing her
off the job when she complained.
   The Fair Employment Commission, in a unanimous decision, ruled
that Sigma Circuits Inc. of Santa Clara and sales manager Charles
Dimick were guilty of sexual harassment of Linda Schultz, a
saleswoman from January 1983 to August 1985.
   ``Language, humor and related activities that may be acceptable
in the locker room do not belong in the workplace,'' the commission
said.
   Schultz claimed that Dimick continually made crude sexual jokes,
laughed when she complained and forced her off the job, leaving
her, a single mother, without work for four months.
   ``This shows what can happen if employers allow this kind of
childish behavior to continue in the workplace,'' Jim Ryden, an
attorney for Ms. Schultz, said Wednesday.
   The supervisor's conduct made the work environment ``offensive,
oppressive, hostile and intimidating,'' said the commission, which
also said the company was legally responsible for harassment by a
supervisor.
   Monday's ruling also rejected claims that Dimick's comments were
protected by freedom of speech or were a legitimate attempt to keep
the workplace atmosphere loose and friendly.
   Ernest Pinza, lawyer for the electronics company, declined
comment, and James Thompson, Dimick's lawyer, did not return
telephone calls. The ruling can be appealed in Superior Court.
   According to the commission, Dimick regularly used profanity in
the office, told lewd jokes and made other comments that offended
Schultz, including telling her and other employees to ``get under
my desk'' or ``get down on your knees'' when they asked for price
quotations.
   After Schultz complained, Dimick told her in August 1985 that it
would be better if she found another job, according to the
commission. Schultz considered herself fired, went home and
appealed the next day to the company president, who accepted
Dimick's version of the events and denied Schultz severance
benefits.
   The company denied Schultz had been fired, but the commission
said even if she quit, the legal effect was the same because
``Dimick's sexual harassment made her working conditions so
oppressive and intolerable that she was forced to quit.''
   Damages, which were to be paid jointly by the company and
Dimick, include $36,000 in lost wages, back pay and $25,000 for
emotional distress. With interest, the total award will exceed
$100,000, said Ryden, a lawyer with the Fair Employment and Housing
Department.

<HEAD>Hispanic FBI Agent Alleges Discrimination, Cites Mormons</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HOLDEN LEWIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>EL PASO, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One of more than 300 Hispanic FBI agents
who have joined a racial discrimination lawsuit says agency careers
were stymied by a network of Mormon agents that included the
disgraced Richard Miller.
   Sammy Martinez, a special agent in New York, testified Wednesday
that when he worked in the Mexico City office in 1986 he was
discriminated against for racial and religious reasons by his boss,
now a high-ranking FBI official.
   Martinez said he was the only Hispanic and non-Mormon in the
Mexico City office.
   ``I know there was a contract on me,'' Martinez told U.S.
District Judge Lucius Bunton, explaining that in FBI jargon, a
contract means ``someone's out to get you'' to sabotage your career.
   In his testimony, Martinez charged his Mexico City boss, John
Walser, of falsely accusing him of wrongdoing as a pretext to get
Martinez transferred out of the office. Martinez said the incident
would not have happened were he non-Hispanic or Mormon.
   Walser, who is now an executive assistant director in
Washington, did not return a phone call Wednesday from The
Associated Press.
   Defense attorney Alan Ferber noted that Walser has adopted four
Mexican children and has a Hispanic brother-in-law.
   The 311 agents who have joined the lawsuit contend the FBI
discrgeles for two years before his El
Paso transfer in 1984.
   Perez has contended that Richard Bretzing, special agent in
charge of the Los Angeles office, criticized his performance as an
administrator because of racial prejudice. Bretzing in the past has
declined comment.
   Perez later testified in the Los Angeles espionage trial of
former FBI agent Richard Miller that he told Bretzing he should
fire Miller for incompetence. Miller was convicted of espionage.
   Bretzing and Miller are both Mormons, and the Bretzing-Perez
fight led to charges of a ``Mormon Mafia'' in the Los Angeles
office.
   Martinez said after his testimony that about 50 of 450 agents in
Los Angeles are Mormons.
   Because most Mormon men serve as missionaries in their younger
years, ``a lot of Mormons come into the bureau because of language
ability,'' Martinez said. ``They're recruited, supported and move
up the career ladder because of the clique.''
   Testimony is expected to last two weeks.

<TEXT>
   U.S. District Judge Robert Aguilar has
imposed a one-year delay on Apple Computer Inc.'s landmark
copyright violation case against Hewlett-Packard Co. and Microsoft
Corp.
   Aguilar, who set the trial date as Aug. 14, 1989, gave no reason
for the decision, which legal experts said will hurt the strategies
of Microsoft and other companies including International Business
Machines Corp. to bring ``Macintosh-like'' traits to IBM-compatible
computers.
   The trial will decide whether Microsoft violated its contract
with Apple, which gave Microsoft the right to use copyrighted
elements of Apple's Macintosh visual display in its software.
   ``Microsoft would like to get the issue resolved as soon as
possible,'' said G. Gervaise Davis, a Monterey attorney
specializing in high-tech law.
   The trial dates apply only to the question of the scope of the
licensing agreement between Microsoft and Apple. Apple's claims
that Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard have produced software
infringing on its copyrights will be decided separately.
   Aguilar in June granted Microsoft's request to break Apple's
suit into those two major elements. The action was designed to
speed up the trial and was considered a victory for Microsoft.

   Computerland Corp. has decided to put off
going public in light of volatile market conditions that have

   The Hayward company said Wednesday it will indefinitely suspend
its first public stock offering, which had been expected this week.
   Computerland, which runs an international chain of independently
owned computer retail stores that sell personal computers, hoped to
sell 4 million shares in the United States and 1 million shares
overseas at a price of $16 to $19, raising $80 million to $95
million. Some of the shares would have been sold by Computerland's
founder, William Millard, and his wife.
   The proposed price range gave Computerland an indicated value of
$254 million to $302 million.

   Pennwalt Corp. announced today it has
reached an agreement to sell its pharmaceutical operations to the
British firm Fisons for $460 million.
   Edwin E. Tuttle, chairman and chief executive officer of
Pennwalt, said the sale of the worldwide operation could mean a

deal, which is subject to shareholder approval, is expected to take

   Thanks to a strong economy, Britain's persistently
high unemployment rate has fallen sharply, but critics claim the
government is massaging the figures to make them look even better
than they are.
   Opponents of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's government agree
that unemployment is down, but say exaggeration in the degree of
improvement is encouraging apathy toward the unemployed.
   The jobless rate has been falling for two years, reaching 8.2
percent in July, its lowest point in nearly seven years, the
Department of Employment says.
   Unemployment has fallen to 2.31 million people from a peak of
11.5 percent, or about 3.31 million in June 1986.
   The decline is the fastest among major Western industrialized
nations, the government says.
   But the Unemployment Unit, a private research and lobby
organization, says the rate would be 10.4 percent, representing
2.98 million people, if the calculation method were the same as
when the Conservatives first came into power in 1979.
   The British figures compare with a West German rate of 8.9
percent in June, which is unchanged from two years earlier, and a
French rate of 10.9 percent in May, which is up from 10.7 percent
two years before.
   An Employment Department spokesman, who requested anonymity,
said: ``We're still reasonably confident that it (ours) is an
accurate measure of unemployment.''
   Lawmaker Michael Meacher, the opposition Labor Party's spokesman
on unemployment, said: ``Unemployment has indeed been going down
over the last two years, but only about half as fast as the
government has been claiming.''
   Peter Kellner, a columnist for the Independent newspaper, wrote:
``If ... the calculations were done differently, it is doubtful
whether the government could claim, or would receive, anything like
the credit that the media and the public now bestow upon it.''
   Paul Convery, a director of the Unemployment Unit, said Britons
have become ``a little bit anesthetized,'' partly because they
generally are feeling better off economically, and partly because
the government has scored ``several sizable propaganda victories.''
   National unemployment registers have been the source for
unemployment statistics in all Common Market countries except
Spain, Portugal and Greece, the Unemployment Unit said.
   In 1982, Britain alone began basing its unemployment rate on the
number claiming unemployment benefits, rather than the number
registered as unemployed, it said.
   Since 1979, the government has made 22 changes in the way it
measures joblessness, all except one of which have reduced the
official unemployment rate, the Unemployment Unit said.
   The government denies that it has made that many changes or that
its alterations are designed to make the numbers look better.
   In a recent monthly unemployment report, the government said it
began counting as employed those people who are in government
training programs. That reduced the unemployment rate by 0.1
percent.
   The unit said the government has removed from the unemployment
benefit lists jobless men over age 60 who receive other kinds of
benefits.
   Part-time workers, whose numbers are increasing, have always
been counted as employed, and many jobless married women aren't
eligible for unemployment benefits, it said.
   Another way of measuring unemployment is to conduct surveys
which ask adults questions about their employment status. This
method is used monthly in the United States.
   In Britain, the government uses the method once a year, and
reveals the results a year later. By the survey method, Britain had
an unemployment rate of 10.7 percent in the spring of 1987. By the
government's regular method, the rate was 10.8 percent.
   ``They are so close that it shows that our own measure is
accurate,'' the department spokesman said.

<HEAD>DALLAS: going on.''</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Created after the Great Depression, the savings and loan
industry provided a simple service: locals deposited their
paychecks in government-insured accounts and the bank lent it back
in home mortgages.
   Vernon S&L was a small-town thrift doing that small-town
business 10 miles below the Oklahoma border. There was hardly a
safer, more plain-vanilla business.
   In the late 1970s, high interest rates sapped the profitability
out of S&Ls, though. Congress deregulated the industry, loosening
the restraints on what rates S&Ls could pay depositors and opening
up new money-making services.
   Dixon bought Vernon in 1982, moved its headquarters to Dallas
and offered high rates that attracted depositors from across the
country. The deposits were guaranteed by the FSLIC up to $100,000,
and millions of dollars flew in. Vernon grew a staggering 1600
percent in less than four years _ even though S&Ls are prohibited
from growing more than 25 percent per year.
   With all those deposits, Vernon went on a lending binge. New
rules allowed S&Ls into commercial developments. The changes also
allowed loans on projects with little capital behind them and no
down payments. Qualifying for loans was a snap if you knew the
right people and were willing to pay Vernon's heftier fees.
   ``The officers of Vernon conducted the real estate lending
function of Vernon in a way calculated to create as much loan-fee
income as possible, without particular regard to use of sound
lending practices,'' former Vernon chief lending officer Jim Wright
said in an affidavit.
   New rules also allowed Vernon and other S&Ls to become a partner
in deals by making direct investments _ a risky venture.
   ``Direct investment is heads, they win; tails, the FSLIC
loses,'' said FHLBB member Roger Martin.
   The FSLIC, of course, usually lost.
   At the high-flying S&Ls, there were tales of developers lining
up in bank lobbies to ``do deals.'' Ed McBirney, then chairman of
Sunbelt Savings, which was known as ``Gunbelt Savings,'' conducted
business at a local restaurant.
   Western Savings Association grew 5700 percent under its
chairman, Jarrett Woods, who, federal regulators say, took $3
million in salary and bonuses while his S&L plunged into the red.
   As the frenzied lending continued and depositors' interest
earnings had to be paid, bank executives raised the interest rates
offered even higher so more money would come in, and dove into even
riskier ventures hoping for a big payoff.
   The cycle has been likened to a pyramid scheme, backed by the
insurance of the government.
   ``Many of these high fliers used their S&Ls as private piggy
banks,'' the General Accounting Office reported.
   Officials also charge that S&L executives fudged their required
filings with regulators to make thrifts look healthier. At the end
of 1986, Vernon reported a positive net worth of $17 million, but
regulators say it actually was negative $350 million. Ninety-six
percent of its loans were overdue.
   The FHLBB estimates the cost of cleaning up Texas is $15
billion. The national total grows about $1 billion a month,
according to government projections. Paying off depositors will
cost twice what the Reagan administration has spent on ``Star
Wars,'' officials say, at least $40 billion and perhaps $100
billion.
   An FBI task force, which now occupies an entire floor of a
federal building here, has subpoenaed records from 290 individuals.
So far, 17 S&L officials have been charged; Collins expects more
indictments this fall.
   ``When you commit armed robbery at a bank, alarms go off, the
police come and sometimes there's a chase,'' Collins said.
   ``When you commit bank fraud, nothing happens. There's not much
of immediate consequence.''

<HEAD>Striking Tugboat Workers Struggle To Be Noticed</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also on general news wires.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MARJORIE ANDERS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For six months, New York's tugboat workers have
been on strike, boycotting the passenger liners and cargo ships
that negotiate the nation's busiest port.
   But no one notices. There has been a sea change in the maritime
industry.
   A 12-day strike in 1946 practically paralyzed the city _ fresh
produce disappeared, coal shortages forced the closing of public
places, Army and Navy tugs were pressed into action. But the 1988
strike, the longest in history, ``really hasn't had an appreciable
effect on shipping,'' said Greg Storey of the New York Shipping
Association.
   And the 2,500 strikers, men like Capt. Vinnie Hilser, fear the
walkout's ineffectiveness signals the end of a way of life.
   ``I've never had another job,'' said Hilser, a resident of
Langhorne, Pa. ``I came out of the Marine Corps and went right to
the tugs. When you're that long in one thing, what else can you
do?''
   Hilser's comrades face a double-barreled threat. Their jobs have
been taken by replacement workers who work longer hours for lower
pay, many of them veterans of the slumping offshore oil industry in
the Gulf of Mexico.
   But the tug workers also must deal with a changed industry.
After World War II, some 450 tugs plied the harbor. Now there are
just 170.
   Container ships and oil pipelines have greatly reduced the need
for seamen and longshoremen as well as tug and barge crews. Barges
are bigger _ some are self-propelled _ and tugs more powerful, so
fewer are needed. And modern ships are bigger and cheaper to
operate; they can almost berth themselves.
   The liner Normandie, launched in 1935, needed 14 tugs to dock.
The Queen Elizabeth II needs only one.
   Still, tugs run to Boston, down the Intercoastal Waterway to
Virginia, up the Hudson River to the Erie Canal.
   Tug men, many of whom have crewed together for years, often on
the same vessel, are gone from their families for up to a fortnight
at a time.
   Before the strike, the usual tour was a week on, a week off, or
two weeks on, two weeks off. Winter or summer, in calm water or
heaving waves, the men were aboard 24 hours a day and worked 12
hours a day in intervals of six hours on, six hours off.
   The cook worked 12 straight hours, serving three hot meals a day
plus ``night rats'' or rations. It's the cook, the union says, who
created an orderly life at sea; it was he who woke the men up with
fresh brewed coffee and put them to sleep with cookies and milk.
   But the tug companies say the cooks are an extravagance and 750
of them lost their jobs. They installed microwave ovens in the
galleys and urged the crew to take turns cooking, as firefighters
do.
   Cooks are not the only issue in a strike that began Feb. 16. The
companies had demanded that 450 other jobs be eliminated, that
wages be cut up to 60 percent, that overtime pay and weekend
premiums be eliminated, that holidays be cut back and that captains
and mates lose union protection.
   The union offered to cut labor costs 13 percent, according to
Albert Cornette, head of Local 333 of the International
Longshoremen's Association.
   But the owners, fresh from victories over tug unions in Norfolk,
Va., Baltimore and Philadelphia, rejected the offer. There was no
last-minute bargaining and some companies took pre-emptive action,
hiring security guards to eject crews days before the contract
expired.
   The replacement workers already had been hired. Their tours were
stretched to 30 days on, two weeks off.
   The companies cut crews from six to four or five, or even to
three, depending on whether the tug is making an inshore or
offshore trip. Wages for deckhands dropped from $175 a day to $80,
engineers from $245 to $170.
   It cost about $2,100 a day to operate a union-manned tugboat
before the strike. Now, operating costs have been slashed to about
$800 a day.
   ``When they talk about how much money we make a day,'' says cook
Richard Anson, ``they forget we work 12 hours. But what about the
other 12 hours? We can't go home. We're shanghaied.''
   ``The owners don't want to sit and bargain the way we did with
their fathers,'' said Frank Gragnani, a tug captain for 42 years
and union leader. ``They fell into money. They don't know how to
work for money.''
   There have been no talks since the start of the strike. The
National Labor Relations Board issued a complaint against the
owners, alleging failure to bargain in good faith, and set an Oct.
27 hearing.
   Company officials, through lawyers, declined numerous interview
requests.
   Picket lines at remote piers are few and limited in size by a
federal injunction, sought by employers in the early days of the
strike to curb violence.
   Firebombs were tossed, a shot was fired into a tug's wheelhouse,
fist fights erupted, windshields were smashed and rocks thrown.
   At the union's rundown storefront strike headquarters near the
Staten Island wharfs, they track ``turncoats'' on the ``War
Board,'' which lists more than 150 men who returned to work. ``This
scum sold out their union, friends, shipmates and family,'' a sign
says.
   After six months, the strike is taking its toll. Some strikers
have sold their cars or taken out second mortgages. Others have
taken jobs: ``We have people painting, flipping hamburgers, doing
things they would never have done,'' said Gragnani, who charged a
$1,000 cash loan to his credit card.
   The strikers are not entirely shackled to the land. A small
picket boat accosts tugs manned by those who cross picket lines.
   Patrick Egan, a tug cook, enjoyed jeering through a megaphone as
the boat pulled alongside a barge owned by one of the struck
companies.
   ``How much did they cut your pay? You slimy turncoat, you scab,
you galley roach,'' Egan shouted.
   ``It's not that we like to curse, but we can't help it,''
Gragnani explained. ``Screaming lets you get your animosity out. If
you hold it all in, you get sick.''

   Coca-Cola Co. plans to raise $300 million through
its first preferred-stock issue.
   In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on
Wednesday, the soft drink giant said it would sell 100,000 shares
of non-voting ``money market cumulative preferred'' stock at $3,000
a share in four series.
   Although the new shares are described as a money market stock,
the dividend rate is not directly tied to money market
fluctuations. Coca Cola said the rate will be set every 49 days by
bids from stockholders and prospective buyers.
   Proceeds from the issue will be used for general purposes,
including repaying some of its short-term debt, Coca Cola said.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures opened mostly higher
today on the Chicago Board of Trade with conflicting weather
factors dominating the market action.
   Support stemmed from the National Weather Service's latest
six-to-10-day forecast, which predicted above nomal-temperatures
and widely varied rainfall in the Corn Belt during the middle five
days of next week, analysts said.
   They said ideas that crop conditions had deteriorated during the
past three days of triple-digit heat added to the bullish sentiment.
   But cooler temperatures and showers were expected to move into
the Midwest today, which accounted for the mixed opening, analysts
said.
   ``I don't see any rain coming yet but it will come and I assume
that's the reason we're under a little pressure here,'' said John
Frazier, grain specialist with Balfour Maclaine Corp. in Chicago.
   The wheat market got an additional boost from talk that Egypt
had purchased 94,000 metric tons of subsidized U.S. wheat, analysts
said.
   In early trading, wheat was 1 cent to 1{ cents higher with the
contract for delivery in September at $3.91{ a bushel; corn was 1}
cents lower to } cent higher with September at $2.85{ a bushel;
oats were 3 cents to 3{ cents lower with September at $2.67 a
bushel; soybeans were 3 cents lower to 3 cents higher with August
at $8.80 a bushel.
   Cattle futures were mostly lower, hogs were mixed and frozen
pork bellies were higher in early trading on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange.
   Live cattle were .28 cent lower to .17 cent higher with August
at 70.80 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .20 cent to .47 cent
lower with August at 81.90 cents a pound; hogs were .28 cent lower
to .28 cent higher with August at 46.82 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .63 cent to 1.58 cents higher with August at 35.40
cents a pound.
   Livestock and meat futures settled mostly higher on Wednesday.

<HEAD>Pennwalt Announces Sale To Fisons</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pennwalt Corp. has agreed to sell its
pharmaceutical operations to the British firm Fisons for $460
million as part of a two-phase company restructuring, the company
announced Thursday.
   Edwin E. Tuttle, chairman and chief executive officer of
Pennwalt, said the sale of the worldwide operation would include a
special distribution of proceeds to shareholders.
   Closing on the deal, which is subject to approval by
shareholders, is expected to take place within the next two to
three months, he said.
   J.S. Kerridge, Fisons' chairman and chief executive officer,
said the acquisition is ``an excellent fit for Fisons, reinforcing
its success in the U.S. pharmaceuticals market and accelerating its
growth plans'' worldwide.
   Fisons just bought an Italian pharmaceutical company,
Italchimici SpA, on Aug. 11.
   The Pennwalt operation, based in Rochester, N.Y., has 1,200
employees and sells primarily in the United States, but also has
sales in Canada and Mexico. It makes prescription drugs as well as
over-the-counter products such as Desenex and Allerest.
   Kerridge said the sales forces, 275 for Fisons and 260 for
Pennwalt, will be combined and trimmed to 400.
   ``The sale of the Pennwalt Pharmaceutical Group to Fisons will
meet one of the major objectives of the company's strategic plan,''
Tuttle said.
   The second phase, he said, will be the sale of Pennwalt's
equipment operations, and ``we are confident that this will also be
achieved in the near future.''
   Tuttle said the board of directors would consider various
alternatives on how to handle the proceeds from the sale.
   ``These alternatives could include a special dividend and-or a
stock repurchase program,'' he said.
   Pennwalt had pharmaceutical sales last year of $129.3 million,
representing 11 percent of the company's total 1987 sales of $1.1
billion. Pre-tax earnings for pharmaceuticals was set at $20
million.
   Fisons, headquartered in Ipswich, Suffolk, England, makes
pharmaceuticals, scientific equipment and gardening products.
Fisons reported sales of 760.3 million pounds, the equivalent of
$1.29 billion, in 1987 and net earnings of 81.3 million pounds.
   Pennwalt's pharmaceutical division's prescription products
include cardiovascular, anti-depressant, anorectic and cough-cold
products. Name brands include Microx, Zaroxolyn, Adapin, Ionamin,
Tussionex and Penntuss.
   Over-the-counter products include Allerest, Desenex, Cruex,
Sinarest and Caldecort.
   The division also includes the Pharmasol Corp., a specialized
aerosol manufacturer.
   Kerridge said Fisons' new U.S. pharmaceutical operation will
remain headquartered in Rochester and will depend on existing
management there. Fisons currently operates out of Bedford, Mass.
The entire Bedford operation will be moved to Rochester next year,
Kerridge said.
   The British company has 500 employees in Bedford.

   Westinghouse Electric Corp. has tentatively
agreed to pay $35 million to settle an age-discrimination suit
brought by employees whose jobs were eliminated over the past eight
years in a series of plant closings, the government said Thursday.
   The settlement with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission
is believed to be the largest for such a suit. The federal aency
said thousands of former Westinghouse employees could receive
substantial payments.
   Westinghouse said it agreed to deposit the $35 million in escrow
to be used by the EEOC to make severence payments to an
undetermined number of former employers whose jobs were lost in the
closings. The employees had received pensions but no severence pay.
   The tentative agreement would resolve class-action suits filed
in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, said EEOC spokeswoman Margaret
Fernandez. The Pennsylvania suit was expanded to cover Westinghouse
employees nationwide.
   The deal awaits review by U.S. District Court in Philadelphia.
   Other contingencies include the company and the agency agreeing
that a layoff policy being proposed by Westinghouse is lawful, Mrs.
Fernandez said.
   The EEOC must also determine the number of people eligible for
payments before the settlement can be concluded, she said.

<TEXT>
   Venezuela will issue $100 million of
Eurobonds Monday, marking the second time a developing nation
debtor ventures into the international bond market since the Third
World debt crisis began.
   The issue, which is registered in Luxembourg, was arranged by
Samuel Montagu & Co. Ltd., a part of Britain's Midland Bank group,
according to Peter Wallin, a Midland Bank representative in Caracas.
   The signing ceremony will take place Sept. 22 in London, Wallin
said in a phone interview Thursday.
   The 5-year notes mature in 1993 and have an interest rate of
1.875 percent over the London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR. The
issue was arranged on a best efforts basis and in theory has been
fully underwritten, Wallin said.
   He said the bonds should be on the market for trading by next
Friday.
   Venezuela is the only debtor nation which has reentered
international bond markets since the debt crisis began in 1982. It
owes $34 billion abroad.
   Last February, Venezuela launched its first Eurobond issue in
eight years with a $100 million issue underwritten by J.P. Morgan
Securities and Banco de Venezuela, a local private bank. The issue
was considered a success.
   The Venezuelan government is currently seeking up to about $2.5
billion in new loans to help cover a balance of payments deficit
caused by low oil prices.
   The bond issues are considered important as a symbolic measure
of Venezuela's creditworthiness.

<HEAD>U.S. Drought Unlikely To Help European Farm Exports</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SALLY JACOBSEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Despite the crop-withering drought in
the United States, European farmers are unlikely to take many new
customers away from Americans in the fiercely competitive export
market, analysts say.
   The United States is expected to draw down on surplus stocks so
that it can continue its export push and hold onto clients.
   Indeed, the drought's major impact on Europe may be to
strengthen the negotiating hand of Europeans who have been
resisting U.S. demands for dramatic changes in agricultural
policies that heavily subsidize farmers.
   The dry weather has sent world commodity prices soaring.
   With higher world prices, the European Economic Community, the
trading bloc that handles much of the agricultural policies for 12
European nations, will have to pay out less in subsidies, mostly
those to push foreign sales.
   That will ease the money pressure on the community, analysts
said, to scale back its farm aid program as the Reagan
administration would like.
   ``It couldn't have come at a worst time ...,'' said a U.S.
government source, who demanded anonymity. ``It takes away a lot of
financial pressure because the EEC next year will be swimming in
budget resources.''
   ``The only real beneficiary ... will be the (EEC's) farm
budget,'' said Tim O'Dell, international economist at the London
brokerage of Phillips & Drew.
   ``The amount of subsidies the European Community farm budget has
to pay farmers will have to be reduced,'' he said.
   Roger Brinner, chief economist at the consulting firm of Data
Resources Inc. in Lexington, Mass., agreed: ``Since world prices
have risen to a certain extent, the (European) governments have to
make up less of the shortfall (to farmers).''
   The drought could translate into savings of at least $1.5
billion to $2 billion in subsidies for grains and oilseeds in the
EEC's 1989 farm budget, the U.S. source estimated.
   Nico Wegter, a spokesman for the trading bloc, said there was no
official estimate of the impact of the drought on the farm budget.
   Budget ministers of the EEC's member nations recently approved a
draft budget that calls for funneling $31.5 billion to farm
payments in 1989. Under the spending outline, those payments would
drain off 59 percent of the trading bloc's total budget.
   The EEC provides hefty subsidies to its 18 million farmers
through guaranteed prices for many of their crops.
   In addition, the community gives exporters help so costlier
European agricultural products can compete internationally.
   The exporters receive refunds, which amount to the difference
between the price they must pay to buy the European goods and the
lower price they earn for the products on the world market.
   The United States complains the export subsidies have helped the
EEC to increase its share of world market sales and has responded
with its own Export Enhancement Program.
   The program, designed to stimulate overseas sales, pays surplus
farm commodities held in government bins to exporters. The trade
bill, recently passed by Congress, extends the program for two
years with a $2.5 billion price tag.
   Analysts for the U.S. Department of Agriculture have said that
although the drought is hurting crop production, it will have
little effect on exports this year.
   Brinner predicted that European farmers would make ``no
permanent inroads'' into the export markets.
   In agriculture, he said, ``you don't lose a customer forever.
... If you have the goods, they'll buy from you.''
   However, if the drought continues next year and stocks are low,
the United States could not keep up the same level of exports.
   The EEC's extensive farm support system has been a sore point
between the trading bloc and the United States, which is pressing
the Europeans to get rid of trade-distorting subsidies by the year
2000.
   Community officials have rejected the Reagan administration
proposal.
   ``It would be absolutely unreasonable to think we could leave
the bulk of the farmers to market conditions,'' Wegter said.
   Some European officials argue the drought proves the weakness of
the U.S. argument. It shows, they say, the weather-dependent
agricultural sector must be handled gingerly.
   ``You can't just deal with it in the same way as the industrial
sector,'' said Wegter. ``It needs to be treated in a specific way.''
   In February, European leaders began the politically sensitive
task of curbing payments to farmers. They agreed to limit the
maximum annual amount of expenditure on price guarantees over the
next five years.
   U.S. officials maintain the measures were not extensive enough
to alter a fundamentally flawed policy.
   The thorny issue will receive fresh attention in December in
Montreal at a review of the Uruguay Round of international trade
negotiations. The talks are held under the auspices of the
96-nation General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which seeks to
liberalize trade among countries.
   The EEC is made up of Belgium, Britain, Denmark, France,
Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands,
Portugal and Spain.

<HEAD>Delta In Market For New Aircraft</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Delta Air Lines is in the market for a new
long-range aircraft and hopes to place an order by the end of the
year, but its size and the type of plane have yet to be decided, a
Delta spokesman said.
   Jim Lundy, a spokesman for Atlanta-based Delta, made the
comments after The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday that the
airline was considering placing an order for as much as $6 billion
in new planes.
   If made, the order would be a record for commercial plane sales.
The biggest on record is a $4.6 billion order placed with aircraft
maker Boeing Co. earlier this year by International Lease Finance
Corp. of Beverly Hills, Calif.
   ``What I can confirm for you is that we are indeed in the market
for a new long-range airplane,'' Lundy said. ``The size of the
order will depend on which airplane we select and what we see as
our long-range need. It really is too early to say.''
   The Journal reported that Delta is considering rival offers from
Boeing and McDonnell Douglas Corp. for a transaction that would
include as many as 30 to 40 jumbo jets and 70 to 100 smaller
twin-jets.
   Lundy confirmed that Delta is interested in exploring propfan
technology on its new jets. Propfan engines combine propeller
technology with traditional turbofan jet engines to produce a
quieter, more fuel-efficient engine.
   Lundy noted that when Delta placed 80 orders and options for
McDonnell Douglas' MD-88 plane two years ago, a required condition
was being able to retrofit the aircraft with propfan engines.
   Delta's interest in propfans hinges on whether ``the performance
of the engine and the fuel savings and noise reductions turn out to
be as good as the predictions,'' Lundy said.
   Without being specific, Lundy said Delta is interested in new
planes not just to replace existing aircraft, but as part of an
expansion program on foreign routes. Delta currently serves more
than 150 cities, including three in the Pacific Rim and seven in
Europe.
   David Jimenez, a Boeing spokesman in Seattle, would not comment
on the Journal report, citing the company's policy never to comment
on sales efforts until a sale is finalized.
   Boeing officials early this year discussed how their 7J7 program
to develop a fuel-efficient propfan plane was delayed for at least
a year because of lack of airline interest.
   Boeing was to decide last August whether to go ahead with 7J7
development for a 1992 introduction. But the decision was delayed,
setting the program back at least a year. Boeing later scaled back
its 7J7 workforce from 900 to 300.

   Blount Inc. announced an agreement to
sell its Washington Steel subsidiary to Mercury Stainless Corp. for
$290 million, taking Blount out of the specialty steel business.
   The transaction includes $260 million in cash, a $5 million
subordinated note and a cash price adjustment to Blount, which
depends on the net worth of Washington Steel at the closing of the
sale, the company said Thursday. Blount currently estimates the
cash price adjustment at around $25 million.
   The companies said they expect to complete the sale within three
months.
   Blount, based in Montgomery, is a large manufacturing and
construction company.
   Washington Steel, which Blount acquired in 1979, has 600
employees. It had income of $33.5 million on revenue of $222.6
million in its latest fiscal year.
   Winton M. ``Red'' Blount, chairman of Blount, said proceeds from
the sale might be used for several purposes, including debt
reduction and acquisitions of other companies.
   Blount announced in April that it was interested in selling
Washington Steel. Blount spokesman Charles Barnette said the
company was approached by a dozen prospects, including some foreign
companies, about buying the subsidiary. He said the unit had been
profitable for Blount, but this was ``an appropriate time'' to get
out of the specialty steel business.
   Mercury Stainless Chairman Dietrich Gross said the acquisition
will make his company a stronger competitor with a full range of
stainless steel products.
   Mercury Stainless, based in Wheeling, Ill., operates a stainless
steel cold rolling mill in Massillon, Ohio, and six stainless steel
service centers in the United States and Canada.

   Batus Inc. on Thursday extended the deadline
for its hostile $4.9 billion buyout of Farmers Insurance Group
Inc., as both sides continued negotiating a truce in the lengthy
takeover battle.
   Batus said it was giving shareholders until midnight Wednesday
to accept its $63-per-share tender offer. The offer had been set to
expire at midnight last Wednesday.
   Batus said 16.3 million of the 68.4 million shares outstanding
had been tendered, or offered for sale, as of Wednesday.
   The announced extension came on the second day of scheduled
meetings between executives of Batus and Farmers.
   Farmers agreed to discuss a sweetened, $72-a-share offer from
the Louisville, Ky.,-based tobacco and retailing company. In making
the offer last week, Batus set a deadline of Friday for negotiation
of a definitive agreement.
   The friendly offer values Los Angeles-based Farmers at about $5
billion, taking into account the price for 68.4 million shares
outstanding and employee options to buy an additional 1.5 million
shares.

   Grain and soybean futures closed mostly higher
Thursday on the Chicago Board of Trade with support stemming from
rumors the Soviet Union was considering new purchases of U.S. corn,
analysts said.
   Corn and wheat finished mostly higher, oats were lower and
soybeans were mixed.
   Traders continued to focus on export news instead of weather
factors, which on Thursday included the arrival of light showers
and lower temperatures in the drought-striken Midwest.
   Although this summer may go down as the 20th Century's hottest
and driest, ``those things have been very well publicized and
factored into the market,'' said Ted Mao, grain specialist with
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   ``The market seems like it wants to be more responsive to the
demand side right now,'' he said.
   Export sales of corn have been flat recently but Mao said it
wouldn't be unlikely for the Soviets to step into the market.
   At the close, wheat was 2\ cents to 4{ cents higher with
September at $3.92{ a bushel; corn was 2\ cents lower to 3\ cents
higher with September at $2.88 a bushel; oats were 4 cents to 9{

   With Connecticut in the lead, eight Atlantic
Coast states ranked among the 10 in average incomes, the government
reported today.
   The Commerce Department said residents of Connecticut earned
$21,266 for every adult and child in 1987, an increase of 8.8
percent over 1986.
   For the nation as a whole, incomes rose 6 percent to an average
of $15,481 last year.
   Mississippi ranked last with a per capita income of $10,292, a
6.5 percent increase over the previous year.
   Eight Atlantic Coast states plus California and Alaska made the
top 10 income list while seven of the 10 states with the lowest
incomes were in the Southeast, traditionally the region with the
lowest incomes.
   The revised figures showed that income growth in the United
States was stronger than originally reported four months ago, with
some states moving up slightly in the overall rankings although the
top and bottom spots were unchanged.
   The original report put national per capita incomes at $15,340,
a 4.8 percent rise from the previous year. The changes reflected
data showing income levels higher than previously believed.
   New Jersey, with an average income of $20,352, ranked second,
followed by Massachusetts, with an average of $19,142; Alaska,
$18,230, and Maryland, $18,124. Rounding out the top 10 were New
York, California, New Hampshire, Delaware and Virginia.
   In addition to Missisisippi, states with the lowest incomes were
West Virignia, with an average of $11,020, followed by Utah,
Louisiana, Arkansas, Idaho, New Mexico, Alabama, South Carolina and
Kentucky.
   The report showed that regional income differences have been
widening during the 1980s, something that usually does not occur
during economi expansions. While states on both coasts have been
doing well, heartland states dependent on farming, energy
production and smokestack industries have lagged behind.

   The two broadest measures of the nation's money
supply moved in opposite directions in the week ended Aug. 8, the
Federal Reserve Board reported Thursday.
   The Fed said the measure known as M2 fell to a seasonally
adjusted $3,025.5 billion from $3,026.3 billion the previous week.
   An even broader measure, M3, increased to a seasonally adjusted
$3,824.8 billion from $3,821.8 billion.
   The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, fell to a
seasonally adjusted $781.9 billion from $784.2 billion.
   M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts
and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings
deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid
accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations
of $100,000.
   In judging its monetary policy, the Fed has indicated it is
monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the
difference between short- and long-term interest rates. It also has
shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply
measures
   For the latest 13 weeks, M2 averaged $3,016.3 billion, a 5.7
percent seasonally adjusted annual rate of gain from the previous
13 weeks. M3 averaged $3,803.3 billion, up at an annual rate of 5.7
percent, while M1 rose at an annual rate of 6.3 percent to an
average of $777.2 billion.
   The Fed said in mid 1988 that it reaffirmed its target for
annual growth in M2 and M3 at between 4 percent and 8 percent,
which is slightly lower than the 1987 target of 5.5 percent to 8.5
percent. The Fed has not set a specific target range for M1 since
early 1987.

<HEAD>Central Bank Intervention Pushes Dollar Lower; Gold Rises</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCY GORDON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Concerted selling of dollars by major central
banks pushed the U.S. currency lower Thursday in choppy trading.
Gold prices rose.
   The dollar succumbed to intervention by the Federal Reserve and
key central banks in Western Europe, after brushing it off in
Wednesday's trading. The Fed was said to have sold dollars to buy
West German marks twice in late trading Thursday in New York, when
the market was light and more vulnerable to the action.
   The decline was moderate, however. Analysts said a strong
residue of bullish sentiment toward the dollar still remained from
relatively high U.S. interest rates.
   Although a report Tuesday showed that the nation's trade deficit
widened to $12.5 billion in June, currency dealers were impressed
that the gap for May was revised downward to $9.8 billion from an
original $10.9 billion.
   ``The market still wants to buy dollars,'' said Steve Flanagan,
an assistant vice president of foreign exchange at Manufacturers
Hanover Trust Co. ``There's just a very good demand for dollars at
all levels.''
   In addition to the banks' intervention, market watchers said the
dollar was hit by reports that Commerce Secretary William Verity
said U.S. exports and the world economy as a whole would be better
off if the dollar were trading at 1.80 marks.
   The dollar finished in late New York trading at 1.8980 marks,
down from 1.9098 marks late Wednesday.
   The dollar began to fall immediately after the reports of
Verity's remarks, and within minutes the West German Bundesbank and
the Swiss National Bank entered the market to sell dollars, dealers
said.
   The West German and Swiss central banks later were joined by the
central banks of France, Britain and Belgium, dealers said.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends as Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 0.78 Japanese yen to close at 133.93 yen. Later in
London, it was quoted lower at 133.30 yen. By the end of trading in
New York, the dollar was at 133.40 yen, down from 134.01 yen late
Wednesday.
   In London, the dollar fell against the British pound. It cost
$1.6989 to buy one pound, more expensive than $1.6950 late
Wednesday. Later, in New York, a pound was worth $1.6990, up from
$1.6913 late Wednesday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Wednesday's
late rates, included: 1.5945 Swiss francs, down from 1.6040; 6.4470
French francs, down from 6.4660; 1,406.00 Italian lire, down from
1,412.50; and 1.2295 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2313.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Wednesday,
included: 1.8980 West German marks, down from 1.9123; 1.5955 Swiss
francs, down from 1.6025; 6.4340 French francs, down from 6.4750;
2.1438 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1550; 1,402.75 Italian lire, up
from 1,401.50, and 1.2298 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2323.
   Gold rose in London to a late bid price of $431 a troy ounce, up
from $428.50 bid late Wednesday. In Zurich, Switzerland, gold also
closed at a bid $431, up from $428.50 bid late Wednesday.
   Earlier in Hong Kong, gold rose 97 cents to close at a bid
$432.28.
   Gold for current delivery rose on the New York Commodity
Exchange to $432.30 a troy ounce from $431 late Wednesday. Republic
National Bank of New York quoted a bid price for gold of $432 a
troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT, up from $430.40 late Wednesday.
   Silver bullion prices rose in London, where the metal was
trading at a late bid price of $6.66 a troy ounce, up from late
Wednesday's $6.62.
   On New York's Comex, silver for current delivery rose to $6.675
a troy ounce from $6.647 late Wednesday.

   A feeble Wall Street advance fizzled on
profit-taking Thursday in another slow trading session, and brokers
said they saw little prospect for a significant rally anytime soon.
   ``I think it's just an apathetic market, I don't think anybody
cares,'' said Peter J. DaPuzzo, manager of retail equities at
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in New York. ``It's just small swings
back and forth on light volume.''
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks, up more than 11
points early in the session, declined in the final hours and closed
with a 1.07 gain to 2,027.03. Broader indices also showed only
marginal advances.
   Anxiety over the economy's direction and rising interest rates,
combined with the growing attractiveness of bonds and money-market
funds as rival investments, have contributed to the malaise on Wall
Street.
   Whatever action there was Thursday seemed confined to takeover
speculation and dividend-capture strategies. Trading was largely
limited to professional investors who locked in small gains by
selling late in the day.
   ``What usually happens in a market like this when it's so
lackluster is that they wind up the rumor mill,'' said Philip C.
Puccio, senior vice president and manager of institutional trading
at Dillon, Read & Co. in New York. ``It's the only thing that gets
the adrenalin pumping.''
   Some analysts were slightly more optimistic about the market
prospects, based on what they called the resilience of prices in
the face of disappointing news on the trade deficit earlier this
week. That suggested most selling had been drained from the market
and buyers could step in.
   Paul Campbell, a vice president at Nikko Securities Co.
International in New York, said he believed the Dow average ``might
take a swing at 2,050. But that should about do it.''
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about a 7-to-6 margin
in nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks,
with 740 issues up, 644 down and 587 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the NYSE totaled 139.82 million shares,
down from 169.50 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trading at
regional exchanges and on the over-the-counter market, totaled
159.96 million shares.
   Among the most prominent issues, Kroger gained 2{ to 35 on
renewed rumors that the supermarket chain was the object of a
takeover. Pennwalt rose 2\ to 84\ after the company agreed to sell
its pharmaceutical operations to the British firm Fisons for $450
million.
   Other possible acquisition targets included Grow Group, which
surged 2| to 15|; and Lubrizol, which jumped 1{ to 38{.
   Upjohn rose | to 32] after the company said the government had
approved the sale of its anti-baldness drug, minoxidil.
   Westinghouse fell | to 49|. The company agreed to pay an
apparent-record $35 million to settle an age-discrimination lawsuit.
   The Wilshire Associates Equity Index, the market value of NYSE,
American and over-the-counter issues, rose by $4.1 billion.
   The NYSE composite index of all listed issues rose 0.17 to
147.81.
   Standard & Poor's industrial index rose 0.43 to 299.90, and
S&P's 500-stock composite index rose 0.26 to 261.03.
   At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index rose 0.83
to 294.96. The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter
market closed at 377.22, up 1.00.

   Anheuser-Busch Cos. Inc. said Thursday it will
begin marketing its new Michelob Dry beer in five markets Sept. 1
in the first phase of a national rollout.
   The nation's biggest brewer said the super-premium brand will be
introduced simultaneously in Fresno and Santa Barbara, Calif.;
Houston; Tallahassee, Fla.; and Dayton, Ohio.
   Dry beer is less sweet and has less of an aftertaste than
regular beer. It has become a sensation in the Japanese beer
market, where it was first developed.
   Dry beer in Japan has a higher alcohol content than regular
beer, but Anheuser-Busch said its dry beer alcohol content would be
approximately 5 percent of volume, the level of American beers set
by federal law.

<HEAD>Coffee Futures Surge On Brazilian Dry Spell</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Coffee futures prices rose sharply Thursday on New York's
Coffee, Sugar & Cocoa Exchange but analysts said fears of
dry-weather damage to the Brazilian coffee crop _ the main reason
for the rally _ were unrealistic.
   Elsewhere, frozen pork belly futures soared the permitted daily
limit; most livestock futures gained; copper and precious metals
moved up; crop and energy futures were mostly higher; and
stock-index futures advanced.
   The weather has been dry in Brazil, the world's largest
coffee-producing nation, but that's not unusual, analysts said.
   ``They normally get barely any rainfall between May and August
and the fact that they've had maybe a little less than barely any
is really having very little impact on the crop,'' said Sandra
Kaul, coffee market analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in New
York.
   She said the Brazilian coffee crop would not enter its flowering
stage _ the next phase of development in which normal rainfall is
essential _ until mid-September.
   Arthur Stevenson, coffee market analyst with Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc. in New York, said the current dry spell might have
reminded traders of a drought that damaged the Brazilian coffee
crop in the fall of 1985.
   ``I suppose some people are looking for a repeat performance but
the market is anticipating something that hasn't happened yet,''
Stevenson said.
   More likely, other analysts said, traders holding positions
obligating them to buy coffee at a future date were talking up the
possibility of drought damage in hopes of driving prices higher so
they could sell at a profit.
   Coffee for delivery in September settled 3.92 cents higher at
$1.2209 a pound.
   Frozen pork belly futures soared the daily 2-cents-a-pound limit
on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange in a rally motivated by
technical rather than supply-and-demand factors, analysts said.
   ``There's still a big supply of bellies available and they're
moving right now, but they're supposed to,'' said Michael Murphy,
an analyst in Chicago with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   The strong belly market supported hog futures while most cattle
futures gained on reports of continued strength in the cash cattle
markets, he said.
   Live cattle were .30 cent lower to .47 cent higher with August
at 71.22 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .25 cent lower to .30
cent higher with August at 82 cents a pound; hogs were .35 cent
lower to .85 cent higher with August at 47.40 cents a pound; frozen
pork bellies were 2 cents higher across the board with August at
36.70 cents a pound.
   Copper futures moved sharply higher on New York's Commodity
Exchange on supply concerns linked to a strike at the Sudbury,
Ontario, facilities of the Canadian mining company Falconbridge
Ltd., analysts said.
   World inventories of copper have been fairly tight for more than
a year and while Falconbridge is not a major producer, any signs of
futher tightening tend to prod this ``sleeping bull market,'' said
George Anagnos, an analyst with Thomson McKinnon Securities Inc.
   Copper for September delivery settled 2.95 cents higher at 97.25
cents a pound.
   Gold and silver futures advanced slightly in featureless trading
on the Comex.
   Gold was $1.20 to $1.40 higher with October at $436.30 a troy
ounce; silver was 2.4 cents to 2.8 cents higher with September at
$6.69 a troy ounce.
   Grain and soybean futures closed mostly higher on the Chicago
Board of Trade with support stemming from rumors the Soviet Union
was considering new purchases of U.S. corn, analysts said.
   Traders continued to focus on export news instead of weather
factors, said Ted Mao, grain specialist with Shearson Lehman Hutton.
   ``The market seems like it wants to be more responsive to the
demand side right now,'' he said.
   Wheat settled 2 cents to 4\ cents higher with September at
$3.92\ a bushel; corn was 2 cents lower to 3 cents higher with
September at $2.87} a bushel; oats were 4 cents to 9{ cents lower
with September at $2.61 a bushel; soybeans were 3 cents lower to 4
cents higher with August at $8.81 a bushel.
   Most oil futures prices closed mostly higher Thursday on the New
York Mercantile Exchange in positioning ahead of the September
crude oil contract's expiration on Monday.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil was 7 cents lower to 10 cents
higher with September at $15.57 a barrel; heating oil was .10 cent
to .22 cent higher with September at 44.15 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .10 cent to .66 cent higher with September at 47.28
cents a gallon.
   Stock index futures advanced slightly on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, where the contract for September delivery of the Standard
& Poor's 500 index settled .20 point higher at 261.45.

<HEAD>Money Funds Rose $3 Billion in Latest Week</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Interest rate figures reported by Donoghue's Money Fund
Report are for week ended Tuesday. All other figures are for the
week ended Wednesday.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Assets of the nation's 447 money market mutual
funds rose by $3 billion in the latest week, the Investment Company
Institute said Thursday.
   The rise to $268.56 billion in the seven-day period ended
Wednesday, followed a revised $846.5 million rise in the funds'
assets the previous week, according to the Washington-based mutual
fund trade group. The increase originally was reported as $840.3
million.
   The Investment Company Institute said that in the latest week,
assets of 221 general purpose funds rose $1.66 billion to $85.36
billion, a record high amount for that category.
   Assets of 101 broker-dealer funds increased by $770.6 million to
$113.98 billion, and assets of 125 institutional funds rose $575.3
million to $69.22 billion, the institute reported.
   Jacob Dreyer, the institute's chief economist, attributed the
increases largely to the growing attractiveness of yields on money
market funds vs. yields on money-market accounts and short-term
certificates of deposit.
   The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds rose in
the week ended Tuesday to 7.14 percent from 6.98 percent the
previous week, according to Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a trade
journal based in Holliston, Mass.
   The 30-day average yield rose to 6.99 percent from 6.90 percent,
Donoghue's said.
   The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was
34 days, unchanged from the previous week, Donoghue's said.
   The newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of 100 leading
commercial banks, savings and loan assocations and savings banks in
the nation's 10 largest markets showed the effective annual yield
available on money market accounts rose to 5.87 percent as of
Wednesday from 5.83 percent a week earlier.
   The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based newsletter said the effective
annual yield available on special savings accounts, called Super
NOW accounts, was 5.13 percent, unchanged.
   Bank Rate Monitor said the effective annual yield was 7.51
percent on six-month certificates of deposit, up from 7.42 the
previous week. Yields were 7.82 percent on 1-year CDs, up from 7.72
percent; 8.12 percent on 2{-year CDs, up from 8.04 percent; and
8.45 percent on 5-year CDs, up from 8.40 percent.

<HEAD>Mark IV Raises Its Offer For Armtek</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mark IV Industries Inc. on Thursday
sweetened its tender offer for Armtek Corp. to $44 a share, or
about $550 million, a day after Armtek's board rejected its initial
offer as inadequate.
   Armtek's board on Wednesday urged stockholders not to tender
their shares to Mark IV's original $40-a-share tender offer. The
board also directed management to consider measures to increase the
company's stock price.
   Bob Jones, an Armtek spokesman, said the company's board had no
immediate comment on the new offer, which covers all outstanding
shares and associated preferred stock purchase rights.
   In a letter to the Armtek board, Mark IV Chairman Sal H. Alfiero
reiterated his request for a meeting ``to discuss any and all
aspects of our increased offer, including the price to be paid to
Armtek stockholders.''
   Armtek is facing four class action suits in Delaware, where it
is incorporated, from shareholders who charge the company's
directors are trying to thwart the takeover attempt and haven't
satisfactorily explored the offer.
   One suit claims Armtek's directors have ``embarked upon a course
of action designed to entrench themselves in the management and
control of Armtek and to protect and enhance their personal
financial benefits'' at the expense of shareholders.
   Armtek, formerly known as Armstrong Rubber Co., is a supplier of
engineered drive and heat exchange systems, modules and components
and specialty polymers. It had $1.2 billion in sales last year.
   Two month ago, Armtek sold its largest unit, Armstrong Tire Co.,
to the Italian tire maker Pirelli Group for $197 million, capping a
corporate restructuring.
   Mark IV, based in West Amherst, N.Y., produces professional
audio, technical and aerospace products. The company had 1987 sales
of $292 million.
   Mark IV's new offer will expire at midnight Sept. 2, unless
extended.

<TEXT>
   The trial over suits stemming from the
$2.25 billion Washington Public Power Supply System bond default is
scheduled to begin Sept. 7, but lawyers say jury selection and
other factors could delay the start of testimony until Sept. 26.
   In another development at a pretrial hearing here Thursday, it
was announced that a law firm sued as a result of the biggest
municipal-bond default in history had settled out of court for an
undisclosed amount.
   U.S. District Judge William D. Browning has said jurors will not
hear testimony on Fridays. Chemical Bank attorney Thomas Barr
estimated that the four-day-a-week format, plus jury selection,
opening arguments, and Jewish holiday observances, could mean the
first witness may not take the stand until Sept. 26.
   More than 24,000 bondholders and Chemical Bank, a trustee for
bondholders, are suing the supply system for damages from the 1983
default of bonds sold to build two nuclear power plants in western
Washington. The plants never were completed.
   Melvin Weiss, an attorney for the plaintiffs, announced during
the proceeding that Wood & Dawson, a New York- and Washington-based
law firm which served as bond counsel for WPPSS, tentatively had
agreed to an out-of-court settlement.
   Details were not immediately announced, and could come Friday or
Monday.
   Attorneys said out-of-court settlements, not including the one
announced Thursday, have totaled $276 million so far.

   The U.S. dollar recovered slightly from a lower
opening against the Japanese yen on Friday, while share prices
edged higher in quiet trading on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
   The dollar opened at 133.23 yen, down 0.70 yen from the previous

currency was changing hands at 133.43 yen by late morning.
   ``There is a strong wait-and-see mood in the market,'' said one
foreign exchange dealer, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   In the stock market, the widely-watched Nikkei Stock Average of

   A stock dealer in Tokyo, who asked not to be identified, said
the market was slow because it had no clear no direction at the
moment.
   ``It's just a few stocks that are getting picked up and

<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New York-based Bear Stearns Cos. has announced it
will purchase another prominent chunk of the Dallas skyline, the
60-story First Interstate Bank Tower and adjacent property for $167
million.
   Bear Stearns said Tuesday it had organized an investment group
to buy the angular, green-glass skyscraper and adjacent property
from Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co.
   The deal will be the second purchase by Bear Stearns in downtown
Dallas. The investment banking firm already agreed to buy 40 of the
50 floors of Thanksgiving Tower from companies controlled by the
billionaire Hunt family.
   Bear Stearns also has been hired as an adviser to the owners of
three commercial properties in Dallas and may buy into those
projects as well, company officials said.
   The buyer group for First Interstate Bank Tower includes New
York investor Norman Alexander; Dallas-based Crosland Investment
Properties Inc.; New York-based M&M Realty Partners L.P.; and
American Universal Insurance Co., of Providence, R.I.
   ``Each of them has made a signifcant cash investment in the
deal,'' said Stephen P. Jarchow, managing director of Bear Stearns'
Dallas office.
   Bear Stearns plans to invest about $1 billion in Texas real
estate in the next two to three years, company officials said.
   Manufacturers Hanover has owned First Interstate Bank Tower
since April 1987, when it foreclosed on the building after its
developers, Dallas-based Criswell Cos., defaulted on $214 million
in construction loans.
   Manufacturers Hanover has agreed to finance $125.5 million of
the deal, which is expected to close in September, officials said.

<TEXT>
   Northrop Corp. has announced plans to
restructure its debt by converting up to $450 million of short-term
bank loans to intermediate-term notes sold privately to investors.
   The Wall Street Journal quoted unidentified sources Wednesday as
saying the private placement represented a change from earlier
plans to sell notes to the public, and said the switch was brought
about by concern over investigations into the company's dealings in
South Korea.
   But Northrop spokesman Tony Cantafio denied Wednesday that plans
for the debt offering had been changed, saying the company had been
considering various alternatives for converting the debt since
first announcing its intention to do so in April.
   ``We explored a number of financing alternatives available to us
... and the private placement plan was adopted in July,'' Cantafio
said.
   Plans for a private sale of notes were revealed in the company's
second-quarter report.
   The Journal, quoting an unidentified investment banker who had
dealt with Northrop on the matter, said the company originally
planned to sell notes to the public.
   The investment banker said the public offering had been ruled
out for fear approval of the offering could be delayed if the
Securities and Exchange Commission decided to study the company's
activities in South Korea.
   A private placement, involving sale of notes to institutions and
wealthy individuals, would be exempt from registration with the SEC.
   A congressional committee and a federal grand jury in Los
Angeles are looking into payments the company made to Korean
companies and individuals in 1984 and 1986 in connection with
attempts to sell its ill-fated F-20 fighter jet to the South Korean
government. Northrop denies any impropriety.
   The sale of notes is intended to reduce the risk that rising
interest rates could push up the cost of servicing the company's
$905 million worth of short-term, floating-interest-rate bank
loans. The notes would have fixed interest rates.
