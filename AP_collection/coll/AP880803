   The year Birdie May Vogt was born, Alexander Graham
Bell patented the telephone, Rutherford B. Hayes became president,
and Gen. George Custer had his last stand at the Little Big Horn.
   The year was 1876.
   Today, Ms. Vogt was celebrating her 112th birthday.
   Born in Akron, Ohio, on Aug. 3, 1876, her longevity has earned
Ms. Vogt a listing in the 1989 edition of the Guinness Book of
World Records due out in October as the world's oldest person,
according to Guinness Assistant Editor Cyd Smith.
   But the subsequent discovery by Guinness officials of Madame
Calment, born in Arles, France, Feb. 21, 1875, makes Ms. Vogt the
world's second-oldest known inhabitant, Smith said.
   Guinness editors plan to correct the error in an updated section
at the back of the edition, Smith added.
   Ms. Vogt planned to celebrate her birthday with balloons and a
cake at the East Ridge Retirement Village in Cutler Ridge, her home
for the past quarter century.
   ``We're very proud of her,'' said Bonnie Barton, director of
activities at the village's medical center.
   Despite eyesight and hearing problems, Ms. Vogt remains alert
and healthy, Ms. Barton said.
   Ms. Barton said Ms. Vogt is incredibly receptive toward babies.
   ``Her whole face just brightens right up when she sees
children,'' Ms. Barton said.

   As novelist John Mortimer would reflect, the way
some people reacted, ``we might have been plotting to pinch the
Crown Jewels'' by gathering to grouse about Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher's policies.
   All the author of ``Paradise Postponed'' and the ``Rumpole'' TV
series did was attend a soiree in June at the home of Lady Antonia
Fraser, the historian. The liberal literary set assembled there for
a discussion of how to counter Mrs. Thatcher's plans to bury
British socialism.
   The reactions of some right-wing commentators illustrate the
bilious tenor of political debate in this 10th year of the Thatcher
revolution.
   Intellectuals have never enjoyed the esteem in Britain that
their peers are accorded in France and Germany.
   ``British intellectuals tend to disguise themselves,'' said
Patrick Bateson, provost of King's College, Cambridge.
   In this case, having poked their heads above ground at the
Fraser dinner, they have come in for attacks ranging from the snide
through the derisive to the downright belligerent.
   Common themes are these: writers know nothing of politics, they
have become richer in the Thatcher years, they are ``champagne
socialists'' out of touch with the masses they claim to defend, and
other regimes would put them in jail.
   The Sunday Telegraph headlined ``The Betrayal of the
Intellectuals'' and its editor, Peregrine Worsthorne, got even more
personal.
   Writing in the conservative weekly Spectator, Worsthorne
questioned the propriety of Lady Antonia holding her do in the room
once used for conservative gatherings by her first husband, the
late Sir Hugh Fraser, whom she left for playwright Harold Pinter.
   Writer Paul Bailey argued in the centrist Independent newspaper
that Lady Antonia and Co. had been enriched by Mrs. Thatcher's tax
cuts. He found ``comic appeal'' in their concern for the poor.
   D.J. Taylor wrote in the conservative Evening Standard that it
was ``an anti-Thatcherite cabal'' and ``a rather dangerous joke,''
then shot himself in the foot by deriding the group for lacking
such high-caliber writers such as Ian McEwan and Salman Rushdie _
both of whom were indeed present.
   Lady Antonia's dinner was not the only stirring of organized
intellectual dissent. Center-left academics formed a think tank
last month devoted to challenging Thatcherite doctrine.
   ``The right have managed to persuade the public of a range of
myths that need to be exploded,'' said Baroness Tessa Blackstone,
head of the socialist-oriented Birkbeck College in London and of
the new Institute for Policy Research.
   Among the ``myths'' she named at a news conference: the free
market is sacrosanct, inequality is essential to a prosperous
society, all nationalized industry is bad, and ``to manifest social
concern is to be wet,'' _ Mrs. Thatcher's term for bleeding-heart
liberalism.
   The catalyst of the intellectual ferment was Mrs. Thatcher's
third successive election victory in June 1987, unprecedented in
Britain's modern times.
   She considers it a mandate to implement her most radical reforms
and has launched a program ranging from revamping the state health,
education and welfare systems to curbing promotion of homosexuality.
   In rolling back the liberal legacy of the 1960s, Mrs. Thatcher
seems to be borrowing an old slogan of her friend Ronald Reagan:
``You ain't seen nothin' yet.''
   Lady Antonia said all this motivated her to invite Mortimer,
novelist Margaret Drabble, feminist guru Germaine Greer and other
eminent figures to dinner.
   ``We were talking about the way society was going,'' she told
the conservative Sunday Times, ``Clause 28 (on homosexuality), the
cuts in welfare ... people sleeping rough in the streets. ... We
said, so many people must be talking like this and can we do
anything? If we try, at least we can tell our grandchildren that we
tried.''
   Rushdie, author of ``Midnight's Children,'' called it ``our
first, hesitant efforts to join forces against the present
regime.'' In an article for the liberal weekly Observer, he added:
``I'm damned if I'll be apologetic.''
   Such intellectual stirrings are but a pinprick for Mrs. Thatcher
at this stage because the economy is strong and unemployment is
falling. A Sunday Times poll indicated 74 percent of Britons are at
least fairly satisfied with their lot and 62 percent support her
economic policies.

   Faisal Husseini, a top pro-PLO activist jailed
by Israel, has emerged as a local leader respected by dovish
Israelis for his willingness to negotiate directly with the Jewish
state.
   ``Husseini has a keen sense of realism, and in this case,
realism means compromise,'' said Moshe Amirav, who was kicked out
of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's right-wing Likud bloc after
holding secret talks with Husseini last year.
   The soft-spoken, 48-year-old Husseini was arrested Sunday and
ordered held without trial for six months. He has already served 12
months in prison under two similar sentences.
   One period of arrest began in September 1987, shortly after
Husseini's talks with Amirav were revealed. The latest arrest came
just days after he told an Israeli audience in a rare public
dialogue that he endorsed direct talks with Israeli leaders,
including hardliner Shamir.
   It was seen as an effort by Israel to prevent the expansion of
Palestine Liberation Organization activities following the decision
by King Hussein of Jordan to sever his nation's legal and
administrative ties with the occupied West Bank.
   U.S. officials and Israeli liberals condemned Husseini's arrest,
saying Israel should encourage Palestinians who seek accommodation
with Israel.
   ``If I were prime minister, I wouldn't have put him in jail. I
would have said to him, `Let's sit down and talk business,''' said
Amirav.
   In The Hague, the Dutch government Tuesday pressed for
Husseini's early release, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said,
speaking anonymously in line with ministry practice.
   He said roving Ambassador Henk Vijverberg told Israeli
Ambassador Zev Sufott during a routine meeting that the Netherlands
was ``concerned'' about the detention and that it ``jeopardized
possible dialogue'' between the Israeli government and moderate
Palestinians.
   The spokesman noted that Foreign Minister Hans van den Broek met
with Husseini and other Palestinian representatives during an
official visit to Israel last month.
   The Israeli newspaper Davar described Husseini as an important
potential negotiating partner and said he would be a contender for
the job of prime minister in a future Palestinian state.
   ``If the partner for dialogue is not going to be a Hashemite
ruler like Hussein, it will be a Palestinian personality like
Husseini,'' said Davar, which is close to the left-of-center Labor
Party.
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin has described Husseini as the top
PLO official in the occupied territories and has accused him of
agitating against Israel.
   Husseini is a scion of one of the largest and most powerful
Palestinian clans.
   His great uncle was Haj Amin el Husseini, the fiercely
anti-Jewish mufti of Jerusalem who served as president of the
Supreme Moslem Council in Palestine from 1920 to 1944.
   Faisal Husseini's father, Abdel Khader Husseini, commanded Arab
forces in Jerusalem in the 1948 Middle East war. He was killed in
the fighting.
   As a young man, Husseini studied at a military college in
Damascus, Syria, and became an X-ray technician. He later developed
a love for history, and studied the subject for two years in
Beirut, Lebanon in the 1970s.
   But Husseini had to break off his studies when Israeli officials
placed him under town arrest in Jerusalem from 1981 to 1987,
forbidding him from leaving the city limits and confining him to
his home from sundown to sunrise.
   He was accused of subversive activites but not put on trial.
   Police said after Husseini's arrest Sunday that he had renewed
``subversive hostile activities,'' including coordination and
incitement of the 8-month-old Arab uprising in the occupied lands.
   Police also closed Husseini's Arab Studies Institute for one
year, charging it was controlled and financed by the PLO and served
as a meeting place for PLO activists.
   Staff members said the institute was funded by international
grants and provided information about the Palestinian people and
its history.
   Four days before his latest arrest, Husseini participated in a
public dialogue with dovish Israelis, fielding tough questions from
some participants and winning applause for his answers.
   Asked whether Palestinians would be satisfied with a state
alongside Israel, and not use it as a stepping stone to capturing
all of Israel, he said:
   ``Indeed, I do have a dream. But just as I am not willing to let
others impose their dreams upon me, I am not willing to impose my
dreams on my fellow men.''
   Husseini's wife, Najat, said she believes her husband was
arrested because of his dialogue with Israeli peace activists.
   ``Whenever he speaks about peace, they put him in prison,'' Mrs.
Husseini said.

   Here, at a glance, is a look at Namibia, also known as
South-West Africa, the country that is to receive independence
under an accord on principles accepted in U.S.- mediated peace
talks between South Africa, Cuba and Angola:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   HISTORY _ The Portuguese were the first whites to reach the
territory's Atlantic coast in the 15th century. The Dutch, British
and Germans came later, and Germany declared the territory a
protectorate in 1884. South Africa occupied the land during World
War I and began to administer it in 1920 under a League of Nations
mandate. The league's successor, the United Nations, terminated the
mandate in 1966. The South-West Africa People's Organization,
SWAPO, has been leading an armed guerrilla struggle against the
South Africans since 1966 in a bid to obtain independence for
Namibia.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   TERRITORY _ About 15 percent of the 318,260-square-mile country
is covered by the Namib desert. Despite its immense size it has
only 1.3 million people. More than half are from the Ovambo tribe
and live in the north. There are less than 100,000 whites.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   GOVERNMENT _ South Africa continues to administer the territory.
Louis Pienaar, the administrator-general, is appointed by and
reports directly to the South African government. Pienaar heads a
multiracial transitional government that is designed to give way to
an elected government when the territory receives independence.

   ECONOMY _ Ranching and the mining of diamonds and minerals are
the two main industries. Only about one-third of the country has
sufficient rain for farming.

   REFUGEES _ About 69,000 Namibians have fled to neighboring
Angola. About 7,000 have fled to Botswana and Zambia, two other
African ``Frontline States.''

<HEAD>Despite State of War, Jordan Pumps Millions Into Occupied West
Bank</HEAD>

   Israel may hold the mortgage, but Jordan has
millions of dollars on deposit in the occupied West Bank.
   Although Jordan is officially at war with Israel, the Arab
nation has nevertheless bankrolled Palestinian jobs and education
in the disputed territory for more than two decades.
   This odd relationship appears likely to change now that King
Hussein has announced he will sever legal and administrative ties
with the West Bank.
   Hussein so far has declined to be specific about what links
would be eliminated. But Palestinians fear a key lifeline to the
outside world could be cut off if he cancels passports held by most
of the West Bank's 850,000 Palestinians or closes the Allenby
Bridge linking the West Bank to Jordan.
   Hussein, whose grandfather united the east and west banks of the
Jordan River in 1950, sends up to $200 million annually to the West
Bank and east Jerusalem for hospitals, Islamic institutions,
agriculture and education, according to Yasser Obeid, the director
of the West Bank's Arab Health Center.
   The money covers salaries to 21,000 former Jordanian government
officials, lawyers who went on strike after the 1967 occupation,
and Palestinian teachers.
   In addition, Jordan has contributed $12 million annually to the
Wakf, or Moslem Religious Council, which oversees Jerusalem's
landmark Al Aqsa and Dome of the Rock mosques.
   Palestinians in West Bank and east Jerusalem classrooms study
Jordanian textbooks, and college qualification examinations are
sent across the Allenby Bridge from Amman.
   The Jordanian dinar is the main form of currency in the West
Bank and the Cairo-Amman Bank opened a branch two years ago in
Nablus, the West Bank's largest city. Since then, Palestinians have
deposited $45 million into the bank.
   Despite Hussein's move to distance his kingdom from the
Israeli-held territory, Obeid predicted Jordan still would wield
influence in the West Bank.
   ``We Palestinians and Jordanians are one people ... and the
relationship between us will not change,'' he said in an interview.
``Hussein provided funding not to win hearts, but because he felt
obliged to support our people under occupation.''
   Amin Majaj, one of 30 Palestinians who lost their Jordanian
Parliament seats this week when Hussein dissolved the lower house,
disagrees.
   ``It's very likely Hussein will lose influence in the West Bank.
Just think of the institutions and employees who depend on Jordan.
What about them?'' Majaj, an east Jerusalem doctor, said in an
interview.
   In announcing his intention to bow out of the West Bank, Hussein
apparently intended to send a message to the Palestine Liberation
Organization that he would not take their place at a table to
negotiate Middle East peace, as Israel has suggested.
   The Israeli proposal is based on the U.S.-brokered 1978 Camp
David agreement between Israel and Egypt, which included a
prominent role for Jordan in negotiating the future of the occupied
territories.
   One Israeli official told The Associated Press that, while
apparently pulling back from an active role in negotiations,
Hussein also ``is telling the PLO: `Remember, there are things I
can do for the Palestinians that you can't do. I have quite a lot
of clout.'''
   ``Hussein just has to be careful not to go too far, because 70
percent of his own people are Palestinians, and he doesn't need any
trouble from them,'' the official said on condition of anonymity.
   Hanna Siniora, pro-PLO editor of the east Jerusalem daily
newspaper Al Fajr, predicted Hussein would benefit from his
decision to loosen his hold on the West Bank.
   ``Jordan will gain a new relationship with the Palestinians
based on respect for their national rights,'' he told The AP.
   Most Israeli officials say privately they doubt Hussein will
take drastic steps, such as closing the bridges between Jordan and
the West Bank that Palestinians rely on for business and as their
main link with the Arab world.
   ``What has happened up to now is mainly symbolic and doesn't
have a real effect on the daily life in the West Bank,'' said an
Israeli diplomatic source. ``In our assessment, he might take
another step or two, but will stop short'' of taking drastic steps.
   In one step, state-run Jordan television canceled weather
reports and a Palestinian program for the occupied territories, the
television's news editor said Tuesday from Amman.
   However, the editor, Alfred Asfoor, said the programs might be
aired again in the future.

Nurses said Ms. Jordan is very independent and ``likes to do

   When a congressman ``fed up with crime'' found a
suspected burglar in his own house, he armed himself with a tree
limb, threatened to break the man's legs and held him until police
came.
   ``I don't recommend that people do this, but I guess it was just
instinct,'' Rep. Edolphus Towns, D-N.Y., said after Tuesday's
confrontation.
   Towns, 54, said he was at his Brooklyn home when a man entered
through a second-floor window.
   ``I heard the noise, went into the room and saw him, then I
yelled,'' Towns said. The would-be burglar climbed back out the
window as Towns tried to grab the man's leg.
   Towns ran from the house and waited near his garage while the
burglar jumped from the roof.
   The congressman, holding the tree limb, told the man, ``Don't
get up, if you do I'm going to break your legs,'' he said. Towns'
wife called police.
   The man, who was not armed, was charged with burglary and
criminal possession of drug paraphernalia. Police said he would not
give his name.
   ``I'm just so sick and tired and fed up with crime,'' Towns
said. ``We have to do everything we possibly can to eliminate
crime.''

<TEXT>
   Researchers at the Oak Ridge National
Laboratory have found what atomic theorists said shouldn't exist: a
stable ion of calcium.
   ``This was a surprise,'' University of Tennessee physicist David
J. Pegg, one of the researchers, said Tuesday.
   ``There is no immediate direct application, but the information
may be used as a building block,'' Pegg said. ``If nobody cared ...
about the structure of atoms we wouldn't have lasers or transistors
or anything like that.''
   The findings were included in a four-page report in Physics
Today, a journal of the American Physical Society, and in Physical
Review Letters, Science News and a British publication called The
New Scientist.
   Atoms are usually electrically neutral because they have the
same number of positively charged protons and negatively charged
electrons. An ion is an atom or group of atoms with an electrical
charge.
   Theory held that calcium, along with barium, strontium and other
elements in a series known as alkaline earths, should not be able
to hold a negative charge, Pegg said. The theory was that the atoms
would automatically discharge any extra electron they picked up,
ridding themselves of the negative charge.
   Pegg and his assistant, UT graduate student Jeffrey Thompson,
along with Oak Ridge scientists Robert Compton and Gerald Alton,
decided to test the theory.
   To their surprise they found that when they added an electron to
a calcium atom, the electron stayed there, giving the atom a
negative charge.
   ``So we then said, `Perhaps the theorists are wrong,''' Pegg
said.
   The next step was to see if they could knock the electron off
the atom, since it wouldn't leave of its own accord.
   Using a laser beam, the researchers found that they could knock
the electron off, and concluded the ion was stable, Pegg said.
   Studying the stability of negative calcium ions is something
that required the most modern equipment, Pegg said, particularly
the Cray supercomputer at Vanderbilt University.
   ``Somebody may have tried to do this in the 1960s, for instance,
and couldn't,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   A federal jury Tuesday convicted two men
and deadlocked in the case of a third man accused in the December
shooting and burning deaths of two Navajo tribal police officers.
   The jury found Thomas Cly, 22, and Vinton Bedoni, 31, guilty of
two counts of first-degree murder each. The two also were convicted
of aiding and abetting and use of a firearm in a crime.
   The jury was ordered back to the jury room after reading
verdicts on Cly and Bedoni, but was unable to reach a verdict on
the third defendant, Ben Atene Jr., 24. U.S. District Judge J.
Thomas Greene declared a mistrial and ordered Atene returned to the
Salt Lake County Jail, where he is being held without bail.
   Prosecutors said they would not dismiss charges against Atene in
the slayings of officers Roy Lee Stanley and Andy Begay, whose
charred bodies were found inside a burned-out police truck in a
remote southern Utah canyon on Dec. 5.
   During the trial, prosecution witnesses testified that the
officers were shot as they tried to break up a bonfire drinking
party on the night of Dec. 4. Alcohol is prohibited on the Navajo
Indian Reservation.
   When the verdicts were read to a silent courtroom by the court
clerk, Cly and Bedoni remained expressionless, but Cly looked
toward the ceiling for a long moment.
   Greene scheduled sentencing for Cly and Bedoni on Oct. 3. They
face maximum possible sentences of life in prison.
   Attorney Ed Brass said he was certain Cly would appeal. Defense
attorney Robert VanSciver said he planned to discuss the
possibility with his client, Bedoni.
   ``I'm disappointed, it was a hard case, we struggled,''
VanSciver said. ``I think we got a fair trial, but the chips will
fall where they may.''
   Brass insisted that Cly is innocent.
   ``That's not a criticism of the jury. They obviously saw it
differently,'' he said.
   During the trial, government and defense witnesses offered
conflicting accounts of where the defendants were the night the
officers were killed. Five prosecution witnesses placed the trio at
the bonfire scene, but defense witnesses and the defendants said
they were elsewhere.
   In closing arguments, prosecutors told jurors their witnesses
had no reason to lie. Defense attorneys said the prosecution's case
was based on lies that were made up in response to authorities
threats of perjury charges or to collect a $10,000 reward.
   The 12-member jury got the case Thursday and reached its
verdicts on the fifth day of deliberations.

   Communist Hungary will soon publish
``Sexpress,'' its first sex magazine, with British pop star
Samantha Fox on the cover of the first issue, the official MTI news
agency reported.
   The 80-page publication, to sell for about $2.20, will be
published jointly by High Society GMBH of West Germany, the
Nepszava publishing house in Budapest and the National Health
Protection Council, MTI said Tuesday.
   It will cover issues of sexual culture, health, sports and
physical fitness, the report said.
   ``The magazine's price is rather high by Hungarian standards.
Nevertheless, the first 100,000 copies are expected to sell out
quickly,'' MTI said.
   Three more issues are planned to come out this year, the report
said.
   The Hungarian publishers say they plan to donate part of their
expected 20 percent profit to ``AIDS research and publicit on how
to prevent the spread of the disease,'' in Hungary, MTI said.

   A man who died clutching a $52,000
check at a bank had lived as a pauper despite a large stash of
money in numerous accounts, authorities said.
   Edward Joseph Richer, 58, collapsed and died of a heart attack
while opening an account at Empire of America Federal Savings Bank
on June 10. Police have since been unraveling his secret life.
   ``It was pretty unusual, unfolding two lives of an unknown
entity,'' Detective Steve Labbitt said Tuesday. ``I've narrowed it
down to defrauding federal and state welfare agencies.''
   Richer had been receiving $575 monthly in Social Security
disability payments since December 1986 under his name and that of
Ernest Helmut Cords, Labbitt said. Cords was a falsified identity,
authorities said.
   When he died, Richer was holding a $52,600 check made out to
Cords. In addition to his own driver's license, credit cards and
bank cards, a second wallet contained identification for Cords,
also 58.
   A half-dozen ``sizeable accounts'' opened in the names of Richer
and Cords at banks in Los Angeles and Orange counties put his
wealth at about $250,000, said Labbitt.
   Neighbors were shocked about the secret accounts.
   ``He was in dire straits, always just scraping by,'' said John
Arciero, Richer's next door neighbor of 13 years in Venice.
   Richer lived a poor man's life, dressing in old clothes and
collecting food and goods behind neighborhood markets in an effort
to sell them and make a few extra bucks, they said.
   The address on Richer's bogus driver's license was a rented
postal box in suburban Venice. The $52,600 check, a federal voucher
issued after a recent savings and loan failure, carried the address
of a Santa Monica post office box.
   Labbitt said Richer's son, Barnaby, was located through a
telephone number found in the dead man's wallet. The younger Richer
identified his father's body, but said he'd never heard of Ernest
Helmut Cords.
   Labbitt said the man's double identity was either an elaborate
scheme to avoid taxes or ``maybe he just liked to see his accounts
grow and make people think he wasn't wealthy.''
   The case has been turned over to state welfare officials, the
officer said.

<HEAD>Death Toll Raised, Little Hope Held Out For Missing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chinese officials today raised to 256 the death
toll in flash floods that struck China's mainly agricultural
coastal province of Zhejiang last weekend.
   The official China News Service, in a report monitored in Hong
Kong, also said 316 people were missing after the downpour.
   On Tuesday, the official Xinhua News Agency said 225 people were
killed and 449 were missing in the deluge and sudden flooding,
which struck Friday and Saturday.
   Xinhua said 100,000 people were affected by the flooding, which
destroyed more than 16,000 homes, broke 100 reservoirs and 305
bridges and caused damage estimated at $167 million.
   Qiu Weikang, an official from the flood-hit city of Ningbo, said
today that the search continued for the missing.
   But a provincial foreign affairs official who identified himself
only as Huang said chances of finding any more survivors were slim
because the floods came so fast that farmers had no time to escape.
   He called the flooding the worst ever to hit the densely
populated province.
   Qiu said as much as 18 inches of rain fell in a five- or
six-hour period in parts of the five hard-hit counties around
Ningbo, a prosperous commercial city on the East China Sea.
   He said the rainfall was the heaviest in 100 years.
   Qiu said the floodwaters have receded, electricity and water
supplies have been restored and roads have been reopened.
   The city has mobilized efforts to donate clothing to disaster
victims. Private entrepreneurs also donated money, Qiu said.
   The storm triggered Zhejiang's second flood disaster of the
year. Forty-five died after torrential rains in late June.
   At least 750 people have been reported killed in floods ravaging
coastal, southern and northern China this year, while wide areas of
central China are suffering from one of the worst droughts in
memory.

<HEAD>Hostage Takers Were `Kids' In Over Their Heads, Prisons Chief Says</HEAD>

   Inmates who took five guards hostage at a
maximum-security prison for more than 14 hours were angry ``kids''
who really didn't know what they were getting into, according to
the state prisons chief.
   The small group of prisoners who took control of the 32-inmate
special disciplinary housing unit at Coxsackie Correctional
Facility on Monday released the last four of the five injured
guards early Tuesday.
   ``I think they got tired,'' said state Corrections Commissioner
Thomas Coughlin of the inmates's surrender.
   ``I think they felt very strongly that they were in over their
heads after the initial assaults. ... We just sat back and waited
and kept talking to them and kept giving them their options.''
   Coughlin said the ordeal was ``15 hours of terror'' for the
guards, some of who were apparently beaten. Two were hospitalized
in good condition Tuesday; three others were treated and released
for minor injuries. One inmate received minor injuries in the
takeover.
   Coughlin and Gov. Mario Cuomo told news conference they believed
the takeover was an unorganized chain of events that might have
been triggered by the heat. Temperatures on Monday were in the 90s.
   ``What we're dealing with is a mob,'' Coughlin said. ``It was a
bunch of young kids acting as a committee of 32. There was no
planning, there was no organization. They knocked an officer down,
they took two other officers' nightsticks and they said, `Oh my
God! Look what we've done now!'''
   The inmates were armed with nightsticks, but didn't have
homemade knives as some believed Monday, Coughlin said.
   According to state Corrections Department records, the oldest
inmate in the unit is 26 years old and most of the prisoners are in
their upper teens or early 20s.
   Outside the prison Monday, guard Ralph Scott had said inmates
had been warning for weeks that there might be trouble. But
Coughlin said Tuesday that none of the usually reliable trouble
signs were evident at the prison, which has 951 inmates and is 20
miles south of Albany.
   ``The indicators that I judge were not there,'' Coughlin said.
``Sure, people were saying it was getting tense. Prisons are tense
in hot weather.''
   Corrections Department spokesman James Flateau said Monday that
some inmates had been complaining about verbal harassment by
guards, but Cuomo said Tuesday the uprising was not a response to
any harassment.
   Cuomo and Coughlin said there were no demands made during the
day-long negotiations, which were mostly between two inmates and
prison Superintendent John Twomey. Cuomo said the inmates had only
requested that they not be beaten up when they released their
hostages.
   All the inmates remained locked in their cells Tuesday, Flateau
said. Investigators still haven't determined how many of the 32
inmates were involved in the uprising and no charges have been
filed yet, Coughlin said.
   The uprising was the longest at a New York state prison since
inmates at Sing Sing held 17 guards hostage for 2{ days in January
1983.

   Eighteen sailors were injured Tuesday battling
a fire that raged in an engine room of the USS Constellation as the
aircraft carrier steamed out to sea for a training mission, Navy
officials said.
   Fourteen sailors were evacuated to Balboa Navy Hospital for
treatment, said Navy spokesman Lt. Cmdr. Bob Pritchard. He said
most of the injuries were smoke-related or burns and all were minor.
   Information from the burning aircraft carrier remained sketchy
Tuesday night, said Pritchard. He said he didn't know how serious
the blaze was or when it might be controlled.
   The entire crew of about 3,000 was probably engaged in the
firefighting efforts, the spokesman said.
   ``This is an all-hands evolution,'' he said.
   The fire in one of the Constellation's four engine rooms started
about 12:10 p.m., when the ship was about four miles off the coast
of San Diego.
   ``They contained the fire within minutes. However, the fire did
reflash'' in mid-afternoon, Pritchard said.
   Initial reports indicated the fire had been contained within the
engine room, he said.
   ``The ship is currently under way with her own power, heading
away from the coast,'' Pritchard said. ``We don't have an exact
position for her.''
   Asked if the ship would return to port, Pritchard said, ``It's
too early to tell. That's going to have to wait until we get an
exact assessment of damage. The No. 1 concern right now is to get
the fire out.''
   In addition to water, firefighters were using foam and powder
fire smothering systems.
   The Federal Aviation Administration imposed a 5-mile air space
restriction around the burning ship about 4:10 p.m, Pritchard said.
   The Constellation, which is conventionally powered, was heading
out for a session in which replacement pilots qualify to fly
various types of aircraft aboard a ship, he said.
   The qualification tests are regularly conducted off the Southern
California coast, he said.

<HEAD>NBC's Oldies Win Another Week</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Mark Harmon was the most-watched man on
television last week, in a four-year-old miniseries that led NBC to
another weekly victory in the A.C. Nielsen Co. ratings.
   Harmon starred in ``Deliberate Stranger,'' a two-part miniseries
about alleged serial killer Ted Bundy. The 18.8 rating on the July
25 episode was the week's highest.
   The first part of ``Deliberate Stranger'' had been the No. 5
show the previous week, with a rating of 14.3.
   NBC said the two parts averaged a 29 percent share of the
viewing audience, the best performance for an NBC miniseries repeat
since ``V'' had the same share figure in 1984.
   Each rating point represents the nation's 886,000 homes with
television. The share is the portion of sets in use in a given time
period.
   In its first run during the May sweeps in 1986, ``Deliberate
Stranger'' had a rating of 18.6 for part one and 21.7 for part two.
   The rest of last week's top 10 were: ``The Cosby Show'' and its
spinoff ``Different World'' tied for second with a 17.6 rating,
``Night Court'' at 17.2, ``Golden Girls'' 17.1, ``Cheers'' 17.0,
``Hunter'' 15.6, ``L.A. Law'' 15.3, ``Miss Teen USA'' 15.1 and
``Amen'' 14.5.
   Except for ``Miss Teen USA,'' which was live on CBS, all of the
top shows were NBC reruns. ABC's highest-rated show was ``Who's the
Boss?,'' which placed 15th.
   NBC won the week with an average rating of 12.2, followed CBS's
9.5 and ABC's 8.5. For the 45 weeks of the season, NBC's average is
14.9 followed by CBS's 12.5 and ABC's 12.4.
   CBS had the top-ranked evening news broadcast for last week with
an 8.9 rating. NBC and ABC tied at 8.7.

<TEXT>
   Vice President George Bush says he may be ``a
nice WASP,'' but he's closer to ethnic voters than Michael Dukakis
on school prayer, the death penalty and other value-laden issues.
   ``He can speak Spanish, but I can speak our language of ethnic
values and pride, everlasting pride in the United States of
America,'' Bush told 200 supporters Tuesday evening at a rally for
ethnic groups.
   Bush said he respected Dukakis, the son of Greek immigrants, for
his ``pride and his ethnicity.'' But Bush portrayed the Democratic
nominee as out of step with the patriotic and law-and-order values
of most ethnic Americans.
   To any who wonder how ``a nice WASP'' like himself fits in with
ethnic voters, Bush said, ``Well, it's values.''
   The vice president addressed the Bush '88 Coalition of American
Nationalities after returning from Chicago, where he outlined his
foreign policies ideas in a speech before the Mid-America Committee.
   He told that civic group he aims to deploy a space-based defense
shield ``as soon as feasible,'' and promised, ``As president I will
not leave America defenseless against ballistic missiles.''
   Bush also was planning to highlight defense issues today with a
tour of a Westinghouse defense plant in Annapolis, Md.
   But Bush was hoping to put the issue of plant closing
legislation behind him. His chief of staff, Craig Fuller, told
reporters that President Reagan's decision not to veto a
plant-closing notification bill should stifle Democratic attempts
to keep making political hay on that issue.
   Bush said he was more interested in talking about plant openings
and record numbers of Americans in the work force than about plant
closings.
   At the ethnic rally, a banner hung from the National Press Club
balcony bearing the names of the Irish and Italians, Germans and
Japanese, Cossacks and Croats, and nearly a score of other groups.
It said, ``Bush in 1988 ... He Speaks Our Language.''
   Taking a cue from the banner, Bush said, ``We're talking one
language and we're talking values that join all of us together.''
   ``I don't think it's wrong for a kid to say a prayer on a
voluntary basis in school. I think it's right,'' he said.
   ``And I think some crimes are so heinous, so outrageous,
particularly those that cause the death of police officers and are
caused by these drug addicts, that the death penalty is
warranted,'' he said.
   ``It isn't right to let murderers who haven't served enough time
to be eligible for parole out on some furlough so they can rape and
murder again,'' Bush said, referring to the highly publicized
Massachusetts program under Dukakis that has since been amended.
   ``If somebody ever brings me a bill to require teachers to say
the Pledge of Allegiance to our flag, one nation under God, in our
schools, I'll sign it and I'll sign it fast _ and my opponent
vetoed it,'' he said.
   Without mentioning the recent U.S. downing of an Iranian
commercial airliner in the Persian Gulf, Bush said, ``I'll never
apologize for the United States of America, ever, I don't care what
the facts are.''
   In Chicago, Bush also said that while he will pursue arms
controls talks with the Soviet Union, he will approach the table
warily and ``avoid swings between unjustified euphoria and
exaggerated pessimism.''
   ``We should not let our hopes outrun our practical experience,''
said Bush, who added he was impressed by Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's call for openness and reforms. But, he said, the Soviet
Union must be judged ``by what it delivers'' on human rights, arms
cuts and ``reining in aggressive Soviet clients.''
   Bush suggested that development of the administration's
Strategic Defense Initiative, also known as Star Wars, might be
critical to Israel's security.
   And while praising the Reagan administration's support for the
Mujahedeen rebels in Afghanistan and the liberation of Grenada, he
made no mention of the Contra rebels in Nicaragua.

mate, GOP leaders have jumped at the opportunity to spotlight
Bentsen's views on the emotional subject.
   Unlike Bentsen, Dukakis has called Contra aid a ``failed and
illegal policy'' that ``ought to stop.'' Dukakis says Bentsen's
views don't bother him, however.
   President Reagan, who coined the ``I'm a Contra, too'' phrase
and routinely stings Democrats in his weekly radio address, had
nothing but praise for Bentsen's past record on Contra aid last
Saturday. He called Bentsen one of the ``strongest supporters'' of
assistance for the rebels.
   And Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., on Tuesday quoted
from a speech Bentsen delivered on Feb. 4, 1988, in which the Texan
called the Sandinistas ``violent revolutionaries _ men and women
who are dedicated to spreading their brand of communism anywhere
they can reach.''
   ``I can only hope that Michael Dukakis and every other American,
Republican, independent and Democrat, is listening, too,'' said
Dole, author of a $47 million aid proposal for the Nicaraguan
Contras seeking to oust the Sandinista regime. The package, which
includes a $20 million escrow account for military aid, is pending
in the Senate.
   On Tuesday, Bentsen said he would vote for a program that
provides humanitarian aid to the Contras as well as ``fenced
military aid dependent on aggressive actions by the Sandinistas.''
   Both Dukakis and Bentsen say they support a floundering regional
peace plan advanced a year ago by Costa Rican President Oscar Arias.
   The Contras currently are receiving $17 million in assistance
for food, clothing, shelter and medical supplies. That money
expires at the end of September.
   Neither Dukakis nor Bentsen has shied away from talking about
their positions on Contra aid, but some experts say the Democratic
candidates' divergence on the issue could put them in a ticklish
spot.
   Bentsen, for instance, is under pressure from liberal groups to
oppose Contra aid.
   ``A Bentsen `yes' vote on Contra aid will alienate millions of
Democratic voters who care deeply about the Central American issue,
and bring into question Governor Dukakis' sincerity about changing
Central American policy,'' the Council on Hemispheric Affairs said
in a statement. The group does research and releases policy papers.
   ``This is going to be a real window into the Dukakis-Bentsen
relationship ... the first sign of what the nature of their
relationship is,'' said Jay Winik, a congressional fellow at the
Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think
tank.
   How the Democrats handle the issue could provide clues into
whether Bentsen, as vice president, would help shape foreign policy
or remain in the background in a Dukakis administration, said
Winik, a former aide to Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis.
   The so-called ``Reagan Democrats'' _ those whom Dukakis hoped to
bring back into the party fold with his selection of a conservative
Democratic running mate _ will watch Bentsen's actions closely, he
said.
   Aside from trying to take advantage of the Dukakis-Bentsen
split, Republicans are confident the Contra aid issue gives them a
domestic political advantage at a time the Sandinistas' have
resorted to repressive tactics, said Richard Viguerie, a
conservative fund-raiser.
   In recent months, the Sandinistas have arrested opposition
leaders, closed an opposition newspaper and a Roman Catholic Church
radio station and expelled the American ambassador.
   ``There is no mileage for the Democrats on the Contras,''
Viguerie said. ``Democrats have lost more elections on the
soft-on-communism thing than anything else.''
   John Burnstein, an associate at the Washington Office On Latin
America, a liberal group that is against aid, agrees the Democrats
would be best served by keeping the ``issue off the front burner _
which is not going to be easy.''
   If the United States agrees to send military aid, ``you are just
going to keep the thing on the front page,'' he said.
   Democrats are aware that the issue is politically explosive. In
an effort to diffuse the charged atmosphere, a group of a dozen or
so Senate Democrats, led by Majority Leader Robert Byrd, D-W.Va.,
are working to devise an aid package that could attract bipartisan
support.

   President Reagan, giving up a fight that had
become an political ``tar baby'' for Republicans, is allowing to
become law federally mandated advance notices for workers who lose
their jobs to plant closings or large layoffs.
   Reagan, who earlier this year had vigorously opposed such a
measure, said Tuesday he would neither sign nor veto the required
60-day notices that both the House and Senate passed last month
with veto-proof two-thirds majorities.
   Instead, Reagan said he will allow to become law on Thursday,
without his signature, what he called bad legislation from a
Congress ``more interested in scoring points with organized labor
than in saving workers' jobs.''
   Reagan had vetoed a massive overhauling of the nation's trade
laws in May almost solely because it included the layoff notices,
calling them ``anti-competitive.''
   In a statement Tuesday, he said his view of them has not changed
but conceded that Democrats and unions had succeeded in raising so
much public sentiment in favor of the legislation that the chances
of Republicans in Congress sustaining a veto were virtually nil.
   ``In order to end these political shenanigans and to get on with
the business of the nation, I have decided to allow the
plant-closing bill to become law _ but without my signature,'' he
said.
   A Bureau of Labor Statistics study last year indicated that 64
percent of the 1.5 million to 2 million workers who become victims
of a large layoffs or plants closings receive no notice.
   Sponsors of the law estimated that had the law been enacted two
years ago, notices would have gone to some 1.6 million laid-off
workers who otherwise did not get them.
   Republican lawmakers who had led the administration's fight
against the notices in Congress breathed a sigh of relief at
Reagan's decision, as did aides to Vice President George Bush, who
is running for president.
   ``The battle is over and we ought to move on to the next
issue,'' said House Republican Whip Trent Lott of Mississippi, who
is in a race this fall to succeed retiring Sen. John Stennis,
D-Miss.
   Sen. John Danforth, R-Mo., said the administration's adamant
opposition to the notices and refusal to accept a weakened version
of the measure when it was offered as a compromise last spring
``was a political mistake.''
   ``This issue has been a tar baby as far as Republicans are
concerned,'' Danforth said. ``Most people in the country did not
agree with the president's position.''
   Bush has never waivered in opposing the mandatory notices
despite repeated assertions by Democratic presidential nominee
Michael Dukakis that opposition to them reflects an insensitivity
to workers and polls showing that more than 80 percent of the
public favor the warnings.
   Bush's chief of staff, Craig Fuller, said Reagan's decision
``will make it more difficult for the political game to be played
over the plant-closing issue'' in the November election.
   However, Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, Dukakis' running mate and the
architect of the second showdown with Reagan on the issue, said
Democrats have no intention of letting Bush off the hook.
   ``Plant closing is going to remain a very strong issue and it
shows the difference, that we are for fairness in this,'' Bentsen
said.
   The bill becomes law at 12:01 a.m. EDT Thursday, but it will not
be enforced until Feb. 4, 1989.
   Under the bill, notices are required of any employer with at
least 100 full-time workers if a plant closing will result in loss
of jobs for 50 or more of employees.
   In case of layoffs, notices are required only if one-third of a
company's employees or 500 of them _ whichever figure is lower _
are involved.
   Exemptions are provided if employers can show that plant
closings or mass layoffs are caused by ``not reasonably foreseeable
circumstances'' such as flood or sudden cancellation of a major
contract, or if the notices would prevent raising enough capital to
keep the business open.
   A veto became untenable when Republicans deserted Reagan,
apparently due to the public popularity of the plant-closing
notices.
   Fifty-four of the 177 Republicans in the House and 19 of the 46
GOP senators supported the bill last month, enough to muster the
two-thirds majorities in each chamber to override a veto.
   The bill's enactment is organized labor's biggest legislative
victory since 1978, when Congress last voted to raise the minimum
wage.
   ``Workers, their families and their communities will now have a
better chance to plan for the future,'' said AFL-CIO President Lane
Kirkland.
   The National Association of Manufacturers and the U.S. Chamber
of Commerce had engaged in aggressive grassroots lobbying over the
past two weeks to pressure Reagan to veto the bill. Both had
expected him to veto it.
   ``This has really sent a shock wave through the business
community,'' said Renee Reymond, the NAM's chief lobbyist on the
issue.

   Here, at a glance, are major provisions of the
bill providing for 60 days' advance notice of plant closings and
mass layoffs. Congress passed the measure last month and President
Reagan announced Tuesday he will allow it to become law without his
signature.
   The prospective law:
   _Will take effect Thursday although companies will not have to
start providing the notices until Feb. 4, 1989, six months after
enactment. Written notices have to be provided to affected workers
individually and local government officials. Meantime, the Labor
Department is instructed to issue regulations for enforcing the
statute.
   _Affects only companies with 100 or more full-time workers at
any single site of employment.
   _In instances of plant closings, which include shutdowns of any
single product line or operation within a plant, requires 60 days'
advance notice if 50 or more workers lose their jobs.
   _In cases of layoffs, requires notice only if one-third of a
plant's work force or at least 500 people, whichever is less, are
being laid off. For example, a company with 750 employees at a
particular location laying off 200 of them would not have to
provide the notices. But if it laid off more than 250, it would. So
would a plant with 2,500 employees that lays off 550 of them, even
though the reduction does not total one-third of its work force.
   _Exempts companies from providing the full 60 days' notice if
the plant closing or layoff was caused by ``not reasonably
foreseeable circumstances'' such as sudden cancellation of a
government contract, floods or droughts.
   _Exempts companies from providing advance notice if the notices
would have precluded them from obtaining capital or new business
that would have enabled them to avoid or postpone the plant closing
or layoffs.
   _There is a ``presumptive requirement'' to provide notices if
companies are involved in bankruptcy court reorganizations or
situations where creditors are trying to seize their assets. Only
by showing the unforeseen circumstances would they be exempted.
   _Authorizes the Labor Department to require violators to award
up to 60 days' back pay and benefits to any worker not given proper
notice.
   _Authorizes federal judges to levy fines of up to $500 per day
for each of the 60 days that advance notice was not provided, or up
to $30,000, which is to be paid affected communities.
   The bill's sponsors said it would have covered about 800,000
workers in each of the past two years who were laid off without
warning.

   Here are major provisions of the fair housing
bill that passed the Senate on Tuesday.
   _Protection against housing discrimination would cover the
disabled and handicapped and families with children under age 18.
Current law already protects against discrimination because of race
or sex.
   _The secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban
Development would try to win a conciliation agreement after a
complaint is filed. If that effort fails, the secretary or any
party could take the case to an independent administrative law
judge in HUD or to U.S. District Court.
   _If the administrative judge finds that someone has engaged or
is about to engage in a discriminatory practice, he shall order
appropriate relief, which may include actual damages, an injunction
or civil penalties.
   _The maximum fines would be $10,000 for a first violation,
$25,000 for a second violation within a five-year period and
$50,000 for two or more violations within a seven-year period.
   _The administrative judge's ruling would be subject to review by
a federal appellate court.
   _A U.S. district judge could impose the added penalty of
punitive damages.
   _New buildings with four or more units must be constructed so
they are readily accessible to the handicapped. Doors must be wide
enough to accommodate wheelchairs; switches and outlets must be in
accessible locations; bathroom walls must be reinforced to allow
later installation of grab bars. This would apply to dwellings set
for occupancy 30 months after the law's enactment.
   _Disabled tenants would have the right to make reasonable
modifications to a premises at their own expense. The tenants would
have to agree to return the dwelling to its original condition when
they leave.
   _Children could be barred from housing intended for the elderly.
Such housing is defined as a community where at least 80 percent of
the dwellings are occupied by at least one person age 55 or older,
and significant facilities and services are provided; or those
occupied solely by people age 62 and older.

   Here is the text of what the White House press
office called President Reagan's ``action plan'' to combat the AIDS
epidemic. The plan was issued Tuesday in response to
recommendations of the White House AIDS commission, which submitted
its final report June 24.
   ``Under the action plan, the president:
   ``1. Directs the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)
to develop a series of consensus conferences with representatives
from all levels of government and the private sector to intensify
public health measures to reduce the spread of HIV infection. The
president instructs HHS to increase the number of community based
education programs directed to those at increased risk of HIV
infection.
   ``2. Requires the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to improve
laboratory quality and blood screening tests immediately and within
45 days begin notification of transfusion recipients. In addition,
FDA should encourage self-donated blood before surgery.
   ``3. Emphasizes his concern about drug abuse and its relation to
HIV infection and continus his call for bipartisan efforts to enact
his anti-drug proposals.
   ``4. Begins action in and out of government that will accelerate
development, approval and distribution of vaccines and drugs.
   ``5. Reaffirms his commitment to provide adequate resources
(dollars, staff, office and laboratory space) to combat the HIV
epidemic and directs the Office of Management and Budget to make
certain there are no impediments to efficient use of these
resources.
   ``6. Asks Congress to accelerate enactment of his FY 1989 HIV
appropriations request and adopt the FY 1990 budget request for HIV
activities as early as possible after the budget is submitted. The
president will seek a special HIV emergency fund for unanticipated
problems and opportunities in the FY 1990 budget request.
   ``7. Instructs the secretary of HHS to evaluate the current
system of health care financing; and directs HHS to conduct
specific studies of ways to promote out-of-hospital care; encourage
states to establish insurance risk pools for medically uninsurable
persons; and increase the public health response to HIV infected
infants, children, adolescents and low-income disabled individuals.
   ``8. Directs the secretary of state to develop a multi-focused
international initiative to combat HIV, particularly in
less-developed countries; increase U.S. commitment to international
technical assistance; and seek development of a three-year plan for
international efforts against HIV infection.
   ``9. Requires the Public Health Service to update the 1986
Public health Service plan for combatting HIV infection. The
president has asked Dr. Macdonald to provide him with status
reports in September and December on progress to implement the
commission's recommendations.
   ``10. Calls on all sectors of society to respond equitably and
compassionately to those with HIV infection and to their families.
In addition to directing all federal agencies to adopt a policy
based on OPM guidelines, the president requests that American
businesses, unions and schools examine and consider adopting
education and personnel policies based on the OPM and Centers for
Disease Control guidelines.
   ``In addition, the president referred to the attorney general
for expeditious review and response the commission's
recommendations as to how the federal government should provide
direction and leadership to encourage non-discrimination for HIV
infected persons.''

   A state grand jury Tuesday indicted Noah
Robinson, the half-brother of Jesse Jackson, on charges of
conspiracy, obstruction of justice and intimidation of a witness in
a plot to kill a murder witness.
   The indictments were returned in Greenville Tuesday, nearly two
months after Robinson and a former employee, Jake H. Oliver, were
arrested. Oliver also was indicted.
   Robinson said in a statement released Tuesday that the
government has been ordered to return part of $21,000 in cash
seized in June from his Chicago apartment and offices.
   The self-described millionaire described the seizure as being
part of a massive ``dirty tricks'' campaign against him by the
government. He said, ``These people will never break my spirit, or
my resolve to oppose and expose their dirty tricks.''
   Although Robinson and Jackson share relatives in Greenville, the
former Democratic presidential hopeful has said he has had no
recent contact with his half-brother.
   A trial date has not been set.
   Robinson and Oliver were charged in June in a plot to kill
Janice Rosemond.
   Ms. Rosemond testified last fall before a Chicago grand jury,
which was inquiring into the activities of Chicago's El Rukn street
gang. Ms. Rosemond reportedly told the grand jury that she saw the
fatal shooting of Leroy ``Hambone'' Barber.
   Within weeks of her testimony, Ms. Rosemond was attacked in her
Greenville apartment. She survived five stab wounds.
   Shortly after the stabbing, police issued an arrest warrant
charging Freddie Elwood Sweeney, who once worked as a janitor in
one of Robinson's companies, with assault and battery with intent
to kill.
   Robinson maintains he had nothing to do with Barber's death or
Ms. Rosemond's stabbing and said he is the victim of a massive
government-sponsored conspiracy.
   Robinson said the seizure of $21,000 from his apartments and
offices ``was a classic case of abuse of governmental power.''
   Following Robinson's arrest in Greenville, authorities searched
Robinson's apartment and offices and confiscated the cash and
various corporate records. The Internal Revenue Service
subsequently filed a $31,000 lien against the cash and $12,000 in
one of Robinson's bank accounts.
   A judge ordered last Wednesday that the seized cash and money
from the bank account satisfied the IRS's claim and that the
remaining $2,000 should be returned.
   In the order, the judge said, ``The government does not contest
Robinson's assertions that the money is free of criminal taint.''
Robinson said the government ``made up a debt in a futile attempt
to justify keeping my money.''

   A $421 million emergency spending bill is
awaiting approval by the Senate, but the measure seems to be
turning into a pawn in the election-year struggle over aid to the
Nicaraguan Contra rebels.
   The Senate Appropriations Committee sent the supplemental
spending bill for fiscal 1988 to the full Senate on Tuesday by a
voice vote without objections.
   The Senate was expected to vote on the measure as early as
today. However, maneuvering between Democrats and Republicans over
Contra aid made the timetable unclear.
   Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., has proposed a $47
million Contra aid package and has said he wants to attach it to
the supplemental spending measure.
   Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., said he would not
bring up the supplemental package if Dole will introduce a Contra
aid amendment. Democrats are trying to write a milder formula for
Contra aid, which they want to insert into a Pentagon
appropriations bill.
   The supplemental, which would cover spending in the fiscal year
that ends Sept. 30, would provide $421 million in new spending and
allow more than $100 million to be transferred among the budgets of
various agencies.
   Supplemental spending for this year is supposed to be approved
only for ``dire emergencies,'' according to the budget summit
agreement of last fall between President Reagan and congressional
leaders.
   Several senators said that to honor that pact, they would
withhold requests for additional spending. This rare behavior
inspired Sen. J. Bennett Johnston, D-La., a senior member of the
committee, to call the measure ``lean, mean and urgent.''
   The largest slice of the legislation is $297 million for the
Veterans Administration, which needs more money because some of the
benefits it pays are being adjusted for inflation and because the
agency's caseload has been larger than expected.
   The bill includes $60 million for the Coast Guard, which says it
needs the money to keep its ships and planes on patrol; $55.4
million for the Justice Department to cover expenses incurred
during last year's riots by Mariel Cuban detainees at federal
prisons; and $55 million for the Agriculture Department, which has
seen its spending go up as a result of the drought.
   The measure would provide $22.6 million for FBI agents to
observe Soviet inspectors monitoring American compliance with the
nuclear weapons treaty the two nations have signed.
   The legislation also would transfer an estimated $49 million to
trade programs for workers who lose their jobs because of imports,
and about $43 million to the program that dispenses benefits to
victims of black lung disease.
   On an 8-7 vote, committee members voted to strip a provision
that would have freed $44 million the government has withheld from
the United Nations. The United States has been holding back
portions of its annual contributions to the international agency,
arguing that the United Nations needs to make management reforms.
   The House approved a $189.1 million version of the bill July 27.
It contains none of the veterans' assistance. House leaders have
said they will try to pass a second bill containing less urgent
spending.

   A 79-year-old man convicted of
murdering his ailing wife in what he called a mercy killing asked
for a new trial Tuesday, saying his lawyer was compromised by
emotions surrounding the case and negotiations for a movie deal.
   Roswell Gilbert, represented by a new attorney, made a rare
appearance in court during a hearing before Broward Circuit Judge
Thomas Coker.
   Reporters asked what Gilbert wanted to accomplish during the
two-day hearing.
   ``Something that will help me terminate this nightmare, I
guess,'' he replied.
   Gilbert was convicted of first-degree murder in the March 1985
shooting death of Emily Gilbert, his wife of 51 years, at their
seaside condominium. The retired electronics engineer said he shot
her twice in the head to end the misery she suffered from
osteoporosis and Alzheimer's disease.
   He was sentenced to life in prison.
   The case was recounted in last year's television movie, ``Mercy
or Murder,'' which featured Robert Young as Gilbert.
   Gilbert's new attorney, Bradley Stark, said the original trial
lawyer, Joseph Varon, had trouble separating the legal case from
the movie, a portion of which was filmed in Varon's office.
   ``Instead of being completely devoted to Mr. Gilbert, Mr. Varon
got swept away by the emotions of the event,'' Stark said.
   Stark said Varon wanted to use Gilbert's trial to make the
country aware of the lack of laws concerning euthanasia.
   Stark told the court Gilbert's contention that he shot his wife
to put her out of her misery was not effectively made in the first
trial.
   One of the witnesses called was Harry Gulkin, a partner in
Varon's law firm, who said Gilbert was ``in a state of shock,
disbelief, bewilderment and also very depressed about the whole
thing,'' contradicting the prosecution's argument that it was
premeditated.
   ``(Varon) didn't think any juror in this county, or this country
for that matter, would return a verdict of first-degree murder,''
Gulkin said.
   Also testifying was Steven Gethers, who produced the movie.
   The movie would not have been made if Gilbert had not been
convicted of first-degree murder, the producer said.
   ``For me, the drama was in the sentence that was given,'' he
said.
   Stark presented evidence unheard at the first trial, which he
claims was rushed to make Varon's rights to Gilbert's story more
profitable.
   Two neighbors, Mrs. Gilbert's hairdresser, Aghdas Sedghi, and a
waitress who served the couple regularly, all testified that Mrs.
Gilbert's health deteriorated rapidly shortly before the shooting.
   ``She was suffering constantly from pains in her back,'' said
neighbor Pauline McGinness. ``She said if she became old or
decrepit or put in a wheelchair, she hoped someone would put her
out.''
   Assistant State Attorney Kelly Hancock, who prosecuted Gilbert
and expects to testify at the hearing, rejects the argument Varon
mishandled the case.
   Hancock will argue that regardless of the defense, Gilbert
killed his wife and understood the consequences.
   Gilbert is serving his sentence at Lawtey Correctional
Institution and has no chance of parole for 25 years.
   Gilbert signed a pretrial agreement with Varon giving the lawyer
the rights to his story. MGM-UA Productions paid Varon $50,000 for
the rights.
   Gilbert donated his share, $5,000, in his wife's name to a
non-profit institution for Alzheimer's research.

   A tiny public restroom facility
overtaken by drug addicts and street people sold for $504,000 to a
restaurateur who plans to build a three-story Italian eatery on the
site.
   Real estate auctioneer Keith Jones said the art-deco style
restroom attracted 43 bids before Gino Bigazzi made the winning bid
Tuesday. Bigazzi, who has another restaurant in Sydney, plans to
tear down the restroom.
   The price stunned the City Council, which had been willing to
accept a bid about one-third of the selling price.
   The property, measuring 1,300 square feet, is in Sydney's
red-light suburb of King's Cross.
   The auctioneer promised bidders the property would be sold
without the squatters who lived in the building.
   The astronomical price reflects a real estate boom in Sydney,
where many property prices have doubled during the past year.

<HEAD>NHTSA Issues Tough New Odometer Fraud Rules</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM BOVEE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal regulators hope tough new rules will
help curtail the con artists who roll back odometers, costing
consumers more than $3 billion a year.
   The regulations, issued Tuesday by the National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration, will impose stricter paperwork standards on
states and auto dealers across the nation. The rules take effect
next April.
   NHTSA estimated the requirements will cost $6.5 million
annually, although removal of other record-keeping requirements
will reduce the net cost.
   Douglas Greenhaus, an attorney for the National Automobile
Dealers Association, said NHTSA's rules would be good for the auto
retailing industry.
   ``It should result in a net benefit to dealers, who are
oftentimes victims of odometer fraud, to the extent that they are
purchasers of vehicles that have been spun back,'' Greenhaus said.
``This rule will increase enforcement and help solve the odometer
fraud problem. It will benefit dealers in the long run.''
   NHTSA's regulations, required by the Truth in Mileage Act passed
by Congress in 1986, will require all motor-vehicle titles issued
after April 29, 1989, be printed so that counterfeiting and
alteration can be detected easily. Titles also must include mileage
readings and a place for buyers to disclose the mileage when a car
is sold.
   ``The intent of the law has always been to protect consumers by
providing an official paper trail of odometer readings that may be
checked by car owners and law enforcement officials to determine
whether the odometer has been turned back,'' said Diane Steed,
NHTSA administrator. ``This rule will make that law easier.''
   The regulations also would require that:
   _Sellers disclose odometer readings when transferring title,
either on the title or on a separate form.
   _Dealers, distributors, leasing companies and automotive
auctions maintain records of cars sold for at least five years
after the transaction.
   _People leasing cars tell the leasing company the vehicle's
mileage at the end of the leasing period.
   Steed said NHTSA was ``adopting a flexible position on
implementing this rule,'' allowing states to request an extension
of the compliance deadline beyond April.
   The rules would cost the states $3.9 million a year, NHTSA said.
The estimated cost to auto dealers and leasing companies would be
$2.6 million, but it would be offset by a provision eliminating
most separate odometer statements, NHTSA said.

<HEAD>Judge Overturns Regulation Limiting Reimbursement for Home Health
Care</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A court decision ordering the Reagan
administration to relax eligibility standards for elderly people to
get health care at home could help thousands of Medicare
recipients, according to a lawyer in the case.
   U.S. District Judge Stanley Sporkin's decision overturning a
Medicare regulation may encourage thousands of recipients to apply
for benefits they thought they never had, said William Dombi, legal
director of the National Association for Home Care, which brought
the lawsuit.
   Sporkin overturned a 1986 regulation defining ``part-time or
intermittent'' care as limiting eligibility to patients who
received four or fewer home visits a week.
   Sporkin said the four-day limit ``produces absurd results.''
   ``A beneficiary needing a total of five hours of care per week
is denied coverage if the care is needed over the course of five or
more days, while the person needing as many as 27 hours of care
spread over only four days may qualify for coverage,'' the judge
said in a 69-page opinion released Tuesday.
   ``Home health care beneficiaries must survive seven days a week
_ their medical needs do not take weekends off,'' he said.
   Dombi said the decision probably affects several thousand
Medicare beneficiaries who were denied reimbursement for visits by
nurses or health aides.
   ``People who sought nursing-home care as the alternative may now
have a chance to come into the home setting,'' he said.
   It also will encourage people who are receiving less care than
they need to get Medicare reimbursement for more frequent visits.
``We presented evidence that indicated people were receiving less
care than they needed solely to qualify for some benefit payment,''
Dombi said.
   ``People who have deprived themselves of care may come back into
the system,'' Dombi said.
   Sporkin ordered the Department of Health and Human Services to
reopen claims that had been denied since the lawsuit was filed Feb.
17, 1987, by the home care organization on behalf of 17 Medicare
recipients. The lawsuit was joined by 14 members of Congress.
   Sporkin found that HHS had improperly interpreted the term
``part-time or intermittent'' to mean that care must be both
part-time and intermittent. The plaintiffs argued that when
Congress enacted the Medicare program in 1965, it intended that
such home visits could be one or the other.
   The definition amounted to a four-day limit on visits that a
Medicare patient could receive each week from care providers, the
judge found.
   Robert Hardy, a spokesman for the Health Care Financing
Administration, an HHS unit that operates Medicare, said: ``We
haven't read the opinion but we believe that HCFA is properly
administering the home health benefit.''
   Dombi predicted the government would appeal Sporkin's decision,
but Hardy declined to comment on what legal steps the agency would
take.
   Legislation recently signed by President Reagan providing
catastrophic care coverage for Medicare recipients contains
language that lifts the four-day restriction.
   Sporkin also determined that the agency's policy forced elderly
people to go to administrative law judges to get the benefits to
which they are legally entitled. Most of the administrative law
judges side with the patients when they rule on the claims, Sporkin
said.
   But ``those that have insufficient energy or resources to appeal
simply fall by the wayside,'' Sporkin said.
   The judge said there were no statistics to indicate how many of
the 100,000 people denied home-care benefits last year were refused
payment because of the four-day limit.
   But the judge estimated ``the number of such people certainly is
in the hundreds and may be in the thousands.''
   Home care was offered by Congress, Sporkin said, as a more
economical and humane alternative to hospitals or nursing homes.
   Harold Galbraith, a paraplegic who suffers severe skin ulcers
and needs a catheter, was refused reimbursement for five hourly
visits each week by a health aide, the judge noted.
   ``With the help of the aide, Mr. Galbraith has managed to use a
wheelchair and has achieved some independence at his home and has
avoided going to an institution, Sporkin said.
   Sporkin has yet to rule on the plaintiffs' challenge to the
agency's definition of ``reasonable and necessary care.''

   The newest tourist maps of the nation's
capital are written in braille with federal monuments and landmarks
visible to the hand as well as the eye.
   These braille and tactile maps will be available free to blind
and visually impaired visitors to Washington through congressional
offices.
   They were produced by the University of Maryland under a
$150,000 contract from the U.S. Education Department's Office of
Special Education and Rehabilitative Services.
   Madeleine Will, an assistant secretary of education, called the
maps ``the first of their kind.''
   ``They set a standard for other cities and help to make
Washington, D.C., the most accessible capital in the world,'' she
said.
   The colorful maps feature captions in both English and braille,
with such landmarks as the Lincoln Memorial, the White House, the
U.S. Capitol and the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier depicted by bumps
shaped like their contours.
   The set of six maps includes a guide to Metro, the rapid transit
system; the floor plan of the Capitol, Capitol Hill and the Mall
area, and the stretch from the White House to Arlington Cemetery.

<HEAD>Senate Approves Fair-Housing Bill; House Likely to Accept Senate
Version</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   House sponsors say they'll likely accept
Senate provisions of a fair housing bill and send the most
far-reaching civil rights measure in two decades to President
Reagan.
   The Senate voted 94-3 Tuesday to expand protection of the
nation's fair housing law to the disabled and families with
children, and empower the government to seek stiff fines for
property owners found guilty of bias.
   Final congressional action is no longer in doubt, since the
House passed a similar bill 376-23 last June. The only remaining
question is whether the House will take the quickest route to final
passage _ by accepting Senate changes _ or try for compromise
language.
   President Reagan has endorsed the Senate bill.
   Chief House sponsor Don Edwards, D-Calif., when asked if the
Senate bill was acceptable, said: ``I think so, but I haven't seen
it yet. From what we hear of it, the answer is yes. We expect to
accept the bill without going to conference.''
   Republican co-sponsor Rep. Hamilton Fish, of New York, said
through a spokesman that he probably would go along with the Senate
version, but needs to look it over first.
   The nation's current housing law was passed in 1968 in the wake
of Martin Luther King Jr.'s assassination, but the federal
government was given no real enforcement powers.
   The proposed legislation would enable the secretary of housing
and urban development to go to court to fight for victims of
housing bias.
   But just as significant are the expanded protections in the bill
beyond the current bar to racial and sexual discrimination.
   By adding protection for families with children under 18, the
legislation would prevent ``adults only'' restrictions. Exemptions
are included for communities for the elderly.
   The measure would not only bar discrimination against the
disabled or handicapped, but also require that new multi-unit
residences be constructed so they would be accessible to such
people. This provision would take effect 30 months after enactment,
and apply to housing with four or more units.
   Three of the Senate's most conservative Republicans voted
against the Senate bill Tuesday: Jesse Helms of North Carolina,
Steve Symms of Idaho and Gordon Humphrey of New Hampshire.
   Sens. Joseph Biden, D-Del.; Dale Bumpers, D-Ark., and Harry
Reid, D-Nev., did not vote.
   The Senate language was the product of behind-the-scenes
negotiations that eventually yielded agreement among civil rights
groups, real estate agents, homebuilders, organized labor and the
Reagan administration.
   Staff members of Vice President George Bush, the certain GOP
presidential nominee, were instrumental in working out the Senate
language. Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis has
endorsed the bill.
   Housing and Urban Development Secretary Samuel Pierce, who
helped put the measure together, called it ``a meaningful expansion
of our nation's fair housing laws.''
   Ralph Neas, executive director of the Leadership Conference on
Civil Rights, called the bipartisan bill ``the most dramatic and
significant improvement in civil rights law since 1965.''
   The bill would permit the Department of Housing and Urban
Development to go to court after voluntary efforts failed to
resolve discrimination complaints. Cases could be prosecuted before
HUD's administrative law judges or in federal court at the request
of any party.
   The administrative judge could award actual damages, issue
injunctions prohibiting further discrimination, grant attorneys'
fees and award civil penalties. The maximum fines would be $10,000
for a first violation, $25,000 for a second violation within a
five-year period and $50,000 for two or more violations within a
seven-year period.
   The administrative judge's ruling would be subject to review by
a federal appellate court.
   If the federal court route was chosen, the judge could add
punitive damages to the penalties.
   The bill would continue the current right of victims to file
private civil suits, but would extend the filing deadline from the
current 180 days to two years after the discriminatory incident. A
$1,000 limit on punitive damages in the private suits would be
eliminated.
   Disabled tenants would have the right to make reasonable
modifications to the premises at their own expense. The tenants
would have to agree to return the dwelling to its original
condition when they leave.

<HEAD>Steel Firms Seek Commitments On Import Quotas</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BARKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The steel industry turned a profit last year,
but its problems will surface again if the next president does not
renew import quotas that expire in 1989, steel company executives
said.
   A handful of executives told the Congressional Steel Caucus on
Tuesday that they were encouraged by public and private statements
by the two presidential contenders that the next administration
will extend the quotas, which cover 30 nations.
   The steel industry was profitable last year for the first time
since 1981.
   But allowing the so-called ``voluntary restraint agreements''
with Japan, South Korea and other nations to lapse in 1989 could
have dire consequences, said Thomas C. Graham, president of the
steel division of USX Corp., the nation's largest steel producer.
   ``Our balance sheets are still very fragile, and most analysts
see a market downturn in the relatively near future,'' Graham said.
He said the worldwide excess capacity and foreign governments'
steelmaking subsidies and unfair trading practices that prompted
the establishment of the quotas ``have not disappeared.''
   Graham and David Hoag, president and chief executive officer of
LTV Steel Co., the No. 2 steelmaker, said the presidential campaign
had yielded encouraging signals about steel trade from Democratic
contender Michael Dukakis and Republican rival George Bush.
   ``The domestic steel industry is very grateful that
(Massachusetts) Gov. Dukakis has stated his support for continuing
the voluntary restraint agreements, and we're hopeful that Vice
President Bush will also come out for extension before too long,''
Graham said.
   In an interview, Hoag said that Bush ``has said he is favorably
inclined (to extending the agreements), but he hasn't said it
publicly.'' Calls to the Bush campaign were referred to vice
presidential press assistant Kristin Taylor, who said she would
have to consult other aides before providing an answer.
   Hoag said the push to continue the trade agreements was ``an
industry position.'' Also briefing caucus members Tuesday were
Walter F. Williams, chairman of Bethlehem Steel Corp., the
third-leading steelmaker; and Joseph Toot Jr., president of the
Timken Co.
   Hoag said last year's industry-wide net income of $1 billion was
``good news.'' But he added that there has been ``little change in
the global structural conditions that contributed to the worst
period ever in the industry's history _ $12 billion in losses
during 1982-1986.''
   Congressional pressure and a finding by the U.S. International
Trade Commission that the steel industry was being harmed by
imports led the Reagan administration to negotiate five-year
agreements with leading steel-exporting nations in 1984. The
agreements placed product-by-product caps on the amount of steel
that can be imported into the United States each year.
   The American Institute for Imported Steel, an association of 70
steel importers, has lobbied against the quotas, saying ``free
enterprise must prevail.''
   U.S. firms that rely on imported steel claim that the Reagan
program has stifled competition, raised prices and caused harmful
shortages of certain types of steel.
   Since the quotas took effect in 1984, the foreign share of the
American steel market has dropped from nearly 30 percent to roughly
21 percent. Steel firms say the reduction has given them enough
breathing space and market stability to enable them to modernize.

<HEAD>House, Senate Negotiators Seek Drought Relief Compromise</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   House Agriculture Committee Chairman E.
``Kika'' de la Garza says he thinks President Reagan probably would
accept a temporary 50-cent increase in the price-support level for
milk if it arrived on his desk as part of drought relief
legislation.
   ``I feel confident that this won't violate the guidelines that
we received from the White House,'' de la Garza, D-Texas, said
Tuesday as House and Senate negotiators prepared to meet to resolve
differences over the drought bill.
   The House last week approved as part of its drought bill a
compromise that would raise the price-support level for milk by 50
cents, but only from April through June next year, after which the
benefit would expire.
   The compromise offered by Reps. Steve Gunderson, R-Wis., and Tim
Penny, D-Minn., replaced a proposed permanent increase of 50 cents
in the price-support level starting in October. Agriculture
Secretary Richard Lyng lobbied against such a measure, saying it
would cost $300 million.
   Lawmakers said the price tag would be less than half that. They
placed the cost of the Gunderson-Penny version at $100 million.
   Both the House and Senate versions of the bill would cancel a
50-cent cut in the support level. But the senate has no provision
for an increase and that represents one of the major differences
the conference committee must resolve.
   At the heart of both bills are disaster payments to farmers
equal to 65 percent of earnings lost as a result of crop losses in
excess of 35 percent of the expected harvest.
   De la Garza was noncommittal about a key Senate provision not
contained in the House version of the drought bill. It would allow
ethanol makers to buy corn and other government-owned commodities
for 110 percent of the acquisition prices _ well below current cash
crop prices that have skyrocketed as a result of the drought.
   Ethanol makers could buy up to 2 million bushels a month but a
total of no more than 16 million bushels a month would be available
and the program would end in September 1989.
   The measure is being presented as a frank effort to help small,
hard-pressed ethanol makers with a price break. But it also could
mean a substantial break for the Archer Daniels Midland Co. of
Decatur, Ill., a major company that manufactures the lion's share
of domestic ethanol.
   ``I could live with it as long as they spread around some of the
joy and didn't just save everything for the big boys, if they let
some of the little guys have some too,'' de la Garza said.
   Ethanol is ethyl alcohol, made from farm goods such as corn, and
mixed with gasoline to form the fuel gasohol.
   Ethanol also has been causing a snag in efforts to win fast
Senate approval of legislation to curb record U.S. trade deficits.
Farm-state senators have been trying to knock out a House-passed
provision that would increase duty-free imports of Caribbean
ethanol.
   U.S. corn growers are anxious to hold down imports and say the
Caribbean products often are nothing more than European
agricultural products, such as Spanish wine, that have been run
through island ethanol refineries.
   Meanwhile, de la Garza and a contingent of farm Democrats are
scheduled to fly to Boston on Wednesday night for a talk with
presidential nominee Michael Dukakis at his Brookline, Mass., home.
   ``I don't think he wants to talk about the drought so much as
the future of farming,'' de la Garza said.

   Despite trade tensions between the two
countries, Japan remains the top consumer of U.S. agricultural
exports and the Agriculture Department is offering tips on how to
do business in that market.
   ``Carefully choose a partner or partners to work with in
Japan,'' Suzanne Hale, U.S. agricultural trade officer in Tokyo,
advised in an interview in the department-produced magazine Foreign
Agriculture.
   ``Visit and study the market,'' she said. ``Keep in touch with
customers, try to understand their needs and be flexible in meeting
those needs. Above all, be flexible. Japan is a big market.''
   The Japanese imported $20 billion worth of agricultural
commodities in 1987, $6.7 billion of that amount, or about 20
percent, from the United States. Chief competitors are Australia,
Canada and Argentina for grains, France and Germany for wines, the
entire European Community for processed foods, Thailand for chicken
and Denmark and Taiwan for pork.
   Hale said young Japanese are ``becoming much more
adventuresome'' in eating habits with Italian and Mexican
restaurants burgeoning in Tokyo.
   ``There are a lot of opportunities in the market for traditional
Western-style foods as well,'' she said.
   She said health-consciousness is sharpening among Japanese food
buyers and, because more women are working than ever before, there
is greater interest in convenience foods that can be readily
prepared.
   She cited Japanese import quotas and food additive regulations
as among some of the toughest problems that U.S. exporters face.
   ``Another difficulty for U.S. companies is that Japanese
consumers are used to high-quality packaging,'' she said. ``A few
U.S. companies have developed special packaging for Japan, but much
more could be done.''

<HEAD>Metzenbaum Vows to Push Handgun Waiting Period as Part of Drug
Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES HANNAH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Howard Metzenbaum is moving to block
handgun shopping sprees by violent drug dealers by attaching his
waiting-period proposal to a sweeping drug bill.
   However, the move announced Tuesday by the Ohio Democrat
triggered a skirmish at a congressional hearing with the National
Rifle Association, which says the proposal won't work.
   Metzenbaum, who chaired the hearing of the Senate Judiciary
Constitution subcommittee, said drug traffickers are illegally
purchasing sophisticated, high-powered guns from legitimate dealers
because there is no federal law to allow police to check whether a
purchaser is a convicted felon or illegal alien.
   ``I do not advocate, nor do I support legislation to confiscate
or ban handguns from law-abiding citizens,'' said Metzenbaum. ``But
it is absurd for the federal government to stand idly by while
violent and dangerous drug pushers arm themselves in federally
licensed and regulated gun stores.''
   Metzenbaum's bill would require a seven-day waiting period prior
to the purchase of a handgun to allow police time to conduct
background checks on would-be buyers. The senator said he would try
to attach it to the drug bill as an amendment when it comes before
the full Senate.
   But James Jay Baker, chief lobbyist for the NRA, said his group
opposed the bill.
   ``We don't think it's going to work,'' said Baker. ``The people
you are trying to impact are the same ones that are going to have
false IDs, the same ones who get their guns on the black market,
not through gun stores.''
   Metzenbaum told Baker that if the facts were presented honestly
to members of the NRA, he thinks most of them would support the
waiting period.
   ``Unfortunately, you and the Washington lobbyists of the NRA
have not presented the case honestly to your members,'' he said.
   ``I disagree with that, obviously,'' Baker replied.
   Metzenbaum accused Baker of mailing NRA members a four-page
letter full of ``gross distortions'' and ``false statements.'' The
senator said he has never called for banning the right of any
law-abiding individual to own guns.
   Baker said the first version of a Metzenbaum bill directed at
plastic handguns would have banned a number of firearms.
   Metzenbaum also said the NRA literature contends that the
waiting-period bill would set up a national handgun registration
system and that the Congressional Budget Office estimates it would
cost law enforcement agencies $30 million to $40 million a year to
implement.
   The senator said the bill requires that all forms generated be
destroyed within 60 days and that the CBO estimates are for another
bill requiring different federal background checks.
   Baker said there is nothing in the legislation that would
prevent police from taking the information in the forms and putting
it into some centralized record-keeping file. However, he
acknowledged that the cost estimate applied to a different, 14-day
waiting period proposal.
   ``It was the best one we had,'' he said. ``It was an estimate.''
   Baker charged Metzenbaum with running campaign ads which said
the senator took on the gun lobby and passed a bill to outlaw
cop-killer bullets. Baker said the NRA in fact supported the final
bill on cop-killer bullets.
   ``I don't think that the National Rifle Association is the only
one that uses some hyperbole in their fund-raising documents,''
said Baker.
   Phillip McGuire, associate director of the Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms, told the subcommittee that a national
seven-day waiting period would make it more difficult for drug
dealers to buy handguns from licensed dealers.
   McGuire said a drug dealer with dozens of convictions can
currently buy an Uzi at a gun store by falsifying forms. The Uzi is
defined as a semiautomatic handgun that can fire 100 rounds a
minute, he said.

<HEAD>Astronomers Find Planet Near Distant Star</HEAD>

   A group of astronomers making routine
measurements on a star have found the first confirmed evidence of a
planet orbiting a star other than our own sun.
   David W. Latham, who led the team that made the discovery, said
the planet is 30,000 times larger than the Earth and probably
lifeless because it would have a surface temperature of hundreds of
degrees.
   ``It's much hotter than an oven,'' said Latham. ``This is not a
place you would look for life.''
   The planet is so close to its star that it orbits once every 84
days, Latham said. Mercury, the planet closest to the sun, has an
orbit of 87 days.
   Latham reports on the discovery today at the 20th general
assembly of the International Astronomical Union in Baltimore.
   Latham and his team found the planet while running instrument
tests on a star called HD 114762. He said the star was one of a
group called ``candidate standard stars'' that astronomers have
been measuring for years to establish the characteristics of basic
star types. The study is being conducted to give astronomers
worldwide a standard for calibrating instruments.
   Using light gathered by a 61-inch reflector telescope at the Oak
Ridge Observatory in Massachusetts, the astronomers processed the
star sightings through an instrument called the photon counting
system.
   The instrument detected a slight wobble in the motion of the
star that could only be caused by a nearby orbiting body.
   Latham said the planet would have to be massive, some 20 times
larger than Jupiter, the largest planet in the solar system, in
order to give star HD 114762 such a wobble.
   ``It's at the upper edge (of being the size) of a planet,''
Latham said. Minimum starlike bodies are usually 100 times the size
of Jupiter.
   Despite its size, the planet is too small and too distant to be
seen directly. Star HD 114762 is 90 light years from Earth, about
522 trillion miles away. Seeing the planet would be like trying to
sight a single candle placed beside a powerful searchlight on the
moon, Latham said.
   Instead, the scientists used calculations of the gravitational
effects on the star to determine that another body was there.
   Latham said the discovery raises the intriguing possibility that
``companion bodies,'' or planet-like bodies orbiting stars, may be
more common than previously believed.
   ``It wouldn't surprise me if more people started finding them,''
he said.
   Latham added: ``It would be pretty boring if there weren't lots
of planets because that would mean there aren't many chances for
life.''
   The technique that discovered the planet around star HD 114762
is not sensitive enough, he said, to find a planet the size of
Earth.
   ``We're far short of being able to find anything as small as
Earth,'' he said, because the gravitational effect on a star would
be too slight to be detected.
   Star HD 114762 is a magnitude 7, too faint to be seen by the
naked eye. It is also a spring star, seen only from March through
July. The tilt of the Earth causes it to be blotted from view by
the sun from August through February.
   Detection of the planet around the star has been confirmed by a
Swiss astronomer, Michel Mayor, at the Geneva Observatory.
   Members of Latham's team include Robert Stefanik, Richard
McCrosky and Robert Davis of the Smithsonian, and Tsevi Mazeh of
the University of Tel Aviv.

<HEAD>Ethanol Clash Looming as Senate Leaders Push Trade Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senate leaders are pushing for fast action on
their bill to curb trade deficits but they face obstacles posed by
Farm Belt lawmakers who want to reduce Caribbean ethanol imports.
   ``We are going to send the president another trade bill,''
Senate Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., said Tuesday as
lawmakers turned to the 1,000-page measure that has lingered on
their calendar in one form or another for the last three years.
   They planned to discourage any amendments, whisk the
House-passed measure through the Senate and speed it toward
President Reagan's desk this week.
   Amendments would send the measure to a House-Senate conference
committee that easily could become bogged down. Senate leaders said
that might prove fatal with only 26 legislative days remaining
before they recess and head for the campaign trail full time.
   However, an array of amendments quickly materialized, including
changes proposed by Sen. J. James Exon, D-Neb., and other farm
state lawmakers opposed to a provision of the bill that would
increase the amount of duty-free ethanol imported from the
Caribbean.
   Ethanol is ethyl alcohol made from agricultural products and
blended with gasoline to form the fuel gasahol. U.S. corn growers
are sharply opposed to any increase in imports and complain that
the Caribbean product often consists of European goods, such as
Spanish wine, recycled in island refineries.
   The lawmakers are seeking to delete the ethanol provision, or at
least alter it to bar any upsurge in shipments.
   The trade bill, dormant for weeks, came to the Senate floor only
hours after President Reagan announced that he would allow to
become law a separate measure requiring companies to provide their
employees with advance notice of plant closings and large-scale
layoffs.
   Reagan had vetoed an earlier version of the trade bill which
contained the plant-closings provision, saying that provision would
needlessly tie the hands of business.
   There had been an implied threat than unless the president
signed the plant-closings measure, the trade bill could die in the
Senate.
   The administration has not been very enthusiastic about trade
bills, either, but it is getting anxious to receive congressional
authorization to conclude agreements under the current Uruguay
Round of international trade talks. The bill would provide that
authorization along with accelerated consideration by the House and
Senate of deals made in the negotiations.
   ``The president indicated that he wanted a trade bill _ that's
why he swallowed the plant closings,'' said Senate Minority Leader
Bob Dole, R-Kan.
   Besides giving the administration authority to reach trade
agreements, the measure would streamline the machinery under which
the government imposes import restraints. They are used to protect
U.S. industries and retaliate against violations of international
rules and other unfair practices.
   Other provisions range from a potential $2 billion in
agricultural subsidies to repeal of the windfall profits tax on oil
company earnings.
   The measure is largely shorn of the protectionism that once
brought fierce opposition from both the administration and a raft
of congressional critics.
   Even though the measure is likely to pass by a wide margin, one
of the Senate's most outspoken free traders, Sen. Daniel J. Evans,
R-Wash., was critical of it in floor debate Tuesday night.
   ``The real problem isn't corrected by this bill,'' he said.
``The real problem is that we as a nation are spending too much,
living beyond our means and saving too little,'' Evans said.
   Evans, whose home-state economy includes an export-dependent
aircraft industry and a major port, said that because the economy
is now performing well the measure ``is probably too late if it was
ever necessary and in this senator's view it was probably never
necessary at all.''
   ``This trade bill represents those who fear the future, not
those who have confidence in the future,'' he said.

   The federal government will throw new muscle
into the fight against the area's deadly street gangs, but the
police chief of the nation's second-largest city complained the
added effort is just ``crumbs from Washington.''
   A 34-member task force will attack the web of gang crime that
has afflicted Los Angeles and spread to other cities across the
West and Midwest, U.S. Attorney Robert C. Bonner said Tuesday.
   Police Chief Daryl Gates, noting that federal and local agencies
routinely work together, welcomed the effort, but also complained.
   ``What is new is that we're getting just a few crumbs from
Washington,'' Gates said.
   Referring to increasingly mobile drug-dealing gang members,
Gates said: ``We had to send the little, rotten SOBs to 446 cities
throughout the United States and terrorize some of the other cities
before Washington recognized we had a problem.''
   The task force will prosecute gang members under federal
statutes that are more stringent than state laws.
   Task force members include reassigned employees from the Drug
Enforcement Administration and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms, the U.S. Attorney's Office, 10 police departments, the
Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, and state, county and city
prosecutors.
   Smashing Los Angeles street gang drug-trafficking organizations
at their source ``requires federal support and federal prosecution
and recognition that this is a national problem,'' Bonner said,
noting that gang involvement has been reported in ``rock'' cocaine
distribution in dozens of U.S. cities.
   Previous federal efforts had snared some gang-related drug
traffickers, but their primary focus was on high-level,
international distributors of illegal narcotics, he said.
   Bonner said federal prosecutions would employ organized crime
statutes against gangs and to get stiff penalties, such as
mandatory five-year prison sentences for possession of as little as
5 grams of cocaine.
   Pretrial detention and forfeiture of property also will be used.
   ``We will be using the bottomless pit of the federal system,''
Bonner said.
   At Tuesday's news conference, representatives of Sen. Alan
Cranston, D-Calif., presented a statement urging support for
legislation introduced by Cranston and California congressmen Mel
Levine and Howard Berman that would add 600 agents to federal
agencies in Los Angeles.
   The lawmakers said the Los Angeles situation required greater
effort than the use of 300 federal agents assigned in 1982 to stem
the flow of drugs in Florida.
   City Attorney James Hahn said Los Angeles was ``unquestionably
the gang capital, drug capital of the United States'' and he noted
that in the first six months of 1988 there were 112 gang-related
murders within city limit compared with 99 during the period last
year.
   In the county, at least 166 people have died this year in
gang-related violence and 387 were killed last year. Among the
latest victims of gang violence was a 19-year-old man shot to death
this week on a south Los Angeles street.
   Hahn said state laws aren't tough enough and he lauded the state
Assembly's Public Safety Committee for its approval Monday of a
bill intended to help authorities crack down on street gangs.
   The bill would increase prison penalties for gang-related crimes
and make it a crime to be involved with a street gang while knowing
the gang intends to be involved in criminal activity.
   The bill also would make parents responsible for supervising
minor children to help prevent gang activity.

<HEAD>Coretta Scott King Seeks Federal Funds for Holiday Commission</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD KEIL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Coretta Scott King says Congress must provide
``the means and encouragement'' for the federal commission that
coordinates observances of the holiday honoring her late husband,
the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.
   ``The Congress placed an enormous responsibility upon the
commission, but it gave no funds,'' Mrs. King, who chairs the
Martin Luther King Jr. Federal Holiday Commission, told a House
panel Tuesday.
   ``I ask the Congress which gave birth to the national holiday to
help us continue our work _ to give us the means and encouragement
to complete the job we have just started.''
   The King commission was created on a temporary basis in 1984 as
part of a bill to make the civil rights leader's birthday a
national holiday. Because of opposition to the bill from some
conservative members of Congress, led by Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C.,
funding plans for the commission were dropped in order to get the
bill passed.
   The commission's congressional mandate expires in April 1989,
and a bill sponsored by Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., now before the
census and population subcommittee of the House Post Office and
Civil Service Committee, would provide $300,000 in annual funding.
   Sen. Lowell Weicker, R-Conn., a supporter of the Conyers bill,
said requests to the commission now outstrip what the group is able
to accomplish.
   ``The commission has more work than the meager resources it has
been able to raise from the private sector can begin to support,''
Weicker said.
   Rep. Mervyn Dymally, D-Calif., who chairs the House panel,
agreed and pledged to add an amendment to the legislation that
would increase funding to at least $500,000 per year.
   The commission processed more than 5,000 information requests
and helped 135 state and local governments plan holiday events in
1987, according to commission records.
   The Atlanta-based commission collected $183,552 in private
contributions in 1987, and has no paid employees, the records
showed.
   Nearly all money received went to producing newsletters and
pamphlets on King's life, said Lloyd Davis, the commission's
executive director. Staff assistance comes from federal employees
``loaned out'' from their agencies on a temporary basis, he said.
   By contrast, the Commission on the Bicentennial of the United
States Constitution will receive $21 million in federal money this
year, while the United States Holocaust Memorial Council will
receive just over $2 million.
   ``We're talking about a desperate situation,'' Davis said. ``We
simply can't do it without some federal help.''
   Dymally said the bill should reach the full Post Office and
Civil Service Committee next week, and be considered on the House
floor in September.
   The holiday is officially celebrated on the third Monday in
January, which falls close to King's Jan. 15 birthday. The only
states that do not observe the date are Arizona, New Hampshire,
Montana, Wyoming, South Dakota and Idaho.
   Besides King, only George Washington and Abraham Lincoln have
their birthdays marked by national holidays.
   Meanwhile, Mrs. King revealed some of the plans for a second
March on Washington, to be held in commemoration of the historic
``I Have a Dream'' speech her husband delivered 25 years ago before
more than 200,000 civil rights activists in front of the Lincoln
Memorial.
   The celebration, scheduled for Aug. 27, will focus on
employment, housing and civil rights issues, she said.

   Representatives for producers and striking
scriptwriters met Tuesday, exploring ways to break a deadlock in
the 22-week-old labor dispute that has shut down most Hollywood
production.
   The informal talks were continuing as of 11 p.m. Tuesday.
   Although the top West Coast official of the Writers Guild of
America expressed hope that agreement could be reached, the union
and producers declined to elaborate Tuesday on the exact nature of
the discussions.
   ``There is nothing I can comment on now,'' spokeswoman Cheryl
Rhoden said. ``We are using every avenue we can to have the talks
resume.''
   After the formal, federally mediated talks collapsed early
Saturday morning, intermediaries for the opposing sides made
contact to determine if negotiations should resume, Ms. Rhoden said.
   The contacts spurred hope among some at WGA headquarters that a
settlement with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television
Producers might be near, two guild sources said, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   Herb Steinberg, a spokesman for the producers alliance,
confirmed that intermediaries were attempting to resume talks.
``The alliance is not a part of it,'' Steinberg said. ``It's
shuttle diplomacy.''
   The main sticking point in the contract dispute is how much
writers should be paid for syndicated reruns of television shows.
The 9,000-member guild blamed the collapse of formal negotiations
on the alliance, while producers said the guild made unreasonable
demands and refused to compromise.
   Brian Walton, executive director of the guild on the West Coast,
said late Monday that he had spoken with two representatives of the
dissident Writers Coalition, which has threatened to break away
from the guild to return to work.
   The coalition of 21 writers has pushed for a strike settlement
under contract terms that the guild has strongly opposed.
   Walton said he did not guarantee them that an end to the strike
was imminent, but asked them to remain patient. ``All I said was
that I was hopeful,'' Walton said.
   The group has threatened to drop out of the strike and was
expected to resign from the guild this week. After a four-hour
strategy conference Monday, the coalition announced it would
continue to honor the walkout that began March 7.
   But the dissidents will again reconsider resigning if the strike
continues past week's end, said Lionel Chetwynd, a spokesman for
the coalition.
   An official at 20th Century Fox film studio said Monday that his
company will pay any union fines incurred by striking scriptwriters
who cross picket lines.
   Barry Diller, the head of 20th Century Fox, made the offer,
according to Fox spokesman Michael Binkow.
   Guild fines against strike-breaking writers are set at 110
percent of all compensation received for unauthorized strike work,
and violators are subject to lifetime expulsion from the guild, Ms.
Rhoden said.

   A prominent Sikh extremist swallowed
poison and died after he was spotted by police in northern Punjab
state, the United News of India said.
   The agency quoted the Punjab police chief, K.P.S. Gill, as
saying Gurmit Singh, wanted for several killings, swallowed
potassium cyanide Tuesday after policemen confronted him when he
stepped off a bus near the town of Barnla.
   Gurmit Singh was believed to be involved in the July 25 killing
of Sohan Singh, the chief priest of the Golden Temple in Amritsar.
Sikh militants opposed the May appointment of the moderate priest
to the post at the temple, the holiest shrine of the Sikhs.
   Sikh extremists, fighting a guerrilla war since 1982 for an
independent homeland in Punjab, have been blamed for nearly 1,600
killings this year. The radicals often pick Hindus and moderate
Sikhs as targets.
   Sikhs, who make up 2 percent of India's 800 million people but a
majority in Punjab, allege they are discriminated against by
Hindus. Hindus account for more than 80 percent of the population.
   The Sikh religion was founded about 500 years ago as an
alternative to Hinduism and Islam.
   Militants have used the Golden Temple as a base. In June 1984,
government troops stormed the temple, and at least 1,200 people,
mostly Sikhs, were killed.
   In October 1984, Sikh bodyguards killed Prime Minister Indira
Gandhi in revenge.

   Video entrepreneur G. Stuart Karl has
pleaded guilty to two counts involving unlawful political
contributions made to the campaign of former Democratic
presidential candidate Gary Hart.
   Karl, 36, of Newport Beach, entered his plea Tuesday in U.S.
District Court to two counts of a 12-count indictment handed up by
a federal grand jury in June.
   He pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy involving efforts
to impede an investigation by the Federal Election Commission and
to one count of making a political contribution in the name of
another person.
   Under terms of the plea bargain approved by Judge Alicemarie
Stotler, Karl may be fined $350,100 and given six months probation,
but will get no jail time in return for his cooperation with
authorities in a federal investigation.
   He faced a maximum of 36 years in prison and $930,000 in fines.
   Karl was released on $25,000 bail pending sentencing Sept. 19.
   The indictment charged Karl, producer of the Jane Fonda
``Workout'' videos, with six counts of campaign financing law
violations, one count of conspiracy and five counts of filing false
statements.
   It alleges Karl asked former employees to contribute up to
$1,000 each to various candidates, then reimbursed them in cash.
   The bulk of the donations, $159,500, went to Hart's 1984
presidential campaign, the indictment said.

   Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar
backed down and said he would not try to impose a cease-fire in the
Iran-Iraq war after Iraq declared it would reject such a truce.
   Iraq continued Tuesday to insist on direct talks with Iran
before a cease-fire. But in Iran, President Ali Khamenei said his
government would not agree to face-to-face negotiations before a
truce and that an end to the 8-year-old war appears ``extremely
doubtful.''
   Riyadh al-Qaysi, Iraq's former U.N. ambassador and now a member
of the Iraqi delegation to U.N.-mediated peace talks, accused Iran
of seeking ``simply a cease-fire which they so urgently need after
their successive defeats.''
   He said Iraq would reject any cease-fire it had not agreed to
and would not allow Iran to regroup during a truce: ``We will not
accept a fait accompli, no matter in what form or from which
quarter it comes.''
   Iraq has continued attacks on Iran despite Tehran's announcement
July 18 that it was finally accepting a year-old U.N. Security
Council cease-fire resolution.
   Iraq said last year that it would accept Resolution 598, which
calls for a cease-fire, withdrawal to recognized borders, prisoner
exchange, peace negotiations and an investigation of which side
started the war.
   On Monday, Perez de Cuellar said, ``Listen, D-Day (the day a
cease-fire begins) does not depend on the parties.''
   Asked if he might announce D-Day if Iraq remains opposed, the
U.N. chief said: ``That is a decision which I have to take in any
case in consultation with the members of the Security Council.''
   But on Tuesday, he said: ``When I say I will declare a
cease-fire with members of the Security Council, I do not exclude
that I would be in touch with the two foreign ministers.''
   U.N. officials said the secretary-general would be consulting
now with the head of a U.N. fact-finding team, Gen. Martin Vadset
of Norway, who arrives Thursday from the Persian Gulf, then with
the Security Council and foreign ministers Ali Akbar Velayati of
Iran and Tariq Aziz of Iraq.
   On Tuesday, Perez de Cuellar did not meet official with either
foreign minister. The talks began last week.
   Khameini said: ``We shall not accept any preconditions from Iraq
over the implementation of the resolution and a cease-fire on the
fronts ... such as direct negotiations or any other condition.''
   ``If Iraq sets down preconditions, we too shall set down a
condition and ours will be what we have stated before, the
punishment of the aggressor,'' he said in a speech on Tehran radio,
monitored in Cyprus.
   During the year of Iran's holdout on the resolution, it insisted
there could be no truce until Iraq was branded as the aggressor.
Iraq invaded Iran in September 1980 after several border skirmishes.
   In a speech at a rally in Ahvaz, near the Iraqi border, Khamenei
criticized ``the Iraqi regime's attitude during the past two weeks,
its obstructionist behavior regarding the implementation of
Resolution 598.''
   ``I look at the prospect of achieving peace and an end to the
war in the context of Resolution 598 as extremely doubtful and
suspect,'' he said. ``This enemy has proved that it understands
nothing except the language of force and of strength.''
   Qaysi said Resolution 598 ``is not simply a cease-fire. It is a
peace plan and that has to be negotiated face-to-face to test the
real intentions of Iran.''
   Iranian Ambassador Mohammad Ja'afar Mahallati said the
secretary-general should declare a D-Day to begin a cease-fire even
if Iraq is opposed and that the Security Council should consider
imposing an arms embargo against Iraq if it does not accept a truce.

<HEAD>Prosecutor Says More Indictments Expected in Libya Case</HEAD>

   Three men who have refused to testify
before a grand jury investigating an alleged plot to use Libyan
government money to recruit support in the United States can remain
free until Thursday afternoon to appeal a contempt order, a federal
judge ruled.
   U.S. District Judge T.S. Ellis III on Tuesday gave Vernon
Bellecourt, William Means and Bob Brown until 5 p.m. Thursday to
appeal to the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals the order that they
be jailed for civil contempt of court.
   The three have been told they are not targets of the
investigation. They were promised immunity from prosecution but
refused to testify in protest over the government's wire tapping of
their phones and what they said were other violations of their
rights.
   Six Libyans and two other Arab nationals were accused last week
in a 40-count indictment that charges them with laundering money
and violating the 1986 Libyan sanctions regulations that prohibit
travel to and transactions with Libya.
   The indictment makes no mention of previous accusations that one
of the eight participated in a plot to assassinate a senior U.S.
official _ purportedly former White House aide Oliver North _ who
helped plan the 1986 U.S. bombing of Libya.
   Attorney John Keats, representing Bellecourt and Means, argued
that their testimony was not needed since the grand jury already
had returned indictments.
   But Assistant U.S. Attorney Lawrence J. Leiser said that ``there
are continuing ongoing investigations being conducted by the grand
jury.''
   ``Are you referring to indictments other than those already
handed down?'' asked Ellis.
   ``Absolutely,'' Leiser replied. He did not elaborate.
   Bellecourt, of the White Earth Chippewa Nation from northern
Minnesota, said he visited Libya several times and was an organizer
of a 1987 rally in Tripoli marking the first anniversary of the
U.S. bombing.
   Means, of the International Indian Treaty Council, also has
acknowledged visiting Libya.
   Brown is from the All-African People's Revolutionary Party,
which supports a unified Africa. Before the hearing, he told a news
conference: ``We proudly traveled to Libya to condemn this
government's barbaric attack and reaffirm our First Amendment
right.''

<HEAD>Report: Rep. Chappell Being Investigated in Defense Probe</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Investigators probing alleged Pentagon
procurement fraud are investigating whether Rep. Bill Chappell and
others receive money illegally funneled from the Unisys Corp., The
Washington Post reported today.
   The money allegedly came to Chappell, a Florida Democrat, and
others influential in defense contracting through operating
expenses and purchasing orders of Armtec Inc., a small
subcontractor based in Palatka, Fla., the newspaper said, citing
unidentified sources. Federal agents seized records from the
Florida plant in a June 14 raid.
   Chappell could not be reached for comment Tuesday night, but he
told the newspaper he is not a target of the investigation and that
he has conducted himself in an ethical manner.
   ``I think it is inappropriate for me to comment on any aspect of
this ongoing investigation and I hope the investigation will go
forward in the most fair, expeditious manner,'' Chappell told the
Post.
   Under investigation are allegations that defense contractors and
consultants, many of them former military men, bribed Pentagon
officials for contracting details that could be vital in winning
contracts worth billions of dollars.
   Documents unsealed in a New York court last month showed that
investigators were examining whether private consultants and others
extorted campaign contributions from companies.
   The papers also indicated investigators were looking into
whether defense industry officials, consultants and others bribed
federal officials involved in authorizing or appropriating defense
contracts.
   Chappell and other congressmen have been mentioned earlier as
subjects of investigative interest in the probe.
   However, Henry Hudson, the U.S. attorney for northern Virgnia
who is in charge of the investigation, has told congressional
leaders that no members of Congress were targets of the probe,
according to congressional sources who attended meetings with
Hudson.
   The newspaper said the investigation involving Chappell concerns
William W. Roberts, a retired Unisys executive; William M. Galvin,
a defense procurement consultant, and Charles F. Gardner, a former
vice president of Unisys' plant in Great Neck, N.Y.
   Roberts and Galvin formed Armtec in 1986 to produce wire
harnesses for a shipboard electronic warfare system manufactured at
the Great Neck plant, and Gardner arranged for the noncompetitive
contract with Armtec, the newspaper said.
   Investigators have subpoenaed the financial records of an Ocala,
Fla., health club in which Chappell once had an interest.

   Rebels attacked a passenger boat on a
remote southeastern river Tuesday and killed two people and wounded
27, including an American clergyman, according to government and
witness reports.
   A witness to the attack on the Rama River said about a dozen
Americans and several Sandinista soldiers were aboard the vessel, a
regular passenger boat on the river called the Peace Mission.
   Witnesses said about 200 people were aboard the vessel.
   The boat was traveling upstream to the town of Rama after
leaving Bluefields, the country's main Caribbean port, when a group
of Contras began firing weapons at about 4 p.m., the Defense
Ministry said.
   It said two people were killed and 27 wounded, and that all the
victims were civilians.
   One of the American passengers, Gail Walker, 29, said her
father, the Rev. Lucius Walker, ``was grazed in the buttocks by a
bullet,'' but he ``was fine now'' and receiving some stitches.
   Speaking in a telephone interview in Managua, where the group
was flown after the attack, Ms. Walker said the attack lasted about
10 minutes.
   Walker, 59, of Demarest, N.J., is executive director of the
Inter-Religious Foundation for Communication Organizations, an
inter-denominational group based in New York. Ms. Walker, 29, of
Paterson, N.J., is its communications programming director.
   The communique said the raid occurred near the village of El
Mango, about 150 miles southeast of Managua.
   The Rama River connects the recently built Managua-Rama road and
links the capital with Bluefields, where Nicaragua receives the
bulk of its military supplies from the Soviet Union, Cuba and other
Soviet bloc nations.
   The only other port capable of handling military supplies is
Puerto Sandino, on the west coast, which would require a long trip
through the Panama Canal.
   Ms. Walker said the Contras opened fire on the boat two hours
before it was to reach Rama.
   ``I dove down the stairs. I figured brusies were better than
bullet holes. The bullets came through the walls,'' she said,
adding that she was ``a little bruised, a little hoarse, a little
scared but OK.''
   About 20 Sandinista soldiers were on the top deck when the
attack came, but most of the Contra fire was aimed at the
mid-section of the vessel where the civilians were standing, Ms.
Walker said.
   She said she and her father came with the religious group, which
does not support President Reagan's Central American policy, to
Nicaragua on July 26 ``to find out first hand the actual situation
of the country.''
   ``Now we're all in agreement on condemning Contra aid. This was
a civilian boat,'' she added.
   No confirmation or claim of responsibility had surfaced by late
Tuesday from the U.S.-supported rebels, known as Contras.
   The Contras have tried to cut the Managua-Bluefields supply link
several times. In January, they seized several towns and villages
along the Managua-Rama road to stop the supply flow, but later
retreated.
   The attack violates a fragile cease-fire to which the Contras
and the leftist Sandinista government agreed on March 23.
   Later efforts by the two sides have failed to negotiate a
permanent truce in the 7-year-old war and Reagan is seeking to
renew military aid to the Contras, which Congress cut off in
February.
   The cease-fire was due to end June 30, but was tacitly extended
by both sides, despite complaints of violations. The truce was due
to expire again on July 31, but President Daniel Ortega
unilaterally extended it to Aug. 31.
   The last Sandinista-Contra meeting was on June 9. The Saninistas
offered to meet again in Managua on Aug. 26-29, but the Contras
said they want the meeting held outside the country.

   A small Filipino cargo vessel exploded
and sank in the Gulf of Oman early today, Persian Gulf-based
shipping executives reported.
   The cause of the explosion could not be immediately determined
and it was not known if there were any casualties.
   The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
explosion could have resulted from engine problems, but they did
not exclude the possibility that the vessel hit a mine.
   The executives identified the vessel as the 1,870-ton Fatima.
   They said a French warship in the vicinity rushed to help and
rescued seven crew members about 30 miles off Oman outside the
Strait of Hormuz, gateway to the Persian Gulf.
   Mines were detected south of where the vessel sank during the
rash of explosions last summer that prompted the United States and
other nations to send mine sweepers.
   Iran was accused of planting the mines as part of its strategy
in its 8-year-old war with Iraq.
   No mine incidents have been reported since the U.S. warship
Samuel B. Roberts hit one in the gulf in April.
   The area where the Fatima blew up is roughly where the Kuwaiti
tankers flying the American flag assemble for escort by U.S. Navy
warships through the Strait of Hormuz and up to Kuwait.
   Kuwait reflagged the 11 tankers in the United States last summer
to obtain U.S. protection from Iranian attacks.
   An Iranian envoy to the gulf Arab capitals recently said he
expected that Kuwait would call soon for an end to the escort
operations because of Iran's acceptance last month of a year-old
U.N. cease-fire resolution.
   The U.N. secretary-general is negotiating with Iraq and Iran to
implement the resolution.

   A former day-care teacher who sexually
abused 19 preschoolers has been sentenced to 47 years in prison,
after a mother of one of the victims told the judge, ``Our lives
will never be the same.''
   Margaret Kelly Michaels, who must serve 14 years before she is
eligible for parole, said before her sentencing Tuesday that prayer
and faith in God would help clear her name in an appeal.
   ``I have confidence in the appeals court to vindicate me,'' said
Ms. Michaels, who sat impassively during her sentencing. ``I have
spent a lot of time in prayer, and especially spent time praying
for those bearing false witness against me.
   ``I declare today as I declared over three years ago ... I
declare my innocence.''
   Ms. Michaels' attorneys were preparing to file her appeal today.
   Superior Court Judge William F. Harth imposed the sentence after
a three-hour hearing that included a call by a spokeswoman for
parents of the victims to have the 26-year-old former drama teacher
imprisoned for life.
   ``Our lives have changed drastically and dramatically in the
last three years,'' the mother of one of the victims said tearfully
on behalf of the other parents. ``Our lives will never be the
same.''
   Harth ordered the news media not to use the mother's name.
   His sentence, especially the minimum parole term, clearly upset
parents, who declined comment.
   Ms. Michaels of Pittsburgh was convicted April 16 on 115 counts
of sexually abusing 19 children, ages 3 to 5, while they were in
her care at the now-defunct Wee Care Day Nursery in suburban
Maplewood from October 1984 to April 1985. She also was convicted
of endangering the welfare of a 20th child.
   Prosecutors said during the trial that Ms. Michaels performed
sexual acts on the children with kitchen utensils, forced them to
perform sexual acts on her and engaged in sex play, such as having
the children pile atop one another while nude. Prosecutors also
alleged she played ``Jingle Bells'' for the children on the piano
while nude.
   ``The facts in this case are sordid, bizarre and demeaning to
these children,'' Harth said before he imposed the sentence that
included fines of $2,875 against Ms. Michaels.
   Defense attorney Harvey Meltzer said the appeal of the
conviction would be on the basis that children testified against
Ms. Michaels on videotape. In June, the U.S. Supreme Court
overturned the sex conviction of an Iowa man who was behind a
shield when two teen-age girls testified against him. The high
court held that victims and defendants must confront each other in
court.
   Meltzer said his client was prepared for a harsher sentence.
   Parents milling about after the sentence declined to be
interviewed, but complained to one another about what they
considered to be a short parole eligibility term.
   Ms. Michaels was convicted of 34 counts of first-degree
aggravated sexual assault, 39 counts of second-degree sexual
assault, one count of second-degree attempted aggravated assault,
39 counts of third-degree endangering the welfare of a child and
two counts of third-degree terroristic threats.
   The first-degree convictions each carried a maximum sentence of
20 years, the second-degree convictions 10 years apiece and the
third-degree convictions five years.
   Specifically, Ms. Michaels received two 20-year terms and one
seven-year term to run consecutively. She was scheduled to remain
in the Essex County Jail Annex at least until today's bail hearing.

   An Oakland physician has been installed as
the new president of the National Medical Association, one of the
nation's oldest black professional organizations.
   Dr. Frank E. Staggers Sr. was installed as the 87th president of
the group of 1,500 black physicians meeting here this week.
   In assuming leadership of the group, which was founded in
Atlanta in 1895, Staggers told his colleagues that black physicians
need to form a coordinated policy to deliver the best health care
to their patients.
   ``As NMA president, I will be adressing those issues and my
other goals will be to address the challenges that impact the black
family, especially the young black male,'' Staggers said in a
statement.
   ``If we are to address the issues of the drug culture, the AIDS
epidemic and the associated violence perpetuated upon our
communities by these problems, we must address the pathology of
young black males in our country,'' he said during his acceptance
speech.
   He said the greatest health crisis confronting the black
community is that the health of young black men is threatened by
drug abuse, violence and the AIDS epidemic.
   A native of Charleston, S.C., Staggers is married to California
Assemblywoman Teresa P. Hughes.

   Business at the General Hospital cafeteria here
has been victimized in an attack of Big Macs, Health and Hospitals
Manager John Fairman says. So he wants to reopen negotiations with
the fast-food chain.
   After just a month of operation, the McDonald's at the hospital
has been eating into cafeteria, snack bar and vending machine
revenues, he said.
   The restaurant apparently has cost the cafeteria $500 a day _
even on burrito day _ and an additional $150 at the snack bar
operated by hospital volunteers.
   ``By projecting the daily drop we're having right now, we could
lose $20,000 a month,'' Fairman said Tuesday.
   The city is guaranteed a yearly rent of $80,000 plus 6 percent
of McDonald's sales exceeding $1.3 million. When the contract was
signed last year, city officials believed the arrangement would
bring in a total of $150,000 yearly.
   ``We're clapping our hands over $150,000?'' Fairman asked.
``That's an embarrassment. The $150,000 didn't take into
consideration the loss factor in the cafeteria and vending
machines.''
   Fairman has written a letter to McDonald's, suggesting that ``we
renegotiate the financial terms'' of the deal with the hospital.

   Peacocks and peahens have
``peaturbed'' a lot of residents here, so the City Council voted to
buy traps to help catch some of the colorful birds.
   The peafowl population has increased since 1984, when a forest
fire in the area reduced the number of coyotes roaming the area.
Before that, coyotes kept the peafowl population down by preying on
them.
   The birds, known for their fan-like tails, have been causing
problems for residents in the north part of the city, nestled at
the foot of the San Gabriel Mountains just north of Los Angeles.
   Robert Barrow, who led the drive against the peacocks, said he
has spent $200 so far this year to replace vegetation eaten by the
birds in his yard.
   ``My wife buys (plants), I dig the hole, she plants them and the
peacocks tear them up,'' he said. ``If some people want to keep
peacocks, they should keep them on a leash.''
   The boxlike traps will be loaned to residents who can catch the
animals and turn them over to the Wildlife Way Station.
   ``People have a right to take action just as if they were
bothered by gophers or skunks,'' Mayor Joan Feehan said when the
council acted on the trap purchases Monday night.

   Rescuers picked up six Filipino
sailors who drifted at sea for a month after their ship sank in
heavy seas, the Federal Sea Safety Surveillance Center said today.
   The six were found Tuesday in a lifeboat 240 miles southwest of
Perth and were the only survivors of the Philippines-registered
Singa Sea, which disappeared in rough weather in the Indian Ocean
early last month, the center said in a statement.
   Eighteen of the Singa Sea's crew of 25 died when it went down
and another died during the month in the lifeboat, the center said.
   The survivors were suffering from burns and exposure, the center
said. They told crewmen aboard the rescue ship, the Greek bulk
carrier Standard Virtue, that their ship broke up and sank
immediately in heavy seas on July 4.
   The 27,000-ton Singa Sea left Bunbury in western Australia July
2 and its last radio contact was the next day, when it was reported
340 miles west of Bunbury.
   Royal Australian Air Force searches failed to find any trace of
the ship, which was en route to the Netherlands via South Africa
with a cargo of mineral sand.
   A long-range helicopter with a doctor aboard set off today to
rendezvous with the Standard Virtue to provide medical treatment
for the survivors and take them to the mainland, the center said.
   Maritime experts said the Singa Sea's cargo may have shifted in
heavy seas. Dennis Bennett, manager of Patrick Agencies, the agents
for the ship, said he had been told the ship broke up after falling
from the crest of a wave in mountainous seas.
   Bad weather hit the area on July 4, with winds reported up to 55
mph. Searches for wreckage along the Australian coastline failed to
find any debris from the vessel.

<TEXT>
   A retarded man who panhandled his way
around the country for 17 years with little memory of his past
suddenly recalled his father's name, allowing officials to reunite
him with his stunned family.
   ``For 17 years, I had resigned myself to the fact he was dead
and buried and I'd never know where,'' said Patricia Brewer of
Rochester, N.H., the sister of Frank Caswell.
   Caswell, 51, says he spent the years hitchhiking across the
country, panhandling for food and living in shelters and mental
hospitals. He has been a patient at Eastern State Hospital here for
almost nine months.
   Until last month, when he suddenly remembered the name of his
father, Caswell could not tell hospital workers where he was from.
He said he may have lived in Dover, N.H., and told Phillips he
thought he had a sister who was still alive.
   Earlier, he gave hospital officials inaccurate names of
relatives.
   ``It's a miracle,'' said Caswell. He was sent to the hospital
Nov. 12 after being disruptive at a mission for the homeless in
Norfolk, where he was found with no identification, money or extra
clothes.
   Ms. Brewer said Tuesday that although her father, Harley
Caswell, has been dead since 1981, a social worker was able to
locate the family because the telephone number was still in his
name.
   ``It was still in his name all these years,'' she said. ``My
stepmother left it.''
   Family members gave Ms. Brewer's phone number in Rochester,
which is close to Dover, to Eastern State Social worker Martin
Phillips, who called to tell her Caswell was alive.
   ``When Mr. Phillips called me and asked if Frank Caswell was my
brother, I just took a deep breath figuring they had found a body.
When he said he was alive and well, I just went to pieces,'' said
Ms. Brewer, 53, who is co-manager of a Wendy's fast-food restaurant.
   She has not seen her brother since he left Dover in 1971 without
telling anyone.
   Caswell said he is eager to return to New Hampshire and has
promised never to leave again.
   Phillips said officials hope Caswell can return to a hospital
for the mentally ill in New Hampshire and be reunited with his
sister during the next two months.

<TEXT>
   A judge has sentenced two self-styled
revolutionaries to long prison terms for their part in a string of
armored car robberies, including a botched 1981 Brink's holdup that
left three people dead.
   In handing down his sentence Tuesday, U.S. District Judge
Charles Haight described defendants Marilyn Jean Buck and Mutulu
Shakur as ``gifted and capable people who crossed the line into
deadly violence that mocks compassion.''
   Shakur was sentenced to 60 years and Buck was sentenced to 50
years for their May conviction on racketeering, bank robbery and
murder charges.
   ``I am not guilty of any criminal act,'' Shakur, 37, told
Haight, prompting applause from supporters among 150 people packed
into the heavily guarded courtroom.
   Dressed in a gray business suit, Shakur, a one-time Harlem
acupuncturist, said, ``I am a freedom fighter,'' and supporters
took up the chant: ``Freedom fighter!''
   Ms. Buck, 40, wearing a floral print dress, said she was
committed to battling ``the malignant cancer of racism,'' adding,
``I am here for advocating change and justice.''
   She is already serving 15 years in prison on other convictions.
Ms. Buck is also under indictment with six other people in
Washington for a series of protest bombings, including a 1983 blast
at the U.S. Capitol.
   In calling for prison terms, Assistant U.S. Attorney Kerri
Martin gestured toward the widow and young son of Edward O'Grady, a
police officer slain in the 1981 robbery.
   ``They have waited seven long years to have justice done in this
case,'' said the prosecutor.
   Both defendants could have been sentenced to a maximum of life
in prison.
   The defense had contended that Shakur, who is black, and Ms.
Buck, who is white, are revolutionaries who were put on trial
because of their political beliefs.
   Prosecutors charged Shakur, who was once on the FBI's 10 Most
Wanted List, with masterminding the $1.6 million holdup of a
Brink's truck at a suburban Rockland County mall on Oct. 20, 1981.
A guard and two Nyack police officers were killed in the bloody
aftermath of the robbery.
   Ms. Buck and Shakur also were convicted of a June 2, 1981,
armored truck robbery in the Bronx during which another Brink's
guard was killed.
   The charges against the pair included a wave of robberies and
attempted armored truck robberies in New York and Connecticut.
   They also were convicted of a racketeering conspiracy for their
part in a gang that called itself ``The Family'' and allegedly
robbed to support radical black political activities.
   At least 12 other people have been convicted on state and
federal charges at earlier trials.
   As part of their racketeering conviction, Ms. Buck and Shakur
were found to have played key parts in the November 1979 prison
escape of radical Joanne Chesimard.
   Chesimard, a Black Liberation Army leader who had been serving a
life sentence in a New Jersey prison for the murder of a New Jersey
state trooper, was not apprehended and is believed to be living in
Cuba.

<HEAD>Legislators Seek End To Racially Offensive Marketing Practices</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Legislators concerned about racially offensive
marketing practices by some Japanese companies are calling for an
end to derogatory representations of blacks and warning of a
possible boycott if changes aren't made.
   The head of the Congressional Black Caucus on Tuesday made
public a letter to Japanese Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita urging
him to call a meeting with Japanese businessmen ``to formally bring
an end to the negative stereotypic representations of black
Americans once and for all.''
   Rep. Mervyn M. Dymally, D-Calif., the caucus chairman, suggested
blacks might boycott Japanese products if changes are not made. He
said the portrayal of blacks in marketing and advertising in Japan
is insensitive and racially inflammatory.
   Members of the Black Caucus and other legislators accused the
Sanrio Co., Sogo Department Store and Yamato Mannequin Co. of
producing products and mannequins which show blacks in a
stereotypical and degrading light.

<HEAD>Drunken Driving Bill Gets Support From Beer Distributors</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Legislation that would encourage states to
crack down on drunken drivers has gained a vote of support from the
nation's beer distributors, who say they don't need the business of
intoxicated drivers.
   ``We don't want their business,'' Ronald R. Rumbaugh, president
of the National Beer Wholesalers' Association, told the Senate
Commerce consumer subcommittee Tuesday. ``In fact, we want to put
them out of business.''
   The subcommittee heard from Rumbaugh and other private and
government officials about proposed legislation offering increased
federal aid to states that adopt several strict plans intended to
prevent traffic accidents caused by drunken drivers.
   Among them are the immediate confiscation of a driver's license
when the operator fails a chemical test for intoxication or refuses
to take such a test. The state would have 15 days to suspend the
license or return it to the operator.

<HEAD>Comment Sought On Plan To Ensure Accuracy of Lab Tests</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal government is accepting public
comments on a proposal to toughen standards for clinical
laboratories in an effort to ensure the accuracy of Pap Smears and
other tests.
   The proposed rules apply to the 12,000 labs that are federally
regulated either because they do work under Medicare or Medicaid or
engage in interstate commerce.
   The practical effect is to cover virtually all commercial labs,
except those in physicians' offices. However, Congress has ordered
the Health Care Financing Administration to regulate physicians'
office labs that test 5,000 specimens or more starting in 1990.
   The 90-day comment period outlined in Tuesday's Federal Register
also solicits comments on whether the uniform standards should
apply to physicians' office labs once they are covered by federal
standards.

   The Consumer Product Safety Commission says
two soft plastic dolls sold in craft stores around the nation are
being recalled because small children might choke on their parts.
   The dolls, 4{ inches and 5{ inches in height, are unclothed and
sold in clear plastic bags. The larger one has red hair, freckles
and painted-on red shoes.
   Wang's International of Memphis, Tenn., packaged the dolls,
which were labeled Cupid Doll PDT3538 or PDT631D on the packages
but not the dolls.
   The safety commission warned that the arms can be pulled off the
dolls, creating a potential choking hazard for small children. No
injuries have been reported, but the agency urged Tuesday that the
dolls be taken away from children and returned to retailers for
refunds.

<HEAD>`Green Grocer' Dead at 73</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BURLINGAME, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Joe Carcione, who has offered millions
of people consumer tips as TV's ``Green Grocer,'' has died after a
long battle against intestinal cancer. He was 73.
   Carcione, who began his career in his father's produce market
after finishing high school, died Tuesday at Peninsula Hospital of
cardiac arrest, said his son-in-law, Charlie Erle.
   The gravelly voiced produce expert whose trademark was his
pronunciation of ``VEG-ee-tibles'' was famous for his weekly radio
and television spots in which he told consumers about produce
bargains and pitfalls. He also wrote two books.
   At his peak, Carcione wrote three newspaper columns a week,
producing TV and radio spots that reached 10 million listeners and
helped him earn $500,000 a year. He was syndicated on about 80 TV
stations nationwide.
   He attributed his success to his sincerity.
   ``I'm going to tell the truth,'' he said. ``If I can't do what's
right, I'm going to get off the air. There's no other way.''
   Two years ago, he told the San Francisco Chronicle that people
would see him on the street and say, ``Hi Joe, I feel like I know
you.''
   ``That's a real compliment,'' Carcione said.
   He began working in his father's produce market in San Francisco
in 1933 after finishing high school.
   In 1957, he got started in broadcast when he began making his
own commercials. He later was asked to do unpaid grocer spots on
San Francisco's KCBS and other radio stations.
   In 1974, KRON-TV offered to pay him and his career took off.
   His produce warehouse in the Golden Gate Produce terminal in
South San Francisco now is mostly operated by his oldest son, Peter.
   The elder Carcione would go to work at 5 a.m., strolling through
the terminal, sampling fresh fruits and vegetables and making notes
for his shows and columns.

<HEAD>Jackson Assails Bush, Kemp Urges Blacks To Join GOP</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   George Bush was hailed before the National Urban
League by Rep. Jack Kemp as a friend of blacks, while Jesse Jackson
assailed the vice president for failing to address many social
challenges facing the nation.
   Kemp, a New York congressman who bowed out of the Republican
presidential chase earlier this year, told about 300 Urban League
members Tuesday that the GOP will be wooing black voters as
aggressively as the Democrats.
   ``George Bush is going to seek the votes of blacks,'' Kemp said,
telling the crowd to ``come home'' to a party that will rebuild the
inner city with incentives for entrepreneurs.
   ``We want you. We want you home,'' Kemp said.
   Jackson, speaking at a reception attended by about 150 league
members, accused Bush, the likely GOP presidential nominee, of
failing to rise to many social challenges as vice president.
   ``George Bush, at the hour of challenge, has never been there.
We needed someone to fight the war on drugs. George Bush was not
there. We needed someone to fight to extend the Voting Rights Act.
... In a real sense, George Bush has never been here,'' Jackson
said.

   A New Jersey congressman is pushing to have
the platform adopted at the Republican National Convention include
a plank that reflects a commitment to equality and the civil rights
movement.
   Republican Rep. James Courter said Tuesday he has drafted a
proposed plank that addresses housing issues, discrimination,

   ``The Republican Party of Lincoln was founded to be the party of
natural rights and civil rights, the party to fulfill the meaning
of the Declaration of Independence when it says that all human
beings have an equal right to life, liberty and pursuit of
happiness,'' Courter said.
   ``I believe Republicans must show that we are serious when we
talk about the politics of inclusion,'' Courter said. ``Above all,
I believe Republicans should do it because it is morally right.''

<HEAD>Sanctuary Defense Fundamental to Acquittal, Attorney Says</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An attorney for one of two people
acquitted in a federal alien-smuggling trial says jurors will
always find sanctuary workers innocent if they legally can.
   ``They don't want to have someone who is doing good, who is
trying to help a refugee in need, to be a felon,'' said Karen
Snell, a San Francisco attorney who has worked on sanctuary-related
cases in Arizona and Texas.
   She was one of three lawyers for the Rev. Glen Remer-Thamert, a
Lutheran who with freelance journalist Demetria Martinez, was
acquitted Tuesday of smuggling two pregnant Salvadoran women into
the United States in August 1986.
   Remer-Thamert's defense revolved around a proclamation issued in
March 1986 by then-Gov. Toney Anaya, who declared New Mexico a
sanctuary state. The sanctuary movement started in the early 1980s
to aid Central American refugees, largely from El Salvador and
Guatemala. The proclamation was rescinded in 1987 when Garrey
Carruthers became governor.
   Anaya said Tuesday the defense hinged on whether Remer-Thamert
believed the proclamation had legal effect.
   ``It did not, but the issue was whether he believed it did,'' he
said.
   The proclamation was symbolic, Anaya said, adding, ``I made that
clear at the time.''
   Still, he said, he hoped the verdicts ``will prod federal
prosecutors, religious leaders and political leaders in Washington
into re-evaluating what we are doing in Central America.''
   U.S. Attorney William Lutz said the acquittals would have no
effect on his office's prosecution of similar cases.
   ``We felt there was good evidence the (Salvadoran) women entered
illegally and were transported illegally. I don't think anyone can
argue with that,'' he said.
   ``But the question was one of intent and the jury disagreed with
our position on what the intent was.''
   The prosecution contended the two Salvadorans were not refugees
because they came to the United States to give up their babies for
adoption and to work, and because they intended to return to El
Salvador.
   But defense attorney Alice Hector said most refugees intend to
return to their native land sometime. She said that to say someone
can't be a refugee if they intend to go back ignores the concept of
temporary residency inherent in refugee status.
   The sanctuary movement contends that under international law and
the 1980 Refugee Act, people from war-torn areas are entitled to
enter the United States and live here until conditions improve in
their homes.
   Remer-Thamert said after his acquittal he hopes immigration
authorities will grant the two Salvadoran women refugee status and
allow them to stay in this country.
   The jury deliberated 4{ hours over two days before acquitting
Remer-Thamert and Ms. Martinez on all counts.
   Juror Antoinette Tellez, 23, said the jury relied heavily on
Anaya's sanctuary proclamation. ``It all came down to intent,'' she
said. ``I think this would have been a different case without the
sanctuary proclamation.''
   Juror Yvette Carrillo said the government had a poor case and
the jury was swayed by the sanctuary proclamation arguments in the
case of Remer-Thamert. She also said jurors agreed from the start
of deliberations that Ms. Martinez was along solely as a reporter.

<HEAD>Court Throws Out One Conviction In Gandhi Slaying; Upholds Two</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RAJU GOPALAKRISHNAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today threw out the
conviction and death sentence of a former security official in the
assassination of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and ordered him
released immediately.
   But the three-judge panel upheld the convictions and death
sentences of two other Sikhs in the Oct. 31, 1984 killing.
   The court said prosecutors failed to prove conspiracy charges
against Balbir Singh, who was arrested more than a month after the
slaying, accepting the appeal of the former subinspector in Mrs.
Gandhi's security guard.
   But it rejected appeals by Satwant Singh, a police constable who
was one of Mrs. Gandhi's bodyguards, and Kehar Singh, a government
official.
   A trial court had sentenced all three men to death by hanging,
and the sentences were upheld by the New Delhi High Court.
   The Supreme Court is the final court of appeal in India, but the
condemned men can appeal to President Ramaswamy Venkataraman for
mercy.
   Satwant Singh and another bodyguard, Beant Singh, shot Mrs.
Gandhi to death in the garden of her New Delhi residence. Beant
Singh, also a Sikh, was shot and killed by other security guards
just after the assassination.
   ``The manner in which she (Mrs. Gandhi) was mercilessly attacked
... repels any consideration of reduction in the sentence of
Satwant Singh,'' said Justice G.L. Oza, the senior judge on the
panel.
   ``In this view of the matter, even the conspirator who inspired
the persons who actually acted, does not deserve any leniency in
the matter of sentence,'' he said.
   Prosecutors had proved charges of conspiracy against Kehar
Singh, the maternal uncle of Beant Singh, he said.
   The three defendants are not related. ``Singh,'' which means
lion in the Punjabi language, is part of every Sikh male's name by
doctrine of the minority faith.
   The Supreme Court was ringed by policemen wielding automatic
rifles to prevent any attacks by Sikh terrorists. Visitors to the
courtroom were frisked and forced to pass through a metal detector.
   ``I am very pleased with the judgement,'' Swaran Singh, the
brother of Balbir Singh, said outside the court. ``They caught an
innocent man, but now justice has been done.''
   The chief defense lawyer, Ram Jethmalani, was not present. But
his daughter, Rani, who is also his junior partner, said: ``The
court has vindicated us.
   ``Balbir Singh was just roped in by the overzealousness of the
police with the collusion of the government,'' she said. ``The Sikh
community should feel that finally the Supreme Court has given them
some justice.''
   Mrs. Gandhi was slain in revenge for an Indian army raid on the
Sikhs' Golden Temple in Amritsar the previous June. At least 1,200
people died in the attack, most of them Sikhs.
   The slaying triggered anti-Sikh riots in New Delhi and other
northern cities in which more than 2,000 people were killed. Most
of the victims were Sikhs. Mrs. Gandhi's son, Rajiv Gandhi,
succeeded her as prime minister.
   Sikh radicals have been fighting since 1982 for a separate state
in the northern Indian state of Punjab, where Amrisar is located.
   They say Sikhs are discriminated against by Hindus, who are more
than 80 percent of India's 800 million people. Sikhs form about 2
percent of the population but are a majority in Punjab.
   The army raid on the Golden Temple, Sikhism's holiest shrine,
was meant to drive out Sikh radicals who took refuge there.
   The militant movement has grown, and more than 1,600 people have
been killed this year in attacks blamed on Sikh militants.

<HEAD>Lady Bing Hospitalized in Psychiatric Ward</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lady Carroll Douglass Bing, the wife of former
Metropolitan Opera impresario Sir Rudolf Bing, has been
hospitalized and undergoing psychiatric treatment for the past two
weeks, her attorney says.
   ``She's an emotionally fragile lady,'' her attorney, Harvey
Sladkus said Tueday. He blamed her current instability on attempts
by Bing's attorneys to annul her marriage.
   Sladkus said the 48-year-old Lady Bing remains at St. Luke's
Hospital, where she was taken by police after a July 17 incident.
Sladkus said he did not know the nature of the incident.
   The Bings were married in January 1987 in Maclean, Va. Bing's
attorneys are attempting to have the marriage annulled on the
grounds that the 86-year-old former impresario did not know what he
was doing when he married his wife. Bing has Alzheimer's disease.
   On May 9, state Supreme Court Justice Carmen Ciparick ordered a
psychiatric examination of Lady Bing at her attorney's request.
Lady Bing had shown an apparent inability to follow the court's
directions.
   ``My client has lost touch with reality,'' Sladkus told the
judge.
   That same day the judge ordered Lady Bing to leave her husband's
apartment for six hours each day so that nurses could attend to him.
   Sladkus said he has asked the judge to stay all annulment
proceedings until doctors say Lady Bing is able to defend herself.
He said the judge scheduled Aug. 10 for further proceedings in the
case.
   Sladkus said he was told of Lady Bing's hospitalization by her
sister, who lives in Washington, D.C.
   The attorney said he did not know how long his client would
remain hospitalized.

<HEAD>City Council Renames Park Named For Klan Leader</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STONE MOUNTAIN, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After weeks of wrangling, the City
Council reversed its decision to name a park after a former Ku Klux
Klan leader but granted him a plaque, in a compromise angering
blacks and Klan members.
   The council, which includes two black members, voted unanimously
Tuesday to name the ballfield ``Veterans Park'' and to place a
marker at the park noting that James R. Venable, a Stone Mountain
resident since 1936 and a former mayor, donated the land for the
park in the 1940s.
   Venable, the 83-year-old former imperial wizard of the National
Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, accused the city leaders of giving in
to pressure ``from liberal, pinko communist types.'' The vice
president of the DeKalb County NAACP called the new name an
``insult to all veterans.''
   Outside, an angry crowd of 100, including members of the DeKalb
County National Association for the Advancement of Colored People,
knocked on windows demanding to get into the meeting, which was
closed because of a capacity crowd.
   However, many in a quiet audience of 30 inside the council
chambers, which included at least one Klansman, broke into applause
after the vote.
   Venable did not attend the meeting, but heard the news from a
parking lot outside City Hall.
   ``I'm disappointed with them. I knew they were weak-kneed. My
own race is weak-kneed,'' he said.
   NAACP members were not happy either.
   ``My preference is to not have his name associated with the park
at all,'' said Coleman Seward, vice president of the DeKalb NAACP.
   ``It's an insult to all veterans _ black, white and Jewish _ to
have his name associated with the park. It's a disgrace.''
   The City Council voted unanimously on July 12 to name the park
after him, apparently not expecting the ensuing media coverage and
public outcry from civil rights groups and some residents.
   At the time, Robert Smith, one of the black council members,
said he favored the move because Venable's past affiliation was
``not my concern.''
   Because of the controversy, Venable wrote Mayor Jane Rhodes
three days later, asking the city to rescind the action and she
agreed.
   But within 1{ weeks, he changed his mind and wrote the mayor and
six council members again, asking them to name the park after him
after all.
   Gloria Brown, a black resident who attended the meeting, said
she would have been happy if the council stuck with its original
decision to name the ballfield ``Venable Park.''
   ``He's a citizen of this town and he's done wonderful things for
this town,'' she said. ``If he's a member of the Klan, it's his
private business. I'm a staunch member of the NAACP.''
   ``The council should've named a park after Jimmy Venable years
and years ago for what he's done for this town,'' said E. Bill
Fitzgerald, who wore a faded gold Klan robe and described himself
as imperial wizard of the Invisible Empire of the Knights of the Ku
Klux Klan.

   Betty Hearnes, who once occupied the
governor's mansion as first lady, now has an opportunity to return
as the state's chief executive, while voters also approved making
the state's lottery more lucrative.
   Former Democratic presidential hopeful Richard Gephardt easily
won the party nomination for a seventh term in Congress, while farm
activist Wayne Cryts earned a chance for a rematch against
Republican Rep. Bill Emerson.
   Mrs. Hearnes won overwhelmingly in Tuesday's Democratic primary
and now faces Republican Gov. John Ashcroft in November's election.
   With 97 percent of precincts reporting, Mrs. Hearnes had 368,390
votes, or 81 percent, and Lavoy ``Zaki'' Reed, a St. Louis-area
teacher, had 84,123 votes, or 19 percent.
   ``I think you can say it's a new era for the Democratic Party,''
said Mrs. Hearnes, whose husband, Warren, served as governor from
1965 to 1973. ``We're excited because we intend to win it all. They
(Republicans) can sit home and talk about a sweep, but we'll be out
working and winning.''
   Ashcroft had no primary opposition as he bids for a second term.
   On the lottery amendment with 96 percent of precincts reporting,
455,068 voters, or 57 percent, had voted in favor and 337,182, or
43 percent, voted against the amendment.
   The amendment removed restrictions that now limit the lottery to
spending 45 percent on prizes, 45 percent on the state and 10
percent on administrative costs.

   A new blast of scorching weather in the nation's midsection has
increased fears about fall crops that are already wilting from
thirst, and experts say the effects of the drought may extend into
next year.
   Despite scattered July showers, farmers say it will now take an
exceptional amount of rain the rest of the year to make up for the
huge moisture deficit caused by the hot, dry spring and summer.
   ``We've never had temperatures like this that I can recall. I'd
say we're going downhill real quick if it stays hot,'' said Indiana
farmer Dan Donathen, who tends 300 acres of corn and soybeans.
   ``I'd say we're in a real blowtorch pressure-cooker right now.''
   Temperatures soared Tuesday to tie or break records in 26 cities
in 12 states: Wisconsin, Minnesota, Michigan, Illinois, Ohio, Iowa,
Indiana, South Carolina, North Carolina, West Virginia, Tennessee
and New York, according to the National Weather Service.
   In Wisconsin, the city of La Crosse broke a 24-year-old record
for the date with 102 degrees, and tied a 1955 mark with its 35th
day of temperatures in the 90s or hotter. Columbia Hospital in
Milwaukee treated 86 heat-related cases in a 24-hour period Monday
and Tuesday. Its normal amount for an entire summer is 56, hospital
officials said.
   Minneapolis-St. Paul set a mark of 101 degrees and Chicago hit
100 for a record the seventh time this year.
   ``It was so hot ... I had to go outside to breathe,'' said
Willie Nabors, who abandoned his un-air-conditioned Milwaukee
apartment Tuesday to join thousands of other sufferers in a cool
shopping mall.
   In the Detroit area, hundreds of Chrysler Corp. workers felt the
same way, walking off their jobs at three factories when
temperatures reached up to 140 degrees near furnaces, United Auto
Workers union officials said.
   Farmers, meanwhile, caught between the heat and drought, worried
about what the weather conditions might do to their crop yield next
year.
   ``The key times for recharging are late fall and early spring,''
said Ken Kunkel, director of the Midwestern Climate Center in
Champaign, Ill. ``If we have a very dry fall, we will be in more
danger next spring.''
   That makes melting winter snow and early spring rain even more
critical in 1989.
   ``It's going to be tough to go into the spring with adequate
soil moisture,'' said Larry Dallas, who farms 560 acres in central
Illinois with his brother.
   ``What corn there is, the rain helped and we've got some decent
sized ears,'' said Dallas, who still expects no more than half a
crop. ``The soybeans perked up and grew a foot, but if it gets hot
and dry again, we'll lose all we've gained.''
   In Carroll County, Iowa, however, some farmers with
better-than-average rainfall were relishing the potential payoff
from grain prices pushed higher by the parched conditions.
   ``We've hit the jackpot at the end of the rainbow,'' county
Extension Director Dennis Molitor said Tuesday. ``It's definitely a
potential gain for a lot of producers.''
   Rain has soaked many fields in parts of Illinois, Indiana, Ohio,
and Kentucky in recent weeks. However, other parts of Illinois,
Iowa, Wisconsin, and Minnesota remained relatively dry, Kunkel said.
   ``Certainly, the drought is not over,'' said Kunkel. ``Soil
moisture reserves are very limited.''
   Late-July showers were also welcome in Kentucky and Arkansas.
   ``It's looking a whole lot better,'' said Kentucky farmer Homer
Hurst Jr. ``We actually cut some hay yesterday. ... We reseeded 65
acres of corn and we're hoping for a late fall.''
   But farmers in other drought states have not been as fortunate.
In South Dakota, experts said rains came too late to save most
crops and the state approved a program to help farmers and ranchers
replace dried-up water supplies.
   ``It's the same old story: we need rain; we're not getting
any,'' said Herb Halvorson, assistant agriculture commissioner in
Minnesota, who indicated heat now may be causing more damage than
drought.
   ``The impact on the corn and the soybeans and the canning crops
has been devastating.''

<HEAD>Governing Party Brings In New Blood After Election Losses</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ISAAC A. LEVI</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The governing party chose a young political
scientist as its general secretary in what appeared to be the
beginning of a major leadership shakeup after a poor showing in
recent elections.
   At a carefully planned meeting Tuesday night, the Institutional
Revolutionary Party party's national executive committee accepted
the resignation of veteran Humberto Lugo Gil and unanimously named
Manuel Camacho Solis to replace him.
   Camacho Solis, 42, is a close friend and associate of victorious
presidential candidate Carlos Salinas de Gortari. His selection
followed a promise by Salinas to modernize and streamline the
party, which has been in power in Mexico since it was founded in
1929.
   Camacho Solis promised in his acceptance speech to bring new
blood to the party leadership, which has been little more than a
closed club of politicians.
   Salinas, 40, won the presidential election July 6 with about 50
percent of the vote. But for the first time in decades, he was
strongly challenged by two opposition candidates _ Cuauhtemoc
Cardenas of the leftist National Democratic Front coalition and
Manuel J. Clouthier of the conservative National Action Party.
   Cardenas, who came in second, and Clouthier, in third place,
claim widespread fraud and have challenged the returns of the
presidential and House and Senate elections, which were held
simultaneously.
   The Federal Election Commission and the Election Tribunal, which
oversaw the balloting, rejected most of the opposition complaints,
and Congress is expected to proclaim Salinas president-elect in
September. He is to succeed President Miguel de la Madrid for a
six-year term Dec. 1.
   But the accusations of fraud sparked widespread irritation among
voters. It was also the first time the governing party won a major
election with less than 70 percent of the vote.
   Also for the first time, the party lost its absolute control of
the Senate. Cardenas' coalition won four of the upper chamber's 64
seats.
   A few days after the election, Salinas said that ``the time of a
one-party system in Mexico is over'' and said his party will have
to learn to live with a growing opposition and compete harder in
honest elections.
   Lugo Gil ostensibly resigned because his native state of Hidalgo
elected him to a Senate seat. But his replacement was viewed as
following Salinas' wish to fill key posts within the party and his
administration with people who share his views.
   Camacho Solis said, ``It is vital that we appear before society
practising an open-door policy for all, not for members of the ...
party, but for the whole of society.''

<HEAD>Two Convicted In Slaying of Tribal Officers; Mistrial for Third
Defendant</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A jury has convicted two Navajos in the
shooting and burning deaths of two tribal police officers, but
couldn't agree on a verdict for a third defendant, who now faces a
murder retrial.
   The federal jury on Tuesday found Thomas Cly, 22, and Vinton
Bedoni, 31, guilty of two counts of first-degree murder and two
counts of using a firearm in the December killings.
   Prosecutors said they would seek a new murder trial for the
third defendant, Ben Atene Jr.
   Atene, 22, must be retried within 70 days under federal speedy
trial rules. He was being held without bail in the Salt Lake County
Jail.
   ``The people on the (Navajo) reservation were watching to see
whether white man's justice worked,'' said U.S. Attorney Brent
Ward, who added he had ``never been so pleased'' with a case since
taking his post.
   Ward said Atene's next trial might be aided by more witnesses,
who, in light of the two convictions, might admit to being at the
murder scene.
   U.S. District Judge Thomas Greene set sentencing for Cly and
Bedoni for Oct. 3. The first-degree murder charges each carry a
possible life sentence and the weapons charges carry five years.
   The jury deliberated 48 hours before convicting Cly and Bedoni.
Greene then ordered the jurors to continue deliberations for Atene.
   When they were unable to come to a decision 90 minutes later,
Greene declared a mistrial in Atene's case. Greene denied a defense
request to acquit Atene.
   First-degree murder charges were dismissed July 22 against
Atene's 22-year-old brother, Marques Atene, when prosecutors
acknowledged they didn't have enough evidence for a conviction.
   The defendants were charged in the slayings of officers Roy Lee
Stanley and Andy Begay, whose charred bodies were found Dec. 5
inside a burned-out police truck in a remote southern Utah canyon.
   During the trial, prosecution witnesses testified that the
officers were shot at the scene of a bonfire and drinking party on
the night of Dec. 4. Alcohol is illegal on the reservation.
   Defense attorney Robert VanSciver said he planned to discuss the
possibility of appeal with his client, Bedoni. Attorney Ed Brass
said he was certain Cly would challenge his conviction.
   The verdict brought relief and sadness to Marie Holiday, whose
brother was Stanley.
   ``I've been thinking about my brother Roy all during this
trial,'' she said. ``I kept thinking about him, so I have this
mixed feeling and I don't know how to describe it.''
   The killings have divided the community of about 2,000 Navajos
living in Monument Valley in southeastern Utah, she said, and she
and her family have been ostracized by many of their neighbors.
   ``They all wept with us when my brother died, but then when
these people were arrested for it, they all turned the other way,''
she said.

<HEAD>Illinois Central's Foresight Helps It Profit During Drought</HEAD>

<BYLINE>By CHARLES J. GANS</BYLINE>

   The drought has kept the mighty Mississippi from
rolling along, but it's helped profits roll in for Illinois Central
Railroad thanks to the troubles of its rival barge haulers, the
railroad's chairman said.
   While barges have been stranded in shallow water, the Illinois
Central, whose tracks have paralleled the river for 137 years, has
been chugging along, bringing grain and coal from Illinois to the
South.
   ``This is probably the first time since the railroad started in
1851 that we've made a profit in July, and we're off to a rather
rousing start in August,'' Harry J. Bruce, chairman and chief
executive of the railroad, said Tuesday.
   He attributed his company's success to an ``educated gamble.''
   Last spring, before the full impact of the drought was felt in
the Midwest, the railroad hired weather forecasters and other
consultants to study Mississippi River water levels, Bruce said.
   After the consultants concluded the drought would make the year
difficult for barge operators who depend on deep water to move
their towboats, the railroad began stockpiling rail cars and other
equipment.
   The Illinois Central spent $700,000 to lease about 600 cars _
primarily covered hopper cars to handle grain _ from as far away as
Canada, Bruce said. Its fleet increased by almost 20 percent in
July, a traditionally slow month for the railroad.
   ``It was a reasoned, educated gamble, and it has paid off
handsomely,'' said Bruce. ``We keep a close eye on what's going on
on the river because it's a main competitive force for us.''
   The railroad's operating income for the second quarter of 1988
was $20 million, compared with $12 million for the period last
year, or a 67 percent increase.
   Joseph Farrell, president of the American Waterways Operators,
said Monday that drought conditions on the Mississippi will cause
the inland barging companies to lose $150 million to $200 million
in revenue between June 15 and Sept. 30.
   In July, the Illinois Central moved 71,075 carloads of freight,
a 12 percent increase over last year, Bruce said. The biggest
increase was in corn and soybean shipments, which totaled 10,221
cars in July compared with only 5,995 cars in July 1987.
   Coal shipments were up by 48.2 percent and chemical shipments by
8 percent for the same period.
   Bruce said the railroad plans to keep its leased cars, at least
into the early part of next year. The railroad's consultants
predict the low river levels will last into the winter, causing ice
jams to form earlier than usual and spread even farther down the
river than normal, Bruce said.
   The current low water levels reflect a 10-year trend in which
the Mississippi has dropped steadily due to reduced snowfalls and
rain, he added.
   ``We've seen for some time now that Ol' Man River hasn't been
rolling along so well.''
   Even so, the U.S. Geological Survey reported that the
Mississippi's water level jumped a surprising 10 percent in the
Twin Cities area in only five hours Tuesday, the result of rainfall
in northern Minnesota during the past few days.

<HEAD>Anglicans Seek Unity With Other Churches</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CANTERBURY, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The world's Anglican bishops adopted
13 resolutions favoring closer relations with other Christian
churches in just 2 hours, 45 minutes of debate.
   The bishops, meeting for the first time in 10 years, got through
the agenda headed ``Ecumenical Concerns'' Tuesday, the 17th day of
the 22-day Lambeth Conference in Canterbury.
   Leaders of 70 million Anglicans in 164 countries, who form the
world's second largest Christian group, have debated for more than
20 years how they might eventually close ranks with the Roman
Catholic, Orthodox, Lutheran, Methodist, Baptist and other churches.
   A separate resolution noted the rapid growth of Pentecostal
churches worldwide and said personal contact and theological
dialogue also should be encouraged with those churches.
   ``We want to be one because Jesus Christ founded only one
church,'' said Canon Christopher Hill, secretary for ecumenical
affairs to Archbishop of Canterbury Robert Runcie, the Anglican
leader.
   The state Church of England with the monarch as temporal head
was created in the 16th century when King Henry VIII broke with
Rome after Pope Clement VII refused him a divorce from Catherine of
Aragon. But it has always considered itself the direct inheritor of
14 centuries of Christianity in Britain.
   About 30 observers from other churches are at the conference,
including two Roman Catholic bishops and a member of the Vatican
secretariat for promoting Christian unity, the Rev. Kevin McDonald.
   A stumbling block to a united Christian church is its leader,
Protestants say.
   Anglican theologians say they probably would be ready to
recognize the primacy of the pope, leader of the world's 700
million Roman Catholics.
   But one observer, the Rev. Dr. David S. Russell, general
secretary of Britain's Baptist Union, told reporters that primacy
``will have to be something very, very different from the present
primacy (of the pope).''
   The bishops broke off the debate to appeal for the release of
all hostages in Lebanon. Their plea came after it was disclosed
that U.S., Australian and English bishops have pressed contacts in
Iran, Lebanon and the United States to get the captives freed.
   Eighteen Westerners are missing, including Anglican envoy Terry
Waite, and the bishops have sought to persuade Iran to use its
influence with the pro-Iranian Hezbollah group believed to hold the
hostages.
   Nine Americans are among those held hostage. The longest held is
Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated
Press. He was abducted March 16, 1985.
   U.S. Episcopal Bishop Robert C. Witcher of Long Island, who
reported he has held talks with Iranian officials in the United
States since April 8, said he expected the hostages would be
released by the end of this year.
   Meanwhile, the bishop of London, Graham Leonard, said Tuesday
night he may fall out of communion with Runcie if Runcie recognizes
women bishops.
   Leonard is the Church of England's leading opponent of women
priests and bishops. On Monday, the all-male bishops approved a
compromise resolution on the issue.
   In effect, it recognized that nothing can be done to prevent
Anglican churches in the United States, Canada and New Zealand from
consecrating the first woman bishop after ordaining hundreds of
women priests.
   The resolution said the 27 self-governing Anglican churches
should respect such a move and that a commission headed by Runcie
be set up to prepare guidelines for it.

   George Bush, the $3 million Lotto winner, says
like his namesake, the vice president, he is a fiscal conservative.
   ``I'll put the first few checks in the bank,'' said Bush, 47, a
mortgage banker from Connecticut who won the money in last week's
New York Lotto.
   ``I don't plan to change my life,'' he said Tuesday after
meeting the press at the Lotto offices.
   Bush shares the $6 million prize with Martin Ahern, 57, of New
York. They will each get $142,857 a year for 20 years.
   ``I was pretty positive I was going to win Lotto,'' Bush said.
``You just get that winning feeling.''

   Voters resurrected the political career of a
millionaire ex-congressman, while a congressman who boasted about
his certainty of victory wound up winning by a smaller margin than
expected in the Michigan primary.
   Jim Dunn, who served one term in Congress then lost 1982, 1984
and 1986 bids for a return to Washington, won the Republican
Party's nomination for U.S. Senate by defeating another millionaire
one-term congressman, Robert Huber.
   The prize: the right to take on Democratic Sen. Donald Riegle,
who hasn't lost an election in 22 years.
   Voters on Tuesday also put on the books a statute prohibiting
casinos within Detroit city limits if they ever are legalized by
the state Legislature.
   In the only lively congressional race, Democrat George Crockett
had a close call in his bid for renomination.
   With 50 percent of the vote counted, Crockett edged Detroit City
Councilwoman Barbara-Rose Collins, 46 percent to 40 percent, in a
four-person race.
   Collins ran an aggressive campaign, criticizing the eight-year
incumbent as a do-little, out-of-touch legislator who failed to
improve conditions for residents of the district.
   Crockett bragged that he was so sure of victory he didn't open a
campaign office and didn't make a single campaign speech.
   Dunn, whose margin of victory was 61 percent to 39 percent, was
equally confident.
   ``We started the fall campaign in February,'' he said. ``We said
all along that our target was Don Riegle.''
   Dunn's road to victory was paved with his own money and a change
in tactics.
   When he unsuccessfully ran for the Senate nomination in 1984, he
alienated voters with sharp attacks on his opponent and alienated
party regulars by condemning their support of ex-astronaut Jack
Lousma. In 1986, he ran a hard-nosed campaign against Democratic
Rep. Robert Carr, earning him the epithet ``junkyard dog.''
   He began his 1988 Senate bid by announcing there was a ``new Jim
Dunn'' who would take the high road in campaigning. And he made an
effort to make peace with the party activists and contributors he
had castigated four years earlier.
   His efforts, and the belief that Huber was too conservative to
unseat Riegle, earned Dunn the endorsements of virtually every
prominent Republican in the state.
   Huber attracted the only real attention of the primary race with
his declaration on acquired immune deficiency syndrome: ``If it
isn't the wrath of God, it should be.''

   Former major-league baseball player
John Ellis, arrested last week on charges of illegally fishing for
lobsters, said he was ignorant of state lobstering laws and called
it ``stupidity on my part.''
   ``It's extremely embarrassing,'' Ellis, now a 39-year-old New
London real estate businessman, said Tuesday. ``I hope I can
restore my reputation in the community. I'm going to work hard at
it.''
   Without commenting directly on the charges filed against him by
the state Department of Environmental Protection, Ellis said he
``made some serious mistakes not knowing the full fish and game
laws. I didn't know about having pots marked. That's stupidity on
my part.''
   Neither Ellis nor his lawyer, Thomas Cloutier, would say how he
would plead when the case is heard Monday. But both pointed out
that Ellis can mail in a $2,650 fine without having to appear in
court.
   Ellis, who played for the New York Yankees, Cleveland Indians
and Texas Rangers during a 13-year career that ended in 1982, said
he also is distressed by the publicity his arrest has attracted.

   A helicopter lifted a
one-man submarine to Wizard Island in the prelude to man's first
in-person look at the bottom of Crater Lake, the deepest lake in
the United States.
   ``This is a fantastic opportunity ... a once-in-a-lifetime
chance,'' Mark Buktenica, a National Park Service fish biologist
scheduled to dive in the Deep Rover submarine, said Tuesday.
   Three weeks of dives from Wizard Island were to begin today in
the 1,932-foot-deep lake, the centerpiece of Crater Lake National
Park in the Cascade Mountains.
   Scientists plan to look for evidence of hot-water vents on the
floor of the 20-square-mile lake. The dives are part of a study of
the lake and a decrease in the clarity of its water in recent years.
   Crater Lake, which was born by the explosion of Mount Mazama
nearly 7,000 years ago, is famous for its clear, cobalt-blue water.
   Scientists theorize vents below the bottom may be altering
clarity by stirring up sediment and plant life in the lake, which
has no inlet or outlet.
   The park service is also concerned that geothermal exploration
planned just outside the park boundary could affect lake water.
   The Deep Rover resembles a big glass ball with a recliner chair
inside. An operator sitting in the chair can maneuver the sub and
manipulate two robot arms while monitoring banks of switches and
instruments.
   Jack Dymond of Oregon State University said he and fellow
oceanographer Robert Collier will first look for small vents they
discovered last summer with a remote-control submarine.
   Collier, Dymond and Buktenica received one week of classroom
training and diving with the submarine at its home base in
Vancouver, British Columbia.
   Buktenica said that despite the sub's sophisticated appearance,
it's fairly easy to operate.
   ``It's only hard in the sense that there is a lot to remember.
You are monitoring your own life-support systems. But mainly I will
be collecting samples and browsing around the lake bottom,''
Buktenica said.

<DATELINE>SANTA BARBARA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Florence Eldridge, a Broadway and
film star and the widow of Oscar-winning actor Fredric March, has
died at age 86.
   Miss Eldridge, a resident of the nearby community of Montecito
since 1980, died Monday in the emergency room at St. Francis
Hospital, a nursing supervisor who declined to give her name said
Tuesday. The cause death was not immediately known.
   Miss Eldridge made her Broadway debut in 1918 as part of the
chorus for the musical comedy ``Rock-a-Bye Baby.'' Later, she
played the role of Daisy in the Broadway version of ``The Great
Gatsby.''
   She married March in 1927, and her husband, one of the top
leading men of his time, won his first Academy Award four years
later for his dual performances in ``Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.''
   He won a second Oscar in 1946 for his portrayal of a returning
World War II veteran in William Wyler's classic, ``The Best Years
of Our Lives.''
   That latter performance, however, was not without its critics.
Miss Eldridge told Broadway columnist Radie Harris that the
couple's daughter, Penny, wasn't pleased with her father's role.
   ``What was far more important to her was the embarrassing fact
that her classmates saw her dad in his pajamas _ and that he drank
too much in the picture,'' she said.
   Miss Eldridge appeared with her husband in such movies as
``Studio Murder Mystery,'' ``Les Miserables'' and ``Another Part of
the Forest'' as well as on stage in ``The Skin of Our Teeth,''
Arthur Miller's `An Enemy of the People'' and Eugene O'Neill's
``Long Day's Journey into Night.''
   The couple also worked together entertaining soldiers during
World War II, and Miss Eldridge once said they logged 35,000 miles
in overseas travel performing for U.S. troops.
   Her husband died of cancer in 1975 at age 77.
   Survivors include their daughter, Mrs. Umberto Fantacci of
Florence, Italy; five grandchildren; a great-granddaughter; and two
brothers.
   Funeral services were to be private.

   TERRITORY: With 481,354 square miles in southeastern Africa,
Angola is the second-largest African country south of the Sahara.
But it has only 8 million people, most of them living in tribal
villages and rural areas.
   HISTORY: Portuguese settlers reached Angola in the 15th century
and ruled it as a colony until Angolan independence in 1975.
Virtually all the Portuguese fled at that time, leaving the country
more than 90 percent illiterate and woefully short of capital and
skilled workers.
   GOVERNMENT: The Marxist Popular Movement for the Liberation of
Angola, one of the guerrilla groups who fought the Portuguse, has
controlled the country since it seized Luanda, the capital, in
early 1976 with the help of Cuban troops. An estimated 50,000 Cuban
troops are aiding the Angolan government. President Eduardo dos
Santos has consistently refused negotiations with the National
Union for the Total Independence of Angola, known as UNITA, which
seeks a power-sharing agreement.
   REBELS: Jonas Savimbi's UNITA rebels fought the Portuguese until
they departed and now oppose the government. UNITA receives U.S.
and South African military aid. South Africa has an estimated 3,000
troops in Angola. UNITA says it controls about one-third of Angola
and claims widespread popular support.
   ECONOMY: Almost 200 oil wells in the Angolan enclave of Cabinda
supply more than 90 percent of the country's export earnings. U.S.
oil companies help run the petroleum fields. Cuban and Angolan
troops protect them from UNITA guerrillas, who use American weapons
in a bid to sabotage the facilities. Angola is also rich in
diamonds and has potential for mining other minerals including
uranium.
   REFUGEES: About 1.5 million Angolans have fled areas of fighting
and are registered as displaced persons in the country, according
to the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. Neighboring Zambia has
given shelter to 97,000 Namibian refugees. A small number of
Angolan refugees are in Botswana.

<HEAD>Author, Poet Raymond Carver Dies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PORT ANGELES, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Raymond Carver, a mill worker's son
who survived despair and drinking to become one of the nation's
leading writers of short fiction, has died of lung cancer. He was
50.
   ``He died very nobly,'' said his brother-in-law, Douglas Unger,
a creative writing professor at Syracuse University. ``He didn't
let on how bad his condition was.''
   Carver died at his home Tuesday of a disease that was diagnosed
after he completed his last short story collection, ``Where I'm
Calling From.'' He underwent surgery last fall, according to
Newsweek magazine.
   About the time Carver's last book was issued this year by
Atlantic Monthly Press, he was named to the American Academy and
Institute of Arts and Letters in New York.
   His first collection, ``Will You Please Be Quiet, Please?,'' was
published in 1976 and nominated in 1977 for a National Book Award.
   In January 1983, Carver became the one of the first recipients
of the Mildred and Harold Strauss Livings Award, a renewable,
tax-free stipend of $35,000 a year for five years from the American
Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters.
   He was awarded a Wallace Stegner fellowship in 1972, a National
Endowment for the Arts fellowship in 1971, a Guggenheim Foundation
fellowship in 1979 and a 1987 Governor's Writers Award from Gov.
Booth Gardner. His works won O. Henry awards for best short story
in 1974, 1975 and 1980.
   His books include ``What We Talk About When We Talk About Love''
(1981), ``Cathedral'' (1983), ``Fires'' (1983) and a poetry
collection, ``Ultramarine'' (1986).
   He recently completed another poetry collection, ``A New Path to
the Waterfall,'' Unger said.
   A native of Clatskanie, Ore., Carver grew up in Yakima. His
father was a saw-filer in a lumber mill, his mother an occasional
waitress or retail clerk.
   He took a correspondence course in writing while in high school.
After graduating in 1956, he worked for six months at a sawmill and
the next year married Maryann Burk. They later divorced.
   Carver moved to California in 1958, took an introductory
fiction-writing course from the late author John Gardner,
transferred to Humboldt State and earned his undergraduate degree
in 1963.
   After attending the University of Iowa from 1963 to 1964, he
worked for three years as a night janitor at a Sacramento hospital
and wrote during the day.
   ``I thought that he was dead in the early '70s,'' Unger said.
``He was as close to death from drinking as anyone I ever knew.
   ``He went 18 years ... unrecognized by the literary world. He
despaired and went through a period of really hard drinking. He
couldn't take the discouragement.
   ``Then a miracle happened _ he called it a miracle _ that
someone discovered his work.''
   Carver once said he did not believe fiction had to bring about
personal, moral or social change.
   ``It just has to be there for the fierce pleasure we take in
doing it. ... Something that throws off these sparks _ a persistent
and steady glow, however dim.''
   Carver taught writing at various schools and was an English
professor three years until 1983 at Syracuse University. His wife,
poet and short story writer Tess Gallagher, is on leave from her
teaching job at Syracuse.
   They lived in this northern Olympic Penninsula town from
December through August each year.
   In addition to Ms. Gallagher, survivors included his mother, son
and daughter.
   A graveside service was scheduled here Thursday.

<HEAD>Destructive Thunderstorms in Texas</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Thunderstorms rumbled over much of the United States today after
slashing Texas and the East with hail as big as golf balls and
winds up to 70 mph which destroyed barns and flooded a Utah town.
   Along with damaging thunderstorms Tuesday, scorching heat
snapped or tied temperature records for the date in 26 cities in 12
states.
   Thunderstorms lingered today in central Texas. Widely scattered
showers and thunderstorms also lingered in the upper Ohio Valley
and the Southeast.
   Widely scattered thunderstorms and showers extended from upper
Michigan to southern Iowa and from the central High Plains to
Nevada. Fair skies prevailed across the rest of the nation.
   On Tuesday, thunderstorms in north central Texas destroyed or
damaged barns, broke windows, downed trees and power lines, and
damaged or destroyed outhouses. Gusts of 70 mph were recorded in
Lubbock, and Kerrville got 3 inches of rain in only an hour.
   In Escalante, Utah, more than 2 inches of rain fell in half an
hour, flooding basements and overwhelming the town's new sewer
system.
   ``It was really something,'' said Police Chief Kent Robinson.
``You could have had a boat down Main Street, no problem.''
   In Georgia, thunderstorms downed trees in Douglas County and
winds gusting to 60 mph at Atlanta's Fulton County Airport.
   Thunderstorms dropped golf ball-size hail on West Virginia, and
downed trees or power poles in parts of that state and western
Pennsylvania.
   Temperature records up to 98 years old were broken or tied in
Iowa, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, West
Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and New York.
   It was 102 degrees in Alpena, Mich., where the old record for
the date of 84 was set in 1987 and 98 in Milwaukee, where the mark
of 96 had stood since 1890.
   The nation's high Tuesday was 109 degrees at Bullhead City, Ariz.
   Today's forecast called for scattered showers and thunderstorms
along a stationary front from northern Utah to Wyoming, the
northern Plains, Minnesota, and northern sections of the upper
Great Lakes, with thunderstorms in North Dakota; showers and
thunderstorms in Florida, the eastern Gulf Coast and Alabama, north
central and southwest Texas; the mountains of central New Mexico;
southwest Colorado; and central Arizona; and showers in parts of
Maine.
   High temperatures were predicted in the 70s and 80s along the
California coast, and in the Pacific Northwest, the northern and
central Rockies, the northern Plains, northern Minnesota and
northern Maine; between 95 and 105 degrees over parts of the
central Plains, middle Mississippi Valley, the Great Lakes and the
Ohio Valley; between 100 to 110 degrees in the desert Southwest and
the California valleys; and in the 90s in the rest of the nation.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 51
degrees at North Bend, Ore., to 93 degrees at Phoenix.

<TEXT>
   The USS Constellation was able to remain at sea
today after 20 sailors suffered minor injuries while dousing fires
in an engine room on the aircraft carrier, Navy officials said.
   The injured sailors were taken to Balboa Navy Hospital here for
treatment, said Lt. Cmdr. Bob Pritchard, a Navy spokesman. Most of
the injuries resulted from smoke or burns and all were minor, he
said.
   ``The ship remains at sea and intends to remain there to make
sure there are no reflashes and to assess damage, at which point a
decision will be made as to when she will return to port to effect
repairs,'' he said.
   The entire crew of about 2,500 was battled the fires, which
began shortly after noon Tuesday, Pritchard said.
   The ship had just left San Diego and was less than five miles
off the coast when the first fire started in one the ship's four
engine rooms.
   That fire was contained but flames flared later in the
afternoon, Pritchard said.
   ``Actually we had many small fires,'' he said.
   Navy officials began investigating today what caused the fires.
   The crews of the guided missile cruiser USS Fox and the
destroyer tender USS Acadia assisted in firefighting earlier in the
day because they were in the vicinity when the first fire broke
out, Pritchard said.
   The Federal Aviation Administration imposed a five-mile air
space restriction around the burning ship for five hours, until 9
p.m., Pritchard said.
   The Constellation was heading out for a session in which pilots
qualify to fly various types of aircraft from the carrier, he said.
   The qualification tests are regularly conducted off the Southern
California coast, he said. He expected a ``minimal impact'' on the
schedule of those tests.

<HEAD>Lake-Pumped Water Helps Cut Off Yellowstone Fire</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Firefighters who were denied a forecast rainfall pumped water
from lakes in Yellowstone National Park to head off a blaze that
still flickered toward Old Faithful, while a wind-whipped fire
consumed a lone mountainside in Oregon.
   In Montana and Idaho, a cool front from Canada supplied
firefighters with two needed tools _ lower temperatures and higher
humidity _ as well as a light wind in Montana.
   Yellowstone firefighters, meanwhile, took advantage of the
park's natural resources to cool off some of its largest forest
fires.
   Helicopters with 700-gallon buckets drew water from Lewis Lake
inside the park and Hebgen Lake nearby and dropped the moisture on
three fires, including a 17,700-acre blaze that burned about eight
miles west of the Old Faithful Geyser.
   The water drop was successful in keeping the fire away from the
tourist attraction, said fire information officer Larry Blade. He
said the blaze was 66 percent contained by Tuesday afternoon and
total containment was expected by Friday.
   A forecast for rain, however, yielded none. ``It's all gone to
Canada on us,'' said fire information officer Earl LaOrange.
   About 750 firefighters kept busy attempting to contain a second
major Yellowstone fire that has consumed more than 145,500 acres of
parkland.
   In Oregon, a wind-fanned forest fire late Tuesday rapidly spread
to more than 500 acres on privately owned, mountainous forest land,
much of it inaccessible to firefighters, officials said.
   The fire on land owned by Weyerhaeuser Co. was fueled by slash,
stands of young fir and recently harvested timber waiting to be
trucked out, said Doug Decker, a spokesman for the state Forestry
Department.
   ``It's burning on real steep, kind of isolated terrain,'' Decker
said. ``It's difficult to move heavy equipment in that kind of
area. The limited access certainly has affected it.''
   In the Boise National Forest near Cascade, firefighters pushed
toward full containment of the 200-acre Riordan Lake fire, aided by
cooler temperatures and higher humidity.
   Fire managers in Montana predicted that the 3,200-acre Rock
Creek fire would be contained by this morning after being held in
check Tuesday by 871 firefighters and the Canadian cool front.

<TEXT>
   Chinese farmers whose only child is a girl are
now allowed to have a second child in the hope that they have a
boy, a family planning official said today.
   The policy marks a break from China's usual program of limiting
each couple to only one child.
   Li Yong, a spokesman for the State Birth Control Commission,
said China was now permitting peasants ``in almost every province''
to have a second child if their first was a girl.
   Peasants make up 80 percent of China's 1.07 billion people.
   An official at the United Nations Fund for Population Activities
said the move was unusual because China recently has taken steps to
enforce its ``one family, one child'' policy.
   But relaxation on this issue ``might give them a justification
to crack down harder on other population issues,'' said Manfred
Kulessa, head of that U.N. office in Beijing.
   Li said the new policy was adopted because too many peasants
were ignoring the one-child limit after they had a girl.
   The peasants' belief that boys were economically more productive
than girls and Chinese superstitions favoring male children were
main reasons the one-child policy has not worked, he said.
   Li said the policy change would not greatly affect China's
population growth because only 19 percent of China's families have
one child.
   ``Our real problems are with the families that have three, five
and even seven children,'' he said. ``We need to concentrate on
those now.''
   Li acknowledged that some families abandon girls. On Sunday, the
China Youth News reported the number of abandoned children found in
Beijing was increasing ``at an alarming rate.''
   In 1987, it said, 151 children were abandoned in the city. The
annual average over the previous five years was around 81. The
report said most of the abandoned children were healthy girls or
handicapped children of both sexes.
   Since economic reforms began in 1978, China has been trying to
limit each family to one child.
   China is also in the midst of a baby boom that has seen the
population growth rate jump from 1.1 percent in 1985 to 1.4 percent
in 1987. If the growth rate continues, China's population could
swell to 1.5 billion by 2010.
   In February, China announced stringent measures to control
growth, including a system allocating bonuses to local officials if
they kept the population of their area down and penalizing them if
the population grows too fast.
   Li said families would be permitted to have only one extra child.
   ``After that they will be subject to the same fines as everybody
else,'' he said.
   Fines for having too many children vary from region to region
but generally amount to $270 or more per year for five years, about
twice the average rural income.
   In recent years, increasingly affluent peasants have had the
money to pay the fines.
   ``Why be afraid of a fine?'' goes one poem. ``A sum of money is
a dead treasure but a son is a live treasure.''

   Commonwealth foreign ministers are considering
measures to pressure South Africa to end apartheid, ranging from
army uniforms for Mozambique to a boycott of banks loaning money to
South Africa.
   Over Britain's objections, the 49-nation Commonwealth set up a
committee of eight foreign envoys to review the effect of sanctions
against South Africa and put pressure on it to grant full rights to
the black majority.
   The panel ends two days of talks today. The Commonwealth groups
Britain and former colonies.
   Nigeria's former head of state, Maj. Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo,
told reporters Tuesday that Mozambique and the Commonwealth states
around South Africa, which he toured in March and April, requested
``non-lethal'' items ranging from army uniforms for Mozambique to
spare aircraft parts for Tanzania. He declined to list weapons
sought, but said Canada and other Western countries were not asked
to supply arms.
   ``Lethal items will be very difficult for any democratic
political leadership in the West to sell,'' said Obasanjo.
   But he added: ``As a former military man, the distinction
between lethal and non-lethal aid is semantic, because food can be
lethal. An army marches on a full stomach.''
   He said most of the countries need transportation and
communications equipment, clothing and medical supplies after South
African raids.
   Commonwealth officials said Botswana asked for assistance in
training its police force and Zimbabwe requested aerial photo
equipment.
   Obasanjo singled out Mozambique as the most needy, and said it
was senseless for Canada to provide aid _ about $16 million _ for
the construction of the Limpopo railway line without paying to
protect it from South African sabotage.
   The railway will provide an alternative seaward route for
landlocked Zimbabwe, Zambia and Botswana, making them less
dependent on South Africa.
   Foreign Minister Joe Clark said Canada will not provide military
aid but might donate items such as communications equipment and
uniforms.
   Britain is firmly opposed to sanctions against South Africa, but
is providing military training for Zimbabwe and Mozambique.
   Its prime minister, Margaret Thatcher, criticized the
Commonwealth ministers and said she would ``always shrink'' from
economic sanctions because they hurt South African blacks.
   ``The enormous problems that country has of getting rid of
apartheid will not be helped by a comfortable luncheon ... in a
five-star hotel deciding there should be poverty and starvation on
the part of a large number of black people,'' she said in Canberra,
Australia.
   She said big foreign companies were helping to break down
apartheid by building racially integrated housing and paying
employees on merit.
   Also at the meeting, the foreign ministers of Canada, Australia,
Guyana, India, Nigeria, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe discussed a
report on South Africa's international financial links, reviewed
the effect of sanctions and examined the poorly enforced arms
embargo against Pretoria.
   The finance report said the refusal of major world banks to loan
new funds to South Africa has had the biggest effect.
   It also spelled out possible new sanctions the Commonwealth
could adopt, including a boycott of all banks making new loans to
South Africa, an international ban on export credit insurance
guarantees and restrictions on trade credits.
   Any recommendations from the group must go to the entire
Commonwealth, which meets again in Malaysia next year.
   In Pretoria, South Africa, Canadian Ambassador Robert Maclean
was summoned to the Foreign Ministry and told the activities
amounted to ``blatant interference in the internal affairs of South
Africa.''
   But Clark told reporters ``it's perfectly proper for us to be
involved in the sponsorship of a forum.''
   Three Canadian anti-apartheid groups issued a statement urging
the government to sever diplomatic and economic links with South
Africa and aid the African National Congress, the banned group
fighting the white-dominated government in South Africa.
   Under apartheid, South Africa's 5 million whites control the
economy and government and live apart from the 26 million blacks,
who have no vote in national affairs.

<HEAD>Presser Served As FBI Informant As Early As 1974</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CLEVELAND (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Late Teamsters President Jackie Presser worked
as an FBI informant as early as 1974 and was valued for his
knowledge of mob attempts to control the union, according to
records released in U.S. District Court.
   Oliver B. Revell, executive assistant director of investigations
for the FBI in Washington, said Presser remained on the informant
list until he became international Teamsters president in 1983.
   Presser was then removed from the official informant list but
continued to give information to the FBI voluntarily, Revell said.
   The transcript of a June 20 interview of Revell by attorneys for
Presser and two co-defendants in a criminal case also revealed
Tuesday that then-FBI Director William Webster had warned he would
reveal Presser's role as an informant to a Senate committee in 1983
if Presser denied such a role.
   Webster did not follow through with his threat, however, because
the committee never asked Presser whether he was an informant.
   Presser was known to the FBI by the code name ``All Pro,''
according to documents. He was valued as an informant to the
government because of his knowledge of underworld attempts to
control the Teamsters.
   Revell, discussing the period after Presser's election, said the
union chief ``continued to contact our agents, which we did not
discourage, with information, but it's on a self-initiated basis.''
   The document containing the Revell interview was filed by Paul
J. Cambria, a Buffalo lawyer representing Harold Friedman,
president of Teamsters Local 507 in Cleveland and a co-defendant
with Anthony Hughes, the local's recording secretary, on federal
racketeering and embezzlement charges.
   Presser also had been indicted on such charges in connection
with an alleged $700,000 payroll-padding scheme at Local 507. The
government dropped the same charges against Presser after he died
early last month.

   ``The enormous problems that country has of getting rid of
apartheid will not be helped by a comfortable luncheon ... in a
five-star hotel deciding there should be poverty and starvation on
the part of a large number of black people,'' she said in Canberra,
Australia.
   She said big foreign companies were helping to break down
apartheid by building racially integrated housing and paying
employees on merit.
   Also at the meeting, the foreign ministers of Canada, Australia,
Guyana, India, Nigeria, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe discussed a
report on South Africa's international financial links, reviewed
the effect of sanctions and examined the poorly enforced arms
embargo against Pretoria.
   The finance report said the refusal of major world banks to loan
new funds to South Africa has had the biggest effect.
   It also spelled out possible new sanctions the Commonwealth
could adopt, including a boycott of all banks making new loans to
South Africa, an international ban on export credit insurance
guarantees and restrictions on trade credits.
   Any recommendations from the group must go to the entire
Commonwealth, which meets again in Malaysia next year.
   In Pretoria, South Africa, Canadian Ambassador Robert Maclean
was summoned to the Foreign Ministry and told the activities
amounted to ``blatant interference in the internal affairs of South
Africa.''
   But Clark told reporters ``it's perfectly proper for us to be
involved in the sponsorship of a forum.''
   Three Canadian anti-apartheid groups issued a statement urging
the government to sever diplomatic and economic links with South
Africa and aid the African National Congress, the banned group
fighting the white-dominated government in South Africa.
   Under apartheid, South Africa's 5 million whites control the
economy and government and live apart from the 26 million blacks,
who have no vote in national affairs.

   Soviet inspectors today will visit current or
former missile facilities in Oklahoma, Maryland and Florida as part
of the procedure set up to verify arms reductions required under a
new U.S.-Soviet treaty, a Pentagon official said.
   Cmdr. Kendall Pease, spokesman for the U.S. On-Site Inspection
Agency set up under the treaty, said the Soviets notified U.S.
officials early today they would visit facilities at Cape
Canaveral, Fla.; Lawton, Okla.; and Middle River, Md.
   Three teams of 10 Soviet inspectors were expected to leave the
Washington area at midmorning for inspections of up to 24 hours
that could be extended by an additional eight hours if both sides
agree, Pease said.
   The Soviets were to notify the Pentagon later today of a fourth
inspection site. The Redstone Arsenal at Huntsville, Ala., was the
only other site available under the treaty, Pease said.
   Pease said the inspection teams, which arrived in Washington on
Monday, are expected to return to Washington on Thursday.
   In Maryland, the inspectors planned to visit a Martin Marietta
plant just outside Baltimore where missile launchers once were
produced. In Florida, they were to visit a former Army and Air
Force missile testing facility. In Oklahoma, the destination was an
Army base where missiles are housed.
   The Soviets completed two rounds of inspections at U.S.
facilities earlier this year.
   The inspections are called for under the Intermediate-range
Nuclear Forces treaty, signed by President Reagan and Soviet leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev at the Washington summit in December. The
treaty calls for the elimination of all intermediate-range missiles
within three years.

<HEAD>Zeffirelli Demands Rescheduling Of Scorsese Film</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Director Franco Zeffirelli said today he will not
present his film ``Young Toscanini'' at the Venice Film Festival
unless the screening of Martin Scorsese's ``The Last Temptation of
Christ'' is rescheduled.
   The two films are due to be shown one day after the other, with
Scorsese's movie coming first on Sept. 7.
   ``I want more distance between the two films,'' he said in a
telephone interview with The Associated Press. ``I don't want to be
caught up in the fights, the storm, the polemics that will follow
the screening of Scorsese's film.
   ``It is a question of scheduling, and I put scheduling as a
condition'' for the presentation of ``Young Toscanini,'' he said.
   Zeffirelli, who directed the television mini-series ``Jesus of
Nazareth'' several years ago, added that his new film might not be
ready for Venice anyway because of ``technical reasons.''
   ``My film is not ready yet and in order to have it completed in
time for presentation at the festival there would have to be great
enthusiasm,'' Zeffirelli said. ``But enthusiasm has grown fainter
because of this recent controversy.''
   Zeffirelli said Scorsese's film is ``damaging to the image of
Christ. ... He cannot be made the object of low fantasies.''
   Scorsese's film also has prompted criticism from the Christian
Democrats, the dominant group in Italy's five-party government
coalition, for the portrayal of Jesus Christ fantasizing about
making love to Mary Magdalene.
   The film has also provoked pickets and protests in the United
States.
   Zeffirelli's ``Young Toscanini'' stars American C. Thomas Howell
as the conductor as a young man. Elizabeth Taylor plays a
supporting role.
   Both films are scheduled to be shown in the ``special events''
division, which is outside the competition category for films
eligible for the Golden Lion award.

<HEAD>Rebel Groups Clash; Hundreds of Casualties Reported</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two Burmese rebel groups battling over
the right to tax smugglers left hundreds killed or wounded in 11
days of fierce fighting near the Thai border, officials said today.
   Two senior Thai provincial officials said the fighting began on
July 23, when hundreds of Karen rebels pounded the Mon rebels at
Ban Chedi, or Pagoda Village, with mortars and rocket-propelled
grenades. They said many civilians were killed or wounded in the
three-hour assault.
   The officials said fighting died down today with both sides
short of ammunition and food, but that about 500 Karen guerrillas
still were besieging about 300 Mon rebels.
   The village is in southeastern Mon State and opposite the Thai
village of Three Pagoda Pass in Kanchanaburi province, about 175
miles northwest of Bangkok.
   The officials, quoting military intelligence reports, spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   The Karen and the Mon are two of about a dozen ethnic minority
groups who have been fighting the Burmese government for four
decades for greater autonomy. Both maintain their strongholds along
Burma's eastern border with Thailand, and both generally have
cooperated with each other, using the same smuggling routes.
   But the fighting erupted after Karen rebels said armed Mon
guerrillas demanded ``protection money'' from Karen civilians who
passed through Mon-controlled areas to engage in illegal trade with
Thai villagers.
   The Mons said the Karens extorted similar taxes from Mon
civilians passing through Karen-controlled areas, the Thai
officials said.
   The officials said fire broke out in the village market during
the July 23 attack, and smoke could be seen from the Thai side of
the border.
   The Karens then got reinforcements from other rebel groups to
try to capture the village, but the Mons fought back, they said.
   The most recent big clash was on Sunday, when the Karens again
attacked with mortars and rocket-propelled grenades, setting the
village market ablaze. The attack lasted 30 minutes, the Thai
officials said.
   Thai intelligence officers who crossed the border after Sunday's
fighting and walked near the besieged village said they smelled the
stench of rotting corpses.
   The provincial officials said one Thai soldier was killed and
another soldier wounded by mortar fire that strayed into Thailand
during the fighting.
   Thai officials said border patrol policemen and soldiers were
dispatched to the frontier to push back hundreds of Burmese
civilians who tried to cross into Thailand to escape the fighting.
About 300 Thais living in the border area have been moved further
away, they said.
   The Mons and the Karens have been fighting Burma since it gained
its independence from Britain in 1948. They contend the government
has reneged on pledges to grant autonomy to ethnic groups.
   Among Burma's 38 million people, there are about 3 million
Karens and 1.3 million Mons. Both are predominately Buddhist,
although the Karen elite is mainly Christian.

<HEAD>Hospitals Say Quality Care To Continue Despite Nurses' Walkout</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CATALINA ORTIZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nurses were flown in from elsewhere in
California and from out of state as officials promised quality care
at six area hospitals despite a strike by about 2,000 registered
nurses.
   ``We feel we are able to operate with some (reductions) but
still are able to offer our range of services,'' said Dr. Kenneth
Hammerman, chief of staff at St. Francis Memorial Hospital.
   The nurses, demanding higher pay and regular raises for veteran
employees, walked off the job Tuesday morning. Ten other hospitals
in San Francisco remain unaffected.
   The six hospitals continued operating, caring for about 900
patients with management employees and temporary nurses, officials
said.
   The hospitals, which negotiated as a group called Affiliated
Hospitals of San Francisco, also transferred some patients,
consolidated some critical-care units and referred some patients
elsewhere.
   Hospital officials declined to say how many nurses were flown
in. California Nurses Association spokeswoman Maureen Anderson
estimated the number at 20 to 30.
   The walkout, which occurred after the nurses rejected a
last-minute, revised offer, was the first widespread strike by
registered nurses here since 1974. No new talks were scheduled.
   Hardest hit was the 61-bed Marshall Hale Hospital in San
Francisco, where the emergency room was closed, operations canceled
and no new patients were being admitted.
   Nurses on the picket lines questioned the qualifications of
temporary workers and the quality of patient care.
   ``Common sense tells me I would not go to an Affiliated Hospital
with nearly 4,000 workers on strike,'' Anderson said.
   Affected hospitals were St. Francis, Marshall Hale, Children's,
Mount Zion and St. Mary's in San Francisco and Seton Medical Center
in Daly City.
   The nurses want an 11 percent raise the first year and 10
percent the second year of a two-year contract. Affiliated
Hospitals late Monday offered 18 percent over 31 months.
   Registered nurses at Affiliated Hospitals earn from about
$31,000 to about $36,000 for day shifts and up to $43,000 a year
for night shifts.

<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration has
ignored a deadline set by the World Court to determine how much the
United States should pay in war reparations to Nicaragua, a court
spokesman said today.
   In what was seen as another snub to the World Court, the
judicial branch of the United Nations, the U.S. government breached
the July 29 deadline to present its position in the case, which it
has been boycotting since 1984.
   ``The time limit ... has lapsed without the receipt of any
communication from the government of the United States,'' the
spokesman said on condition of anonymity.
   He said the court would now consider the next step in the
procedure.
   Nicaragua's ambassador to the Netherlands, who represents his
nation at the World Court, could not be reached for comment. An
embassy spokeswoman told The Associated Press that ``all diplomats
involved in the case are currently on holiday in Managua.'' She
refused to give her name.
   The reparations procedure grew out of a 1986 World Court ruling
ordering the United States immediately to halt all support to the
Contra rebels fighting Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government.
   The ruling followed a 1984 complaint by Managua that the United
States was involved in attempts to overthrow the Nicaraguan
government. The court said Nicaragua was entitled to reparations,
but it did not indicate the amount.
   Instead, it ordered both parties in the dispute to negotiate a
settlement on the issue and said it would intervene only if such
talks failed.
   The Reagan administration, which said in 1984 that the World
Court has no jurisdiction in the dispute, has refused to consider
paying reparations to Nicaragua.
   In November, the court opened proceedings to establish the
amount of reparations Nicaragua would be entitled to. A month
later, John Shad, the U.S. ambassador to the Netherlands, sent a
letter to the court repeating the administration's position that
the court has no authority in the case.
   That letter was the last official communication received by the
court from the U.S. government, the court spokesman said.
   Managua has never stated how much it is seeking in compensation,
but Sandinista officials privately have estimated the economic
damage from the Contra war at $250 million to $300 million.
   Nicaragua's arguments in the reparations case were filed in
March. Under the court's statutes, they are not to be made public
before hearings are held on the issue. It was not immediately clear
whether the court was planning a public procedure.
   The court, officially known as the International Court of
Justice, has no enforcement powers and depends on voluntary
compliance with its rulings.

<TEXT>
   Four million sterilized Mediterranean fruit
flies flooded a 16-square-mile area in the second stage of a
campaign to eradicate the threat to California's $14 billion-a-year
farm industry.
   The male flies, the first of a total of 20 million to be freed
through Friday, were released Tuesday by airplane and from
cardboard buckets by truck.
   The sterile flies, dyed fluorescent pink, will cause the
Medflies to breed themselves out of existence, said Robert Donley,
deputy director of the county Agriculture Commission.
   Last week, the suburban San Fernando Valley area was bombarded
with aerial and ground applications of the pesticide malathion
after six Medflies were found in traps.
   ``If there are any viable flies that emerge they will mate with
sterile flies and there will be no offspring,'' Donley said.
   The sterile flies' pink color is invisible to the eye but shows
up under a special light, Donley said.
   The Medfly lays eggs in more than 250 varieties of fruits and
vegetables. The flies are usually brought in from Hawaii on fruit
carried in by tourists.
   No new flies were found Monday or Tuesday, but inspectors
continued to monitor traps in trees.
   Flies will be released weekly for about two months _ about 20
million each week _ to cover two potential generations of Medflies,
said Donley. The average lifespan of a Medfly is about a month.
   The use of sterile flies helped eradicate a Medfly infestation
last summer in eastern Los Angeles County.
   The San Fernando Valley is about a 100-square-mile area that
includes a number of suburbs northwest of Los Angeles.

<TEXT>
   Israeli soldiers today
demolished or sealed the homes of 12 Palestinians suspected of
firebomb attacks. Hospital officials said five Palestinians were
wounded in protests in the occupied lands.
   Right-wing legislators rallied under heavy military guard and a
blazing sun at Jordan's border with the West Bank, demanding that
Israel annex the West Bank in response to King Hussein's decision
to sever ties with the territory.
   During a private government meeting, Industry Minister Ariel
Sharon called for Israel to apply its law to those parts of the
West Bank populated by Jewish settlers, Israel radio said. Military
law now is in force in the West Bank, which Israel seized from
Jordan in 1967.
   Ten homes were destroyed before dawn and two others were sealed
in Beit Ummar near Hebron and towns near Ramallah. The army said
the homes belonged to Palestinians suspected of hurling at least
half a dozen firebombs at troops or at other Palestinians accused
of collaborating with Israel.
   One family in Beit Ummar was given an hour to pack their clothes
before their home was dynamited at 2 a.m., a resident said.
   ``They forbade us from taking furniture,'' said Kamleh Ismail
Rabai, whose son, Wahid, was jailed 17 days ago.
   As the home exploded, women shouted ``this is for the redemption
of Palestine,'' another witness said.
   Israel has a policy of destroying the homes of suspected
guerrillas to deter attacks. The punishment often is meted out
before the guerrillas have been tried, as was the case early today.
   The army said the suspected guerrillas belonged to a team that
targeted Israeli civilian vehicles, army jeeps and Arabs suspected
of collaborating with Israel.
   The army said some of the suspected firebombers were arrested,
but it did not say how many.
   At the rally, Yuval Neeman of the militant Tehiya Party said:
``Thank you for abandoning your claim here, King Hussein. This is
now the historic moment for Israel to declare sovereignty in this
area.''
   Legislator Geula Cohen also warned that Israelis might seek to
annex portions of Jordan if Hussein ever went to war again with
Israel.
   The legislators said they would meet Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir on Thursday to press their demand. Tehiya and Shamir's
right-wing Likud bloc both believe the West Bank to be inextricable
parts of the historic land of Israel.
   Hussein announced Sunday his decision to break Jordan's ties
with the West Bank. The West Bank and Gaza Strip have been the
scene of a 8-month-old rebellion by Palestinians against Israel
occupation in which 236 Palestinians and four Israelis have been
killed.
   The protest at the main crossing point to Jordan delayed more
than 100 Palestinian travelers for more than 30 minutes.
   In Nablus, the West Bank's largest city, soldiers wounded four
Palestinian youths during a stone-throwing protest, an official at
Al Ittihad Hospital said.
   Soldiers then entered the hospital and tried to detain Taner Abu
Salah, 24, who was shot in the arm, but doctors said he could not
be moved because of his wound, added the official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   A fifth Palestinian, 17-year-old Abed Rabu Jawabreh, was wounded
in the stomach after soldiers opened fire on protesters who hurled
stones and bottles, said an official at Beit Jallah Hospital near
Bethlehem.
   The army said it was checking the reports.
   In Nablus, merchants extended by another day a two-day strike
called to protest the deportations of leaders in the uprising. The
Nablus merchants continued the strike to protest the shooting of
18-year-old Alla Edin Al Aghbar.
   The army said soldiers shot the Palestinian Tuesday as he
prepared to hurl a large cement block on troops from a rooftop.

<HEAD>Mystery Woman Stirs Up Small Town With Plans For NBC Weatherman's
Visit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. MARYS, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Clouds of gloom have rolled into town
following the discovery that a promised week-long visit by NBC
weatherman Willard Scott was a hoax.
   ``It sounded just too good to be true,'' Martha Newsome, head of
the Tourism Council in nearby Kingsland.
   A bookstore had promoted an Aug. 11 cookbook signing by Scott,
the rotund, pun-wielding weatherman of the ``Today'' show. A
bed-and-breakfast inn had reserved its best room for Scott and made
space for him to broadcast weather reports from Aug. 8 through Aug.
12. Nearly everyone in St. Marys knew of the visit.
   Willard-mania began last week when Ms. Newsome was contacted by
a woman who identified herself as an NBC coordinator sent to make
arrangements for Scott and a network film crew to visit this
coastal town of about 3,600 just north of the Florida line.
   Ms. Newsome said she spent a few days with the woman last week
showing her around and helping arrange accommodations for Scott.
During a Rotary Club meeting on Friday, it was announced Scott was
coming to town, she said.
   Ms. Newsome said she became suspicious when the woman asked her
to arrange for cars to be donated for NBC executives to use while
in St. Marys, she felt that plans for a 30-minute news special on
the area seemed a bit extravagant.
   NBC officials in New York told Ms. Newsome they never heard of
the woman and advised her to call police.
   Kathy Graham, an NBC spokeswoman in New York, said Scott is
broadcasting the weather next week from New York as usual.
   The woman, who checked into the Ramada Inn in Kingsland on July
22, had left her room Tuesday.
   ``I don't know where she went. She didn't have a vehicle,'' said
manager Mark Torres. ``She believes that she's for real. I'm sure
it's let a lot of people down this week.''

   A Bulgarian airliner crashed into a river
while trying to take off from an airport in Sofia, and at least 23
people were killed, including a Soviet diplomat, Bulgarian news
media said today.
   The YAK-40 propeller-driven plane of the state Balkan Airlines
crashed Tuesday while leaving the Bulgarian capital on a flight to
Varna on the Black Sea, the official Bulgarian news agency BTA said.
   The agency said a consul at the Soviet consulate general in
Varna and two Yugoslavs were among the dead. It identified the
Soviet as Yuri Evgeniyevich Cheryomin, 38.
   The Yugoslavs were identified as Momirka Radka Mitrovic, 21, and
her 1-year-old daughter, Maria. There were 33 passengers and four
crew members on board, the reports said.
   Diplomatic sources, reached by telephone from Vienna, said the
official Communist Party daily Rabotnichesko Delo reported that the
plane failed to take off, rolled off the runway and crashed into
the Iskar River about a mile east of the airport. They said the
cause of the accident was not known.
   The newspaper said 12 people were hospitalized.
   The agency said 14 people were hospitalized and the rest of the
37 people on board were killed.
   The newspaper report indicated two more people may have died
later, which would raise the total killed to 25.
   It was believed to be the worst Bulgarian air disaster since the
crash of a TU-134 aircraft of the Bulgarian airline in January
1984. All 50 people on board were killed when it crashed on landing
at Sofia airport after a flight from East Berlin.
   In March 1978, a Balkan aircraft en route from Sofia to Warsaw
crashed and killed 73 people.

<TEXT>
   Scientists at Sandia National
Laboratories say they have trained unruly electrons to go straight
for more than 50 yards in experiments to see if the beams may be
used as ``Star Wars'' missile-killers.
   The experiments were conducted in a 184-foot tube that simulates
conditions in the upper atmosphere, the scientists said in today's
Albuquerque Journal.
   Scientists said it is the first time they have gotten
2-million-electron-volt beams to travel that far.
   Electron beams can become unstable and whip around violently as
their negative charges repel each other when they emerge from a
particle accelerator.
   If they could travel in a straight line for long distances, they
might be used to disable incoming warheads or differentiate between
warheads and decoys as part of the Strategic Defense Initiative, or
Star Wars, said James Rice, manager of directed energy research at
Sandia.
   Training the direction of the electron beams has involved using
a channel of hot, electrically charged plasma gas, which acts as a
kind of wire to carry the beam's current, scientists said.
   Rice said electron beams can penetrate deep into a target,
deposit their energy and produce X-rays. Analyzing the amount and
type of X-rays yielded by a target could help differentiate between
a warhead and a decoy, he said.
   Other applications for such beams would include high-speed X-ray
photography, welding, studying the effects of rapid heating and
simulating the effects of nuclear bursts, the scientists said.

   Two cars of a train carrying 55
passengers slid off mud-covered tracks today after heavy rains,
killing at least four people and injuring 13, a government official
said.
   The accident occurred at about 12:35 p.m. about 22 miles east of
Oviedo, the capital of the northern region of Asturias, according
to the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Rescue teams recovered three bodies from the wreckage and a
fourth person died en route to the hospital in Oviedo, said a

   She said 13 people were hospitalized for bruises, including one
foreigner.
   The exact cause of the accident was not known, she said, but
heavy rains that covered the rails with mud may have been
responsible.
   The train was en route to Oviedo from the northern coastal city
of Santander, about 100 miles west.

<HEAD>Teen-ager Says She Was Turned Away Because of Pink and Purple Hair</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTA ANA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Beverly Hills teen-ager told a judge
she was barred from Disneyland because her hair was pink and purple.
   ``They don't know what the person's like. It's just not fair,''
Tonya Slobod said Tuesday.
   Superior Court Judge Tully Seymour, after the non-jury trial,
did not immediately rule on her request to find that her civil
rights were violated.
   Miss Slobod wants him to impose a maximum $250 fine under state
civil rights law plus $2,200 in legal fees and unspecified punitive
damages.
   Miss Slobod said she was 14 in 1986 when she was treated to a
trip to the theme park by her grandmother, Gladys Egelko. She said
a security guard stopped her at a turnstile.
   ``He said, `Well, your hair is multicolored and will detract
from our shows,''' Miss Slobod said. She said employees offered to
let her in if she would cover her head with a cap of some kind. She
said she refused and left.
   James Rettie, security supervisor for the park, confirmed
Disneyland has a policy of excluding guests so garish in appearance
that they detract from shows. But he testified that a guest would
not be excluded on hair color alone.
   Disneyland attorney Richard Claire said that the amusement park
has no record of their visit and that even if they did come to the
Anaheim park, Disneyland employees must have behaved legally in
barring Miss Slobod.
   Ms. Egelko produced Disneyland parking stubs as evidence that
the girl visited the park.
   The teen-ager since has abandoned exotic tints in favor of her
hair's natural brown.

<HEAD>Man Becomes First to Swim From Albany to Statue of Liberty</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An environmental investigator who wanted to call
attention to cleanup efforts in New York's waterways today became
the first person to complete a 153-mile swim from Albany to the
Statue of Liberty.
   Skip Storch, 31, of Monsey, was pulled out of the water at the
statue at 7:30 a.m., about three hours sooner than expected, said
his sister, Nancy Zrake. The swim took 54 hours and 50 minutes.
   He began the final 10-mile leg of the swim at 4 a.m. after
spending the night in Edgewater, N.J., near the George Washington
Bridge, she said.
   Storch, who tests water for the tri-state Interstate Sanitation
Commission, jumped into the Hudson River in Albany at 5:28 a.m.
Thursday.
   ``This effort is to let people know that New York state has done
a great job of protecting its rivers for the future,'' he said. ``I
want this to be an eyebrow-raising event.''
   Ms. Zrake said Storch was treated Monday for two ear infections
and was taking other antibiotics to protect him from the pollution
in the river.
   ``It (the Hudson River) tasted just great,'' he proclaimed today
after completing the swim.
   In 1937, Charles Zimmy came close to completing the
Albany-Liberty swim. He made it down the Hudson River to uptown
Manhattan before he became exhausted. The statue is off the
southern tip of Manhattan in New York Harbor.

   Two freight trains collided head on 16
minutes before one was scheduled to leave its yard, according to
investigators. The fiery crash killed two crewmen and forced
evacuation of 2,000 residents.
   Iowa Interstate Railroad also told investigators that two
tankers containing 20,000 gallons of denatured alchool each should
have been at the end of the westbound train that burst into flames
after the crash near Altoona on Saturday. The tankers were the
second and third cars.
   Edward Dobranetski of the National Transportation Safety Board
declined to speculate whether the correct placement of the two
tankers would have prevented a fire.
   Surviving crew members from the eastbound train said they
believed they left the Altoona switching yard early, said Edward
Dobranetski of the National Transportation Safety Board.
   The crash occurred at 11:45 a.m., while the train had been
ordered by the company to stay in the yard until 12:01 p.m.,
Dobranetski said.
   However, he said, investigators are trying to determine whether
the train had actually left the yard because there were no signs
defining its limits.
   Federal investigators plan to conclude their on-site
investigation Friday by determining the distance between the trains
when they spotted one another.
   The investigator said urine and blood tests to determine whether
crew members used drugs or alcohol will be completed in several
weeks.
   Residents were allowed to return home Monday after workers
allowed the alcohol to burn off. The tracks were reopened Tuesday.

   Investigators are checking whether a rare Greek
statue bought by the J. Paul Getty Museum was taken from an illegal
archeological dig in Sicily, an Interpol official said today.
   Gordon Henley, director of the international art theft unit for
Interpol, said Italian authorities notified the Paris-based
international police agency on Tuesday that they were looking into
the origin of the statue, on display since last week at the museum
in Malibu, Calif.
   Henley said the Italian investigators reported in a cable that
they believe the 7-foot-6-inch statue, dating from the 5th century
B.C., was ``probably obtained from an illegal excavation in
Morgantina, Agrigento, Sicily.''
   In Rome, a senior official of the special Carabinieri art theft
squad today said the team has been investigating the origin of the
statue for a month.
   The probe was requested by Graziella Fiorentini, the
government's director of cultural affairs in Agrigento, said the
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Miss Fiorentini
could not immediately be reached for comment.
   ``The Carabinieri are investigating all over Italy, and Interpol
is investigating too, in order to find out who sold the statue to
the Getty Museum,'' said the official. ``Once the Carabinieri
discover something, magistrates will be immediately informed.''
   Interpol's role is limited to waiting for Italian police to
confirm their belief that the statue was stolen, then relaying the
information to police in the United States, Henley said.
   The statue, believed to represent Nike, Aphrodite or Hera, was
described last week when it was put on display as the only such
full-size figure to have survived intact and the most remarkable
ancient sculpture to appear on the art market in years.
   The Getty Museum declined to say from whom it bought the work or
how much it paid, but said it tried to determine whether either
Italy or Greece had a claim to the statue.
   Henley said Interpol first became involved last week when it was
tipped by Connoisseur Magazine, whose editor-in-chief, Thomas
Hoving, was investigating the Getty acquisition.
   
   In a copyright story Tuesday, the International Herald-Tribune
reported that Miss Fiorentini told Connoisseur she sent the Getty
Museum telegrams warning that she thought the statue was stolen.
   
   ``I have no concrete evidence the piece came from our site,''
Miss Fiorentini was quoted as saying. ``But I couldn't rule it out,
either. Above all, I did not want to say anything that could be
remotely construed as approval or consent.''
   The Herald-Tribune said Miss Fiorentini spoke to Connoisseur on
Saturday, and that the magazine made available its findings, to be
published in full in a series beginning with the October issue.
   The newspaper quoted Getty Museum spokeswoman Lori Starr as
saying the report came as a surprise.
   ``We made formal inquiries a year ago about the history of the
statue with the ministry in Rome via our lawyer there,'' she was
quoted as saying. ``This is something we're just going to have to
look into.''
   The newspaper quoted Ms. Starr as saying Getty policy was to
return an item to the country of origin if a valid legal claim is
established.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Phil Gramm said today he will give the
nominating speech for George Bush at the Republican National
Convention, underscoring the importance of Texas in the November
election.
   Gramm said he would talk about what the country and world were
like ``that cold day in January when Ronald Reagan and George Bush
took the oath of office, their proud record and what they've
achieved.''
   Gramm was a Democratic representative when Reagan and Bush took
office in 1981. He resigned his seat in 1983, then immediately won
it back as a Republican. He was elected to the Senate the next year.
   The junior senator from Texas said he would also compare the
record of Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis with Bush
and would speak of the vice president's ``lifetime of service,
Bush's vision of America.''
   Texans also played key roles in the Democratic National
Convention in Atlanta last month, with state Treasurer Ann Richards
giving the keynote address and former Rep. Barbara Jordan seconding
the nomination of the state's senior senator, Lloyd Bentsen, for
vice president.
   Gramm was orginally scheduled to give a prime-time address with
Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole during the convention, and the two
were to have compared Democratic and Republican positions on a wide
range of issues.
   ``My role has been upgraded since then,'' Gramm said today.
``The vice president called me yesterday and asked me to give the
nominating speech. Obviously, I was very honored to be asked. It's
a great opportunity. I believe in George Bush. I believe he's the
greatest vice president we've ever had.
   Gramm said he was on a trip to the Soviet Union during the
Democratic National Convention and missed Arkansas Gov. Bill
Clinton's lengthy nominating speech for Dukakis.
   ``I wanted to see what the Democratic plank would be like if it
were fulfilled so I was looking at the Soviet economy,'' Gramm said.
   Gramm said he has no doubt the Republicans will carry Texas with
its 29 electoral votes.
   His fellow Texas senator would not agree, he said, ``but he has
a vested interest and I don't.''

   Manslaughter and drunken driving charges
have been filed against a man in the weekend crash that killed
former ``Hill Street Blues'' actor Trinidad Silva Jr.
   Douglas Robert Owens, 35, of La Habra, was charged with felony
vehicular manslaughter, felony hit-and-run driving and two felony
counts of driving under the influence of alcohol, Deputy District
Attorney Dinko Bozanich said Tuesday.
   Owens faces up to 12 years in prison if convicted on all counts.
   He has been jailed on $5,000 bail since the crash Sunday.
   Police said Owens' car ran a light and broadsided Silva's pickup
truck. The 38-year-old actor, who wasn't wearing a seatbelt, was
hurled through the windshield and died of head injuries.
   Silva played the wisecracking gang leader Jesus Martinez in the
NBC series ``Hill Street Blues.'' He won critical praise for his
portrayal of an aging gang member in the movie ``Colors'' earlier
this year.
   Silva's 2-year-old son, Samuel, and wife, Sofia, 28, suffered
minor injuries in the accident.

   The Burmese government today imposed
martial law on the capital of Rangoon after thousands of masked
students marched through downtown shouting slogans denouncing
leader Sein Lwin, diplomats said.
   Burma's official Radio Rangoon announced that the city was
placed under judicial control of the military at 1 p.m. ``to permit
those students who would like to study peacefully to do so.''
   The decree did not mention whether a curfew had been imposed on
Rangoon's 3.5 million residents. It said martial law would ``cease
when the Council of State so declares.''
   The decree, signed by President Sein Lwin, said that from July
28 until Tuesday, students had demonstrated and distributed
leaflets at Burma's most sacred shrine, the Shwedagon Pagoda.
   Western diplomats contacted by telephone in Rangoon gave an
eyewitness account of about 3,000 young students marching through
the heart of the city, their faces covered with handkerchiefs,
stockings and other masks to prevent identification by authorities.
   Saffron-robed Buddhist monks and large numbers of workers joined
the students, the diplomats said, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   The diplomats reported no violence or confrontations with
police, unlike bloody riots in March and June. They said police
were not seen today.
   ``They were very well organized, very peaceful,'' one diplomat
said. ``They would form rings around cars so there would be no
damage.''
   The witnesses said most protesters appeared to be in their teens
or to be high school students.
   The declaration of martial law came one week after Sein Lwin,
known for his ruthless suppression of dissidents, assumed power.
Lwin said moral decay and political corruption have caused citizens
to lose faith in the government.
   Sein Lwin was elected president and chairman of the ruling Burma
Socialist Program Party on July 26. Pamphlets circulating in
Rangoon have branded him a ruthless oppressor and called for his
overthrow.
   The official News Agency Burma acknowledged that since July 28,
young people have been rallying at Shwedagon Pagoda to protest
government leaders.
   The agency, in a report made available today, said 100 to 200
teen-agers hoisted the peacock flag _ a symbol of Burma's struggle
against British colonialism _ on the platform surrounding the base
of Shwedagon's central spire.
   The agency urged parents to control their children.
   In October, hundreds rioted when the government took out of
circulation several currency notes without compensation. In recent
years Burma has been plagued by severe inflation, widespead
shortages of goods and even spot food shortages in a country once
regarded as Southeast Asia's most bountiful rice bowl.
   Western diplomats and Burmese sources say Sein Lwin played a key
role in the bloody suppression of student demonstrations in March.
Reliable sources say more than 100 people died, but the official
casualties are given as only 43.
   On Friday, the government rounded up the most outspoken critic
of the system, Aung Gyi, and nine others described as his
associates for ``attacking the state.'' The group included
Associated Press correspondent Sein Win.
   In a letter to Sein Lwin, Associated Press president and general
manager Louis D. Boccardi said the AP was ``deeply concerned'' over
Sein Win's arrest and detention and ``would appreciate further
information and clarification of the charges'' against him.
   Boccardi asked that an AP representative be allowed to visit
Sein Win and expressed hope the family already had that privilege.
   Boccardi said in the letter, dated Tuesday, that the reported
charge of ``attacking the state'' against the correspondent ``does
not comport with our long knowledge of'' Sein Win.
   The 66-year-old former publisher of Rangoon's English-language
daily The Guardian won an international prize in 1963 for fostering
freedom of press in his country. He was jailed for three years in
the 1960s for his journalistic activities.
   He joined the AP shortly after his release from his second
prison term in 1968.

   The Irish Republic Army today
stepped up its campaign against British security forces by gunning
down a part-time soldier as he drove to his civilian job near
Belfast.
   The IRA claimed responsibility in a statement to the news media.
IRA attacks this week alone have killed four people and injured 33.
   On Tuesday, the IRA warned civilians to avoid British soldiers,
the primary target of its battle to end British rule in the
province. Since November, the IRA has killed 17 civilians in
botched attacks.
   In today's assault, a member of the British army's locally
recruited Ulster Defense Regiment, was gunned down in his car as he
slowed to cross a narrow bridge outside Cookstown, 40 miles west of
Belfast, police said.
   He was driving to work at an engineering plant.
   The 31-year-old victim, who was shot several times in the head,
died later in South Tyrone hospital, said a spokesman for the Royal
Ulster Constabulary, the province's police force. The spokesman
demanded anonymity.
   News reports said the guerrillas drove to the ambush point in a
car stolen from a family of five people who were held hostage
overnight.
   On Tuesday, an IRA bomb exploded under a car in a busy shopping
area in Lisburn near Belfast, killing a policeman and injuring 18
bystanders.
   About 20 minutes later, a part-time soldier was killed in front
of his wife and 2-year-old daughter after two IRA gunmen dragged
him from a Belfast store during a family shopping trip.
   Earlier Tuesday, six part-time soldiers in the mainly Protestant
Ulster Defense Regiment, were hurt when an IRA land mine blew up
their Land Rover in the County Tyrone village of Carland.
   Tuesday's attacks came a day after an IRA explosion tore through
a British army postal sorting center in north London, killing one
soldier and injuring nine.
   The mainly Roman Catholic IRA, which claimed responsibility for
the attacks, is fighting to unite this predominantly Protestant
province with the Irish Republic under socialist rule.
   Brian Feeny, a Belfast council member from the moderate Catholic
Social Democratic and Labor Party, called Tuesday's attacks ``an
attempt by the IRA to put right its cock-ups by the tried and
tested method of killing off-duty policemen and (Ulster Defense
Regiment) men who are easy targets.''
   The IRA issued its warning on civilians Tuesday through the
Irish Republican publicity bureau in Dublin, Ireland.
   ``We are issuing this warning because the close presence of
civilians often forces us to abandon operations,'' it said. ``No
one should travel close to or with clearly identified members of
the British forces.''
   The statement said the warning applied throughout Europe.
   British news reports quoted unidentified Irish nationalist
sources in Belfast as saying the warning particularly applies to
civilians who frequent discotheques and pubs used by off-duty
military personnel.
   That aroused fears the guerrillas may be planning attacks
similar to two 1974 pub bombings in and around at London and a 1982
pub bombing near Londonderry, Northern Ireland's second-largest
city.
   The three bombings killed 15 soldiers and nine civilians and
injured about 150 people. The IRA claimed responsibility for the
1974 bombings. The Irish National Liberation Army, a Marxist
offshoot of the IRA, said it staged the 1982 attack.
   Monday's blast was the first fatal attack in mainland Britain
since IRA guerrillas blew up Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's
hotel during a political convention in October 1984. She narrowly
escaped injury, but five people were killed.
   It was the fifth IRA attack since May on British military
targets outside Northern Ireland. Three British servicemen have
been killed and 12 other people injured in four machine gun and
bombing attacks in West Germany and the Netherlands.
   On March 6, British commandos shot and killed three unarmed IRA
guerrillas in Gibraltar.
   The 17 accidental civilian deaths forced the IRA to issue a
series of embarrassing apologies to relatives of the victims, two
of whom were from an IRA stronghold in west Belfast.

<TEXT>
   The government said today it will close
the U.S. Air Force base near the Greek capital when a defense
agreement between Greece and the United States expires at the end
of the year.
   Government spokesman Sotiris Kostopoulos told a news briefing
that ``one of the decisions reached by the Greek government is the
abolition of Ellinikon Air Base.''
   Ellinikon Air Base is one of four major military installations
the United States operates in Greece. It is 10 miles from Athens.
   The U.S. Embassy refused comment.
   On Tuesday, a ranking government official said the Ellinikon
base would either be closed or stay as it is, ruling out its
transfer or merger with another American base on the southern Greek
island of Crete. He spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Ellinikon is a support base used by reconnaisance planes to
monitor Soviet fleet movements in the Mediterranean Sea.
   Negotiations for a new defense and cooperation agreement to
replace the existing accord are scheduled to resume Sept.9. The
current treaty expires Dec. 31.
   The Greek government issued a formal shutdown notice on July 13
for all U.S. bases operating in Greece, but it does not necessarily
mean that all the installations will stop operating.
   If Greek and American officials are unable to reach agreement,
the present accord gives the United States 17 months to dismantle
their bases when it expires.
   The official at the briefing Tuesday conceded that there have
been differences of opinion during the negotiations. He said Greece
``wants to safeguard its paramount national interests. This
however, does not mean guarantees for its eastern borders (with
Turkey) but some guarantees on the question of balance of forces.''
   Congress maintains a 7-to-10 rato in military assistance to
Greece and Turkey. The Greeks receive $7 for every $10 given to
Turkey.
   Greece and Turkey have longstanding differences, despite being
members of the Western Alliance. Disputes between the two countries
range from claims to mineral seabed rights in the Aegean to Cyprus,
the divided Mediterranean island republic.

   Cuba today rejected as ``preposterous and
unrealistic'' a South African proposal for ending the 13-year-old
Angolan War that envisaged a cease-fire in a week and the
withdrawal of foreign troops in 10 months.
   Cuba faulted the plan for linking a cease-fire in Angola with
independence for neighboring South-West Africa, also known as
Namibia. South Africa rules the territory in defiance of several
U.N. resolutions.
   Angola also criticized the proposal.
   Cuba said the plan forwarded by South Africa on Tuesday was an
``outdated attempt to revive the linkage between the independence
of (South-West Africa) and the Cuban presence in Angola.''
   The ``preposterous and unrealistic proposal of setting
compulsory dates for the withdrawal of Cuban troops from the
territory of Angola is not in keeping with the actions that have
recently taken place on the terrain,'' it said.
   That was a reference to the reported standoff in fighting that
pits Cuban and Angolan forces against anti-communist rebels and
South African troops.
   However, the statement said Cuba and Angola will continue talks
with South Africa on a peace settlement, the latest round of which
began in Geneva on Tuesday.
   An Angolan statement said the proposals did ``not reflect the
spirit of prior agreements'' and vowed that Angola ``will not
negotiate away its sovereignty and independence.''
   The statement, read in Portuguese by Deputy Foreign Minister
Venancio de Moura and translated into English by an interpreter,
said the South African announcement ``violated the principle of
confidentiality'' and ``could disturb the climate of the
negotiations.'' Confidentiality, it said, had been agreed on
previously by all sides.
   The South African proposal, unveiled by Foreign Minister Pik
Botha in Pretoria, broke a news embargo requested by Assistant
Secretary of State Chester Crocker, who is chairing the
negotiations.
   The Cuban statement said Botha's public announcement of the
proposals ``violates the principles that have governed the previous
rounds'' of ``always preserving the complex details of this
negotiation process.''
   But it said that ``Angola and Cuba ... will maintain a serious
and responsible conduct of the talks. The joint Cuban-Angolan
delegation will not be the one to cause their disruption.''
   South Africa's proposal marked the first time it has offered a
specific date for granting independence to South-West Africa and
was seen as a major development in efforts to resolve the war in
Angola.
   It calls for an Aug. 10 cease-fire in Angola. Botha said that if
the truce is accepted, South Africa would withdraw its estimated
3,000 troops from southern Angola by Sept. 1.
   On Nov. 1, South Africa would begin withdrawing from Namibia
under a U.N. resolution that calls for the territory's independence.
   Botha said elections would be held in Namibia on June 1,
provided Cuba has withdrawn its estimated 50,000 troops from Angola
by the same date.
   Cuban troops are in Angola supporting the country's Marxist
government. South Africa and the United States support the rebels
of the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, or
UNITA.
   The South African proposal calls for the cease-fire to be
monitored by committees established at the current Geneva talks.
Botha did not specify who would do the monitoring. In the past, he
has proposed a U.N. presence.
   Botha said if a cease-fire begins Aug. 10, it would give U.N.
officials almost three months to prepare for South Africa's
withdrawal from Namibia.
   Cuba and Angola have suggested a four-year timetable for the
Cuban withdrawal. South Africa and the United States are seeking a
much shorter time period.
   South Africa's mandate over Namibia was terminated by the United
Nations in 1966, but it has retained control of the country, which
possesses considerable mineral wealth.
   Among other issues addressed by the South African proposal are:
   _ The South-West Africa People's Organization, whose guerrillas
have been fighting for independence for 22 years. South Africa says
they must stop raids into South-West Africa from their bases in
southern Angola.
   _ African National Congress bases in Angola, which South Africa
wants closed. The Pretoria government says the group has seven
major bases in Angola.
   _ Financial assistance for Namibia. South Africa spends billions
of dollars annually on South-West Africa. It is looking for someone
else to help the territory pay its bills and has suggested the five
permanent members of the U.N. Security Council.
   The plan does not mention UNITA. The group's leader, Jonas
Savimbi, wants a power-sharing accord with the Angolan government,
but the country's Marxist leaders have so far refused to negotiate
with the guerrilla movement.
   The Geneva talks, scheduled through Thursday, are the fifth
round of negotiations that began in May.
   Participants agreed last month on a basic set of 14 principles
that would lead to the withdrawal of all foreign forces from Angola
and the granting of independence to Namibia. No timetable was
agreed upon.

   A federal judge suggested Gov. Mario Cuomo
remove members of Yonkers' City Council for voting down a
court-ordered housing desegregation plan, and a state board today
considered whether to take over the city's finances.
   U.S. District Judge Leonard Sand found the city and three
council members in contempt Tuesday and slapped the city with a
$100 fine that will double daily. The city's $337 million budget
would be wiped out by the 22nd day.
   A meeting of the Yonkers Financial Control Board was called for
this afternoon to prepare for another session on Thursday. The
board, appointed by Cuomo to oversee spending when Yonkers faced
bankruptcy four years ago, can take over the power to disburse
funds.
   ``We want Yonkers to work itself out of its problems,'' said
Bill Brown, spokesman for Secretary of State Gail Shaffer, who
heads the board. ``We'd rather that there be no control board at
all. But obviously this (the court decision) changes things
immensely.''
   Sand on Tuesday noted that the governor has the power to remove
elected officials for misconduct and malfeasance.
   ``When a city of almost 200,000 totters on the brink of
bankruptcy, makes itself a symbol of defiance to a federal court
and acts in a manner so devastatingly adverse to the interest of
its citizens,'' it is the state's responsibility to intervene, the
judge said.
   Tom Conroy, a spokesman for the governor, said that Cuomo's
office was monitoring the situation. Earlier, Cuomo had refused a
request from city officials to intervene on the city's behalf,
saying such action would be inappropriate.
   Brown said Shaffer has been in ``constant touch'' with Cuomo
aides about the situation.
   The desegregation plan was defeated 4-3. Three council members
who voted against the plan were fined $500 a day. The fourth had
his contempt proceeding delayed because he had no lawyer.
   Council members who refuse to endorse the plan face jail Aug. 11
unless they change their stand.
   Sand's action comes after two years of repeated threats against
the state's fourth-largest city for its failure to build low-income
and affordable housing. In 1985, the judge found the city liable
for intentionally segregating housing and schools over a 40-year
period.
   The precipitating action came Monday night when the City Council
refused to endorse a package of bonuses, financial incentives and
zoning variances to attract developers to build 800 units of
affordable housing throughout the city.
   The vote came after Sand warned the council that failure to pass
the resolution would result in fines and possible imprisonment.
Only those council members voting against the resolution were
subject to contempt.
   The fines against the city will be deposited into the U.S.
Treasury rather than in a separate account, meaning the fines will
be non-refundable, Sand said.

   A senior PLO official said today that the
United States and Britain are in contact with Iran in efforts to
release Westerners held hostage by pro-Iranian groups in Lebanon.
   The United States denied it.
   ``There are American-British-Iranian contacts under way for
release of the hostages,'' said the PLO official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity. The PLO has been informally allied in
Lebanon with the pro-Iranian Hezbollah militia.
   Hezbollah is believed to be an umbrella group for extremists
holding most of the 18 foreigners missing in Lebanon. The hostages
include nine Americans. The PLO official said he did not know where
the contacts were supposed to be taking place.
   ``I think this time it's serious because Iran is trying to win
over these Western powers by creating an impression it's not Iran
that's hardline, it's Iraq,'' he said in an interview with The
Associated Press.
   Iran and Iraq are trying to negotiate a cease-fire in their war.
The talks were deadlocked over Iraq's demand for direct talks.
   In Washington, a State Department official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, said the report was ``false.'' ``There are
no direct contacts between the United States and Iran,'' he said.
   In the past, U.S. and British officials have denied similar
reports about negotiations with Iran on the hostages.
   In Beirut, the conservative daily Al-Anwar reported today that
two British hostages and a West German, all held by pro-Iranian
Shiite Moslem kidnappers, will be released soon. The newspaper
quoted the privately-owned Al-Sohofiah newsletter as saying
``intense efforts have lately reached agreement on arrangements to
set the three hostages free in a short time.''
   The names of the three hostages were not reported. The
newsletter, which has not reported on the hostages before, quoted
unidentified sources.
   Among those missing, Anglican Church envoy Terry Waite and
journalist John McCarthy are both British, and university professor
Brian Keenan holds both British and Irish passports. British
journalist Alec Collett was reported killed in 1986, but no body
was ever found.
   The only West German hostage is businessman Rudolf Cordes.
   The hostage held longest is Terry A. Anderson, 40, chief Middle
East correspondent for The Associated Press. He was kidnapped March
16, 1985.

   A teen-age girl who accused a school
administrator of sexual misconduct days before he committed suicide
did not recant, as her mother had claimed, police said.
   Douglas Tarrant was arrested on a charge of lewd and lascivious
behavior four days before he killed himself July 15 in the garage
of his Clearwater home. He left a videotape saying he was innocent
of the charge.
   The girl's mother said that the 15-year-old told police and
school officials her daughter had changed her story but that no one
told Tarrant. However, a state attorney's report released Monday by
the police disputed that. Police spokesman William Doniel said
newspaper stories ``gave the impression to the public that, `Why
didn't the detective contact the guy and tell him it wasn't true?''
   The state attorney's report ``was a way to ... make people aware
that she did not recant her story,'' Doniel said.
   The report called the girl ``a credible witness who was
straightforward in her responses, had an accurate memory and has no
(conflict of) interest in the outcome of this case.''
   The report also said Tarrant had a history of soliciting
teen-age girls for sexual acts.
   Tarrant was arrested after the girl called police and reported
that Tarrant asked her to get into his car. She said she could see
the man masturbating.
   Family members said that Tarrant probably took his own life
because of depression over severe health problems but that the
arrest added more stress on the Pinellas County school system's
assistant superintendent for finance.
   The mother denied the contention in the report that she
pressured the girl to recant.
   ``I did not pressure that child into changing her story,'' the
woman told the St. Petersburg Times. ``The police frightened her.
They're embarrassed because so many people were notified (the girl
changed her story), and they never told the man.''

   A guard who passed around nude pictures of
an inmate's wife and made disparaging remarks about her body
engaged in conduct that was tasteless but not unconstitutional, a
federal appeals court ruled.
   ``We discern no aggravated abuse of authority ... invasion of
carefully guarded personal modesty ... (or) calculated and
egregious humiliation'' that would amount to a violation of the
right of privacy, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said
Tuesday.
   The court upheld a lower court's dismissal of a civil rights
suit by inmate Ezra Davis and his wife, Mary, against correctional
officer Theodore Bucher.
   The four pictures were found in an envelope in an inventory of
Davis' possessions in 1983 during a prison transfer in Washington
state. Bucher showed the photos to at least two other prisoners,
the court said.
   In 1984, in a conversation with a desk sergeant, Bucher
described the photo incident, ``adding gratuitous derogatory
comments about Mary Davis' anatomy'' that were overheard by at
least one other guard and an inmate, the court said.
   ``Bucher's conduct was tasteless, unwise and unwarranted'' but
was not ``the type of governmental abuse which demands a
constitutional response,'' the appeals court said.
   The court also noted that Davis had brought the pictures into
prison, where privacy protections are generally recognized to be
reduced.

   A brief moment of change in a Burma, a
country beset by a quarter century of authoritarian rule, appears
to have shattered with the emergence of a leader even more
hard-line than his predecessor, analysts say.
   Western diplomats, academics and Burmese emigres fear that the
already troubled Southeast Asian nation could more face civil
disorder in reaction to retired army general Sein Lwin's taking the
reins of power from Ne Win.
   The Burmese government today imposed martial law on the capital,
Rangoon. Diplomats said the order came after thousands of masked
students marched through downtown shouting slogans denouncing Sein
Lwin.
   A few days after Sein Lwin emerged as Burma's president and
ruling party chairman, authorities arrested Burma's most respected
dissident, Aung Gyi, and other potential leaders around whom
mounting opposition could have rallied.
   Leaflets have been circulating in Rangoon calling for Sein
Lwin's overthrow.
   Almost daily, peaceful demonstrations are being held by students
and some monks at the Shwedagon Pagoda, Burma's holiest shrine and
a traditional center for political protest.
   Today, saffron-robed Buddhist monks and large numbers of workers
joined students in the downtown demonstration, said Western
diplomats in Rangoon.
   Virtually the only optimistic note sounded by analysts is that
the new leaders will attempt some economic reforms while trying to
keep a lid on dissent that has boiled over into bloody street riots
three times since October.
   The short-lived expectations of change were sparked July 23 when
Ne Win, who had wielded power since seizing it in a coup 26 years
ago, resigned as chairman of the Burma Socialist Program Party.
   He also called for a referendum that could have replaced
one-party rule with a multi-party system. A special party congress
subsequently was held and proposals for major economic reforms were
debated.
   But just three days later _ and for reasons still unclear _ the
77-year-old chairman was replaced by Sein Lwin, who is widely held
responsible for ruthlessly suppressing student demonstrations in
March.
   The referendum was also turned down.
   Only the economic reform package remained, but some analysts
express skepticism about how far and how effectively it can be
implemented.
   ``I don't see any prospect for progress, but rather for
resistance, violence,'' says Robert Nathan, a Washington-based
economist who follows Burmese developments.
   ``In a place where there hadn't been any hope for change,
expectations were suddenly raised. Now, that's been dashed, down
the drain.''
   Whatever the changes at the top, the country is still run
day-to-day by several hundred active duty or retired military
officers, a group that over the past quarter century has turned
perhaps Southeast Asia's potentially richest nation into one with a
per capita income of less than $200.
   With little economic expertise at senior echelons, there is
skepticism whether the wide-ranging and complex economic reforms
proposed can be pushed through even if genuine political will
exists.
   The economic package includes allowing private foreign
investment for the first time since 1962 and sweeping privatization
of sectors previously controlled by the state.
   The slumping economy appears to have been a key fuel to tensions
and disillusionment widely expressed by people in Rangoon and
elsewhere.
   But some analysts also see recent changes as having heightened
the potential for internal discord.
   John Badgely, a Burma expert at Cornell University, said in an
interview that a past pattern is being duplicated: Ne Win perhaps
allowing a potential rival to rise only so high before cutting him
off.
   The American professor said Ne Win has opted for support from
more reform-minded military officers and those who have benefited
from the limited economic reforms he instituted last year, while
Sein Lwin represents the conservative old guard.
   Badgely foresees a possible confrontation between the two men if
Sein Lwin strikes out too far on his own.
   Others, however, believe an ailing and old Ne Win has simply
lost control of the situation and Sein Lwin has staged a kind of
coup against his former commander.
   Still others note that close bonds between the two go back to
the early 1940s, when the poorly educated Sein Lwin joined Ne Win's
outfit, the Fourth Burma Rifles, as a private.
   Sein Lwin served Ne Win as a personal aide and later as a
commander, when an iron fist was required. In 1962, the year Ne Win
seized power, Sein Lwin headed troops that put down a campus riot
in a hail of bullets.
   These analysts view recent events as a well-orchestrated plot by
the two in which the secretive Ne Win will now play a
behind-the-scenes role.

   Detroit voters dealt Mayor Coleman Young a losing hand by
rejecting his dream of casino gambling, while Missourians bailed
out their struggling lottery by raising the jackpot limit.
   In other results of primaries in three states Tuesday, Missouri
Democrats gave state Rep. Betty Hearnes, who once lived in the
governor's mansion as first lady, a shot at returning there as
chief executive. They also endorsed Rep. Richard Gephardt's
last-minute bid for a seventh term and sent farm activist Wayne
Cryts into a rematch with Republican Rep. Bill Emerson.
   Michigan Republicans, choosing between two millionaire
ex-congressmen, picked Jim Dunn to challenge liberal Democratic
Sen. Donald Riegle.
   Kansas had one congressional incumbent facing a challenge _ GOP
Rep. Jan Meyers, who tallied 85 percent of the 3rd District vote
against Charles B. ``Bat'' Masterson, a retired school adminstrator.
   The Detroit vote marked the third time in 12 years that Young,
who is expected to seek re-election next year, has seen his plan to
boost the local economy by building hotel-casinos set back at the
polls.
   With all precincts reporting, the ordinance outlawing casinos
was approved 82,271 to 50,890, or 62 percent to 38 percent,
according to unofficial returns.
   ``This is sending a message to the administration that we are
the ones in charge here, not he,'' said the Rev. Keith Butler, of
the Alliance Against Casino Gambling.
   But Frank Stella, a member of the mayoral study commission that
recommended casinos, blamed the defeat on poor organization and
said: ``Casino gaming is going to come to Detroit sooner or later.''
   The measure puts an ordinance on the books that would ban
casinos from Detroit even should the Legislature someday legalize
gambling in the state. However, it is not clear whether that
ordinance could withstand a court challenge as an unconstitutional
attempt by a city to supersede state law.
   Supporters of the Missouri amendment called it crucial to the
future of the 2{-year-old lottery, which had been suffering because
of competition from surrounding states.
   Previously, exactly 45 percent of sales money had to go to
prizes, 45 percent to the state and 10 percent to administrative
costs. Now a minimum of 45 percent must go for prizes, and
officials say they want give away about 50 percent and also spend
more on advertising.
   With 96 percent of precincts reporting, 455,068 voters, or 57
percent, had voted in favor and 337,182, or 43 percent, voted
against the amendment.
   Mrs. Hearnes, 61, whose husband, Warren, was governor from
1965-73, will attempt to become Missouri's first woman governor by
unseating Republican Gov. John Ashcroft, who did not face a primary.
   ``You'll see it start to heat up between now and November,''
Mrs. Hearnes said in claiming victory. ``Now when Ashcroft flies
around the state, he can't get away with saying he's not
campaigning.''
   With 97 percent of precincts reporting, Mrs. Hearnes had 368,390
votes, or 81 percent, and Lavoy ``Zaki'' Reed, a St. Louis-area
teacher, had 84,123 votes, or 19 percent.
   Gephardt, who abandoned his bid for the presidential nomination
just in time to file for re-election, piled up 82 percent of the
vote against three little-known Democrats. He will face Thor
Hearne, a former Education Department official who won the GOP
primary.
   Cryts, who became a folk hero in 1981 when he took his family's
soybeans from a padlocked, bankrupt grain elevator, also swamped
three opponents, and said he would waste no time opening his
campaign against Emerson, who narrowly beat him in 1986.
   ``We're going to be starting out early in the morning shaking
hands ... we are taking nothing for granted,'' Cryts said. ``The
votes are here, but we have to motivate the people.''
   In Michigan, Dunn defeated Robert Huber for a chance to face
Riegle, who had no primary opposition in his bid for a third term.
With all precincts reporting, Dunn had 244,909 votes, or 61
percent, to Huber's 159,616, or 39 percent.
   Huber, who was in Congress in 1973-74, and Dunn, who served from
1981-82, each spent more than $200,000 of their own money. Riegle,
who has not lost an election in 22 years, has $4 million in
campaign funds for the fall.
   Dunn, 44, who ran unsuccessfully for a Senate nomination 1984,
criticized his more conservative opponent in a radio interview last
week for maintaining that AIDS was God's punishment of homosexuals
and drug users.
   ``I don't know whether it's the wrath of God, but if it isn't it
should be,'' Huber said when asked about Dunn's remarks.

   Rebels fired mortars and rifles at a
crowded passenger boat on a remote southeastern river, killing two
people and wounding 27, the government and witnesses said. An
American clergyman was among the wounded.
   About a dozen members of a New York-based religious group were
on board the vessel when it was attacked. The wounded American was
identified as the Rev. Lucius Walker, a Baptist minister from
Demarest, N.J.
   Newspapers today ran banner headlines condemning the attack and
featured pictures of Walker.
   The government also accused the United States of trying to
thwart regional peace efforts through Secretary of State George P.
Shultz' visit to the region this week.
   ``Criminal Attack,'' the Sandinista government newspaper El
Nuevo Diario said. ``There Were Moments Of Terror,'' the Sandinista
National Liberation Front's paper Barricada said, quoting the
clergyman.
   Walker, 57, received stitches after a bullet grazed his buttocks.
   His daughter, Gail Walker, 29 of Patterson, N.J., said in a
telephone interview this morning that her father ``was O.K. He's
well.''
   The Defense Ministry said the passenger boat was attacked at 4
p.m. Tuesday as it traveled upstream on the Escondido River. It was
heading to the town of Rama after leaving the Caribbean port of
Bluefields.
   The ministry said in a communique that the raid occurred near
the village of El Mango, about 150 miles southeast of Managua.
   It said all the victims were civilians, but gave no other
details.
   ``Who is obstructing peace?'' Information Minister Manuel
Espinoza asked in a telephone interview today. ``It shows the
American administration, through the Contras, are continuing the
war.''
   In Miami, Contra spokesman Jorge Rosales said the rebels were
still gathering information on the incident and had no immediate
comment.
   Witnesses said about 200 civilians and several Sandinista
soldiers were aboard.
   ``The boat was crowded with passengers, among them women,
children and adults when it was attacked,'' said Walker.
   The river links the recently built Managua-Rama road with
Bluefields, where Nicaragua receives the bulk of its military
supplies from the Soviet Union, Cuba and other Soviet bloc nations.
   ``I dove down the stairs,'' Ms. Walker said. ``I figured bruises
were better than bullet holes. The bullets came through the walls.''
   Walker is executive director of the Inter-Religious Foundation
for Communication Organizations, an interdenominational group. Ms.
Walker, 29, is its communications programing director.
   ``As Americans we think its barbarous that our government arm
these people (the rebels),'' Walker said as a doctor patched up the
wound on his left buttock.
   Ms. Walker said about 20 Sandinista soldiers were on the top
deck when the attack occurred, but she said most of the Contra fire
was aimed at the section of the vessel where civilians were
standing.
   She said she and her father came to Nicaragua on July 26 with
the religious group, which does not support President Reagan's
Central American policy, ``to find out first hand the actual
situation of the country.
   ``Now we're all in agreement on condemning Contra aid. This was
a civilian boat,'' she added.
   No confirmation or claim of responsibility had surfaced by late
Tuesday from the U.S.-supported Contras, who have tried to cut the
Managua-Bluefields supply link several times.
   In January, they seized several towns and villages along the
Managua-Rama road to stop the supply flow but later retreated.
   Tuesday's attack violates a fragile cease-fire the two sides
agreed to March 23. Negotiations have since failed to forge a
lasting peace in the 7-year-old war, and Reagan is seeking to renew
military aid to the Contras, which Congress cut off in February.
   Meanwhile, the Sandinista newspaper Barricada said Shultz'
meeting in Guatemala Monday with the foreign ministers of Costa
Rica, Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras marked ``a new level of
North American pressure and blackmail aimed at blocking the Central
American peace process.''.
   The United States sought but failed to obtain from the four
nations a statement denouncing Nicaragua on the grounds it has
failed to comply with a peace plan the five Central American
presidents signed one year ago.

   A man killed three people by ramming their

in front of a speeding train, the coroner said.
   The train was traveling 60 mph Tuesday when it struck
42-year-old Michael E. Nelson, scattering body parts up to 150
yards away, said San Joaquin County Deputy Coroner Gerald Krein.
   Nelson had hit a parked car from behind, and both cars burst
into flames, Krein said. The bodies in the car were burned beyond
recognition, according to the California Highway Patrol.
   Nelson got out of his truck, stripped and walked 100 yards into
the path of the train, said Krein.

   Valley News, West Lebanon, N.H., on the U.S. debt to the United
Nations:
   ``Do as we say, not as we do,'' the United States government
seems to be saying to the rest of the world.
   At a time when it is struggling to persuade Third World
governments to honor their commitments by paying off their enormous
debts, the American government is playing the role of deadbeat in
the most prominent international forum, the United Nations.
   At this point, the government owes the United Nations $467.4
million in dues.
   The withholding of that money has caused such a cash crunch that
U.S. officials fear there won't be enough money to keep the
organization going past October.

   Brattleboro (Vt.) Reformer on foreign aid:
   A sign of how dramatically America's financial status has
changed during the Reagan administration could be found in a recent
New york Times dispatch that pointed out that the 10 largest banks
in the world now are all Japanese.
   The biggest U.S. bank, Citibank, is not even in the top 20. ...
   Almost as stunning ... was the report in the Boston Globe ...
that Japan this year is providing $10 billion in relief supplies,
technical assistance and development grants to Third World
countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America.
   Washington's aid totals just $9.2 billion and is stagnant. ...
   For a long time, the United States has not been a particulary
generous contributor of foreign aid measured on a per capita basis,
but at least the country's overall aid allotment exceeded that of
other countries.
   Now Japan, with a population half the size of the United
States', has surpassed this country.

   The Arizona Daily Star, Tucson, Ariz., on personal touches:
   In an increasingly faceless, nameless world, a personal touch
remains _ on the bottom of the humble grocery bag.
   You may not know the names of your neighbors, or who handles
your phone bill, but at least you know that your paper grocery sack
was personally inspected by Isaac. Or Made With Pride by Larry. Or
crafted by Irene.
   Of course, the bags are made by machines, as almost everything
else is today. But the name at the bottom _ carefully printed, or
dramatically scrawled _ reminds one that people are behind it all.
   You don't know their faces, but you know their work. They labor
anonymously _ save for the small scraps of paper or signature
stamps that accompany their products.
   Strangely, you can identify with these unseen workers. They come
to symbolize fellow travelers in impersonal society. ...
   Some companies still identify their inspectors, but have lost
the personal touch. It's mighty hard to conjure up affinity with an
inspector called ``10 T.''

   The Westerly (R.I.) Sun on using unapproved drugs for AIDS:
   Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Frank E. Young took an
important step in deciding to let people import small quantities of
unapproved drugs for treatment of AIDS or other intractable
conditions.
   It is an act of compassionate good sense.
   Allowing such departures from normal FDA practices might be
thought to undermine sound procedural rules. This need not be the
case if reasonable precautions against abuse are taken.
   The drugs to be allowed past customs for personal use may or may
not be effective.
   In a sense, that is neither here nor there; the point is, there
is a chance they might help.

   Savannah (Ga.) Evening Press on Edwin Meese:
   Recognizing that our readers may be getting tired of editorials
about Attorney General Edwin Meese, we promise to keep this one as
short as possible.
   Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., has asked the Office of Government
Ethics to launch a new inquiry into Meese's conduct. Since another
new probe was initiated by the Justice Department's ethics unit not
many days ago, Levin's proposal seems unnecessary and a political
ploy.
   One can hardly blame the Democrats for trying to make hay off
Meese's problems, but they face the danger of overkill. Let's have
one investigation at a time.
   Meese, for his part, continues to make amazing defenses of his
conduct. Now he has charged that he never would have been
investigated by a special counsel if his two top aides had not
bungled a preliminary inquiry.
   Doesn't he realize that acceptance of his charge would require
the conclusion that he chose inept and incompetent deputies?

   The Alabama Journal, Montgomery, Ala., on aid to the Contras:
   Maybe it's a genuine awakening of understanding. Maybe it's
concern about a party ticket led by someone with no foreign policy
experience.
   Whatever the case, Democrats in the Senate are now talking
sensibly about restoring military aid to the Contras in Nicaragua
if the Sandinista regime continues to violate the peace pledges it
has made.
   That the Sandinistas haven't done what they'd said they'd do
should surprise no one.
   This is a dedicated Marxist outfit, indebted philosophically,
economically and militarily to Moscow and Havana, and its leaders
cannot be trusted.
   The resistance of the Contras is all that prevents the total
domination of Nicaragua by the Sandinistas. That resistance is
enfeebled by the cutoff of American aid. ...
   Now some Sentate Democrats say they favor releasing that
withheld aid for the Contras if the peace plan is not honored. Well
they should.
   The Sandinistas obviously intended to honor the agreement only
as long as it suited their purposes and only to the degree that it
was convenient. The military aid, which has been waiting in
warehouses, should be released now.

   The Seattle Times on compensation for interned
Japanese-Americans:
   For thousands of Japanese-descent Americans in the Seattle area
and elsehwere across the nation, that long-dreamed-of event seems
near: Congress is poised to give final approval to a redress bill
that would provide some compensation to those remaining of the
120,000 such citizens who were interned during World War II. ...
   A most significant feature is the bill's apology to those loyal
Americans whose lives were terribly disrupted and who suffered
unjust economic and other punishment because of their origin.
   A spokesman for Rep. Mike Lowry, D-Seattle, an early champion of
the legislation, notes there is speculation that President Reagan
will eventually sign the bill, ``but do it very quietly.''
   To ``do it very quietly'' would be a mistake. Reagan should sign
the measure soon _ with a flourish and a declaration that the
United States is a nation that can acknowledge it once erred.

   St. Petersburg (Fla.) Times on pollution control:
   Sen. Tim Wirth, D-Colo. summed up the fate of our hothouse
planet at a news conference held to promote new pollution control
legislation proposed recently:
   ``The evidence from the world's leading scientists is
compelling: As the Earth's atmosphere gets warmer, our global
climate is changing dramatically in ways that will seriously
disrupt nature and human society. ... We must change course.''
   The potentially disastrous global warming trend is caused by
gaseous pollution in the atmosphere, namely carbon dioxide released
by the burning of fossil fuels.
   Since the United States is the leading world offender, it is our
responsibility to act immediately by reducing wasteful energy
consumption and tightening energy standards for automobiles and
factory smokestacks.

   Albuquerque (N.M.) Journal on President Aquino and Ferdinand
Marcos:
   Philippine President Corazon Aquino faces a tough decision.
Should she welcome former President Marcos home _ no questions
asked, no criminal charges leveled _ in exchange for an infusion of
$5 billion?
   Marcos also pledges an infusion of good will. His support for
the Aquino government would heal the rift between his compatriots
and the new regime, ushering in an era of national reconciliation,
according to Marcos' spokesman.
   Surely to deny his request would prolong the enmity between
Marcos partisans and Aquino supporters.
   Those appear to be powerful incentives, but one has to wonder if
the ex-president could support (Mrs.) Aquino, actually swinging his
still substantial political following behind a leader they perceive
as a usurper. Or does ``support'' translate to ``not actively
oppose''?
   What cannot survive, if this deal is cut, is the electorate's
faith in the integrity of government, any sense that government
officials are there to serve instead of loot.

   The Baltimore Sun on Michael Dukakis' promises:
   Contrary to Democratic oratory through the ages, President
Herbert Hoover never promised two chickens in every pot, or even
one chicken.
   But Gov. Michael S. Dukakis is promising ``good jobs at good
wages for every single citizen of this country,'' and therein lies
a danger of some chickens coming home to roost.
   There is simply no chance Dukakis could deliver on this promise.
   On the subject of ``full employment,'' hyperbole comes easily to
Democrats. Their Humphrey-Hawkins bill, passed a decade ago,
decreed that by 1983 there would be 4 percent unemployment and zero
inflation.
   At the time of enactment, we suggested a better name for
Humphrey-Hawkins would be ``hogwash, hooey and hokum,'' and nothing
that has transpired has changed our mind.

   The Philadelphia Inquirer on Lloyd Bentsen's financing:
   Republicans are fuming that it's unfair to let Sen. Lloyd
Bentsen, D-Texas, use millions in privately raised funds to win
re-election to the Senate while he runs for vice president on a
ticket that, like the GOP side, gets $46 million in federal funding
and can spend no more than that.
   Because items such as ads on Texas television will help Bentsen
in both campaigns at once, the GOP complains that the $10 million
or so that the senator may spend on his re-election will give the
Dukakis-Bentsen ticket an unfair advantage in trying to win Texas,
one of the main battlefields of what could be a close election.
   The Republicans are right.
   Whether or not the Bentsen twofer is illegal is a murkier
question. ... The practice smacks of unfairness.

   The Knoxville (Tenn.) News-Sentinel on political conventions:
   In rejecting complaints that Atlanta's Omni was too small for a
national convention, Democratic National Committee Chairman Paul
Kirk said it was appropriate for the purpose: to serve as a
television studio.
   Television officials complain that the audiences are being
turned off by the conventions. TV's star reporters complain that
they don't get enough air time.
   As the Democrats wound up their show in Atlanta, ABC News
president Roone Arledge called conventions obsolete and said it is
time for the parties ``to look at whether they want to have a
four-day anachronistic meeting where no business is transacted, or
very little.''
   There is even talk in some quarters of abolishing conventions,
now that the television networks have reduced their coverage to a
few hours a night. That would be a mistake.
   Rather than complain about conventions, the networks ought to do
some self-examination. ...
   Fortunately, the networks no longer have a monopoly, and
interested citizens can find convention coverage on public
broadcasting, cable and local stations.

   Evening Express, Portland, Maine, on investigating Jim Wright:
   The appointment of former Chicago Bar Association president
Richard J. Phelan as independent counsel for an ethics committee's
probe into the actions of House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, was a
wise and necessary step in keeping the public's confidence that the
investigation will be fair and complete.
   But the panel should rescind immediately an unnecessary
restriction it imposed by limiting his inquiry to a two-month-old
list of six charges without allowing him to follow further
allegations unless he gets special permission.
   The committee has also retained control over public release of
Phelan's findings, another unnecessary and potentially harmful
decision. ...
   There's no reason that (Phelan) can't conduct an honest
investigation. But the ethics committee shouldn't restrict its
scope and should let him speak out freely about his findings.
   Otherwise, the charges of political favoritism just won't go
away.

   Neither Iraq nor Iran seems ready to accept a draw yet. ...
   The ugliness and absurdity of the war has blurred distinctions
between right and wrong. ...
   Iraq has used chemical weapons against Iran. ... (Ayatollah)
Khomeini, who claims a divine mandate, has been no angel either,

boys, to their deaths.

   The Duluth (Minn.) News-Tribune on Congress' drought relief
bills:
   We don't like the way Congress is going about its efforts to
provide drought relief.
   The drought, of course, was unexpected _ so the drought relief
has to come from money not provided for in the federal budget.
   But recent budget figures indicate there's only $5.9 billion
standing between the 1988 budget and the $146 billion deficit that
will trigger the across-the-board budget cuts everyone hates.
   So what are our drought-hating lawmakers doing these hot days in
D.C.? Farm state lawmakers are pushing for a quick compromise on
the $4.4 billion House version and the Senate drought aid package
with a price tag ranging from $5.9 billion to $6.6 billion.
   Why the rush? Because other things like nutrition aid programs
and the war on drugs are threatening to take a slice of the $5.9
billion.
   If lawmakers could bring themselves to stay within $146 billion
of a black-ink budget, they wouldn't face this dilemma or have to
make such unseemly haste on this important program.

   Delta Democrat Times, Greenville, Miss., on giving to political

   All Americans now have the right _ as they always should have _
not to be forced to give money to political candidates or causes.
   Twenty non-union workers of the American Telephone and Telegraph
Company sued the Communications Workers of America to recover money
the union had spent on political advocacy.
   A trial court determined that CWA could prove only 21 percent of
``agency fees'' collected had been used for collective bargaining,
and had ordered the other 79 percent rebated. ...

William J. Brennan, its most liberal member, while the allegedly

right to withhold their money from unions' political activities.

   Press-Telegram, Long Beach, Calif., on the McKay report on Meese:
   Ed Meese and his lawyers say independent counsel James McKay was
unfair to Meese. Having decided not to prosecute him, McKay then
issued a report saying he's convinced that Meese broke the law and
that a jury would find him guilty. ...
   It was unfair to Meese. It was also unfair to the people of the
United States. ...
   But McKay never tested in court his conclusion that jurors would
find the attorney general guilty as charged. ...
   McKay decided not to prosecute on the ground that he lacked
evidence that Meese did what he did for personal gain. But Meese
realized personal gain from what he did. ...
   Meese says McKay's report vindicates him. That's foolish. What
McKay's report does is cover Meese with mud. ...
   The only way Meese can get all the mud off now is to demand that
the Justice Department finish McKay's job and prosecute. Then a
jury can vindicate Meese. Or it can do what McKay said it would.
   Either way, the unfairness that stains the Meese report will be
removed.

   This little town is having big problems
electing a mayor.
   When Hattie M. Shelton announced she would not seek another term
because of health problems, Thomas Ledford and Harold Hartman
campaigned in the April election to head the town of 264 residents.
They finished with 17 votes apiece.
   They tried again in June, this time drawing 20 votes each.
   The mayor's race was on the ballot again in the primary election
Tuesday. Again the only difference was the number of votes _ 34 for
Hartman, 34 for Ledford.
   ``I can hardly believe it. It just doesn't seem possible that it
could happen again like that,'' said Hartman, 56, a supervisor at a
manufacturing plant.
   Hartman and Ledford said they would run again _ whenever there's
another election _ for the $50-a-month position. Mrs. Shelton
agreed in April to stay on as mayor until a successor was chosen.
   ``We've made the effort and neither of us wants to quit at this
point. We just keep plugging along,'' said Ledford, 50, a
landscaper. ``We've been trying to contact as many people as we
can. I think we'll have to talk to everybody in town the next
time.''
   The town 25 miles northeast of Kansas City has 109 registered
voters.

   Cypriot President George Vassiliou criticized
the United States today for past inaction in seeking reunification
of his divided island, but said American interest in persuading
Turkey to withdraw its troops was picking up.
   Some 30,000 troops and 50,000 Turkish settlers occupy the
northern part of Cyprus. Vassiliou will meet in New York on Aug. 24
with Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash under U.N. auspices. The
Cypriot president has proposed a federalized republic and the
island's demilitarization.
   In the 14 years since the Turkish invasion, Vassiliou said, the
United States has been ``unwilling to exert its influence to
moderate Turkey'' while promoting withdrawal of foreign troops in
other countries.
   ``Will foreign troops be withdrawn from everywhere but Cyprus?''
he asked.
   In effect, he said, the United States had taken a position in
favor of Turkey and one that was inconsistent with American policy
elsewhere. But he said he found the Reagan administration ready to
play a more active role.
   At the same time, Vassiliou said the majority Greek Cypriots
would have to make concessions to the Turkish Cypriots, such as
accepting a Turkish province alongside the Greek Cypriot entity,
both under a federal government.
   ``We have to recognize, despite what we may have liked as Greeks
in the past, that there is only one way to get this feeling of
security for everybody concerned, to establish a real federation,''
he said.
   The two provinces would retain their governments, whatever
shifts in population there might be, while police forces and courts
would be local to establish a feeling of trust, he said.
   Vassiliou rejected a suggestion that Cypriots develop their own
nationalism.
   ``The only way forward is for the Greek Cyrpiots to be proud
that they're Greeks and for the Turkish Cypriots to be proud that
they're Turks and at the same time for both of them to recognize
that they were born on ... Cyprus, and that they should get
together on that island,'' he said.
   ``I don't think we can develop a kind of third type of Cyprus
nation. There is no such thing as a Cypriot nation,'' Vassiliou
said. ``There are Cypriot Greeks and Cypriot Turks and the
recognition is very important, because if you start saying, `I want
a Cypriot nation,' you will create a feeling of anxiety,''
especially among the Turks, because they are in the minority.
   Vassiliou, who is on a 10-day visit to the United States, met on
Monday with President Reagan and Vice President George Bush. He is
meeting in Boston later today with Gov. Michael Dukakis, the
Democratic presidential nominee.

<HEAD>Senate Democrats Near Agreement on Aid Package for Nicaraguan
Rebels</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Senate Democrats crept toward agreement today
on a compromise aid package for the Nicaraguan Contra rebels which
they hoped would cool the issue's status as a political hot potato.
   ``There is a framework coming together I think we'll be able to
agree on,'' Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., told
reporters after a meeting of nearly a dozen Democratic senators
late Tuesday.
   But Byrd declined to offer details of the plan and cautioned
that ``the situation still is fluid.''
   Meetings continued today and participants reported slow
progress. Byrd planned to add the aid package to a Pentagon money
bill if agreement could be reached on its details, and said he
still hoped to attract Republican support.
   Meanwhile, President Reagan renewed his support for major
assistance for the Contras. ``Today, I call upon Congress to keep
faith with itself,'' he told a White House meeting of news media
exeuctives.
   Even as the Democrats met behind closed doors on Tuesday, Senate
Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., was making pointed political
references to the issue and seeking to highlight disagreements
between the two Democratic standard-bearers: Massachusetts Gov.
Michael Dukakis, who opposes aid, and his vice-presidential running
mate, Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, who has supported it.
   Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., one of those participating in the
Democratic drafting sessions, said the package would offer
continued humanitarian aid to the anti-Sandinista rebels and
provide for the release of some $16 million to $18 million in
already purchased weapons if certain conditions were met and
Congress gave its consent in a later vote. It would provide no new
money for lethal aid, he said.
   Conditions for triggering the later vote would include continued
flows of Soviet weaponry into Nicaragua, violations of last year's
regional peace accord by the leftist Sandinista government and any
attempt by he Managua regime to militarily ``mop up'' the rebel
forces, Kerry said.
   The Contras have received no new military support since early
this year, when Congress rejected lethal aid and a cease-fire
between the two sides took effect.
   But some $16 million to $18 million in weapons bought with
previously authorized money remain stockpiled in Contra warehouses
and available for use if Congress gives the go-ahead and _ more
importantly _ provides for a delivery mechanism like the CIA.
   ``The true nature and intention of the Sandinistas are exposed.
When are people in Congress who have been lied to for nine years
going to get angry about it?'' Reagan said.
   He said, ``After nine years of lies, broken promises and
non-compliance, the Sandinista mortgage is due.''
   Sandinista ``subversion in Central America poses a risk all the
way up to the Rio Grande,'' Reagan said.
   In response to a question, Reagan said he supports a $47 million
package of military supplies and humanitarian aid to help the
Contras. He also said Congress should start by freeing the already
purchased weapons now stored in warehouses.
   ``It is a political issue,'' Dole told reporters in one of
several appearances Tuesday that appeared designed to turn up the
political heat. ``There is a schism between the two candidates.''
   Dukakis strongly opposes military support to the rebels fighting
the Managua government, while Bentsen consistently has voted for
it. ``Senator Bentsen was right. Governor Dukakis is wrong,'' Dole
added.
   Dole has proposed his own aid package, which includes $27
million in new humanitarian aid for the rebels and $20 million in
new military supplies. The lethal portion of the aid would be
released only if Congress voted to do so at some later date. Dole
vowed to attach his version to the first legislative vehicle which
comes before the Senate.
   ``If they want to starve the Contras ... then that's up to the
majority Democrats and their nominee for president,'' Dole added,
denying that his partisan attacks were part of any campaign to get
himself named to the GOP vice-presidential slot.
   The issue is a delicate one for both parties. Democrats don't
want to be accused of starving the rebels out and giving a free
hand to the Marxist Sandinista government. Republicans don't want
to be accused of derailing the now-faltering regional peace process.
   Bentsen, meanwhile, called for an aid package that includes
standby military supplies for the Contras. He seemed to describe in
broad terms a package like the one being worked on by his fellow
Democrats.
   ``We ought to fence what military aid has already been sent down
there and that (aid) be held there, and that the Sandinistas
understand it's there and can be used and given to the Contras if
they ... try to wipe out the Contras,'' Bentsen said.
   He said he would support Contra aid when it comes to the floor
later this week, despite Dukakis' views on the subject. ``I have
been voting my conscience in the Senate for 18 years, and I am
going to continue to do that, and (Dukakis) accepts that.''

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Seven Metro-North police officers were suspended
today after a videotape surfaced that showed them cavorting nearly
nude around Grand Central station, the commuter railroad said.
   The tape was reportedly made during a 1983 strike by railroad
workers that did not involve police, according to Dan Brucker, a
spokesman for the Metro-North Commuter Railroad.
   ``I am morally outraged by their actions. I am insulted and I am
embarrassed,'' Metro-North President Peter Stangl said in a
statement. He called the officers' conduct ``unprofessional and
unacceptable.''
   He said that the officers depicted on the tape have been
suspended without pay and that the railroad will seek to have them
fired and stripped of their commissions to prevent them from
joining another police force in New York state.
   A railroad source who spoke on condition of anonymity said the
tape showed the officers harassing the homeless and was derogatory
toward blacks. In the tape at least one of the officers was
completely naked, the source said.
   Stangl said the videotape was brought to his attention Monday
and he viewed it on Tuesday.
   ``In my opinion, these individuals have demonstrated by their
conduct, a lack of good moral character and fitness to hold a
police commission,'' he said.
   Brucker said he did not know who made the tape or why and how
Stangl received it.
   Capt. Peter A. Nyland, the acting chief of the department, did
not immediately return calls today. The Metro-North Patrolmen's
Benevolent Association, which represents some of the officers, did
not return a call.
   Chief John Esposito was suspended last month after his
indictment on charges that he misused computers to do background
checks on job applicants and people who sued the railroad. Esposito
pleaded innocent.

<HEAD>Volcanoes May Contribute to Ozone Destruction, Report Says
^Eds: For release at 6 p.m. EDT</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Volcanic eruptions may contribute to depletion
of the Earth's ozone layer by belching an average of up to 1.4
million tons a year of ozone-destroying gases into the
stratosphere, a report says.
   But volcanoes pose far less threat to ozone than man-made
chemicals called chlorofluorocarbons do, said researcher William
Rose.
   The ozone layer in the stratosphere blocks ultraviolet radiation
from the sun that can cause skin cancer. Destruction of ozone by
chlorofluorocarbons has caused worldwide concern, leading to a
treaty signed recently by two dozen countries to curtail emissions.
   The new study is presented in Thursday's issue of the British
journal Nature by Rose and Robert Symonds of Michigan Technological
University in Houghton, with Mark Reed at the University of Oregon
in Eugene.
   They estimated concentrations of various gases from past
volcanic eruptions and used the results to project annual worldwide
totals.
   On average, volcanoes release a total of up to 15.4 million tons
of hydrogen chloride and hydrogen fluoride to the atmosphere a
year, but less than a tenth reaches the stratosphere, they
calculated.
   Gases from cataclysmic volcanic eruptions can rise more than 15
miles high, so they should encounter the maximum concentration of
ozone at about 15 miles, they wrote. But more work is needed to
tell just what such eruptions actually do to the ozone, they said.

   About 600 suspected Nazi war criminals are
under investigation in the United States and 30 denaturalization
and deportation cases are pending in the courts, a U.S. Justice
Department official said.
   Neal Sher, head of the department's Office of Special
Investigations, said the growing number of proceedings against
suspected war criminals was the result of an aggressive policy to
seek out Nazi collaborators.
   ``I don't wait for someone to present me with an allegation. We
seek out people,'' Sher told The Associated Press before a
conference Wednesday on Nazi war criminals.
   Sher said the Justice Department had computerized lists of Nazi
officers found in concentration camps in Austria, Poland and
Germany after World War II and compared them with U.S. immigration
records.
   He said the department is investigating all U.S. citizens
suspected of Nazi collaboration, and the names of 9,800 former
concentration camp guards were placed on a special watch list
barring them from entering the United States.

   Men who have genital sores or are uncircumcised
have a much greater risk of catching AIDS during sexual intercourse
with infected women, a study concludes.
   The research, conducted in Kenya, suggests that the prevalence
of some sexually transmitted diseases, the common use of
prostitutes and the lower frequency of circumcision may help
explain why AIDS has spread widely through heterosexual contact in
parts of central Africa.
   While AIDS is transmitted mostly through homosexual encounters
and illicit drug use in the United States and Europe, experts
believe it is largely a heterosexual disease in Africa, where up to
a quarter of sexually active adults in some cities are infected.
   The study was conducted with men who caught sexually transmtted
diseases from prostitutes in a Nairobi neighborhood where more than
85 percent of the street prostitutes were infected with HIV, the
AIDS virus.
   ``Clearly, prostitute contact, genital ulcer disease and an
intact foreskin are all risk factors for HIV infection,'' said Dr.
J. Neil Simonsen, who directed the study.
   Uncircumcised men were nearly three times more likely than
circumcised men to be infected with HIV. Those with a history of
genital ulcers, or sores, were seven times more likely to have the
virus.
   Being circumcised seems to help protect people somewhat from
catching some venereal diseases. However, the researchers found
that uncircumcised men were still more likely than circumcised men
to catch HIV, even if they had never had a sexual disease.
   The research has been presented in part at several scientific
meetings and was published in Thursday's New England Journal of
Medicine.
   In the study, the researchers found a strong link between AIDS
risk and a sexually transmitted ailment called chancroid. This
bacterial disease is common in Africa but relatively rare in the
United States. However, Simonsen said that two common American
diseases, genital herpes and syphilis, also probably increase the
chance of AIDS.
   The report said that controlling diseases that cause genital
sores could be an important means of stopping the spread of AIDS.
   The researchers speculate that the sores might raise AIDS
susceptibility by causing breaks in the skin where the virus can
enter. People with genital sores may also be more likely to pass on
the AIDS virus if they are already infected with it.
   The researchers are unsure how being uncircumcised might
increased the risk of AIDS infection. However, Simonsen said it's
possible that ``the presence of a foreskin offers a nice, moist
microenvironment for the AIDS virus to survive longer and have a
greater chance of penetration through little nicks in the skin that
are a normal part of sexual intercourse.''
   Even though the report found an association between circumcision
and AIDS risk, it does not prove that circumcision actually helps
protect people from infection.
   ``Based on this data, it's not possible to recommend that
everybody run out and get circumcised,'' Simonsen said. ``The
association is strong and probably will be causal, but you can't
conclude that.''
   The researchers said 85 percent of white American men are
circumcised. Circumcision practices vary in Africa. In the Kenyan
study, three-quarters of the men were circumcised.
   Simonsen, a physician at Case Western Reserve University in
Cleveland, Ohio, conducted the work with researchers from the
University of Nairobi, the Kenya Medical Research Institute, the
Nairobi Special Treatment Clinic, the University of Manitoba and
the Institute of Tropical Medicine in Belgium.
   In an accompanying editorial, Dr. Jonathan M. Mann of the World
Health Organization estimated that there have been 250,000 cases of
acquired immune deficiency syndrome worldwide so far, and 5 million
to 10 million people are probably infected with the AIDS virus.
   He said other factors that may contribute to AIDS in Africa are
blood transfusions, the use of unclean needles and infection of
babies by their mothers during birth.

<HEAD>143 Men Say They Won't Do Required Military Service</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GREG MYRE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of 143 men, including
doctors, lawyers and a commissioned army captain, said Wednesday
they won't perform the military service required of all white males
in South Africa.
   At news conferences in Johannesburg, Cape Town, Durban and
Grahamstown, the men cited religious, moral and political reasons
for their refusal to serve in the South African Defense Force. Most
of the men could face up to six years in prison if convicted of
avoiding military service.
   ``The army is not defending South Africa as a whole, but is
defending the system of apartheid,'' said Etienne Marais, who was
in the army from 1980-2.
   ``Thousands (of black South Africans) have been detained,
tortured or died in what can only be called a civil war,'' said
Marais, 26, a psychology student at the University of the
Witwatersrand in Johannesburg.
   All white men in South Africa are required to perform two years
of initial service, and after that, they are subject to annual
call-up camps that can last as long as three months.
   More than 100 of the 143 men have not served any time in the
military. The rest, including Marais, have served some of their
required service but vowed not do any more.
   Several have served in Angola, where South Africa is fighting
alongside rebels battling that country's Marxist government.
   The men, who said they were not part of any organized movement,
included doctors, lawyers, engineers, a nuclear physicist and Army
Capt. Andre Zaaiman, who renounced his commission and said he would
not serve in the call-up camps if ordered to do so.
   ``I'm not prepared to fight or die for apartheid,'' said
Zaaiman, 28, a teaching assistant at the University of Cape Town.
   ``I reconfirm my refusal to participate in any way in the SADF
until the system of apartheid has been done away with completely
and until the SADF acts in the interest of all South Africans,'' he
said.
   The South African government no longer releases information on
how many men refuse orders to serve. In 1985, the last year
government announced the figures, 7,589 men chose not to serve.
   The End Conscription Campaign, which opposes mandatory military
service, has said the numbers are increasing due to the army's
involvement in Angola and in patrolling black townships in South
Africa.
   The army sometimes arranges non-military government service for
men who refuse to serve for religious reasons. However, the
military refuses to provide alternative service for men objecting
to service on moral or political grounds.
   The group of military objectors called for non-military,
non-government alternative service for men who did not want to
serve in the SADF.
   ``As loyal South Africans we wish to contribute to the building
of a peaceful, non-racial and just society,'' the group said in a
statement. ``We do not see serving in the SADF as a way of
contributing to peace in our country.''
   Last week, military objector David Bruce, a 25-year-old
university student, was sentenced to six years following a highly
publicized trial.
   In March, Dr. Ivan Toms, who ran a health clinic in the black
squatter camp of Crossroads outside Cape Town, was sentenced to 21
months in prison for refusing to serve in a one-month call-up camp.
   Military service by non-whites in South Africa is voluntary.

   An infant, two of whose fingers were
severed during a Caesarean section, has left the hospital with
surgeons confident the reattached digits will survive.
   Eleven-day-old Kristen Meckle left North Memorial Medical Center
with her mother, Diane, on Tuesday to fly home to Wildrose, N.D.
They will return in two weeks to have the cast on Kristen's left
hand removed.
   Kristen was rushed to North Memorial from Trinity Medical Center
in Minot, N.D., after a surgeon accidentally severed most of her
index finger and more than a third of the middle finger with a
surgical stapler during delivery, hospital officials said.
   During five hours of surgery, a team used tiny wires to
reconnect the bones, stitched together seven severed blood vessels,
reattached five tendons and some nerves and finally sewed the outer
skin closed.
   ``The fingers are healing very well and circulation is
excellent,'' said surgeon Martin Adson. So these fingers that are
so important in picking up things ``almost certainly will survive
now,'' he added.
   He said only time will tell how much stiffness will remain. ``In
general, children do better than adults, so we are hoping a newborn
will do even better,'' he said.
   Mrs. Meckle said she harbors no ill feelings over what happened
during the delivery, calling it ``just an unfortunate accident.''
She declined to name the doctor involved but said, ``I'd go back to
him anytime.''
   Finger loss or other serious injuries during Caesarean sections
are extremely rare, said Theresa Malone, spokeswoman for the
American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists in Washington.
But she said no records are kept on the number.

   A delegation from the International Civil
Aviation Organization is in the Iranian city of Bandar Abbas to
investigate the downing of an Iran Air jetliner by the U.S. Navy,
Iranian press reports said today.
   The team arrived in the southern port city late Tuesday for a
three-day visit to ``inspect the scene of the crash, wreckage of
the Airbus, Bandar Abbas airport and searching operations,'' said
the official Islamic Republic News Agency.
   The team will help supervise the search for the plane's flight
recorder and victims of the July 3 downing, said the reports
monitored in Nicosia.
   The jetliner was shot down over the southern Persian Gulf while
on a flight from Bandar Abbas to Dubai in the United Arab Emirates.
All 290 people on board were killed. The Navy said the missile
carrier Vincennes fired two missiles at the plane, mistaking it for
an F-14 jet fighter on attack formation.
   In Washington today, defense officials said that Pentagon
investigators believe human error led to the missile attack on the
jetliner. The investigators believe the ship's computerized radar
and tracking equipment were apparently operating properly, said
defense officials who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The officials said the military investigators were advancing the
theory that crewmen aboard the USS Vincennes, under stress from
their first combat action, misinterpreted the radar data presented
by the ship's Aegis defense system.
   ``There were no problems with Aegis,'' said one official.
   Iran's delegation to U.N. peace talks today called again for a
clear U.S. apology and reparations.
   ``The findings ... once again prove that what we said from the
very beginning was actually what happened,'' said Mohammad Javad
Zarif, counsellor at the Iranian Mission and spokesman for the
delegation.
   ``Now it is time for the United States to act responsibly,'' he
said. Zarif, speaking by telephone, said that the United States
should pay reparations and issue ``a clear apology for the murder
of 290 innocent people.''
   The full report on the investigation from the U.S. military is
not expected until mid-August.
   The International Civil Aviation Organization team will report
to the organization's council, IRNA reported. The group is based in
Montreal, Canada.

<DATELINE>ALLENBY BRIDGE, Occupied West Bank (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Legislators of a small
right-wing party stood near this bridge to Jordan on Wednesday and
urged Israel to annex the West Bank now that King Hussein is
breaking formal ties with the territory.
   In a closed Cabinet session, Industry Minister Ariel Sharon
recommended that Israel apply its law in parts of the occupied West
Bank and Gaza Strip where Jewish settlers live, an aide said.
   Also on Wednesday, the army blew up or sealed 12 homes of West
Bank families whose sons are accused of firebombing Israeli targets
during the rebellion that began eight months ago among the 1.5
million Palestinians in the occupied territories.
   Hospital officials said soldiers shot and wounded five
Palestinians in two West Bank cities but the army confirmed only
three wounded. At least 236 Palestinians have been killed since the
uprising began Dec. 8, and four Israelis also have been slain.
   Hussein announced Sunday he would sever legal and administrative
ties with the West Bank, which Israel captured from Jordan in the
1967 Middle East war. The Israelis took the Gaza Strip from Egypt
in that war.
   Legislators of the small Tehiya party and their supporters held
the 30-minute rally at a checkpoint half a mile from the Allenby
Bridge. It delayed hundreds of Palestinian travelers bound for
Jordan, who endured the sweltering desert heat in taxis, trucks and
vans.
   One demonstrator raised a placard saying ``Good riddance King
Hussein.'' Yuval Neeman, a nuclear scientist and Tehiya parliament
member, said: ``Thank you for abandoning your claim here, King
Hussein. This is now the historic moment for Israel to declare
sovereignty in this area.''
   Lawmaker Geula Cohen said Israelis might seek to annex parts of
Jordan if it ever went to war with Israel again. She contended
parts of Hussein's kingdom were settled by Israelites in biblical
times.
   She and the other legislators said they would press their
demands for annexation with Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, whose
right-wing Likud bloc considers the West Bank part of the historic
land of Israel.
   About 850,000 Palestinians and 65,000 Jewish settlers live in
the West Bank.
   Hussein has not been specific about how he will end Jordan's
links with the territory, to which his government has provided more
than $200 million a year for for schools, farms, Islamic
institutions and hospitals. Palestinians in the West Bank also have
Jordanian passports.
   He said the area will be the responsibility of the Palestine
Liberation Organization, which Arab countries and the United
Nations have designated the sole legal representative of the
Palestinian people.
   Shamir has taken Hussein's decision to mean the king is
relinquishing Jordan's claim to the West Bank.
   Sharon, a former general and defense minister, urged the
government to annex part of the occupied territories. He spoke
during a two-hour Cabinet meeting about Hussein's announcement.
   ``Israel must apply Israeli law to areas in Judea and Samaria
(biblical names for the West Bank) and Gaza where there are Jewish
settlements and where there is sparse Arab population,'' the aide
quoted him as saying.
   The Knesset decided to interrupt its summer recess for a debate
next Monday about Jordan's new policy.
   A second day of Palestinian protest was reported Wednesday in
Nablus, the largest West Bank city. An official of Al Ittihad
hospital said soldiers wounded four young Arabs who threw stones.
   He said troopers later tried to arrest Taner Abu Salah, 24, who
had an arm wound, but doctors would not let him be moved. An army
spokesman said three people were wounded and he could not confirm
the attempted arrest.
   Another hospital official said a fifth Palestinian, 17-year-old
Abed Rabu Jawabreh, was wounded in the stomach. Both hospital
officials spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The 12 homes blown up or sealed before dawn were in four
villages and belonged to families of young Arabs who threw
firebombs at soldiers, civilians or suspected Arab collaborators,
the army said. Two reserve officers were reported seriously burned
in one attack in June.
   Families said they were given two hours to remove belongings.
Witnesses said women in Beit Ummar shouted ``This is for the
redemption of Palestine!'' as four houses were leveled.

<TEXT>
   The co-pilot at the controls of a Continental jet
that crashed Nov. 15, killing 28 people, was fired by another
airline in 1985 for failing flight tests, a National Transportation
Safety Board report shows.
   Lee Bruecher, 26, was fired from Able Aviation in Houston,
Texas, ``as a result of his failure to successfully complete the
flight examination after at least two attempts,'' said the report
obtained by the Rocky Mountain News.
   The Continental DC-9 crashed in a snowstorm at Stapleton
International Airport with 82 people aboard. Bruecher and pilot
Frank Zvonek, 43, were among the victims.
   The NTSB has not yet determined what caused the crash, although
pilot error, wing icing, wing design, air traffic control and
possible turbulence are among the factors the agency said it was
examining.
   NTSB spokesman Ted Lopatkiewicz said a final report on the cause
is expected to be released at an NTSB meeting Sept. 13.
   Bruce Hicks, Continental spokesman, said Tuesday that
Continental did not learn about Bruecher's dismissal during its
background check of Bruecher.
   But he added, ``The issue of Able Aviation four or five years
ago and Lee Bruecher flying for Continental is irrelevant. He was a
well-experienced pilot.''
   The NTSB report said Gary Guillet, Able's chief flight
instructor, reported that Bruecher ``had a chronic problem of
stepping on the wrong rudder, becoming disoriented, and described
(Bruecher) as tense, and unable to cope with deviations from the
routine.''
   Bruecher, who worked at the commuter airline flying small
turboprop planes from February 1984 to March 1985, was fired after
failing the test three times, the report said.
   Bruecher was hired as a pilot for Rio Airways of Killeen, Texas,
in March 1985. The NTSB said that while flying for Rio, Bruecher
had problems with approaches and takeoffs during flight checks but
received overall satisfactory ratings in June and December 1986 and
was promoted to captain.
   Hicks said Bruecher was hired by Continental from Rio in July
1987 and was trained until Sept. 14. He had completed about 25
flights with Continental _ with 36 hours flying time _ at the time
of the Nov. 15 crash, officials said.
   ``He was a good student,'' said Hicks. ``He passed all tests at
Continental ... (and) we have a good training program.''
   Moreoever, he said, Bruecher passed ``Federal Aviation
Administration tests, was certified by thePFas very
qualified with a DC-9. That's the pertinent facts.''
   Continental officials testified at a four-day NTSB hearing in
March that Bruecher had problems with takeoffs and landings and
crashed once during simulator tests but was certified to fly DC-9s.

Reactors</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Top 6 grafs new on Herrington news conference; Picks up 6th

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Energy Secretary John Herrington today
recommended that two new nuclear reactors producing the raw
materials for nuclear weapons be built in South Carolina and Idaho.
   Herrington told a news conference that a ``state-of-the-art''
heavy-water reactor will be built at DOE's Savannah River complex
near Aiken, S.C., capable of producing all the tritium needed to
meet demand.
   A second, smaller reactor that could be expanded if tests are
successful would be built at the Idaho National E~ ~ScbO /o_\o.
   The two reactors will cost an e P$6.8 billion and will
take approximedely 10 years to complete.
   ``With this approach, we have increased assurance that we can
have the reactor capacity we need on schedule and that no single
external event or generic technical issue can cause a total
shutdown of our tritium production capacity,'' Herrington said.
   Earlier today, Sen. James McClure, R-Idaho, had said he was
confident that the planned gas-cooled test reactor at Idaho Falls
eventually would be expanded into a full-scale production reactor.
But Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., and some other senators said the
money to finance such an expansion might not be available.
   ``The Savannah River reactor will be the No. 1 priority,'' said
Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., who had helped South Carolina lawmakers lobby
for the project.
   Nunn, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said the
Idaho reactor would be a ``back-up system'' and that Congress will
have to ``look very closely'' before deciding whether to expand
that reactor.
   Thurmond said Savannah River was the ``most logical'' choice for
a new production reactor because of ``its existing infrastructure,
its wealth of trained and dedicated personnel, and the unwavering
support it enjoys on the federal, state and local levels.''
   Sen. Ernest F. Hollings, D-S.C., said Savannah was ``simply the
best site'' because it has ``the needed support facilities, the
proven technology and experienced, first-rate personnel.''
   That reactor will cost an estimated $2 billion to $4 billion to
build.
   An Energy Department advisory board concluded last month that
construction of a new, heavy-water reactor at Savannah River
provided the p`best chance'' of ensuring an adequate and
uninterrup|ed of triium, a key ingredient in nuclear
weapons.
   The department has four aging production reactors, three at
Savannah River and one at the Hanford reservation in Washington
state.
   The three Savannah River reactors are shut down for various
reasons, but had previously been operating at less than 50 percent
of full power because of safety concerns.
   The reactor at the Hanford reservation in Washington state was
placed on ``cold standby'' earlier this year.
   Joseph Salgado, an acting deputy secretary of energy, told a
Senate appropriations subcommittee last week that construction of a
new reactor was essential for national security reasons.
   ``Future requirements cannot be met reliably with existing
facilities,'' Salgado said.
   About 5 percent of the nation's stockpile of tritium is lost
each year through natural radioactive decay, Salgado said.
   ``Without a continued supply of new tritium, the effectiveness
of our overall nuclear deterrent capability deteriorates rapidly,''
said Salgado.

   Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich
Genscher discussed the case of pilot Mathias Rust with Soviet
officials during Genscher's visit to Moscow last week, officials
said today.
   Earlier in the day, the 20-year-old West German pilot was
released from a Soviet prison where he was serving a four-year
term. Rust was imprisoned after flying through Soviet airspace and
landing in Moscow's Red Square last year.
   The development comes at a time of efforts by Soviet and West
German officials to improve relations.
   Genscher was in Moscow last weekend to prepare for the scheduled
October summit between Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Soviet leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Michael Gerdts, Genscher's spokesman, told reporters that
``Mathias Rust was a topic in talks between the foreign minister
and (Soviet) Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze'' in Moscow.
   In a statement to the news media today, Genscher said he ``sees
with this decision (to release Rust), efforts by the Soviet
officials to solve humanitarian questions.''
   ``The federal chancellor welcomes the decision by the Soviets to
set Mathias Rust free,'' said Norbert Schaefer, spokesman for the
West German government.
   Schaefer said several people had been involved in the effort to
win Rust's freedom, including West German President Richard von
Weizsaecker and Genscher.

   Hurricane Fabio, ``a very potent and dangerous''
storm with 175 mph gusts, moved toward Hawaii, but it was too early
to tell whether it would threaten the island chain, a forecaster
says.
   At 2 a.m. HST Tuesday (2 a.m. EDT Wednesday), the storm was
1,000 miles east southeast of Honolulu, moving west at 14 mph, said
Hans Rosendal, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service here.
   Clarence Lee, lead National Weather Service forecaster in
Honolulu, said Fabio ``is now a very potent and dangerous
hurricane,'' accompanied by damaging winds, destructive waves and
torrential rain.
   ``This is one of the strongest hurricanes in the area in quite a
while,'' Rosendal said.
   Fabio's maximum sustained winds were estimated near 145 mph. The
storm was expected to continue moving west at 14 mph for the next
24 hours with little change in strength, Rosendal said.
   If the storm remained on its present course and speed, the
center would pass about 50 miles south of Hawaii Island on Friday,
according to the weather service.
   The last major storm to hit Hawaii was Hurricane Iwa, which
brushed the island of Oahu and roared over the top of Kauai with
winds up to 117 mph in November 1982, causing $234 million damage.

<HEAD>Vietnam Suspends Help in MIA Search</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Vietnam said Wednesday it has stopped
helping the search for missing American servicemen and resettling
former political prisoners because of the ``hostile'' U.S. policy
toward the Hanoi government.
   The action abruptly stalled recent agreements on the divisive
issues and a period of general improvement in Vietnamese-U.S.
relations.
   The Voice of Vietnam radio said Vietnam's foreign minister and
deputy prime minister, Nguyen Co Thach, wrote a letter Sunday to
retired Gen. John W. Vessey, President Reagan's special envoy on
humanitarian issues in Vietnam.
   A text of the letter was carried by the official Vietnam News
Agency, which was monitored in Bangkok.
   Thach noted the recent agreements and said, ``regrettably, the
U.S. side has not responded to the Vietnamese side's proposals for
the materialization of these.''
   ``More regrettable still,'' Thach said, was Assistant Secretary
of State Gaston Sigur's July 28 testimony before a congressional
committee.
   Sigur argued against establishing ``interest sections'' in Hanoi
and Washington, saying that would not improve cooperation on
humanitarian issues, and instead urged continued U.S. isolation of
Vietnam until it ends it decade-old military occupation of Cambodia.
   ``Obviously, that statement shows that the U.S. State Department
is continuing its hostile policy toward Vietnam,'' Thach wrote.
``We have shown our seriousness and good will in solving the U.S.
humanitarian issues, but in response ... the U.S. has made hostile
statements.
   ``In face of that situation, I regret to inform you that the
Vietnamese side is forced to temporarily suspend the U.S.'s
participation in the joint search for and excavation of Americans
missing in action as well as the resettlement in the United States
of the released re-education camp people.''
   Sigur, who is in charge of Asian affairs, testified before a
House foreign affairs subcommittee in response to a pending
congressional resolution that urges establishment of interest
sections, or low-level diplomatic missions. Diplomats say Vietnam
is desperate to break out of its international isolation and bring
in much-needed economic aid.
   Under the Thach-Vessey agreement of a year ago, Vietnam pledged
to accelerate its accounting of nearly 1,800 Americans listing as
missing in action in the Vietnam War. The United States pledged to
help Vietnam with its humanitarian problems.
   In letters to Vessey last month, Thach pledged to try to resolve
by the end of the year 70 MIA cases considered top priority by the
United States and welcomed joint excavations for remains from
August to October. There have been no such excavations since the
first one in late 1985.
   Technical experts of the two sides met in Hanoi last week to
work out arrangements. David Lambertson, assistant secretary of
state for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, said later: ``We
anticipate that joint activities ... could begin quite soon. We
anticipate a substantially higher level of activity over the next
three months.''
   Wednesday's broadcast did not say if Vietnam had also halted
unilateral efforts. It has returned large numbers of suspected MIA
remains since the Vessey agreement.
   In July, the two countries held talks in Hanoi on America's
offer to resettle former U.S. government employees and officials of
the U.S.-backed South Vietnam government who were put into
``re-education camps'' after the 1975 North Vietnamese victory.
   A joint communique said Vietnam was allowing them to emigrate as
the United States gave assurances it would not encourage them to
conduct anti-Vietnamese activities. It said they hoped that
processing could begin in a few months.
   That was a minor breakthrough since there was virtually no
movement after the United States offered in 1984 to resettle the
former internees.
   The Vietnam News Agency on Monday blamed the U.S. for lack of
progress, saying the biggest obstacle was ``the U.S. side's refusal
to set up a working group to organize the emigration to the United
States of about 500,000 people, including relatives of the released
inmates, and to oversee execution of this commitment.''

   Health officials Wednesday ordered more than 6 tons
of Israeli citrus fruit taken off the Japanese market, saying they
are contaminated with a fungicide.
   Inspectors found unacceptably high levels of the fungicide
diphenyl in random samples of Israeli grapefruit, oranges and
lemons sold in 24 Japanese stores, according to Koji Notoya, a
public health official.
   The fruit, tested between June 20 and Aug. 1, contained up to
about .002 ounces per pound of diphenyl above the maximum .0011
ounces per pound allowed by Japanese health standards, Notoya said.
   Large doses of diphenyl can cause liver damage, he said.

   The Israeli army has supplied its soldiers with

military's chief physician said Wednesday.
   The military has in the past year developed a formula that
boosts the body's immune reaction to such chemicals, said Brig.

   The military has also conducted experiments in hospitals with
medical teams trained to treat victims of chemical warfare, the

constitute ``a threat against Israel ... (that) can only grow in

the Krakatau volcano erupted in West Java, a report said Wednesday.
   Archaeologist Halwany Michrab said his team would dig in coastal
Banten district, about 125 miles west of Jakarta, where the volcano
erupted in 1883.
   The skull of a person who is believed to have been killed by the

   Michrab told the newspaper Suara Pembaruan that any remains
recovered would be donated to a museum.

<HEAD>Families With Daughters Get Permission to Try For a Son</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: DELETES extraneous last 2 grafs.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JOHN POMFRET</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rural families who have been blessed with a
daughter but really wanted a son will be allowed to try again under
a new government policy that bows to the myths and economic
realities that have long made peasants prefer male children.
   The exception to China's ``one-family, one-child'' policy was
announced Wednesday by a family planning official. ``They want boys
and they are not abiding by the original policy so we changed it,''
he said of the peasants.
   The new policy, which will not apply to city dwellers, was
criticized by a United Nations official who said the government
should encourage rural families to regard the two sexes equally
rather than bend to their prejudices.
   Li Yong, a spokesman for the State Birth Control Commission,
described the new rule in an interview with The Associated Press.
His remarks were the first official confirmation of the new policy
which amounts to a relaxation of China's rules which prohibit
families from having more than one child.
   The first word of the new policy appeared Tuesday in the
People's Daily, which reported it had been instituted in Shandong
province.
   Li said the state will now give peasants ``in almost every
province'' the freedom to have a second child if their first was a
girl. About 80 percent of China's 1.07 billion people are peasants.
   Li said families would only be permitted to have one extra
child. ``After that they will be subject to the same fines as
everybody else,'' he said.
   Fines for having too many children generally amount to $270 or
more per year for five years _ about twice the average rural income.
   The head of Beijing's office of the United Nations Fund for
Population Activities said the change was unusual because China
recently took steps to enforce the one child policy. ``This change
certainly is not in line with the modern feeling that children of
both sexes are equal,'' said Manfred Kulessa.
   Refusal on the part of the peasants to bow to the one-child
limit prompted the government to loosen its regulations, Li said.
The peasants' belief that boys were economically more productive
than girls and Chinese superstitions favoring male children were
main reasons they fought the policy, he said.
   Li said the change would not greatly affect China's population
because only 19 percent of its families have one child. Nor would
it affect the ratio of men to women, he said.
   ``Our real problems are with the families that have three, five
and even seven children,'' he said. ``We need to concentrate on
those now.'' Li said no relaxation was planned for the stringent
one-child policy in the cities.
   Superstition has made it difficult for government officials to
convince peasants that daughters were as good as sons, Li said,
citing a popular Chinese proverb, ``more sons, more happiness.''
   ``This has become especially true in a dragon year,'' he said.
Chinese mythology says it is good to have children, especially
boys, in a dragon year.
   Recent economic reforms have also created a desire for sons, he
said.
   During the last decade, peasants have returned to farming their
own plots of land. Because the plots are too small for
mechanization, peasants need more hands to do the work. ``Girls
cannot do physical labor as well as boys, naturally a boy is more
desirable,'' he said.
   In addition, most peasants are not covered by any sort of a
pension, so they want to have sons to support them when the get
old. ``When a girl gets married she leaves home,'' he said. ``Boys
stay on and support the old folks.''
   Li acknowledged that an increasing number of girls have been
abandoned by parents who want sons.
   After years of pushing big families, China began attempts to
limit its population with the onset of Western-oriented economic
reforms in 1978.
   But the going has been rough. Apart from the economic reforms
which encourage big families in the countryside, a generation born
during a baby boom in the 1960s has reached child-bearing age.
   As a result, China is in the middle of another baby boom that
has seen the population growth rate jump from 1.1 percent in 1985
to 1.4 percent in 1987. If the growth rate continues China
population could swell to 1.5 billion by 2010.
   China attacked this problem in February when it announced
stringent measures to control growth, linking the salaries of local
family planning officials to the population growth rate of their
area.

<HEAD>With Defense Spending</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here is the text of President Reagan's
announcement Wednesday that he had vetoed the defense authorization
bill and the question-and-answer session that followed.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   I have just now vetoed the defense authorization bill in the
Oval Office. I think my reasons for this action can be plainly
stated, if not seen.
   The bill would signal a basic change in the direction of our
national defense, a change away from strength and proven success
and back toward weakness and accommodation of the 1970s. This
decade opened with a weakened national defense, totalitarian
expansionism and growing regional conflicts. All of these trends,
as we move toward the close of the Eighties, are being reversed.
   I just returned from Moscow after signing the first nuclear arms
treaty in history that reduces nuclear missiles. There's a Soviet
pullout under way in Afghanistan. We see progress in settling
regional conflicts such as Cambodia and Angola, and even in the
Iran-Iraq war. Because of our military presence and strong stand in
the Persian Gulf, there is hope of a settlement. We're also
cautiously hopeful about democratic reform within the Eastern Bloc
itself.
   American prestige and power have been restored. We've dampened
aggression and promoted peace, and we've come to an even greater
realization of how much our renewed military strength has meant to
all of us.
   But, over time, the defense bill that I've just vetoed would
have placed in jeopardy all of these diplomatic and strategic
advances. It would endanger progress in arms negotiations by giving
away our negotiating leverage without getting a single thing in
return from the Soviets. And this I shall not do.
   Second, the bill would gravely endanger the SDI program. No
development has been more crucial to the progress in arms reduction
negotiations than our decision five years ago to proceed with the
Strategic Defense Initiative. The importance placed on this system
by the Soviets is evidenced not only by the 20-year-long
development of their own SDI, but by their actions at the 1986
summit.
   The American people understand the simple truth, the elementary
logic of having in place a defensive system that can protect this
nation from nuclear missile attack and may some day free the world
of the nightmare of nuclear terror. And the American people have
repeatedly expressed their agreement with this position.
   However, the way this bill restricts our proposed space-based
interceptors would cripple the very concept of a space shield
against nuclear attack. And I will not abide this, particularly in
view of the technical progress that SDI is making. They say this
bill would take the stars out of ``Star Wars.''
   With my veto today, I'm putting back the ``I'' _ ``Initiative''
_ in SDI. So the nearly 20 percent cut in SDI funding, combined
with the congressional restriction on the space-based component of
the program amounts to this gutting SDI.
   As I say, I will not abide it. I do not believe the American
people will either. And, again, I want to emphasize that this bill
would mean unilateral concessions to the Soviets, concessions that
would reduce my bargaining leverage at the conference table at the
very moment when that leverage has produced its most fruitful
results.
   It cuts by 25 percent our strategic modernization funding
request at the very moment when we're negotiating a strategic arms
reduction treaty. It represents congressional micromanagement; not
only of key strategic defense programs, but of delicate arms
negotiations. It would set a dangerous precedent of tying
presidential hands in arms negotiations.
   I have been patient as the liberals in Congress attempted to
erode our military strength, a strength that has provided the basis
for our diplomatic success. And I can be patient no longer.
   Congress needs to get back to work and come up with a bill I can
sign. These are issues of national security and they must remain
above partisan politics
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   .
   Yes, Andrea?
   QUESTION: Mr. President, what about the fact that the Democrats
have in this bill more money than you in fact asked for? So how do
you respond to those who say that this is a political gambit on
your part, that this is partisan politics for George Bush against
Mike Dukakis and that you're vetoing a bill that would actually
spend more on defense than you had even asked Congress for?
   REAGAN: Well the partisan politics is on the other side. And the
fact that the total of the bill is within the budget requirements,
it is the fact that inside they have taken upon themselves to
change where the spending is going to take place and remove it from
some things and add it to others.
   Q: What's partisan about that? That's what Congress and the
executive do all the time.
   A: I don't think _ I think there has to come a time when you
depend on the experts, and the people and the military experts and
all, and your own knowledge of what and where the money is most
needed in the military, and not on what they've been doing, for
example, not because we know that there is a partisan position in
which there are a great many there who just don't want SDI at all.
   Well, I think they're bucking the tide, because we've proven
that SDI is _ can be practical and can be a method of protecting us
against a nuclear attack and I think the overwhelming majority of
the American people want that kind of protection.
   Q: Mr. President, given the lateness in the _ both the
congressional season and the political season, do you not now risk
getting no bill at all, or a continuing resolution that would give
you even less of what you seek in terms of defense? In other words,
how much of this is going to result in an actual change as far as
the budget is concerned, and how much sets the stage for a
political debate later in the campaign?
   A: Well, I think we have to recognize that the Senate had a good
bill on this, and one that would have been appropriate and in
conference they gave up too many things. And I just think that they
have to recognize that we've got to come together and recognize
each other's views on what is necessary and what is essential.

   Q: Well do you expect another bill before Congress goes out?
   A: Well, the appropriations bill, as it stands, is one that I
could sign, and would sign.
   Q: Mr. President, are you ready to retract statements that you
made when we downed the Iranian airliner? It seems that the report
will show, apparently, according to reports today, that the crew
panicked; that actually, you know, this sort of thing could
probably happen again.
   A: Well, Helen, I've read and seen and heard what is being said
about the report, and assigning the blame to the people in the
radar room who were interpreting the radar signals and all. But I
can't comment, because actually neither the military nor my office
have received the report as yet. And as soon as we receive it and
can go over it and study it ourselves, then we'll be able to
comment. But.
   Q: No preliminary indications?
   A: No, and I don't think that the _ we could consider the report
final until it has been submitted now. And how it has escaped
before this took place, I have to feel the process has not been
concluded.
   Q: Mr. President, who are you going to choose to replace Jim
Baker as secretary of the Treasury?
   A: You know something? You caught me here. I can't remember just
exactly some of the things _ all that we're considering, and
whether we were ready to make an announcement on that situation as
yet.
   Q: Yeah, go ahead.
   Q: Go ahead.
   A: No, no. One announcement a day is enough.
   Q: Mr. President, you have said that this bill is a product of
partisan politics, and you accuse the liberals of playing politics
with it. Yet your own secretary of defense, Mr. Carlucci, urged you
to sign the bill; Senator Warner from Virginia, the leading
Republican on Armed Services, urged him to sign the bill. How can
you say it's a product of partisan politics and liberal politics if
your own advisers told you to sign the bill?
   Q: Well, I know that _ I think that the secretary will abide by
the decision that I have made. He had some questions and he had
some concerns of what might result from vetoing. And I have to say
that the preponderance, however, of belief, and that from our own
people in the legislature, was that the faults and flaws outweighed
any of the concerns that were expressed by a few others.
   Q: But does this mean that Mr. Carlucci is soft on defense and
for a weak defense?
   A: Oh, no.
   Q: As you've accused the sponsors of the bill of doing?
   A: No, not at all. No, not at all. He's doing a fine job, and as
I say, I think you'll find that he is supportive of the action
we've taken.
   Q: Mr. President.
   MARLIN FITZWATER: Frank, let's take _ let's take a final
question here. Frank, go ahead.
   Q: He called on me, Marlin. Marlin, he called on me.
   REAGAN: I had just ...
   FITZWATER: All right, go ahead.
   REAGAN: All right.
   Q: Mr. President, what has been Vice President Bush's role in
the two decisions _ yesterday's decision not to veto the
plant-closing bill, and today's decision to veto the defense
authorization measure?
   A: I think you'd find that we were in complete agreement in both
of these instances.
   Q: Did he advise you?
   A: What?
   Q: To take both of these courses?
   A: Well, I know whether he agrees or disagrees on things, and he
has been very careful of whether he seems to be overstepping or not
in his present position. But, he's been a part, not only of these,
but he's been a part of every other major undertaking of our
administration.
   Q: But you can't tell us what his advice was?
   Q Mr. President, on the subject _ on the subject of Vice
President Bush, if I may.
   FITZWATER: Let's take one final question, Frank.
   REAGAN: He _ all right. Is that the one we're taking?
   FITZWATER: That's the one.
   REAGAN: All right. You see how well we get along here.
   Q: On the subject of Vice President Bush, both your
plant-closing yesterday and today's DOD authorization veto hinged
not only on advice and counsel from the vice president, but also on
what you and your advisers felt would help him politically. But,
I'm interested in what your explanation is for his great deficit in
the polls. You have gone out of your way to say that he's been an
active vice president, but apparently the American people don't buy
that, or if they do, they don't like what they see.
   A: Well, you all are aware of the power of the media and the
power of the press. Maybe it has to do something with the fact that
for quite some considerable time now, ever since the decision was
recognized as final on the Democratic side, their candidate has
been getting several times as much space and time in the press and
the media than the vice president has. Now, maybe when our
convention takes place and there's going to be some coverage of
that, maybe we'll see a change coming.
   Q: Mr. President.
   A: I would think that a change would begin to come when the
campaign really gets under way and we reveal how many falsehoods
have been spread among the people by the opposition.
   Q: On the coverage.
   Q: Mr. President.
   FITZWATER: Thank you.
   Q: Mr. President, if that's all there is _ give us a chance.
   FITZWATER: Thank you, Mr. President.
   Q: Do you feel that Michael Dukakis ...
   Q: Come on.
   Q: Should make his medical records public? He has refused to
make his medical records public _ the first official for high
office since Eagleton in 1972. He has had is campaign
representatives call up, unsolicited phone calls to newspapers,
saying he never had psychiatric care. He walked away from a
question about that last Friday. Do you think that the American
people deserve to know whether he's fit to govern by having his
medical records made public?
   A: Look, I'm not going to pick on an invalid.
   Q: Mr. President, why shouldn't we.
   Q: An invalid in what sense, sir?
   Q: Why shouldn't we have.
   A: I think that he has told you that that was the last question.
   Q: What do you base that remark on?
   Q: Invalid in what sense, though?
   Q: You know more about what public opinion wants in the way of
defense than the Congress, which spent six months.
   Q: Get that down.
   Q: Making compromises and taking testimony from military and
other experts. Why do you think you know more? Don't you think the
public opinion in this country may have changed from wanting all
our money for the Defense Department to making some of that money
be more balanced and go for other programs?
   A: I say, I can't take any further questions and you're
absolutely right, I did stay.
   Q: You can't take any more questions! Why can't you?
   A: Down in front. Maybe I'll start taking some further back.
   Q: That's a good question.
   Q: Mr. President, why shouldn't we unfreeze those assets if it
would mean getting the hostages out?
   Q: Why are we being _ standing so tough on Iran?
   A: Because we're trying to bring peace in the
   Middle East.
   Q: Why can't you take my question?
   Q: In what way is Mr. Dukakis an invalid?
   A: I can't.
   Q: You answered hers. Why can't you answer mine.
   Q: What did you mean by invalid?
   A: It's over. I got to go to work.

   The temperatures are in the 90s, the humidity is
brutal, and the beaches are closed. All in all, Lester Rawitz
figures, a pretty good New York summer.
   ``This is the biggest year I ever recall. We're completely
cleaned out,'' said Rawitz, a Manhattan air conditioner retailer
for the past 34 years, speaking from his air-conditioned office.
``There's no question it's been good.''
   Good for Rawitz; good and hot for almost everybody else. On 13
occasions last month, the mercury climbed above 90 degrees; in an
average New York July, the temperature breaks 90 just seven times.
The forecast for the current week calls for temperatures to crack
100.
   ``If we didn't get two weeks with a tremendous amount of rain,
it would have been extremely warm last month,'' said National
Weather Service meteorologist Joe Harrison, pausing for a moment.
``Not that it wasn't warm enough.''
   How hot was it?
   Hot enough to make the asphalt mushy, making city streets like
flypaper; hot enough to make people look forward to riding the
subway, where at least there's air conditioning; hot enough to be
the ninth hottest July since the weather service began keeping
track in the 1860s.
   The temperature-humidity index is considered ``uncomfortable for
everyone'' when it reaches 79; on Monday and Tuesday, it broke 80.
   ``I've used my air conditioner more in the last month than I
have in my whole life,'' said Martha Lipfert, a public relations
worker for Consolidated Edison. ``I'm sure I'm not the only one,
either.''
   Worst of all, there has been no relief at the beaches.
   As temperatures climbed, so did the number of beaches closed by
waves of medical waste and other garbage. Other beaches were closed
when sewage escaped from a Staten Island treatment plant.
   ``The heat and humidity have been stifling. I can't remember a
summer like this in the 12 years I've been here,'' said Joseph
Lecinski, supervisor of Jones Beach State Park. Despite that,
Lecinski says crowds are off about 50 percent on the beaches.
   At Jones Beach, there were 865,000 visitors in July 1988; the
year before, there were 1.75 million. At Robert Moses State Park,
attendance was down to 366,000 from 650,000. It was the same story
at the Gateway National Recreation Beaches: Riis Park, down to
515,000 from 1,079,740, and Great Kills, 10,071 from 23,450.
   There were no attendance figures at city fire hydrants, which
desperate city dwellers opened for relief, but the city received
6,431 calls reporting such ``beach parties.''
   ``People are sweltering in their apartments because they can't
go to the beach,'' said Andrew McCarthy of the Department of
Environmental Conservation, which oversees the hydrants.
   That hasn't kept baseball fans at home. At Shea Stadium, the New
York Mets have drawn crowds of more then 45,000 for each of the
last five days, including sell-outs for four games against the
second-place Pittsburgh Pirates this past weekend.
   The heat may be keeping people away from other city attractions
_ about 6,000 fewer tourists went to the Statue of Liberty last
month compared to July 1987.
   In midtown Manhattan, the city's ban on street vendors made it
difficult for sweat-soaked pedestrians to grab a Dove Bar or find
the Good Humor man.
   As a result, many New Yorkers turned to the great indoors for
relief: A tour of midtown taverns on Tuesday showed a heavy turnout
of visitors escaping the heat and enjoying a cold brew or two.
   ``It's been packed in here all day,'' said bartender John
McDermott of McAnn's between trips to the beer taps Tuesday
afternoon. ``From what I hear, tomorrow's going to be worse.''
   The temperature climbed into the 90s again on Wednesday, which
meant another day off for the horses which pull carriages in
Central Park. It was another day for tourists to sit in the spray
of a fountain outside the Exxon Building, and for Lester Rawitz to
smile inside the offices of Economy National Sales Inc.
   ``I just got a call from a woman in Washington, wants us to send
an air conditioner to her mother up here,'' Rawitz said. ``The last
six weeks _ just constant demand.''

   The Women Only spa won't be so any more under
a settlement reached in a sex discrimination lawsuit against the
health club.
   Men must give 24 hours notice before using the spa until
membership is at least 10 percent male, attorney Gloria Allred said
Tuesday.
   ``I think it should be made clear to everyone and every business
that wholesale discrimination against any group ... is going to
lead to failure,'' said Anthony Flacco of North Hollywood, who
brought the lawsuit.
   The spa agreed to give Flacco, 38, a free one-year membership
and pay $15,000 in attorney's fees as part of a settlement, said
Ms. Allred, who represented Flacco.
   The settlement ``does not represent a change in Women's Only
commitment to provide a non-threatening private atmosphere for our
10,000 women members to meet their special exercise needs,'' said
Barbara E. Roberts, attorney for the spa.
   Flacco said he wanted to join Women Only's San Fernando Valley
spa because the club he attended was overcrowded.

   The MacNeil-Lehrer NewsHour has secured
corporate funding commitments totaling $57 million over five years,
the producers said Wednesday.
   AT&T, which had been the sole corporate funder of the hourlong
newscast since it began in 1983, joined with PepsiCo and the John
D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation in the commitment to the
1988-92 financing.
   AT&T's share is $36 million for 1988-92, PepsiCo's $15 million
for 1989-92 and the foundation will contribute $6 million for
1988-90.
   The $11 million pledge for the season starting this fall is the
same as the corporate funding for the current season,
MacNeil-Lehrer spokesman Christopher Ramsey said.
   ``We think the major advantage is that when you have stability,
you can plan more effectively,'' Ramsey said. ``What this
guarantees is that public broadcasting will be able to maintain its
uniqueness in the news field.''

   South African proposals for ending the Angolan war
were rejected Wednesday by Angola and Cuba, but the negotiators and
a U.S. mediator agreed to continue talks aimed at reaching a
peaceful settlement.
   Two U.S. officials suggested that South Africa broke
confidentiality rules set for the secret talks by providing details
to the media.
   The negotiations, now in their fifth round and scheduled to end
Thursday, have come closer to reaching agreement than any in the
past.
   The proposals, disclosed by Foreign Minister Pik Botha in
Pretoria, called for a cease-fire in Angola's 13-year-old to begin
Wednesday, set timetables for foreign troop withdrawals, and called
for free elections in South-West Africa, commonly known as Namibia,
on June 1, 1989.
   Cuba dismissed the timetable proposals as ``preposterous and
unrealistic'' and said they constituted an ``outdated attempt to
revive the linkage between the independence of Namibia and the
Cuban presence in Angola.''
   The Angolan delegation, in a less vociferous statement, said the
proposals did ``not reflect the spirit of prior agreements'' and
vowed the Marxist government ``will not negotiate away Angola's
sovereignty and independence.''
   Botha's move evidently caught the chief U.S. mediator, Assistant
Secretary of State Chester Crocker, by surprise and angered him.
   ``We're going to stick to the table, and encourage others to do
the same,'' he told newsmen upon arrival for a new closed-door
meeting.
   Later, a U.S. spokesman who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said that in keeping with ``the ground rules of the negotiations,
the U.S. delegation will state its views at the conference table
and not in the media.''
   ``Many proposals have already been tabled in these negotiations.
There will be more. If we are to achieve a settlement there must be
real give and take leading to compromises acceptable to all
parties,'' he added.
   The public controversy contrasted with the upbeat assessments on
July 20 when the three nations said in New York they had accepted
an unprecedented joint document listing 14 ``principles'' as a
basis for a peace settlement.
   Botha said that if the cease-fire were accepted, South Africa
would withdraw its estimated 3,000 troops from southern Angola by
Sept. 10.
   The South Africans support the anti-Marxist UNITA rebels of
Jonas Savimbi who also receive U.S. arms aid.
   South Africa also proposed to start Nov. 1 the withdrawal of its
troops from Namibia over which it has retained control in defiance
of several U.N. Security Council resolutions.
   But it also demanded that the 50,000 Cuban troops that have been
helping the Luanda government fight UNITA since 1975 leave Angola
by June 1, the date when South Africa proposed free elections in
Namibia.
   South Africa also called for the dismantling in seven guerrilla
camps which it said were operated in Angola by the African National
Congress, the main black group fighting white rule in South Africa.
   The delicately balanced set of principles agreed on at New York
last month did not mention the ANC's role. Neither did it contain
any reference to UNITA or to SWAPO, the South-West Africa People's
Organization. SWAPO has been waging an armed struggle since 1966 to
end South Africa's hold on Namibia and also is reported to have
bases in Angola.
   The principles would commit the signatories of a peace
settlement not to allow acts of aggression or violence against
other states.

   President Reagan took a swipe at Democratic presidential nominee
Michael Dukakis today, calling him ``an invalid.'' He said later,
``I was trying to be funny and it didn't work.''
   Dukakis, in Boston, reacted in low-key fashion, saying of
Reagan, ``No apology was really needed. We all occasionally
misspeak and I don't think the president needed to apologize.''
   ``I'm a very healthy guy,'' he said.
   Republican Vice President George Bush, meanwhile, touring a
defense plant in Annapolis, Md., said when asked about Reagan's
remark, ``Before I make any comment on what anyone else said, I
want to talk to the president about it. ... I'm not going to be
drawn into this mini-controversy.''
   While Dukakis held his fire, his running mate, Sen. Lloyd
Bentsen of Texas, said Reagan's remarks were ``outrageous and
laughable at the same time.''
   Reagan was responding to a question from a reporter representing
Executive Intelligence Review, a publication associated with
political extremist Lyndon LaRouche. The questioner said Dukakis
had declined to disclose his medical records, particularly whether
he ever has undergone psychiatric treatment.
   A Dukakis spokesman, responding to such questions last week,
said Dukakis had never been treated for any mental condition.
Neither Dukakis nor Bush has released full medical records during
the 1988 campaign, though Bush said today he would release his
records as he did in 1980.
   Dukakis, asked today if he had ever suffered from depression,
said, ``No.'' Asked if he had ever consulted a psychiatrist, he
said, ``No.''
   Asked if would release his records, he said, ``I'll be happy to
provide the people of this country with a full report on my
physical and mental condition from my physician of 17 years.''
   He previously released a report from that doctor, Gerald R.
Plotkin, saying he was in good shape and had suffered no major
medical problems during the period. Before 1971 his only physician
was his father.
   Reagan, smiling, told reporters when asked about Dukakis'
records: ``I'm not going to pick on an invalid.''
   He wouldn't elaborate on what he meant. However, a few minutes
later at a separate appearance, Reagan brought up the subject
again, telling reporters he thought his choice of words had been
unfortunate.
   ``A short time ago, I attempted a joke. I was kidding,'' Reagan
said. Asked if he based his comments on any information he had, he
added, ``I was just trying to be funny and it didn't work.''
   He did say he believes the American people are entitled to know
about a candidate's medical history.
   Talk of treatment of Dukakis first circulated at the Democratic
National Convention in Atlanta two weeks ago after handbills were
slipped under reporters' hotel room doors. They were signed,
``National Democratic Policy Committee,'' a political arm of
LaRouche.
   Asked about the subject last Friday, Dukakis campaign press
secretary Dayton Duncan said, ``He hasn't been treated for any
mental illness or mental depression of any kind.'' Asked if that
precluded any form of psychological therapy or counseling, Duncan
said, ``Yes.''
   Dukakis, in Boston to carry out state business, was focusing on
education and the war on drugs, meeting with out-of-state school
commissioners and naming a new director of his model Governor's
Alliance Against Drugs.
   Dukakis, the son of highly successful Greek immigrants, also was
receiving President George Vassilious of Cyprus late this
afternoon. The visit comes two days after the Cypriot chief of
state met with President Reagan to discuss the 14-year conflict
between the island's Turks and majority Greeks.
   But despite Dukakis' facility with languages and inspiring story
as the son of immigrants who achieved the American dream, it was
Bush who most recently made an overture to hyphenated Americans.
   Describing himself as a ``nice WASP,'' or White Anglo-Saxon
Protestant, Bush told a group of followers from ethnic backgrounds,
``He can speak Spanish, but I can speak our language of ethnic
values and pride, everlasting pride in the United States of
America.''
   In his remarks to the Bush '88 Coalition of American
Nationalities, Bush focused on the intense patriotism and support
of such conservative social issues like voluntary school prayer and
the death penalty as popular among recently new Americans.
   But if Bush was claiming the ethnic constituency, Dukakis was
claiming anew that the Reagan era is over, at least in Congress.
   Dukakis says Congress forced Reagan to allow plant-closing
legislation to become law, and he said the action proved that
Democrats were controlling the nation's agenda. He said that
victory and progress on a related trade measure, catastrophic
illness legislation and raising the minimum wage has ``a great deal
to do with the attitude of the American people that they want
something different.''
   ``Even though Ronald Reagan still occupies the White House, we
can safely say Michael Dukakis has just signed into law his first
bill as president,'' added Rep. Tony Coelho, D-Calif., the House
Majority Whip, saying the pendulum has swung away from the
conservative agenda.
   Bush said of the measure: ``I think the president made a good
decision, and that matter is now resolved and now we can get the
focus where it belongs, on plant openings.''
   In Chicago, Bush suggested that development of the
administration's Strategic Defense Initiative might be critical to
Israel's security. In a remark directly challenging Dukakis, he
said, ``It is one thing to say you are committed to Israel's
security, but in an age of ballistic missiles, if you are against
defensive systems such as SDI, that slogan has little meaning.''

   The Knights of Columbus have
doubled to $20 million their special fund to help Pope John Paul II
cope with the Vatican's rising operating deficit.
   The Vatican has projected a potential shortfall of nearly $20
million for the current year, following similar deficits reported
for several years.
   At its annual convention here, the Catholic fraternal service
organization voted Tuesday to add another $10 million to its $10
million ``Vicar of Christ'' fund established in 1981 to boost papal
finances.
   Earnings from the endowment, which have been more than $1
million annually and which now are expected to be twice that, are
turned over to the pope to support Vatican activities.
   Virgil C. Dechant, supreme knight of the 1.5 million-member
organization which has headquarters in New Haven, Conn., expressed
hope the initiative would prompt others to assist the Vatican
funding.

   President Reagan today referred to Michael
Dukakis as ``an invalid'' in a barbed comment on the health of the
Democratic presidential nominee. He later said he'd been joking
``but I don't think I should have said what I said.''
   ``No apology was really needed,'' Dukakis said. ``We all

   ``I'm a very healthy guy,'' he declared to reporters in Boston.
   Dukakis' running mate, Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, called

   Vice President George Bush, Dukakis' presidential rival, said he
wanted to talk to Reagan before commenting. He added, ``I'm not
going to be drawn into this mini-controversy.''
   The president was responding to a reporter representing
Executive Intelligence Review, a publication associated with
political extremist Lyndon LaRouche. The questioner, asking whether
Dukakis shouldn't release his medical records, said the Democratic
candidate had not done so, particularly whether he had ever
undergone psychiatric treatment.
   A Dukakis spokesman, responding to such questions last week,
said Dukakis had never been treated for any mental condition.

   Reagan said that he believes the American people are entitled to
know about a candidate's medical history.
   Rumors that a news organization was about to publish a story on
the subject of possible treatment of Dukakis circulated last week
as he campaigned through several states.
   When asked by reporters at that time, campaign press secretary
Dayton Duncan denied that Dukakis had ever undergone psychiatric
treatment.
   ``He hasn't been treated for any mental illness or mental
depression of any kind,'' Duncan said.
   Asked if that meant Dukakis had never seen a psychiatrist for
treatment, Duncan said, ``Yes.'' Asked if that also precluded any
form of psychological therapy or counseling, Duncan said, ``Yes.''
   Talk of such treatment first circulated at the Democratic
National Convention in Atlanta two weeks ago after handbills were
slipped under reporters' hotel room doors. They were signed,
``National Democratic Policy Committee,'' a political arm of
LaRouche.
   In Boston, Dukakis' deputy Statehouse press secretary, Stephen
Crawford, said, ``We have no comment.''
   Earlier in his news conference, Reagan sought to shrug off poll
results that show Vice President George Bush trailing Dukakis.
   Reagan said that is explained by the news coverage given Dukakis
and last month's Democratic National Convention.
   ``Their candidate has been getting several times the space and
time in the media,'' Reagan said.

<TEXT>
   Perhaps the summer's a bust when it gets too hot
to swim in Lake Michigan. Welcome to the Heat Wave of '88, Chicago
style.
   ``We call it burnout. The people just get too much sun and they
want to run and hide,'' says Harry Gillespie, supervisor of the
city's 31 beaches. ``The sand is too hot and the lake's only 75
degrees. The intense heat is driving people off the beach.''
   Chicago has been fiery, sultry, stifling, stuffy, sweltering,
torrid, tropical _ and all of the above. It's hard to find a
``hot'' adjective that isn't getting overworked.
   Through Wednesday, there were 35 days of temperatures at 90 or
above, and seven days at the century mark or higher, leaving in the
dust the record of four 100-degree days in a single summer, set in
1934, 1947 and 1953.
   Residents wonder if the devil's lair is cooler than the Windy
City.
   ``I'm exhausted,'' traffic Officer Gloria Boozer said as she
trudged to a downtown corner for another day of whistle-blowing and
arm-waving amid overheated drivers. ``When it comes to the weather
report, I try not to hear it.''
   No problem there. The weather hasn't changed much all summer,
leaving TV forecasters little to offer but bad news.
   ``I've been lonely, hiding from everybody,'' says Jerry Taft,
meteorologist at WLS, an ABC-owned television station.
   ``You can only report what's going to happen but people blame
you, tongue-in-cheek. You do get a little grief.
   ``If you're an ego-freak weatherman, then it's a good time. They
tend to get you on earlier in the show,'' Taft said. ``I'm not into
that.''
   With temperatures up and air conditioners churning at all hours,
records for electricity demand are toppling. Commonwealth Edison
Co., supplier of power to Chicago and most of northern Illinois,
used 17.01 million kilowatts Tuesday and was left with a 1 percent
reserve margin.
   ``If you look at Edison's top 16 peak demands, all but three
were set this summer,'' said spokeswoman Debbie Vestal. ``The peaks
we've hit are peaks we didn't think we'd have for five more years.''
   Edison has six nuclear plants with two reactors at each site.
Eleven of the 12 reactors have been producing power full time with
one down for maintenance, Ms. Vestal said.
   Ask Chicagoans about the heat and they're either miserable or
resigned. At the Chicago Christian Industrial League, a relief
agency on the West Side that helps some of the city's estimated
25,000 homeless, Richard Roberts tries to soothe parched throats.
   ``It's been horrific. With the stress of no home and high heat,
you have people here who might end up as statistics at the Cook
County morgue,'' Roberts said.
   ``We've set up ice-water tanks on the sidewalk. Unfortunately,
some people have been stealing our tanks,'' he said. ``I don't call
the police. If it's stolen, then somebody needs it.
   ``You know,'' Roberts said, ``you see the news accounts of the
people on the North Shore playing tennis and sweating profusely and
how it's affecting their backhand volley. Oh, it hits my wrenching
heart.''
   Carlos Bedraza, 35, a downtown bicycle messenger who makes 35
stops on his daily rounds, says he copes by drinking a lot of water
and trying to ``lay off the fatty stuff.''
   ``I just had chicken salad,'' Bedraza said. ``When I'm riding I
get hot when I have to stop. The air keeps me cool. I can deal with
this.''
   Then there's Jack Cannan, 23, of nearby Calumet City, who was
spotted earlier this week by a downtown sculpture, sweaty,
shirtless _ and loving every minute of a sizzling summer.
   ``My philosophy is `white ain't right,''' he said, referring to
his bronzed body. ``Be good to the sun and it will be good to you.''

<HEAD>Impeachment Defendants Form a Rogue's Gallery of Public Officials</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   WASHINGTON _ If someone formed a rogue's gallery of public
officials, they might start with some of the defendants in
impeachment proceedings. They cheated on their taxes. They planned
revolutions. They used their positions for personal gain. They
threatened to jail their critics.
   Impeachment is the process provided by the Constitution by which
Congress can remove public officials for misconduct. These include
federal judges, who cannot be fired because they have lifetime
appointments.
   The House has adopted impeachment articles for only 15
officials, including U.S. District Judge Alcee L. Hastings of
Miami, who was impeached on Wednesday by a 413-3 vote.
   Impeachment is the equivalent of an indictment, and sends the
case to the Senate for trial. The House acts by majority vote, but
a two-thirds vote is required for conviction by the Senate and
removal from office.
   The impeachment process has involved victims of political
intrigue as well as genuine scoundrels.
   The last case ended in October 1986, when the Senate ousted U.S.
District Judge Harry E. Claiborne of Las Vegas in the first
impeachment trial in 50 years. Claiborne was serving a prison term
for tax evasion, but had refused to resign and continued to draw
his salary.
   President Andrew Johnson was impeached by the House in 1868,
after running afoul of Radical Republicans in Congress during the
troubled period after the Civil War. He escaped Senate conviction
by one vote.
   Judge George W. English of Illinois resigned before his
scheduled impeachment trial, and his case was dismissed. The House
had accused English in 1926 of profanely denouncing state and local
official in open court, and telling jurors they would be jailed if
a particular defendant was not convicted.
   Officials can be impeached under the Constitution for ``treason,
bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.''
   The first two offenses are easy to recognize. But ``high crimes
and misdemeanors'' are more ambiguous. Although they may not be
criminal offenses, they generally involve conduct that undermines
the U.S. government's integrity.
   Twelve of the 15 defendants impeached by the House have been
judges. The others were a U.S. senator, a secretary of war and
Johnson.
   There have been 12 Senate trials. Two defendants resigned prior
to Senate action, and the remaining case is that of Hastings.
   The first impeachment case was brought against Sen. William
Blount of Tennessee. A former commissioner of Indian affairs, he
was accused of trying to organize Indians and frontiersmen as part
of a pro-British armed attack on Spanish territory.
   Blount was acquitted in 1799 on grounds that a senator is not
subject to impeachment. But by then, the Senate had already
expelled Blount by a 25-1 vote.
   A fellow Tennessean, federal judge West H. Humphreys, wasn't so
lucky with his revolution.
   He was convicted by a 38-0 vote in 1862, because he, ``along
with other evil-minded persons,'' supported his state's secession
from the Union.
   In 1803, the House charged Judge John Pickering of New Hampshire
with permitting delivery of a ship to a claimant while U.S. agents
were trying to condemn the vessel and its cargo for customs
violations.
   But another impeachment charge told the real story. It described
the judge as ``a man of loose morals and intemperate habits,'' who
appeared on the bench ``in a state of intoxication ... and there
frequently, in a most profane and indecent manner, (invoked) the
name of the Supreme Being.''
   The Senate convicted Pickering in 1804 after his son testified
that the judge had been ``wholly deranged'' with a disorder that
``has baffled all medical aid.''
   On the day of Pickering's conviction, the House voted its only
impeachment of a Supreme Court justice, Samuel Chase. The Senate
subsequently acquitted Chase of charges that he violated a
defendant's rights in a treason trial.
   War Secretary William W. Belknap's impeachment in 1876 followed
congressional investigations of corruption in the Grant
administration.
   Belknap quit just hours before the House charged him with taking
bribe money for the appointment of a military post trader, but the
Senate proceeded with a trial anyway.
   A majority of senators _ but fewer than the necessary two-thirds
_ voted for conviction on all four charges. However, 22 senators
said they voted for acquittal only because they believed Belknap's
resignation should have ended the case.
   Others impeached by the House:
   -Judge James H. Peck of Missouri in 1830 on charges stemming
from his handling of a land claims case. He was acquitted by the
Senate, 22-21.
   _Judge Mark Delahay in 1873. The House contended his ``personal
habits unfitted him for the judicial office, that he was
intoxicated off the bench as well as on the bench.'' He resigned
after the House vote, and the case ended.
   -Judge Charles Swayne of Florida in 1904. Charged with
submitting false expense accounts, among other things, he was
acquitted on all counts by the Senate.
   -Judge Robert Archbald of Pennsylvania in 1912. He was convicted
by the Senate on five impeachment articles. Charges included
obtaining credit from litigants, attempting to influence legal
actions before the Interstate Commerce Commission for a financial
consideration and using his judgeship to enter into profitable
business deals.
   -Judge Harold Louderback of California, impeached in 1933 on
charges he showed favoritism in bankruptcy cases. He was acquitted
by the Senate.
   _Judge Halsted L. Ritter of Florida, impeached in 1936 and
convicted by the Senate. The House accused Ritter of dramatically
increasing the fee received by a former law partner whom the judge
had appointed as a receiver in a bankruptcy case. Ritter also was
charged with failing to pay income taxes for two years.

<HEAD>New Maps Help Blind Visitors Find Way Around Capital</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto WX6</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Blind and visually impaired visitors now can
rely on an unusual new set of maps to get their bearings around the
monuments and landmarks of the nation's capital.
   The tactile maps, carrying legends in both English and Braille,
were produced under a $150,000 federal contract by Joseph W.
Wiedel, a geographer-cartographer at the University of Maryland.
   The maps, intended for free distribution through congressional
offices, are 14-by-19-inch plastic sheets that depict such
landmarks as the Lincoln Memorial, the White House and the
Washington Monument as bumps shaped like their actual contours.
   The maps cover the Mall, Capitol Hill, Arlington Cemetery, the
Iwo Jima Memorial and other sights, as well as the floor plan of
the U.S. Capitol.
   A separate map and smaller pocket guide covers the Metro rapid
transit system. Different geometric shapes let vision-impaired
visitors know not only the subway stops but what side of the
platform the train comes in on.
   About $85,000 of the contract went to produce six larger display
modules of the maps which will be placed around Washington, and 20
traveling exhibits that will be lent to libraries and other places
around the country.
   George Covington, a legally blind Interior Department official
who directed the ``Tactile Capital'' project, said, ``These maps
are unique. There are no others like them in the world right now.''
   The project was financed by the Education Department's National
Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research.
   Madeleine Will, an assistant secretary of education, said the
maps ``set a standard for other cities and help to make Washington,
D.C., the most accessible capital in the world.''
   Covington said the maps, faithful to the actual scale of the
streets and landmarks of Washington and its environs, are designed
more to give blind or visually impaired people their bearings than
to guide them every foot of the way.
   ``It's not intended for a blind person to show up in the middle
of the Mall and instantly know where everything is,'' said
Covington, who has only 5 percent vision in one eye. ``But if you
come out of the Longworth Building, you'll know that the Capitol is
in front of you and the Rayburn Building is off to your left.''
   The map's muted colors of beige, green, blue and gray were
chosen to show up as shades of gray for those who are color-blind,
he said.
   The contract covered production of 9,200 plastic maps, plus
5,000 additional Metro maps on paper.
   Besides copies to be given away by congressional offices, Senate
officials have made the maps available for borrowing at all public
entrances to the Capitol and at the guide desk in the Rotunda.
   Covington said the maps can be purchased for $2.50 to $4 apiece
from Joseph W. Wiedel, Room 1167, Lefrak Hall, Department of
Geography, University of Maryland, College Park, Md. 20742.

<HEAD>Judge Suspends $1 Fine for Ex-Cancer Patient Convicted of Pot
Possession</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PAINTSVILLE, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge Wednesday suspended a $1 fine
against a former cancer patient convicted of possessing marijuana
he says he used to counter the side effects of his treatment.
   Johnson District Judge John A. Gardner also took under
advisement a motion to void the conviction of Rick Morris, 31, of
Van Lear if Morris completes a drug treatment program.
   Morris was convicted Friday of possessing 7{ ounces of marijuana
last November despite his contention that he was forced to smoke
the drug or die of starvation associated with the effects of
radiation treatments and chemotherapy.
   ``It's kind of weird how important that $1 became to us,''
Morris' lawyer, Ned Pillersdorf, said Wednesday. ``It was blood
money.''
   Gardner rejected another defense request to issue an acquittal
for Morris, Pillersdorf said. The lawyer said he argued that the
prosecutor had not rebutted defense testimony that Morris was
confronted with a ``choice of evils,'' of either smoking pot or
death.
   A cancerous tumor was discovered wrapped around Morris' brain
stem in March 1987, according to testimony in the case.
   Morris and his mother, Jo Ann Morris, both testified that his
weight dropped from nearly 200 pounds before the treatments to
below 125 pounds when the therapy concluded at the beginning of
August 1987.
   Morris remained seriously ill after the treatments and even the
smell of food brought vomiting, Pillersdorf said. Although Morris
tried other drugs aimed at reducing nausea, marijuana was by far
the most effective, he said.
   The case marked the first time in the nation that a cancer
patient had used a medical defense in a marijuana possession case,
said Bob Randall, president of the Alliance of Cannibis
Therapeutics, a group pursuing legalization of the substance for
medical use.

<HEAD>Young Foes Take Heart From Casino Ban; Missouri Lottery Officials
Rejoice</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE SILVERMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Detroit's rejection of casino gambling proves voters don't all
``walk in lockstep'' with Mayor Coleman Young, an opponent said,
while Missouri's lottery chief rejoiced at passage of an amendment
aimed at boosting sagging sales.
   In other voting Tuesday, Missouri state Rep. Betty Hearnes _
wife of a former governor _ won the Democratic nomination to oppose
Republican Gov. John Ashcroft, and former Michigan congressman Jim
Dunn won a GOP primary battle for a chance to face Democratic Sen.
Donald Riegle.
   Elsewhere in Missouri, Democratic voters handed Rep. Richard
Gephardt the nomination for a seventh term, and sent farm activist
Wayne Cryts into a November rematch against Republican Rep. Bill
Emerson.
   In Kansas, GOP Rep. Jan Meyers easily fended off a primary
challenge from Charles B. ``Bat'' Masterson, a retired school
adminstrator.
   In Detroit, with all precincts reporting, an ordinance outlawing
casinos was approved 82,271 to 50,890, or 62 percent to 38 percent.
   Young has long advocated a plan for construction of 12 casino
hotels, which would be taxed at a rate of 13 percent to raise money
for neighborhood development, improved police protection and a tax
cut.
   ``We want revitalization, but we do not want the crime and all
that goes with it,'' said Tom Barrow, president of Citizens for
Detroit's Future.
   He said the vote showed ``all black people do not walk in
lockstep with what Coleman Young says,'' said Barrow, who like
Young is black.
   Barrow challenged the mayor's last re-election bid and is
expected to try again next year, when Young is likely to run for a
fifth term.
   It is possible the ordinance could be challenged as an
unconstitutional attempt by a city to supersede state law. Gambling
cannot become legal without action by the state Legislature.
   The Missouri measure allows lottery officials to spend more on
prizes and advertising to compete with neighboring lotteries, which
have been making inroads into local sales.
   ``It's like the sun's come out after a long rain,'' Mike Morris,
the lottery's executive director, said Wednesday. ``Now it's our
job to deliver a fun, entertaining lottery to the people.''
   The first games that feature more prizes _ totaling 50 percent
of sales, instead of 45 percent _ are to begin in mid-September.
Under the original restrictions, advertisements had to include
disclaimers saying they were not intended to induce people to play.
Voters removed those restrictions.
   With 96 percent of precincts reporting, 455,068 voters, or 57
percent, had voted in favor and 337,182, or 43 percent, voted
against the amendment.
   Mrs. Hearnes, 61, whose husband, Warren, was governor from
1965-73, will attempt to become Missouri's first woman governor by
unseating Ashcroft, who did not face a primary.
   With 97 percent of precincts reporting, Mrs. Hearnes had 368,390
votes, or 81 percent, and Lavoy ``Zaki'' Reed, a St. Louis-area
teacher, had 84,123 votes, or 19 percent.
   Gephardt, who dropped his presidential bid just before the
deadline to file for re-election, won 82 percent of the vote
against three little-known Democrats. He will face Thor Hearne, a
former Education Department official who won the GOP primary.
   Cryts, who became a folk hero in 1981 when he took his family's
soybeans from a padlocked, bankrupt grain elevator, also swamped
three opponents. He lost narrowly to Emerson in 1986.
   In Michigan, Dunn defeated Robert Huber _ like him, a former
congressman and a millionaire _ for a chance to face Riegle, who
had no primary opposition in his bid for a third term. With all
precincts reporting, Dunn had 244,909 votes, or 61 percent, to
Huber's 159,616, or 39 percent.
   ``Don Riegle has been representing Michigan in Washington for 22
years,'' Dunn said. ``He's done very well for himself ... He's
accumulated power and wealth. I just have one question to ask the
voters of the state of Michigan: How have you done over the last 22
years?''
   Riegle, regarded as one of the nation's most liberal senators,
responded that he would campaign ``on the issues in Michigan,
issues that affect families, working families in particular,
day-care, education, home ownership.
   ``I've been very aggressive in fighting for Michigan,'' he said,
``and that's what people want and that's what's needed for
Michigan.''

   Only the camels at the Ohio State Fair,
one of the largest fairs in North America, weren't suffering from
the heat and drought. Less exotic livestock had to be hosed down,
and the vegetables hardly looked like prize-winners.
   ``This is the worst display I have ever had,'' Tony Misich of
Clinton, near Akron in northeast Ohio, said of his produce. ``I've
had nothing but trouble this year.''
   The effects of the nation's worst drought in more than 50 years
were apparent as the Ohio State Fair prepared to open Thursday for
an 18-day run, making it the longest-running fair in the nation
this year.
   It will have 69,000 exhibits and the world's largest midway,
with an estimated 100 rides, said spokesman Shane Jenkins.
   The temperature Wednesday, reaching 89 degrees by noon, was a
steamy reminder of weeks of heat and too little rain, and the
forecast for Thursday and possibly beyond was no better: 95-100
degrees with high humidity.
   Fair officials said despite the summer's drought, they do not
anticipate any drop in attendance or the number of agricultural
exhibitors. But those displaying their fruits, vegetables and
livestock concede that they are not up to the standards of the past.
   Misich said his potatoes, cucumbers, green peppers and onions
are not only smaller than normal but do not look as good as others
he has displayed in his 10 years at the fair.
   The neighboring display of cabbage, potatoes, squash, pumpkins,
melons and green peppers by grower Francis Byers looked slightly
better, an observation he welcomed with a grin.
   ``The rain in the last couple of weeks made all the
difference,'' said Byers of Greenville, about 30 miles northwest of
Dayton. ``But it's still not like normal. That cabbage is big, but
it gets a lot bigger than that.''
   Across the fairgrounds in the Cattle Barn, 18-year-old Rob Pence
of Piqua, north of Dayton, and his father, Richard, were fighting
nature and a power outage in their efforts to keep Rob's beef cows,
Spuds and McKenzie, cool.
   ``They're not too bad this year. They're a good size,'' said Rob
Pence, who raised the pair as a 4-H project. ``At least they've got
hair.''
   Pence and other 4-H members in the barn planned to stay near
their animals around the clock to make sure they keep cool, using
electric fans hooked up to generators. Most exhibitors were hosing
or spraying their cows to beat the heat.
   John James of Mount Gilead, who stood watch over the beef cow
raised by his 18-year-old daughter, Kindra, was worried for the
animal because he said cows do not eat well in intense heat.
   ``If they go off feed, you got to work with them a lot more,''
he said.
   But the three camels in an exotic-animal display seemed
oblivious to the brutal heat. The ``ships of the desert'' being
shown by Bob Jones Attractions basked in the sun and calmly ogled
passers-by.
   ``They like it, it's just like the desert,'' said one of their
keepers.

<HEAD>Government Lawyers Ask to See Presidential Assailant's Papers</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Government lawyers want to see John Hinckley's
correspondence with convicted mass murderer Theodore Bundy and
other materials before the man who shot President Reagan is allowed
to leave a mental hospital on a day trip.
   Prosecutors said they need to review the materials so they will
be able to ask pertinent questions about a conclusion by officials
at St. Elizabeths Hospital here that Hinckley would benefit from a
supervised, recreational outing.
   Hospital officials have suggested that Hinckley might benefit
from a day outing that might include bowling or a picnic. U.S.
District Court Judge Barrington Parker has scheduled a hearing on
the proposal Aug. 9.
   In a court motion filed late Tuesday and released Wednesday,
prosecutors said they need to see Hinckley's letters, including
correspondence with Bundy, who is awaiting execution in Florida, to
``cross-examine the hospital's interpretation of relevant facts.''
   Other materials include a letter Hinckley received from Lynette
``Squeaky'' Fromme, who was convicted of trying to assassinate
President Ford.
   One of Hinckley's psychiatrists also indicated Hinckley had
sought the address of Charles Manson from an unidentified person,
the motion said. Manson led a California cult that killed several
people; Fromme was one of his followers.
   Revelations about Hinckley's correspondence surfaced in April
1987 when the government successfully opposed a plan by St.
Elizabeths to allow Hinckley to spend an Easter vacation with his
parents.
   At the time, Parker refused to allow prosecutors to read the
materials, though they were seen by the court and doctors at St.
Elizabeths.
   ``In short, all parties except the government have had an
opportunity to examine the materials,'' the motion said.
   But prosecutors said they need to look at Hinckley's letters
because they are important and apparently prompted hospital
officials to cancel the proposed Easter event. ``The hospital, as
soon as the materials were discovered, realized their potential
relevance,'' the motion said.
   The Secret Service opposed the outing in a July 19 letter to
Parker.
   Hinckley, who shot and wounded Reagan and three other men on
March 31, 1981, was acquitted by reason of insanity. He has been at
St. Elizabeths since 1982.

   Frank E. Staggers Sr. has been installed as
the new president of the National Medical Association, one of the
nation's oldest black professional organizations.
   Staggers, of Oakland, was installed as the group's 87th
president at a gathering of 1,500 black physicians in Los Angeles.
   While association members meet this week, they plan to form
policy statements on such issues as AIDS, teen pregnancy and
pediatrics, Lillian Calhoun, a convention spokeswoman, said Tuesday.
   Staggers told colleagues that black physicians need to form a
coordinated policy to deliver the best health care to their
patients.
   ``As NMA president, I will be adressing those issues and my
other goals will be to address the challenges that impact the black
family, especially the young black male,'' Staggers said in a
statement.
   He said the greatest health crisis confronting the black
community is that the health of young black men is threatened by
drug abuse, violence and AIDS.
   A native of Charleston, S.C., Staggers is married to California
Assemblywoman Teresa P. Hughes.

   Former U.S. Rep. Barbara Jordan,
hospitalized after nearly drowning, talked politics over breakfast
Wednesday, a hospital spokeswoman said.
   Carolyn Hinckley Boyle said doctors described Ms. Jordan, 52, as
doing ``better _ much stronger, more cheerful.''
   Brackenridge Hospital listed Ms. Jordan in serious but stable
condition, which was unchanged.
   Ms. Jordan underwent tests Tuesday, including brain and chest
X-rays, as well a heart examination known as an echo cardiogram,
Ms. Boyle said.
   Nurse Greg Pfahles quoted Ms. Jordan as saying about the
Democratic presidential ticket, ``This is our year.''
   Ms. Boyle said Pfahles found Ms. Jordan ``fiesty and spunky but
a very pleasant and cooperative patient.''
   Ms. Jordan was hospitalized Saturday after being found floating
face-down in her backyard pool.
   In 1966, she became the first black state senator in Texas
history. In 1972, she was the first Southern black elected to
Congress since Reconstruction, serving until 1978, when she left
politics after three terms in the House to teach at the University
of Texas Lyndon B. School of Public Affairs.

   When Mayor Hattie M. Shelton decided to step
down because of health problems, she agreed to stay on until voters
could pick a successor for the $50 a month job.
   Three elections _ and three tie votes _ later, she's still
waiting.
   Thomas Ledford and Harold Hartman campaigned in the April
election to head the town of 264 residents. They finished in a tie
with 17 votes apiece.
   They tried again in June. The result was 20 votes for Ledford
and 20 for Hartman.
   The mayor's race was on the ballot again in the Missouri primary
election Tuesday. This time: 34 for Hartman, 34 for Ledford.
   ``I can hardly believe it. It just doesn't seem possible that it
could happen again like that,'' said Hartman, 56, a supervisor at a
manufacturing plant in North Kansas City.
   Mrs. Shelton said after Tuesday's vote that she would ask the
Board of Aldermen to wait until the April 1989 election to fill the
post to avoid more money being spent on special elections.
   Ledford, 50, a landscaper, said Wednesday he's not sure what he
and Hartman can do about breaking the tie next time around.
   ``We've been trying to contact as many people as we can. I think
we'll have to talk to everybody in town the next time,'' he said.
The town has 109 registered voters.
   ``We've made the effort and neither of us wants to quit at this
point. We just keep plugging along,'' Ledford said.
   Mosby is about 25 miles northeast of Kansas City.

   Brochures distributed by a concessionaire
at Mesa Verde National Park were made in Japan and a congressman
wants to know why.
   ``Gosh dang, I tell you what, there's something wrong with that,
isn't there?'' said Rep. Ben Nighthorse Campbell, D-Colo. ``We have
real nice printing industries right in the state of Colorado, 20
miles from the front gate of Mesa Verde park.''
   Until recently, visitors to the southwestern Colorado park
received a full-color brochure listing the hotels, restaurants and
campgrounds run by ARA Mesa Verde Co.
   What caught visitors' eyes were three tiny words on the back
page: ``Printed in Japan.''
   In a letter to National Park Service Director William Penn Mott,
Campbell asked why the agency ``is sending taxpayers' money to
overseas producers like Japan?''
   Karen Whitney, agency spokeswoman in Denver, said no tax dollars
went to Japan, because the brochure was not an official parks
publication. The agency produces its official brochures and maps in
Harper's Ferry, W.Va.
   Rather, ARA ordered the brochures through a California printing
company, which in turn subcontracted the job to a Japanese firm,
Whitney said.
   ARA executives did not realize the brochures were printed in
foreign countries until they were delivered, she said.
   ``The California printer said he could get the job done at a
higher quality and a better price in Japan than otherwise,''
Whitney said.
   ARA has changed its regulations to require that subcontractors
be American companies, and it recently received a new supply of
brochures _ printed in Farmington, N.M.

<HEAD>Iran Air Pilot Had Close US Ties, Relative Says</HEAD>

   The pilot of the Iranian airliner shot down by
a U.S. Navy missile over the Persian Gulf last month had close ties
to this country and left behind a 5-year-old American-born
daughter, his sister-in-law told Congress on Wednesday in urging
compensation for his death.
   ``I don't know how the family can explain to her that it was an
American missile that killed her father, said Nahid Sadeghi, who
has lived with her husband in Norman, Okla., since 1973.
   Appealing for U.S. compensation for the families of the 290
people killed on July 3 when Iran Air Flight 655 was shot down over
the gulf, Mrs. Sadeghi told the House Armed Services Committee she
rejects Iran's claim that the aircraft was destroyed deliberately.
   She said she also has no belief in rumors the Iran Air A-300
Airbus was flying a suicide mission against the USS Vincennes.
   ``Let me assure you: This story is just as crazy as Ayatollah
Khomeini's claim that Ronald Reagan shot the Airbus
intentionally,'' she said.
   She said her brother-in-law, Capt. Mosen Rezaian, had been a
pilot for 17 years, had been trained by the Boeing Co. in the
United States and had lived in Texas for two years in the 1970s.
   ``He loved and respected the United States and American
culture,'' she said.
   ``My brother-in-law was in love with flying, with his wife and
with his children,'' she said. ``He loved life. And, as a
professional pilot he understood his responsibility for the lives
of his passengers. He was a good and honest human being.''
   She said Capt. Rezaian and her sister Aryanaz had two daughters
and a son.
   The oldest daughter holds U.S. citizenship because she was born
while her mother was visiting in Norman, Mrs. Sadeghi said.
   The three children and their mother are now living in West
Germany, she said, sent there by Rezaian ``because of the war and
worsening conditions in Iran.''
   ``I strongly urge you to pay compensation to the families of the
victims,'' she said. ``They are human beings _ widows and orphans _
not terrorists who kill and maim.''
   Another witness, Harold G. Maier, a law professor at Vanderbilt
University in Nashville, Tenn., said that while the United States
has no obligation under international law to pay compensation, it
does have a moral obligation.
   He suggested a payment of $75,000 for each of the 290 people
killed, for a total compensation of $21,175,000.
   But Ralph Dupont, an attorney representing the families of two
Americans killed by terrorists during the hijacking of a Kuwaiti
aircraft in 1984, urged that no compensation be made to the
families of those killed on Flight 655 until American victims of
terrorism receive compensation.
   Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the Armed Services panel,
said President Reagan's announcement that the United States is
ready to pay compensation to families of the Airbus victims raises
several questions.
   He said these include the question of whether payments should be
made ``when Iran's surrogates still hold hostages and Iran has
never paid any of the victims of its policies.''
   Rep. Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo., said that while the United
States wants to act in a humanitarian manner, ``we also don't want
to appear naive.''
   She questioned whether it was possible to assure that U.S.
compensation be paid only to the genuine heirs of those who died on
Flight 655 and that they not go into the coffers of the Iranian
government.
   ``We're going to create a teriffic political backfire in this
country if the money goes to the wrong people,'' she said.

   South Africa's offer to
withdraw rapidly from southwestern Africa offers a potential
solution to the region's conflicts, but reactions Wednesday ranged
from skepticism to outright rejection.
   South Africa on Tuesday proposed an Aug. 10 cease-fire in the
Angolan war that would lead to a withdrawal of foreign troops from
Angola and independence for South-West Africa by June 1.
   Angola and Cuba rejected the offer Wednesday, but continued
talks with South African officials and U.S. mediators at peace
talks in Geneva.
   The proposal marked the first time South Africa has offered a
specific date for granting independence to South-West Africa, also
known as Namibia.
   However, the June 1 target date is less than 10 months away and
South Africa has done little to indicate that it intends to give up
the territory it has administered for 73 years.
   When President P.W. Botha made a rare visit to Namibia in April,
he unilaterally strengthened the powers of his appointed
administrator-general, Louis Pienaar.
   Namibian politicians unanimously condemned the action, saying it
showed South Africa wanted to increase its control over the
territory.
   Dirk Mudge, a member of Namibia's Cabinet, said Wednesday that
South Africans have made so many announcements about the future of
the territory ``that one could excuse Namibia's internal parties if
they were skeptical.''
   The leader of the opposition South-West Africa National Union,
Verkuii Rukoro, called the proposal ``a public relations exercise,
probably the most spectacular of the decade.''
   The South African government also may have difficulty selling
the plan to its own citizens, although for different reasons.
   The government long has claimed that South Africa has important
security interests in Namibia and calls the main guerrilla group
fighting for independence a terrorist organization.
   Yet that group _ the South-West African People's Organization or
SWAPO _ is widely seen as the favorite to win free elections in the
territory.
   Many South African whites will probably interpret the Namibian
independence plan as a major concession to militant black groups.
   South Africa's extreme-right Conservative Party called the peace
plan ``nothing other than a dishonorable capitulation.''
   ``The government's surrender in South-West Africa is an
inexorable step in the direction of black majority rule for South
Africa,'' the Conservatives said in a statement.
   South Africa's offer calls for it to withdraw its estimated
3,000 troops from southern Angola by Sept. 1.
   South Africa and the United States back the UNITA rebels, who
seek a power-sharing accord with Angola's Marxist government, which
is supported by 50,000 Cuban troops.
   Under the South African plan, its forces would begin leaving
Namibia on Nov. 1, and the territory would have independent
elections June 1 provided Cuba has withdrawn from Angola.
   Cuba, which has offered to pull out of Angola over a four-year
period, called the offer ``preposterous and unrealistic.''
   The five rounds of talks among South Africa, Cuba, Angola and
the U.S. mediators have focused almost exclusively on the
withdrawal of foreign troops from Angola and independence for
Namibia.
   Even if those issues are resovled, several potential stumbling
blocks remain. They include:
   _ The future of UNITA or the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola. The Angolan guerrilla movement, led by
Jonas Savimbi, has not been directly involved in any of the
negotiations and is unlikely to lay down arms unless it receives a
role in the Angolan government. Angola so far has refused to talk
to UNITA.
   _ African National Congress bases in Angola. South Africa says
the ANC, the main black group fighting to overthrow South Africa's
white-led government, has seven major military bases in Angola, and
it wants those bases closed down. The ANC Wednesday issued a
statement from it headquarters in Lusaka, Zambia, saying the demand
was a ``new roadblock on the path to a peaceful settlement.''
   _ Financial assistance for Namibia. South Africa currently
spends millions of dollars annually on Namibia. South Africa is
looking for someone else to help the territory pay its bills, and
suggested the five permanent members of the United Nations Security
Council.

<HEAD>Paramedic Finds Dying Officer Is Her Brother</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A paramedic called to Golden Gate Park to
aid a policeman accidentally shot in the head by his partner
discovered that the dying man was her brother and that her husband
had loaned him the gun, authorities said.
   Officer James Bloesch, 36, died at San Francisco General
Hospital on Tuesday morning after being shot with the .357-caliber
pistol while examining the gun with his partner.
   His sister, Irene Ager, and her husband, Steven, were in the
closest available ambulance when the call came in from the police
department's stables in Golden Gate Park.
   They were not told the name of the victim. Mrs. Ager, knowing
her brother's work schedule, ``had an inkling it might be her
brother, but she didn't want to believe that feeling,'' said her
supervisor, paramedic Capt. Ronald Louie.
   ``They found (Bloesch) in his dying breath,'' he said Wednesday.
``They did what they had to do as professionals. They performed as
prescribed until someone could take over. No one could have
expected more.''
   On realizing that the officer was her brother, Mrs. Ager called
for a replacement crew, fearing that she and her husband could not
handle their duties, said city Health Department spokeswoman
Beverly Hayon.
   Nonetheless, the Agers helped resuscitation efforts already
under way. One of them inserted a tube to open an air passage into
Bloesch's lungs, said Louie. They then loaded Bloesch, who did not
regain consciousness, into their ambulance before the backup
paramedics arrived. The second crew drove Bloesch to the hospital.
   The Agers, who each have been paramedics for about seven years
and met on the job, were given emergency leaves of absence.
   The pistol was registered to Steven Ager and had been lent to
Bloesch for off-duty use. Bloesch's partner and longtime friend,
James Mahoney, 40, was examining it because Bloesch was having
problems operating it, said police spokesman Dave Ambrose.
   Bloesch, a mounted officer for seven years, had asked Mahoney to
check the silver-plated pistol. Officer Stanley Buscovich, who was
present near the scene but did not witness the shooting, told
investigators the gun had malfunctioned previously, said homicide
Lt. Jerry McCarthy.
   Bloesch and Mahoney sat on a bench in the small locker room and
passed the gun between them several times. Buscovich sat between
the two, facing the opposite direction.
   Mahoney examined the unloaded gun and handed it to Bloesch.
Bloesch then loaded it, apparently without Mahoney's knowledge, and
passed it back.
   Buscovich said Mahoney took a final look and declared, ``It's a
fine gun.'' Several moments later, the gun fired and a single
bullet struck Bloesch, a decorated 16-year veteran of the force.
   Police Chief Frank Jordan termed the shooting an ``unfortunate
tragedy'' and said he was satisfied it was an accident.
   Officers cried outside the stables, and flags were lowered to
half-staff at the Hall of Justice and the stables.
   Bloesch, of San Rafael, had been awarded a silver medal of valor
and two bronze medals of valor. He is survived by a wife and three
children.

<HEAD>Shultz Pressed For Ideas On Argentina's Economic Problems</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ED McCULLOUGH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of State George P.
Shultz was pressed on Wednesday for new ideas about Argentina's
economic problems during the second day of his visit to this South
American capital.
   Alvaro Alsogaray, presidential candidate of the Center Alliance
political party, said he told Shultz that if inflation and
Argentina's foreign debt are not brought under control, ``that
could affect democracy itself.''
   In March, Argentina stopped paying even the interest on its $53
billion foreign debt, the third highest in the developing world.
Inflation, fueled by government overspending, stood at 121 percent
for the first six months of 1988.
   Economy Minister Juan Sourrouille planned to unveil an economic
program later Wednesday based on reduced federal subsidies for
public services, voluntary wage and price restraints, and a
devaluation.
   After lengthy meetings the day before with President Raul
Alfonsin and top aides, Shultz's plans for Wednesday included a
cookout at a ranch, a tour of the historic Colon Theatre, Buenos
Aires' 80-year-old opera house; and a private dinner with Alfonsin.
   In the morning, he met for a third time with Foreign Minister
Dante Caputo. The topics were Central America and Latin America's
foreign debt, Caputo told reporters. He did not elaborate. Shultz
is a former economics professor.
   Meetings also were scheduled with Defense Minister Horacio
Juanarena and Eduardo Angeloz, the governing Radical Civic Union's
presidential candidate in next year's elections.
   In talks on Tuesday with Sourrouille, Shultz was receptive to
Argentina's request for a $500 million bridge loan, the newspaper
La Nacion reported Wednesday, citing unidentified sources at the
Treasury Ministry.
   The bridge loan would help pay interest on the foreign debt
while a $1.2 billion stand-by loan is arranged with the
International Monetary Fund.
   An aide to Shultz refused to comment specifically on the issue,
but said:
   ``The basic position of the United States, of course, is to be
helpful in whatever ways we can as the Argentine government
addresses these problems. That is what the secretary (Shultz) told
the minister (Sourrouille). That's also what he told the
president.''

   An environmental investigator completed a swim
down the Hudson River on Wednesday and became the first person ever
known to stroke the 153 miles from Albany to the Statue of Liberty
in New York Harbor.
   When it was over, Skip Storch, who drank from the river en
route, declared: ``It tasted delicious.''
   Storch's in-water time was 54 hours and 50 minutes over seven
days, said his coach, Jane Katz, a physical education professor at
Bronx Community College. He covered 20 to 25 miles a day and slept
aboard his pace boat.
   Storch entered the water at 5:28 a.m. on July 28. Overcoming
injury and illness, he began the final leg of 11 miles at 4 a.m.
Wednesday from just below the George Washington Bridge and finished
at 7:27 a.m.
   ``I did it basically to let New Yorkers know that the waters are
a lot cleaner than they have been and for everybody not to become
complacent, but keep at it,'' Storch, 31, of Monsey, said when he
met reporters later at the South Street Seaport in lower Manhattan.
   He said the Hudson was fine north of Manhattan, but bacterial
levels in the water adjacent to the city made that part of the
river unsafe for swimmers.
   Storch earns his living by testing the waters around New York
City for the Interstate Sanitation Commission, a tristate and
federal watchdog body.
   During his swim he encountered none of the horrors, such as
medical wastes, that have closed ocean beaches throughout the
metropolitan area, he said.
   ``I saw a few plastic cups. Also some logs, but that's
natural,'' he said.
   Pointing to garbage floating off the seaport in the East River,
he said there was a distinction between unsightly debris and
health-threatening pollution.
   He said isolated instances of barges ``taking the shortcut and
just dumping their waste right in the river'' were deplorable and
also condemned recreational boaters as ``probably the least
courteous to the river and to our waters.''
   As he spoke to interviewers, he ate a plum and later tossed the
pit into the river.
   A stocky 5-foot-10, he described himself as having only average
speed for a swimmer, but ``I go and go and go.''
   He said he swam around Manhattan island last summer to get in
shape for this effort.
   Storch is prone to ear infection, so he carried eardrops with
him and was ready when it struck around Poughkeepsie. ``I also got
headaches. I vomited, that sort of thing. That always happens,'' he
said.
   In 1937, Charles Zimmy came within about 10 miles of completing
an Albany-to-Liberty Island swim. He made it to 129th Street in
Manhattan before being stopped by exhaustion.

   Children as young as 10 are working under
sweatshop conditions in foreign-owned companies in the city of
Shenzhen, it was reported Wednesday.
   The China Youth News daily said 44 of 206 foreign-owned
companies or joint ventures in the southeastern city employ
children under 16 years of age _ a practice illegal in China.
   Shenzhen, a growing city of half a million near Hong Kong, was
in 1980 designated one of four special economic zones for foreign
investment. About 80 percent of its foreign capital comes from Hong
Kong.
   The daily said that among the children working in Shenzhen, more
than 1,000 were recruited from the nearby rural province of
Guangxi. The youngest was aged 10 and the oldest 16.
   Against a setting of worker strikes, sexual promiscuity and
unwanted pregnancies among about 250,000 women who work part-time,
conditions for the children can be ``incredibly bad,'' the daily
said.
   In one factory producing silk flowers, girls as young as 12 work
14 or 15 hours a day, interrupted by a few hours of sleep in a tent.
   One 16-year-old girl showed a reporter a flower-shaped burn mark
left on her hand by a factory machine. She said she didn't earn
enough money to buy a $6 train ticket home to Guangxi.
   The report said the children received $22 to $27 a month _
considerably less than adults _ and that they had to pay for their
own room and board, as well as training fees.
   The report did not identify the factory or the foreign investors.
   Government officials in Guangxi charge $20 for false ID cards
for children seeking work in Shenzhen, who can then claim they are
of legal age, the daily said.
   ``Confusion in the management of our labor system provides a
hotbed for child labor,'' the report said.
   It said the manufacturing industry in Shenzhen ``will gradually
become a world of children.''
   China's official press has in recent months focused on the
growing problems of child labor, particularly in the countryside,
where many parents take their children out of school and put them
to work in small rural factories.

<HEAD>Leak Not Found, But Countdown On For Shuttle Engine Test</HEAD>

   NASA technicians Wednesday failed to
find the source of a launch pad hydrogen gas leak, but a countdown
proceeded for the crucial test firing of space shuttle Discovery's
engines on Thursday.
   ``They did everything they could do, but they couldn't locate
the leak,'' NASA spokesman George Diller said.
   ``We disassembled the hydrogen umbilical but could not pinpoint
the leak,'' launch director Bob Sieck said. ``We've changed out the
seals and debris plate. We've done everything we can ... but it's
still lurking out there.''
   Shuttle managers ordered the countdown to continue toward a 7:30
a.m. firing of the spaceship's three main engines. The test is
vital to certifying Discovery for the first shuttle flight since
Challenger and its crew of seven were lost in an explosion Jan. 28,
1986.
   Sieck said if the leak, which he described as very small,
develops again during the fueling of Discovery's fuel tank late in
the count, the launch team hopes to control it enough with
pressurization techniques to complete the fueling.
   ``If we get a leak beyond a hazardous level, we will
terminate,'' Sieck told a news conference.
   Engineers believe the leak is temperature related and shows up
only when liquid hydrogen at 423 degrees below zero is flowing
through the fuel line into Discovery's external fuel tank, Diller
said.
   The leak is in a launch pad service mast and not on the shuttle
itself.
   It was detected Monday during a practice countdown after the
tank was 67 percent full.
   Officials said they hoped the leak would not reappear when they
started pumping 385,000 gallons of liquid hydrogen into the tank in
the final hours of the countdown.
   If only a small leak showed up, they said they probably could
continue loading the fuel. To eliminate the chance of a fire, they
would neutralize the fuel line with an inert gas, nitrogen.
   Too big a leak would force a fifth postponement of the important
test firing.
   The 20-second ignition will be an overall test of shuttle
systems, as the main engines, computer software, ground support
equipment, communications links and the launch team will get a
thorough workout. Modifications have been made to the engines and
other systems since the Challenger accident.
   Instruments have been placed on joints in the redesigned solid
fuel booster rockets to measure stresses when the three main
engines generate total thrust of 1.1 million pounds.
   The booster rockets will not be fired during the test but will
be subjected to the same bending moments that led to a leak in one
of the joints during Challenger's liftoff. That leak allowed flame
to escape and led to the destruction of the shuttle 73 seconds
after launch.
   Officials believe the engine test delays, combined with an
unresolved leak in the spaceship's steering thruster system, could
slip Discovery's launch date from mid-September into October.
   NASA has deferred action on the thruster leak until after the
main engine test, when engineers will enter Discovery's cargo bay
and cut a hole through the rear bulkhead in an effort to reach and
repair the problem.

<HEAD>IRA Kills Soldier in New Campaign Against Security Forces</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   IRA gunmen ambushed and killed
a part-time soldier as he drove to work Wednesday, claiming their
fourth victim in three days of attacks on military targets in the
British province.
   Thirty-three people have been wounded.
   Ken Maginnes, a ranking Protestant lawmaker, urged Britain to
arrest about 40 people suspected of being Irish Republican Army
ringleaders and hold them without trial. British authorities
abandoned that policy, called internment, in 1975.
   Guerrillas fired on Pvt. Raymond McNicholl of the Ulster Defense
Regiment, the locally recruited British army unit, as he slowed his
car to cross a narrow bridge outside Cookstown, 40 miles west of
Belfast.
   McNicholl, 31, was on his way to work at an engineering plant.
Police said he was hit several times in the head and chest, and
died later at South Tyrone Hospital.
   Spokesmen for the Royal Ulster Constabulary, the police force of
the Protestant-dominated province, said the guerrillas drove to the
ambush in a car stolen from a family of five held captive overnight.
   An IRA statement to Belfast news media claimed responsibility
for the killing. On Tuesday, the IRA warned civilians to stay away
from British servicemen because they were targets in Northern
Ireland and abroad.
   The IRA, most of whose members are Roman Catholic, is fighting
to drive Britain out and unite the province with the Irish
Republic. It is outlawed on both sides of the border.
   Its latest campaign began Monday with the bombing of an army
barracks in suburban London that killed one soldier and wounded
nine. Police said Wednesday they were investigating the possibility
of a woman having smuggled the bomb into the Inglis barracks
Saturday night during a disco dance.
   In three separate attacks Tuesday in Northern Ireland, the IRA
killed a police detective and a part-time soldier and wounded 33
people. Gunmen dragged the off-duty soldier from a Belfast store
and killed him in front of his wife and 2-year-old daughter.
   Gunmen ambushed McNicholl near the spot where a land mine blew
up an Ulster Defense Regiment vehicle Tuesday, wounding six
soldiers.
   Protestant and Catholic leaders, and the British and Irish
governments, condemned the new IRA blitz. Military and police
chiefs ordered reviews of security.
   Northern Ireland Secretary Tom King, the top British official
for the province, declared: ``Terrorism will be beaten'' and did
not rule out reviving internment without trial. ``We keep these
matters under review,'' he said.
   Britain stopped internment in December 1975, six years after
sectarian violence began in Northern Ireland, following worldwide
condemnation.
   In Dublin, Prime Minister Charles Haughey said Wednesday that
``violence can do nothing to bring about a solution to the tragic
problems of Northern Ireland.''
   Referring to possible talks between politicians on both sides of
the border, the Irish Republic's premier said the attacks were
particularly deplorable ``in the present context, with hopes of
political progress being encouraged.''
   Col. Peter MacIntyre, a senior officer of the Ulster Defense
Regiment, said its members would have to review their personal
security arrangements.
   The IRA has killed 10 regiment members, three policemen and 12
British soldiers in Northern Ireland so far this year. Outside the
province, the guerrillas have killed the soldier at the Inglis
barracks and three British servicemen in West Germany and The
Netherlands.
   Seventeen civilians have lost their lives since November because
of attacks on security forces bungled by the IRA. Its warning
Tuesday said civilians should keep away from British military
personnel because their close presence ``often forces us to abandon
operations.''
   King described the IRA warning as ``absolutely hypocritical and
utterly evil.''
   British media quoted IRA sources in Belfast, not identified, as
saying civilians should shun pubs and discos frequented by British
military personnel.
   The IRA bombed three pubs in England in 1974 and its Marxist
offshot, the Irish National Liberation Army, bombed a pub in
Northern Ireland in 1982. Servicemen were among the casualties in
all the attacks.

<HEAD>Some New Jersey Businesses Aren't Complaining About Ocean
Pollution</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Beach closings in recent weeks have
hurt many boardwalk businesses, hotels and restaurants, but some
business owners aren't complaining.
   Joe Santora, owner of Custom Pools in Belmar, said he ``took
advantage of a sad thing'' by placing advertisements saying,
``Polluted waters taste bad. Our pools are drinkable as well as
affordable.''
   ``I've found that some people are disgusted with the ocean and
beaches,'' Santora said. ``For those people who like swimming and
are fed up with the ocean's pollution, they're interested in
pools.''
   All the state's beaches were open Wednesday following the
reopening Tuesday of three beaches at Asbury Park and beaches at
the Gateway National Recreation Area at Sandy Hook. But the impact
of periodic beach closings over the last three weeks because of
high bacteria counts and medical waste extend beyond the main
affected areas in Monmouth County in central New Jersey. Beaches
also have been closed periodically in New York state and north in
New England.
   At Swimland in Jackson Township, general manager Sam Dadas said
he's had several customers buy pools because of the beach pollution.
   ``But mostly they're buying pools just because they want to stay
at home,'' he said. ``People are now more home-oriented. They don't
want to drag their kids to the beach anymore.''
   Some people are taking more drastic measures and leaving the
state altogether.
   ``I've had a few people mention that they weren't going to stay
here because the beaches are really disgusting,'' said Donna
Rubolino, manager of Uniglobe Express Travel in Toms River.
``They're afraid of stepping on something. A lot of people are
going to the Caribbean, where the water is blue and clean.''
   Those who stay close to home are flocking to state and county
parks.
   Ocean County Park lifeguards have estimated daily crowds are up
30 percent. Cheesequake State Park in Old Bridge Township has
reached capacity on most weekends so far this summer, something
that usually happens only on holidays.
   Frank Guidotti, assistant director of the state Division of
Parks & Forestry, said good weather certainly has helped park
attendance, but he added that many people might prefer swimming in
lakes and reservoirs rather than ocean beaches.
   Some casinos in Atlantic City are reporting a busier summer than
normal, but they were hesitant to cite beach pollution as a reason.
   ``Most people that come to Atlantic City are gamers,'' said
Maryann LoBianco, a spokeswoman at Tropicana Hotel and Casino. ``A
beach closing or beach pollution won't necessarily cause people to
come to Atlantic City instead.''
   Meanwhile, Monmouth County Prosecutor John Kaye said witnesses
will be brought before a grand jury to look into possible criminal
wrongdoing in the operation of the old Asbury Park sewage plant,
which contributed to high bacteria counts that forced beaches in
four communities to close last week. A new sewage plant opened
Saturday to replace the old plant.

<HEAD>$300 in Cash Washed Up On Long Island Beach; Sewage in Miami</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAT MILTON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ATLANTIC BEACH, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Long Islanders thought they'd seen
everything wash up on their shores in recent weeks _ until a beach
cleaner collected $300 in faded bills from a beach Wednesday
morning.
   ``I couldn't believe my eyes,'' said Singleton Moorer, who
collected the cash while cleaning the beachfront at the Silver
Point Club. ``I just kept picking it up and the tide kept washing
it back out. I was so excited.''
   Moorer reported collecting a $100 bill and an assortment of
$20s, $10s, $5s and singles trapped in clumps of seaweed along the
tide line _ quite a switch from the syringes, blood vials and
garbage which have closed beaches this summer.
   Moorer, 38, said he and two colleagues found the money around
5:30 a.m. Most of it was faded to white and light green by the salt
water and sunlight, he said.
   Moorer took the cash and bought a big breakfast for himself and
his colleagues. The eight-year veteran of the beach-cleaning crew
said last year he found about $50.
   ``This is a great job,'' Moorer said, adding the money is more
than a week's pay for him.
   Money has been found washed up on the beaches occasionally, said
beach club spokesman William Baumert.
   ``It's probably from some poor guy off his boat,'' Baumert said.
``One thing is for sure _ this is a nice kind of pollution to have
wash up for a change.''
   Raw sewage washed up on some Miami-area beaches on Wednesday,
following a weekend pipeline rupture that spilled millions of
gallons of sewage into Florida's Intracoastal Waterway.
   The decision to close beaches was made after tests taken from 12
sites along shoreline parks in northeastern Dade County showed
three of them with coliform bacteria counts above safety levels.

   The son-in-law of the late Soviet leader Leonid I.
Brezhnev will go on trial Sept. 5, charged with taking bribes worth
more than $1 million, the Tass news agency said Wednesday.
   Tass said Yuri Churbanov, who held the post of first deputy
interior minister while Brezhnev was alive, will be tried in open
court by the military collegium of the Soviet Supreme Court.
   Eight others _ many of them generals of the Interior Ministry _
will be tried along with Churbanov, Tass said. It quoted Alexander
Sboyev, who is said would be the prosecutor at the trial.
   It said Churbanov had pleaded guilty.
   Churbanov married Brezhnev's daughter, Galina, and held a
position of power until Brezhnev died in 1982.
   ``Churbanov is charged with taking bribes in the late 1970s
early 1980s from the leaders of Uzbekistan's Ministry of the
Interior, heads of a number of regional departments of the interior
in the same republic, and other officials,'' Tass said.
   The Interior Ministry oversees the police, as well as travel and
emigration visas.
   Tass said the total value of the bribes Churbanov was alleged to
have accepted was equivalent to $1.1 million at the official
exchange rate.
   The charges against Churbanov were the result of a wide-ranging
investigatio n of corruption in Uzbekistan, a republic of Soviet
Central Asia.
   Brezhnev ruled the Soviet Union from 1964-82. He has been
condemned by the current leader, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, for
fostering corruption and stagnation in Soviet society.
   Tass said the other defendants also pleaded guilty, but that
only one of them has turned in the money he is charged with
obtaining illegally.
   Two other suspects committed suicide, Tass said.

   The House, with only three dissenting votes,
today impeached U.S. District Judge Alcee L. Hastings of Florida
and told the Senate to try him for ``high crimes and misdemeanors.''
   On a vote of 413-3, the House sent a resolution containing 17
articles of impeachment to the Senate, which might not take up the
matter until next year. If found guilty by a two-thirds majority,
Hastings, the first black federal judge in Florida, would be
removed from his $89,500 job.
   Following the vote, Hastings held a quick news conference on the
steps of the federal courthouse in Miami and said he would not step
down from the bench. He called the vote ``a dark day for myself and
the judicial process,'' but added that he expects to prevail in the
Senate.
   ``The vote today, in my humble opinion, is a disgrace,'' said
Hastings. ``Many congresspersons voted with no knowledge of the
voluminous record that has taken seven years to compile.''
   Hastings downplayed his previous complaints that the
investigation was racist, saying ``this isn't about racism, it's
about fairness.''
   The resolution charges that Hastings:
   _Conspired with Washington attorney William Borders to receive a
$150,000 bribe from two convicted racketeers;
   _Lied about the bribe during a criminal trial, and
   _Compromised three FBI investigations by leaking wiretap
information over which he had jurisdiction.
   One article says that Hastings, required as a judge to enforce
and obey the Constitution and the laws of the United States, did
``undermine confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the
judiciary and betray the trust of the people of the United States''
and had thus brought ``disrepute on the federal courts and the
administration of justice by the federal courts.
   As the vote approached, Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., chairman of
the Judiciary subcommittee that held hearings on the Hastings
impeachment, said that black public officials should meet the same
standards as white public officials.
   ``Lower standards would be patronizing; higher standards,
racism,'' he said. ``The problems created here were created by
Judge Hastings himself. (Hastings) has failed to measure up (to
standards applicable to all judges.''
   Conyers, a black, received a standing ovation from other members
when he finished.
   Hastings had few defenders on the House floor.
   Rep. Joseph D. Early, D-Mass., voted ``present'' because, he
said, Hastings had been acquitted by a jury.
   ``Here we have an individual who wasn't convicted,'' Early said.
``What are we going to do with other judges? Are we going to have
the Judiciary Committee come in with impeachment charges every time
a judge is just accused?''
   The House Judiciary Committee, in its report supporting the
resolution, said:
   ``Impeachment protects our society by insuring that those in the
highest positions of public trust are held accountable. This is
especially true with respect to members of the federal judiciary
who, barring impeachment, enjoy life tenure in office. ...
   Before the vote, Hastings said House members who vote to impeach
him will ``rubber stamp racism.''
   The House impeachment vote ``marks another dark and dangerous
day in the House of Representatives,'' Hastings said in Miami on
Tuesday.
   ``It is expected that a number of congresspersons will
rubber-stamp racism and stand the Constitution and American
jurisprudence on its head,'' Hastings said in a telephone interview.
   Two weeks ago, the House Judiciary Committee voted 32-1, in
three separate votes, on the articles of impeachment against
Hastings, the first black appointed to a federal judgeship in
Florida.
   Although Hastings has said he is a victim of double jeopardy, of
``blind ignorance'' and racism, he failed to convince the
committee, which has two black members, that he did not conspire
with a Washington attorney to take a bribe.
   The two black members _ Conyers and Rep. George W. Crockett Jr.,
D-Mich., a former city judge in Detroit _ said they were skeptical
about the bribery charges at first and wondered whether racism
could be the source of the allegations against the flamboyant
Hastings.
   After the hearings, Conyers said: ``I couldn't find any.''
   Conyers said the failure by Hastings and Borders to testify was
one of the many things that led him to vote for impeachment.
   The Senate trial might not begin until next year, when a new
Congress will be seated.
   The principal charge against Hastings is that he conspired with
Borders to obtain $150,000 from two convicted racketeers in return
for reducing their sentences.
   Borders was convicted in a federal court trial, but Hastings was
acquitted of the charge in 1983. The issue was raised again by
judges of the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals, which conducted an
investigation. The judges said Hastings had engaged in the
conspiracy and had lied at his trial.
   The findings were endorsed by the Judicial Conference of the
United States, the administrative office of the federal courts.
   Hastings has said he is innocent. His attorney, Terence J.
Anderson, said during the congressional hearings: ``I believe the
judge will be acquitted in the Senate.
   ``The House has voted 10 impeachments _ they've only won five''
in the past, he said. ``One jury was unanimous in its decision _
not guilty. I don't think it's fair that he must go before a new
jury seven years and $2 million later. Once is enough.''
   Others voting present were Reps. Harold E. Ford, D-Tenn., and
Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas.
   Voting no were Reps. Gus Savage, D-Ill., Mervyn M. Dymally,
D-Calif., and Edward R. Roybal, D-Calif.
   Eleven members did not vote in addition to Speaker Jim Wright,
D-Texas, who customarily refrains from voting. They were Reps.
Mario Biaggi, D-N.Y., Hal Daub, R-Neb., Butler Derrick, D-S.C.,
Wayne Dowdy, D-Miss., Jack F. Kemp, R-N.Y., Trent Lott, R-Miss.,
Buddy MacKay, D-Fla., Dan Mica, D-Fla., Floyd Spence, R-S.C., Gene
Taylor, R-Mo., and Beau Boulter, R-Texas.

   Sen. Phil Gramm said Wednesday he will offer
the nation a glimpse of George Bush's ``vision of America'' when he
gives the nominating speech for Bush at the Republican National
Convention.
   Gramm is the latest Texan to come to the fore as both parties
battle for the Lone Star State's 29 electoral votes in the November
election.
   The state's senior senator, Lloyd Bentsen, is the Democratic
nominee for vice president; Bush is an adopted Texan who calls
Houston home, and at the Democratic National Convention, Texas
state Treasurer Ann Richards gave the keynote address, Agriculture
Commissioner Jim Hightower spoke during prime time, and former Rep.
Barbara Jordan seconded Bentsen's nomination.
   ``It is a great opportunity for me to talk about the vice
president, about his service to America, which ranges over almost
half a century _ from his days as a naval pilot flying off the
(USS) San Jacinto to being the greatest vice president we've ever
had,'' said the junior senator from Texas.
   In his speech in two weeks in New Orleans, he said, he plans to
``really remind people what the world was like that cold day in
January when Ronald Reagan and George Bush took the oath of office
... their proud record and what they've achieved.''
   He will contrast those accomplishments to the record of
Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis, he indicated.
   Gramm was a Democratic representative when Reagan and Bush took
office in 1981. He resigned his seat in 1983, then immediately won
it back as a Republican. He was elected to the Senate the next year.
   He was orginally scheduled to give a prime-time address with
Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole during the convention, and the two
were to have compared Democratic and Republican positions on a wide
range of issues.
   ``My role has been upgraded since then,'' Gramm said Wednesday.
``The vice president called me yesterday and asked me to give the
nominating speech. Obviously, I was very honored to be asked. It's
a great opportunity.''
   Gramm said he was on a trip to the Soviet Union during the
Democratic National Convention.
   ``I wanted to see what the Democratic plank would be like if it
were fulfilled so I was looking at the Soviet economy,'' Gramm said.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Food and Drug Administration said
Wednesday that a New York company is recalling some of its
precooked, frozen shrimp after routine sampling found potentially
harmful bacteria in the product.
   Distributed by Queen `O' the Ocean Inc., of Jamaica, N.Y., the
frozen shrimp was distributed in the New York City area primarily
in five-pound plastic bags, six to a carton, bearing the lot number
8955. The agency said the company reported that 41 cartons of those
bags were distributed and that some three-pound bags also may have
been distributed.
   The FDA said New York State has embargoed 31 additional cartons
at the company's warehouse.
   The FDA sampling found listeria monocytogenes in the shrimp, a
bacteria that can call listeriosis, a normally brief ailment with
mild-to-moderate flu-like symptoms such as fever, headaches and
vomiting.
   Although usually not a major danger for adults, listeriosis can
be life-threatening to fetuses and newborns, the FDA said.

   The Duchess of Beaufort and her pet

   Police said the duchess narrowly prevented a major burglary of
family heirlooms from Badminton House, the 40-bedroom country home
in southern England which gave its name to the racquet sport.
   The duke, who is an art dealer, was away from the $171
million-estate on business.
   The duchess said she was awakened by an alarm Tuesday night and
went downstairs with her butler and the dog, Mabel, to investigate.
   Mabel, she said, ``flew at someone in the library and I think
bit him. Certainly he dropped a bag of valuables.''
   The duchess said she saw a man escaping with an ebony tea caddy

<HEAD>U.S. Ignores World Court Deadline In Nicaraguan Reparations Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROLAND DE LIGNY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The World Court announced
Wednesday the United States has failed to meet a deadline set by
the court to determine war reparations to Nicaragua.
   The United States has been boycotting the World Court since
1984, when the court overruled a U.S. claim that it was not
authorized to hear a Nicaraguan complaint that the Reagan
administration was supporting the anti-Sandinista rebels.
   The United States ignored the July 29 deadline to present its
position in the reparations case, a World Court spokesman said
Wednesday. He spoke on condition of anonymity in line with court
practice.
   There was no immediate comment from Washington.
   ``The time-limit ... has lapsed without the receipt of any
communication from the government of the United States,'' the
spokesman said in a reference to the deadline.
   The spokesman added that the court would consider the next step
in the procedure. It was not immediately clear whether the court
was planning hearings in the case.
   Nicaragua's ambassador to the Netherlands, who represents his
nation at the World Court, could not be reached for comment. An
embassy spokeswoman told The Associated Press that ``all diplomats
involved in the case are currently on holiday in Managua.'' She
refused to give her name.
   Nicaragua's arguments on the issue were filed in March. Under
the court's statutes, they are not to be made public before
hearings are held on the issue.
   Managua has never publicly stated how much it is seeking in
compensation, but Sandinista officials have privately estimated the
economic damage caused by the war against the U.S.-backed Contras
at $250 million to $300 million.
   The current reparations procedure emanates from a 1986 World
Court ruling ordering the United States to immediately halt all
support to the rebels.
   In that ruling, which followed a 1984 complaint by Managua that
the United States was involved in attempts to overthrow the
Nicaraguan government, the court said that Nicaragua was entitled
to reparations, but it declined to indicate the size of them.
   Instead, it ordered both parties in the dispute to negotiate a
settlement on the issue, and said it would intervene only if such
talks would fail.
   Reiterating its 1984 claim that the World Court has no
jurisdiction in the dispute, the Reagan administration has refused
to consider paying reparations to Nicaragua.
   In November, the court opened proceedings to establish the
amount of reparations Nicaragua is entitled. In a letter to the
court a month later, John Shad, ambassador to the Netherlands,
repeated his government's position that the court had no authority
over the case.
   That letter was the last official communication received by the
court from the U.S. government, the court spokesman said.
   The court, officially known as the International Court of
Justice, has no enforcement powers and depends on voluntary
adherence to its rulings.

   Iran said Wednesday an Iraqi chemical
bomb attack wounded more than 1,000 civilians, and Tehran called
for a ban on the export of materials used in the weapons.
   The official Islamic Republic News Agency also reported that
Iranian anti-aircraft batteries shot down an Iraqi jet fighter that
attacked an industrial plant on Wednesday near the southern city of
Bushehr.
   Iraqi warplanes also attacked an industrial target in the
western province of Khuzestan, the news agency reported in
dispatches monitored in Cyprus.
   It said both targets were damaged in the Iraqi attacks, but no
casualties were reported. It gave no further details on the targets.
   Iraq said it attacked an Iranian oil-pumping station and a
natural-gas facility, in a war communique carried by the official
Iraqi News Agency.
   The communique denied that an Iraqi jet was downed. Both news
agencies were monitored in Nicosia. Their contents could not be
independently verified.
   Peace talks aimed at reaching agreement on a cease-fire based on
U.N. Security Council Resolution 598 made little headway Wednesday,
with Iraq continuing to insist on face-to-face talks, which Iran
has refused.
   At the United Nations, Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar
continued efforts to break the deadlock over Iraq's demand.
   He did not schedule formal meetings with Iranian or Iraqi
officials. But aides said contacts with both sides were continuing.
The talks began July 27.
   In the Gulf of Oman, a small cargo vessel exploded and sank on
Wednesday, but the blast appeared to be caused by an explosion on
board and not a mine, gulf-based shipping executives said. No
serious injuries were reported.
   The Greek captain and eight Asian seamen aboard the 1,870-ton
Fatima were rescued by helicopters from a French missile destroyer.
The executives said heat in the area may have caused the vessel's
cargo of gas bottles to explode.
   In Paris, the son of the late Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi issued
an appeal on Wednesday calling on his countrymen to overthrow
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's ``reign of darkness'' in Iran.
   IRNA said 1,031 civilians in the northern province of West
Azerbaijan were wounded on Tuesday when Iraqi warplanes dropped
chemical bombs on the town of Oshanaviyeh. It said most victims
were treated for minor injuries.
   In an interview with Iranian television from the United Nations,
Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati called on Tuesday for a ban on
the export of materials used to manufacture chemical weapons.
   Velayati was reacting to a U.N. report released Monday that
documented massive use of outlawed chemical weapons by Iraq.
Velayati's remarks were carried by Tehran Radio on Wednesday.
   The late shah's son, who calls himself Reza Shah II, invited
Iranians of all walks of life to partake in the establishment of
``popular government.''
   He cited ``the impotence of the Islamic republic to bring
honorable peace and reconstruction, noting the imminent collapse of
the reign of darkness.''
   ``In this life and death struggle for democracy my destiny is
intertwined with yours ... the time is now to break your silence,''
said Reza Shah, who has some support among exiled Iranians. His
remarks were released in Paris, where his monarchist movement is
based, on the occasion of the anniversary of the defunct royal
constitution.

<HEAD>South Korean Press Gains Freedom, But Faces Internal Problems</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL SHIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After years of tight controls, the
press in South Korea enjoys a new freedom from official
restrictions, giving Koreans a steady array of reports critical of
the government.
   But journalists say their struggle for press freedom has taken a
new direction and they still face many problems since President Roh
Tae-woo took office in Feburary with a promise of full democracy
and an end to authoritarian rule.
   Now, instead of fighting officials, reporters and editors face
an internal struggle for editorial freedom, with journalists'
unions playing a major role in the battle.
   As an example of the new openness, a Seoul newspaper recently
reported Roh's daughter was forced to stop using the national
equestrian team's facilities after officials protested.
   Presidential aides said Roh was not aware that police had probed
who leaked the story until he read press articles and quickly
reprimanded police for trying to block news.
   ``I have never seen the president so mad,'' an aide was quoted
as telling reporters.
   A rush to create new newspapers has added to the industry's
problems with rival publications competing for staff and driving up
wages.
   Under public pressure, the government withdrew agents from
newspapers and broadcast stations and stopped issuing daily orders
that regulated the types of stories and the way they appeared.
   Laws were revised making it easier for new newspapers and radio
stations to be set up. Changes in the press laws created a rush to
open new newspapers.
   One newspaper, The Hankyoreh Shinmun, established by hundreds of
reporters expelled in the 1970s for their anti-government views,
made a successful start in May, increasing to 15 the number of
daily newspapers in South Korea.
   Fifteen more daily newspapers are preparing to start publication
before the end of the year. The Roman Catholic Church and Buddhist
groups plan to set up radio stations.
   The newspaper boom also touched off a war for qualified
reporters and other staff.
   Some top photographers have been attracting salaries of up to
$50,000 a year while relatively inexperienced reporters are getting
offers of $30,000 and more _ unusually high salaries by South
Korean standards.
   Despite the changes and improvement, opposition and dissident
groups argue that there still are legal or institutional obstacles
on press activity.
   ``We are fighting an uphill battle. The Korean press is in the
midst of a transition,'' said Lee Chun-bal, president of the
Journalists Association of Korea, which represents some 3,000
reporters. He said most ``outside'' controls have been removed, but
the news media faces new internal challenges.
   Rep. Lee Sang-soo, spokesman of the largest opposition group,
the Party for Peace and Democracy, said the media is packed with
reporters who prefer a comfortable lifestyle and don't care much
about pressing issues.
   ``Most reporters are relatively affluent and do not seem to care
much about the needy people, who account for a good part of the
population,'' Lee said.
   Many journalists interviewed said reporters are now struggling
internally to promote press freedom, with editors, reporters and
publishers disagreeing on what course to take.
   The Pusan Ilbo, a pro-government newspaper, was recently closed
for several days as unionized reporters went on strike for greater
editorial control. The dispute was settled only after the publisher
agreed to consider reporters' views in appointing a managing editor.
   ``Press freedom came as a kind of a windfall as a result of last
year's public struggle for democracy. Reporters didn't do much in
the struggle,'' said one senior editor, who requested anonymity.
   The editor said reporters are now trying to win more editorial
freedom from managers they see as being closely associated with
past authoritarian governments. Labor unions lead the struggle, he
said.
   Union activity among reporters was negligible in the past, but
now most news organizations have active labor unions whose main
concern is freedom of the press.

   The State Department urged Vietnam on
Wednesday to continue cooperating in the search for missing
American military personnel and the resettling of thousands of
former political prisoners in the United States.
   The official Voice of Vietnam radio said the Hanoi government
was temporarily suspending its participation in the programs. It
cited as a ``hostile policy'' the State Department's opposition to
a move in Congress to establish a low-level diplomatic mission in
Hanoi.
   Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley did not retreat from the
stand taken by Assistant Secretary of State Gaston Sigur in
testifying last month against creation of a so-called U.S. interest
section in the Vietnamese capital.
   She said the two sides had agreed that humanitarian issues
``should not be linked to broader political questions, such as
normalization or economic aid.''
   Mrs. Oakley urged Vietnam to continue its cooperation with the
United States in trying to account for the nearly 1,800 Americans
missing in action since the Vietnam War.
   Sigur had testifed that the Reagan administration opposed
normalization of relations with the communist government in Hanoi
until an acceptable solution was found to Vietnam's military
presence in neighboring Cambodia.
   ``The State Department still continues to make foreign policy,''
Mrs. Oakley said.
   Vietnamese Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach informed retired
U.S. Army Gen. John W. Vessey, President Reagan's special emissary,
of Hanoi's decision in a letter Sunday.
   The Hanoi radio broadcast described Sigur's testimony as
evidence of ``hostile policy'' and said Vietnam ``is compelled to
suspend temporarily'' joint efforts ``in the search and exhumation
of remains of missing in actions as well as the resettlement of
camp inmates in the United States.''
   The State Department says it has received about 11,000
applications requesting resettlement of former Vietnamese political
prisoners and their families in the United States. Vietnam said the
resettlement could involve hundreds of thousands of Vietnamese.
   Thach and Vessey agreed a year ago in Hanoi that Vietnam would
accelerate its accounting of the MIAs while the United States would
help with humanitarian programs, such as for those disabled in the
war.
   In letters to Vessey last month, Thach promised to try to
resolve by the end of the year 70 MIA cases which the United States
has given high priority. Thach also welcomed joint excavations for
remains.

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court on Wednesday upheld
the death sentences of two Sikhs convicted in the 1984
assassination of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. A third conviction
was overturned.
   A three-judge panel rejected appeals by Police Constable Satwant
Singh, convicted of the killing, and Kehar Singh, a government
official found guilty of conspiracy, after a six-month review.
   But it acquitted for lack of evidence police sub-inspector
Balbir Singh, who had been convicted and sentenced to death.
   The judges announced their decision to a packed courtroom ringed
by policemen armed with automatic rifles. Security measures, aimed
at deterring attacks by Sikh terrorists, included frisking
spectators and metal-detector checks.
   Mrs. Gandhi was assassinated Oct. 31, 1984, at her home by two
Sikh bodyguards, Satwant Singh and Beant Singh, apparently in
revenge for ordering an army raid four months earlier on the Golden
Temple in Amritsar, Sikhism's holiest shrine. The temple was used
by Sikh rebels as a base in their violent struggle for an
independent homeland in the northern state of Punjab.
   Minutes after the slaying, Beant Singh was killed and Satwant
Singh injured in a shootout with other security men.
   Police arrested Kehar Singh, an uncle of Beant Singh, and Balbir
Singh, a guard at the prime minister's residence.
   The three defendants are not related. ``Singh,'' meaning lion in
the Punjabi language, is part of every Sikh male's name by doctrine
of faith.
   The defendants, held in New Delhi's central jail, were not
present for the ruling. Under Indian law, defendants are brought to
their trials but are represented by counsel during appeals.
   ``I am very pleased with the judgment,'' said Swaran Singh,
Balbir Singh's brother. ``They caught an innocent man but now
justice has been done.''
   In January 1986, a trial court sentenced the defendants to death
by hanging and New Delhi's High Court upheld the decision. The
hearing of the appeals began the next month at the Supreme Court,
India's final court of appeal.
   The two condemned men may request a second review by the same
judges and file a petition for mercy to Indian President Ramaswamy
Venkataraman.
   Sikhs represent 2 percent of India's 800 million people but form
a majority in Punjab. Radical Sikhs have been agitating for an
independent Sikh state in Punjab since 1982, claiming
discrimination by India's majority Hindus.
   More than 1,200 people, most of them Sikhs, died in the army
attack on the Golden Temple.
   Mrs. Gandhi's slaying triggered anti-Sikh riots in New Delhi and
other cities in which more than 2,000 people were killed, most of
them Sikhs.
   In separate incidents Wednesday in Punjab's Amritsar district,
eight people were shot and killed, including a member of the Sikh
Temple Management Committee, United News of India reported. It also
said two people were killed in Gurdaspur district and two others in
Ferozepur district.
   After the court ruling was issued, security forces were on alert
throughout northern India against possible attacks by Sikhs, the
agency said.
   Police in the Faridkot district, 203 miles northwest of New
Delhi, foiled an attempt by militants to carry out simultaneous
massacres in towns in Faridkot and Ferozepur, said Police Chief
Govind Ram.

   Here is a brief summary of the 17 impeachment
articles against U.S. District Judge Alcee L. Hastings of Miami.
Hastings was impeached Wednesday by the House.
   Article 1: ``From some time in the first half of 1981 and
continuing through Oct. 9, 1981, Judge Hastings and William
Borders, then a Washington, D.C. attorney, engaged in a corrupt
conspiracy to obtain $150,000 from defendants in United States vs.
Romano, a case tried before Judge Hastings, in return for the
imposition of sentences which would not require incarceration of
the defendants.''
   Articles 2 through 15 accused Hastings of lying at his trial on
specific aspects of the case.
   Article 16: ``As supervising judge, Judge Hastings learned
highly confidential information'' from a wiretap. On Sept. 6, 1985,
Judge Hastings revealed'' information from the wiretap ``as follows
... On the morning of September 6, 1985, Judge Hastings told
Stephen Clark, the mayor of Dade County, Fla., to stay away from
Kevin `Waxy' Gordon, who was `hot' and was using the mayor's name
in Hialeah, Fla.
   ``As a result of this improper disclosure, certain
investigations then being conducted by law enforcement agents of
the United States were thwarted and ultimately terminated.''
   Article 17: Through his corrupt relationship with Borders, false
testimony, fabrication of false documents submitted as trial
evidence and improper disclosure of confidential wiretap
information, Hastings did ``undermine confidence in the integrity
and impartiality of the judiciary and betray the trust of the
people ... thereby bringing disrepute on the federal courts and the
administration of justice ... .''

<HEAD>House Impeaches Federal Judge Hastings Despite Acquittal in Court</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In an unprecedented case, the House approved
17 articles of impeachment Wednesday against U.S. District Judge
Alcee L. Hastings of Miami despite his acquittal in a previous
bribery trial.
   The House action, which is tantamount to an indictment, sent the
case to the Senate for trial, where conviction by a two-thirds
majority is required for Hastings' removal from the federal bench.
The Senate has not announced a trial date.
   The 413-3 vote marked the first time the House has ever
impeached a federal official who was acquitted of similar charges
in a criminal trial.
   It also was the first time that a black official has been
defendant in impeachment proceedings.
   Hastings, who is the first black U.S. district judge in Florida,
retreated Wednesday from his previous contentions that the
impeachment proceedings were racially motivated. ``This isn't about
racism, it's about fairness,'' he said.
   At an impromptu news conference on the steps of the federal
courthouse in Miami, Hastings said his impeachment was ``a dark day
for myself and the judicial process,'' but that he is confident he
will prevail in the Senate.
   At stake is Hastings' $89,500-a-year, lifetime job on the
federal bench. He was nominated by President Carter in 1979.
   ``The vote today, in my humble opinion, is a disgrace,''
Hastings said. ``Many congresspersons voted with no knowledge of
the voluminous record that has taken seven years to compile.''
   He added: ``I am petrified at their uncaring, undignified and,
in my judgment, unconstitutional approach to this matter.''
   Hastings accused the House of acting hastily so its members
could concentrate on re-election campaigns.
   With Wednesday's vote, the House has impeached 15 federal
officials in its history. Twelve cases have gone to trial in the
Senate. Two officials resigned prior to Senate proceedings and five
_ all federal judges _ have been convicted by the Senate and
removed from office.
   The last to be ousted was U.S. District Judge Harry E. Claiborne
of Las Vegas, Nev., who was convicted of ``high crimes and
misdemeanors'' in October 1986 while serving a federal prison term
for tax evasion.
   The basic charge against Hastings, contained in Article 1,
paralleled the criminal charges on which he was acquitted in 1983.
   Article 1 accused Hastings and Washington attorney William
Borders of conspiring in 1981 to obtain a $150,000 payment from two
convicted racketeers in exchange for lenient sentencing and return
of forfeited assets.
   Borders was convicted and Hastings acquitted at separate
criminal trials.
   Articles 2 through 15 accused Hastings of lying at his 1983
trial on various aspects of the case.
   Article 16 says Hastings, in a separate case, revealed ``highly
confidential information'' obtained through a wiretap to Dade
County Mayor Stephen Clark.
   The 17th article said Hastings' actions ``undermine confidence
in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary'' and bring
``disrepute on the federal courts and the administration of justice
...''
   After Hastings' acquittal, a special panel of judges from the
11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which covers Florida,
recommended that the House consider impeaching Hastings. The
panel's conclusions were endorsed unanimously by the Judicial
Conference, the policy-making body of the federal judiciary.
   Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., a black whose House Judiciary
subcommittee investigated Hastings, said racists are probably
``gloating'' and ``delighted'' over the charges against Hastings.
But Conyers strongly defended the articles of impeachment.
   Conyers said he was initially ``very suspicious'' of the Reagan
administration's prosecution of Hastings because it had nominated
only a half-dozen blacks as lower court judges and only one as an
appeals court judge.
   But Conyers said he concluded after his investigation that ``the
problems created here have been created by Judge Hastings himself.''
   He added, ``Black public officials must be held to the same
standard as all other public officials. A lower standard would be
patronizing. A higher standard would be racist. Just as race should
never disqualify a person from office, race should never insulate a
person from the consequences of wrongful conduct.''
   Rep. Peter W. Rodino Jr., D-N.J., chairman of the full Judiciary
Committee, dismissed suggestions that Hastings was the victim of
double jeopardy, the legal prohibition against being tried twice on
the same charges.
   Rodino said an impeachment trial is not a criminal proceeding,
and therefore the two are ``separate and distinct.''
   Rep. George Gekas, R-Pa., said, ``This look that we have just
given into the conduct of Alcee Hastings makes one sick in the
stomach.''
   Voting against impeachment were Reps. Gus Savage, D-Ill., Mervyn
M. Dymally, D-Calif., and Edward R. Roybal, D-Calif.
   Rep. Joseph D. Early, D-Mass., voted ``present'' because, he
said, Hastings had been acquitted by a trial jury.
   ``Here we have an individual who wasn't convicted,'' Early said.
``What are we going to do with other judges? Are we going to have
the Judiciary Committee come in with impeachment charges every time
a judge is just accused?''
   Also voting ``present'' were Reps. Harold E. Ford, D-Tenn.,
Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas, and E. Clay Shaw Jr., R-Fla.
   A dozen members did not vote. They were Reps. Mario Biaggi,
D-N.Y.; Hal Daub, R-Neb.; Butler Derrick, D-S.C.; Wayne Dowdy,
D-Miss.; Jack F. Kemp, R-N.Y.; Trent Lott, R-Miss.; Buddy MacKay,
D-Fla.; Dan Mica, D-Fla.; Floyd Spence, R-S.C.; Gene Taylor, R-Mo.;
Beau Boulter, R-Texas, and Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, who
customarily does not vote.

<HEAD>Reagan Vetoes Defense Bill, Saying It Would Signal US ``Weakness''</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Adds 3 grafs of Carlucci comment</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   President Reagan vetoed a $299.5 billion
Pentagon budget bill Wednesday, charging congressional Democrats
with partisan politics and saying the bill would signal ``weakness
and accommodation'' in U.S. defense policy.
   Although the bill has become entangled in election-year politics
and leading Republicans had urged the president to veto it, Reagan
disavowed any political motives.
   ``These are issues of national security and they must remain
above partisan politics,'' he said.
   ``The partisan politics is on the other side,'' he added.
   The bill essentially would have authorized the spending levels
Reagan sought, but sought to rearrange spending priorities.
Administration officials complained that the legislation contained
language that would have tied the president's hands on future arms
control negotiations with the Soviet Union.
   Reagan also objected to the bill on grounds it would ``cripple
the very concept'' behind Star Wars, his space-based missile
defense system.
   The president made his announcement after walking into the White
House press briefing room with a copy of the bulky bill in his
hands.
   ``The bill would signal a basic change in the direction of our
national defense,'' he said. ``A change away from strength and
proven success and back toward weakness and accommodation of the
1970s.''
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., responding to the veto, said
Reagan ``faces a difficult test between now and November to
maintain a proper separation between his roles as president and
political campaigner. On this issue, he should not have abdicated
his responsibility to the country as president and
commander-in-chief _ he should have signed the defense bill.''
   Rep. Tony Coelho, D-Calif., the third-ranking Democrat in the
House, noted that Vice President George Bush had supported the veto
and said, ``If he wants (Pentagon mismanagement) debated for the
next few months, that is all right with us. George Bush wants to
play politics. The defense veto will come back to haunt them.''
Bush is the certain Republican presidential nominee.
   The veto may be difficult to override in the
Democratic-controlled Congress, particularly in the House. It
passed both chambers July 14, by votes generally along party lines.
The vote was 229-183 in the House and 64-30 in the Senate. It takes
a two-thirds vote of both houses to override.
   Rep. William Dickinson, R-Ala., ranking Republican on the Armed
Services Committee, said, ``I expect there will be an override
attempt, but I think we will sustain the president's veto.'' He
called it a ``bad bill.''
   Senate GOP leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., said Reagan made ``the right
decision ... for only one reason _ the right reason: the bill does
not serve the national security interests of the United States.''
   Reagan said the bill would mean ``unilateral concessions to the
Soviets _ concessions that would reduce my bargaining leverage at
the conference table at the very moment when that leverage has
produced its most fruitful results,'' the president said.
   ``I have been patient as the liberals in Congress attempted to
erode our military strength, the strength that has provided the
basis for our diplomatic success,'' he said. ``But I can be patient
no longer. Congress needs to get back to work and come up with a
bill I can sign.''
   When asked whether he expected Congress to produce a bill before
adjourning, the president replied that the defense appropriations
bill now being considered, a separate bill that actually provides
the Defense Department with the funds authorized in the vetoed
measure, ``is one that I could sign and would sign.'' He did not
elaborate, but the appropriations bill contains fewer arms control
restrictions than the authorization measure.
   Reagan said the authorization bill would also have crippled the
concept behind Star Wars, or the Strategic Defense Initiative, of
creating a space shield against nuclear attack.
   ``And I will not abide this _ particularly in view of the
technical progress that SDI is making,'' he said.
   ``They say this bill would take the `stars' out of Star Wars,''
said Reagan. ``With my veto today, I am putting back the `I',
initiative, in SDI.''
   ``We know there is a partisan position in which there are a
great many there who just don't want SDI at all,'' he said. ``Well,
I think they are bucking the tide.''
   The Strategic Defense Initiative would receive $4 billion in the
bill, slightly more than the current SDI budget of $3.9 billion but
far less than the $4.8 billion Reagan wanted.
   In addition, the bill reduces spending for a space-based
interceptor that is under development as the first phase of an
eventual SDI program. The Pentagon wanted $330 million, but the
bill restricts the total to $85 million.
   The measure requires retirement of three aging, missile-firing
Poseidon submarines as new subs are built, continuing a policy of
generally keeping the United States near weapons limits imposed by
the unratified SALT II nuclear treaty. Reagan opposes this policy.
   Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci, who is visiting the Soviet
Union, said in a statement released at the Pentagon that he fully
supported the veto.
   As passed, the legislation was ``seriously flawed'' because of
the arms control restrictions and provisions reducing funding for
Star Wars and modernization of nuclear missiles, Carlucci said.
   ``These concerns were expressed to the Congress over the past
two months, and I regret that they were not accommodated in the
bill presented to the president,'' he added.

   Thousands of masked students marched
through downtown Rangoon on Wednesday to denounce new hard-line
leader Sein Lwin, witnesses said, and he put the Burmese capital
under martial law.
   Some saffron-robed Buddhist monks joined in and workers swelled
the ranks as the procession moved toward the western part of the
city, the witnesses said. No violence was reported, unlike student
riots in March and June.
   Sein Lwin, a former army general, is widely held responsible for
ruthless suppression of the March riots, in which up to 100 people
were killed.
   Rangoon radio, monitored in Bangkok, said the government imposed
martial law to preserve security, safeguard property and allow
students who so desire to study in peace. It said summary trials
might be held in some cases.
   President Sein Lwin's decree did not say whether a curfew was
put on Rangoon's 3.5 million inhabitants. It said martial law would
``cease when the Council of State so declares.''
   As read on the official radio, the decree said students
demonstrated, delivered speeches and spread pamphlets at Burma's
most sacred shrine, the Shwedagon Pagoda, from July 28 until
Tuesday.
   ``Today, on 3 August, 1988, about 200 students, joining forces
with some people intent on causing riotous disturbances, made
protest marches en masse and started disturbances, and a situation
arose which regional organs of power can no longer control,'' it
said.
   ``The Council of State has authorized the chief of staff to
declare that a state of emergency exists and to declare martial law
in townships of the Rangoon municipal area.''
   Western diplomats reached by telephone in Rangoon provided
witness accounts of 3,000 students marching through the city, faces
covered with handkerchiefs, stockings and other masks so
authorities could not identify them. hey reported no violence and
said police were not in evidence.
   One said the marchers ``were very well organized, very peaceful.
They would form rings around cars so there would be no damage.''
   In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said
the U.S. Embassy reported no violence or arrests.
   Most protesters appeared to be high school students, the
witnesses said.
   Diplomats said the march moved along Merchant Street past
decaying edifices of British colonial days and the newer American
and Indian embassies, through spacious Maha Bandoola Park and
around centuries-old Sule Pagoda.
   According to the reports, most protesters had marched westward
by midafternoon and were joined by large crowds from working-class
neighborhoods.
   Security forces took over the Shwedagon Pagoda, a traditional
center for political agitation, on Tuesday and sealed it off from
students, the diplomats said.
   On Tuesday, the official News Agency Burma said 100 to 200
teen-agers raised the peacock flag, a symbol of Burma's struggle
for independence from Britain, on the base platform of Shwedagon's
soaring, gold-decked central spire. It urged parents to control
their children and avoid disturbances.
   Foreign journalists have followed developments by telephone and
by monitoring official media because of restrictions on their entry
to Rangoon, the only legal gateway to Burma for most outsiders.
Foreign reporters usually entered the country in the past on
tourist visas issued at Burmese embassies.
   Virtually all institutions of higher learning were closed after
the June riots. High schools have remained open, but attendance was
reported low and hours sometimes were shortened.
   The emergency decree puts the chief of staff, Burmese usage for
the armed forces commander, in charge of administering justice. The
current commander is Gen. Sau Maung, a close associate of Sein
Lwin, who delegated martial law authority to Brig. Gen. Myo Nyunt,
military chief in Rangoon.
   Sein Lwin has admitted that official corruption, waste and
``almost deathlike immobility'' have caused a serious loss of faith
in the government, according to remarks made available Wednesday.
   Speaking Tuesday to the country's top leadership, Sein Lwin also
said the government should implement economic reforms dismantling
part of Burma's rigid socialist system.
   He was elected as president and chairman of the ruling Burma
Socialist Program Party last week after the resignation of Ne Win,
who had ruled Burma since a coup 26 years ago. Pamphlets
circulating in Rangoon have called him a ruthless oppressor and
urged that he be overthrown.
   Diplomats in Rangoon have said Sein Lwin appears ready to make
some economic reforms while also putting down dissent to rob
popular opposition movements of potential leaders.
   Those arrested to date include Burma's most respected and vocal
dissident, Aung Gyi, and Associated Press correspondent Sein Win.
They have been accused of ``attacking the state.''
   Louis D. Boccardi, president and general manager, said in a
letter to Sein Lwin the AP was ``deeply concerned'' about Sein
Win's detention and ``would appreciate further information and
clarification of the charges.''

   A Soviet military team inspected old
Pershing 2 missile facilities Wednesday under terms of the
Intermediate Nuclear Force treaty.
   The 10-person group arrived at nearby Patrick Air Force Base in
an Air Force transport and immediately accompanied 10 American
escorts in vans to Cape Canaveral.
   Two other Soviet teams were inspecting sites Wednesday in
Maryland and Oklahoma under the terms of the INF treaty signed in
December by President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Under the treaty, all nuclear missiles with a range of 300 to
3,400 miles must be eliminated within three years of the date the
treaty became effective. The U.S. will destroy 867 Pershing 1A,
Pershing 2 and ground-launched cruise missiles in Europe, while the
Soviets will destroy 1,752 SS-4, SS-12 and SS-20 missiles.
   Soviet and American inspection teams are permitted under the
treaty to visit selected missile sites to check on compliance with
the document.
   At Cape Canaveral, the Soviet team toured Launch Complex 16,
where Pershing 2 missiles were test-launched as recently as last
February, and an area where the missiles were assembled.
   The Soviets were briefed by the head of the American team, Air
Force Maj. Warren Greene, who told them both facilities are now
mothballed and that there are no longer any Pershing 2 missiles
here.
   The Pershing 2 missiles will be destroyed by stationary fring at
bases in Colorado and Texas.

<HEAD>FDIC Chief Sets S&L Industry's Recovery Cost at $50 Billion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of the government fund that insures
commercial bank deposits said Wednesday it could cost ``slightly
under $50 billion'' to restore the health of the rival savings and
loan industry.
   That appraisal, offered to the House Banking Committee by
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Chairman L. William Seidman, falls
short of private analysts' guesses, which range up to $100 billion,
but it is nearly twice as high as other official government
estimates.
   The Federal Home Loan Bank Board, the regulator of the nation's
3,100 savings institutions, last month put the price tag at $31
billion, within the $26 billion to $36 billion range offered by the
General Accounting Office, Congress' auditing arm.
   Some in Congress and the Reagan administration dismiss the
shifting estimates as a numbers game, but Seidman's estimate is
likely to lend new urgency to the debate over whether taxpayers'
money is needed to bail out the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance
Corp.
   Until now, official estimates have been low enough to support an
argument that the FSLIC, which expects to have $42.5 billion in
revenue over the next 10 years, can get by without taxpayer money.
   However, if Seidman's $50 billion cost estimate is on target,
there is little question that the FSLIC needs more money. Seidman
said the bank board's revenue projections also ``are on the
optimistic side.''
   He added, ``We estimate (the problem) is getting worse at
something like $1 billion a month.''
   Although Seidman's agency insures commercial banks _ not savings
and loan associations _ it is studying the FSLIC's problems because
some have proposed merging the two insurance funds, a move Seidman
and banks oppose.
   Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said members of Congress regard
bank board estimates as overly optimistic and were likely to give
more credence to Seidman's number.
   Seidman said his own agency, which last Friday announced
potentially the largest bank rescue ever, will suffer its first
loss this year since its founding in 1934.
   The FDIC is spending $4 billion to assist the takeover of First
RepublicBank Corp. of Dallas by NCNB Corp. of Charlotte, N.C.
Seidman had said he expected to recover part of that.
   On Wednesday, he estimated for the first time a figure for the
ultimate cost _ $2 billion to $3 billion.
   If that proves true, the First RepublicBank rescue would surpass
the 1984 bailout of Continental Illinois Corp. of Chicago. The FDIC
initially spent $4.5 billion in that transaction, but expects to
recover all but $1.7 billion.
   Seidman slightly worsened the projections for the FDIC fund,
which ended 1987 with $18.3 billion. Previously, he has said it
could decline by as much as 10 percent.
   On Wednesday, he said, ``we'll go down 10, 12, 13 percent'' to
``$16 billion, $15.5 billion, something like that.''
   He also said that banks closed or requiring FDIC assistance to
stay open will surpass last year's post-Depression record of 203.
Ninety-eight banks have failed so far this year and 17 others
received government assistance.
   With the First RepublicBank transaction, eight of the 10 largest
banks in Texas have been recapitalized, either by the government or
privately. For one of the two remaining, ``we may have to provide
assistance. We don't know at this time,'' Seidman said.
   He declined to identify the institution, but he was believed to
be talking about MCorp., a Dallas bank that has been trying to
raise private capital.

   Recent rains in the Ohio and Mississippi
valleys haven't ended the nation's severe drought and the outlook
remains bleak, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
reported Wednesday.
   Some areas remain more than 10 inches short of normal rainfall
since April, the agency reported. Significant amounts of rainfall
over large areas are needed to promote any long-term relief.
   The latest 30-day forecast indicates that hot weather will
continue in drought areas, although there is some chance of
increased moisture over the next three months, NOAA's latest
drought advisory said.
   The rains that did occur took place when the high-altitude jet
stream, a powerful wind moving weather patterns across the nation
from the west, moved closer to normal conditions, NOAA reported.
   While the jet had been split in June into two streams passing
north and south of the United States, trapping hot, dry weather in
between, the southern portion faded in July.
   With the decline of the southern jet some wetness from the Gulf
of Mexico was able to move into the Central and Southeastern states.
   The northern jet edged southward, closer to its normal route but
still carrying most Pacific Ocean wetness north of the Canadian
border, the agency said.
   ``The most obvious needs, as indicated by regions with less than
50 percent of normal (rain) since April 1, are in the northern and
southern Mississippi Valley as well as much of the Missouri
Valley,'' NOAA said.
   Despite recent rains, many parts of the nation remain below 50
percent of normal rainfall and continued dryness will expand that
area considerably, officials said.
   In addition, the advisory said, ``dryness in sections of the
northern Rocky Mountains and the High Plains has increased
significantly within the past week and these conditions have been
associated with a number of major forest fires.''
   As of July 23, the agency reported, 59 percent of the nation's
corn and soybean growing areas were suffering from severe or
extreme drought, still below the 89 percent posted in July 1934.
   Even so, drought conditions are comparable with some of the
worst in the 1930s, the agency said.
   Streamflow remains at very low levels over much of the nation,
affecting river traffic, and reservoir levels are generally below
normal, the report said.

<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mathias Rust, the young West
German pilot whose landing in Red Square triggered a Soviet
military shake-up, arrived in Frankfurt today after being freed
from a Soviet prison earlier in the day.
   Rust admitted that his daring flight more than a year ago was
``not responsible'' but contended that his experience had improved
Soviet-West German relations.
   On the flight from Moscow, Rust told The Associated Press that
his landing on Red Square was ``only the beginning'' of his efforts
to draw East and West together.
   ``I will continue the work, but no crimes, only legal things,''
he told the AP.
   Asked if he had it do over again if he would make the
unauthorized flight that drew the Kremlin's ire, he answered: ``No,
not again. It was not responsible.''
   Airport spokesman John Sturm told The Associated Press the
Lufthansa jetliner carrying Rust landed in Frankfurt at 9:24 p.m.
(3:24 p.m. EDT).
   The Soviet news agency Tass earlier reported that Rust ``has
just taken a flight from Moscow to the FRG (Federal Republic of
Germany).''
   A spokesman for the West German Embassy confirmed that Rust was
aboard a Lufthansa jet that left Moscow's Sheremetyevo Airport
shortly after 8 p.m.
   The embasssy spokesman, who demanded anonymity, said Rust was
taken directly to the airport from Lefortovo Prison, where he had
been held since his flight in May 1987.
   Tass said the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, the country's
highest executive body, decreed earlier in the day that the
20-year-old Rust ``be freed from further serving his term and
expelled from the Soviet Union.''
   Tass said Rust's release after having served just over a quarter
of a four-year sentence demonstrated the Soviet Union's
``humaneness.'' There was no further explanation for the early
release.
   Tass quoted Rust as saying, ``I realize that I have committed
serious criminal offenses and the fact that the Presidium of the
USSR Supreme Soviet freed me from punishment before I served my
term is an act of humanism.''
   ``I think this also attests to the overall improvement of
relations between our two countries,'' Rust was quoted as saying.
   On May 28, 1987, Rust, then 19, flew a Cessna aircraft to Moscow
from Helsinki, Finland, landing on Red Square.
   He was found guilty Sept. 4, 1987, of illegally entering the
Soviet Union, violating international flight rules, and malicious
hooliganism, and sentenced to four years in a Soviet labor camp.
   He had been at Moscow's Lefortovo Prison until today.
   Tass said Rust told one of its correspondents that he had no
complaints about his treatment in captivity but was eager to return
to his family and friends.
   ``Mathias Rust is Free!'' West Germany's Frankfurter Rundschau
newspaper trumpeted in a banner headline after Rust's release was
announced.
   But West Germany's ZDF television network quoted the
prosecutor's office in the West German city of Itzehoe as saying
that an investigation against Rust was still open. The prosecutor
has been investigating possible charges of endangering air traffic
and fraud against Rust.
   Rust comes from the town of Wedel, six miles west of the
northern port city of Hamburg. An Associated Press reporter tried
to speak with Rust's mother, Monika, today but was turned away from
the family home by three reporters from West Germany's Stern
magazine. The magazine has an exclusive contract with Rust's family
for the rights to Rust's story.
   The family has an unlisted telephone number.
   Officials in West Germany said that West German Foreign Minister
Hans-Dietrich Genscher discussed the case of Rust with Soviet
officials during Genscher's visit to Moscow last week.
   Genscher was in Moscow to prepare for the scheduled October
summit between West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Soviet leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Michael Gerdts, Genscher's spokesman, told reporters that
``Mathias Rust was a topic in talks between the foreign minister
and (Soviet) Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze'' in Moscow.
   A West German government spokesman in Moscow, who spoke on
condition he not be indentified, said the Soviets contacted the
embassy early today to say that Rust would be freed. The source
would not discuss any reasons behind the early release.
   In Bonn, West German government spokesman Norbert Shaefer told
The Associated Press, ``The federal government is pleased with this
step.''
   Rust's dramatic flight shook the foundation of Soviet security
and oiled the way for the ouster of Defense Minister Sergei L.
Sokolov and Air Defense chief Alexander Koldunov.
   Soviet jets scrambled to intercept Rust's light plane when it
was detected crossing into Soviet airspace, but no action was taken
to halt the flight and apparently no word of warning about the
incident was sent forward to Moscow.
   Gorbachev and Sokolov were in Berlin at the time. Two days after
Rust's landing and arrest, Sokolov was sent into retirement for the
lapse and Koldunov was fired.
   Rust told the Soviet court during his trial that he made the
flight to advance understanding between East and West, but the
court ruled that he acted in the interest of self-promotion and
issued a guilty verdict on all counts against him.

   Corrosion in an 8 inch-wide pipe caused the
May 5 explosion at a Shell Oil refinery that killed seven workers,
the company said Wednesday.
   The pipe, in equipment used break down oil into gasoline,
ruptured, releasing 20,000 pounds of hydrocarbons and causing a
fire and an explosion felt as far as 20 miles away in New Orleans.
   Investigators are trying to find out why the pipe corroded
faster than it should have, plant manager Fred Foster told
reporters during a tour of the refinery Wednesday.
   Checks at other parts of the plant show no danger of a similar
explosion, he added.
   Seven workers died, and 22 were injured, six critically. Shell
said all but one of those critically injured will return to work
soon. The sixth is still recovering from burns over 75 percent of
his body.
   The refinery remains all but shut down, according to Phil
Schwin, superintendent of the Shell Norco complex. Foster said
repairs are being completed and various refinery units would be
phased into use over the next two months.
   ``Now until the latter part of September, we'll be staggering
all these units back on stream,'' Foster said.
   The explosion damaged dozens of homes in Norco and even caused
some window damage in New Orleans, and Shell said Wednesday it has
provided temporary housing to about 200 Norco residents at a
$250,000 cost.
   To date over 9,000 insurance claims have been filed. Of those,
5,200 have been settled at a total cost of $24 million, the company
said.
   The company said about 300 of the 1,600 workers at the Norco
complex went through counseling concerning causes and effects of
the explosion of the catalytic cracker.

   An explosion near a military
headquarters rocked downtown Johannesburg Wednesday night, but
caused no injuries and only minor damage, police said.
   The blast occurred about 9:30 p.m. (3:30 p.m. EDT) outside the
Witwatersrand Command, a complex of brick buildings housing the
Johannesburg area military headquarters, police said.
   No one was injured and the blast caused only minor damage to the
buildings, police said, adding that they did not know what caused
the explosion.
   The blast was heard in the downtown offices of The Associated
Press, more than a mile from the scene.
   Police cordoned off several blocks around the site and searched
for bombs, witnesses said.
   In July 1987, a bomb exploded outside the military headquarters
injuring 68 people.
   There have been about 100 bombings in South Africa since a
nationwide state-of-emergency was declared in June 1986. Police
have blamed virtually all of the attacks on the outlawed African
National Congress, the main black guerrilla group attempting to
overthrow the white-led government.
   The ANC, based in Lusaka, Zambia, rarely confirms or denies any
involvement in such attacks.

<TEXT>
   U.S. and Canadian astronomers have found 10
planet-like objects orbiting distant stars, a discovery that
intensifies speculation about the existence of life beyond the
Earth.
   In reports Wednesday at the International Astronomical Union
assembly, astronomers from the Smithsonian Astrophysical
Observatory in Cambridge, Mass., said they have found ``what might
be a very large planet'' orbiting a star 90 light years away.
   In an independent study, an astronomer from the University of
Victoria, British Columbia, said he has found evidence of planets
orbiting nine stars, and suggested that as many as half of the
stars in the Milky Way galaxy may have ``planetary companions.''
   Bruce Campbell, chief of the Canadian team, said his result
``showing that the majority of stars in the galaxy perhaps have
planetary systems could be interpreted as a sign that there are
also Earth-like planets suitable for life, but we have no evidence
of that at all.''
   ``It makes it easier to speculate than it was a few years ago
when there were zero planetary candidates,'' said David W. Latham,
leader of the Smithsonian team. ``We can start to speculate now
about how often life evolved.''
   Both teams of astronomers made the discoveries by analyzing the
color shift of light collected from stars. Light from a distant
source changes color slightly if the light source is moving. It
shifts toward red if it is moving away, and toward blue if moving
toward the observer.
   By carefully measuring this shift, the astronomers are able to
detect wobble, or movement of the stars. This movement can be
caused only by the gravitational effect of a nearby body, and the
velocity of the movement allows the scientists to calculate the
size of the object.
   Latham said the planet-like object he found is about 20 times
the size of Jupiter, and is orbiting so close to star HD 114762
that it would be``much hotter than an oven.''
   ``It's not a place you would go to to look for life,'' he said.
   The object, said Latham, is about 3,000 times the size of Earth
and is on the very edge of what is commonly thought to be the
maximum size for a planet.
   Star HD 114762 is 90 light years _ about 522 trillion miles _
from Earth.
   Campbell said he and his Canadian group used a technique even
more sensitive than the instruments used by Latham and were able to
find nine planetary objects after studying just 18 stars.
   The clearest data, he said, shows that a large planet orbits a
star called Tau Ceti.
   ``We see in the star the effects of a companion sized on the
order of Jupiter,'' said Campbell.
   Eight other planet-like objects were found about other stars, he
said, but the team was unable to make a precise measure of their
size.
   ``We can only infer masses on the order of 1 to 10 times that of
Jupiter,'' said Campbell.
   All of the stars studied by the Canadian team are bright, about
magnitude 4. They all are similar in size to the sun, and all are
within 100 light years, about 580 trillion miles, from Earth.
   Latham's study, using the Oak Ridge Observatory in Harvard,
Mass., concentrated on very faint stars and HD 114762 is of a 7
magnitude, too faint for sighting by the naked eye. Stars grow
fainter as the number increases on the magnitude scale. A magnitude
of 6 is the faintest visible to the naked eye.
   None of the discovered planets could actually be seen by the
astronomers because they are blotted out by the brightness of the
stars.
   ``Seeing these objects would be like placing a speck of dust
beside a 1,000-watt bulb and trying to see it from miles away,''
said Latham.
   Campbell said the instruments now used are not sensitive enough
to detect a planet as small as the Earth.
   Latham said the object near star HD 114762 has an orbital period
of 83.84 days and the Smithsonian team collected data on 30 cycles
over a seven-year period. The results have been confirmed by
independent observations of a Swiss astronomer.
   ``There have been a lot of claims about finding planets, but
this is the first with a strong technical support because we have
observed it over such a period of time,'' Latham said.
   Such objects could not be seen until the development in recent
years of instruments able to substantially amplify and measure the
light from stars.
   Now, with this new data, said astronomer Tsevi Mazeh of the
University of Tel Aviv, a new era is beginning.
   ``It makes it more plausible to assume now that there could be
Earth-like planets with life out there,'' he said.

license conspiracy, faces three other Democrats in the 8th
Congressional District, where Rep. Ed Jones is retiring after 19
years. Jones is backing one of Blanton's opponents.
   ``I have very great expectations,'' Blanton said Wednesday in a
telephone interview. ``I'm very confident.''
   Added his campaign manager, Will J. Pillow: ``It's going to be
the biggest political upset since Truman beat Dewey'' in 1948.
   Blanton, who served six years in Congress from another west
Tennessee district, was elected governor in 1974 and left office in
1979 amid a clemency-for-cash scandal.
   He was never charged in that scandal, but served two years
following his conviction on conspiracy, mail fraud and extortion
charges. He was released in 1986. Blanton's mail fraud convictions
were vacated in line with a U.S. Supreme Court decision. He is
appealing the conspiracy and extortion convictions. His rights to
vote and hold office were restored last year by a state judge.
   In the GOP Senate primary, Alice Algood, a party activist from
Columbia, faces Bill Andersen, a Kingsport lawyer. Sasser, seeking
a third term, is unopposed for renomination.
   In other congressional primaries, Democrat Harold Ford, the
state's only black congressman, is opposed in the all-Memphis 9th
District for the eighth time by Mark Flanagan, a businessman. Ford,
whose trial on bank fraud charges has not been scheduled, has said
his indictment hasn't caused him any problems in the campaign.
   And Democratic Rep. Marilyn Lloyd, seeking her eighth term from
the 3rd District, faces opposition from newcomers Lamar Lasley and
Walter Ward. All are from the Chattanooga area.

<HEAD>US Probing Death of First American in Palestinian Uprising</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States is investigating the death
of a man believed to be the first American to die in the
Israeli-occupied West Bank since the Palestinian revolt began last
December, the State Department said Wednesday.
   ``We deeply regret the death of Mr. Ribhi Barakat Kayed on July
30 in an incident involving Israeli soldiers,'' said department
spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley.
   She said the U.S. consulate in Jerusalem was in contact with
members of Kayed's family and was interviewing witnesses in an
attempt to determine what happened last Saturday. Kayed is from
Columbus, Ohio.
   The U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv ``has raised this tragic incident
with the government of Israel'' and will do so again once the
investigation is completed, she said.
   Mrs. Oakley said Kayed was the first American of Palestinian
origin to die in the uprising that began Dec. 8. Since then, more
than 260 Palestinians have been killed in clashes with Israeli
soldiers.
   Kayed's family alleges that the 67-year-old man was pulled out
of his house by Israeli soldiers and ordered to clean up
anti-Israeli graffiti on a nearby wall. While complying, Kayed
collapsed and died, they said.
   His relatives said the soldiers refused to allow Kayed to get
his medication although they were told he had a heart condition.
   The Israeli army, disputing the claim, said soldiers had told
Kayed's grandson to clean the slogans and that Kayed himself was
asked to go into the house. He probably died of a heart attack, the
army said.
   George Moses, chairman of the Council of Presidents Of National
Arab American Associations, said the State Department's response
was inadequate.
   Moses accused Richard Schifter, assistant secretary of state for
human rights, of failing to take a more forceful public stance on
Israeli human rights abuses. ``We believe this abject failure led
directly to this incident,'' he said.

<HEAD>NOW Protests Continued Jailing of Woman Who Hid Daughter</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD KEIL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Women's rights activists called Wednesday for
the release of a physician who claims her ex-husband has sexually
abused their daughter, and has spent almost a year in jail rather
than tell a judge the girl's whereabouts.
   ``We won't give up and we won't go away until Elizabeth Morgan
is a free woman,'' Sherri O'Dell, a vice president of the National
Organization for Women, told a crowd gathered outside the District
of Columbia Superior Court.
   Judge Herbert Dixon ordered Morgan, a plastic surgeon, to jail
on contempt charges last Aug. 28 for refusing to reveal the
location of her 5-year-old daughter, Hilary.
   Morgan has claimed that her daughter was sexually abused on
weekend visits to her former husband, Dr. Eric Foretich. After
Dixon ruled to allow Foretich broad visitation rights with the
child, Morgan hid the girl.
   Since then, her medical practice has shut down and she has
accumulated legal bills of nearly $1.5 million.
   ``How do I feel? Angry, betrayed, fearful _ like any victim of
injustice,'' Morgan said in a statement read by a supporter at the
rally. ``Have I ever thought of giving up, of telling the judge
where she is? Not once.''
   She described her daughter as ``safe and healing.''
   Morgan's bid for freedom is stalled in Washington, but a federal
appeals court in Richmond, Va., last May ordered a lower court to
reconsider evidence excluded from a suit filed by Morgan against
Foretich last year in Fairfax County, Va., Circuit Court.
   The evidence includes statements of alleged sexual abuse made by
the child, as well as allegations by Hilary's half-sister that she
was also abused while in the custody of their father.
   Foretich, an oral surgeon in northern Virginia, claims that
physical injuries to Hilary were caused by Morgan. He also has
offered a reward for information about the whereabouts of his
daughter.
   Morgan's attorneys have asked the District of Columbia Court of
Appeals to review Morgan's jailing, but the court is not expected
to consider the matter until next May.
   The whereabouts of Hilary, who turns 6 on Aug. 21, remain
unknown.

   An appeals council ruled Wednesday that a
Palestinian held here is the man wanted in the United States for
the 1982 in-flight bombing of a Pan Am jetliner, opening the way
for his eventual extradition.
   Police have said his imprisonment may have figured in the
terrorist attack on a Greek cruise ship last month.
   Palestine Liberation Organization officials said they would
fight extradition.
   ``The Palestinian held in prison and whose extradition is being
sought by the United States, is Mohammed Rashid ... not Mohammed
Hamdan as he claims,'' said the ruling, issued by the three-member
council after a closed-door session.
   The council decides whether cases should proceed for action. It
was convened to determine the identity of the prisoner, arrested by
police at Athens airport May 29 after a tip from the U.S. Embassy.
   The United States has asked for the extradition of Mohammed
Rashid, 39, on charges of planting a bomb aboard a Pan Am jumbo jet
in 1982. The blast killed a Japanese teen-ager and injured 15
people as the jet flew over Hawaii.
   The appeals council accepted the finding of District Attorney
Ioannis Lambropoulos and rejected Rashid's claim that police had
arrested the wrong man.
   An extradition hearing was set for Thursday. Under Greek law,
however, Rashid cannot be extradited until he has served a
seven-month jail sentence for entering Greece on a forged Syrian
passport in the name of Mohammed Hamdan. The Palestinian was
convicted of the passport charge and sentenced on July 11.
   Police theorized that a machine-gun and hand grenade attack
aboard the City of Poros cruise ship on July 11 may have been a
failed attempt to take passengers hostage and force the
Palestinian's release. The attack killed nine people and injured
98. The vessel was carrying 471 foreign passengers.
   Greek authorities have been stymied in their investigation of
the attack.
   U.S. officials have said Rashid also was involved in a bomb
blast aboard a TWA jetliner flying over Greece in 1986. Four
Americans were killed in the explosion, but the TWA bombing is not
mentioned in the extradition request.
   The diplomatic adviser of the PLO mission in Greece, Anwar
Akraa, told the appeals council the Palestinian was a member of the
PLO, which knew him as Mohammed Hamdan.
   Rashid, dressed in tan trousers and shirt, refused to comment
after testifying before the appeals council.
   He was identified when his fingerprints matched those of
Mohammed Rashid, jailed in Greece from 1973-76 on narcotics
smuggling charges. His prints also matched Interpol records, police
said.

   Divers searched the Willimantic River on
Wednesday for missing military explosives, including a projectile
that could kill people within 150 feet, authorities said.
   State police said some of the explosives, discovered Monday
night by a passer-by on the side of the river, could have been
picked up by souvenir hunters.
   ``We've called all the newspapers and radio stations to try to
get the word out that people shouldn't go near these things,'' said
police spokeswoman Marcy Stamm.
   Some explosives were recovered on the bank of the river in a
remote area Tuesday after the man who found them brought police to
the site.
   The man, whom police would not identify, had apparently taken a
60mm mortar and a TNT-packed cannon round home with him before a
friend advised him to notify police.
   When he took police back to the site, the man said some of the
explosives were missing.
   Stamm said state police believe an additional 60mm mortar, eight
smoke cannisters and seven detonators remain missing. The 60mm
mortar is a 13-inch, cone-shaped projectile with fins that is
packed with three-quarters of a pound of high explosives, she said.
   About four or five divers and the state police Emergency
Services Unit bomb squad were searching the river and the area
around its banks, she said.
   Agents from the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms
and U.S. Army bomb technicians were trying to trace the origin of
the explosives.
   Authorities believe the explosives were stolen and recently left
along the banks of the river. The recovered explosives, marked with
serial numbers, were not rusty and appeared new, state police
Trooper John Duley said.

   A water-only fast by United Farm Workers
President Cesar Chavez is endangering his health and he faces the
threat of kidney failure, a doctor who examined him said.
   Chavez's uric acid is three times the acceptable level, said Dr.
Augusto Ortiz, who also examined Chavez during a 1972 fast. The
fast entered its 18th day Wednesday and Chavez has not said how
long it will continue. He went 25 days without food in 1968 and
again in 1972 to advance farm worker issues.
   ``If this level is not brought down, it can lead to serious
complications, including kidney failure,'' Ortiz said in a
statement released by union officials.
   Chavez is fasting to promote the union's boycott of California
table grapes. He has no contract among those growers and is
demanding that use of five pesticides be abolished. In a July 25
statement, Chavez said he began the fast after becoming
disillusioned about the problems created by pesticide use.
   He claims pesticides have poisoned croplands and caused cancer
in residents in farm towns, such as nearby McFarland where 13
children have been diagnosed with cancer.
   Children of the late Sen. Robert F. Kennedy plan to visit Chavez
on Thursday in this community 150 miles north of Los Angeles to
support the fast, union spokeswoman Lorena Parlee said. Kennedy was
with Chavez in 1968 when he broke his fast.
   Chavez has lost 10 pounds since he began the fast on midnight
July 16, Dr. Fidel Huerta said.

   Mathias Rust flew home Wednesday
after being released early from his Soviet prison sentence for
buzzing the Kremlin spires, and the young pilot admitted that his
1987 stunt was an irresponsible act.
   ``I arrived as a child, now I go back as an adult. It's really
remarkable,'' Rust said in an interview with The Associated Press
on a Lufthansa flight from Moscow to Frankfurt.
   The 20-year-old who stunned the world and embarrassed the Red
Army brass by piloting a single-enging plane from Finland through
the vaunted Soviet air defenses and landing in Red Square said in
the future he would commit ``no crimes.''
   Calm and bordering on smugness, the bespectacled young man said
he would wait to tell the world the whole story of his 15 months in
the nearly empty Lefortovo Prison, but he did say he felt isolation
and despair during his time behind bars, although he was treated
well.
   Asked why he thought the Soviets released him early from his
four-year sentence for malicious mischief, Rust said only:
``Humanity.''
   Would it do it over again if he could? ``No, not again,'' he
replied. ``It was not responsible.''
   He described the flight as ``only the beginning'' of his efforts
to draw East and West together.
   ``I will continue the work, but no crimes, only legal things,''
he told the AP. He spoke mostly in English, with a smattering of
German and Russian.
   Rust, sporting a short haircut and dressed in a blue plaid
sports jacket, blue slacks and a blue-and-red tie, seemed exuberant
and looked healthy, adding that rather than losing weight in
prison, he had gained some.
   He said he had exercised regularly, read a lot, and repaired
books at the prison library. He had high praise for his jailers and
the conditions he endured.
   ``It's very nice because a year ago people thought you would be
tortured in prison,'' Rust said. ``They thought. `KGB _ good
heavens!' No, we see there is no torture, no adverse conditions.''
   He added: ``They treat people there like we do in our country.''
   During the three-hour flight from Moscow, Rust was invited into
cockpit and chatted for several minutes with pilot Werner Winkler.
He sat in first class, munching butter cookies, accepting accolades
from fellow passengers and signing autographs.
   A stewardess gave him a small plastic airplane, a gesture that
elicited laughs and a few sweeps with the plastic model.
   Earlier Wednesday, the official Tass news agency quoted him as
saying: ``I realize that I have committed serious criminal offenses
and the fact that the Presidium of the U.S.S.R. Supreme Soviet
freed me from punishment before I served my term is an act of
humanism.''
   The West German media hailed his release, although a TV station
reported that Rust could face more charges for his stunt once he
returns home to Wedel, near Hamburg.
   Tass said the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, the country's
highest executive body, decreed earlier in the day that Rust ``be
freed from further serving his term and expelled from the Soviet
Union.''
   ``Mathias Rust is Free!'' the Frankfurter Rundschau newspaper
trumpeted in a banner headline Wednesday after his release was
announced in Moscow. Underneath was a picture of the bespectacled
Rust with his tousled hair.
   West Germany's ZDF television network reported on that Rust
still may have to answer before a West German court, quoting the
prosecutor's office in the city of Itzehoe as saying that an
investigation against Rust was still open. The prosecutor has been
investigating possible charges of endangering air traffic and fraud
against Rust.
   ``Rust will soon be questioned about that,'' the network said.
   A reporter who tried to speak with Rust's mother, Monika, was
turned away from the family home by three reporters from Hamburg's
Stern magazine, which has an exclusive contract with the family for
the rights to his story.
   Tass accused Rust of an ``unprecedented act of hooliganism in
the air'' when he penetrated Soviet airspace in a single-engine
Cessna on May 28, 1987, near the air corridor used by international
flights approaching Moscow's Sheremetyevo Airport.
   Rust's dramatic flight from Helsinki, Finland, across Soviet
Estonia and on to Moscow shook the foundation of Soviet security
and prompted the ouster of Defense Minister Sergei L. Sokolov and
Air Defense chief Alexander Koldunov.
   Soviet jets scrambled to intercept Rust's plane when it was
detected crossing into Soviet airspace, but no action was taken to
halt the flight and apparently no word of warning about the
incident was sent forward to Moscow.
   A tourist videotaped the final minutes of Rust's flight,
capturing the Cessna gentle swoop over Red Square before coming to
rest before dozens of stunned spectators. Rust, then 19, greeting
bewildered onlookers after his landing on the cobblestones.
   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev and Sokolov were in Berlin at
the time of Rust's flight for a Warsaw Pact meeting. Two days after
Rust's landing and arrest, Sokolov was sent into retirement for the
lapse and Koldunov was fired.
   Rust said at his trial that he made the flight to promote world
peace. But the Soviet Supreme Court said Rust was interested in
promoting himself.
   He was found guilty Sept. 4, 1987, of illegally entering the
Soviet Union, violating international flight rules, and malicious
hooliganism, and sentenced to four years in a Soviet labor camp.
   He remained in Lefortovo, however.
   ``Having served just over a quarter of the term to which he was
sentenced by the court, Mathias Rust was released. The Soviet Union
has shown its humaneness again,'' Tass said.
   The West German government had worked for Rust's release and
government spokesman Norbert Shaefer told The Associated Press in
Bonn that ``the federal government is pleased with this step.''
   Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher specifically brought up
the Rust case when he traveled to Moscow for talks with Gorbachev
and other Soviet leaders last week to prepare for the scheduled
October summit between Gorbachev and West German Chancellor Helmut
Kohl.

   A high State Department official, disputing
news accounts, said Thursday the foreign ministers of four Central
American countries shared a U.S. commitment to ``authentic
democracy'' in Nicaragua.
   Morris Busby, special U.S. envoy to the region, said the United
States was pleased with the results of the session Monday in
Guatemala with Secretary of State George P. Shultz. ``Reporting
this was a failed initiative just wasn't true,'' he said.
   Busby said the statement issued after Shultz's meeting with the
four ministers represented ``a shared commitment to authentic
democracy'' even though it addressed issues in broad terms.
   The communique did not mention Nicaragua and was limited to
general support for democratic principles. News accounts from
Guatemala said Shultz and the foreign ministers of Costa Rica, El
Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras had failed to agree on a strong
denunciation of Nicaragua.
   Shultz will return to the region next Wednesday after touring
South America for meetings with the leaders of the four Central
American countries.
   Busby told reporters at a briefing that the ministers had
decided not to issue an ``analysis'' of the Nicaraguan situation.
``There was a disagreement over whether it was too bold,'' he said.
   But, Busby said, ``I would disagree that we came away
disappointed. The results the meeting produced were important.''
   Shultz did not seek a meeting with Nicaraguan President Daniel
Ortega and does not plan to talk to him when they attend a
presidential inauguration ceremony in Ecuador or when Shultz
returns to Central America.
   Busby said U.S. policy rules out a meeting with Sandinista
officials until progress is made in their negotiations with the
U.S.-backed guerrillas, known as Contras.

<HEAD>Agreement Said Reached On Kuwait Arms Package</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM AHERN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration and congressional
critics of selling weapons to Kuwait have reached agreement on an
arms package for the Arab nation which includes some Maverick
missiles, two of the critics said Wednesday.
   Kuwait has agreed to certain restrictions aimed at preventing
the weapons from being used against Israel and the deal should go
ahead, said Reps. Larry Smith, D-Fla., and Mel Levine, D-Calif.
   The Reagan administration told Congress a month ago that it
intended to sell $1.9 billion worth of F-18 jets and missiles to
the tiny Arab nation at the top of the Persian Gulf. The missiles
were to include Mavericks, Sidewinders, Sparrows, and Harpoons.
   Kuwait said it wanted the weapons to defend itself against Iran,
but critics said the jets and the missiles could be turned against
Israel. The Senate voted to strip the Mavericks from the sale.
   Under the compromise, said Smith, the sale of the 40 F-18s will
go ahead, but the delivery date will be delayed one year, to 1994.
The original intention was to deliver the planes by 1993. Kuwait
will be required to return one of its aging U.S.-made A-4 planes
for each F-18 it receives.
   The deal will only include the ``G'' anti-ship version of the
Maverick, rather than the more sophisticated ``D'' Maverick, Smith
said.
   In addition, Kuwait will be prohibited from buying equipment
that would permit in-flight refueling of the F-18s, a ban which
would mean the jets couldn't be used to fly against Israel.
   ``We have altered this package so that it now satisfies the
legitimate defense needs of the Kuwaitis and reduces its potential
as an offensive threat to the region or to Israel,'' Smith said at
a news conference.
   After the Senate decision last month to bar the Maverick portion
of the deal, Kuwait announced that it had reached a separate
weapons deal with the Soviet Union.
   Administration officials had pushed for the Kuwaiti deal as a
way of assuring Mideast nations that the United States could be a
reliable supplier. Saudi Arabia agreed to buy sophisticated weapons
from the British after a U.S. arms package ran into congressional
opposition.
   For the past 13 months, the United States has been escorting
reflagged Kuwaiti tankers in the gulf, protecting the ships from
Iranian attacks.

<TEXT>
   Wading chest deep into the
Jordan River, defrocked preacher Jimmy Swaggart blessed his three
grandchildren Wednesday, then immersed their heads in the cool
water and baptized them.
   The midday ceremony was a highlight of the TV evangelist's
eight-day tour of holy sites in Israel and the occupied West Bank.
He is accompanied by about 350 followers.
   Before the baptism, Swaggart sat on the stone embankment and
explained the significance of the ceremony to his granchildren,
Jennifer Kay, 11, Gabriel Lee, 8, and Matthew Aaron, 7.
   ``By being baptized, you will be saved,'' Swaggart said as
Matthew Aaron fidgeted beside him.
   Following the children's baptism, more than 200 of Swaggart's
followers formed a line along the embankment, some weeping, to wait
their turn to step into the water. Many wore white robes or dresses
over their bathing suits.
   ``Do you acknowledge the Lord as the lord of your life?''
ministers traveling with the group asked the pilgrims. ``Are you
born again and promise to live for Him for the rest of your life?''
   The pilgrims answered ``yes'' before the minisers dipped them
backward into the water. Swaggart only baptized his grandchildren.
   ``To be baptized in the Jordan River is an unspeakable joy,''
said Anne Marie Murray, 45, of New Haven, Conn. ``I've never felt
so close to the Lord.''
   ``It's great, very significant because Jesus was baptized in the
Jordan,'' said a beaming Morris Jones, 51, of Morgan Hill, Calif.,
after stepping out of the water.
   The ceremony took place in a shaded section of the river on the
southern tip of the Sea of Galilee that is set aside for baptisms.
   According to the Bible, Jesus was anointed by John the Baptist
in the Jordan River, but the exact site is not known.
   Roman Catholics and other denominations mark the baptism once a
year at river sites near the biblical city of Jericho, about 20
miles east of Jerusalem.
   Since arriving in Israel July 29, Swaggart and his entourage
have visited Jerusalem, Bethlehem and a nearby Jewish settlement.
   Swaggart has said he came, in part, to express support for
Israel which has been the target of international crticism for its
crackdown on the 8-month-old Palestinian uprising.
   Swaggart, who runs a TV ministry that reaches 2 million viewers
from its base in Baton Rouge, La., stepped down from the pulpit in
February after confessing to sinning against his wife. A prostitute
said he paid her to strip and perform lewd acts for him during
visits to a motel.
   Officials of the Louisiana Assemblies of God denomination
revoked his ministry credentials after he returned to the pulpit in
May against their wishes.
   Pilgrims on the tour said the scandal has not diminished their
faith in the Louisiana preacher.
   ``We know the sincerity of (Swaggart's) ministry and his work
all over the world,'' said Ms. Murray. ``All of us have renewed our
commitment to support this ministry.''

   Parents often overlook the emotional
impact sending a child to college has on their own lives,
especially if it's the youngest son or daughter, says a campus
psychologist.
   ``They have to rethink their whole lives in the family,'' Alan
F. Kreisler, director of counseling at Susquehanna University, said
Wednesday.
   ``You can't overestimate how emotional that day is _ whether
it's your first child or your last child to head to college. That
day will have an enormous impact on your lives,'' he said.
   Kreisler said family members should talk about what they expect
from each other before the child goes to college.
   All parents react differently, but for most the emotional impact
of the last or only child going to school is the greatest,
according to Kreisler.
   Often, parents are faced with a quiet home absent of the child
or children who have been the focus of the parents' lives for at
least 18 years, Kreisler said.
   ``The couple has to relearn to deal with each other,'' he said.
   Many times, the result is depression or bickering between the
husband and wife until they re-establish their lives as a couple,
Kreisler said.
   Parents should also expect big changes when the first child goes
to college, Kreisler said.
   ``All the relationships change. All of a sudden No. 2 kid is No.
1, so the attention he or she gets changes,'' he said.
   Parents should resist being overly protective of children going
to college, Kreisler advised. ``You want the kid to develop into an
independent person, but you want to know the family is still
there,'' he said.
   Parents also should expect freshman-year rebelliousness from
their children, Kreisler said. They need to plan how they'll react
if a son comes home with a pierced ear or punk haircut, or if a
daughter announces she's signed up to live in a co-ed dormitory.
   Parents should be honest with a child but shouldn't try to stop
a son or daughter from adapting a new lifestyle unless they
consider it dangerous, such as drug or alcohol abuse, Kreisler said.

   Thirteen more anti-abortion demonstrators were
arrested at an abortion clinic Wednesday in the fourth protest
staged by a group called Operation Rescue.
   The 13 refused to give their names when they were booked on
charges of criminal trespass, unlawful assembly and disorderly
conduct, said police spokesman Cal Jackson. They also were charged
with giving false names.
   Since the first demonstration July 19 during the Democratic
National Convention, 170 people have been arrested, including those
Wednesday. More than 100 remain in jail because they refuse to give
their names, identifying themselves only as ``Baby Jane Doe'' or
``Baby John Doe.''
   Two dozen police officers were on hand as demonstrators gathered
at the Feminist Women's Health Center. When the activists refused
to leave, police arrested them. Another 20 abortion opponents who
arrived later carried picket signs and unfurled banners.
   Atlanta authorities have said the protesters will remain in jail
without bond unless they agree to identify themselves. Only a few
have done so during the court hearings held for them so far.

<HEAD>Bakker Says PTL Documents Destroyed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   PTL founder Jim Bakker said under oath
that thousands of internal ministry documents and letters have been
altered, buried or destroyed since he resigned in March 1987.
   Bakker, who PTL records say received nearly $8.3 million in
salary, bonuses and perks in 1983-87, also said he was underpaid.
   Bakker made the comments in a sworn deposition as he prepared to
defend himself against a $52 million lawsuit by PTL, which charges
he grossly mismanaged the TV ministry.
   ``I have reason to dispute all records of PTL at this time ...
because of hostile people who took over Heritage USA,'' Bakker said
in a July 18 deposition, sworn answers to attorneys' questions. He
also was deposed on July 22.
   The Charlotte Observer said in a story in Wednesday's editions
it obtained the depositions, which have not been filed court.
   The PTL lawsuit alleges that Bakker and former aide David
Taggart took millions of dollars from PTL for their personal use,
although they knew the ministry was in financial trouble. Bakker
resigned following revelations of his tryst with former church
secretary Jessica Hahn.
   The ministry has been reorganizing under Chapter 11 bankruptcy
proceedings since June 1987 and must sell the Heritage USA theme
park and its other assets to pay debts. Bankruptcy trustee M.C.
``Red'' Benton has said he expects to recommend a buyer this month.
   The suit is scheduled for trial Sept. 12 in U.S. Bankruptcy
Court in Columbia.
   In his deposition, Bakker stated:
   _ ``People ... have come to my office to tell me that they have
lied under oath to destroy me.''
   _ ``Corporate records were destroyed wholesaley (sic).''
   _ ``Also, tens of thousands of letters personally addressed to
me ... are buried on these grounds.''
   Bakker said the destruction of documents and letters was ordered
by subordinates of the Rev. Jerry Falwell, who became PTL's
chairman in March 1987, after Bakker resigned in a sex and money
scandal. Falwell served until October 1987.
   Falwell spokesman Mark DeMoss denied Bakker's allegations.
   ``It would not have been in our best interest to destroy any
documents,'' DeMoss said. ``We couldn't get our hands on documents
fast enough, that we were trying to preserve, because so much of
the documents and records there are not the kinds of things, I
think, Jim Bakker would want preserved. ... A lot of them were
pretty incriminating.''
   Bakker attorney Jim Toms told PTL lawyers that he will seek a
court order to excavate the site where Bakker claims many documents
are buried.

<HEAD>Treasury Announces Quarterly Auctions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Treasury Department announced Wednesday it
will borrow $29 billion to replenish government coffers next week,
but for the first time in six years will not issue 30-year bonds.
   Every three months, the government holds three debt sales to
finance the $2.5 trillion national debt. It sells three-year notes,
10-year notes and 30-year bonds.
   Charles O. Sethness, assistant Treasury secretary for domestic
finance, said the government will not issue 30-year bonds this time
because it has used practically all of its congressional authority
to do so.
   House and Senate bills that include provisions freeing the
Treasury to issue long-term debt have passed committees in both
chambers. However, the bills must pass both the full House and
Senate and any differences would have to be reconciled in
negotiations between the two bodies.
   ``We are hopeful the Congress will act soon,'' Sethness said.
``... When bond authority legislation is enacted, we expect to
return to our regular schedule.''
   The auctions next week call for:
   _$11 billion in three-year notes in minimum denominations of
$5,000 to be auctioned Tuesday.
   _$11 billion in 10-year notes in minimum denominations of $1,000
to be auctioned Wednesday.
   _$7 billion in 248-day cash management bills in minimum
denominations of $1,000 to be issued Thursday.
   The $22 billion in notes includes $14.8 billion to pay off
maturing securities and $7.2 billion in new cash.
   The note auctions are about in line with analysts' expectations
and represented a $4 billion reduction from the last quarterly
auctions, when $26 billion was raised.
   Sethness said the cash management bills will be repaid on April
20 and are intended help smooth government revenue flows, which
normally surge in April as people pay their income taxes.

the department said Wednesday.
   Spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said Ann B. Wrobleski, assistant

Venezuela, Colombia, Equador, Peru and Bolivia.
   ``While in these various countries, she will be meeting with

   The United States has been pressing Latin-American countries to
curb narcotics production and shipments to the United States,
especially cocaine.

   The nation's 13 largest airlines in June had
their best record of on-time flights since the government began
issuing reports on the carriers' performance, the Department of
Transportation reported Wednesday.
   In its latest monthly report, the department said 84.3 percent
of the airlines' flights that were tallied operated on schedule.
Since the government began releasing the figures last September,
the best previous performance had been in April, when 82.6 percent
of the flights were reported to be on time.
   The improvement came even as the airlines began their annual
summertime crunch period, a season when air traffic increases as
people take vacations.
   America West Airlines had the best performance, reporting that
92.8 percent of flights operated on schedule. Southwest Airlines
was next best at 90.8 percent, and American took third place with
an 88.2 percent record.
   At the other end of the spectrum, Pan American had the worst
on-time percentage at 72.2 percent, followed by US Air with 76.6
percent and Trans World Airlines with 79 percent.
   The department considers a flight to be on time if it arrives at
or departs from a gate within 15 minutes of schedule. Flights that
are delayed for mechanical reasons are not counted because the
officials who created the reporting system feared that otherwise,
they would penalize carriers that hold back planes that are having
equipment problems.
   The airlines are required to report their on-time performances
at 27 of the country's busiest airports, although most carriers
submit figures for more airfields than that. At the required
airports, the 13 carriers' overall on-time performance was 83.4
percent.
   In July, the department logged 1,964 complaints from passengers
about U.S. airlines, up from the 1,707 complaints received in June.
The total continued a trend in which complaints have dropped
dramatically from a year ago. DOT received 6,561 complaints in July
1987.
   As has been the case before, Continental Airlines had the
largest number of complaints per 100,000 passengers flown, 11.54.
Pan Am had the second highest ratio of complaints at 10.87, while
Eastern Airlines was third with 9.05.
   Air Wisconsin had the lowest ratio of complaints with 0.46.
Southwest was next best with 0.98, while Delta Airlines was third
lowest with 1.19.
   It is believed that only a small number of passengers who have
problems with flights bother to complain to the Transportation
Department.

<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Democratic presidential candidate Jesse
Jackson said Wednesday that George Bush is not ``morally fit'' to
be president because the likely Republican nominee has failed to
support civil rights legislation.
   ``Throughout 7{ years of the most miserable civil rights record
of any recent administration, Mr. Bush has chosen not to say a
mumblin' word,'' Jackson told a crowd of about 4,000 at the
National Urban League Convention.
   ``Mr. Bush opposed the Civil Rights Restoration Act. Anyone who
opposed the Civil Rights Restoration Act is not morally fit to lead
this nation.''
   Jackson listed his ``10 clear reasons'' why he supports
Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis over Bush and urged those in
attendance to vote Democratic in November.
   Jackson cited Dukakis' support for civil rights, child care,
education, statehood for the District of Columbia and total
economic isolation of the apartheid South African government by the
world community. He also noted Dukakis' opposition to aid to the
Nicaraguan Contra rebels and unreasonable defense spending.
   ``Like Moses, if we use our rod we can part the seas and move
closer to Canaan Land,'' Jackson said. ``But if we don't use our
rod, our vote, and drop it, it will turn into a snake and go to
Washington and bite us.''
   Jackson said he agrees with Dukakis' view of government, saying
it is an instrument of public service. On the other hand, Bush
believes government is ``an instrument to enrich the few and starve
the many,'' he said.
   The former Democratic candidate said his unsuccessful bid for
the presidential nomination was a victory. ``Victory is that the
reasonable expectations of our leaders and our children have been
raised,'' he said.
   The crowd stood and cheered as Jackson shouted, ``I may not get
to the White House, but our children will, our children will, our
children will ...''
   Jackson wouldn't detail his plans for the future, but told the
crowd, ``I don't want a job.'' He said his job is taking their case
before the people.
   Asked after the address to be more specific, he told reporters,
``Unemployed people need a job. I don't need a job.''

   The Soviet Union opened this
strategic Black Sea port to Frank Carlucci after the U.S. defense
secretary held what he described as constructive talks Wednesday
with President Andrei A. Gromyko.
   Carlucci was the first U.S. official to visit Sevastopol,
headquarters of the Soviet Black Sea Fleet, since President
Franklin D. Roosevelt did so in 1945 during his Yalta summit with
Josef Stalin and Prime Minister Winston Churchill of Britain.
   Carlucci took a boat from Yalta to Sevastopol on the Crimean
Peninsula after meeting with Gromyko in Massandra, a small town
four miles from Yalta.
   He told reporters his session with the 79-year-old president,
who served nearly three decades as foreign minister, was ``very
constructive.''
   ``Obviously we did not agree on all things but we found areas of
agreement,'' he said. Carlucci did not give details of the talks
but said they touched on arms control.
   Tass, the official news agency, said Gromyko identified
elimination of nuclear arms as the current ``problem of problems''
and lamented slow progress in U.S.-Soviet talks on long-range
weapons now under way in Geneva.
   Peace will benefit from anything President Reagan can do to
``breathe fresh energy'' into the talks during the last months of
his administration, he said, and called for greater understanding
and trust between the superpowers.
   ``Let us arrange things in such a way so that your arm is never
lifted against us, and ours against you,'' Tass quoted him as
saying.
   Carlucci and his delegation were in the third day of an official
visit to the Soviet Union during which close inspection has been
allowed of some previously secret Kremlin hardware and military
bases.
   He was greeted by a brass band and a naval honor guard, then met
with Mikhail N. Khronopulo, admiral of the fleet. On Thursday, he
is to board a Soviet missile cruiser.
   Gromyko greeted Carlucci in Massandra at an opulent summer
mansion Stalin had used. They shook hands in a wood-paneled room of
the Alexander Mansion with a spectacular view of the Black Sea
about 360 yards below.
   The heavily guarded mansion was built by Czar Alexander III and
finished in 1902, but Alexander never lived there. It has been used
in recent years to receive foreign dignitaries. The last American
to stay there was industrialist Armand Hammer in 1981, according to
building supervisor Nikolai I. Tupikov.
   Gromyko showed off the surroundings to Carlucci, asking, ``Have
you seen the scenery?'' as they sat down for discussions at the
vacation site.
   ``It's beautiful here, lovely here,'' Carlucci responded.
   Plantings of pink and red roses dotted the lush, carefully
manicured grounds with fountains and pine, cedar, pear and apricot
trees.
   Inside the mansion, Carlucci and Assistant Secretary of Defense
Ron Lehman sat on red velvet chairs beneath a watercolor painting
by C. Robert Kammer of a Crimean sunset.
   They faced Soviet Defense Minister Dmitri T. Yazov and Gromyko
across a long wooden table in the second floor meeting room
decorated with Dutch-made porcelain floor tiles.
   Gromyko is in the Crimea on vacation and has been staying at
another summer residence about six miles away along the Black Sea
coast. He told Carlucci that their meeting venue was used as a
residence by Stalin during the 1945 Yalta Conference.
   The visiting U.S. official arrived in the Soviet Union on Monday
and held a round of talks with Yazov before addressing the
Voroshilov Academy of the General Staff.
   On Tuesday he visited the Kubinka Air Force Base and sat inside
the cockpit of the top-secret Blackjack bomber _ the first look
ever allowed a Western official, then watched over Soviet war games
at the Taman motorized rifle division base southwest of the capital.

<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government will demand abolishing a
U.S. Air Force base near Athens used to monitor Soviet fleet
movements in the Mediterranean Sea, an official said Wednesday.
   Greek government spokesman Sotiris Kostopoulos said the base
will be dropped from a new operating agreement for American
military installations in Greece.
   ``One of the decisions reached by the Greek government is the
abolition of Hellenikon air base,'' he said.
   Kostopoulos' statement, which caught Western diplomats here by
surprise, conflicted with a background briefing given by a senior
Foreign Ministry official on Tuesday. The official said Hellenikon
base might remain open.
   In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said
the United States had not received formal notification of closure
of Hellenikon base and would not comment on it. A spokeswoman for
the U.S. Embassy in Athens also refused to comment.
   Greek and American officials are negotiating a new U.S. bases
agreement to replace an existing five-year accord that expires at
the end of December.
   However, the talks have faltered over Greek efforts to link them
with its longstanding disputes with Turkey. American officials have
refused to connect the two issues.
   Kostopoulos also dismissed reports that Hellenikon air base,
next to Athens Airport, might be transferred to another location or
simply merged with another American base on the southern Aegean
island of Crete.
   ``In no way does the abolition of this base mean a transfer to
Crete and specifically Souda Bay or any other location on the
island,'' he said.
   The United States maintains a Sixth Fleet supply base in Souda
Bay and an Air Force communications station in Gournes, also on
Crete.
   Hellenikon, 10 miles from Athens, is a support base used by
reconnaisance planes to monitor Soviet fleet movements in the
eastern Mediterranean. It is one of four U.S. bases operating in
Greece since the early 1950s.
   A U.S. Navy communications base is also located near Athens, in
the town of Nea Makri, about 20 miles from the city.
   Negotiations for a new agreement have been under way since
November 1987. Kostopoulos has said there has been no significant
progress in eight rounds of talks and that there ``continued to be
a difference of views.''
   As a form of rent for the bases, Greece receives more than $300
million yearly in U.S. military credits.
   A new round of talks on the U.S. bases is scheduled to start
Sept. 9.
   The Greek government issued a formal shutdown notice on July 13
for all U.S. bases operating in Greece, but the legal formality
does not necessarily mean that all the installations will close.
   Moreover, if Greek and American negotiators are unable to reach
agreement, the present accord gives the United States 17 months
after its expiration to dismantle the bases.
   Socialist Premier Andreas Papandreou insists that the United
States should help solve Greek-Turkish disputes over military
control of the Aegean Sea and the divided island of Cyprus in
return for a new agreement.
   Kostopoulos said in his statement that any prospective agreement
``will have to serve Greece's highest national interests.'' The
disputes with Turkey are often referred to in that way.
   The spokesman also advised American officials ``to take the
Greek government's positions into consideration before they make
useless and untimely statements.''
   Earlier this week, Kostopoulos rejected reported statements by
U.S. Secretary of Defense Frank Carlucci. A Turkish newspaper said
Carlucci vowed the United States would never give guarantees about
a NATO country to another member country of the military alliance.
   Both Greece and Turkey belong to the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization.
   The report also quoted Carlucci as saying that Washington had
already made this point to Greece.
   Kostopoulos said that Carlucci's statements ``cast doubt on the
value of the (bases) dialogue.''

<TEXT>
   The city and three councilmen paid $1,600
in contempt fines Wednesday, while the mayor warned that city
workers could be laid off this month unless Yonkers complies with a
federal housing desegregation order.
   U.S. District Judge Leonard Sand found the city and three
council members in contempt Tuesday for refusing to build
low-income housing units. Yonkers' $100 fine will double daily and
would wipe out the city's $337 million budget in 22 days.
   With a majority on the council opposed to the order _ and
unmoved so far by their own $500-a-day fines _ the city hoped to
get a quick stay of the contempt finding.
   State officials, meanwhile, considered a plan to seize control
of the city's purse strings and remove members of the Yonkers City
Council.
   Yonkers, the state's fourth-largest city with a population of
just under 200,000, has been in a legal tug-of-war with Sand since
1985, when the judge found the city liable for intentionally
segregating its housing and schools over a 40-year period.
   Abutting New York City, Yonkers is 21 square miles of diversity,
ranging from rundown tenements to homes with lush lawns in
neighborhoods proud of their Scarsdale and Bronxville ZIP codes.
   Some residents opposed to the desegregation plan have
aggressively battled the council. Members were sent bullets in the
mail when the council approved a consent decree in the case in
January.
   ``If you don't want to change your environment, a judge
shouldn't do it, for you,'' said Vincent DeMarco, a resident for
all his 21 years. ``We want to keep this place decent. I don't know
how the judge can say a vote isn't right.''
   Allen Cunningham moved here two years ago from Brooklyn.
   ``I don't think what he (Sand) did was really right,'' said
Cunningham, who is black. ``We can only look, listen and learn. It
can help blacks who are trying to make a decent life. My 3-year-old
son should have a decent place to play, not some drug-infested
place. But it may make matters worse between black and white.''
   A school integration program is entering its third year, but
city officials have refused to build 200 units of low-income
housing on the city's predominantly white east side and 800 units
of low- and moderate-income housing throughout the city.
   On Monday, the City Council voted 4-3 not to endorse a package
of bonuses, financial incentives and zoning variances to attract
developers to build the 800 units. Three of the four council
members voting in the majority were found in contempt; a decision
on the fourth is pending because he asked the court for time to get
a lawyer.
   Yonkers' counsel, Paul Pickelle, said a transcript of Tuesday's
contempt hearing and other documents on the city's request for a
stay were sent to Judge J. Daniel Mahoney of the 2nd U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals.
   Mayor Nicholas Wasiscko, one of the three council members who
voted for the housing plan, warned that two-week layoff notices
would be sent to municipal workers Friday, but City Manager Neil
DeLuca said he would wait at least a week before preparing what he
calls a ``doomsday scenario'' for layoffs of the city's estimated
1,800 municipal workers.
   ``I don't want to scare everyone,'' DeLuca said. ``Come Aug. 16
or Aug. 17, I will notify 70 to 80 percent of the non-essential
work force that they're laid off. We won't get to police or
firefighters until Aug. 22.''
   The city manager's office has ordered city workers not to talk
to reporters.
   Wasiscko said Monday's defiance was the result of
``frustration'' over the issue. He noted that Yonkers has 6,800
units of low-income housing while neighboring suburbs such as
Scarsdale have none.
   DeLuca said he was hoping for action by the Emergency Financial
Control Board, the fiscal watchdog installed by the state after
Yonkers' 1984 brush with bankruptcy.
   The Control Board can take over the power of spending from the
City Council to implement the housing plan and can recommend
council members' removal from office. The board planned to meet
Thursday.
   Sand urged Gov. Mario Cuomo, who has the power to remove elected
officials from office, to step in and help resolve the crisis.
   But Cuomo spokesman Gary Fryer said, ``At the moment, there is
no need for us to act.''

<TEXT>
   Less than three weeks after assuming office in
a hotly contested election, new Teamsters President William J.
McCarthy has fired two of the union's top regional officials along
with its chief attorney.
   Teamster officials confirmed Wednesday that McCarthy a day
earler replaced Robert Holmes and Edward Lawson as directors of the
union's central and Canadian conferences.
   Both men, who retain their elected seats on the union's
18-member, policy-setting executive board and titles as
international vice presidents, had supported Secretary-Treasurer
Weldon Mathis for the top Teamsters job after the death last month
of Jackie Presser.
   Mathis, who was Presser's designated heir and had served as
interim president while Presser was undergoing brain surgery, was
defeated by McCarthy on a 9-8 vote by the Teamsters' executive
board July. 15.
   At a board meeting Tuesday, McCarthy won approval on a 10-8 vote
to replace Holmes, 76, of Detroit, as director of the union's
13-state, 600,000-member Central Council with Daniel C. Ligurotis
of Chicago.
   Ligurotis, who started his Teamster career 44 years ago as a
truck driver's helper in Chicago, was elected to the union's
executive board last summer.
   He had voted for McCarthy in a successful bid by old guard East
Coast Teamster leaders to deny the presidency to Mathis, who worked
with Presser in trying to attack the corruption stigma that has
plagued the union for decades through gradual reforms and
aggressive public and government relations.
   Holmes, a confidant of the former Teamster President James R.
Hoffa since the early 1930s organizing wars in the Midwest, had
favored calling a special convention of 2,000 union delegates from
around the country to pick a successor for Presser.
   Lawson, 57, of Vancouver, British Columbia, had been head of the
union's 200,000-member Canadian Conference since its creation in
1976 and has been a vice president and board member of the union
since 1971.
   McCarthy engineered his replacement by Louis Lacroix of
Montreal, who has been head of the union's brewery and soft drinks
division in Canada since 1975.
   Lawson said Wednesday he was ``very angry'' and added: ``It's
not the kind of thing you'd expect a trade union to do.''
   The new Teamsters president also succeeded Tuesday in elevating
his top assistant at Local 25 in Boston, which McCarthy also heads,
to the vacant seat left on the union's board by Presser's death
last month.
   Frank Hackett, 54, of Sommerville, Mass., a business agent in
the Boston local since 1973, was elected as the union's 16th vice
president on a 9-8 vote, with Mathis loyalists opposing him.
   Immediately upon Hackett's election, McCarthy then won 10-8
votes from the board approving his ouster of Holmes and Lawson,
according to sources in the union who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   Officials at the Teamsters' headquarters here would not comment
on details of the continuing power struggle within the union's
heirarchy.
   But spokesman Duke Zeller said the conference chairmen, unlike
elected board members, serve at the will of the union's president.
   ``He has the right under the union's constitution to select who
serves under him,'' Zeller said of McCarthy. ``This is not unusual;
it's been done, I think, with every change in the presidency.''
   Last week, McCarthy fired Cleveland attorney and Presser
loyalist John R. Climaco as the union's general counsel and
replaced him with James T. Grady.
   Climaco had been in charged of preparing the union's defense to
a civil suit filed by the Justice Department in May to replace its
entire executive board, which the government contends is under the
control of mob figures, with a court-appointed trustee.
   He also was Presser's chief defense lawyer on a criminal
embezzlement and racketeering case that never went to trial because
of the former Teamster president's long illness.
   Meanwhile, Zeller said the union will reopen talks next week in
Washington with the car haulers industry. A new proposed three-year
contract covering some 20,000 Teamsters who work for automobile
transporters was rejected by 3-1 vote last month.
   Zeller said 12-member negotiating committees for the two sides
are scheduled to meet next Thursday for the first time since the
contract's rejection.

<HEAD>Court Upholds FEC Decision to Release Funds to Dukakis-Bentsen
Campaign</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Political Rdp Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court Wednesday upheld the
payment of federal campaign funds to Democrat Michael Dukakis'
presidential campaign even though running mate Lloyd Bentsen is
also seeking re-election to the Senate.
   The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
rejected a challenge to the Federal Election Commission action
releasing $46 million in federal funding due the Dukakis-Bentsen
ticket.
   Bentsen's Senate campaign opponent, Republican Rep. Beau
Boulter, and the National Republican Senatorial Committee, which
helps GOP Senate candidates win election, asked the court to block
the Democrats from spending the money, saying the dual campaign
gave Bentsen an unfair financial advantage.
   The FEC, however, said the Republicans failed to show that there
is anything illegal about Bentsen's decision to run for both the
vice presidency and re-election to his Senate seat, as allowed
under Texas law.
   Because of the dual campaign, Bentsen would be able to spend the
$4 million in private money raised for his Senate contest on top of
the federal money for his vice presidential campaign, which is
limited for both parties.
   Blocking the Democrats from spending their federal money would
``irreparably harm'' their campaign, the FEC said.
   The committee asked the FEC to withhold the $46 million in
federal funding due the Dukakis-Bentsen ticket, but the commission
two weeks ago voted 6-0 to reject that request. The money was then
transferred from the Treasury to the campaign.
   The three-judge panel rejected the Republican group's contention
that the FEC's action was arbitrary and capricious.
   ``We conclude that petitioners' allegations are insufficient on
their face to warrant a revocation of the certification'' of
payment of money to the Dukakis-Bentsen campaign, the court said.
   The brief order was issued by Circuit Judges Spotswood Robinson,
Laurence Silberman and Douglas Ginsburg.

<HEAD>Kennedy Bill Would Expand Elderly Nursing Home Coverage</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal government would pay home and
nursing home costs for elderly people unable to care for for
themselves under legislation introduced Wednesday by Sen. Edward M.
Kennedy.
   Kennedy, D-Mass., said his proposal would cost $20 billion a
year when fully implemented and emphasized that there are a variety
of ways to pay for such a new program with new taxes.
   ``The key condition that we all know must be met is that this
program must be self-financing,'' he said at a hearing of the Labor
and Human Resources Committee he chairs. ``Deficit increases are as
unacceptable as inaction, and I am confident that the American
people and the Congress will find a way to pay for the kind of
program that our senior citizens and their families need and
deserve.''
   The catastrophic health expansion of the Medicare program signed
into law this summer by President Reagan made only marginal
improvements in nursing home care for people recovering from acute
illnesses, and long-term care is widely regarded as the major
health issue of 1989.
   Several other legislators, including Sen. George Mitchell,
D-Maine, and Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., are actively working on
their own versions of long-term care legislation.
   Kennedy enlisted Rep. Claude Pepper, D-Fla., the 87-year-old
dean of the House of Representatives, to help kick off the push for
his bill.
   Pepper had proposed legislation this year to expand home health
care for elderly and disabled people, but it did not make
provisions for expanded nursing home care.
   While the legislation leaves open the method of financing,
Kennedy said he personally favors increasing the current income
ceiling on the Social Security payroll tax for both employees and
employers to raise most of the money for the new program.
   He also mentioned higher inheritance, alcohol and tobacco taxes
as other possibilities.

   A newborn girl who had two fingers
reattached by microsurgery after they were severed during her
delivery by Caesarean section has left the hospital.
   Twelve-day-old Kristen Meckle left North Memorial Medical Center
with her mother, Diane, on Tuesday to fly home to Wildrose, N.D.
They will return to Minneapolis in two weeks to have the cast on
Kristen's left hand removed.
   The infant was rushed by plane to North Memorial from Trinity
Medical Center in Minot, N.D., after a surgeon accidentally severed
most of her index finger, including two joints, and part of the
middle finger, including one joint, with a surgical stapler during
delivery.
   During five hours of surgery, a team working under a surgical
microscope used tiny wires to reconnect the bones, stitched
together seven severed blood vessels, reattached five tendons and
some nerves, and finally sewed the outer skin closed.
   ``The fingers are healing very well and circulation is
excellent,'' said surgeon Martin Adson. So these fingers that are
so important in picking up things ``almost certainly will survive
now,'' he added. But he said only time will tell how much stiffness
might remain.
   ``In general, children do better than adults (with this type of
surgery), so we are hoping a newborn will do even better,'' he said.
   Finger loss or other serious injuries during Caesarean section
delivery are ``extremely rare,'' said Theresa Malone, a spokeswoman
for the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists in
Washington, D.C. However, she said no records are kept on the
number.
   Mrs. Meckle said she harbors no ill feelings for what happened
during the delivery. ``It was just an unfortunate accident,'' she
said.
   She declined to name the doctor involved, but said, ``I'd go
back to him anytime.'' Her insurance is covering the cost of the
medical care, and the Minot hospital is picking up the cost of
travel and other expenses, she said.

<HEAD>Midwest Railroad Bracing for Strike</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Chicago & North Western Transportatio Co.
said it planned to adopt new work rules triggering a rail strike at
midnight Wednesday, but Congress appeared ready to end the walkout
quickly.
   The United Transportation Union said it would strike at 12:01
a.m. Thursday if C&NW cuts the size of most of its train crews from
four to two, a move that would eliminate the jobs of 1,156 brakemen.
   The railroad, which moves freight on 6,400 miles of track in 10
Midwestern states, said the walkout would disrupt at least some of
its freight operations and leave 40,000 Chicago-area commuters
without rail service.
   The Senate adopted a resolution Tuesday calling for a 36-day
extension of a cooling-off period in the rail dispute, but the
House was not expected to consider the resolution until Thursday
morning.
   Mike Bushman, an aide to Rep. Terry Bruce, D-Ill., a sponsor of
the extension, said the House delayed action because of objections
by Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., chairman of the Energy and Commerce
Committee.
   Bushman said Dingell had concerns about whether congressional
action would be constitutional before a strike began.
   ``But as it stands, we don't exect a strike to last long,''
Bushman said. ``Hopefully, they will have legislation passed and
signed by the president in time to have commuter trains rolling for
the afternoon rush hour.''
   Labor and management said they would honor any congressional
order.
   ``If Congress takes action, certainly we would abide by it,''
said Donald Markgraf, the union's general chairman for C&NW
employees, from his office at Wauwatosa, Wis.
   Markgraf said the union will strike on schedule and expects
other unions to honor UTU picket lines.
   ``Until the House takes action, we have to go on the assumption
that we're going to implement our work rules and there will be a
strike,'' spokeswoman Leslie Cleveland said from C&NW headquarters
in Chicago.
   ``We're going to try to run the railroad as efficiently as we
can,'' Ms. Cleveland said. ``Hopefully, it won't hurt traffic,
especially if it's a very short-lived strike.''
   ``If Congress were to act tomorrow, it would only last a day,''
she said. ``But you can't really say what will happen, so we just
have to go ahead with our plans.''
   In April, President Reagan issued an executive order barring
either side from taking action until 30 days after a presidential
emergency board submitted recommendations for a settlement.
   The cooling-off period expires at 12:01 a.m. Thursday, but the
Senate voted Tuesday to extend it until Sept. 9 to give the company
and the union more time to reach an agreement.
   The presidential board recommended last month that C&NW cut one
brakeman per train and that elimination of the second should be
decided through binding arbitration on a train-by-train basis.
   C&NW initially rejected the proposal but offered Monday to
accept it.
   ``We felt Congress would probably implement (the proposal)
anyway, and this would avoid a strike,'' Ms. Cleveland said. ``But
the union doesn't want to accept this _ doesn't want to go halfway
_ so we're prepared for the strike.''
   She said the company would implement its original layoff plans,
rather than follow the compromise proposed by the emergency board.
   James Foote, a spokesman for the railroad's parent company, CNW
Corp., said the railroad's commuter trains would not run Thursday
in the event of a strike.
   But he said management personel would be used to operate enough
freight trains to generate 80 percent of the company's usual
freight-hauling revenues on the first day of a strike.

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal government said Wednesday it has
reached a $33.1 million settlement with 48 companies over illegally
dumped waste at four New England sites. The agreement includes the
largest cost recovery ever won under the Superfund law.
   The settlement, the culmination of a nine-year joint state and
federal investigation, was disclosed in a civil complaint filed
Wednesday by the Environmental Protection Agency seeking damages
from 25 other companies that did not cooperate with authorities.
   ``We're sending a message that says if you illegally dispose of
illegal waste, you're going to get found, you're going to get
caught and you'll have to pay for it,'' said Daniel S. Greenbaum,
commissioner of the state Department of Environmental Quality
Engineering.
   The settlement is described technically as a ``proposal''
because federal law requires a 30-day public comment period, though
the parties involved have already agreed to the conditions.
   The settlement involves major companies who were customers of
Cannons Engineering Corp., and the cleanup of Cannon hazardous
waste sites in Bridgewater and Plymouth, Mass., and Nashua and
Londonderry, N.H. It includes the recovery of $17 million in
cleanup costs spent by the government at the sites, the largest
recovery amount in Superfund history.
   Although Cannons conducted the illegal dumping without notifying
its customers, officials said, Superfund law holds that all parties
connected with illegal dumping of hazardous waste are liable for
cleanup costs.
   Cannons, which has gone out of business, is one of the companies
that has refused to settle with federal officials and is named in
the U.S. district court complaint.
   The settling parties also agreed to finish cleaning up three of
the four sites, work estimated to cost $16.1 million.
   The EPA previously reached $14.6 million in settlements with
companies responsible for smaller amounts of waste dumping at the
sites.
   ``This should slam dunk them (illegal dumpers) to the fullest
extent of the law,'' said EPA regional administrator Michael
Deland. ``We're saying we can't tolerate this anymore.''
   In Washington, D.C., Assistant Attorney General Roger J.
Marzulla of the Justice Department's Land and Natural Resources
Division said the ``four sites involved some of the most urgent
hazardous waste problems in New England and the government took
decisive action.''
   The illegal dumping stemmed from problems that began shortly
after Cannons bought property in Bridgewater in 1974 to handle,
store and incinerate chemical waste.
   A few years later, Cannons began taking in more waste than it
could handle in Bridgewater and began illegally shipping the
overflow to the three other sites, in Plymouth and New Hampshire.
However, Cannons officials reported to authorities that the excess
waste was actually being incinerated at Bridgewater.
   According to EPA spokesman Michael Thomas, the surplus waste was
moved stealthily out of the Bridgewater site after dark and taken
to Nashua, where it was dumped in the ground near a stream.
Officials first discovered the problem in 1979 when groundwater
contamination became so severe that emissions were noticeable in
the air rising from the stream.
   The dumping of waste in Londonderry was discovered when
residents notified environmental authorities of a peculiar
``frothing'' at a stream. Residential drinking water supplies were
threatened and had to be replaced at both sites.
   The waste in Plymouth was contained in storage tanks that began
leaking, Thomas said.
   In 1980, state officials revoked Cannons' hazardous waste
license because of alleged reporting and hazardous waste
violations. Five people associated with Cannons, including J. Scott
Cannon, one of the owners, served brief terms in state prison,
Thomas said.
   Among the companies included in the settlement announced
Wednesday were Globe Newspaper Co., Polaroid Corp., Monsanto Co.,
Clean Harbors of Braintree and Natick, Atlantic Richfield Co. and
the General Electric Co.
   EPA officials said they have spent $30 million so far in initial
cleanup of the sites and described them all as ``stabilized.'' The
money recovered by the EPA will cover those costs and go toward
finishing the cleanup.

<HEAD>Foreign Minister Criticizes Pakistani Conduct on Afghanistan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Kremlin accused Pakistan of ``international
terrorism'' in Afghanistan and made a veiled threat Wednesday of
Soviet response.
   Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze made the comments to
Pakistan's foreign minister, Sahabzada Yaqub Khan, who arrived
Tuesday on a visit that centers on the Afghan situation, the
official news agency Tass reported.
   Soviet officials accuse Pakistan of violating provisions of a
U.N.-mediated agreement that commits the Red Army to withdraw from
Afghanistan by next Feb. 15. It also contains a pledge by Pakistan
and Afghanistan not to interfere in each other's internal affairs.
   Moslem guerrillas began fighting in Afghanistan after a
communist coup in April 1978 and Soviet soldiers entered the
country in December 1979.
   An estimated 115,000 Soviet troops were in Afghanistan when the
withdrawal agreement was signed April 14 in Geneva and about 35,000
are said to have been withdrawn. Under the terms, half of the force
is to be out by Aug. 15.
   Pakistan, Afghanistan's eastern neighbor, is involved because at
least 3 million Afghan refugees live in cities and camps just
inside its territory that serve as bases and supply points for
guerrillas.
   Shevardnadze told Yaqub the Pakistanis had grossly and openly
violated the agreement, Tass said. He cited ``unceasing massive
dispatches'' of arms to Afghan guerrillas through Pakistani
territory and the existence of a rival Afghan government on
Pakistani soil.
   The Soviet foreign minister accused Pakistan of hampering ``in
every way'' the return to Afghanistan of refugees living in
Pakistan and said rebels had increased attacks on Afghan towns,
killing or wounding hundreds of civilians in the past two months.
   ``Islamabad's support for such actions cannot be described other
than as international terrorism,'' he told Yaqub. ``We would wish
that they in Islamabad become clearly aware that this cannot go on
indefinitely.''
   If the alleged violations continue, ``the Soviet Union and the
republic of Afghanistan will find with what to counter the growing
interference in the internal affairs of the republic of
Afghanistan,'' Shevardnadze said.
   He did say what action might be taken. Tass did not say if Yaqub
had any reply.
   The head of the Soviet Army contingent said in a published
interview Pakistani violations might force the Red Army to
reconsider the withdrawal timetable.

   Fire crews in Yellowstone National Park relied on a man-made
shower Wednesday to protect a major power line while natural
showers helped crews gain the upper hand on several other wildfires
in the Northwest.
   A brush fire raged within a few miles of the Idaho state Capitol
in Boise but crews using air tankers and helicopters hoped to have
the fire contained by the evening.
   Firefighters contained a 3,100-acre blaze in Montana and fought
smaller fires in Oregon and Colorado.
   Water lines run from Yellowstone Lake to the area around the
village of West Thumb fed a sprinkler system that doused a mile of
the power line, according to fire information officer Larry Blade.
Crews began the watering Tuesday to keep flames from the
17,360-acre Shoshone fire from scorching the cable.
   Crews continued to scoop buckets of water out of Yellowstone's
Lewis Lake for helicopter drops on the 18,700-acre fire dubbed
North Fork. Fire managers are concentrating on the fire's eastern
edge to prevent it from threatening the area around Old Faithful
geyser.
   Firefighters also made aerial water drops on another fire in the
park, a 16,600-acre blaze dubbed the Fan Fire. And managers began
releasing crews from the 75,000-acre Clover Mist fire Tuesday and
turned the blaze back over to the National Park Service for
monitoring, Blade said.
   Elsewhere in Wyoming, temperatures in the 60s and light rain
helped crews fight a 1,800-acre fire in the Bighorn National Forest.
   ``The rain's not putting out the fire, but it's helping the
firefighters achieve containment,'' fire information officer Dave
Damron said. Officials expected to have the fire contained by
Thursday evening and controlled by Friday evening.
   The rain also was expected to help crews contain a 1,300-acre
blaze and a 70-acre fire elsewhere in the Bighorn forest by
Wednesday evening, Damron said.
   In Idaho, a fire burned more than 2,200 acres of tinder-dry
cheatgrass and brush only a few miles from the Capitol in Boise
before 120 firefighters, air tankers and helicopters reined it in
about midday. No structures were damaged.
   Fire bosses hoped to contain the blaze by evening. The cause of
the fire was still being investigated.
   Rain slowed the advance of a 1,300-acre fire near the Wyoming
border. About 500 firefighters worked against the lightning-caused
blaze, but the moisture prevented crews from conducting a
controlled burn of areas between established fire lines and the
fire.
   ``The fire has laid down,'' said Targhee National Forest
spokesman John Mincks. ``The rain was a mixed blessing, though. ...
It's really steep ground, and the crews are having some real
problems because it is slippery.''
   Six firefighters suffered minor injuries.
   In Montana, a 3,100-acre fire in the Bitterroot National Forest
along the Idaho border was contained Wednesday morning and expected
to be under control by late evening, fire information officer Peggy
O'Connell said. U.S. Forest Service officials hope to begin
reopening parts of the forest by the weekend, she said.
   The firefighting effort cost $2.1 million and resulted in minor
injuries to 19 people, she said. Zachary Elwell, 26, of Alvarado,
Texas, was charged Monday with failing to extinguish a campfire and
causing the blaze.
   Two other fires totaling about 36,500 acres in Montana's Bob
Marshall Wilderness complex showed little activity in the cool,
cloudy weather. They were being allowed to burn unchecked because
they were in wilderness preserves.
   In Oregon, winds and recently harvested timber spread a day-old
fire over more than 600 acres of rugged terrain owned by
Weyerhaeuser Co. about 26 miles southeast of Coos Bay, according to
Doug Decker, spokesman for the state Forestry Department. The cause
of the fire was under investigation.
   Over 400 firefighters fought the blaze with the help of four
water-carrying helicopters and two airplanes that dropped fire
retardant.
   A field fire charred 400 acres and damaged one house and two
fire trucks about 85 miles south of Portland before it was
controlled Tuesday night.
   Eighty firefighters battled a lightning-caused fire that covered
300 acres of brush, grass and short timber near Fort Collins in
northern Colorado.

   The world's Anglican bishops on
Wednesday passed a resolution calling for South Africa's withdrawal
from South-West Africa.
   Also Wednesday, a report to the bishops urged Christians to
develop closer links with Jews to prevent another Nazi holocaust.
   The resolution on South Africa, adopted at the bishops'
conference in Lambeth, came a day after South Africa proposed an
Aug. 10 cease-fire in the Angolan war. The truce would lead to
withdrawal of foreign troops and independence for South
African-administered South-West Africa, also known as Namibia.
   The bishops' resolution was proposed by the Bishop of Stepney,
Jim Thompson, in the name of the 70 million members of the Anglican
Church.
   The archbishop of Canterbury, Dr. Robert Runcie, is to send the
message of support to the Geneva peace talks.
   Thompson claimed South African troops in Namibia were fighting
close to schools, involving children in the crossfire.
   ``Young people have been kidnapped or seduced into joining
armies. Attacks on the church have brought a severe crisis,'' he
said.
   Bishop David Russell, of Grahamstown in South Africa, seconded
the resolution and called on the conference to urge Western
governments to monitor peace in Namibia.
   The report calling for improved Judeo-Christian relations
stemmed from a proposal by Bishop of Oxford Richard Harries to
broaden dialogue among the Anglican community, Jews and Moslems.
   The proposal said the three religions have much in common and
should work together to promote human rights and prevent prejudice
leading to tragedies like the World War II holocaust, when six
million Jews were killed.
   ``In order to combat centuries of anti-Jewish teaching,
Christians must develop programs of teaching, preaching and common
social action which eradicate prejudice,'' the report said.
   The holocaust had seeds in centuries of ``anti-Jewish prejudice
promulgated by leaders, church and state ... in which the evil weed
of Nazism was able to take root,'' the report said.

<HEAD>House OKs Two-Year Extention of Homeless Aid</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House on Wednesday overwhelmingly approved
legislation to extend federal aid for the homeless for two years.
   The bill, passed 333-80, authorizes $642.5 million for the 1989
fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1, and ``such sums as may be
necessary'' for fiscal 1990.
   The measure reauthorizes the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless
Assistance Act, enacted last year, for emergency shelter and food,
health care, education and job training. The law is named for a
late Republican congressman from Connecticut.
   House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, said before the vote: ``The
homeless initiatives passed by Congress last year are working. But
far more needs to be done.
   ``While many homeless citizens are being helped, the total
homeless population continues to increase at an annual rate of 20
percent in major urban areas,'' he said. ``Two out of three cities
have to deny services to homeless applicants because of a lack of
public resources.''
   Wright said homelessness, unlike other afflictions, can be cured.
   ``We have located the cause of this condition in the large cuts
that were made in low-income housing and mental health services,''
he said. ``And we have found the remedy in the programs for
affordable housing, health care and edcuation programs contained in
homeless assistance acts.''
   The House approved the measure after defeating, 215-203, an
amendment introduced by Reps. Marge Roukema, R-N.J., and Thomas J.
Ridge, R-Pa., that would have combined all the funds for housing
and shelter programs into a single block grant, effective in the
second year of the authorization.
   Similar legislation is pending in the Senate.

<HEAD>Tape Shows Naked Sergeant Cavorting in Grand Central</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARJORIE ANDERS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Seven railroad police officers were suspended
Wednesday after railroad brass saw a 5-year-old videotape that
showed a sergeant cavorting around Grand Central Terminal wearing
only a hat, holster and shoes.
   The naked officer, Sgt. Richard DeClara, 46, is shown harassing
the homeless and making a derogatory comment to a black man,
according to a former captain who described the tape. In one scene,
he lisps to imitate the stereotype of a homosexual.
   Besides DeClara, a 21-year veteran of the railroad force, one
lieutenant, three sergeants and two officers were involved.
   The tape was made on the overnight shift on St. Patrick's Day
1983 during a strike by railroad workers that did not involve
police, according to Peter Stangl, president of the Metro-North
Commuter Railroad, which carries commuters between New York and its
northern suburbs. The strike and the lateness of the hour left the
landmark Grand Central all but deserted.
   ``I don't think these guys are fit to be cops, and we don't want
them on the property,'' Stangl said at a news conference Wednesday.
   The videotape was brought to his attention Monday afternoon and
he viewed it Tuesday, Stangl said. He said the tape had been in a
railroad police safe since the end of 1985, unknown to him.
   Although the railroad did not release the tape, Dean Evans, a
former captain in the department until he resigned in April,
described it for The Associated Press. Later, excerpts were shown
on WCBS-TV.
   It shows DeClara in various situations and five other officers
watching and laughing in the background, he said. The seventh
officer allegedly made the videotape.
   DeClara, who has an unlisted telephone number, told WCBS-TV:
``It was just a comedy-type tape. That's all it really was. Just
exactly for laughs.''
   On the tape, DeClara walks around the lower level of the
terminal wearing only his hat, shoes and holster, making security
rounds, checking that doors are locked and performing other duties.
   At one point, he is shown harassing a homeless, black man. The
officer asks him, ``When did you notice that you were turning
black?'' and makes taunting references to such black stereotypes as
tap dancing and eating watermelon.
   In another scene, DeClara is in a coffee shop lisping and
putting his arm around a man sitting at the counter with a woman.
The woman is laughing, as are other officers in the background.
   The officers were suspended pending a dismissal hearing,
according to Patricia Raley, a Metro-North spokeswoman.
   Stangl said he also has sent of copy of the videotape to the New
York State police commissioner, asking him to revoke the
commissions of the officers involved.

<HEAD>Forecasters Call Hurricane Potential Threat to Hawaii</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HONOLULU (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hurricane Fabio, packing 155 mph wind gusts, was
labeled a potential threat to Hawaii Wednesday but forecasters said
it was too soon to tell whether the storm would reach the island
chain.
   At 8 a.m. Wednesday (2 p.m. EDT), the storm was 900 miles
east-southeast of Honolulu, moving west at 15 mph, said Clarence
Lee, a National Weather Service forecaster in Honolulu.
   ``Hurricane Fabio continues to be a very potent and dangerous
hurricane and is considered to be a potential threat to the
Hawaiian Islands,'' Lee said.
   Fabio's maximum sustained winds were estimated near 125 mph with
hurricane force winds of at least 74 mph extending out 75 miles
from the center. Tropical storm strength winds _ 39 mph to 73 mph _
extended out 180 miles from the center.
   ``This is one of the strongest hurricanes in the area in quite a
while,'' said Hans Rosendal, a weather service meteorogist.
   The storm was expected to continue on its current course for the
next 24 hours with little change in strength, Lee said.
   The last major storm to hit Hawaii was Hurricane Iwa, which
brushed the island of Oahu and roared over Kauai and Niihau islands
with winds up to 117 mph in November 1982, causing $234 million
damage.
   If Fabio stays on course, Lee said, the National Weather Service
would consider issuing hurricane watches or warnings later
Wednesday.
   The center of the storm would pass 50 miles south of Hawaii, the
southernmost island in the chain, on Friday if the storm maintains
its heading and speed, Rosendal said.
   Officials expect to have an updated satellite reading of the
hurricane's position around 4 p.m. Wednesday (10 p.m. EDT).
   While the storm was still hundreds of miles away, the islands
were expected to begin feeling its effects. Surf as high as 15 feet
was expected on the southeast shore of Hawaii Island and
larger-than-normal waves were forecast for all Hawaiian islands.

<HEAD>Iran-Contra Prosecutor Asks Ruling On Classified Documents
Disclosure</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The prosecutor in the Iran-Contra case asked
the judge Wednesday to order Oliver L. North to get more specific
about what government secrets he wants to disclose at his trial or
bar the ex-White House aide from revealing any classified
information.
   Independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh said the 265-page notice
that North had filed Monday under the Classified Information
Procedures Act flouted both the law and an order issued earlier by
U.S. District Court Judge Gerhard A. Gesell.
   ``This telephone book-size submission is merely the latest move
in the defendants' struggle to have this trial postponed and to
subvert the procedures of this court,'' Walsh said in a brief filed
in U.S. District Court.
   Walsh said the notice ``merely recites an inventory ... of
virtually all of the hundreds of thousands of classified documents
the defendant has received in discovery.''
   Walsh contended that the classified information statute requires
a specific notice of the exact nature of top secret information the
defendant intends to introduce at trial.
   The law was enacted by Congress to prevent defendants in
criminal cases from scuttling the prosecution by threatening to
disclose unspecified government secrets at trial.
   Walsh said the vague nature of North's filing was tantamount to
the so-called ``gray-mail'' that the law was intended to prevent.
   ``North has failed to describe even one piece of classified
information that he expects to disclose in trial,'' Walsh said.
``The index reveals no more than an obvious fact that the court and
the government already knew: many of the documents produced in
discovery contain classified information.''
   North, a former National Security Council aide, is charged with
conspiring with former national security advisor John M.
Poindexter, and arms dealer Albert Hakim and retired Air Force Maj.
Gen. Richard V. Secord to illegally divert U.S.-Iran arms sales
profits to the Nicaraguan rebels.
   Gesell has already ruled that North should be allowed to examine
vast quantities of classified documents to try to show he was
acting with permission of higher officials in the Reagan
administration.
   The problems posed by the classified documents prompted Walsh on
Tuesday to suggest holding two trials for North. The prosecutor
suggested deferring action on the central conspiracy charges while
efforts are made to devise procedures for disclosing classified
information in court.
   Walsh suggested that Gesell proceed to try North on 13 other
charges of making false statements to Congress, obstructing justice
and illegally enriching himself.
   The North trial is set to begin Sept. 20 but Gesell is
considering a defense motion to postpone it until after the
presidential election campaign.
   Separate trials have already been ordered for his co-defendants.

<HEAD>Iran Asks U.S. Apology in Light of Findings on Airliner Downing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VICTORIA GRAHAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iran's delegation to U.N. peace talks said
Wednesday that the reported findings of human error in the downing
of an Iranian airliner prove Iran's contentions and called again
for a U.S. apology and reparations.
   ``This report has proved what we have said until now ... and so
we believe the United States has full responsibility in this
connection,'' Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati told
reporters in answer to a question.
   Also on Wednesday, Velayati lodged a formal protest with the
Security Council over Iraq's latest alleged use of chemical warfare
and said the council should impose sanctions against the Baghdad
government.
   Velayati met Security Council President Li Luye of China for
more than an hour on the issue.
   Reporters asked Velayati about reports that U.N. peace talks
with Iran and Iraq were deadlocked.
   ``No comment,'' he said, but added that Secretary-General Javier
Perez de Cuellar has not said a stalemate existed in efforts to end
the 8-year-old war.
   Iraq demands immediate, face-to-face talks with Iran before a
truce. Iran is resisting and the U.N. chief is seeking a compromise.
   The U.S. envoy to the United Nations, Ambassador Vernon A.
Walters, told a news conference Wednesday that Perez de Cuellar was
concentrating on obtaining Iraq's agreement before declaring a
cease-fire.
   Iraq says it won't stop shooting if the secretary-general
declares a truce without its consent.
   In the airliner disaster, the United States says the warship
Vincennes shot down an Iranian Airbus on July 3, killing all 290
people aboard, because the crew mistakenly believed it to be a
hostile Iranian F-14 warplane.
   But a Navy investigation, as reported by ABC and the New York
Times, found that the crew misinterpreted correct data from the
ship's sophisticated detection system and believed they were about
to be attacked.
   Iranian Ambassador Mohammad Ja'afar Mahallati would not say
Wednesday if he thought the airliner's destruction was
premeditated, as Iran charged earlier.
   ``Those people reponsible for reading instruments should have
had sufficient training. Otherwise we wonder why they were put
before that Aegis (system of radar and identification),'' he said.
   ``The findings ... once again prove that what we said from the
very beginning was actually what happened,'' said Mohammad Javad
Zarif, counselor at the Iranian Mission and delegation spokesman.
   He said the reported findings prove ``there could be no mistake
with regard to the nature of the plane, the fact that it was
ascending, rather than descending, that it was flying at a
prescribed altitude within (assigned) corridors.''
   ``All claims have come true and now it is time for the United
States to act responsibly,'' he said.
   Zarif, speaking by telephone, said the United States should pay
reparations and issue ``a clear apology for the murder of 290
innocent people.''
   He said the United States also should remove the source of
tension, referring to the presence of U.S. warships in the Persian
Gulf.
   The United States already has expressed deep regret and said it
was willing to pay compensation to victims' families, but not to
the Tehran government. It said Iran must share responsibility
because it let a civilian airliner fly in a war zone.
   Velayati told reporters outside U.N. headquarters Wednesday that
he requested that a U.N. expert team investigate the alleged
chemical attack by Iraq in which 1,000 people were hurt with the
outlawed weapons in northern Ajerbaijan.
   On Monday a report by a U.N. expert team concluded that Iraq has
made repeated and extensive use of chemical warfare in violation of
international law.
   It also found that nine Iraqi soldiers were poisoned recently by
chemical weapons, but left open the question of whether Iran was to
blame.

   A state representative who stopped by a
supporter's house while campaigning door to door made a grisly
discovery: The elderly man had been dead for weeks.
   State Rep. John J. Binienda said he saw swarms of black flies
inside the windows of the closed house of Guido G. Dizacomo. ``It
scared me, and I gasped and smelled a terrible odor,'' he said. He
summoned authorities who found the badly decomposed body.
   Dizacomo, 76, apparently had died of a heart attack a couple of
weeks earlier, officials said.
   Binienda said Dizacomo, whom he described as somewhat of a
recluse, had allowed him to post signs on his lawn across the
street from a polling station in 1984 and 1986, so he stopped by
Tuesday.
   The discovery of the man's body ``put a damper on my day,''
Binienda said Wednesday. ``Everything had been going so nicely. I
had knocked on 40 doors before I got to his.''
   ``One thing you can say about door-to-door campaigning: You
never know what you'll discover,'' the politician said.

<HEAD>Judge Orders Solons To Talk in Koreagate Suit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four congressmen who collected speechmaking
fees from a rice broker linked to the Koreagate scandal are not too
busy now to testify in a civil suit against the businessman, a
judge ruled Wednesday.
   U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth rejected arguments that
Majority Whip Tony Coelho, D-Calif., Reps. Bill Alexander, D-Ark.
and Vic Fazio, Calif. and Sen. John Breaux, D-La. couldn't take
time out of their busy schedules to be questioned in pre-trial
depositions in an antitrust suit against Connell Rice and Sugar Co.
and its president, Grover Connell.
   Lamberth sided with lawyers for California rice growers suing
Connell Rice and two California rice mill cooperatives. The lawyers
cited thousands of dollars that the four Democrats made in
honoraria for giving seminars at the company's headquarters in
Westfield, N.J. in the early 1980s.
   ``They were not so busy in their legislative duties that they
were not able to take these trips,'' Lamberth said at the
conclusion of a hearing on the issue.
   Steven Ross, counsel to the House clerk, argued that lengthy
depositions would take the four lawmakers away from important
legislative business. Ross suggested that the plaintiffs could
submit questions in writing to the congressmen rather than tie the
lawmakers up in the depositions.
   ``Requiring these members to attend depositions for several
hours or a better part of a day or more is very intrusive into
their official functions,'' Ross said.
   But Lamberth ruled that an oral deposition, rather than the
submission of written interrogatories, would be a more useful way
to question the lawmakers. The plaintiffs agreed to limit the
depositions to four hours for each congressman.
   Among other things, the plaintiffs want to question Breaux about
his relationship with Tongsun Park, a South Korean rice dealer who
was the central figure of the Koreagate bribery scandal of the late
1970s.
   Howard Langer, the plaintiffs' attorney, said he wants to
question Breaux and other lawmakers about efforts they made to
persuade the South Korean government to purchase more U.S. rice and
to buy it from Connell Rice.
   The judge expressed agreement with Langer's prediction that the
congressmen would be hostile witnesses.
   Although there is no allegation the four acted improperly,
Langer said the questioning is needed to develop evidence ``these
congressmen were utilized in the overall scheme to influence the
Korean government to purchase (rice) at certain prices.''
   The lawsuit contends that Connell Rice conspired with the two
cooperatives, the Rice Growers Association of California, and the
Farmers Rice Cooperative, to drive competitors out of business by
lowering the price of rice.
   Connell was indicted _ but never convicted _ in the Koreagate
scandal on wire fraud, racketeering and conspiracy charges. He was
also charged with concealing from the government that Park was a
Korean government agent and not a legitimate rice dealer. All the
charges against Connell were subsequently dismissed.
   The civil suit contends bribes that Connell Rice paid to Park
were part of the antitrust scheme.
   Langer presented evidence in court papers that the congressmen
received honoraria and campaign contributions from Connell Rice.
   Alexander received $7,000 for attending four company seminars
between 1981 and 1985. Breaux, then a House member, was also paid
$7,000 plus expenses for making four trips to the seminars during
the same period. Coelho was paid $3,000 for two trips and Fazio
received $5,000 for three trips, according to court papers.
   Park, who said he distributed $850,000 worth of bribes, was
given immunity from prosecution for his cooperation in the
investigation, which resulted in the conviction of one congressman.

<HEAD>Safety Officials Had Thought Bus Riders Would Have Time to Escape</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TED M. NATT JR.</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Before the bus accident that left 27
people dead of smoke inhalation, federal safety officials were
confident that riders would have enough time to escape a burning
bus before it was engulfed by flames, a top official testified
Wednesday.
   ``Up until May 14 of this year, we were patting ourselves on the
back for the good job we had done,'' said Ralph Hitchcock, director
of the office of vehicle safety standards for the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration. ``Now we're reviewing all of our
standards for bus safety.''
   Twenty-seven people died that night when a school bus owned by
the First Assembly of God church in Radcliff burst into flames upon
impact with a pickup truck on Interstate 71 near Carrollton. All
survived the crash but couldn't escape the smoke.
   The pickup truck driver, Larry Mahoney, 35, of Worthville, has
pleaded innocent to 27 counts of murder as well as other charges,
including drunken driving.
   ``We believed that there were sufficient exits to allow the
people to get out in a reasonable amount of time and, up until this
crash, I don't think we've had any indication that that was not
so,'' Hitchcock said.
   Hitchcock's testimony came on the second day of National
Transportation Safety Board hearings on the fatal crash. In other
testimony, a consultant for Ford Motor Co., which built the bus'
chassis, said a cage around the bus' fuel tank may not have
prevented the fire.
   Hitchcock said results of bus interior-flammability tests had
indicated passengers on a school bus would have enough time to get
out of a bus before it burned.
   ``We had never had an occurrence where anyone was unable to get
out on a timely basis because of flammability problems,'' he said.
``There were some close calls, but they were able to get off.''
   Hitchcock testified that it usually takes 1{ minutes to evacuate
a bus and four to five minutes for a bus to become engulfed in
flames. However, in the Carrollton accident, flames blocked the
front door, leaving a rear emergency exit as the only door.
   ``We're talking about millions-to-one probability that all of
the factors are going to add up here to cause a problem,'' he said.
``We don't design our requirements to prevent one-of-a-kind
accidents.''
   John Habberstad, a consulting engineer specializing in accident
reconstruction, testified that a cage around the fuel tank may not
have stopped the fire. The bus was built shortly before new
regulations requiring such a cage went into effect.
   The tank was punctured by a piece of the bus' spring assembly
that broke off shortly after impact, he said.
   ``It wasn't until some 50 feet down the road (from impact) that
a free-flying projectile (the spring assembly) penetrated the
tank,'' Habberstad said. ``The tank guard is not designed to
prevent penetration by an object such as this. It's meant to
protect intrusion from something like the pickup.''
   The NTSB's hearings end Thursday. The board will report on the
crash's probable causes and recommend how to avoid similar
accidents, but it has no power to require implementation.

   George Bush said Wednesday that he will
keep Republican National Committee Chairman Frank Fahrenkopf on as
party chairman, even though his campaign is moving toward greater
control of the party structure for the general election.
   The vice president, however, said his convention manager, Fred
V. Malek, would have an expanded role in the committee and would be
designated deputy RNC chairman.
   ``I think they'll function as a very good team,'' Bush said
after touring a Westinghouse plant that manufactures and tests
underwater electronic systems for the Defense Department.
   Bush indicated that he had spurned Fahrenkopf's offer to resign
because of the change at the top. At the same time, he said, ``I
think Malek going up there will maximize coordination between the
campaign and the important functions of the RNC.''
   Meanwhile, Lee Atwater, Bush's campaign manager, denied that a
``palace revolt'' was under way in the party. ``There's total
confidence in Frank Fahrenkopf. He offered to resign. The vice
president didn't want him to,'' Atwater told a news conference in
Washington.
   Malek, a top executive of the Marriott Corp., has been serving
as Bush's convention manager since last March. He was a former
White House aide in the Nixon administration and developed a
controversial plan known as the ``responsiveness program'' to
marshal federal resources and personnel to help re-elect Nixon.
   Malek, who appeared with Atwater at the news conference,
described his role at the RNC as being one of a partnership with
Fahrenkopf _ who has been the party chairman since 1983 _ rather
than an adversarial one.
   ``I think you have a situation where one plus one can equal
three. That's the point of this whole thing,'' Malek said.
   Atwater, meanwhile, said that Bush planned to arrive in New
Orleans for the Republican National Convention on Aug. 16 _ the
second day of the event _ and after President Reagan, who speaks on
the first night, leaves.
   He said he saw nothing unusual in the fact that Reagan and Bush
would not be together during the convention that will formally
install Reagan's 1980 and 1984 running mate as the GOP nominee.
   ``I've been to the last two conventions with Ronald Reagan, and
he never stays at conventions long,'' Atwater said.
   Bush toured an assembly room at the Westinghouse Oceanics
Division plant where sonar equipment for mine-detectors is
developed. He also ate lunch with workers in the plant cafeteria
where he used the occasion to praise President Reagan's veto
earlier in the day of a defense-authorization bill.
   ``That is good national security policy,'' Bush said. ``If we
start cutting our advanced technological edge, as that bill did, it
would not be good for our national security and not good for the
strength of the (NATO) alliance.''
   Bush sidestepped questions on the health of Democratic
presidential nominee Michael Dukakis as well as Reagan's reference
to Dukakis as ``an invalid.'' The president later said, ``I was
trying to be funny and it didn't work.''
   Bush said he was ``not going to be drawn into this
mini-controversy,'' a remark that drew applause from Westinghouse
employees in the cafeteria.
   ``If somebody has a question, I will try to answer it frankly. I
do find some of the inquiries intrusive. But I will be glad to
respond to questions as it relates to my health ...,'' he said.
   Later, at a White House meeting with a women's group, Bush said
he would release his medical records. ``I believe I responded in
1980 about my medical background and I'm prepared to do it again,''
he said.
   On another subject, Bush put some distance between himself and
Reagan on recommendations from a presidential commission on AIDS,
indicating support for the centerpiece of the commission's report _
legislation banning discrimination against victims of the disease.
   ``Basically, I support the objectives of the commission,'' Bush
said. ``We have a national health problem. People are scared. We
need education, we need testing, we need research, we need all of
these things. And I don't want to see some child, who is an
innocent victim of this outrageous horrible disease, be
discriminated against. I just don't want to see that.''
   Reagan on Wednesday told federal agencies to adopt guidelines
preventing such discrimination, but stopped short of advocating
stronger measures.
   Later, in a statement issued by the White House, Bush said he
endorses proposals to speed the availability of new drugs for AIDS
and other life-threatening diseases.
   Bush said the Food and Drug Administration, when considering
whether to license new drugs for serious diseases, should give
greater weight to the risks the illnesses pose to life.
   Bush, who heads a presidential task force on regulatory relief,
also announced that the FDA is relaxing control over an
experimental drug _ pentostatin _ used to treat leukemia that does
not respond to other drugs or surgery.
   FDA spokeswoman Faye Petersen said pentostatin is the sixth drug
to qualify for what is known as ``treatment IND'' status since the
new category _ just short of full-market approval _ was established
about a year ago.
   She said pentostatin distribution will be handled through the
National Cancer Institute and that officials estimate 60 to 100
people nationwide might benefit from the new treatment.

   President Reagan called Michael Dukakis ``an invalid''
Wednesday, then said he'd just been trying to be funny but failed.
The Democratic presidential nominee later released a summary of his
medical history and said, ``I'm a very healthy guy.''
   As the delicate subject of candidate health _ and in particular
mental health _ arose in Washington, George Bush, on a short
campaign trip, stressed his support for ``Star Wars,'' the proposed
space-based missile defense system. Dukakis termed the program a
``fantasy'' and repeated his longstanding opposition.
   Bush said he wanted no part of ``this mini-controversy''
surrounding the health of his opponent for the White House. The
vice president, who will formally win the Republican presidential
nomination at this month's party convention, said he released
``relevant records'' of his own medical past in 1980 and would do
so this year.
   Dukakis, a devotee of power-walking _ fast-paced walking while
holding weights in each hand _ said ``no apology was needed'' for
Reagan's comment, and the president didn't offer one.
   ``I was just trying to be funny and it didn't work,'' he told
reporters.
   Democratic vice presidential candidate Lloyd Bentsen said the
president's remark was ``outrageous and laughable'' at the same
time.
   
   
   
   
   
   Kitty Dukakis, the candidate's wife, said during a visit to New
Jersey that such remarks come when ``people are desperate and
afraid of dealing with the real issues.''
   ``There is no truth to any of those rumors,'' Mrs. Dukakis told
reporters. ``My husband has never seen a psychiatrist.''
   
   
   Bush, campaigning in Annapolis, Md., said Reagan's veto of the
$299.5 billion defense bill was ``good national security policy.
We've got to keep this country strong. And if we start cutting our
advanced technological edge, as that bill did, it would not be good
for our national security and not good for the strength of the
alliance.''
   Dukakis, working in Boston, urged Congress to override the veto.
``This is a bipartisan defense authorization bill ... a bill which
will strengthen our national security,'' he said.
   Bush toured a defense installation in Annapolis and paused long
enough to field questions on a variety of subjects. He said he
would dispatch Fred Malek to the Republican National Committee as
deputy chairman. The vice president said that despite the move, ``I
have a lot of confidence'' in the current Republican chairman,
Frank Fahrenkopf.
   Bush shed little light on his search for a vice presidential
running mate, telling reporters he hoped to make his decision
before going to New Orleans on Aug. 16. His aides have said they
expect no public announcement until Thursday, Aug. 18, the final
day of the convention.
   In a related political matter, Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas said he
would make the nominating speech for Bush in New Orleans.
   Publicly, Dukakis and his aides responded mildly to the
emergence of the questions about his health, and particularly his
mental health.
   ``We all occasionally misspeak and I don't think the president
needed to apologize,'' said Dukakis. He responded ``no'' when asked
whether he had ever suffered from depression or consulted a
psychiatrist.
   Rumors concerning Dukakis' mental health have swirled just below
the surface of the campaign in recent days, and they cropped up at
the White House when Reagan was asked a question by a reporter
representing a publication backed by political extremist Lyndon
LaRouche.
   Reagan was asked whether he thought Dukakis should make his
records public and he replied, ``Look, I'm not going to pick on an
invalid.''
   ``An invalid in what sense,'' he was asked.
   ``I can't take any further questions,'' the president said.
   But a short time later, he returned to the subject in another
brief encounter with reporters.
   ``I attempted a joke in response to a question and _ I think I
was kidding, but I don't think I should have said what I did,''
Reagan said. Still he said the public does have a right to know the
medical history of a president.
   Late Wednesday, Dukakis' physician, Dr. Gerald R. Plotkin,
released a statement saying the candidate is in good health and
``has had no psychological symptoms, complaints or treatment.''
   Plotkin said at a news conference that Dukakis, after his
brother's death and after his political defeat in 1978, showed a
``normal grief reaction.'' But he added, ``He generally is very
strong in these situations.''
   He said the only surgery Dukakis has undergone was in 1936, when
he had his tonsils out as a child. Since 1971, the doctor reported,
Dukakis has suffered a variety of aches and pains _ including a
pulled achilles tendon and other ailments often experienced by
runners, hoarseness while he was a lecturer at Harvard and a cyst
on his back, successfully drained.
   The only prescription medicines he has taken during that period
have been antihistamines for hay fever and naproxin, a pain killer,
for muscular sprains and aches.
   Bush spokesman Stephen Hart said the vice president replied to a
medical questionnaire by the Detroit News on July 22 by saying that
his physician describes his health as ``excellent and vigorous.''
   As for health difficulties, Bush told the paper, ``I have mild
arthritis in the hips, which is non-limiting. I have cut back my
running to two miles at a time. Mild symptons are readily
controlled. I am also allergic to bee stings, for which I have
received shots that are highly effective.''

   A Romanian teen-ager among six foreign athletes
who refused to go home after the World Junior Track and Field
Championships last week turned herself in to police Wednesday and
requested political asylum.
   The 18-year-old woman, who disappeared for three days, is
staying in Sudbury, Ontario, where the track meet was held. Her
name was not released. Immigration officials confirmed that the
woman requested political asylum.
   Four other competitors from Poland and one from Ghana told
immigration officials they wanted to stay in Canada, and refugee
hearings have been scheduled for them next week. They are staying
with local families.
   The Polish team coach reported his athletes missing early Monday
morning and contacted Canadian officials, said Denis Boulanger,
manager of the Canadian Immigration Centre in Sudbury.
   The Ghanaian athlete ``walked up to an official'' at the games
and said he wanted to defect because he feared returning home,
Boulanger said.
   The athletes, all under 19, have no relatives in Canada,
Boulanger said.
   ``Of course, their coaches wanted them to go back,'' he said.
``There was resistance, I understand, but nothing physical.''
   A spokesman at the Polish Embassy in Ottawa said Wednesday,
``This is a human problem, not a political problem.''
   The athletes defected at the Athletes' Village at Laurentian
University where police had been instructed to prevent any attempt
to force the youths to go back to their homelands, Boulanger said.
   ``These are kids. They're not criminal types. So if someone is
willing to take care of them, then fine,'' he said.
   The five-day track and field competition included 1,200 athletes
from 122 countries.

   Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis is
in excellent health, has only received treatment for routine
ailments and ``has had no psychological symptoms, complaints or
treatment,'' his longtime doctor said Wednesday.
   Dr. Gerald R. Plotkin, at a news conference called by the
Dukakis campaign to dispel rumors the Massachusetts governor has
received psychiatric treatment, said Dukakis has never had such
treatment and has been prescribed drugs only for hay fever and
muscle sprains and aches.
   ``He has had no significant illnesses during his lifetime and
has been in excellent health,'' Plotkin said. ``He has never
appeared depressed to me.''
   Supporters of political extremist Lyndon LaRouche were
distributing fliers questioning Dukakis' mental capacity during the
Democratic National Convention in Atlanta.
   Plotkin released a three-page statement summarizing any
treatment he has given Dukakis over the past 17 years at the
Harvard Community Health Plan, a health maintenance organization
whose services are available through the state employees benefits
program. Prior to that, Dukakis was treated by his father, a family
doctor.
   Dukakis' wife Kitty, has decribed her husband as being depressed
following the 1973 death of his brother, Stelian, who was killed by
a hit-and-run driver, and after he lost the 1978 gubernatorial
primary after serving four years in the office.
   But Mrs. Dukakis said Wednesday during an appearance in New
Jersey that her husband has never seen a psychiatrist, and Plotkin
said Dukakis showed no signs of clinical depression.
   ``There is a normal grieving after any loss, from minor to
major, and the response usually is in relation to the gravity of
the loss,'' Plotkin said. ``I was struck at the time of both losses
at his strength rather then his depression. ... I saw him on a
number of occasions and he never demonstrated any symptoms or signs
that he would require counseling.''
   Stelian Dukakis suffered from clinical depression and once tried
to commit suicide. But Plotkin said the condition was not
hereditary.
   Plotkin said Dukakis has been treated for:
   _ Plantar fascitis, a form of minor foot discomfort associated
with jogging. Dukakis was treated in 1983. He since has given up
jogging but keeps an almost daily regimen of speed walking.
   _ A pinched nerve in his neck, in 1979.
   _ A pulled achilles tendon, in 1976.
   The prescribed treatment for those conditions was rest, heat and
naproxen, an anti-inflammatory medicine slightly more powerful than
aspirin, Plotkin said.
   The doctor said Dukakis also has received treatment for:
   _ A minor fracture of his collarbone, sufferred in a foot race
in Ireland in 1976.
   _ A splinter under the nail of his left index finger, in 1979.
   _ Hoarseness, in 1981, which was attributed to his lecturing at
the John F. Kennedy School of Government.
   _ A cyst on his back, in 1986, which was drained.
   Plotkin said the material he had released was essentially that
contained in his file on Dukakis with the exception of personal
notes.
   He said it was possible Dukakis could have seen another
physician or a psychiatrist but he did not believe he had.
   All of his tests were within normal limits, Plotkin said.

<HEAD>Dukakis' Wife Calls for U.S. Embassy Move to Jerusalem</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Kitty Dukakis, wife of Democratic presidential
nominee Michael Dukakis, was quoted as saying in an interview
published Wednesday that she favors moving the U.S. Embassy to the
disputed city of Jerusalem.
   Her husband stirred controversy last May when he said he
supported Israel's decision to move its capital from Tel Aviv to
Jerusalem. ``If Israel wants its capital in Jerusalem, then as far
as I'm concerned, its capital is in Jerusalem,'' Dukakis told The
Los Angeles Times.
   Despite Mrs. Dukakis' remark, she was quoted by the Israeli
weekly Haolam Hazeh as saying that ``the subject (of the capital's
location) should not be in the headlines now.''
   ``First, we must take care of more burning issues.''
   Mrs. Dukakis, who is Jewish, was interviewed in the United
States by a Haolam Hazeh reporter.
   Israel has declared Jerusalem its capital, but many countries do
not recognize it as such. U.S. officials say the U.S. embassy must
remain in Tel Aviv until the dispute over Jerusalem has been
resolved in peace negotiations.
   Israel annexed Arab east Jerusalem after capturing it from
Jordan in the 1967 Middle East war. The city is considered holy by
Jews, Moslems and Christians.
   Mrs. Dukakis also was quoted as saying that as first lady, she
would ``continue being a proud Jew,'' but as stressing that
religion and politics must remain separate.
   Mrs. Dukakis, who would be the first Jewish first lady if her
husband is elected next November, also said her first visit to
Israel in 1976 renewed her interest in Judaism, according to the
weekly.
   ``That visit changed everything for me,'' it quoted the
51-year-old Mrs. Dukakis as saying.
   Haolam Hazeh quoted her as saying the most important experience
of that trip was a visit to the Holocaust Memorial Yad Vashem in
Jerusalem. Six million Jews were killed by Nazi Germany in the
Holocaust.
   ``My parents left Germany before the Holocaust. They sensed what
was going to happen,'' she was quoted as saying. ``I was brought up
on this memory, but I don't think I understood the full
significance until I visited Yad Vashem.''
   Her parents, both Jewish, studied in Berlin but left before
World War II.
   Mrs. Dukakis said that if her husband is elected, she would like
him to appoint her to the President's Commission on the Holocaust,
according to the publication.
   Mrs. Dukakis was appointed to the panel by former President
Jimmy Carter, but his successor, Ronald Reagan, did not extend her
term when it expired in 1986.
   She also was quoted as saying her five visits to Israel have
strengthened her commitment to her religion.
   ``I grew up in a Jewish neighborhood (in Brookline, Mass.). I
used to go to synagogue with my grandmother, but I never studied in
a Jewish or religious school,'' Mrs. Dukakis said, according to
Haolam Hazeh.
   She was quoted as saying that after returning to the United
States from her first visit to Israel in 1976, she joined a
synagogue and began raising funds for the Jewish state.
   Asked whether her religion would affect how she would fill her
role as first lady, she said, according to the weekly: ``There is a
separation between church and state. This is very important and
must be protected.''
   It said that she added, however: ``I will continue being a proud
Jew in the White House, too.''

   President Reagan, giving up a fight that had
become a political ``tar baby'' for Republicans, is allowing to
become law federally mandated advance notices for workers who lose
their jobs to plant closings or large layoffs.
   Reagan, who earlier this year had vigorously opposed such a
measure, said Tuesday he would neither sign nor veto the required
60-day notices that both the House and Senate passed last month
with veto-proof two-thirds majorities.
   Instead, Reagan said he will allow to become law on Thursday,
without his signature, what he called bad legislation from a
Congress ``more interested in scoring points with organized labor
than in saving workers' jobs.''
   Reagan had vetoed a massive overhauling of the nation's trade
laws in May almost solely because it included the layoff notices,
calling them ``anti-competitive.''

Research, said Tuesday after Reagan's response.

legislation, Reagan referred the question to the Justice Department

   A new blast of scorching weather in the nation's midsection has

huge moisture deficit caused by the hot, dry spring and summer.
   ``We've never had temperatures like this that I can recall. I'd

   President Reagan vetoed a $299.5 billion
Pentagon budget bill Wednesday, charging congressional Democrats
with partisan politics and saying the bill would cripple his Star
Wars program and signal ``weakness and accommodation'' in U.S.
defense policy.
   Although the bill has become entangled in election-year politics
and leading Republicans had urged the president to veto it, Reagan
disavowed any political motives.
   ``These are issues of national security and they must remain
above partisan politics,'' he said.
   ``The partisan politics is on the other side,'' he added.
   The bill essentially would have authorized the spending levels
Reagan sought, but sought to rearrange spending priorities.
Administration officials complained that the legislation contained
language that would have tied the president's hands on future arms
control negotiations with the Soviet Union.

   Military investigators believe a U.S. Navy
cruiser attacked and destroyed an Iranian airliner July 3 because
of human mistakes made under the stress of combat, defense
officials said Wednesday.
   Because of the mistakes, the captain of the USS Vincennes
believed his ship had survived its first combat only to confront an
approaching, ``hostile'' Iranian jet fighter, said the sources, who
insisted on anonymity.
   In reality, the radar contact was a civilian airliner with 290
people aboard that had just taken off from a large military base at
Bandar Abbas, Iran.
   The classification of that radar contact as hostile appears to
have been made by crewmen in the heat of battle without adequate
technical justification, said one official.
   There is no evidence the cruiser's sophisticated Aegis radar air
defense system malfunctioned or that it presented technical data to
justify the ``hostile'' classification, the source added.

   The city and three councilmen paid $1,600
in contempt fines Wednesday, while the mayor warned that city
workers could be laid off this month unless Yonkers complies with a
federal housing desegregation order.
   U.S. District Judge Leonard Sand found the city and three
council members in contempt Tuesday for refusing to build
low-income housing units. Yonkers' $100 fine will double daily and
would wipe out the city's $337 million budget in 22 days.
   With a majority on the council opposed to the order _ and
unmoved so far by their own $500-a-day fines _ the city hoped to
get a quick stay of the contempt finding.
   State officials, meanwhile, considered a plan to seize control
of the city's purse strings and remove members of the Yonkers City
Council.

   Only the camels at the Ohio State Fair,
one of the largest fairs in North America, weren't suffering from
the heat and drought. Less exotic livestock had to be hosed down,
and the vegetables hardly looked like prize-winners.
   ``This is the worst display I have ever had,'' Tony Misich of
Clinton, near Akron in northeast Ohio, said of his produce. ``I've
had nothing but trouble this year.''
   The effects of the nation's worst drought in more than 50 years
were apparent as the Ohio State Fair prepared to open Thursday for
an 18-day run, making it the longest-running fair in the nation
this year.
   The temperature Wednesday, reaching 89 degrees by noon, was a
steamy reminder of weeks of heat and too little rain, and the
forecast for Thursday and possibly beyond was no better: 95-100
degrees with high humidity.

   Perhaps the summer's a bust when it gets too hot
to swim in Lake Michigan. Welcome to the Heat Wave of '88, Chicago
style.
   ``We call it burnout. The people just get too much sun and they
want to run and hide,'' says Harry Gillespie, supervisor of the
city's 31 beaches. ``The sand is too hot and the lake's only 75
degrees. The intense heat is driving people off the beach.''
   Chicago has been fiery, sultry, stifling, stuffy, sweltering,
torrid, tropical _ and all of the above. It's hard to find a
``hot'' adjective that isn't getting overworked.
   Through Wednesday, there were 35 days of temperatures at 90 or
above, and seven days at the century mark or higher, leaving in the
dust the record of four 100-degree days in a single summer, set in
1934, 1947 and 1953.

   The temperatures are in the 90s, the humidity is
brutal, and the beaches are closed. All in all, Lester Rawitz
figures, a pretty good New York summer.
   ``This is the biggest year I ever recall. We're completely
cleaned out,'' said Rawitz, a Manhattan air conditioner retailer
for the past 34 years, speaking from his air-conditioned office.
``There's no question it's been good.''
   Good for Rawitz; good and hot for almost everybody else. On 13
occasions last month, the mercury climbed above 90 degrees; in an
average New York July, the temperature breaks 90 just seven times.
The forecast for the current week calls for temperatures to crack
100.
   The temperature climbed into the 90s again on Wednesday, which
meant another day off for the horses which pull carriages in
Central Park. It was another day for tourists to sit in the spray
of a fountain outside the Exxon Building, and for Lester Rawitz to
smile inside the offices of Economy National Sales Inc.

   Men who have genital sores or are uncircumcised
have a much greater risk of catching AIDS during sexual intercourse
with infected women, a study concludes.
   The research, conducted in Kenya, suggests that the prevalence
of some sexually transmitted diseases, the common use of
prostitutes and the lower frequency of circumcision may help
explain why AIDS has spread widely through heterosexual contact in
parts of central Africa.
   While AIDS is transmitted mostly through homosexual encounters
and illicit drug use in the United States and Europe, experts
believe it is largely a heterosexual disease in Africa, where up to
a quarter of sexually active adults in some cities are infected.

   Rural families who have been blessed with a

   The exception to China's ``one-family, one-child'' policy was

   The new policy, which will not apply to city dwellers, was

<TEXT>
   At a recent news conference, NBC's Brandon
Tartikoff facetiously suggested ``Jerry Buck, Private Eye'' as a
replacement show on the network's fall schedule.
   Having a somewhat proprietary view of this new show, I have a
few suggestions to make.
   Tartikoff, who is president of NBC Entertainment, spoke of the
show during a news conference outlining how the network would cope
in the fall because of the writers strike.
   Explaining his idea for bringing back old shows as ``American
Revivals,'' Tartikoff said:
   ``You go and get eight or 10 `Richie Brockelman' scripts and
redo it (the decade-old series) with Bruce Willis and call it
`Jerry Buck, Private Eye' and I don't think viewer one would say,
`Wait a second, didn't I see that plot back in 1979?'''
   Now, I have no objection to Bruce Willis. We do sort of look
alike, except I'm taller. But ``Richie Brockelman, Private Eye''
has to go. That's as bad as ``The Hardy Boys,'' which Tartikoff
actually is reviving.
   Richie Brockelman was a wet-behind-the-ears kid. Wimp is an
expression that comes to mind. His mother and father even hung
around and worried about him and gave him advice. The show, which
ran briefly on NBC, was not something you'd want to see again. Even
with Bruce Willis and even retitled ``Jerry Buck, Private Eye.''
   The show was a spinoff of ``The Rockford Files.'' Now, there was
a detective series!
   If Tartikoff is going to bring back an old detective show and
name it after me, this is the one he should think about. James
Garner was Jim Rockford.
   Rockford's father also hung around, but it was different. His
pop, Rocky, didn't stand around and wring his hands. You could tell
he was a man's man because he drove a pickup truck.
   Rockford was down at the heels, the way a private eye's supposed
to be. Instead of a walk-up office in some seedy Hollywood building
and a wisecracking secretary, he lived on a trailer at the beach
and had an answering machine.
   It was a great show, quite possibly the best detective show ever
on television. Rockford frequently used questionable methods to
solve his cases. His disguises were always so transparent, his
bribes were too cheap to ever win over anybody, and he usually got
stiffed for his fee at the end of each episode.
   Rockford was sometimes outsmarted by other private detectives,
most notably Lance White. Lance White, who was sort of Mr. Perfect,
was played by Tom Selleck. Selleck, of course, went on to become
Thomas Magnum.
   Perhaps Tartikoff might consider the old scripts of ``Magnum,
P.I.'' for my show. I can see myself tooling around Oahu in Robin
Masters' red Ferrari. I could irritate Higgins as much as Magnum.
I'd also steer clear of Zeus and Apollo.
   ``Peter Gunn'' is another detective show Tartikoff should think
about reviving. It's not every private eye whose hangout was called
``Mother's.'' Or had a girlfriend like Edie. Besides, Henry
Mancini's jazzy theme was the first of the memorable television
themes.
   Other possible revivals: ``Mannix,'' ``McCloud,'' ``Barney
Miller,'' or even ``The Lone Ranger.'' I'd look good in a black
mask.
   ``Columbo'' was a possibility, but ABC beat NBC to the punch.
They've got Peter Falk back in the old raincoat. They're even
getting back that tiny Peugeot Cabriolet he got around in.
   So, Brandon, thanks for the offer, but I'll pass on ``Richie
Brockelman.''

<HEAD>Founder of Liberation Theology Fends Off Attacks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A stimulating ally of the poor, the Rev. Gustavo
Gutierrez, applies Christianity in ways that have prodded _ and
sometimes disturbed _ the church world.
   He is known as the father of ``liberation theology,'' which has
drawn both acclaim and denunciations. He lately discussed his
approach to U.S. and international church audiences.
   ``To be a church of the poor is not to lose, but to affirm our
identity,'' says the Peruvian Roman Catholic priest. ``lt is not to
reduce the Gospel. It is to be more faithful to the Gospel.''
   Gutierrez, 60, of Lima, Peru, coined the phrase, ``a theology of
liberation'' in a 1968 talk in a poor district, and later authored
a seminal book by that name.
   His ideas have ricocheted through modern church thought,
elaborated by other theologians and gaining a widespread following,
as well as some caustic and high-level criticism.
   Humorously tweaking his own writings, he says:
   ``The Vatican has devised a new form of torture. They have made
me defend what I have written. I have had to reread my writings
three times!''
   Marking the 20th anniversary of ``liberation theology,'' he was
honored at a mid-July ecumenical gathering at Maryknoll, N.Y.,
headquarters of the mission order of Maryknoll Fathers and Sisters.
   Liberation theology is hinged to the Bible's special concern for
the poor and Jesus' declaration of purpose to liberate the
suffering and oppressed. It identifies with their political
struggles for better conditions.
   The movement is particularly strong among worker ``base'
communities in South America. Critics have accused it of applying
Marxist analysis to instigate class struggle and socialism.
   Gutierrez says liberation theology, while using Marxist social
analysis, ``clearly excludes the possiblity of adopting Marxism as
a philosophical system which is in clear contradiction to a
believer's perspective.
   ``This should be obvious to everyone.''
   The Vatican in 1984 condemned some forms of liberation theology,
but then in 1986 offered a more positive assessment of it,
recognizing values in it in pursuing social justice.
   The critiques included some ``relevant observations for
myself,'' Gutierrez told National Catholic News Service. He said he
became ``more sensitive'' to the need for varied approaches.
   Among his observations culled by the National Catholic Reporter
from his discourses at Maryknoll:
   ``I am not interested in the future of liberation theology. I am
interested in the liberation of my people.''
   ``To announce liberation theology is to announce life,
resurrection in the face of death.''
   ``We must be friends of the poor. We do not love if we do not
consider others as equals.''
   ``I have learned from my people that to be a Christian is to
find joy in the midst of suffering... In finding joy, I can better
see the suffering.''
   Gutierrez also spoke at an international conference of Anglican
bishops ending this weekend in England, calling commitment to the
poor indispensable to living close to God.
   He said the poor are most sensitive to the key biblical message
_ that God gives his love freely. ``That is why the voice of the
poor is important for all Christians.''
   In an interview carried by Lutheran World Information service,
Gutierrez denied liberation theology foments class struggle, but he
added:
   ``There are conflicts in society, one of which is a
confrontation among classes... It is necessary to overcome this
situation in a perspective of justice and support for weak and
marginalized peoples.''
   Asked about claims he reduced religion to politics, he said he
tries to ``make demands of the Gospel present in the social and
poltical spheres. The preferential option for the poor based on
faith in God and Jesus Christ does not mean any single political
choice, but it does make demands.''
   He called right-wing charges that he is Marxist ``absolutely
false,'' declaring ``Christian faith gives meaning to my life.'' He
said ``there is a kind of McCarthyism at large,'' also existing in
``certain Christain sectors.''
   At an ecumenical dinner honoring him, he was called ``the
inspiration of the folks on the firing line'' by the Rev. Robert
McAfee Brown, a Presbyterian professor emeritus of the Pacific
School of Religion in Berkeley, Calif.
   China-appointed auxiliary Catholic Bishop of Shanghai Aloysius
Jin, imprisoned 27 years for his faith, told Gutierrez ``you did a
lot of good for the Chinese church.
   ``Anti-religious propagandists said the church was for the rich.
But we show your book, `Theology of Liberation,' to the communists
and we say to them, `You see, the church is for the poor.''

   ``Congratulations!'' reads the envelope. ``You
have won a free weekend at Seventh Heaven Lakes.''
   ``If you'll just take a few minutes to participate in our
survey,'' says the voice on the telephone, ``we'll send you a
valuable prize.''
   In the era of junk mail and junk calls, most Americans are
familiar with well disguised pitches for products and services of
dubious merit. They have developed a healthy sales resistance.
   Yet when it comes to investing their money, many people still
seem to be vulnerable to hucksters and con artists who play on
their greed.
   ``Americans lose hundreds of millions of dollars every year to
investment fraud,'' say the Council of Better Business Bureaus and
the North American Securities Administrators Association in their
recently published book ``Investor Alert!''
   ``It touches all segments of society _ the rich and the poor,
the young and the old.''
   One thriving, and especially virulent, institution is the
``boiler room,'' from which a squad of salesmen push real estate,
gold, commodity options or some other deal by telephone.
   ``Boiler room operations are thriving because investors,
including some normally sensible ones, persist in falling for deals
that come in cold by telephone,'' says Brad Hitchings, an analyst
at Standard & Poor's Corp., in S&P's advisory publication The
Outlook.
   ``The pitch is often highly convincing _ always plausible and
well laced with correct technical jargon.''
   And as the BBB and NASAA observe in their book, ``The lures
always include assurances that you can take the next step with
absolutely no commitments, see results quickly and get your money
back at any time if you are not satisfied with the deal.''
   Boiler-room operators can make false promises in abundance
because they are adept at disappearing quickly, only to appear
again with a new scam under a new name at a different address.
   How can you protect yourself from financial predators like
these? And how can you distinguish between a con artist and
somebody with a legitimate proposition to offer that might actually
pay off?
   Experts on the subject say it is wise to assume the worst when
you get an unexpected call (or letter or visit) from some stranger
whose firm you have never heard of.
   ``When in doubt,'' the BBB and NASAA advise, ``make no promises
or commitments, no matter how tentative. It is far better to wait
and lose an opportunity than to take the plunge and lose everything.
   ``When hounded on the phone by a promoter, don't be afraid to
hang up without explanation. You do not owe the caller anything _
in fact, this kind of solicitation is an invasion of your privacy.''
   If you don't adopt a ``just say no'' policy, advisers say, do a
lot of independent checking before you make the slightest
commitment to any deal.
   When a promoter insists an opportunity will be gone by the time
you make your own inquiries, it is almost surely a sign the
proposition is questionable or a downright fraud.
   ``Investor Alert'' tells the tale of a widow who was touted on a
silver investment because International Business Machines Corp. was
supposedly developing a new breed of computer that required pure
silver circuitry, which would cause the price of the metal to soar.
   She followed the precept ``investigate before you invest,'' and
determined that the stories of new solid-silver technology had no
basis in fact.
   ``The silver dealer turned out to be an old hand at gold and
silver swindles,'' the book reports, ``and was already folding up
shop and moving to a new location and a new con game.''

   The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America says
that none of three seminarians who publicly declared their
homosexuality last year will be recommended for ordination in the
5.3 million-member denomination.
   It said two of them, Jim Lascaster of Westminster, Calif, and
Joel Working of Walcott, N.D., were ruled out because they would
not pledge compliance with a policy allowing only non-practicing
homosexuals to be ordained.
   The third, Jeff Johnson of Lancaster, Calif., was excluded after
he told his bishop he would comply with the celibacy requirement
and would resign if that situation changed.
   Bishop Lyle Miller of San Francisco said that Johnson's
statement of compliance was ``conditional and temporary and
therefore not consistent with the spirit of the abstinence
requirement.''
   Miller said Johnson ``is a person of honesty and Christian
faith,'' but differences between his position and church policy
were ``too significant to allow for recommendation.''

   In the Netherlands, nearly 70 percent of the

services and challenging citizens to stand on their own feet. Here

   In his campaign to shake up one of
the world's most complete welfare states and make its citizenry
more responsible for themselves, Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers is his
own best advertisement.
   The lithe field hockey aficionado has twice chased down and
apprehended suspects trying to steal the radio from the Lubbers
family car outside their residence.
   The personal intervention by the immensely popular Lubbers gave
editorial cartoonists a field day and exemplified the changes the
49-year-old leader wants to work here.
   Lubbers' center-right coalition, in power for almost six years,
is putting the Netherlands through one of the most profound swing
in government policy since the welfare state took root following
the Depression era of privation and five years of harsh Nazi rule
during World War II.
   The prime minister commented in a recent interview with The
Associated Press that the 14-percent Dutch unemployment rate cannot
be addressed ``just by giving money to people, and say `Okay, there
you are, you have a decent life now because you have your money.' ''
   ``There is more than money involved in the welfare state. The
welfare state should be integrating people in the society,''
Lubbers said as he sipped black coffee in his office, located in a
restored 17th-century structure known to pundits as ``The Little
Tower.''
   The welfare state ethic is entrenched, but so is private
enterprise in this export-oriented nation of traders.
   The government's efforts to cut government back are colliding
with a society in which virtually every institution dealing with
public welfare or cultural enrichment _ from hospitals, child-care
centers and schools to theater groups, orchestras and museums _
receives public subsidies, if not complete funding.
   About 70 percent of the gross national product goes to pay for
government-provided services, from defense to health insurance,
dike building to pensions, unemployment, disability, sick pay and
child-support benefits.
   At the root of the system is what has come to be known
Europe-wide as ``Dutch liberalism.''
   That Dutch social philosophy is less liberalism than a pragmatic
policy of accomodation toward divergent lifestyles, ranging from
the nation's vibrant gay subculture to its squatter communities.
   The historic Dutch policy of tolerance drew immigrant groups who
have helped since the 15th century to build a trading giant.
   Critics say that same tolerance has made the Netherlands a haven
for drug abusers and counter-culture groups who bleed society
financially.
   But tolerance is a necessity in a densely-populated multiethnic
nation of about 14.6 million that is about the size of
Massachusetts, Connecticut and Rhode Island combined.
   Even major governmental policy decisions, such as the
potentially explosive decision to put new NATO cruise missiles
here, are arrived at by ``consensus-building'' to avoid the image
of policy-making by decree.
   When management and labor negotiate yearly industrial wage
standards, they refer to each other as ``social partners.'' The
Dutch have had no industrywide strikes in two decades.
   To foot the welfare state's bill, the Dutch citizen pays some of
the world's highest taxes. The tax and benefits burden averages
about 50 percent of the individual's salary, not including the 20
percent sales tax levied on most goods and services.
   A good part of the tax bite goes to support the unemployed, and
the government is trying to steer away from the philosophy that the
government dole is the only panacea for unemployment.
   ``If I say my only objective in the welfare state is to ban
poverty, you would find a society where too many people are out of
a job, although they are paid by the welfare system,'' Lubbers told
the AP.
   ``On the other hand, if you look only to the statistics of full
employment, you can make a horrible mistake,'' he added. ``You can
have a society in which everybody has work, but there is no welfare.
   ``We have to promote a climate in which citizens feel themselves
responsible for certain aspects of their welfare ...'' Lubbers said.
   In six years the Lubbers government has effectively frozen most
welfare and unemployment benefits and eliminated other social
programs entirely in an attempt to free up capital for
job-generating industrial development.
   Its enlistment of industry in job-training and placement plans
is part of its policy of lessening day-to-day dependency on the
central government by farming out to private industry and community
groups many government services, such as health care insurance and
housing financing.
   In his first four years in office, Lubbers' government bailed
out one of the country's largest shipyards; in the next two years
it was sold off. Government ownership of KLM has gone from 54
percent to 39.4 percent of the airline.
   Critics say Lubbers is putting the health of the economy before
the health of the man in the street in his attempt to cut a
burdensome government deficit.
   A 23 billion guilder ($11 billion) deficit is forecast this
year, compared to a total Dutch budget of 168 billion guilders ($80
billion).
   This spring, the government decided on cuts for 1989 and 1990 in
education, housing and social assistance programs such as refugee
relief. The cuts are almost certain to pass Parliament.
   ``We have a welfare state, but for how long?'' said Paulus Plas
of the Federation of Dutch Trade Unions, the nation's largest union
group with 900,000 members.
   Said welfare administrator Berty Beltman, ``This is a group that
will not make a revolution ... they are the powerless.''
   The Lubbers government says that by trying to integrate an
unemployed individual into society it is preserving the best
elements of the welfare state without draining the rest of the
economy to pay for it.
   That sense of accomodation is also apparent in the Dutch
approach to international issues.
   The moralistic tradition of Dutch Calvinism has spawned a social
and political consciousness that leads the government as well as
the well-informed Dutch populace to take stands on all major
political issues.
   There are strong anti-nuclear, anti-apartheid, Kurdish and
pro-Palestinian movements here. Amsterdam is home to the Bukovsky
Foundation, one of West's most active groups monitoring Soviet
dissidents.
   But the Dutch are staunch members of the Western Alliance and
frequently adopt foreign policy positions close to those of the
U.S. government.
   In his first term, Lubbers took on an issue that was perceived
as a loaded gun pointed at his government _ the proposal to put new
cruise missiles in the Netherlands. Recognizing the grassroots
sentiment against nuclear weapons, Lubbers moved the issue through
Parliament slowly, refusing to be pushed and allowing all sides to
have a say.
   The siting idea was approved in November 1985 and Lubbers'
coalition handily won the 1986 election. Then President Reagan and
Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev agreed to eliminate
intermediate-range nuclear weapons, and the Dutch breathed a
collective sigh of relief.
   Looking back on that treaty, Lubbers recalled that a reporter
had asked who he thought was the Man of the Year.
   ``He expected me to say Gorbachev. But I said (U.S. Secretary of
State George) Shultz, of course.
   ``I think Shultz was the most important participant in the
process. He had very good timing, his substance and political
judgment was very good.''
   Or to put it another way, he could probably handle Dutch-style
accomodation and consensus-building.

   When the Dutch confront
controversial issues like euthanasia, drug abuse, and AIDS, their
reaction is firmly rooted in a tradition of tolerance and consensus.
   ``Dutch politics since the 17th century have been marked by
attempts to forge compromise and harmony between competing
interests and ideologies,'' said Leen Vroegindewey, a political
scientist at Leiden University, the nation's oldest.
   ``More often than not, those compromises are far more pragmatic
than partisan solutions would be in the sense that the sharp
ideological edges have eroded from the issue in the course of the
public debate,'' Vroegindewey told The Associated Press in a recent
interview.
   The euthanasia debate raged for years in Parliament, newspapers,
hospitals, and from the pulpit. The practice is widespread here,
with an estimated 5,000 cases annually, according to recent
government figures.
   The center-right coalition government of Prime Minister Ruud
Lubbers, in which the anti-euthanasia Christian Democrats dominate,
vetoed a proposal to permit euthanasia. It then introduced
legislation that does not decriminalize euthanasia, but sets
guidelines that physicians can use as a defense in courts.
   In the few euthanasia cases that have gone to court, only
suspended sentences have been routinely imposed. Vroegindewey
referred to the legislation, which has not yet come to a vote, as
``an archetypical Dutch compromise.''
   In another example, police tolerate the small-scale possession
and use of hashish and marijuana, which is readily available in
Dutch coffee shops. The city has methadone clinics for its
estimated 7,000 drug addicts.
   ``There has been a lot of clamor in the surrounding countries on
how we do it here,'' said Amsterdam police spokesman Klaas Wilting.
``But I'd like to claim that although we haven't solved the drug
problem, it's at least contained.''
   After a spectacular rise in the 1970s and early 1980s, the
number of drug-related crimes stabilized. And while cocaine
consumption in the United States skyrocketed, here it declined,
according to the Dutch Justice Ministry.
   Despite the opposition of the religious right, the Dutch
government reacted to acquired immune deficiency syndrome with a
``safe sex'' information campaign, and local authorities provided
free hypodermic needles to intravenous drug abusers, one of the
worst risk groups.
   ``Whatever the government might think of it, they know that
proselytizing against adultery, promiscuity and premarital sex will
have very little impact here,'' said Amsterdam sociologist Enna van
Lingen.
   Amsterdam health authorities claim the free needle program has
been a major factor in fighting AIDS. Only 539 cases have been
reported in the Netherlands, one of the lowest incidence rates in
the Western world.

   Here are some facts and figures on the Netherlands:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   AREA - The Netherlands covers 16,589 square miles, about the
size of Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut combined. Some
40 percent of its territory lies below sea level, necessitating an
elaborate system of waterworks and dams to keep out the North Sea.
Amsterdam is the capital; the government sits in The Hague. The
Netherlands is bordered by West Germany to the east, by Belgium to
the south, and by the North Sea to the west and north.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   POPULATION _ The Netherlands, with 14.6 million people, is one
of the most densely-populated countries in the world. Ethnic
minorities include about 200,000 people from Suriname, a former
Dutch colony in South America, and about half a million migrant
workers and their families, mainly from Turkey and Morocco. Of the
indigeneous population, 36 percent is Roman Catholic and 26 percent
is Protestant, with nearly 35 percent non-believers.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   POLITICS _ The Netherlands is a constitutional monarchy whose
head of state, Queen Beatrix, wields practically no power.
Virtually all postwar governments have been coalitions that
included the centrist Christian Democrats or their precursors, with
right-wing liberals and the left-of-center Labor party coming into
the governing coalitions every decade or so.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ECONOMY _ The nation, which lies on one of the busiest shipping
routes in the world and is at the western edge of central Europe,
has traditionally been strong in trade and transportation.
Rotterdam is the largest port in the world. Primary Dutch exports
are foodstuffs, with dairy products and vegetables dominant, as
well as chemicals, electronic equipment and natural gas.
Unemployment stands at 14 percent, one of the highest rates in the
industrialized world.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   HISTORY _ The current Kingdom of the Netherlands was founded in
1813, but its roots go back to the 12th-century fiefdoms of
Holland, Zeeland and Friesland. The forerunner of the modern Dutch
state developed during the Eighty Years War against Spain in the
late 16th and early 17th century, bringing ascendancy to Queen
Beatrix's House of Orange. The 17th century marked an economic and
cultural heyday. Neutral in World War I, the Netherlands was
overrun by Nazi Germany in May 1940, and the ensuing five-year
occupation was one of the harshest in Europe.

<HEAD>Is The GOP Ready For The Big Easy?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KEVIN McGILL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Are the Republicans really ready for the
all-night bars, the strip joints and the cross-dressers in full
beard and make-up that have become synonymous with New Orleans?
   This city doesn't fit the blue-suited, buttoned-down image of a
George Bush or the piety of a Pat Robertson. The standing joke
around town is that the unabashed bawdiness of New Orleans will be
wasted on the GOP.
   But, ready or not, the Republicans are coming. And if they look
beyond the strip joints and obscene posters in the T-shirt shops,
they'll find that there is more to New Orleans than licentiousness
and inebriation.
   ``We really want them to get under the skin of this city,'' said
Peggy Wilson, the only Republican on the City Council. ``It's not
like other American cities. It has sort of a funny personality. We
feel if people get to know it, they'll like it and want to come
back.''
   Some 510 parties will be held to welcome the Republicans to New
Orleans, all but four by invitation only.
   The parties include one to celebrate the opening of the city's
newest shopping mall, a $100-a-person fund-raiser at the Audobon
Zoo designed to raise up to $400,000 to help the city defray
convention costs and a $10-a-person prayer breakfast.
   The New Orleans Museum of Art is sponsoring a picnic _ ``A Grand
Party for the Grand Old Party'' _ in City Park on Aug. 12, the
Friday before the convention begins.
   Among the other things New Orleans has to offer the delegates:
   _Gluttony. Sometimes elegant gluttony. About 2,500 restaurants
lie in a 50-mile radius. They range from the swanky splendor of
Commander's Palace _ which rests among the 19th century mansions of
the Garden District _ to the back-slapping camaraderie of scores of
neighborhood eateries.
   Seafood from the Gulf of Mexico is a staple at most of these
places. Creole cooking, born of French and Spanish influences, is
also a specialty, as is Cajun cuisine, a legacy of French Canadian
exiles who started settling the southwestern part of the state in
the 1760s.
   About 200 restaurants are so eager to please visitors that they
will extend operating hours until after midnight.
   _Music. Jazz is the musical staple of New Orleans. It's not as
prevalent in the French Quarter as it used to be. But it's there,
at open-air night clubs near the French Market, under a street lamp
where a lone musician plays his saxophone, or at Preservation Hall,
the musty hole in the wall on St. Peter Street where traditional
jazz is home.
   Rhythm and blues and rock are readily available. Cajun bands
play for dances. Some clubs cater to contemporary jazz. There are
cabarets and floor shows. Classical music is hard to find, however,
since the symphony hit on hard times and became inactive.
   _History and Culture. Museums and century-old buildings in the
Garden District and the Quarter are big tourist attractions. So are
the ornate, above-ground tombs in the city's flood-prone
cemeteries. The Republicans are lining up several guided tours,
including trips to antebellum plantations up the Mississippi River.
   _Shopping. Upscale art galleries and antique shops share the
Quarter with the strip joints and bars. Some fancy shops have
relocated to Magazine Street, closer to homes in the rich Garden
District.
   Despite the area's depressed economy, new retail developments
have been springing up. The Riverwalk, along the Mississippi,
opened a couple of years ago, hosting tenants such as Abercrombie &
Fitch. Saks Fifth Avenue is downtown. Macy's and Lord & Taylor are
part of a new complex adjacent to the Superdome.
   _Animals. The Audubon Park Zoo, once derided as one of the worst
zoos in the country, has been transformed over the last decade into
a nationally acclaimed showcase. It's latest pride and joy: a pair
of rare, white baby alligators.
   _Sport. Well, sometimes. The city lost it's pro basketball team
in 1976 and major league baseball is still a dream. Delegates
missed out on their one chance to see football when the New Orleans
Saints _ winners last year after 20 years of losing _ moved a
planned August exhibition game out of town so their home stadium,
the Superdome, can play host to the GOP.

<HEAD>James Baker Set to Chair Campaign of `Real Friend' _ George Bush</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Among the mementos Treasury Secretary James A.
Baker III keeps on the wall in his office are a photograph of a
smiling George Bush and a framed copy of a Texas newspaper article
from the 1930s.
   The Bush picture is autographed: ``What would we do without real
friends?'' And the newspaper article quotes millionaire grandfather
``Captain'' James A. Baker's formula for success: ``Work hard,
study and keep out of politics.''
   When it came to that last piece of advice, Baker went his own
way. that ``real friend'' is part of the reason why.
   Baker is poised to become Bush's presidential campaign chairman
after resigning his Treasury job. It's a scene similar to the one
18 years ago when Baker took time out from his Houston corporate
law practice to dabble in politics for the first time.
   At the time, Baker heeded a request for campaign help from a
tennis partner at the Houston Country Club, then-congressman George
Bush, who was running for the Senate _ against a Democrat named
Lloyd Bentsen.
   Bitten by the political bug, Baker _ then a Democrat _ became a
Republican at Bush's urging, and a fast friendship and political
alliance blossomed between the two Texans. Their careers have been
intertwined ever since.
   Clearly, Baker is leaving the Treasury post with some reluctance.
   Baker has amassed more influence than any other recent secretary
of the Treasury _ a job he assumed in 1985 when, as President
Reagan's first-term chief-of-staff, he engaged in a celebrated
``job switch'' with Donald T. Regan.
   The nation is in its 69th month of a record peacetime expansion,
unemployment is it at lowest level in 14 years, and the nation's
massive trade deficit finally is beginning to shrink _ due in part
to Baker's intricate management of the dollar.
   He is credited with steering the 1986 tax-overhaul bill through
Congress, just as he had manuevered the Reagan tax cut through a
Democratic Congress in 1981 as chief of staff.
   Baker has won plaudits internationally for persuading U.S.
allies to coordinate their economic polices and for negotiating a
U.S.-Canadian free trade pact.
   ``These are some of the things I think will survive this
administration. And I think they are, hopefully, some important
achievements,'' Baker said in an interview.
   While it is believed that Baker could have any post in a Bush
administration he wanted _ his associates say he would like to be
secretary of state _ the 58-year-old Baker shrugs off such
speculation.
   ``I would like to make sure I finish my job here and do it
right.''
   Baker and Bush _ six years his senior _ seem to be cut out of
the same patrician cloth.
   Both come from wealthy families, both went to prep schools in
the East _ Bush to Phillips Academy in Andover, Mass., and Baker to
the Hill School in Pottstown, Pa. And both graduated from Ivy
League colleges: Baker, Princeton; Bush, Yale.
   Baker, who was born in Houston, and Bush, who grew up in
Connecticut but considers Texas his adopted state, both are viewed
as political moderates and pragmatists.
   Both share a love of Mexican food and sports.
   Bush boats and fishes; Baker fishes and hunts.
   And while both Baker and Bush have proven adept at winning
appointive office _ Baker also served as an undersecretary of
Commerce in the Ford administration _ the two have been less
successful in getting each other elected.
   Despite Baker's help, Bush lost that 1970 Senate race to Bentsen
as well as his 1980 race against Reagan for the Republican
presidential nominaiton. And, despite Bush's help, Baker lost his
only try at elective office _ a 1978 race for Texas attorney
general.
   Still, Baker today has a reputation as one of the Republican
Party's craftiest political strategists _ a reputation honed when
he signed on in 1976 as President Gerald Ford's chief delegate
hunter after Ford lost five straight primaries to Ronald Reagan.
   Baker came up with the delegates that helped Ford narrowly
defeat Reagan for the GOP nomination; and as general-election
campaign manager for Ford saw the former president's 30-plus lag in
the polls to Democrat Jimmy Carter close to within one percentage
point of the total vote.
   Baker is also credited with masterminding Bush's dramatic
victory in the Iowa caucuses in 1980.
   ``He's very good. He was very good for Ford, when he really did
make a big difference when he got deeply involved; and he's been a
good help to Bush,'' said John Sears, a political consultant who
represented Reagan in that 1976 head-to-head scramble with Baker
for delegates.
   ``For one thing, he brings to (the 1988 Bush campaign) one very
important ingredient: he can handle the candidate. No one else is
around who has that kind of level relationship with George,'' said
Sears.
   A good campaign manager has to have a multitude of virtues, Bush
wrote in his autobiography, ``Looking Forward.'' The most
important, he said, is being ``able to tell his candidate what the
candidate doesn't want to hear.''
   That moment of truth came in June 1980, right before the
California primary when Bush was seriously trailing Reagan and out
of money, but wanted to press on anyway.
   Bush quotes Baker as telling him: ``The campaign is finished,
George. You're the only one who doesn't seem to know it.''
   Reagan made Baker a special campaign assistant after the 1980
convention. Baker took on the role of helping Reagan prepare for
his debates against then-President Carter.
   When Reagan was elected, he quickly announced that Baker would
be his chief-of-staff.
   Baker quickly went to work in quietly guiding Reagan's
supply-side tax cut and other first-term initiatives through
Congress. His ability to get along with congressional Democrats
continued after he switched jobs.
   Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., chairman of the House Ways and
Means Committee, calls Baker ``an honest adversary'' with ``a first
class political gut.''
   Many Baker admirers claim that some of the problems afflicting
the Reagan administration over the past few years _ including the
Iran-contra arms sales _ might not have happened had Baker remained
on as chief of staff, with his immense attention for detail.
   Still, despite Baker's celebrated penchant for caution and
keeping out of the public spotlight, he hasn't always been
successful.
   In 1985, aboard Air Force One en route to China with Reagan,
Baker was asked if he'd ever been to a communist country. ``Well,
I've been to Massachsetts,'' he said.
   That comment _ for which Baker later apologized _ brought a
testy letter from the state's governor, Michael Dukakis. Dukakis
invited Baker to ride on the Boston subway route known as ``The Red
Line.''
   And some economists claim that Baker's remarks in criticizing
West German interest rates last October helped trigger the record
508-point stock market crash.
   ``His comments clearly disturbed the markets,'' said David Wyss,
chief financial economist for Data Resources Inc. ``He was pushing
a little to hard.''
   However, Wyss overall said Baker ``has been a very good treasury
secretary. He made some mistakes but he grew into the job.''
   One of Baker's chief initiatives as treasury secretary _ a plan
to help ease the Third World debt crisis with a $29 million package
of new loans, mostly from commercial banks _ never bore fruit.
   However, Baker still lists that debt-relief plan as one of his
major initiatives _ and one that may still come to pass. ``Our
approach is the only viable approach if you're not going to try to
solve (the debt problem) on the backs of taxpayers in creditor
countries,'' he said.

<HEAD>Robertson's Legacy: Thousands Active in GOP and a 25-Minute Speech</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By D.W. PAGE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHESAPEAKE, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>

   Pat Robertson says the legacy of his
failed presidential bid are ``the tens of thousands of people who
are now activated in the political life of America'' and the 25
minutes of prime time the Republican National Committee will give
him at the convention.
   But longtime Robertson watchers say the former Southern Baptist
preacher and president of the Christian Broadcasting Network may be
misinterpreting his political impact.
   ``He is going to have a very miniscule role in the convention,''
said Mark Rozell, a political scientist from Mary Washington
University in Fredericksburg, Va. ``And, frankly, I think he is
overstating his importance to the conservative movement.''
   ``It's a mixed blessing that Robertson bestows on the party,''
said Larry Sabato, a University of Virginia political scientist.
``He is not an appealing figure to young Republicans who bring a
libertarian flavor to the party. Robertson is anything but
libertarian.''
   Robertson sees himself as the party's conservative
standard-bearer, leading thousands of new members.
   ``The reward that I have from this effort,'' Robertson said
recently in an interview with The Associated Press, ``is to be
found in the tens of thousands of people who are now activated in
the political life of America.''
   Robertson's campaign utilized a strong grassroots organization
of political neophytes, many from fundamentalist or charismatic
churches, to seize control of the party leadership on the local
level in several states.
   The operation resulted in a pattern for the campaign _ poor
finishes in primaries such as New Hampshire and moderate successes
in caucuses, including Iowa.
   In his home state of Virginia, Robertson placed third among
three candidates. Seven days later, he laid off his top two
campaign aides, cut the staff and said he would limit his
campaigning to states with caucuses.
   In April, Robertson said he was withdrawing from the race, then
later amended that to suspending his campaign. While pledging his
support for Bush, Robertson refused to release his delegates,
saying he wanted to go to the national convention as the
conservative voice of the party.
   Shortly thereafter, he returned to CBN to rescue the financially
strapped religious broadcasting empire that had laid off more than
1,000 workers during his campaign and cut its budget by more than
40 percent as contributions dwindled.
   Robertson goes to the convention pushing for a platform that
mirrors the 1980 and 1984 versions on which Ronald Reagan was
elected. Those battles were fought and won by conservatives at the
last two conventions, giving Robertson no new ground.
   And with only about 200 delegates to Bush's 2,000, Robertson
``has no leverage on the platform issues,'' Rozell said.
   ``The Robertson people are perceived to be there not to support
the ticket, but to support Pat,'' said Rozell, who is the co-editor
of a soon-to-be released book on the contemporary conservative
movement. ``So the party regulars are making overtures to them
through Robertson.''
   Robertson said his speech will deal with foreign policy. Sabato
believes the topic is significant.
   ``I think it's an attempt to keep him off social issues where he
tends to turn off young people,'' he said. ``You can bet that
Bush's people will be at work editing the speech.''
   Robertson points to the scheduling of his speech _ the Tuesday
night of the convention _ as a sign of his standing in the party.
His speech follows a tribute to former Arizona Sen. Barry
Goldwater, the party's 1964 presidential nominee and longtime
leader of its conservative wing.
   Robertson will be introduced by Goldwater's former campaign
manager, Cliff White, showing ``the continuity of conservatism over
the last 25 years of the party.
   ``It would be nice to have Barry Goldwater's campaign manager
come and say this is the conservative leader who fits in with some
of the things that have come from the past,'' Robertson said.
   ``That is a vast overstatement,'' Rozell said. ``And I imagine a
lot of conservatives are uncomfortable. Most of them came up
through the ranks of government and fought for the conservative
cause from within. Now Robertson is showing up _ an outsider _ and
claiming to be the heir-apparent.
   ``That ought to anger the (New York Rep. Jack) Kemp
supporters,'' he said.
   Robertson, who is back hosting the CBN's flagship program, ``The
700 Club,'' said he hopes to broaden news coverage and its appeal
to young professional viewers. He said the ministry has turned the
corner and that donations are starting to go up again.
   But his presidential campaign is still more than $1 million in
debt, and he has turned to his supporters for more money, couched
in language that is vintage Robertson.
   ``I ran for president because I felt God wanted me to run for
president,'' he said in a recent letter to supporters. ``My faith
was ridiculed. My motives and my words distorted. Lies were spread
about my war record, my education, and my resume.
   ``Why did I go through all of this? The answer is very simple.
God does not want us to turn America over to radical feminists,
drug dealers, militant homosexuals, profligate spenders, humanists
or world communists. God does not want our unborn babies
slaughtered, our homes broken up, our bodies defiled, or our little
children forbidden to pray in our schools.''
   He then asks for $25 donations to retire the debt, otherwise,
``All my future work as your champion would be injured.''

<HEAD>Virginia Madsen is Gorgeous, Grasping Ghost in Showtime `Gotham'</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JERRY BUCK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Virginia Madsen, looking most unlike the
haunting spirit she plays in Showtime's ``Gotham,'' romped on the
sofa with her yellowish-white ``mutt.''
   Whiskey, a mixture of Australian shepherd and timber wolf,
licked her face and snuggled close.
   Madsen stars in ``Gotham'' with Tommy Lee Jones as a sultry
spirit who doesn't want to give up the ghost.
   ``Rachel doesn't get it, she doesn't realize she has to go to
the hereafter,'' said Madsen, shooing Whiskey off so she could talk.
   ``I didn't see Rachel as a villain. You have to consider the
ghost. She could be frightened and confused.''
   In the movie, which Showtime will cablecast beginning Sunday,
she is a beautiful socialite killed in a boating accident who
haunts her husband because he did not bury her jewels with her. She
is pursuing him for the jewels. Her husband Charlie (Colin Bruce)
hires private eye Eddie Mallard (Jones) to get her to leave him
alone. Mallard, of course, falls in love with Rachel.
   Lloyd Fonvielle wrote and directed the movie, which was filmed
on location in New York and Toronto. The movie effectively uses
lighting and atmosphere to give it the feel of a 1940s ``film
noir.''
   ``It's a mysterious love story,'' she said. ``I don't want to
call it a ghost story, because it's not really about her being a
ghost. She's very earthbound. As Tommy Lee said, `It's a story
about a gumshoe and the femme fatale, only she's a bit more fatale
than usual.'''
   If the voice of the unseen bartender in ``Gotham'' sounds
familiar, you're on the right track. It's Dabney Coleman.
   Madsen was in the living room of her rented home in the
Hollywood Hills, which she will be vacating soon for a larger house
she is buying. She sat directly beneath a skylight, which made her
cornsilk hair and milkwhite skin seem luminescent. The room was
decorated with old toys and memorabilia from the 1930s. In the
bookcase were two travel books, one of Yugoslavia, where she played
Mussolini's mistress Claretta Petacci in the NBC miniseries
``Mussolini: The Untold Story,'' and one on Florida, where she
starred in the HBO movie ``Long Gone.''
   Family pictures were on the kitchen counter, including one of
her brother, actor Michael Madsen in his baseball uniform from
``The Natural.'' He also starred in the ABC series ``Family Honor.''
   She is currently between movies. Besides, ``Gotham,'' she
recently completed ``Hot to Trot,'' a comedy about a talking horse,
and ``Heart of Dixie'' and ``Mr. North,'' directed by Danny Huston.
Anjelica Huston appears in the movie which was intended to feature
their father, John Huston. When Huston died he was replaced by
Robert Mitchum.
   ``Heart of Dixie,'' from the novel ``Heartbreak Hotel,'' tells
the story of three young women in Alabama in 1957. The movie also
stars Phoebe Cates and Ally Sheedy. It was filmed in Mississippi.
   ``It's a time of innocence in their lives,'' she said, ``and
when the civil rights movement begins we see how it affects each
one. Ally sees a man being beaten by the police and is sprayed with
his blood. Phoebe's already at an age where you know she's going to
become a Greenwich Village beatnik. My character starts out wild
and bawdy, but through a tragedy I become very proper. Treat
Williams plays an AP reporter who covers the racial problems.''
   Madsen, who grew up in the Chicago area, said, ``I was acting
always. I never grew out of make-believe. I never grew out of
dress-up. What was playtime became my profession. I was very
serious about it. My mother never pushed me into commercials or
community theater or anything professional. She felt I would lose
the magic. I'm very grateful to her for not being a stage mother.
   ``I still feel the magic. People who start out young rarely stay
in the business. She wanted me to be sure of myself as a person
before I started. Of course, when I did start in Chicago I couldn't
get arrested there.''
   She did work in the movie ``Class'' while still in Chicago and
did a Public Broadcasting Service special. ``That gave me a little
chunk of money to come out here and get settled. My brother was
already here and working. I guess my big break was in `Dune,' but
it wasn't very successful. It did cause a little buzz about me. I
was thought of as another Princess Leia, but an evil Princess Leia.
It did create work for me.''

<DATELINE>OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Tribune newspaper on Tuesday
announced realignment of its executive operations, with editor and
president Robert C. Maynard sharing control with three executives
and creating a new chief executive position.
   Maynard told the newspaper's staff Monday that he would share
the new responsibilities with three senior vice presidents.
   Leroy F. Aarons, 54, formerly vice president and executive
editor, is now senior vice president of news.
   Susan Tohbe, 40, formerly vice president of finance, has been
named senior vice president in charge of industrial relations,
operations and management systems.
   Nancy Hicks Maynard, 41, Maynard's wife, has been vice president
of planning. She becomes senior vice president for overseeing
circulation, advertising and marketing.
   In a preparted statement, Maynard said the creation of the chief
executive position serves the newspaper's goals of ``Maximum
responsiveness to the needs and concerns of our readers, and
maximum efficiency in our methods of operation.''
   Joseph J. Haraburda, former senior vice president and general
manager, has left the newspaper.
   Maynard became the first black owner of a major metropolitan
newspaper in the United States in 1983, when he and Beverly Hills
lawyer Paul R. Greenberg bought the Tribune from Gannett Co. for
$22 million.
   The Tribune's daily circulation for the 12-month period ended
September 1987 was 149,256 and 150,089 for Sunday editions,
according to Dan Sidbury, director of circulation.

said goes a step beyond the oil giant's $5 billion restructuring
program.
   The planned spinoff announced Tuesday would mark Texaco's third
major sale of operating assets under the restructuring, which was
designed to shed marginally profitable operations and boost the
value of the company's stock. Analysts estimated the sale could net
the company up to $4 billion.

   The outlook, released Tuesday, was based on reports from all 12

<HEAD>Economic Barometer Leaps 1.4 Percent, But Inflation Fears Are Mild</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Fears of surging inflation have remained modest among many
observers despite three government reports indicating surprisingly
robust economic growth in the month of June.
   The government's main forecasting gauge rose 1.4 percent, its
biggest gain in 18 months; sales of new homes shot up 8.4 percent;
and orders to U.S. factories for manufactured goods soared 5.5
percent, the government said Tuesday in a series of reports.
   Prices rose Tuesday in the bond market, which often is hurt by
news of strong growth because of the fear that a boom in the
economy will contribute to higher inflation and erode the value of
fixed-income securities.
   Meanwhile, the stock market struggled through an uneven session
as the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 0.71 point to
2,131.22. Stocks normally react better than bonds to strong
economic growth because of the prospect for rising corporate
profits.
   The Commerce Department said the increase in its Index of
Leading Indicators was the sharpest rise in 18 months.
   Analysts credited renewed consumer confidence for the rebound in
sales of new homes after a sluggish period earlier this spring.
   The 5.5 percent rise in factory orders was the largest one-month
advance in more than 17 years and was propelled by the biggest
increase in military orders in more than five years.
   ``The leading index has been up in four of the last five months.
You have to consider that very good news for the economy,'' said
David Wyss, chief financial economist for Data Resources Inc.
``There is certainly no sign of a recession coming at least for the
rest of this year.''
   The economy, as measured by the gross national product, expanded
at a healthy 3.3 percent annual rate in the first six months of
1988, far better than many economists had expected following last
October's stock market crash.
   Given the momentum provided by exceptionally strong activity in
June, many analysts said they expected growth in the current
July-September quarter to remain strong.
   Many analysts worry that strong growth eventually will prompt
the Federal Reserve Board to boost interest rates to restrain
inflation.
   The Fed, in a review of the economy released Tuesday, noted
rising prices for a wide variety of materials from metals and paper
to food. The report, prepared for Fed policymakers, said high
factory operating rates in many industries were beginning to reach
capacity restraints.
   Many analysts say that while the economy will continue growing
at a good clip this year, the Fed's efforts to fight inflationary
pressures could result in a recession sometime in 1989.
   Analysts said the increase in the leading index partly was a
rebound from May, when the index dropped 0.8 percent after three
months of solid gains. The June advance was the biggest one-month
rise since the index climbed 2.2 percent in December 1986.

<HEAD>Oil Futures Decline Ahead of OPEC Committee Meeting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Traders' skepticism about today's OPEC pricing
committee meeting has weakened oil futures prices.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the contract for September
delivery of West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S.
crude oil, fell 47 cents a barrel Tuesday to close at $15.61. The
September contract had lost 23 cents on Monday.
   Futures prices for refined oil products also retreated. The
September contract for wholesale heating oil dropped 0.83 cent a
gallon to finish at 44.29 cents, while wholesale unleaded gasoline
for September fell 0.73 cent a gallon to 47.86 cents.
   Analysts said traders were doubtful the 13-nation Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries, which was to hold a meeting of
its price-monitoring committee today in Lausanne, Switzerland, will
take effective action to bolster oil prices.
   ``I think there's a lot of doubt,'' said Peter Beutel, assistant
director of the energy group at Elders Futures Inc.
   Even if the meeting of the five-member price-monitoring
committee turns into a full-scale OPEC ministerial conference, the
market could remain skeptical, Beutel said. ``Then the question
becomes, `What are they (OPEC) going to do from there?''' he said.
   Indonesian Oil Minister Ginandjar Kartasasmita, arriving for the
meeting in Lausanne, said Tuesday he would not exclude the
possibility of an emergency OPEC conference following the
price-monitoring panel's meeting.
   In addition to Kartasasmita, the price-monitoring committee
includes the oil ministers of Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, Algeria and
Nigeria.

<HEAD>Texaco Plans To Sell Interest in Texaco Canada</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARIANN CAPRINO</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Texaco Inc.'s disclosure that it plans to sell
its majority holding in profitable Texaco Canada Inc. has drawn
renewed interest from two Canadian oil companies that previously
had talked about buying the stake.
   Texaco said Tuesday it has decided to sell its 78 percent stake
in Texaco Canada, which is worth about $2.7 billion at current
stock prices. Analysts estimate that a buyer purchasing the entire
block probably would pay a premium price of between $3 billion and
$4 billion.
   The sale of the Canadian subsidiary would be the third major
sale of operating assets under Texaco's continuing restructuring
program, although analysts characterized the spinoff as going
beyond the $5 billion program.
   Fresh from victory in a bitter proxy fight with Carl C. Icahn,
Texaco already has orchestrated the sale of more than $2.5 billion
in assets.
   K. Peter Maneri, a Texaco spokesman, would not comment on
whether Texaco was engaged in negotiations over Texaco Canada, but
analysts said they suspected the company would not have made the
announcement unless interested parties at least had been identified.
   Maneri would say only that the company has had ``expressions of
interest from buyers in the past.''
   Canadian Occidental Petroleum Ltd., which is 48 percent held by
Occidental Petroleum Corp. of Los Angeles, and Husky Oil Ltd.
previously expressed interest in the Texaco Canada stake and both
said Tuesday they still were interested.
   Icahn, who was defeated in his quest for five seats on Texaco's
board, said in June that he had discussed a Texaco takeover with
Husky and Gulf Canada Resources Ltd.
   Gulf Canada said Tuesday it was interested in acquisitions but
was not aggressively pursuing Texaco Canada at this time.
   Texaco had been studying various options surrounding Texaco
Canada, including the possible sale, merger or joint venture of
some or all of the stake.
   James W. Kinnear, Texaco's president and chief executive
officer, said that ``we have concluded that pursuing negotiations
toward sale of our interest best meets'' the objective of
maximizing Texaco Canada's value to Texaco and its shareholders.
   The company said in a statement it might be interested in
retaining certain Texaco Canada assets, particularly its foreign
exploration ventures with Texaco.
   Texaco Canada owns two refineries and two lubricant blending and
grease-making plants in Canada. The subsidiary has 1,800
Texaco-brand retail outlets across Canada.
   The operation controls 10.4 percent of the Canadian petroleum
products market and 13.5 percent of the gasoline market.
   ``The Canadian operations are clean and neat both from the
production side and from the marketing and refining side,'' said
Jack Aydin, a managing director of the investment firm McDonald &
Co.
   He also said the subsidiary was ``respectably'' profitable.
   Kinnear said in a statement that the possible sale ``would
represent another major advance'' in the company's restructuring
program.
   But Aydin said, ``it looks like they carried the restructuring
plan one step more _ to give shareholders a little bit more ... and
possibly to defuse a potential problem down the road.''
   He was referring to the fact that while Icahn remains Texaco's
largest shareholder, he could sell his 14.9 percent stake and
management might have to confront another dissident shareholder.
   Bruce Lazier, an analyst at Prescott, Ball & Turben Inc., said
it might be possible for a buyer to acquire Icahn's block and then
trade it for shares in Texaco Canada.
   ``Icahn would have to rate right up there in terms of Texaco's
priorities,'' he said.
   Texaco started putting the restructuring program into place in
June, when the company announced it would sell its West German
operations for $1.25 billion to Rheinish-Westfaelisches
Elektrizitaetswerk AG. Also that month, Texaco entered into a $1.28
billion deal to sell 50 percent of its refining and marketing
operations in 23 states to Saudi Arabia.
   The company has said it plans to distribute to shareholders $1.7
billion of the money it raises in the restructuring.
   The keystone of Texaco's restructuring plan was a $3 billion
payment to Pennzoil Co. to settle a lawsuit resulting from Texaco's
1984 acquisition of Getty Oil Co. after Pennzoil had made earlier
moves to acquire Getty.

<HEAD>Study: Securities Industry Fired 15,900 Employees In October-March
Period</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A net 15,900 securities industry employees lost
their jobs in the six months ended March 31, a period that included
the 1987 stock market crash, according to an industry study.
   The joint study published Tuesday was conducted by the
Securities Industry Association and the accounting firm Arthur
Andersen & Co.
   It said about 262,200 employees were employed in the securities
industry as of Sept. 30, 1987, the last benchmark before the Oct.
19 crash. That number dropped to 260,500 employees as of Dec. 31,
1987 and to 246,300 by March 31 of this year.
   Nearly all the dismissals occurred at major brokerage firms and
big investment banks, SIA officials said.
   The 15,900 employees fired between the crash and the end of the
first quarter included about 6,900 stockbrokers and 9,000 support
staff, the study said.
   ``Although the layoffs were painful in human terms, they were a
necessary part of the industry's across-the-board efforts to lower
expenses which were rising out of control, causing diminishing
profit margins and lower returns on investment,'' SIA President
Edward I. O'Brien said in a statement.
   ``The emphasis on measuring productivity is good news for the
securities industry,'' said Lawrence A. Weinbach, chief operating
officer of Arthur Andersen. ``It underscores the increasing focus
on cost control.''
   Before the market plunge, the study said, the brokerage industry
had been hiring employees. The industry added around 2,200
employees between Jan. 1, 1987 and March 31 of this year, nearly
all of them before the October crash.

<HEAD>Mexico Economic Recession Expected Last Half of Year</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRIS ANGELO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After a year of recovery, the Mexican economy
is expected to slide into recession in the last half of 1988 as the
government continues its attempts to curb inflation, private sector
analysts say.
   Although labor leaders dispute the claim, the government says
consumer price inflation slowed from 15.5 percent in January to 2
percent in June under its Economic Solidarity Pact.
   Under the stabilization plan, which comes up for another
extension at the end of August, government, labor, farmers and the
private sector agreed to hold down wages, prices and public
spending and stop the tumbling exchange rate between the peso and
the U.S. dollar.
   But analysts say inflation is unlikely to fall much further this
year.
   In June, the monthly declines bottomed out, due to excess
liquidity, higher-than-usual prices for some perishables because of
unfavorable weather, and the service sector's traditionally slow
response to deflationary processes, according to a report by the
Private Sector Economic Studies Center.
   Private forecasters estimate inflation for the year will range
from 55 percent to 67 percent. After a record 159.2 percent in
1987, the 12-month rate in June was 135.8 percent.
   The government's unofficial target for this year, as of April,
was 46.2 percent.
   Economic growth the last half of 1987 amounted to a 1.6 percent
increase in the gross domestic product for the full year. Growth in
the first half of this year was 2 percent, according to the private
sector center.
   But with contraction the second half, the forecasters, including
the center and the forecasting firm MACRO Asesoria Economica, say
GDP will shrink between 1 percent and 3.3 percent for the year.
   The government-programmed recession for the last six months of
the year is ``one of the most important parts of the economic
policy,'' said Jonathan Heath, coordinating director of MACRO
Asesoria.
   ``It's important to induce the recession so when they start
lifting the freeze prices don't increase,'' he said.
   ``The recessive process the economy will face in the second
semester and perhaps during the first quarter of 1989, despite all
the negative effects that may result, will be an indispensable
condition for consolidating the process of lowering inflation,''
the private sector center's report said.
   ``Policies that avoid it cannot and should not be implemented
since the risk would be an acceleration of inflation,'' it said.
   Assistant Commerce Secretary Jesus Sanchez Jimenez said last
week prices on some basic goods, including eggs and milk, will be
raised in September.
   Heath said the minimum wage, frozen since March, likely will be
increased in September, but probably by no more than 6 percent, an
amount he said most businesses could absorb without raising prices.
   The daily minimum wage increased 3 percent in March to 8,000
pesos, or about $3.50.
   The government is expected to announce its own new spending cuts
soon.
   Under the pact, it has not boosted rates on electricity, water
or other public services. Lower prices for oil exports also have
cut into income, while interest rates on the country's $104 billion
foreign debt, second highest in the developing world, have risen.
   Also cooling the economy in the last half of the year, the
center's report said, will be a tightening of credit and the money
supply, effects of the quick opening of the economy to foreign
competition, price freezes, high interest rates and slowing Mexican
exports.
   Undervaluation of the peso currency helped boost non-petroleum
exports 22 percent in the first half of the year. Holding the peso
steady against the dollar has shrunk that advantage.

<HEAD>Expert Says Korean Labor Problems Knock Wig Market Askew</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For years, Thomas Timm's customers have been
thinning out. Now his suppliers are, too.
   Shrinking ranks of wig manufacturers and other industry problems
have raised the possibility of sharply higher prices and low wig
supplies in coming months, says Timm, owner of Tress-Chic Fashion
Salon in Seattle and part-owner of Reid-Meredith Inc., in Laurence,
Mass., a synthetic hair pioneer and the last remaining U.S. wig
maker.
   Timm, considered an authority on the wig industry, says two of
the six South Korean companies that manufacture 98 percent of the
wigs worn in the United States have gone out of business. The other
four have suffered strikes and the loss of workers to higher-paying
jobs in the garment and electronics industries.
   As a result, hair lines are receding: Timm is worried he may be
unable to acquire enough wigs in enough styles to meet customer
demand in coming months.
   Suppliers also are raising prices, with one distributor having
announced a 45-percent price increase. Timm said that because of
the Korean manufacturing problems, prices of even the cheaper wigs
likely will increase to $85 from $60 each.
   Many of Reid-Meredith's sales are to movie and television
productions _ Timm's customers have ranged from the Muppets to
Raquel Welch _ that can afford more expensive wigs.
   But Timm says many of his salon customers are cancer patients
who have lost hair because of radiation treatments or chemotherapy,
and can not meet the higher prices.
   Furthermore, in response to their labor troubles some Korean
manufacturers have raised their minimum orders from 1,000 wigs to
100,000. Timm said that could drive some smaller distributors out
of business.
   Until the mid-1960s, most wigs were made of human hair. But Timm
said they were expensive, heavy and hard to manage. Then modacrylic
fiber, a synthetic, came along.
   ``We found it in rugs,'' said Timm. ``So the old joke about
someone with a toupee `wearing a rug' wasn't that far off.''
   Reid-Meredith researchers found out how to make modacrylic look
like hair. It also was inexpensive, light, didn't soak up water and
held a permanent wave.
   Wig prices dropped to as little as $19.95. Reid-Meredith was
churning out 1,000 a week, ``and we couldn't fill the pipeline,''
Timm said. ``If we could have made 1,000 a day, we'd have sold them
all. We created a market.''
   ``In the 1960s, we were the largest distributor there was,''
Timm said.
   Then the Japanese, and later the Koreans, got into the business.
Reid-Meredith survived, but was hit hard by foreign competitors
because of their lower labor costs.
   But Timm said Korean wig workers are tiring of six-day work
weeks in what he describes as sweatshop conditions for some of the
lowest wages in their country. Timm expects that within two to
three years, China will be the industry's big-wig.
   In the interim, Reid-Meredith stands to gain. Its wigs, which
sell retail starting at around $110, are becoming more competitive
with the increasingly costly Korean models.
   Timm said U.S. wigs are better made and last longer than the
Korean products.
   ``We've done 100,000 customers in the Seattle area,'' he says.
``You pass them every day, you just don't see them. They're
invisible. The only wigs that look like wigs are the ones that are
poorly done.''

   The dollar rose against all major currencies in
moderate late-morning trading in Europe today.
   Gold prices fell.
   In the absence of any market-moving news, foreign exchange
trading was dominated by technical factors, traders said.
   ``The dollar just broke one technical resistance level after
another,'' one trader said.
   Traders predicted that the dollar soon would soon run into
strong resistance and that the currency would remain locked in a
narrow trading range.
   Fear of possible central bank intervention was keeping a lid on
the currency, dealers said.
   In London, the British pound was quoted at $1.7017, weaker than
$1.7093.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Tuesday's
rates, included: 1.8793 West German marks, up from 1.8760; 1.5655
Swiss francs, up from 1.5635; 6.3370 French francs, up from 6.3265;
2.1181 Dutch guilders, up from 2.1140; 1,385.50 Italian lire, up
from 1,380.75; 1.2069 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2068.
   In Tokyo, where the business day ends before Europe's begins,
the dollar rose 0.45 yen to a closing 132.85 yen. Later, in London,
it was quoted higher at 133.15 yen.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $432.00 a troy ounce,
compared with late Tuesday's $433.00. At midmorning, the city's
five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $431.25.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $431.40, down from $433.00 late
Tuesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $2.70 to close at a bid $433.67.
   Silver, hit by profit-taking, was quoted in London today at a
bid price of $6.76 a troy ounce, down from Tuesday's $6.86.

   The dollar edged up today, while share prices
traded slow and closed lower, ending seven straight daily gains.
   The dollar opened at 132.97 yen and was steady in a narrow range
of 132.83 yen and 133.00 yen before closing at 132.85 yen, up 0.45
yen from Tuesday's close.
   Spot trading totaled $2.721 billion, down from Tuesday's $4.253
billion.
   Meanwhile, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues,
which gained 40.02 points Tuesday to post a record closing high of
28,366.33, was off 17.88 points, or 0.06 percent. It closed at
28,348.45, about midway between the day's high and low.
   Volume in the first section was a thin 800 million shares,
unchanged from Tuesday's total.
   On the stock market, declining issues outnumbered advancers, 444
to 421, with 183 others unchanged.
   Traders said investors were cautious after the Nikkei index set
its record high close Tuesday and that there was little
market-affecting news to offset the general lack of buying interest.
   ``U.S. employment figures, which will be released Friday, will
be a checkpoint for the market,'' said Masahiro Umemori of Nomura
Securities, Japan's largest brokerage.
   The U.S. Labor Department is scheduled to announce July
unemployment figures on Friday.

   Environmental activists, claiming
retailers have been playing ``hide and seek with consumer health,''
said they will try to force stores to post cancer warnings for 225
tobacco products, mostly cigars and pipe tobacco.
   Three environmental groups and Tom Hayden's Campaign California
political organization announced plans Tuesday to file a $1.3
billion lawsuit against eight major retail chains and 27 tobacco
companies, claiming they have failed to adequately warn customers
about risks in the tobacco products.
   They took the action under a ``citizen's suit'' provision of
Proposition 65, a controversial 1986 ballot measure that requires
warnings for a long list of substances believed to cause cancer or
birth defects.
   Proposition 65 allows private parties to sue under its
provisions if prosecutors fail to act after receiving 60 days
notice from the potential plaintiffs.
   David Roe, an attorney for the Environmental Defense Fund, and
Carl Pope of the Sierra Club announced at a news conference that
they were giving that notice. ``If they don't act, we will,'' Roe
said.
   Proposition 65 allows fines of up to $2,500 a day for a
violation. Pope and Roe said the $1.3 billion figure used by their
groups was a ``fairly conservative estimate of the maximum
potential liability'' faced by the chains and tobacco companies.
   Pope said the groups targeted the 225 tobacco products because
they do not carry federally required package warnings like
cigarettes do and have a well-documented cancer risk.
   Leslie Howe, vice president for governmental affairs for the
California Retailers Association, declined to discuss the issue.
``This is the type of thing that attorneys talk to other attorneys
about,'' he said.
   A Tobacco Institute representative in Sacramento did not return
a reporter's phone call.
   But Norman F. Sharp, president of the Cigar Association of
America and the Pipe Tobacco Council, told The New York Times the
tobacco industry took ``great pains'' to comply with the law,
placing advertisements in 58 newspapers across the state and
sending out more than a million notices for retailers to place on
shelves.
   The eight chains targeted by the environmentalists are
Albertson's Inc., the Alpha Beta Co., Lucky Stores Inc., Raley's,
Ralphs Grocery Co., Safeway Stores Inc., Thrifty Drug and Discount
Stores and Vons Grocery Co.
   Roe said group representatives had been in some stores operated
by the chains and had not found warning signs for the tobacco
products.
   Tobacco companies cited by the groups include R.J. Reynolds,
United States Tobacco Co., Consolidated Cigar Co. and General Cigar
Co.

<HEAD>Price Monitoring Committee Meeting Opens</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The price monitoring committee of
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries met today to
discuss the cartel's continuing overproduction and pricing problems.
   The five-nation committee, comprising ministers from Venezuela,
Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia and Algeria, met behind closed
doors at a luxury hotel in this lakeside city.
   Venezuelan oil minister Arturo Hernandez Grisanti said Tuesday
one item on the agenda would be a report by OPEC Secretary-General
Subroto, of Indonesia, on his visit to the United Arab Emirates in
July.
   Subroto visited the U.A.E. after it decided to abandon its OPEC
oil production quota of 948,000 barrels a day and said it would aim
for a daily output of 1.5 million barrels.
   The committee is also to discuss the OPEC auditors' report for
the cartel's production in May, as well as estimates from secondary
sources for June and July production.
   Indonesian oil minister Ginandjar Kartasasmita said Tuesday that
industry estimates for June OPEC production were between
18.54-18.56 million barrels a day, while July production estimates
were understood to be around 19 million barrels a day.
   One OPEC delegate source said ``19 million barrels a day is
definitely too much (for OPEC to be producing). We will never see
prices recover in the short-to-medium term at that level.''
   In a related development, Saudi Arabian oil minister Hisham
Nazer, responding to press reports that his country's oil output in
July was above its OPEC quota, said Wednesday, ``that is wrong.''
He said Saudi Arabia is producing within its output quota of 4.343
million barrels a day.
   The OPEC price committee is empowered to study world oil price
trends, and to call an emergency meeting of the full 13-member OPEC
ministerial conference if it finds that world oil prices have
diverged significantly from OPEC's $18-a-barrel average reference
price.
   Delegate sources said another topic of discussion by the pricing
committee would be the effect on OPEC production levels of a
possible ceasefire between Iran and Iraq.
   The sources said that two opinions have apparently arisen on the
possible effect.
   Some within OPEC believe a ceasefire could result in the two
countries' flooding world oil markets with crude as they try to
sell more oil to finance the reconstruction of their war-torn
economies.
   Others seem to think that an end to the war would mean greater
cooperation within OPEC and lead to production restraint, the
sources said.

<TEXT>
   Willamette Industries Inc. has reached a
tentative settlement with two unions that have been on strike
against it and several other Northwest wood-products companies for
nearly two months.
   The settlement Tuesday was the first since the strike began June
6. It came during the second day of negotiations with a federal
mediator in Portland, said Cathy Baldwin, a company spokeswoman.
   Industry and union officials are optimistic the settlement will
lead to agreements with the other companies, said a source close to
the negotiations who asked not to be named.
   Baldwin said no details of the proposed pact would be released
until the 1,275 striking workers with the Portland-based company
vote on it Thursday.
   ``It was a fair compromise,'' she said.
   Mike Draper, executive secretary of the Western Council of
Industrial Workers, said he was pleased with the contract. ``We
didn't get everything on our wish list, but neither did Willamette
Industries,'' he said.
   The Western Council and the International Woodworkers of
America-U.S. went on strike against Willamette Industries and
several other companies after negotiations broke down. A total of
13 Willamette mills and logging operations were affected in Sweet
Home, Lebanon, Dallas and Albany.
   The strike spread to eight companies with operations in Oregon,
Washington, Idaho, Montana and Northern California, affecting an
estimated 9,000 workers, including those with Willamette Industries.
   Willamette Industries and the other companies had met just once
with the unions during the past two weeks, and each session lasted
less than two hours. The latest negotiations lasted a total of 14
hours Monday and Tuesday, federal mediator Paul Stuckenschneider
said.
   The other companies affected by the strike are Boise Cascade
Corp., Champion International Corp. Simpson Timber Co., DAW Forest
Products Inc., and WI Forest Products Inc. The Western Council also
has struck two smaller companies: Lakeview Lumber Co. and a door
plant operated by Morgan Products Ltd. in Springfield.
   The unions also have threatened to strike Weyerhaeuser Co., the
region's largest wood-products company with 6,000 union members in
Oregon and Washington. Union officials said last week, however,
that the Weyerhaeuser strike plans were on hold.
   The workers have sought restoration of wages and benefits cut in
1986, when the industry was in a recession. The unions accepted the
cuts after a series of strikes.
   Company officials have said they cannot not restore wages and
still compete with smaller, non-union mills. Some of the companies,
however, have offered bonus plans in lieu of wage hikes.
   One union official recently said the unions were willing to
consider a combination of wage increases and bonuses as long as the
wage increases comprised the bulk of the additional compensation.
   Willamette Industries, which employs 8,600 workers overall,
manufactures wood and paper products. Its paper mills have not been
affected by the strike.
   Baldwin said that in the strike's first eight weeks, $1.6
million in wages were lost just in the small town of Sweet Home,
where four mills were shut down.
   In an interview last week, Baldwin said the wood-products
industry had not rebounded as well as officials had hoped it would.
   ``There's no question that we feel our people deserve wage
increases,'' she said. ``But the question is how much?''
   ``I think everyone thought in 1986 when we had to take wage
cuts, that the economic climate would change and would be a lot
more hospitable for the forest-products industry in 1988. That
never happened, however.''

   Share prices were higher at midday Wednesday on
the London Stock Exchange, as speculative trading and positive
sentiment combined to give the market a lift.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was up 9.7
points, or 0.5 percent, at 1,865.2, its best level for the day, at
about 12:30 p.m. local time.
   The British pound's retreat, especially against the West German
mark, had a buoyant effect on shares of export-sensitive companies
and also helped overall market sentiment, dealers said.
   Also showing notable gains were real estate and insurance
company shares.
   The FT-SE 100-share index opened unchanged and then declined
slightly as the market fumbled for direction in early trading. Flat
performances on Wall Street Tuesday and in Tokyo earlier Wednesday
provided little lead for London stocks.
   Trading volume at around midday was 244.8 million shares, up
from 224.4 million at the same time Tuesday.
   Dealers said business was slow with many investment fund
managers away on summer vacations.

<TEXT>
   Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. will realign its
businesses into two divisions, tires and general products, the
company has announced.
   The restructuring announcement came after the close of the stock
market Tuesday. In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Goodyear
fell 25 cents a share to close at $61.87{.
   In addition to making tires, Goodyear manufactures a variety of
rubber, chemical and plastic products.
   Chairman Robert E. Mercer said the reorganization will
streamline the company to be more flexible and responsive to the
changing marketplace.
   ``These two divisions will operate with a high degree of
autonomy and have their own manufacturing, development, financial
staff, materials management and other support functions,'' Mercer
said. ``We're in a position to take further steps to remove layers
of management and reduce overhead.''
   The global tire division will be directed by Jacques Sardas and
the general products division by Hoyt Wells. Each will have the
titles of president and chief operating officer of his division.
   Under the restructuring, manufacturing operations have been
consolidated in the tire and general products operations to create
totally integrated business units, the announcement said.
   Goodyear earned $440 million on sales of $9.9 billion in 1987.

   President Reagan's refusal to embrace a White
House commission's call for federal anti-discrimination laws to
protect AIDS victims brought criticism today from commission
members.
   Rather than embrace the panel's proposal for federal
legislation, Reagan on Tuesday referred the question to the Justice
Department for more study. He did, however, accept most of the
commission's other recommendations and ordered federal agencies not
to discriminate against workers with the AIDS virus.
   ``I think it's a shame that it's being postponed again to make a
serious decision on this matter,'' said committee member Frank
Lilly on ABC-TV's ``Good Morning America.''
   Lilly said a federal law is needed because discrimination exists
even in many states that have similar legislation and because
people will not be tested if they have no guarantee against
discrimination.
   Another commission member, Beny Primm, said on the same program
that the medical community is disappointed that the president ``did
not completely, tightly embrace the complete report.''
   Commission member Katherine Gebbie, interviewed in Portland,
Ore., on NBC-TV's ``Today,'' said she is not satisfied with the
president's position and affirmed that the commission saw the
anti-discrimination recommendation as the cornerstone of its report.
   ``We heard that from so many hundreds of witnesses, that absent
such assured protection clearly nationwide too many people would
not be able to come forward and really cooperate with us in
fighting this epidemic,'' Ms. Gebbie said.
   Reagan's action did not surprise critics of his position on the
AIDS issue.
   ``In a sense, I guess I should have expected this because this
has been the general tenor of this administration,'' Dr. Mervyn
Silverman, a leader of the private American Foundation for AIDS
Research, said Tuesday after Reagan's response.
   The effect of Reagan's action, Silverman said in a telephone
interview, is to scuttle the prospect for the remaining six months
of the administration.
   Vice President George Bush and Massachusetts Gov. Michael
Dukakis, the contenders to succeed Reagan in the Oval Office, both
are on record favoring federal anti-discrimination legislation.
   Health professionals like Silverman say their wish for such laws
is based on the belief that they are essential to fighting the
spread of acquired immune deficiency syndrome by encouraging people
who may be infected with the virus to come forward for testing and
counseling before they infect others.
   Without strong protections against loss of jobs and homes, they
say, the people most likely to test positive for the virus choose
to go untested.
   ``Without the magic bullet ... (of a cure) all we have is the
ability, hopefully, to get people to change behavior, which quite
often is linked to education which quite often is linked to testing
and counseling,'' Silverman said.
   Retired Navy Adm. James D. Watkins, the AIDS commission chairman
who recommended an anti-discrimination law over the opposition of
five of the 13 panel members, sought to put the best face on the
president's refusal to back his stand.
   ``I am pleased that the president has taken this important first
step so necessary to setting the right tone for the nation to deal
with the HIV epidemic,'' said Watkins, vacationing in Canada.
   The White House issued Reagan's statement and he did not appear
before reporters to discuss his 10-point ``action plan,'' which was
a response to 597 recommendations the commission made June 24. Just
after the response was released Tuesday, the president spoke at a
White House ceremony honoring senior executive branch employees.
   Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., said that referring the
anti-discrimination law question to the Justice Department ``is
simply another delaying tactic in a long line of missed
opportunities in the war on AIDS.''
   ``We need active federal leadership against discrimination, not
more delay,'' Kennedy said.
   ``Why are they stalling?'' said Rep. Henry A. Waxman, D-Calif.
``This administration has done its best to avoid making even a
single helpful AIDS decision in the eight years of the Reagan
presidency. They handpick a commission, and then don't even have
the courage to accept its recommendations.''
   ``We don't need another study,'' Waxman said. ``What we need is
leadership, and while (Surgeon General C. Everett) Koop and Admiral
Watkins have given that, once again the president is hiding.''
   In New York, Nan Hunter, director of the AIDS and civil
liberties project of the American Civil Liberties Union, suggested
the president failed to follow the advice of his own commission
because his administration is ``so beholden to its own set of
conservative special interests.''
   ``It seems this White House has opted for vindictiveness over
public health,'' she said.
   Some opponents to federal anti-discrimination laws for AIDS
sufferers argue that such measures would amount to ``gay rights''
legislation because such a large percentage of people infected with
the virus are homosexual.
   The deadly disease is believed to be spreading most rapidly
among intravenous drug users who share needles contaminated with
the HIV virus that causes AIDS, which attacks the body's immune
system and leaves victims vulnerable to a wide variety of
infections and cancers.
   The 10-point White House plan makes no direct reference to
restructured leadership of the federal health bureaucracy.
Moreover, the section on drugs is limited to expressing
presidential concern.
   It said Reagan ``continues his call for bipartisan efforts to
enact his anti-drug proposals.''
   Dr. Donald Ian Macdonald, a special presidential assistant and
director of the White House Drug Abuse Policy Office, was charged
with reviewing the commission's report and formulating the Reagan
response.
   Macdonald said the administration's cautious response to the
commission's call for a drastic increase in drug treatment programs
``to some will seem a bit superficial.''

<HEAD>Philly Exchange `Frustrated' By Copycats</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new investment idea from the Philadelphia
Stock Exchange is being copied in New York and Chicago, according
to exchange officials who say they don't like it.
   ``It's very frustrating,'' says Nicholas Giordano, president of
the Philadelphia exchange, which developed the Cash Index
Participation product and now finds copies being readied for
marketing by larger rivals.
   ``It's frustrating because being right and being better doesn't
always count when you are competing with the (larger) exchanges.''
   CIP was the result of a two-year $1 million study when the
Philadelphia Exchange unveiled it last March and sought Securities
and Exchange approval, which is still pending.
   Now the American Stock Exchange, headquartered in New York, has
come up with a similar Equity Index Participation product and the
Chicago Board Options Exchange has proposed its Value of Index
Participation.
   American came up with its EIP at the end of April and Chicago a
month later.
   The CIP product is a security that represents a bet on the
direction of the overall stock market, actually representing a
share of the value of the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index
although not backed up by any real stocks.
   The buyer has the right to cash in the contract once each
quarter for the cash value of the S&P 500. As proposed to the SEC,
the contracts would sell at one-tenth the value of the S&P index
and the minimum purchase would be 100 contracts.
   There is still confusion as to who should regulate such
investments. The SEC reportedly wants to consider them securities
but the Commodities Futures Trading Commission claims they are
futures contracts, which has raised doubt over who will regulate
them.
   Ivers Riley, senior vice president of the American exchange,
admits his EIP is ``identical'' to the Philadelphia product and
hopes the SEC won't give the Philadelphia product any edge when
selling eventually is approved.
   Riley told The Philadelphia Inquirer that duplication of
services is common in the financial industry.
   ``Being left at the starting gate is the cardinal sin,'' Riley
said.
   Giordano, however, said he ``thought (American) wouldn't engage
in copycat-type endeavors,'' adding his exchange is considering a
copyright infringement lawsuit.
   ``I thought they would be more innovative and come up with their
own products,'' Giordano said.
   The Chicago Board Options Exchange began developing its VIP
product in 1982 but dropped the idea because ``the market wasn't
really ripe for it,'' said CBOE spokesman Warren Moulds.
   Moulds said the CBOE resurrected the VIP after the Philadelphia
Stock Exchange announced plans to launch a similar product. He said
the VIP would compete with the CIP but would have features that
``represent an improvement'' over the Philadelphia product.
   No one is sure how much money the exchanges will make from the
trading index contracts.
   ``This could be one of the biggest successes of all time, or it
may never get off the ground,'' said Giordano. ``There is a
question of whether people are going to like it or not. We have to
go out and market it, educate people and explain how it works.''
   While the battle is still over whether Philadelphia will get an
advantage with an earlier selling start, all three exchanges are
gearing up for a big advertisement campaign.
   ``We'll see what happens,'' Riley said. ``It looks like it's
building up to be a real interesting dogfight.''

<HEAD>Value Line: A System Rather Than a Person</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: CORRECTS 11th graf, The universe ... the lowest., to fix
description of the number of stocks in each category.</NOTE>

   Stock advisory services come and go, beaten and
buried by the vagaries of the marketplace, by the unforgiving test
of time, by the egos and emotions of their founders.
   It is an old story, but with exceptions, and this is about one
of them.
   Value Line, founded during the Great Depression of the 1930s,
persists more than a half-century later as the biggest of all
advisory services, claiming 120,000 individual and institutional
subscribers, most at $495 a year.
   ``It survives because of the system,'' says Samuel Eisenstadt,
who helped devise it.
   The system is influenced little, if at all, by preferences or
notions. Nobody would dare tamper with it or adjust it to suit a
whim. The system is held sacred; it is the founder's legacy.
   Some advisory services rely heavily on the elan of one
individual. But relatively few subscribers knew Arnold Bernhard,
Value Line's founder. He preferred it that way; the system was the
product.
   Thus, when Bernhard died late in 1987 no changes were made in
the service, any more than Ford automobiles were redesigned because
Henry Ford died, or the formula for steel was changed when Andrew
Carnegie passed away.
   The Value Line Investment Survey relies on cross-sectional
analyses of 1,700 stocks _ each measured against others and against
itself over periods of time _ to produce a numerical assessment of
both timeliness and safety.
   While Bernhard, who began the service after losing his job in
1931, worked relentlessly on his system for the first 15 years, it
has changed little since 1946.
   Each stock's timeliness score is determined by a history of
price and earnings for 10 years; price momentum or the recent
action of the stock; earnings momentum; and an earnings surprise
factor.
   The universe of roughly 1,700 stocks is then divided. One
hundred stocks earn a ``1'' or top rating. Three hundred stocks
fall into category 2, more than 800 into category 3, 300 into
category 4 and 100 into ``5,'' the lowest.
   Safety rankings are another matter entirely, determined mainly
by price stability of the stock and other financial factors. Many
stocks earn different ratings for timeliness and safety. A safety
rating of ``1,'' for instance, might be accompanied by a ``3'' for
timeliness.
   Eisenstadt, who inherited Bernhard's title of research chairman,
states that the stocks rated highest for timeliness appreciated
15,400 percent from April 16, 1965, to June 30, 1987, not including
dividends or transactions costs.
   In the same period, he states, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock
average rose 245 percent.
   It is through measurements of this sort, over varying periods of
time, that Value Line claims to be an anomaly, a contradiction of
the efficient market hypothesis, a favorite topic of academics.
   In an efficient market, so goes the thinking, any available
market information is so quickly reflected in stock prices that no
attempt to beat the market can be successful in the long run.
   Value Line claims otherwise. Eisenstadt says the service's
number 1 stock ratings have outperformed market averages for more
than 21 years, showing average annual appreciation of 25.8 percent.
Armed with such data, he has often debated the academics, and
sometimes has won concessions from them.
   While the system uses complex statistical techniques, all the
information is publicly available, if not perhaps easily
accessible. And for those who seek to avoid clutter, the numerical
ratings are amazingly easy to use.
   ``It's a concept even children can understand,'' says Jean
Bernhard Buttner, the founder's daughter and now president and
chief operating officer.
   ``Anyone who can count to five can easily and profitably use the
system.''

<HEAD>New Magazine Making Profit from Hong Kong Brain Drain</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HONG KONG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A bilingual magazine called The Emigrant was
unveiled by publishers seeking to make a profit from the huge
number of people seeking to leave this British colony before China
takes over in 1997.
   Wednesday's launching of the monthly magazine is the latest sign
of the colony's growing ``brain drain'' in which swarms of Hong
Kong's brightest people, pessimistic about the future under Chinese
rule, are moving overseas.
   The government does not keep emigration statistics but the
annual figure is in the tens of thousands, including many business
professionals who meet immigration requirements of countries such
as Australia and Canada.
   Richard Day, publications director of the magazine, told a news
conference that immigration statistics from consulates and
conversations with government officials indicate that more than
50,000 Hong Kong residents would emigrate this year with even more
leaving in 1989.
   The Chinese-English magazine, which costs 20 Hong Kong dollars
an issue, or about $2.50, is not designed to encourage emigration
but merely presents ``unbiased facts'' about topics such as living
abroad permanently, Day said.
   The first issue, which will hit newsstands Monday, has articles
on the overseas real estate market, education counseling,
restaurants in Australia and the method used by Canada to determine
immigration eligibility.

<TEXT>
   Washington's insurance commissioner has
rejected an unfriendly takeover bid for Farmers Insurance Group by
the British conglomerate B.A.T. Industries PLC.
   ``The policyholders could quite possibly lose from the
acquisition, and they do not stand to gain anything from it,''
Commissioner Dick Marquardt said in an order turning down the bid
on Tuesday.
   Marquardt's spokesman Ed Ives said the company was expected to
appeal the decision.
   Washington joins Oregon, Idaho and California in rejecting the
$4.5 billion, or $63 per share, takeover bid. Arizona has approved
the offer, made through B.A.T.'s American subsidiary Batus Inc.
Decisions are pending in Illinois, Ohio, Kansas and Texas.
   The commissioner's ruling followed almost a week of hearings in
Seattle last month.
   Farmers Insurance Co. of Washington, based in Vancouver, and
Farmers New World Life, headquartered on Mercer Island, are
affiliates of Farmers Insurance Group of Los Angeles, which has
rejected the Batus offer.
   The interests of Farmers' policyholders, shareholders and the
general public are best served by Farmers remaining independent,
said Leo E. Denlea Jr., chairman and chief executive officer of
Farmers.
   Farmers is the No. 1 auto insurance company in the state,
writing 17.4 percent of the policies in the market, Marquardt said.
   Marquardt said he did not believe Batus claims that it would not
change Farmers' operations if it was successful in acquiring the
insurance company.
   ``Simply by virtue of the change in control, different
individuals would be in ultimate control of the two Washington
domestic companies,'' the order said. ``Those individuals are bound
to have different ideas about where the companies should be going
and how they should get there.''
   Marquardt said his decision was based partly on the greater
likelihood that Batus would drop non-smoker discounts on auto and
homeowner policies and medical malpractice coverage now offered by
Farmers.
   Batus Vice President Wilson Wyatt said, however, the company
does not plan to change Farmers' operations.
   ``Our sworn testimony was that we have no intention of
discontinuing either smoker or non-smoker discounts or hospital
professional liability policies,'' he said.
   Wyatt said Batus would be able to satisfy Marquardt's concerns.
   Marquardt noted that Batus has substantial holdings in the
tobacco industry _ it owns Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp. _ and
that a takeover would cause ``some degree of tension'' between
sister subsidiaries that could result in canceling the special
rates.
   Should that happen, ``there would cease to be any competition in
those lines of coverage based on the smoker-nonsmoker distinction,
as no other companies offer such a discount in those lines,'' the
order said.

   Yanase and Co., a Japanese dealer of West
German-made Volkswagen automobiles, said it will recall 41,122 of
the vehicles because of defective bulkheads.
   Also on Wednesday, Daihatsu Motor Co. said it will recall 8,928
of its passenger cars because of defective bolts for the fan belt.
   Yanase official Yutaka Nakazato said no accidents had occurred
because of the defect but that the company, after consulting with
the manufacturer Volkswagen AG, decided to recall the Golf model
cars exported to Japan between 1975 and 1981.
   Nakazato said the bulkhead was not strong enough to firmly hold
clutch wires attached to it and could cause trouble in working the
clutch.
   Meanwhile, a Daihatsu official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said the company would recall its Rugger, Rugger Turbo,
Delta 1750 and Delta 1750 Low-Deck models produced between Sept. 1,
1987 and June 1 of this year.
   He said 7,917 of the vehicles to be recalled were exported,
including 2,013 to Britain, 1,257 to West Germany, 991 to Belgium,
926 to Australia and the rest to 76 other countries.
   The Daihatsu official said defective bolts might allow the fan
belt to work loose and cause the engine to overheat.
   He said the company will recall the cars according to the
regulations of each country.

   Deere & Co. and the United Auto Workers
sat down at the bargaining table today to begin negotiating a new
labor contract, 18 months after the end of a bitter 163-day strike.
   UAW President Owen Bieber and union secretary-treasurer Bill
Casstevens shook hands with Hans W. Becherer, Deere president, and
Michael S. Plunkett, a senior vice president, to raise the curtain
on negotiations over a contract to replace the current 20-month
agreement that expires at midnight, Sept. 30.
   The two sides made their initial presentation at the traditional
meeting site of a union hall and will move to a neutral site for
negotiations.
   ``I'm always excited and I'm always optimistic at the start of
talks,'' Bieber said. ``I've been reading analysts' reports that
say Deere has been making money and their stock is going up. It all
looks very encouraging, and they need to recognize the need to
share that with their employees.''
   The talks cover about 13,400 active employees, and 4,000
laid-off workers, at 11 cities in Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota,
Colorado and Georgia. Deere employs about 38,000 employees
worldwide.
   Over the next two months, the bargaining teams will discuss such
issues as restoration of wage cuts, pension increases, job
security, farming-out of work to outside contractors, and worker
retraining.
   The average Deere factory worker makes $15.47 per hour, or
$32,177 annually, and the company calculates its labor costs at
$26.90 per hour, including vacation, bonuses, holidays and other
fringe benefits.
   Before the start of negotiations, spokesmen for both sides
declined specific comment on the issues, saying they would do their
talking behind closed doors at the bargaining table.
   ``Deere & Co. is looking forward to the upcoming meetings with
the UAW. We expect to reach an agreement that satisfies the
requirements of Deere and its UAW-represented employees,'' said G.
Bart Bontems, director of industrial relations for the company.
   ``High priority goals in the bargaining with Deere & Co. will be
to strengthen the security of jobs and incomes of UAW members,''
Bieber said last week.
   Moline-based Deere leads the nation in farm tractor and
agricultural implement manufacturing and is a major competitor in
the industrial equipment market.
   But the company is recovering from a prolonged farm belt
recession and years of labor turmoil including a five-month strike
in 1986-87, the longest in the company's 151-year history.
   The 163-day work stoppage at 13 Deere plants in Illinois, Iowa,
Minneapolis, Georgia, Tennessee and Colorado ended Feb. 1, 1987,
when union workers accepted a wage freeze, a one-time payment of
$735 each and creation of a job protection plan.
   Deere's earnings collapsed and the company racked up $328
million in losses in two years. For the six-year period of 1982-87,
Deere's operating losses totaled $637 million.
   A program of cost cutting, layoffs and a turn-around in the
agricultural sector helped Deere return to the black and analysts
projected earnings of more than $200 million in the 1988 fiscal
year, which ends Oct. 30.
   But Deere's recovery may be stunted by the recent drought which
has slightly stalled sales of farm tractors. The company has
acknowledged isolated cancellations of farm equipment contracts but
stands by its sales projections.

<TEXT>
   Crop futures opened mixed today in cautious
trading on the Chicago Board of Trade amid forecasts for an
increasing chance of showers in the northern Corn Belt.
   Wheat and soybean futures prices gained modestly in early
trading while corn and oats were slightly lower.
   Analysts said that with the increasing likelihood of rain, grain
and soybean traders were unwilling to bet heavily on declining crop
yields and rising prices.
   Nevertheless, analysts said corn and soybean crop conditions
were worsening with each passing day of a scorching heat wave in
the Midwest.
   Temperatures above 90 degrees were expected to continue into the
weekend, and those forecasts ``really do indicate the crop is
deteriorating further, especially the soybean crop,'' said Walter
Spilka, a grain market analyst in New York with Smith Barney,
Harris Upham & Co.
   The wheat market got a boost from reports that China had
purchased 500,000 metric tons of subsidized U.S. wheat, he said.
   In early trading, wheat was 1 cent to 2{ cents higher with the
contract for delivery in September at $3.78 a bushel; corn was }
cent to 2 cents lower with September at $2.99{ a bushel; oats were
3{ cents to 5{ cents lower with September at $2.84 a bushel; and
soybeans were { cent to 7 cents higher with August at $8.36 a
bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were mixed in early trading on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .02 cent lower to .65 cent higher with August
at 65.20 cents a pound; feeder cattle were unchanged to .78 cent
higher with August at 78.05 cents a pound; hogs were .50 cent lower
to .20 cent higher with August at 44.95 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .40 cent lower to .55 cent higher with August at 32.70
cents a pound.
   Livestock and meat futures settled mostly lower on Tuesday.

   Shoppers walking into the Limited store at
Crossgates Mall are being greeted by three mannequins, crisply
attired in tailored suits.
   Is Limited, more often associated with casual wear, going career?
   Not quite. This retailer _ like many other apparel stores _ is
taking on a different look this fall in hopes of reversing a
year-long sales slump.
   Apparel sales began to skid last August as retailers were beset
by two problems: Women rebelled against shorter skirts, and they
were turned off by styles that looked too casual, too bulky and too
much like those of past seasons.
   Fall displays suggest that part of the industry's peace offering
for the fall is to back off on the skirt issue.
   Several of the mannequins at Limited sport below-the-knee
skirts, while down in Manhattan, the windows of high-fashion stores
such as Bloomingdale's, Bergdorf Goodman and Saks Fifth Avenue
showcase a variety of lengths.
   Retailers surveyed customers and test-marketed new designs for
months before coming up with the more tailored and more feminine
clothes showing up in stores for fall.
   The new lines at Crossgates' apparel retailers show the results
of their efforts. The styles on Limited's suited manneent ``sale'' signs.
   Now, said Greenstein, stores must try to wean customers away
from markdowns, which take a heavy toll on profits. ``It will be
very difficult to change that,'' he said.
   Some markdowns are being taken at the start of the season just
to get traffic started, Loeb said.
   Limited is already using the strategy. A sign in the window of
its Crossgates Mall store offers $10 off on any $50 purchase of the
store's fall Outback Red Heritage line, while the $249 suits
featured at the entrance all are marked down $50.
   Wintzer doubted stores would mark down much of their merchandise.
   ``Women have still been paying up for what few items have been
hot,'' he said.
   Markdowns also may be less likely because the retailers, burned
by the large inventories they were stuck with last fall and spring,
have bought very conservatively for the new season. This means
women who don't shop early may find they can't get what they want,
Loeb said.
   ``Retailers are willing to forego reordering hot-selling items
and go to the next line,'' he said, and advised consumers, ``Unless
you rush in now and buy ... you'll find it will be gone.''
   Analysts watch fashions because their success has a direct
effect on retailers' profits _ and most stores saw their earnings
slump during the past year.
   Now, the analysts warn that because last year's results were so
bad, a mediocre performance may look better than it really is.
Wintzer said a retailer would have to chalk up five or six months
of double-digit sales growth for their second half to be considered
good.
   Storeowners likely will tout any sales increase, but ``if it's
just a modest improvement, it's artificial,'' he said.

   Stock prices drifted aimlessly today in a
sluggish summer session.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down about 8 points in
early trading, was up 2.14 at 2,133.36 by noontime on Wall Street.
   Losers slightly outnumbered gainers in the overall tally of New
York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 600 up, 628 down and 515
unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 118.44 million shares at midday,
against 92.70 million at the same point Tuesday.
   Nearly half of that activity was concentrated in a single issue
_ American Electric Power, unchanged at 28}. Analysts said the
heavy trading in the stock stemmed from trading strategies focused
on the company's impending dividend.
   Otherwise, analysts said the market was still beset by concerns
that strong economic growth would prompt further moves by the
Federal Reserve to restrain inflation.
   The Labor Department's monthly report Friday on the employment
situation for July is expected to show continuing robust gains in
payroll employment
   In the credit markets today, prices of long-term government
bonds, which move in the opposite direction from interest rates,
declined slightly.
   Insilco jumped 6\ to 27{ on word that the company's management
is considering a buyout proposal.
   Texaco, trading ex-dividend, rose | to 47{, and Texaco Canada
added \ to 31 on the American Stock Exchange. On Tuesday Texaco
said its 78 percent stake in Texaco Canada was for sale.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
gained .28 to 153.82. At the Amex, the market value index was down
.31 at 306.19.

<TEXT>
   The Chicago & North Western Transportation Co.
said today it expects a strike at midnight, disrupting freight
service in 10 states, despite last-ditch congressional efforts to
avert the strike.
   The Senate approved a joint resolution Tuesday to extend a
cooling-off period in the railroad's dispute with the United
Transportation Union for 36 days until Sept. 9. The House has not
voted on the matter.
   ``We are aware of what the Senate did,'' spokeswoman Leslie
Cleveland said today from C&NW headquarters in Chicago. ``But until
the House takes action, we have to go on the assumption that we're
going to implement our work rules and there will be a strike.''
   The union said it would strike at 12:01 a.m. Thursday if the
company, a subsidiary of the Chicago-based CNW Corp., carries out
its threat to cut the size of its train crews in half and eliminate
hundreds of jobs.
   A walkout not only would disrupt freight service but would halt
operation of C&NW commuter trains which carry more than 40,000
passengers daily in the Chicago area.
   Although House leaders had not scheduled a vote on the
resolution by late morning, Sen. Paul Simon of Illinois was not
ruling out action before the strike deadline, a spokesman for the
Illinois Democrat said today.
   ``Paul has been meeting with Speaker Jim Wright and other key
House members and is still hopeful the House might vote today,''
spokesman David Carle said. ``If not today, then tomorrow.''
   Simon said he introduced the measure ``to see that we avoid what
will hurt everyone _ management, labor and the whole Chicago area.''
   A spokesman for Rep. John Porter, R-Ill., was less optimistic
than Simon, saying the House probably would not act on the bill in
time to prevent a walkout.
   Porter's press aide, Dave Kohn, said the House leadership had
not scheduled action on the bill until Thursday, after the strike
was to begin.
   ``Apparently, the leadership does not want to pre-empt the
union's right to strike,'' Kohn said. But if the House acts on the
bill later Thursday, he said, the strike could be over in a matter
of hours.
   Company officials have already said they expect a strike to
occur, even if the cooling-off period is extended. President Reagan
had imposed an initial 30-day cooling-off period last month.
   ``It definitely appears this is ultimately going to result in a
strike,'' said James Foote, an assistant vice president for
communications of CNW Corp. ``No further discussions were held
(Tuesday with union officials) nor are they planned. We made a
compromise offer yesterday which we thought was extremely
reasonable and which they rejected.''
   Foote said the company was disappointed by the Senate action.
   The railroad, which has 8,000 employees, originally proposed
cutting most of its four-person train crews in half to save $51
million a year.
   The presidential emergency board proposed eliminating 700
brakemen jobs instead of the 1,150 cuts planned. Management
accepted that proposal Monday, but union officials have rejected
the offer.
   The railroad has said it plans to continue its freight
operations _ which are 95 percent of its business _ in case of a
strike, but expects at least some temporary disruptions.
   Foote has estimated that the company could operate enough trains
to generate 80 percent of its normal revenue on the first day of a
strike.

<HEAD>Early Aluminum Contract Talks Set</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two major unions will be looking for a share
of the aluminum industry's profits next week when they open early
negotiations to replace contracts that expire 10 months from now.
   The current two-year pacts with the United Steelworkers of
America and the Aluminum, Brick and Glass Workers International
Union lowered benefits by 95 cents per hour for their members at
Aluminum Company of America and Reynolds Metals Co.
   ``When we negotiated the current contracts in 1986, our members
made sacrifices to help the companies over hard time,'' said George
Becker, internatinal vice president of the USW. ``Now that these
companies are profitable again, our members deserve to share in
those gains and recover the sacrifices they made.''
   Becker, who chairs the union's aluminum industry conference, was
quoted in the USW publication ``Steelabor.''
   Pittsburgh-based Alcoa, the nation's largest aluminum producer,
reported profits of $200.1 million, or $2.25 per share, on sales of
$7.77 billion for all of 1987 and profits of $416.3 million, or
$4.71 per share, on sales of $4.59 billion in the first six months
of this year.
   Reynolds of Richmond, Va., reported 1987 net earnings of $219.5
million, or $4.33 per share, on sales of $4.32 billion and net
earnings of $204.9 million, or $3.84 per share, on revenue of $2.65
billion in the 1988 first half.
   The contract talks are scheduled to begin Aug. 8 in Cincinnati.
The two unions will conduct concurrent but separate negotiations.
Their contracts expire May 31, 1989.
   The USW said it represents more than 6,000 Alcoa workers at nine
locations in the United States and approximately 4,000 Reynolds
workers at 21 locations in the United States and Canada.
   The ABGWU represents between 6,000 and 7,000 Alcoa workers and
an estimated 4,700 Reynolds workers.

   Business Week's printer fired two more workers
today and a third printing employee resigned in connection with the
widening scandal into possibly illegal trading based on leaked
stock tips from the magazine.
   The disciplinary moves by printing giant R.R. Donnelley & Sons
Co. of Chicago came the same day as the Connecticut brokerage
Advest Inc. announced a broker it had suspended because of the
scandal resigned.
   In addition, the U.S. attorney for Connecticut confirmed he had
initiated an inquiry into a network of brokers and printing
employees who used purloined Business Week stock-touting ``Inside
Wall Street'' columns to trade, the first criminal investigation of
the scandal since it surfaced two weeks ago.
   Donnelley, one of the nation's largerst printers, said it had
fired a previously suspended employee at its Torrance, Calif.,
plant and fired another employee at its facility in Old Saybrook,
Conn., where a production worker had been dismissed earlier this
week.
   The company also said a Torrance worker had resigned in
connection with its investigation into the leaks.
   ``This is not the way we do business,'' John R. Walter,
president of the company, said in a press statement. ``We have a
long, proud tradition of protecting our customers' materials.
Though a few employees violated the rules, we continue to have
confidence in our more than 23,000 other employees.''
   Nevertheless, he said the investigation was continuing and any
others found to have violated the company's confidentiality rules
would be dealt with severely.
   The company declined to identify any of the affected employees.
   Earlier today in Hartford, Conn., Advest spokeswoman Martha
Payne announced the resignation of suspended broker Thomas Griffin,
who had worked at Advest's office in New London, Conn.
   That resignation brought to three the number of investment
professionals who have been forced out as a result of queries into
suspicious Business Week-related trading.
   Ms. Payne said Griffin, who had been with the firm for five
months, ``tendered his immediate resignation as of late yesterday.''
   She would not disclose whether Griffin admitted involvement in
the scandal but said he previously had been employed by the
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. office in Old Saybrook.
   Griffin was not in the New London office today and he did not
return messages left on his home telephone answering machine.
Griffin's attorney, S.W. Bromson, was out of the office, his
secretary said.
   Ms. Payne said no other Advest brokers were under scrutiny but
she said the firm was continuing to investigate the suspicious
trading.
   Hartford U.S. Attorney Stanley Twardy Jr., meanwhile, confirmed
he had asked the FBI to investigate ``any possible wrongdoing in
Connecticut in connection with this matter.'' He declined to
elaborate.
   The developments today came two days after Donnelley fired a
production worker at the Old Saybrook plant for selling copies of
Business Week to William Dillon, a Merrill Lynch broker who was
fired last week.
   People familiar with the investigation have said Dillon bought
them for as little as $20 each and used the information to make
profits of $2,000 a week or more.
   Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. also has dismissed a broker in
connection with the scandal, Brian Callahan, from its office in
Anaheim, Calif., not far from Donnelley's Torrance plant.
   At least nine securities firms have become enmeshed in the
scandal, which first surfaced July 21 when Business Week, the
nation's leading business weekly with a circulation of nearly 1
million, disclosed it was investigating suspicious trading of
stocks mentioned in ``Inside Wall Street'' before the magazine was
publicly available.
   The Securities and Exchange Commission and the nation's major
stock exchanges also are probing trades of stocks mentioned in the
column. Such activity is regarded as fraud under federal securities
laws.
   A report in the New York Times today quoted unidentified sources
as saying an unnamed California investor who reportedly holds seven
trading accounts at varying brokerages is under investigation in
the scandal as well. That report could not be immediately confirmed.

   A unit of General Electric Co. will form a
Japanese-based joint venture in plastics with two Japanese
partners, Mitsui Petrochemical Industries Ltd. and Nagase and Co.
Ltd., the companies said Wednesday.
   The effort is described as a restructuring move to improve
existing ties between the three partners.
   The new entity will be called GE Plastics Japan Ltd. and will
focus on the manufacture of polycarbonate resin through the
construction of a Japanese plant with a productive capacity of
40,000 tons per year.
   GE Plastics (U.S.A.) will hold a 51 percent stake in the
venture, with Mitsui and Nagase accounting for 24.5 percent each.
Full operations are expected to start in early 1991.
   Polycarbonate resin is used to make car vehicle components,
compact disks, safety equipment and a host of other products.

   The first word came in a Japanese financial
newspaper in January: Hiroshi Maeda of the University of Tokyo had
found a superconductor that broke all previous temperature records.
   While legions of physicists struggled to decipher the Japanese
and to duplicate Maeda's feat, two newcomers at the University of
Arkansas announced they had smashed his record.
   A few days later, IBM scientists fiddling with the Arkansas
superconductor in San Jose, Calif., hit a high-temperature mark
that still stands.
   All the pandemonium began with the January 1986 discovery by two
IBM scientists in Zurich, Switzerland, that a complicated mixture
of lanthanum, barium, copper and oxygen could carry electricity
with no resistance at 396 degrees below zero Fahrenheit.
   In the exotic landscape of physics, that was terribly warm.
Before the ``Zurich oxide,'' as it's sometimes called,
superconductors worked only at temperatures colder than minus 418
degrees, about 42 degrees above absolute zero.
   The IBM discovery impressed the Stockholm crowd. The scientists,
K. Alex Mueller and J. Georg Bednorz, received the 1987 Nobel Prize
_ one of the fastest on record.
   Superconductivity almost seems to violate nature's laws. When
electricity passes through ordinary conductors, some is inevitably
converted into heat. Sometimes a lot of it _ as in your toaster.
   But not in superconductors. They carry electricity with no
resistance _ and no heat loss. None.
   That's more than a scientist's idea of a parlor trick. These
brittle ceramic metals could lead to zero-resistance electric power
lines, exotic energy storage devices and other wonders. And no
story on superconductivity would be complete without a mention of
super-fast trains magnetically levitated over superconducting rails.
   The truth is, no one is quite sure where and when
superconductors will turn up outside physics labs. Economists may
be better forecasters than physicists.
   Mag-lev trains might work in lab tests, but who will pay to
build them? Are utilities going to rip out serviceable power lines
to put up superconductors? Not if they have to double or triple
your electric bill to pay for it.
   President Reagan told a conference last year, ``There are
predictions of high-speed trains levitated above their tracks,
supercomputers on a single silicon chip, cheaper and more effective
medical imaging devices.''
   Reagan said it's ``our business to discover ways to turn our
dreams into history as soon as possible,'' but he won't foot the
bill, either. The National Science Foundation budget for
condensed-matter physics, which includes superconductivity, is
$37.2 million this year, up just 0.5 percent.
   Such worldly concerns aside, physicists are silly with
excitement.
   ``Somebody described scientists like pigeons,'' said Brian
Schwartz, a physicist at Brooklyn College of the City University of
New York. ``You throw bread here and everybody pecks here. Then you
throw bread over there and everybody pecks there.''
   The record holders are the IBM researchers, led by Paul Grant,
who pushed the threshhold to 234 degrees below zero Fahrenheit.
   Grant and company surpassed the report by Maeda of
superconductivity onset at minus 243 degrees. Maeda started with
copper oxide _ or copper and oxygen, the common denominators in
nearly all the new superconductors _ and added bismuth, strontium
and calcium.
   Earlier compounds had contained yttrium instead of bismuth.
Physicists soon were wearing buttons that read ``Sell yttrium _ buy
bismuth.''
   ``The last 18 months have been the most exciting in my life,''
Grant said at the March meeting of the American Physical Society in
New Orleans a year after the so-called ``Woodstock of physics'' in
New York.
   That was when most physicists got their first reports on the new
superconductors. ``That was a once-in-a-lifetime event. It was
incredible. Incredible. What else can I say?'' said Grant, echoing
others who were there.
   A ``Woodstock II'' session was held this year, with late reports
on the superconductors discovered in Tokyo and Arkansas.
   One of the stars was Arkansas' Allen Hermann. He and Zhengzhi
Sheng discovered the thallium-barium-copper-oxygen superconductor
(to which they later added calcium) that holds the high temperature
record set by Grant.
   Hermann and Sheng reported superconductivity at minus 238
degrees, earning them a momentary record until Grant pushed their
compound further. They since have matched his mark.
   How high the temperature record will go is anybody's guess.
Scattered reports of superconductivity at room temperature haven't
been confirmed, but many researchers believe room-temperature
superconductivity may be possible.
   Not all the action is in the glamorous search for new
superconductors and the race for higher temperatures, however.
Theorists _ the armchair physicists whose job is to think, not to
concoct _ think they are beginning to understand how the new
superconductors work.
   The key seems to be the arrangement of the copper oxide.
Electron microscopes have shown that the copper and oxygen atoms
arrange themselves in planes. The other elements serve as spacers,
sandwiched between the planes.
   In some compounds, each plane is separated from its neighbors.
In others the planes are paired, and in the newest the planes occur
in threes.
   The more planes, the higher the temperature at which
superconductivity occurs. At the moment, that's a mere observation.
   ``If we can go to four layers, we should be able to go to higher
transition temperatures,'' said Robert Hazen of the Geophysical
Laboratory of the Carnegie Institution of Washington, D.C.
   The next question to be addressed is why it should be so, but
physicists at last have a direction to go that's more than hunch,
which is how they got where they are. Anyone can do it: Melt a few
elements together, let the stew harden, cool it to frigid
temperatures and see what happens.
   Hazen calls that ``shake and bake'' science, or ``cook and
look.''
   Of course, not everything is as simple as stacking planes. Just
when physicists had become comfortable thinking about planes, a
superconductor with no stacked planes was discovered. The mixture
of potassium, barium, bismuth and oxygen became superconducting at
about 406 degrees below zero, according to its discoverers at
AT&T's Bell Laboratories.
   It's not a contender in the high-temperature race. But Paul
Fleury, one of the discoverers, said, ``There's a whole new
ballfield that's opened up now.''
   On another ballfield, Stuart Wolf of the Naval Research
Laboratory in Washington, D.C., has produced a
lanthanum-copper-oxygen superconductor with a simpler structure,
but similar to the other copper-containing superconductors.
   It's a kind of superconductor building block, and Wolf believes
it's a contender. He thinks it could go superconducting at higher
temperatures than Hermann's thallium mix, and he's out to prove it.
   His first tests show superconductivity at minus 280 degrees
Fahrenheit, but he's betting he can reach a toasty 100 degrees
below zero.
   There is a catch. Wolf's simple superconductor isn't simple to
make. It must be cooked at 2,700 degrees Fahrenheit and squeezed at
65,000 times normal atmospheric pressure. Fortunately for Wolf,
once the material is made it can be cooled and studied at normal
temperatures and pressures.
   ``Nature's been kind _ it's done something we never expected,''
said Schwartz. ``We never thought we'd be operating at these
temperatures in our lifetime _ or ever.''

   A series of stock scandals has prompted the
government to hasten its control over insider trading in Japan,
where privileged information has been a traditional feature of the
securities trade.
   Finance Ministry officials said Wednesday a new law giving
authorities greater investigatory and surveillance powers over
stock deals could be gradually implemented as early as this month.
   Criminal punishment clauses will take effect next April,
officials in the ministry's Securities Bureau said. The measures
were to be implemented in gradual steps beginning Nov. 1.
   Although the officials gave no reasons for moving up enactment
of the Revised Securities and Exchange Law _ Japan's first to
directly address insider trading _ securities and legal experts
said growing public attention on recent stock scandals spurred the
decision.
   The most famous of these, ``Recruit-Gate,'' has been the subject
of intense parliamentary debate in recent days. Aides to top
politicians including Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita reportedly
bought shares of the Recruit-Cosmos real estate firm before public
trading began and made substantial profits when prices rose later.
   There is wide skepticism about any real impact the new
legislation may have on insider trading, which experts describe as
common in Japanese stock dealings.
   Brokers routinely advise clients on stock deals based on inside
information and frequently use the information in their own
transactions. Companies inform corporate shareholders in advance
about announcements that may affect share prices in order to
maintain good business relations.
   ``I can't say the new law will have an overnight impact on ...
insider trading in Japan, where most stock dealings are more or
less based on inside information,'' said Keisuke Matsuura, a
private investor who has followed the Tokyo stock market for more
than 30 years.
   ``But at least people who are unconsciously indulging in insider
trading today won't be able to get away by saying, `Gee, I didn't
know it was insider trading' after the law is implemented,'' he
said.
   Legal experts expressed concern about the government's
involvement in investigating and monitoring stock deals.
   ``The Finance Ministry is not an independent body like the
Securities and Exchange Commission in the United States, which is
free from all political obligations, and there is no guarantee its
regulation won't be affected by political interests,'' said Hiroshi
Itakura, a criminal law professor at Nihon University.
   ``We can probably expect the ministry to pinpoint minor insider
trading cases, but I can't believe it would attack cases involving
top politicians.''
   Experts said securities regulatory authorities _ the Finance
Ministry and the Tokyo Stock Exchange _ need the greater
investigatory and surveillance functions, even if only to send a
message.
   The Tokyo stock market has been rocked by a series of scandals
in recent months. Despite public outcry for stringent measures to
regulate insider trading, the Finance Ministry has not been able to
bring criminal charges against players in any of the controversies.
   Between October 1986 and September 1987, the Tokyo exchange's
Dealing Review Section investigated 252 transactions it deemed
suspicious, but failed to prove any criminal wrongdoing.
   The move toward tougher controls was spawned last September. In
a widely publicized case, an Osaka-based bank sold large stock
holdings in a chemical company shortly before it was announced the
company had suffered huge losses in stock speculations. No criminal
punishment was meted out despite the disclosure that the Hyogo Sogo
Bank knew about the losses in advance.
   At the urging of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission,
the Finance Ministry in February agreed to implement stiffer laws
to control fraudulent stock activities.
   SEC chairman David Ruder, who was visiting Tokyo in February,
said then the legislation covered ``98 percent of what the U.S. law
covers.'' Parliament approved it in May and it was slated for
gradual enactment beginning in November.
   Revelations of the Recruit-Cosmos deals broke early this summer
and quickly escalated into a scandal. And while Parliament debated
the ethical aspects of that case last week, stock watchers noted
the share price of the Tokyo precision machinery firm Sankyo Seiki
skyrocketed shortly before the announcement of its corporate tie-up
with Nippon Steel Co.
   Experts said there was a leak, but Tokyo Stock Exchange chairman
Michio Takeuchi said it will be difficult to verify wrongdoing.
Kyodo News Service reported Wednesday that exchange officials
strongly suspected ``questionable transactions'' took place.
   Finance Ministry officials said they were awaiting the results
of the exchange's probe and would take appropriate measures.

   Share prices closed broadly higher Wednesday on
the London Stock Exchange, as dealers reported the reemergence of
some long-awaited institutional buying interest in the leading
British stocks.
   Trading volume, which has been concentrated in a few speculative
stocks in recent sessions, was more broadly based, dealers said.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index rose 9.6
points, or 0.5 percent, to close at 1,865.1 after rising as much as
10.9 points in the early afternoon.
   Volume was 416.1 million shares, up from 376.5 million shares a
day earlier.
   Dealers said the market was lifted by some good institutional
buying interest in the major 100-share index stocks.
   ``It's the first time for days that we've seen a bit of trading
volume,'' one dealer said. ``Institutions are bidding for the big
international stocks.''
   But the other major markets again failed to provide direction to
London stocks. On the New York Stock Exchange, the Dow Jones
industrial average was up 5.69 points at 2,136.91 soon after the
London market closed. In Tokyo, the Nikkei index fell 17.88 to
28,348.45 earlier Wednesday.
   In London, the Financial Times 30-share index rose 10.6 points
to 1,502.0. The Financial Times 500-share index rose 5.78 points to
1,064.28.

   The top negotiator for the striking film and
TV scriptwriters was expected to recommend approval of the
producers' latest offer, proposed today after all-night talks, a
union bargainer said.
   Writers Guild of America chief negotiator Brian Walton was to
present the contract to the union's full negotiating committee. A
favorable vote could effectively end the strike that has paralyzed
the entertainment industry for 22 weeks.
   ``It's my expectation that he is going to recommend that we go
with this,'' said Arthur Sellers, a member of the WGA negotiating
committee.
   There was no immediate word on the contents of the proposed
contract.
   Formal approval would require a vote by the full membership of
the union. Membership meetings, which require a 48-hour advance
notification, could be held as early as Friday with the vote tally
announced the following day.
   A highly placed guild source, speaking on condition of
anonymity, confirmed that Walton was expected to recommend approval.
   The committee planned to meet with Alliance of Motion Picture
and Television Producers representatives an hour later, and a WGA
board meeting was scheduled for later today at guild headquarters
in West Hollywood.
   The 9,000 film and TV scriptwriters went on strike March 7 over
payments for reruns and syndication of TV shows.
   The strike cut short last year's TV season and suspended
production of countless series and movies. It has forced the
networks to scramble to fill their fall lineups with specials,
movies and remakes of old series.
   Asked if a settlement was possible as he left the all-night
bargaining session about 6:30 a.m., Walton said: ``It's possible.
It's always been possible.''
   ``I'm not unhappy with what happened tonight. We'll just see
what happens when we come back,'' Walton added.
   Alliance spokesman Herb Steinberg and WGA President George Kirgo
did not immediately return calls seeking comment.
   The two sides adjourned this morning after holding informal
talks for more than 12 hours at alliance headquarters in Sherman
Oaks.
   The 21-member dissident Writers Coalition, which has threatened
to break from the guild to return to work, announced it will honor
the walkout but will again consider resigning if the strike
continues past this week, spokesman Lionel Chetwynd said.
   Barry Diller, head of 20th Century Fox, said his studio will pay
any union fines incurred by striking scriptwriters who cross picket
lines.
   Guild fines against strike-breaking writers are set at 110
percent of all compensation received for unauthorized strike work,
and violators are subject to lifetime expulsion from the guild, Ms.
Rhoden said.

<HEAD>Eastern Flight Attendants Offer Plan to Save Jobs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PATRICK REYNA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Flight attendants at Eastern Airlines fighting to
save more than 1,000 jobs on Wednesday proposed a two-tiered,
work-reduction scheme they say would save Eastern $15 million
annually and let them stay on the carrier's payroll.
   Mary Jane Barry, president of the Transport Workers Union's
Miami branch, said a survey of 1,000 Eastern flight attendants
showed that senior attendants were willing to share weekly work
schedules, cutting their working time _ and pay _ in half.
   Hundreds of others, Ms. Barry said, would accept long-term
leaves from active service while remaining employees of the
financially troubled airline, which is a subsidiary of giant Texas
Air Corp.
   ``The (union) was excited about the plan we had developed,'' she
said, adding: ``Our plan could enable (Eastern) to avoid laying off
one single flight attendant.''
   Ms. Barry said similar programs have operated successfully at
other airlines _ including Pan Am, American, Republic and Ozark _
since the early 1980s.
   The Transport Workers' proposal came 10 days after Eastern
President Phil Bakes announced that the airline would eliminate
4,000 jobs and cut service to 14 cities in a move to bring the
carrier back into the black.
   The labor plan also came a week after Eastern management
rejected a similar proposal from the flight attendants for massive
long-leave agreements.
   ``Mr. Bakes would rather lay off the 1,000 flight attendants
than save millions at Eastern,'' Ms. Barry told a news conference.
   Eastern had a net operating loss of $182 million last year, and
the job cuts, if carried out, would bring the airline's total staff
to 29,521, down sharply from the 43,308 people employed by the
carrier in September 1986.
   Ms. Barry said the union filed a suit Tuesday seeking a
temporary restraining order to block Eastern's layoff proposal.
   On July 28, the Machinists union, which represents about 12,000
Eastern employees, filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court in
Washington seeking a preliminary injunction or a temporary
restraining order against the planned layoffs.
   Charles Bryan, president of the Machinists' local in Miami, said
management's proposed cutbacks ``will significantly increase
(Eastern's) recurring losses and lead to the ultimate destruction
of the carrier.''
   Bryan charged that Eastern was in violation of the Railway Labor
Act with the layoff plan, asserting that the program amounted to
``an act of self-help'' for Texas Air.
   The Eastern cutbacks, he argued, would benefit Continental
Airlines, another Texas Air subsidiary.
   According to Bakes, the cutbacks were unavoidable because of
Eastern's losses.
   ``In essence, '' he said, ``Eastern is returning to its basic
roots in an attempt to regain strength in the marketplace.''
   Under the management proposal, Eastern would concentrate on its
service to Boston, New York, Washington, Atlanta and Miami,
dropping Kansas City, Mo., as its western hub.

   Grain and soybean futures closed mixed Wednesday
on the Chicago Board of Trade as fears of rain offset the bullish
impact of the crop-wilting heat hovering over the Farm Belt.
   Wheat finished higher, soybeans were mixed and corn and oats
closed mostly lower.
   ``The market is still trying to sort itself out over the fact
that the weather has been pretty severe this week,'' said Ted Mao,
grain specialist in New York with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   Analysts said crop conditions were deteriorating because of the
intense, dry heat but mixed weather forecasts made traders were
unwilling to bet heavily on declining crop yields and higher prices.
   ``I can find you any forecast you want, from a good rain outlook
over the next 24 to 48 hours to a poor rain outlook,'' Mao said.
``It's all a matter of individual meteorologists' interpretations
of computer models.''
   Wheat prices advanced on news that China had purchased 500,000
metric tons of subsidized U.S. wheat, analysts said.
   At the close, wheat was 1 cent to 5{ cents higher with the
contract for delivery in September at $3.81 a bushel; corn was 3
cents lower to 1{ cents higher with September at $2.98 a bushel;
oats were 5\ cents to 7 cents lower with September at $2.83{ a
bushel; and soybeans were 5 cents lower to 7 cents higher with
August at $8.36 a bushel.

   Drought-damaged grain harvests in the United
States, Canada and China will produce the steepest one-year drop in
world grain stocks ever recorded, a private research organization
predicted Wednesday.
   The Worldwatch Institute said the drought will reduce the U.S.
grain harvest this year by about 78 million metric tons from 1987,
with damage to Canada's crop adding 11 million tons to the decline.
   In China, which ranks a close second to the United States as a
food producer, severe drought conditions could reduce the grain
harvest by 30 million tons, the report said.
   Even with offsetting harvest increases in India, the Soviet
Union and the European continent of about 45 million tons, the
world grain harvest could drop by 74 million tons below output for
1987, which was 85 million tons below the preceding year.
   Carryover grain stocks at the end of 1988 _ total supplies
remaining when the new harvest comes in _ could fall to 54 days of
world consumption, the institute said. This would be lower than the
57-day level that more than doubled world grain prices in 1973, it
said.
   ``The lack of rainfall is contributing to what will almost
certainly become the steepest one-year drop in world grain stocks
ever recorded,'' said the report written by institute president
Lester R. Brown, a former administrator of the Agriculture
Department's International Agricultural Development Service.
   Brown said the drought damage coincides with a marked slowdown
in world grain production attributed to depressed grain prices,
land shortages, soil erosion, scarcity of fresh water and the lack
of new technologies for boosting output.
   He said growth in food production has fallen behind population
growth in Africa and Latin America, the two continents with the
fastest population increases.
   ``Future improvements in the world food prospect depend on
reversing land degradation and putting the brakes on population
growth,'' Brown wrote.
   ``Without a massive reordering of priorities that will restore
soils and slow the population growth that is already outstripping
food production on two continents, food scarcity and higher food
prices may well dominate the Nineties,'' he said.

   International Business Machines Corp. committed
itself Wednesday to achieving market leadership in workstations,
the speedier siblings of personal computers that make up one of the
fastest-growing parts of the computer business.
   ``Our strategy hasn't been competitive. Today it is. Our
objective is to be the leader in the industry for workstations by
1991,'' IBM spokeswoman Linda Dezan said.
   Ms. Dezan's comments, based on the official IBM position, were
an expansion of remarks by IBM executive Arthur G. Goldberg that
were quoted in Wednesday's editions of the Wall Street Journal.
   Workstations are expensive desktop computers that are typically
used for work that requires intensive manipulation of numbers or
sophisticated graphics, such as science, engineering, design and
financial modeling.
   IBM's RT workstation was widely faulted for being underpowered
and lacking in software when it was introduced in early 1986, and
sales lagged badly. But Ms. Dezan said IBM has steadily added
software while doubling the performance of the RT every 12 to 18
months.
   IBM had 3.9 percent of the worldwide market for workstations
used for science and engineering last year, trailing Sun
Microsystems Inc.'s 29 percent share, Apollo Computer Inc.'s 21
percent, Digital Equipment Corp.'s 20 percent and Hewlett-Packard
Co.'s 12 percent, according to International Data Corp.
   Those numbers understate the RT's popularity because they focus
only on machines used for science and engineering. About half the
RTs sold are used for general corporate business.
   Goldberg said a version of the RT that will be available
relatively soon will be at least twice as fast as current models
for general-purpose computing and many times as fast for
engineering and design work.
   IBM has devoted a huge effort to improving the RT because
workstations are a booming segment of the computer industry, with
industrywide sales growing 30 percent a year.
   June was the best month yet for RT sales because of improvements
already made in the product, IBM says. The RT will get another
boost from the $3.6 billion contract IBM recently won from the
Federal Aviation Administration for an air-traffic-control system.
That system will be largely based on the RT and will include 12,000
to 15,000 RTs.
   ``We have been experiencing much more success with the RT than
we've generally been given credit for,'' Ms. Dezan said.
   IBM says it is spending as much money on development of RT
hardware as on hardware for its huge personal computer business. In
addition, it is increasing the number of marketing people for the
RT ten-fold, to at least 300.

   Four more people lost their jobs Wednesday
because of suspected insider trading on swiped tips from
unpublished copies of Business Week, and a U.S. attorney announced
the first criminal probe into the scandal. R.R. Donnelley & Sons
Co., one of the companies that prints the business weekly, said it
fired two workers and another quit. The investment firm Advest Inc.
said a broker suspended because of Business Week-linked trading
resigned.
   The developments raised to seven the list of brokers and
printers forced out of their jobs because of the scandal, in which
an undetermined number of people traded stocks based on stolen tips
from the business magazine's ``Inside Wall Street'' stock-touting
column prior to publication.
   Buying and selling stocks based on information unavailable to
everyone is commonly referred to as insider trading and is
considered fraud under federal securities laws.
   Donnelley said it fired a previously suspended employee at its
plant in Torrance, Calif., and another worker there resigned. The
company also said it fired a second worker at a printing plant in
Old Saybrook, Conn., where a production employee was dismissed
earlier this week.
   ``This is not the way we do business,'' John R. Walter,
Donnelley president, said in a statement from the company's
headquarters in Chicago.
   ``We have a long, proud tradition of protecting our customers'
materials,'' he said. ``Although a few employees have violated our
rules, we continue to have confidence in our more than 23,000
Donnelley employees. We are continuing our investigate and we will
deal severely with any individuals involved.''
   Donnelley officials declined to name the employees affected in
the latest action, but confirmed the identity of the Old Saybrook
worker fired earlier as William Rady, who was said to live in the
New London area. Directory assistance said there was no residential
telephone listing under that name.
   The printing company has said it is considering unspecified
legal action against the disciplined workers.
   Evidence uncovered so far in the scandal suggests some printers
distributed or peddled unpublished copies of Business Week to
brokers, who bought stocks recommended by ``Inside Wall Street''
and sold them later at a profit, after publication had attracted
more buyers and raised the price of the stocks.
   Stanley Twardy Jr., the U.S. attorney in Hartford, Conn., said
he had asked the FBI to investigate ``any possible wrongdoing in
Connecticut in connection with this matter.'' He declined to
elaborate on the nature or scope of the probe, the first criminal
inquiry since the scandal surfaced late last month.
   Last week Merrill Lynch & Co. fired a broker from its New
London, Conn., office, near Donnelley's Old Saybrook plant, and
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. fired a broker from its Anaheim,
Calif., branch, near the Torrance plant. Merrill Lynch also is
investigating a second broker.
   Advest spokeswoman Martha Payne said Wednesday that broker
Thomas Griffin, who had worked at the firm's New London office and
was suspended last week, had resigned.
   She would not disclose whether Griffin admitted involvement in
the scandal but said he previously had been employed at the
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. office in Old Saybrook.
   Griffin was not in the New London office Wednesday and he did
not return messages left on his home telephone answering machine.
Griffin's attorney, S.W. Bromson, was said to be out of the office
and did not return messages.
   Ms. Payne said no other Advest brokers were under scrutiny but
she said the firm was continuing to investigate the suspicious
trading.
   At least nine investment firms have undertaken internal
inquiries into trading possibly connected to the purloined tips and
are known to be cooperating with a Securities and Exchange
Commission probe of the scandal.
   In addition, there have been unconfirmed reports that up to two
dozen investment firms are involved.
   The scandal surfaced when Business Week, the nation's leading
business weekly with a circulation of nearly 1 million, disclosed
July 21 that it had long suspected prepublication misuse of
``Inside Wall Street'' tips.
   The magazine has been criticized for failing to tell the SEC or
the major stock exchanges about the suspicions earlier. Business
Week officials have said they were seeking definitive evidence
before alerting regulatory authorities.

<TEXT>
   Late July car sales rose at Ford Motor Co. and
Chrysler Corp. but slipped at General Motors Corp., the automakers
reported Wednesday.
   Ford sold 70,857 cars in nine selling days from July 21-31,
compared with 72,443 in 10 selling days in the comparable 1987
period, for a daily sales increase of 8.7 percent.
   Chrysler sold 32,498 cars in the same period, up from 30,865 a
year earlier, amounting to a 17 percent jump in daily sales.
   GM car sales of 114,789 compared with 130,696 sold in the
year-earlier period, a 2.4 percent slide in daily sales.
   But GM's light truck sales leaped 14.3 percent on a daily basis,
to 57,993 from 56,353 a year earlier, and GM said its daily sales
overall were up 1.9 percent.
   Ford sold 44,994 light trucks, up 1.4 percent on a daily basis,
and Chrysler sold 32,377 for a 10.5 percent increase in daily sales.
   Several foreign carmakers reported U.S. sales for the month of
July.
   Among Japanese car makers, Toyota Motor Corp. reported selling
6,434 of its U.S.-made cars in July, up from 3,289 in July 1987,
and 59,602 of its imported cars, up from 53,345 a year earlier.
   Honda Motor Co. sold 29,125 U.S.-made cars in July, up from
26,287 a year earlier, but its sales of imports slid to 35,042 from
37,009.
   Mazda Motor Corp. sold 19,078 imported cars, down from 20,036
last July, but added 3,023 U.S. made cars. Mazda had no U.S.-made
cars last July; its Flat Rock, Mich., plant opened in September.
   Among European companies, Volkswagen sales fell to 11,831 for
the month from 20,961 in July 1987.
   Mercedes-Benz sold 6,699 of its luxury German imports, down from
7,008 the previous July.

<HEAD>OPEC Committee Concerned Over `Serious Deterioration In Prices'</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   OPEC's price-monitoring committee
expressed concern Wednesday over a ``serious deterioration in
prices'' due partly to overproducing members but failed to schedule
emergency talks to address the problem.
   Meanwhile, OPEC Secretary-General Subroto of Indonesia said he
was optimistic that eventual peace between Iran and Iraq, two major
Gulf oil producers, will help the cartel.
   ``With the cessation of the hostilities OPEC will have a greater
degree of cohesion that will enable it to more effectively help
stabilize the oil market,'' Subroto told a press briefing after the
one-day meeting.
   In its final communique, the pricing committee said it was
concerned about a ``serious deterioration in prices'' since OPEC's
last full meeting in June.
   It said the problem resulted ``mainly from the supply overhang
in the market caused by a significant overproduction in the face of
huge stock buildups, overproduction from some OPEC members as well
as high-level production from non-OPEC oil producers.''
   No alleged offenders were named.
   The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries had pledged to
support an average oil price of $18 a barrel, but world market
prices have fallen below that level.
   The five-nation pricing committee, comprising oil ministers from
Venezuela, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia and Algeria, met behind
closed doors at a luxury hotel.
   The group reviewed the OPEC auditors' report for the cartel's
May production and estimates from outside sources for June and July
production.
   Auditors Klynveld Kraaijenhof & Co. said the 12 OPEC member
countries produced 15.181 million barrels a day of oil in May, up
from 14.86 million barrels a day in April.
   The report indicated that production by the all OPEC members
rose further during June, without giving specific figures for the
rise.
   Subroto said he was given a mandate for further consultations
with all 12 OPEC member countries on several issues pending for the
organization, ahead of its next ministerial conference scheduled
for November.
   He said he will report on the consultations to the monitoring
committee, which will then decide if an extraordinary conference is
warranted.
   ``As of now, we don't think an emergency meeting is called
for,'' he said.

<HEAD>Dollar Slightly Lower, Gold Mostly Higher</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: CORRECTS 4th graf to fix spelling of doldrums.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar drifted fractionally lower Wednesday
against most major currencies after giving a mixed performance
overseas.
   Gold prices were mostly up. Republic National Bank of New York
quoted a bid for gold at $433.25 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT, up
$1.75 from late Tuesday.
   Ron Sapiro, head trader for Continental Illinois National Bank &
Trust Co., said there was little fundamental news affecting trading.
   ``I think we're getting the summer doldrums right now. There's a
lot of activity but in a small range,'' he said.
   Overseas, dealers remained fearful of possible central bank
intervention.
   ``The central banks are sitting at the top, and even light
intervention could drop the market quickly,'' said Steve Barrow,
corporate trader with Chemical Bank in London.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar rose 0.45 Japanese yen to a closing 132.85 yen.
It was quoted at the same rate in London. Later, in New York, the
dollar stood at 132.79 yen, down from 132.98 late Tuesday.
   The British pound fell to $1.7090 from $1.7093 late Tuesday in
London, but rose to $1.71225 in New York from $1.70675.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late rates
Tuesday, included: 1.87465 West German marks, down from 1.87725;
1.56215 Swiss francs, down from 1.5628; 6.3215 French francs, up
from 6.3195; 1.20355 Canadian dollars, down from 1.20595; and
1,382.75 Italian lire, down from 1,383.25.
   Late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Tuesday: 1.8755
West German marks, down from 1.8760; 1.5635 Swiss francs,
unchanged; 6.3235 French francs, down from 6.3265; 2.1150 Dutch
guilders, up from 2.1140; 1.2020 Canadian dollars, down from
1.2068; and 1,382.00 Italian lire, up from 1,380.75.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery closed at $433.30 a troy ounce, up $1.80 from late Tuesday.
   Gold fell in London to a late bid price of $432.25 an ounce from
$433 Tuesday, but rose in Zurich to a bid price of $434 an ounce
from $433. Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $2.70 an ounce to a bid
$433.67.
   Silver prices were higher. Silver for August delivery finished
at $6.835 a troy ounce on New York's Comex, up from $6.792 Tuesday.
   Silver rose in London to a bid price of $6.88 a troy ounce, up
from $6.86 late Tuesday.

<HEAD>Coffee Futures Soar In Sharp Reversal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Coffee futures prices soared more than 9 cents a pound Wednesday
on New York's Coffee, Sugar & Cocoa Exchange in a sharp technical
reversal of a trend that had taken prices to their lowest levels in
a year.
   On other markets, crop futures were mixed; energy prices fell;
precious metals were higher; livestock and meat were mixed; and
stock-index futures advanced.
   Coffee prices had fallen in five of the six previous trading
sessions and ``had just gotten entirely too cheap,'' said Bert
Ruiz, an analyst with Balfour Maclaine Corp. in New York.
   The recent selloff was triggered by speculation that disputes
among the producer and consumer nations in the International Coffee
Organization could lead to the collapse of the agreement governing
trade quotas.
   Ruiz said such talk ``wasn't really rational'' since the
six-year ICO agreement does not expire until Sept. 30, 1989.
Differences among ICO members are expected to be aired at an ICO
council meeting next month.
   Coffee futures also got a boost from the trade bill that was
headed toward President Reagan's desk Wednesday, Ruiz said. The
bill contained a provision to fund customs enforcement of a rule
that all coffee imported by the United States must carry an ICO
stamp.
   The contract for September delivery of coffee settled 9.37 cents
higher at $1.1820 a pound.
   Grain and soybean futures prices finished mixed on the Chicago
Board of Trade as predictions of rain offset the impact of the
crop-wilting heat hovering over the Farm Belt.
   Wheat finished higher, soybeans were mixed and corn and oats
closed mostly lower.
   Analysts said crop conditions had deteriorated in the intense,
dry heat of the past four days, but mixed weather forecasts made
traders unwilling to bet heavily on declining crop yields and
higher prices.
   ``I can find you any forecast you want, from a good rain outlook
over the next 24 to 48 hours to a poor rain outlook,'' said Ted
Mao, grain specialist in New York with Sheason Lehman Hutton Inc.
   ``It's all a matter of individual meteorologists'
interpretations of computer models,'' he said.
   After the close, the National Weather Service issued a
six-to-10-day forecast calling for very hot, mostly dry conditions
in the Midwest during the five days beginning next Tuesday.
   Wheat prices advanced on news that China had purchased 500,000
metric tons of subsidized U.S. wheat, analysts said. The
Agriculture Department announced another 500,000-ton Chinese wheat
purchase after the close.
   Wheat settled 1 cent to 5 cents higher with September at $3.80{
a bushel; corn was 3{ cents lower to 1{ cents higher with September
at $2.97{ a bushel; oats were 5\ cents to 7 cents lower with
September at $2.83{ a bushel; soybeans were 3{ cents lower to 6{
cents higher with August at $8.35{ a bushel.
   Energy futures prices fell on the New York Mercantile Exchange,
with products outpacing crude oil in a volatile session marked by
the market's attention to OPEC developments.
   Prices surged at midday in anticipation of a bullish
announcement from the OPEC pricing committee meeting in Lausanne,
Switzerland.
   But when the meeting ended, OPEC Secretary-General Subroto
announced no new plans to lower crude oil production and raise
pricers, and futures prices plunged.
   ``The market just tanked and buyers were running and hiding,''
said Peter Beutel, an analyst in New York with Elders Futures Inc.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 29 cents to 36 cents
lower with September at $15.26 a barrel; heating oil was 1.24 cents
to 1.42 cents lower with September at 42.96 cents a gallon;
unleaded gasoline was 1.20 cents to 2.65 cents lower with September
at 45.21 cents a gallon.
   Precious metals futures advanced slightly in light trading on
the Commodity Exchange in New York.
   Gold settled $1.80 to $1.90 higher with August at $433.30 a troy
ounce; silver was 3.4 cents to 4.3 cents higher with August at
$6.835 a troy ounce.
   Cattle and frozen pork belly futures advanced on mostly
technical factors while hogs futures prices fell due to
heavier-than-expected cash sales and expectations that producers
would continue to move hogs to market despite the extreme heat,
analysts said.
   Live cattle were .35 cent to .80 cent higher with August at
65.85 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .30 cent to 1.25 cent
higher with August at 78.47 cents a pound; hogs were unchanged to
.35 cent lower with August at 45.17 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were unchanged to 1.32 cents higher with August at 33.47
cents a pound.
   Stock-index futures advanced on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange,
where the contract for September delivery of the Standard & Poor's
500 index settled 1 point higher at 274.05.

<HEAD>Coastal Corp. and China National Chemicals To Form Joint Venture</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH RENDON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Coastal Corp. and a government-owned Chinese
company announced plans Wednesday to form a joint venture for
ownership and operation of Coastal's West Coast refining and
marketing properties.
   The announcement said Coastal signed an agreement Tuesday with
China National Chemicals Import-Export Corp., also known as
Sinochem, in which Sinochem will acquire a 50 percent interest in
the joint-venture company for an undisclosed amount of cash.
   Other Chinese companies and investors have interests in American
real estate, but none have bought an interest in oil properties,
said Frank Knuettel, an oil analyst with Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc.
   Alicia M. Quijano with the U.S. Commerce Department declined to
comment on whether Sinochem was indeed the first company from a
communist country to buy into an American energy company.
   David Fleischer, who follows the refinery industry for
Prudential-Bache, said he suspected Coastal would not disclose the
purchase amount because it is still negotiating to sell other
refining ventures. Most of those negotiations, he said, are with
Middle Eastern countries.
   In a July 29 report, Fleischer said that a sale of a one-half
interest in the company's refining assets would likely bring over
$700 million in cash. Fleischer said Wednesday that the newly
announced agreement would probably amount to less than 20 percent
of that total.
   Fleischer also estimated the joint venture would release working
capital of $40 million to $50 million to Coastal.
   Jim Bailey, a spokesman for Coastal, said the money from the
sale has not been earmarked and would not comment on whether the
proceeds would go toward Coastal's goal of paying off debt
resulting from its 1985 acquisition of American Natural Resources.
   Coastal has been saying for some time that it wanted to sell
half of its refining interests because of the volatility of the
industry.
   ``But foreign countries are interested in buying refineries in
the United States and having the final destination of where the
product goes,'' Fleischer said.
   Coastal operations to be assigned to the joint venture include a
refinery at Hercules, Calif.; fuel oil terminals at Los Angeles and
Coos Bay, Ore.; and marketing operations at San Francisco, San
Pedro and Long Beach, Calif., and Portland, Ore.
   ``We are enthusiastic about this new joint venture, which will
strengthen the tradition of excellent relations between our company
and Sinochem, started in 1978 when Coastal became the first
American company to purchase and import crude from the People's
Republic of China,'' said Oscar S. Wyatt Jr., Coastal's chairman
and chief executive officer.
   The joint venture may be the start of a trend for American oil
companies to sell their interests to foreign countries.
   ``You'll see more refinery assets being sold and most buyers
will be foreign countries,'' Fleischer said.
   The Hercules refinery, operated by Pacific Refining Co., a
Coastal subsidiary, has a refining capacity of 55,000 barrels per
day and storage for 2.2 million barrels. The terminals operated by
Western Fuel Oil Co., another Coastal subsidiary, have a combined
capacity of 1.4 million barrels of refined petroleum products.
   The memorandum agreement includes plans for capital expenditures
to upgrade the Hercules refinery for expanded production of higher
octane gasolines and other transportation fuels. A crude oil supply
agreement also will be negotiated between Sinochem and the joint
venture company.
   ``We are pleased with this opportunty to expand our fine
business relationship with Coastal through our investment and
participation in this new joint-venture company,'' said Zheng
Dunxun, chief executive officer and president of Sinochem.
   ``This agreement is also another step forward in Sinochem's
continuing efforts to diversify and strengthen its oil markets and
to expand its worldwide operations.''
   Sinochem is a state-owned, international diversified business
corporation of the People's Republic of China in Beijing.
   Houston-based Coastal is a diversified energy company with total
assets of $8 billion and operations in natural gas pipelines, oil
and gas exploration and production, refining and marketing, coal
and trucking.

<HEAD>Consumer Confidence Dips; Markets Quiet</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Drought has spread pessimism through parts of the country and
dragged down a national index of consumers' confidence, a
business-supported research group said Wednesday.
   In other drought-related news, grain and soybean futures prices
finished mixed on the Chicago Board of Trade as predictions of rain
offset the impact of the crop-wilting heat hovering over the Farm
Belt.
   The Worldwatch Institute, a private research organization, said
drought in the United States, Canada and China will produce the
steepest one-year drop in world grain stocks ever recorded.
   On Wall Street Wednesday, stock prices edged upward and the Dow
Jones average of 30 industrial stocks rose 2.85 to 2,134.07.
   Bonds fell in light trading, which brokers called a reaction to
the market's sharp rise earlier this week and investor apprehension
about an impending government report on unemployment.
   The dollar drifted fractionally lower against most major
currencies after giving a mixed performance overseas. Gold prices
rose.
   In other economic news, car sales rose in late July at Ford
Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. but fell at General Motors Corp. in
comparison with a year earlier.
   The Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index fell in July to
113 from a revised 115.7 in June and a peak of 120.2 in May.
Despite the decline, the index remained well above its recent low
of 100.8 in November, the month after the stock market crash.
   ``Virtually all of the loss in consumer confidence during the
last two months can be attributed to the drought,'' Fabian Linden,
executive director of the board's Consumer Research Center, said in
a prepared statement.
   The survey revealed stark regional differences in consumers'
attitudes.
   In New England, where the economy is strong and the weather has
been less dry, the confidence index rose in July to 154.2 from
149.8.
   By contrast, in the drought-plagued West North Central states of
Minnesota, Iowa, Missouri, North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska and
Kansas, the confidence index plunged to 69.7 from 91.4.

<HEAD>GM Extends Warranty Coverage</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TRAVERSE CITY, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Motors Corp. will make a new
attack in the warranty wars among automakers with three-year,
50,000-mile coverage on most of its 1989 cars and light trucks, GM
President Robert C. Stempel said Wednesday.
   The change extends GM's current 12-month, 12,000-mile ``bumper
to bumper'' warranty covering virtually all repairs, but drops its
added six-year, 60,000-mile coverage on engines and transmissions,
Stempel said.
   Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. officials did not immediately
say whether they would follow suit.
   Stempel told a University of Michigan Management Briefing
Seminars session the new warranties will cover virtually all
repairs except accident damage, including repairs of air
conditioning, steering and suspension systems and electronics and
power options.
   ``Every part is covered, from front to back, from road to
roof,'' he said.
   In the last round of warranty upgrades, GM had announced in
January it was extending coverage on engines and transmissions to
six years or 60,000 miles.
   Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. have 12-month or 12,000-mile
basic warranties similar to GM's. Both quickly matched GM's longer
engine and transmission warranties.
   But Stempel said two thirds of those polled in GM customer
surveys favored the three-year, 50,000-mile coverage on the entire
vehicle over the current plan.
   GM has offered complete vehicle coverage for three years or
80,000 kilometers (49,600 miles) on vehicles sold in Canada since
February and Canadian customers said they preferred that coverage,
Stempel said.
   Ford will study the GM move, spokesman Charles L. Snearly said.
``It is always our intention to keep Ford and Lincoln-Mercury
dealers competitive.''
   For now, Snearly said, ``We believe our present warranty is a
good one and serves the customer well. Our six-year, 60,000-mile
power train warranty is comparable to others in the industry.''
   Chrysler officials had no immediate comment on the GM move or
whether Chrysler would follow suit, spokesman Thomas F. Houston
said.

<HEAD>Chief Executives See U.S. Technology Edge Slipping</HEAD>

   Two-thirds of chief executives of big industrial
companies say the United States is the world's technology leader,
but only half expect it to retain the lead by the end of the
century, a new poll says.
   Forty-five percent of the more than 120 executives who responded
to a poll sponsored by Research & Development magazine predicted
Japan would be the world leader in technology and research and
development by the end of the century.
   The poll was released by the magazine for publication Thursday.
   Although somewhat gloomy, the chief executives were more
optimistic than a group of top research scientists surveyed earlier
this year. Only 48 percent of the scientists said the United States
was ahead and only 38 percent said it would be ahead by the year
2000.
   The survey results reflect accurately to within 10 percentage
points the views of all 476 of the chief executives whose companies
are ranked among the nation's 1,000 biggest companies, the magazine
said.
   About 75 percent of the executives agreed with a statement that
``U.S. companies generally have a short-term view of research and
development, sacrificing long-term gains for short-term profits.''
   Nevertheless, the survey indicated that growth of spending on
research and development would slow down at the companies, to an
average annual rate of 11.3 percent through 1990 in comparison with
16 percent from 1984 through 1987.
   On the question of U.S. leadership, 67.2 percent of the
executives said the United States leads now, while 51 percent said
it will be the leader in the year 2000.

   Drought has spread pessimism through parts of the country and
dragged down a national index of consumer confidence, a
business-supported research group has reported.
   In other drought-related news Wednesday, grain and soybean
futures prices finished mixed on the Chicago Board of Trade as
predictions of rain offset the impact of the crop-wilting heat
hovering over the Farm Belt.
   Also, the Worldwatch Institute, a private research organization,
said drought in the United States, Canada and China will produce
the steepest one-year drop in world grain stocks ever recorded in
1988.

   OPEC's price-monitoring committee
has expressed concern over a ``serious deterioration in prices''
due partly to overproducing members but failed to schedule
emergency talks to address the problem.
   Prices fell sharply in oil futures trading in response to the
news Wednesday.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the contract for September
delivery of West Texas Intermediate crude oil, fell 35 cents a
barrel to close at $15.26.

   The nation's 13 largest airlines in June had
their best record of on-time flights since the government began
issuing reports on their performance last fall, the Department of
Transportation said.
   In its monthly report Wednesday, the department said 84.3
percent of the airlines' flights that were tallied operated on

   The Treasury Department has announced it will
borrow $29 billion to replenish government coffers next week, but
for the first time in six years will not issue 30-year bonds at its
quarterly auctions.
   No 30-year bonds will be issued because the government has used
up practically all of its congressional authority to do so, the
Treasury said Wednesday.

   Stock prices edged upward Wednesday, and the Dow Jones average
of 30 industrial stocks rose 2.85 to 2,134.07.
   Bonds fell in light trading, which brokers called a reaction to
the market's sharp rise earlier this week and investor apprehension
about an impending government report on unemployment.
   The dollar drifted fractionally lower, gold prices rose and crop
futures were mixed.

   The Senate approved and sent to President
Reagan on Wednesday a major bill to combat the massive U.S.
deficits in world trade.
   The lawmakers finished work with strong hopes Reagan would sign
the legislation and end three years of wrangling over the issue.
   ``This is a strong bill but not a protectionist bill,'' Sen.
John C. Danforth, R-Mo., told the Senate before the 85-11 vote.
``It is designed to enforce the rules of international trade. It
makes American trade policy credible for once.''
   The bill, which followed a torturous course, still had one loose
end dangling even after the Senate vote.
   The senators planned to take up immediately a resolution that
would change one provision _ a feature that increases duty
free-imports of Caribbean ethanol.
   If approved by both the House and the Senate, the resolution
would instruct congressional clerks to strip the ethanol provision
out of the bill before sending the measure on to Reagan.
   Earlier, Senate leaders fought off a swarm of last-minute
changes proposed by corn growes and others as they hastened to pass
the bill.
   The measure had been dormant on the Senate calendar for two
weeks but was rejuvenated Tuesday when Reagan said that he would
not veto a separate piece of legislation requiring companies to
give employees advance notice of plant-closings and large-scale
layoffs.
   ``If we are going to get this bill, and we need this bill, we
are going to have to defeat some of the amendments that are going
to be offered,'' Sen. Robert Packwood, R-Ore. told the Senate.
   By wide margins, the Senate then voted to table, or kill,
proposed changes that would have curbed imports of Soviet fur,
strengthened presidential control over trade retaliation machinery
and barred the government from granting preferred trade status to
the Soviet Union.
   Farm lawmakers led by Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, pleaded
with the Senate to strip from the bill a provision opposed by corn
growers that would increase duty-free imports of Caribbean ethanol
_ ethyl alcohol made from farm goods and mixed with gasoline to
make the fuel gasohol.
   As the afternoon wore on, however, they indicated they would be
content with a separate resolution.
   It was a convulted finale for what has been one of the most
complex and snarled issues to face Congress in recent years.
   The corn growers say much of the Caribbean ethanol is merely
European agricultural goods, such as Spanish wine, reprocessed in
island refineries and shipped to the United States under duty-free
status prescribed by the Caribbean Basin Initiative.
   ``For every job that is created by reprocessing European wine in
the Caribbean Basin, you can create 100 jobs ... using corn grown
by our American family farmers using our own ethanol plants,''
Grassley declared.
   He warned his colleagues they might face campaign ads accusing
them of ``voting against the American farmer and the American
worker.''
   Leaders were trying to bring the much debated, 1,000-page bill
through the Senate exactly as it cleared the House 286-136 on July
13 and send it immediately to President Reagan's desk.
   Leaders warned that making changes would propel the measure into
a House-Senate conference committee to resolve differences with
only 25 legislative days remaining before lawmakers leave
Washington to campaign full time.
   At the heart of the bill is a provision that would authorize the
Reagan administration to reach agreements in the current Uruguay
Round of world trade talks and guarantee accelerated consideration
on Capitol Hill for any deals.
   The administration's eagerness to secure such authorization
figured heavily in Reagan's decision Tuesday not to veto the
plant-closing legislation.
   Other key provisions would streamline the machinery under which
the United States imposes import restraints to protect U.S.
industry and retaliate against international trade violations and
other unfair practices.
   The bill would step up assistance and retraining of employees
who lose jobs in layoffs, authorizing $80 million for expansion of
the traditional program and $980 million for a new worker
readjustment plan.
   It would authorize the Treasury Department to enter negotiations
to solve Third World debt problems. The measure contains a
potential $2.5 billion in new agricultural subsidies.
   The bill bars Toshiba Corp. of Japan and Kongsberg Vaapenfabrikk
of Norway from selling goods to the U.S. government for three
years. The disciplinary action was designed as a response to the
action of subsidiaries of the two companies in selling
submarine-silencing equipment to the Soviet Union.
   There are a number of exceptions, such as for spare parts.
   The subsidiaries would be barred from selling goods commercially
in the United States and to the government for three years.
   Under the bill, it would become more difficult for prosecutors
to win convictions against U.S. businessmen for bribes paid by
their overseas agents to foreign officials. The windfall profits
tax imposed on oil-industry earnings in 1980 would be repealed.

<HEAD>IRS Rules on Tax-Free Status of Planned Burlington Distribution</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Internal Revenue Service has ruled that
Burlington Northern Inc.'s planned distribution of its share of a
new company to BN stockholders would be free of federal income
taxes, Burlington said Wednesday.
   Burlington Northern created Burlington Resources Inc. as a
holding company for BN's energy and resource business on June 2,
and offered stock to the public in early July. With the initial
offering, BN held 130 million shares, or approximately 87 percent
of Burlington Resources' stock.
   BN officials have they hoped to spin off the railroad's stake in
the holding company to shareholders if the IRS ruled the transfer
could be tax-free.
   BN said in a news release that its board of directors will
consider the proposed distribution at their December meeting. By
that time, BN will have met the IRS requirement that The El Paso
Co. be owned at least five years in order to qualify for a tax-free
spin-off.
   In addition to El Paso, which owns and operates a 22,000-mile
natural gas pipeline, Burlington Resources holds Meridian Oil Inc.,
an independent oil and gas producer; Plum Creek Timber Co., a
timber and forest products company; Meridian Minerals Co., a coal
and minerals company; and Glacier Park Co., a real estate
management, development and sales company.

   The U.S. dollar opened slightly lower Thursday in
Tokyo, while stock prices gained moderately on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange.
   The dollar opened at 132.75 yen, down from Wednesday's close of
132.85 yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues gained 92.33
points to 28,440.78 in the first 15 minutes of trading.
   Securities dealers attributed the stock market's gain to the
stability of the dollar, but also said rumors of tightened margin
trading requirements were sidelining investors.
   ``If the exchange tightens control on margin trade, prices of
large-capital shares, which have been leading the market in recent
days, are bound to decline,'' said a dealer at a major securities
firm in Tokyo. ``But other than the rumors, the market situation
looks fine.''

   Striking screenwriters reached tentative
agreement with motion picture and television producers Wednesday,
effectively ending a 150-day walkout that paralyzed Hollywood and
left the fall TV schedule in shambles.
   ``It was time to bring it to a conclusion and the deal was
there,'' Brian Walton, chief guild negotiator, said at a joint news
conference.
   ``We are very pleased to have reached a tentative agreement,''
said Nicholas Counter III, chief negotiator for the Alliance of
Motion Picture and Television Producers. Asked who won, Counter
said: ``No one wins a strike.''
   Walton said the agreement reflected ``some serious bargaining.''
   Members of the Writers Guild of America were expected to ratify
the contract at a membership meeting later this week, and
scriptwriters may return to work as early as Monday.
   ``Thank God! Isn't that wonderful news? We're all champing at
the bit to go back to work,'' said actress Betty White, the
Emmy-winning star of NBC-TV's ``The Golden Girls,'' after she heard
about the agreement.
   Writer I.C. Rapoport, who wrote the CBS television movie ``Cook
and Peary: Race To The Pole,'' said he was ``relieved that the
strike is over _ and so is my family. I can start earning some
money again.''
   ABC Entertainment President Brandon Stoddard said in a statement
that settlement of the strike this week would leave his network
``able to premiere most of our fall schedule either before, after
or combined with (the miniseries) `War and Remembrance' in
November.'' Premiere dates would be announced soon, he said.
   The settlement announcement ends what had become one of the
longest and more painful strikes in modern Hollywood history,
surpassed only by the WGA's 1960 walkout, which lasted 23 weeks.
The current walkout began March 7, 21{ weeks ago.
   Federal mediator Floyd Wood said no details of the contract
would be released until the WGA's board of directors on the West
Coast and East Coast are informed of the agreement during an
evening telephone conference call.
   The joint boards will then vote via telephone and results will
be revealed later during a news conference at guild headquarters in
West Hollywood.
   ``It was a fair deal _ negotiated, not dictated _ and it was
OK,'' said a member of the negotiating committee who asked not to
be identified.
   News of the settlement came after two days of intense efforts by
a variety of intermediaries to bring an end to the 22-week-long
walkout.
   Final contract details were ironed out at an 12-hour meeting
between Walton and Counter that ended early Wednesday.
   The pair, who had repeatedly sniped at each other throughout the
walkout, shook hands after the announcement.
   As recently as last weekend, it looked as though the two sides
were at an impasse, with a producers spokesman saying talks were
``hopelessly deadlocked.''
   Despite the strike settlement, the fall television season cannot
proceed as planned. Its start will be delayed, perhaps until
November. The financial costs to the networks could range into tens
of millions of dollars.
   The WGA has 9,000 members, most living and working in Southern
California. The alliance has 217 member companies, responsible for
85 percent of network primetime television and 90 percent of
feature film production and distribution.
   The contract proposal reflects improvements in the foreign
residual structure and gains in the area of creative rights, the
main issues dogging negotiations, said the union negotiator.
   Alliance spokesman Herb Steinberg credited the break in the
stalemated talks to the two federal mediators, Wood and Leonard
Farrell. The two ``had a considerable role in keeping the dialogue
open,'' he said.
   The settlement brings to an end a period of acrimony that has
few recent equals. Lawsuits were filed by both parties and
